        "text": "Not only is the current website you’re clicking through called The Disney Classics, but fans around the world have coined some of Disney’s films they’ve released as classics in their lives, in their homes, and Disney has even taken on that term. In the late 1970s, Disney partnered with MCA to release Laserdisc versions of their films, making their movies available to the public for the very first time for purchase. In 1984, Disney ended their partnership with MCA and began selling VHS cassette tapes. They wanted to ensure they kept the integrity of the Disney vault program and only do very strategic releases of titles at very specific times. The Walt Disney Classics collection featured films that would never be aired on television (at the time) since their revenue during their theatrical rereleases was more significant. These Classics included Robin Hood, Pinocchio, Dumbo, The Sword in the Stone, Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, Bambi, The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan, The Jungle Book, The Rescuers Down Under, Fantasia, 101 Dalmatians, The Great Mouse Detective, The Rescuers, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Fox and the Hound. The line was discontinued after The Fox and the Hound was added.\n\nWhy is this relevant? With the various collections Disney was putting together and many of the movies becoming cult classics among fans, it was only a matter of time before Disney content needed to start being preserved in the United States. The National Film Registry was established in 1988 by the National Film Preservation Act, and it would act as an ever-growing library of content that represented America’s film heritage. Each year, 25 films would be recommended by 44 members of the National Film Preservation Board. Of those 25 films from 1988 until the present year, 22 Disney films have made it into the registry, along with countless Disney affiliated movies through other studios and other video formats. For the purpose of this article, we’ll focus on the 22 that have made it onto the list.\n\ndisney films that were added in the 1980s\n\nThere was only one Disney film added to the registry in the 1980s, and that was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), officially nominated and inducted in 1989. The film holds American film cultural significance as the very first animated feature-length film to ever be produced and released in theatres. It was a huge accomplishment for the company, for the film industry, and for artists."
