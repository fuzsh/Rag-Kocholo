        "text": "Each year, when the Library of Congress announces the 25 films of “cultural, historic or aesthetic significance” selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry, a few no-brainers are listed.\n\nAmong those understandably chosen for preservation as national treasures: L.A. Confidential, a 1997 neo-noir mystery by Curtis Hanson that turned a little-known Australian actor, Russell Crowe, into a household name.\n\nWorks eligible to be considered for the registry, established in 1989, must be at least 10 years old.\n\nThe latest selections, raising the total to 675, were picked by acting Librarian of Congress David Mao, with the guidance of the National Film Preservation Board and Library of Congress film staff.\n\nThroughout the year, members of the public are encouraged to submit nominations of worthy films at www.loc.gov/film\n\nThe other 2015 honorees include Academy Award winners such as Being There (1979), Top Gun (1986) and The Old Mill (1937).\n\nThe Old Mill, produced by the Walt Disney Co., offers an animated short, notable not only for its lifelike rendering of animals but also for its first use of the multi-plane camera, which delivered a sense of 3-D depth by its ability to shoot a scene through several transparent layers — stacked one atop the other — at once.\n\nFans of director Douglas Sirk will delight to see that his 1959 melodrama, Imitation of Life, also made the cut.\n\nBeyond the reasonable choices are the movies to be met with a collective “Huh?”\n\nSymbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One — a hard-to-describe 1968 film about the making of a movie that languished unseen until 1991, when it was rediscovered for a retrospective of the career of filmmaker William Greaves, who died last year — seems to be just such a head-scratcher.\n\nAnother surprise, along with the seconds-long 1894 Kinetoscope clip by Thomas Edison of a heavily mustachioed man sneezing, is Ghostbusters.\n\nYup, the durable 1984 comedy — which spawned a 1989 sequel as well as a distaff reboot, set for release in the summer, with Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones — has joined the elite of filmdom.\n\nEffective immediately, supernatural silliness and ectoplasmic slime take their rightful place — in the temperature- and humidity-controlled vaults of the nation — alongside some of the finest and most perishable cinematic works.\n\nThe movies selected this year for the National Film Registry:\n\n• Black and Tan(1929)\n\n• Dracula, Spanish-language version (1931)\n\n• Dream of a Rarebit Fiend(1906)\n\n• Eadweard Muybridge, Zoopraxographer(1975)\n\n• Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze(1894)\n\n• A Fool There Was(1915)\n\n• Ghostbusters(1984)\n\n• Hail the Conquering Hero(1944)\n\n• Humoresque(1920)\n\n• Imitation of Life(1959)\n\n• The Inner World of Aphasia(1968)\n\n• John Henry and the Inky-Poo(1946)\n\n• L.A. Confidential(1997)\n\n• The Mark of Zorro(1920)\n\n• The Old Mill(1937)\n\n• Our Daily Bread(1934)\n\n• Portrait of Jason(1967)\n\n• Seconds(1966)\n\n• The Shawshank Redemption(1994)\n\n• Sink or Swim(1990)\n\n• The Story of Menstruation(1946)\n\n• Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One(1968)\n\n• Top Gun(1986)\n\n• Winchester ’73(1950)"
