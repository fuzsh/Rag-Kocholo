        "text": "National Film Registry Essay: Every year I make a list of films that I am nominating for the National Film Registry (NFR), which since 1989 has selected up to twenty-five American films a year considered “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” for preservation in the Library of Congress. The public is free to nominate up to 50 films a year provided that 1) the film is at least ten years old and 2) the film is an American production. My current list only has one spot open, so I would prefer to dedicate that spot to an essay about why I think the film is important to American culture.\n\nMuch has been said of Ishiro Honda’s Gojira (1954), which to this day has stood the test of time as an exciting monster film, as well as allegory for the terrors of strategic bombing and the consequences of nuclear weapons testing. In addition to starting a popular kaiju franchise that continues even to this day, Godzilla has gone on to be a Japanese icon, even being recognized now as a citizen of Japan.\n\nLess is said, nowadays, of the American release of the film Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), which is infamous for its heavy alterations to please a Western audience. The changes were so great, in fact, that many consider it to be a completely different film than the original, which is precisely my argument. That while most of the source footage is Japanese, Godzilla, King of the Monsters! is a uniquely American work of significant cultural value which should be selected for preservation by the National Film Registry (NFR).\n\nFirst of all, I should explain why Godzilla, King of the Monsters! deserves the distinction of “American film”, more so than other past American releases of foreign cinema, such as The Chinese Connection (originally Fist of Fury) or Warriors of the Wind (originally Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind). One similarity that it shares with these films is that the original languages are dubbed over with English voices. A stronger similarity that it has with Warriors of the Wind, is that it not only dubbed over the original voices, but that it also greatly edited the footage into a more simplified plot to appeal to Western audiences. These changes, however, are not sufficient to justify calling it an American film, but what does justify it are the new scenes produced in Los Angeles.\n\nThe new footage for Godzilla, King of the Monsters! was directed by Terry O. Morse on a sound stage in La Brea Avenue for $100,000. The new scenes starred actor Raymond Burr (of Rear Window) who acted as the reporter “Steve Martin.” Other new actors included the Japanese-American, Frank Iwanaga, as well as other Asian-American extras. The new scenes were edited to mesh seamlessly with the original Japanese footage, so audiences would get the impression that Burr was there and reacting to the events. A great deal of work was put into the integration, with Morse going so far as to cast actors who worse similar clothes and resembled the original Japanese ones. In this sense, Godzilla, King of the Monsters! is a record of considerable Asian-American talent, however minor.\n\nNFR does not prohibit foreign productions per se, but notes that it has “included only those films that were produced or co-produced by an American film company or individual.” Does Godzilla, King of the Monsters! not fulfill this criteria? The new scenes were produced by the American company, Jewel Enterprises and directed by an American, Terry O. Morse. In fact, I would argue that Godzilla, King of the Monsters! is already considered an American work.\n\nNFR implores would-be nominators to check their nominee’s country of origin on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). If one checks for Godzilla, King of the Monsters! on IMDb, they will see that nations of origin listed as the Japan and the United States. The Criterion Collection, who, as far as I know, currently owns the copyrights to the film, names its country of origin as the United States. No less an authority than the American Film Institute lists Godzilla, King of the Monsters! in its 1893–1993 catalog of the first 100 years of American feature films. AFI also names the countries of production as Japan and the United States.\n\nThe fact that Godzilla, King of the Monsters! is a co-production with Japan, and owes most of its footage to Japan, should not disqualify it from inclusion. There exists a precedent for American-foreign co-productions being selected by the National Film Registry: Bridge of the River Kwai (British-American), Lawrence of Arabia (British-American), Once Upon a Time in the West (Italian-American), Enter The Dragon (Hong Kong-American), The Shining (British-American), and El Notre (British-American).\n\nNow that I’ve established that Godzilla, King of the Monsters! is, in part, an American film, what is its significance to American culture? The first thing is that it introduced a whole generation of Western audiences to Japanese popular cinema and kaiju films, as Steve Ryfle, the co-author of Ishiro Honda: A Life in Film, from Godzilla to Kurosawa, wrote in Criterion,\n\n“While the works of Kurosawa et al. were limited to art-house distribution abroad, Honda’s films played to mainstream moviegoing audiences in the U.S. and across the West, and they have subsequently become ensconced in the pop-culture pantheon. Honda’s influence is undeniable: as one of the creators of the modern disaster film, he helped set the template for countless blockbusters to follow, and a wide array of filmmakers — including John Carpenter, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, and Guillermo del Toro — have expressed their admiration for his work.”\n\nThis influence, however, is primarily due to the American version, which was the only version most international audiences could see until 2004. The reverberation of Godzilla in American culture in felt everywhere, parodied in Bambi Meets Godzilla, The Simpsons, and South Park, inspiring the Blue Oyster Cult song “Godzilla” and influencing Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park, who called it, “the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening.” The film also brought the word “Godzilla” into the popular lexicon, as we see with “Bridezilla” and “Mozilla Firefox”. Lastly in 2004, on the original Gojira’s 50th anniversary, the monster received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe aesthetic significance of the film speaks for itself. While the original Gojira is a superior work, Godzilla, King of the Monsters! has aged considerably well. It has maintained the somber and emotional tone of the Japanese version, as well as keeping intact the footage of the spectacular special effects, most notably, Haruo Nakajima’s performance in the green, rubber suit. In the history of American cinema, Godzilla, King of the Monsters! stands as a unique experiment of in mixing Japanese footage with new sets and actors. A technique that would later be used to create Haim Saban’s Power Rangers, which mixed in footage from Super Sentai with American actors. No one thinks that the Power Rangers is the same as Super Sentai, and neither does anyone see the Power Rangers as a Japanese show. Power Rangers is seen as a unique American work, and so it should also be with Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\n\nMake your own nominations to the 2020 National Film Registry by September 15, 2020: https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/nominate/\n\n2020 NFR Nominee List\n\nBarney Oldfield’s Race For A Life (1913)\n\nBottle Rocket (1980)\n\nThe Cat Concerto (1947)\n\nDer Fuehrer’s Face (1943)\n\n20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954)\n\nThe Defiant Ones (1958)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nRape Culture (1973)\n\nGimme Shelter (1970)\n\nWhat’s Up, Doc?

(1956)\n\nNFR Nominee Justifications\n\nBarney Oldfield’s Race For A Life (1913)\n\nA classic silent comedy that immortalized the famous image of a damsel in distress being tied to the train tracks by a mustachioed villain. The film also features the Keystone Cops, who stand along with Chaplin and Keaton as comedy icons of America’s silent film era.\n\n2. Bottle Rocket (1996)\n\nWes Anderson’s films have gone on to represent independent filmmaking in America for many years, and much of that started with his meandering debut Bottle Rocket. The film, though flawed, maintains a strong focus of friendship between its cast, through the adventures of bored middle class suburban teenagers who try to become professional criminals. Bottle Rocket is a looking-glass, perhaps, into America’s restless Generation X, as well as into the creativity of Anderson’s own mind.\n\n3. The Cat Concerto (1947)\n\nTom and Jerry are one of the most popular duos in animation history, and the oft copied Cat Concerto stands as one of their finest examples. Tom and Jerry compete with a piano while Franz Liszt’s famous Hungarian Rhapsody №2 plays on. The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject and was included on Jerry Beck’s 50 Greatest Cartoons.\n\n4. Der Fuehrer’s Face (1943)\n\nDuring World War II, Disney produced multiple animated propaganda films to sway public opinion in favor of the war. Der Fuehrer’s Face is an excellent example as it features Donald Duck living under the horror of the Nazi regime. Much like Chaplin’s The Great Dictator, it is a great satire of Nazi Germany. The film one the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject.\n\n5. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954)\n\nDisney’s 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is one of the most famous and critically acclaimed adaptations of Jules Verne’s enduring novel. The film has a cast of some of Old Hollywood’s best actors: Paul Lukas, Kirk Douglas, Peter Lorre, and most famously, James Mason as the chilling Captain Nemo, who stands as one of the most morally complex characters ever put onto film. The film is one of Disney’s most mature, carrying many of Verne’s themes on personal freedom, the dangers of science, and the failings of society. It is especially interesting that the film was released during the Cold War, so much of the growing fears about nuclear war are cleverly added to the film. The movie itself is a special effects milestone, featuring an impressive giant squid and winning the Oscar for Special Effects that year.\n\n6. The Defiant Ones (1958)\n\nStanley Kramer’s The Defiant Ones is great film about America’s changing attitudes towards racism against blacks. The film stars Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as prisoners on the run chained together. The two, in many ways, are a microcosm for the racial tensions between blacks and whites in America, but their ultimate ability to work together shows the superiority of friendship over racial prejudice. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n7. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nPeter Jackson’s opening feature of his critically acclaimed Lord of the Rings Trilogy, which along with Harry Potter, reinvigorated an interest in fantasy, and promoted the accessibility of blockbusters over two hours long. The film is a fantasy epic with an ensemble cast, including the likes of Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving among others, which centers on the friendship between its leads, Frodo and Sam, as they go on an odyssey to throw the One Ring into the fires of Mt. Doom. The film echoes back to older epics, such as Ben-Hur and Gone With The Wind, that has a memorable grand score, along with a balanced use of computer animation and practical effects to create truly breathtaking shots and scenes. The author of the original trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien, once called his books “unfilmmable”. Conversely, The Fellowship of the Ring as one of the first major pictures of the 21 stcentury represents just how far American films have come since D.W. Griffith’s opuses. Indeed, it is a culmination of all the breakthroughs American movies have made in the 20 thcentury, and a golden standard by which future American films would be set to. Fellowship of the Ring was nominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and was added to the American Film Institute’s list “100 Years…100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).”\n\n8. Rape Culture (1973)\n\nA raw documentary produced by Prisoners Against Rape, the DC Rape Crisis Center, and political filmmakers Margaret Lazarus, and Renner Wunderlich, Rape Culture is probably one of the first movies to examine the crime of rape in its ugly forms and the roles that Hollywood films, pornography, masculinity, and racism have played in its persistence. The film also features various feminists such as Mary Daly, who give viewers a glimpse into radical second-wave feminism. Although many aspects of the film may seem quite obtuse today, the film represented a time in American history when the causes of rape began to be identified, or at least discussed. Whether or not one agrees with all of its assertions, or even the existence of rape culture, the film represents a visual milestone in the start of a conversation that still continues to this day.\n\n9. Gimme Shelter (1970)\n\nEver since the British Invasion of the 1960’s, The Rolling Stones have been a staple of American rock music. The first half of the movie shows their energetic live performances on concert and the stresses that go into recording their songs. The Stones were not at Woodstock, but they did have their own sort of festival at the Altamont Free Concert. Thus, the second half of Gimme Shelter depicts the concert itself, set up at the Altamont Highway. This section of the film shows some of the crude excesses of the counterculture, which tragically culminated in a murder during The Stone’s song, “Sympathy For The Devil”. In a sense, this film is a gritty contrast to idealistic flower power of Woodstock. Gimmie Shelter has since been added into the Criterion Collection.\n\n10. What’s Up, Doc? (1972)\n\nPeter Bogdanovich’s excellent tribute to the screwball comedies of the 1930’s that manages to be something of a great comedy in itself. The movie keeps in the tradition of the New Hollywood era which were the first films directed by people who had grown up on films. The American Film Institute included it as one of the nation’s best comedies.\n\n11. The Patterson-Gimlin Film (1968)\n\nThe Patterson-Gimlin film is believed by many to be the best evidence for Bigfoot captured on film. At the very least, it has captured the fascination of many since its release. Even if one doesn’t believe in Bigfoot, the film has played a big role in shaping our popular understanding of the elusive beast. Indeed, if there could be one film you would use to symbolize our ongoing fascination with Bigfoot, this one is probably it.\n\n12. Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nEpisode VI of the Star Wars saga may not be the best in the Original Trilogy, but it’s a undoubtedly a great film that’s worth preserving. The special effects were second to none at the time, with grand spectacles being Jabba´s Palace, the Battle of Endor, and the final showdown at the Second Death Star. VI also brings an acceptable end to Luke Skywalker’s bildungsroman as a Jedi who conveys tact and wisdom upon his confrontation with Darth Vader. Indeed, it is the essential resolution to an American mythos and a proper end to one of the greatest film trilogies.\n\n13. Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (1982)\n\nThe series, Star Trek, has proven to be iconic in the world of American television. So too does The Wrath of Khan hold an enduring impact for bringing the best of Star Trek onto the silver screen. Leonard Nimoy’s role as Mr. Spock has become lauded within the annals of science-fiction. Of course, Spock’s place in Wrath of Khan is particularly famous, including a heartfelt moment where he utters, “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” Of course, none of this is to diminish the superb cast of the USS Enterprise, played by William Shatner, Deforest Kelley, George Takei, James Doohan, Walter Koening, and Nichelle Nichols. Though few stick out as well as the fearsome Khan himself, portrayed viciously by Ricardo Montalban.\n\n14. Jason and the Argonauts (1963)\n\nThis work is a marvel of Ray Harryhausen’s spectacular stop-motion effects, from the many headed Hydra to the army of skeletons.\n\n15. Carrie (1977)\n\nBased on Stephen King’s debut novel of the same name, Brian DePalma’s horrifying adaptation has helped launch King’s narrative into a popular myth of contemporary America’s culture. Carrie touches a nerve in many, the social outcast with an unappreciated talent. The horror film has particularly haunting performances by Piper Laurie, as Carrie’s fundamentalist mother, and Sissy Spacek, whose portrays our conflicted protagonist’s spiral into madness. Both of whom were nominated for Oscars, a rarity among horror films today.\n\n16. The Blues Accordin’ To Lightning Hopkins (1968)\n\nLightning Hopkins is considered one of America’s finest guitarists, and Les Blanc’s documentary shows just why. Blues is an integral part of our cultural history and Hopkins plays with an emotional understanding of this fact. Throughout we see the impact of his music on ordinary people. The Blues Accordin’ To Lightning Hopkins has been added to the Criterion Collection\n\n17. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001)\n\nHarry Potter launched from a bestselling book series and into a global phenomenon. This influence was felt no less by film. The inaugural entry into the popular film series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, was successful in creating Hogwarts, the fantasy world where goblins run banks, sports are run on broomsticks, and chess pieces can run you over. Harry Potter also provided America with a showcase of Britain’s best talent, from Alan Rickman to Richard Harris to Maggie Smith, as well as catapult for bringing fantasy novels and young adult fiction onto the silver screen.\n\n18. Fight Club (1999)\n\nBased on the equally controversial book by Chuck Palaniuk, David Fincher’s Fight Club is a film that examines masculinity, consumerism, and meaning in a changing society. Edward Norton plays the unassuming narrator, whose directionless life is given an injection of adrenaline by the wild Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. Tyler starts a fight club, which allows men to fight out their aggression, within various rules, of course. The first rule of Fight Club being that you cannot talk about it. Fight Club is a dual image, both a condemnation and a celebration of our twisted society, along with the men who reside in it.\n\n19. Batman (1989)\n\nBatman, along with Superman, Wonder Woman, or Spiderman, is one of the most iconic superheroes in American comics. Tim Burton’s adaptation of the character in 1989 is considered, alongside Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, one of the definitive interpretations of Batman on film. The film was successful in returning Batman to his darker origins from his campy image on the Adam West show. The movie is a showcase of talent: Tim Burton’s artistic use of sets, models, and lighting, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson’s performances in the leading roles, Danny Elfman’s sweeping score, and Prince’s pop additions. Batman would go on to define the character, and superhero films for the years to come.\n\n20. Mulholland Dr. (2001)\n\nDavid Lynch’s magnum opus, and one of the most acclaimed and divisive films of 2001, Mulholland Dr. was directed in pure Lynchian style: obscure, enigmatic, strange, thoughtful, ambiguous, and addictive. The film explores identity, desire, dreams, and the many faces of Hollywood. Much like Sunset Boulevard, Lynch’s Mulholland Dr. is as much a critique of the Hollywood system as it is a celebration of it. The film is also among the first to start the craze of Internet forums and websites analyzing and interpreting movies of this kind. Mulholland Dr. is also one of the few films from the 2000’s that came of BFI’s Sight and Sound poll for greatest films of all time.\n\n21–24. The Mind’s Eye (film series) (1990–1996)\n\n4 films:\n\n- “The Mind’s Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey” (1990)\n\n— “Beyond the Mind’s Eye” (1992)\n\n— “The Gate to the Mind’s Eye” (1994)\n\n— “Odyssey into the Mind’s Eye” (1996)\n\nIn the past, the NFR has recognized the relevance of computer animated films, having previously selected Toy Story, Luxo Jr, Tin Toy, and The Computer Animated Hand for preservation. The experimental Mind’s Eye films made by Odyssey Productions pushed the technological boundaries of computer animation at a time when it was still a novel device. The films have found a new life in the vaporwave genre of music, which often recycles images from these shorts to express the aesthetic of 1990’s computer technology.\n\n25. The Secret of NIMH (1982)\n\nWhile Disney floundered throughout the 1980’s, former Disney animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman filled the gap in quality cartoon films. The best of these works was Bluth’s magnum opus The Secret of NIMH, based on the book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH by Robert O’Brien. NIMH stands above many other animated features, in that it has a subtlety and adult sensibility that is often left by the wayside in children’s entertainment. It also carries a female protagonist in the lead who has no special powers or alluring beauty, but simply seeks to save her home.\n\n26. The Color Purple (1985)\n\nBased on the critically acclaimed novel by Alice Walker, the film, directed by Steven Spielberg, provides an important lens into an area of American history, particularly the struggles of African-American women in the early 1920’s, who had to deal with racism, poverty, and sexism, as seen through the eyes of Celie, a woman who takes a slow odyssey of liberation from her abusive husband. The film is also a grand showcase of African-American talents, Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar, and Oprah Winfrey. The Color Purple was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress In A Leading Role, and Best Actress In A Supporting Role. Film critic Roger Ebert added it to his Great Movies list.\n\n27. The Truman Show (1988)\n\nOne of Jim Carrey’s most acclaimed films, which is about a man whose entire life is a well-constructed television show, but he’s the only one who does not know it. The film satirizes and questions the utopian concept of the “American Dream”, like The Matrix, examines the concept of simulated reality, and like Network, examined the endless shock factor of burgeoning reality television.\n\n28. Pleasantville (1998)\n\nA clever tribute as well as parody of the black and white sitcoms that were popular during the 1950’s. The film features two 90’s teenagers who enter the world of the fictional 1950’s television show, “Pleasantville”, and come face to face with the ideals that America projected onto the screen, and see their strengths as well as shortcomings. The film also examines the conflict between the culture of that era and the culture of the later decades, through art, music, literature, and sex. This is mainly achieved through the film’s mixture of black-and-white and color visuals. The film also stars the late Don Knotts of The Andy Griffith Show as a guiding force.\n\n29. WarGames (1983)\n\nOne of the first films to accurately portray hacker culture to a mass audience, WarGames also examines the strategy of “mutually assured destruction” and the growing roles of computers and artificial intelligence in governmental affairs.\n\n30. The Crow (1994)\n\nAlex Proyas’s film adaptation brought to life James O’Barr’s gritty comic book that features the resurrection of Eric Draven, a rock musician who seeks to avenge the rape and murder of his fiance. The film is foremost the last, and perhaps best performance of Brandon Lee, who died during the production of the film, just as he began to emerge from his father’s shadow. The film’s creative special effects echo the minaturesque macabre of Tim Burton’s Batman, and the dystopian hell of Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. Also, keeping in the theme of Draven’s former role as a rock musician, The Crow also serves as a showcase of some of the 90’s most popular rock groups, from The Cure to The Stone Temple Pilots.\n\n31. Crumb (1994)\n\nA documentary which examines the strange and obscene lifestyle of one of America’s most famous underground cartoonists, Robert R. Crumb. Through the film, we see his legacy through creations such as Fritz The Cat, Mr. Natural, Keep On Truckin’, and his album cover for Big Brother and the Holding Company’s Cheap Thrills, as well as the grotesque and pornographic side of American cartoons never explored through the films of either Disney or Warner Bros. In the film, we also see the broken lives of Crumb and as his brothers as they struggle with loneliness and depression, and how for Crumb, cartooning provided him a unique escape.\n\n32. Lake Of Fire (2006)\n\nAbortion, alongside gun control, remains one of the most divisive topics in American politics, with a comfortable resolution yet in sight. Through this 152 minute documentary, filmed over 16 years, and costing $8 million dollars, director Tony Kaye allows for all points of view from across the political, religious, legal, medical, and philosophical spectrum to be heard, without editing or judgement. The film examines the pro-life movement, the murders of abortion doctors, the pro-choice movement, and shows us two actual abortion procedures. Among those interviewed include Norma McCorvey, Noam Chomsky, Peter Singer, Alan Dershowitz, Nat Hentoff, and most importantly, the women who have been directly affected. The film is shot in black, white, and shades of grey, reflecting, perhaps, the various perspectives.\n\n33. Mutiny On The Bounty (1935)\n\nConsidered by many to be finest film on the true Bounty mutiny, if not the most historically accurate, is the most influential in shaping the popular perception of what occurred during the incident. Most notably framing Christian Fletcher (Clark Gable) as righteous and Captain William Bligh (Charles Laughton) as sadistic. For their convincing roles, Gable, Laughton, and Franchot Tone, were all nominated for the Oscar of Best Actor that year, with none of them winning. Mutiny did, however, win the Oscar for Best Picture. The American Film Institute has listed it as the 86th greatest film of all time, and Laughton’s depiction of Captain Bligh as the 19th greatest villain of all time.\n\n34. Boogie Nights (1997)\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights is one of the few dramas to depict the Golden Age of Pornography in American cinema, and as well as one of the few to humanize pornographic filmmakers, producers, actors, and actresses as people. With its ensemble talent of Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Don Cheadle, John C. Reiliy, William H. Macy, Heather Graham, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, and Alfred Molina. Through the film we see the behind the scenes of how pornographic films were made, their near-mainstream popularity, the effects of the rise of home video, and the discrimination these people faced, and indeed, still do face, for their work. The film also has cameo appearances from Golden Age porn stars Nina Hartley and Veronica Hart.\n\n35. Inherit The Wind (1960)\n\nInspired by the famous Scopes Monkey Trial, which to many Americans symbolized the conflict between scientific progress and religious fundamentalism, the film is a rarity, as it acutely and boldly explores questions of faith, education, and fraud. At the center of the film are powerful performances from Spencer Tracy, Gene Kelly, and Fredric March, all playing characters inspired by the American icons, Clarence Darrow, H.L. Mencken, and William Jennings Bryan. Film critic Roger Ebert added Inherit The Wind to his Great Movies list.\n\n36. Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? (1962)\n\nThe only film where Joan Crawford and Bette Davis share the same screen. The film like Sunset Boulevard, is an examination of old stars who no longer fit into a changed Hollywood, as well as a popular representation of the infamous rivalry between the two leading actresses. The film launched the psycho biddy sub-genre of horror, garnered Davis an Oscar nominee for Best Actress, won an Oscar for Best Costume Design (Black and White), and helped to further establish Davis and Crawford as LGBT icons adopted by many drag performers. Indeed, the film the egos behind it have gone into popular myth, most recently examined by the acclaimed FX series Feud: Bette and Joan. The American Film Institute listed the movie as the 63rd greatest thriller and Davis’s depiction of Baby Jane Hudson as the 44th best villain in cinema. Film critic Roger Ebert added Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? to his Great Movies list.\n\n37. Scarface (1983)\n\nBrian De Palma’s controversial remake of Howard Hawk’s 1932 mob film. Scarface is the story of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban refugee from the Mariel boatlift who rises to great wealth through his involvement in cocaine trafficking. Much like Bonnie and Clyde, the film pushed the limits of violence that could be shown on screen. The script, written by Oliver Stone, it both a critique of the American Dream as well as the War On Drugs. The film launched the career of actress Michelle Pfeiffer, and made Montana an icon for rap and hip-hop artists. The American Film Institute listed it as the 10th greatest gangster film of all time, and film critic Roger Ebert added it to his Great Movies list.\n\n38. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nConceived by Tim Burton and directed by Henry Selick, The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the signature stop-motion animation films, which carries elements of both Christmas and Halloween, and is an effective tale for both holidays. Drawing from the German Expressionist movement, the film is a great palette of Tim Burton’s creativity, Danny Elfman’s musical talents, and Henry Selick’s attention to detail. The Nightmare Before Christmas has gone on to become a seminal part of America’s gothic subculture.\n\n39. Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906)\n\nJames Stuart Blackman’s three minute short carries the unique significance of being the first animated film. An important landmark in the history of animation.\n\n40. Bambi Meets Godzilla (1969)\n\nOne of the most famous student films of all time, that features a brief, but humorous, encounter between Bambi and Godzilla. Created by Marv Newman, it reveals the creative skills of one who can make a memorable joke with limited resources. Animation historian Jeff Back listed it as one the greatest animated shorts of all time. Bambi Meets Godzilla was also preserved by the Academy Film Archive,\n\n41. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987)\n\nRegarded as the best as most popular Thanksgiving film, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles signified a shift in John Hughes’s direction from movies about teens to those about adults. The film also portrays the ranging comedic talents of John Candy and Steve Martin. Film critic Roger Ebert added the movie to his Great Movies list.\n\n42. Strangers On A Train (1951)\n\nAlfred’s Hitchcock’s thriller, which like North By Northwest, portrays an innocent man caught up in an extraordinary situation. In this case, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), who tempts the young tennis player with a murder. Strangers On A Train is probably the best portrayal of Walker’s acting talents, as the seductive and sexually ambiguous Bruno. The film also shows Hitchcock’s ability to translate thrills through unusual situations, from a tennis match to a carousel. The American Film Institute listed Strangers On A Train as the 32nd greatest thriller of all time.\n\n43. The Sixth Sense (1999)\n\nThe debut film of director M. Night Shaymalan, which remains his most famous and critically acclaimed work. Drawing upon elements of Hitchcockian thriller and the Twilight Zone, Shyamalan crafts a sentimental tale of death and the afterlife. The film established Shyamalan as a director of thrillers, particularly those with twist endings, and launched the career of child actor Haley Joel Osment. The Sixth Sense was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and the American Film Institute listed it as the 60th greatest thriller of all time, and in 2007, the 89th greatest movie of all time. The Writers Guild of America listed its screenplay as the 50th best of all time.\n\n44. The Dark Knight (2008)\n\nHighly regarded as one of the greatest films in the superhero genre, The Dark Knight brought the classic American characters of Batman and the Joker into the modern era. What many consider the high point of Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight Trilogy”, the films deals with matters of justice, morality, and heroic symbolism, all with the nuance of a post-9/11 world. The film is also fondly remembered for Heath Ledger’s chilling performance as The Joker, which earned him as posthumous Oscar.\n\n45. The Haunting (1963)\n\nBased on Shirley Jackson’s classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House, and adapted by Sound Of Music and West Side Story director Robert Wise, this film is about four people who enter into a house that is believed to be haunted. The Haunting is skilled in ambiguity, as the ghosts are never shown, and the black-and-white cinematography adds a menacing air to the house, a demonstration most evident in the notable staircase sequence. The film is also bold in its addition of the lesbian character Theodora, whose lesbianism while not explicitly stated, added a nuanced and sensual LGBT representation in the film. The Haunting is also the standout performance of Julie Harris as a psychologically fragile Eleanor who is driven mentally insane.\n\n46. Somewhere In Time (1980)\n\nBased on the romance novel Bid Time Return by I Am Legend novelist Richard Mattheson, the film stars Christopher Reeve, who goes back in time to meet his love Elise, played by Jane Seymour. It is also the first and only movie to be filmed almost entirely on Michigan’s Mackinac Island, and a treasured visual representation of that land. While met with lukewarm reviews in theaters, the film earned a a strong fanbase after its replays on cable television and the resonance of John Barry’s musical score. Activism from the fanbase helped lead to both Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour earning stars on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, and the annual “Somewhere In Time Weekend” at Mackinac, where fans dress up as characters from the film.\n\n47. Lonely Are the Brave (1962)\n\nA film that Kirk Douglas himself regards as his best, Lonely Are the Brave belongs alongside Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven and John Ford’s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance! as a mediation on the death of cowboy lifestyle. The films stars Douglas as a cowboy on the lam, and with a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, it could be interpreted, like Spartacus, as a statement on the McCarthy era.\n\n48. The Blues Brothers (1980)\n\nDirected by Animal House’s John Landis, The Blues Brothers marked the first film adaptation of Saturday Night Live sketch. The film stars John Belushi and Dan Akroyd as retired blues musicians out on a “mission from God” to bring their band back together, and raise enough money to keep their orphanage afloat. In addition to the hilarious acting and the spectacular car crashes, the film also stands as a powerful tribute to the blues genre, with musical appearances by legends James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, and Aretha Franklin.\n\n49. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923)\n\nThe first major American film adaptation of Victor Hugo’s novel which launched the iconic Universal Monsters series. In this silent picture, the hunchback Quasimodo, is played by Lon Chaney Sr. in his famously fearsome makeup. This film along with The Phantom of the Opera helped establish Chaney as an icon of American cinema and was one of Universal’s most successful silent films."
