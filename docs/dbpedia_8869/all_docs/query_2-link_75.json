        "text": "The National Film Registry has grown to include 725 films this year with the addition this week of 25 films. In accordance with the National Film Preservation Act, a film is eligible to be preserved under the registry if it is at least a decade old and recognized in the National Film Preservation Board’s view as “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” The Librarian of Congress makes the final determination, considering public nominations in the analysis.\n\nConsistent with last year’s list, which added The Princess Bride and The Birds, the new list includes some of the best genre films of all-time: one of cinema’s best fantasies and baseball films, Phil Alden Robinson’s magical Field of Dreams, Walt Disney’s timeless animated film Dumbo, the greatest superhero film of all-time–Superman, a 1980s classic–The Goonies, and your second favorite Christmas movie, Die Hard. The only surprise with some inductees was simply that they hadn’t been added yet to the Registry, like Elia Kazan’s memorable look at prejudice, Gentleman’s Agreement, the original Hepburn/Tracy/Poitier drama Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, the Ritchie Valens biopic La Bamba, Stanley Kubrick’s Spartacus, and the 11-Oscar triumph, James Cameron’s Titanic.\n\nRichard Donner, who directed two films on this year’s list, Superman and The Goonies, said, “They are both special films in my life, as was the cast and crew for both. It’s wonderful to see them listed among so many great films.” Kirk Douglas, who celebrated his 101st birthday this past week, starred in two films, Spartacus, and the 1951 film Ace in the Hole.\n\nBelow is the full list of films named to the registry for 2017:\n\nAce in the Hole (aka Big Carnival) (1951)\n\nBoulevard Nights (1979)\n\nDie Hard (1988)\n\nDumbo (1941)\n\nField of Dreams (1989)\n\n4 Little Girls (1997)\n\nFuentes Family Home Movies Collection (1920s and 1930s)\n\nGentleman’s Agreement (1947)\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967)\n\nHe Who Gets Slapped (1924)\n\nInterior New York Subway, 14th Street to 42nd Street (1905)\n\nLa Bamba (1987)\n\nLives of Performers (1972)\n\nMemento (2000)\n\nOnly Angels Have Wings (1939)\n\nThe Sinking of the Lusitania (1918)\n\nSpartacus (1960)\n\nSuperman (1978)\n\nThelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser (1988)\n\nTime and Dreams (1976)\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nTo Sleep with Anger (1990)\n\nWanda (1971)\n\nWith the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain (1937-1938)\n\nThe entire list, which began in 1989, can be found here."
