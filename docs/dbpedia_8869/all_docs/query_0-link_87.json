        "text": "The legendary neo-noir film Chinatown comes to 4K UHD for the first time this summer.\n\n“Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.”\n\nSo ends a film that is widely recognized as one of the greatest in cinema history. The haunting noir classic CHINATOWN celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and Paramount is marking the occasion with a Limited-Edition 4K Ultra HD release on June 18, 2024.\n\nProduced by the legendary Robert Evans, CHINATOWN was originally released on June 26, 1974 and received widespread critical acclaim along with 11 Oscar® nominations, including Best Picture. In 1991, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.”\n\nRobert Towne’s brilliant Academy Award®-winning screenplay weaves a tragic and shocking tale of corruption, greed, and the human propensity for evil. Powerhouse performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston, a riveting story inspired by real events, vivid imagery, and a stirring score combine to make an unforgettable film that is essential for every cinephile’s collection.\n\nThe Limited-Edition Paramount Presents release includes the restored film on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc™ for the first time ever. The exacting restoration was completed using the original camera negative, which was repaired using the latest technology in areas that had been previously damaged. The result is a sparkling 4K Ultra HD presentation that uses more of the best possible source than previous masters and faithfully captures the film’s distinctively dreamy and simultaneously realistic look.\n\nIn addition, this release includes extensive new and legacy bonus content (see below), access to a Digital copy of the film, and a bonus Blu-ray™ with the 1990 sequel The Two Jakes, directed by and starring Jack Nicholson and written by Robert Towne.\n\nNew bonus content is detailed below:\n\nA State of Mind: Author Sam Wasson On Chinatown – Sam Wasson, film historian and bestselling author of The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years Of Hollywood, on the importance of the film and its legacy.\n\nChinatown Memories – Legendary producer Hawk Koch shares stories from his time as assistant director on the film.\n\nThe Trilogy That Never Was – Sam Wasson discusses the planned third installment of what would have been a trio of movies featuring the character Jake Gittes.\n\nAdditional legacy bonus content:\n\nCommentary by screenwriter Robert Towne with David Fincher\n\nWater and Power\n\nThe Aqueduct\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nThe River & Beyond\n\nChinatown: An Appreciation\n\nChinatown: The Beginning and the End\n\nChinatown: Filming\n\nChinatown: Legacy\n\nTheatrical Trailer"
