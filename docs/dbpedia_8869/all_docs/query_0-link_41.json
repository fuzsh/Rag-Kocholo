Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer [MGM], Circa 1923. Vintage reference photograph of the cast, crew, and onlookers from the set of the 1925 film. Mimeo snipe and annotations in manuscript ink on verso.\n\nBased on the 1899 novel \"McTeague\" by Frank Norris. An impoverished miner-turned-dentist wins the lottery, but the ensuing fortune threatens to ruin the lives of everyone it touches. Director Erich von Stroheim's masterpiece, one of the first films to be shot entirely on location, in San Francisco and Death Valley, using (what were then considered) sophisticated and relatively new filming techniques, such as montage editing and deep focus.\n\nStroheim's first cut of the film was a mammoth, 9.5 hour presentation, edited down to two and a half hours against his wishes. All that survives today is a restored, slightly choppy but coherent 240-minute version, supplanted with still photographs, that conveys to the viewer the unimaginable grandeur of the original.\n\n8 x 10 inches. Very Good plus, with a small closed tear in bottom margin and faint creasing.\n\nNational Film Registry. Ebert I. Godard, Histoire(s) du cinema. Rosenbaum 1000.\n\n[Book #151959]"
