Rebellion,” i.e. the independent cinema made at UCLA by students of color in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, Passing Through follows a jazz musician’s struggle against the recording industry while in search of a “sound” that would reconcile his personal artistic vision with the sensibility of his community and the political urgencies of his highly repressive historical moment. It is a film that reflects on the political potential of the forms of sociality that coalesce around the jazz ensemble and on free jazz as a form of political praxis.” -March 11, 2022\n\n– read more on liquidblackness.com – read more on Listening to images; regarding the screening on March 25~28, 2021\n\nCUTTING HORSE, 2000\n\nIn the old west range wars raged between cattlemen and sheep herders, between ranchers and homesteaders.\n\nCUTTING HORSE, is a modern day western about a legendary horseman named, Tyler who returns home after ten years of drifting only to find his uncle, Doc Pete, and his old friend Sanchez besieged with a host of problems having to do with greed and desire, as they struggle against the obsessions of a powerful California horse breeding family.

The film opens in 1945 with a young boy playing in his Chicago neighborhood and then follows the adult Jita-Hadi as a returning Marine with heightened political consciousness. Like The Spook Who Sat By the Door and Gordon’s War, As Above, So Below imagines a post-Watts rebellion state of siege and an organized Black underground plotting revolution. With sound excerpts from the 1968 HUAC report “Guerrilla Warfare Advocates in the United States,” As Above, So Below is one of the more politically radical films of the L.A. Rebellion. ” —Allyson Nadia Field\n\n– read more on LA Film and Television Archive\n\n– Watch Larry Clark interviewed by Ernst Hardy – UCLA presentation\n\nREVIEWS\n\nThe Guardian (London)\n\nMuseum Screening (partial list)\n\nTate Modern, London\n\nPompidou center, Paris France\n\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York City\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City\n\nGaleries Contemporaines des Musees de Marseille, France\n\nNewark Museum, New Jersey\n\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art\n\nLos Angeles County Art Museum\n\nSt. Louis Art Museum\n\nLos Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art\n\nHammer Museum, Los Angeles\n\nNew York Museum of Art and Design\n\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n\nThe Vienna Austria Film Museum, Austria\n\nMuseo Reina Sofia, Spain\n\nFilmoteca, Spain\n\nParis Cinema Tech, France\n\nEye Film Museum, Holland"
