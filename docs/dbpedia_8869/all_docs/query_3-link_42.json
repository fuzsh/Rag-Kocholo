        "text": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello LinkedIn Community! I'm Alexei, from now on, I will start sharing my thoughts and recommendations here. Every Saturday, I plan to recommend films that have left a lasting impression on me. ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation: The Devil's Advocate Today I want to recommend, one of my favorite movies - \"The Devil's Advocate\", 1997. For this role, Al Pacino received the MTV Award - Best Villain. From my point of view, this is probably the best acting of the devil that Al Pacino has done, and really, the best acting throughout all his movies. Years ago, I watched this movie not in the original version, but now it's an incredible experience to watch his dialogues in original English - the translation can't capture the full power and intonation of Pacino's devil. The filmmakers clearly feared neither God nor the devil in their work on this film. Those who watched it, already know it, and those who have not watched it - just watch it. I first saw the film back in 1998, thinking it was an action movie, but I watched it in one breath, and the main phrase of this film has remained in my memory for the rest of my life. This phrase was uttered by the devil with a smile at the end of the film when it seemed that God had finally and irrevocably defeated Evil: \"Vanity... definitely is my favorite sin\" And it became clear that nothing was over, and the struggle between God and Evil would continue in the next round. The film is excellent from every perspective, and I believe everyone should watch it. As a mystical thriller, it's quite good, and Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino are fantastic together in this film. How to watch it? Watch it alone or with someone with whom you have already watched mystical thrillers before. As an addition, I would recommend taking cognac, a very good cognac, 50 grams, from which in the right glass you will drink during the entire film. Sometimes there will be magical overlaps between the taste of cognac and the plot lines of the film. #MovieRecommendation #AlPacino #TheDevilsAdvocate #WeekendVibes #CinematicMasterpiece\n\n\"The Passion of the Christ,\" is a 2004 American epic biblical drama film produced, directed, and co-written by Mel Gibson. It stars Jim Caviezel as Jesus of Nazareth and offers a vivid portrayal of the final 12 hours of the life of Jesus Christ. Financed independently by Gibson, the film stands out for its commitment to linguistic authenticity, as it unfolds in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin, the languages believed to have been spoken during Jesus's time. However, this decision, along with the film's graphic depiction of violence, particularly during the crucifixion scenes, sparked controversy and criticism even before its release. The intense focus on the physical and emotional suffering endured by Jesus during his final hours is a defining aspect of the film. This unflinching portrayal aims to convey the brutality of the historical event. Despite controversies, \"The Passion of the Christ found resonance among religious audiences, especially Christians, who appreciated its emphasis on the themes of sacrifice and redemption central to Christian theology. The film grossed over $612 million worldwide and became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2004 internationally at the end of its theatrical run. It is the highest-grossing (inflation unadjusted) Christian film of all time, as well as being the highest-grossing independent film of all time. As of 2023, it is the highest-grossing R-rated film in the U.S., with $370.8 million. It received three nominations at the 77th Academy Awards in 2005, for Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score. A sequel centred on the resurrection of Jesus is in development. #HistoryVille #Fact #History #Oplum #Christ #ThePassionOfTheChrist #Film #MelGibson\n\nFILM REVIEWS - 'The Parade Movie Guy' HORIZON: AN AMERICAN SAGA - CHAPTER 1 Recently, I was invited to be the exclusive Film Reviewer for 'The Parade Cinema' in Marlborough, West England, under the alias, 'The Parade Movie Guy'.

A. https://lnkd.in/eHPiCtw3 ************ HORIZON: AN AMERICAN SAGA â€“ CHAPTER 1 **** My concern before seeing HORIZON: AN AMERICAN SAGA â€“ CHAPTER 1 was would there be enough in the first movie to propel me to see PART 2? The answer â€“ YES! In fact, my wish is that PART 2 is playing next week. This is the effect of the profound brilliance and artistry of HORIZON: CHAPTER 1. And the movie is long â€“ three hours â€“ but none of it drags, though some of the pace is patiently placed.
