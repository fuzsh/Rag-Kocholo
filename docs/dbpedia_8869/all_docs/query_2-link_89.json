        "text": "One of the fascinating things about our genre of choice is that it began with books, and then spread throughout every other medium. We, as the world’s most prominent scifi radio station, tend to focus on visual media because the rest of the entertainment world does, and so we note with great interest when films in our genre achieve exalted status.\n\nEvery year, the National Film Registry announces twenty-five films worthy of preservation and commemoration. This year, the National Film Registry chose as movies that were culturally, historically and/or aesthetically significant: seven movies directed by People of Color and nine films directed by women.\n\n“The National Film Registry is an important record of American history, culture and creativity, captured through one of the great American art forms, our cinematic experience,” Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in a statement. “With the inclusion of diverse filmmakers, we are not trying to set records but rather to set the record straight by spotlighting the astonishing contributions women and people of color have made to American cinema despite facing often-overwhelming hurdles.”\n\nThe twenty-five films judged worthy to be preserved for future generations include silent movies, musicals, superhero films, war pictures, documentaries, comedies, and dramas. The stars whom are great-grandchildren on Martian colonies will have access to include Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Jeremy Renner, Sidney Poitier, Frank Sinatra, Dan Ackroyd, Malcolm McDowell, and Jim Belushi.\n\nSuspense (1913) directed by Lois Weber and Phillips Smalley. starring Lois Weber and Valentine Paul.\n\nKid Auto Races at Venice (1914) directed by Henry Lehrman, starring Charlie Chaplin in the debut of his Little Tramp character.\n\nBread (1918) written and directed by Ida May Park.\n\nThe Battle of the Century (1927) directed by Clyde Bruckman, starring Laurel & Hardy, and featuring a truly epic pie fight.\n\nWith Car and Camera Around the World (1929), directed by and starring Aloha Wanderwell, a documentary by and about the first woman to travel around the world by automobile.\n\nCabin in the Sky (1943) directed by Vicente Minelli and Busby Berkeley, starring an all African-American cast.\n\nOutrage (1950) directed by Ida Lupino, starring Mala Powers and Tod Andrews.\n\nThe Man with the Golden Arm (1955) directed by Otto Preminger, starring Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak (Bell, Book, and Candle)\n\nLilies of the Field(1963) directed by Ralph Nelson, starring Sidney Poitier and Lilia Skala.\n\nA Clockwork Orange (1971) directed by Stanley Kubrick, starring Malcolm McDowell.\n\nSweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song (1971), written, directed by, and starring Melvin Van Peebles.\n\nWattstax (1973) directed by Mel Stewart, a music documentary.\n\nGrease (1978) directed by Randal Kleiser, starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.\n\nThe Blues Brothers (1980) directed by John Landis, starring Jim Belushi and Dan Ackroyd as two musicians on “a mission from God.”\n\nIllusions (1982) written and directed by Julie Dash, starring Lonette McKee.\n\nLosing Ground (1982) written and directed by Kathleen Collins, starring Seret Scott and Bill Gunn.\n\nThe Joy Luck Club (1993) directed by Wayne Wang and starring France Nuyen (Elaan of Troyius in Star Trek:TOS), Tamlyn Tomita (Babylon 5, Eureka, Heroes, Teen Wolf, Star Trek: Picard), Rosalind Chao (Keiko in ST: DS9 & ST: TNG), and Ming-Na Wen (Agents of SHIELD, Mulan, The Mandalorian).\n\nThe Ground (1993-2001) directed by Robert Beavers.

The librarian confers with members of the National Film Preservation Board and others before making the selections. Also considered this year were more than 5,500 titles nominated by the public.” Thus far 800 movies have been listed on the National Film Registry. People Magazine pointed out “The National Film Registry’s list for 2020 includes a record number of female directors.” It appears that there were more female directors in the early days of Hollywood than there are now.\n\nLibrarian of Congress Carla Hayden announced this year’s films on Monday, 12/15/2020 CE. She said, “The National Film Registry is an important record of American history, culture and creativity, captured through one of the great American art forms, our cinematic experience… With the inclusion of diverse filmmakers, we are not trying to set records but rather to set the record straight by spotlighting the astonishing contributions women and people of color have made to American cinema, despite facing often-overwhelming hurdles.”\n\nHow many of these movies have you seen? Do you agree or disagree that they are “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant”? Which movies would you nominate in their stead?
