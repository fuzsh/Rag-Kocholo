        "text": "The Slide Mountain Lookout Trail isn't near many other hikes and is a bit of a trek to get to, but it is well worth the effort. The hike is unique in a lot of ways. First, you'll hike through the dramatic Piru Gorge, but you'll do it on an abandoned highway, giving the stretch a surreal post-apocalyptic feel. Then you'll sweat as you climb over 2000 feet on dirt trails toward the summit. Along the way, you'll get spectacular views into the rugged backcountry of the Sespe Wilderness. At the top is a fire lookout, manned by volunteers and only accessible by hiking.\n\nIn this Guide:\n\nVideo and Turn-by-Turn Directions to Slide Mountain Lookout\n\nWhere to Park for the Slide Mountain Lookout Hike\n\nInsider Tips & Recommendations\n\nThis is one of the only hikes where you start in Angeles National Forest and end in Los Padres National Forest.\n\nWhere is Slide Mountain Lookout?\n\nThis hike starts in the northwest section of Angeles National Forest, off I-5 when you head north out of the LA area. You'll be sharing the trailhead with anglers who are visiting Piru Creek. Use this trailhead address:\n\nFrenchmans Flat Campground, Castaic, CA 91384\n\nBecause there are toilets here, you need to display a parking pass. I use my National Parks pass, and you can also use an Adventure Pass.\n\nGear For the Hike\n\nYou can go with your standard hiking gear here, there are no curve balls. I found that I even had 5G cell reception for most of the hike. The hike is exposed and can get hot in the summer, bring 2-3L of water. You'll also want to bring some insect repellant. The ideal time to visit in in the cooler and windier months when the insects and heat are not an issue.\n\nGear That I Love Right Now\n\nNothing is sponsored or promoted, just the actual gear that I use.\n\nGarmin InReach Mini 2Hit SOS or just tell loved ones that you're running late where your cell phone has no service. Review here.\n\nTopo Pursuit 2The best hiking footwear I've ever owned. No blisters. Get them wet, they dry quickly. Lots of cushion and comfort.\n\nGarmin Epix ProHiking maps, route info, and fitness stats on my wrist. Review here.\n\nOsprey Hikelite 26Lightweight, carries all your gear, and your back doesn't get sweaty. Oh yea, it's also one of the most inexpensive packs you can get.\n\nCheck out the complete list here. ( Updated August 2024)\n\nSlide Mountain Trail Maps\n\nClick Here To View\n\nElevation Profile\n\n3D Map\n\nHike Brief\n\nBefore there was I-5, there was US-99, the north-south route up the west coast that was as iconic as Route 66. This hike starts along this road, first built in 1915, and widened to what you see today in 1951, then abandoned in the 1960s when the nearby \"ridge route\" of I-5 was opened.\n\nThe dramatic and layered rock formations result from movement along the San Gabriel Fault, which loosely follows the same route as the road.\n\nThe road also follows Piru Creek (native Tataviam word for the reeds that grow along the creek), a popular fishing spot. The creek by Frenchmans Flat is stocked with rainbow trout each year.\n\nWhen US-99 was closed, Piru Creek was dammed and Pyramid Lake was created in 1972, which also submerged portions of US-99. Today Pyramid Lake is a recreation area and reservoir.\n\nThe Slide Mountain Fire Tower was built in 1969 when Pyramid Lake was being constructed. Today it's on the National Historic Fire Lookout Register and is manned by volunteers during fire season. Volunteers usually spend 1-2 days per month at the tower. And if there's a volunteer there, they'll sometimes let you visit the inside of the tower.\n\nSlide Mountain Lookout Hike Directions\n\nKeep your ears open for the occasional utility vehicle driving on the road.\n\nThe creek is officially designated as the Piru Creek Wild & Scenic River, a protected area since 2009.\n\nThe Sespe Wilderness, created in 1992, includes the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, which is off-limits to humans. I've seen condor on this hike, keep your eyes open, and maybe you will too.\n\nFrom here, just head back the way you came up.\n\nNeed More Info?\n\nHave a question about the guide? Join my Patreon and ask me a question.\n\nWhen planning, always check the park website and social media to make sure the trails are open. Similarly, check the weather and road conditions.\n\nDo you have an update to this guide? View the Youtube comments for this video. Leave a comment and I will do my best to update the guide.\n\nThis Guide Was Written by Cris Hazzard\n\nHi, I'm Cris Hazzard, aka Hiking Guy, a professional outdoors guide, hiking expert, and author based in Southern California. I created this website to share all the great hikes I do with everyone else out there. This site is different because it gives detailed directions that even the beginning hiker can follow. I also share what hiking gear works and doesn't so you don't waste money. I don't do sponsored or promoted content; I share only the gear recommendations, hikes, and tips that I would with my family and friends. If you like the website and YouTube channel, please support these free guides (I couldn't do it without folks like you!). You can stay up to date with my new guides by following me on YouTube, Instagram, or by subscribing to my monthly newsletter.\n\nPrivacy Policy - Terms of Use - Contact - Guided Hikes - Sitemap - Newsletter - Media Expert\n\nRead This Before Hiking With These Guides\n\nThis information provided by HikingGuy.com is presented as a public service to those wishing to enjoy the outdoors.
