        "text": "One of the world’s most thrilling cantilever glass bridges is at Grand Canyon West. You can step out on the 10-foot wide, horseshoe-shaped glass bridge extending 70 feet out over the rim of the Grand Canyon. If you dare to look down, you’ll see breathtaking views 4,000 feet to the Canyon floor below.\n\nThere’s simply nothing compared to the feeling of walking on air, yet there’s no need to be nervous — Skywalk is strong enough to hold seventy fully loaded 747 passenger jets.\n\nSkywalk\n\nin the making\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Skywalk opened to the general public. This $30 million modern engineering marvel took four years to build. At that time, Skywalk was the world’s biggest glass cantilever bridge at 70 feet (China’s walkway in Chongqing took that title in 2016 by extending 87.5 feet).\n\nConstruction began on this one-of-a-kind glass-bottom bridge in 2004. Engineers employed the same rod and plate method used on the Egyptian pyramids to roll Skywalk out over the Grand Canyon’s edge, creating an unencumbered view from the bridge. Support beams formed the foundation by anchoring deep within the red limestone bedrock of the site, acting as counterweight rods. This allows Skywalk to extend over the canyon’s edge with no direct support from underneath.\n\nHighly skilled craftsman used 1.2 million pounds of steel and glass to build the Skywalk, using glass units that can hold up to 800 people at any given time. The glass bridge can withstand an 8.0 magnitude earthquake, wind speeds up to 100 miles per hour, and can support the weight of seventy-one 747 airplanes. Since its opening, the world-famous structure has welcomed more than 10 million visitors to experience a bird’s eye view of the Grand Canyon."
