        "text": "We began our day with a trip to the visitor center to fill up on water and information. After stamping our National Park Passports we decided on what trail would be the day’s hike. We would climb just over 10 miles in total to reach Shadow Mountain Fire Lookout in order to have the views of Grand and Shadow Mountain Lakes.\n\nAll in all, our hike took us about 5 hours to complete. Once we reached the bottom we took a refreshing swim in Shadow Mountain Lake, which had been enticing us the entire time. Too stubborn to put our boots back on, we all finished walking the trail barefoot and were even more pleased to see the car at the end.\n\nThe Drive to Grand Teton\n\nImmediately following our hike we began the drive to Grand Teton National Park. During this lovely 7.5 hour drive Lizzie discovered her love for Slim Jims while Thibault stuck to his diet of $1 any size (yes, any sized cup) Coca-Cola slushies. Meanwhile, I found a bag of chicharonnes that flooded childhood memories telling me they were delicious. I eagerly bought them, but the first and continuing bites were so disenchanting that the bag had to be thrown away immediately. However, when we stopped at Wal-Mart (for the fourth time during this road trip) I found Rancheritos, of which my childhood memories of deliciousness were still very much still accurate. Nearby to this same Wal-Mart we stumbled upon a Laundromat! Oh the spirit in the Jetta has never been so high as when we first spotted this Laundromat. With clean clothes and Rancheritos I happily fell asleep in the back and handed Lizzie and Thibault the task of finding our sleeping arrangements for the night."
