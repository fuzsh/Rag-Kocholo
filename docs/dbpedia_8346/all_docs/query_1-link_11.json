        "text": "The East Shore Trail runs along Shadow Mountain Reservoir and down Lake Granby. Hikers will traverse through Rocky Mountain National Park territory (part of the Continental Divide Trail) and into the Arapahoe National Forest Area. This trail is an excellent trek if you enjoy water front views, with many little beaches to stop and dip your toes in the refreshing, cool water. This area is popular with moose and deer, so keep an eye out for wildlife that might be enjoying the lakeshore. Don’t be afraid to try this trail out in the winter months – grab your snowshoes or skis for a fun day out in the snow!"
