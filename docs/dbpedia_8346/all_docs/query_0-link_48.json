        "text": "Olympic National Park has a stunning collection of diverse landscapes and ecosystems covering much of the Olympic Peninsula. The park is most well-known for its mystical temperate rainforests like the Hoh Rainforest, and for the easily accessible and breathtaking views of the Olympic range from Hurricane Ridge. And while both places are absolutely worth visiting on any trip to Olympic National Park, their popularity comes with crowds, and at peak times, you may find yourself waiting in long lines just to even get into the park!\n\nSo, where can you go in Olympic National Park to escape the crowds but still get amazing views? We have one idea for you…head to Deer Park!\n\nDeer Park is a small but quiet high elevation area of Olympic National Park where you can get panoramic views over the Olympic Peninsula that are just as good as those of the neighboring Hurricane Ridge, but without the same crowds. So, what’s the catch?\n\nWell, the catch is that you’ll have to drive Deer Park Road to get there. Deer Park Road in Washington is a 17- mile long road that twists and turns its way up the mountains to the top of Olympic National Park. It gives way to some beautiful views, but we will admit…it can be a pretty scary drive. It’s narrow, full of blind turns, and has a bit of exposure as it carves its way up the mountainside. But at the end of the road, you’ll be sitting at about 5,800 feet in elevation, just below Blue Mountain, and you can take a short walk to its summit to be rewarded with amazing views over the Olympic range and out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.\n\nOverall, driving Deer Park Road in Olympic National Park is a great way to escape the crowds, have a unique adventure, and get stunning views over the park, but it’s important to know exactly what you’re getting yourself in to and to be prepared. In this guide, we’ll go over everything you need to know to drive Deer Park Road in Washington, including the best time to go, what to expect on the drive, things to do in Deer Park, and more! Let’s get to it!\n\nIn this Deer Park Road guide:\n\nWhere is Deer Park in Washington?\n\nDeer Park Road map\n\nIs Deer Park Road in Washington scary?\n\nHow long does it take to drive Deer Park Road in Olympic National Park?\n\nBest time to drive Deer Park Road in Olympic National Park\n\nDo you need a 4WD vehicle to drive Deer Park Road?\n\nIs there a fee to drive Deer Park Road in Washington?\n\nDriving Deer Park Road: Our experience\n\nDeer Park Road: Things to do\n\nHiking the Rainshadow Trail\n\nMap of things to do in Deer Park\n\nTips for driving Deer Park Road in Olympic National Park\n\nWhere to stay near Deer Park Road in Washington\n\nThings to do near Deer Park Road in Olympic National Park\n\nMore Washington travel guides\n\nI won’t lie, Deer Park Road had my heart skip a beat on more than one occasion, but it might not be for the reason you’d think!\n\nDeer Park Road in Washington is a true backcountry mountain road, climbing nearly 5,000 feet to the base of Blue Mountain in Olympic National Park. While the last 8 miles of Deer Park road are gravel and steep in places, it’s actually pretty well- maintained. It does get bumpy and rutted at times, and more so as you reach the top, but it’s not the worst road we’ve ever been on by any means.\n\nOne aspect that does make Deer Park Road a bit scary to drive is the fact that there is a bit of a drop- off on one side of the road throughout much of the drive. For a while, the drop- off is kind of disguised by the trees lining the road, but it certainly is there. Once you break tree line, that drop off becomes very apparent!\n\nSpeaking of oncoming traffic…\n\nHere’s the scariest part of driving Deer Park Road in Washington…at least for me! Deer Park Road is not only narrow, but it is super twisty and winding. For pretty much the entire way, the road is made up of small turns going back and forth. There are some bigger hairpin-like turns here and there, but for the most part, the road quite literally wiggles its way up the mountainside. And because of that, there are so many blind turns. It becomes almost impossible to see any oncoming cars in large portions of the road! This was the scariest part of the drive for me and kept me on edge… there were a few times where a car would suddenly appear just as we reached a corner and my heart would jump. Fortunately, the road wasn’t busy, so this only happened a few times…which was more than enough for me!\n\nFrom the turn off on WA- 101 to the top of Deer Park Road, it’s about 17 miles and took us about 40 minutes to drive. Only the last 8 miles are gravel, but the first half of the drive is still winding and narrow, and you can’t (or won’t want to) go too fast. 15-20 mph is the average speed you’ll likely be going.\n\nOnce at the top in Deer Park, you’ll see below that there aren’t too many things to do (though trust us, it’s still worthwhile!) unless you are planning to start a longer backpacking trip through the park from here. Otherwise, a visit up here can be pretty quick. We spent about an hour or so before hopping back in the car and making the drive back down. So overall with the drive up and down, we spent about 2.5 hours for the whole Deer Park Road experience.\n\nBecause of its high altitude, Deer Park Road in Washington closes in the winter due to snow. Typically, Deer Park Road is open from mid-June to mid-October, but be sure to check road conditions and status just to make sure it’s open before you head out.\n\nBecause of the conditions of Deer Park Road, we also definitely don’t recommend driving this in the dark, or when the road is wet and slick. If you want sunrise and sunset views from the top, we recommend driving up during daylight hours and camping in Deer Park (we talk more about camping below).\n\nAnd here’s another tip for driving Deer Park Road: If you’re a little nervous and want to minimize the chances you’ll run into oncoming traffic, try to drive the road on a weekday. We drove Deer Park Road on a Monday in July, and there were only a handful of cars that we had to maneuver by. I’m sure weekends, especially in the summer, are busier (still not crowded, though!).\n\nNow in the National Park, the narrow road twists and turns through a thick lush forest on either side. And it twists and turns a lot. It’s almost as if the road is wiggling its way up the mountain. And with these twists and turns comes lots of blind turns where you really can’t see the oncoming traffic. As I mentioned above, this was definitely the scariest part of Deer Park Road for me! Luckily, the road wasn’t busy so there weren’t too many cars coming in the opposite direction, but when they did suddenly appear around those blind turns, I think both of our hearts skipped a beat or two! Fortunately, this happened where it was possible to move over just enough to slide past each other, or one of us had a small pull-off we could use.\n\nSo you made it to the top of Deer Park Road. Congratulations, you did it! Now what?\n\nWell, we’ll be honest with you…there’s not that much to do up here. But that’s okay! The main reason for driving Deer Park Road is for the experience of driving the road…and for the views you can get at the top. From up here, you can see out to Port Angeles and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and also out to the Olympic Mountain range, with Mount Olympus itself peeking up behind the foothills. The views are great from up here, so have a picnic, relax in the solitude, and soak it all in!\n\nBut here’s a brief warning: The only downside of being up here? The flies. The whole area was swarming with them! So just be prepared for that.\n\nOverall, the Rainshadow Loop is a great little trail with amazing views to reward yourself for making the journey up here. You may even get to see some cool wildlife, like marmots, deer, and mountain goats, if you’re lucky!\n\nOther things to do in Deer Park\n\nAside from the Rainshadow Loop, the top of Deer Park Road is the start of a few different backcountry trails into the Olympic National Park wilderness. From here, you can hike just over 7 miles from Deer Park to Obstruction Point near Hurricane Ridge. This is the highest maintained trail in the park, getting up to 6,100 feet in elevation, and runs through subalpine meadow and forest. Or, you can plan a long backpacking trip across the park that will take you to other regions, such as Staircase, the Buckhorn Wilderness, or the Quinault area. To plan a backpacking trip and reserve backpacking permits, check out the backpacking page on the National Park Service website.\n\nYou can also camp in Deer Park if you want to spend the night away from the crowds. The Deer Park campground lies just below Blue Mountain and the main parking area, at 5400 feet, and is a tent-only primitive campground with no potable water or trash cans (make sure to pack out all your trash!), and vault toilets only. This is a first-come first-served campground that costs $15 per night for a site.\n\nOverall, while there isn’t much to do in the Deer Park area, the things that there are to do make the trip well worth it. For us, getting to enjoy the amazing views over the Olympic Peninsula in solitude and away from the crowds was certainly more than worth the sometimes nerve-wracking drive to get here!\n\nHere are some extra tips we wanted to share before you start your drive up Deer Park Road in Washington.\n\nHave a confident driver\n\nDeer Park Road is bumpy, twisty and narrow with limited places for pulling over. You’ll definitely want someone driving who isn’t phased by some mountain road exposure, would be comfortable navigating blind turns, and would be prepared to pull over in narrow spaces or back up to a pull off when encountering oncoming cars. Luckily, Kevin fit that description (definitely not me!).\n\nBe respectful of other drivers\n\nBecause of the narrow nature of the road and all the blind turns, it’s super important to drive carefully, not just for you but for other drivers as well. As we were heading up, a few cars coming down in the opposite direction were roaring down and flying around the blind turns (which is why I think the road had me so on edge!). Take blind turns slowly and cautiously, and do the same when passing by.\n\nAlso, if you are driving extra slowly (that’s ok!) and someone comes up behind you, find a safe place to pull over and let them pass, and then wait for them to get ahead a bit and continue on. If you stay in front of them, you’ll be kicking up a ton of dirt and dust for them that will make it hard for them to see both the road and the amazing views.\n\nBring some Dramamine\n\nIf you know you’re someone who tends to get a little carsick, you might want to make sure you have whatever remedy you take for that on hand. We sound like a broken record here, but Deer Park Road is so twisty! Even while I was just watching back all the video footage I took while driving the road, I felt like I was getting nauseous all over again!\n\nBring sunscreen and bug spray\n\nThe sun can be pretty strong in Deer Park, so make sure to have sun protection, and some bug spray for those pesky flies.\n\nStay on trail\n\nThe meadows in Deer Park and on Blue Mountain are fragile, so be sure to stay on trail to preserve the landscape!\n\nIf you want to stay within 30 minutes of the start of Deer Park Road, you have a few options.\n\nSequim State Park- Located about 20 minutes from the start of Deer Park Road off WA- 101.\n\nHeart O’The Hills Campground- Located in Olympic National Park on the road up to Hurricane Ridge.
