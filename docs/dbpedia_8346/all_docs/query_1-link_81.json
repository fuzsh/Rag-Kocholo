        "text": "What can I see and do at Blue Mountain?\n\nHiking: With an elevation of 6007' the summit of Blue Mountain can be reached by the Deer Park Rainshadow Loop Trail, an easy half-mile hike on an unpaved trail. The Deer Park Rainshadow Loop Trail starts at the end of Deer Park Road. The top of the mountain is rocky and barren, but the view from the top is spectacular. From the trail hikers will get a 360 degree view of the Olympic Peninsula, including views of lush green Evergreen forest, the bright blue waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and of the five miles of bright white rock of the Dungeness Spit. This viewpoint is especially stunning around dusk when hikers are able to watch the sunset over the clouds that roll into the valleys below.\n\nCamping: Want to sleep close to the stars? Deer Park Campground on Blue Mountain is located at an elevation of 5,400 feet, with sites along the treeline of the alpine forest. The campgound is rustic (without running water and features only pit toilets) and can only be reached from a narrow, steep, gravel road, but for $9.00 a night, you will have one of the best views in the Olympic Peninsula.\n\nWildflowers: The extreme elevation of Blue Mountain and the conditions of being in the Olympic Mountain Range’s rainshadow creates unique conditions for plants and wildlife. There are a number of flowers and animal species that can only be found in the northwest region of the Olympic Mountains. Two of these unique and beautiful flowers are the Flett’s violet (Viola flettii) and the Piper’s bellflower (Campanula piperi). The Flett’s violet is a sweet little purple flower that has a happy yellow center and has thick lily pad shaped leaves. The Flett’s violet often grows in the boulders near the summit of the mountain, which can be an amazing sight. The other endemic flower to this area, the Piper’s bellflower is a also purple, but is much larger than the Flett’s. The Piper’s bellflower looks like a large lily and lives in the ridges and cliffs of the northern Olympic Mountains.\n\nWildlife: Blue Mountain is the home to a number of unique animals including the Olympic Chipmunk and the Olympic Marmot. Two animals most often viewed on Blue Mountain are black-tailed deer, mountain goats, and Roosevelt Elk.\n\nWhere is Blue Mountain, WA?\n\nBlue Mountain is located just off Olympic Highway, WA-101 in the northeast region of Olympic National Park. The Deer Park Campground on Blue Mountain and trails can be accessed from Deer Park Road, five miles east of Port Angeles, WA on Olympic Highway, WA 101. Deer Park Road becomes gravel near the end and should not be driven by RVs.\n\nWhen is Blue Mountain open?\n\nDeer Park Road closes between October and May, but experienced hikers may climb Blue Mountain in good weather when the road is closed.\n\nHow much does visiting Blue Mountain cost?\n\nHikers must buy Olympic National Park Visitors passes before arriving at Blue Mountain.\n\nWho can I call if I have more questions?\n\nOlympic National Visitor Information: (360) 565-3130"
