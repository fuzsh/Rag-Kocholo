        "text": "Description\n\nThe utility area is the principle maintenance station of Rocky Mountain National Park. It is located near the Beaver Meadows entrance at Estes Park CO. It is a large complex of functional buildings, including offices, shops, garages, and storage, centered around a maintenance yard and machine shop (plus a substantial residential area for park employees).\n\nThe National Park Service began construction of the area in the 1920s and completed it in the 1930s with the help of Public Works Administration (PWA) funding and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) labor. The CCC was present in the park from 1933 to 1942 and presumably worked on the utility area throughout that time.\n\nBrock says: “By the end of the CCC program in 1942, enrollees had completed everything from graveling and grading the area, refurbishing preexisting storage sheds and the ranger dormitory, building a powder house to store ammunition, landscaping the area with native flora, lowering the machine shop, and reconstructing the water and sewer lines in 1940 to accommodate all of the new storage sheds, shops, and residences.” (p. 44)\n\nThe overall style of the buildings is national park rustic, wooden planks and timber construction on simple stone or cement foundations, except for the concrete machine shop and a few postwar structures. “The utility area reflects the National Park Service’s concern for blending structures with the natural environment. The half-log and plank buildings, begun in 1923 at the Beaver Meadows Entrance, were completed during the 1930s under government work projects.” (History Colorado)\n\nThe entire area was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the Rocky Mountain National Park Utility Area Historic District. Some 16 maintenance buildings are listed as part of the district, along with a dozen residential structures.\n\nThe national register nomination form provides the following details (Wheaton 1975), though we have not identified all the buildings in the photographs:"
