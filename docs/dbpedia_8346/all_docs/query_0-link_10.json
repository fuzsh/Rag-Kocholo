        "text": "Description\n\nThe Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), working for the US Forest Service, constructed four fire lookout towers around Rocky Mountain National Park. The one on the summit of Shadow Mountain, overlooking Grand Lake CO in the southwest corner of the park, is the last survivor of the four.\n\nCompleted in 1933, the three-story lookout was built in the classic Rustic style favored by the US Forest Service and National Park Service at the time. It consists of a concrete foundation, two stories of stone masonry, and a wooden upper story.\n\nIt remained in use until 1968 and is today a scenic destination for hikers in the area."
