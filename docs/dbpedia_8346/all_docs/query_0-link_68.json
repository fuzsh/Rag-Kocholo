        "text": "With 58 peaks taller than 14,000 feet—more than any other state or province in North America—Colorado lives up to its Rocky Mountain High moniker. But Colorado’s four national parks (Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde, Great Sand Dunes, and Black Canyon) and nine national monuments showcase an astonishing diversity of terrain, from golden dunes to thundering river gorges and protected human-made wonders that date back thousands of years.\n\nSo, whether you’re planning a Colorado road trip or looking for things to do on a weeklong getaway, here are seven of Colorado’s best national parks and monuments to visit while you’re there.\n\n1. Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nWhy go: Iconic Colorado peaks and valleys\n\nNearest town: Estes Park is the closest to the east entrances, and Grand Lake is closest to the western, Grand Lake entrance.\n\nWhere to stay: There are five campgrounds in the park, as well as plenty of hotels and vacation rental options in Estes Park, like the Stanley Hotel (the historic hotel that was the real-life inspiration for Stephen King’s The Shining) and the modern Estes Park Resort.\n\nOf all the Colorado national parks, Rocky Mountain is probably the most famous. Here moose graze in valleys, elk leap across streams, and trails snake up jagged granite peaks (most are taller than 12,000 feet and many are more than 130 million years ago) and drop into lake-studded glacial basins. No wonder RMNP (as locals call it) received 4.3 million visitors in 2022, according to National Park Service data, making it the fourth most popular national park in the country, above even with Yosemite and Yellowstone (and after Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Canyon, and Zion).\n\nMost visitors start their explorations in the central area of Beaver Meadows and Moraine Park, while the west side of the park (Grand Lake entrance) has quieter appeal. Stay in woodsy Grand Lake to spot elk in Coyote Valley, bag Longs Peak (one of Colorado’s 14ers), go horseback riding, or test your rock climbing skills on the 12,100-foot Mount Ida. One of the main attractions is a scenic drive along Trail Ridge Road, which crosses the continental divide, passing moose, marmots, birch trees, and alpine lakes along the way.\n\nNote that RMNP is one of several parks to implement a reservation system. Reservations go on sale on recreation.gov at 8 a.m. Mountain Time the first day of each month for the following month’s dates (for example, reservations to visit in October go on sale September 1).\n\n2. Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve\n\nWhy go: Dune sledding and sandboarding\n\nNearest city: Colorado Springs (to the north), Durango (to the west), and Santa Fe, New Mexico (to the south) are the closest big cities, all about three hours away. Alamosa, a town of 9,800 people, is just a 30-minute drive.\n\nWhere to stay: Perhaps the best offering near the park is Zapata Ranch, a working dude ranch and nature conservancy. You can also camp at Piñon Flats Campground within the park or several hike-in, backpacking campgrounds. (Note: advanced reservations for Piñon Flats sites and permits for backcountry camping are needed.)\n\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is one of the nation’s more underrated national parks. But for those who make the effort to get here, it’s an incredible sight: The Great Sand Dunes sit with the white-capped Sangre de Cristo range behind them, left behind by a prehistoric lake more than a million years ago.\n\nAnd yes, you can hike the dunes—High Dune and Star Dune are two favorites—then sand sled or sandboard down. First-timers should start close to the visitor center parking lot, while aficionados can head for tallest dunes at the Point of No Return parking lot.\n\nStarting with the spring snowmelt, seasonal Medano Creek emerges from the mountains and winds between the dunes, creating a beach where families build sandcastles and swimmers sunbathe until the late summer sun dries up the flow.\n\nDuring the summer, NPS offers guided tours from the visitor center, so be sure to check in to see what kind of programing is available that day.\n\n3. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park\n\nWhy go: Dramatic crevasses that rival the Grand Canyon\n\nNearest city: Montrose is 30 minutes from the South Rim and Crawford is 30 minutes from the North Rim entrance.\n\nWhere to stay: Black Canyon of the Gunnison has several campgrounds within the park as well as basic hotel options in Montrose and Crawford. If you don’t mind a little bit of a drive, there are some good options a hour away in Ouray, including Beaumont Hotel & Spa and St. Elmo Hotel.\n\nSlicing through marbled rock walls, the Gunnison River carved a canyon so deep that, at its narrowest point, sunlight reaches the bottom for only half an hour a day. Most people who come to this part of western Colorado do so to gaze into the depths from Dragon Point, Devil’s Lookout, and other viewpoints along South Rim Drive or walk the Chasm View nature trail on the north rim. There are no maintained hiking trails into the canyon, although experienced hikers with wilderness permits venture down unmarked routes.\n\nDesignated an International Dark Sky Park in 2015, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park hosts sky parties during the summer. So if you have the time, book a campsite and plan to spend a night camping in the park.\n\n4. Mesa Verde National Park\n\nWhy go: Learn about the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde\n\nNearest city: The towns of Mancos and Cortez are 10 and 15 minutes to the park, respectively, but you’ll find more accommodation options in Durango, 40 minutes away.\n\nWhere to stay: Mesa Verde has one campground and a lodge (Far View Lodge) inside the park. Alternatively, book a cabin at Majestic Dude Ranch in Mancos. If you’d rather go to Durango, the General Palmer Hotel and the Rochester Hotel are excellent choices.\n\nThe Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde, like other Native Americans who inhabited Canyon de Chelly and other Arizona sites, carved their dwellings in the protective shadow of cliffs, constructing elaborate, multi-level communities high above the canyon floor.\n\nToday, Mesa Verde National Park—a UNESCO World Heritage site—protects more than 4,000 such ruins dating as far back as 650 C.E. While you can see the most spectacular dwellings from viewpoints on Mesa Loop Road, you can only enter Cliff Palace, Balcony House, and Long House on ranger-led tours. Petroglyph Point Trail offers excellent hiking, views of red rock canyons, and a chance to see some of the park’s best Indigenous artwork.\n\n5. Canyons of the Ancients National Monument\n\nWhy go: More archaeological sites than any other U.S. park\n\nNearest city: The closest towns are Dolores and Cortez, though Mancos is also a good homebase, especially if you want to explore this park in tandem with Mesa Verde. Durango is an hour away.\n\nWhere to stay: Although there’s no official campground, camping is allowed in the monument’s backcountry. In Durango, consider the General Palmer Hotel and the Rochester Hotel.\n\nMost visitors are surprised to discover that Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, 12 miles from Mesa Verde, has more archaeological sites containing Native American artifacts than any other park in the country—6,300 are scattered across its rugged 176,000 acres. Wander through the historic site’s star attraction, the 40-room Lowry Pueblo with its eerily well-preserved great kiva ceremonial room, then try your hand at weaving, corn grinding, and archaeological identification at the interactive Canyons of the Ancients Visitor Center and Museum.\n\n6. Dinosaur National Monument\n\nWhy go: For prehistoric fossils and water sports\n\nNearest city: Vernal and Jensen, Utah, are the closest towns to the main, western entrance (technically on the Utah side of the monument). Steamboat Springs is about 90 minutes from the east entrance on the Colorado side.\n\nWhere to stay: There are several developed campgrounds in Dinosaur National Monument, as well as backcountry camping by permit. If you prefer four walls and a roof, a vacation rental in Vernal is your best bet nearby.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see—and touch—gigantic dinosaur bones jutting out of the rock where they were found, head to this national monument in western Colorado. At Dinosaur National Monument, which spans the Colorado-Utah border, visitors can also swim, kayak, and explore Echo Park, the area where the Yampa and Green rivers meet and loop around Steamboat Rock in an almost perfect horseshoe bend.\n\nYou’re in luck, if you plan to stay the night and camp. Dinosaur National Monument has also been designated an International Dark Sky Park, and those who stay past sunset will be rewarded with some incredible stargazing.\n\n7. Browns Canyon National Monument\n\nWhy go: Whitewater rafting and wildlife viewing\n\nNearest city: The artsy towns of Buena Vista and Salida—also stops on one of our favorite Colorado road trips—are closest to the monument.\n\nWhere to stay: Yes, you could camp but there are some stand-out accommodation options nearby as well: European-esque Surf Hotel in Buena Vista and retro Amigo Motor Lodge in Salida.\n\nEstablished in 2015, Browns Canyon is best known for whitewater rafting on the Arkansas River, which tumbles over Class IV and V rapids with names like Pinball and Seidel’s Suckhole. The 22,000-acre park’s rugged terrain also offers prime wildlife viewing: Hike the Turret Trail to spot black bear fishing the river, bighorn sheep jousting on rocky outcrops, and falcons and eagles gliding on the canyon’s updrafts."
