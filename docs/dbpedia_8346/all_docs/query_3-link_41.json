        "text": "Glacier National Park is a wonderland of mountain peaks, lakes, waterfalls, and wildlife. While its famed Going-to-the-Sun Road offers spectacular scenery, the vistas get better the deeper that you delve into the park. For that reason, you’ll want to budget time to hike at least one—if not a half dozen—trails during your stay. However, you should resign yourself to the fact that it’s nearly impossible to experience all of this vast, rugged, and remote park in a single visit. But there’s certainly good reason to not delay getting started. By 2030, scientists predict all the remaining glaciers here will disappear. So grab your camera and a good pair of hiking boots and let’s get started!\n\nGetting to Glacier National Park\n\nLocated in northwestern Montana, Glacier National Park sits on the U.S.-Canada border. In fact, Glacier and neighboring Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta form the Water-Glacier International Peace Park, the first of its kind in the world. While administered separately, the parks do cooperate in the management of natural and cultural resources.\n\nGlacier Park International Airport (FCA) in Kalispell has year-round service from five cities—Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, and Seattle—in addition to nine other cities during peak season.\n\nAs you study a map of Glacier National Park, you’ll discover that there are very few roads. Your vehicle also will play a major role in how you explore the park. On Going-to-the-Sun Road—the only road to cross the park (east to west)—vehicles (or vehicle combinations like a truck and trailer or RV and towed car) can’t be longer than 21 feet or wider than eight feet between Avalanche Campground and the Rising Sun picnic area parking lot. Vehicles over 10 feet will have trouble driving west from Logan Pass because of rock overhangs. Bottom line, if you have a larger RV or a camping trailer, do not drive this road. In addition, if you’re not a fan of driving on a road with blind curves and unforgiving cliffs, you may be better off leaving the drive to someone else entirely.\n\nThe Glacier Park Express runs between the town of Whitefish to the Apgar Visitor Center (west) during the summer. Once you get to the park, you can use the free Going-to-the-Sun Road Shuttle that stops at many points of interest. However, because so many people visit during such a short window during the summer, the shuttle is often packed. There’s also the fee-based, seasonal Hiker’s Shuttle that connects West Glacier, Apgar, Lake McDonald Lodge, St. Mary, and Many Glacier; reservations are required.\n\nIn addition, you can book either a half- or full-day tour. More on those options below.\n\nShoulder seasons and winter\n\nGoing-to-the-Sun Road is sometimes not open until late May or even late June and is closed by fall when it snows. In general, most visitor facilities are closed from early October to late May. The park is typically buried in snow from November to April. Winter camping is free. If you visit during the winter, you’ll likely be doing so on snowshoes or cross-country skis, as most roads aren’t plowed. The road to Apgar Village plus 11 miles of Going-to-the-Sun Road on the west side and 1.5 miles on the east side are the only roads maintained during the winter. Check conditions in advance.\n\nScenic drives\n\nGoing-to-the-Sun Road is one of the most scenic drives in North America. If you were to drive the 50 miles from West Glacier to St. Mary during the summer, it would take nearly three hours with no stops—but you most definitely will want to stop! As the “Crown of the Continent,” Glacier is the headwaters for streams that flow to the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Hudson’s Bay, so water features—whether they be glaciers, waterfalls, or glacial lakes—dominate the landscape along with the snow-capped, jagged peaks that tell the geological history of this region.\n\nThe historic road is an engineering marvel, and as discussed earlier, it can be a white-knuckle experience. Sun Tours is operated by the Blackfeet and introduces visitors to Glacier through the eyes of the tribe. These tours travel in 25-passenger mini buses. Or consider taking a half- or full-day tour with Red Bus Tours on either the west or east side—or both. Half the fun of this tour is riding in the iconic, open-top, red buses. Each bus seats 17 passengers; the driver, called a Jammer, also is your tour guide. Pickups at major hotels and campgrounds are included in the cost.\n\nIf you decide to drive Going-to-the-Sun Road on your own or take the park shuttle, download the free audio tour app from the National Park Service before you arrive at the park. The drives to Many Glacier and Two Medicine are also renowned and equally beautiful.\n\nBoat tours and rentals\n\nGuided boat tours are available at Lake McDonald, Many Glacier, Two Medicine, and St. Mary Lake at Rising Sun; some include guided hikes. Canoe, kayak, rowboat, small motor boat, and stand-up paddleboard rentals are available at Apgar Village, Lake McDonald Lodge, Many Glacier, and Two Medicine. Book with Glacier Park Boat Company. Several rafting companies operate trips on the Middle and North Forks of the Flathead River. Fishing is permitted in the park, but anglers need to follow certain regulations.\n\nHorseback riding\n\nSwan Mountain Outfitters runs all the stables in Glacier National Park, offering one-hour, two-hour, half-day, and full-day tours at Apgar, Lake McDonald, and Many Glacier Corrals. The shorter rides are most appropriate for kids and beginners; ages requirements vary based on corral location.\n\nWildlife\n\nGlacier is home to 71 species of mammals alone—everything from tiny pygmy shrews and picas to majestic elk and moose. Protected since the park’s designation in 1910, wildlife flourishes in this enormous ecosystem.\n\nSnowshoeing\n\nFree ranger-led snowshoe walks are offered on Saturdays and Sundays during the winter from early January to mid-March. Walks start at the Apgar Visitor Center; rentals are available for a small fee. The walks aren’t recommended for kids under six years old.\n\nRanger and Native American programs\n\nInquire at a visitor center when you arrive about the various park ranger programs scheduled during your visit. In addition, members from the Blackfeet, Kootenai, Pend d’Oreille, and Salish tribes share their culture and history through the park’s Native America Speaks program. Look for sessions at campgrounds, lodges, and the St. Mary Visitor Center during the summer.\n\nStaying in and around Glacier\n\nSummer lodging is available in the park at the following locations:\n\nApgar Village (west): Apgar Village Lodge & Cabins and Village Inn at Apgar\n\nLake McDonald (west): Lake McDonald Lodge, Cabins & Suites and Motel Lake McDonald\n\nMany Glacier (east): Many Glacier Hotel and Swiftcurrent Motor Inn & Cabins\n\nSt. Mary Valley (east): Rising Sun Motor Inn & Cabins\n\nThere also are two backcountry chalets: Granite Park and Sperry.\n\nYear-round lodging is available outside the park in West Glacier, St. Mary, and East Glacier. You’ll find additional accommodations within a 45-minute drive of the park in Browning, Columbia Falls, Kalispell, and Whitefish.\n\nIn terms of camping, there are 13 campgrounds. Most of them are first-come, first-served and fill up early on summer days. You can make reservations at Fish Creek (late May through early September), St. Mary (late May through mid-August), Many Glacier (mid-June through mid-September), and Apgar (group sites; late May through early September). These campgrounds in addition to Rising Sun and Two Medicine offer evening ranger programs. RVs and trailers are not recommended at the following campgrounds: Bowman Lake, Cut Bank, Kintla Lake, Logging Creek, Quartz Creek, and Sprague Creek.\n\nBackcountry camping is possible via permit.\n\nIf you’re looking for full RV hookups, consider one of the commercial campgrounds outside of the park including West Glacier KOA and St. Mary/East Glacier KOA.\n\nHow many days should you plan to spend in Glacier National Park?\n\nTo truly appreciate the splendor of Glacier National Park, plan to spend several days exploring Going-to-the-Sun Road and its stops (perhaps on a Red Bus tour), hiking at least one (and hopefully more) trails, and then escaping the crowds to one of the less-visited areas of the park like Two Medicine Valley.\n\nBut if you only have one day to experience Glacier National Park, traverse the park along Going-to-the-Sun Road, stretching your legs on short hikes along the way. It’s better to experience some of what Glacier has to offer than none at all."
