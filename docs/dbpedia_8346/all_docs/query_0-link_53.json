        "text": "The United States is home to nearly 60 national parks. With over 300 miles of trails, 147 lakes and 450 miles of streams, Rocky Mountain National Park has become the fourth most visited national park in the country. The park is also home to 124 named peaks — 20 of which are over 13,000 feet — and straddles the Continental Divide allowing access to both the east and west slopes of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe park has much more to offer than incredible mountain scenery. Over 280 species of birds, 11 fish, 142 species of butterflies and 1100 plants call the park home. Lynx, wolverines, bears, bighorn sheep, coyotes, deer, elk, moose and mountain lions are among the 66 mammals living in the park.\n\nThere is almost too much to do in Rocky Mountain National Park. This introductory guide to the park has everything you need to know to enjoy all the beauties the park has to offer. And, if you don't feel like crunching all those numbers, it will help you narrow down your must-do list.\n\nClick here for a great online magazine about hiking Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nNeed To Know\n\nEntrance Fees and Passes\n\nDaily Entrance Passes\n\nDuring this time of year, timed Entry Permits are not currently required to enter Rocky Mountain National Park.

There are five campgrounds — Aspenglen, Glacier Basin, Longs Peak, Moraine Park and Timber Creek — as well as numerous backcountry locations. Aspenglen and Glacier Basin are only open during the summer. Reservations are highly encouraged. Reservations are encouraged for Moraine Park during the summer but the campground is first-come, first-served during the winter. The Longs Peak and Timber Creek campgrounds are open year-round and are first-come, first-served.\n\nBackcountry permits are required for all other camping locations. Visit recreation.gov for reservations.\n\nWeather\n\nWeather in the mountains can be unpredictable. It isn’t uncommon for certain elevations to see snow in July. Keep an eye on forecasts for Estes Park, Grand Lake and the Alpine Visitor Center on Trail Ridge Road. Even if the weather is stable the temperature difference between the trailhead and your destination can vary greatly. Dress in layers.\n\nTrail Conditions\n\nWith unpredictable weather comes uncertain trail conditions. Depending on winter storms— or spring — certain trails can still be covered in large snow fields in July. Rocky Mountain NP keeps their website up to date with conditions for certain areas. Be aware the further in and higher up you go the greater chance there is to see snow on the trails.\n\nSome deeper trails only have social trails rather than full paths.\n\nFishing\n\nThe park is home to four species of trout including brook, rainbow, greenback and Colorado River cutthroat. Fishing is allowed in most areas of the park. A Colorado fishing license is required — options include annual, five-day and one-day. A Habitat Stamp fee of $10 is also required with the first fishing license purchase of the year.\n\nFishing is prohibited in certain areas of the park. Some areas are catch-and-release only.\n\nSafety\n\nCell phone service is very limited in the mountains and in RMNP. Know where you are going and make sure someone else knows where you are and how long you expect to be gone. Before you go download an area map from an app such as AllTrails or use the free maps from the entrance station. Even experienced hikers and locals get lost.\n\nIf you plan to hike alone in less traveled areas it is a good idea to take a bear bell so you don’t sneak up on any wild animals. If bear bells aren’t your style some hikers prefer to talk or sing to themselves.\n\nPlease stay on the trails to prevent degradation of the surrounding flora. Practice the Leave No Trace principles and remember to take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but footprints.\n\nArea Guide\n\nRMNP is too big and has too many options to include everything here. This area guide is an intro to some of the best and least seen gems the park has to offer. Featured hikes are listed by distance for easy picking of what might work best for individual fitness and time.\n\nMany trails connect with other areas. If you want to go further or see more take a friend and park a car at two different trailheads. Make sure you know the correct route to connect the two trailheads so you don’t get lost.\n\nAll distances listed here are one-way.\n\nTrail Ridge Road/Fall River Road\n\nIf you aren’t one to hike Trail Ridge Road and Old Fall River Road are excellent options for a beautiful drive. Fall River Road is not for the faint of heart. The narrow, one-way, dirt road runs from the Lawn Lake trailhead to the Alpine Visitor Center and is closed most of the year. Both roads offer pull offs and lookout points. Trail Ridge Road has more options and views. There are several hikes off both roads worth exploring if you have the time.\n\nIceberg Lake — Trailhead: Lava Cliffs Pullout — Distance: 0.2 miles\n\nLava Cliffs — Trailhead: Lava Cliffs Pullout — Distance: 0.3 miles\n\nThousand Falls — Trailhead: Endovalley Picnic Area — Distance: 0.3 miles\n\nChasm Falls — Trailhead: Endovalley Picnic Area — Distance: 1.5 miles\n\nTimberline Pass — Trailhead: Ute Crossing — Distance: 1.9 miles\n\nForest Canyon Pass — Trailhead: Alpine Visitor Center — Distance: 2.3 miles\n\nMount Chapin — Trailhead: Chapin Pass — Distance: 2.4 miles\n\nMount Chiquita — Trailhead: Chapin Pass — Distance: 3.0 miles\n\nYpsilon Mountain — Trailhead: Chapin Pass — Distance: 4.0 miles\n\nMount Ida — Trailhead: Poudre Lake — Distance: 4.9 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nArrowhead Lake\n\nPoudre Lake\n\nSundance Mountain\n\nToll Memorial\n\nTombstone Ridge\n\nUte Trail\n\nBear Lake\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016 Rocky Mountain National Park saw a 40% increase in visitation. In 2016 the park saw over 4.5 million visitors — many of whom go to Bear Lake. Despite having an overflow lot in addition to the main parking lot the area gets so congested rangers turn cars around at the base of Bear Lake Road. During peak times the lots can fill up as early as 9 a.m. If you choose to go to Bear Lake arrive by 8 a.m. to make sure you actually get in.\n\nOther trailheads in the area fill up almost as quickly. There are very few places — unless you plan on a longer hike — where you can actually be alone with nature.\n\nEagle Cliff Mountain — Trailhead: Moraine Park Museum — Distance: 0.5 miles\n\nBierstadt Lake — Trailhead: Bierstadt — Distance: 1.3 miles\n\nChaos Canyon Cascades — Trailhead: Bear Lake via Lake Haiyaha Trail — Distance: 1.8 miles\n\nMill Creek Basin — Trailhead: Hollowell Park — Distance: 1.9 miles\n\nGlacier Falls — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 2.3 miles\n\nJewel Lake — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 3.1 miles\n\nFlattop Mountain — Trailhead: Bear Lake — Distance: 4.4 miles\n\nShelf Lake — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 4.7 miles\n\nAndrews Glacier — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 4.8 miles\n\nOdessa Lake — Trailhead: Fern Lake — Distance: 4.8 miles\n\nBlue Lake — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 5.5 miles\n\nLake Helene — Trailhead: Fern Lake — Distance: 5.7 miles\n\nNotchtop Mountain — Trailhead: Bear Lake — Distance: 6.1 miles\n\nMcHenrys Peak — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 7.1 miles\n\nChiefs Head Peak — Trailhead: Glacier Gorge — Distance: 7.8 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nBlack Lake\n\nCub Lake\n\nDeer Mountain\n\nFern Falls\n\nFern Lake\n\nFrozen Lake\n\nHallett Peak\n\nLake Haiyaha\n\nThe Loch\n\nMills Lake\n\nOtis Peak\n\nRibbon Falls\n\nSky Pond\n\nSolitude Lake\n\nThe Spearhead\n\nSprague Lake\n\nSpruce Lake\n\nTaylor Peak\n\nTimberline Falls\n\nMummy Range\n\nThis range is the largest area in RMNP and has seven named peaks over 13,000 feet. But Mummy Range has many different hikes and destinations to choose from. There is something here for every level — from the easy paved walk up to Alluvial Fan, the family go-to of Gem Lake and the exhausting experience of doing the Mummy Kill.\n\nThe Cow Creek parking is a limited selection of roadside spots. Arrive as early as possible. Parking at Lumpy Ridge is generally guaranteed and trails connect to Cow Creek if parking is full there.\n\nMcGregor Mountain — Trailhead: Fall River Visitor Center — Distance: 1.2 miles\n\nMacGregor Falls — Trailhead: Lumpy Ridge — Distance: 3.2 miles\n\nBalanced Rock — Trailhead: Cow Creek — Distance: 4.0 miles\n\nYpsilon Lake — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 4.7 miles\n\nSugarloaf Mountain — Trailhead: Stormy Peaks — Distance: 5.3 miles\n\nChiquita Lake — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 5.5 miles\n\nLawn Lake — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 6.3 miles\n\nMummy Mountain — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 7.2 miles\n\nCrystal Lake — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 7.9 miles\n\nFairchild Mountain — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 8.8 miles\n\nRowe Peak — Trailhead: Lawn Lake — Distance: 9.1 miles\n\nLake Louise — Trailhead: Dunraven — Distance: 10.9 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nAlluvial Fan\n\nBridal Veil Falls\n\nGem Lake\n\nHagues Peak\n\nHorseshoe Falls\n\nLost Falls\n\nLost Lake\n\nMummy Kill\n\nThe Saddle\n\nTwin Owls\n\nWest Creek Falls\n\nWild Basin\n\nWild Basin is located south of Longs Peak off Highway 7 and is in a secluded area of the park. A single dirt road takes hikers back to the main Wild Basin trailhead. Other pull offs and trailheads — such as Finch Lake and Sandbeach Lake — lay along the road. This area is more water than many other areas in the park. Many of the trails follow streams and many destinations are lakes and waterfalls. There is plenty of room to explore here and take in the incredible views and wildflowers.\n\nLookout Mountain — Trailhead: Horse Creek — Distance: 3.2 miles\n\nSandbeach Lake — Trailhead: Sandbeach Lake — Distance: 4.2 miles\n\nMertensia Falls — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 6.2 miles\n\nMount Meeker — Trailhead: Sandbeach Lake — Distance: 6.5 miles\n\nLion Lakes — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 6.9 miles\n\nMount Copeland — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 7.0 miles\n\nPipit Lake — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 7.2 miles\n\nFan Falls — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 7.4 miles\n\nBoulder-Grand Pass — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 7.8 miles\n\nMount Alice — Trailhead: Wild Basin — Distance: 8.8 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nBluebird Lake\n\nBox Lake\n\nCalypso Cascades\n\nCopeland Falls\n\nFinch Lake\n\nIsolation Lake\n\nIsolation Peak\n\nOuzel Falls\n\nOuzel Lake\n\nThunder Falls\n\nThunder Lake\n\nPear Lake\n\nLongs Peak\n\nLongs Peak is a daunting mammoth of a mountain that is both enticing and intimidating. Don’t let it overshadow some of the other amazing hikes that start at its trailhead. The trail up to Longs and the other destinations along the way offer many incredible views of the Beaver and the surrounding area. Be aware that hikers headed to the summit of Longs arrive between midnight and 3 a.m. The parking lot can often fill up quickly. Either plan to do the shorter hikes later in the day or start the longer hikes at zero dark thirty.\n\nEugenia Mine —Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 1.4 miles\n\nMoore Park — Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 1.8 miles\n\nPeacock Pool — Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 3.9 miles\n\nChasm Meadows — Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 4.0 miles\n\nMount Lady Washington — Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 4.2 miles\n\nThe Loft — Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 5.2 miles\n\nLongs Peak — Trailhead: Longs Peak — Distance: 7.4 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nColumbine Falls\n\nChasm Lake\n\nHighway 7\n\nThere are many easier hikes off Highway 7 that are perfect for casual day hiking. This area includes national forest land and expands into Allenspark and Estes Park. This provides perfect and easy access to post hiking refuel. Go for an early and stop by Meadow Mountain Cafe in Allenspark for lunch. They are open Wednesday - Monday until 2 p.m.\n\nOldman Mountain — Trailhead: Old Ranger Drive — Distance: 0.3 miles\n\nLily Lake — Trailhead: Lily Lake — Distance: 0.8 miles\n\nEmerald Mountain — Trailhead: East Portal — Distance: 0.8 miles\n\nLily Mountain — Trailhead: Lily Mountain — Distance: 1.8 miles\n\nKruger Rock — Trailhead: Hermit Park — Distance: 2.0 miles\n\nHomer Rouse — Trailhead: Fish Creek — Distance: 2.4 miles\n\nHomestead Meadows — Trailhead: Lion Gulch — Distance: 2.8 miles\n\nStorm Pass — Trailhead: Lily Lake — Distance: 2.8 miles\n\nTwin Sisters — Trailhead: Twin Sisters — Distance: 3.4 miles\n\nCrosier Mountain — Trailhead: Crosier Mountain Gravel Pit — Distance: 3.8 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nProspect Mountain\n\nEstes Cone\n\nWest Side\n\nThis side draws fewer visitors and tourists than the east side of RMNP. You'll enjoy more solitude here if that is what you're looking for. The western slope sees more precipitation than the east so scenery tends to be more green and lush. After a day of hiking explore nearby Grand Lake.\n\nAdams Falls — Trailhead: East Inlet — Distance: 0.3 miles\n\nLake Irene — Trailhead: Lake Irene Picnic Area — Distance: 0.5 miles\n\nGreen Mountain — Trailhead: Green Mountain — Distance: 1.7 miles\n\nBig Meadows — Trailhead: Green Mountain — Distance: 2.0 miles\n\nCascade Falls — Trailhead: North Inlet — Distance: 3.6 miles\n\nTimber Lake — Trailhead: Timber Lake — Distance: 5.0 miles\n\nGranite Falls — Trailhead: Green Mountain — Distance: 5.3 miles\n\nLone Pine Lake — Trailhead: East Inlet — Distance: 5.3 miles\n\nLake Verna — Trailhead: East Inlet — Distance: 6.9 miles\n\nBench Lake — Trailhead: North Inlet — Distance: 7.3 miles\n\nPtarmigan Mountain — Trailhead: East Inlet — Distance: 7.6 miles\n\nAndrews Peak — Trailhead: East Inlet — Distance: 8.2 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nBig Pool\n\nMount Craig\n\nMurphy Lake\n\nSummerland Park\n\nParadise Park\n\nThe southwest corner of RMNP is the most isolated and primitive. There are trails that start around the boundaries of the park but these destinations require more off-trail hiking. A lack of well-maintained trails also makes for longer mileage. If you choose to explore this area make sure to come prepared. Check out the safety section of this guide for more tips.\n\nWatanga Lake — Trailhead: Roaring Fork — Distance: 4.8 miles\n\nShadow Mountain — Trailhead: East Shore — Distance: 5.6 miles\n\nAdams Lake — Trailhead: Roaring Fork — Distance: 6.5 miles\n\nTwin Peaks — Trailhead: Roaring Fork — Distance: 6.5 miles\n\nMount Adams — Trailhead: Roaring Fork — Distance: 6.6 miles\n\nMount Bryant — Trailhead: East Shore — Distance: 7.3 miles\n\nNever Summer Mountains\n\nThe Arapahoe Indians named this range ni-chebe-chii — never no summer — for the beautiful colors and scenery the area provides. The mountains here are volcanic rather than the standard granite found in most of the park. Because of this the rotting rock makes hiking more difficult. The challenge makes the hikes very worthwhile though as you will find more solitude here to be alone with nature.\n\nCoyote Valley — Trailhead: Coyote Valley — Distance: 0.5 miles\n\nLake Agnes — Trailhead: Lake Agnes — Distance: 0.8 miles\n\nThunder Mountain — Trailhead: Never Summer — Distance: 2.0 miles\n\nLulu Mountain — Trailhead: Never Summer — Distance: 2.6 miles\n\nSpecimen Mountain — Trailhead: Poudre River — Distance: 3.2 miles\n\nLulu City — Trailhead: Colorado River — Distance: 3.5 miles\n\nSnow Lake — Trailhead: American Lakes — Distance: 3.9 miles\n\nParika Lake — Trailhead: Bowen/Baker — Distance: 5.4 miles\n\nPinnacle Pool — Trailhead: Colorado River — Distance: 5.7 miles\n\nRed Mountain — Trailhead: Colorado River — Distance: 6.2 miles\n\nBlue Lake — Trailhead: Bowen/Baker — Distance: 6.9 miles\n\nLa Poudre Pass — Trailhead: Colorado River — Distance: 7.0 miles\n\nBowen Pass — Trailhead: Bowen/Baker — Distance: 8.4 miles\n\nOther Hikes to Try:\n\nFarview Mountain\n\nLake of the Clouds\n\nMount Cumulus"
