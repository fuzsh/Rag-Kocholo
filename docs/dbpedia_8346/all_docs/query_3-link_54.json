        "text": "Free day-use passes\n\nDay-use vehicle passes are required on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday only from May 3 to September 2, 2024, for visitors to:\n\nAlouette Lake boat launch\n\nAlouette Lake South Beach day-use\n\nGold Creek trailhead\n\nWest Canyon trailhead\n\nGolden Ears parking map [PDF]\n\nIf you have a valid reservation for overnight camping, you do not need a day-use pass. You must carry proof of your reservation while in the park.\n\nFor details, visit the day-use pass page.\n\nFrontcountry camping reservations\n\nCampsite reservations are accepted at this park. During peak season, all drive-in and walk-in campsites are reservable and none are set aside for first come, first served camping. To learn more, see the frontcountry camping page.\n\nGroup camping reservations\n\nGroup campsite reservations are accepted at this park year-round. Each groupsite accommodates a minimum of 15 adults. The picnic area is available on a first come, first served basis only and is not reservable. To learn more about groupsite reservations, visit the group camping page.\n\nCheck for reservable dates above.\n\nFrontcountry and group camping reservations must be made through the BC Parks reservation service. You can make a reservation online at camping.bcparks.ca or by calling 1-800-689-9025 (1-519-858-6161 internationally).\n\nCampgrounds\n\nThere are three vehicle-accessible campgrounds in Golden Ears Park: Gold Creek, Alouette, and North Beach. Gold Creek Campground is open year-round, road conditions permitting. Alouette and North Beach campgrounds are gated and locked outside peak season unless they are required as overflow.\n\nThe campgrounds are for the use of registered campers only. Golden Ears campgrounds are extremely popular and fill most weekends during the summer. Overnight stays are limited to 14 nights per calendar year per person. You can find photographs and descriptions of all the campsites on the BC Parks reservation service.\n\nDue to campground expansion in Gold Creek, some of the facilities shown on the campground maps have been relocated.\n\nParking\n\nTwo vehicles are allowed per campsite. Both vehicles must be registered. There is no parking for extra vehicles within the campgrounds. Visitor parking lots are available for day-parking at all campgrounds.\n\nReservations\n\nCampsite reservations are accepted. For information on making a reservation, see the frontcountry camping page. When not reservable, campsites are available on a first come, first served basis, if the campground is open.\n\nBook a campsite\n\nCheck-in\n\nDuring summer season (mid-May to mid-September), all campers check in at the ticket booth.\n\nIn shoulder season (April 1 to mid-May and mid-September to October 15):\n\nCampers with reservations\n\nCheck the reservation board at the ticket booth for your site number. Go directly to your reserved campsite. Staff will come by to complete your registration.\n\nCampers without reservations\n\nLocate an unoccupied campsite that does not have a ‘reserved’ sign. Staff will come by to complete your registration. If you cannot locate a vacant campsite, check with staff in the park.\n\nFees\n\nWhen you book a site through our reservation service, you must pay all fees in advance to secure your site. For first come, first served camping, fees must be paid in cash at the park.\n\nThere are three groupsites available for reservation. There is a covered shelter available at the Golden Ears groupsite by West Canyon parking lot. The Alouette groupsite is located near the boat launch by the lake. The Woodlands groupsite is located in the Northern end of the park and is available for both equestrian and non-equestrian use. Groupsites can be reserved up to one year in advance through our reservation service.\n\nFor more information on groupsites, see the group camping page.\n\nYouth group camping is available for parties of at least 12 people. To qualify, your party must be associated with a school, recreation centre, or non-profit youth organization located in B.C. Youth group camping charges per night are $1 per person (six years of age and older), with a $50 minimum and $150 maximum.\n\nRegular group camping charges per night are $120 per groupsite per night, plus $5 per adult (16 and older) and $1 per child (six to 15). There is a minimum charge for 15 adults. Children under six camp for free.\n\nPlease plan to have your entire camping party enter the park before the daily park closure time.\n\nFor a campground map, see park and activity maps.\n\nGolden Ears Park offers some campsites that are accessible by boat only. There are no mooring facilities. All sites have pit toilets.\n\nTo use these campsites, you must register for a backcountry permit and keep it with you at all times. The camping fee is $5 per person per night.\n\nMarine camping is allowed at designated sites only. Campfires are permitted below high tide line only. Please take all your garbage with you when you leave.\n\nFor more information on responsible marine recreation, see our marine visitor guide.\n\nCampsite locations\n\nAllouette Lake (west shore):\n\nEast Beach\n\nMoyer Creek\n\nThe Narrows\n\nAlouette River (north end of the lake)\n\nPitt Lake (east shore):\n\nRaven Creek\n\nOsprey Creek South\n\nOsprey Creek North\n\nCold water taps are located in Alouette Campground, Gold Creek Campground and at the West Canyon Trailhead. Unfortunately, there is no water available at North Beach Campground.\n\nDrinking water from taps is tested on a regular basis. Water taps are shut off in the winter season. For water testing information, please contact the park operator at 604-466-8325.\n\nAnnual Drinking Water System Report 2023: Park Headquarters Water System [PDF]\n\nAnnual Drinking Water System Report 2023: Gold Creek/Aloutette Water System [PDF]\n\nAnnual Drinking Water System Report 2023: South Beach Water System [PDF]\n\nAll backcountry drinking water should be filtered, boiled, or otherwise treated before consumption. Wash all dishes and conduct personal hygiene at least 30m from any water source.\n\nThere is no permanent source of water past Alder Flats. Depending on the season, water can be melted from the snowfield that may remain in the northern shadow of the peak.\n\nGolden Ears Park features a four-lane, cement-surface boat launch at the south end of Alouette Lake. The park also offers boat-accessible camping along the lake.\n\nVehicles and trailers can be parked overnight at the boat launch parking lot. There is no nearby marina to moor boats overnight. We do not recommend leaving your boat in the water overnight due to the risk of theft.\n\nOutside the summer season, the water level in Alouette Lake can vary considerably due to water management by BC Hydro. Boaters should be especially wary during low-water conditions as submerged stumps and other obstacles may be hazardous.\n\nCampfires are not permitted in the backcountry and marine sites of Golden Ears Park. Please use a portable fuel stove for cooking.\n\nCampfires are only permitted within the metal fire rings provided at Alouette, Gold Creek, and North Beach campgrounds. Firewood can be purchased in the park from the park operator or you may bring your own.\n\nTo preserve vegetation and ground cover, please do not gather firewood from the area around your campsite or anywhere else in the park (this is a ticketable offence under the Park Act). Dead wood is an important habitat element for many plants and animals and it adds valuable organic matter to the soil.\n\nThere are four day-use beach areas on the shoreline of Alouette Lake in Golden Ears Park, which are ideal for picnicking.\n\nAlouette (South Beach)\n\nThis vehicle-accessible area is located at kilometre seven along the main parkway. It is open for summer season with full services (flush toilets, drinking water taps, change house) and open for winter season with minimal services (pit toilets only).\n\nThere is a sand and gravel beach with a seasonal roped-off swimming area. No lifeguards are on duty. Barbeque attachments are available on some picnic tables. Bring briquettes and barbeques as fires are not permitted. Canoe, kayak, and pedalboat rentals are available.\n\nDogs are not permitted in the main part of this day-use area. There is a beach area for leashed dogs between the boat launch and the canoe rental shop.\n\nCampers Beach\n\nThis walk-in area is next to Alouette and Gold Creek campgrounds. Day-use visitors can park in the visitor parking lot beside the ticket booth. Dogs are not permitted. There is a sand and gravel beach with a seasonal roped-off swimming area. No lifeguards are on duty. Canoes, kayaks, and pedalboats can be rented. A water tap is available during the summer season. Pit toilets are available.\n\nNorth Beach\n\nThis area is next to the North Beach campground and accessible on foot from the East Canyon parking lot via the North Beach Trail. The beach is sand and gravel. There are no lifeguards on duty. Dogs are permitted on this beach, but must remain on leash. Pit toilets are available.\n\nAlouette (East Beach)\n\nThis area is directly across from South Beach and only accessible by boat. Pit toilets are provided and are located a short distance up from the beach at both the north and south ends.\n\nFires and overnight camping are not permitted at the day-use areas. There is no garbage removal at Campers Beach, North Beach, and East Beach, so please bring a garbage bag and pack out your trash.\n\nYour dog must be under control at all times and on a leash no more than two metres long. This includes when you are in campgrounds and on trails within one kilometre of the Parkway Road.\n\nDomestic animals are not allowed in picnic areas, marked-off swimming areas, or park buildings. Dogs are not allowed at the main part of Alouette (South Beach) day-use area. Dogs are permitted at just two of the beaches:\n\nNorth Beach day-use area (near the outflow of Gold Creek into Alouette Lake)\n\nThe part of Alouette (South Beach) day-use area between the boat launch and canoe rental shop, accessible from parking lot one\n\nTrails beyond one kilometre of the Parkway Road are considered backcountry and dogs may be off a leash, if they are under control at all times. However, backcountry areas are not considered suitable for dogs or other pets due to rugged terrain and the potential for encounters with bears and other wildlife.\n\nThere are no recommended technical climbing opportunities in Golden Ears Park. There are two mountains accessible via official trails. These require intermediate climbing skills to reach the peaks. Both are long, strenuous hikes requiring proper equipment and experience.\n\nAlouette Mountain\n\nThis climb is accessed via 11km of trail from Mike Lake using the Incline and Alouette Mountain Fire Access Trails. A return trip will take nine or 10 hours. Be sure to take water and expect snow well into June.\n\nThe Golden Ears\n\nThe climb to these peaks is accessed from the West Canyon parking lot via the West Canyon-Golden Ears Trail. This 12km trail has an elevation change of 1500 metres. Suggested one way time is seven hours. The round trip is an overnight expedition for all but the fittest.\n\nAscent of the North Ear is made from the east side across a permanent snowfield. Extreme caution is advised and proper equipment is essential. Water may be scarce beyond Alder Flats. Expect snow on Panorama Ridge well into July.\n\nThere are campsites at Alder Flats and Panorama Ridge. See the backcountry camping section for more information."
