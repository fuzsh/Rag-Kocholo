In 2018, I discovered the majesty of Americaâ€™s national parks thanks to a visit to the crown jewel of the National Park Service: Yosemite. Since then, my identity has been shaped by countless experiences in the outdoors, experiences highlighted by these beautiful natural havens. My goal? To visit and experience every single one. Why? To educate and inspire myself & others while creating unforgettable, life-changing memories.\n\nSubscribe to my National Park Journal!\n\nIf you want to hear about new blog posts, fill out this form so I can add you to the Paul in the Parks email list."
