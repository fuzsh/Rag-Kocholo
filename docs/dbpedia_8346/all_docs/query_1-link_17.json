        "text": "Distance: 5.4 miles round trip\n\nElevation Gain: 416 feet\n\nType of Trail: Out and Back\n\nHike along the eastern shore of Shadow Mountain Lake. The lake is a reservoir, built between 1944 and 1946, with the construction of the Shadow Mountain Dam. Shadow Mountain Lake, like Lake Granby, is part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. This massive system of reservoirs, dams, and canals provides water to farmers and residents east of Colorado's Front Range.\n\nIn summer, this trail provides an opportunity to find wildlife and cool breezes coming off the water. In the Autumn, visitors can enjoy beautiful, fall colors.\n\nHike the East Shore Trail from the East Shore trail head at the north end of the lake, or the Shadow Mountain Dam trail head at the south end. Visitors have the option of extending their hike by continuing to the Ranger Meadows loop or by hiking up to the Shadow Mountain Lookout Tower. The East Shore Trail is the only trail in the Rocky Mountain National Park that permits mountain biking. Please be respectful of other visitors and share the trail no matter how you recreate.\n\nPets are prohibited on ALL park trails, tundra, and meadow areas. Leashed pets are only allowed in picnic areas, parking lots, campgrounds, and along roadsides.\n\nRestrooms are available seasonally near the Shadow Mountain Dam trail head at the Green Ridge Campground and Green Ridge Boating Site in Arapaho National Recreation Area. There are no restrooms at the East Shore trail head."
