It is already proving popular with park visitors.\" (Report of the Director of the National Park Service)\n\nJanuary 23, 1931: \"A trail to Shadow mountain was built and a temporary look-out was established there last season. Next season we plan to build a permanent fire lookout station on this mountain, which will serve a large part of Arapaho forests as well as the west side of the national park.\" (Steamboat Pilot)"
