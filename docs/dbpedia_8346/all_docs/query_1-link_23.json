        "text": "Route Description for Shadow Mountain Trail\n\nThe Shadow Mountain Trail is a wonderfully scenic adventure in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP). Perfect for families with older children and those acclimating to the high altitude of the area, the Shadow Mountain Hike is a crowd favorite. Do not be surprised if you must scramble over some trees as many pines have fallen victim to the beetle infestation in the park. Though the hike ascends a steep grade, the switchbacks lessen the bluntness of the trail. Not only will hikers be rewarded with awe-inspiring vistas from atop the mountain, but you will also get to explore the historic fire tower that sits at the summit. Located within the RMNP, visitors are required to purchase a park permit.\n\nBegin your adventure up the Shadow Mountain Hike from the East Shore Trailhead. From the trailhead, take the Continental Divide Trail and trees south along the base of the mountain. From here, enjoy the sights of Shadow Mountain Lake from the shoreline before you encounter a junction. Here, curve north along the Shadow Mountain Lookout Trail and beneath the timberline. This trail will guide you beneath the shade of a mixed pine and aspen forest. Ascend what feels like a never-ending set of switchbacks and admire the sights of the lake below between the tree breaks. Continue climbing up the path and you will eventually summit Shadow Mountain.\n\nFrom the summit, explore the fire tower that sits atop the peak and imagine the rangers that would look over the wilderness below. Revel in the vistas of the Never Summer Mountains and other Front Range snow-capped peaks. From here, you should also be able to spot the Shadow Mountain Lake and Grand Lake below between the trees. Enjoy the scenery, and when you are ready, retrace your steps back along the path to the trailhead."
