        "text": "Colorado thrill-seekers looking to take their adventures to new heights might consider exploring some of the fire lookout towers throughout the state. A few of these structures are even available for overnight stays.\n\nOften the tallest structure on the mountain, these lookouts were used primarily during the early 20th century, as a way for forest rangers to spot smoke in the distance. At the peak of their use, there were approximately 8,000 lookouts across the country. Nowadays, these fire towers have mostly been phased out and replaced with plane spotters and drones."
