While treasures of natural beauty—such as Denali’s snow-capped peaks and Mt. Rainier’s hidden alpine lakes—look majestic in photographs, few things can compare to witnessing them in person. The magnificence of these landscapes offer profound shifts in perspective. Add a dreamy place to stay, and you’re set for a transformative trip.\n\nAmerica’s national parks were conceived to protect and enhance quality of life. While there is no better time to visit than always, these standout selections, paired with thoughtfully selected hotels and rentals, have been vetted for their variety, uniqueness and relevancy, making each one particularly unmissable this year. Based on multiple trips, we’ve selected the best U.S. national parks to visit in 2024—and where to stay near each one.\n\nWhere To Stay Near The Best U.S National Parks To Visit In 2024:\n\nYosemite National Park: Firefall Ranch; AutoCamp Yosemite; The Moonstone Retreat\n\nGlacier National Park: Many Glacier Hotel; Après Whitefish; River Haus\n\nOlympic National Park: Kalaloch Lodge; Lake Crescent Lodge; Waterfront Tiny Home\n\nYellowstone National Park: Lone Mountain Ranch; Yellowstone Peaks Hotel; Eagles Wings Mountain House\n\nDenali National Park: Denali Backcountry Lodge; Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge; Denali Bear Cabin\n\nBig Bend National Park: Summit Big Bend; El Cosmico; The Perch\n\nBryce Canyon National Park: Bryce Canyon Inn; Stone Canyon Inn; Dry Valley Ranch\n\nWhite Sands National Park: Hotel Encanto; Sierra Grande, A Ted Turner Retreat; The Desert Dome\n\nMt. Rainier National Park: Paradise Village Hotel & Restaurant; Stormking Cabins and Spa; Nordic A-Frame\n\nYosemite National Park\n\nYosemite National Park, California\n\nWho Will Love It: Group getaways; multilevel hikers; landscape photographers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Mist Trail; Glacier Point; Mirror Lake\n\nWhat Not To Miss: Biking Yosemite Valley\n\nWhere To Stay: Firefall Ranch; AutoCamp Yosemite; The Moonstone Retreat\n\nThere is a reason this global treasure was the first piece of protected land in the United States. Signed into preservation by President Abraham Lincoln under the Yosemite Grant Act in 1864, this destination was recognized as significant before the national park system even existed. The timeless beauty of Yosemite is evident in its vistas of enormous granite cliffs fitted with countless cascading falls (thousands, in fact) that break into powerful rapids. And unlike some parks that may lack amenities and infrastructure, Yosemite excels. Indulge in a tasty dinner and refreshing drinks (like the Half Dome pizza at Curry Village’s Pizza Deck) without leaving the park's bounds after a day spent hiking to a panoramic vista, rafting Merced River or lounging at Mirror Lake.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nFirefall Ranch: This elegant sister property to Rush Creek Lodge & Spa and Evergreen Lodge opened its doors in May 2024 where an original stagecoach stop once stood in the 1870s. The resort hotel already has a supercharged culinary program and a luxurious spa. It will soon open an 18-hole forest disc golf course alongside hillside sunset wine tasting decks.\n\nAutoCamp Yosemite: While there are currently a select few rustic or under-renovation hotel and camping options available inside the park, we recommend these refined Airstream glamping stays for a vacation that satisfies with both camp vibes and creature comforts. Enjoy an outdoorsy day, but end it by a private fire pit followed by a rainfall shower and sweet dreams on a memory foam mattress.\n\nThe Moonstone Retreat: Let your stress melt away as you take in the view of the Merced River from this 3-bedroom home. Leave the planning to your local guide and enjoy the on-site yoga studio, outdoor copper bathtub and sensory-pleasing bells and whistles, like yak cashmere throws and wood stove-side floor pillows perched on sheepskin rugs.\n\nGlacier National Park\n\nGlacier National Park, Montana\n\nWho Will Love It: Leaf peepers; glacier seekers; binocular owners\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Grinnell Glacier Trail; Lake McDonald; Hidden Lake Trail\n\nWhat Not To Miss: Driving Going-to-the-Sun Road\n\nWhere To Stay: Many Glacier Hotel; Après Whitefish; River Haus\n\nTake off the rose colored glasses—they aren’t needed here. A natural mosaic of brightly shaded stones will reflect back to you every color of the rainbow from different eras of glacial melt history as you gaze into glass-clear Lake McDonald. Pile into the car or hop on the shuttle and prepare for a scenic drive across the Continental Divide on the way to trails that feature glacial lakes (take your bathing suit along for a cold plunge if you’re feeling brave) and dramatic vistas seen from cliffside paths. Be sure to bring binoculars; the opportunities for wildlife sightings—including bighorn sheep, bald eagles, bears and moose—are plentiful.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nMany Glacier Hotel: Perched on the edge of Swiftcurrent Lake and backdropped by multiple mountain peaks is this historic Swiss-chalet inspired hotel renowned for its views. While you won’t find amenities like air conditioning or televisions here, you will find multiple dining options and countless activities organized and offered on site, like boating and horseback riding.\n\nAprès Whitefish: A boutique stay that won’t break the bank is the perfect place for adventurous travelers flying solo or traveling with a crew to stay and après. Begin your day with a local roast from the espresso bar and unwind with heat either in the sauna or by the fireside, then head back to your room to draw the black out curtains and slip into a deep slumber on luxury linens.\n\nRiver Haus: Known as the closest house to the park’s entrance, this cheery mid-century home featuring new furnishings and a nostalgic atmosphere has it all for a family trip. Swing in the backyard hammock surrounded by huckleberry bushes while you savor the familiar smell of dinner grilling and enjoy alternating views of the kids playing lawn games and the river views.\n\nOlympic National Park\n\nOlympic National Park, Washington\n\nWho Will Love It: Rainforest fanatics; sea-to-summit lovers; sunset chasers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Hoh Rain Forest; Rialto Beach; Hurricane Ridge\n\nWhat Not To Miss: A Kalaloch sunset\n\nWhere To Stay: Kalaloch Lodge; Lake Crescent Lodge; Waterfront Tiny Home\n\nWhether you prefer mountains, oceans or lakes, Olympic National Park's nearly one million acres have something to offer everyone. The remarkable vastness encompasses multiple ecosystems including mountains, coastlines, lowland forests and some of the most well-preserved temperate rainforests in North America. Lose yourself in Rialto Beach’s colorful tidal pools brimming with orange and purple ochre sea stars, green anemones and spiky red sea urchins, or watch waves crash against the striking sea stacks and arch rocks. A plethora of activities are on the table here: rent a boat or paddleboard at Lake Crescent, hike to breathtaking views at Hurricane Ridge and Mount Storm King or experience mystical moments on the Hall of Mosses rainforest walk.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nKalaloch Lodge: Serenity, sustainable on-site cuisine and proximity to stellar beachfront sunsets are the reasons to stay at this high bluff hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Its rusticity is clear, but the cozy, connected-to-nature feel and unbeatable location within the park make this peaceful getaway a top choice for travelers.\n\nLake Crescent Lodge: One year after President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1937 visit to Lake Crescent Lodge, he designated the Olympic Peninsula as a national park. Today, visitors continue to enjoy lake-front views from their windows or private outdoor seating area during stays in one of the nostalgic, stone chimney-equipped Roosevelt Fireplace Cabins.\n\nWaterfront Tiny Home: This modern remodel of a 1920s cabin into a tiny home harmonizes modern architecture with Mother Nature. At this Seabeck stay, you’ll wake up to views from windows reminiscent of boat portholes and before wading into your own waterfront cedar hot tub.\n\nYellowstone National Park\n\nYellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana & Idaho\n\nWho Will Love It: Wildlife watchers; geology buffs; family vacationers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Upper Geyser Basin; Grand Prismatic Spring; Artist’s Point\n\nWhat Not To Miss: Watching Old Faithful erupt\n\nWhere To Stay: Lone Mountain Ranch; Yellowstone Peaks Hotel; Eagles Wings Mountain House\n\nKnown for its astounding geothermal features, including more than 10,000 burning hot springs, mudpots, fumaroles and, notably, geysers like the iconic Old Faithful, the world’s first national park is unparalleled when it comes to experiencing volcanic phenomena. Yellowstone is also renowned for its wildlife, and this June in particular, a Lakota tribe’s prophecy was fulfilled here when a white buffalo calf was born, foretelling better times ahead while also serving as a warning to humans to better protect the earth and its animals. Animal encounters are imminent when visiting this park; American Bison frequently cross roads in Lamar Valley, wolves and foxes slink through fields and elusive wolverines and lynx maintain a low profile.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nLone Mountain Ranch: This luxury dude ranch, remodeled from its original 1915 structure and home to over 100 horses, embodies the splendor of Montana. Guests can choose their own adventure here: spend the day fly-fishing for trout, practicing archery or galloping on horseback, then wind down at Horn & Cantle Restaurant or Lytle Bar.\n\nYellowstone Peaks Hotel: Recently opened in May, this impeccably designed boutique retreat minutes from Yellowstone is the realization of a young family's dream to create a hotel that offers solace, passion and beauty to travelers. There is something noteworthy about practically every nook of the built-from-scratch, 21-cabin property, but the contrast therapy available through wood-fired Japanese soaking tubs, cold plunges and a sauna stands out as particularly remarkable.\n\nEagles Wings Mountain House: Relax in a Yeti Sheepskin Chair with your feet up on the matching ottoman while catching up with your crew after a day of exploration. This luxury Paradise Valley home boasts a comprehensive list of amazing amenities, delivers mountain views from floor-to-ceiling windows and features an art gallery showcasing local pieces available for purchase.\n\nDenali National Park\n\nDenali National Park, Alaska\n\nWho Will Love It: Animal lovers; nature enthusiasts; adventurous travelers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Horseshoe Lake Trail; Denali National Park Kennels; Mount Denali\n\nWhat Not To Miss: An aerial view of the park by helicopter, plane, or zipline\n\nWhere To Stay: Denali Backcountry Lodge; Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge; Denali Bear Cabin\n\nA whopping six million acres of pristine snowscapes and rolling fields dotted with wildlife await those who seek thrills or crave tranquility at Denali National Park. Relish moments of solitude at the base of North America’s tallest peak or feel the rush at dog sledding demonstrations. This park also provides a perfect vantage point for getting a glimpse of the dancing Northern Lights, with aurora activity ramping up in August through April. Driving isn’t the recommended form of transport here, as only 15 miles into the lone 92 mile park road are accessible by private vehicle (note that the road is currently closed at Mile 43). However, Denali is known for its array of alternative transportation options including buses, bikes, rafts, ATVs, Jeeps, helicopters and more. Whichever method you choose, you’ll want to keep your eyes peeled for abundant wildlife like grizzlies, wolves and elk.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nDenali Backcountry Lodge: Only accessible by air due to current road closures, this lodge deep in the backcountry provides a curated wilderness experience second to none. The all-inclusive accommodations include any gear you may need for your adventures, along with itineraries tailored to your preferences. Activities on offer include gold panning, naturalist-guided wilderness tours, kayaking, fishing and wood-fired sauna relaxation, among others.\n\nTalkeetna Alaskan Lodge: While both Mount Denali and the Northern Lights can be elusive, here you can see them from the hotel—and even opt to be notified by the property when they are visible. There is no need to wait idly, as amenities like snowshoes, sleds, snow tubes, bikes and binoculars are readily available for use. After a day on the move, well-appointed lodge rooms await to offer repose.\n\nDenali Bear Cabin: This centrally located yet secluded cabin with a loft is a handcrafted oasis built from Douglas fir and pine. If you’re fortunate, you may even get a glimpse of the aurora during a night time rejuvenation session from your private hot tub or covered porch.\n\nBig Bend National Park\n\nBig Bend National Park, Texas\n\nWho Will Love It: Desert dwellers; hot springs enthusiasts; fossil seekers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Langford Hot Springs; Lost Mine Trail; Fossil Discovery Exhibit\n\nWhat Not To Miss: A dip in the Rio Grande at Santa Elena Canyon\n\nWhere To Stay: Summit Big Bend; El Cosmico; The Perch\n\nThose who daydream of Zion’s dramatic canyon views and the iconic hike through The Narrows—but prefer to avoid the crowds—should explore this remote park in Texas. Throw in watching wild horses graze as you soak in natural hot springs next to the Rio Grande, spotting shooting stars at one of darkest skies in the continental United States and walking where fossils of over 90 dinosaur species have been found, and you have the ultimate Big Bend trip. It’s truly the Wild West out in the Chihuahuan Desert: expect sightings of tumbleweeds, javelina pigs and roadrunners as you drive from the desert ghost town of Terlingua to reach this well-worth-the-drive wonder.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nSummit Big Bend: Stay in a converted mining cave transformed into a luxury retreat, stargaze all night from a glamping dome or have your pick of chic casitas at this alluring desert escape. Feel the expanse of 1,000 acres of desert and mountains around you as you leave reality and revel in the 360-degree views.\n\nEl Cosmico: Eclectic and far-fetched, this eye-popping collection of accommodations offers everything from funky vintage trailers to yurts, all located in the town of Marfa—about 1.5 hours away from the park, but irresistibly unmissable. The belief at this hotel is that “life should be a balance of adventure and do-nothingness,” and guests can embrace this ethos in the property’s hammock grove, wood-fired hot tubs, outdoor showers and lounge areas after a day of exploration.\n\nThe Perch: Atop a 60-million-year-old limestone plateau at the end of a dirt road accessible only by 4x4 vehicles sits this architecturally intricate, fully self-sustaining, 3-bedroom home. Expect astounding sunrise and sunset panoramas captured not only by you, but also by the house itself to provide its own power.\n\nBryce Canyon National Park\n\nBryce Canyon National Park, Utah\n\nWho Will Love It: Family roadtrippers; stargazers; rock lovers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Inspiration Point; Fairyland Loop; Queens Garden/Navajo Loop\n\nWhat Not To Miss: A sunrise at Sunrise Point\n\nWhere To Stay: Bryce Canyon Inn; Stone Canyon Inn; Dry Valley Ranch\n\nUtah is chock-full of otherworldly landscapes, but this park stands out for its spectacular spire-shaped rock formations, known as hoodoos. Its limestone amphitheaters display a color palette of red, orange and white, setting the tones just right for especially striking sunrises and sunsets. An extensive trail network and vistas that will make you marvel at nature’s mysterious artistry are the main attractions at this park, which can be enjoyed under a blanket of snow or sunshine.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nBryce Canyon Inn: Mere minutes from the park, Bryce Canyon Inn offers a collection of cozy log cabins and vacation home rentals. Onsite, you'll find a casual, family-owned pizza joint as well as the local favorite, Bryce Canyon Coffee Company.\n\nStone Canyon Inn: While there are six different types of accommodation options available here, the treehouse stays come out on top (literally). Hanging lounge chairs dangle beneath the houses, while unobstructed views of Bryce Canyon stun when you step out on the deck.\n\nDry Valley Ranch: View Bryce Canyon from an elevation of 5,700 feet at this idyllic desert retreat. The ranch is the beautiful brainchild of its owners, featuring floor-to-ceiling windows for optimal views, a cookable and conversational kitchen, a vintage vinyl collection and so much more.\n\nWhite Sands National Park\n\nWhite Sands National Park, New Mexico\n\nWho Will Love It: Sand sledders; lucid dreamers; moonrise catchers\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Dunes Drive; Dune Life Nature Trail; Interdune Boardwalk\n\nWhat Not To Miss: A sled down the dunes at sunset\n\nWhere To Stay: Hotel Encanto; Sierra Grande, A Ted Turner Retreat; The Desert Dome\n\nRest your eyes on the endless expanses of shining and shifting sands as the sun dips behind the world’s largest gypsum dunefield. Wander barefoot with a freshly waxed sled in hand through the location that holds the most Ice Age-era fossilized footprints on earth, then indulge your inner child with a slide down the soft hills. Kids will have a field day, while the whole family will be dazzled by the sun and shadow patterns that pop particularly at sunset. Prepare to drive around an hour or more to get here from your stay, but this is the park to go to for rekindling a sense of wonder and awe.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nHotel Encanto: Grab a complimentary sled from the concierge and head to the dunes. This Southwestern-style hotel in Las Cruces is the ideal launch point for the park, and the town itself offers no shortage of things to do. Be sure to check out the robust Saturday farmer’s market and grab eclectic beers at Bosque Brewing.\n\nSierra Grande, A Ted Turner Retreat: It’s worth the drive to the town of Truth or Consequences to stay at this restorative, conservation-focussed boutique property. Daily complimentary hot spring soaks and acres of the property’s unspoiled beauty are at your fingertips. Guests can also learn about the extensive initiatives underway to preserve and protect the vast expanse of flora and fauna across Ted Turner’s million acres of New Mexico land.\n\nThe Desert Dome: This Chaparral dome abode is optimally located just over an hour from White Sands on the edge of White Sands Missile Range. Ascend the spiral staircase for sprawling views, and have fun exploring the many colors and shapes of the stay.\n\nMt. Rainier National Park\n\nMt. Rainier National Park, Washington\n\nWho Will Love It: Meadow frolickers; long weekend lovers; fairytale enthusiasts\n\nAll-Star Attractions: Skyline Trail; Christine Falls; Reflection Lakes\n\nWhat Not To Miss: A hike to a fire lookout\n\nWhere To Stay: Paradise Village Hotel & Restaurant; Stormking Cabins and Spa; Nordic A-Frame\n\nHolding the title as one of the snowiest places in the United States and often referred to as America's Everest, Mount Rainier is a snow-capped stratovolcano that feeds six major rivers and lends its name to the surrounding national park. Like scenes from a storybook, the vistas here include spectacular alpine meadows bursting with cool and warm-toned wildflowers, giving way to pristine lakes that reflect the mountain and its verdant surroundings. Hiking through these ancient forests is essential, with trails available for all skill levels. The park also offers opportunities for more rigorous activities, such as climbing and backcountry skiing.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nParadise Village Hotel & Restaurant: Step into a modern day fairytale at this cozy woodland cabin with enormous windows located just minutes from the park. Other room options offer space for families and larger groups, and every accommodation features memory foam mattresses. Outstanding extras include a Ukrainian restaurant, bee therapy and a “cannibal hot tub” where guests can soak over an open flame.\n\nStormking Cabins and Spa: Romantic and rustic, these five animal-named cabins next to the Ashford entrance of Mt. Rainer offer the perfect retreat. Check out the recently opened spa, start your day with Stormking’s own fresh-roasted coffee and enjoy the surroundings on your private cedar deck complete with a hot tub.\n\nNordic A-Frame: Twinkling string lights line the entrance to this A-Frame, making for a bright welcome through the cherry red door into the epitome of coziness. As if plucked directly from a Pinterest board entitled “Mountain Home Goals,” this stay boasts both a wood-burning stove and outdoor fire pit, furry blankets and rugs, and a collection of books, games and puzzles for timeless entertainment.\n\nAbout Alexandra Toto, Your U.S. National Parks Guide\n\nI am a travel writer with love for the intersection between life’s rugged adventures and refined comforts.
