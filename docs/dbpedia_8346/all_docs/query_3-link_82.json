It was established by the act of Congress approved January 26, 1915, and its boundaries adjusted by the acts of Congress approved February 14, 1917, June 9, 1926, and June 21, 1930. Its eastern gateway is the beautiful valley village of Estes Park, from which easy and comfortable access is had up to the noblest heights and into the most picturesque recesses of the mountains.\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is by far the most accessible of our national parks; that is, nearest to the large centers of population in the East and Middle West.\n\nLAND OF LOFTY MOUNTAINS\n\nFor many years the Front Range of the Rockies has been the mecca of the mountain lovers of this country. The name conjures European ideas of American mountain grandeur. The selection of this particular section, with its magnificent and diversified scenic range, for national park status, met with popular approval.\n\nIt is splendidly representative. In nobility, in calm dignity, in the sheer glory of stalwart beauty, there is no mountain group to excel the company of snow-capped veterans of all the ages which stands at everlasting parade behind its grim, helmeted captain, Longs Peak.\n\nThere is probably no other scenic neighborhood of the first order which combines mountain outlines so bold with a quality of beauty so intimate and refined. Just to live in the valley in the eloquent and ever-changing presence of these carved and tinted peaks is in itself satisfaction. But to climb into their embrace, to know them in the intimacy of their bare summits and their flowered glaciated gorges, is to turn a new, unforgettable page in human experience.\n\nBear Lake, with Massive Longs Peak in the Background\n\nShelk photo.\n\nThis national park reaches lofty heights. The summer visitors who live at the base of the great mountains are 8,000 feet, or more than a mile and a half, above the level of the sea; while the mountains themselves rise precipitously nearly a mile, and often even higher. Longs Peak, the largest of them all, rises 14,255 feet above sea level, and most of the other mountains in the Snowy Range, as it is sometimes called, are more than 12,000 feet high; several are nearly as high as Longs Peak.\n\nThe valleys on both sides of this range and those which penetrate into its recesses are dotted with parklike glades clothed in a profusion of glowing wild flowers and watered with streams from the mountain snows and glaciers. Forests of evergreens and silver-stemmed aspen separate them.\n\nThis range was once a famous hunting ground for large game. Lord Dunraven, a famous English sportsman, visited it to shoot its deer, bear, and bighorn sheep, and acquired large holdings by purchase of homesteadings and squatters' claims, much of which was reduced in the contests that followed.\n\nThe range lies, roughly speaking, north and south. The gentler slope is on the west. On the east side the descent from the Continental Divide is precipitous in the extreme. Sheer drops of two or three thousand feet into rock-bound gorges carpeted with snow patches and wild flowers are common. Seen from the east-side valleys this range rises in daring relief, craggy in outline, snow spattered, awe inspiring.\n\nIn the north-east corner lies a spur from the Continental Divide, the Mummy Range, a tumbled majestic mountain mass which includes some of the loftiest peaks and one of the finest glaciers.\n\nTo the south of Longs Peak the country grows even wilder. The range is a succession of superb peaks. The southern park boundary unfortunately cuts arbitrarily through a superlative massing of noble snow-covered summits.\n\nThe west side, gentler in its slopes and less majestic in its mountain massings, is a region of loveliness and wildness diversified by splendid mountains, innumerable streams and lakes of great charm. Grand Lake, which has railroad connections nearby, is one of the largest natural lakes in Colorado and the deepest lake in this region.\n\nOne of the striking features of Rocky Mountain National Park is the easy accessibility of these mountain tops. One may mount a horse after early breakfast in the valley, ride up Flattop to enjoy one of the great views of the world, and be back for late luncheon. The hardy foot traveler may make better time than the horse on these mountain trails. One may cross the Continental Divide from the hotels of one side to the hotels of the other between early breakfast and late dinner or motor between these points via the Trail Ridge Road in 2 hours.\n\nThe Trail Ridge Road, which crosses the Continental Divide, connects Estes Park on the east side with Grand Lake on the west side. The road reaches the unusual elevation of 12,183 feet above sea level. Another road leads from the village of Estes Park up the Thompson River Valley to the Bear Lake Entrance. It then follows up the valley of Glacier Creek and ends at Bear Lake at the foot of Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain.\n\nEASY TO STUDY GLACIAL ACTION\n\nOne of the remarkable features of Rocky Mountain National Park is the legibility of the record left by the glaciers during the ages when America was in the making. The evidences of glacial action, in all their variety make themselves apparent to even the most casual eye.\n\nIn fact, there is scarcely any part of the eastern side where some great moraine does not force itself upon the attention. One enormous moraine built up by an ancient glacier and rising with sloping sides nearly a thousand feet above the valley is so prominent that Moraine Park is named for it. From Longs Peak on the east side the Mills Moraine makes a bold curve which instantly draws questions from visitors.\n\nThere are several remnants of these mighty ice masses which can be seen at the present time. Three of the largest ice fields, Andrews, Rowe, and Tyndall Glaciers, are visited by many people each year, while the smaller glaciers such as Taylor and Spragues have interest and charm.\n\nIn short, this park itself is a primer of glacial geology whose lessons are so simple, so plain to the eye, that they immediately disclose the key to one of nature's scenic secrets.\n\nLONGS PEAK\n\nThe greatest of all the mountains in the park, Longs Peak, has a massive square head. It is a real architectural structure like an enormous column of solid rock buttressed up on four sides with long rock ledges. On the east side a precipice of 1,200 feet drops sheer from the summit into the wildest lake that one can possibly imagine. It is called Chasm Lake and there is only one month in the year when its surface is not at least partially frozen. Mount Meeker and Mount Lady Washington enclose it on the south and north, and snow fields edge its waters the year round.\n\nIn 1820 Maj. S.H. Long first saw the mountain that now bears his name. The report of his expedition records that on June 30 of that year his party caught their first glimpse of the Rocky Mountains, and particularly noted one peak, which they referred to as \"the highest peak.\" Long's expedition followed up the valley of the Platte River, and his closest approach to the peak was at a distance of about 40 miles. Fremont found that the name Longs Peak was in general use among the fur hunters and pioneers in 1842. The first recorded ascent was in 1868, when it was climbed by W.N. Byers, Maj. J.W. Powell (who the following year made the first passage of the Grand Canyon), and five other men.\n\nNATURAL BEAUTIES\n\nA distinguishing feature of Rocky Mountain National Park is its profusion of precipice-walled canyons lying between the very feet, so to speak, of the loftiest mountains. Their beauty is romantic to a high degree. Like all the other spectacles of this favored region, they are readily accessible from the valley villages by trail, either afoot or on horseback.\n\nUsually several lakes are found, rock embedded, in such a gorge. Ice-cold streams wander from lake to lake, watering wild-flower gardens of luxuriance and beauty. However, the entire park is a garden of wild flowers. From early June to late September, even into October, the gorges and the meadows, the slopes, and even the loftier summits, bloom with colors that change with the season. Blues, lilacs, and whites are the earlier prevailing tints; yellow predominates as autumn approaches.\n\nThere are few wilder and lovelier spots, for instance, than Loch Vale, 3,000 feet sheer below Taylor Peak. Adjoining it lies Glacier Gorge on the precipitous western slope of Longs Peak and holding in its embrace a group of lakelets. These, with lesser gorges cradling romantic Bear Lake, picturesque Dream Lake, beautiful Fern Lake, and exquisite Odessa Lake, and still others yet unnamed, constitute the Wild Gardens of the Rocky Mountain National Park, lying in the angle north of Longs Peak; while in the angle south lies a little known wilderness of lakes and gorges called Wild Basin.\n\nAt timberline, where the winter temperature and the fierce icy winds make it impossible for trees to grow tall, the spruces lie flat on the ground like vines; presently they give place to low birches, which, in their turn, give place to small piney growths, and finally to tough, straggling grass, hardy mosses, and tiny alpine flowers. Grass grows in sheltered spots even on the highest peaks, which is fortunate for the large curve-horned mountain sheep which seek these high, open places to escape their special enemies, the mountain lions. Even at the highest altitudes gorgeously colored wild flowers grow in glory and profusion in sheltered gorges. Large and beautiful columbines are found in the lee of protecting masses of snow banks and glaciers.\n\nA High Country Lodge\n\nGrant photo.\n\nNowhere else is the timberline struggle between the trees and the winds more grotesquely exemplified or its scene more easily accessible to visitors of average climbing ability. The first sight of luxuriant Engelmann spruces creeping close to the ground instead of rising 150 feet or more straight and true as masts arouses keenest interest. Many trees which defy the winter gales grow bent in half circles. Others, starting straight in the shelter of some large rock, bend at right angles where they emerge above. Others which have succeeded in lifting their heads in spite of winds have not succeeded in growing branches in any direction except in the lee of their trunks, and suggest big evergreen dust brushes rather than spruces and firs.\n\nAbove timberline the bare mountain masses rise from one to three thousand feet, often in sheer precipices. Covered with snow in autumn, winter, and spring, and plentifully spattered with snow all summer long, the vast, bare granite masses, from which, in fact, the Rocky Mountains got their name, are beautiful beyond description. They are rosy at sunrise and sunset. During fair and sunny days they show all shades of translucent grays and mauves and blues. In some lights they are almost fairylike in their delicacy. But on stormy days they are cold and dark and forbidding, burying their heads in gloomy clouds from which sometimes they emerge covered with snow.\n\nFAUNA AND FLORA\n\nThe national park is a sanctuary for wildlife. Animals and birds are protected from hunting. Living trees may not be cut or injured. Flowers may not be picked. The cooperation of visitors is requested, in order that the wildlife of the park may be protected, that the flowers may continue in their present abundance, and that the forests of the park may not suffer injury from fire or other cause.\n\nAnimals\n\nThe lofty rocks are the natural home of the celebrated Rocky Mountain sheep, or bighorn. This animal is much larger than any domestic sheep. It is powerful and wonderfully agile. When fleeing from enemies these sheep, even the lambs, make remarkable descents down seemingly impossible slopes. They do not land on their curved horns, as many persons declare, but upon their four feet held closely together. Landing on some nearby ledge, which breaks their fall, they immediately plunge downward again to another ledge, and so on till they reach good footing in the valley below. They also ascend slopes surprisingly steep. They are more agile even than the celebrated chamois of the Swiss Alps, and are larger, more powerful, and much handsomer. A flock of a dozen or more mountain sheep making their way along the volcanic flow which constitutes Specimen Mountain in Rocky Mountain National Park is an unforgettable sight.\n\nThe beaver, whose dams and other structures, both old and new, found along most streams at middle altitudes, are rarely seen except at night or very early morning. Elk occur in numerous places, and deer which are widely distributed are commonly seen. Coyotes and brown or black bear are occasionally seen, but these, like the mountain lion, bobcat, and small carnivorous animals, are not only rare, but so wary that they are seldom seen by visitors.\n\nAmong smaller animals, the most familiar are the marmot or woodchuck, Freemont or pine squirrel, three kinds of chipmunks, and the interesting little cony or pika, which lives among the rocks on high mountains and is more often heard than seen. In all, over 60 species of mammals live in the park.\n\nElk Herd Grazing In Park Meadow\n\nBirds\n\nThe commonest species are the western robin, the beautiful mountain bluebird, and, at middle elevations, the chickadee and junco. The hermit thrush and the solitaire, generally classed among the finest songbirds in the world, are both fairly common in suitable localities; and but little inferior to these in musical performance are the purple finch, ruby-crowned kinglet, western meadowlark, and rock and canyon wrens. The graceful violet-green swallow is unsurpassed in beauty of form and color, and the crested jay, magpie, and nutcracker are conspicuous for their handsome appearance and vigorous flight. Among birds particularly interesting because of curious and unusual habits are the broadtailed hummingbird, water ouzel, campbird, nuthatch, nighthawk, and the ptarmigan, pipit, and rosy finch of the high peaks.\n\nAlthough widely distributed through the park, birds are more numerous along streams and near open marshes and meadows than in the dense forests. About 100 species are found regularly in summer, and nearly 150 have been recorded during the whole year.\n\nFlowers\n\nThis park is especially notable for the presence of the blue columbine and many beautiful flowers of the gentian and primrose families; for the profusion of dwarf alpine plants on the meadows above timberline; and for the brilliance of certain species found in moist glades of the subalpine zone. Striking examples of the latter are the tall blue larkspur and monkshood, of many vivid hues, and the curious little red elephant.\n\nConspicuous and characteristic flowers of the lower altitudes are the mariposa lily, iris, wallflower, gaillardia, and numerous species of cinquefoil, pentstemon, and evening primrose. Among the less common groups, several delicate species of orchid, pyrola, violet, and anemone will delight the botanist. Over 700 distinct species of flowering plants have been collected within the park, and doubtless many more await discovery and identification by the careful student.\n\nTrees\n\nThe principal trees are the Engelmann spruce, which forms extensive primeval forests in the subalpine region, the lodgepole pine, the prevailing tree of middle elevation, very common in second growth, and the ponderosa pine, a large spreading tree, occurring mainly in the lower valleys and foothills. The limber pine is frequent in high rocky places, assuming picturesque forms at timberline, and the Douglas fir, or false hemlock, is widely distributed, while the blue spruce and alpine fir are confined to moist stream banks. In addition to the coniferous trees, there are three species of poplar, of which the commonest is the well-known quaking aspen, growing in scattered groves throughout the park.\n\nIceberg Lake From Trail Ridge Road\n\nClatworthy photo.\n\nAUTOMOBILE TRIPS\n\nDenver Circle Trip\n\nThe Trail Ridge Road, which crosses the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park, offers a grand circuit of Colorado's beauties that forms one of the most attractive and impressive of the scenic automobile trips of our country.\n\nThe trip starts from Denver, crosses the Continental Divide at Milner Pass in Rocky Mountain National Park, reaches Grand Lake, crosses the Continental Divide again at Berthoud Pass, traverses the Denver Mountain Parks, and returns to Denver, having completed without any duplication 240 miles of comfortable travel through magnificent country, full of interest and variety; the trip can be made in 2 days or it can be prolonged to suit individual time and inclination. It combines in one trip half a dozen features, any one of which by itself would be worth the journey. The Rocky Mountain Parks Transportation Co. operates daily scheduled trips over this route during the summer season.\n\nOn leaving Denver the road leads out Federal Boulevard, crosses Westminster Heights, from which point there is an extensive view of the Great Plains to the east and a panorama of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains to the west, stretching out before the eye from Pikes Peak to Longs Peak, a rampart of mighty mountains, 125 miles from end to end. The road then passes through a farming section, where irrigation has turned what was once an arid plain into a richly productive district. Fields of deep green alfalfa alternate with the waving wheat, and in the fall of the year the harvesting and threshing add new life to the landscape. Next is the town of Lafayette, where coal mining is the principal industry, and then the road traverses a sugar-beet country. Colorado is the sugar bowl of the United States, and here is one of the regions where the beets are most successfully grown. At Longmont and Loveland are large factories, where sugar is extracted from the beets and refined for table use. At Loveland the road turns westward and soon plunges into the precipitous canyon of the Thompson River, where it follows the turns of the dashing stream, walled in by towering cliffs. Then comes the village of Estes Park at the edge of Rocky Mountain National Park and half surrounded by it. From the green of the meadowland the eye follows the slope, up, up, up, over timbered hills and rocky cliffs, past timberline to the crest of the Continental Divide where snow lingers, and to Longs Peak.\n\nContinuing the journey, two routes lie open to the motorist. One of these follows up the valley of Fall River, 2 miles beyond the Fall River gateway, and then turns left over a portion of the Highdrive to the beginning of the new Trail Ridge Road.\n\nThe other road leads past the Government museum and information office to Moraine Park and Deer Ridge, with a magnificent view of Longs Peak and the Continental Divide.\n\nThe Trail Ridge Road is the highest continuous automobile road in America. Its 4-mile section over 12,000 feet in altitude is probably the longest stretch of road ever built at such a height. The trip to Grand Lake on this road is a never-to-be-forgotten experience. The road climbs to the very crest of the range and then follows the ridge. Valleys and parks lie thousands of feet below, rivers look like tiny silver threads, and automobiles on the highways of the floor of the valley resemble minute moving dots.\n\nTo the south an unexcelled view of the most rugged portion of the Front Range is spread out, while to the north, across Fall River Valley, the view is dominated by the majestic Mummy Range, and the course of the old Fall River Road may be traced as it zigzags up the slope of Mount Chapin toward Fall River Pass. Over a 350-foot cliff one may look into fascinating Iceberg Lake, a rock-bound crystal pool on which float blocks of ice.\n\nA short distance beyond Iceberg Lake the highest point on the road is reached, 12,183 feet above sea level; the road descending to Fall River Pass, elevation 11,797 feet, which divides the waters of the Thompson River from those of the Cache la Poudre. The view from this point is unsurpassed. Below lie streams, valleys, forested slopes, and the realms of civilization. All around are mountains and peaks, no longer towering above but close at hand or seen across some mighty valley. One can easily trace the work done by the glaciers during the ice age on these mountain ranges; the broad U-shaped valleys and precipitous amphitheaters or cirques at the head of the streams are the typical glacial signs, written in bold letters on the landscape. To the south is Trail Ridge. Iceberg Lake, walled in by cliffs, is only a mile distant, though not in sight. To the west is Specimen Mountain, interesting because of the variety of color in its volcanic rocks, geodes lined with crystalline material, volcanic glass, and other curious formations. It is also the home of the mountain sheep.\n\nFarther to the west lies the Medicine Bow Range, or, as the Indians so picturesquely named it, the \"Never Summer\" range. Of its many peaks the most prominent are Bowen, Nimbus, Red, Cumulus, Howard, Lead, and, highest of all in this range, Mount Richthofen, 12,953 feet in elevation. Strange as it may seem, Milner Pass lies below, and one descends in order to cross the Continental Divide. The road drops down into the forest zone, passes Poudre Lakes, and crosses Milner Pass at an elevation of 10,759 feet. The Atlantic slope lies behind and, crossing the backbone of the continent, one travels down the Pacific slope to the headwaters of the Colorado River. The valley of the North Fork is hemmed in by mountains. The Continental Divide makes a loop here and blocks progress to the west, north, and east. The valley opens to the south, however, and the road proceeds down the north fork of the Colorado River.\n\nGrand Lake, the sapphire gem on the western edge of the national park, is one of the largest and most beautifully situated lakes in the State. It is a mile and a half in length and nearly a mile in width. Its clear, cold water is of great depth. The lake lies at an elevation of 8,369 feet and claims the highest yacht club in the world. The annual regatta is an event of much interest. At the head of the lake Mount Craig rises to a height of 12,005 feet, while Shadow Mountain, Bryant, Wescott, and Mount Enentah are nearby.\n\nThis is a point of concentration for park visitors where nearly everybody spends at least one night. Fishing, boating, horseback riding, and mountain climbing are some of the outdoor attractions.\n\nLeaving the lake, the road follows down the Colorado River, passes the town of Granby, and commences the climb up a beautifully timbered valley to Berthoud Pass. Here, close to timberline, the watershed between the two oceans is again crossed. The road approaches near Georgetown, famed for its railroad loop, and then passes through Idaho Springs, with its hot springs and medicinal baths. Soon the valley of Clear Creek is left behind and the climb to Bergen Park is made where the Denver Mountain Parks are entered. In this region is Lookout Mountain, where Colonel Cody, \"Buffalo Bill\", is buried, overlooking the plains he knew so well.\n\nFrom Wildcat Point there is a splendid view of foothills and plains, with Denver some 12 or 14 miles away.\n\nBear Lake Road\n\nThe Bear Lake Road passes the Glacier Basin public campground, 7 miles from Estes Park, and then follows up the valley of Glacier Creek, passing near Sprague's Lodge, and ends at Bear Lake, 12 miles from Estes Park. This is one of the best roads within the park boundaries. Bear Lake Lodge, on the eastern shore of the lake, offers good accommodations. The trail to Loch Vale starts from the Bear Lake Road, about 10 miles from Estes Park. From this trail or from Bear Lake the hiker can reach some beautiful and scenic country, including Glacier Gorge, Loch Vale, Dream Lake, and Tyndall Gorge. The trail to Fern Lake and the Flattop Trail to Grand Lake may be conveniently reached from Bear Lake. North Longs Peak Trail also leaves the road at this point.\n\nLoop Trip\n\nOne may combine portions of several roads by taking what is known as the loop trip. Starting from Estes Park, the route follows the Fall River Road up to Chasm Falls and back to Horseshoe Park, then over Deer Ridge to Beaver and Moraine Parks, then a side trip up the Bear Lake Road and back, returning to Estes Park by the Moraine Park Road. This loop trip takes one by many of the hotels and other points of interest and offers scenic views. The circuit of the Highdrive is 17 miles. Including the trip to Bear Lake and other points, the distance is about 40 miles.\n\nLongs Peak And Wild Basin Trip\n\nThe main road to the Longs Peak district comes in just east of the village of Estes Park, skirting the east boundary of the park to its south-east corner. It passes between Longs Peak and the Twin Sisters, a detached area of the park on which a fire lookout is stationed, and several of the finest foot trips in the park are accessible from this road.\n\nContinuing in a southerly direction, the road skirts the eastern boundary of the park and leads to Copeland Lodge on North St. Vrain Creek. From this point a trail leads into Wild Basin, a very attractive though less frequented portion of the park.\n\nThe road continues to Allens Park, thence to Ward, Nederland, and Boulder; another road leads down the South St. Vrain to Lyons.\n\nTRAIL TRIPS\n\nTravelers on trails are advised to secure the services of licensed guides for all except the shortest trips. Besides insuring security, the guide adds greatly to one's comfort and enjoyment. He knows the country and its features of interest, and also has a general knowledge of the trees and wild flowers. Information as to guides can be secured at the park information office.\n\nThe Flattop Trail\n\nThe Flattop Trail crosses the Continental Divide between Estes Park Village on the east and Grand Lake Village on the west. The 16-mile trip may be made on horseback or on foot in 1 day, but it takes a seasoned trail traveler to do it with pleasure. The trail starts at Bear Lake, where horses may be rented, and climbs Bierstadt Moraine. It emerges above timberline, overlooking Emerald Lake and Tyndall Glacier, and commands spectacular views of Longs Peak and other mountains, both in the park and in distant ranges. The grassy slopes above timberline, bedecked with exquisite alpine flowers, afford good summer grazing for elk and mountain sheep.\n\nAfter descending to timberline on the western slope, the trail leads through evergreen forests, along the North Inlet to Grand Lake.\n\nLawn Lake\n\nThe glories of the Mummy Range, exemplified chiefly in Lawn Lake and Rowe Glacier, may be seen from a trail starting from Horseshoe Park by way of Roaring River. There is a shelter on beautiful Lawn Lake. This lake, which has an area of 65 acres, lies at the bottom of the main cirque at the head of Roaring River. It is one of the many glacial lakes of the park, and lies just below timberline at an altitude of 10,950 feet.\n\nThe trip from Lawn Lake to Rowe Glacier is difficult but well worth while. The glacier is the largest in the park. It is a great crescent of ice partly surrounding a small lake. While the glacier is extremely impressive, still it is small enough to permit a thorough examination without undue fatigue. Hagues Peak is a resort of Rocky Mountain sheep and ptarmigan.\n\nFern And Odessa Lakes\n\nThe group of luxuriant canyons east of the Continental Divide and north of the eastern spur which ends in Longs Peak is known as the \"Wild Gardens\" in distinction from the corresponding and scarcely less magnificent hollow south of Longs Peak, which is known as \"Wild Basin.\"\n\nOf these canyons, one, the most gorgeous, frames two lakes of exquisite beauty. The upper one, Odessa Lake, lies under the Continental Divide and reflects snowy monsters in its still waters. The other, Fern Lake, a mile below, is one of the loveliest examples of forest-bordered waters in the Rockies.\n\nThese lakes are reached by trail from Moraine Park. They constitute a day's trip of memorable charm. Fern Lodge, located at the edge of the lake, offers comfortable accommodations. Several splendid trips can be taken on foot with Fern Lake as a starting point. Winter sports are held here every year. Forest Inn, a camp located at the Pool, is close to the Fern Lake trail.\n\nA trail connects Bear Lake with Odessa Lake. One of the finest trail trips in the park is the circle trip from Bear Lake to Odessa Lake, and thence to Fern Lake and Moraine Park. The distance from Bear Lake to the Brinwood by this route is 9 miles, but a day is usually allowed for the trip.\n\nMap of Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nHallet Peak, Tyndall Glacier, And Flattop Mountain, Across Bear Lake\n\nShelk photo.\n\nRomantic Loch Vale\n\nWithin a right-angled bend of the Continental Divide lies a glacier-watered, cliff-cradled valley which for sheer rocky wildness and the glory of its flowers has few equals. At its head Taylor Peak lifts itself precipitously 3,000 feet to a total height of more than 13,000 feet, and from its western foot rises Otis Peak, of nearly equal loftiness, the two carrying between them broken perpendicular walls carved by the ages into fantastic shapes. One dent encloses Andrews Glacier and lets its waters find the Loch. On the eastern side another giant, Thatchtop, sheltering the Taylor Glacier, walls in the upper end of Loch Vale. It is easily reached by a trail that leaves the Bear Lake Road, 10 miles from Estes Park, or 1 mile below Bear Lake.\n\nIn this wild embrace lies a valley 2 or 3 miles long ascending from the richest of forests to the barren glacier. Through it tinkles Icy Brook, stringing like jewels, three small lakes. Those who love to explore the undeveloped and less frequented regions will enjoy the wild beauty and impressive grandeur of Loch Vale. The Lake of Glass and Sky Pond, just below Taylor Glacier, can be visited in a day's trip. Another wonderful day can be spent in a trip to the foot of Andrews Glacier.\n\nGlacier Gorge\n\nOne of the noblest gorges in any mountain range the world over lies south of Loch Vale. It is reached from the Bear Lake Road, by the Loch Vale trail, although there are no trails in the gorge. Above Lake Mills the western wall of the gorge is formed by McHenrys Peak and Thatchtop; its head lies in the hollow between the Continental Divide and Longs Peak, with Chiefs Head and Pagoda looming on its horizon. Its eastern wall is the long sharp northern buttress of Longs Peak itself. It is a gorge of indescribable wildness. Lake Mills lies near the mouth of the valley, Black Lake is toward the upper end, while Shelf Lake, Blue Lake, and several others are perched on benches high above the valley floor.\n\nThis gorge is magnificent and worth visiting. There is no trail to Keyhole, on the great shoulder of Longs Peak, but the ascent can be made. The canyon is luxuriantly covered in places with a large variety of wild flowers.\n\nThe Twin Sisters\n\nNine miles south of the village of Estes Park, split by the boundary line of the national park, rises the precipitous, picturesque, and very craggy mountain called the \"Twin Sisters\", on which the park maintains a fire lookout. Its elevation is 2,400 feet above the valley floor, which is about 9,000 feet high. The trail leads by many zigzags to a peak from which appears the finest view by far of Longs Peak and its guardians, Mount Meeker and Mount Lady Washington.\n\nFrom the summit of the Twin Sisters an impressive view is also had of the foothills east of the park, with glimpses beyond of the great plains of eastern Colorado and many of their irrigating reservoirs.\n\nAscent Of Longs Peak\n\nOf the many fascinating and delightful mountain climbs, the ascent of Longs Peak is the most inspiring, and it is one of the most strenuous. The great altitude of the mountain, 14,255 feet above sea level and more than 5,000 feet above the valley floor, and its position well east of the Continental Divide, affording a magnificent view back upon the range, make it much the most spectacular viewpoint in the park. The difficulty of the ascent also has its attractiveness. Longs Peak is the big climb of the Rocky Mountain National Park. And yet the ascent is by no means forbidding. One may go more than half-way by horseback. Over a thousand men and women, and occasionally children, climb the peak each season. Those making the Longs Peak trip should have strong, comfortable shoes, stout warm clothing, and remember that cold or stormy weather is sometimes encountered.\n\nThe peak may be reached by either of two trails which lead to the Boulder Field, the highest point on the climb to which horses may be taken. The east trail, which begins near Longs Peak post office, 9 miles south of Estes Park, winds up the slope of Battle Mountain, passes timberline at an elevation of more than 11,000 feet, swings to the crest of Mills Moraine, overlooking Chasm Gorge, then skirts the slope of Mount Lady Washington, goes through Granite Pass, and leads to the shelter cabin in the center of the Boulder Field, at an elevation of 12,700 feet, a distance of 6 miles.\n\nFrom Glacier Gorge Junction on the Bear Lake Road, the north trail winds its way up the north slope of the peak through the great burn of 1900 and joins the east trail at Granite Pass, a mile and a half below the Boulder Field cabin. The distance to the Boulder Field by this trail is 9 miles.\n\nFrom the Boulder Field cabin the ascent to the summit may be made by either of two routes. The north face route, which is the shorter, climbs the precipitous north side of the summit, skirting along the rim of the east precipice, with magnificent views down the sheer drop of 1,200 feet into Chasm Lake in the gorge below. The Longs Peak climb includes the hazards usual to any major mountain ascent. Visitors are cautioned that use of the assisting cables on the North Face route is at their risk and the Government is in no way responsible. The other route leads across the Boulder Field to the Keyhole, half a mile distant and some 500 feet higher, where there is a small storm shelter.\n\nOn passing through the Keyhole, one sees the imposing Front Range, and 2,000 feet below the Glacier Gorge. To the left there is a narrow, steeply inclined ice-filled gulch, called the Trough. Finally, after what is to the amateur often an exhausting climb, one passes along the Narrows, up a steep incline known as the Homestretch.\n\nThe trip to the Keyhole is well worth while for those who do not care to climb Longs Peak, but who do wish to see at close range the rugged grandeur of the mountains. Another splendid foot trip from the Boulder Field cabin is to Chasm View, half a mile distant, where one sees the precipitous east face of Longs Peak, from the summit down to Chasm Lake, 2,500 feet below.\n\nChasm Lake\n\nOne may ride on horseback almost to Chasm Lake. The view from here is magnificent, and the upper gorge is one of the most impressive in the park. Both Chasm Lake and the Keyhole may be visited in a day. This is an exceptionally fine trip, and if horses are used it is not difficult.\n\nWild Basin\n\nThe splendid Wild Basin area south of Longs Peak and east of the Continental Divide is dotted with lakes of superb beauty in a sublime mountain setting. It is entered from Copeland Lake by an unimproved road up the North Fork of St. Vrain Creek, which soon lapses into a trail. From mountain tops on the south may be had unsurpassed views of the snowy mountains. The largest lakes of Wild BasinâThunder Lake and Bluebird Lakeâare both above timberline but are easily accessible by trails.\n\nGrand Lake\n\nThe North and East Inlets are the two principal rivers entering beautiful Grand Lake. Each flows from cirques under the Continental Divide. Lake Nokoni and Lake Nanita, among the most romantic of the park, are reached from a trail connecting with both sides of the park by the Flattop Trail. Lake Verna and her unnamed sisters are the beautiful sources of the East Inlet and are reached by trail.\n\nGrand Lake On The Western Edge Of The Park\n\nGrace photo.\n\nWhile not yet as celebrated as the showier and more populated east side, the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park has rugged charm. The Continental Divide, bent from the north and called the \"Never Summer Mountains\", rises from the western shore of the Colorado River. On every side the mountains lift bald peaks, magnificent canyons penetrate the precipices of the Divide, and beautiful streams rush down the mountain slopes to the river.\n\nWHAT TO DO\n\nThere are few places which offer as many diversions as Rocky Mountain National Park. The Estes Park Golf and Country Club has an excellent 18-hole golf course and a tennis court. Several hotels have croquet and tennis courts. There is much motoring, horseback riding, fishing, and hiking. The motorist may skirt the loftiest of snow-splashed mountains for miles, or he may motor up the Trail Ridge Road and leave his car to start afoot on mountain-top tramps and picnics, or across the Continental Divide to Grand Lake. The horseback rider may find an infinite variety of valley roads, trails, and cross-country courses, and the hiker strike up the mountain trails into the rocky fastnesses.\n\nA Typical Park Scene\n\nFishing\n\nFishing is permitted in all streams and lakes of the park except as closed by order of the superintendent. Information regarding closed areas may be obtained at any ranger station. All of the lower streams and lakes, and many of the lakes in the higher altitudes, are well stocked with trout. The State of Colorado stocks the park waters, and, therefore, a Colorado State license is required for males over 16 years of age. These may be purchased in the villages of Grand Lake and Estes Park. Fishing tackle can be purchased or rented from several stores in the village of Estes Park.\n\nA fish hatchery, operated by the State of Colorado, is located on the Fall River Road, 4 miles west of Estes Park. This hatchery supplies about 1,000,000 trout fry every year to the streams and lakes of this vicinity. The process of hatching and caring for the trout is explained to visitors, and the hatchery has proved to be of interest to many thousands each year.\n\nHorseback Riding And Camping\n\nAt Estes Park and the smaller settlements nearby, and at Grand Lake, horses and complete camping outfits may be had at reasonable rates. General groceries and suitable equipment, including clothing and shoes, can be purchased from the general stores in Estes Park Village. Saddle horses may be rented at many of the hotels. There is much horseback riding throughout the entire district.\n\nThere are many competent guides in the vicinity who will arrange special trips, either on foot or by saddle horse, and either stopping at hotels or camping out, according to the preference of the party. A list of authorized guides can be secured at the park information office.\n\nWinter Sports\n\nRocky Mountain National Park has unusual advantages for winter sports, interest in which is steadily increasing. The town of Estes Park is readily accessible by automobile, and hotel accommodations are available there every month in the year. The Rocky Mountain National Park Ski Club has constructed ski courses near Estes Park where tournaments are held periodically. Cross-country trips may be taken in the high mountainous country where the snowfall is heavy and where good skiing conditions prevail during the winter and early spring. Allens Park and Grand Lake also have ski clubs and ski courses. Skijoring, snowshoeing, tobogganing, and skating may also be enjoyed.\n\nADMINISTRATION\n\nRocky Mountain National Park is under the control and supervision of the Director of the National Park Service, who is represented in the administration of the park by a superintendent, assisted by a number of park rangers who patrol the reservation. Thomas J. Allen, Jr., is superintendent of the park, and his post office address is Estes Park, Colo.\n\nExclusive jurisdiction over the park was ceded to the United States by act of the Colorado Legislature of February 19, 1929, and accepted by Congress by act approved March 2, 1929. The United States commissioner for the park may be reached through the superintendent's office.\n\nAn information bureau is maintained at the national park museum building in Estes Park to supply visitors with desired information regarding accommodations, transportation schedules, foot trips, guides, and other information relative to the park.\n\nThe post office for the park and many hotels and resorts on the east side is Estes Park, Colo. There are post offices at Longs Peak and Allens Park, but letters addressed to Estes Park will be forwarded. The west-side post office is at Grand Lake, Colo.\n\nNaturalist Service\n\nIllustrated lectures are given at various points throughout the park and vicinity each evening. Nature hikes, from a few hours to a day in length, are conducted regularly.\n\nA museum of natural history containing interesting exhibits is located near the office. An information office is maintained in the same building, which dispenses road and general information. A small branch museum is located at Fall River Pass. A museum of Indian and historical material is located on the main highway in Moraine Park.\n\nA complete schedule of the week's activities is posted at all hotels, lodges, and campgrounds. For detailed information inquire at the museum. There is no charge for any of the above-mentioned activities.\n\nPublic Campgrounds\n\nThe National Park Service maintains six free public campgrounds, as follows:\n\nSqueaky Bob Campground, located on the Trail Ridge Road, 38 miles west of Estes Park, and 12 miles north of Grand Lake.\n\nGlacier Basin Campground, located on the Bear Lake Road, 7 miles from Estes Park.\n\nAspenglen Campground, located on the Fall River Road, 5 miles from Estes Park.\n\nWild Basin Campground, 15 miles south of Estes Park on the North St. Vrain Creek at the park boundary.\n\nEndovalley Campground, located on the Fall River Road, 9 miles from Estes Park.\n\nLongs Peak Campground, located at the beginning of the east Longs Peak Trail near Longs Peak post office.\n\nMotorists and others who bring camping equipment with them will find that these campgrounds are attractive places in which to enjoy life in the open. Both wood and water are readily available.\n\nPARK SEASON\n\nFrom June 15 to September 20 the hotels are open, daily transportation service through the park is available, and the park may be explored most conveniently and thoroughly. The roads to Estes Park, by way of Lyons and the Thompson Canyon, remain open throughout the year and the village has daily transportation and mail service. Some of the hotels in Estes Park are open all the year. The national park is never closed to visitors and every season offers its particular attractions. The autumn coloring is remarkably beautiful. The aspens start to turn early in September, and from that time until the middle of October the hillsides are streaming in golden color. In the winter those who enjoy snowshoeing, skiing, and other sports will find the park excellently adapted to these invigorating pleasures. Those portions of the park having an elevation of 9,000 feet or more are covered with a thick blanket of snow during most of the winter months. In the spring one may watch the snow line climb steadily up the slope of the mountains. Birds and early flowers appear in the valleys while winter still reigns on the higher mountains.\n\nThe Trail Ridge Road remains open to travel until the first heavy snowfall. This usually occurs in October, and the road is not passable again before June 15. Other lower roads have a longer season, and even in mid-winter one may usually go by automobile for 5 or 6 miles beyond Estes Park Village before finding the roads closed by snow.\n\nHOW TO REACH THE PARK\n\nDenver, the gateway to the western national parks, is reached by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy; Rock Island & Pacific; Colorado & Southern; Denver & Rio Grande Western; Denver & Salt Lake; Union Pacific; and Missouri Pacific railroads. For information regarding fares, service, etc., apply to railroad ticket agents.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Parks Transportation Co. operates regular daily automobile service to the park from the following places: Denver, leaving at 8:45Â a.m. and 2:30Â p.m.; Greeley, 9:15Â a.m.; Fort Collins, 7:45Â a.m.; Loveland, 9:50Â a.m.; Longmont, 9:45Â a.m.; Lyons, 11:30Â a.m.; Boulder, 9:35Â a.m. Corresponding return service from Estes Park is available, return trips for Denver starting from Estes Park at 8:15Â a.m. and 1:45Â p.m.\n\nFrom June 15 to September 20 automobile connection is made at Granby, Colo., for a tour of the park by way of Grand Lake and Estes Park to Denver, leaving Granby at 12 noon daily. Auto service is available also, leaving Grand Lake at 5:35Â p.m. and arriving at Granby at 6:05Â p.m.\n\nThe United Airlines, operating 18-hour transcontinental service through Cheyenne, connects with Wyoming Air Service for Denver, which in turn connects at that point with the Rocky Mountain Parks Transportation Co. service to the Rocky Mountain National Park. From the south, T.W.A., Inc., and American Airlines, in their transcontinental services through Albuquerque and El Paso, respectively, connect with Denver by the Varney Speed Lines.\n\nALL-EXPENSE CIRCLE TRIPS\n\nFive special all-expense tours from Denver to the park and return to Denver are offered by the Rocky Mountain Parks Transportation Co. from June 15 to September 20. Denver is about 85 miles from the park, and for $16 (transportation cost only) you can make a 2-day trip, entering the park through picturesque Big Thompson Canyon, crossing the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains twice, and stopping at Grand Lake, Estes Park, Clear Creek Canyon, Idaho Springs, and Lookout Mountain. This tour affords fine panoramas of the Rocky Mountains from elevations above 12,000 feet. Another 2-day tour follows the same route but includes lunch at Estes Park, dinner, night's lodging, and breakfast at Grand Lake Lodge, and lunch the second day at Idaho Springs. The cost is $22.\n\nThe 3-day tour is leisurely enough to permit the traveler to spend a night at Estes Park Chalets and 1 at Grand Lake Lodge. The cost is $27, including meals and lodging. The 4-day trip includes 2 nights at Estes Park Chalets and 2 at Grand Lake Lodge; the cost is $32. On the 6-day trip which costs $44, 3 days are spent at Estes Park Chalets and 3 at Grand Lake Lodge. These tours are leisurely and permit ample time for fishing, horseback riding, or hiking.\n\nTours similar to the above, but connecting with the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad at Granby, are available at the same rates. Special all-expense tours from Granby, through the park, to Estes Park and Denver are available also at similar rates.\n\nTRANSPORTATION IN THE PARK\n\nThe traveler who has no car available or does not wish to drive his own machine in the mountains may take advantage of the special trips offered from June 15 to September 20 by the Rocky Mountain Parks Transportation Co. at Estes Park. The Trail Ridge, Fall River, and Highdrive loop trip of about 50 miles costs $5 and requires about 4 hours. One can go in the morning, leaving at 8:30 o'clock, or in the afternoon at 2. The Estes Park-Grand Lake trip of about 47 miles costs $5 one way and $8 for a round trip.
