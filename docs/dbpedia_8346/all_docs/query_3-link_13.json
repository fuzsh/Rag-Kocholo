        "text": "Located in-between Grand Lake and Lake Granby is the scenic Shadow Mountain Reservoir, covering more than 1,300 acres of surface area. Possibly one of the most underrated lakes in Colorado, Shadow Mountain Lake is connected to Grand Lake via a narrow waterway providing a serene, shallow area for non-motorized and small motorized boats to pass through. The east side of the lake is flanked on one side by Rocky Mountain National Park, home to the lake’s namesake peak which stands at just over 10,000 feet in elevation. Hike to Shadow Mountain.\n\nShadow Mountain Reservoir Boating\n\nBoat ramps, parking and fee stations are provided at the Green Ridge boat launch and campground on the South end of Shadow Mountain reservoir. Boat inspections are required and available at Green Ridge (learn more about Colorado ANS Inspection and Decontamination here.\n\nShadow Mountain Reservoir Kayaking and SUP\n\nThe best access points for non-motorized water activities such as kayaking, standup paddle boarding and canoeing on Shadow Mountain Reservoir are at campgrounds and picnic sites. Located at the north end near Grand Lake, the Hilltop boat launch (for non-motorized boats only) and Point Park picnic areas are very popular for kayaking and SUP. Located on the south end of the lake, the Pine Beach and Shadow Mountain picnic sites also offer ideal spots for launching non-motorized watercraft.\n\nShadow Mountain Reservoir Fishing\n\nFly fishing and line fishing are both popular activities on Shadow Mountain reservoir, thanks to an abundance of brown trout in its cold, clear waters. A Colorado fishing license (cost varies, see our Fishing page for details) is required and can be purchased at the Beacon Landing Marina on Lake Granby or Kirk’s Flyshop in Grand Lake, Colorado.\n\nShadow Mountain Reservoir Camping\n\nLocated on the south end of Shadow Mountain Reservoir, the Green Ridge Campground has 78 non-electric campsites for tent and RV camping. Restrooms, drinking water, trash service, fire rings and picnic tables are provided, and two boat ramps are available. Dogs are allowed on leashes. Fees are required and reservations are recommended for all Arapaho National Forest camping sites."
