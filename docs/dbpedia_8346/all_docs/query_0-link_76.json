        "text": "Did you know there are 20 national parks, monuments and historic sites in Arizona? Everyone knows about Grand Canyon, but there are many more natural wonders to explore on federal land in Arizona.\n\nIf that’s not enough incentive to get out and explore our public lands, get this: a few days each year, the National Parks Service allows free entrance to all park properties.\n\nTake Petrified Forest National Park for example. Just a few miles from the town of Holbrook, you can explore hundreds of acres of land where the fossilized remains of massive prehistoric trees adorn the landscape. Bonus: a sizable swath of the beautiful Painted Desert passes through the north end of the park. You can also experience ancient ruins and petroglyphs.\n\nThen there’s Saquaro National Park near Tucson. Explore trails that weave through stands of Arizona’s iconic cactus that are so tall and dense you’ll feel like you’re walking in a forest.\n\nFree Entrance Days at our National Parks for 2024:\n\nJanuary 15: Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nApril 20: First day of National Park Week\n\nJune 19: Juneteenth National Independence Day\n\nAugust 4: Anniversary of the Great American Outdoors Act\n\nSeptember 28: National Public Lands Day\n\nNovember 11: Veterans Day\n\nBook an epic Arizona tour with trusted affiliate Viator\n\nBreakdown of national parks, monuments and historic sites in Arizona\n\n3 National Parks\n\n5 National Historic Places\n\n12 National Monuments and Historic sites\n\nAdmission to all of them is free on the special dates above.\n\nNorthern Arizona\n\nCanyon de Chelly National Monument\n\nGrand Canyon National Park\n\nHubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\n\nPetrified Forest National Park\n\nGrand Canyon-Parashant National Monument\n\nPipe Spring National Monument\n\nNavajo National Monument\n\nSunset Crater Volcano National Monument\n\nWalnut Canyon National Monument\n\nWupatki National Monument\n\nNorth Central Arizona\n\nMontezuma Castle National Monument\n\nTonto National Monument\n\nTuzigoot National Monument\n\nSouthern Arizona\n\nCoronado National Monument\n\nCasa Grande Ruins National Monument\n\nChiricahua National Monument\n\nFort Bowie National Historic Site\n\nOrgan Pipe Cactus National Monument\n\nSaguaro National Park\n\nTumacácori National Historic Park\n\nWest Coast\n\nGlen Canyon National Recreation Area\n\nGrand Canyon-Parashant National Monument\n\nLake Mead National Recreation Area\n\nHow much is admission to National Parks on normal days?\n\nDaily admission fees vary from park to park. To enter Grand Canyon National Park, a 7-day pass costs $35 per vehicle. A permit to Petrified Forest or Saguaro National Park is only $25. Many of the national monuments and historical sites are free to access year-round.\n\nBest value: annual pass\n\nIf you plan on visiting multiple park properties throughout the year, the America the Beautiful annual pass is the best value at $80 per year. Free and reduced rate passes are available for military members, seniors, some parks volunteers and, get this, fourth graders.\n\nHow the National Parks came about\n\nAmerica’s National Parks are the result of efforts by the U.S. Government to designate certain federally-owned land parcels as “public parks or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.” Yellowstone National Park was the nation’s first, after receiving Congressional approval in 1872. Next came Sequoia (1890), Mt. Rainier (1899), Crater Lake (1902) and Yosemite (1890).\n\nGrand Canyon National Park received its designation in 1919. President Herbert Hoover signed Saguaro National Park into existence in 1933. Petrified Forest didn’t have national park status until 1962, but earned protection as a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906.\n\nCheck out nps.gov online for more details about the many national park properties in Arizona. That’s the best source of information about park availability, admission fees, special programs and more."
