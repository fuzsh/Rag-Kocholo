        "text": "Distance: 5.2 miles / 8.4 km\n\nElevation Gain: ~1,500 ft. / 457 m\n\nThe Angels Landing Trail is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful day hikes in Zion National Park!\n\nHowever, the Angels Landing Trail is also the single-most popular day hike in Zion, which inevitably means that Angels Landing has changed over the years from what it used to be.\n\nBy this, I mean that following the trailâ€™s explosion in popularity, due entirely to social media, the Angels Landing Trail is now managed under a permit system in an effort to reduce the number of visitors hiking the narrow trail.\n\nThat being said, Iâ€™ve been visiting Zion and hiking the Angels Landing Trail for many years, both before and after the implementation of the permit system, to be able to share and compare my honest thoughts about each experience.\n\nHow Hard is Angels Landing?\n\nThe Angels Landing Trail is absolutely beyond some peoplesâ€™ ability. Thereâ€™s no nice way to say it, but many people do not have the physical capability to hike Angels Landing, both because of the physical requirements and comfortability to high-exposure areas, while potentially hiking on snow and black ice during the off-season months.\n\nOn the upper elevations of the trail, you cannot fall, and many people have died hiking Angels Landing before. I believe some of this can be blamed on the sheer lack of preparation among hikers, as the trail is more serious of a hike than people give it credit for. Iâ€™ve seen people up there without water during the hot summer months and walking in designer shoes when thereâ€™s black ice on the chains.\n\nI donâ€™t know why it needs to be said, but take the trail seriously!\n\nMy Experience With an Angels Landing Permit\n\nFirst of all, without enforcement, the Angels Landing permit system is NOT helping to reduce crowds. I now exclusively hike Angels Landing for sunrise because itâ€™s the only way to enjoy the trail without hoards of people. However, both before and after the implementation of the permit, the way down from Angels Landing has always been very crowded. Today, itâ€™s mostly people who do not have permits.\n\nThis is because people are legally allowed to hike up to Scout Lookout without a permit, but during my experience with a permit, north of 95% of people that I was passing on the way down the chains were illegally hiking without one.\n\nFor two reasons, the permit system is not helping. Since law enforcement doesnâ€™t always hike up to Scout Lookout to check permits, which they need to daily, people simply keep hiking past Scout Lookout without consequence. The second is that allowing people to hike up to Scout Lookout without a permit still attracts the same amount of people on the trail as if there wasnâ€™t a permit in place. In my opinion, the permit needs to be for the entire trail to be effective, and enforcement needs to be checking at the trailhead regularly.\n\nWithout these measures, Angels Landing unfortunately becomes much more dangerous for everyone hiking, and Iâ€™ll explain why later.\n\nHow to Get an Angels Landing Permit?\n\nWith all that said, it seems like the Angels Landing permit is here to stay. I can only hope that some changes are made to actually make it serve its purpose.\n\nAs for getting a permit to hike past Scout Lookout, there are two options.\n\nIf you know the dates of your trip in advance, you can apply for the advanced seasonal lottery at this link here.\n\nThe second option is the daily lottery, which is how most people apply, and itâ€™s how I got my Angels Landing permit. You can apply for the daily lottery one day in advance at this link here.\n\nDo NOT try to use my lottery email as your permit! I purposefully excluded some of the most important sections of the email to try and prevent people from cheating the system.\n\nHow Hard is it to Get an Angels Landing Permit?\n\nIf youâ€™re wondering how likely it is for you to be successfully awarded an Angels Landing permit, it really comes down to two factors. First, how busy is the season/ dates that are applying for, and second, the lottery drawing is truly and completely 100% random no matter how many days in a row you have been applying.\n\nHereâ€™s what I mean. I was awarded my permit for this hike during the busy March spring break season, and I was very lucky to say the least. Dates like this, especially during the busy summer months, will have a much higher number of applicants than other times of the year.\n\nSecondly, I know that the lottery drawing is completely random because of the people that I talked to on the hike down. It took me two days of unsuccessful submissions before I was awarded a permit, but other people that I talked to said that they had been applying for more than a week straight without any luck. On top of this, I ran into one woman on the hike down who said she had a permit for the day prior but decided not to use it because of the really crappy bad weather. Then, she applied for a second day in a row and was successfully awarded twice. I hope that this shows that receiving a permit is completely by chance.\n\nAngels Landing Trailhead Parking\n\nParking for any trail in Zion Canyon is located either at the Zion Visitor Center, or the Zion Human History Museum.\n\nFrom either of these two locations, you need to ride the Zion Canyon Shuttle to the trailhead. Know that after 9 a.m. during most times of the year, parking in these two spots becomes extremely competitive, and the park service may shut down parking altogether and tell you to park in Springdale.\n\nIf this is the case, you can ride the shuttle from Spingdale to get into the park.\n\nGoogle Maps Directions: Zion Visitor Center / Zion Human History Museum\n\nHow to Hike Angels Landing for Sunrise?\n\nThe best time of day to hike Angels Landing is before the sun comes up!\n\nThat being said, vehicles arenâ€™t allowed in to drive into the canyon, meaning the closest you can park to the trailhead is 3.3 miles (5.3 km) away at Canyon Junction or 4.0 miles (6.4 km) away at the Zion Human History Museum if the gate for the Mt. Carmel Highway is closed at the junction, which means the museum is the only option.\n\nFrom wherever you park, you can either walk or bike your way to the Grotto Trailhead. However, renting bikes in Springdale can be a challenge if you are awarded a day-before permit, as the results are typically announced around 4 p.m.\n\nHowever, if you rent in advance using the link below, you can enjoy the e-bike as a full-day rental, even if you arenâ€™t awarded a permit.\n\nAdditionally, one of my favorite things about booking through Viator is the reserve-now-and-pay-later option. As long as youâ€™re booking more than three days in advance, you have the option to book ahead and cancel in the future if you change your mind."
