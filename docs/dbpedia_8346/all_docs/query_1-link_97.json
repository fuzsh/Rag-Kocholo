It is also much calmer than Estes Park. For this reason, we reckon itâ€™s a great choice for couples that want to escape the huge tourist crowds elsewhere in the region.\n\nNamed after its location next to a major lake, the town is also home to some great watersports providers, giving you something a little bit different compared to the rest of the park. Itâ€™s pretty easy to get to, especially if youâ€™re arriving from the west â€“ but we do recommend bringing a car if you can.\n\nThe Lookout | Jaw-dropping Views in Grand Lake\n\nSpeaking of gorgeous views, it doesnâ€™t really get any better than this!

Combining laid-back vibes with plenty of kid-friendly activities, Granby is a fantastic base for a family adventure this year.\n\nItâ€™s a bit harder to get to, so youâ€™ll definitely need a car â€“ but totally worth it once youâ€™ve arrived.

Itâ€™s a bed and breakfast, so your morning meal is included; thereâ€™s a great selection, including hot food, vegan grub, and gluten-free delights. During the winter they offer a ski rental service, as well as bike rental throughout the year.\n\nThings to See and Do in Granby\n\nGranby Mesa is a pretty challenging but absolutely rewarding hike â€“ great if youâ€™re travelling with active teenagers.\n\nGranby Ranch might be the most laid-back ski resort in the country â€“ they offer regular classes to suit all levels, and the apres-ski facilities are family-friendly.\n\nKeen for a spot of golf?

Allenspark is about a 30 drive away, but if youâ€™re backpacking the USA on a budget, itâ€™s totally worth the extra travel time. Whatâ€™s more, it also has a much more local atmosphere thanks to the lack of tourists.\n\nMany visitors to Allenspark are taken aback by how creative the town is, with plenty of art galleries across the town and local artisans selling their crafts in boutiques. Allenspark might not be the first place you think of, but itâ€™s certainly worth considering if you want to head off the beaten path.\n\nMountain Lodge | Stylish Cabin in Allenspark\n\nThis authentic log cabin is a little bit secluded, making it a firm favourite for those that really just want to get away from civilisation for a bit. Lord knows, thatâ€™s all of us this year! It comes with two bedrooms, plus a sofa bed in the living room, so most party sizes can comfortably stay in this pleasant bolthole.\n\nEnchanting Cabin | Beautiful Log Cabin in Allenspark\n\nNestled just north of Allenspark, this quirky cabin has a large outdoor space, making it a popular choice with families on a budget.
