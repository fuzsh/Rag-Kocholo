        "text": "The preserve's second highest point (after Camelback) is Piestewa Peak at 2,608 feet. If you want to enjoy the panoramic views, there's only one way up: The extremely strenuous Summit Trail (#300), challenging hikers with a 1,200-ft elevation gain and rocky, unrelenting climb. It's one of Phoenix's best hikes, but it's a challenge.\n\nPiestewa Peak was originally called \"Vianom Do'ag\" by the Tohono O'odham tribe, which meant \"Iron Mountain.\" By the 1900s, white settlers called the mountain \"Squaw Peak,\" a derogatory term for Native women. It wasn't until 2003 when the Arizona government officially changed the name to Piestewa Peak in honor of Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizona woman who was killed in action in Iraq that same year. Piestewa was the first Native American woman to die in combat in the U.S. military.\n\nAs a way to pay homage to Piestewa, local taiko drummer and Japanese folk artist Ken Koshio hiked the peak at sunrise every morning to play his taiko drum and flute between 2020-2023. Learn more about his summit and performance in the video below.\n\nPlease note: Piestewa Peak is closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on days with excessive heat warnings.\n\nDistance: 1.2 miles out-and-back\n\nTime: 25 to 60 minutes, depending on experience\n\nTrailhead: 2701 E Squaw Peak Dr, Phoenix, the first driveway on the left in the Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area. Water and restrooms are available.\n\nWhat to expect: Crowds, exposed schist rock and a difficult climb give way to jaw-dropping views from the top. Bring more water than you think you need, protect yourself from heat and enjoy the challenge — check out some other safety tips here. Dogs are not allowed on Summit Trail.\n\nIf you'd rather avoid the climb, the area around Piestewa Peak provides plenty of recreation and hiking opportunities. The 3.74-mile Freedom Trail (#302) encircles the base of the peak, while the Quartz Ridge Trail (#8A) climbs to connect with additional trails for views of the surrounding desert. For full descriptions of all hiking options, visit the Phoenix Parks and Recreation page for Piestewa/Dreamy Draw.\n\nThis area gets its name from the long walk miners would take home in the early twentieth century. While miners initially went looking for copper in the region, they instead found cinnabar, a mineral used to extract mercury. The neurotoxins from the mineral left miners in an inebriated — or \"dreamy\" — state, hence the name. Nowadays, the area is used for hiking and biking, and the original Dreamy Draw path is now Arizona State Route 51, which runs through central Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area (Main Entrance): 2701 E. Squaw Peak Drive\n\nDreamy Draw Recreation Area: 2421 E Northern Ave\n\n32nd Street Trailhead entrance: NE Corner of Lincoln Ave and 32nd St"
