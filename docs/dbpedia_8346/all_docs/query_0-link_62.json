        "text": "As quickly as this fall, we could have a hearing before the Jefferson County Planning Commission, a long-awaited decision on the proposed lift access commercial downhill mountain bike park aimed for a cherished meadow and mountainside on residential Shadow Mountain Drive. We thought it a good time to debunk just some of the consistent false assertions and misleading statements made publicly by the applicants, all of which are easily refuted by verifiable facts.\n\nFalse and misleading statements about fire hazard, evacuation realities: Once the park is built, residents and wildlife are safer from wildfire than they were before, much less of an ignition risk than it is today.\n\nFacts: The proposed bike park location has a National Fire Danger Rating of EXTREME, the highest wildfire-risk rating. Wildland Fire Management Information and U.S. Forest Service Research Data Archive data shows that nearly 84% of wildland fires in the United States are caused by humans, and the bike park would add up to 8000 potential fire igniters weekly that were not there before. The applicants have not prepared an evacuation study to ensure human lives aren’t lost in the case of a forest fire, whether on the bike park property or elsewhere on the mountain, with an estimated 300 additional cars in their parking area factored into Shadow Mountain Drive’s daily traffic. A former Jeffco sheriff puts it simply: you can’t put that many vehicles and people in that size space and not have something bad happen.\n\nTraffic safety misinformation: Applicant was requested to perform traffic studies at similar facilities by Jeffco Traffic and Engineering. Their response claims there are no other similar facilities.\n\nFacts: There are many other lift-access commercial downhill mountain bike parks for which comparison would be useful to understand impacts on our roadway system. The Institute of Transportation Engineers manuals say only that other facilities must be studied. It doesn’t say that they must be nearby or in a particular state. Getting good verifiable traffic numbers is critical, they are the underpinning of many other analyses, not just traffic impact. The bottom line here is that the traffic numbers cited by the applicant remain unverifiable guesses.\n\nFor ten years, Shadow Mountain’s history of crashes has been documented by Crash Analysis Studies completed by Jefferson County. In addition to the 2015 report, the 2021 Crash Analysis documented that Shadow Mountain Drive continues to experience a high number of crashes. We already have an average of nearly 2,000 cars per day on Shadow Mountain Drive. The proposed bike park would add approximately 1,000 more cars in and out on peak days.\n\nMisleading statements about capability to handle injuries: Applicants will have their own EMS resources/facility on site and do not believe the park will increase the current workload of local EMS resources.\n\nFacts: 70% of the calls at the already stressed Elk Creek Fire Protection District are for Emergency Medical Services. The study Mountain Biking Injuries and others show that during the proposed bike park’s peak season—with the projected 700 to 1,200 riders/day—the community can expect an average of 5 to 10 injuries per day with, on average, 1 to 2 riders per day requiring transport to the ER. However, injuries that require transport often occur in clusters, so local fire districts may become overwhelmed leaving the community at risk.\n\nThe time it would take for EMS to respond to an accident at the proposed bike park, transport the person to the nearest trauma one hospital and return to service would take several hours. During these hours the Conifer residents who pay property taxes would not be able to quickly obtain the medical care they may need.\n\nThe facts plainly show that the applicants’ proposal does not align with the vision and goals set forth by Jefferson County’s Comprehensive Master Plan and Conifer/285 Corridor Area Plan to guide healthy growth. For example, the Hazard Mitigation Plan states: “A key strategy for reducing future losses in a community is to avoid development in known hazard areas… The purpose of this strategy is to keep people, businesses, and buildings out of harm’s way before a hazard event occurs.”\n\nAfter 3.5 years of dealing with the applicants, what we have is an abundance of misleading statements omitting critical details, with way too many dangerous unknowns unanswered by the applicants that need to be known.\n\nWe are confident that Jefferson County will use its own official plans as intended — carefully designed directives to prevent irresponsible development – making sure that this bike park proposed for an ill-suited location will never mar the pristine surroundings and wildlife that live there, nor harm the well-being of the community along Shadow Mountain Drive and all those who travel through.\n\nPlease visit our website www.stopthebikepark.com for complete details and how you can help.\n\nLyle Dierks is a member of Stop the Bike Park, a non-profit organization formed specifically to preserve a pristine meadow and mountainside on residential Shadow Mountain Drive, threatened by a proposed commercial bike park and its fact-driven negative consequences to traffic, wildfire risk, emergency response, air and water quality, and key wildlife habitat. He is a 19-year Conifer resident in the Shadow Mountain Drive neighborhood."
