        "text": "To start out this hike on a trail not already discussed elsewhere on this blog, take Bear Grass (the second from the left above Selkirk Lodge). This is rated moderate on account of two 180-degree hairpin curves on the far side that look more intimidating than they are. Bear Grass emerges onto Junction #1 and is succeeded straight across by Blue Jay, which ascends gradually, grosses the wider Alpine trail and winds its way through open forest towards Junction #2. At that junction take the Eagle Crest trail (second from right), which is rated difficult as there are lots of switchbacks and every curve is very steep.\n\nThat effort is rewarded, however, with filtered views to the right, and, once the trail turns eastward, Mount Spokane. At the top of the knoll, sweeping views open up to the south and west. Then it’s downhill, again using sweeping switchbacks, to Nova Hut. Just before the hut take a left onto Lodgepole, then an immediate right onto Lookout. About a hundred yards downhill, Shady Way veers off to the left, but stay on Lookout for a bit longer. A couple hundred yards later the groomed trails leans to the right and becomes Abner’s Way. Continue uphill on Lookout, which may or may not be groomed.\n\nThe uphill to the lookout tower is pretty tedious when it isn’t groomed so you may want to check the grooming report and if it isn’t groomed pack your snowshoes. When I was up there the trail was not groomed, the poles virtually disappeared in the loose 3-to-4-foot deep snow and with temperatures far below freezing the frosted snow was slick and made for a difficult ascent. Much better with snowshoes!\n\nIt’s about a mile to the top. The trail is not terribly steep, more of a gradual incline, leading past old quarries and through pretty forests. The views up top are nothing short of breathtaking!\n\nOnce you’ve taken in the views, retrace your steps, which goes a whole lot easier going downhill on skis. Once you’re back at Nova Hut, follow the Lodgepole trail downhill for just a short bit, then turn sharply right at Junction #3 to turn this into a lollipop loop (the stick being the Quartz Mountain piece). This is an unnamed connector trail leading down to junction #4, where you’ll be taking a sharp left and follow the Hemlock Trail on a fun downhill run. Eventually the trail levels off, then starts climbing again towards Junction #2. Just before that junction you get to a T-intersection. To the right is a great downhill slope to the Linder Ridge trail (this is not marked on the Nordic Trail map; it is the route I took), while a left will get you to Junction #2. Here take a right and follow Sam’s Swoop, which ebbs and flows and then declines towards Junction #1. Any of the trails will return to the Selkirk Lodge from Junction #1."
