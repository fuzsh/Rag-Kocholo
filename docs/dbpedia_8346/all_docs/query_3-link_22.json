The famous Robert Trent Jones golf course was added to the park in 1973, advancing it to the status of a resort park. The park’s New North Lodge was opened on May 1st 2021 and the original (Now South) lodge renovations were completed in May of 2022.\n\nDining\n\nThe Prospects Restaurant, located in the park’s North Lodge, offers a variety of delectable menu selections. It’s open year-round and offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurant caters to banquets, receptions and barbecues for special groups like business meetings, family reunions and weddings.
