Imagine a camping experience that not only immerses you in nature's vastness but also offers a peek into history. Camping near Shadow Mountain Lookout, the last standing fire lookout in Rocky Mountain National Park, is just that. Erected in the 1930s, this rustic edifice once played a crucial role in identifying and observing forest fires. Although the Shadow Mountain Lookout Tower is off-limits for climbing, the surrounding environment more than makes up for it. The trail leading to the lookout is a treat for all campers, offering expansive views of Shadow Mountain Lake, Grand Lake, and Lake Granby. Picture waking up in the morning, unzipping your tent, and embarking on a scenic hike that unfolds panoramic views of these three magnificent lakes. The journey becomes even more spectacular during the autumn months. The trail transforms into an artist's palette as trees begin to showcase their fall colors. A kaleidoscope of vibrant hues reflected in the tranquil waters of the lakes presents a sight to cherish. You can access the trail leading to the lookout from either the Grand Lake or Shadow Mountain Dam trailheads for the East Shore Trail. Camping near Shadow Mountain Lookout thus presents a unique opportunity: to embrace the splendid natural scenery and explore a piece of fire service history.
