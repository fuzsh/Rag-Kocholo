On the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park, in an opening in the piney forest, stands a fire lookout built in the 1930s.

The Shadow Mountain Lookout is the only lookout remaining in the park. During a recent visit to Rocky Mountain, I followed the 5-mile-long trail to the lookout, where I ran into Barbara and John Varian and discussed both the hike and the lookout with them.
