1930: "About 3 1/2 miles of emergency line was built from Grand Lake ranger station to the temporary Shadow Mountain fire lookout above Grand Lake." "Shadow Mountain Trail, 3 1/4 miles.-- A good grade of fire trail was completed from Pole Creek Road to the top of Shadow Mountain, where a fire-lookout building will be erected next year. It is already proving popular with park visitors." (Report of the Director of the National Park Service)

January 23, 1931: "A trail to Shadow mountain was built and a temporary look-out was established there last season. Next season we plan to build a permanent fire lookout station on this mountain, which will serve a large part of Arapaho forests as well as the west side of the national park." (Steamboat Pilot)
