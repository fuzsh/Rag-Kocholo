Deborah Orr, the award-winning journalist and i columnist, has died of cancer at the age of 57, it was announced last night.

Orr, who is survived by her sons Ivan and Luther, and her stepchildren, Lex and Maddie, was born in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, in 1962. She married novelist and journalist Will Self in 1997. The couple separated in 2017.

Friend and former colleague Catherine Bennett, the Observer columnist, described Orr as “one of the cleverest, most unconventional, most fearless people on the planet”.

Novelist Andrew O’Hagan, another former colleague, told the Guardian: “She was completely inspiring and never knowingly not difficult, but she had a huge heart.”

TV presenter and writer Rachel Johnson last night described her as “the warrior queen of journalism” who died too soon.

i‘s acting managing editor Barbara Speed, who edited her columns when she joined the paper, said: “Deborah started writing columns for i in 2018 and was an immediate hit with readers for her sense of justice and empathy, and her no-nonsense approach.

“She was a pleasure to edit and work with for the same reasons. We will miss her and her writing enormously.”

i arts editor Alice Jones said: “Such a loss. Always slightly terrifying to commission, made up for by the joy of getting her scintillating copy back.

“Her zeal when she liked or was interested in something was terrific.”

Her book of memoirs, called Motherwell after her home town, is set to be published next year. Early reviews were glowing.

Her death was confirmed by her family, who asked for privacy.
