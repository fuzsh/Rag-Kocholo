        "text": "I'm never likely to find out what it's like when your novel is up for the Booker Prize. But I now know what it's like when your husband's is. I'm married to Will Self, author of Umbrella, and on Tuesday he came tantalisingly close to winning. In fact, for a delightful few minutes I was absolutely sure he had won.\n\nThe chair of the judges, Peter Stothard, had said in his speech leading up to the grand announcement how exciting it was that a \"new name\" would be joining the list of Booker winners. Hilary Mantel, with Bring Up the Bodies, had been the other front-runner. But she'd won before. So it was genuinely dumbfounding when it turned out that no new name was to be added after all.\n\nPerhaps it was a slip of the tongue. Perhaps it had been silly to read so much into it. Whatever, that moment of pure certainty was wonderful, and the moment of total disillusionment that swiftly followed, terrible. It was a prime example of how manipulative the Booker process is. One starts out pleased to be long-listed, and ends up feeling anything other than winning is failure.\n\nI'm aware that I'm writing as if it had been me who'd been nominated. Frankly, that's how it felt. When you're the spouse of a creative artist, you have no choice but to accept the task of helping to facilitate their work (or leave). For me, that role was particularly hard while Will was writing Umbrella. He was already deeply involved in it when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nBut when Will has assembled a book in his head, it's like a baby assembled in a womb. It has to come out. It's nature. Nothing can stop it. I know that. I'm used to it.\n\nAs I lay in bed, day after day, sick and listless, passively letting chemotherapy drugs get on with attacking the cancer cells, I would stare at the ceiling of the bedroom, above which my husband was pounding away on his typewriter. I felt completely alone. Will was upstairs with the people he cared about most in the world, Audrey De'ath and Zack fucking Busner. Yet, they didn't even exist.\n\nWhen he was spent from that day's effort, he would come and ask me if I wanted a cup of tea. Er, yes. I did. Looking a bit shifty, he'd usually say he was sorry – sorry too that he was once again about to indulge his compulsion to discuss how painful he was finding the writing of this book, how uncertain he was that it was working, how worried he was that no one would want to read it, and – most annoying of all – how profoundly drained and exhausted he found himself when he had written all that he could for the day. Profoundly drained and exhausted? Hello!\n\nLater, when I'd recovered a bit, when I was noticing things again, I remarked to Will that he looked sunburned, which was strange because he usually just goes brown. He'd noticed that, too, he said – probably just ageing though. \"No, Will. People don't redden as they age. Go to the doctor. Now.\" Our GP said right away that he thought it was a rare blood disease, but that there would have to be tests. Bingo: Polycythaemia vera. Eventually fatal, if untreated, but even in the early stages, highly physically debilitating. It wasn't writing Umbrella that had been exhausting Will. It had been the effort of his heart, pumping his own thickening blood around his body.\n\nThe book still got done, but we both knew Umbrella was not going to be everyone's idea of a rip-roaring read. I dreaded publication. People think that someone like Will – high-profile, perceived as successful – is an unassailable part of the cultural landscape. Maybe that's so. But it doesn't stop fear. I don't think he could cope with having all those stories invading his mind, expressing them in words, then not being able to get them published. That fear is not so irrational. His last work of fiction, Walking to Hollywood, was barely reviewed and sold in tiny numbers. If the same fate had befallen Umbrella, well, things could have started to look tricky.\n\nBut the first ever comment that we saw in print about Umbrella tipped it as a possible Booker winner. It was long-listed before it had even been published. Then the reviews started appearing. Will's books tend to divide the critics, spectacularly. This time, for the first time since his debut collection of short stories, The Quantity Theory of Insanity, they were uniformly laudatory. \"Oh, please God, in whom we don't believe, please God put Umbrella on the shortlist and we will be happy. Please God, just that, and we will never ask for anything again. Amen.\"\n\nUmbrella made the shortlist, and that was fantastic. That was enough. Except that the six weeks between shortlist and announcement is a long time. You get used to being in the top six. You start thinking: \"Maybe it could win. Something has to win.\" I'd read most of the other shortlisted books. I knew it was a good list. But I realised it was between Self and Mantel. For me, Bring Up the Bodies was by definition a less original book than Wolf Hall, because it was a sequel. And Stothard did keep banging on about originality …\n\nI became sure that the criteria set out by the judges this year described Umbrella so well that no other book could win. Daft. Mantel's as-yet unfinished trilogy is a wholly original endeavour, each part a microcosm of the whole, as original as the other two. I'd been lulled into false hope by my own faulty logic.\n\nOn Tuesday night, that hurt. By Wednesday morning, the whole winning-the-Booker thing had become a slightly mad distraction that we'd been foolish to succumb to. Will's fiction is always in some way a rejection of conventional literary narrative, none more so than this novel. Umbrella winning the Booker would have been weird, a category error, like a goat winning Best Sheep.\n\nA photograph of the six shortlisted writers has been doing the rounds on Twitter. I love it more than any photograph I have ever seen of my much-photographed husband. He is holding his Umbrella aloft, a metre above the heads of his fellows, who keep their novels close to their chests. In it, Will wins. He is instantly recognisable as the most original, the funniest, and most importantly, the tallest of the bunch. He's fulsomely engaging in the Booker-publicity circus, and simultaneously undermining the whole thing, taking all of its pretensions to marketing-sponsorship-and-sales-as-high-seriousness, and making them hilariously absurd.\n\nThe thing about Will is that he can never lose, not properly, because he's never competing, not really. He's doing his own thing, completely on his own, obsessed, sometimes tortured, always driven. People who don't get it? Well, that's their problem, an avoidable problem that they bring entirely on themselves."
