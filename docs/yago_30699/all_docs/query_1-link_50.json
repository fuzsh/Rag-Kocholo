        "text": "I Said to the Wanting Creature\n\nI said to the wanting-creature inside me:\n\nWhat is this river you want to cross?\n\nThere are no travelers on the river-road, and no road.\n\nDo you see anyone moving about on that bank, or nesting?\n\nThere is no river at all, and no boat, and no boatman.\n\nThere is no tow rope either, and no one to pull it.\n\nThere is no ground, no sky, no time, no bank, no ford!\n\nAnd there is nobody, and no mind!\n\nDo you believe there is some place that will make the\n\nsoul less thirsty?\n\nIn that great absence, you will find nothing.\n\nBe strong then, and enter into your own body;\n\nthere you have a solid place for your feet.\n\nThink about it carefully!\n\nDon’t go off somewhere else!\n\nKabir says this: just throw away all thoughts of imaginary\n\nthings, and stand firm in that which you are.\n\nKabir (trans Robert Bly)\n\nwhat it means\n\nThe speaker addresses the part of himself that wants/desires/craves. He says to that part that there is no place “where the soul is less thirsty”: there’s no place where those cravings will go away. Instead of trying to rush off to a better place, know yourself and be content.\n\nwhy I like the poem\n\nI find the tone of this poem delightful. The speaker chastises himself while being full of wonder. Normally, I’m not a fan of exclamation points, but here the speaker just feels so full of wow! wow! that I didn’t mind them.\n\ncraft\n\nThis is one of the poems that Dia and I picked for our epiphanic article, so here’s a preview of what we’ll be talking about. This poem follows the five-step model we uncovered for making a powerful poem that centers around an epiphany.\n\nStep 1: ground the speaker in the real world\n\n“There are no travelers on the river-road, and no road.\n\nDo you see anyone moving about on that bank, or nesting?”\n\nAll of this happens in a real word of rivers, roads, banks, nesting birds.\n\nStep 2: Make a bridge into a whirl\n\n“What is this river you want to cross?”\n\nIn this case, he literally uses the word “cross.” It’s a literal crossing, but it’s also a crossing between states of mind, moving to an out-of-body/out of mind experience.\n\nStep 3: The whirl\n\n“There is no river at all, and no boat, and no boatman.\n\nThere is no tow rope either, and no one to pull it.\n\nThere is no ground, no sky, no time, no bank, no ford!\n\nAnd there is nobody, and no mind!”\n\nIn this whirl, the entire real world has been erased as well as the body and the mind. We are gone, gone, gone.\n\nStep 4: The epiphany\n\n“Do you believe there is some place that will make the\n\nsoul less thirsty?\n\nIn that great absence, you will find nothing.\n\nBe strong then, and enter into your own body;\n\nthere you have a solid place for your feet.\n\nThink about it carefully!\n\nDon’t go off somewhere else!”\n\nThis is what the speaker has now realized: There is no better place. You’ve got make it work right here.\n\nStep 5: Return to the everyday\n\n“Kabir says this: just throw away all thoughts of imaginary\n\nthings, and stand firm in that which you are.”\n\nSuddenly another voice enters the poem. It’s like someone has been observing the speaker all this time and now speaks up. The speaker is no longer alone in the ungrounded land of epiphany.\n\nStay tuned for all the methods we discovered for these 5 steps.\n\nFrom the Desire Field\n\nwhat it means\n\nTwo lovers are in bed together. The speaker has anxiety and insomnia. She’s going to cope with them by reframing. Because she trembles with anxiety, she’ll call it “desire” instead. She says her mind at night is like a beast wandering the fields. She tries to reframe insomnia as something beautiful like spring. Near the end of the poem, she stops trying to cope on her own and asks her lover to help her, to tell her a story that will help her go to sleep.\n\nYou can look at something awful and see it as beautiful.\n\nIt's ok to admit you need help and to accept it.\n\nwhy I like the poem\n\nDid you find this poem completely incomprehensible on the first reading? I did. I often talk to friends (looking at you Jim) about the difference between hard poetry that is hard because it’s poorly written gobbledygook and hard because it asks the reader to think hard, to read slowly and carefully, to believe the poem will reveal itself to you with enough effort. That’s frankly why I like this poem. I found it hard, but the more I worked at it, the more I figured out until it blossomed in front of me. I’ve started asking my friends to guide me through fields of art they know well (still looking at you Jim) and trust me when I say they can understand a good hard poem with some support from their trusty poetry guide.\n\ncraft\n\nDid I mention that Dia and are writing a book (very early stages) where we share craft moves we learned from reading other poets? Here’s a sample page based on this poem.\n\nCraft move: Imply the premise.\n\nSection of the book it goes in: Leaps\n\nExample: “From the Desire Field” by Nathalie Diaz\n\nI don’t call it sleep anymore.\n\nI’ll risk losing something new instead—\n\nAnalysis:\n\nHere the logical argument she is making is: calling something by its name means you risk losing it. She starts by saying what she won’t do given that premise: I don’t call it sleep anymore. And then what she will do because of that premise: I’ll risk losing something new instead—\n\nShe never says the premise. The reader has to infer it. This is also an incredible way to sneak in a wisdom statement; you assume its truth.\n\nDebby’s Tries\n\nPremise: counting 5 things you see can stop you from killing yourself.\n\nI take a breath and say out loud:\n\nyellow leaf in the driveway\n\nsongbird\n\nbright red Japanese maple by the front stairs\n\nthe brass knob set too high\n\nthe yellow door\n\nI repeat for as long as it takes—\n\nscorching seconds, frozen hours.\n\nI want to live.\n\nDB\n\nPremise: If you knock on the stranger’s door, you risk becoming a new person.\n\nWe have new neighbors.\n\nI won’t risk changing my life.\n\nDB\n\nMoses\n\nGive me your hand. We have to cross\n\nthe river and my strength fails me.\n\nHold me as if I were an abandoned package\n\nin a wicker basket, a lump that moves\n\nand cries in the twilight. Cross the river\n\nwith me. Even if this time the waters\n\ndon't part before us. Even if this time God\n\ndoesn't come to our aid and a flurry of arrows\n\nriddles our backs. Even if there is no river.\n\nLuis Alberto de Cuenca\n\nTranslated from the Spanish by Gustavo Pérez Firmat\n\nwhat it means\n\nThere is an unnamed threat. Maybe a persecution, a war, but we are not safe here, and we need to escape. I ask you to help me make it to a new place and to come with me. Even if the story we are telling ourselves is not true in all its facts, it’s emotionally true; we need to escape.\n\nWe are as precious as Moses. We might not be named by God as important, but we are important.\n\nwhy I like the poem\n\nI feel so much love in this poem. That first line “give me your hand” is a command, but a command to be together. Same with “hold me.” I also really like this way of using the Bible. The writer assumes we all know about Moses being left in a basket in the bullrushes. The poem builds off that background knowledge.\n\ncraft\n\nThat last line blows my mind. You mean you are allowed to undercut the facts you just laid out? This is not the cop-out of “it was all a dream.” This is like the energy of being thrust off the earth into a new equally valid but much stranger space.\n\nThere’s also a lot of cool duplicating with variation in here. Like “We have to cross the river” becomes “cross the river with me” and the three “even ifs.”\n\nFairy-tale Logic\n\nFairy tales are full of impossible tasks:\n\nGather the chin hairs of a man-eating goat,\n\nOr cross a sulphuric lake in a leaky boat,\n\nSelect the prince from a row of identical masks,\n\nTiptoe up to a dragon where it basks\n\nAnd snatch its bone; count dust specks, mote by mote,\n\nOr learn the phone directory by rote.\n\nAlways it’s impossible what someone asks—\n\nYou have to fight magic with magic. You have to believe\n\nThat you have something impossible up your sleeve,\n\nThe language of snakes, perhaps, an invisible cloak,\n\nAn army of ants at your beck, or a lethal joke,\n\nThe will to do whatever must be done:\n\nMarry a monster. Hand over your firstborn son.\n\nA.E. Stallings\n\nwhat it means\n\nFairytales ask us to do impossible tasks, but we are up to the challenge with our own magic or will to do the excruciating.\n\nSometimes to survive we betray ourselves.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nI like mythology and fairy tales, and I like that Stallings knows this world so well she can write authoritatively in the voice of any of the characters or about the genre as a whole. I heard her read this fall, and she was witty and wise. I feel the poem is the same way. It taught me something new about fairy tales and then the ending does this fabulous turn from cheerful to devastating.\n\ncraft\n\nStallings is all about form. She only writes in form, but some how she makes it seem effortless. This sonnet doesn’t feel forced, no weak rhymes. I love the conversational tone. I am a little surprised at the capitalization of the first words. That seems a bit old school for the tone of this poem, but, of course, fairy tales are very old school.\n\nUnder the River Go the Faces of Everyone I Have Ever Loved\n\nI think the world broke a world record today\n\nFor the number of people in it who cried.\n\nIggy Pop cried, as did most of Greenland.\n\nFive hundred babies cried at exactly 2:43 AM\n\nAnd another five hundred at 2:44. The President\n\nHas a secret room where he likes to go shed tears.\n\nNot even the Secret service know about it.\n\nWhat if I told you the President called me up\n\nCrying. He did. I told him, Buck up, little tomato.\n\nTalent scouts cried at the dearth of talent.\n\nFrogs got the blues bad in the chemical bog.\n\nWorst of all were the spilled milk drinkers\n\nWho sobbed like it was the end of the world. It was.\n\nWhen the devil cries, he sheds tears of real diamonds.\n\nThe contestant eliminated for making\n\nA bland risotto cried, but thanked everyone\n\nFor the opportunity to cry. I got a surprise call\n\nFrom my ex, who never calls, calling me in tears,\n\nSomething about her new husband’s prognosis.\n\nYou could hear him in the background, banging\n\nAround, lumbering, swearing to anyone how he\n\nWas going to the kitchen to make some goddam eggs.\n\nThat’s their secret passcode for baby, let’s fuck.\n\nYou cried that time your pearl of toothpaste fell\n\nOff its toothbrush and landed in the pedestal sink,\n\nAnd you cried that time your car hit a mama deer\n\nAnd it’s gotten to the point like you and me and everyone\n\nI know and even half-know, have been crying ever since.\n\nJohn Loughlin\n\nCopper Nickel\n\nUnder the River Go the Faces of Everyone I Have Ever Loved\n\nJohn Loughlin\n\nwhat it means\n\nHere we are with the whole world in tears, the death of everyone we have ever loved.\n\nI’m not sure what it means. Here’s a guess. Yeah, the stupid pop culture stuff we cry over like losing a reality cooking contest on tv is stupid and fake, but it’s not. It’s part of the general despair and sadness we are all feeling as we get the terminal diagnosis for ourselves and the planet.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nDare I say it. This poem is funny. I mean, yes, I know it’s all about crying and everyone I know and half-know going under the river, but Iggy Pop? That’s funny. Buck up little tomato is really funny. I love how this poem can be both hilarious and devastating at the same time.\n\ncraft\n\nSo, on the one hand I’m a strong advocate for concrete details and on the other hand, magic realism delights me. Those babies, the president. . . the author is making these details up to convey the enormity of the whole world in tears.\n\nI can imagine the author, journal in hand, pulling out random notes about the day the ex called, and a half remembered image of a pearl of toothpaste and letting them all find their way into this poem. I want to jam as much disparate stuff, as much real and unreal into one poem.\n\nMagdalene—The Seven Veils\n\nMarie Howe\n\nwhat it means\n\nMary Magdalene, the prostitute in the Bible that Jesus embraced as one of his disciples, is explaining the devils in her. The devils are the types of things that happen to us all—worry, compulsion, fear that no one would understand you.\n\nWe are all plagued by devils.\n\nMary Magdalene is not so different from any of us.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nDon’t you love the idea of busyness as a devil? And of course, worry. She had me right there.\n\nI can’t say Howe is my new favorite poet because I’ve been reading and loving her work since I read her book What the Living Do some time in the late nineties. But Howe is certainly my current role model because she does in this book exactly what I’m trying to do in my new book—retell a Biblical story in poetry with lots of modern references thrown in. I find this poem funny, conversational, and giving me new insights into what a devil is and how it works in your life.\n\ncraft\n\nI like how this poem sets up the context in the title and epigram and then jumps right in. This taking a Biblical figure and mixing in modern day stuff as though that woman is living right here in our world—that is exactly what I’m trying to do in my work, so it gives me great permission to see her doing it.\n\nI’m fascinated by how she revisits the seven devils, but they keep changing. It would have never occurred to me to do that.\n\nApocrypha of Light\n\nOn the first day, light said\n\nLet there be God.\n\nAnd there was God.\n\nLight needed shape to move inside,\n\na likeness tawny and thick-maned.\n\nIt strode into the absence we call night\n\nand what it tongued\n\nsparked visible then glowed,\n\nwarmed by its golden spittle.\n\nIt splashed and rolled in water\n\ntill rivers and seas could not be parted\n\nfrom its gleam. It lingered\n\non the hourglass\n\nof August pears; on blackbird,\n\nbear scat, calves’ blood;\n\non the hand of the beloved,\n\nit’s unlikely flare.\n\nIt went everywhere, glossed all\n\nthat waited to be seen. At last\n\nit slipped into the farthest corner –\n\nthere, it stumbled. Stopped.\n\nHid its brightness and would not move.\n\nWhat in the dark did it wish it hadn’t found?\n\nNot arbutus limbs, an otter’s head\n\njust above the sea; not orange pips,\n\nfish fin, a panther’s muscled plush.\n\nNow you make a list of things.\n\nRemember light’s likeness, remember\n\nthis is the beginning of the first day.\n\nLorna Crozier\n\nwhat it means\n\nThis is an origin myth about the start of the world except in this version Light is the originator and makes God as well as everything else. Light is powerful but not all powerful.\n\nWe all need to make an origin myth. We all need to know what is in our dark.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nRachel Rose suggested I read Crozier after I told her I was working on poems about the Bible. So, I like that Crozier’s taken on this same project. I happen to love Bible stories and origin myths and variations there of. I like this image of the initial power of the world being like a lion licking us into being. But, I picked this poem for the “Now you make a list of things.” That line gives me shivers every time, how it turns to the reader and makes them think about what in the dark they wish they hadn’t found.\n\ncraft\n\nWell, that line “Now you make a list of things” is breaking the fourth wall. How often do I turn and address the reader? Never. The lists she makes of where light lands and where it doesn’t are so interesting. She jumps from the natural world to the hand of the beloved from the quotidian orange pips to the romantic and powerful panther. Poems are supposed to juxtapose and surprise us like this. Note to self.\n\nIf to say it once\n\nAnd once only, then still\n\nTo say: Yes.\n\nAnd say it complete,\n\nSay it as if the word\n\nFilled the whole moment\n\nWith its absolute saying.\n\nLater for “but,”\n\nLater for “if.”\n\nNow\n\nOnly the single syllable\n\nThat is the beloved,\n\nThat is the world.\n\nGregory Orr\n\n[untitled]\n\nGregory Orr\n\nwhat it means\n\nSay yes. Open your whole heart. Drop all your fears and hesitations. Say yes to love. Say yes to loving the world and being a part of the world. God is yes.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nGregory Orr is my new favorite poet. I know I said that about Jess, but they both thrill me in different ways. And they are both doing exactly want I want to do as a poet. Unlike Jess who brings in history, politics, identity, as well as the playwright’s craft of creating characters and a narrative, Orr, in this book at least, is all worship. Every poem is a prayer. He reminds me a lot of Ladinsky’s translations of Hafiz, just ecstatic yes.\n\nLike prayer, this poem reminds me of my deepest values. This is how I want to be in the world. I don’t want to be caught by petty insecurities or even real doubts and fears. I want to throw myself open to the beloved in an ecstatic yes.\n\ncraft\n\nOk, my next goal is to write a poem with this level of authority in the speaker’s voice. I mean the audacity of just telling the reader how to be at the deepest spiritual level. I also like the short words and short lines. One craft element you won’t realize from this poem alone is really this entire book is one poem. The individual poems aren’t titled and the book is called How Beautiful the Beloved. I highly recommend it.\n\nThe Golden Shovel\n\nThe Golden Shovel\n\nTerrance Hayes\n\nwhat it means\n\nIn the first section, a father and son are out exploring the night, including a pool hall. They witness a neighbor hit his son. We learn this is discipline for the types of behavior that eventually end this boy up in prison or possibly for defending his ma. I got confused in that part. But this section ends with the father and son praying together to survive.\n\nIn the second section, I’m not sure what’s going on. Is this homeless people in a tent city? It’s much more imagistic than narrative. “Born lost and cool/er than heartache.” I don’t know what this means, but it makes me think African American, homeless, young hip and denied.\n\nThis is what it’s like to be Black in America.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nI love this father and son. I got caught up in their lives, hoping they would make it. I’m always fond of getting stories, especially of lives I don’t know, through poetry. The second stanza feels more like listening to music: it moves me but I don’t understand lines like “What we/break is what we hold. A sing-/ular blue note.” And then, I really like this poem for the craft.\n\ncraft\n\nHayes invented a new form called a Golden Shovel. I’m guessing a lot of you know the Gwendolyn Brooks’ poem “We Real Cool.” Here it is:\n\nWe Real Cool\n\nTHE POOL PLAYERS.\n\nSEVEN AT THE GOLDEN SHOVEL.\n\nWe real cool. We\n\nLeft school. We\n\nLurk late. We\n\nStrike straight. We\n\nSing sin. We\n\nThin gin. We\n\nJazz June. We\n\nDie soon.\n\nNow, look at the last word of every line in Hayes’ poem. If you read down, you will read this poem. And, oh my gosh, he does it twice. First, I love the magic of that crafting. I’ve tried to write a golden shovel and, as often happens with form, it helps you say things you hadn’t expected. But I also like how the two poems talk to each other, how you have a second layer of meaning to the Hayes poem because the Brooks poem is embedded in it.\n\nWhat is Known\n\nfor my brother Michael\n\nthe office my desk phone\n\nringing our mother’s voice the news\n\nthe office my desk phone ringing\n\nour mother’s voice\n\nthe news in my hand the office desk\n\nphone ringing mother’s voice in my hand\n\nher voice in my hand ringing\n\nour mother her voice the news\n\nringing ringing\n\nElizabeth Austen\n\nWhat is Known\n\nElizabeth Austen\n\nwhat it means\n\nA woman answers the phone. Her mother is calling to tell her her brother has died. I’m not sure you can get all that from this poem alone, but I read the poem as part of Austen’s book, Every Dress a Decision, and poems about the death are interspersed so eventually a fuller picture emerges.\n\nShock, death, grief create gaps in our lives. We don’t flow as we normally do. We speak and think in stutter stops and in fragments.\n\nDeath is so huge we cannot grasp it, so we grasp at tiny objects and sounds to ground ourselves.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nI’ve known about Austen for years because when I first came to Seattle, I took her workshop on reading poetry out loud—so helpful. She was recently the Washington State poet laureate and taught a workshop I went to on making great titles. All this has little to do with why I like this poem, but I just want to say, I like her whole book, Every Dress a Decision, and I just picked this poem.\n\nLove, death. . . poets struggle to write about the big topics without being redundant, boring, or cliché. I think this poem does so.\n\ncraft\n\nSimple words, repetition, white space in the lines, lack of punctuation. I mean, for heaven’s sake, this poem only has eight main words. How is it possible to tell so much with so little? The repetition reflects the speaker’s inability to find the words to talk about her brother’s death. The white spaces hold all that she isn’t saying. And the lack of punctuation reiterates that there is no control or closure over this moment.\n\nIf by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck\n\nin your heel, the wetness of a finished lollipop stick,\n\nthe surprise of a thumbtack in your purse—\n\nthen Yes, every last page is true, every nuance,\n\nbit, and bite. Wait. I have made them up—all of them—\n\nand when I say I am married, it means I married\n\nall of them, a whole neighborhood of past loves.\n\nCan you imagine the number of bouquets, how many\n\nslices of cake? Even now, my husbands plan a great meal\n\nfor us—one chops up some parsley, one stirs a bubbling pot\n\non the stove. One changes the baby, and one sleeps\n\nin a fat chair. One flips through the newspaper, another\n\nwhistles while he shaves in the shower, and every single\n\none of them wonders what time I am coming home.\n\nAimee Nezhukumatathil\n\nAre All the Break-Ups in Your Poems Real?\n\nAimee Nezhukumatathil\n\nwhat it means\n\nThe poet is asked the age-old question: did you make this up? First, she chastises the questioner: even if the details are made up, every dang emotion is real, and that’s what matters, right? Right?! Then, she answers flippantly that it is also real that she married all those men she broke up with and imagines her life with them all.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nShe’s just having so much fun with this poem. I can’t wait to try the exercise, imagine what my ten husbands are doing around the house right now. And that last line is such a zinger, turning what seems like a rather nice fantasy into a not so nice one. This poem feels a bit like a stand-up comedy routine.\n\ncraft\n\nI love the sounds in this poem just listen to “shark tooth stuck” all one syllable, all jabbing at you. And then “stuck” ends one line, “stick” the next, such fun with language. Did you notice this is a sonnet? Well, a blank verse sonnet. It doesn’t rhyme, but it does take some wild flights of fancy and contain them.\n\nSix Years After My First Son’s Death\n\n​\n\nAt my younger son’s baseball practice,\n\na dad talks about his two boys—\n\nall that energy and wrestling at bedtime.\n\nI know I should use the old bread\n\nwhen I make my son a sandwich,\n\nbut I open the new.\n\nIt’s wasteful.\n\nLike the hours I spent\n\npumping milk for my dead son.\n\nMemories of my two boys\n\nflash like reflections\n\noff windshields.\n\nThe two of them jumping on the bed,\n\nshrieking with joy,\n\nuntil they broke the lamp—\n\nshards of glass.\n\nLight\n\nwasted all over the floor.\n\nChanel Brenner\n\nSugar House Review\n\nSix Years After My First Son’s Death\n\nChanel Brenner\n\nwhat it means\n\nA mother has lost a son, but you knew that from the title. A mother resents a man whose sons are still alive. Is it really wasteful to have poured time, love, and energy into someone who then dies? Yeah, I don’t think she really thinks so, but these lines\n\nLike the hours I spent\n\npumping milk for my dead son.\n\nfeel like a flash of anger at the universe for taking her son.\n\nThat “waste” that shows up three different ways in the poem is giving me shivers. What does it mean that the light has been wasted? It is a wrong that cannot be corrected.\n\nAnger. Resentment. The beauty of brothers.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nWell, you know I have an affinity for plain spoken poems, grounded in the real with strong imagery to carry the emotions. That pretty much describes this poem.\n\nThe tiny detail of wasting the bread to give this remaining son the very very best breaks my heart along with the self-castigation for doing so.\n\ncraft\n\nHow do you write about the unspeakable? This poem tackles the death of a son. I’m not sure I could write about such a topic without overwhelming myself and the reader with emotion. This poem uses small moments and symbols to carry the emotions a bit more quietly while still being devastating.\n\nI’ve recently been to a title workshop, and I’m fascinated by this one. It sets the scene, creates an expectation, does tons of emotional work, so the poem can zoom in on little details.\n\nx obeys algebraic laws,\n\nbut resists particularity.\n\nIt’s the placeholder of uncertainty\n\nlike the notion of God.\n\nA variable, a kiss, a chromosome, x signs\n\nlegal documents in two concise strokes.\n\nIt could be me, you, or the number of poppies\n\nwe planted out back by the fence last Sunday.\n\nAfter so many days of rain, the afternoon\n\nwas sunlit, translucent. Perfect as an integer.\n\nMary Peelen\n\nQuantum Heresies\n\nX\n\nMary Peelen\n\nwhat it means\n\nThe symbol x means something in math, but it also means many different things in the real world. Math is not distinct from God, nature, and love.\n\nAbstract intellectual thought is not distinct from the real world.\n\nYou are my beloved.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nI believe it. There’s a certain authority to this voice (and if I knew how she created it, I’d be all over it) where I believe what she has to say about math and God. I also like how it moves from a philosophical discussion to basically a prayer of thanksgiving for a perfect day with the beloved.\n\nabout the book\n\nMath as trustworthy parent. Math as infinite gorgeous support. What a delightful surprise for those who might fear math. In these poems, numbers come alive and math lets us see the beauty and devastation in the world, connects us to faith, and interweaves with all aspects of being human.\n\ncraft\n\nCheck out these line breaks:\n\nIt’s the placeholder\n\nof uncertainty\n\nlike the notion of\n\nGod.\n\nEvery time the poem moves to a new line, I am surprised.\n\nI’m intrigued by the “you.” I tend not to address some unknown you, but here the next few lines clearly establish the “you” as someone who shares a house and probably a life with the speaker. I’m going to try bring in a “you” late in a poem.\n\nMy review of her book Quantum Heresies is up onthe Adroit Journal.\n\nRuby’s Bar Graph\n\nRuby inserts Justin Timberlake’s photo behind the creaky plastic window in her wallet, so each time she opens it, she can hear him singing God must’ve spent a little more time on you. She memorizes his birthday (1/31/81), favorite color (baby blue), favorite word (crunk), and parents’ names (Lynn and Charles Randall). During study hall, Ruby makes a bar graph of how much time God has spent on her classmates, where x = hours and y = beauty. On you on you on you, you, Justin sings, lifting his arm to point at her.\n\nLisa Low\n\npublished in Waxwing\n\nRuby’s Bar Graph\n\nLisa Low\n\nwhat it means\n\nA Junior High girl has a crush on a teen idol. She uses the crush to enhance her self image.\n\nThe route to loving ourselves is not always smart or good.\n\nWe all need to find a way to love ourselves.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nAll the concrete banal details crack me up, and I believed them.\n\nI suppose you want me to say something wise about why this works as a prose poem and what actually a prose poem is, but I’m stumped. I don’t know why we’d call this a prose poem and not a mini-story for instance. It doesn’t matter to me. No matter what, the final image slays me every time. My heart beats a little faster, and I start to cry when Justin points to her.\n\nI happen to like poems that are plain spoken and easy to read while still packing an emotional wallop.\n\ncraft\n\nI love that this is a story poem not an “I” poem. That distance gives me room to hate and love Ruby a little more. I have no idea if Low made Ruby up, but I hope so. I imagine her pulling details from her own life and the heart wrenching agony of being a preteen to create Ruby.\n\nLow is being very careful with syntax. Every sentence is a different music.\n\nCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude\n\nCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude\n\nRoss Gay\n\nwhat it means\n\nGratitude overall, even in the face of drug abuse, inner city rot, mental illness. Notice the world and be grateful. Notice your friends and be grateful. Notice the small kindnesses strangers do for each other and be grateful. There is so so much to be grateful for.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nI heard Ross Gay read at the Seattle Arts & Lectures series, and it was joy beginning to end. He grinned the whole time. He told us about his gratitude journal. He told us about the garden he helped build in the inner city. I just wanted to hang out with him the rest of my life.\n\nI mean how can you not get happy with a line like “the compost writhe giddy and lick its lips” or this:\n\nI can’t stop\n\nmy gratitude, which includes, dear reader,\n\nyou, for staying here with me,\n\nfor moving your lips just so as I speak.\n\nHere is a cup of tea. I have spooned honey into it\n\nAnyone offers me honey, I’m there. And even though I did get tired reading this poem, how can I resist when he knows it too but can’t help himself because he is so full of gratitude?\n\ncraft\n\nHe is breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the reader. I still don’t think this is a typical technique, but now, I really want to try it.\n\nThis is a really long poem, and one of the things I want to learn is how to write long poems. One way is long sentences. Notice that first stanza uses lots of fabulous diction to twist and turn its way through one question. He also uses those semi-colons for all their worth. I suspect that he kept the gratitude journal for years and then plumbed it for moments to put in this poem. I think he might have also kept a “things that make me miserable” journal and found ways to be grateful for them.\n\nmartha promise receives leadbelly, 1935\n\nwhen your man comes home from prison,\n\nwhen he comes back like the wound\n\nand you are the stitch,\n\nwhen he comes back with pennies in his pocket\n\nand prayer fresh on his lips,\n\nyou got to wash him down first.\n\nyou got to have the wildweed and treebark boiled\n\nand calmed, waiting for his skin like a shining baptism\n\nback into what he was before gun barrels and bars\n\nchewed their claim in his hide and spit him\n\nstumbling backwards into screaming sunlight.\n\nyou got to scrub loose the jailtime fingersmears\n\nfrom ashy skin, lather down the cuffmarks\n\nfrom ankle and wrist, rinse solitary’s stench loose\n\nfrom his hair, scrape curse and confession\n\nfrom the welted and the smooth,\n\nthe hard and the soft,\n\nthe furrowed and the lax.\n\nyou got to hold tight that shadrach’s face\n\nbetween your palms, take crease and lid\n\nand lip and brow and rinse slow with river water,\n\nand when he opens his eyes\n\nyou tell him calm and sure\n\nhow a woman birthed him\n\nback whole again.\n\nTyahimba Jess\n\nmartha promise receives leadbelly, 1935\n\nTyehimba Jess\n\nwhat it means\n\nLeadbelly (1888-1949) was an African American blues musician who spent seven years in prison. Martha Promise was his wife. I found this rather amazing video of the two of them. This poem speaks from Martha’s voice about helping Leadbelly transition from prison to home by literally washing him.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nTyehimba Jess is my new favorite poet. He’s published two books: Leadbelly, which tells Leadbelly’s life story through the various people in his life, including him; and Olio, which looks at the lives of African-American performers before and after the Civil War. Both books take a person or period of history that fascinates me and tell the story through poetry. It’s almost like reading a play with each character getting their chance to speak.\n\nThis poem makes me cry. I like the hope in it—that it is possible to wash away the pain of prison. And that extra layer that even if it isn’t possible, you just convince your love that it is; “you tell him calm and sure,” and your confidence will rescue him. I like that the speaker knows it is her job to care for him. I feel such great love, confidence, and responsibility in this poem. It makes me want to be a better person.\n\ncraft\n\nBlues music sets the pattern for this poem. The Academy of American Poets says, “A blues poem typically takes on themes such as struggle, despair, and sex. It often (but not necessarily) follows a form, in which a statement is made in the first line, a variation is given in the second line, and an ironic alternative is declared in the third line.”\n\nYou can hear that rhythm underlying the repetitions in the first stanza and stretched out over the next three. Of course, Leadbelly was a blues musician, so this is a very clever convergence of form and meaning, but I also like how the blues, which can be so much about endurance, is here used to talk about recovery.\n\nI’m also in love with the vocabulary in this poem. I like the specific healing herbs like wildweed and just the music of “the furrowed and the lax.” I particularly like all the connotations of calling Leadbelly “shadrach,” a Biblical man who walked through flames because he refused to bow down to the man.\n\nkatherine with the lazy eye. short. and not a good poet.\n\nwhat it means\n\nA woman finds out that a high school classmate has been found dead in an abandoned building, her body twisted. There’s an implication that she has been raped. The speaker didn’t even like Katherine and certainly kept her distance from the slow ugly girl, but she finds herself grieving.\n\nThe speaker realizes she might not be so different from Katherine.\n\nEveryone deserves care and respect.\n\nwhy I like the poem\n\nOne aspect of poetry is taking an unvarnished look at yourself. For that, this poem wins gold stars. I cannot look away from how the speaker holds herself accountable for how she thinks of Katherine as other—bad poet, bad morals, loser in jobs and love. I want this level of courage.\n\nShe also takes a theme I hold dear—that everyone is of value—and does it without annoying moralizing.\n\ncraft\n\nIt’s both extremely concrete in its scene setting—the McDonald’s uniform, the styrofoam cups—and very subtle in how it parses out other information. How do we know that the speaker and Katherine are Black? Because of the picnic tables full of white people. What we see over there, tells more about what’s center stage. The attack on Katherine happens off stage but this line “your body was supposed to be as twisted as / it was gonna get” lets me know it was brutal.\n\nThink if she had just called this poem “Katherine.” Boring. In the biz, we call that a placeholder title, the one you put down as you are writing. This title is so funny—a lazy eye is funny in an uncomfortable, are we really going to mock other people’s flaws kind of way; the uncapitalized fragments with periods are funny syntactically; and calling someone else a bad poet in your poem is funny in a did she really just throw that much hubris on the page? I laugh uncomfortably every time I read this title. And by making me find it funny, harris makes me culpable. Because I have laughed, I too am on the journey with the speaker; I feel ashamed, and I too realize that Katherine is someone’s beautiful baby.\n\nPike's Peak: 1957\n\nAndrea Spofford\n\nwhat it means\n\nA daughter is telling a story her mother told her about a trip her mother took.\n\nWe have moments where we see the world in a completely new light. Seeing her mother emerge from the lake is such a moment:\n\nfrom the water again just dripped\n\njust bright, just blurred in the sun\n\nso fresh and vibrantly rendered.\n\nwhy I like it\n\nI know this moment of suddenly seeing someone you love and who is so familiar in a new light. It's magic. I also like the secrets in the poem. We know the ants are a problem, but we don't know what happened. I like how this moment is in such liminal space--between states, between one view of the mother and another, between the water and the land.\n\nI feel like there's a second story this poem hints at: what does it mean that the mother told her daughter this story about her childhood? what does that tell us about the current relationship? I appreciate the layers in this poem.\n\ncraft\n\nSpofford is good at turning nouns into adjectives or verbs. In this poem, \"bountied,\" is her made up word that works so well. I definitely need to try out this technique.\n\nIt's hard to pick the right details and depth with which to tell a story. In this poem, each stanza is its own close-up of a small moment that add up to the larger whole. It makes me wonder whether the author started with a much larger story and narrowed down or invented from a bare outline."
