        "text": "Writer Will Self is lucky to be alive after the roof of his £1 million Victorian townhouse came crashing down while he was inside.\n\nThe journalist and author managed to escape from the property with his children after the roof came down along with several of his neighbours', sending rubble flying onto the street.\n\nThe Solicitor General Edward Garnier was also among those evacuated from the affluent road in Stockwell, south London.\n\nSelf, 50, told the Evening Standard: \"It was like the front of my house fell off.\n\n\"I got the children out to the back of the property because it was all about to go.\n\n\"Once things had stopped falling off I got them out through the front door. Somebody could have been killed.\"\n\nSelf's wife, Guardian columnist Deborah Orr, wrote about the incident on Twitter.\n\nShe said: \"Our house, and the four neighbouring houses, are OVER. But no one is hurt and we're staying with @blackdogyellow tonight.\"\n\nShe later added: \"No one knows what caused it yet, but it's emergency services central. Helicopters, the lot.\"\n\nNeighbour Gareth Wallace tweeted pictures from the scene, showing the extent of the damage to the row of properties.\n\nLondon Fire Brigade confirmed it sent four engines and a fire rescue unit to the scene just before 9pm, with firefighters helping one elderly woman to safety.\n\nWatch manager Simon Phillips said: \"Firefighters helped an elderly woman to safety and a further 16 people left properties before we arrived.\n\n\"There was a lot of rubble in the street and we used a thermal imaging camera over the debris to make sure no one was trapped underneath.\n\n\"It's a busy road and it's very lucky nobody was walking outside otherwise they could have been seriously injured.\""
