        "text": "Motherwell is a memoir by the late Guardian editor and columnist, Deborah Orr, who sadly died one year ago at the age of 57. She was brought up in Motherwell, just outside Glasgow, a town dominated by the Ravenscraig steelworks, the largest advanced strip mill in Europe. The steel works dominated and shaped the lives of the residents of Motherwell, yet it was only active for thirty three years, from 1959 to 1992. This memoir is a vivid social history of those times, of the optimism of the post-war years, and the shattering of communities, in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher.\n\nWeaving in and out is a portrayal of Deborah’s mother, Win, and their relationship. Early on, she describes her as ‘amazing….accomplished, resourceful, vivacious, terrifyingly well organised and copiously talented as an artist and craftswoman’. Yet they had a troubled relationship, particularly later on when Deborah left home to go to university, then London and a career in journalism. I’m interested in people who’ve moved away from their class background into a different world-how they cope in a different milieu, and how they relate to the background they’ve come from. There’s been much written about this recently- Annie Ernaux’s The Years, Kerry Hudson in Lowborn, Didier Eribon in Returning to Reims. So I was also interested in how this move affected Deborah’s relationship with her mother.\n\nThe book is structured around objects found in the Orr family bureau when Deborah and her brother David are clearing out their mother’s house after her death. Chapter titles like Baby’s First Haircut, The Wedding Clipping, Gran’s Purse, take us straight into the intimacy and poignancy of family life recollected. In The Wedding Clipping we first meet Win and her new husband John at their wedding in 1961. She’s from a rural Essex family and goes to live in Motherwell with John, a Glaswegian, on marriage. Deborah’s aware this must have been a massive cultural change for Win. She remembers her saying ‘people are very hard here’ and railing at the ‘piece and jam’, the bread and jam which Deborah’s Glaswegian gran, Lizzie, fed her for lunch. John came from a very tough background himself. He’d worked at a baker’s before school from the age of nine when his mother was widowed and then started in the factory at 14—Didier Eribon’s father cycling as a boy across the freezing French countryside in search of potatoes came into my mind.\n\nDespite their different backgrounds, Win and John were happily married and devoted to one another. John worked at Anderson Boyes, a factory making coal-cutting machines while Win was a dedicated home maker while her children were young, going to work part-time as a wages clerk when Deborah went to secondary school. In 1966 the family moved into a brand new maisonette in the Muirhouse estate, which was initially a source of great pride for the family with its underfloor heating, especially when Win was able to decorate the walls with hessian (as my own parents did) and adorn the settee with fun-fur cushions in bright blue, lime green, red and buttercup yellow. Lamps made from bottles stood on the mantelpiece (ours were covered in tiles) and Deborah’s foreign doll collection in the bureau.\n\nDeborah Orr interleaves her family’s experience with a more general account of post war housing policy in Motherwell. We learn about the history of Glencairn Tower, its ‘jumpers’ in the 60s, its heroin problem in the 80s, when the closure of pits and steelworks brought unemployment and its attendant problems to housing estates. Closer to home for the Orr family were the activities of gangs, the graffiti and the lack of community space. I was taken aback at the pervasiveness of sectarianism at that time: there were separate primary schools for Protestant and Catholic children and, once they started school, Deborah no longer played with her friend Lynn, who only lived on the floor below and was Catholic. Deborah recalls her father John being vicious and vitriolic in his condemnation of Catholics- this sort of verbal abuse being more tolerated in those days, but deeply upsetting to her and her mother nevertheless.\n\nDespite some of the drawbacks, the Muirhouse provided a great space for Deborah as a child in the adjoining marshland, a few acres of wilderness right by the scheme, where she could wander and observe dragonflies, water boatmen, diving beetles, caddis grubis, names all learned from her Ladybird book of Pond Life. The enthusiasm felt by the little girl for this special kingdom is beautifully conveyed, as is her enthusiasm for many hobbies-reading, macramé pot holders, later Guides –she wanted to do everything. She was good at school and rose easily to the demands of her academically rigorous comprehensive, Garrion Academy. She was supported in all this by her parents, her mother going with her to the wonderful Carnegie library on Saturdays and watching new and challenging TV dramas with her when John was on night shift. Yet, her mother had occasional outbursts of frightening anger- Deborah recalls her washing out her brother’s mouth with soap and water when a neighbour reported him swearing and she herself was made to wear a sign saying ‘I am a cheat’ round her neck, including in the town centre when she’d cheated at scrabble in a family game.\n\nBut the real distancing of mother and daughter came when Deborah wanted to go to university, specifically St. Andrews. Win and John wanted her to go to Glasgow School of Art, closer to home, so she could become an art teacher. They told her university was full of posh people and wasn’t for the likes of her and just couldn’t understand her decision. Deborah did in fact find St. Andrews very difficult- it was full of posh people who didn’t know how to do anything useful like put out a burning chip pan and the academic work was boring and disappointing too. So Deborah spent a lot of time drinking, socialising and discovering sex and was unable to talk to her parents about the pretty miserable time she was having. When she went on to £40 per week on an Enterprise Allowance Scheme on graduating it really seemed like university had been a waste of time.\n\nWe hear little more about Deborah Orr’s life after she took that coach to London where she got the job as a typesetter which was her entry to journalism. But there are references and reflections about her more recent relationship with her mother throughout the book. Win’s outrage that Deborah should keep her own name on marriage. Her anger that Deborah gave her father’s profession as semi-skilled labourer, when she should have said engineer (he wasn’t an engineer). The reluctance of both Win and John to visit her and family in London, despite her mother adoring her baby grandson, which only worsened after John died. Her parents near incredulity and lack of understanding when Deborah has problems in her own married life, juggling complex relationships, a demanding career and her own cancer diagnosis. It’s as if Win encouraged her daughter to be successful, wanted her to use the opportunities which were open to her and yet wanted Deborah to have a life like hers, where looking after husband and family was a woman’s main occupation. And she’s unable to step out, to put a toe into Deborah’s world, to move towards her a little.\n\nI found this memoir a very compelling read. It’s an honest account of growing up and family relationships and doesn’t shy away from difficult and painful observations, particularly in relation to her mother. At times I could have done with a bit less commentary on narcissism and the interpretation of behaviour in terms of narcissism-whether or not it’s an appropriate interpretation of behaviour, it felt at times digressive. But there’s an awareness of the social and family circumstances which made these parents, the historical times they lived through, and a celebration of happy times together and the love they shared too. And for those of us who also grew up in the 60s and 70s the struggles around women’s roles and identity and our relationships with our mothers will be familiar and provide much material for reflection. This is a powerful and moving memoir which I thoroughly recommend."
