        "text": "For most of my life, I’ve been fascinated by cities. My teenage years were spent in a rather ordinary dormitory village but I headed regularly for the nearest proper city (Nottingham) for shopping and football, and the annual Goose Fair. I’d previously lived in Kumasi (Ghana’s second city), and Zaria in the north of Nigeria. When I went off to University I settled in Sheffield where I still live, despite a few years commuting to Manchester, and a very brief period commuting to Leicester. My PhD thesis explored ideas about the city, about navigating and failing to navigate it, about the city as labyrinth, looking particularly at Manchester and Paris. And my idea of a really good holiday would be less likely to involve a beach (though a city that happened to have a beach would be quite appealing), but would definitely involve a lot of walking around in a city with heaps of history and culture.\n\nA few years ago, I started to formulate an idea for such a holiday, encompassing two or three European cities, with as much as possible of the travel being by train. The idea never got very far when everything shut down, and we were barely starting to think again about travelling when M died, very suddenly, early one morning in October 2021. In the shock and grief that followed, I wasn’t really thinking about holidays in any practical way, but it did occur to me early on that they would be a challenge.\n\nI can’t see myself travelling alone for any other than the simplest journeys. I take the train up to Dundee a couple of times a year to stay with friends, but always pick the direct trains, and I know I’ll be met at the station, and I went to Rome alone in December 2022, but was met at the airport, and had family to stay with. My biggest challenge in travelling alone is my highly deficient sense of direction. I got lost in Amsterdam on what should have been at most a ten-minute walk from my hotel to the conference venue – heck, I got lost in Leeds (with a similarly deficient friend) trying to get from the Trinity centre to the Grand Theatre. So the thought of a city break on my own is just too intimidating to contemplate – and of course the idea of getting lost in an unfamiliar city alone is something that triggers the hardwired caution that comes from growing up female. Add to this the fact that I am short and not particularly strong, and struggle with any case larger than a weekend holdall, so often have to rely on the kindness of strangers to get luggage on and off trains.\n\nMore than this, the pleasure of such a trip would be so diminished if I had no one to share it with. I’d need a travelling companion, and it would have to be a travelling companion who was (a) taller than me – not a major difficulty, most grown-ups are, (b) gifted with a good sense of direction, and (c) interested in the same sorts of things that I am, including with a high tolerance for WW2 history.\n\nI said something about this dilemma one afternoon, sitting with my offspring, not long after M died. At which point the solution became obvious – my son A is (a) taller than me, (b) has an almost supernatural sense of direction and (c) is as much of a history geek as I am, with a similar interest in WW2. I started turning over in my mind what my ideal destinations would be, and Vienna, Prague and Berlin seemed to present the perfect mix of art, architecture and history, with a lot of WW2 and Holocaust sites to visit.\n\nWe started planning in earnest, once I’d checked with him that he wasn’t merely being kind when he agreed to go, but actually liked the idea, and worked out timings, and a wish list of places to go and things to see.\n\nI decided, fairly early on in the planning, that whilst sites associated with the Jewish populations of those cities, and museums and memorials recording the destruction of those populations, were high on my list of places to visit, there would be no concentration camps. If I go back to Prague with more time, I will perhaps take a trip out to Terezín, but it was not a priority on this trip. A had visited Sachsenhausen on an earlier trip to Berlin (with school) but had no desire to go back again. This was the right decision – the history of those Jewish communities was less familiar to me than the history of the camps, and what I wanted was to honour the Jewish history of all three cities, and to see the people behind the statistics, in the Stolpersteine on the pavements, in the names on the battered suitcases from Theresienstadt, in the names painted on the walls of the synagogue.\n\nThis is a Holocaust heavy trip. I have been reading about and studying the Holocaust since I first encountered Anne Frank when I was probably around the same age as her, and I believe that if we do not understand it, or at least attempt to, we restrict and distort our understanding of post-war politics, history, art, literature and music, even of humanity. It was a significant thread in my PhD thesis, not just the Holocaust itself but how it can be written about, and I have often wrestled with the question of how – indeed, whether – fiction about the Holocaust can shed light. So, whilst I do totally understand why people would choose not to go to these sites, not to read those books or watch the documentaries, it is important to me to do so, to continue doing so. All that I have read, all that I know, has never desensitised me to its horror and it will never do so – the names and photographs, the individual stories, can and do still punch me in the gut. But I don’t go to these sites to get that gut punch, I go to continue to build my knowledge and understanding – and to pay my respects.\n\nPart of my interest in visiting these three cities was to reflect on how they differ, and in particular how they approach their own WW2 history. Austria was recognised during the war as Hitler’s first victim, but it is of course not quite that simple – there was enormous support for the Nazi party, and a long history of virulent antisemitism in Vienna, that ran alongside the major Jewish influence in culture and the arts as well as in business and politics. Czechoslovakia was, entirely straightforwardly, a victim of Nazi aggression, and Prague’s Holocaust memorial takes the form, most powerfully, of the names of the dead, painted on the walls of a synagogue. Berlin deals with its past – both the Nazi era and the injustices and brutalities of the DDR – with candour and without excuses, and its memorial is not about the Jews of Berlin or of Germany, but all of the murdered Jews of Europe.\n\nThis blog isn’t a guide to or a history of any of these cities. It’s an attempt to capture the experience, and my reflections on the experience, to help me remember it in all its richness. And I’ve included some of the research I did after we returned home, to find out, where possible, the stories behind the names on the Stolpersteine and other plaques, because for me this was a vital part of the trip. It is an entirely personal mix of anecdote, history, images and quotations and as such may not be a reliable source for anyone else’s city wandering…\n\nNote: for clarity, I have used Terezín as the name of the Czech town, and Theresienstadt as the name of the Nazi ghetto/concentration camp which was created there. I have tried to be consistent with spellings, but Czech names are often to be found in multiple variants, so some inconsistencies may have slipped through.\n\nVIENNA\n\nWe arrived on Monday evening, flew in from Manchester and got a train from the airport to the Hauptbahnhof, from where we just had to cross the road to get to our lovely hotel, Mooons (comfortable and welcoming – we were tired and a bit stressed after we’d checked in, having had a slightly less straightforward journey from the airport than we’d anticipated, and Sven the barman sorted out food and beers for us so we started to chill out and enjoy planning our time. We made the most of our two full days in the city – though there is plenty we didn’t see, buildings that we saw from the outside but didn’t go round, for example – I clocked up 59k steps, 40.5 kms. We managed to find some proper Viennese food – e.g. schnitzel and goulash, and good beer (I went for the darker beers, less lagery).\n\nTuesday:\n\nFrom our very modern hotel, we were only a few minutes from the beautiful Belvedere Palace – we walked through the gardens which for me had strong Marienbad vibes (as in Alain Resnais’ French new wave masterpiece, Last Year in Marienbad, a film which has fascinated and haunted me for many years, and which I’ve previously blogged about on this site).\n\nOn to the Stadtpark, where we found a rather blingy statue of Strauss, and more tasteful ones of Bruckner and Schubert.\n\nClockwise: Mooons Hotel, Belvedere Palace, gardens and fountains, Last Year in Marienbad, Strauss statue in the Stadtpark.\n\nWalking by the Danube – here there was graffiti, a lot of it political, e.g. re climate change. In general in Vienna, there was no litter, and an orderliness evident in what happened at pedestrian crossings, where no one walked until they were told to walk. It felt a lot safer than, say, crossing a road in Rome, where one feels as if the only way to ever get across is to walk and hope one isn’t immediately mowed down. (A told me of waiting in vain for the right moment at a crossing point in Rome, and another tourist facing the same dilemma saying cheerily, ‘OK, when in Rome…’ and launching himself into the traffic. The cars and bikes do weave around you but it never even starts to feel safe.)\n\nThere are two Jewish museums in Vienna. First up was the Museum Judenplatz, built around the excavated remains of the earliest synagogue in Vienna, destroyed in 1421 by order of Duke Albrecht V. It has a fascinating collection building up a picture of that early Jewish community, and of the exploration of the remains. The Jüdisches Museum nearby continues the story of Vienna’s Jewish population through the centuries. But there is a strange sense of a hiatus – not that the Holocaust is omitted but compared to Prague and Berlin, it is arguably underplayed, the job left to the bleak Whiteread memorial in the Judenplatz. This is a bunker, whose walls are made up of books with spines facing inwards to represent the victims whose names and stories are lost, 65,000 Austrian Jews. The names of the camps and other locations where they were murdered are inscribed around the memorial.\n\nStolpersteine (Schwedenplatz): Here there are three individual stones, and a plaque in memory of 15 unnamed Jewish women and men who lived here before they were deported and murdered (no details given) by the Nazis. The Stolpersteine commemorate Anna Klein, b. 14 Jan 1885, Josefine Steinhaus, b. 21 May 1884, Helene Steinhaus b. 3 August 1885. Deported to Maly Trostinec 27 May 42, killed 1 June 42. Maly Trostinec/Trostinets, a village near Minsk in Belarus, was not a location I was familiar with. Throughout 1942, Jews from Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were taken there by train and then shot or gassed in mobile vans. According to Yad Vashem, 65,000 Jews were murdered in one of the nearby pine forests, mostly by shooting, but some estimates are much higher, up to 200,000.\n\nVienna State Opera (Staatsoper) We’d decided against trying to get tickets for any performance here because (a) cost, (b) I haven’t managed to entirely convert A to opera and (c) we didn’t want to commit an evening. That was the right choice – we walked for miles (see above), and in the evenings just wanted time to chill with some nice Austrian beers and talk over what we’d seen and make our plans for the following day. But the building itself is obviously magnificent. And we had seen inside anyway, in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation…\n\nClockwise: Stolpersteine, graffiti by the Danube, Judenplatz, Whiteread Holocaust memorial, the Opera house and nearby street\n\nSt Stephen’s Cathedral (Stephansdom). As in Paris, the survival of this and other fine buildings was achieved by a refusal to carry out orders. The City Commandant had ordered the Cathedral to be reduced to rubble, but this was not carried out – unfortunately, as the Red Army entered the city, looters set fire to shops nearby, which spread and damaged the roof and destroyed the 15th century choir stalls. Much was saved, however, and reconstruction began immediately after the war, with a full reopening in April 1952.\n\nWatching The Third Man makes one realise just how badly Vienna was damaged during the war – not devastated like Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, but, as Elisabeth de Waal puts it, ‘desultory bombing by over-zealous Americans on the verge of victory, and the vindictive shelling by desperate Germans in the throes of defeat’ had resulted in ‘the gaps in the familiar streets, the heaps of rubble where some well-remembered building had stood’ (The Exiles Return, p. 57). One would not know it now. Clearly, given the fear that rebuilding would destroy the character of the city, the choice was made to rebuild it as it had been, as far as possible. Which gives Vienna that feeling of being preserved in aspic, a slight unreality.\n\nWe went a bit further afield, out to Schonbrunn Palace. We didn’t go round the palace itself, preferring to explore the gardens, and head up the hill to the Neptunbrunnen and the Gloriette, to enjoy the view, which was indeed glorious.\n\nClockwise: Schonbrunn Palace, Gloriette and Neptune fountain; Stephansdom\n\nMaria am Gestade church – one of the oldest churches here, built 1394-1414\n\nMemorial to liberating Soviet soldiers (Heldendenkmal der Roten Armee/Heroes’ Monument of the Red Army), in Schwarzenbergplatz, featuring a twelve-metre figure of a Soviet soldier. This was unveiled in 1945. It seemed to me remarkable that it was built so soon after the war ended, but then I hadn’t realised either that Vienna was liberated by the Red Army, or that in the hiatus before the other Allied Forces arrived, there was a real possibility of Stalin occupying all of Vienna. The memorial is about heroism in battle, not about the violence, particularly sexual violence, inflicted on civilians during and after the battle, and has been controversial and subject to vandalism over the years, including very recently in response to the invasion of the Ukraine.\n\nWednesday:\n\nStolpersteine: Paula Wilhelm (née. Mandl), born 6 April 1887, deported 29 April 44 to Auschwitz; and Dr Max Neustadtl who fled to France but was deported on 25.3.43 to the Sobibor extermination camp and murdered.\n\nVienna’s second Jewish Museum focuses on the later Jewish communities, covering the period of Nazi rule, but not dealing in great depth or detail with the Holocaust.\n\nOne fascinating display here is part of the collection of netsuke whose story is told in Edmund de Waal’s The Hare with the Amber Eyes. These are the Japanese miniature sculptures which belonged to the Ephrussi family, and which were kept out of the hands of the Nazis, unlike most of the contents of the Palais Ephrussi. Six weeks after the Anschluss, the family servant, Anna, was required to pack away the belongings of her former employers. There were lists, of course, to ensure that everything was accounted for. But each time that Anna was in the Baroness’s dressing room, she slipped a few of the netsuke into her apron pocket, and hid them in her room. In December 1945, Anna gave Elisabeth de Waal 264 Japanese netsuke.\n\n‘Each one of these netsuke for Anna is a resistance to the sapping of memory. Each one carried out is a resistance against the news, a story recalled, a future held on to.’ (Edmund de Waal – The Hare with the Amber Eyes, pp. 277-83)\n\nClockwise: Stolperstein for Max Neustadtl, netsuke in the Jewish museum, Maria am Gestade church, stolperstein for Paula Wilhelm, Heroes Monument of the Red Army\n\nA plaque on Herminengasse gives the names of Jews who lived here, in what was once part of the Jewish ghetto. Many Viennese Jews were forced to live here, until they were deported to various killing sites. Several were killed in Izbica (a town in Eastern Poland, which was turned into a ghetto) – all show the same date of death, 5 December 1942, when the inhabitants of the ghetto (Polish Jews, and those deported from Germany and Austria) were murdered. Those who escaped this massacre were deported again, to Treblinka, Maly Trostinec, Łódź Ghetto, Riga Ghetto, Theresienstadt, Sobibor, Stutthof. I know nothing about these people, other than their age, and where they were killed. But I can see that Oskar Koritschoner was only 20 years old when he committed suicide. Maly Trostinec was the place where 13-year-old Regine Frimet and 3-year-old Ernst Elias Sandor were murdered. And Josef Weitzmann, the last of these to die, was killed in Stutthof concentration camp, in 1944, just after the facilities for mass murder had been set up there. He was 18.\n\nWe found the Palais Ephrussi, on the Ringstrasse (see, again, The Hare with the Amber Eyes). I had had an insight into the efforts to trace the plundered contents of the Palais, from Veronika Rudorfer who I met in December 2019 at a conference, when she gave a talk on that project, and subsequently, very generously, sent me a copy of her beautiful book about the Palais itself.\n\nThe Burg Theatre – Sarah Gainham’s excellent novel Night Falls on the City has a lot of the action taking place at the Burg theatre, as her protagonist is one of its leading actors. One wouldn’t know that this building was largely destroyed in bombing raids during WW2, and then by a fire subsequently, and has been rebuilt.\n\nVotivkirche (Votive Church) is a gorgeous, somehow delicate looking church, one of the most beautiful in a city of beautiful churches. It is in a neo-Gothic style and was built to thank God for the Emperor Franz Joseph’s survival of an assassination attempt in 1853.\n\nClockwise: Burg Theatre, Herminengasse plaque, Palais Ephrussi, Votivkirche\n\nWe saw the Rathaus – Vienna City Hall – and walked through the Burggarten where we found a statue of Mozart. Then the Resselpark (Karlsplatz), where we saw Sarah Ortmeyer and Karl Kolbitz’s 2023 memorial for homosexuals persecuted by the Nazis: ‘Arcus – Shadow of a Rainbow’, the colours of the rainbow changed to grey, combining grief and hope. There’s also a Brahms statue here, which I like very much.\n\nOn to Heldenplatz (Heroes Square), in front of the Hofburg Palace.\n\n‘The two over lifesize equestrian statues on high pedestals are what give it its name, two great military commanders on rearing horses with flowing manes and tails in the Baroque style, one carrying Prince Eugene of Savoy and the other the Archduke Charles, brother of the first Emperor Francis who, in one victorious battle, had stemmed for a while Napoleon’s advance on Vienna. … And yet, with all their panache, there is so little boastfulness in this square. What first meets the eye and impresses the mind are the broad avenues of chestnut trees lining it on three sides … They give the square its peaceful, almost countrified look; they are conducive to slow perambulation and quiet contemplation.’ (Elisabeth de Waal – The Exiles Return, p. 227)\n\nIn sharp contrast to the above description, this is where Hitler made his announcement of the Anschluss after his triumphant arrival in the city.\n\nClockwise: Brahms statue in Resselpark, Heldenplatz, Mozart statue, Rathaus, Arcus memorial in Resselpark\n\nParliament Building – another building that was seriously damaged in WW2 and the restored to its former glory. In front of it is the Pallas Athene Fountain – apart from Athene (statuary in Vienna is often Graeco-Roman in subject matter and style) it represents the four major rivers, the Danube, Inn, Elbe and Vltava (Moldau in German).\n\nHofburg Imperial Palace – the official residence and workplace of the President.\n\nSchwarzenberg Monument, commemorating Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg’s victory at the battle of Leipzig in 1813. Yet another equestrian statue (I cannot help it if the Bonzo Dog Doodah Band come to mind when I see these).\n\nHere comes the Equestrian Statue\n\nPrancing up and down the square\n\nLittle old ladies stop ‘n’ say\n\n“Well, I declare!”\n\nOnce a month on a Friday there’s a man\n\nWith a mop and bucket in his hand\n\nTo him it’s just another working day\n\nSo he whistles as he rubs and scrubs away\n\n(hooray)\n\n(Bonzo Dog Doodah Band, ‘The Equestrian Statue’ (N. Innes), Gorilla, 1967)\n\nHaus der Musik (Klangmuseum – museum of music and sound) is in the Palace of Archduke Charles, where the founder of the Vienna Phil lived around 150 years ago. The focus is on composers for whom Vienna was significant, with interesting material on Beethoven, Schubert, Mozart, Mahler, Schoenberg and others (not just biographical), as well as fun stuff about the science of music, my first encounter with a virtual reality headset (I didn’t do very well).\n\nClockwise: Haus der Musik, Archduke Charles monument, Hofburg palace (official residence and workplace of the President), Pallas Athene fountain, Parliament Building, Schwarzenberg monument\n\nKunsthistorisches Museum – in a palace (of course), purpose built by Emperor Franz Joseph 1 to house the rooms full of antiquities, sculpture and decorative arts. But the highlight was the picture galleries, and especially the Breughels, an absolute joy to see ‘Hunters in the Snow’ etc close up. Also paintings by van Eyck, Raphael, Durer, Holbein, Titian, Caravaggio…\n\nWhat did we miss? Well, if I went back, I’d go to see the Klimts in the Belvedere gallery, I’d book a tour of the Opera House, and the Parliament building. Might even go on the Riesenrad (I think given the particular form my vertigo takes – see below – I would be OK with it, after all, I was fine on the London Eye).\n\nVienna Reading: Fiction: Sarah Gainham – Night Falls on the City/Private Worlds; Elisabeth de Waal – The Exiles Return. Non-fiction: Clive James – ‘Vienna’, in Cultural Amnesia; Edmund de Waal – The Hare with the Amber Eyes; Claudio Magris – Danube; Stefan Zweig – The World of Yesterday\n\nVienna on Film: The Third Man; Before Sunrise; Vienna Blood (TV detective series set in turn of the century (19th-20th) Vienna)\n\nVienna Music: Too much to mention – the city played such a key role in the lives and careers of so many great composers and musicians. Beethoven, Mozart, Schoenberg, Schubert, Brahms, Webern, Korngold… I did my best to avoid hearing ‘The Blue Danube’, a piece I heartily dislike, whilst in Vienna, but didn’t quite manage it (it’s a bit like trying to avoid hearing Wham at Christmas)\n\nOne lesser-known name, who I researched on our return. Marcel Tyberg was born and studied in Vienna but moved to Italy (present day Croatia) in 1927, when he was in his thirties. His mother followed the rules once the area was under Nazi occupation, and registered her Jewish great-grandfather. She died of natural causes, but Tyberg was arrested and deported, first to San Sabba camp in northern Italy, and then to Auschwitz, where he was murdered in December 1944. I listened to the Piano Trio in F major (1935-1936).\n\nPRAGUE\n\nThursday:\n\nWe set off early to catch the train to Prague. Not the most scenic of journeys but travelling by train makes the journey part of the holiday and is generally less stressful. That is, once I was on board – the ‘mind the gap’ warnings do not adequately convey the hideous gulf between the train and the platform which involves one stepping out into said gulf and on to a narrow step before reaching the safety of the train. I realised this at Vienna Airport station but had vainly hoped that this wasn’t going to be the case with all the trains we caught… Fortunately A is both capable and caring, and so he grabbed the bags, put them into the train and then held my arms and made me look at him, not at the gulf, and step in. Same procedure in reverse when we got off the train, of course.\n\nA slightly longer walk from the station to our hotel, the Majestic, near Wenceslas Square. A more old-fashioned looking hotel than Mooons but very comfortable. Having deposited our bags we set off for the Old Town. What I hadn’t anticipated is how much harder on the feet and the joints the cobbled streets in Prague would be – both of my days in the city had to be curtailed slightly early because on that first day there I crocked myself a bit. I still managed to clock up 17k steps (not bad for a half day), and 20k the following day, a total of 25.5km in the city.\n\nWalking around Prague felt very different to walking around Vienna (and not just because of the cobbles). It is a city to wander in, to stroll down random streets, look around random corners, and be beguiled and intrigued by buildings that are a jumble of styles and eras, shapes and sizes. The terms ‘new’ and ‘old’ in Prague tend to mean ‘old’ and ‘really, really old’.\n\nClockwise: Charles Square, St Adalbert’s Church, Hotel Majestic, New Town Hall, view of the Zofín palace, a mysterious and ominous sign across the Vltava\n\nCharles Bridge is always rammed with tourists – it is probably the most photographed site in the city, understandably enough. We got glimpses of it from the New Town side on Day 1, and the Prague Castle side on Day 2, when we did go part of the way across.\n\nJan Palach memorial, Wenceslas Square. I was 10, going on 11 at the time of the Prague Spring. I remember the news reports, and my parents’ distress (they vividly remembered the events in Hungary in 1956), and I remember hearing of Jan Palach’s suicide. A couple of years later, the English teacher at my school, an eccentric chap called Mr Pepper, mentioned this (I cannot recall in what context) and said that in a few years, no one would remember Jan Palach’s name. I decided that I would. And I did.\n\nThe Jewish Museum in Prague, based in the old Jewish quarter, comprises a number of locations – we didn’t see everything, but what we did see was unforgettable. It comprised four synagogues, the ceremonial hall, the old Jewish cemetery (and a gallery which was closed when we visited).\n\nPinkas synagogue – I knew what I was going to see. But that didn’t make it any easier. I wrote back in 2017 about a visit to the Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris: ‘I had braced myself for this, knowing the terrible history that would be illustrated there. Nonetheless, seeing the Wall of Names, I felt the air being sucked from my lungs, realising that I was seeing in that moment only a fragment, only some of the names from only one of the years’. That’s how I felt in the Pinkas synagogue, where the Memorial to the Victims of the Shoah from the Czech Lands comprises their names on wall after wall after wall. The names are painted on, which gives them a certain fragility, that they could fade away, unlike the stones in the Paris memorial. They mustn’t, obviously. They need to be there for generation after generation, to see wall after wall of names, each a person with a story, with a life, with a potential future.\n\n‘The storm is within, a blizzard that stings the eyes and batters on the mind. Not snow or sleet but names. Names everywhere, names on the walls, names on the arches and the alcoves, ranks of names like figures drawn up on some featureless Appellplatz. Names and dates: given names and dates in black, surnames in blood. Dates of birth and dates of death. Seventy-seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven of them, names so crowded that they appear to merge one into the other and become just one name, which is the name of an entire people – all the Jews of Bohemia and Moravia who died in the camps.’ (Simon Mawer – Prague Spring, pp. 218-19)\n\nFrom the Pinkas synagogue to the old Jewish cemetery, in use from the first half of the 15th century till 1786 – the oldest gravestone is from 1439. It’s the ‘Prague Cemetery’ which gives Umberto Eco’s novel its name (a book that is now on my To Read list). (We didn’t visit the New Jewish cemetery to pay our respects to Kafka – maybe next time, especially if I manage to read a few more of his works before then). We saw the Jewish ceremonial hall, and the Klausen synagogue but didn’t go in. But we couldn’t miss the ornate gorgeousness of the Spanish synagogue, whose decoration imitates the Alhambra.\n\nClockwise: Pinkas Synagogue, Jan Palach memorial, Jewish ceremonial hall, Old Jewish cemetery, Spanish synagogue\n\nThe Old Town Hall is actually a medley of a number of buildings of various sizes and ages, stitched together (if I may mix my metaphors) over the centuries. At various times, bits of it were demolished/rebuilt/amended in various ways. In 1945 during the uprising in the city, a couple of wings were destroyed by fire. On another visit, I would be very intrigued to look around this properly.\n\nThe Town Hall’s most famous feature is the rather marvellous 15th century Astronomical Clock. We missed its most marvellous moment though as we failed to be there at the right time to see the apostles emerge.\n\nStolpersteine (Nové Město): four members of the Gotz family. Rudolf was 49, and his wife Marie 48 when they were deported from Prague to Theresienstadt; two years later both were transported to Auschwitz where they were murdered. Their sons Raoul and Harry made the same journeys at slightly different times than their parents. They were 21 and 16 respectively when they were deported, four months before their parents, to Theresienstadt, and then in September 1943, a year before their parents, to Auschwitz.\n\nClockwise: Astronomical Clock, Church of St Nicholas, stolpersteine for the Gotz family, Kranner’s Fountain (monument to Emperor Francis 1 of Austria), the Old Town Hall, Old Town Square\n\nAt this point, I consented to return to the hotel and put my feet up, whilst A headed off to the Prague Museum.\n\nFriday:\n\nDay 2 – with my feet properly blister-plastered, and a comfier pair of shoes, we headed (via the tram) to the Prague Castle complex. There’s a lot to see here, and the views of the city are stunning.\n\nWe walked through the Royal Gardens, with beautiful buildings around them, including Queen Anne’s Summer Palace. We saw a red squirrel here – I’m honestly not sure that I’ve seen one before, but we then saw another in Berlin.\n\nSt Vitus Cathedral – this took nearly 600 years to complete, 1344-1929. One of the final stages involved the installation of the beautiful stained glass. Czech art nouveau painter Alfons Mucha decorated the windows in the north part of the nave, František Kysela the rose window. Even though half of the cathedral is a neo-Gothic addition, much of the 15th century design was incorporated in the restoration.\n\nGoing up the Great South Tower was an optional extra which I unhesitatingly declined. I have been frozen with fear on spiral staircases in many of the ancient buildings of Britain, and in the Arc de Triomphe (with a posse of French schoolkids behind me helpfully going ‘Allez! Allez!’). So I let A go up the tower – there were a lot of steps, and it was indeed a spiral, but worth it (he tells me) for the view from the top.\n\nThe Basilica of St George is the oldest church building on the castle site, dating from 920.\n\nClockwise: Basilica, Cathedral interior, Cathedral, Great South Tower, Royal Gardens, stained glass in the Cathedral, Chapel of the Holy Cross, Castle interior, Queen Anne’s Summer Palace\n\nGolden Lane is a pretty alleyway of tiny, brightly coloured cottages. These were built for the members of Rudolf II’s castle guard and takes its name from the goldsmiths who later occupied the cottages. Kafka came here in the evenings to write, during the winter of 1916.\n\n12 Šporkova is the building where W G Sebald’s Austerlitz found the apartment that his parents had occupied. The fictional Jacques Austerlitz left Prague in 1938 to come to the UK as part of the Kindertransport. He was brought up without knowing anything of his origins but becomes haunted by the absence of his past and starts to search for information about his parents.\n\n‘The register of inhabitants for 1938 said that Agáta Austerlitz had been living at Number 12 in that year… As I walked through the labyrinth of alleyways, thoroughfares and courtyards between the Vlašská and Nerudova, and still more so when I felt the uneven paving of the Šporkova underfoot as step by step I climbed up hill, it was as if I had already been this way before and memories were revealing themselves to me not by means of any mental effort but through my senses, so long numbed and now coming back to life.’ (W G Sebald, Austerlitz, pp. 212-13)\n\nAusterlitz finds his old neighbour, and learns that his mother was deported to Theresienstadt, and from there to Auschwitz. His father had already left for France before his own escape, and by the end of the book Austerlitz is still searching for information about whether he survived (or how he died).\n\nWe didn’t knock to try to go in and see if the hallway and stairs are as Sebald described – in any event, I don’t know whether Sebald himself ever did so. There are a couple of photographs embedded in the text but as always with Sebald, we can’t assume that their positioning tells us what they are. Sebald visited Prague in April 1991, and again in April 1999, at a time when he would have been writing Austerlitz, and it seems likely that he at least did as we did and wandered down Šporkova and looked at the doorway. But did he choose this location arbitrarily, or did he have some information about its past that encouraged him to link it to his fictional protagonist? As always, Sebald mingles fact and fiction in a most fascinating, infuriating, and sometimes highly problematic way (see my PhD thesis for (much, much) more on this topic!).\n\nEstates Theatre – another Sebald connection: Austerlitz’s mother was an actress who performed at the Estates Theatre. It dates from the 1780s, and saw the premieres of Don Giovanni and La Clemenza di Tito, as well as the first performance of the Czech national anthem. It can also be seen in the film of Amadeus during the concert scenes, standing in for Vienna, as it is one of the few opera houses in Europe still intact from Mozart’s time.\n\nI didn’t see the extraordinary Dancing House myself – on day 2 in Prague I again had to bail early (those bloody cobbles), and so A went on alone, to see this building which had intrigued him from the guidebook. The Dancing House, or Ginger and Fred, was designed by architects Vlado Milunić and Frank Gehry on a vacant riverfront plot in 1992 and completed in 1996.\n\nClockwise: 12 Šporkova, the Dancing House, Estates Theatre, Golden Lane, Prague Museum, Morzin and Thun palaces.\n\nA also visited the Ss Cyril & Methodius Cathedral, site of the last stand of seven members of a Czech resistance group including Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, who had assassinated Heydrich. They were betrayed, and the church was surrounded by 750 SS soldiers, water pumped into the crypt to try to force them out, until all were killed or had committed suicide. We were both familiar with their story from the film Anthropoid – I’d also read Laurent Binet’s HHhH, and seen the film adaptation of that, The Man with the Iron Heart.\n\nWenceslas Square, near our hotel. The site of celebrations and demonstrations, and home of the statue of St Wenceslas (this isn’t the original one – that was moved elsewhere in 1879, this one dates from 1912). The National Museum, which A visited on Day 1, is at the top of the square.\n\nClockwise: Charles Bridge, the crypt of Ss Cyril & Methodius Cathedral, Memorial to the Czech resistance, Ss Cyril & Methodius, Wenceslas Square, Prague viewed from the Castle\n\nWhat did we miss? We only saw the modern part of Prague station, not the older building, nor the Kindertransport memorials there. We didn’t get to Petrin, and the funicular railway, the observatory, mirror maze or the mini Eiffel Tower (Rozhledna). But if we come back, we’d probably just spend more time wandering, I think, because there’s something to see around every corner here, not necessarily something grand like in Vienna, but something intriguing, something beautiful, something memorable.\n\nPrague Reading:\n\nFiction: Lauren Binet – HHhH (a fictionalised account of the assassination of Heydrich); Franz Kakfa – The Castle (it’s not really about Prague Castle but still…); Simon Mawer – Prague Spring; W G Sebald – Austerlitz; Philip Kerr – Prague Fatale; Heda Margolius Kovaly – Innocence (a Prague-set detective noir). Non-Fiction: Anna Hajkova – The Last Ghetto: An Everyday History of Theresienstadt; Heda Margolius Kovaly – Under a Cruel Star (also published as Prague Farewell), her autobiography, covering imprisonment in the Łódź ghetto and Auschwitz, her return to Prague and the judicial murder of her husband during the Slansky show trials, finally leaving after the failure of the Prague Spring; Alfred Thomas – Prague Palimpsest: Writing, Memory and the City (especially Ch. 5 which deals with Sebald’s Austerlitz).\n\nPrague on Film: Anthropoid; The Man with the Iron Heart; Kafka (TV series)\n\nPrague Music: Smetana – ‘Ma Vlast’ is the obvious piece, and a wonderful one, whether one is looking out over the Vltava whilst listening or not and Janacek and Dvorak are composers who have been part of my musical life for so many decades. It’s also important to recognise the work of a number of composers who were deported to Theresienstadt, and who composed and performed music in the ghetto, before being transported to Auschwitz and murdered, notably Gideon Klein, Hans Krása, Viktor Ullmann and Pavel Haas. Inevitably much of the music is lost but what has been recovered can be found on various collections and compilations, as well as on Spotify. I also rather like Martina Trchová, a Prague-born folky singer-songwriter.\n\nBERLIN\n\nOnwards to Berlin. Another train, this one with old-fashioned compartments. A more scenic route than the one between Vienna and Prague (and I’m definitely not talking about the man who emerged from a shrubbery alongside the rail track, naked apart from a beanie hat).\n\nOur hotel was immediately opposite the Hauptbahnhof, but we weren’t able to check in straight away, so we deposited our bags and headed out into the city.\n\nSaturday:\n\nWe headed out, noting some striking pieces of political art in Kreuzberg, and the EU project, Path of Visionaries, in Friedrichstrasse, where a floor plaque bearing a quote from someone inspiring is in place for each EU member state, plus UNESCO. I didn’t check whether we had a floor plaque, but when the project was launched in 2006, we were still in the EU…\n\nBerlin’s Jewish Museum is a powerful place to visit, both in terms of its design and its content. We particularly noted the Garden of Exile and Emigration, described here by blogger Gerry Condon:\n\n’49 columns filled with earth are arranged in rows traversed by uneven pathways. The stelae are built on sloping land and rise at an angle, leading to a sense of disorientation similar to that felt inside the museum building. Out of each column grows an Oleaster, an Olive Willow, perhaps symbolizing rebirth. The experience of walking in this structure is comparable to that of being in the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, but though the Garden of Exile and Emigration is more modest, I think I found it more effective.’ (Gerry Condon, ‘Living with History: A Berlin City Centre Walk’, How the Light Gets In, 25/06/15)\n\nWe hadn’t at this point seen the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, but certainly the Garden was disorienting; I stumbled as soon as I went in and felt off balance whilst I was in there. But there was beauty too, sunlight, and growth.\n\nThe corridors in the Museum itself are intersecting and slanting ‘Axes’, and there are a number of voids. We looked down into the Memory Void but didn’t find our way to go into it (it’s the only one of the voids that one can enter), bamboozled by the labyrinth. But from our vantage point we could just see the ‘Fallen Leaves’ (designed by Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman), each with a face punched out of steel and covering the floor of the void so that visitors have to walk over them.\n\nThe permanent exhibition is of Jewish past and present in Germany, but there are displays that recognise the diaspora, and the continuity of Jewish life and traditions in the many nations where exiles found a home. We were very struck by the display showing, in a series of long hanging posters, covered in small print, the many, many laws implemented by the Nazi party as soon as they had power, laws covering every conceivable aspect of life for Jews. It didn’t, as we know, start with gas chambers, or even with deportations. It started with minutiae, with things that people initially may have felt they could cope with, and little by little these restrictions isolated the Jewish population from Aryan neighbours, colleagues, classmates, so that they were exposed, without allies (or only those brave enough to take a stand), when everything was finally taken from them.\n\nWe also saw an exhibit about Regina Jonas, the first woman Rabbi, born in Berlin and ordained in 1935, an inauspicious year. I hoped initially that she had perhaps been able to leave before it was too late, but a moment’s googling told me what I kind of knew in my bones, that she stayed. She was arrested in 1942 and deported to Theresienstadt, where she continued to work as a rabbi, helped with a crisis intervention service to support newcomers to the camp, and was involved in cultural and educational activities. In October 1944 she was deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered either on arrival or two months later, aged 42.\n\nClockwise: Garden of Exile and Emigration (Jewish Museum), Hotel Amano, Nuremberg laws (Jewish Museum), Path of Visionaries, Regina Jonas, street art\n\nStolpersteine (Luisenstadt): Hirsch Neumann died 30 Oct 1940, Max Neumann, Rosa Reha Neumann, killed Riga Jan 42; Nathan Moritz Carlé, Charlotte Carlé, Margarete Carlé, Alice Carlé, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz. I was unable to find more information about Hirsch, Max and Rosa Neumann, but the story of the Carlé family is worth recounting:\n\nNathan and Margarete Carlé lived in Frankfurt when they first married, and their first child, Hans, was born there. They then moved to Berlin in 1900, where their daughters Charlotte and Alice were born. They moved around a fair bit in Berlin as their economic circumstances waxed and waned. In 1942, Margarete and Nathan were deported to Theresienstadt, where Nathan died on 11 October (reportedly of a heart defect). Margarete died of a stroke four months later. Whilst Theresienstadt was neither a death camp nor a work camp, conditions – massive overcrowding, malnourishment, and the spread of disease – killed many of its inhabitants, especially those who were older or otherwise vulnerable, before they could be deported to Auschwitz. Alice, their younger daughter lived with her partner Eva Siewert, until Eva was denounced in 1942 for having made anti-fascist jokes and sentenced to nine months in prison. Alice and her sister Charlotte lodged with Elsbeth Raatz, until threats of denunciation forced them to leave – Raatz, however, gave them false passports. In August 1943, they were arrested by the Gestapo and deported to Auschwitz a few weeks later. Of the 54 people in this transport, only nine women were registered as new arrivals (i.e. selected for work rather than immediate death). We don’t know their names, so we don’t know whether Alice and/or Charlotte were amongst those or had been murdered on arrival in the camp. Alice’s lover Eva survived, and worked as a journalist in Berlin after 1945. Hans Carlé had left Germany in autumn 1933, initially for the Netherlands, and then emigrated to Palestine, where he married. He lived a fairly precarious life in Tel Aviv, and died of a heart condition in 1950, aged 51.\n\nFernsehturm – we did not go up on this visit (A had already done so on his previous trip to Berlin), but we saw it – obviously, since it is the ultimate photobomber, popping up in almost every photo taken in the centre of Berlin.\n\nWe saw but did not go into the Berlin Palace, on Spree Island. A building that would have barely been noticeable in Vienna, where palaces are around every corner, it’s very striking here. But it’s actually a reconstruction. It was damaged by Allied bombers but actually demolished by the DDR government in 1950. In its place was the modernist Palace of the Republic, the DDR Parliament building. After reunification, and after long and arduous debate, the DDR building itself was demolished and most of the Berlin Palace’s exterior was reconstructed. It now houses the Humboldt Forum museum.\n\nBerlin Cathedral, built in the late 19th century, damaged by Allied bombing and subsequently restored.\n\nClockwise: Berlin Cathedral, Berlin Palace, Stolpersteine: Carlé family, Fernsehturm, Humboldt Hafen (the canal harbour), Stolpersteine: Neumann family\n\nRotes Rathaus, Berlin’s town hall. It was the town hall for East Berlin, and the name ‘red town hall’ indicated not only the colour of the stones, but also the political colour. Mid-19th century, heavily damaged by Allied bombing, and rebuilt.\n\nWhen we finally got into our room that evening (we’d decided to share, for economy), we were somewhat discomfited to discover that whilst there was, thankfully, a proper door on the toilet, the shower cubicle was all glass, and with a clear view through from the bedroom area, enhanced by the enormous mirror on the wall opposite the shower, just to make sure that the showerer would be visible from almost all points in the room, in all their glory. We devised a plan whereby the showerer would give a warning that clothes were about to be shed and the non-showerer would settle at the furthest top corner of the bed, facing the wall, and focusing intently on their phone or Kindle until the all-clear was sounded. We have since learned that this sort of thing is dismayingly common in modern hotels, in parts of Europe at least, and we don’t think much to it…\n\nSunday:\n\nWe headed for the Tiergarten but hadn’t fully realised the impact of the Berlin Half Marathon, which was taking place that morning. Our original route was quite impossible, so we only got a brief stroll through the Tiergarten before having to exit.\n\nReichstag – we’d tried to book a tour, but had evidently left it too late, or tours were unavailable due to the half marathon. Another time.\n\nMarie Elisabeth Lüders House (Scientific dept of German govt) – On the banks of the Spree are memorials to people killed trying to cross to the West. This new building, inaugurated in 2003, owes its name to social politician and women’s rights campaigner Marie Elisabeth Lüders. Parts of the Berlin Wall have been rebuilt here to commemorate the division of the city along the former route of the Wall.\n\nWe failed to do justice to Museum Island but did go round the Alte Nationalgalerie. The problem with galleries is that once one has been through a number of rooms of paintings, it’s hard to remember exactly what one has seen, and to keep in mind the things that one particularly enjoyed and I really wish I’d made some notes. As far as I can recall, we rather liked the Romantics and the Impressionists, and I think Arnold Bocklin and Caspar David Friedrich stood out.\n\nSolidarność wall – a section of brick wall from the shipyard at Gdansk commemorating the struggle for democracy in Poland through the Solidarity movement. I cannot find any information online about this, oddly. It’s adjacent to the Reichstag building.\n\nClockwise: Altenationale Gallery, Altes Museum, Reichstag, Rotes Rathaus, Solidarity wall, memorial to those killed attempting to cross from East Berlin (Marie Elisabeth Lüders House)\n\nThe Brandenburger Tor was the finishing line for the Half Marathon, and our arrival coincided with the first runners crossing the line, so we stayed and cheered for a while. Of course it is one of those sites that is iconic (a much over-used word, but here I mean that as an image it stands for Berlin in the same way that the Eiffel Tower stands for Paris), and I’ve seen it a lot recently, in coverage of the Euros. What seems remarkable is that it survived the final stages of the war, damaged but still standing, whilst so much of Berlin was reduced to rubble. Also remarkable is that shortly after the war, East and West Berlin cooperated in repairing some of the damage. Thereafter it was obstructed by the Wall and became a symbol of the city’s division – and then of its reunification after the Wall came down.\n\nWe had lunch with my friend Veronika, which was a brilliant opportunity to talk about all three of the cities we’d visited – she’d grown up and then worked in Vienna, now works in Berlin, and had visited Prague often, so it was fascinating to get her perspective on our experiences and to catch up on what had been happening since we met in December 2019.\n\nAfter lunch, on to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe:\n\n‘Two thousand seven hundred eleven concrete rectangles, as if a field of chiselled coffins of varying heights stand in formation, separated by just enough space for people to walk between them and contemplate their meaning. The stones undulate and dip towards the centre, where the ground hollows out, so that when a visitor reaches the interior, the traffic noise dies away, the air grows still, and you are trapped in shadow, isolated with the magnitude of what the stones represent. This is the memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe who perished during the Holocaust. There is no sign, no gate, no fence, no list of the 6 million. The stones are as regimented as the Nazis and as anonymous as the captives shorn of identity in the concentration camps.’ (Isabel Wilkerson – Caste, pp. 343-4)\n\nOpinions, as one might expect, differ about this memorial, about its purpose and the form it takes. I was surprised how similar that form was to the Garden in the Jewish Museum, although it is bleaker, somehow. But whatever form the memorialisation of the Holocaust takes, some will find it does not speak to them, or will question its location or how it presents itself (of course some will question the need for such memorials, but that question seems to me obscene in its ignorance). I did find it effective and oppressive, and the scale is very striking (the Garden does not attempt to convey that), and I applaud the use of the term ‘murdered’ here. When we speak of people dying in the Holocaust, or being killed, we diminish what was done. One might die of anything; one might be killed in a car crash. Whether through bullets or gas, disease or starvation, these deaths were planned and intentional, they were murder on an unimaginable scale.\n\nTopography of Terror Museum, on the site of the Gestapo/SS headquarters, and one of the longest extant sections of the Wall. We didn’t exhaust this because we (or at least I) were, frankly exhausted. But we saw the open-air part of the museum, and the remains of some of the walls of the buildings once occupied by the Gestapo. It was an excellent display – much that I did not know or had not understood in context.\n\n‘Had to get the train\n\nFrom Potsdamer Platz\n\nYou never knew that\n\nThat I could do that\n\nJust walking the dead’ (David Bowie – ‘Where Are we Now’, The Next Day, 2013)\n\nClockwise: Brandenburg Gate, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Potsdamer Platz, Tiergarten, Topography of Terror\n\nWhat did we miss? More here than elsewhere, partly because there’s more to see, but also because our planned route for Sunday was disrupted by the Half Marathon, and to be honest, because we were knackered. If/when I go back, there are several museums to see, and I’d particularly like to focus more on the post-war DDR history – the Wall, the Stasi, etc – as well as doing the Reichstag tour, and going up the Fernsehturm for the sake of the view.\n\nBerlin Reading:\n\nFiction: Christopher Isherwood – Goodbye to Berlin; Philip Kerr – Berlin Noir trilogy; John le Carré – The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Non-fiction: Walter Benjamin – Berlin Chronicle; Sinclair McKay – Berlin: Life and Loss in the City that Shaped the Century\n\nBerlin on Film: Wings of Desire; The Resistance; The Lives of Others; Cabaret\n\nBerlin Music: Obviously, there is plenty of ‘classical’ music from composers who were born in or who studied in Berlin. But the soundtrack in my head was made up of the voices of Marlene Dietrich, Lotte Lenya, and David Bowie.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSeeing three cities in six days invites one to make direct comparisons.\n\nVienna was grand, and beautiful, seemingly fixed in the nineteenth century, before all of that mid-twentieth-century unpleasantness. My response to the city was coloured by a conversation with a neighbour whose father, it turned out, had grown up there, but had had to leave, along with his family – of those who remained, many were murdered. She felt it was a soulless place, cold and hostile to her which, in a fundamental way it was – had her father not escaped it, she would probably not have existed. Another friend, who grew up in Vienna much more recently, spoke of it as claustrophobic, particularly for a teenager. So we admired its beauty but did not fall in love.\n\nPrague is older, more of a muddle of labyrinthine streets and architectural styles, but just as beautiful in its own, less grand, way. And in the Jewish quarter of the city it acknowledges both the long history of that community, and how that was destroyed, in a simple and moving way, through the names and what that list of names conveys, rather than anything monumental. Prague took our hearts.\n\nBerlin has, of course, a lot more to acknowledge, and it does so in various powerful ways. It leaves gaps, it leaves fragments.\n\n‘Berlin is a naked city. It openly displays its wounds and scars. It wants you to see. The stone and the bricks along countless streets are pitted and pocked and scorched; bullet memories. These disfigurements are echoes of a vast, bloody trauma of which, for many years, Berliners were reluctant to speak openly. … The city itself is long healed, but those injuries are still stark.’ (Sinclair McKay, Berlin, p. xvii)\n\nIts history is so complex and reflects not just one nation but two in the one city, as well as reflecting upon not just Germany (one or both) but what was done to so many in the name of that nation. There are layers upon layers to explore – and we inevitably did scant justice to that.\n\nBut we knew that seeing three cities in six days – three cities chosen because of their complex and fascinating history, their beauty and tragedy – was going to leave us with almost as long a list of things that we missed as our original list of things we wanted to see. Some of those omissions were choices – we favoured wandering around the streets over excursions that would take too big a chunk of our time, and I’m glad we did. I missed some things because I reached the end of my capacity for walking rather sooner than A did, and decided to conserve energy for the following day by a strategic withdrawal to the hotel room a little earlier than we’d intended. And there are things that we hadn’t even added to our list, that we’d include next time.\n\nBut we saw a heck of a lot, we walked for 57 miles, and I clocked up 135k steps, and we saw museums and art galleries, cathedrals, churches and synagogues, a cemetery, palaces, memorials, statues and fountains, parks and government buildings, paintings and stained glass windows, stolpersteine and commemorative plaques, three great rivers (the Danube, Vltava and Spree), street art, theatres and opera houses, bridges… We sampled the local culinary specialities (schnitzel, apfelstrudel, goulash, pork knuckle, various forms of sausage) and the local beers.\n\nIt was a trip that I dreamed up and I was afraid it wouldn’t live up to that dream, but it did, it was everything that I had hoped it would be. When we got home, it almost seemed dream-like – had we really seen and done all of that? Hence this epic blog – I needed to capture it all before memories got too hazy. I could not have done it without A and his company was not only practically essential, but also a joy. I am hugely grateful to him for making that dream a reality.\n\nThere are a few new themes in my reading this half-year. First, I got back into reading in French (see Barbéry and Camus below, and Fatou Diome’s Le Ventre de l’Atlantique will feature in my December books blog as I am only one-third of the way through at present). I had new bookshelves to fill, and so books that have been exiled in my attic for many years (some since we moved here in 1987) have been brought down and places found for them on those shelves – I’ve rediscovered things I’d forgotten I owned, seized with delight on treasured books that I’d not seen for ages, and found books that I really don’t know if I ever read, as well as books that I now need to re-read. And thirdly, I went on a marvellous trip to Europe with my son, a three city, week-long holiday that started in Vienna, moved on to Prague, and then ended in Berlin. Being me, I did of course do quite a lot of preparation for this, not just in terms of the obvious travel arrangements and packing, but watching films set in those cities and reading books about them or set in them. Those books feature both in my fiction and non-fiction lists.\n\nOtherwise, it’s a familiar mix, and the usual warning, that whilst I try to avoid spoilers, I make no absolute promises that there aren’t any. And note that I haven’t listed absolutely everything – the latest in a long-running series, for example, not because it’s not great, but because the only thing I could really say is that this is book no. x in series y. Books that I started and CBA’d to finish, or that I thought were just a bit rubbish I haven’t felt obliged to include; there are books here that didn’t work for me, but I’ve only listed them if there’s more to say than ‘this was a bit rubbish’, usually because I wanted to like the book more than I did, and so wanted to understand why I hadn’t cared for it. But generally, this blog is about sharing my enthusiasms, sharing what’s delighted, informed and inspired me, rather than my disappointments.\n\nAs always it’s difficult to pick out favourites from such an eclectic bunch. I think I’d choose, from the fiction list, Sarah Gainham’s Night Falls on the City, Simon Mawer’s Prague Spring and Francis Spufford’s Cahokia Jazz, and from non-fiction, Isabel Wilkerson’s Caste.\n\nFICTION\n\nMuriel Barbéry – L’élégance du hérisson\n\nThis marks my resolve to get back into reading in French (see also Camus below). I never really stopped, between reaching the point in my comprehension that reading a novel was feasible (around A level), and diving into Zola and Mauriac and de Beauvoir, and my PhD focusing on Michel Butor. But since finishing the PhD I hadn’t read a word, and this, a gift from my brother-in-law, was a good way to re-start. It was slow progress at first, which can mean you lose the impetus of the plot, but I gradually got more comfortable. The novel was entertaining and at times moving, and whilst my internal jury is out about the ending, I’m very glad I read it.\n\nHeinrich Böll – The End of the Mission\n\nThis is one of the books that came down from the attic, where it had been in storage probably since we moved in here, in 1987… Böll’s The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum is always going to be in any list of books that have had a significant impact on me. This one didn’t live up to that but was darkly funny and acerbic and I will read more Böll (I think I read Group Portrait with Lady way back when and liked that very much but there’s another one on my bookshelf which I will turn to soon).\n\nOctavia Butler – Patternmaster\n\nI read a lot of sci-fi in my late teens/twenties, because my boyfriend/fiancé/husband (that’s all the same bloke, just to be clear) was really into it. Some I loved; some left me cold. In later years I’ve read much less, but in bringing boxes of books down from the attic I found, not Kindred, which was the Butler novel I remembered, but this one, and I’m still not sure if I did read it, all those years ago. No matter, it feels fresh to me, and she has the gift – so essential to writers in this genre – of acquainting the reader with the specifics of that world and those peoples efficiently and swiftly, with the minimum of exposition, so that within the first couple of pages, one is gripped.\n\nAlbert Camus – Le premier homme\n\nCamus’s last, unfinished book, the manuscript of which was found near the site of his fatal car accident and edited and published by his daughter. It’s highly autobiographical in its rich and vivid depiction of a childhood in poverty in Algeria, a deaf and illiterate mother and a father killed in the First World War, whom he never knew.\n\nJane Casey – A Stranger in the Family/The Outsider\n\nTwo new ones from one of my favourite contemporary crime writers. The first is the latest in her excellent Maeve Kerrigan series, the second a stand-alone (at least so far) which connects to the Kerrigan novels. Both are, as always with Casey, tightly plotted, with great characterisation and very well-written. I’m now in a state of some anxiety waiting for the next Kerrigan, due to a very disturbing epilogue….\n\nAidan Chambers – Postcards from No-Man’s Land\n\nA young adult novel, with two timelines, one contemporary, one set in the Netherlands during the Second World War. I didn’t quite believe in the contemporary protagonist, unfortunately, and it left me quite cold, to my surprise.\n\nLouise Doughty – A Bird in Winter\n\nDoughty writes a damn fine thriller, and there’s always depth and complexity as well as twists and turns and suspense. The opening sequence is riveting, and one remains riveted to the final page. (P.S., anyone who only knows Doughty through Apple Tree Yard, do read Fires in the Dark, her novel about the Roma holocaust – superb and unforgettable).\n\nCyprian Ekwensi – The People of the City\n\nA Nigerian novel, published in 1954, before Nigeria gained independence – one of the first African novels to be published internationally. Ekwensi had previously published work based on folk tales, but this is very much a contemporary, urban narrative, the story of a young man, a crime reporter/bandleader in a city that isn’t named but seems to be Lagos. It’s quite episodic, betraying its origins in a series of short stories aimed at West Africans living in England (where Ekwensi wrote the book) , and is a vivid and engaging read.\n\nSarah Gainham – Night Falls on the City/A Place in the Country/Private Worlds\n\nThe first in this excellent trilogy is set in Vienna, so I read it before and during my time there. It begins just before the Anschluss and takes its protagonists’ story through to the liberation of the city by the Red Army. The second volume shifts the focus and the location to British military personnel near the border with Hungary, but in the third we’re back in Vienna. I found the final volume a bit too talky and wasn’t entirely convinced by the portrayal of the relationship between the two central characters (mind you, at one point I thought, oh, this is all getting a bit D H Lawrence, but then one of the characters said the same thing!).\n\nJoanne Harris – Jigs and Reels/Coastliners\n\nThe first of these is a collection of short stories and I didn’t get on with them at all. I tried several (at random, following some advice I read somewhere about how to tackle short story collections) and then gave up. Coastliners is very different to the other Harris novels I’ve read (Gentlemen and Players/A Different Class) and is a slow burner but it got under my skin, and I very much enjoyed it.\n\nBessie Head – When Rainclouds Gather/Maru\n\nWhen Rainclouds Gather is Bessie Head’s debut novel, written in exile in Botswana, where she had fled from apartheid South Africa, and published in 1968. It’s a great read, illuminating many aspects of contemporary society and politics, and offering a strong environmental message, rather ahead of its time. It’s also ahead of its time in the portrayal of the male characters, who are complex and sensitive in ways that go against the more macho stereotypes, as Helen Oyeyemi says in her introduction. Maru was Head’s second novel, published three years later, and focusing on caste, through the character of Margaret, a member of the San (pejoratively, Bushmen) people. I read Head’s later A Question of Power many years ago and will re-read in light of these two.\n\nMick Herron – Slough House/Bad Actors\n\nUp to date with the books now, which means I’m eager for the next one, and for the next TV series. I started Bad Actors desperately wanting to know what had happened to one of the regulars, and Herron rather sadistically kept me dangling till the last page. The swine.\n\nPatricia Highsmith – The Talented Mr Ripley/Ripley Underground/Ripley’s Game\n\nI’d read the first of these, many years ago, and thought I’d read the others, but they seem quite unfamiliar. There is a degree of repetition in the plots, and it’s all very entertaining and well-written, but I’m not sure that I’m going to go on to Volumes 4 and 5 – I think I’ve spent enough time with Mr Ripley, for now at least. I watched the new adaptation of the first novel, with Andrew Scott and loved it (see my review in the screen equivalent of this blog).\n\nDaisy Hildyard – Hunters in the Snow\n\nThe influence of W G Sebald is strong here, but this debut novel doesn’t entirely work for me. Its starting point is a young woman sorting through the papers left behind by her eccentric grandfather, which comprise his idiosyncratic history of England. This turns out to be the stories of four men: Edward IV, Peter the Great, Olauda Equiano and Lord Kitchener, and in each case the accounts are heavily weighted towards anecdote, and the sifting through anecdote for truth or deception. In between, the young woman remembers her childhood on the grandfather’s farm, and this too is of course exploring our relationship with the past. I liked a lot of things about it, but the different strands didn’t seem to come together in a satisfying way – it’s good, good enough to give it a re-read to see if I can get what Hildyard is trying to do.\n\nChristopher Isherwood – Goodbye to Berlin\n\nRead in preparation for our visit to Berlin. Not quite either a novel or a short story collection, these six narratives follow the same characters and are ordered chronologically, but with jumps in time that make these sections seem more free-standing. What is noticeable is how the Nazis go from being background noise in the first to being a clear and present threat by the end. The characters aren’t in general very sympathetically presented (even the one who’s called Christopher Isherwood), but they’re vividly drawn, as is the city.\n\nVaseem Khan – Midnight at Malabar House\n\nA new (to me) historical crime writer – this series is set in India in the years after Independence and the protagonist is a nicely quirky character, also distinguished by being the first female copper in the newly independent police force.\n\nStephen King – You Like it Darker\n\nIt’s obviously not a coincidence that the title of this collection of short stories echoes that of Leonard Cohen’s final album, You Want it Darker. I knew it wasn’t, even before I read the acknowledgement in King’s Afterword, because he’s a man who knows his music. And in this collection of stories, perhaps more than ever, King’s protagonists are older, intensely aware of their own mortality, of the frailty of their bodies, of the accumulation of losses, of regret and shame for past mistakes. He’s always explored darkness, but there’s a particular note that he strikes here, again and again. He can still work that trick on my mind that he has done so often over the years, of making me read on in the hope that if I get to the end of the story that uneasy sensation in my gut would ease, only to find that the last words in the story are ‘God help me!’ and I’m not free after all, debating whether to leave the light on. I know that it isn’t real, and I know that there’s no way I will hear that particular sound in the house and I know that I’m listening for it…. The stories vary considerably in length, and one or two are slight in content as well as short on pages, but the best are King at full strength (full darkness). ‘Rattlesnakes’ in particular will stay with me for a long time, I fear (given my snake phobia, born from living in West Africa where we had to learn to be afraid of them).\n\nJohn le Carré – The Spy who came in from the Cold\n\nA re-read, whilst in Berlin, of one of the first le Carrés that I read in my teens. As brilliant as I remembered it, and as bleak.\n\nSimon Mawer – Prague Spring/The Glass Room\n\nMore travel-related reading. The first is set, as the title suggests, at the time of the Prague uprising and its violent repression, the second spans a much longer period, beginning between the wars, and taking the story through to, again, the Prague spring. Both are fascinating and compelling, beautifully written and moving.\n\nSimon Mawer – The Girl who fell from the Sky/Tightrope\n\nThis is a more conventional thriller from Mawer, about one of the SOE agents parachuted into Occupied France. It’s territory I know well, having been obsessed with the stories of the female agents since watching Odette and Carve Her Name with Pride in my teens, and having read Sarah Helms’ biography of Vera Atkins and Leo Marks’ memoir, Between Silk and Cyanide (both Atkins and Marks make appearances here, along with a mix of real and fictional characters). The quality of Mawer’s writing makes this stand out – and the thriller really does thrill (there is a sequel about which I can say nothing without spoilers, so I’ll say only that it’s just as tense and gripping as the first).\n\nSaima Mir – The Khan\n\nWe’re in Godfather territory here, transposed to a northern industrial city (I’m thinking Bradford but it’s not specified) with a significant South Asian population. It’s about family, loyalty and morality, as the titular Khan faces questions of succession and of a changing city. The narrative immerses the reader in Pakhtun culture, which in itself is fascinating.\n\nSarah Moliner – The Whispering City\n\nSpanish crime thriller set in Barcelona during the Franco era. The context is absolutely part of the narrative, not just a backdrop, and Moliner creates the atmosphere of fear and mistrust very effectively.\n\nAbir Mukherjee – Smoke and Ashes\n\nAnother in the Wyndham/Banerjee series, set in 1921. What Mukherjee does by telling the story through the voice of the British officer, not his Indian sergeant, is brilliant – he doesn’t make Wyndham anachronistically enlightened, but as something of a maverick, able to contemplate other points of view than the received Raj wisdom. Nonetheless, some of his remarks about India and Indians make me wince, and his relationship with Banerjee, whilst respectful to a degree, is rooted in that view of the world. It’s nimbly done, and the plot is complex and interesting, not only in terms of the crime but of the politics of the time.\n\nAlice Munro – The Beggar Maid: Stories of Flo and Rose\n\nThis was one of the books that came down from a long sojourn in the attic, and news of Munro’s death prompted me to re-read it. It’s a joy to read (whether this is a collection of linked short stories or a novel, who cares?), so clear and subtle, often funny and sad at the same time. I realised reading this again after many years that she must have been a huge influence on Elizabeth Strout, who I also love, both in terms of the form and the style. Both Flo and Rose are beautifully drawn – it’s interesting to re-read now and find that Flo’s story and that of the older Rose are as compelling to me now as the younger Rose’s were when I first met her.\n\nC P Snow – The Search\n\nSnow was probably my father’s favourite writer of fiction. He read a fair bit of fiction as a younger man, but then rediscovered its joys in later life, when his sight failed and he turned to audio books (Dickens, Trollope, le Carré, Harper Lee and others – he was entranced by The Book Thief). Sadly, Snow’s work is so out of favour that it’s hard to find affordable real books, and no audiobooks at all. Dad related to Snow’s interest in science and politics, and this one, which precedes the Strangers & Brothers series, is about academic scientific research and University politics. I would have probably found it a great deal less interesting had I not worked in higher education management for so many years, and in a Physics department until shortly before my retirement, but as it is, it resonated strongly with me.\n\nFrancis Spufford – Golden Hill/Cahokia Jazz\n\nI discovered Spufford through Light Perpetual, a stunning novel about an alternative world in which five children didn’t die in the V2 bombing of Woolies in 1944…. Golden Hill is quite different – a rambunctious Fielding-esque tale of a young man on a mission or on the make in America, with a much darker undercurrent that becomes clear only quite late in the narrative. Beautifully done. And Cahokia Jazz is an alt-history crime novel, about which I will say little more, except to recommend it very highly indeed. He’s one of the most exciting novelists I’ve encountered over the last few years.\n\nAnne Tyler – French Braid\n\nI’ve read, I think, nearly all of Tyler’s novels, and have loved nearly all of them (Vinegar Girl, her take on The Taming of the Shrew, just didn’t work, I’m afraid). This is classic Tyler, as the Guardian’s reviewer put it, ‘Funny, poignant, generous, not shying away from death and disappointment but never doomy or overwrought, it suggests there’s always new light to be shed, whatever the situation, with just another turn of the prism’.\n\nNON-FICTION\n\nDaniel Finkelstein – Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad: A Family Memoir of Miraculous Survival\n\nThe title emphasises survival but throughout this family history we are aware both of how many didn’t survive, and of how easily ‘Mum and Dad’ could have been amongst the lost. That sense of loss is pervasive – ‘so many families, so many happy homes, so many childhoods’ – as is the awareness that, as Finkelstein puts it, “What happened to my parents isn’t about to happen to me. It isn’t about to happen to my children. But could it? It could. Absolutely, it could.”\n\nZora Neale Hurston – Barracoon: The Story of the Last Slave\n\nI came across the story of Cudjoe Lewis (or rather, Oluale Kossola), believed to be the last survivor of a slave ship, in the documentary Descendants, which included a short film clip of Zora Neale Hurston with Lewis. This is her biography of the man, based on extensive interviews with him, and it’s extraordinary. The book wasn’t published until 2018 – Hurston failed to find a publisher in her lifetime because she kept Lewis’s account in his own words and in the vernacular that he used, and because she acknowledged African involvement in the slave trade.\n\nSinclair McKay – Berlin: Life and Loss in the City that Shaped the Century\n\nRead in preparation for the trip to Berlin, this is a fascinating account of that city’s twentieth century. Unlike Vienna, Berlin, as McKay says, displays its wounds openly – in a sense it had no choice, given both the extent of the devastation from Allied bombs and the world’s knowledge of the devastation that was wreaked upon Europe, and particularly on its Jews. That makes it a remarkable city to visit, and this book was an excellent introduction to it.\n\nDonald L Miller – Masters of the Air: How the Bomber Boys Broke Down the Nazi War Machine\n\nSee my blog about this half-year’s watching for my review of the TV series based on this book (and on interviews and memoirs from the surviving bomber boys). The book itself takes a wider sweep than the drama and gives much more context for the missions which cost so many lives, as well as exploring the ethical arguments about the bombing of civilian areas. Miller is an excellent writer, and gets the balance between technical stuff and human stuff right, so it’s a very engaging read.\n\nPaul Newman – The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man: A Memoir\n\nOrdinary, maybe. But certainly complicated. It’s a very honest account (as far as we can judge) and often sad, but because of the extraordinary life he’s had it illuminates so much about the movies during the decades in which he was a leading light, and about American life, culture, politics more broadly.\n\nDeborah Orr – Motherwell: A Girlhood\n\nI used to read the late Deborah Orr’s columns in the Guardian, and later followed her on Twitter and her voice was always compelling. This memoir is remarkable, and I find it strangely hard to write about, almost as if I’m reviewing a person (who I never met), rather than a book. So I’ll let Andrew O’Hagan’s words stand: ‘forging out of living memory a glowing vision of troubled belonging. In the writing of it, Deborah found a way to rise out of her sorrows and dependencies, her own difficult loves, and create a masterpiece of self-exploration. We can only mourn her loss and the brilliant books she might have written after this.’\n\nLucy Pollock – The Book about getting Older (for people who don’t want to talk about it)\n\nI am not averse to talking about getting older – I don’t embrace all aspects of it (who could!), but I accept it, and, as my late husband used to say, it is better than the alternative. Unless it isn’t. My thoughts on my own ageing are heavily influenced by having lost my mother-in-law and being in the process of losing my father to dementia, and whatever else happens to me in the remainder of my life, that is the most terrifying thing to contemplate. There’s a lot of practical stuff here, about how to prepare yourself and your family, most of which I’ve already been cracking on with (PoA, will, lists of account numbers and passwords, funeral plan), others that I’m still thinking on (e.g. advance decisions). What was particularly interesting to me was the distinction Pollock makes between what is common as one gets older, and what is normal. In other words, what is genuinely pretty much inevitable, and what might be avoidable, or should be properly investigated rather than just being accepted. It’s not a cheery read but it is practical and hopeful, which is how I intend to approach my advancing years.\n\nFrancis Spufford – The Child that Books Built: A Memoir of Childhood and Reading\n\nI am very much a child built by books. I read voraciously from the moment those marks on the page turned themselves into words for me and have never stopped. That childhood reading shaped my adult reading, and the more I read, the more I wanted that experience of turning a page and entering someone else’s world. So I was very intrigued to read Spufford (as I mention above, a fairly recent discovery and one of the most exciting contemporary writers) talking about the books that built him. He is a fair bit younger than me, but of course we read a lot of the same things – Tolkien, C S Lewis, E. Nesbit, etc. Le Guin, who was clearly hugely important to him, became part of my life only when I was a teenager, but it’s fascinating to read his account of discovering Earthsea as a child. And the way he writes about his life in books, as I’d expect from the way he writes his novels, is beautiful and touching and funny and deep.\n\nIsabel Wilkerson – Caste: The Origin of our Discontents\n\nA rigorous and persuasive exploration of American racism as a form of caste system. Wilkerson draws comparisons with the Indian caste system and with Nazi Germany. Kwame Anthony Appiah described the book as beautiful and painful to read, and indeed the account of how notions of purity and pollution, for example, played out in the American South – and more widely – are horrifying, and much of this detail was new to me. It seems to me that this analysis is hugely important in understanding not only the history but the future – recognising that this is about caste allows us a clearer view of how a society can change for the better. It certainly got into my head, and I found myself referencing it after one recent episode of Doctor Who (Dot and Bubble)…\n\nStefan Zweig – The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European\n\nIt’s hard reading this and knowing that the day after posting this manuscript to the publisher, Zweig and his wife committed suicide. The book isn’t a suicide note – it doesn’t really explain that decision. They were safe, albeit in exile and (this was in 1942) with no guarantee that their safety would continue or their exile end. Clearly that sense of exile, of having left a life behind that, whatever the outcome of the war, could not simply be picked up again, was beyond bearing. But for most of the book, Zweig appears to lead a fairly charmed existence, attracting success, brilliant and talented friends, and a life of culture and comfort. He seems to have accepted the good things that came his way without any great surprise or doubt that this was his due, which isn’t an entirely appealing quality. And the way in which all of those brilliant and talented people immediately became his dearest friends was a bit queasy. So I wasn’t won over to Zweig (though Michael Hofmann’s vitriolic demolition job in the LRB seems weirdly excessive and personal). In some ways I felt about Zweig as I felt about Vienna, where he spent his early years. Somehow Vienna gives the impression of being quite pleased with itself, and to have distanced itself more than other European capitals from the ‘unpleasantness’ of events. One friend, whose father got out of Vienna just in time, described the city as soulless and another, who grew up and lived there till recently, described how claustrophobic she found the city. My two days there hardly qualify me to judge but my son and I had both asked ourselves why we loved Prague and Berlin and didn’t fall for Vienna’s undoubted charms.\n\nPostscript\n\nIt seems appropriate to honour here the late Alice Munro (see The Beggar Maid, above, and I have read others of hers), C J Sansom (see previous years’ book blogs for his Shardlake series, and I’ve also read his alt history, Dominion, and his Spanish Civil War novel, Winter in Madrid), and Christopher Priest (see future book blogs as I revisit some of his brilliant sci-fi novels, and catch up on any I missed. A Dream of Wessex is the one I always think of first, because it had such an impact on me). Thank you all.\n\nAnd thank you to all the writers listed above, for everything that they brought me over the last six months. You’ve taken me to four continents, to several centuries, as well as to places that never existed, and history that never happened. You’ve entertained me, informed me, made me think, deepened my understanding of this world and its history and of the people who inhabit and have inhabited it. The child that was built by books is still being built by books, even in her seventh decade.\n\nThe Big Screen\n\nSome superb films on my list this half-year. Most were actually seen on the smaller screen, but I did go to the cinema for The Zone of Interest, Furiosa, Dune 2, Dear England, and Rome: Open City (of those, Furiosa and Dune 2 were on the very very big screen, deservedly so). Even more than usual, I find it impossible to pick ‘the best’ or even ‘my favourite’ but I have asterisked a few that seemed to be head and shoulders above the rest. I’ve included some re-watches but not all, and I’ve missed out any film that I started and just CBA’d to continue (clearly that is a judgement, but not a judgement that I can necessarily defend, as it might have got heaps better after I switched off…). Some of my watching was to prepare me to visit Vienna, Prague and Berlin (see also my books blog, and there will be a full blog about the trip in due course). Quite a bit of it, as always, was WWII related (the trip and my watching through the last six months). But I’ve also explored other pasts, and futures…\n\nAbout Time\n\nClassic Curtis – cute, funny, with some very problematic elements (all the men in the family have a secret power that they keep secret from all the women in their lives and use to manipulate said women into liking them more). We enjoyed it enormously, despite the problematic elements. Until the narrative took a turn that we weren’t expecting and one that left my daughter and I clinging to each other and weeping.\n\nAftersun*\n\nMelancholic, often sweet and funny, portrayal of a father and (just) teenage daughter on a holiday that he probably can’t really afford, their interactions showing both of their vulnerabilities and foreshadowing a future that we glimpse, intercut with the scenes from the holiday. Mescal is brilliant, Frankie Corio as his daughter extraordinary.\n\nAli\n\nWill Smith is excellent, but somehow the film doesn’t quite work. So many aspects of Ali’s life seemed to be touched on (particularly his friendship with Malcolm X and loyalty to Elijah Mohammed) and then left to one side. It’s not quite hagiography but it does gloss over Ali’s affairs and their impact on his wives, and it doesn’t ask the hard questions, of Ali as a man or as a boxer. One review calls it ‘flat, curiously muted’ and notes issues with the pacing, and I think I agree on both points.\n\nAll of Us Strangers*\n\nDevastating. The Guardian described it as ‘a raw and potent piece of storytelling that grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.’ I’d read reviews before watching but I wasn’t ready for the way the film handled Adam’s visits to his parents, let alone for the ending. I can’t actually talk about the film, I can’t hear Frankie’s ‘The Power of Love’ without choking up, I can’t think about certain key moments or even about why this film reduced me not just to tears (that’s not so unusual) but to sobs that actually physically hurt. It’s beautiful and unbearably sad and I might have to watch it again some day to appreciate just how it’s done, but it will be quite some time before I’m ready.\n\nAllied\n\nWell, this was entertaining and exciting enough, I guess. I just didn’t believe it. And I found Brad Pitt really rather wooden… Marion Cotillard deserved a better co-star.\n\nAmerican Fiction*\n\nVery funny, even if painfully so. As a white reader who has consciously tried to read more by writers of colour, to hear more black voices, etc., I winced while I laughed. I wish it had explored more the interaction between Jeffrey Wright’s Paul, and Issa Rae as the author of We’s Lives in da Ghetto – I would have happily sat through an extended version of their conversation.\n\nAnthropoid\n\nGripping account of the assassination of Heydrich in Prague in 1942, from the perspective of the Czech resistance. We saw this when it first came out, but I re-watched because it was filmed in Prague (the second city on our European trip) and I knew we would be visiting some of the locations. As it turned out, my son made the pilgrimage to the Cathedral of sv Cyril and Metodej (Heydrich Martyrs Memorial) without me, as Prague’s cobbled streets had temporarily done for me after several days of clocking up record numbers of steps. See my forthcoming blog about the trip for more.\n\nThe Beautiful Game\n\nA football drama – set at the Homeless World Cup in Rome – where the usual problem (actors playing top level sportspeople) doesn’t apply because the footballers in this tournament are not there because they’re the best in their country. Micheal Ward (who was wonderful in Empire of Light) is brilliant here. It occasionally lacks subtlety, and I normally react badly to the word ‘heartwarming’, frequently used to describe this film – but what the hey, my heart was undeniably warmed. It’s funny and touching and it’s about football and I loved it.\n\nBefore Sunrise\n\nThis was a taster for a short stay in Vienna (we were there a bit longer than the characters in the film) and we did spot a few of the locations as we wandered around the city. Absolutely charming, sweet and funny.\n\nBen is Back\n\nJulia Roberts and Lucas Hedges make this work with wonderfully nuanced performances. Roberts as the mother of an addict is torn between loving him, wanting to believe in him, and knowing that addicts lie and steal and that she can’t risk too much trust. And Hedges makes us believe, despite the way in which his story unravels, that he wants to be clean, that he loves his family. That’s the film, really, that relationship, and the tensions that ripple out from it to the rest of the family.\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\nI saw this at the cinema when it came out, and settled down for a re-watch one afternoon when I needed something familiar and a guaranteed pleasure. I was in love with both Newman and Redford when I first saw it (heck, I still am), though had I been forced to choose one, it would have been Newman (still is). The film stands up remarkably well – Katharine Ross’s Etta Place has plenty of agency (despite that scene where she undresses at gunpoint) and character, when she might well have been a mere passive hanger on. It’s funny and touching and a delight.\n\nCatch Me if you Can\n\nVery entertaining. If it doesn’t explicitly portray the real damage (financial and emotional) that Frank Abagnale Jr did through his lies and scams, Tom Hanks’ FBI agent provides the balance with his relentless pursuit, so that as charming as Frank is, we never truly want him to get away with it, we just want the cat and mouse game to be fun, as it is.\n\nChevalier\n\nThere has been a huge amount of effort to re-establish in the musical repertoire composers of colour who had been sidelined or forgotten altogether – Florence Price and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, for example, are now regularly featured on programmes of orchestral or chamber music. This guy, Joseph Bologne AKA Chevalier de Saint-Georges, was earlier than either of those, and his life is as remarkable as his music. Whether all of the events depicted here happened quite as shown doesn’t matter terribly – Kelvin Harrison Jr persuades us that he was brilliant, charming, bold and confident, and the music on the soundtrack confirms he deserves this starring role.\n\nChicago\n\nThis was fun, but I never felt entirely engaged either by the music or the plot – it was all very well done, entertaining, diverting, and the production was imaginative. Just somehow left me a bit neutral.\n\nCollateral\n\nCracking thriller. I enjoyed Cruise as a baddie, and Foxx’s taxi driver/dreamer is a wonderful foil for him. OK, the final showdown (especially the subway sequence) could be said to be hackneyed but by that time I was sufficiently invested not to be quibbling about anything, just to enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Commitments\n\nFunny, exuberant and with a nice balance between the hopes and dreams of the musical big time and the cynicism born of everyday experience. The sequence with the auditionees queueing up at Jimmy Rabbite’s door is glorious, as is the music. If the story seems to fizzle out a little at the end, well, that’s life…\n\nDaphne\n\nBiopic about du Maurier, focusing on her passionate relationships with women. One reviewer complained about this, but as it doesn’t claim to be the definitive exhaustive biography, and as these relationships are well documented but not well known, it seems perfectly valid to me. Geraldine Somerville’s du Maurier remains quite an enigma but is always fascinating.\n\nDear England\n\nAn NT Stage on Screen production. Loved every minute of it. Joseph Fiennes was perfect as Southgate, and I ended up a great deal fonder of Harry Kane through his portrayal by Will Close than I ever was before. Funny, touching, giving due recognition to mental health and to racism, without allowing either of those to overwhelm the narrative.\n\nDecision to Leave\n\nA truly intriguing and compelling Korean thriller, a story of obsession, of a cop with insomnia and problems with his vision (obviously metaphorical as well as literal), and a fascinating suspect in a baffling murder case.\n\nDune 2*\n\nLoved the book (and several of its sequels) in the 70s, thanks to my husband who was a keen reader of science fiction (and who would have loved the Villeneuve adaptations). Saw but didn’t like the David Lynch movie version from 1984. I was blown away by the first film, despite only seeing it on a TV screen. We saw the sequel on Imax, and it was stunning. It is, to the best of my recollection, a pretty faithful adaptation of the book, which is complex and multi-layered, and reflects Herbert’s interest in ecology, messianic religion and mycology (some elements of the book were apparently inspired by his experiments with psilocybin).\n\nEverybody’s Talking about Jamie\n\nIt took me a long time to get round to this – I’ve still never seen the stage version on any of its periodic returns to the Crucible theatre. It was hugely enjoyable, although I can’t say that any of the tunes stuck in my head at all. Obviously, I tried to spot Sheffield locations (without much success), though I already knew the social club scene was filmed at Crookes Social Club (erstwhile Working Men’s Club), where I go regularly to see Sheffield Jazz gigs. We were shopping in Crookes one day when we saw two coaches struggling to negotiate the narrow, car-lined streets, and then saw them disgorge a large number of passengers, who made their way to the Club to act as extras.\n\nThe Falling\n\nDark but often quite funny account of an epidemic of fainting at a girls’ school – wonderful performances from Maisie Williams and Florence Pugh (her debut) in particular amongst the girls, and Greta Scacchi and the always brilliant Monica Dolan amongst the teachers. Maxine Peake is brittle and damaged as the mother, Joe Cole charming and dangerous as the brother (in one of only two male roles in the film). And Tracey Thorn provides the perfect soundtrack of woozy, dreamy songs.\n\nFlight\n\nDenzel Washington as a pilot whose personal habits come under scrutiny after a crash landing. He’s excellent, of course, giving the role depth and complexity. And the scene of the crash is one of the more terrifying air disaster sequences I’ve seen.\n\nFrances Ha\n\nGerwig is utterly beguiling (though Frances would no doubt be infuriating in real life), and the film is warm and funny with moments of poignancy. The whole thing has a Nouvelle Vague feel to it, accentuated by the score, which includes some of Georges Delarue’s music for Le Mépris.\n\nFull Time\n\nExcellent French drama, starring, Laure Calamy, Noémie in Dix pour cent (Call my Agent) as a single parent, running (literally and metaphorically) to keep up with the various elements of her life (childcare, job, chasing her feckless ex for maintenance, commuting in the midst of strikes). It ramps up the tension to an almost unbearable level (particularly if one has ever had to juggle in this way and knows that feeling of utter panic).\n\nFuriosa\n\nThoroughly entertaining, visually brilliant, with great performances from both Anya Taylor Joy and Alyla Browne as the even younger Furiosa. Chris Hemsworth is virtually unrecognisable thanks to wig and prosthetic nose in his role as the bonkers war leader Dementus. Tom Burke is arguably somewhat wasted in a very taciturn action role as Praetorian Jack, which requires him to exchange smouldering looks with Furiosa but gives him little other opportunity to flesh out his character. I enjoyed it all hugely, but it does suffer from that inevitable prequel problem – we know where it all must end up. The film even segues into the early part of Fury Road, and the end credits include brief snippets of both films. So, whilst the action along the way is thrilling, we are waiting for what we know must happen rather than genuinely wondering what will happen.\n\nGood\n\nI saw this twice, firstly in the film version starring Viggo Mortensen, and again in the NT production with David Tennant. It was a great deal more effective as theatre than film – the movie version filled out bits of plot that were perhaps better left ambiguous, and the device where the protagonist hears music at key moments worked much better in the very stylised theatre version. The use of actors to play multiple roles worked, for the most part, although it required some concentration, particularly in relation to Sharon Small (playing the wife, the mistress/second wife, the mother and an SS colleague) to be sure who was who. Both Mortensen and Tennant were superb in the lead roles. The play asks how a ‘good’ person could collaborate with evil, a perennial question about the Nazi era, and C P Taylor shows how the protagonist – an ordinarily decent person, if lacking in empathy, compromises his values gradually, tiny step by tiny step until he is fully identified with the regime.\n\nGood Grief\n\nA charming but not awfully deep study of the aftermath of a sudden bereavement. I had a lump in my throat once or twice, but I couldn’t entirely identify with these people and their world. Still, it had its moments.\n\nGreyhound\n\nHanks being an ordinary hero again, this time shepherding his escort destroyer group as it protects an Allied convoy against U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. Not a remarkable film or performance, but good, solid stuff.\n\nThe History Boys\n\nAlan Bennett’s script is brilliant, waspish, funny but with undertones of real melancholy. Excellent performances from the ‘boys’ too. But it felt weird that the issue of sexual molestation, however mild, by a teacher is treated so lightly, so benevolently, both by those on the receiving end and by the film itself, which doesn’t really question their reactions.\n\nThe Hours\n\nI wasn’t totally convinced by Nicole Kidman’s take on Virginia Woolf – I’m not sure if it was the nose, or rather the knowledge that it wasn’t Kidman’s, though Bradley Cooper’s prosthesis, whilst being more controversial, didn’t get in the way of his performance in Maestro. I expected Woolf to be fiercer, perhaps. Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep are both superb, and the interlinking narratives, with Mrs Dalloway as the connecting thread, are moving and powerful. And the film reminds me that I must read Mrs Dalloway….\n\nJust Mercy\n\nPowerful fact-based drama about justice and race in the US. Michael B Jordan and Jamie Foxx are great as the lawyer and accused man respectively. The film’s main weakness lies in the treatment of their opponents: as the Guardian reviewer says, ‘It distracts from the reality of the case and of ongoing cases such as this, turning racists into pantomime bad guys rather than presenting them far more chillingly as real people who have normalised their hatred’.\n\nKidnapped\n\nFascinating historical drama from Italy about the 1851 kidnapping of a Jewish child after a maid in the household secretly baptises him on what she thinks may be his deathbed. It’s based on a real case, features a compelling performance by Barbara Ronchi as the child’s mother, and superb work by Aidan Hallett, in a non-speaking role, as one of the Pope’s servants.\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans\n\nWhat a film. I remember loving it when I first saw it, but it blew me away all over again. From that opening sequence, with Day-Lewis running through the woods, to the dramatic clifftop climax, it’s tense, violent, incredibly romantic and completely absorbing. I’ll be honest, DDL usually inspires more admiration than adoration from me, but here I was with Cora all the way.\n\nLittle Women\n\nThe 1991 version, with Wynona Ryder as Jo. Pretty good, until the end when Jo goes a bit too girly over the Prof. I think I’ve been spoiled for other versions by Gerwig’s, which is now one of my annual Xmas watch and have a bit of a cry films, and whose rearrangement of the chronology (it seemed blasphemous at first, not to open with ‘Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents’) brings such depth and nuance, without taking anything away fr"
