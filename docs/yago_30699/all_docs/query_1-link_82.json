He takes up the post on 1 March 2012.\n\nThe new chair, created especially for him, spans both the School of Arts and the School of Social Sciences, where he will be teaching undergraduates and taught postgraduate programmes. Courses may include areas of urban planning and human geography, Reading for Writing, and Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Society. It is the first time the University has appointed a cross-School position between Arts and Social Sciences; the post reflects Willâ€™s wide talent as an author and a prolific reader.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/22/fiction.willself\n\nWill Self finds naturalistic novels 'preposterous', preferring satire to 'make people think'. His latest book, The Butt, is a political allegory modelled on Heart of Darkness\n\nIn November, if everything goes according to plan, Will Self will launch his third book in 12 months. He's completing a story cycle called Liver. \"It's two novellas and two stories, all on a liverish theme,\" he says. \"One's about an alien who cultivates human alcoholics to use their livers as a kind of foie gras. And I'm just doing the second draft of this novella about a woman who goes to Zurich with liver cancer to have an assisted suicide.\"\n\nPsychogeography, a selection of the columns he writes for the Independent, came out last November. And this month he's publishing The Butta 350-page novel that he describes as \"a little bit of a jeu d'esprit\". So, he says, \"it's an odd year for me. The muse is frogmarching me, I'm afraid to say. It's not in my control. The muse seems to have become rather ... Hitlerite. Tea? How strong do you like it?\"\n\nSelf, who prefers to write his fiction on a typewriter, adds that his daily word count is lower than it used to be, \"partly because I shifted to the Imperial Good Companion, which is a slower machine, about four or five years ago. Writing on a manual makes you slower in a good way, I think. You don't revise as much, you just think more, because you know you're going to have to retype the entire fucking thing. Which is a big stop on just slapping anything down and playing with it.\" Joan Didion once told an interviewer that she used to retype her whole draft every morning to get back in the rhythm. \"I'm not that good a typist,\" Self says incredulously. \"I'd aim to write, on a first draft, not a great amount any more, only about 1,200 words a day. I write the book through. And then I start rewriting it, in successive waves.\"\n\nBorn in London in 1961, Self grew up in Hampstead Garden Suburb. His father, Peter Self, was a former Economist staffer with a chair in public administration at the LSE; his mother, Elaine Rosenbloom, was a transplanted New Yorker who was in flight, Self says, \"from her Jewishness\". It was \"not a happy home\", and Self soon discovered drugs and alcohol. By the time he left Oxford, where he studied philosophy, he was addicted to heroin. His first story collection, The Quantity Theory of Insanity (1991), which he put together after a spell in rehab in the 80s, won praise from Doris Lessing and Martin Amis and launched him as a media figure. As well known in the 90s for his drink and drug intake as he was for his novels and journalism, Self has been clean for the past eight years. He continues to write prolifically and also serves as a mordantly effective TV presence on shows ranging from Question Time to Have I Got News For You.\n\nHis new book tells the story of an American tourist visiting an imagined continent, part Australia, part Iraq, with \"a bit of southeast Asia there as well\". The novel's \"Anglo\" settler class likes moaning about the dark-skinned indigenous population, aka the \"bloody bing-bongs\", some of whom have launched an armed insurgency, complete with roadside bombings. Subtitled \"An Exit Strategy\", The Butt, Self says, is \"a political allegory\", though it's not meant to be decoded in one particular way. It's modelled in part on Heart of Darkness, which he sees as being \"deeply ambivalent about colonialism\". Conrad's story \"can be read as a critique of colonialism\", he says, but it can also be read \"as a book about the contamination of the west by some awful, chthonic, primal rhythm. The way it's appropriated by whatever political agenda happens to be going - that's just an example of what a good book it is. It's got many possible readings, and I wanted The Butt to have more than one possible reading in that way.\"\n\nSome of his novel's ambiguities gather around the smoking bans that the Anglos are keen on, which are partly responsible for the central character's troubles with the law. Self, who's been cutting down himself, is \"not particularly opposed to smoking bans. If the only flag of liberation you have to wave is a Silk Cut, it's a pretty feeble kind of revolution.\" But in the book, \"as the crazed anthropologist says at the end, it's more a question of what these utilitarian conceptions of social morality imply about the way in which we think about our civilisation\". Self relates this to the west's \"tendency to pitch up in places, imposing its own morality and its own kind of civil ethic on something it doesn't even understand\". Despite, or because of, the Kurtz-like anthropologist's activities, the \"actual indigenous people\" in the novel \"remain as unknowable at the end as they were at the beginning\".\n\nSelf is more self-questioning and less broodingly sardonic than you'd expect from his media profile, but he knows what he likes. He finds naturalistic novels \"preposterous\" - he laughs a wheezing laugh - \"most of the time. They're far more about an invented reality even than the things I write.\" As for character, he's never been very interested: \"Doesn't do it for me.\" He has just been reading Martin Amis's The Second Plane and says: \"He has this great riff about how it's enough to dismiss a work of fiction now if the critic doesn't like the characters - a conception of fiction as a sort of tea party.\" He also considers novelistic \"depth psychology - not that I read a lot of fiction - not very true\". In life, \"people's motivations are so often not just obscure to them, but absolutely fucking mad\". He briefly reconsiders: \"I am interested in characters. But they don't come first.\" Wasn't it said that his last novel had a new psychological depth? \"Yeah, there you go. My heart sank.\"\n\nHe is friendly with Amis and admires him hugely, though their political views, he says, are \"radically different. I don't know where Martin gets this terrible animus from, and I don't know where he gets the anxiety from as well.\" After September 11, Self thought \"for about a week, that there must be a bit of re-evaluation about what the project is. But then I decided that it wasn't necessary\" - another wheezing laugh - \"because my sort of fictional philosophy seemed, if not to anticipate 9/11, certainly not to disallow it as an event. It wasn't a black swan, for me, in quite that way. Maybe I'm deluding myself. But maybe that's the thing about being a pessimist-stroke-meliorist. You don't really expect things necessarily to be that great.\"\n\nWhen Self was starting out as a writer, he seemed to go at things in a nihilistic way. How did he reconcile that with the moralistic business of being a satirist? \"It's a very fair question. One of the things that animates young satirists - and usually the young satirists are the good ones - is a very childish cynicism about the world: 'You're all shit! It's all shit!' This sort of adolescent, lurking in his room, popping his spots in the mirror and writing in pus. There's nothing wrong with that, it's actually very good, very pure. A lot of us had it and I was one such. But underneath it, there's a morality.\" The problem, he says, is that there isn't \"an unquestioned Judaeo-Christian moral framework to which you can get a reader to assent ... It was much easier for Swift because he knew well what his readership thought was right and wrong.\"\n\n\"I've always said,\" he continues, \"that my satire is about getting people to think.\" In the absence of an authoritative consensus morality, \"you're trying to get people to stop wanking and lying around thinking crap and just think about moral questions. I don't honestly think I've ever been in any real doubt about what my own personal moral notions are. They got lost for a while in the shitstorm of intoxicants. But they were never completely obliterated.\" What he is aware of, though, \"is that morality is a socio-cultural construct. I believe that, but it doesn't make me any more prey to moral relativism than anyone else. That, for me, is not a QED. Just because your morality derives from your place and time doesn't mean that you don't cleave to it any more. It just means that you have different ideas and expectations about the extent to which other people will.\"\n\nBefore \"things started stabilising\", Self would leave town to write. \"I still go away a bit,\" he says. But these days this mostly involves walking. Last winter, he walked from Kennedy airport to downtown Manhattan, an experience he turned into an essay. In June, he's flying to Los Angeles and walking from the airport to Hollywood, then over into the San Fernando Valley, musing along the way on \"the death of film as the dominant cultural discourse\".\n\nSelf doesn't really go for \"the sort of ley line, Gog and Magog\" aspect of psychogeographical writing, the \"frothing at the mouth about the feng shui of Canary Wharf\". He says his wife, the journalist Deborah Orr, \"thinks it's just an excuse for me to get out of the house. She thinks the whole intellectual superstructure is arrant bullshit, that people like me and Iain Sinclair are ... wankers, basically, in the nicest possible way. She may have a point. But for me, it's a way of abandoning all the intellectual and psychic clutter of writing, while being supplied with this very pure narrative, which is just a picaresque.\"\n\nLater, he bridles at a suggestion that his famous drug problem started in adolescent rebellion. \"No, no, no,\" he says, \"not at all, none of it, none of it. That's a misreading. I'm an arch-conformist. In fact, one of my favourite movies is The Conformist. I'm exactly what my parents would have wished me to be. Obviously, the hard drug addiction was very upsetting for them. But I went to Oxford, I'm a writer - where's the rebellion? They were left-wing, middle-class intellectuals. Like me.\"\n\nHe broods on \"addict-creative lives\". Beyond a certain point, \"if addicts continue to work, they repeat themselves quite slavishly. Hunter Thompson was really finished by 1972.\" He's happier picturing the clean-living JG Ballard, \"who has this marvellous image of himself tying kids' shoes with one hand while typing with the other. I find that quite hard. But I'm getting there.\""
