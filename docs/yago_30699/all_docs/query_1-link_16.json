        "text": "“Immortality and its Discontents: Greek Gods and the Modern Search for Eternal Life\"\n\nIf it wasn't good enough for the Greek gods, why do we think it will be good enough for us?\n\nPresented by Deborah Lyons, Professor of Classics, Miami University\n\nTuesday, March 12, 2024 at 11 a.m.\n\nLenfest Learning Commons in John Stewart Memorial Library, Wilson College\n\nThis event is open to the public and free of charge.\n\nDeborah Lyons is the author of Dangerous Gifts: Gender and Exchange in Ancient Greece (Austin 2012), Gender and Immortality: Heroines in Ancient Greek Myth and Cult (Princeton 1997) and the co-editor (with K. Raaflaub) of Ex Oriente Lex: Near Eastern Influences on Greek and Roman Law, essays by Raymond Westbrook (Baltimore 2015) and (with R. Westbrook) of Women and Property in Ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean Societies (Washington, DC 2005). Her current project is “Immortality and its Discontents,” on ancient Greek views about the eternal life of their gods. She has just been promoted to Professor of Classics at Miami University (Ohio, USA).\n\nHistory of the Orr Forum\n\nSince its inception in 1964 the Orr Forum has been Wilson College’s most widely-known and perhaps most prestigious academic event. Prior to the establishment of the Orr Forum, the College sponsored annually what was called “Devotional Week” with a series of chapel services, sermons, and a communion service.\n\nDuring the 1962-1963 academic year Associate Professor of Bible and Religion Harry Buck and Professor Graham Jamieson, Chairman of the Department of The Bible and Religion, discussed the use of a fund established by Thomas J. Orr in honor of his parents Mary and William. The aim was to establish an endowed lecture series that would bring to campus outstanding thinkers in various aspects of religion studies. President Paul Swain Havens enthusiastically endorsed the plan, approving its implementation in 1964. The following year Professor Raymond Anderson joined the Department and quickly became an invaluable part of the Orr Forum personnel.\n\nTopics addressed by the Orr Forum have reflected the wide and shifting interests in religion studies in America. The series began with Edward Jurji, Professor of Islamic and Comparative Religion, Princeton Theological Seminary, speaking on convergence and prejudice. Succeeding years have been devoted to such topics as bioethics; race relations; the relationship of church and state; the nexus between religion and environmental issues; the AIDS crisis; and contemporary Islam.\n\nRecent Orr Scholars\n\n“Wondrous Bodies: Gnosticism, Trans Spirituality, and the Intermediate Sex”\n\nC. Libby, Assistant Teaching Professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Pennsylvania State University\n\nC.

Libby's current project, Engendering Feeling: Religious Affects, Transphobia, and Historicity places textual accounts of premodern gender crossing in conversation with contemporary scholarship in transgender studies. This project aims to make sense of the contested terrain of gendered embodiment by examining how affective intensities (anger, wonder, desire, fear) are produced around and through sex and gender transgressive bodies.\n\nJesus’ Parables as Jewish Stories and Understanding Jesus means Understanding Judaism (2022)\n\nDr. Amy-Jill Levine, Rabbi Stanley M.

Dr. Susanne Mrozik of Mount Holyoke College examines what is at stake—and for whom—in international and local campaigns to grant women access to full ordination as Buddhist nuns (bhikkhuni). She focuses particular attention on Sri Lanka, where she spent two years conducting ethnographic research on the 1998 revival of the Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhist nun’s order.\n\nSusanne Mrozik is a gender specialist in Buddhist studies.

Herdt, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor of Christian Ethics\n\nYale Divinity School\n\nAutonomy After Virtue\n\nI distinguish among four conceptions of autonomy and argue that the contemporary turn to tradition, given its self-conscious character, is best understood not as a repudiation of autonomy but as tradition-constituted autonomy.\n\nListen to Audio File\n\nScripture (Secular and Sacred) in the Task of Ethical Formation\n\nIn conversation with Martha Nussbaum, postliberal theologians, and Nicholas Boyle, I reflect on the role that secular literature (especially the novel) and sacred scripture play in ethical formation, and how these might fruitfully be understood in relation to one another.\n\nListen to Audio File\n\nForming a More Perfect Union: Democratic Virtues, Proximate Goods, and Christian FormationI ask whether and how the retrieval of virtue ethics and the turn to tradition-constituted autonomy might contribute to improving the quality of public life in American society today.\n\nListen to Audio File\n\nRepresenting Muhammad: Competing Images of Islam's Prophet (2011)\n\nGuest Speaker: Dr. Klecia Ali\n\nAssistant Professor of Religion\n\nBoston University\n\nAn Assistant Professor of Religion at Boston University, Kecia Ali received her Ph.D. in Religion from Duke University, with a specialization in Islamic Studies.
