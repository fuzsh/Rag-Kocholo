        "text": "In Motherwell, the late writer and i columnist Deborah Orr recalls her working-class childhood in the eponymous Scottish town under the watchful eye of her formidable mother, Win.\n\nThe Orr family lived in the shadows of both the Ravenscraig steelworks, which employed half the town’s adults (and later made them redundant), and the shifting social and economic values that would propel Deborah to university and a job as a journalist, to her parents’ bewilderment.\n\nOrr’s early years (she was born in 1962) were devoted largely to pleasing Win, who was capable of kindness when she got her way, but of blistering cruelty when she didn’t. She would frequently tell her daughter: “If I had my time again, I wouldn’t have kids,” which was hurtful enough, but later came Orr’s realisation that she had inherited her mother’s sharp tongue. “One of the hard things about seeing behind your mother’s mask is that you have to look at yourself as well. I am my mother’s daughter,” she observes.\n\nBefore writing Motherwell, Orr endured a succession of traumas, including Win’s decline and death (her father, John, had already died in 2007), her own treatment for breast cancer and an acrimonious divorce from the novelist Will Self, with whom she had two children. Last year, her cancer returned. Orr died last October, aged 57; she would never get to see her book published.\n\nAnd what a book it is – vivid, visceral, uncompromising, electrifying in its candour. Decades may have elapsed since the events detailed, but the wounds inflicted by Win continued to fester. On catching Deborah peeking at the Scrabble tiles during a game, her mother made a badge emblazoned with the words “I am a cheat” and made her wear it on a trip around town. When she was older, her parents opened an unsent letter written by Orr to her university boyfriend. From this, they gleaned that their daughter was having sex, which led to “the most terrible inquisition of my life”.\n\nRead More:\n\nTributes paid to Deborah Orr: A ‘purveyor of articulate tender Motherwell rage’\n\nOrr is nothing if not self-aware as she exposes these private moments within a family obsessed with maintaining appearances. “Is it memoir therapy?” she wonders, “Or is it vengeance?”\n\nShe is frequently funny, recalling Win’s competitiveness over a pub lasagne (she made hers with a jar of Dolmio, but that didn’t stop her being sniffy about everyone else’s). Orr’s humour, apparent in her newspaper columns, was inherited from her father who, nodding to the Evelyn Waugh classic then on TV, once joked “Birdshead Regurgitated” when the dog coughed up a dead sparrow.\n\nThere is tenderness in her writing – Win could be “loving, attentive, fun, busy, creative, good company” – but sadness, too. Narcissism and controlling behaviour are running themes. Win’s narcissistic tendencies were caused by personal disappointment and a life spent worried about what others thought; Orr’s were brought about by childhood trauma and the condition that is being a writer.\n\nFollowing her parents’ death and her own divorce, Orr reveals that she was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder, though the process of writing the book helped to ease the symptoms. That she will never see Motherwell published is a tragedy but, as she notes in the final chapter, she found catharsis in taking “complete control, of my own family, in my own words”."
