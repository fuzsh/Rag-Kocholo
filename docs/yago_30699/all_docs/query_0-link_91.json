        "text": "Writer Will Self is lucky to be alive after the roof of his house collapsed while he was inside.\n\nThe journalist and author led his children to safety after the roof came down along with those of several neighbours in Stockwell, south London, on Tuesday night.\n\nHe told the Evening Standard newspaper: \"It was like the front of my house fell off.\n\n\"I got the children out to the back of the property because it was all about to go.\n\n\"Once things had stopped falling off I got them out through the front door. Somebody could have been killed.\"\n\nSelf's wife, Guardian columnist Deborah Orr, tweeted about the incident.\n\nShe said: \"Our house, and the four neighbouring houses, are OVER. But no one is hurt and we're staying with @blackdogyellow tonight.\"\n\nShe later added: \"No one knows what caused it yet, but it's emergency services central. Helicopters, the lot.\"\n\nLondon Fire Brigade confirmed it sent four engines and a fire rescue unit to the scene just before 9pm (6am AEST on Wednesday), with firefighters helping one elderly woman to safety.\n\nWatch manager Simon Phillips said: \"Firefighters helped an elderly woman to safety and a further 16 people left properties before we arrived.\n\n\"There was a lot of rubble in the street and we used a thermal imaging camera over the debris to make sure no one was trapped underneath.\n\n\"It's a busy road and it's very lucky nobody was walking outside. Otherwise they could have been seriously injured.\"\n\n©\n\n© PAA 2012 2024"
