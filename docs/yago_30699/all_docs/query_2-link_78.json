        "meta_description": "<u>The Postcard</u>\n\t\n\tThe front side of an advertising card promoting performances of Making Marilyn in May 2024. \n\t\n\tThe card was designed by Andrew Kay and the photography was by Chris Bissell.\n\t\n\t<u>Julie Burchill</u>\n\t\n\tThe British journalist Julie Burchill was born on the 3rd. July 1959 in Frenchay, Bristol.\n\t\n\tBeginning as a staff writer at the New Musical Express at the age of 17, she has since contributed to newspapers such as The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Times and The Guardian.\n\t\n\tHer writing, which was described by The Observer in 2002 as &quot;outrageously outspoken&quot; and &quot;usually offensive,&quot; has been the subject of legal action. \n\t\n\tBurchill is also a novelist, and her 2004 novel Sugar Rush was adapted for television.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill - The Early Years</u>\n\t\n\tJulie Burchill was educated at Brislington Comprehensive School in Bristol. Her father was a Communist union activist who worked in a distillery, and her mother had a job in a cardboard box factory. \n\t\n\tIn 2010, Burchill wrote of her parents: \n\t\n\t&quot;I don't care much for families. I adored \n\tmy mum and dad, but to be honest I don't \n\tmiss them much now they're dead.&quot; \n\t\n\tThree years later she contradicted this when she said she couldn't return to Bristol, as every time she heard someone speaking with her parents' Bristol accent it would remind her how much she missed them. \n\t\n\tJulie did not attend university, leaving the A-levels she had started a few weeks earlier in order to begin writing for the New Musical Express (NME).\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill's Early Career</u>\n\t\n\tJulie began her writing career at the NME in 1976 at the age of 17 after responding (coincidentally with her future husband Tony Parsons) to an advert in that paper.\n\t\n\tThe ad was seeking &quot;hip young gunslingers&quot; to write about the then-emerging punk movement. She gained the job by submitting a &quot;eulogy&quot; of Patti Smith's Horses. \n\t\n\tShe later wrote that at the time she only liked black music, and said: \n\t\n\t&quot;When I actually heard a punk record, \n\tI thought, 'Oh my Lord! This is not music, \n\tthis is just shouting'.&quot; \n\t\n\tIndeed, she managed to decry the first self-released punk album in the UK, The Outsiders' Calling on Youth featuring Adrian Borland: \n\t\n\t&quot;Apple-cheeked Ade has a complexion \n\tthat would turn a Devon milkmaid green \n\twith envy.&quot;\n\t\n\tFortunately for her, as she later said:\n\t\n\t&quot;Punk was over in two years. That was \n\tthe only damn good thing about it.&quot;\n\t\n\t She left her position at the NME at the age of 20, and started freelancing in order to be able to write about other subjects, although she has never completely given up writing about pop music.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill in the 1980's</u>\n\t\n\tJulie's main employers after the NME were The Face and The Sunday Times, where she wrote about politics, pop, fashion and society. She was also their film critic from 1984 to 1986.\n\t\n\tShe admitted in 2008 to making up film reviews and having &quot;skived&quot; from screenings, and her ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, has admitted to attending screenings on her behalf.\n\t\n\tDuring the Falklands War in 1982, Burchill argued that the military dictatorship of General Galtieri represented a greater evil, and she wrote articles favourable to Margaret Thatcher. \n\t\n\tHer sympathy for Thatcher helped in gaining a column for The Mail on Sunday, where in 1987 she went against the paper's usual political line by urging its readers to vote Labour. \n\t\n\tThough she claims to like the Mail on Sunday, she said of journalists on the Daily Mail in 2008: \n\t\n\t&quot;Everybody knows that hacks are the biggest \n\tbunch of adulterers, the most misbehaving \n\tprofession in the world – and you have people \n\twriting for the Daily Mail writing as though they \n\tare vicars ... moralising on single mothers and \n\twhatnot.&quot;\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill Into the 1990's</u>\n\t\n\tBurchill has spoken repeatedly and frankly of her relationship with drugs, writing that:\n\t\n\t&quot;I have put enough toot up my admittedly \n\tsizeable snout to stun the entire Colombian \n\tarmed forces&quot;.\n\t\n\tJulie also declared that: \n\t\n\t&quot;As one who suffered from chronic shyness \n\tand a low boredom threshold ... I simply can't \n\timagine that I could have ever had any kind \n\tof social life without cocaine, let alone have \n\treigned as Queen of the Groucho Club for a \n\tgood part of the '80's and '90's.&quot;\n\t\n\tWhile Burchill has frequently drawn on her personal life for her writing, her personal life has been a subject of public comment, especially during this period, when &quot;everything about her – her marriages, her debauchery, her children – seemed to be news.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn 1991, Burchill, Landesman and Toby Young established a short-lived magazine called Modern Review. It was launched under the slogan &quot;Low culture for high brows.&quot; \n\t\n\tThe &quot;Fax war&quot; in 1993 between Burchill and author Camille Paglia, published in the Modern Review, gained much attention.\n\t\n\tThe magazine lasted until 1995, when Burchill and her colleagues fell out.\n\t\n\tJulie met Charlotte Raven through the magazine, with whom she had a much publicised affair..\n\t\n\tJulie said in an interview with Lynn Barber in 2004:\n\t\n\t&quot;I was only a lesbian for about \n\tsix weeks in 1995.&quot; \n\t\n\tIn a 2000 article she referred to:\n\t\n\t&quot;My very enjoyable six months \n\tof lesbianism.&quot; \n\t\n\tIn 1995, Burchill wrote a column for The Times, titled &quot;I'm a bitch, and I'm proud&quot;, in which she argued that women should reclaim the word 'bitch,' used as a slur. She wrote: \n\t\n\t&quot;It is the nature of these things that, in recent years, \n\tthe slighted have taken steps to repossess the slight; \n\tthus, we have blacks who call each other 'nigger', \n\tpansies who call each other 'queer' and upper-class \n\tcretins who quite happily call each other 'Henry'.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn 1996, the actor, author, playwright and theatre director Steven Berkoff won a libel action against Burchill in respect of one of her articles, published in the Sunday Times newspaper, which included comments suggesting that he was &quot;hideously ugly&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe judge ruled that Burchill's actions &quot;held him to ridicule and contempt.&quot; \n\t\n\tThe late 1990's were a turbulent period for Burchill, as she has recalled:\n\t\n\t&quot;I got the heave-ho from my cushy billet at the Sunday \n\tExpress, where I later learned my nickname had been \n\t&quot;Caligula’s Horse&quot; because my best friend – briefly the \n\teditor – had appointed me. \n\tFor the first time in my brilliant career, no one wanted \n\tto hire me. Somehow I limped into a column on the \n\tdoddering Punch – and then I got the boot from there, \n\ttoo! \n\tSurely I had reached the mythical rock bottom at last?&quot;\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill From 2000 to 2004</u>\n\t\n\tA user of cocaine, sharing in the activity in the company of Will Self among others, she was positive about her use in The Guardian in 2000 when defending actress Danniella Westbrook for Westbrook's loss of her nasal septum because of cocaine use. \n\t\n\tJournalist Deborah Orr, who was then married to Self, was scathing in The Independent of Burchill and her article: \n\t\n\t&quot;She does not identify herself as a \n\tcocaine addict, so she has no pity \n\tfor Ms Westbrook.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn revenge for Deborah's article, Burchill invented a supposedly long-standing crush on Will Self with the intention of upsetting Orr. \n\t\n\tA letter in The Independent in June 2000 from the head waitress at the Groucho Club at the time, Deborah Bosley, caused a minor stir. Responding to an article by Yvonne Roberts, Bosley, at the time the partner of Richard Ingrams, a long standing critic of Burchill, stated that Burchill was merely &quot;a fat bird in a blue mac sitting in the corner&quot; when ensconced at the Groucho.\n\t\n\tBurchill on Beckham (2001), a short book about David Beckham's life, career, and relationship with Victoria Beckham, attracted some of the worst notices since Jeffrey Archer's heyday. \n\t\n\tOne reviewer wrote:\n\t\n\t&quot;Burchill is to football writing what \n\tJimmy Hill is to feminist polemics.&quot; \n\t\n\tAccording to Robert Winder in the New Statesman: \n\t\n\t&quot;The book fits in with Burchill's theme of praising \n\tthe working class; Burchill presents Beckham as \n\tan anti-laddish symbol of old working-class values – \n\the reminds her of those proud men of her childhood, \n\t'paragons of generosity, industry and chastity'.&quot;\n\t\n\tBurchill's career was in trouble; she had been sacked by the revived Punch magazine. However she was appointed by Orr  in 1998 to write  a weekly column in the Guardian. Julie wrote for the Guardian for five years until 2003.  \n\t\n\tBurchill frequently thanked Deborah Orr for rescuing her. One of the pieces she wrote for The Guardian was in reaction to the murder of BBC TV presenter Jill Dando in 1999. She compared the shock of Dando's murder to finding a &quot;tarantula in a punnet full of strawberries&quot;. \n\t\n\tIn 2002 she narrowly escaped prosecution for incitement to racial hatred following a Guardian column where she described Ireland as being synonymous with child molestation, Nazi-sympathising, and the oppression of women. \n\t\n\tBurchill had expressed anti-Irish sentiment several times throughout her career, announcing in the London journal Time Out that:\n\t\n\t&quot;I hate the Irish, I think \n\tthey're appalling&quot;.\n\t\n\tJulie supported the Iraq War, writing in The Guardian in 2003 that:\n\t\n\t&quot;I am in favour of a smaller war now \n\trather than a far worse war later.&quot;\n\t\n\tShe criticised those opposed to the war as &quot;pro-Saddam apologists&quot;. \n\t\n\tShe justified her stance by stating that:\n\t\n\t&quot;This war is about freedom, justice – and oil.\n\tBecause Britain and the United States sell \n\tweapons to Iraq, it is our responsibility to \n\tredress our greed and ignorance by doing \n\tthe lion's share in getting rid of him&quot;.\n\t\n\tBurchill left The Guardian acrimoniously, saying in an interview that they had offered her a sofa in lieu of a pay rise. She stated that she left the newspaper in protest at what she saw as its &quot;vile anti-Semitism&quot;.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill From 2005 to 2009</u>\n\t\n\tBurchill was an early critic of the fashion for denigrating lower social classes as &quot;chavs&quot;. In 2005, she presented the Sky One documentary In Defence of Chavs. \n\t\n\tJulie commented in an interview for The Daily Telegraph at the time:\n\t\n\t&quot;Picking on people worse off than \n\tyou are isn't humour. It's pathetic, \n\tit's cowardly and it's bullying.&quot;  \n\t\n\tShe went on to say:\n\t\n\t&quot;It's all to do with self-loathing. ... The \n\tmiddle classes can't bear to see people \n\thaving more fun, so they attack Chavs \n\tfor things like their cheap jewellery. \n\tIt's jealousy, because they secretly \n\tknow Chavs are better than them. \n\tThey're even better looking.&quot;\n\t\n\tFollowing her departure from The Guardian, in early 2005 she moved to The Times, who were more willing to meet her demands, doubling her previous salary. \n\t\n\tShortly after starting her weekly column, she referred to George Galloway, but appeared to confuse him with former MP Ron Brown, reporting the misdeeds of Brown as those of Galloway:\n\t\n\t&quot;He incited Arabs to fight \n\tBritish troops in Iraq.&quot; \n\t\n\tShe apologised in her column, although The Times paid damages thought to have been £50,000.\n\t\n\tIn 2006, The Times dropped her Saturday column, and arranged a more flexible arrangement with Burchill writing for the daily paper. \n\t\n\tLater it emerged, during a Guardian interview published in 2008, that eventually she &quot;was given the jolly old heave ho&quot; by The Times, and paid off for the last year of her three-year contract, still receiving the £300,000 she would have earned if she had been obliged to provide copy. \n\t\n\tJulie later described her columns for her abbreviated Times contract, which ended abruptly in 2007, thus: \n\t\n\t&quot;I was totally taking the piss. I didn't \n\tspend much time on them and they \n\twere such arrant crap.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn February 2006, she announced plans for a year's sabbatical from journalism, planning, among other things, to study theology. In June 2007, she announced that she would not be returning to journalism, but instead would concentrate on writing books and TV scripts and finally undertake a theology degree. However she returned to writing for The Guardian.\n\t\n\tBurchill's co-written book with Chas Newkey-Burden, Not in My Name: A Compendium of Modern Hypocrisy, appeared in August 2008, and is dedicated &quot;to Arik and Bibi&quot; (Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu). \n\t\n\tAccording to Gerald Jacobs, writing for The Jewish Chronicle in 2008:\n\t\n\t&quot;This book does not merely stand \n\tup for Israel, it jumps up and down, \n\tcheers and waves its arms&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe newspaper described her as &quot;Israel's staunchest supporter in the UK media&quot;. When asked if Israel has any flaws, she responded: \n\t\n\t&quot;Yes. They are much too tolerant of \n\ttheir freaking neighbours, much too \n\treasonable&quot;.\n\t\n\tShe declared in 2005, after Ariel Sharon's withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip, that:\n\t\n\t&quot;Israel is the only country I would \n\tf**king die for. He's the enemy of \n\tthe Jews. Chucking his own people \n\toff the Gaza; to me that's disgusting&quot;.\n\t\n\tBesides writing occasional pieces for The Guardian, Julie wrote four articles for the centre-right politics and culture magazine Standpoint between July and October 2008.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill in the 2010's</u>\n\t\n\tAt the end of June 2010 it was announced that Burchill would be writing exclusively for The Independent, contributing a weekly full-page column for the paper. \n\t\n\tThe connection lasted less than 18 months. Burchill wrote her last column for The Independent at the end of October 2011. Admitting that he had tried to recruit Burchill for The Sun in the 1980's, Roy Greenslade commented: \n\t\n\t&quot;My admittedly occasional reading of \n\ther columns in recent years has left me \n\tfeeling that she realises her old schtick \n\tis no longer working. She has run out \n\tof steam – and sympathetic newspaper \n\teditors&quot;.\n\t\n\tCommenting on the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Burchill wrote in The Independent: \n\t\n\t&quot;It would be wonderful to think that what replaces \n\tMubarak will be better. But here's the thing about \n\tMiddle Eastern regimes: they're all vile. \n\tThe ones that are 'friendly' are vile, and the ones \n\tthat hate us are vile. \n\tRevolutions in the region have a habit of going \n\thorribly wrong, and this may well have something \n\tto do with the fact that Islam and democracy appear \n\tto find it difficult to co-exist for long.&quot;\n\t\n\tOn the 13th. January 2013, Burchill wrote an article for The Observer defending Suzanne Moore after a reference by Moore to transsexuals had been greeted with a great deal of criticism. \n\t\n\tIn Burchill's view, it showed the &quot;chutzpah&quot; of transsexuals to have their &quot;cock cut off and then plead special privileges as women&quot;. \n\t\n\tThere were a number of objections to her writing from members of the transgender community and non-transgender community alike. The editor of The Observer, John Mulholland, responded on the comments page to what he described as &quot;many emails protesting about this piece&quot; and stated that he would be looking into the issue. \n\t\n\tLiberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, formerly a junior Minister for Women and Equalities, called for the dismissal of Burchill and Mulholland in response to the piece. The article was withdrawn from the website the following day and replaced with a message from Mulholland, but reappeared on the Telegraph website. \n\t\n\tOn 18 January 2013, The Observer's Readers Editor Stephen Pritchard defended the decision to remove the article from the newspaper's website, quoting the editor who took that decision as saying:\n\t\n\t&quot;This clearly fell outside what we might consider \n\treasonable. The piece should not have been \n\tpublished in that form. I don't want the Observer \n\tto be conducting debates on those terms or with \n\tthat language. It was offensive, needlessly. We \n\tmade a misjudgment and we apologise for that&quot;.\n\t\n\t<u>Julie Burchill on Religion and Philo-Semitism</u>\n\t\n\tIn her 1987 essay collection Damaged Gods: Cults and Heroes Reappraised, Burchill criticised what she called &quot;the anti-Semitism of politicized American blacks&quot; such as Jesse Jackson, who had referred to New York City as &quot;Hymietown.&quot; \n\t\n\tBurchill wrote:\n\t\n\t&quot;Imagine how the blacks would have gnashed \n\ttheir diamond-studded teeth if a Jewish leader \n\thad publicly referred to Harlem as 'Nigger-town'!&quot;.\n\t\n\tIn 1999, Burchill said she &quot;found God&quot;, and had become a Lutheran and later a &quot;self-confessed Christian Zionist&quot;. \n\t\n\tIn June 2007 Julie announced that she would undertake a theology degree, although she subsequently decided to do voluntary work instead as a way to learn more about Christianity.\n\t\n\tIn June 2009, The Jewish Chronicle reported that Burchill had become a Friend of Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue and was again considering a conversion to Judaism. \n\t\n\tAccording to The JC, she had attended Shabbat services for a month, and was studying Hebrew. Julie described herself as an &quot;ex-Christian&quot;, pointing out that she had been pondering on her conversion since the age of 25. \n\t\n\tBurchill said that:\n\t\n\t&quot;At a time of rising and increasingly vicious anti-\n\tSemitism from both left and right, becoming \n\tJewish especially appeals to me. ... Added to the \n\tfact that I admire Israel so much, it does seem to \n\tmake sense – assuming of course that the Jews \n\twill have me&quot;.\n\t\n\tJulie wrote in November 2012: \n\t\n\t&quot;The things I love about the Jews are: their \n\treligion, their language and their ancient \n\tcountry&quot;.\n\t\n\tBurchill however clashed with Rabbi Elli Tikvah Sarah of the Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue, and the Rabbi's lesbian partner, Jess Woods. \n\t\n\tAmong the reasons for their differences was Rabbi Sarah's defence of Muslims and her advocacy of the Palestinian cause. In Burchill's words, the rabbi &quot;respects PIG ISLAM&quot;.\n\t\n\tRabbi Sarah told The Independent in September 2014: \n\t\n\t&quot;The problem is Burchill doesn’t have any \n\tin-depth knowledge. \n\tI can imagine her endlessly watching the film \n\tExodus with Paul Newman. She’s got a kind \n\tof Hollywood view of Jews. You know, ‘Jews \n\tare so clever, we’ve survived ...'.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn 2014, Burchill's crowdfunded book Unchosen: The Memoirs of a Philo-Semite was published. Tel Aviv-based writer Akin Ajayi in Haaretz thought:\n\t\n\t&quot;The reactionary solipsism of Unchosen \n\tis far removed from the affectionate \n\twarmness that a love of the Jewish people \n\tcan be&quot;.\n\t\n\tBurchill's ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, considered it to be:\n\t\n\t&quot;An exhilarating and exasperating mix \n\tof the utterly brilliant and the totally \n\tbonkers&quot;. \n\t\n\tHe observed that:\n\t\n\t&quot;There are plenty of Jews Julie doesn't love,\n\tincluding the millions of Jews around the \n\tworld who have ever criticised Israel. \n\tHer love is blind, deaf and dumb to such an \n\tobvious contradiction&quot;.\n\t\n\tGuardian columnist Hadley Freeman wrote: \n\t\n\t&quot;Burchill divides up the chosen people into \n\tGood Jews (hardliners, Israelites) and Bad \n\tJews (liberal Jews) with the enthusiasm of \n\tan anti-Semite. Hilariously, she sets herself \n\tup as the Jewishness Police, railing against \n\tJews who are not Jewish enough&quot;.\n\t\n\tIn his review in The Independent, Keith Kahn-Harris described Unchosen as:\n\t\n\t&quot;Occasionally touching, sometimes bigoted \n\tand sporadically hilarious, but it often \n\tdegenerates into EDL-style abuse that lacks \n\tany redeeming wit.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn The Guardian Will Self wrote:\n\t\n\t&quot;I’m afraid I can’t really dignify her latest \n\toffering with the ascription 'book', nor the \n\tcontents therein as 'writing' – rather they \n\tare sophomoric, hammy effusions, \n\twrongheaded, rancorous, and pathetically \n\tself-aggrandising.&quot;\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill's Other Books and Television Programmes</u>\n\t\n\tBurchill has written novels and made television documentaries. Her lesbian-themed novel for teenagers Sugar Rush (2004) was adapted into a television drama series produced by Shine Limited for Channel 4. Lenora Crichlow's portrayal of the central character Maria Sweet inspired the 2007 sequel novel Sweet. \n\t\n\tBurchill has made television documentaries about the death of her father from asbestosis in 2002 (BBC Four) and Heat magazine broadcast on Sky One in 2006.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Welcome to the Woke Trials</u>\n\t\n\tWelcome To The Woke Trials: How #Identity Killed Progressive Politics was planned to be issued by Tabatha Stirling of Stirling Publishing in the summer of 2021 after being dropped by its original publisher following Burchill's defamatory tweets to Ash Sarkar. \n\t\n\tOn the 14th. March 2021, when referencing her new publisher, Burchill announced that, with Stirling:\n\t\n\t&quot;I've found someone \n\twho's JUST LIKE ME.&quot; \n\t\n\tStirling is alleged to have written a series of articles for Patriotic Alternative as &quot;Miss Britannia&quot;, describing her son's school as &quot;a hellhole for sensible, secure White boys&quot; and claimed:\n\t\n\t&quot;There is one member of staff who is \n\topenly gay, and I mean RuPaul extra \n\tgay&quot;.\n\t\n\tOn the 16th. March 2021, Burchill announced that she would not publish her book with Stirling Publishing, the same day she issued a public apology for libel and harassment of Sarkar. The book was subsequently published by Academica Press.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Responses</u>\n\t\n\tBurchill has described her own style as the writing equivalent of screaming and throwing things. For her novel Sugar Rush her publicist described her as &quot;Britain's most famous and controversial journalist&quot;. \n\t\n\tOne of her most consistent themes is the championing of the working class against the middle class, and she has been particularly vocal in defending 'chavs'. According to Will Self:\n\t\n\t&quot;Burchill's great talent as a journalist is\n\tto beautifully articulate the inarticulate \n\tsentiments and prejudices of her \n\treaders&quot;.\n\t\n\tFor Michael Bywater:\n\t\n\t&quot;Burchill's insights were, and remain, \n\tnegligible, on the level of a toddler \n\thaving a tantrum&quot;. \n\t\n\tJohn Arlidge wrote in The Observer in 2002: \n\t\n\t&quot;If Burchill is famous for anything it is \n\tfor being Julie Burchill, the brilliant, \n\tunpredictable, outrageously outspoken \n\twriter who has an iconoclastic, usually \n\toffensive, view on everything.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn November 1980, former Sex Pistols front man John Lydon gave an interview to Ann Louise Bardach in which he referred to Burchill and Tony Parsons as:\n\t\n\t&quot;Toss-bag journalists, desperately\n\ttrying to get in on something.&quot; \n\t\n\tLydon was incensed by Burchill and Parsons attributing his talent to his alleged use of amphetamines.\n\t\n\tIn October 1999, in an article for The Guardian, Julie wrote: \n\t\n\t&quot;That young men succeed in suicide more \n\toften than girls isn't really the point. Indeed, \n\tthe more callous among us would say that \n\tit was quite nice for young men finally to \n\tfind something that they're better at than \n\tgirls&quot;.\n\t\n\tAfter a previous occasion when Burchill wrote &quot;suicides should be left to get on with it&quot;, she &quot;received a small number of letters from people whose sons had killed themselves&quot;.\n\t\n\tIn 2002, her life was the subject of a one-woman West End play, Julie Burchill is Away, by Tim Fountain, with Burchill played by her friend Jackie Clune. \n\t\n\tA sequel by Fountain, Julie Burchill: Absolute Cult, followed in 2014, with Lizzie Roper in the central role.\n\t\n\tIn 2003, Burchill was ranked number 85 in Channel 4's poll of 100 Worst Britons. The poll was inspired by the BBC series 100 Greatest Britons, though it was less serious in nature. The aim was to discover the &quot;100 worst Britons we love to hate&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe poll specified that the nominees had to be British, alive and not currently in prison or pending trial. In 2005, on the 25th. anniversary of the murder of John Lennon, she told The Guardian: \n\t\n\t&quot;I don't remember where I was, but I was \n\treally pleased he was dead, as he was a \n\twife-beater, gay-basher, anti-Semite and \n\tall-round bully-boy.&quot;\n\t\n\tIn the essay &quot;Born Again Cows&quot; published in Damaged Gods (1987), she wrote: \n\t\n\t&quot;When the sex war is won, prostitutes \n\tshould be shot as collaborators for their \n\tterrible betrayal of all women.&quot;\n\t\n\tOn the 6th. June 2021, and shortly after the announcement of the birth of Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Burchill tweeted: \n\t\n\t&quot;What a missed opportunity. They could \n\thave called it Georgina Floydina!”\n\t\n\tThis was a reference to George Floyd. Her comments were widely condemned, with racial equality activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu stating: \n\t\n\t&quot;Lilibet is referred to as 'IT'. The utter \n\tdisrespect &amp; dehumanisation of \n\t#HarryandMeghan children because \n\tof their proximity to ‘Blackness’ is Racist.&quot;\n\t\n\tActress Kelechi Okafor wrote: \n\t\n\t&quot;Likening baby Lilibet to George Floyd \n\tis to hone in on the fact she isn't fully \n\twhite...She refers to Lilbet as 'it' even \n\tthough it has been announced that the \n\tbaby is a girl and she could've addressed \n\ther as such...Disgusting scenes.&quot;\n\t\n\tOn the 8th. June, via her Facebook account, Burchill announced that she had been sacked by The Daily Telegraph as a result of her online comments.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Libel</u>\n\t\n\tIn 2020, Burchill posted a series of defamatory tweets of Ash Sarkar, which included claims that she condones paedophilia and is supportive of Islamist terrorism. \n\t\n\tBurchill called on her Facebook followers to &quot;wade in on Twitter&quot; against &quot;the Islamists&quot; and the &quot;nonces&quot;. As a result of the comments, her publisher, Little, Brown Book Group, cancelled the scheduled publication of Welcome to the Woke Trials, stating that her comments about Islam were “not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint”.\n\t\n\tIn March 2021, after being sued for libel and harassment, Burchill retracted her comments, issued a full apology and paid substantial damages to Sarkar, including her legal costs.\n\t\n\tBurchill stated: \n\t\n\t&quot;I should not have sent these tweets, \n\tsome of which included racist and \n\tmisogynist comments regarding Ms \n\tSarkar's appearance and her sex life.&quot; \n\t\n\tShe further apologised for &quot;liking&quot; posts calling on Sarkar to kill herself, and promised to refrain from any further harassment of Sarkar.\n\t\n\t-- <u>Julie Burchill's Personal Life</u>\n\t\n\tBurchill married Tony Parsons (whom she met at NME) in 1979 at the age of 20. She left Parsons three years later, leaving behind a son, which was followed by years of rancour in the media, described in 2002 as &quot;a steady stream of vitriol in both directions.&quot;\n\t\n\tJulie had claimed to have persevered with the &quot;sexual side&quot; of their marriage &quot;by pretending that my husband was my friend Peter York&quot;. \n\t\n\tHer relationships, particularly with Parsons, have featured in her work; Parsons later wrote that:\n\t\n\t&quot;It's like having a stalker. I don't \n\tunderstand her fascination with \n\tsomeone whom she split up with \n\t15 years ago.&quot;\n\t\n\tImmediately after her relationship with Parsons, Burchill married Cosmo Landesman, with whom she also had a son. She split from Landesman in 1992. The sons from her marriages with Parsons and Landesman lived with their fathers after the separations. \n\t\n\tShe married for a third time in 2004, to Daniel Raven, around 13 years her junior, and the brother of her former lover Charlotte Raven. She wrote of the joys of having a &quot;toyboy&quot; in her Times column in 2010. \n\t\n\tFellow NME journalist/author Paul Wellings wrote about their friendship in his book I'm A Journalist...Get Me Out of Here:\n\t\n\t&quot;She has written about her lesbian relationships, \n\tand declared that &quot;I would never describe myself \n\tas 'heterosexual', 'straight' or anything else. \n\tEspecially not 'bisexual' (it sounds like a sort of \n\tcommunal vehicle missing a mudguard). \n\tI like 'spontaneous' as a sexual description&quot;.\n\t\n\tIn 2009 Julie said that she was only attracted to girls in their 20's, and since she was now nearly 50:\n\t\n\t&quot;I really don't want to be an \n\told perv. So best leave it&quot;.\n\t\n\tJulie has lived in Brighton and Hove since 1995, and a book on her adopted home town titled Made in Brighton (Virgin Books) was published in April 2007. \n\t\n\tHer house in Hove was sold (and demolished for redevelopment as high-density flats) around 2005 for £1.5 million, of which she has given away £300,000, citing Andrew Carnegie:\n\t\n\t&quot;A man who dies rich, dies shamed.&quot;\n\t\n\tBurchill's second son, Jack Landesman, died by suicide in June 2015, aged 29. In an article for The Sunday Times Magazine, Julie wrote of his inability over many years to experience pleasure and the serious mental health issues from which he suffered.",

        "text": "The Postcard\n\nThe front side of an advertising card promoting performances of Making Marilyn in May 2024.\n\nThe card was designed by Andrew Kay and the photography was by Chris Bissell.\n\nJulie Burchill\n\nThe British journalist Julie Burchill was born on the 3rd. July 1959 in Frenchay, Bristol.\n\nBeginning as a staff writer at the New Musical Express at the age of 17, she has since contributed to newspapers such as The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Times and The Guardian.\n\nHer writing, which was described by The Observer in 2002 as \"outrageously outspoken\" and \"usually offensive,\" has been the subject of legal action.\n\nBurchill is also a novelist, and her 2004 novel Sugar Rush was adapted for television.\n\n-- Julie Burchill - The Early Years\n\nJulie Burchill was educated at Brislington Comprehensive School in Bristol. Her father was a Communist union activist who worked in a distillery, and her mother had a job in a cardboard box factory.\n\nIn 2010, Burchill wrote of her parents:\n\n\"I don't care much for families. I adored\n\nmy mum and dad, but to be honest I don't\n\nmiss them much now they're dead.\"\n\nThree years later she contradicted this when she said she couldn't return to Bristol, as every time she heard someone speaking with her parents' Bristol accent it would remind her how much she missed them.\n\nJulie did not attend university, leaving the A-levels she had started a few weeks earlier in order to begin writing for the New Musical Express (NME).\n\n-- Julie Burchill's Early Career\n\nJulie began her writing career at the NME in 1976 at the age of 17 after responding (coincidentally with her future husband Tony Parsons) to an advert in that paper.\n\nThe ad was seeking \"hip young gunslingers\" to write about the then-emerging punk movement. She gained the job by submitting a \"eulogy\" of Patti Smith's Horses.\n\nShe later wrote that at the time she only liked black music, and said:\n\n\"When I actually heard a punk record,\n\nI thought, 'Oh my Lord! This is not music,\n\nthis is just shouting'.\"\n\nIndeed, she managed to decry the first self-released punk album in the UK, The Outsiders' Calling on Youth featuring Adrian Borland:\n\n\"Apple-cheeked Ade has a complexion\n\nthat would turn a Devon milkmaid green\n\nwith envy.\"\n\nFortunately for her, as she later said:\n\n\"Punk was over in two years. That was\n\nthe only damn good thing about it.\"\n\nShe left her position at the NME at the age of 20, and started freelancing in order to be able to write about other subjects, although she has never completely given up writing about pop music.\n\n-- Julie Burchill in the 1980's\n\nJulie's main employers after the NME were The Face and The Sunday Times, where she wrote about politics, pop, fashion and society. She was also their film critic from 1984 to 1986.\n\nShe admitted in 2008 to making up film reviews and having \"skived\" from screenings, and her ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, has admitted to attending screenings on her behalf.\n\nDuring the Falklands War in 1982, Burchill argued that the military dictatorship of General Galtieri represented a greater evil, and she wrote articles favourable to Margaret Thatcher.\n\nHer sympathy for Thatcher helped in gaining a column for The Mail on Sunday, where in 1987 she went against the paper's usual political line by urging its readers to vote Labour.\n\nThough she claims to like the Mail on Sunday, she said of journalists on the Daily Mail in 2008:\n\n\"Everybody knows that hacks are the biggest\n\nbunch of adulterers, the most misbehaving\n\nprofession in the world – and you have people\n\nwriting for the Daily Mail writing as though they\n\nare vicars ... moralising on single mothers and\n\nwhatnot.\"\n\n-- Julie Burchill Into the 1990's\n\nBurchill has spoken repeatedly and frankly of her relationship with drugs, writing that:\n\n\"I have put enough toot up my admittedly\n\nsizeable snout to stun the entire Colombian\n\narmed forces\".\n\nJulie also declared that:\n\n\"As one who suffered from chronic shyness\n\nand a low boredom threshold ... I simply can't\n\nimagine that I could have ever had any kind\n\nof social life without cocaine, let alone have\n\nreigned as Queen of the Groucho Club for a\n\ngood part of the '80's and '90's.\"\n\nWhile Burchill has frequently drawn on her personal life for her writing, her personal life has been a subject of public comment, especially during this period, when \"everything about her – her marriages, her debauchery, her children – seemed to be news.\"\n\nIn 1991, Burchill, Landesman and Toby Young established a short-lived magazine called Modern Review. It was launched under the slogan \"Low culture for high brows.\"\n\nThe \"Fax war\" in 1993 between Burchill and author Camille Paglia, published in the Modern Review, gained much attention.\n\nThe magazine lasted until 1995, when Burchill and her colleagues fell out.\n\nJulie met Charlotte Raven through the magazine, with whom she had a much publicised affair..\n\nJulie said in an interview with Lynn Barber in 2004:\n\n\"I was only a lesbian for about\n\nsix weeks in 1995.\"\n\nIn a 2000 article she referred to:\n\n\"My very enjoyable six months\n\nof lesbianism.\"\n\nIn 1995, Burchill wrote a column for The Times, titled \"I'm a bitch, and I'm proud\", in which she argued that women should reclaim the word 'bitch,' used as a slur. She wrote:\n\n\"It is the nature of these things that, in recent years,\n\nthe slighted have taken steps to repossess the slight;\n\nthus, we have blacks who call each other 'nigger',\n\npansies who call each other 'queer' and upper-class\n\ncretins who quite happily call each other 'Henry'.\"\n\nIn 1996, the actor, author, playwright and theatre director Steven Berkoff won a libel action against Burchill in respect of one of her articles, published in the Sunday Times newspaper, which included comments suggesting that he was \"hideously ugly\".\n\nThe judge ruled that Burchill's actions \"held him to ridicule and contempt.\"\n\nThe late 1990's were a turbulent period for Burchill, as she has recalled:\n\n\"I got the heave-ho from my cushy billet at the Sunday\n\nExpress, where I later learned my nickname had been\n\n\"Caligula’s Horse\" because my best friend – briefly the\n\neditor – had appointed me.\n\nFor the first time in my brilliant career, no one wanted\n\nto hire me. Somehow I limped into a column on the\n\ndoddering Punch – and then I got the boot from there,\n\ntoo!\n\nSurely I had reached the mythical rock bottom at last?\"\n\n-- Julie Burchill From 2000 to 2004\n\nA user of cocaine, sharing in the activity in the company of Will Self among others, she was positive about her use in The Guardian in 2000 when defending actress Danniella Westbrook for Westbrook's loss of her nasal septum because of cocaine use.\n\nJournalist Deborah Orr, who was then married to Self, was scathing in The Independent of Burchill and her article:\n\n\"She does not identify herself as a\n\ncocaine addict, so she has no pity\n\nfor Ms Westbrook.\"\n\nIn revenge for Deborah's article, Burchill invented a supposedly long-standing crush on Will Self with the intention of upsetting Orr.\n\nA letter in The Independent in June 2000 from the head waitress at the Groucho Club at the time, Deborah Bosley, caused a minor stir. Responding to an article by Yvonne Roberts, Bosley, at the time the partner of Richard Ingrams, a long standing critic of Burchill, stated that Burchill was merely \"a fat bird in a blue mac sitting in the corner\" when ensconced at the Groucho.\n\nBurchill on Beckham (2001), a short book about David Beckham's life, career, and relationship with Victoria Beckham, attracted some of the worst notices since Jeffrey Archer's heyday.\n\nOne reviewer wrote:\n\n\"Burchill is to football writing what\n\nJimmy Hill is to feminist polemics.\"\n\nAccording to Robert Winder in the New Statesman:\n\n\"The book fits in with Burchill's theme of praising\n\nthe working class; Burchill presents Beckham as\n\nan anti-laddish symbol of old working-class values –\n\nhe reminds her of those proud men of her childhood,\n\n'paragons of generosity, industry and chastity'.\"\n\nBurchill's career was in trouble; she had been sacked by the revived Punch magazine. However she was appointed by Orr in 1998 to write a weekly column in the Guardian. Julie wrote for the Guardian for five years until 2003.\n\nBurchill frequently thanked Deborah Orr for rescuing her. One of the pieces she wrote for The Guardian was in reaction to the murder of BBC TV presenter Jill Dando in 1999. She compared the shock of Dando's murder to finding a \"tarantula in a punnet full of strawberries\".\n\nIn 2002 she narrowly escaped prosecution for incitement to racial hatred following a Guardian column where she described Ireland as being synonymous with child molestation, Nazi-sympathising, and the oppression of women.\n\nBurchill had expressed anti-Irish sentiment several times throughout her career, announcing in the London journal Time Out that:\n\n\"I hate the Irish, I think\n\nthey're appalling\".\n\nJulie supported the Iraq War, writing in The Guardian in 2003 that:\n\n\"I am in favour of a smaller war now\n\nrather than a far worse war later.\"\n\nShe criticised those opposed to the war as \"pro-Saddam apologists\".\n\nShe justified her stance by stating that:\n\n\"This war is about freedom, justice – and oil.\n\nBecause Britain and the United States sell\n\nweapons to Iraq, it is our responsibility to\n\nredress our greed and ignorance by doing\n\nthe lion's share in getting rid of him\".\n\nBurchill left The Guardian acrimoniously, saying in an interview that they had offered her a sofa in lieu of a pay rise. She stated that she left the newspaper in protest at what she saw as its \"vile anti-Semitism\".\n\n-- Julie Burchill From 2005 to 2009\n\nBurchill was an early critic of the fashion for denigrating lower social classes as \"chavs\". In 2005, she presented the Sky One documentary In Defence of Chavs.\n\nJulie commented in an interview for The Daily Telegraph at the time:\n\n\"Picking on people worse off than\n\nyou are isn't humour. It's pathetic,\n\nit's cowardly and it's bullying.\"\n\nShe went on to say:\n\n\"It's all to do with self-loathing. ... The\n\nmiddle classes can't bear to see people\n\nhaving more fun, so they attack Chavs\n\nfor things like their cheap jewellery.\n\nIt's jealousy, because they secretly\n\nknow Chavs are better than them.\n\nThey're even better looking.\"\n\nFollowing her departure from The Guardian, in early 2005 she moved to The Times, who were more willing to meet her demands, doubling her previous salary.\n\nShortly after starting her weekly column, she referred to George Galloway, but appeared to confuse him with former MP Ron Brown, reporting the misdeeds of Brown as those of Galloway:\n\n\"He incited Arabs to fight\n\nBritish troops in Iraq.\"\n\nShe apologised in her column, although The Times paid damages thought to have been £50,000.\n\nIn 2006, The Times dropped her Saturday column, and arranged a more flexible arrangement with Burchill writing for the daily paper.\n\nLater it emerged, during a Guardian interview published in 2008, that eventually she \"was given the jolly old heave ho\" by The Times, and paid off for the last year of her three-year contract, still receiving the £300,000 she would have earned if she had been obliged to provide copy.\n\nJulie later described her columns for her abbreviated Times contract, which ended abruptly in 2007, thus:\n\n\"I was totally taking the piss. I didn't\n\nspend much time on them and they\n\nwere such arrant crap.\"\n\nIn February 2006, she announced plans for a year's sabbatical from journalism, planning, among other things, to study theology. In June 2007, she announced that she would not be returning to journalism, but instead would concentrate on writing books and TV scripts and finally undertake a theology degree. However she returned to writing for The Guardian.\n\nBurchill's co-written book with Chas Newkey-Burden, Not in My Name: A Compendium of Modern Hypocrisy, appeared in August 2008, and is dedicated \"to Arik and Bibi\" (Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu).\n\nAccording to Gerald Jacobs, writing for The Jewish Chronicle in 2008:\n\n\"This book does not merely stand\n\nup for Israel, it jumps up and down,\n\ncheers and waves its arms\".\n\nThe newspaper described her as \"Israel's staunchest supporter in the UK media\". When asked if Israel has any flaws, she responded:\n\n\"Yes. They are much too tolerant of\n\ntheir freaking neighbours, much too\n\nreasonable\".\n\nShe declared in 2005, after Ariel Sharon's withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip, that:\n\n\"Israel is the only country I would\n\nf**king die for. He's the enemy of\n\nthe Jews. Chucking his own people\n\noff the Gaza; to me that's disgusting\".\n\nBesides writing occasional pieces for The Guardian, Julie wrote four articles for the centre-right politics and culture magazine Standpoint between July and October 2008.\n\n-- Julie Burchill in the 2010's\n\nAt the end of June 2010 it was announced that Burchill would be writing exclusively for The Independent, contributing a weekly full-page column for the paper.\n\nThe connection lasted less than 18 months. Burchill wrote her last column for The Independent at the end of October 2011. Admitting that he had tried to recruit Burchill for The Sun in the 1980's, Roy Greenslade commented:\n\n\"My admittedly occasional reading of\n\nher columns in recent years has left me\n\nfeeling that she realises her old schtick\n\nis no longer working. She has run out\n\nof steam – and sympathetic newspaper\n\neditors\".\n\nCommenting on the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Burchill wrote in The Independent:\n\n\"It would be wonderful to think that what replaces\n\nMubarak will be better. But here's the thing about\n\nMiddle Eastern regimes: they're all vile.\n\nThe ones that are 'friendly' are vile, and the ones\n\nthat hate us are vile.\n\nRevolutions in the region have a habit of going\n\nhorribly wrong, and this may well have something\n\nto do with the fact that Islam and democracy appear\n\nto find it difficult to co-exist for long.\"\n\nOn the 13th. January 2013, Burchill wrote an article for The Observer defending Suzanne Moore after a reference by Moore to transsexuals had been greeted with a great deal of criticism.\n\nIn Burchill's view, it showed the \"chutzpah\" of transsexuals to have their \"cock cut off and then plead special privileges as women\".\n\nThere were a number of objections to her writing from members of the transgender community and non-transgender community alike. The editor of The Observer, John Mulholland, responded on the comments page to what he described as \"many emails protesting about this piece\" and stated that he would be looking into the issue.\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, formerly a junior Minister for Women and Equalities, called for the dismissal of Burchill and Mulholland in response to the piece. The article was withdrawn from the website the following day and replaced with a message from Mulholland, but reappeared on the Telegraph website.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, The Observer's Readers Editor Stephen Pritchard defended the decision to remove the article from the newspaper's website, quoting the editor who took that decision as saying:\n\n\"This clearly fell outside what we might consider\n\nreasonable. The piece should not have been\n\npublished in that form. I don't want the Observer\n\nto be conducting debates on those terms or with\n\nthat language. It was offensive, needlessly. We\n\nmade a misjudgment and we apologise for that\".\n\nJulie Burchill on Religion and Philo-Semitism\n\nIn her 1987 essay collection Damaged Gods: Cults and Heroes Reappraised, Burchill criticised what she called \"the anti-Semitism of politicized American blacks\" such as Jesse Jackson, who had referred to New York City as \"Hymietown.\"\n\nBurchill wrote:\n\n\"Imagine how the blacks would have gnashed\n\ntheir diamond-studded teeth if a Jewish leader\n\nhad publicly referred to Harlem as 'Nigger-town'!\".\n\nIn 1999, Burchill said she \"found God\", and had become a Lutheran and later a \"self-confessed Christian Zionist\".\n\nIn June 2007 Julie announced that she would undertake a theology degree, although she subsequently decided to do voluntary work instead as a way to learn more about Christianity.\n\nIn June 2009, The Jewish Chronicle reported that Burchill had become a Friend of Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue and was again considering a conversion to Judaism.\n\nAccording to The JC, she had attended Shabbat services for a month, and was studying Hebrew. Julie described herself as an \"ex-Christian\", pointing out that she had been pondering on her conversion since the age of 25.\n\nBurchill said that:\n\n\"At a time of rising and increasingly vicious anti-\n\nSemitism from both left and right, becoming\n\nJewish especially appeals to me. ... Added to the\n\nfact that I admire Israel so much, it does seem to\n\nmake sense – assuming of course that the Jews\n\nwill have me\".\n\nJulie wrote in November 2012:\n\n\"The things I love about the Jews are: their\n\nreligion, their language and their ancient\n\ncountry\".\n\nBurchill however clashed with Rabbi Elli Tikvah Sarah of the Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue, and the Rabbi's lesbian partner, Jess Woods.\n\nAmong the reasons for their differences was Rabbi Sarah's defence of Muslims and her advocacy of the Palestinian cause. In Burchill's words, the rabbi \"respects PIG ISLAM\".\n\nRabbi Sarah told The Independent in September 2014:\n\n\"The problem is Burchill doesn’t have any\n\nin-depth knowledge.\n\nI can imagine her endlessly watching the film\n\nExodus with Paul Newman. She’s got a kind\n\nof Hollywood view of Jews. You know, ‘Jews\n\nare so clever, we’ve survived ...'.\"\n\nIn 2014, Burchill's crowdfunded book Unchosen: The Memoirs of a Philo-Semite was published. Tel Aviv-based writer Akin Ajayi in Haaretz thought:\n\n\"The reactionary solipsism of Unchosen\n\nis far removed from the affectionate\n\nwarmness that a love of the Jewish people\n\ncan be\".\n\nBurchill's ex-husband, Cosmo Landesman, considered it to be:\n\n\"An exhilarating and exasperating mix\n\nof the utterly brilliant and the totally\n\nbonkers\".\n\nHe observed that:\n\n\"There are plenty of Jews Julie doesn't love,\n\nincluding the millions of Jews around the\n\nworld who have ever criticised Israel.\n\nHer love is blind, deaf and dumb to such an\n\nobvious contradiction\".\n\nGuardian columnist Hadley Freeman wrote:\n\n\"Burchill divides up the chosen people into\n\nGood Jews (hardliners, Israelites) and Bad\n\nJews (liberal Jews) with the enthusiasm of\n\nan anti-Semite. Hilariously, she sets herself\n\nup as the Jewishness Police, railing against\n\nJews who are not Jewish enough\".\n\nIn his review in The Independent, Keith Kahn-Harris described Unchosen as:\n\n\"Occasionally touching, sometimes bigoted\n\nand sporadically hilarious, but it often\n\ndegenerates into EDL-style abuse that lacks\n\nany redeeming wit.\"\n\nIn The Guardian Will Self wrote:\n\n\"I’m afraid I can’t really dignify her latest\n\noffering with the ascription 'book', nor the\n\ncontents therein as 'writing' – rather they\n\nare sophomoric, hammy effusions,\n\nwrongheaded, rancorous, and pathetically\n\nself-aggrandising.\"\n\n-- Julie Burchill's Other Books and Television Programmes\n\nBurchill has written novels and made television documentaries. Her lesbian-themed novel for teenagers Sugar Rush (2004) was adapted into a television drama series produced by Shine Limited for Channel 4. Lenora Crichlow's portrayal of the central character Maria Sweet inspired the 2007 sequel novel Sweet.\n\nBurchill has made television documentaries about the death of her father from asbestosis in 2002 (BBC Four) and Heat magazine broadcast on Sky One in 2006.\n\n-- Welcome to the Woke Trials\n\nWelcome To The Woke Trials: How #Identity Killed Progressive Politics was planned to be issued by Tabatha Stirling of Stirling Publishing in the summer of 2021 after being dropped by its original publisher following Burchill's defamatory tweets to Ash Sarkar.\n\nOn the 14th. March 2021, when referencing her new publisher, Burchill announced that, with Stirling:\n\n\"I've found someone\n\nwho's JUST LIKE ME.\"\n\nStirling is alleged to have written a series of articles for Patriotic Alternative as \"Miss Britannia\", describing her son's school as \"a hellhole for sensible, secure White boys\" and claimed:\n\n\"There is one member of staff who is\n\nopenly gay, and I mean RuPaul extra\n\ngay\".\n\nOn the 16th. March 2021, Burchill announced that she would not publish her book with Stirling Publishing, the same day she issued a public apology for libel and harassment of Sarkar. The book was subsequently published by Academica Press.\n\n-- Responses\n\nBurchill has described her own style as the writing equivalent of screaming and throwing things. For her novel Sugar Rush her publicist described her as \"Britain's most famous and controversial journalist\".\n\nOne of her most consistent themes is the championing of the working class against the middle class, and she has been particularly vocal in defending 'chavs'. According to Will Self:\n\n\"Burchill's great talent as a journalist is\n\nto beautifully articulate the inarticulate\n\nsentiments and prejudices of her\n\nreaders\".\n\nFor Michael Bywater:\n\n\"Burchill's insights were, and remain,\n\nnegligible, on the level of a toddler\n\nhaving a tantrum\".\n\nJohn Arlidge wrote in The Observer in 2002:\n\n\"If Burchill is famous for anything it is\n\nfor being Julie Burchill, the brilliant,\n\nunpredictable, outrageously outspoken\n\nwriter who has an iconoclastic, usually\n\noffensive, view on everything.\"\n\nIn November 1980, former Sex Pistols front man John Lydon gave an interview to Ann Louise Bardach in which he referred to Burchill and Tony Parsons as:\n\n\"Toss-bag journalists, desperately\n\ntrying to get in on something.\"\n\nLydon was incensed by Burchill and Parsons attributing his talent to his alleged use of amphetamines.\n\nIn October 1999, in an article for The Guardian, Julie wrote:\n\n\"That young men succeed in suicide more\n\noften than girls isn't really the point. Indeed,\n\nthe more callous among us would say that\n\nit was quite nice for young men finally to\n\nfind something that they're better at than\n\ngirls\".\n\nAfter a previous occasion when Burchill wrote \"suicides should be left to get on with it\", she \"received a small number of letters from people whose sons had killed themselves\".\n\nIn 2002, her life was the subject of a one-woman West End play, Julie Burchill is Away, by Tim Fountain, with Burchill played by her friend Jackie Clune.\n\nA sequel by Fountain, Julie Burchill: Absolute Cult, followed in 2014, with Lizzie Roper in the central role.\n\nIn 2003, Burchill was ranked number 85 in Channel 4's poll of 100 Worst Britons. The poll was inspired by the BBC series 100 Greatest Britons, though it was less serious in nature. The aim was to discover the \"100 worst Britons we love to hate\".\n\nThe poll specified that the nominees had to be British, alive and not currently in prison or pending trial. In 2005, on the 25th. anniversary of the murder of John Lennon, she told The Guardian:\n\n\"I don't remember where I was, but I was\n\nreally pleased he was dead, as he was a\n\nwife-beater, gay-basher, anti-Semite and\n\nall-round bully-boy.\"\n\nIn the essay \"Born Again Cows\" published in Damaged Gods (1987), she wrote:\n\n\"When the sex war is won, prostitutes\n\nshould be shot as collaborators for their\n\nterrible betrayal of all women.\"\n\nOn the 6th. June 2021, and shortly after the announcement of the birth of Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Burchill tweeted:\n\n\"What a missed opportunity. They could\n\nhave called it Georgina Floydina!”\n\nThis was a reference to George Floyd. Her comments were widely condemned, with racial equality activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu stating:\n\n\"Lilibet is referred to as 'IT'. The utter\n\ndisrespect & dehumanisation of\n\n#HarryandMeghan children because\n\nof their proximity to ‘Blackness’ is Racist.\"\n\nActress Kelechi Okafor wrote:\n\n\"Likening baby Lilibet to George Floyd\n\nis to hone in on the fact she isn't fully\n\nwhite...She refers to Lilbet as 'it' even\n\nthough it has been announced that the\n\nbaby is a girl and she could've addressed\n\nher as such...Disgusting scenes.\"\n\nOn the 8th. June, via her Facebook account, Burchill announced that she had been sacked by The Daily Telegraph as a result of her online comments.\n\n-- Libel\n\nIn 2020, Burchill posted a series of defamatory tweets of Ash Sarkar, which included claims that she condones paedophilia and is supportive of Islamist terrorism.\n\nBurchill called on her Facebook followers to \"wade in on Twitter\" against \"the Islamists\" and the \"nonces\". As a result of the comments, her publisher, Little, Brown Book Group, cancelled the scheduled publication of Welcome to the Woke Trials, stating that her comments about Islam were “not defensible from a moral or intellectual standpoint”.\n\nIn March 2021, after being sued for libel and harassment, Burchill retracted her comments, issued a full apology and paid substantial damages to Sarkar, including her legal costs.\n\nBurchill stated:\n\n\"I should not have sent these tweets,\n\nsome of which included racist and\n\nmisogynist comments regarding Ms\n\nSarkar's appearance and her sex life.\"\n\nShe further apologised for \"liking\" posts calling on Sarkar to kill herself, and promised to refrain from any further harassment of Sarkar.\n\n-- Julie Burchill's Personal Life\n\nBurchill married Tony Parsons (whom she met at NME) in 1979 at the age of 20. She left Parsons three years later, leaving behind a son, which was followed by years of rancour in the media, described in 2002 as \"a steady stream of vitriol in both directions.\"\n\nJulie had claimed to have persevered with the \"sexual side\" of their marriage \"by pretending that my husband was my friend Peter York\".\n\nHer relationships, particularly with Parsons, have featured in her work; Parsons later wrote that:\n\n\"It's like having a stalker. I don't\n\nunderstand her fascination with\n\nsomeone whom she split up with\n\n15 years ago.\"\n\nImmediately after her relationship with Parsons, Burchill married Cosmo Landesman, with whom she also had a son. She split from Landesman in 1992. The sons from her marriages with Parsons and Landesman lived with their fathers after the separations.\n\nShe married for a third time in 2004, to Daniel Raven, around 13 years her junior, and the brother of her former lover Charlotte Raven. She wrote of the joys of having a \"toyboy\" in her Times column in 2010.\n\nFellow NME journalist/author Paul Wellings wrote about their friendship in his book I'm A Journalist...Get Me Out of Here:\n\n\"She has written about her lesbian relationships,\n\nand declared that \"I would never describe myself\n\nas 'heterosexual', 'straight' or anything else.\n\nEspecially not 'bisexual' (it sounds like a sort of\n\ncommunal vehicle missing a mudguard).\n\nI like 'spontaneous' as a sexual description\".\n\nIn 2009 Julie said that she was only attracted to girls in their 20's, and since she was now nearly 50:\n\n\"I really don't want to be an\n\nold perv. So best leave it\".\n\nJulie has lived in Brighton and Hove since 1995, and a book on her adopted home town titled Made in Brighton (Virgin Books) was published in April 2007.\n\nHer house in Hove was sold (and demolished for redevelopment as high-density flats) around 2005 for £1.5 million, of which she has given away £300,000, citing Andrew Carnegie:\n\n\"A man who dies rich, dies shamed.\"\n\nBurchill's second son, Jack Landesman, died by suicide in June 2015, aged 29. In an article for The Sunday Times Magazine, Julie wrote of his inability over many years to experience pleasure and the serious mental health issues from which he suffered."
