        "text": "Furniture and family: cumbersome, practical, dated, ugly, beloved, solid, inherited and sometimes impossible to pass on to somebody else. In her beautiful memoir Motherwell, the late journalist, editor and media legend Deborah Orr tells the story of the latter through the stories found in the former. Specifically, we are taken, piece by piece, through the bureau that Orr’s parents – Win and John – bought when they got married, and in which was stored the holy relics of their family’s existence.\n\nAs Orr writes: “It was our tabula rasa, the place where the evidence of our family transactions with officialdom was filed.” From an old watch to a school report, a lock of baby hair to her late father’s library card, a white prayer book to a set of macramé pot hangers, each one opens up to give us a vivid and often painful portrait of post-war life in a Clydeside industrial town.\n\nIt is a strange experience to get to know the most intimate corners of a woman’s life – the childhood bullying, the sexual assaults, the family dysfunction, the ex-husband (Will Self) who once plucked a selection of books, a lighter and some vintage wire in-trays from her shelves to take up to his office without asking her, the time she defecated on a newspaper on her bedroom floor while on the phone to her mother rather than admit she had slept in – only once you know you will never meet her.\n\nOrr died in October last year, having battled cancer, divorce and a complex post-traumatic stress disorder. The memoir was finished just before. I will never now know her laugh, sit beside her in a newspaper office, smell her cigarette smoke or be guided by her editorial hand. But having read Motherwell, I feel – perhaps unfairly – that I have been let in on some of the secrets that made the woman.\n\nI have walked the quiet rooms of her council homes on Shields Drive and Clyde Terrace, I have run through the marshland on the edge of the now largely redundant industrial town chased by a pervert in a smart brown suit, I have eaten the Vesta curries and been stripped down to my vest and pants in the school library. I have been woven into the complicated, tight, sometimes troubling knots of this apparently nuclear family and watched the mushroom cloud that early experiences can produce.\n\nAll great truth, all great writing, all great humour is detail: the blue velvet jacket of the Rexard doll that Orr’s mother refused to hand over to her only daughter, the burning potatoes as a young Orr paints a triangle of clear nail varnish on a treasured pebble, the joke by her father as the dog coughed up part of a sparrow at his feet (“Birdshead Regurgitated”), the turquoise border on her grandmother’s copy of The People’s Friend, the crate of milk sitting tepid in a sink of water in the primary school classroom, the noise inside a steelworks.\n\nThis is what pulls Motherwell into something brilliant; not just an intelligent and honest personal memoir, not just an examination of narcissism, interdependence and repression, but a conjuring of a time, a moment in British history, that may otherwise be lost entirely. It is also funny. As funny, it would seem from the obituaries, as the woman herself. “Not long before I saw my first penis, a girl in class asked me if I knew what a penis was,” writes Orr, in the chapter that begins with her mother’s watch. “I told her authoritatively that it was a man who played the piano.”\n\nTolstoy’s adage that all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way is proved with insight and candour throughout Motherwell. Orr describes her mother as a narcissist – someone who demands the affection, approval and acquiescence of her family at every turn; someone who sees her own daughter as competition for male attention; someone who couldn’t bear her son saying that pub lasagne may be as good as her own. Narcissists, as Orr explains, “loathe themselves and need constant soothing, endless reassurance that they have worth, a mountain of worth, a universe of worth”.\n\nBind that to the restrictive sexual, social and economic expectations of Sixties and Seventies Britain and suddenly even learning to read, wanting to go to university, moving out of your mother’s house, keeping your own name and enjoying intercourse with your partner become sites of battle, outrage, betrayal and rejection between Orr and her parents. It is what ultimately pushes her away from her past. It is what drags her into the future we all heard about through her columns. It is the dislocation that made her an individual as well as the product of a family.\n\nAnd yet, like all of us, as Orr combs her way through the letters and badges, the newspaper clippings and albums that sat for years in that bureau, what she was and who she became tangle together in a tapestry of objects, anecdotes, memories and questions that is as poignant as it is prosaic. The everyday is the everyday, and within it is built the stuff of heartbreak, beauty, tragedy and joy. Who we are is picked out in the ephemera of who we were. Our junk can be our cornerstones, and Motherwell is an object lesson in memoir.\n\nMotherwell is published by W&N at £16.99. To order your copy call 0844 871 1514 or visit the Telegraph Bookshop"
