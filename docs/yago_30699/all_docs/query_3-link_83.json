        "text": "Stanley R. Orr, 92, of Radcliffe Drive, Waitsfield, passed away in the comfort of his family at the Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin on Thursday, January 1, 2009. Born in Calais on September 3, 1916, he was the son of the late Fred and Mabel (Slayton) Orr. On August 18, 1945, Stanley married the former Eleanor Wells in Plainfield.\n\nStanley was a graduate of the former Plainfield High School and as a young man he worked on the family farm in Calais. His specialty was raising turkeys. In 1946, he purchased the Hardware Store in Marshfield and with it founded a plumbing and heating business. Moving to Waitsfield in 1959, Stanley continued his plumbing and heating business and in addition, with his wife, began a ski lodge known as Orr's Ark, a longtime institution in the Mad River Valley. Stanley retired in 1975 and, with Eleanor, began traveling in their mobile home throughout the lower 48 states as well as Alaska, an adventure they completely enjoyed for nearly 30 years. Stanley also loved hunting and fishing.\n\nHis memberships included the Couples Club in Waitsfield, the Waitsfield United Church of Christ, the Valley Rotary Club and was a founding member of the Mad River Ridge Runners Snowmobile Club.\n\nStanley is survived by his wife of 63 years, Eleanor Orr of Waitsfield; a daughter, Deborah Orr of Moretown; a son, Reginald Orr and his wife Kathi of Waitsfield; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren; as well as nieces, nephews and extended family. Stanley was predeceased by two children, Peggy Orr and Brian Orr, as well as three sisters and seven brothers.\n\nMemorial services were held from the Waitsfield United Church of Christ on Wednesday, January 7, at 6:30 p.m. The family requests that flowers be omitted; rather memorial gifts would be appreciated to the Mad River Valley Ambulance Service, P.O. Box 305, Waitsfield, VT 05673. To send online condolences please visit www.perkinsparker.com."
