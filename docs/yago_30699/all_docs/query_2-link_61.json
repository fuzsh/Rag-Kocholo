Orr candidly examines her own upbringing in the town of Motherwell, Scotland, where she navigated a tumultuous relationship with her strong-willed mother, Win. As she reflects on her childhood experiences and the ways in which they shaped her own approach to motherhood, Orr grapples with the legacy of her upbringing and the impact of intergenerational patterns of behavior. Through evocative storytelling and a keen eye for detail, Orr paints a vivid portrait of her mother and the challenges they faced together, highlighting the ways in which the bond between mother and child can both nurture and wound.
