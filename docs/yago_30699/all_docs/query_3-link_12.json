        "text": "Deborah Ann Monroe-Orr (neé Davis) was born on July 15, 1974 to Silas Redd and Betty Davis in Phenix City, Alabama. After she graduated high school, Deborah realized she wanted more out of life, so she joined the United States Army. There, Deborah was able to travel the world and thrive in assignments where only a portion of her peers were able to match her drive, determination, and expertise.\n\nAs Deborah transitioned from the military, she continued to live life to the fullest, but in a different capacity. Those who were fortunate enough to get to know her were blessed by a beautiful and caring soul. Deborah was always willing to help and make sure others in need were taken care of, which was evident in her role as a devoted and loving wife, mother, sister, and friend. Some of her hobbies and interests were shopping, decorating for holidays, watching movies, traveling, and cuddling with her puppy.\n\nWhen Deborah was diagnosed with cancer, she was determined to not let her condition define her life. She continued to pursue her interests, spend time with loved ones, and radiate warmth and light. Her unwavering spirit persisted throughout that challenging time, allowing her to continue enjoying her days with family and friends.\n\nDeborah was preceded in death by her father, Silas Redd. She leaves in loving memory her husband, Anthony Orr; her daughters, Qadirah Monroe, Brianna Monroe, her step-daughters Kaela Orr, Jaeda Orr, and her beloved puppy-son, Mylo; mother, Betty Davis; siblings, Robert (Qubedine) Davis, Jerome (Mona) Davis, Gloria Davis, Johnnie Mae (Bryan) Phillips, Benjamin Davis, Patricia Davis, nephews, nieces, relatives and friends."
