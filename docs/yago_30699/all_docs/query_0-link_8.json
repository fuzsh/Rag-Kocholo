Self is talking about literary fiction. Or rather, its continual decline. “It’s hard to think of a literary novel that has been of any significance in our culture for a long, long time,” the 61-year-old English novelist, journalist, political commentator and broadcaster says from his home in Stockwell, south London.\n\n“I believe the serious novel will continue to be written and read, but it will be a subject for historical scholarship rather than public discourse,” he writes in his latest book, Why Read. The book of essays documents the enormous changes that have occurred over the past two decades. “I began writing a lot of these pieces shortly after there was the full inception of what I call bidirectional digital media,” says Self. “This was when the combination of the mobile phone and high-speed Wi-Fi meant it was possible for people to go online almost anywhere, any time.”\n\nThe book also aims to convince its audience that reading is a worthwhile endeavour. In an essay entitled “How Should We Read” Self argues that the ability to read and write – unlike, say, speech – isn’t hardwired into the human mind-brain. It may explain why reading always feels a little bit like striving, Self argues. But it also brings knowledge, understanding, empathy, pleasure and feeling.\n\nHe cites a scientific study from a book called Proust and the Squid, which notes how brain activity alters significantly when an individual is placed in an MRI scanner, while reading a complex passage of prose. The machine’s visual display shows millions of neurons lighting up like a Christmas tree. “Reading is as close as we can get to experiencing something, without actually experiencing it,” he says.\n\nIn Dopamine Nation, American psychiatrist Anna Lembke writes that “the smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation.” Self sees the modern mobile phone in similar terms. In 2017, he published Phone, which begins with 78-year-old Dr Zack Busner in the lobby of a Manchester hotel, gripping his phone, while drifting back into “the wormhole of memory”.\n\nThe novel was the final instalment in Self’s modernist trilogy, which also included Umbrella (2012), and Shark (2014). All three books experimented with language and punctuation, while also questioning the authority of the omniscient narrator. Most novels adhering to the laws of literary realism typically present space and time in a straightforward, linear manner. Self, however, believes this doesn’t reflect the complexity, speed, and confusion that our collective conscious experience entails, as modern human beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wrote and edited his trilogy via a rigorous creative process. First by long hand with a pen. The next draft went onto his typewriter. Finally, Self inputted the finished story onto his computer. “Writing, while staring at the computer screen, favours literalism over thinking in words,” he says. Self is referring here to the endless clickbait distraction and illusion that social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and TikTok provide. He believes they only reward vanity, profit and megalomania. “People marching up and down on social media pushing their products, banging their little drum and trying to sell shit is not a very edifying spectacle,” he says.\n\nWhy Read also has several essays in which Self, assuming the role of critical theorist, explores the works of various titans of 20th-century literature, including William S. Burroughs, Franz Kafka, W. G. Sebald, Joseph Conrad and George Orwell. A discussion about the latter sees Self putting the boot into his fellow countryfolk. “The English know fine well they live in a philistine culture,” he says. “Intellectual is a dirty word in England. There is not the same consideration for philosophical ideas in public life in England, as there is in France.”\n\nPeople marching up and down on social media ... banging their little drum and trying to sell shit is not a very edifying spectacle.\n\nWill Self\n\nSelf’s latest book also provides (albeit sparingly) the occasional glimpse into the author’s personal life. He married his first wife, Kate Chancellor in 1989. The couple had two children. By the mid-1990s, however, Self was still struggling with addiction, their relationship hit the rocks and they later divorced.\n\nIn 1997 Self’s private and public life momentarily merged to become a tabloid sensation. He was sacked from Britain’s Observer for shooting up heroin on then-British prime minister John Major’s plane. Self found love again that year, marrying the Scottish journalist, Deborah Orr. The couple had two children, and divorced in 2018. Orr died of breast cancer a year later.\n\nBorn in 1961 in London, Self was raised by “bookish but undisciplined parents.” His mother, Elaine Rosenbloom, was a Jewish New Yorker. His father, Peter Self, was a Londoner. “My liminal status as both a half an American person and as a half Jewish person, has always made me feel uncomfortable and not at home in English culture,” he says.\n\nFamily trauma could be another reason. Peter Self walked out on the family when Self was 11, and his brother, Jonathan, was nine. Self describes how the two boys regularly attended reading suppers in their north London home “with our depressed and only intermittently communicative mother”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngland in the 1970s was an odd setting to grow up in, he says. “I remember attending left-wing political rallies, where members of the paedophile information exchange would suddenly turn up, handing out leaflets advocating men-boy love.\n\n“My brother was sexually abused as a teenager and I got involved in heroin as a 17-year-old kid. What can I say? My parents were not bad people, they were just part of a cultural and social moment when people lost their way on what was acceptable for children to do,” he says.\n\nIn 1991, Self published his debut book, a collection of short stories, The Quantity Theory of Insanity. Two years later, he was listed as one of Granta magazine’s best young British novelists.\n\nToday, Self claims the British publisher’s prestigious literary list panders to political correctness, where gender and racial equality is deemed more important than the quality of literature being written. “In social terms it may be good, but in cultural terms it’s absolutely meaningless and simply reinforces this liberal notion that people’s identity is all that matters— whether they are white, black, male, female, gay or straight.”\n\nSelf describes himself as an autodidactic. Some claim he is a workaholic. Over the last three decades his output as a journalist and author has been consistently prolific. Self’s literary oeuvre contains 12 novels, six collections of short stories, and eight non-fiction books, including his 2019 memoir, Will. Many critics complained it was (excuse the pun) self-indulgent. The memoir mirrors Self’s uncompromising approach to fiction. “I wrote the book in the continuous present and in the third person in order to objectify my younger self,” he says.\n\nSelf has no time for the confessional autofiction style coming from authors such as Karl Ove Knausgard, whom he refers to as that “brooding, self-lacerating Norwegian”. “I feel a visceral and emotional reaction against people who deny the multiplicity of the self,” he says. “I-style memoirs are pure hogwash. A pack of lies, all of them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recovering alcoholic and heroin addict, Self says he was reluctant to write a confessional style memoir that preaches from the pulpit. The countless years he has spent walking the unpredictable road of hedonistic excess is already well documented in the public domain. Indeed, it was all part of Self’s well-crafted theatrical public persona as a rabble-rousing urbane literary genius. But he’s not convinced sobriety, which he now strictly adheres to, leads to either the palace of wisdom, or redemption.\n\nWhy Read also contains “Australia and I”, a direct transcript of a speech Self gave at the Melbourne Writers Festival in 2015 which documented how his father emigrated to Australia in the early 1980s and eventually took up Australian citizenship. Self was then still in his early 20s.\n\nHe visited his old man down under, and briefly found employment for six months in the Northern Territory, for the federal Land Department. Ever since, the author has taken a keen interest in Australian environmental issues. He notes how “the remaining outposts of indigenous people in central Australia are likely to become uninhabitable within the next decade because of the global climate emergency”.\n\n“Australian society remains institutionally and pervasively racist and represents many of the extreme aspects of contemporary anglophone culture,” Self adds, without reserve or apology.\n\nLoading\n\nIn 2012 Self was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Umbrella. That same year he was appointed Professor of Contemporary Thought at Brunel University in west London. “I’ve now stopped teaching literature because I cannot find students that are capable of understanding what literary influence is,” he says. “They simply haven’t read enough and don’t have the [required] fine grain of understanding.”\n\nSelf recalls how during the mid-1990s he was affectionately known as “the enfant terrible of English letters”. In the mid-2000s, he was a household name, regularly appearing on prime-time TV shows such as Grumpy Old Men, discussing everything from political satire, to highbrow art. However, his public persona has diminished over time. “My period of fame is over,” he admits. “It steadily decreased over the last 15 years because I’ve refused to engage in social media. But I was never comfortable with fame anyway, I certainly didn’t like the intrusions it brought into my private life.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooks and ideas, though, have always provided refuge from the madness of crowds. Self contemplates the countless hours and minutes he has spent alone, reading and writing, over the last quarter of a century. He compares it to being locked in solitary confinement, inside a papery prison.\n\nWe conclude our conversation by engaging in a thought experiment. Perhaps, with the aid of time travel, it would be possible to create an alternative Will Self: a carefree Homo Sapien who broke from the chains of the Gutenberg mind at an early age and become a tree surgeon instead.\n\n“Well, to paraphrase Nietzsche, I’m an amor fati kind of guy,” says Self, with cocky assurance. “There are no counterfactuals, and I cannot answer your question, although I appreciate the reason why you are asking it. I’ve had a great life. It’s been amazing and fascinating. And I have absolutely no regrets about it, whatsoever.”\n\nYou’re not dead yet, Will. Cheer up, old boy.\n\nWhy Read, by Will Self, published by Grove Press, is out now.\n\nThe Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.
