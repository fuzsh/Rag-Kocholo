        "text": "Quote: Tony Cowards @ 10th April 2015, 2:08 PM BST\n\nI was always taught that if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all, so if we're talking about all the current comedy shows on Radio 4 in the 6.30pm and 11pm slots, I'll say \"Ed Reardon's Week\" is quite good...\n\nAgreed, this is good comedy and very different to the panel shows that r4 keep on slapping on the schedule.\n\nAnyone listened to kevin eldon's thing late night on 4 also? Been debating wether I should record it or not for a while.\n\nI found the 'return' of Dead Ringers kind of promising but I soon realised they were doing the classic thing of re using and re using gags, and even the Christmas special seemed like a copy and paste of the previous series in some ways. Lewis Macloed Is Not Himself was ok but seemed to suffer from much the same writing issues. I think the writers may have written for both shows though so I suppose I shouldn't find that surprising.\n\nQuote: A Horseradish @ 12th April 2015, 4:24 PM BST\n\nThe return of Dead Ringers was reasonable although it suffered from being scheduled in the same hour as the hilarious Grant Shapps on Any Questions.\n\nYes, that's a very good description of how it was. It wasn't bad as such, in fact I'm rather fond of the program, and a few sketches really got me in stictches - the Micheal Portillo ones and the Andy Murray ice bucket challenge are two such ones that spring to mind. But in places it just was the same thing again and again in some ways..the downton ones were great but the scripting of them rarely seemed to change much for instance, apart from the plotline within the sketch.\n\nLemn Sissay. Occasionally interesting, not remotely funny, irritating narcissist.\n\nPutrid Will Self's hag of a wife was on Sue Perkins' Dilemma: Deborah Orr, the woman who rubbished the death of a man fighting ISIS - it's just the same as fighting for 7th century tyranny, apparently. What a rib tickler she was given the right hypothetical feedline. Not really, you'd get more laughs fighting in Syria.\n\nThere's a rare break from Bighead Brigstock currently, although that's not going to last.\n\nAt least Ed Reardon's back May 13th."
