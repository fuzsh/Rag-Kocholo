        "text": "William Woodard Self (born 26 September 1961) is an English satirical novelist, newspaper columnist and broadcaster.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nSo I was smacked up on the Prime Minister's jet – big deal.\n\nInterviewed by The Independent on Sunday, April 1997. [1]\n\nThe éminence cerise, the bolster behind the throne.\n\nThe Independent on Sunday, August 8, 1999\n\nOf the Queen Mother.\n\nThere can be no more thrilling idea of intimacy than connecting with someone through the agency of the written word. Here we meet, on the page, naked and unadorned: shorn of class, race, gender, sexual identity, age and nationality. The reader I seek is a tautology, for he/she is simply…the person who wants to read what I have written.\n\nThe Guardian, May 9, 2007. [2]\n\nI have a healthy appetite for solitude. If you don't, you have no business being a writer.\n\nThe Guardian, May 9, 2007. [3]\n\nI think of writing as a sculptural medium. You are not building things. You are removing things, chipping away at language to reveal a living form.\n\nQuoted by The Guardian [4]\n\nWealth is a form of power in our society. With great power comes great responsibility. If you have too much wealth, ipso facto, you have too much power - therefore you have too much responsibility - and you're a kind of dictator.\n\nThe Moral Maze, BBC Radio 4, October 1st, 2008.\n\nThings are only boring if you are boring.\n\n'Room 101', BBC2, March 19th, 2001.\n\nCampaigning at a school in Enfield in 2001, Tony Blair was caught unawares by a feisty British Asian sixth-former. Suddenly this apparition arose before him, demolishing Blair's points as speedily as he tried to make them. This time around the New Labour machine haven't wanted to risk any of that. The Emperor has been ferried from Potemkin village to Potemkin hospital, and before he arrives a rigged rent-a-crowd of \"ordinary people\" are brought in to wave little flags. Journalists have been \"embedded\" - undoubtedly the cadres were hoping that these trusties would begin to sympathise with the man upon whom their jobs depended [and] they'd cease to notice how much of what he said was utter shit.\n\nPsychic Geography 82 Fear and loathing on the Election trail, The Independent Magazine.\n\nAbout Self\n\n[edit]\n\nMy ex wants to divide up the contents of the former marital home by coming round, when I’m not there, putting a red dot on absolutely anything he wants, then getting me to organise it all into a place where he can have it picked up. Anyone else had this?\n\nAnyway. #MeToo.\n\nI have C-PTSD. I wonder why? His \"compassionate writings\" on mental illness make me want to throw up.\n\nI changed the locks long ago. He’s been litigating against me for more than two years, and I’m broke. I can’t afford a restraining order.\n\nFrom a series of tweets by Deborah Orr, Self's ex-wife, quoted in \"Will Self accused of cruelty in divorce row with Deborah Orr\" The Times (21 September 2018). Orr died from cancer a year later. Her twitter account has been deleted.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nOfficial Will Self site\n\nWill Self on IMDb\n\nProfile at Contemporary Writers\n\nGuardian Books author page: Will Self\n\nWill Self article in Issue 08 of TATE ETC. magazine\n\nThe Sweet Smell of Excess: Will Self, Bataille and Transgression\n\nA short interview: BBC\n\nInterview: Spike Magazine\n\nAudio Interview (available in Real Audio or mp3) at Salon.com\n\nSelf interviewed by the International Necronautical Society\n\nTranscript of Self's encounter with Richard Littlejohn interviewed on Radio Five Live by Nicky Campbell: BBC\n\nWill Self on why he writes\n\n\"The Principle\""
