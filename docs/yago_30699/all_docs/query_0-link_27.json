        "text": "I have been an admirer of Deborah Orr’s trenchant newspaper columns for many years. Challenging dogma with new perspectives, her writing is unpredictable, singular and always exciting as she forensically dissects life’s complexities and contradictions. And here we have it: finished just before her death from breast cancer at just 57 last year, her masterpiece — her memoir about growing up working-class in Motherwell, south-east of Glasgow, the daughter of John, a factory worker, and Win, a controlling enigma of a woman Orr spent her life trying to reconcile herself to and understand.\n\nIt’s the story of her family but it’s also a social commentary of Britain, from the introduction of council homes to the reign of Margaret Thatcher, the miners’ strikes and the move away from streaming in schools to entirely mixed-ability comprehensive education, at each juncture reflecting on the very real effect of political decisions and all their unintended consequences on real people’s lives.\n\nIt’s also Orr’s story as she traverses the social classes (“What was wrong with honest Heinz Salad Cream, deliciously tangy? Everything possible, I came to understand”), going against her parents’ wishes to get a degree from St Andrews and becoming the first female editor of the Guardian’s Weekend magazine before she was 30. (“I think they found my appetite for achievement exhausting,” she says of her parents.)\n\nNo one in Orr’s family, least of all the man she would marry and divorce acrimoniously, the author Will Self, comes away from her pen unscathed (“Is it memoir therapy? Or is it vengeance?”) but she is most unforgiving when she turns the scalpel on herself. There is a telling anecdote when Orr notes her father’s occupation in her marriage documents as “semi-skilled labourer”, a description which her mother finds hurtful. Orr, inexplicably, can’t understand why her mother is so upset by this but does admit that she used her childhood to amplify her success: “The more humble my beginnings, the more I appeared to have achieved… I emphasised my lowly parents to feel prouder of myself.”\n\nThis book is an exploration of what it is to “mother well” and why, despite her mother being a good mother in some ways, Orr struggled with her and struggled with so many of her relationships, even failing, in her eyes, to “mother well myself”.\n\nThis book is not perfect. Other people’s childhoods are not as endlessly fascinating to other people as our own are to ourselves, and despite her finely tuned antennae for diagnosing narcissistic behaviour in others, Orr often seems oddly unable to spot it in herself. But this is a fascinating look into the childhood of one of our most important journalists and an attempt after what she describes as “a decade of crisis” in her personal life to regain control of the narrative that shaped her.\n\nEarly in the book Orr describes how Win named all her dolls for her. “Win,” she writes, “was in charge of all the words.” Now, after her and her mother’s death, it’s Orr’s turn to “take charge… of my own family, in my own words”."
