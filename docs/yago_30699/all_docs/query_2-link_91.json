        "text": "There was a very good review of Motherwell in the Daily Mail - I went down into the BTL comments with a bit of trepidation - all the top comments from what I could see, very supportive and positive about the challenges she faced and what she ultimately achieved\n\nin about half way through and think it’s a really good description of life in the 70’s and eighties for aspirational working class women.\n\nI was really annoyed by a review posted on Twitter by Danni Garivelli in the Herald. Expressed exasperation about the description of narcissism applied to Orr’s mother.\n\nI think Deborah was very well aware of the effects of narcissism on her life having had extensive therapy after her marriage ended. To have it dismissed by someone who hadn’t read the book seemingly with much comprehension is difficult for me to accept.\n\nOMG yes, that last line! Nail on the head.\n\nYoung woke women tell old white feminists they are out of touch. They have no idea what a toxic patriarchal culture we grew up in just a few decades ago, or how fragile the gains we have made really are.\n\nI'm 49, I spent a childhood with Benny Hill and TOTP featuring Hot Gossip as well as Jimmy Saville. I grew up with the men fully dressed or in suits, while the women were the scantily clad window dressing. The butt of jokes and sexual innuendo. Sexual assault even.\n\nWe fought against this - I also always knew it was wrong before I could even articulate it, so how come a couple of generations later, the young woke women just don't seem to get it?\n\nI’m 47 and grew up in a working class Scottish background and it chimes so strongly for me.\n\nPeople guffawing at Carry on Films - a bunch of old men perving over teenage school girls. Brucie commanding women to “give him a twirl”. Miss World. Sexy women on cans of lager. On and on. It felt wrong but I couldn’t explain why\n\nMixed in with with a dying industry in a working class town with a bizarre need for conformity. Don’t get above your station.\n\nI read the Guardian extract and I'm just horrified by the sexual assaults Deborah ensured and survived. She writes so clearly and in such matter-of-fact way, I found it heartbreaking. And infuriating, because I think the hatred levelled at women is still so evident in life now.\n\nLooking forward to the R4 broadcast.\n\nI concur with PP who said the end of that paragraph nails it. I’m in my late 40s. It felt like things got better in the 90s and the noughties were OK too, but I’m increasingly wondering if it only looked better from where I was standing. Once I was pregnant for the first time in 2004/5 I started to have development opportunities blocked overtly at work because I was pregnant and came across really regressive attitudes, eg DH’s boss asking me if I’d be giving up my (highly paid professional) job.\n\nBoatyard\n\nI’m increasingly wondering if it only looked better from where I was standing\n\nIt does look better when we're young then we start finding out there are limitations and pitfalls waiting for us around the corner.\n\nWe don't see it coming.\n\nWomen especially, don't see it coming.\n\nThe rules appear to shift for every generation, this particularly affects older women. At this point women often retreat from a positive, dynamic life.\n\nNot all women of course.\n\nMen are affected too but in many ways their star keeps ascending through to old age, not all men obviously.\n\nThe generational differences seems to create a gulf between mothers and their daughters and nobody cares.\n\nIt is sad so many women have such a bitter relationship with their mothers.\n\nDeborah Orr admitted her grief of her mothers death was the realisation that she would never get to experience a bond with her mother as a true friend and ally. I look forward to reading more about this.\n\nI’ve finished it now. I’m really struck by a sense of how little enjoyment she displays about her achievements. Her friends portray her as a really strong personality who loved beautiful things and was great company. But reading the book I got a sense of the huge struggle and the high price she paid for ‘wanting’, rather than any feeling of triumph over adversity.\n\nI wonder how much writing it while suffering illness and post-divorce trauma had on her view of her self.\n\nThey have no idea what a toxic patriarchal culture we grew up in just a few decades ago, or how fragile the gains we have made really are.\n\nOh yup. So true. Possibly an episode of Benny Hill with a side order of dolly-birds draped on cars somewhere during the 70s/80s should be compulsory viewing for all teenaged girls. I have tried to tell mine what it was like.\n\nI think I need to read this book and then pass it round my daughters.\n\nI'm 2/3s of the way through......and it is everything you look for in a biography: honest, reflective, engaging, and with humour. Likewise the recent 'another Planet' a memoir by Tracey Thorne on growing up in deepest suburbia. In contrast Debbie Harry's recent biography 'Face it' was the most boring biography ever. Just a cobbled together time line of events - with little reflection or analysis......very disappointing."
