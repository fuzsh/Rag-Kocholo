        "text": "13. MARY SHELLEY’S FRANKINSTEIN (1994)\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWriter: Steph Lady\n\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Kenneth Branagh, Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Hulce, Aiden Quinn, Ian Holm, John Cleese\n\nBranagh plays Victor Frankenstein, a scientist obsessed with conquering death and who reanimates a corpse who is rejected by all of humanity and swears revenge on the entire world as a result. De Niro also portrays Professor Waldman’s killer, whose body was used for the creature. The reception to this new Frankenstein monster was not kind. Janet Maslin declared in her review that Branagh was over his head, adding that he displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring version of this story. It was Oscar-nominated for Best Makeup.\n\n12. SLEUTH (2007)\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWriter: Harold Pinter\n\nStarring Jude Law and Michael Caine\n\nCaine had starred as hairdresser Milo Tindle opposite Laurence Olivier’s novelist Andrew Wyke in 1972. Caine this time played Wyke opposite Law in this two-hander. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote a review that was headlined, “A Dance of Two Men, Twisting and Turning With a Gun That’s More Than a Gun.” The critic found the film claustrophobic, while declaring that “Mr. Branagh fiddles with the lights, tilts the camera and hustles his hard-working actors upstairs and down and back again and into an elevator as small as a coffin built for one.”\n\n10. HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS (2002)\n\nDirector: Chris Columbus\n\nWriter: Steve Kloves\n\nStarring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Kenneth Branagh, John Cleese, Warwick Davis, Alan Rickman\n\nBranagh plays Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a celebrity author who has written many books about encountering dark creatures and a star in the wizarding world. He is the new Defence Against Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Hugh Grant was the first choice to play the role, but conflicts interfered. Lockhart is unpopular with most of the staff, particularly Snape. Harry dislikes Lockhart’s arrogance and he believes that Harry flew to Hogwarts in Mr. Weasley’s car to seek further attention, his penchant for handing out signed photos of himself and the trouble he has with simple magic such as Harry’s broken arm when he vanishes his arm bones instead. Lockhart is exposed as a charlatan and a coward attempt to avoid entering the Chamber of Secrets by revealing to Harry and Ron he never performed in his books, instead passing off the other witches and wizards as his own and erasing their memories by. Lockhart\n\nattempts to cast a Memory Charm on Harry and Ron and uses Ron broken wand, but the spell backfires and leaves Lockhart with near-total amnesia.\n\n9. A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY (1987)\n\nDirector: Pat O’Connor\n\nWriter: Simon Gray\n\nStarring Colin Firth, Kenneth Branagh, Natasha Richardson, Patrick Malahide\n\nThis was Branagh’s first credited role and Colin Firth’s first lead role. Janet Maslin from The New York Times praised O’Connor’s direction. Others weren’t so kind. Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times found the movie “like a pastoral parable that has been left outside in the damp too long, causing its batteries go flat.” For a while prints of the 35mm prints had disappeared. A higher quality print was found in 2008 in the Academy Film Archive in L.A. and a campaign began to have it restored and released on DVD.\n\n7. HENRY V (1989)\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWriter: Kenneth Branagh\n\nStarring: Kenneth Branagh, Paul Scofield, Derek Jacobi, Ian Holm , Brian Blessed, Emma Thompson, Alec McCowen, Judi Dench, Christian Bale\n\nThis British historical drama based on William Shakespeare’s play of the same name with Branagh playing the title role while making his directorial debut. The film won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design while the film is considered to be one of the best Shakespeare film adaptions ever made. Branagh’s version is more grittier and more realistic than Olivier’s version. For instance, he staged the Battle of Agincourt in a sunlit field. Branagh set the battle rain-drenched mud and gore.\n\n6. DEAD AGAIN (1991)\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWriter: Scott Frank\n\nStarring Kenneth Branagh, Andy Garcia, Derek Jacobi, Hanna Schygulla, Emma Thompson, Robin Williams, Wayne Knight\n\nNewspapers detail the 1948 murder of Margaret Strauss (Thompson), who was stabbed during a robbery with her anklet missing. Her husband composer is found guilty of the crime and condemned to death. Before his execution, Roman is visited by reporter Gray Baker.

Grace sees Mike standing over Margaret with scissors and is convinced he intends to kill her. Mike insists he would never hurt her, but when he accidentally calls her “Margaret,” he agrees to regression, he realizes Margaret and Grace was actually Roman. Mike tries to tell Amanda the truth. Some critics compared this mystery to the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles. But Peter Travers at Rolling Stone viewed the film negatively, especially in the romance department.\n\n5. MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011)\n\nDirector: Simon Curtis\n\nWriter: Adrian Hodges\n\nStarring Michelle Williams, Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dominic Cooper, Julia Ormond, Zoe Wanamaker, Emma Watson, Judi Dench, Dougray Scott\n\nBoth Williams and Branagh bring to life two Hollywood legends – namely Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier – when they paired up to film the 1957 romantic comedy “The Prince and the Showgirl” in Christ Church, Oxford in 1956. Sir Larry brings his wife Vivien Leigh while Monroe brings her husband, playwright Arthur Miller. Marilyn is frustrated because she doesn’t understand her character. Olivier becomes frustrated when Marilyn is late for a read-through. However, actress Sybil Thorndike, played by Dench, stands up for while the rest of the cast is in awe of her. Redmayne plays Colin Clark, a personal assistant on the film which was directed by Olivier who gets cozy with Monroe. Williams was nominated for Best Actress and Branagh earned a nod for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n4.

Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threating letters.

HAMLET (1996)\n\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\n\nWriter: Kenneth Branagh\n\nStarring Kenneth Branagh, Julie Christie, Billy Crystal, Gerard Depardieu, Charlton Heston, Derek Jacobi, Jack Lemmon, Rufus Sewell, Robin Williams, Judi Dench, Richard Attenborough, John Gielgud, Ken Dodd\n\nThe film was the first unabridged theatrical film version of Hamlet, running over four hours. The setting is updated to the 19th century but its Elizabethan English text remains the same. Branagh, of course, played the prince. Alas, it was not a box office hit, mostly due to its limited release, grossing $5 million on a budget of $18 million. The film received four Oscar nominations — Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Original Score and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n1. DUNKIRK (2017)\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nWriter: Christopher Nolan\n\nStarring Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Aeurin Barnard, James Darcy, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh\n\nNolan depicts the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II. Branagh’s role in the film is a composite character as called naval Commander Bolton and the highest-ranking officer on the beach. The action on screen is broken into three parts. When the beach scenes were shot, the weather was worse than during the real evacuation. The film earned eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Director – Nolan’s first-ever nod in that category – while the rousing military story went on to win Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing."
