        "text": "Posted in Kenneth Branagh\n\nAs You Like It is a 2006 romance film written and directed by Kenneth Branagh, based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name. The film stars Romola Garai, Bryce Dallas Howard, Kevin Kline, Adrian Lester, Janet McTeer, Alfred Molina, David Oyelowo and Brian Blessed in a dual role.\n\nTransferring the play's setting to a late 19th-century European colony in Japan after the Meiji Restoration, filming took place at Shepperton Film Studios and at the never-before-filmed gardens of Wakehurst Place. Produced by The Shakespeare Film Company and financed by HBO Films and BBC Films, it is the fifth and to date, the most recent Shakespeare adaptation by Branagh, and the only one not to feature Branagh himself in the cast, though he has a vocal cameo towards the end of the film.\n\nAs a result of its poor commercial performance, Miramax shelved its three-picture deal with Branagh, who subsequently returned to Shakespeare with As You Like It in 2006.\n\nThis recording is for educational purposes only and is covered under Fair Use doctrine - Copyright - All rights reserved to their respective owners.\n\nRead the unabridged plays online: [ LINK ]\n\nSupport Us - Donate Now !\n\nEnter Amount:\n\nÂ£\n\nWhy Donate?\n\nDonations to Shakespeare Network help sustain free knowledge and educational programs on Shakespeare Network and our ecosystem of Shakespeare Network projects.
