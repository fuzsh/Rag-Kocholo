        "text": "I.\n\nQuestions 1-25: Giselle’s sources and context.\n\nThe ballet Giselle has retained its fascination for amost a hundred and eighty years. Is this, however, because it’s been changed and changed again?\n\nSome of this ballet’s most famous features were added in the second half of the nineteenth century, others in the second half of the twentieth. It was never sacrosanct. Within two or three years of its world premiere, it was presented in three-act and four-act versions.\n\nWhat’s left of the 1841 Giselle? What kind of authenticity or rightness should we ascribe to the passages we’ve loved in recent performances? It’s worth investigating this ballet’s histories. My own experience of Giselle, amassed from observing performances by many companies, goes back to 1975. This doesn’t make me an expert - but it does help me to know many of the questions to ask about it.\n\nI’m not alone in asking these questions. 2011 and 2019 brought us the most historically informed two productions of Giselle for many decades: the Pacific Northwest staging of 2011 (Peter Boal, working with Marian Smith and Doug Fullington) and the Bolshoi one of 2019 (the work of Alexei Ratmansky). 2022 is bringing us a third: Ratmansky’s new production for the United Ukrainian Ballet. After the premiere of the Pacific Northwest Ballet production, I began to put questions to Fullington and Smith, the two historians involved in that staging. In July 2016, I convened a three-day seminar on Giselle at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Doug Fullington and Marian Smith were leading contributors. A film of the seminar was made for the Library, where it may be seen. Since then, I have also put these and other questions to the ballerina/director Maina Gielgud and to the scholar Jane Pritchard. In 2019, I was asked by the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow to interview Alexei Ratmansky before his new production for that company; I have introduced material from the interview, and related correspondence, into this questionnaire. After our first publishing this here in October 2020, I have placed new questions to our team, who have made time to write answers, which are to be found in this revised version (October 2021). In August 2022, I interviewed Ratmansky about his new production for the United Ukrainian Ballet; I have incorporated his answers here.\n\nAll these scholars have contributed answers when time has allowed. We publish it in its current incomplete condition, on the understanding that there is always more to say and to discover.\n\nAlastair Macaulay (AM) is a critic and historian; he was chief dance critic of the New York Times in 2007-2018.\n\nDoug Fullington (DF) and Marian Smith (MS) are the scholars who assisted Peter Boal in his 2011 production of Giselle for Pacific Northwest Ballet.\n\nMaina Gielgud (MG) danced Giselle and Myrthe in several productions before directing the ballet for the Boston Ballet and Australian Ballet.\n\nCynthia Harvey (CH) danced Giselle with both American Ballet Theatre and the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in the late twentieth century. In 2021, she presented for American Ballet Theatre’s JKO School a weekend seminar on “Giselle”.\n\nJane Pritchard (JP), a British dance historian, was archivist to English National (London Festival) Ballet, now working at the Theatre department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\n\nAlexei Ratmansky (AR), former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet and longterm artistic associate of American Ballet Theatre, staged new productions of Giselle for the Bolshoi in 2019 and for the United Ukrainian Ballet in 2022.\n\nNotes: All Titus and Justamant translations are by Marian Smith. Translations from the Stepanov are by Anastasia Shmytova and Kaleriya Maslyak with Doug Fullington.\n\nGiselle nomenclature: The makers of the ballet wrote of Giselle, Albert, Myrtha, Wilfride. We’ve tried to keep to those names here. Note that the name “Albert” is pronounced differently in French than in English. (We retain “Albrecht” when quoting sources using that name and referring to specific productions where the name is used.)\n\nThe régisseur/notator known sometimes as “Nikolai Sergeev” or “Nicholas Sergueyeff” is named here as “Nicholas Sergueyev”.\n\n1-25. Giselle and its sources.\n\nAM: I know a little about some of the nineteenth-century material - but here I’m asking questions principally because I’m steeped in the subsequent performance history of Giselle. Others will certainly have seen more productions, casts, and performances than I, but I’ve seen at least sixteen productions over more than forty years, and many dozens of casts. So I certainly have questions.\n\nLet me introduce you all.\n\nDoug Fullington and Marian Smith: you two have spent years absorbing yourself in the nineteenth-century evidence for Giselle and many other ballets. Under Peter Boal’s supervision, you’ve worked on the 2011 Pacific Northwest production and its 2014 revival. Were it not for the Covid-19 lockdown, I would have joined you in April 2020 for a Giselle conference in Seattle and for the next revival of that production.\n\nMaina, your knowledge of the performance history of Giselle goes back much further than my own – it goes back to your having mixed as a child in Tamara Karsavina’s and Anton Dolin’s circles in London in the 1950s. You later worked on Giselle with Dolin, with Rosella Hightower, and with Mary Skeaping in subsequent decades. You’ve danced both Giselle and Myrthe; you’ve staged the ballet; you’ve coached individual Giselles and Alberts (Albrechts).\n\nAlexei, you were preparing a new/old Giselle for the Bolshoi when I interviewed you for the Bolshoi program: I use here the answers you gave me then. You’ve also danced Albert. Your Bolshoi production had its premiere in November 2019, your United Ukrainian one in August 2022. In 2021 and 2022, you’ve gone on addressing my Giselle questions.\n\nJane, you’ve been an archivist and historian for many institutions, with nineteenth-century ballet and the Diaghilev company among your specialties. And your experience of watching ballet in several countries goes back further than my own.\n\n1.\n\nAM: The central dualism of Giselle is that the heroine is alive in Act One, a ghost in Act Two. Was this without precedent in ballet? There are plays, not least by Shakespeare, where we see characters in life and then as ghosts; and Giselle was made in Paris in an era when the French had newly discovered Shakespeare.\n\nIn other ways, Giselle is modeled on La Sylphide: the real world in Act One, the forest where spirits dance naturally in Act Two. In La Sylphide, however, nobody dies halfway through. I can also see that Giselle is a dance sequel to the opera Lucia di Lammermoor (1835), which ends not with the heroine’s Mad Scene but with the great scene for the hero (Edgardo, her lover) amid the tombs of his ancestors: when Edgardo learns of Lucia’s death, he invokes her spirit, says he means to join her, and commits suicide in order to do so. Donizetti, the composer of Lucia, had arranged a French version, Lucie de Lammermoor, in 1839. He and the younger composer Adolphe Adam became friends; Adam’s subsequent music, including aspects of Giselle, shows signs of Donizettian influence.\n\nBut was Giselle new in the way it divided the heroine between the living (Act One) and the dead (Act Two)?\n\nMS: One of the most striking precedents, aside from La Sylphide, was, of course, Robert le diable (1831), which electrified (and offended) audiences with its dead nuns who came back to life, wearing white tutus. As for dividing the heroine between the living (Act One) and the dead (Act Two) – yes, Giselle is the first work I know that does this. But bear in mind that there were more mortals in Act Two than there are now. There are gamekeepers, village men, and at the end, a bunch of people from the court.\n\nAM: My point is that Giselle seems to be the first heroine who returns after death. Later ballets – notably La Bayadère – build on this.\n\nMS: I do think that the generic switch — from a comique piece in Act One to a poignant melodrama in Act Two— is quite ingenious, and helps account for the work's initial and ongoing popularity.\n\nThere are two scenes, now “lost”, in Act Two in which mortal characters find themselves in the Wilis' territory and become frightened. The first is the opening scene of Two, which opens with a jolly gathering of gamekeepers setting up camp at night in the woods. (They are drinking out of the wineskins they have slung over their shoulders, and the music tells us that the mood is light.) Hilarion, the boss, comes to join them and immediately sees that they are in a dangerous place. He warns them. The mood turns somber when Hilarion happens across Giselle's gravestone. The gamekeepers respectfully remove their caps. The clock strikes midnight, and the gamekeepers, now nervous, count the chimes on their fingers. When the will-o'-the-wisps appear soon thereafter, the frightened men move in a clump from one side of the stage to another, trying to avoid them. (This brought some laughs from the audience in Seattle.) It is a fun scary-ghost-story sort of scene; it gives you a delicious chill, and shows that you, in the audience, have entered into a strange new place.\n\nIt is true that sometimes, today, bits of the music for this scene are used, with bits of action - but without the jolly element of setting up camp in the woods and drinking, or the funny bit about the men counting the chimes on their fingers, or Hilarion warning the men away, or the men removing their caps when they see Giselle's grave.\n\nThe second of the lost scenes takes place after the Wili Giselle has made her first appearance and executed those frightening, furious turns. It’s nice to have a bit of levity here, and in this scene we find a group of village men returning from a festival in a neighboring village. To the sound of a harp (“a bizarre music\"”, as the libretto puts it), first one Wili and then another, and another, appear and “fascinate” the men “with their voluptuous poses.” “The young men are intrigued by these attractive young females, but the old man in the group is wiser. He warns the young ones away, and they manage to escape with their lives.” The music for this scene is in the score, and was recorded by Richard Bonynge, but I had never seen it performed until we incorporated it into the PNB production.\n\nBoth of these scenes show an encounter of mortal men with malign supernaturals. Seeing the direct engagement of the two types fairly early in the acts helps us ease us into the Wilis' world. Also, it makes for a good ghost story.\n\nBoth of these scenes have humor in them, too, which affords comic relief. The scene of the gamekeepers, coming at the beginning of the second act, is the first scene we've seen since the shocking and dismaying closing tableau of Act One, in which Giselle lies dead. And then, the scene of the villagers comes a few scenes later, immediately after Giselle has risen from her grave and been greeted by Myrtha—something that's not funny at all. So the comedy provided by the villagers is welcome.\n\nThese two scenes keep the second act from being unrelentingly lugubrious. And really, the impact of the sad and poignant scenes of Act Two is actually strengthened by the inclusion of some levity in the mix. Keeping humor out of the second act makes maintaining its interest more difficult.\n\nAM: The first gamekeepers’ scene is certainly one I’ve seen: it’s in the Mary Skeaping production (London Festival Ballet/ English National Ballet), which I watched from 1977 onward and have seen again in this century.\n\nTwo operatic precursors of this meeting of mortals with the supernatural occurred in Mozart’s Don Giovanni (1787) and Weber’s Der Freischütz (1821). Don Giovanni, that great classic of music theatre, joined the Paris Opera repertory in 1835, in French translation as Don Juan, replete with ballet. My hero Adolphe Nourrit – the creator of the title role in the original Robert le Diable and the author of the scenario for La Sylphide - was Don Juan. A central plot element is the return of the Commendatore after death to take Don Juan/Giovanni to hell. In Freischütz, the Wolf’s Glen scene became a classic example of Romantic drama, with mortal man meeting the otherworldly at its most gruesome and terrifying.Berlioz helped to adapt Freischütz for the Paris Opera in 1841, the year of Giselle.\n\nBoth those operas also have strong elements of comedy. Every scene for the Commendatore in Giovanni also features Leporello, the Sancho-Panza-like servant whose funny ordinariness offsets the heroic drama of retribution elsewhere onstage.\n\n2.\n\nAM: The idea of Giselle began with Théophile Gautier – poet, novelist, critic, leading light of the French Romantic movement, and founding figure of the Parnassian movement in poetry. In a famous introduction to his novel Mademoiselle de Maupin, he argued for “l’art pour l’art” – art for art’s sake – an argument for art possibly subverting morality that may anticipate Oscar Wilde and the aesthetic movement.\n\nHeinrich (Henri) Heine had spent much time in Paris; Gautier and he were friends. Gautier wrote to him about how the idea of the ballet occurred to him one night on reading Heine’s account of the legend of the wilis in his, Heine’s, De l’Allemagne. As the process went on, he handed over Act One to Jules Vernoy de Saint-Georges, an experienced ballet librettist. He specified that Giselle had to die at the end of Act One - he seemed indifferent to the cause of death - and he established the characters of Hilarion and Albert (Albrecht).\n\nActually, Gautier writes about Giselle more than once over the months and years. Am I right that there are discrepancies between his accounts of it?\n\nDF: Marian can reply to this better than I can, but my current impression is that Gautier’s writings were sometimes at odds with what the performance sources tell us (about Hilarion, for example). And yet his writings seem to have informed a lot of subsequent ideas around Giselle: for example, that Giselle stabs herself with the sword during the mad scene, and that Albert’s name should be Albrecht, neither of which were part of the ballet’s conception. I suppose this is simply due to the fact that his writings were available and the performance documents were not. But now that they are, I think some reassessment is in order.\n\nMS. Yes! I comment on Gautier’s variant tellings of Giselle’s manner of death below. Gautier’s writings are so beguiling and gratifying to read, and more widely available than the original source materials, so we’ve relied on them.\n\n3.\n\nAM: As I go over “Giselle”, I’m newly struck by its structural fluency/coherence, particularly the fluency of Adolphe Adam’s score. Apart from the peasant pas de deux, there are only three isolated variations, two of which - both for Giselle - were added in the late nineteenth century. (And the Act Two one is brilliantly worked into the ballet’s musical memory bank.)\n\nIn fact, I’m now almost surprised by the way Albert’s Act Two variation is isolated. Was it always that way from 1841 on? Does Titus or Justamant or Stepanov suggest ways in which the wilis were active during its course?\n\nOtherwise it’s remarkable, when I think of the operas I know from the 1830s and 1840s, that “Giselle” really is moving into a proto-Wagnerian avoidance of separate numbers. But maybe I’m wrong? Maybe some Bournonville ballets have this structural connectedness too. Your thoughts? We’re some of the lost French ballets of the 1830s more connected than the later Petipa idiom?\n\nDF. We’ve found that Giselle’s action and dance was very integrated according to the early performance records we’ve studied (Titus and Justamant). Many sections of the balle qualify as pas d’action, with mime and dance far less separated than we see in Petipa’s surviving ballets. Even within more formal multi-movement dance suites, such as Giselle and Albert’s Act One pas de deux (which included four sections, including a variation for Giselle), the Peasant pas de deux, and G & A’s Act Two pas de deux, solo and duo passages are more fluidly combined.\n\nAs far as I know, we haven’t found any evidence of other stage activity during Albert’s Act Two variation. It is part of the larger multi-movement pas de deux that he dances with Giselle, of course, and follows a lengthy solo passage for Giselle in the previous Andantino that comes after the adagio. To me, and I think Marian may agree, it makes dramatic sense for him to dance this solo at this point in the narrative when Myrtha is forcing him to dance to exhaustion so they can drown him as they did Hilarion.\n\nOther danced passages that aren’t formally designated as variations in Giselle qualify as such because of their length, including Myrtha’s solos at the beginning of Act Two and during the Wilis’ dances and Giselle’s Andantino solo.\n\nWe have identified a number of passages of music that seemed to have been intended for Giselle to dance that were cut from Adam’s autograph score. Grisi was coming back from an injury before the premiere, and we surmise that dance passage may have been shortened and, in some cases, cut in order to accommodate her.\n\nMS. I would like to add a note about continuity in \"Giselle\", though it does not concern the dance numbers. Is is the thoughtful way that one scene is made to elide into the next. Here is but one example (I am sending video via WeTransfer to show it): After Berthe's big mime scene, Giselle wants to leave with Albert, but Berthe insists that her daughter return to their house. The sound of hunting horns is heard in the distance, making Loys nervous. He shoos the village girls off to upstage right (away from the hunting party), and Giselle reluctantly goes back into the house with her mother. Quite often, this stage is empty while the music plays; the action is eliminated. But this action is important: it deepens the characterizations a bit (village girls are excited about the hunting horns; Berthe is very determined to get the reluctant Giselle back in the house) and helps build tension about the conflict Albert has set up.\n\n(There are many other instances of an empty stage or missing characters in scenes for which Adam explicitly wrote in voices and action!)\n\n4.\n\nAM: Gautier conceived the ballet for the young ballerina Carlotta Grisi, who was the partner of the young ballet master and dancer Jules Perrot. Later, Grisi became his, Gautier’s, sister-in-law. She grew up in the era of the classic sylph, Marie Taglioni, but also that of the great actress ballerina, Fanny Elssler – Gautier’s responses to both ballerinas in the late 1830s are famous - and she, Grisi, combined some of their virtues. She also came from an operatic family and had enough singing skill to perform some arias early in her career. As Marian has written in Ballet and Opera in the Era of “Giselle”, there were many overlaps between opera and ballet in that era, but Grisi may have been more equipped than most for a work that has some operatic qualities.\n\nDecades ago, I read a brilliant Ph.D. thesis by the Canadian-British scholar John Chapman on Romanticism in the Romantic Ballet. He observed that Grisi was praised by French critics for seeming to dance for dance’s sake – la danse pour la danse. This immediately connected for me with Gautier’s credo of l’art pour l’art, art for art’s sake. Whether or not she was the technician and stylist that Taglioni was, or the actress that Elssler was, this quality of being motivated by dance itself seems very close to the heart of Giselle and - another role she created for Perrot - Esmeralda. And perhaps it made her close to Gautier’s larger aesthetics as well as to his personal tastes in stage divinities.\n\nAny comments here, scholars? I’ll just point out that Grisi’s roles of Giselle and Esmeralda are the presursors of Nikiya in La Bayadère: dancers for whom the love of dance is part of the story. But dance as the subject of drama was already in the air. We’ll return to this.\n\n5.\n\nAM: The wilis are nocturnal spirits who rise after the midnight hour to dance men to death. Gautier had imagined Giselle rising from the grave as a wili, albeit a conflicted wili. Next, Saint-Georges added to Act One the idea that Giselle in life was already mad about dancing. This suited Grisi, who was noted for her quality of dancing for dancing’s sake.\n\nSaint-Georges didn’t conjure it from thin air, however. Have you ever read about the dance plague of the Rhineland in the late medieval era? There’s a good book by John Waller, The Dancing Plague (2009 - printed in the UK as A Time to Dance, a Time to Die). He particularly writes of the fatal dance-mania of Strasbourg of 1518. But he’s aware that there had been earlier instances, chiefly in the Rhineland. Lincoln Kirstein, in his exceptional Dance, a short history (1934), is an earlier historian who records some of these reports of fatal, collective, dance-mania: his examples go back at least as early as 1013. He discusses these outbreaks as part of the medieval concept of the Dance of Death.\n\nDF: So fascinating about the dancing plague!\n\nAlthough Giselle may have been envisioned in the Middle Ages (the original libretto does not give an indication), the original costuming is a mix of contemporary, i.e., 1840s current style of dress (for Giselle herself and the female peasants) and an idealized, and also fashionably current, mediaeval look for the men. This is evident in the costume drawings for 1841 and subsequent Paris productions, and also the 1845 engravings in Les Beautés de l'Opéra.\n\nJérôme Kaplan, designing our Pacific Northwest production, solved this stylistic incongruity by removing the then-in-fashion idealized mediaeval looks and by costuming the entire ballet in the same period—the period in which Giselle herself is costumed.\n\nMS: Giselle’s love for dancing was inspired by a character in Hugo’s poem – see below.\n\nAM: Alexei, can you say what period Giselle is set in?\n\nAR: I’m not sure - and I don’t know how much it matters. My designer, Robert Pereziola, and I have based our Bolshoi designs on those of Alexandre Benois; and I think Benois had done his research. It just looks very pretty and very right for the choreography and the story.\n\nAM: Well, I think it matters somewhat when Giselle is set - but then I’ve seen one production set in the early twentieth-century Jazz Age, with some characters arriving onstage by car.\n\n6.\n\nAM: Giselle was conceived in the era of the ballet d’action, the narrative ballet. So how do you find dramatic justification for dancing itself in a story ballet? - especially in the era in which expressive mime carried much of the story? Well, dance-mania is one answer: characters dance because they’re wild about dancing itself.\n\nThere are two pre-Giselle ballets where dance-mania is a theme: Vincenzo Galeotti’s The Whims of Cupid and the Dancing Master (1786), which the Royal Danes kept in repertory in Copenhagen until the early 1980s, and Pierre Gardel’s La Dansomanie (1800), which the Paris Opera revived (presumably without the original choreography) c.1979. Both were comedies, with people dancing helplessly, unable to resist dance-craziness. (The comedy of people dancing against their will is something Bournonville used later, in the 1851 The Kermesse in Bruges.)\n\nSo dance-enthusiasm was in the ballet air at the time of Giselle. The obligation to dance, no matter the consequences, recurs in Esmeralda and La Bayadère, in each of which the female protagonist is a professional dancer. Did anybody, in any of the period sources you've investigated, remark on the parallels between Giselle and other dance-mania stories?\n\nMS: All the dancing characters in ballets at the Paris Opéra in those days danced for a reason. Village festivals, balls, entertainment for the Pasha, celebrations of harvests, weddings—you name it, there was a reason for the dancing. So it makes sense that Gautier created a character, Giselle, who loved to dance and did it every chance she got. Same thing for the Wilis. They're not just regular ghosts—they're ghosts whose nature drives them to the dance.\n\nI don't know of any dansomania-themed ballets during the Giselle period, but the theme of involuntary dancing comes up every so often in other ballets; it's one of many devices that ballet story-writers (ballet librettists) used to introduce dancing into the action. For instance, Native Americans couldn't help but dance when they heard the sound of the dancing master's violin in Les Mohicans, a short-lived ballet of 1837. In La Tarentule (1839), one of the main characters is bitten by a spider: the toxin makes him dance. In Lady Henriette (1844), the deranged residents of Bedlam dance at recreation time, each one acting out the \"eccentricity\" of his or her own monomania. And so on.\n\n(Never mind the Gardel/Méhul Dansomanie of 1800, which I wish I could see!)\n\nDF: And in the Ivanov-Drigo 1893 Magic Flute, the country boy Luc plays a flute which forces those hearing it to dance.\n\nAM: In one respect, Esmeralda and La Bayadère have one extra turn of the screw beyond the Giselle we know: their heroines each have to dance when their hearts are breaking, and yet their sheer love of dance helps to carry them through.\n\nI suspect that it was to create similar effects that Giselle was expanded, in Italy, into a four-act ballet in 1843 for Fanny Cerrito and a three-act one for Fanny Elssler. In those productions, Bathilde invited her new village friends, Giselle included, to the castle for the celebrations for her wedding. In the act set in the castle – where Elssler apparently reached her peak - Giselle covered quite a range: she danced at the festivities for Bathilde, she discovered Albert’s true identity and perfidy, she went mad and died. I wish we knew more of these early productions. My sources are Ivor Guest’s biographies of Fanny Cerrito and Fanny Elssler. See 7 below!\n\n7.\n\nAM: Did anyone in the nineteenth century spot parallels between Giselle and Faust? The hero of the latter, caught between the devil and heaven, is a deceiver who toys with the affections of a simple girl. The pure and simple girl has another admirer, who doesn’t stand a chance. I especially feel the Faust connection in American Ballet Theatre's production of Giselle, where Hilarion leaves a nosegay on the heroine’s doorstep, which she never notices – something also done in Gounod's 1859 Faust opera by Marguérite’s other admirer Siébel. Gretchen/Marguerite, treated by Faust worse than Giselle is by Albert, goes mad; yet she then saves Faust’s soul by praying for him.\n\nGoethe’s Faust (1790-1832) considerably pre-dates Giselle. By the time of Giselle’s creation, Faust was beginning to be adapted into classical music and popular drama. Ivor Guest’s biography, Jules Perrot, tells us (pp.208-9) that Perrot had danced in 1833 in Deshayes’s Faust in London. (Perrot may have also heard of Bournonville’s Copenhagen Faust (1832) and Salvatore Taglioni’s Naples one (1838). Carlo Blasis had planned one for 1835, but it had never been realized.) Before all these, the Porte Saint-Martin theatre in the 1810s had presented a spoken-theatre Faust in which the great Frédérick Lemaître had made a sensation as Méphistophéles. Guest writes that Perrot would have seen that production in his teens and would have based his 1848 ballet Faust on it, which he first created at La Scala for Fanny Elssler.\n\nMS: It's clear that there are parallels, as you point out. So many artists in the nineteenth century were deeply inspired by the Faust story, and Adolphe Adam had even composed a score for a Faust ballet in London in 1833.\n\nThe daisy-petal scene in Faust may have led to the light-hearted one in Giselle. (And I do believe it is a light-hearted scene for the characters in the first act, without portentous overtones. Its deeper meaning should not reveal itself until the second act.)\n\nHere are the lines from Goethe's Faust: “Faust: What do you murmur? /Margaret: . . . Loves me —not—loves me— not (tearing out the last leaf in utter joy:) /He loves me! / Faust: Yes, my child. Let this sweet flower's word/ Be as God's word to you. He loves you.”\n\nI don't know of any specific references to Faust in the nineteenth-century Giselle commentary, though I assume the likenesses between the two works were obvious to many theater-goers. It was typical to have cross-references in those days (just as we do today in film and TV and on Broadway). These sorts of allusions -- to plots, characters, scene types -- can be hard for us to notice because so much of the literature and other theater hits of that period in Paris are unknown to us today. But it was a rich environment in which audiences thrived this sort of thing.\n\nAM: Adolphe Adam not only composed a three-act ballet of Faust for London in 1833, he then (I’ve just discovered) re-used some of its music in the 1841 Giselle. Its choreographer in 1833 was André-Jean-Jacques Deshayes (1777-1846) – who, in 1842, co-choreographed the 1842 London premiere of Gisellewith Jules Perrot.\n\n8.\n\nAM: As we’ve already begun to show,Giselle is a ballet that has been serially revised – more than perhaps any of us realized until we were well into research. Within the first two or three years after the premiere, Giselle was being given in revised productions around Europe: these included both three-act and four-act versions. In a number of productions between 1844 and 1945, Albert died at the end of the ballet.\n\nSo let’s look at this very incomplete performance history I’ve assembled of the ballet. Doug and Marian have provided supplementary information, as you’ll see.\n\nGiselle – an incomplete list of highlights of its performance history by Alastair Macaulay.\n\n1833\n\nAdolphe Adam (1803-1856) composes a three-act ballet of Faust for the King’s Theatre, London; the scenario and choreography are by André-Jean-Jacques Deshayes. Adam later recycles some of the music in the 1841 Giselle.\n\n1835\n\nHeinrich Heine (1797-1856), resident in Paris since 1830, publishes Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland (On the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany), translated into French as De l’Allemagne the same year.\n\n1837\n\nThe ballet La Fille de l’air, produced at the Folie-Dramatique, Paris, features a dance scene in which wilis are summoned from their tombs and surround the hero, to music from Meyerbeer’s opera Les Huguenots (1836). The hero “falls to the ground exhausted, and in on the point of expiring when the spirit of the air calls upon the wilis to desist. As they advance upon their intended victim, she protects him with one arm while commanding them to disperse with the other. She overcomes their power with an imperious look, and one by one they return to their tombs.” (Ivor Guest, Jules Perrot, p.65.\n\n1841, April or later\n\nOn February 12, Carlotta Grisi (1819-1899) made her debut at the Paris Opéra, partnered by Lucien Petipa (1815-1898). She has been hitherto the partner and protégée of Jules Perrot (1810-1892), who - though not re-engaged as a dancer at the Opéra, where he had performed to great effect in the early 1830s – arranges all her dances. Soon there is a search for a new vehicle to showcase her. Adolphe Adam is approached by Léon Pillet (1803-1868), director of the Opéra since 1840, to consider composing La Rosière de Gand for this purpose. (Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris, pp.203-4.)\n\nAt this point, however, the poet and critic Théophile Gautier (1811-1872) takes up the tale of the wilis from Heine’s De l’Allemagne, adapting it as “Les Wilis, a ballet”, then passing the idea to the professional librettist and playwright Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-George (1799-1875), who after three days produced the two-act scenario, Giselle, or Les Wilis, a ballet”. Always intending this for Grisi, the men show it to Adolphe Adam, who, sharing their enthusiasm, persuades Pillet to postpone La Rosière de Gand in favour of Giselle. Adam composes the new score with enthusiasm, re-using some pages from his earlier ballet score for Faust. (See Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris, pp.204-6, 296.)\n\nAugust Bournonville (1805-1829), en route to Naples, spends whole weeks in Paris. He “attended a rehearsal of Giselle, where Théophile Gautier and Balletmaster Coralli shared the idea and the arrangement with the dancer Perrot, whose supposed wife, Carlotta Grisi, performed the title role with a perfection, in choreographic respects, the like of which was not to be found in any other ballerina; but in the area of ‘the poetry of grace’ she was greatly inferior to Marie Taglioni.” (Bournonville, My Theatre Life, p. 533)\n\nLater, Bournonville writes of libretti produced by multiple collaborators: “….as for Giselle, I myself have seen how Perrot taught Carlotta Grisi fragments of the main role of another ballet, while the subject, which was taken from Heine’s Die Wiles, was conceived by Théophile Gautier, arranged and revised by Saint-Georges, and finally mounted or - if one prefers - composed by Balletmaster Coralli.” (My Theatre Life, p. 20)\n\nJune 28, 1841\n\nPremiere, Paris Opéra, on Grisi’s twenty-second birthday. The scenario is by Théophile Gautier and Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-George; the designs are by Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri; the choreography is officially by Jean Coralli (1779-1854), though the ballet’s makers know that Giselle’s dances are by Perrot. Adam’s score was supplemented by a suite by Frédéric Burgmüller, which concluded with a lilting waltz already known under its original title Souvenirs de Ratisbonne. (Ivor Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris, pp. 211.) Carlotta Grisi is Giselle; Lucien Petipa is Albert; Adèle Dumilâtre is Myrthe; Jean Simon is Hilarion. According to the Paris Opéra unwritten rule that opera and ballet were combined in every performance, the Giselle premiere is preceded by the third act of Rossini’s opera Moïse (or Moïse et Pharaon).\n\nIn La France musicale, Escudier calls Adam’s score “ a real tour de force”. In an era where most ballet scores were patchworks of old material, its only recognized borrowings are eight bars from a song by Loïse Puget and three from the Huntsmen’s Chorus in Weber’s Euryanthe. Escudier finds the overture has orchestration in the style of Cherubini. (Luigi Cherubini <1760-1842> had been resident in France since the 1780s. Beethoven regarded him as the greatest of his contemporaries; Rossini, Chopin, and others admired him greatly.) Escudier also writes that an enchanting Act One waltz, “quite in the Germanic spirit of the subject,” may “well achieve the popularity of the best waltzes by Strauss.” (Guest, The Romantic Ballet in Paris, p.213)\n\nDescribing a week in Paris on his return from Naples, Bournonville writes, “I delighted in seeing a couple of performances of Giselle.” (My Theatre Life, p.547)\n\nGautier writes on July 5 (a week after the premiere) a famous letter to “My dear Heinrich Heine” about how “a few weeks ago, my eyes rested in a charming passage… In a burst of enthusiasm, I even took up a large sheet of fine white paper and wrote at the top, in superb rounded characters, ‘Les Wilis, a ballet’.” (Gautier On Dance, translated and edited by Ivor Guest, p.94.)\n\nWikipedia relates that “Giselle made 6500 francs between June and September 1841. This was twice the amount for the same time period in 1839. Grisi's salary was increased to make her the top earner among the dancers at the Opéra. Souvenirs were sold, pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music arrangements were made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her Act II costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called façonné Giselle, and Madame Lainné, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called 'Giselle'. The ballet was parodied at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.”\n\nDF: We all know the dangers of Wikipedia! - but it must be said that some Wikipedia articles on nineteenth-century ballets are useful.\n\nAM: 1842\n\nMarch 12. London, Her Majesty’s Theatre. First London production of Giselle, staged by André-Jean-Jacques Deshayes and Perrot. Grisi dances Giselle, Perrot Albert. (Ivor Guest, Jules Perrot, pp. 81, 83.) Eleven successive performances – nine of the entire ballet, two of the second act alone.\n\nSt Petersburg. Titus stages Giselle, “having been sent to Paris to study the work, which was hailed as a vehicle for Russian ballerinas and a tonic for the post-Taglioni doldrums.” (Wiley, A Century of Russian Ballet, p, 173)\n\nSeptember. At the Paris Opéra, Elisa Bellon dances two performances of Giselle, unusually musical and greatly applauded. (Guest, Perrot, p.88.) At the Opéra, the title role is danced mainly by Grisi throughout the 1840s.\n\n1843\n\nMilan, La Scala. On January 17, Fanny Cerrito (1817-1909) dances a four-act version of Giselle, staged by Antonio Cortesi. Cortesi writes in a preface that he has re-shaped and amplified the plot to “make it more interesting”. The action is transferred from Silesia to Bosnia. The Duke of Courland becomes the Prince of Serbia and is now the hero’s father rather than his prospective father-in-law. Act One features a confrontation between Albert (Albrecht) and Hilarion before the peasants only. Giselle faints, but later assures Hilarion he may marry her if his accusations prove true. She and her mother set forth to see an old hermit as the act ends. In Act Two the hermit tells her that she must prepare for suffering and that God will be merciful to her. In Act Three, Giselle, her mother, Hilarion and (!) the hermit arrive at the castle during a ball. They recognize Albrecht and the extent of his betrayal. The Mad Scene follows. Though the fourth act is along the lines of the traditional Act Two, the Queen of the Wilis, affected by the tears of Giselle, shows compassion for the lovers. Giselle blesses the union of Alberta and Bathilde “and rises to thank the Queen, as a series of groups brings the final curtain down on the customary display of splendor.” The music was not by Adam, but by “Federico Vicci and Verdi”; the printed programme also credits Giovanni Bajetti, concert master of the Scala orchestra. (Ivor Guest, Fanny Cerrito, pp. 50-51.) (I have wondered if the Verdi was Giuseppe Verdi, who was based around Milan at this time. But his breakthrough into great popularity came in March 1842 with Nabucco. It seems unlikely he would help out with Giselle the next year, when he was preparing for his next triumph, I Lombardi, which opened at La Scala in March 1843.)\n\nMS: According to Kathleen Kuzmick Hansell, Adam’s music was used in this production, but altered by the maestro al cembalo Giovanni Bajetti to accommodate omissons and additios in the action. She also points out that Cortesi’s production of Giselle, one of many in Italy, was performed at all the major Italian opera houses but one. Kathleen Kuzmick Hansell, “Theatrical Ballet and Italian Opera,” in Lorenzo Bianconi and Giorgio Pestelli, eds, Opera on Stage, The History of Italian Opera, Systems, vol. 5, part II (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1998)\n\nAM: London, Her Majesty’s Theatre. Perrot, after Deshayes’s death, is now ballet master at Her Majesty’s. On March 30, Fanny Elssler (1810-1884), coached by him (Guest, Perrot, p.94) makes her debut as Giselle, her first new role for three years.\n\nThe Morning Herald writes of her Act II: “Emerging from the shroud of death, she assumes a new species of existence; she seems driven by an irresistible fate to work out the destruction of her lover, and yet is this influence checked by some lingering yearnings of humanity, which prompts her to save him from the fatal snare. The expressions which the actress gives to the scene is distinct and awful. No smile of recognition animates the face of the poor phantom. The features are pale and immovable, wearing an air of plastic resignation, yet sad, inconsolate, and deathlike. She executes the malign bidding of the Wili Queen with involuntary readiness, but the sentiment of earthly love still clings to her, although the outward manifestations of dismay and repugnance are obliterated from her countenance. The spectre maiden unconsciously binds fresh chains around the sympathies of her lover; she lures him to his doom with the bewitching phrases of her dancing, with her fanciful flittings in the pale glimmer of the moon and her erratic flights through the air – but more so by those fascinating evidences of love which she practiced when living, and which even the grace cannot utterly suppress.\n\n“In this silent pantomime Fanny Elssler is most eloquent and pathetic. The opposite characteristics of the forlorn spirit are strongly marked, and the touches of art, which give form, substance, and elevation to the conception, are so manifold that admiration can scarcely find terms in which to vent itself. Such a complete expression of a dramatic sentiment has never before been evolved by the merely imitative means of the ballet. It has been left for Fanny Elssler to show the full eloquence of bodily gesture, and what a forcible significance and intensity may be given to it when genius and feeling are the prime movers.” (Ivor Guest, Fanny Elssler, pp. 198-99.)\n\n1844\n\nFebruary 15. Milan, La Scala. Elssler dances a three-act version of Giselle. The first act is divided into two scenes. Act One ends when the princess discovers that Giselle, like her, is in love. “She invites everyone – Giselle, her mother, Hilarion, even a band of fortune-telling gypsies – to attend her wedding ball at the castle.” Act Two occurs in the castle ballroom. Albrecht, seeing Giselle among the guests, hastily retires. Giselle is among those who dance a divertissement. Bathilde asks her father to find Albrecht. The dénouement of the mad scene is as usual. Act Three is like the traditional Act Two, but Albrecht dies - and in an apotheosis, is seen united with Giselle. (Ivor Guest, Fanny Elssler, pp. 207.)\n\nThe Milanese critics felt Elssler least suited to the third act, but considered the mad scene its highlight. She dances performances until Easter.\n\n1848\n\nOctober 13 (Ivor Guest) or 10 (Roland John Wiley). Elssler makes her Russian debut as Giselle at the Bolshoi, St Petersburg.\n\nDF: Petersburg Ballet. Three Centuries gives 1 October 1848 (O.S.) as Elssler’s debut.\n\nAM: 1850\n\n“Perrot took the whole ballet apart and began again when Grisi… arrived in St Petersburg… He had Petipa beside him, since Petipa was technically the producer; and it was Petipa the producer who made certain modifications to the dance of the Wilis in Act Two.” (Money, Pavlova, p.39)\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, “For Carlotta Grisi's performances as Giselle with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni to score a new pas de cinq for the ballerina that was added to the first tableau. [37] This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg.\n\nOn May 19, Fanny Elssler dances Giselle at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. A triumph. The critic of Vedomosti Moskovskoi Gorodskoi Politsii wrote “To conclude, Elssler is the first dancer to have made the end of Giselle intelligible to me. Albrecht would return to the glade the following night in the hope of finding the spirit of Giselle again. He is not afraid of the evil of the wilis, not of their fatal dances, not of death itself…. But Elssler’s Giselle has already renounced her earthly love in the last scene of this ballet. She has yielded up all earthly things. Her last look is one of prayer, and one has the presentiment that on the following night Giselle will no longer be among the wilis. The force which has chained her to the earth has already been broken.” (Guest, Elssler, p. 240. He notes that the impression of Albrecht’s return the next night could only be achieved if the original ending, showing Bathilde’s appearance to find Albrecht, had been cut.)\n\n1851\n\nIn Moscow, ballet students take their revenge on the ballet master Frédéric when he pays them insufficiently. “The ballet Giselle was being given, and we were taking part. In the second act, when the huntsman, who was being played by Frédéric <the ballet master>, falls into the hands of the shades, they torment, him, balletically of course – that is, they turn him around when he ought to run up a hill. We, the last on the hillock, were to turn him and throw him into the water. So we really began to turn Frédéric! Throwing him down the hill, we kept repeating: ‘There you have your 10-kopeck piece!’” From the Recollections of the Artiste A.P.Natarova, 1903. (Wiley, A Century of Russian Ballet, pp. 150-1)\n\n1854\n\nNadezhda Konstantinova Bogdanova (1836-1897), a Russian ballerina with a Western career, makes her debut as Giselle in Vienna. She has already danced the role in provincial tours of Russia. “One novelty about this must not be overlooked: Miss Bogdanova danced in Vienna among live trees and flowers placed on the stage; in the second act of Giselle the flowers were picked and thrown, and after the performance were quickly passed into her admirers’ hands.” (The Bogdanov Artistic Family, 1856. Wiley, A Century, p.210.)\n\n1856\n\n“A significant event in the history of Russian ballet occurred at the beginning of the same year: N.K.Bogdanova <Nadezhda Konstantinova Bogdanova>, a Russian ballerina, first dancer of the Paris Grand Opéra, made her <Petersburg> debut with great success in the role of Giselle.” (Recollections of T.A.Stukolkin, Artist of the Imperial Theatres, probably written in the 1890s. Roland John Wiley, A Century of Russian Ballet, p.126.)\n\nOn p.185, Wiley gives the date of Bogdanova’s debut as 2 February.\n\n1863\n\nRevival of Giselle at the Paris Opéra by Lucien Petipa for the visiting Russian ballerina Martha Muravieva (1838-1879). “Giselle seemed a very appropriate choice, being in the St. Petersburg repertory, and although it had not been given in Paris for some years, being remembered sufficiently well there to be produced quickly.” Though Muravieva knew the role in Russia, she was coached privately in Paris by Jules Perrot and gained many new points and insights.\n\n“At the close of the pas de deux with Mérante, who played Albert, she produced an exciting effect by changing the tempo, ‘<breaking> measure with a rallentando such as singers use at the end of an aria’. The mad scene at the end of the first act, the danse de folie as it was then called, perhaps being presented with a greater dance content than later became the rule, was very skillfully handled, considering that her dramatic ability was not specially developed.”\n\nJules Janin wrote that in the second act she appeared “a shadow, a mist, like a dream come from from the ivory gates.” (Guest, Perrot, p.327)\n\nMuravieva returned in the role the next year.\n\nIt seems to be at this time that Justamant records the Paris Giselle in his notation/description.\n\nDF: This is difficult to nail down precisely. The Justamant MS doesn’t include interpolated dance numbers that were part of the Paris score at that time, and it includes numbers that appear to have been omitted. The manuscript isn’t dated and a contemporary performance venue isn’t given (unusual for Justamant). The Moscow scholar Sergei Konaev suggests that the notation was made in the late 1850s or early 1860s.\n\nAM: 1867\n\nWikipedia on Giselle states that three solo variations were added to the ballet by Petipa during the latter half of the 19th century:\n\n“The first was arranged in 1867 for the grand pas de deux of the second tableau for the ballerina Adèle Grantzow. The music was composed by Cesare Pugni and was based on Adolphe Adam's ‘he loves me, he loves me not’ leitmotif. This variation has been retained in the ballet ever since.”\n\nThis is Giselle’s final solo, performed at Myrthe’s command and addressed in large part to Albert.\n\nDF: The date of this first additional variation is probably 1866; and the variation may have been added in Moscow or Paris, in both of which Grantzow performed Giselle before dancing it in St. Petersburg. The likely composer is Minkus, who was working closely with Arthur Saint-Léon, the likely choreographer, at the time.\n\nAM: 1868\n\nFinal nineteenth-century performance of Giselle at Paris Opéra. (But it was also announced for the 1869-70 season. Ivor Guest, The Ballet of the Second Empire, p.228. Adèle Grantzow was to have danced it; she fell ill.)\n\n1878\n\nFebruary, St Petersburg Ekaterina Vazem dances Giselle. (Wiley, A Century, pp. 288-9.)\n\n1884\n\nSt Petersburg. Petipa, “his creative energies flagging,” revives Giselle. (Wiley, A Century, p. 323.) He made further modifications, “more distinctively,” to the dance of the Wilis, “while Minkus fiddled about with parts of Adam’s score” (Money, Pavlova, p.39)\n\nDF: I wish Money provided citations. The revival for Maria Gorshenkova with Pavel Gerdt premiered on 5 February 1884 (O.S.).\n\nAM: 1886\n\nThe Wikipedia entry on Giselle writes on the second of the three solo variations added by Petipa to this ballet:-\n\n“The second… was added by Petipa to the first tableau for the ballerina Emma Bessone's début as Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, and on this occasion the composer Riccardo Drigo wrote the music for the variation. The music was never used again after Bessone's departure from Russia until Agrippina Vaganova added it to the Peasant pas de deux for the Kirov Ballet's production of Giselle in 1932. The inclusion of this variation in the Peasant pas de deux remains part of the Mariinsky Theatre's performance tradition of Giselle to the present day.”\n\nDF: Bessone’s St. Petersburg debut in Giselle was on 12 April 1887 (Old Style).\n\nAM: 1887\n\nAnd the Wikipedia Giselle entry says, of the third of the three solo variations added by Petipa to Giselle:\n\n“The third… was also composed by Drigo and has survived as one of the most beloved passages of Giselle.”\n\nEvidently, this is Giselle’s main Act One variation, usually danced with hops on point today.\n\n“This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba. The variation was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtseva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, a misconception which still persists.”\n\nDF: Sergei Konaev and, I believe, Yuri Burlaka both have identified this variation as one added for Cornalba in an 1887 revival of Fiammetta. The music is proably by Riccardo Drigo. Cornalba made her St. Petersburg debut in Giselle on 18 December 1888 (O.S.). Whether the Fiammetta variation was transferred to Giselle at that time or later, it was part of the ballet by 1903 at the latest, when its choreography wasnotated in the Stepanov system as danced by Anna Pavlova.\n\nAM: 1899\n\nSeptember 5, St Petersburg. Henrietta Grimaldi dances Giselle; Olga Preobrazhenskaya (1871-1962) dances Myrthe. Lubov Egorova (1880-1972) and Anna Pavlova (1881-1931) dance Moyna and Zulma. (Keith Money, Anna Pavlova, p.17)\n\nDF: The printed program for 5 September 1899 (O.S.) lists Lubov Petipa in the role of Zulme. Andrew Foster confirms Pavlova’s Zulme debut was 26 September 1899, when she took over the role from Lubov Petipa, who danced Myrtha.\n\nAM: Act Two is recorded in Stepanov notation. This records Albrecht collapsing, fatally, at the end of the ballet, with Wilfred and the huntsmen finding his dead body at dawn.\n\nDecember 29, St Petersburg. Olga Preobrazhenskaya makes her debut as Giselle.\n\nDF: Petersburg Ballet. Three Centuries states Preo debuted on December 28 (O.S.).\n\nAM: 1901\n\nSt Petersburg. Carlotta Zambelli (1875-1968) makes her Russian debut as Giselle. “When finally Zambelli arrived, the critics turned sharp eyes upon her supposedly supreme technique. Those who championed Kschessinskaya against all rivals observed that the star of the Paris Opéra did fouettés en attitude on demi-pointe. By contrast to this dismissive quibbling, Svetlov’s review of Zambelli was almost entirely favorable. The visitor was partnered by Nicolas Legat. Julie Sedova was cast as Myrtha, and Pavlova and Lubov Egorova, were Zulme and Moyna, the soloist Wilis of Act Two.” (Money, Pavlova, p.27)\n\n1903\n\nApril 30. (Money, Pavlova, pp. 42, 38-39) Anna Pavlova makes her debut as Giselle, “a role she knew could not possibly have come her way for years had not Petipa demonstrated his complete faith in her abilities…. Giselle had been in the repertory only sporadically, with long productions between one production and the next, and in every instance the ballet had been reworked considerably for the principal exponent, so that there was no clearly defined shape or tradition. Zambelli had been encouraged to interpolate passages that flattered her own particular strengths, and Pavlova had not interfered with Cecchetti during this process; it was the accepted way of working at the time.”\n\nStepanov notation is made of Act One of this revival.\n\n1910\n\nTamara Karsavina (1885-1978), coached by Evgenia Sokolova, makes her debut as Giselle in Prague on April 24.\n\nIn May-June, in London, at the Coliseum, she then dances Gisella or La Sylphide, with a company otherwise of Moscow dancers. Dances are credited to Petipa; music by Adam. It is mainly the second act of Giselle. She dances this twice nightly, six days a week, for two weeks; 24 performances in all. (Foster, Karsavina, p.98, 107. Money, Pavlova, p. 110.)\n\nThen on June 18, she dances Giselle in the premiere of Diaghilev’s new production at the Paris Opéra. Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950) dances Albert. The production has been attributed to Mikhail Fokine (1880-1942). Designs are by Alexandre Benois (1870-1960).\n\nIn St Petersburg, on October 9 (October 26, OS), Karsavina makes her Maryinsky debut as Giselle, with Samuil Andrianov as Albert.\n\n1911\n\nOne of the four performances danced by Karsavina danced in the Maryinsky’s 1910-1911 season, on February 5, was the notorious one with Nijinsky – his first St Petersburg performance of Albert - which resulted in his dismissal from the theatre’s staff. (He wore the Benois costume in Act I. Its lack of hose, or over-trunks, was deemed offensive to the audience, especially to those in the Imperial Box – or that was the claim made in a scandal that was almost certainly engineered. Nijinsky’s dismissal freed him to sign permanently with Diaghilev’s company: whereupon many others dancers followed suit.)\n\n1911-1914\n\nDiaghilev’s Ballets Russes dances its Benois-designed Giselle in Monte Carlo in 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914; in London, in its second 1911 season there; in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro, in 1913; and in some performances in Germany. Karsavina is usually its Giselle. Nijinsky is Albert until his 1913 dismissal from the Diaghilev company, whereupon Adolf Bolm (1884-1951) inherits the role. (Foster, Karsavina, pp. 98-99.)\n\nFor the July-October 1911 Coronation season in London, the Diaghilev Russian Ballet season at Covent Garden includes Giselle with Karsavina and Pavlova as the two Giselles. Nijinsky was Albrecht. Enrico Cecchetti, with his great gifts as a mime, played Giselle’s mother. (Buckle, Diaghilev, pp. 209, 211)\n\n1924\n\nParis Opéra. Giselle revived in Paris for the first time since 1868, for Olga Spessivtseva (1895-1991).\n\nDF: This production was staged by Nicholas Sergueyev (Nikolai Sergeev) (1876-2951), the former Maryinsky régisseur.\n\nAM: In the same year, Boris Romanov's Ballets Romantiques company performs Giselle in Paris. Giselle is Hélène Smirnova (1888-1934), Albrecht is Anatole Oboukhov (1896-1962), Bathilde - Elsa Kruger. According to André Levinson (La danse d'aujourd'hui – 1929 , pp. 92-98), Romanov (1891-1957) reimagined the work pretty radically, with a corps de ballet of only twelve dancers. And near the end of his account, Levinson writes: “Ainsi s'est révélé, à Paris, le plus grand talent chorégraphique de notre génération.”\n\nLevinson does not name the Albrecht in one account, but he discusses the production again elsewhere in La Danse d'ajuourd'hui, in the chapter on the Romanov company, where he indeed identifies Oboukhov as Smirnova's Albrecht.\n\n1932\n\nIn London, Giselle is staged by Nicholas Sergueyev for the Camargo Society at the Savoy Theatre. Olga Spessivtseva and Anton Dolin (1904-1983) dance the lead roles. Frederick Ashton (1904-1988) is Hilarion.\n\nSilent film survives to show parts of Spessivtseva’s Act One performance and of Prudence Hyman and Stanley Judson in the Peasant pas de deux.\n\n1934\n\n1 January. Vic-Wells Ballet first night of Giselle at Sadler’s Wells, production by Nicholas Sergueyev; choreography “after Coralli”. Scenery and costumes by Barbara Allen. Alicia Markova (1910-2004), Anton Dolin, Hermione Darnborough are Giselle, Albrecht, Myrta. (Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet, Sarah Woodcock appendix, p.278.) Nine performances.\n\n1935\n\nWilliam Chappell (1907-1994) re-designs the Vic-Wells Giselle. Markova, Dolin, Beatrice Appleyard dance the lead three roles. Five performances.\n\n1936\n\nJanuary, London. The Markova-Dolin Ballet dances Giselle. Décor and costumes by Phyllis Doulton.\n\nMarkova receives coaching - perhaps later in the Markova-Dolin company’s life - by Bronislava Nijinska. (Markova, Giselle and I, p. 54)\n\n1937.\n\nMargot Fonteyn (1919-1991) makes her debut as Giselle, Sadler’s Wells, Vic-Wells Ballet. Silent films exist of parts of Act One. Robert Helpmann (1909-1986) is Albert: photographs suggest that his Albert dies at the end of the ballet, as in the Stepanov notation.\n\nFonteyn dances the role until 1969.\n\n1938\n\nLondon, Drury Lane. The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo stages a new production of Giselle, with new designs by Alexandre Benois. Alicia Markova and Serge Lifar (1905-1986) are first cast, with Alexandra Danilova (1903-1997) as Myrtha.\n\n1940\n\nAnton Dolin stages Giselle for American Ballet Theatre. Silent film exist of parts of a 1940 performance with Nana Gollner (1920-1980), as Giselle, and Dolin; and of a 1943 performance with Markova and Dolin.\n\n1944\n\nLeonid Lavrovsky (1905-1967) stages a new Giselle for the Bolshoi Ballet, with Galina Ulanova (1910-1998) as Giselle. This production was recognized as a revelation of Stanislavskian realism, not least when it is first danced by the Bolshoi in London in 1956.\n\n1945\n\nMarie Rambert (1888-1982) stages a famous Giselle with the Ballet Rambert, with Sally Gilmour (1921-2004) as Giselle.\n\n1946\n\n12 June, Covent Garden. Sadler’s Wells Ballet, new production of Giselle, production attributed again to Sergueyev, scenery and costumes by James Bailey (1925-1980). This production lasts till 1960; Bailey also designs the Royal Ballet’s next production (1960-1970), and his designs were used again for the 1980-85 one.\n\nAmerican Ballet Theater stages a new production of Giselle with designs by Eugene Berman (1899-1972). There are reports/rumors that George Balanchine (1904-1983) assisted in the staging, but that Dolin soon got rid of the Balanchine touches. Balanchine is believed to have added the ending with Giselle sinking into a flowery knoll on the side of the stage opposite her grave.\n\n1947\n\nWhen Tamara Toumanova (1919-1996) dances Giselle at the Paris Opera, Balanchine coaches her. According to Maria Tallchief (1925-2013), Balanchine’s coaching was revelatory, both for the role and the ballerina, but Toumanova then discarded all his touches at her performance. Balanchine nonetheless praised Toumanova to the heights: Tallchief, telling the story c.1980 to Arlene Croce, remarked “He was in love with her – he’s still in love with her!”\n\n1950s.\n\nIrina Kolpakova (b.1933) saw at the Kirov Ballet (as she later told Alexei Ratmansky) the ending with Giselle sinking into the flowery knoll opposite the grave.\n\n1956\n\nDuring the Bolshoi Ballet’s London season, one performance of its Lavrovsky Giselle is filmed at Covent Garden with Galina Ulanova and Nikolai Fadeyechev (1933-2020).\n\n1957, December\n\nWhen the British ballerina Beryl Grey toured the Soviet Union, she danced Giselle in Tbilisi. She found that the unfamiliar theatrical business for Act Two included an entrance through a trap door and an exit through another trap door (“disappearing into a bed of roses while miming to a sorrowful Albrecht that she gave her blessing to his marriage with Bathilde”). (David Gillard, Beryl Grey, 1977.)\n\n1958, January\n\nWhen Grey danced Giselle with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, she encountered further unfamiliar stage business. At one point she had to be pulled swiftly across the back of the stage on a trolley with one leg stuck up in a holder so that it looked as though she was floating around the woods poised in a perfect but, in the circumstances, thoroughly dangerous arabesque. Then there was much dashing up and down artificial hills, peering through imitation bushes and, finally, a perilous climb up twelve steps into a tree branch. Once aloft in the foliage she had to clamp herself into a hidden metal foot holder and hip rest and the branch was dipped down towards the doleful Albrecht, mooning about below. Standing on one leg, in arabesque, she had to drop flowers in him as he peered up into the tree. After that it was back down the stairs, across the stage and onto the top of her grave before beginning her descent through a trap-door, as the ghost of poor Giselle finally went to ground.” (David Gillard, Beryl Grey. 1977.)\n\n1960,30 September.\n\nA revised Royal Ballet Giselle has its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York. Choreography is now attributed to Coralli/Perrot as revised by Sergueyev, with supervision and supplementary choreography by Frederick Ashton, with the assistance of Tamara Karsavina. Margot Fonteyn, Michael Somes (1917-1994), Anya Linden (b.1933) lead the first cast. Ashton choreographs a new female variation for the peasant pas de deux; the Bathilde ending of the ballet is also reinstated but only for a few performances. Karsavina gives the production the version of Berthe’s Act One mime speech about the wilis; Gerd Larsen (1921-2001) was Berthe. This version of the mime speech is revived for the Covent Garden branch of the Royal Ballet in the 1980 and 1986 productions; the company still performs it.\n\n1968\n\nPeter Wright (b. 1926) first directs Giselle for the Royal Ballet touring company. Among other touches, the peasant pas de deux became a pas de six, thus avoiding the chance that any one soloist may outshine Giselle.\n\nSince then, Wright productions of Giselle have proliferated internationally.\n\nAlso this year, American Ballet Theatre acquires a new production of Giselle, staged by David Blair (1932-1976). Subsequent revisions are made in the early 1980s by Mikhail Baryshnikov (b.1948); in 1987 new designs are added; in the 1990s the production is reattributed to Kevin McKenzie (b.1954).\n\n1971\n\nMary Skeaping (1902-1984) stages a historically informed Giselle in highly Romantic style for London Festival Ballet, with an added pas de deux for Giselle and Albrecht in Act One and the fugue for the wilis in Act Two. Designs are by David Walker (1934-2008): they give several extra flying and other scenic effect.\n\nThis has been danced by the company’s successor, English National Ballet, in the twenty-first century.\n\n1977\n\nAt some time around here, the Kirov Ballet dances a new Giselle, largely traditional but supervised by Oleg Vinogradov (b.1937). In some performances over the years, certain special interpreters of Albert are allotted an extra variation in Act One. In Russia, the production is given with extra flying effects.\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n1984\n\nDance Theatre of Harlem production, set in Louisiana and the bayous. Staging by Frederic Franklin (1914-2013); scenery and costumes by Carl Michel.\n\n1985\n\nPeter Wright directs a new Royal Ballet production still performed in 2016. This can be seen on a 2008 color DVD, with Alina Cojocaru, Johan Kobborg, Marianela Nuñez, and a 2017 color DVD with Marianela Nuñez and Vadim Muntagirov. This retains (a) the Karsavina mime scene for Berthe (b) the peasant pas de six, but with Ashton’s variation for its lead woman.\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n1986, October.\n\nA new production of Giselle for the Bolshoi Ballet by Yuri Grigorovich (b.1927) has its premiere in Paris, with illustrious casts: Natalia Bessmertnova (1941-2008) and Yuri Vasyuchenko, Ludmila Semenyaka and Vyacheslav Gordeyev, Nadezhda Pavlova and Irek Mukhamedov, Nina Ananiashvili and Alexei Fadeyechev.\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n1987\n\nAmerican Ballet Theatre’s Giselle, attributed since 1980 to Mikhail Baryshnikov’s direction, is given new scenery (by Gianni Quaranta) and costumes by (Anna Anni). In later years, the direction is attributed to Kevin McKenzie and the score is re-orchestrated by John Lanchbery (1923-2003); but much of the production is unaltered from now.\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n1997\n\nVladimir Vasiliev (born 1940) stages Giselle for the Bolshoi Ballet, with designs by Hubert de Givenchy. In due course, this becomes one of two productions used by the Bolshoi. (I saw both in 2014.) Hilarion is a dance enthusiast who leads the village hops in Act One, and is still doing splendidly in Act Two when Moyna and Zulma hurl him into the lake regardless. Albrecht also has lots of energy at the end: once he loses Giselle forever, he does an ardent circuit of heroic jumps around the stage. The peasant pas de deux becomes a pas de huit, giving the impression that this village abounds in dance virtuosi.\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n2011\n\nPeter Boal, Marian Smith, and Doug Fullington stage a historically informed Giselle for Pacific Northwest Ballet.\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n2019\n\nAlexei Ratmansky stages a historically informed Giselle for the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow. (The company already has two current productions.)\n\nThis production is still performed.\n\n2022.\n\nRatmansky, using sets and costumes from David Bintley’s Birmingham Royal Ballet production, stages a new Giselle on the new United Ukrainian Ballet. This has its premiere in The Netherlands in August, and is then seen in London at the Coliseum in September.\n\n9.\n\nAM: Marian, a central point of your book Ballet and Opera in the Age of Giselle is that ballet at the Paris Opéra (the world’s most prestigious opera house at the time) always shared the programme with opera at every performance in the early nineteenth century. Did that remain true for Giselle in St Petersburg throughout the nineteenth century?\n\nDF: In Paris in 1841, Giselle was followed on the program by the third act of Rossini's opera Moïse et Pharaon. In St. Petersburg in 1842, Giselle appears to have been performed on its own. The premiere was a benefit for Antoine Titus, the balletmaster/stager.\n\nHere's a rundown of some later interpreters in St. Petersburg and what was also on the program:\n\nLucile Grahn (1843) - Giselle appears to have been the only work on the program\n\nFanny Elssler (1848) - Giselle, followed by a one-act vaudeville\n\nCarlotta Grisi (1850) - Giselle appears to have been the only work on the program\n\nNadezhda Bogdanova (1856) - Giselle appears to have been the only work on the program\n\nMarfa Muravieva (1862) - Giselle, followed by the first two acts of the ballet Robert and Bertram\n\nAdèle Grantzow (1866) - Giselle was followed by a divertissement\n\nEkaterina Vazem (1878) - Giselle, followed by the fourth scene of the ballet Meteora.\n\nMaria Gorshenkova (1884) - Giselle was followed by a divertissement\n\nEmma Bessone (1887) - Giselle may have been the only work on the program, but I don't have a program to confirm it\n\nElena Cornalba (1888) - I only have a program for 1 January 1889 at which Giselle was followed by the one-act ballet Peasant Wedding.\n\nHenrietta Grimaldi (1889) - Giselle, followed by the first act of the ballet Daughter of the Mikado.\n\nAnna Pavlova (1903) - Giselle, followed by the one-act ballet Flora's Awakening.\n\nMS: Also, FYI, there is a fun site called Chronopera. You can look up what was performed and when at the Opéra. It's not perfect (if you examine the calendar at the Opéra there are more details, including info about benefit performances) but is very useful and something that I consult often: http://chronopera.free.fr .\n\n10.\n\nAM: Doug, Marian: What sources have you used for your Pacific Northwest Giselle (new in 2011) and for your understanding of the ballet?\n\nDF: The Pacific Northwest production, for which Marian and I were consultants, is a “hybrid production,” if you will, and can’t be considered a reconstruction. We consulted the following sources:\n\n(i) The 1842 répétiteur: This was possibly compiled in Paris by Antoine Titus for use in the 1842 St. Petersburg staging of Giselle. It is a musical score arranged for violin and cello with many annotations in French relating to the action of the ballet.\n\n(ii) Justamant notation: This incredible document was prepared by Henri Justamant. It may document the Paris production, although it’s hard to determine when it was made based on what it includes and doesn’t include. It is a prose description of the entire ballet with detailed stick-figure drawings. Pantomime, action, and dance are described in French prose in great detail, and the whole thing reads like a screenplay.\n\n(iii) Stepanov notation: This was likely made circa 1899-1903 by Nikolai Sergueyev. It includes prose descriptions of mime and other action along with Stepanov notation of choreography, mostly for legs and feet, with occasional notation for upper body movement. Anna Pavlova is listed as Giselle in the first act; she first danced the role in 21903. In Act Two, she is listed as Zulme, a role she first danced in 1899.\n\nPeter Boal, who oversaw the PNB production, included now-traditional choreography that evolved over time, added a scene for children at the beginning of the ballet, and choreographed the “lost scene” with the villagers and wilis in Act Two. In addition, much of the material revived from Stepanov notation was altered by Peter according to personal taste.\n\nAM: Where is the original of the Titus? Are copies available?\n\nMS: It is at the Theatre Museum in St Petersburg. The Museum may make copies available, though I have no knowledge of its being digitized by the Museum as yet. I was able to purchase a microfilm of it in 1995.\n\nAM: And the Justamant?\n\nDF: The Justamant Giselle was published by the Deutsches Tanzarchiv in 2008.\n\nMS: Yes – fortunately, it has been published in facsimile by OLMS Verlag and is widely available.\n\nAM: Alexei, in your previous stagings of nineteenth-century ballets, you’ve mainly relied upon the Stepanov notations that were written in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the St Petersburg productions at the Mariinsky Theatre. But with Giselle, there are earlier documents.\n\nAR: Yes. I’m using the Stepanov notation as my main source; it was made by Nicholas Sergueyev. We can date it by judging from the names of the dancers mentioned: 1899 for Act Two and 1903 for Act One. But my big discovery has been Henri Justamant’s records. I’ve also been able to consult several different Russian versions (Petersburg and Moscow) of the Adam score, including the one owned by Enrico Cecchetti.\n\nSince my 2019 Bolshoi production, I’ve also studied a Danish edition of the score that the scholar Knud-Arne Jürgensen kindly sent me.\n\nAM: Can you say more about the score owned by Cecchetti?\n\nAR: I found it in the Glinka museum of music in Moscow. It was given to them by cellist Rostropovich. It belonged to Pavlova, but had a stamp of Cecchetti and his notes.\n\n11.\n\nAM: While I’m asking about Henri Justamant (1815-1893), can you tell me more about him? Until recent years, I was unaware of his work. But your Giselle is not the only twentyfirst-century staging I’ve seen to use him. (The Brooklyn Ballet, for example, has performed his Pas de l’Abeille.)\n\nSo was he - like Alexei Ratmansky! - a choreographer who also recorded the ballets of others? What ballets and/or dances did he record? In what ways is he either useful or frustrating? Did other nineteenth-century ballet-masters use his accounts as a resource? Was he forgotten in the twentieth century?\n\nMS: Claudia Jeschke and the late Robert Atwood reconstructed a pas from La Esmeralda (1859); it is in their film, called \"Dancetime: Romantic Ballet\" (available on iTunes), and they wrote about this pas and Justamant himself in an article in Dance Chronicle in 2006 (\"Expanding Horizons: Techniques of Choreo-Graphy in Nineteenth-Century Dance\"). The German scholars Gabi Vettermann and Paul Ludwig have also written about Justamant, who was born in Bordeaux in 1815 and trained at the Grand Théâtre there. As a young man, his career (as dancer or ballet master it is not quite clear) took him to various cities, including London, Berlin, Brussels, Lyon and Marseilles. After 1866, he produced ballets in no fewer than thirteen houses in Paris, including the Porte-Saint-Martin, the Théâtre de la Gaîté, the Renaissance, and the Opéra.\n\nHe recorded an enormous number of ballets. He also recorded ballets that were incorporated into operas, including Guillaume Tell and Les Vêpres siciliennes. Justamant was meticulous and tidy; he drew stick figures and wrote prose, naming particular steps. He also wrote out the text of the mimed conversations. His manuscripts are clear, detailed, and easy to read. They're miraculous! I have been compiling a list of his works and their whereabouts. Some are in Cologne (outside the city in Wahn Castle), some are in New York at the Dance Collection, some are at the Biblothèque de l’Arsenal, and some are at the Paris Opéra library (many of them available online at Gallica). There are a few others here and there.\n\nTo my way of thinking, the most exciting of the three unpublished collections is the one at Wahn Castle, because it includes major works. The musicologist Stephanie Schroedter is overseeing a publication on the Meyerbeer opera choreographies, I'm happy to say. I was just astonished when I found out the extent of the collection at Wahn, which includes descriptions of Le Corsaire, Paquita, Le Diable à Quatre, and Le Diable Amoureux.\n\nAM: Alexei, in the last few years, you’ve turned to re-examining the evidence for the nineteenth-century in a big way. Your use of the Stepanov and other Russian sources has been shown in productions in America, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and (I think) Russia. But you’ve discovered Justamant more recently.\n\nAR: Yes, my preparation for this Bolshoi Giselle (2019) is the first time I’ve worked with Justamant: he’s quite incredible, very, very detailed, with a lot of information. His account is beautifully written: it’s like a script for the movie. He’s absolutely wonderful, and I wonder if he was a more important choreographer than we think him: he’s so clever. People think he was documenting the Paris production of Giselle in the 1860s, but nobody is sure.\n\nSo here we have two notations from different times and different countries that at some times have great similarities but at other times are stylistically and choreographically very different. Petipa and Justament definitely had one source: the Jean Coralli version, new in 1841 at the Paris Opéra.\n\nI find Justamant so interesting that I wonder if he should not be given a much bigger role in dance history. He writes a lot about steps, about characterisation, and motivation. I think it’s possible to reconstruct his version of Giselle.\n\nThe text for our Bolshoi production is based on the Sergueyev notation – but there are some sections of the Justamant that I absolutely adore: I just can’t resist little things here and there.\n\nAM: Jane, may I bring you in at this point?\n\nJP: Henri Justamant is a brilliant source of information for nineteenth-century ballet. While it is true there is no official catalogue of his work. there is the sale catalogue for his manuscripts: Em. Paul, L. Huard et Guillemin Catalogue de livres anciens et modernes, et des manucripts originaux des ballets et divertissements de M. Henri Justamant. Vente du 15 mai 1893 (Hotel Drouot) Paris 1893. An original is in the Paris Opera collection and a photocopy in the Jerome Robbins Dance Collection NYPL.\n\nHere I add a note I wrote somewhere, probably decades ago:\n\n“Although information is sadly lacking on Henri Justamant in most histories of ballet (and his name frequently misspelled), thanks to the survival of much of his extensive archive, his career can be well documented. The only entry for Justamant in a twentieth-century dance dictionary (Barbara Cohen-Stratyner’s Biographical Dictionary of Dance 1982) claims that ‘there is no solid data on Justament’s [sic] birth, death, or training....’ the catalogue for the sale of his notation manuscripts following his death, gives an outline of his career, revealing that he was born in Bordeaux in 1815 and died at Parc Saint-Maur in 1890. His early choreography was created for the Grand Theatres of Marseilles, Bordeaux and Lyons (1843 – 60) and between 1861-64 he was ballet master at the Théâtre royale de la Monnaie, Brussels. From the mid-1860s he primarily worked at popular Parisian theatres including the Porte Saint-Martin, the Varieties, Renaissance, Folies-Bergère, Châtelet, Gaîté and Eden-théâtre he briefly choreographed at the Opéra in 1869. His most important and influential creations were the ballets in Offenbach’s Le Voyage dans la lune at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in 1875. He also choreographed ballets and feeries at Berlin and the Alhambra, London.”\n\nI am somewhat obsessed by how Justamant’s Le Voyage dans la lune starts a whole trend of Snow Ballets leading to the scene in Nutcracker.\n\nAR: There are some sections when I’m not a hundred percent sure that what Nicholas Sergueyev wrote down was Petipa’s idea. With some of his (Sergueyev’s) descriptions, you feel you’re with someone who was not in the heart of the rehearsal, someone who sees it from the side.\n\n12.\n\nAM: The Stepanov notations are not only with Nicholas Sergueyev’s papers in the Harvard Theater Collection but some have been digitized and are viewable on line. Should we assume that these 1899 and 1903 notations represent Marius Petipa’s supervision of the old ballet – and indeed his final thoughts on it? (Pavlova was the great protégée of his final years.)\n\nDF: I think we can assume this, although the actual preparation of the 1903 production was done by Alexander Shiryaev as Petipa’s assistant. I’m looking at casting for Giselle during these years and match names listed in the notation to determine more exactly when the notations were made.\n\nAM: Pavlova then went on to dance Giselle for almost twenty years in the West. She certainly made some radical experiments with its costuming (in Act Two, she sometimes wore grave-clothes closer to the Greek garb of Isadora Duncan than the supernatural sylph look of Romantic ballet) - but it’s likely that much of what she danced in the West was closely related to the version recorded in the Stepanov notation, since her name was mentioned in that for both acts. An oddity, however, is that - although the 1903 notation records her dancing the big Act One variation with hops on point (Drigo music) - neither she nor Karsavina seem to have danced it in the West.\n\nOlga Spessivtseva danced Giselle in London in 1932 (part of her Act One was recorded on silent film) not long after Pavlova’s death; London critics compared the two interpretations. It was she who introduced the big Act One variation to the West: Dolin, who partnered her, thought it had been made for her, as did many others on the strength of his word.\n\nBut there was another important Western production, the 1910-1914 one that the Diaghilev Ballet Russe danced in Paris and later London. Alexandre Benois, who had admired Giselle since the 1880s in St Petersburg, designed this Ballet Russe staging. (He designed some later Giselle stagings too. One of these is the basis for the current Paris Opera production.) And Mikhail Fokine, who in many ways led ballet away from the style of St Petersburg, directed this Diaghilev Giselle, which featured the two pre-eminent Diaghilev stars, Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky.\n\nDF: According to the scholar Andrew Foster, Karsavina didn’t dance Giselle in St Petersburg until after the Diaghilev production. But she had been coached in the role by Evgenia Sokolova; her debut as Giselle occurred in Prague on 24 April 1909, partnered by Achille Viscusi.\n\nAM: Nijinsky danced Albrecht in Paris a few months before doing so in St Petersburg. Pavlova, whom Russian connoisseurs considered the greater ballerina, did dance Giselle with the Diaghilev production, but in London in 1911.\n\nDo either of you know if there are any important discrepancies between the Mariinsky/Stepanov Giselle and this 1910-1911 Ballet Russe one?\n\nDF: Harvard has two annotated piano scores relating to the 1910 Diaghilev production. The entire ballet is heavily cut. Several numbers are re-ordered in act one, and a man’s variation (“La Variation d’homme pour Giselle 1er acte”) from Tulip of Haarlem is interpolated before Giselle’s usual variation. (There is no notation for this variation that I know of.) Both piano reductions are heavily annotated in Russian and both are heavily marked in red, blue, green, and regular pencil. They’re kind of a mess and will take some lengthy going over to make sense of them.\n\nAM: Hm. Alicia Markova writes, in Giselle and I, that Nicholas Sergueyev offered her the choice of two variations for her main Act One solo - Karsavina’s or Spessivtseva’s? She chose Spessivtseva’s. We’ll come back to that later. But it’s a puzzle: What variation was Karsavina’s? Whose was the one from Tulip of Haarlem?\n\nDF: Based on the répétiteur interpolated into the piano score, the Tulip of Haarlem variation was a man’s variation. It precedes Giselle’s variation in the Diaghilev score.\n\nThat said, the G major flute solo that is part of the now-discarded Act One divertissement appear to have been used in the Diaghilev production. Maybe that was Karsavina’s solo? I don’t think it was notated, unless it hasn’t been identified.\n\nThe Sergeyev Collection includes a woman’s variation from Tulip of Haarlem, as danced by Vera Trefilova. It doesn’t match the Haarlem music interpolated into the Diaghilev Giselle.\n\nMG: The question of the G major flute solo - I wonder if this is the same solo that Mary Skeaping uses for the extra pas de deux and solos in her production?\n\n(I would love to hear the Tulip of Haarlem solo that Vera Trefilova danced!)\n\nAM: And am I right to assume the Diaghilev company only performed it in 1910-1911?\n\nDF: I don’t have a complete repertory list by year, but Harvard has Ballets Russes Giselle programs from 18 September 1913 at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires (Karsavina and Nijinsky), and 26 April 1914 (location not given, but text in French; Karsavina and Bolm).\n\nAM: Was this Diaghilev/ Benois production resurrected by one of the post-Diaghilev Ballet Russe companies?\n\nDF: I’m not sure how much this production influenced later ones. If Fokine and Diaghilev were responsible for changes in this production that differ from the standard Maryinsky version of the day, then I assume later productions weren’t particularly influenced by this one, except any staged by Fokine.\n\nAM: Am I right that the Stepanov was the basis for three important Western productions in the 1930s? Namely, the 1932 Paris Opera one with Olga Spessivtseva and Serge Lifar, the 1932 Camargo Society production in London with Spessivtseva and Anton Dolin, the 1934 Vic-Wells one with Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin.\n\nMarkova danced Giselle until 1959: a legendary and influential interpretation, documented in several films (some silent, some with sound) between 1940 and the 1950s. I think Sergueyev also supervised Margot Fonteyn’s first Giselle in 1937 (we have much of her 1937 Act One on a silent film); she went on dancing the role till 1970 (even longer than Markova), and was coached in it in 1948 by Karsavina. We also have a 1962(?) studio film of her in the Act Two pas de deux with Rudolf Nureyev, and a very clear color silent film of her Act One in 1965.\n\nSergueyev also staged Giselle for Mona Inglesby’s International Ballet in the 1940s. It was from Inglesby that the Harvard Theatre Collection bought all Sergeev’s remarkable collection of Stepanov notations and other documents, which now are available on line.\n\nDF: Sergueyev also staged the 1924 Paris Opéra production.\n\n13.\n\nAM: The choreography of the 1841 premiere was officially credited to the ballet master Jean Coralli - but Gautier lets us know that Giselle’s choreography was unofficially devised by Perrot. (Bournonville’s memoirs support this; they also say that some of Grisi’s material came from an older work.)\n\nPerrot then took the ballet to London (where Elssler danced it as well as Grisi), St Petersburg and other cities; Coralli’s name was dropped from those later productions. Giselle, however, continued in Parisian repertory till the 1860s: how long was Coralli’s name attached to it?\n\nDF: Coralli is given credit in the affiche for the St. Petersburg premiere in 1842. This continued in Petersburg during the Perrot years (1850-1858) and into the Saint-Léon years.\n\nIn 1850, when Perrot revised the production for Grisi in Petersburg, only Coralli (with Gautier) is credited (affiche for 15 October 1850, O.S.), but by 1856 (Bogdanova), Coralli is given general credit for the ballet and Perrot is given credit for the current production. This remained the case during Saint-Leon’s tenure in 1862 (Muravieva), and 1866 (Grantzow).\n\nI don’t have affiches for 1884 and 1887, but on 1 January 1889 (O.S., Cornalba), general credit is given to St. Georges and Coralli, with the current production credited to Petipa. By 1899, Gautier was added again to the general credits. This triple general attribution was still in place in 1922. It has been copied elsewhere since, which may explain Jennifer Homans’ attribution (in The New Yorker, 2019) of the libretto of Giselle to Coralli.\n\nAM: Perrot became the dominant ballet master in St Petersburg from the late 1840s till the late 1850s; Marius Petipa – brother of Lucien Petipa, the original Albert of 1841 - gained much of his early experience there in Perrot’s regime. The Russian Giselle is the one that survived with an unbroken performances tradition, but most of our evidence for this Russian Giselle comes from during or after Petipa’s era. We’ll be discussing how this Petipa Giselle – notably the Stepanov notations from 1899 and 1903 – differs from the French ones of 1841, 1842, and the late 1860s, but can we tell whether Perrot changed Giselle significantly once he took it out of Paris? The changes you observe between the French and Russian Giselles: could some of them have begun with him rather than with Petipa?\n\nDF: They could have been, yes. But it’s hard for me to say, not having access to sources held by the Maryinsky. Beyond changes to the score and mentions in reviews or other writings, I’m not certain how we could know. Comparing Justamant with Stepanov/Sergueyev, many of the significant changes are in the ensemble dances.\n\n14.\n\nAM: What about Adolphe Adam’s score? I assume that exists in at least two main versions: the Paris 1841 one and the Mariinsky one. Can you first tell me about Adam’s original?\n\nMany ballets scores of that era were patchworks of multiple known items, stitched together like composite scores for silent movies. (Those for La Fille mal gardée and Napoli are good examples.) But Giselle, like the Schneitszhoeffer score for the 1832 La Sylphide, was almost entirely original. I’ve listed its few borrowings in section 1 above. (Actually, although the music for one dance was recognised as taken from Weber’s Euryanthe, I hear an echo from Weber’s more famous Der Freischütz, which entered the Paris Opera repertory in 1841. And, at least in some arrangements, Albert’s entrance in Act Two can evoke that of Gluck’s Orphée into the Elysian Fields.)\n\nDF: Regarding Adam’s original—where to start? It closely follows the action of the libretto. Marian is the expert there. There were a number of passages that appear to have been omitted from early performances. A piano reduction was published, but the orchestral score was not; this means when Giselle was produced in other cities, the score was likely re-orchestrated, resulting in the loss of Adam’s detailed orchestration choices. Music was deleted from and added to the score in Paris over time, particularly in the 1860s.\n\nMS: There were probably many Giselle scores circulating around Europe in the form of répétiteurs, which, as Doug points out, were likely re-orchestrated when the ballet was produced in different cities. These scores were not systematically preserved, though there may still be a few of them, here and there, in archives or in someone’s attic. The late Alexander Bennett had a photocopy of a nineteenth-century Sylphide répétiteur from Brussels that had been handed down through the generations.\n\nAM: The Peasant pas de deux is apparently by Burgmüller. When was that added?\n\nDF: The “Peasant” pas de deux was added before the première and is part of the original orchestra parts.\n\nMS. Yes, it was added before the premiere.\n\nAM: And various productions provide alternative music for at least one of the female variations in this pas de deux.\n\nDF: Rodney Edgecombe, in his article, “A ragbag of ballet music oddments” (https://ausdance.org.au/articles/details/a-ragbag-of-ballet-music-oddments), discusses this variation, which was apparently added to Giselle by Vaganova in 1932. He suggests it’s from the ballet Cupid’s Prank, which was choreographed by Ivanov to music by Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Friedman. The Wikipedia article on Giselle states the variation was first added to Giselle in 1886 for Emma Bessone (dancing the title role) with music by Drigo. There are two problems with the Wiki assertion. One: Bessone made her St. Petersburg debut in Giselle on 12 April 1887 (O.S.), The other: the citation provided is from a 1929 biography of Drigo that 1) doesn’t mention Giselle, and 2) doesn’t have a page 74, the page listed in the citation. This situation illustrates some common problems with Giselle scholarship—lack of confirmed information and misinformation.\n\n15.\n\nAM: Adam’s score also has a number of motifs or reminiscences. These have been called leitmotifs, using the term associated with Wagner’s music-dramas: we could spend a lot of time on this nomenclature. My understanding is that there is a difference between motifs (which are musical reminiscences - a fairly standard dramatic device in mid-nineteenth-century opera) and leitmotifs (which are symphonically developed to establish a web of underlying psychological suggestions). Giselle’s Mad Scene quotes musical moments from earlier in the act just as the heroine of Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor (1835) quotes earlier moments in her own Mad Scene: but that’s not a leitmotif.\n\nThere are clear musical motifs for Giselle, Albert, Hilarion, the Courland hunting party, and the wilis: they don’t change much, and I wouldn’t call them leitmotifs. How new or standard was this kind of musical characterization in 1841?\n\nMS: As I have argued elsewhere, ballet composers used a variety of dramatic devices, and the recurring melody was one of them. It was used fairly commonly; for instanced, Manon (1830), La Sylphide (1832), Les Mohicans (1837). Wagner attended Giselle early in its first run in Paris and wrote a rather derisive review of it, but was very likely to have been influenced by Adam’s use of recurring melodies in it.\n\nSome of Adam’s recurring melodies in Giselle do undergo transformations: for instance, Berthe’s melody and the vinegatherers’ melody. For me, the question is not “How do they compare to Wagner? Are they leitmotifs?” It’s “How effective are they in the theater?”\n\nAM: Good point.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the Act Two music for Giselle the ghost quotes the “He loves me, he loves me not” music from Act One with a mildly symphonic dramatic poetry that is certainly unusual in my knowledge of pre-1850 ballet music. And it’s developed most remarkably in a variation that was added after Adam’s day – Giselle’s final variation. Perhaps this, composed perhaps by Minkus or Pugni, is where we should speak of a leitmotif?\n\nDF: The Act Two quotation is not by Adam. This is in the introduction to a variation added probably in 1866 for Adèle Grantzow.\n\n16.\n\nAM: Unlike some nineteenth-century ballet scores, and indeed unlike most operas of that day, it sustains a remarkable continuity. Breaks for applause are infrequent. How unusual was that in 1841?\n\nMS: I don’t think it was unusual. The idea of these ballets was: drama punctuated by dance scenes and full-blown danced numbers from time to time. The libretti make this clear by recounting the stories in prose, in great detail, and inserting the word “ballet” or “dance” as necessary.\n\nSeeing Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake is akin to the experience of the Paris ballet-goer of 1841, I believe: lots of action, no spoken text, some dance numbers, and an audience that’s following the story.\n\n17.\n\nAM: The Justamant documentation for Giselle tells us of the Paris production. But Giselle soon passed out of Paris repertory, yes? Can you remind me precisely when?\n\nMS: Giselle fell out of the Opéra's repertory in 1868, and did not appear again at that house until 1910.\n\nAM: And the 1910 production was Diaghilev’s Ballet Russe rather than one by the Opéra company, yes? Am I right that the Paris company only re-acquired “Giselle” in 1932?\n\nDF: Yes, the 1910 production was the Ballets Russes production. Nikolai Sergueyev restaged Giselle for the Paris Opéra in 1924 with Spessivtseva in the title role. This marked the return of Giselle to the Opéra repertory.\n\n18.\n\nAM: As we’ve said, Giselle was kept going, in Russia alone, through the final decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century; Marius Petipa - brother of Lucien Petipa, the original Albert – maintained it in Russian repertory. Am I right to presume that the Stepanov notation records Marius Petipa’s revisions to the ballet? Or do you suspect it records the work of other ballet masters too?\n\nDF: Yes, I presume the Stepanov notation records Petipa’s revisions to Giselle as it was performed at the Maryinsky Theatre in St Petersburg circa 1899-1903. We believe Petipa kept a number of elements (choreography, mime, staging) from earlier French versions, with which he was no doubt familiar.\n\nIn his memoirs, Alexander Shiryaev states he was the ballet master in charge of the 1903 staging of Giselle at the Maryinsky and that he staged the production from memory. I assume he staged the ballet as it had been performed in earlier Maryinsky revivals.\n\n19.\n\nAM: So this perhaps is a good moment to ask about the elements that you believe Petipa was drawing from the Paris production. His brother Lucien had created the role of Albert; Perrot, under whom he worked in St Petersburg, had been involved in both the Paris and St Petersburg stagings.\n\nWe often read that Petipa made extensive changes to Giselle (and other ballets). Doubtless he did; but we also know that Perrot took him to court in Paris and successfully sued him for plagiarism.\n\nWhere can you detect or suspect signs that he was using (or preserving) earlier Giselle material?\n\nTo me, Marius Petipa is an endlessly mysterious figure: original or derivative? Perhaps all choreographic classicists draw from their predecessors while, to their successors, seeming to start a new tradition; but he is, to me, the most enigmatic. Any clues you can give to his character as an artist would be much appreciated!\n\nMS: My impression is that Petipa definitely drew quite a bit from the Paris production (that is, from the production described by Justamant, which we assume was the Paris production). We know, at the very least, that Petipa knew details of the first act from a very early version, because he notated a printed piano score of Giselle with many details that are found in Titus's répétiteur (1842). This score is at the Theatre Museum in St. Petersburg. (For your information, some scholars now doubt the attribution to the manuscript notes to Petipa.)\n\nDoug is doing a systematic comparison of the Justamant and Stepanov notations. It will be quite revealing, and will likely show that historians have been mistaken in telling us that Petipa's Giselle was a complete overhaul of the ballet. Petipa never intended it to be completely new — he was a genius at what he did, and could take a ballet and adjust it as he saw fit. We already know (just by examining the music) that he greatly expanded the second-act pas de deux, in keeping with the custom of St. Petersburg in the 1880s. Soon, we will know more details about what Petipa drew from his predecessors.\n\nDF: This is one of the million-dollar Petipa questions: When reviving a Parisian ballet, or any ballet first choreographed by another, what did Petipa keep and what did he add?\n\nThe Justamant Giselle notation is a key document, allowing us to delve into the answer. Petipa was familiar with the Paris Giselle, which premiered in 1841. He danced it in Spain and after he moved to St. Petersburg in 1847, he danced in the St. Petersburg production staged by Titus in 1842. Perrot’s Petersburg stagings followed in 1850 and finally Petipa restaged the ballet in 1884. That the ballet had gone through so many hands, yet still retained many similarities with what we know of Paris productions, suggests that choreographers, in re-staging existing ballets, were not averse to keeping some or even many details, both of mise-en-scène and choreography.\n\nA cursory comparison of the Justamant and Stepanov notations of Giselle reveals the following similarities:\n\nACT ONE\n\n- Albert’s first entrance and conversation with Wilfride\n\n- Scène dansante:\n\no Counterclockwise, circular ground plan for Giselle’s first entrance\n\no Downstage left position of bench outside of Albert’s hut\n\no Giselle and Albert perform multiple glissades as they make their way toward the bench\n\no Game of he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not\n\n- First confrontation with Hilarion\n\n- Waltz:\n\no Semicircular position of corps women around Giselle at beginning\n\no Groupings of corps women in circle (Justamant)/pinwheel (Stepanov) formations involving Giselle and Albert\n\no Two rows of corps women on the diagonal at stage right. Women in one row exchange places with their counterparts in the other row. Giselle and Albert dance along the diagonal (patterns and steps differ between the two notations)\n\no Long line of dancers forms near end of waltz, with Giselle and Albert at either end. Dancers hold each by the waist as the line turns in a circular pattern. [MS: This formation is also notated in a margin in the Titus manuscript, the only bit of choreographic notation in that manuscript. So it goes back to 1842, at the latest.]\n\no Next, corps women form two vertical lines at center stage and move together downstage\n\no Waltz concludes in opening semicircular formation with Giselle and Albert downstage right (Justamant)/center (Stepanov)\n\n- Pas de deux: Coda (Justamant)/Pas de deux for Giselle and Albert (Stepanov). Many of the steps in this dance are performed in tandem by Giselle and Albert. Similar steps and patterns include:\n\no Multi"
