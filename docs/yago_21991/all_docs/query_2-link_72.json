        "text": "The presentation given today entitled “Cosmetics, Yellowface, and the Exotic Other” opened my eyes to portrayals of Asian cultures in theater. One of many Shakespeare productions I’ve seen that has been set in some part of Asia is Kenneth Branagh’s 2006 film version of As You Like It. I remember enjoying this movie very much, but today’s presentation has challenged me to rethink my enjoyment and support. With that I will attempt to break down this movie to find where it lies on the spectrum of appreciation to appropriation\n\nAs You Like It has all the signs of a typical Shakespearean comedy: there’s love, the female lead dresses like a man for a while, everyone ends up in the forest, and there are a few weddings and reunions at the end. Branagh’s film sets the classic Shakespearean comedy in late 19th century Japan, during the Meiji period. This was a time in which the west had a great influence in Japan and Japan began to move away from its traditional feudal system (Howell, 172). Branagh cites several reasons for setting the film in Japan in an interview. Wanting to avoid the typical “English cakes and ale” As You Like It that is so often staged, Branagh embraces the unique color palate of the Japanese landscape (check, no racism here, colors are pretty! Yay!), and a sense of real danger from the natural world of the forest (I’m less convinced, Kenneth. My limited research of mammals in Japan leads me to believe that there isn’t any real danger there). In Branagh’s defense, a lion attack is mentioned in the script, and historically Warwickshire, UK and the forest of Ardennes in France, two places that are suspected to be the real life basis for the forest in the play, have no lions either. Branagh had to look outside these two locations for somewhere with a more realistic natural setting, but unfortunately, he didn’t actually find one that suited his directorial vision. Finally, Branagh says that the forest should be “a place of the imagination” and “something exotic” (…and you’ve dropped the e-bomb. Can’t support you there, Kenny).\n\nIn his interview, Branagh speaks very vaguely, saying “with that idea of Japan, that impression of Japan, you‘ve got to have…” He is obviously playing into the western exotification of Japan and not creating a wholly educated and respectful portrayal of Japan. As Hooks describes in “Eating the Other,” non-whiteness stands outside of the dominant culture, and can be used as a spice or a fantasy at the whites’ discretion.\n\nBranagh does not do a great job of including Asian actors, except as background or extremely minor characters, and unfortunately his direction exploits and perpetuates Asian stereotypes. Japanese extras living in the forest are portrayed as gentle, kind, generous, and submissive to the white characters. As Rosalind (the heroine) and others travel through the forest, the Japanese characters they meet (most of whom don’t have any lines) are seen initially as a threat, until they welcome or peacefully avoid the westerners. The characters of Phoebe and Silvius are portrayed as Japanese, however they are played by white actors. (It is unclear if the makeup artist and hair stylist employed yellowface or if the actors are in fact part Asian.) The only obviously Asian actor who has lines plays William and is submissive, physically small, and only has lines in one scene. During the dramatic wrestling scene, Japanese female extras are screaming and flailing while Rosalind and Celia (both played by white actresses) are still shocked but much more poised. Furthermore, Charles the wrestler is a sumo wrestler, giving the first example in the film of the “repulsiveness” of the “both allure and repulsiveness” of the othered group that today’s presentation discussed.\n\nSomething unusual about the film is its hierarchy of race. Black actors play the brothers Orlando and Oliver, two major characters in the story. With Asian actors playing only the smallest roles, this places Asians at the bottom of the racism food chain, which over the past ten weeks we have seen is not typically the case.\n\nThe unfortunate cherry on top of this is that the evil duke wears all black Japanese armor, while the good duke wears lighter colors and western clothes. This is so very typical coloring, and aligns the Japanese culture with the more dangerous side of the story.\n\nIt seems that these issues exist all across our culture, from TV to pop music to productions of Shakespeare. But what are we to do about this? Can we still enjoy these movies for the sweeping landscapes and compelling acting? Or do a director’s problematic choices negate any value in a film? I think the answer is that we have to be the ones to make films and music and art, and to make ripples, to make positive, inclusive perspectives visible where we can.\n\nSources\n\nHooks, Bell. “Eating the Other: Desire and Resistance.” In Black Looks: Race and Representation, 21-39.
