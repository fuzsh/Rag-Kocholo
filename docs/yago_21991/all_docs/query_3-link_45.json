        "text": "This work was initially written in German language as part of my book entitled 'Aerophone im Instrumentarium der Völker Ostafrikas' (Aerophones in East Africa). Trafo Wissenschaftsverlag, Berlin (2009). In this project, a series of short entries of aerophones found in East Africa will be made accessible to interested readers. The research on aerophones in this geographic area as well as in the entire African continent is still at its infancy. This is a first attempt to introduce the various types of aerophones in the musical traditions of East Africa.\n\nIn 2004 I received a research fellowship by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). The major aim of this scientific project gave particular attention to all types of blowing instruments found among the abundant ethnic communities of the East African region. The investigations included a six month lasting fieldwork and data collection in thoughtfully selected five countries of this geographic region, i.e. Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenia, Tanzania and the Sudan, which took place between the months of February and July 2005. However, prior to leaving for field research, I undertook pre-studies in several institutions in Berlin and Vienna. This referred to the historical Phonogram Archives (Phonogrammarchiv Berlin and Wien) including the museums, particularly the collections of African musical instruments in both institutions (Völkerkundemuseum Berlin and Wien, today’s World Museum of Viena). At the Phonogram Archives, I was able to access abundant audio recordings made during fieldwork by mainly European scholars and researchers, while on the other hand by travellers may also be mentioned. According to the data, the recordings were made at different times as well as in the different African regions. Although the focal point of my investigations was East Africa, I also took this rare opportunity to take a look at the data deriving from other African regions/nations/ethnicities. ......\n\nThis work was initially written in German language as part of my book entitled 'Aerophone im Instrumentarium der Völker Ostafrikas' (Aerophones in East Africa).
