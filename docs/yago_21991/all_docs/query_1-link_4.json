        "text": "Kenneth Branagh is no Ingmar Bergman, hardly needs stating, but even more so when it comes to adapting The Magic Flute.\n\nMozart with added cleavage. That is his approach.\n\nIt is admirably adventurous, set during a CGI-heavy World War One battlefield, with a libretto in English by noted bore Stephen Fry, but it doesn't really hang together. Branagh directs the hell out of the sequences, but it does little to hide the limitations of his cast.\n\nThe film does the unforgivable thing of dragging, unforgivable when you have music this kinetic and perfect. However, you find yourself by the hour mark keening for the end.\n\nEven the cleavage wasn't enough and if you follow my reviews you know that it usually is.\n\nThe Magic Flute is one of my favorite operas and I have seen it performed at the Metropolitan Opera several times. I also like Ingmar Bergman's filmed version from the 1970s.\n\nBranagh's version is a mixed bag. The singing is excellent, the acting not bad for opera singers, and Mozart's glorious music is intact. Branagh's concept is interesting, at times effective, but much of it is silly or over the top.\n\nSo, two stars for Mozart, another star for the singing, and 1/2 star for the production and direction.\n\nKenneth Branagh, my closest frenemy\n\nMovies Adapted from the Stage\n\nA really bizarre little experiment, but also strangely delightfully. Branagh takes an already-bonkers story and makes it all the more bonkers, by putting it on film, and using osme of the most ridiculous CGI I've ever seen.\n\nIt makes a nice companion piece with Branagh’s ”Love’s Labours’ Lost” - both are musical comedies that use comedy as a foil to the pain of wartimes; one setting during World War I, the other during World War II.\n\nIt’s pretty charming, and well-sung. It has a very stage-y feel to it, which makes the experience all more strange. It also makes for a perfectly solid show-case of the original material; he captures the comedic sensibilities of “The Magic Flute,,\" while putting his own spin on it.\n\nThis is a huge mess but I love the ambition of it. A lot of fun, unexpected moments along with stretches that don't work at all. It's really trying to do something.\n\nI think it helps that this is one of my favorite operas and I know it inside and out. I'm intrigued at what somebody would think if this was their first experience with The Magic Flute.\n\nSo is this the Kenneth movie nobody talks about, the flash in the pan, the chimera, the collective hallucination, that \"did it really happen?\" I must said that I really respect how he believes in his ideas but in the end Im also wtf mood. I wonder how it came to his mind something like this and yet I am so surprised each time by this man's mind. He has a fairytale mind, I love him. Centuries ago not only in Shakespeare's audience but he must have been a fairystoryteller too for sure.\n\nAn uncut classic opera, put in the setting of word war one, opening with a 7 minute long one-take of a battlefield that can seriously compete with 1917.\n\nCan't believe how expensive this movie looks and how many months must have been spent on the CGI that honestly looks very good for 2006. The film is well directed, shot, sung and extraordinarily well choreographed and I seriously don't get why no one knows of the existence of this film.\n\nTo be honest, the movie stretches too much, after a while the almost never stopping music becomes annoying, Papageno's chemistry with Tamina is a little too overdone and the film gets very schmaltzy at many times.\n\nBut till more people have to see this!"
