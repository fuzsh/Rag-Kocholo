        "text": "There is a line in an earlier Kenneth Branagh movie, A Midwinter’s Tale, also known as In the Bleak Midwinter. The hero is putting on a performance of Hamlet for Christmas. As he explains his plans to his sister, he exclaims that of course it would be absurd to set the play in the seventeenth century, even though that was the age in which the play was written.\n\nI sometimes wish that Branagh had paid more attention to the gently satirical humour implied in this line. The most acclaimed of his Shakespeare film adaptations, Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing, were set in the period in which the action of the original play was set, and suffered nothing from this lack of innovation.\n\nHowever Branagh’s later movie reimaginings of Shakespeare slip in the bad habit of seeking out an alternative location and setting for the plays, the kind of gimmick that is used rather too often in stage versions. Did Hamlet really benefit from Victorian furnishings? Was anyone’s experience of Love’s Labour’s Lost enhanced when Branagh set the action in 1939?\n\nPerhaps the most bizarre setting of all was the one that Branagh chose for the last of his Shakespeare adaptations (at the time of writing). As You Like It has the further distinction of being the only one of Branagh’s Shakespeare cycle in which he does not appear on screen, although we hear his voice calling, “And…cut!” during the credits.\n\nBack to the setting. The location of Branagh’s version of As You Like It is so obscure that he is obliged to provide an explanation at the beginning of the film since nobody on earth could have guessed from the movie itself. The action takes place in 19th Century Japan at a time when English traders lived in enclaves near ports.\n\nThere are a few points to say in Branagh’s defence. Shakespeare’s play is itself somewhat vague about its setting. Most of the story is set in the Forest of Arden, but goodness knows where this is. The characters have English, Italian and French names. This capacious wood can support a clan of hunting courtiers, as well as farmland and dwellings. It contains snakes and a lion. It certainly resembles no wood that one might find in Europe.\n\nBranagh is also able to use the setting to great advantage. It adds colour to the action. We see many Japanese trappings –a Geisha girl, Kabuki theatre, Sumo wrestling. Tai Chi, Ninjas and so on. Hairstyles, clothing, paper fans and décor are in the Japanese style, complete with the sliding doors and low seats that we often see in movies made in Japan.\n\nStill these are little more than frills, and do not add meaning to the play itself. The setting is irrelevant to the storyline. Indeed some have accused Branagh of exoticism – the reduction of another culture to a sense of otherness apart from western culture. Certainly it is less respectful for Japan than it first appears. The film was not made on location, but shot in Wakehurst Place. It contains few characters or actors who are actually Japanese, and some of these behave in a manner that is subservient to the western characters.\n\nI suspect that part of the problem is that Branagh’s background was in theatre, and he never loses that habit. Gimmicks that work well in enhancing stage productions are more mystifying when viewed on screen where they achieve permanence, or at least a much longer life than would be expected from a theatre production.\n\nThere are other moments when As You Like It seems more like a work for the stage than the cinema. Consider Branagh’s use of the camera. As in many of his films it is frequently too far from the action. It often looks like the viewpoint of the audience in a theatre, or that of a stage manager who has to sit in the auditorium giving out directions.\n\nThen there is the doubling of Brian Blessed in two roles as Duke Frederick and Duke Senior. The doubling of actors is often used on-screen, but at its best the idea is to make some point about the duality of two characters. In theatre, doubling up is often used as an economy when there is only enough money for a small cast, and it is easier to get one actor to play several characters who are not seen on stage together.\n\nAn argument could be made for the two characters being interesting contrasts to one another, dark and light, and therefore worthy of twinning on-screen. The two roles allow Blessed to perform the two parts that he seems to have spent most of his acting life playing – the menacing, quietly-spoken, faintly camp villain, and the boisterous jolly man with the booming voice who is larger-than-life.\n\nBlessed rises well to the challenge of playing both roles at once. Duke Frederick dresses in black, and sports a black beard. The nicer Duke Senior has a white beard and wears lighter clothes. Frederick is a man who seized power from his brother, but his ambition isolates him from everyone else. He is paranoid and drives out many people. Even when he repents at the end, he does so in a way that leaves him isolated and unreachable.\n\nSenior on the other hand is sociable and friendly, and is never seen away from the company of men and women who seem genuinely fond of him. This convivial quality in Duke Senior identifies him as someone who gains the approval of Kenneth Branagh. Few directors have managed to convey a sense of joy better than Branagh.\n\nHis films often contain scenes of happy people celebrating and taking pleasure in one another’s company – Much Ado About Nothing, Peter’s Friends and A Midwinter’s Tale all come to mind. The happiness of the characters and the spirited performances by the actors is infectious, and I find myself smiling when I watch them.\n\nThis happiness comes from friendship, and not from family. In Much Ado About Nothing, Hero is treated badly by her father and uncle, and the conflict that drives the plot is the result of enmity between two brothers. Family members do not feature at all in Peter’s Friends, while in A Midwinter’s Tale the troupe of actors find comfort with one another away from the disapproval and disappointment of their kin. When an actress in the latter movie mentions her ‘family’ warmly, she is referring to her fellow-thespians.\n\nSimilarly in As You Like It, the characters find solace in love and friendship, but not in family. Two brothers drive away their siblings. Duke Frederick usurps and banishes Duke Senior. Oliver de Boys (Adrian Lester) denies an education to, and then conspires against the life of, his brother Orlando (David Oyelowo), forcing Orlando to join Duke Senior in exile.\n\nLater Duke Frederick banishes his niece Rosalind (Bryce Dallas Howard), resulting in a rift with his daughter Celia (Romola Garai), who runs away with her cousin (one of the few times a family connection is nurturing in a Branagh film). Once in the Forest of Arden, Rosalind notably avoids making any effort to join up with her father, and instead finds a new company of friends among the shepherds.\n\nThe Forest of Arden represents a place of escape from the horrors of court life. Life in the town is a dangerous place, and the film starts on a dark note with Duke Frederick’s ninjas murdering Duke Senior’s guards as he takes over the area.\n\nThese tensions disappear after the action moves into the Forest of Arden. Everything is muted in this idyllic setting. There is conflict in the town. There is only peace in the country. People were miserable and frightened in the town, but here they are contented and happy. Political and murderous plots have been replaced by romantic intrigues and stratagems. Duke Frederick and Oliver set off for Arden with violent intentions, but these urges soon disappear amidst the tranquillity of the woods, and swords are turned to ploughshares.\n\nI have seen the film criticised for its failure to play up the farcical elements and add a little more pace to the comedy. However I think that Branagh has understood the nature of Shakespeare’s play better than his critics. This is a softer pastoral work, and that is the effect that Branagh goes for. Arden is a place for idle pleasures where the characters re-charge before returning to their urban responsibilities.\n\nWhile I have said that Branagh is often too stagey, he does have some cinematic sensibilities. This is not always for the best. Sometimes the camera’s constant tracking and circling of the characters can dissipate the effects of Shakespeare’s best speeches. We are not allowed to concentrate on the actor delivering the words, for example during Duke Senior’s “Sermon’s in stones and goodness in everything” speech, or the famous oration by the courtier Jaques (Kevin Kline), “All the world’s a stage…”\n\nHowever these wide shots have a very soothing effect. Branagh takes full advantage of the beautiful landscape to lend the film a softer touch, enhanced by the gentle music score with its solo violin playing high notes.\n\nCritics offer absurdly sombre interpretations of As You Like It, concentrating on the cynicism of the clown Touchstone (Alfred Molina), the melancholy of Jaques, and the grim view of the capricious nature of love that Rosalind teaches Orlando during their courtship.\n\nBranagh plays down these elements. He recognises the essential comedy of these scenes, and refuses to take them more seriously than Shakespeare intended. Branagh’s Touchstone is a bawdy joker. Jaques’ sour words are a mere affectation to be laughed at. Rosalind and Orlando are having fun, and not offering us any real glimpse of their future life together.\n\nBranagh is also able to convey a number of elements in a purely visual manner that does not exist in Shakespeare’s text. Touchstone uncovers the fact that the shepherd Corin (Jimmy Yuill) is an ex-courtier who fled the town too, and who is scared of being found out. While Duke Senior and Rosalind do not address each other until the end of the story, there is a moving moment where she spies on her father while still disguised as a man, and he half-recognises her. Duke Senior betrays guilt when the vegetarian Jaques expresses his distress at the killing of the local animals committed by the Duke and his men.\n\nDuring the credits, Branagh breaks the illusion of the story altogether and shows Bryce Dallas Howard walking to her dressing trailer while she delivers the play’s epilogue. It is one final reminder that what we have seen is illusion.\n\nAs You Like It may be flawed, but somehow the flaws do not matter. Whatever Branagh’s misjudgements, his film conveys the feel and tone of Shakespeare’s play better than anyone else has so far done on screen."
