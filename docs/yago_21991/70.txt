Film Background

Director Kenneth Branagh recreates Mozart’s classic opera in this colourful adaption of The Magic Flute. The story has been moved to the World War I trenches, where the peace-loving Tamino is lost in no man’s land and rescued by three mischievous nurses. They take him to see the Queen of the Night, who asks him to rescue her daughter Pamina from her kidnapper, the nefarious Sarastro. As Tamino leaves, he is given a magical flute and is accompanied by the lovelorn bird-catcher Papageno. But when they arrive at Sarastro’s castle, they hear a different side of the story.
