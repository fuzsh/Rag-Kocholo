        "text": "Some movies are meant to be consumed. Some movies are meant to be experienced. And, some movies are meant to be inhabited and worn, like a suit of old, but still good, clothes.\n\nTHE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD falls into the latter category. Though it is too long, it is a riveting, simmering character study of the famous western outlaw and the men who rode with him in his late career, including Bob Ford, the young man who shot Jesse in the back.\n\nThe movie opens in 1881 with Jesse James and his brother Frank in the Missouri woods planning their last train robbery with their new gang. Jesse and Frank’s old gang with the Younger brothers have either been killed or put into jail.\n\nBob Ford is the younger brother of Charley. He tries to ingratiate himself with Jesse’s own brother, but Frank just insults him. Jesse, however, is amused by Bob’s enthusiasm, though he doesn’t think he’s ready to become a ruthless outlaw like the older men.\n\nThe robbery goes off without much of a hitch, though Jesse kills one of the men guarding the mail car. The robbery just angers the state authorities, especially the new Republican governor who hates Confederate rebels like the James gang. They put renewed pressure to capture or, preferably, kill Jesse James and his gang.\n\nIn the wake of this, Jesse’s brother Frank heads back East, but Jesse becomes paranoid and moody. He starts showing up at the farms and hideouts of the rest of the gang and even shoots one of them dead in the back. Meanwhile, Bob Ford kills Jesse’s cousin, Wood Hite, when Wood comes after Dick Liddel for messing with his elderly father’s much younger wife. Bob and his brother, Charley, secretly bury Wood’s body to hide their deed from Jesse.\n\nBob eventually decides that it’s going to be either him or Jesse, so he conspires with the police and the Governor to kill Jesse. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe acting in THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is among the best this year. Both Brad Pitt as Jesse James and Casey Affleck as Bob Ford are brilliant. Affleck is especially good at expressing what he’s feeling through his eyes as he watches the moody, suspicious, often inscrutable Jesse. Sam Rockwell is also superb as Bob’s brother Charley, as is Paul Schneider as Dick Liddel and Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller.\n\nSome critics have complained about the length and pacing of this movie. Although the movie definitely could be trimmed to make it more accessible to the average moviegoer, it rivets the attention (unless, of course, you don’t care about the subject).\n\nOnly God knows the whole truth about Jesse James and Bob Ford. Their story has been the stuff of much speculation. That said, although the Yankee authorities during the Civil War and afterwards (including Allan Pinkerton, the founder of the Pinkerton Detective Agency) often mistreated Confederate sympathizers and former soldiers like Jesse James and his family, which intensified Jesse’s animosity toward them, Jesse ruthlessly murdered people in cold blood during his criminal career, including one of the men in the second gang that he and his brother led at the end. It is also apparently true, however, that Jesse could be generous to other people who were suffering or needed a buck. Finally, it is also apparently true that, during all his train robberies, Jesse only twice stole money from train passengers. These last facts contributed to Jesse’s reputation, especially in the South, of being a newfangled Robin Hood harassing the Yankee “oppressors” and carpet baggers.\n\nBe that as it may, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is a compelling, fascinating, gripping portrayal of Bob and Charley Ford’s relationship with Jesse James. At one point, Jesse tells Bob, “I can’t figure it out. Do you want to be like me or do you want to be me?” This is one of the movie’s major themes, how Bob’s idolization of Jesse and Jesse’s fame turned into fear, loathing and jealousy. Bob’s brother Charley watches this transformation mostly from the sidelines. In fact, he often nervously tries to make jokes to cut the tension between Jesse and Bob when Bob’s intensity shines through his demeanor.\n\nIn portraying these events and their aftermath, the movie says that Bob’s desire for fame and celebrity in his own right does not turn out as he imagines it. Instead of being treated like a hero, he is treated like a coward and a traitor. Thus, the movie strongly suggests that Bob’s story holds a valuable lesson for those who also desperately seek fame and fortune – be careful what you wish for.\n\nTHE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES also is a story about dishonor among thieves. Thus, a paranoid Jesse James shoots one of his gang members in the back, and a paranoid Bob Ford shoots Jesse James in the back.\n\nAll in all, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is a dark psychological portrayal of historical events. It is not an uplifting movie with a strong Christian worldview, but it offers some fascinating insights into well-known, controversial figures from America’s history. It is not the final word on the subject, but it is an interesting one that deserves some major attention.\n\nThe movie also contains some very strong western violence, foul language and brief sexual references, so extreme caution is advised."
