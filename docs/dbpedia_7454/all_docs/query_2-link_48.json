        "text": "ROBERT FORD (Artistic Director) is co-founder of T2, where he has helped produce over 65 plays and musicals and facilitated 50 development projects through the Arkansas New Play Festival. He has written nine full-length plays, including his first, Tierra del Fuego, which won the Stanley Drama Award, following development at the former Mount Sequoyah New Play Retreat in Fayetteville. Most recently T2 premiered his adaptation of Great Expectations. Past seasons have included Fault (T2), The Spiritualist (T2, New Harmony Project, Stages Rep in Houston, where the Houston Press called the play “at once riotously funny, musically engaging, and sweetly complex”), The Fall of the House (T2, Alabama Shakespeare Festival — Edgar Award nominee), Look Away (T2, Southern Writers Project), Girl Band in the Men’s Room (Hollywood Fringe—Best Theatre Award), and ‘Twas the Night (T2, published by Playscripts). His play My Father’s War has appeared in the US, UK, Italy, and Germany. For T2 he directed Drawer Boy and his own adaptation of It’s a Wonderful Life. His critically acclaimed first novel, The Student Conductor, was a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers pick and a “Hidden Gem” on NPR’s Morning Edition. A professional musician, he has performed as a flutist with SONA in Northwest Arkansas. He holds a Master of Music degree from Yale and MFAs in acting from Rutgers and in playwriting & screenwriting from the Michener Center for Writers, University of Texas at Austin."
