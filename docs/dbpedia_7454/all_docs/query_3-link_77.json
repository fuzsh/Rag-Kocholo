        "text": "I used to watch westerns as a kid. My father liked them, I think. They'd appear on TV in the middle of the day, imports from America, full of American stars from a fading era. My mother, for her part, liked Elvis' films, and would watch those. Occasionally the two would overlap, but I don't think either liked it when they did.\n\n***\n\nRon Hansen's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is not like anything from my childhood. In 2007 Andrew Dominik, the Australian director who made Chopper and Killing Them Softly, made it into a film. Like all three of his films, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a fine piece, though it is rumoured to have been plagued by studio problems. Most notably, those problems surrounded the final cut. Dominik's original cut was four hours long and the studio wanted a short, more action driven piece. One suspects that they also wanted to change the title as well, though Brad Pitt, who played Jesse James in the film, had it in his contract that it couldn't be, thankfully. The final length of the film is two hours and forty minutes and it's a dark, moody piece about fame and history. I wouldn't mind seeing the four hour version, but that's mostly because I've liked Dominik's other films, and not because I think it needs four hours. But, at any rate, I'm not talking about the film today. I'm talking about the book. It was released in 1983 and it, like the film made years later, is a dark, moody piece as well.\n\n***\n\nThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford bills itself as a western, but it's probably best to view it as a historical novel, or a literary historical slash western novel, than a western in and of itself. There is a train robbery - it is one of the first things to happen in the book - and there are a few gunfights, but none of them are particularly daring, or staged in an overly dramatic fashion. It is not that any of that is badly done, as none of it is, but rather that Hansen is simply not interested in that aspect of the story. Instead, he's interested in the characters of the people who haunted the late 19th Century. Jesse James, Bob Ford, Zee James, Charley Ford, Dick Liddil, and others, including James' mother and brother, fill out the book. It's both the biggest strength and biggest flaw in the work, in my opinion. The character that Hansen presents to you for Jesse James, a man who didn't rob from the rich to give to the poor, but to himself, and who was superstitious, fascinated by herbal remedies, paranoid, and managed to capture a part of the public's imagination, is fascinating. Unfortunately, it's also a better portrayal than anyone else in the book. Bob Ford manages to hold his own for large parts, and Zee James is particularly interesting for her ability to compartmentalise her life around her husband's, for her ability to ignore the crimes he commits and the killings he is responsible for. But a lot of the other characters are often reduced to nervous dispositions, birth defects, or in the case of Jesse James' mother, a missing hand and a loud voice. There's not a lot to them, sadly, and you're pleased when Hansen leaves them, and returns to Jesse James.\n\n***\n\nThe book itself is a study of fame and desire. It concerns itself with the desire to be famous and the weight of that fame. Robert Ford meets Jesse James at the train robbery that begins the novel, a young man not yet twenty who is enamoured with James' myth. He has read about him in dime novels, grown up with stories of him, and wants to be like him. Later in the book, after he has agreed to kill Jesse James, he tells one of the marshals that this is his only chance to become someone, to be famous, and to not become lost and unknown in history. He expects to be hailed as a hero after he kills James, but either because he shoots him in the back unarmed, or because he is so clearly trying to profit from the murder, the fame he gets dogs him through the country until he himself is shot in the back at the age of thirty. This forms the thematic spine of the book, you could say, and allows the novel to unfold its analysis of fame through the narrative. Other examples of it are Jesse James' aliases. He has so many that his children don't know his real name. His son, named after him, is called Tim throughout his childhood. James is forced to move with his family repeatedly. At one point, shortly before his death, his wife Zee tells Robert Ford about the hardship of having to move, of never being able to put down roots. Ford ignores the comment, but he himself follows a similar pattern. He is always moving. He is always being forced out, until he is shot dead.\n\n***\n\nYet, for all that the book is a study on fame, the biggest attraction of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is Hansen himself. His command of language, his sentences, and his ability to draw you into the characters that he is talking about - even when they are little more than ailments - is worth admission to the book alone.\n\nI liked the way he wrote the book so much, in fact, that I pulled three quotes out to put here, just to show what I am talking about.\n\n***\n\nJesse was increasingly cavalier, merry, moody, fey, unpredictable. If his gross anatomy suggested a strong smith in his twenties, his actual physical constitution was that of a man who was incrementally dying. He was sick with rheums and aches and lung congestions, he tilted against chairs and counters and walls, in cold weather he limped with a cane. He coughed incessantly when lying down, his clever mind was often in conflict, insomnia stained his eye sockets like soot, he seemed in a state of mourning. He counteracted the smell of neglected teeth with licorice and candies, he browned his graying hair with dye, he camouflaged his depressions and derangements with masquerades of extreme cordiality, courtesy, and good will toward others.\n\n***\n\nFor the man was canny, he was intuitive, he anticipated everything. He continually looked over his shoulders, he looked into the background with mirrors, he locked his sleeping room at night, he could pick out a whisper in the wind, he could register the slightest added value a man put into his words, he could probably read the faltering and perfidy in Bob's face. He once numbered the spades on a playing card that skittered across the street a city block away; he licked his daughter's cut finger and there wasn't even a scar the next day; he wrestled with his son and the two Fords at once one afternoon and rarely even tilted - it was like grappling with a tree. When Jesse predicted rain, it rained; when he encouraged plants, they grew; when he scorned animals, they retreated; whomever he wanted to stir, he astonished.\n\n***\n\nThis is my favourite of the three. It comes from the end of the book, after Jesse James is dead, and Robert Ford is describing him to a young woman.\n\nHe said, “He was bigger than you can imagine, and he couldn’t get enough to eat. He was hungry all the time. He ate all the food in the dining room and then he ate all the plates and the glasses and the light off the candles; he ate all the air in your lungs and the thoughts right out of your mind. You’d go to him, wanting to be with him, wanting to be like him, and you’d always come away missing something.” Bob looked at the girl with anger and of course she was looking peculiarly at him. He said, “So now you know why I shot him.”\n\n***\n\nHowever, Hansen doesn't sustain this for the entire book. His writing never becomes bad, don't get me wrong, but in the middle of the book, when the story circles the Fords and James' cousin, Wood Hite, it sags, as if he isn't particularly interested in it. The Hite part of the story is actually quite important - Hite's death at the hand of Ford and the fear that James will exact revenge of him and others for it, lead Ford to entering a deal with the government to capture or kill Jesse James. But you don't ever much care about Hite, or the Ford family, and you find yourself wanting to get back to James, where the book is clearly at its strongest. And, of course, it does. Fortunately, when that passes, Jesse James has begun to make a new plan to rob a bank, and enlists both Charley and Robert Ford to help him. From there on, it's only a matter of time until James is murdered.\n\n***\n\nThe last third of the book deals with the aftermath of Jesse James' death. Unlike the earlier section of the book, the Wood Hite part, Hansen doesn't let The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford lag. Here, Hansen's investigation into fame reaches its height, and his interest (or at least my perceived interest in) what's happening sharpens his narrative. Hansen tells how people start to steal from James' house after they learn of his death, taking pieces of bloody carpet, floorboard, anything to sell as a souvenir. His neighbours write books about him. They become best sellers. Bob and Charley Ford join a theatre company and go about the country reenacting the death of Jesse James to audiences for a price. Zee James ends up in poverty, living on the kindness of her family, and Robert James surrenders to a governor. Hansen works his way through all the people who were involved in the murder of Jesse James, and those who were his family, showing how each has their life touched by his death. Elected officials involved in the plan to kill Jesse James become tainted by it and lose office. James' mother sells tours through her house. Charley Ford becomes consumed by remorse and morphine and writes letters to Zee James that he never sends, begging for her forgiveness. And Bob... well, Bob is eventually shot in the back by a man who would later be pardoned for the crime.\n\n***"
