The collaboration then developed into a major pan-European effort, which resulted in a successful bid to develop and field a new module of questions on the European Social Survey. These data were collected in 2015, and first results will be presented at a major international conference in 2016, funded by the British Academy following a further successful grant application by the lead collaborators, Ford and Heath, and has culminated in the production of a peer reviewed special issue in the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, due to appear in 2019.\n\nAnti-prejudice social norms - collaboration with Elisabeth Ivarsflaten (Bergen) and Scott Blinder (University of Massachusetts, Amherst ) (2007-date)\n\nThis major international research collaboration and long running international collaboration has developed, tested and analysed a major new theoretical concept in political research, anti-prejudice social norms. Work on this topic has yielded a large store of innovative survey data, three journal articles, including the recent high profile publication in the American Journal of Political Science, which in turn attracted the attention of Professor Paul Sniderman and helped launch the collaborative work with him on minority integration .\n\nThe Welfare State Under Strain - collaboration with Marcel Coenders and Menno Van Setten (Netherlands) and Anouk Kootstra (Manchester) (2011-date)\n\nThis ongoing international collaboration began with a British Academy small grant to pilot new survey experimental measures, and Dutch funding to replicate the survey in the Netherlands, followed by a large Open Research Area grant co-funded by ESRC and NWO (Netherlands) The grant has been used to develop and implement a major new panel survey in Britain and the Netherlands examining evolving attitudes to the welfare state, with the recruitment of two PhD students to work full time on the project (Van Setten and Kootstra). The team have produced numerous journal articles to date from this material and a book proposal will be submitted next year.\n\nUnderstanding the polls - collaboration with Christopher Wlezien (University of Texas, Austin), Mark Pickup (University of Vancouver), Will Jennings (University of Southampton) and Stephen Fisher (University of Oxford)\n\nAn international collaboration to develop new methods to aggregate and analyse polling data, to forecast elections based on these data, and to inform public debate on opinion polling via innovative data visualisation and knowledge exchange. The team produced four journal articles and a high profile blogging project which has received sustained national media attention, and our data has been used by the Electoral Commission."
