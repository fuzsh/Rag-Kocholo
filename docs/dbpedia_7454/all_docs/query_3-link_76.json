        "text": "By Sam Mooney\n\nStill Your Friend’s production of The Assassination of Robert Ford: Dirty Little Coward premiered tonight at Theatre Passe Muraille Mainspace as part of the Toronto Fringe. It’s terrific. I predict that it’s going to be one of the hot tickets of this year’s Fringe so don’t delay. Buy your tickets now!\n\nFirst things first – this isn’t a show about the mayor of Toronto. The Robert Ford in the title is the man who killed Jesse James. You probably recognize “dirty little coward” from the folk song Jesse James. The show is the story of Ed O’Kelley, the man who killed Ford.\n\nAdam Bailey wrote and directed the show and did both brilliantly. The script is smart, witty, and funny. The pacing of the show was perfect. The show is funny but not really a comedy; there are songs but it isn’t a musical; there are serious moments but sometimes it felt like a melodrama – in a good way.\n\nJoel Lightman composed the music, and played the piano; he was playing ragtime before the show started and it was lovely. He showed great comic timing playing Robert Ford. He was good in the fight scene too. A renaissance man.\n\nGeoff Mays as Ed O’Kelley played a man whose life didn’t work out the way he thought it would. There was suppressed anger as he told his story. I have no idea what a Missouri accent sounds like but Mays’ accent sounded like it could be Missourian and it never wavered.\n\nTyler Seguin was The Host, a dapper man. He was lovely, very appealing with his southern accent and his fancy hat.\n\nThe cast all seemed very comfortable in their roles.\n\nThe Assassination of Robert Ford is a seriously good production. I loved it.\n\nMooney on Theatre Staff Picks – 2014 Toronto Fringe Festival\n\nLogan Brown highly recommends The Assassination of Robert Ford: Dirty Little Coward. Comedy, drama, and music bring this fantastic show to life. The cast deliver excellent performances, and the atmosphere created in the Theatre Passe Muraille Mainspace takes you to another time and place. And the fact that the story is based on real-life events makes for one entertaining history lesson. This multilayered show has something for everyone. A must see.\n\nSam Mooney thinks everyone should see The Assassination of Robert Ford: Dirty Little Coward. It’s a perfect 60-minute play. The script is smart, witty, and funny. The direction is spot on, and the talented cast is perfect. There’s great original music, some superior stage fighting, and some spectacular dying. She’s overheard people say that they aren’t going to see it because they’re so tired of hearing about Rob Ford. It’s not that Rob Ford! It’s safe to go and see it.\n\nNOW\n\nReview By Jordan Bimm NOW Rating: NNN"
