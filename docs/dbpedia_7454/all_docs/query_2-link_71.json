Three years later in 2001, he opened a private practice in Sarasota, and in 2007 he was appointed Medical Director for Rx Weight Loss in Sarasota.\n\nHis dedication to providing the best possible care for his patients and his passion for helping his patients live happy and healthy lives is what drives Dr. Ford to excel in his profession.\n\nDr. Ford maintains his private practice so he can ensure every family member can be taken care of, from children to grandparents. He cares for every generation with an attentive and caring manner.\n\nDr. Ford takes the time to discuss with his patients any problems or concerns they may have and helps them to fully understand any treatments or procedures they are about to experience.\n\nWhen you are in Dr. Robert Fords office, you will never be treated like just another number, and his staff does their best to shorten if not nearly eliminate waiting room time."
