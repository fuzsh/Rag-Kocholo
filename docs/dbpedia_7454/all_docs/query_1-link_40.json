        "text": "Nelly\n\nWe buried you on the hottest day for years.\n\nNo breeze. The cornstalks were silent,\n\nthe air seething in crowded spaces under\n\na sky wiped duck-egg blue at the edges.\n\nThrough the heavy substance of veteran oaks,\n\nsycamores, gasping over the hedgerows,\n\nyou could see all the way down the lazy apron\n\nof the river valley to our town, the thumb of\n\nits church steeple gilt-framed by the haze.\n\nIt seemed apt. A decade later, it’s still how\n\nI picture you – though I’m no more than an\n\nunopened parcel of memories in your future\n\n—a girl, each thin-ice step you take a question,\n\nleaving behind farm, family, village, home.\n\nA whole lifetime waiting for you down there,\n\nwaiting to gather you up into its embrace.\n\nby Robert Ford\n\nEditor’s Note: Grief often defies description, but poets keep trying. This poem’s intense imagery presents yet another facet of sorrow, embedded in present, past, and future."
