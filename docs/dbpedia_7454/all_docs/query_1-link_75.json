        "text": "Over the last few years, writing poetry has been my primary creative outlet, but that wasn’t always the case. There was a time when I focused more on writing short stories, with dreams of seeing them published in prestigious magazines like GQ, The Atlantic, and Granta. This was back when I was running The Final Carrot, an online writing group I founded in the late 90s. I’d set weekly writing assignments, with submissions being posted online. One of the goals was to create a nurturing environment for growth and creativity, so members were encouraged to provide both supportive feedback and…\n\nAs I’ve been cleaning up and categorizing my written work (poetry, short stories, personal histories, and assorted essays), I sometimes come across something that I want to brush the dust off, and share more widely. One technique that I’ve successfully used to overcome writer’s block is to open up a favorite book at a random page, and use the last full sentence at the bottom of the page as a jumping off point for a short story or poem. A variant of that has been to use a snippet of song lyrics, and I think that this is where this…\n\nAs I diligently try to get my arms around 45 years’ worth of my poetry in readiness for publishing my ‘Love & Loss’ collection, I come across long-forgotten poems that seem to be screaming, “Pick me!” This is one of those poems. I don’t remember when I wrote it, but I have a feeling that it wasn’t based on any one specific personal experience. Always a voracious reader and avid movie fan, the romantic in me would often be hooked by the turn of a phrase or a specific scene, and I’d want to take it and make it my…\n\nIf I look back to the ten years from 1969 when Neil Armstrong became the first man to actually walk on the moon, to 1979 when Sting just sang about it, I guess that those two extremes (astronaut and rock star) covered my pre-corporate dweeb career aspirations. July 20th, 1969 was a big day for me. No, not because of the moon landing (at least not to begin with). The reason for my excitement was that it was the first day of our family vacation and instead of spending it with my aunt and her family in Rhyl, we were…\n\nAt the weekend, I was among a large group that came together to celebrate the life of a close friend who passed ten years ago. I’d first met Ian when we were both 18, and we were both freshly-minted students at Wolverhampton Polytechnic. He was one of those people that fully embraced his quirkiness, and we all loved him for it. Yesterday, I spent much of the day reflecting on the weekend, and this poem decided to make an appearance. While it was always clear just how much we all loved each other, the actual words would go unspoken. That…\n\nWhen I moved to the US in 1995, I naively thought of myself as a bold adventurer, the first in my family to venture overseas. When DNA testing became a thing, I very quickly realized that I have a lot of distant cousins here. Back then, the tools to help you join the dots and determine the who, how, and why distant relatives had made the journey across the Atlantic didn’t really exist, but I’m happy to report that that is starting to change Every 12-18 months, I find myself diving deep into genealogy… a bit too deep sometimes, as…\n\nLast week, four months of hard work came to life with Camp Sacred City, a “magical place co-created by humans freely sharing their authentic gifts” taking place at Wonderfield Farm & Retreat in Floral City, Florida. For the almost two hundred people who heeded the call, it truly was a magical experience, and reinforced what a community is capable of, once we’ve set our minds to something. RECLAMATION Breathing in nature’s calming sighExhaling expectationsReleasing inhibitions and self-doubtsInhale… Exhale… Inhale… Exhale…Reconnecting to ancient rhythms withinRemembering who we truly areReturning home to Gaia’s embrace Feet firmly planted on sacred soilWe relinquish controlShedding…\n\nForty-four years ago, I almost got thrown off my degree course. It was March 1980, I’d just turned 19, and I was in my first year at Wolverhampton Polytechnic. The previous summer, I hadn’t got the required A-level grades to go to any of the Universities that had given me offers, nor where they good enough to get on the ‘insurance policy’ Computer Science degree course at Wolves, but they’d offered me a place on their Combined Studies course instead, which I’d accepted. Wolves Polytechnic had a pretty advanced computer environment for the time, with distributed groups of terminals spread…\n\nCrafting and communicating personal boundaries in a relationship is a crucial aspect of maintaining your own well-being and ensuring mutual respect with your partner. It involves a delicate balance of self-awareness, assertiveness, and empathy. As you embark on this journey of asserting your needs and limits, remember that this process is not just about drawing lines, but also about building bridges of understanding and respect between you and your partner. The following steps are designed to guide you through preparing and conducting a conversation about your boundaries. They aim to empower you to express yourself clearly and confidently, while also…\n\nI wrote this poem about a month ago, but decided to hold off on posting it until International Women’s Day, which is today (March 8th, 2023). I wrote it at the encouragement of my dear friend Sharon Hake, as a submission for an upcoming book from Great Dames, which is the nonprofit organization that she co-founded with her daughter, and where I serve on the Board. Great Dames is a dynamic, diverse community of women who are connected, empowered and inspired to create the impact they desire. In seeking submissions for the book, Great Dames were invited to share their…"
