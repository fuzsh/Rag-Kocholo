        "text": "Those dream-filled summer nights,\n\na wail, anguished as a banshee,\n\npierced the rusty screen.\n\nThen the rhythmic clatter grew\n\nuntil the bed and I would tremble.\n\nLet me come too, I whispered,\n\nbut it never heard,\n\nor didn’t understand,\n\nor didn’t care about a little girl\n\nand a gallant torn-eared bear.\n\nThe rumbling, shaking wraith\n\nmoved on, its cry waning to an echo,\n\nmy heartbeat clinging to the cadence\n\nof away from here, away from\n\nhere, away\n\n– Sarah Russell\n\nFirst published in Black Poppy Review\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFew of us can capture a child’s reticence and awe like Robert Ford has in this poem about a kindergarten encounter. You can find more great poems and learn more about this poet who lives in Scotland on his blog, Weezlehead.\n\nIt wasn’t quite my first day there, and while I sat at the safety\n\nof a long wooden table, a mile-wide belt of asteroid children\n\nfizzed about the hall, high on screams and random collisions,\n\npounding its feet on a sprung floor all glassy with new varnish.\n\nHer long-fingered hands were working the grown-up scissors,\n\nthe chafing of the blades against each other making that noise\n\nI still don’t know the word for. You’re very patient, she told me,\n\nfreeing me from my cosmic reveries like one of the starfish\n\nshe was busily fashioning from a stack of coloured card.\n\n– Robert Ford\n\nFirst published in Red Eft Review\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI love this poem not only for the humanity it shows, but also for its many layers of meaning. Deborah Paradez teaches at Columbia University. You can read more about her and more of her poetry here.\n\nAll morning my daughter pleading, outside\n\noutside. By noon I kneel to button her\n\ncoat, tie the scarf to keep her hood in place.\n\nThis is her first snow so she strains against\n\nthe ritual, spooked silent then whining,\n\nrestless under each buffeting layer,\n\nuncertain how to settle into this\n\nleashing. I manage at last to tunnel\n\nher hands into mittens and she barks and\n\nwon’t stop barking, her hands suddenly paws.\n\nShe is reduced to another being,\n\nbarking, barking all day in these restraints.\n\nFor days after, she howls into her hands,\n\nthe only way she tells me she wants out.\n\n– Deborah Paredez\n\nFirst published in Poetry Magazine\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
