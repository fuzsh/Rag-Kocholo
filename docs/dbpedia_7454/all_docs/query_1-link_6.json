        "text": "Naughty Boy\n\nYou’ll know when he’s back on the whisky,\n\nbecause the taxi comes all the way out\n\nfrom the town carrying the bottles, on the days\n\nwhen the postman brings his cheque.\n\nYou’ll see it bump back down the muddied road\n\nfrom the far end of the glen, to where the shell\n\nof the family house huddles in its broken square\n\nof unmown meadow, wire and pebbles.\n\nHis skinny dogs – the bearded collie\n\nand the mongrel – chase its spinning tyres,\n\ntheir sharp rasps spilling over the hillside\n\nlike too much water over a bath rim.\n\nHis muted, rheumy eyes gaze through them\n\nand the lowered window, and for just a moment\n\nhe’s all his accumulated ages at once, and then\n\nthe man he is, older than his whispered years.\n\nAnd when you finally call by at the house –\n\nthe days it’s taken him to drink it all having passed –\n\nhe’ll stand there sheepish by the missing front door,\n\nand tell you how he’s been a naughty boy.\n\nGhoster\n\nNo clean hand waved a child off to our school.\n\nThe dads of all the kids I knew did filthy jobs,\n\nand mine worked ghosters at the power plant,\n\ncruel shifts pressing deep into the small, dark hours.\n\nOn his return, a poltergeist crashed into the backyard\n\nbeneath my bedroom window, like a coal train\n\nhammering the tracks of a deserted station,\n\nsomewhere off in the full stop of an empty night.\n\nMore than once, his aching, splintered hand\n\npushed right through the thin panes of the door,\n\nhaving expected – for some reason – to find it open.\n\nI fell asleep again to the careful crunch of his footsteps,\n\nand in the morning, a black sheet held on by tape\n\nsealed the broken spaces, the glass all spirited away.\n\nSandsend\n\nThe sun will flee again soon, following its divine angle,\n\nto fall beyond the hill, before the cool flow of night arrives.\n\nThe last car will leave the village and argue its way back up the road,\n\nits driver tapping out a rhythm of fidgets on the steering wheel,\n\nand all that will linger is the clong, clong, of the bell around the neck\n\nof a goat, beckoning to its partner in the darkness,\n\nand the slow, slow clap of the waves, studded with pebbles,\n\none by one, eating into the rounded belly of the bay."
