        "text": "A wobbly left and a wary right could cut the Labour vote with low turnout\n\nLabour may currently have a commanding lead, but a second lacklustre half to the campaign could lead some voters to stay at home, writes political scientist Robert Ford\n\n16 Jun 2024 08.00 CEST\n\nRishi Sunak’s chances were always slim. And the numbers just get worse\n\nPolls show longstanding Tory advantages on issues such as immigration, crime and defence are gone, while Labour opens new leads in traditional areas\n\n8 Jun 2024 18.54 CEST\n\nLow-profile Lib Dems are flatlining in the polls – but don’t write them off\n\nReform UK is making the headlines but tactical voting can power Ed Davey’s party in seats where they are the Tories’ main challengers\n\n17 Mar 2024 09.00 CET\n\nLabour’s stunning Scottish byelection win means there may be little need to bargain with the SNP\n\nA decade of SNP dominance will be swept away in Scotland if Labour can repeat its Rutherglen success\n\n7 Oct 2023 16.10 CEST\n\nYes, the Tories kept Uxbridge. But the general election will be a referendum on Sunak, not Ulez\n\nWith a local dispute swaying voters, the result in Boris Johnson’s old seat did not accurately reflect the national mood\n\n22 Jul 2023 16.58 CEST\n\nThis election bloodbath was bad enough for the Tories – tactical voting could make it far worse\n\nLabour is bridging the Brexit gap but is not yet poised to win a general election. One thing could change that…\n\n6 May 2023 17.25 CEST\n\nLocal election scenarios: what would a good result look like for each party?\n\nHow to interpret the outcome of what could be a pivotal night for both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer\n\n3 May 2023 18.00 CEST"
