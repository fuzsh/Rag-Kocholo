        "text": "Robert Ford, MD\n\nDr. Robert Ford joined Primary Pediatrics in 2009 and serves as a primary care pediatrician in our Warner Robins office.\n\nDr. Ford is originally from Leesburg, Georgia and graduated with high honors from Georgia Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. He later graduated from Mercer University School of Medicine.\n\nHe’s married to Dr. Jessica Ford and they have three children, Katie, James, and John Arthur. They feel truly blessed to realize their dream of working as pediatricians in the same office. Being both parents and pediatricians, Robert and Jessie are learning daily how to be better parents and how to convey the importance of parenting with love and leadership to their patient’s families, as well.\n\nDr. Ford recommends reading parenting books by Dr. James Dobson and Dr. John Rosemond. He enjoys spending time with his family and friends while duck, deer, and turkey hunting. Dr. Ford trained his chocolate lab Boone who is also a big part (90lbs!) of the family in both the home and the duck blind. The Ford family attends Ingleside Baptist Church and believe in Proverbs 22:6 which says, “Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.”"
