        "text": "Robert Neil (Bob) Ford passed away at his home in Bluffdale, Utah, on July 7, 2024. Bob was born on February 2, 1952, to Neil Ford and Joann Burch. He was born to be big brother to his sister and four brothers. Raised in Wallsburg, Utah, he and his brothers happily did boy things and watched out for their sister. He attended school in Wallsburg and Heber, Utah. After graduating from high school, he continued his education and earned a welding degree from Utah Technical College of Provo. In 1971 two significant life events continued to shape the man he was becoming; he married Janet Mecham, August 14, 1971, and was drafted into military service where among other life shaping experiences he excelled in marksmanship. He and Janet were blessed with two children, son Christon and daughter Becky. Being a dad and poppa were two of his most precious callings in life.\n\nAfter military service he worked at a recapping tire company and then Geneva Steel. Bob was respected for being very dependable, organized, honest, and a diligent worker. After Geneva Steel closed, he secured work with Savage Brothers. Later in his career he worked with a company that placed him at Kennecott Copper Mine and later at Big West Oil LLC, where he remained until his retirement.\n\nOn September 30, 1988, he married Melanie Henline; they were later sealed in the Oquirrh Mountain Temple. He and Melanie enjoyed camping trips to favorite places in the mountains which were made especially meaningful and fun when they took Sawyer with them. Together, he and Melanie took on the blessed calling of raising their granddaughter Sawyer Poole. When Melanie succumbed to cancer Bob took over raising Sawyer full-time by himself, which like everything else, he excelled at. Sawyer had his full love and attention, he helped her with schoolwork, took her to activities, made sure she always had what she needed. He was even Sawyer's class \"room mother\" at school. Bob was everything kind and good, he was a loved Primary teacher, friend, neighbor, son, brother, father, and poppa. He didn't back down from hard work. When Melanie became sick, he took tender, loving care of her up to her last earthly breath.\n\nBob was a horseman and loved dogs, big and itty bitty. He kept a nice yard with green grass that was the envy of many. He was the first person to offer his help when someone needed it including making full meals for friends, helping families move, stacking hay, whatever was needed. He had an endearing sense of humor accompanied by his unique smile and laughter. He will be deeply missed by so many, family and friends.\n\nBob is preceded in death by a grandson Christon Nicholas, wife Melanie, and his father Neil. He is survived by his loving mother, Joann of Wallsburg Utah. Children, Christon Ford, Pleasant Grove and Becky Wiley, Orem Utah, six beloved grandchildren; Casey, Colton, Caden, Chloe, Holly, and Sawyer. His sister, JoNeil (Montana), brothers all living in Utah, Boyd, Lake Shore, Grant, Fruitland, Don (Launie), Charleston, and Paul, Wallsburg.\n\nBob will be honored at a graveside service Monday, July 15, 2024, at 11:00 AM at the Wallsburg Town Cemetery, 100 East 200 North, Wallsburg, Utah and interred next to his dear wife, Melanie."
