        "text": "by: Robert Ford\n\nIn these ekphrastic poems by Robert Ford, perception is a type of communion, a transfigured merging of the subject and object into an ontological whole, providing the reader with the necessary sustenance only found in poetry: “…More to feed/ us here than could be/ eaten by a single eye.”\n\nThoughts from an early morning train\n\nStrange how certain things – whilst falling apart –\n\ntake on shapes that almost seem deliberate,\n\nas though planned that way, as though this\n\nwere merely a truer angle to see them from.\n\nA reassembly of ideas. A reversal of mirrors.\n\nSo you become the terrified hare cowering in\n\nthe tractor wheel ruts as the carriage spears by,\n\nnot the owner of the jaded eyes witnessing it.\n\nYou always have been. You see holes now\n\nwhere once there were pegs, an illusion of\n\nopportunity created by yourself, by your own\n\nshadow sweeping across the picture as you pass.\n\nAfternoon, hillside above town\n\nSo the heart must\n\nactually work because I\n\nfeel its hourglass thump,\n\nits rising, gnawing\n\nreassurance under my\n\njawline, the lazy blood\n\nsqueezing through its\n\nchambers. More to feed\n\nus here than could be\n\neaten by a single eye.\n\nBelow, in their paper\n\ncages, the chattering\n\ndrones imagine time\n\nand crush themselves.\n\nAll those things I forgot\n\nI wasn’t thinking become\n\nstatic. They crumble\n\nat my finger-ends.\n\nBookmarked\n\nOnly a single photograph survives out of all the clouds\n\nshe once had of him, from that roughly assembled collage\n\nthat once papered her sky, and filled her up like bones.\n\nThey haven’t met. He’s still unaware of his importance,\n\nof his hands, and what they’ll do one day. He’s almost\n\navoiding the unknown photographer, posing obliquely\n\nlike he’s written in italics, an unnatural tilt to his cupped face.\n\nThe room is an open field, but his eyes are those of a creature\n\nwho knows its limits, one you’d never quite be able to\n\nbring yourself to edit completely. Necessary time has slipped,\n\nleaving new tissue. She sees it now, and has him marking\n\na relevant page, knows exactly where he is for once."
