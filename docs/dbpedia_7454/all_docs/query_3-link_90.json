        "text": "At the beginning of one of this summer’s biggest blockbusters we are treated to maybe the craziest thing anyone will see in theaters this year. Respected actors like Russel Crowe and Michael Shannon are dressed up in super-nuts outfits and barge in on a council meeting of people with silly hats to argue about eugenics. After a quick fight, Crowe jumps on the back of a giant four-winged beast and flies back to his house to witness the birth of his child, the first naturally born and conceived child on his home planet in ages. While all of this is happening, a battle rages outside among a planet that seems to be exploding at all times. It was crazy, it was weird, and I loved it. Man of Steel didn’t end up being a great movie, but it did succeed, at least early on, in doing what too few movies are brave enough to do: trying whole-heartedly to just do something.\n\nAll too often I have a moment of clarity while watching a movie. Most recently, The Purge came to a tipping point, a time when the narrative could go one way or another, and the movie’s success felt like it would live or die based on what the writer and director (the same person in this case but not always) decided would happen. In The Purge, a doorbell rings and the locked down family is brought into the moment, the beginning of the rest of the movie. The identity of that doorbell ringer will shape what kind of film the rest will play out as. Will it be a deeply cynical, biting social commentary where neighbors that smile in your face during the day turn into ruthless, jealous killers at night? Or will the ringer be revealed as just some guy, a less biting, less interesting choice which punts the potential of the film on third and one? Well, unfortunately, it’s the latter. The Purge goes from potentially great to boringly normal. Subpar, even, though that lies more on the lack of skill behind the camera than it does on the premise of the film. The Purge was never going to be a masterpiece given how poorly it was made, but it could have been a messterpiece, a movie which, as its most admirable quality, can claim that at least they were doing something. Trying something, giving it all they’ve got. I appreciate craziness, I appreciate insanity.\n\nA few of my favorite messterpieces include Thirst, which melds uber-violent vampire things with wacky slapstick stuff and one of the silliest, most beautiful endings of the past decade, Synecdoche, New York, a movie that takes about a billion threads and tries to weave some of them into a truly emotional epic and mostly succeeds, and The Night of the Hunter, a mashup of a whole mess of techniques and styles that nonetheless congeals into a moving fairy-tale about growing up and being pure at heart. All of these movies are on my current top 100 list of all time, alongside other messterpeices like The Shining, Magnolia, and Brazil. None of these films lack ambition, though they might not quite reach what they’re grasping for. I will always give the edge to a movie that’s going for something with all of its heart over a movie that plays it safe with any kind of subject matter. This generally will reward genre movies as they often have a bit more leeway in terms of what they can go for and even more leeway as to what the audience will forgive. But serious dramas can go crazy with the best of them. The Lion in Winter doesn’t do a whole lot in the directorial department but the dialogue and the glee with which the actors say their lines is so delightfully over-the-top that I can’t help but fall under its spell of deceit and family politics. Punch-Drunk Love takes the patented Adam Sandler man-child and throws him into the real world where his immaturity helps him fall in love with a girl and endangers his life when a mattress salesman goes bananas at him. The Truman Show has a lot of logistical problems and plot-holes when you think about the situation for a while, but the power of the film and its crazy premise overpowers those nits and becomes something great. Again, all of these films are in my top 100 list. I just love a movie that aims high, even if it doesn’t reach its lofty target.\n\nThere are a few movies in my top 100 that are restrained, content to be the best that they can be. I’d put movies like Days of Heaven and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Raiders of the Lost Ark in that category, all of which might go all out for a scene but generally keep their ambitions close to their vests. It’s perfectly fine to do so. Last year Lincoln was one of my favorite films even though it was pretty much just a straight biography. But movies like The Cabin in the Woods and Cloud Atlas and Holy Motors occupy a greater amount of my thinking about last year’s films, and are the first titles that come to mind over the more staid films of the year. It’s something almost intangible, and I know that there are people out there that just prefer to have their movies be what they are and then be done. But why go to the cinema to see something you can outline in advance? What purpose do movies have if not to surprise us in their stories or their techniques or their ideas about life? Even today’s safest bets, superhero movies, are embracing the absurd. The opening of Man of Steel is just the most recent in a list of superhero films breaking out of the mold and becoming crazy. Thor: The Dark World had a trailer debut today and looks to capitalize on the biggest strength of the previous film, its sense of humor and high drama. Thor was peppered with Shakespearian dialogue and wacky outfits and canted angles and surreal sets. It’s the craziest of Marvel’s movie universe splinters and I can’t wait to see what happens next.\n\nSurprise bonus list! Every year I revise my top movies list and this year I didn’t spend much time on the ordering, outside adding in ten new movies and dropping out ten old movies. The new movies are underlined. Click the movie title if it’s a link for a full review. I decided to not go into the full detail that I did last year, because those are still available for you to peruse at your leisure. I did pick out a new quote for each entry, though, so I hope you still enjoy it. Here we go.\n\n100. Scream\n\n“Sidney, how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered? People want to know. They have a right to know! How does it feel?”\n\n99. This is Spinal Tap\n\n“May I start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here. We are such fans of your music and all of your records. I’m not speaking of yours personally, but the whole genre of the rock and roll.”\n\n98. A Serious Man\n\n“You understand the dead cat? But… you… you can’t really understand the physics without understanding the math. The math tells how it really works. That’s the real thing; the stories I give you in class are just illustrative; they’re like, fables, say, to help give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean – even I don’t understand the dead cat. The math is how it really works.”\n\n97. The Lion in Winter\n\n“You’re so deceitful you can’t ask for water when you’re thirsty. We could tangle spiders in the webs you weave.”\n\n96. The Fly\n\n“I’m saying… I’m saying I – I’m an insect who dreamt he was a man and loved it. But now the dream is over… and the insect is awake.”\n\n95. All the President’s Men\n\n“You’re both paranoid. She’s afraid of John Mitchell, and you’re afraid of Walter Cronkite.”\n\n94. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\n\n“You could have dinner with us… my brother makes good head cheese! You like head cheese?”\n\n93. Mother\n\n“There’s a meridian point that can loosen the knots in your heart and clear all horrible memories from you mind.”\n\n92. Days of Heaven\n\n“You know how people are. You tell them something, they start talking.”\n\n91. Exit Through the Gift Shop\n\n“I think the joke is on… I don’t know who the joke’s on – really. I don’t even know if there is a joke.”\n\n90. To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n“There just didn’t seem to be anyone or anything Atticus couldn’t explain. Though it wasn’t a talent that would arouse the admiration of any of our friends, Jem and I had to admit he was very good at that – but that was *all* he was good at… we thought.”\n\n89. Apocalypto\n\n“I am Jaguar Paw, son of Flint Sky. My Father hunted this forest before me. My name is Jaguar Paw. I am a hunter. This is my forest. And my sons will hunt it with their sons after I am gone.”\n\n88. Once\n\n“What’s the Czech for “Do you love him”?”\n\n87. How Green Was My Valley\n\n“Everything I ever learnt as a small boy came from my father, and I never found anything he ever told me to be wrong or worthless. The simple lessons he taught me are as sharp and clear in my mind as if I had heard them only yesterday.”\n\n86. Punch-Drunk Love\n\n“I have to get more pudding for this trip to Hawaii. As I just said that out loud I realize it sounded a little strange but it’s not.”\n\n85. Paths of Glory\n\n“I apologize… for not being entirely honest with you. I apologize for not revealing my true feelings. I apologize, sir, for not telling you sooner that you’re a degenerate, sadistic old man. And you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!”\n\n84. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\n“Maybe you don’t have to do this all by yourself, mate.”\n\n83. Manhattan\n\n“I had a mad impulse to throw you down on the lunar surface and commit interstellar perversion.”\n\n82. In Bruges\n\n“Number One, why aren’t you in when I fucking told you to be in? Number Two, why doesn’t this hotel have phones with fucking voicemail and not have to leave messages with the fucking receptionist? Number Three, you better fucking be in tomorrow night when I fucking call again or there’ll be fucking hell to pay. I’m fucking telling you – Harry.”\n\n81. The Godfather\n\n“You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you or my boy to me?”\n\n80. Metropolis\n\n“There can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator.”\n\n79. A Fish Called Wanda\n\n“To call you stupid would be an insult to stupid people! I’ve known sheep that could outwit you. I’ve worn dresses with higher IQs. But you think you’re an intellectual, don’t you, ape?”\n\n78. The Proposition\n\n“I know where Arthur Burns is. It is a God-forsaken place. The blacks won’t go there, not the tracks; not even wild men. I suppose, in time, the bounty hunters will get him. But I have other plans, I aim to bring him down – I aim to show that he’s a man like any other. I aim to hurt him.”\n\n77. Repulsion\n\n“I must get this crack mended.”\n\n76. The Shop Around the Corner\n\n“Well I really wouldn’t care to scratch your surface, Mr. Kralik, because I know exactly what I’d find. Instead of a heart, a hand-bag. Instead of a soul, a suitcase. And instead of an intellect, a cigarette lighter… which doesn’t work.”\n\n75. Hot Fuzz\n\n“You wanna be a big cop in a small town? Fuck off up the model village.”\n\n74. The Conversation\n\n“I’m not following you, I’m looking for you. There’s a big difference.”\n\n73. RoboCop\n\n“Let me make something clear to you. He doesn’t have a name. He has a program. He’s product.”\n\n72. Young Mr. Lincoln\n\n“I may not know much of law Mr. Felder, but I know what’s right and what’s wrong. And I know what you’re asking is wrong.”\n\n71. Brazil\n\n“Listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn’t even turn on the kitchen tap without filling out a 27b/6… Bloody paperwork.”\n\n70. Eyes Wide Shut\n\n“I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.”\n\n69. The General\n\n“Heroes of the day.”\n\n68. Catch Me If You Can\n\n“For the last six months, he’s gone to Harvard and Berkeley. I’m betting he can get a passport.”\n\n67. A Streetcar Named Desire\n\n“But some things are not forgivable. Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable! It is the one unforgivable thing, in my opinion, and the one thing of which I have never, never been guilty.”\n\n66. Synecdoche, New York\n\n“I know how to do the play now. It will all take place over the course of one day. And that day will be the day before you died. That day was the happiest day of my life. Then I’ll be able to live it forever. See you soon.”\n\n65. Moonrise Kingdom\n\n“I love you, but you have no idea what you’re talking about.”\n\n64. The Mortal Storm\n\n“I’ve never prized safety, Erich, either for myself or my children. I prized courage.”\n\n63. The Truman Show\n\n“If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there’s no way we could prevent him.”\n\n62. The Night of the Living Dead\n\n“We may not enjoy living together, but dying together isn’t going to solve anything.”\n\n61. The Brothers Bloom\n\n“This was a story about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing, and even love the person she was trapped with. And i told myself this story until it became true. Now, did doing this help me escape a wasted life? Or did it blind me so I didn’t want to escape it? I don’t know, but either way I was the one telling my own story…”\n\n60. The Wicker Man\n\n“You’ll simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice.”\n\n59. Children of Men\n\n“And now one for all the nostalgics out there. A blast from the past all the way back from 2003, that beautiful time when people refused to accept that the future was just around the corner.”\n\n58. Hellboy II: The Golden Army\n\n“Demon! What are you waiting for? This is what you want, isn’t it? Look at it. The last of its kind. Like you and I. If you destroy it, the world will never see its kind again… You have more in common with us than with them.”\n\n57. The Quiet Man\n\n“No patty-fingers, if you please. The proprieties at all times. Hold on to your hats.”\n\n56. Fantastic Mr. Fox\n\n“Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I’m saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you’ll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?”\n\n55. 7th Heaven\n\n“I work in a sewer but I live near the stars.”\n\n54. 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n“I know I’ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I’ve still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.”\n\n53. The Incredibles\n\n“No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved! You know, for a little bit? I feel like the maid; I just cleaned up this mess! Can we keep it clean for… for ten minutes!”\n\n52. A History of Violence\n\n“This isn’t a completely dead eye, it still works a bit. The problem is, the only thing I can see with it is Joey Cusack, and it can see right through him… right through your husband, Edie. I see what’s inside him, what makes him tick. He’s still the same guy. He’s still crazy fucking Joey! And you know it, don’t you? How much do you really know about your husband, Edie? Where he’s from, where he’s been, his life before he met you some 20 years ago?”\n\n51. Mulholland Dr.\n\n“It’ll be just like in the movies. Pretending to be somebody else.”\n\n50. Out of Sight\n\n“I’ve, uh, vertically integrated myself. You know, diversified and shit, and now I’m into the occasional grand larceny, home invasion… shit like that.”\n\n49. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\n\n“Hold fast to the human inside of you, and you’ll survive”\n\n48. The Grapes of Wrath\n\n“Tom, you gotta learn like I’m learnin’. I don’t know it right yet myself. That’s why I can’t ever be a preacher again. Preachers gotta know. I don’t know. I gotta ask.”\n\n47. The Social Network\n\n“I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall, they have the right to give it a try – but there’s no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie. You have part of my attention – you have the minimum amount. The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.”\n\n46. The Prestige\n\n“You never understood, why we did this. The audience knows the truth: the world is simple. It’s miserable, solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, then you can make them wonder, and then you… then you got to see something really special… you really don’t know?… it was… it was the look on their faces…”\n\n45. Die Hard\n\n“You know my name but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he’s John Wayne? Rambo? Marshal Dillon?”\n\n44. Chinatown\n\n“After you’ve worked with a man a certain length of time, you come to know his habits, his values – you come to know him – and either he’s the kind who chases after women or he isn’t.”\n\n43. Where the Wild Things Are\n\n“Happiness isn’t always the best way to be happy.”\n\n42. Throne of Blood\n\n“Admirable, my Lord. You, who would soon rule the world, allow a ghost to frighten you.”\n\n41. My Darling Clementine\n\n“I ain’t gonna kill you. I hope you live a hundred years… so you’ll feel just a little what my pa’s gonna feel. Now get out of town – start wandering!”\n\n40. 12 Angry Men\n\n“Well, I’m not used to supposin’. I’m just a workin’ man. My boss does all the supposin’ – but I’ll try one. Supposin’ you talk us all out of this and, uh, the kid really did knife his father?”\n\n39. Black Swan\n\n“Perfect? I’m not perfect. I’m nothing.”\n\n38. Reservoir Dogs\n\n“If you shoot this man, you die next. Repeat. If you shoot this man, you die next.”\n\n37. Zodiac\n\n“Do you know more people die in the East Bay commute every three months than that idiot ever killed? He offed a few citizens, wrote a few letters, then faded into footnote… Not that I haven’t been sitting here idly, waiting for you to drop by and reinvigorate my sense of purpose”\n\n36. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\n\n“I tell him about destiny; he’s shaking his head. About dreamgirls; he doesn’t care. I mention the underwear thing? He has a *fucking conniption*. And you? How ’bout it, filmgoer? Have you solved the case of the – the dead people in L.A.? Times Square audiences, please don’t shout at the screen, and stop picking at that, it’ll just get worse.”\n\n35. The Thing\n\n“I dunno what the hell’s in there, but it’s weird and pissed off, whatever it is.”\n\n34. North by Northwest\n\n“Now you listen to me, I’m an advertising man, not a red herring. I’ve got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders that depend upon me, and I don’t intend to disappoint them all by getting myself “slightly” killed.”\n\n33. Princess Mononoke\n\n“Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like! This is what it does when it catches hold of you! It’s eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me! Fear and anger only make it grow faster!”\n\n32. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\n\n“Liberty Valance defeated. D-E-F-E-E… T-E-D? The unsteady hand betrays. What’s the matter, Mr. Peabody? Are you afraid? The answer is indub… yes. No courage left. Well, courage can be purchased at yon tavern. But have we credit? That is the question. Have we credit? Well, credit is cheap. Wait for me, old servant of the public wheel. Our shining hour is yet to come. As for you, Horace Greeley, go west, old man, and grow young with the country.”\n\n31. Hoop Dreams\n\n“Four years ago that’s all I used to dream about was playing in the NBA. I don’t really dream about it like that anymore. You know, even through I love playing basketball, you know I want to do other things with my life too.”\n\n30. 127 Hours\n\n“Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah. How do you know so much? Well, I’ll tell you how I know so much. I volunteer for the rescue service. You see, I’m something of a… well, a big fucking hard hero. And I can do everything on my own, you see? I do see! Now… Is it true that despite, or maybe because you’re a big fucking hard hero… you didn’t tell anyone where you were going? Yeah. That’s absolutely correct. Anyone…? Anyone. Oops… Oops. Oops.”\n\n29. The Night of the Hunter\n\n“You know, when you’re little, you have more endurance than God is ever to grant you again. Children are man at his strongest. They abide.”\n\n28. Fargo\n\n“There’s more to life than a little money, you know. Don’tcha know that? And here ya are, and it’s a beautiful day. Well. I just don’t understand it.”\n\n27. Sunshine\n\n“For seven years I spoke with God. He told me to take us all to Heaven.”\n\n26. Inglourious Basterds\n\n“I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.”\n\n25. Halloween\n\n“I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, looking past the wall – looking at this night, inhumanly patient, waiting for some secret, silent alarm to trigger him off. Death has come to your little town, Sheriff. Now you can either ignore it, or you can help me to stop it.”\n\n24. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\n\n“Well, if you’ll pardon my saying so, I guess it is interesting, the many ways you and I overlap and whatnot. You begin with our Daddies. Your daddy was a pastor of the New Hope Baptist Church; my daddy was a pastor of a church at Excelsior Springs. Um. You’re the youngest of the three James boys; I’m the youngest of the five Ford boys. Between Charley and me, is another brother, Wilbur here, with six letters in his name; between Frank and you was a brother, Robert, also with six letters. Robert is my Christian name. You have blue eyes; I have blue eyes. You’re five feet eight inches tall. I’m five feet eight inches tall. Oh me, I must’ve had a list as long as your nightshirt when I was twelve, but I’ve lost some curiosities over the years.”\n\n23. Shaun of the Dead\n\n“Lizzy, how can you put your faith in a man you spectacularly binned for being unreliable? A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot and an impenetrable fortress are the same thing? It’s… This is a pub! We are in a pub! What are we going to do now?”\n\n22. Fantasia\n\n“What you will see on the screen is a picture of the various abstract images that might pass through your mind if you sat in a concert hall listening to this music. At first, you’re more or less conscious of the orchestra. So our picture opens with a series of impressions of the conductor and the players. Then the music begins to suggest other things to your imagination. They might be, oh, just masses of color or they may be cloud forms or great landscapes or vague shadows or geometrical objects floating in space”\n\n21. The Lady Eve\n\n“You don’t happen to be a mouthpiece, do you? You talk like a law school.”\n\n20. Toy Story 3\n\n“Now Woody, he’s been my pal for as long as I can remember. He’s brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind, and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special, is he’ll never give up on you… ever. He’ll be there for you, no matter what.”\n\n19. His Girl Friday\n\n“Walter, you’re wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way.”\n\n18. The Exorcist\n\n“Have you ever heard of exorcism? Well, it’s a stylized ritual in which the rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It’s been pretty much discarded these days except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of an embarrassment, but uh, it has worked. In fact, although not for the reasons they think, of course. It’s purely a force of suggestion. The victim’s belief in possession is what helped cause it, so in that same way, a belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.”\n\n17. The Long Day Closes\n\n“Erosion is the cumulative effect of a great variety of processes – full stop. In general, these can be divided into five groups. One. River erosion. Two. Rain erosion. Three. Glacial erosion. Four. Wind erosion. And five. marine erosion. Life also cooperates in the work of destruction.”\n\n16. The Fall\n\n“What a mystery this world, one day you love them and the next day you want to kill them a thousand times over.”\n\n15. Three Comrades\n\n“So long as you don’t give in, you’re bigger than what happens to you.”\n\n14. Miller’s Crossing\n\n“All in all not a bad guy – if looks, brains and personality don’t count.”\n\n13. Adaptation\n\n“You and I share the same DNA. Is there anything more lonely than that?”\n\n12. Jaws\n\n“You know that was the time I was most frightened… waitin’ for my turn. I’ll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water; 316 men come out and the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.”\n\n11. City of God\n\n“A kid? I smoke, I snort. I’ve killed and robbed. I’m a man.”\n\n10. The Searchers\n\n“Well, Reverend, that tears it! From now on, you stay out of this. All of ya. I don’t want you with me. I don’t need ya for what I got to do.”\n\n9. Alien\n\n“I admire its purity. A survivor… unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.”\n\n8. Lucky Star\n\n“You’re a cannibal and a dirty, no-good low-down little thief!”\n\n7. Jurassic Park\n\n“You never had control, that’s the illusion! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. But I made a mistake, too, I didn’t have enough respect for that power and it’s out now. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan and Lex and Tim. John, they’re out there where people are dying.”\n\n6. The Shining\n\n“I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years. And not all of ’em was good.”\n\n5. There Will Be Blood\n\n“Drainage! Drainage, Eli! Drained dry, you boy! If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake and I have a straw and my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake. I drink your milkshake! I drink it up!”\n\n4. Blade Runner\n\n“Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you were supposed to be good. Aren’t you the “good” man? C’mon, Deckard. Show me what you’re made of.”\n\n3. Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\n“You and I are very much alike. Archeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the pure faith. Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. I am but a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light.”\n\n2. Pan’s Labyrinth\n\n“You’re getting older, and you’ll see that life isn’t like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place. And you’ll learn that, even if it hurts.”\n\n1. Magnolia\n\n“Want to know the common element for the entire group?… I’ll tell you the answer: I’ll tell you, ’cause I had that one. I had that question… Carbon. Carbon. In pencil lead, it’s in the form of graphite and in coal, it’s mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it’s in hard form. “Well… all we were asking was the common element, Donnie… but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge… haha, kids! Heads so full of useless knowledge. Thank you. Thank you.” And the book says: “We may be through with the past… but the past is not through with us!” And… no, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels!”\n\nThe 4’s contain, by a lucky coincidence, the oldest and newest films on my list. They span a period of 85 years. Every movie but one is in a well defined genre, the other being mostly just a drama. Besides also containing the longest title on my list, four of the movies are from before I was born.\n\n94. Hanna (2011)\n\nDirected by Joe Wright. Starring Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett\n\nA fever dream of a movie. Hanna is a coming of age tale with a dark side, told like a fairy tale and impeccably directed and acted. It is always moving forward, whether it be plot driven or character based. An early contender for the best film of 2011.\n\n84. All the President’s Men (1976)\n\nDirected by Alan J. Pakula. Starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford\n\nWhen a movie about reporters figuring out a story is so compelling you know the movie is great. It takes a lot to get a movie that involves almost no action to feel so stimulating. Of course, the acting helps, as does the direction. There’s a lot of All the President’s Men in Zodiac, and even though I like the latter better, the former is still fantastic.\n\n74. In Bruges (2008)\n\nDirected by Martin McDonagh. Starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson\n\nAs dark a comedy as you can get, Martin McDonagh’s feature length directorial debut is one of the best first movies of all time. Intricately constructed and immaculately detailed, it’s got a lot going on so it might take a few times to get everything. But that’s just an excuse to watch it over and over and over again. As if you needed one.\n\n64. The General (1926)\n\nDirected by Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton. Starring Buster Keaton and Marion Mack\n\nBuster Keaton is known for incredibly complex stunts that intensify as he goes along. Some of the action scenes here are 15 minutes long. There’s a lot to be awed by, but one of the best elements is how Keaton is able to build a character through these actions scenes. By the end of the film you really know who Johnnie Gray is and why he does what he does.\n\n54. The Quiet Man (1952)\n\nDirected by John Ford. Starring John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara\n\nI have a fearful temper. You might as well know about it now instead of findin’ out about it later. We Danahers are a fightin’ people.\n\nA good old fashioned love story. Full of kisses in the rain and fighting and dragging your wife across the Irish countryside. Almost mythic in how big it plays the emotions, The Quiet Man is a wonderful romantic comedy with great chemistry between Wayne and O’Hara, perhaps the only woman that could match up to Wayne’s powerful presence. If only there was a restored print that was widely available, the current dvd is a muddied mess that does no service to the beauty of Ireland and O’Hara.\n\n44. The Social Network (2010)\n\nDirected by David Fincher. Starring Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield\n\nI like standing next to you, Sean. It makes me look so tough.\n\nWhen The Social Network hit theaters there was some controversy over whether the movie portrayed the truth of the founding of Facebook. There are exaggerations and outright lies in the movie. Luckily for us, it’s a movie and not a historical document. As a film it is a fascinating study of ambition and the things you lose when you get what you want. It is certainly biased but it is no less of a movie for that.\n\n34. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)\n\nDirected by Shane Black. Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer\n\nWow, I feel sore. I mean physically, not like a guy who’s angry in a movie in the 1950’s.\n\nDelightfully meta and self-aware without being too cute about it. The relationship between Downey and Kilmer is the heart of this film. It makes you remember how awesome Kilmer is. Shane Black knows his buddy cop movies and works with the tropes quite well.\n\n24. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)\n\nDirected by Andrew Dominik. Starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck\n\nLook at my red hands and my mean face… and I wonder ’bout that man that’s gone so wrong.\n\nOne of the half-dozen or so recent westerns that take a more thoughtful track than the typical good guy vs. bad guy idea you see in so many older films of the genre. This movie is about fame and adoration and legend. And it is beautiful. I can’t wait to see what Dominik does next.\n\n14. Sunshine (2007)\n\nDirected by Danny Boyle. Starring Cillian Murphy and Rose Byrne\n\nAt the end of time, a moment will come when just man remains. Then the moment will pass. Man will be gone. There will be nothing to show that we were ever here… but stardust.\n\nSunshine gets a lot of crap for its third act. Allow me to state, here and now and for eternity, there’s nothing wrong with the third act of the film. It’s a different way of explaining the same idea that runs through the rest of the film: what do we do in the face of such power? And the final five minutes are supremely beautiful in both the visuals and the themes they express.\n\n4. Blade Runner (1982)\n\nDirected by Ridley Scott. Starring Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer\n\nFiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rolled around their shoulders, burning with the fires of Orc.\n\nThe future never looked so grimy and gorgeous at the same time. This neo-noir is the best sci-fi movie ever made. It’s not perfect, there’s a romantic subplot that I don’t particularly care about, but that’s small fries when it comes to the sheer brilliance of the rest of the film. It’s telling that Ridley Scott started as an art director because the look of the movie is so singular.\n\nThe other parts of the list:\n\nThe _0’s section\n\nThe _9’s section\n\nThe _8’s section\n\nThe _7’s section\n\nThe _6’s section\n\nThe _5’s section\n\nThe _4’s section\n\nThe _3’s section\n\nThe _2’s section\n\nThe _1’s section"
