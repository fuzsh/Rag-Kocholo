        "text": "Robert William Ford, age 63, died peacefully in his home on Monday April 17th nice and warm in front of his fireplace! Bob was born on Groundhogs Day in 1954 to William and Doris LaGrow Ford. He grew up in Moorhead; graduating from Moorhead High with the class of ’72. He went on to college, graduating with a Marketing and Business Management degree. He worked as an Independent Insurance Agent throughout his career at his business, Bob Ford Financial Services.\n\nOn February 4, 1978, he was united in marriage to Shelley Beaton. They raised their two sons, Christopher and Jess in Moorhead. Bob was actively involved in Scouts with his sons and was proud to be a 3rd and 4th degree member of the Moorhead Knights of Columbus.\n\nBob loved to hunt, fish, watch old western movies, travel and spend time at the lake. Bob also had a little known talent for art and once painted a mural in his parent’s basement. He spent his early years with his family on Upper Cormorant and later with his in-laws on Lake Sallie. Bob loved to socialize and spent many hours laughing and telling “Bob” stories around the campfire! He taught his sons the love of the outdoors and looked forward each year to hunting and fishing trips with his sons, family and friends.\n\nMost of all Bob loved his family. He was very proud of his sons and so happy to add his “daughters” Jessica and Stephanie to the family. But his biggest joy was his three grandchildren, Jack, Grace and William. Bob always looked forward to their visits!\n\nBob is survived by his wife Shelley; sons, Christopher Jessica and their children Jack, Grace and William and Jess Stephanie; sisters, Janice Bruce Harmon and Barbara John Marsh and their children Chad Laura Loosmore and children Griffin and Marlee, Ryan Katie Marsh, and Jason Marsh; his three beloved Aunts, his extended family and his in-laws that were Bob’s second family.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his Parents, his brother Bradley and sister-in-law Cheri.\n\nMemorial visitation will be held Monday, April 24, 2017, from 9:00 to 11:00 A.M., followed by the memorial mass at 11:00 A.M., at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Moorhead. Final resting place will be the columbarium at St. Joseph’s Catholic Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials are preferred to the Boy Scouts of America for the benefit of Camp Wilderness or the Moorhead Knights of Columbus."
