Then a rush. Grabbing for the wheel,\n\nI drop everything I was carrying. All those\n\noversore words rained down in the tired hours,\n\nwith the two of us lying, seething, back-to-back,\n\nstop their continuous, murderous looping.\n\nFor a moment, no more whispers of a pain\n\nfrom deep within; no argument with the gods."
