        "text": "Robert Newton Ford has traditionally been acknowledged as the person who killed Jesse James in James’ residence. Robert and his brother Charles were not known to be connected to most of the James Gang’s crimes, but were nevertheless known to associated with Jesse and the other gang members. Charles Ford is believed to have participated in at least one robbery, but Robert Ford is not thought to have participated in any. In early 1882, the gang was inactive and Robert, Dick Liddil (sometimes spelled Liddel) and Wood Hite who was a cousin of the James brothers were residing at the Missouri home of Robert’s sister, a widow named Martha Bolton. Jesse and his wife had taken a residence elsewhere, also in Missouri, and were living under an alias. They were all fugitives and at least Frank and Jesse had a reward for information leading to their capture offered by the state of Missouri.\n\nOne morning in early 1882, Liddil and Hite got into an argument that quickly escalated into a short gunfight. Hite allegedly fired at Liddil and Liddil returned fire. Both were wounded. Robert Ford was accused of then getting involved, pulling his own weapon and firing the shot that killed Hite. Ford attempted to dispose of Hite’s body but was soon arrested. During his questioning, he offered to give up Jesse James to the authorities. The police accepted the deal. Ford was released and the Missouri governor, Thomas Crittendon, as part of the agreement, had allegedly offered Ford a pardon for the Hite killing, along with the reward money, if Ford would kill Jesse James.\n\nOn April 3, 1882, with all of the other members of the gang having fled, been arrested or killed, Jesse was meeting with the two Ford brothers planning their next robbery. While there, Robert Ford is said to have shot Jesse from behind, killing the outlaw. There are a number of conspiracy theories that center around the killing being a sham, that another person was killed in Jesse’s place and Jesse going on to live well into his senior years. The general consensus is that Jesse was killed that day by Robert Ford. Ford was initially arrested, but released under the agreement with Crittendon, the Missouri governor.\n\nRobert and Charles may have expected to live well off the reward money, but reports were that they only received a small amount of the $10,000 that was promised to Robert with the balance of it being split up among others. The brothers also expected to achieve notoriety and praise for having been part of the end of the James Gang, but that also did not happen. Many people seemed to resent Robert Ford for killing Jesse James. Referring to the events in 1882, a 1925 article entitled “The Rise and Fall of Jesse James” from the Buffalo Courier (Buffalo, New York) speaking of Robert Ford stated “… he has discovered that public opinion severely condemns assassination by law, even in the case of a notorious desperado and outlaw. Not a single reputable paper in the land justified the part he plays in the conspiracy to murder [Jesse] James.” The article continued, “The Fords failed to achieve the popularity they craved.” The brothers even took part in a short lived melodrama called “The Outlaws of Missouri,” the article said. Finally, with Frank James still at large and possibly looking for revenge, the Ford brothers separately elected to move from the area.\n\nThe same article mentioned above related that Charles Ford was stricken with remorse about the killing of Jesse by his brother. It also recounts a chance meeting some time later between Charles and Zerelda Samuel, Jesse and Frank’s mother, in which Zerelda upbraided Ford for his role in the killing. It continued that Charles Ford apologized and begged for her forgiveness. Zerelda is said to have replied, “If God can forgive you, I can.” In bad health and suffering from other issues, Charles Ford committed suicide in 1884.\n\nRobert, on the other hand, eventually worked his way west, settling for a time in Las Vegas, New Mexico. There he reunited with his former associate Dick Liddil. He and Liddil ran a saloon for a while in what is now West Las Vegas, New Mexico. The saloon was one of several there in town. There, it is said, Ford continued to boast of his role in the death of Jesse James. Supposedly Ford badly lost a shooting contest (though not initially a duel) with a local individual named Chávez. This turned out to be José Chávez y Chávez, who was something of a gunslinger and is known to have been involved in the Lincoln County War. Back in Lincoln, Chávez had been considered to be against the Dolan/Murphy faction and on the side of the Regulators, with Billy the Kid, in support of Tunstall and McSween. After losing the Las Vegas shooting contest, Ford is said to have complained about the rules and maligned Chávez. Chávez then challenged Ford to a duel, which challenge Ford declined.\n\nAfter having worn out his welcome in Las Vegas and having lost face to Chávez, Ford decided that it was time to move further north and relocated to Creede, Colorado, then a dusty mining town.\n\nLiddil appears left Las Vegas at that point, returned to Missouri and is believed to have died of a heart attack in 1901 at the age of 48 after attending a horse race in Kentucky. He is buried in Independence, Missouri.\n\nFord went to Creede with a woman named Nellie Watterson, whom he had known from their earlier melodrama. Some accounts say they were married while others say they lived together and never married. Ford opened up a saloon in the rough town that had grown up around the mines. His first saloon burned to the ground when much of the town suffered a fire. He opened a second saloon, still catering to the rough trade. On June 8, 1892, Robert Ford was killed by a shotgun blast in a confrontation with a local individual named Edward Capehart O’Kelley. Ford had reportedly accused O’Kelley of stealing a diamond ring. O’Kelley took offense, left and returned with his shotgun and fired, immediately killing Ford. Ford was initially buried in Colorado, but eventually his remains were relocated to his home town in Missouri.\n\n(Image is believed to be in the public domain)"
