        "text": "Towards the end of our knowing one another\n\nthat infamous whisky-hour conversation ceased\n\nits looping flight and fell from out of the clouds,\n\nbecoming more a string of painful retreats\n\nfrom the same old mountain, with no guide\n\nto navigate a way between the boulders,\n\nthe only choice to keep on going down.\n\nBut then I remember you telling me how\n\nyou always really preferred the plateau,\n\nthe big-sky possibility of the high moors\n\nor the wide-open silence of the desert,\n\nwith the comfort of its horizons. How it\n\nbathed you in a bottomless pool of space.\n\nWhere did it all disappear to? The quiet\n\nsine-wave of your voice circling my ear?\n\nSharing your untold versions of the darkness,\n\npointing them with the tired light of our stars?\n\nfirst published in Cacti Fur, 2020\n\nHolocene\n\nThe shoreline has no recollection of the ice;\n\nonly the genetic memory of suffocation, smothering,\n\nof cold, silent fingers playing at the clay of the Earth,\n\nsundering rocks. There are only echoes, hearsay,\n\nthe whisper of older waters – receded, replenished –\n\nforests, hills, a whole continent swallowed below.\n\nBecoming a pixel in the image, a word of the story,\n\nI press footmarks through a knotted dunescape\n\nto arrive, human, upon it, eyes finally registering\n\nonly in the present tense, shouldering my own tide.\n\nfirst published in Amethyst Review, 2020\n\nOxalis corniculata var. atropurpurea\n\nTrying to put a solid name to every colour\n\nyou think you can see in those posies\n\nof three-hearted leaves, you scribble down\n\na recipe calling for Verdigris, a spool of\n\nold-style camera film, liver (both cooked\n\nand uncooked), the persistent stain left\n\nby berries on your fingers in late summer.\n\nAnd all the while they are taking over\n\nyour world, starting – naturally – at the\n\nfront doorstep before flouncing off at\n\nright angles towards the alley, the off-white\n\ncones of their roots somehow deriving\n\nsustenance from its mortar, slowly working\n\nloose the mass of its hundred year stone.\n\nfirst published in Envoi, 2018\n\nLobster tail\n\nUncommon to find such a thing up here,\n\nbeyond the exhausted seaweed,\n\nvacated mussel shells and limp\n\ntrawlermen’s gloves in bleached out\n\nblue or yellow rubber, their fingers\n\noften present if somewhat perished;\n\nbut there it was, cradled among the\n\nwhirled nests of withered marram\n\nwoven untidily through a scalp\n\nof sutured pebbles. Time had melted\n\nflesh away, revealing the miracle\n\nof its engineering, in segments\n\nand articulations, a suit of armour\n\nstill functioning in our snow-bitten,\n\nastonished fingers, as we prowled\n\nthe empty shore, pleased to find\n\nsuch a simple gift, today of all days.\n\noriginal version published in Ink, Sweat and Tears, 2018\n\nBeing let go\n\nAfter the umpteenth time of having you\n\ncrawl urgently towards her in the darkness,\n\nshe opened up her hand to you and\n\nshowed you what emptiness truly is.\n\nBeing already cut adrift, she sat quiet\n\nas an island while you wept out your dignity\n\ninto the abyss, suddenly opened up; watched you\n\nrolling away, your fish-eyes now aware\n\nof all those truths that were hiding patiently\n\nbehind your shoulder until a moment before.\n\nfirst published in Ariel Chart, 2018\n\nNothing much at all\n\nOut on the rotting deck –\n\nin that unrehearsed collection\n\nof half-barrels, steel buckets\n\nand terracotta pots –\n\nall your flowers are surrendering.\n\nHeads crumple like regret,\n\ncolours leaching into sepia,\n\nleaves and stems cigarette grey.\n\nOnly one hi-vis marigold\n\nproudly refuses to succumb.\n\nIt’s nothing much at all,\n\nan asterisk, a subscript\n\nsomewhere on another page,\n\nbut I feel compelled to mention it,\n\nto spell it out in words,\n\ndevote breath to it.\n\nAnything to cast a\n\nstone into the silence,\n\ncreate the tiniest ripple in\n\nthis heavy ocean between us.\n\nfirst published in Soft Cartel, 2018"
