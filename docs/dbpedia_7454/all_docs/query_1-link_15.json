        "text": "Clapham Junction\n\nMen with hairy hands are falling\n\nasleep on every blue train picking\n\nits way through the wasps’ nest\n\nof intersecting lines. The manger-like\n\nrocking reminds them, sub-consciously,\n\nof being babies, and sends their smug\n\nnewspapers, folded with debatable\n\ntruths, sliding to the floor from their\n\ncrumpled laps. At home, in placid,\n\nunthreatening towns, anxious wives\n\nare fidgeting all alone, while children\n\nwrestle elsewhere in expensive schools,\n\ndesperate to become something different.\n\nA gaunt November evening crashes\n\ndown outside, but nothing will interrupt\n\ntheir slumbering. Whole worlds, apparently\n\nmanaged yet rarely understood, are\n\nslipping by, just beyond their reach.\n\nChristopher became a chief constable\n\nYou once went to his house and\n\ndrank milk from plastic beakers.\n\nHis mother gave you one biscuit,\n\nand kept the small house tidy,\n\nand you never saw his father,\n\nalthough you knew he had one.\n\nWhat you didn’t know then was\n\njust how handsome he would be,\n\na classical kind of beauty, like an\n\nEnglish actor from the nineteen-fifties,\n\nalways smouldering from a uniform;\n\ndashing, yet incapable of empathy.\n\nBut you know it now. You see,\n\nin your memory, his elegant nose\n\nand immaculate skin the colour\n\nof bones, the way his brown eyes\n\njudged the world as if they were grey,\n\nmade of impossibly precious metals.\n\nNone of you noticed. You were all\n\ntoo pre-occupied with teasing, and\n\nsomething close to but not quite bullying,\n\nwith his bookishness – too dismissive\n\nof the awkwardness in his limbs\n\nto see where they were taking him.\n\nLeningrad, 1990\n\nEven with only seven mutually-intelligible phrases,\n\nwe partied on the overnight express north like it was\n\neverybody’s birthday, making a loaf out of crumbs.\n\nCome morning, the train lurched in, to a metropolis with\n\ntwo heads, neither of them facing in the right direction.\n\nThen it rained three days, in bands of withering judgment,\n\nfrom a sky heavy with itself and a marathon of history.\n\nAgeing boulevards, redundant with missing teeth, became\n\ntributaries. Palaces gleamed, and naked-headed citizens\n\nin zip-up jackets, streamed along Nevsky Prospect wearing\n\nidentical tennis shoes, unaware that another revolution\n\nwas rearing like a rodeo bull, in a future already\n\nout of touch with the present. They would soon be\n\nrenaming the city again. Back at our hotel, the lights\n\nflickered. They warned us against drinking the water."
