        "text": "“Love is not a crime…”\n\n‘The Cauldron’ is based on Robert’s dark humor poem about a woman’s revenge on a cheating boyfriend. It was set to music by Gene Pritsker (Matrix Resurrections, Joe Zawinul) and combines elements of jazz, opera and spoken word into a contemporary classical music composition. It’s performed by Sound Liberation, and features the powerhouse soprano vocals of Adriana Valdés and a searing trumpet solo by Frank Hackl (Lew Soloff), accompanied by Gene Pritsker (guitar), Amanda Ruzza (bass--Jill Sobule) and David Cossin (drums--Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), with Robert narrating starting at the 2:00 mark.\n\nNew Album Featuring Carli Muñoz (Beach Boys)\n\nRobert’s sophomore album, Footprints of Steel, is due to drop this summer. It features 12-songs, including a collaboration with Carli Muñoz based on Robert’s poem ‘Gross Domestic Happiness (GDH)’.\n\nCarli was the keyboardist for the Beach Boys (1969-1981) and known for his killer solo on ‘Leaving This Town’. He also is credited on several songs on Dennis Wilson’s solo album Bambu and released a critically acclaimed jazz/world music album Follow Me, inspired by Nobel prize winner Wangari Maathai."
