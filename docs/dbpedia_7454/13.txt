We wait for them, evening, like monks,

with the pale flames of our fire relaxing

down into their pit, to arrive overhead

in blurred circuits of Brownian motion

traced into the grey frame of the sky.

Under the thick silence of evening,

each sound carries an equal weight:

the muted shrilling through windows

of a neighbourâ€™s unanswered phone;

a chain of empty freight wagons

crashing their way south along the

distant railtracks; the lacy movement

of their wings rippling the air. We dare

not speak, almost dare not breathe.
