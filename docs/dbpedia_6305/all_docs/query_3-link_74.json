        "text": "No Limits Band: One of America’s Hottest Live Bands\n\nOnce the No Limits band takes the stage it’ll become instantly clear why they are one of the premier cover bands in the United States today, and why, when the rich and famous are looking for a premier band to play alongside Goo Goo Dolls, it’s No Limits they bring in. There is NO LIMIT to the amount of fun guests will experience when this high energy band is included on the guest list.\n\nThis band is not just any entertainment option. They are a musical phenomenon, guaranteed to transform your party into the must-attend event of the year. With No Limits, the name says it all. There are truly no limits to what your celebration can become.\n\n“We hired No Limits for our wedding and we were blown away!!! By far the best band we have seen at any wedding, and we still have guests talking about them!! It was our best expense of the wedding weekend, and the most commented on part of our wedding. We even had some friends text us after the wedding that they were jealous they didn’t have No Limits at their wedding when they got married. They seriously brought the best energy imaginable – it was a party to say the least. We danced the entire night – there wasn’t one person not on the dance floor. We cannot thank you guys enough for making our wedding the best party ever!“ – Sheri Sussex, Bride, Sun Valley, ID\n\n“WOW!!!!! Amazing!!!! Unreal in every way!!! Everyone in the wedding business around here is asking for the band information. Getting the word out there! Seriously – Evan and H had a blast and can’t stop talking about the band!!!!! They are in flight but as soon as we can – we will give props to the band on social media!! I was going to say – the wedding is the talk of the town but it’s the TALK OF THE SOUTH!!! I see many Seaside returns on their future!!! Thanks for everything!!“ – Willie Harrell, Mother of the Bride, Seaside Beach, FL\n\n“We had No Limits perform for our destination wedding in Jackson Hole and they were absolutely fabulous! The wide variety and assortment of medleys was perfect for our mixed age crowd! They brought the energy all night long and we received so many compliments from our guests! Thank you so much No Limits! You were above and beyond! Love, Becca & Zack“ – Becca Landon, Bride, Destination Wedding, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\n\n2020 Promo Video: The Sky’s the Limit with No Limits\n\nNo Limits stands out because they create an immersive experience. As soon as they hit the stage, the atmosphere charges with excitement. Furthermore, their dance music is infectious, ensuring that every guest finds their groove. Thus, the dance floor becomes a melting pot of moves and unforgettable moments.\n\n“No Limits is by far the BEST corporate cover band in America. EVERY time they perform for one of my major corporate events, the guests are chanting their names, stomping for more songs and refuse to leave the dance floor until they do an encore. Some clients tell me that their male demographic guests ‘don’t dance;’ well let me tell you, they ABSOLUTELY do when No Limits plays. Not only are these band members extremely talented, they are the sweetest, most passionate and professional performers you will ever meet. Their stage energy, amazing vocals and incredible musicianship is truly a blessing to experience. I book them every chance I get, and trust me, you won’t be disappointed if you do.“ – Brian Hodge, Senior Event Producer, Special Events, George P. Johnson Experience Marketing, Las Vegas, NV\n\n“No Limits was fantastic!! We had an absolute blast and all of our guests were raving to us about how good the band was the next day. Thrilled with our choice to use No Limits for the special day!“ – Joe Polychronis, Wedding Client, Jackson, WY\n\n“They absolutely crushed it! Was the most fun night of our lives. The dance floor was packed after the first song and stayed that way all night. Could not have asked for a better performance!!“ – Andrew Peeples, Groom, Sun Valley, ID\n\nUnleash an Epic Party with High Energy Dance Music!\n\nThis powerhouse band is one of the go-to groups for the nation’s biggest events. They received rave reviews for performing at Mardi Gras’ biggest and most spectacular party, “The Orpheuscapade,” alongside country music sensation Dierks Bentley and American Idol’s Harry Connick, Jr. The No Limits Band was also booked for the Baton Rouge Mardi Gras Ball the weekend before the main event, where they received more rave reviews. They are extremely versatile, playing some of the best dance music you’ve ever heard – from the most popular songs of the 60s to today’s Top 40 hits.\n\n“Oh my gosh, we are still in absolute awe!! They were incredible and almost every single one of our guests stayed until the very end! Throughout the entire night, everyone was asking who they were and where they were from! We cannot say enough good things, they had the best energy! We loved the mash of songs and no one wanted them to end. I wish I could have added 2 more hours! Thank you so so so much!! Please tell them how much we loved them!“ – Jordan Tarbett, Bride, Vail, CO\n\n“OMG…They were amazing! Our group loved them!!!! They had such great, high energy and played for 3 hours straight! Their song list was super fun, engaging and great to dance to. Rachel was great to work with and they said they had fun with our crowd. Thanks for getting them booked for us!“ – Marnie L. Andrews, CHG Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT\n\nEnergize Every Moment with the No Limits Band!\n\nNo Limits’ state-of-the-art sound system and dynamic stage presence mean that every performance is not just heard but felt. The result? A vibrant, energetic backdrop that becomes the heartbeat of your celebration.\n\n““No Limits” performed at our son’s wedding last weekend in Park City and they blew everyone away! They packed the dance floor from song #1 for 2.5 hours before they took their first break! Nobody could sit down. Many of our guests came up to me throughout that wonderful night and exclaimed their love for “No Limits!” My niece even came up to me and said, “Now I need to find a partner, get married, and hire “No Limits!” Another, whose dad was a promoter for “The Eagles,” said that he wants to bring “No Limits” to Minneapolis! Don’t hesitate, hire “No Limits” and a trainer to prepare your body to dance all night!” – Ellen Schmitt, Mother of the Groom, Park City, UT\n\n“They were fantastic!!!!! The band kept our guests and, most importantly, the bride and the groom very happy and engaged all evening. They do one heck of a hora! The catering manager at the Broadmoor said they were the best band she’d seen! I’m sorry that I don’t have any more daughters to marry off (not really), but the No Limits band will be one of our go to bands for any other events we put on, business or personal. I’m sure to refer our friends to you all when looking for a great show band! Thanks to all of you for a great evening!“ – Susan Rosen, Mother of the Bride, Colorado Springs, CO\n\nTurn Your Event Into the Season’s Highlight!\n\nBooking No Limits is the key to unlocking a celebration brimming with life and rhythm. Why settle for mundane when you can have incredible? The No Limits band promises a night where every moment is a highlight, leaving your guests in awe and your event in the annals of unforgettable gatherings.\n\n“Holy moly, this band really rocks!

Male lead vocalist Jeff makes the women swoon with his Justin Timberlake-style vocals and Michael Jackson-esque dance moves. Add third lead singer Marcus to the lineup, and this is one of the most powerful frontlines anywhere. With Jordan, a fiery lead guitarist, a hot and heavy bassist, and one of the most incredible drummers on the planet, crowds just can’t get enough. Add in some high-stepping dance routines, dazzling costumes, flashy lights, rich background vocals, and the most charming horn section (optional) you’ve ever seen and you’ve got one of the most exciting bands you’ll ever see.\n\n“We wanted to follow up on our wedding from last night to tell you No Limits was FANTASTIC.

Believe me, if we had a fourth child, we would be flying you all to Minneapolis!\n\nThank you for choosing a great variety of music that touched everyone from my 87 year old mother to our three year old grandson.
