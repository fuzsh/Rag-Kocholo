        "text": "I cannot answer for Karl but I am considering the same HP issues as he is. I would like to interject my answers to one or two of your questions.\n\nN941WR said:\n\n1st. Why do you want a larger engine?\n\nIf the answer is to go faster, build a -7.\n\nIf the answer is for better climb, what's wrong with 2000 solo/1400 GW feet/minute climb?\n\nThe -9 is designed with a 1750 GW in mind. Adding the bigger engine detracts from your useful load.\n\nAlso, the -9 only holds 38 gallons and the O-360 burns more fuel than the O-320. This might have you stopping more frequently.\n\nIf you up the GW, that 50 MPH GW stall will go up, probably to match the -7's, or close to it.\n\nMy answer is that the 180 HP engine I am interested in installing is not the O-360. I am looking to install the ECI IO-340 which is reported to put out 180-185 HP and weigh the same as the O-320. If this is all true then your arguments for using this engine do not stand up.\n\na) As far as going fast is concerned, I am not convinced the -7's are a faster airplane than the -9's. At least not as a general rule. I am sure there are plenty of -7's out there that will be faster than a -9 but my guess is that as more -9's start flying we are going to find they will hold their own against the general population of -7's in the speed department.\n\nb) In my case I have intentions of flying in and out of Rocky Mountain airports with high elevations in the summer months. I am talking about airports in the 8,000 - 12,000 MSL range on days with temperatures in the 90 + degree Fahrenheit range. In this environment having all the climb power I can muster will be important.\n\nc) Running the IO-340 at 55% to 65% should allow for as good or better fuel economy as the O-320 at 75%. It should also allow for a longer life for the engine.\n\nd) If the weight of the engine is not higher than that of an O-320 then there will not be an increase in GW just because you put a \"bigger\" engine in the airplane. More horsepower does not have to equate to a heavier engine.\n\ne) This will not have any negative effect on the stall speed either because there will not be an increase in GW.â€‹\n\nN941WR said:\n\nthe -9 and -7 are very similar but the tail structure of the -9 is different and uses thinner skins than the -7. Just think of the additional beating those 20 extra HP's will give that tail.\n\nThis is something I have never heard before concerning thinner skins. Can you tell me where you got this information and where I can find out more about it? I am not aware that the skin thickness is any different from one RV model to the next.\n\n180 HP for the 9A\n\nBill: thanks for your suggestions. I operate out of an airport a mile high which has much higher density altitudes in the summer. That is the main reason. I figure a Titan 0-360, CS prop, with light wt starter and alt will cost me around 12 #s extra weight over the 160 hp with Cs prop which with an EW of 1100# works for me with the 1750 Gross. I am not aware that the skins in the tail are thinner and will look into that. Your suggestions did not address my more important question of whether Van is correct in saying that the vne of 210 mph should be interpreted as a true airspeed limitation. It is not that hard to get 210 TAS with any of Van's planes at altitude with the nose pushed over, but he says and only for the 9A that one should not exceed 210 TAS because of the possibility of flutter. What does the red line on the airspeed indicator refer to? Indicated speed, of course. So what does anyone know about why he takes this position for the 9A but does not issue any warnings for the other RV's. Perhaps he knows something though testing? Or could it be the long wing and different airfoil. The plane is already rated at lower load limits which would offer some protection if flown correctly. And finally, it is rare to find oneself with too much power in certain situations, but not so rare to wish you had more. And if Van fears one may go to fast and be in the yellow at 75% then I say that the black knob thing on the panel should be pulled back. If anyone has any idea why Van is so afraid of putting the 180 in i would like to hear why>\n\nHello Rick\n\nRick of Austin said:\n\nHaven't flown yet but am very close to flying the RV-9a with a 180hp Superior engine and a Sterba prop. With the 180 hp engine and the wood prop I make less thrust that a 160 hp constant speed right?\n\nIt surprises me how many people feel that its a risk when the RV-6 and the RV-9 have exactly the same VNE hence the same resistance to flutter. Of course with a lower stall speed we have a lower manuvering speed which is what the limiting factor is in rough air and that is basically the topic of the correspondence Van wrote describing why he chose 160 as the maximum hp for the 9.\n\nAm I missing something here? Are there other factors or risk exposures I am not aware of.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nHaven't you already made your decision on this issue? If someone post a good argument to your question, would you change your engine for something smaller? Not trying to pick on you, but it seems a little late to be asking these questions.\n\nVNE: It might be based on structural strength, flutter, or something else. As the builder of your plane you get to decide the VNE of your aircraft as well as all the other specifications. You also get to be responsible for those decisions. As for my plane I decided to use the designers (Vans) recommendation for almost all specification, after all I am not an aero engineer.\n\nI don't think that there is anything wrong with 180hp, other then some weight, but then I went with a CS prop which add weight to my plane. The biggest problem is that the pilot will now have some extra workload to make sure that speeds and loads are not exceeded. Yes with 160hp I also can exceed some of the recommended flight conditions if I am not careful, but not as many as if I had 180hp. I shocked my self the first time I nosed over to head back to the airport (after my fairings were on) and busted VNE before I pulled the power back (I guess that was my flutter test).\n\nThe most important aspect of the engine/airplane is the decision making capability of the operator. You can have lots of power or not so much and as long as you understand what it will do for/to you and choose wisely you will be OK. I have flown my C-172 with 160hp out of a 7000 ft density alt. airport at full gross weight. I did this from a 5000ft paved strip and knew my route of flight would allow for a slow climb.\n\nEnjoy your plane, but make sure that you and anyone else that flies your plane knows where its limits are.\n\nKent\n\nvne considerations\n\nThanks all for your input. Makes sense that since IAS vne goes down as altitude increases that 210 vne TAS would at some point be the limiting factor also. Had a friend talk with someone very important from Van's whose name i will not use because he said that the info he supplied was not the factory's official line. He said that the reason for the 9's lower load limits was because of the longer wing and the company did not want people to fly areobatics with it even though it might well be strong enough. The guy said that they have never had a flutter problem with any of the RV's as might have been the case with the tails on some thin skinned Rockets. He said they never conducted flutter tests, but the factory will not tell you that. All that were done by an outside contractor were ground vibration tests and the factory's load tests on other RV wings. Also he said that the tail on the 9's have same guage as other RV's. He said that there was a guy at his strip who has a 9 with 180 and that it works just fine, and that all that is needed is some speed management. he said that the real concern by Van is that it would be a bit easier to operate in the yellowat 75% and if done so inadvertently, that one might encounter a 50fps gust and then be exceeding the limits Van places on the plane. He said that Van is being very conservative with the speeds to avoid a problem he was worried about but that there have been no actual tests for. This is all second hand info, so take it with a grain of salt. I know the person who received this info and he is generally very reliable, but caveat emptor.\n\nDaver said:\n\nWill a larger engine throttled back use less, the same or more fuel than a\n\nsmaller engine at a higher throttle setting?\n\nSorry, in advance, if this is a stupid question.\n\nDave\n\nFrom my non-expert experience and from my long term research in trying to ferret out the answer to this very question myself I have determined that there may be a difference but only in technical terms. An engineer can probably give you all the numbers to determine exactly what these differences would be. However, in what I have researched, when it comes to the size differences in engines we are talking about in our situations, any measurable differences in fuel burn would be so small they would arguably not even be noticeable, let alone worth worrying over.\n\nThe issue with our airplanes we are looking at is in the size difference between say an O-235 on the small side and an IO-360 on the large side (ok, maybe some might throw in those IO-390's too but I would definitely not consider that engine on a 9). In fact, the reality is that most of us wrestling with this notion are really looking at the difference between an O(IO)-320 and an O(IO)-360. Between those two engines we are talking about a size difference of 40 cubic inchs. That is a relatively small size difference. It really is not a big enough size difference to see much in the way of change in fuel burn. Yes, I am sure there is some, but in the manner in which we everyday pilots determine our fuel burn, the difference would barely be noticeable.\n\nSo the reality is that running a 180 HP engine at 65% is very likely to produce a fuel burn that would be so similar to a 160 HP engine running at 75% that the normal pilot would be hard pressed to be able to notice a difference in fuel burns for the two engines at those two settings.\n\nOne other thing to consider also is the longevity factor for the two engines. If one engine spends the majority of its time running at 65% HP and the other spends the majority of its time running at 75% HP I would be inclined to believe that the former is much more likely to outlive the latter.\n\nI know there are many on these threads who do not like the idea of comparing automobile engines to aviation engines but I have a hard time believing there really is that drastic of a difference in the two environments. In that light I would pose this:\n\nlook at the running RPM's on your automobile engine.\n\nIs it pushed to the limit most of the time?\n\nWould you think of its longevity as being related to how hard you push its engine?\n\nWould you anticipate a four banger 100 HP engine in an S-10 pickup that was revved to the high end its entire life by a hot rod racing cement contractor to be in as good shape after 10 years as would be a V-8 350 in a full sized pickup that spent that same time period cruising interstates at 70 mph?\n\nAs an example, I have a 2000 GMC 1/2 ton P/U with a fuel injected 350. It has a max RPM of 6000 on the Tachometer. So I can really wrap that engine up if I wanted to. However, it spends more than 95% of its time cruising the highways and city streets where I live. During its most stressed out times it may have a load placed on it that will push the RPM's up to about 2400. That would indicate to me that this engine is purring along well under the 55% of max HP that most aviation engines would be flying at on the slow end of operations (doing the math we are talking about 40% of max RPM at its most abused times). To be more realistic I know that when I have the cruise set at 70 mph that engine is generating about 2000 RPM. Now we are talking about this engine running at 33% of its max RPM (I have not studied the power curve of this engine so I am not sure if max HP is at max RPM. I would expect it is not but I do not know for a fact if that is true). I have all the confidence in the world that my driving this engine at 33% is much more likely to result in a long productive life for this pickup (it is already seven years old with zero indication that anything is going to fall apart anytime soon). There has got to be some merit in choosing an engine that will not be wrapped out like a race car for the majority of its existence.\n\nI would think that even if the fuel savings is a marginal number, the fact I am not pushing the engine as hard should account for something in running a more powerful engine. This is all in addition to the added climb performance the increase HP will provide.\n\nOne O235 in many versions\n\nRussell said:\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with an RV9 with an O-235 with 108 HP instead of the usual minimum 118 HP???\n\nRuss\n\nYep at 2800 rpm some models of O235 are 118HP.\n\nFrom the data there are no 108HP O235's. There are:\n\n115 (6.75:1) **\n\n116 (8.10:1)\n\n118 (8.50:1)\n\n125 (9.70:1)\n\n** (I am a little suspicious that the 6.75:1 compression is 115 hp. 1 hp less than the 8.10:1 version, BUT that is what Lycoming publishes.)\n\nThe 108 HP comes from a lower RPM rating? It could be probably a 115 or 116 hp engine at 2,700 RPM.\n\nI know 108 hp sounds familiar**:\n\nC152 (110HP)\n\nPA-38 Tomahawk (112hp)\n\nAA-1 Grumman Yankee/Trainer 108 HP)\n\nCould it be a \"de-rated\" 115hp or 116 hp engine due to prop (lower RPM)? I am not sure.\n\nUsually Lyc advertises \"X\" HP like 160 HP, and the planes that use that engine also claim 160 HP, say like for a C-172 with a O320, 160HP engine. The Dirty little secret is the C-172 with a \"160HP\" engine is making may be 135-140HP max, in the airframe with the prop and restrictive exhaust.\n\nThis is why the after market power flow exhaust for factory planes like the C172 claim such great HP increase, the original pipes where terrible. The total HP never goes over what Lyc advertised. The Power Flow pipes just gets you back to rated power. Power flow on a RV with good cross over or 4into1 pipes would not see the gain a C172 does, if any.\n\nSo why the disconnect between Lyc numbers and the airframe HP numbers for the O235? (I could have bad data but that is what I found.) Does any one know?\n\nThere are 125 hp high compression versions (@2800 rpm) of O235 that Lyc came out with but withdrew from the market. It worked great on the test stand but in the hands of pilots, in the field, it had detonation problems.\n\nStrangely there are STCs for high compression pistons (125HP) you can get today for low compression model O235's, which are based on Lycs original design (actual parts). I would recommend NOT using those HC pistons (9.70 to 1). Some do run 125 hp with successes, but an engine monitor and careful operations would be needed.\n\nThere are two companies who offer the 125 hp STC upgrades to the low compression O235's, which are typically found in C152, Tomahawk and Grumman Yankee. With an experimental you don't need the STC of course and can just buy the HC pistons and re-jet the carb. I forgot what else was involved in the conversion. I think the STC also had cooling improvements (new baffles & oil cooler). As I say, new pistons will bring the HP up, but I would not go over 8.50 to 1 my self. Forget low octane gas over 8.50:1. You are asking for problems over 8.50 or 8.70 to one. They will fly fine but the detonation margins are less.\n\nYour plane will fly fine with 108 hp. If your prop is pitched for 2800 RPM you will make more than 108 hp in my opinion, like about 115 hp. For each 100 RPM's, it's worth about 5-7 HP. On the other hand if the prop is NOT pitched properly you may not even get 108 hp out of it. One advantage of the metal Sensenich is you can re-pitch it. Of course wheel pants and other drag reductions will be like adding HP. If you lower drag than you also need a new prop. The perfect prop is in a small band and to be ideal must match YOUR airframe. Change the airframe requires a change to the prop to match, to get max performance.\n\nIf Van's engine was really making 118 hp, with 108 hp, you would fly about**:\n\n100 fpm less climb\n\n20 feet more t/o run\n\n200/300ft lower service celling\n\n5 mph slower top/cruise speedâ€‹\n\n** These are Swags. I am not sure what prop van used or what RPM Van did t/o dist, ceiling, climb, cruise, and top speed at.\n\nUnless the engine is at rated RPM than its not making rated HP (as well as sea level atmo). So the prop (fixed) is key to getting HP. If you have a \"108HP\" O235 you can get 118 hp out of it with higher RPM. However do you want to cruise at 2800 RPM?\n\nAn over pitch cruise prop cause you to suffer loss of t/o and climb performance. A climb prop will give better performance at loss of economy and or speed in cruise. There is a balance with fixed pitch props is between turning enough RPM on TO/Climb (slow speed) and not too much in cruise (high speed).\n\nMore HP on the RV9 and structural changes needed\n\nI have the same requirements as Karl and the need for more climb (High DA) is needed. I to don't understand why the RV9 can't be modified with thicker skins (if that's what's needed) along with better balancing to accommodate the additional speed if needed. It would be nice to get some help and understanding from other builders on this so we can make the appropriate changes.\n\nDavid\n\nRVbySDI said:\n\nI cannot answer for Karl but I am considering the same HP issues as he is. I would like to interject my answers to one or two of your questions.My answer is that the 180 HP engine I am interested in installing is not the O-360.
