        "text": "2019 KR Gathering at Mount Vernon, IL, again hosted by a committee of KR builders and flyers. Photos taken and posted by John Bouyea.\n\nOne good resource for new or prospective builders is \"The KR Gospel, according to Mark\".\n\nRob Schmitt created and posted a KR2S Inspection Checklist for his plane in Word format for those looking for a good head start on this important process.\n\nThere is an old but informative KRnet FAQ that is full of building tips. There is a lot of stuff there, so please check it out before asking the same old questions on KRnet.\n\nIn 2014 there was an EAA webinar devoted to the KR series that is an overview of modifications, engines, flying characteristics, etc. Please forgive the \"iron lung\" sound effects...the mic was too close.\n\nThere's a very informative \"KR Performance\" spreadsheet ) in web viewable HTML form that details performance numbers (speed, stall, weight, prop, engine, carb, etc) of many of today's flying KRs. The Excel spreadsheet version KR Info, so if you'd like to add a line or update yours, please send it to Mark Langford for inclusion into the Performance Spreadsheet\n\nPlease utilize the KRNet \"Mail Archive\" search engine at KRnet Archive to check for immediate answers to your questions. This search engine has every email posted to KRnet since 2003, so whatever you're looking for, it's probably there! Thanks to John Boyeau for doing all the leg work to make this happen.\n\nThe KRnet list archive site is a list of all email messages posted in the last few years, listed chronologically. This archive is not as extensive and only goes back a few years, so it is best used as a backup.\n\nThe KRnet Archives is also run by John Bouyea, and has almost all of KRnet's correspondence since the earliest days.\n\nA low-drag airfoil was designed back in the early 2000's specifically for the KR2S, in a cooperative effort between several KRnetters and the University of Illinois. It has now become the \"standard\" airfoil for KRs of all types. See details at the AS504x Airfoil Site\n\nThe KR Newsletter was published as a means to discuss ideas, building and flying techniques, etc. All issues are posted on the KR Newsletter page. Reproduction of the KR Newsletter artwork with permission of Larry Capps.\n\nMike Sylvester's O-200 powered KR2S has a simple but elegant paint job that's unique among KRs. Simple is the theme with Mike's KR, and it works!\n\nRobert Pesak's O-200 powered KR2S has a unique one-piece wing that mounts from below the fuselage, along with some other well-made improvements, such as an aluminum plenum box system, with integral oil cooler.\n\nRob Schmitt continues the KR education Kyle Micklewait got during Rob's KR orientation flight, a few minutes earlier. This is what the KR Gathering is all about...the opportunity for builders to talk to other builders and pilots, and toward completion, get a little KR stick time in to prepare for first flight.\n\nThis is South African KR2, ZS-VYZ, originally built by Martin Clark in 1985, owned by Ferdi Koekemoer when this was taken, and now owned by Rudi Venter. It is fitted with a 2400cc turbocharged and intercooled Volkswagen as well as a 59inch Hoffman in-flight adjustable prop. I must say it has aged well, for a 24 year old airplane! For more details, see Rudi's ZS-VYZ page\n\nDon Reid has scanned and posted all known Sport Aviation articles dealing featuring KRs. While you're there, check out the rest of his highly engineered KR-2XL!\n\nRick Junkin, a professional F-15 test pilot, published a KR2S Flight Test Plan back in 1998, specifically for the KR2S. You'd be crazy not to read this before flight testing your KR....it is truly excellent work!\n\nIf you are getting ready to make your first flight, be sure to check out Jim Faughn's \"How to make a Perfect KR Landing\" site.\n\nRob Schmitt has posted a KR2S Pilot Operating Handbook, provided as a template for others to use.\n\nKROnline was a free online electronic KR Newsletter devoted to sharing information with other KR builders and pilots in a timely manner. Only a few \"issues\" were created, but they are chock full of valuable information gained from the experience of many web oriented KR builders. Check it out!\n\nThere's a Word document that details KR accidents listed in the FAA's database, at http://www.n56ml.com/KRaccidents.doc , although it is several years old and could use an update.\n\nThere is also a \"CorvAircraft\" list devoted to the Corvair engines in aircraft. Unfortunately, the company hosting the list is \"rudderless\" at the moment (due to sudden death of the owner), and we are unable to add new members to the list. If this ever gets fixed, you may subscribe by visiting http://list.corvaircraft.org/mailman/admin/corvaircraft_list.corvaircraft.org and subscribing online, or simply by sending an email to corvaircraft@list.corvaircraft.org. The CorvAircraft list still exists, but traffic is relatively low, and is fairly quiet lately.\n\nThere are several Corvair experts on the list, and experimenters who are flying behind Corvairs in KRs, Pietpenpols, Zeniths, and Sonex's (Cleanex), and working to install them in several other homebuilt aircraft. The CorvAircraft email list archive is located at http://list.corvaircraft.org/mailman/private/corvaircraft_list.corvaircraft.org/ .\n\nThere is an alternative aircraft engine list devoted to the use of VW and 1/2 VW engines, as well as other automotive and motorcycle engines, in aircraft. For information on how to join, as well as access to their archives, visit the VW Aircraft Engine List Webpage. This is very good stuff for those interested in Volkswagen engines especially.\n\nJohn Martindale of Australia, in formation with ...\n\nSuppliers of KR parts:\n\nnVAero, LLC, 23052H Alicia Parkway #413, Mission Viejo, CA 92692 (800.515.4811)\n\nOfficial supplier of KR parts, blessed by Rand Robinson.

Photo by Dave Mullins (the guy with the huge honkin' lense!).\n\nThis is Larry Flesner's 0-200 powered KR2S, which Larry built before the KR2S plans were available. The whole plane is \"upsized\" a little to meet Larry's 6'-4\" frame, and there's still plenty of headroom left! The workmanship is outstanding, and this plane gave my 2700cc Corvair a good run for the money. I took this picture on the way to the Wicks open house in 2010, where we met Ron Highower, EAA's new president.\n\nMark Jones in his \"Deer Slayer\" KR2S, on the way to Oshkosh for Airventure 2009.\n\nThis is Richard Shirley's KR-1.

It will do 230 mph flat out, mostly because of attention to aerodynamic detail. A careful study of this photo will show you how this plane differs from most other KRs. He is also flying the new AS504x airfoil.\n\nThis is Aussie Allen Buzza in his retractable KR2, flying formation with Peter Gilbert in his BD5 over Fremantle Harbor near Perth.\n\nNasser's United Arab Emirates KR2.\n\nJohn Shaffer's \"KR2SS\" (super stretch) has retractable tri gear, and looks very sweet in flight.

There are more photos of it at 2004 MVN KR Gathering web page.\n\nHere's Marty Roberts, Steve Alderman, and Jim Faughn flying formation near the Red Oak Iowa airport during the 2003 KR Gathering. There are lots more photos located on the 2003 KR Gathering web page.\n\nThis is Joe Horton's airplane at Sun N Fun 2010. Steve Glover sent this to me to show how much hotter Joe's plane seemed to be that year...\n\nThis web site was established by Mark Langford in 1994, and was the very first site dealing with any of the KR series of aircraft, or even devoted to a particular experimental aircraft, for that matter. Please report broken links or offer constructive criticism to Mark at krnet-owner@list.krnet.org .\n\nSorry if there aren't enough bells and whistles for you on this page. I've tried to keep loading time to a minimum. As a former 2400 modem user, I'm acutely aware of the price we pay loading so many superfluous images, fonts, audio, and video flotsam and jetsam that all too often replace plain text. And while others are downloading annoying flashing banners and advertisements to you, I'm downloading helpful information for you.\n\nThanks, Mark Langford, ML \"at\" N56ML.com\n\ncorvaircraft@list.corvaircraft.org."
