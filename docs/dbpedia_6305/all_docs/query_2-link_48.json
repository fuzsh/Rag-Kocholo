How much actual Alaska experience do you have? You make a baseless statement in response to my comments that moving the prop is unnecessary in rain and snow? Do you find it necessary to move the prop in your climate? Do you park outdoors normally? Was this thread supposed to be a sharing of experiences or is it a platform for you to state what you do and then critcize all others? What's your qualification to imply that what I've done with multiple airplanes for 25 years in harsh weather is wrong?\n\nLast edited: Oct 29, 2018\n\nOmalley1537\n\nCleared for Takeoff\n\nJoined\n\nMar 13, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n1,371\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nSean\n\nOct 29, 2018\n\n#38\n\nVertical of course...how else do you hook the tow strap to a blade to tug the plane around?\n\nEdit: I forgot...THIS IS A %#*^$&@ joke!!!!\n\nApparently we have to say that now, or some idiot might get his panties in a bunch and report to the FSDO for investigation...\n\nMarshall Alexander\n\nPre-takeoff checklist\n\nJoined\n\nOct 29, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n213\n\nLocation\n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\nDisplay Name\n\nDisplay name:\n\nmalexander\n\nOct 29, 2018\n\n#39\n\n150, 172 set it horizontal.
