        "text": "Natural parasitism in eggs of Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) by Trichogramma spp. (Hymenoptera, Trichogrammatidae) in Brazil. Field surveys were carried during four soybean seasons in Southern Brazil to evaluate the occurrence of parasitoids in eggs of Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner, 1818 and their incidence along the crop season. Eggs were collected by visual search on soybean leaves and from plants kept inside cages where A. gemmatalis moths were allowed to lay eggs. Trichogramma acacioi Brun, Moraes & Soares, 1984 was recorded for the first time in eggs of A. gemmatalis and the citations in the literature of Trichogramma lasallei Pinto, 1998 in Brazil where based on the material collected in this survey. Apart from these species, Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879, Trichogramma rojasi Nagaraja & Nagarkatti, 1973 and Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman & Platner, 1983 were also collected, all of which have been previously recorded in this host. Parasitized eggs were collected all over the period of occurrence of A. gemmatalis, from January to April each year. Total parasitism ranged from 4.8% in 2000 and 2002, 23.3% in 2001 and 28.9% in 2003. T. pretiosum and T. acacioi accounted for more than 80% of the parasitoids emerged each year, followed by T. atopovirilia, T. rojasi and T. lasallei, with less than 20% of incidence. Both the sex ratio and the mean number of parasitoids/egg did not differ among the species. Searching for A. gemmatalis eggs proved to be time consuming in comparison to the collection of eggs laid by moths inside the cages, which showed to be a useful method to provide qualitative estimates of parasitism in eggs of A. gemmatalis."
