Dr. Molnar created our first textbook, edited the subsequent two editions, and wrote numerous state-of-the-art textbook reviews for the Child with Physical Disability. After escaping from Hungary in 1956 from the Russian occupation and communist regime, Dr. Molnar displayed much foresight and courage throughout her professional career. Her guiding principle has always been that children are not miniature adults, but individuals with changing physical, intellectual, and emotional abilities and needs. At every age, therefore, the principles of rehabilitation medicine have to be adapted to these changing aptitudes. Beginning as a resident at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Dr. Molnar quickly rose through the ranks from faculty instructor to full tenured professor, while developing and running the Pediatric Rehabilitation\n\nMedicine Service. Concluding her career at Children’s Hospital and Research Center in Oakland, California, where she created a new Department of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, she finished training her last of over 50 domestic and international fellows. Her speaking career has included invitations from all over the world, including Australia, Europe, Asia, and England. She has served on the editorial boards for the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation from 1976 to 1994 and Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology from 1992 to 1997. She is a recipient of the Krusen Award from the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPMR), the highest honor obtainable for proven performance in clinical expertise, contributions to the literature, and administration in the field of rehabilitation medicine. Simply stated, Dr. Molnar defines the standard for the rest of us to follow.\n\nv\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nContents\n\nPreface ...................................................................................................................................................... ix Contributors .............................................................................................................................................. xi\n\nChapter 1\n\nHistory and Examination.................................................................................................... 1 Michael A.

She has passed the torch to me and Dennis Matthews and we have been stimulated by the challenge. For the most part we have kept the basic structure of past editions while making changes that reflect the advancement of pediatric rehabilitation. Our field is changing and so we have streamlined some topics and added new chapters on gait labs, as many of us are actively involved in this exciting adjunct to our practice of medicine. We have added a new chapter on aging with pediatric onset disability that will be of great interest to physiatrists. Medicine and rehabilitation are changing. Many of us see very few arthritis patients. Our rheumatology colleagues are doing a fantastic job with these children and so the need for rehabilitations has decreased. Leg lengthening, limb salvage procedures, limb reattachment, and improved safety of farm machinery have decreased the number of children who need prosthesis. Genetic testing has altered the referral patterns for children who need electromyography. Bladder continence and bowel irrigation surgeries have changed how we manage patients with spinal cord injuries. More of us are seeing children with concussions as the literature proves the value of screening and\n\nfollowing the children serially. Our options for spasticity management are different and more widely used than in the last edition of this book. We are constantly challenged by children who are surviving cancers to assist in their rehabilitation. Patients with solid organ transplants benefit from our services. Our patients seem sicker, spend less time on our inpatient units, and are now managed in day programs. The chapter authors have diligently incorporated these issues and many more. A new feature of this edition is “Pearls and Perils” of caring for different types of patients. These pearls and perils are important take-home points some of the authors have for you. You will notice that some chapter authors have returned and we have asked them to incorporate new pediatric rehabilitation specialists, as it is our hope that these new coauthors will become the senior authors of future chapters and perhaps editors of future editions. We are happy to present to you this compiled wisdom of the brightest and most enthusiastic clinicians in our tightly knit group of pediatric rehabilitation specialists. Michael A. Alexander Dennis J.

Alexander and Gabriella E. Molnar\n\nThe physiatric history and examination of a child require a blend of medical diagnostic skills to establish or confirm the diagnosis as well as a knowledge of child development and behavior to evaluate functional assets and difficulties for the intervention phase of rehabilitation.\n\nSETTING THE TONE To ensure the best cooperation, especially in the preschool age, the environment should be child-friendly. Exposure to crying and upset children should be avoided in the waiting room or other areas. If the family brings the child’s siblings, someone should take care of them during the appointment so that the parents can focus on the interview without distraction. The examination room should have a small table and chair with an assortment of toys for different ages to make the child comfortable and relaxed. The examiner’s attire also influences the child. A good rule is to “lose the white coat.” The child is not impressed by it and, in fact, may be intimidated from past medical visits. Pictures of cartoon characters or animals on the wall, small toys, and decals on instruments help to create a playful atmosphere and alleviate the child’s fears. Start the visit by introducing yourself, which should include telling the patient and parents something about yourself, and what will be happening\n\nduring the visit, and for how long, and then asking the parents to tell in their own words why they came and what specific questions they have for you. Concerns stated by the referral source should be shared with the parents. Many parents are unsure about what information the visit can provide. This is the opportunity to explain what pediatric rehabilitation is and what it can offer the child and family. The examiner also should explain that it is part of the examination to watch the child so that the parents will not feel offended by the examiner’s wandering gaze. Because observation of spontaneous behavior is one of the most informative aspects of evaluating youngsters with a disability, examination begins from the moment the child is in the physician’s view. Questions about history and illnesses should be asked in simple terms so that the family can understand them and provide proper information. It is also important to clarify insurance coverage and whether additional tests can be performed on the same day or must await approval.\n\nHISTORY Prenatal and Perinatal History The prenatal and perinatal history includes the preconceptual period and the parents’ ages and health before and since the birth of the child. Maternal\n\n2\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\nfactors during gestation may lead to fetal malformations. Examples of these associations include febrile illnesses (1) anticonvulsants (2) with spina bifida; maternal diabetes with caudal regression syndrome and sacral agenesis; and rubella, thalidomide, or fetal alcohol syndromes. Feeble or eventually lost fetal movements may be the earliest sign of a motor disability of prenatal origin. Prenatal care, unusual weight gain or loss, hypertension, or any other gestational problems should be explored. Mode and duration of delivery, use of anesthesia, induction, intrapartum complications, and expected and actual date of birth should be noted. History of previous pregnancies, deliveries, and fetal loss is necessary. Prenatal cerebral damage seems to be increased in infants of mothers with previous spontaneous abortions (3). A detailed neonatal history is essential, including birth weight, Apgar scores, onset and success of breastfeeding, and the infant’s age at discharge. Weak lip seal and sucking force and inadequate feeding may be preliminary signs of oral motor dysfunction. If the infant needed admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), what were the problems, medications, and supportive measures? Neonatal seizures may signal pre- or perinatal brain damage. Prematurity, particularly very low birth weight, is a frequent cause of cerebral palsy (2). Large birth weight may lead to intrapartum trauma, brachial plexus palsy, or, on rare occasions, spinal cord injury, particularly with breech or other fetal malposition. When extended hospitalization was required, one should note the infant’s age, weight, and condition on discharge, including means of feeding and need for ventilatory or other supportive measures at home, which may predict subsequent, persistent, or recurrent problems.\n\nDevelopmental History The developmental history should cover all major aspects of function and behavior. For details of developmental milestones and testing, the reader is referred to Chapter 2. This discussion presents only guidelines for the purpose of diagnostic interpretations. Discrepancies between different areas of functioning provide clues about the nature of medical diagnosis and developmental disability. Delayed accomplishments, primarily in motor function, suggest a neuromuscular deficit. One of the earliest signs that parents report is a lack of spontaneous movements when the infant is held or placed in the crib. They may add that the baby feels limp or stiff, suggesting hypotonia or spasticity. In all cases of motor dysfunction, it is important to clarify whether the dysfunction was a steady, continuing delay from an early age, suggesting a static disease, or an arrest\n\nor regression noted at a particular point. However, the relatively fast pace of early motor development may mask slow deterioration due to progressive neurologic disease for a while. Developmental history and subsequent assessment must take into consideration the interactive effect of coexistent deficits. A significant cognitive dysfunction by itself may delay gross and fine motor development (4). It also tends to enhance the functional consequences of a neuromuscular disability. Slow development in personal and adaptive tasks that require both motor and cognitive abilities may be related to impairment in either area. A combination of both can create the impression that the motor deficit is more severe than it actually is. A history of delay in communication development raises several differential diagnostic possibilities: (a) true language dysfunction affecting receptive or expressive domains or both, (b) oral motor dysfunction interfering with speech production, and (c) significant hearing loss. In a child with motor disability, language dysfunction may result from diffuse or focal cerebral lesions, such as head injury or cerebral palsy, particularly when cognitive function is also affected. The ability to follow simple and, at a later point, complex commands indicates preserved receptive language even in the absence of verbalization. Parents report a variety of responses, such as smiling, cooing, crying, pointing, or vocalization with inflection as a substitute for speech. Oral motor dysfunction is also associated with cerebral palsy, most often with spastic quadriparesis or dyskinetic disorders due to suprabulbar or pseudobulbar palsy. Bulbar palsy in medullary involvement affects speech production, for example, in spinal muscular atrophy or spina bifida with syringobulbia. There is a close association between anatomical structures and neurologic control for speech and oral feeding. Concurrent oral motor dysfunction with feeding difficulties is an additional sign of bulbar or pseudobulbar pathology and confirms the suspicion of speech production deficit. In such cases, history of early feeding is most relevant. For example, was there a good lip seal and strong suction on breastfeeding? When bottlefed, the infant can handle 4 ounces in about 10 minutes, and feedings every three to four hours are generally adequate. The need for longer and more frequent feeding to maintain weight gain, especially during the first few months; coughing; nasal regurgitation of liquids; difficulty with drinking from a cup; and difficulty with introduction of solid food due to chewing problems are early symptoms of oral motor dysfunction and a possible subsequent deficit in speech production. Augmentative communication training should be initiated early in such cases.\n\nChapter 1\n\nHearing is an essential factor for speech development. Early cooing and babbling are innate characteristics of infants and involve the same vocal components, regardless of the language spoken in their environment. Infants with hearing loss start to fall behind after six to eight months of age when learning of auditory-dependent vocalization begins. Parents may notice a decrease even in spontaneous babbling at that age. All neonates and infants at high risk for developmental disability or recurrent ear infections should have an initial and, if warranted, repeat hearing evaluations. Correction of a hearing deficit should be provided as soon as possible after it is detected (5). For infants and young children, the history is obtained from parents or caretakers. While gathering information from one person about another, the examiner gains an understanding of both and establishes rapport with parents and child. Early school-aged children can provide some information about themselves and should be encouraged to do so. Preadolescents and particularly adolescents generally prefer to give an account of their problems and achievements. Adolescents often wish to have privacy without the parent present, at least for part of the visit.\n\nGeneral Health History The examiner should determine whether the patient is an essentially well child with impairment or a sick child who has been hospitalized several times. In the latter case, one should explore in detail the frequency, reasons, tests, and treatments. Even if one has access to records, the parents should be asked to tell the child’s history in their own words. Their account provides an insight into their knowledge and participation in the child’s care. One should ask how many visits they make to medical centers and therapists and how much time is spent in transit for the child’s care. History of allergies to medications or other substances should be noted. An early history of allergies to different and often inconsistent formulas may indicate that the child in fact had feeding difficulties that were attributed to allergy. Multiple exposures to latex and any signs of allergy should be determined, particularly in spina bifida or after repeated surgeries. Any medications that the child takes regularly, including dietary supplements and homeopathic or alternative medications or aerosols, should be recorded with dosage and schedule. The risk and incidence of seizures are higher in static and progressive diseases of the central nervous system. Overt or suspicious signs, type and frequency of seizures, anticonvulsants, and their effectiveness and possible side effects should be recorded.\n\nHistory and Examination\n\n3\n\nNutrition, with special consideration for the child’s disability, should be reviewed. Feeding difficulties or behavior problems may lead to inadequate consumption of calories and essential nutrients. Dietary intake may be lower than required for the increased energy expenditure on physical activities in children with motor disability. In contrast, caloric intake may be excessive when physical activity level is restricted and lead to obesity, most often in wheelchair users with spina bifida (6) or muscular dystrophy. Dietary information and guidance are fundamental for regulation of neurogenic bowel incontinence. Family eating patterns should be taken into consideration. Injuries, burns, fractures, and spinal cord and head trauma are followed by a catabolic state. Monitoring of weight, nutrition, and fluid intake is essential during inpatient rehabilitation for major injuries. Caloric requirements for children are calculated from age-appropriate standards, which take into consideration growth. In children with motor disability, upward or downward adjustment in height and weight may be needed, depending on their level of physical activity and individual growth trend. Specific recommendations are available for children with spina bifida to avoid obesity (7,8). History of respiratory complications, past or present, should be explored in certain disabilities. Central ventilatory dysfunction (CVD) is a complication of ArnoldChiari malformation in spina bifida (9). Syringobulbia may cause similar symptoms. Nightmares, insomnia, and night sweating are complaints associated with hypercapnia, and may be reported in advanced stages of muscular dystrophy or atrophy. Hypercapnia and sleep apnea may occur in diseases of the central nervous system. Intercostal muscle paralysis in high thoracic paraplegia with spinal cord injury or spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy, or advanced muscle diseases leads to inefficient pulmonary ventilation and handling of secretions. With severe spastic or dyskinetic cerebral palsy, the respiratory musculature may lack coordination. Such children are prone to recurrent bouts of pulmonary infections. Coexistent feeding difficulties with minor aspirations, or restrictive pulmonary disease due to spinal deformities are additional adverse factors. Restricted mobility of the spine and thoracic cage may be present in ankylosing spondylitis or severe systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Detailed information about home management and use and frequency of equipment must be included in the history. Exercise dyspnea may be a sign of pulmonary compromise or deconditioning due to the high energy cost of physical activities in children with a motor disability. Cardiac decompensation with rightsided failure, a potential complication of pulmonary\n\n4\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\ndysfunction, is more likely to occur in older children or young adults with the previously mentioned disabilities. Myopathic conduction defects and arrhythmias are often symptom-free in the absence of heart failure. Consultation with pulmonary and/or cardiology specialists should be arranged when history reveals suspicious symptoms. Visual and hearing impairments are more frequent in childhood disabilities. Inquiry about these aspects of function should not be overlooked in taking the history. The necessity of regular hearing assessment was mentioned earlier. The same applies to visual function. Prenatal infections, anoxic or infectious encephalopathy, metabolic diseases, meningitis, hydrocephalus, and head injury warrant exploration of visual and auditory function. With the development of new antibiotics, acquired hearing deficit due to antibiotic use is not a significant concern. Like all children, handicapped youngsters are prone to a variety of childhood illnesses. In some cases, however, acute symptoms and febrile illnesses may be directly related to complications of a specific disability. Vomiting, headache, irritability, or lethargy may be prodromal signs of decompensating hydrocephalus in spina bifida, cerebral palsy (2), or an intercurrent unrelated illness. Recurrent headaches are also a manifestation of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, along with bowel or bladder distention. Fever may represent central hyperpyrexia in severe head injury or hyperthermia due to pseudomotor paralysis in high thoracic spinal cord injury. However, such conclusions can be reached only after other causes of fever have been excluded. In neurogenic bladder, urinary tract infection should always be investigated as a possible cause of febrile illness. A history of the usual pattern of the amount and frequency of voiding is essential in neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Systematic daily recording is a guide for bladder training. Fluid intake, in accordance with pediatric norms, needs to be monitored at home, and records of both bladder and bowel dysfunction should be available on the medical visit. Immunization history is part of all pediatric visits. Often, a disabled child in good health has not received the recommended vaccinations because of excessive concern on the part of the family or pediatrician. But it also may mean that the child has always looked ill when scheduled for immunization.\n\nHistory of Behavior The examiner should ask about the child’s behavior in terms of temperament and personality. The parents may state that the child was always a good baby, but this report may mean that the youngster never cried and slept more than expected for his or her age.\n\nIn other cases, parents may report excessive crying and restlessness while the child is awake and during sleep. Some children may show excessive mood swings from lethargy to hyperactivity, whereas others are even-tempered and react appropriately. One should ask the parents whether the child is friendly, outgoing, and sociable or shy and withdrawn, particularly in group situations. Parental guidance may be needed to encourage interactive behavior by the child. Compliance or problems with obedience, daily activity level, attention span, sleeping and eating habits, and special interests and dislikes are revealing information. Separation from the parents may be a problem for children with disability. The parents may be uncomfortable to leave the child with relatives or other caretakers. In this context, it is important to point out the need and methods to foster the child’s independence.\n\nEducational and Social History Very young children may be enrolled in an early intervention program, home- or center-based. Frequency, length of sessions, components of training, the child’s tolerance and cooperation in the program, and its effectiveness, as perceived by the parents, should be clarified. The same applies when the slightly older child attends a preschool program. In school-aged children, information about the type of class—mainstream, integrated, or special education—is important. Academic expectations are different in each of these educational pathways and should be taken into consideration when report card grades are interpreted. Individualized education program (IEP) meetings and environmental accommodations are other pertinent details. The child may have special interests and strengths that should be further developed or difficulties in certain subjects, which may require additional help and adjustment of the IEP. Review of educational status is a consistent part of follow-up visits, and assistance should be offered when problems arise. Opportunities to meet and play with other children in addition to school or home contacts, visits and sleepovers with friends, and participation in various recreational activities are formative experiences that prepare all youngsters for social functioning and adulthood. Asking the parents to describe the child’s daily schedule, including regular and occasional activities on weekdays and weekends, yields a valuable insight into these aspects of the entire family’s lifestyle. Time spent in school, therapy, homework, play, and leisure activities with family members, friends, or alone should be noted. Housing, employment of the parents, siblings and their ages, and social support of the family provide further understanding of the physical and social environment. Some families with a\n\nChapter 1\n\ndisabled child experience social isolation. Information about or referral to community resources is helpful in all cases.\n\nFamily History In motor or other developmental disabilities, a detailed family history must be obtained to rule out the possibility of an inheritable genetic disease. Health and function of the parents, siblings, and other family members on the maternal and paternal sides should be explored through several preceding generations. One should ask specifically whether there are other children in the family with developmental delay or adults with known motor disability, limb deficiency, or other malformations. Historical information is at times incomplete until further questioning brings to light additional facts. Family albums and pictures of relatives may be helpful to detect dysmorphic facial or other features. Consanguinity is an increased risk for genetic disease, including diseases with a recessive autosomal inheritance pattern. In some autosomaldominant conditions, mild variants of a disease may be missed until a thorough investigation of suspected family members is carried out. Congenital myotonic dystrophy and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy are examples. Affected males with familial history on the maternal side are typical of X-linked conditions. Multifactorial inheritance, such as spina bifida, creates a complex situation, with or without known familial history (2,7). Referral for genetic workup is necessary whenever a genetic condition is known or suspected. Pregnant mothers of affected children should be referred for genetic counseling; prenatal diagnostic tests for detection are also available.\n\nEXAMINATION This chapter provides only general guidelines for the format and structure of the pediatric rehabilitation examination at different ages. Specific details of diagnostic signs and interpretation of findings are discussed in subsequent chapters about different disabilities.\n\nObservation As emphasized previously, the examination begins as soon as the family and child enter the examination room, before the child is actually touched or asked to perform. Sometimes, it may be the most informative phase of the examination. Specific behaviors to observe and note include reaction to separation from the parents (in young children); apparent visual and auditory awareness; temperament (calm or hyperactive, compliant, or difficult);\n\nHistory and Examination\n\n5\n\nspontaneous exploration and interest in toys, games, or books in the room; style, concentration, attention span, or distractibility during play; level and manner of motor activities; attempts to engage the parents and the examiner in conversation, vocabulary, complexity of language, and quality of speech; and interaction with parents or examiner (appropriate, shy, or demanding). Observations of the parents’ response and their way of handling the child’s behavior are also revealing.\n\nExamination by Age For infants and young children, the examiner must create an atmosphere of trust. Friendly advances during history-taking or while the child is at play allay initial fears and anxiety. At this age, most, if not all, of the examination can be accomplished with the child in the parent’s lap if the child remains fearful. Interactive play in this phase of the examination can incorporate developmental testing by offering toys for grasping or raisins to test pincer grasp. Hearing, vision, cranial nerves, and postural abnormalities also can be observed. As the parent gradually undresses the child, gentle touch and tickling or funny sounds with a smile help to maintain relaxation and to facilitate hands-on examination. Inspection and palpation of body parts and gentle movements to examine tone are performed at this point. The examiner should be prepared to improvise if the child shows increasing anxiety. The actual hands-on examination, consisting of bodily handling and manipulation, is the last stage; anxiety-provoking or painful tests are deferred to the end. If the examination requires placement of the child on a table, the mother can sit at the end and let the child’s head rest in her lap. With anxious children, performance of gross motor activities, such as sitting, crawling, standing, or walking, also can be conducted through the parent. One should note the quality of movements, postures, weakness, incoordination, asymmetry, or reflex abnormalities that reflect a motor deficit. Range of motion, deep tendon reflexes, or primitive reflexes that need physical manipulation should be examined after evaluation of active mobility. Tests that require instrumentation, such as sensation, fundoscopy, otoscopy, and oral function, conclude the examination. Giving choices involves the preschool child in the examination. For example, the examiner may ask, “Should we look at your arm or leg now?” On the other hand, questions such as “Can I look at your arm?” should be avoided because if the child says “no,” confrontation results. Parents can often bring out many capabilities of their children without the examiner touching them.\n\n6\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\nSchool-aged and Adolescent Patients The customary method of systematic medical examination is applicable. Children with cognitive deficit need to be approached according to their mental rather than chronologic age. Children in this age group, particularly adolescents, are usually embarrassed about walking in underwear in front of their parents. Shorts or a bathing suit is more acceptable. Adolescents need to be seen with and without their parents. Their concerns may be different from those of the family and should be addressed with respect for their privacy. The scope of the examination is expanded to reflect the growing child’s increasing functional needs in activities of daily living (ADLs) and other areas of competence. A comprehensive examination includes screening in educational achievements, reading, writing, and arithmetic. Formal psychological or psychoeducational testing follows in case of deficits.\n\nGrowth Parameters of physical growth should be routinely measured on each visit and plotted on the standard growth chart. Height and weight are obtained at all ages, and head circumference is measured in children under three years and thereafter in children with deviations. Serial monitoring is necessary in hydrocephalus, regardless of etiology, and microcephaly, which reflects defective brain growth. In spina bifida and other disabilities that require full-time wheelchair use, arm span measurement is recommended instead of height (7). Extremity length and girth are recorded in children with localized growth disturbance due to neurogenic weakness, epiphyseal fracture, or arthritis. In growth disturbances that involve one side of the body, one must determine whether the condition represents hemihypertrophy or hemiatrophy. Hemihypertrophy unrelated to neurologic causes requires investigation for renal tumor.\n\nInspection General appearance and special features may help to establish a diagnostic entity. Dysmorphic facial features, epicanthal folds, increased intercanthal distance, external ear anomalies, and malformations of the toes or fingers suggest a prenatal disorder, possibly teratogenic or genetic, and at times, an identifiable syndrome (l0). Blue sclerae are a sign of osteogenesis imperfecta. Asymmetric facial and palpebral fissures and pupils may indicate facial palsy or Horner’s syndrome, whereas craniofacial asymmetry and vertical strabismus develop in torticollis. Dolichocephaly is typical in premature infants\n\nand children. A bald spot or area of short, thinning hair over the posterior skull is a sign of weak neck muscles, most likely associated with generalized weakness. Extraocular, facial, and tongue muscle weakness may represent cranial nerve dysfunction, myopathy, or other neurologic disease. Involuntary eye movements and nystagmus are noted in cerebellar or other CNS disorders. The skin should be inspected for telangiectasias, nevi, or other lesions. Cafe-au-lait spots or pigmented skin areas are seen in neurofibromatosis. In children with ataxia, telangiectasias are usually present over the flexor surface of the knees and elbows. Malar rash suggests a rheumatic disease. Adenomatous rash, seizures, and hemiplegia are present in tuberous sclerosis. Hairy patches, dimples, or other skin lesions over the spine are frequent signs of spina bifida occulta (7). A small sinus, dermal tract, or pylonidal cyst in the gluteal crease also may accompany occult spina bifida. Sudden weakness in such cases may indicate an infection penetrating into the spinal canal or a neurologic complication related to underlying malformation in or around the spinal cord. In children with sensory deficit, the entire area must be routinely examined for skin lesions, pressure abrasions, ulcerations, and infections. Foot deformities, varus or valgus deformity, or claw toes lead to abnormal weight distribution and callus formation consistent with the pathologic posture. Calluses over the dorsum of the feet and knees, the so-called “housemaid’s knee,” develop in older children whose preferred mode of locomotion is crawling. Multiple scars, bruises, and abrasions in various stages of healing may indicate frequent falls or child abuse. Asymmetry in the size of skeletal muscles should be noted in terms of location and distribution. Anterior axillary and upper chest muscle atrophy may represent absent pectoralis muscle or wasting due to an old brachial plexus injury. Congenital clubfeet or multiple joint deformities are manifestations of prenatal muscle weakness due to spina bifida, arthrogryposis, or myotonic dystrophy, or may be idiopathic. A hypertrophic, “muscle-bound” appearance is a sign of myotonic dystrophy. Deformed, fusiform, dimpled joints are seen in arthrogryposis. Lower extremity joint positions reflect the distribution of muscle weakness in newborns with spina bifida. Hypertrophy of the calf muscles is an early sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Hypertrophic musculature of the shoulder girdles and upper extremities is a convincing indication of functional crutch walking or effective wheelchair locomotion. An enlarged limb with bruit detectable by palpation or auscultation may signal an arteriovenous shunt and increased blood flow in the extremity.\n\nChapter 1\n\nFlaring of the ribs, or the so-called bell-shaped chest, suggests ineffective intercostal muscle function in children with motor unit disease or high spinal cord dysfunction. In scoliosis, the thoracic cage is asymmetric.\n\nPalpation In infants and young children, the fontanelles and cranial sutures should be palpated for patency, tension, and size with the child in sitting position and while the child is quiet and not crying. A tense fontanel in a vigorously crying child does not necessarily mean increased intracranial pressure. In case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the reservoir should be located and checked for ease of emptying and speed of refill. The skin should be felt for texture, temperature, and absent or excessive perspiration. Pseudomotor paralysis in spinal cord injury eliminates sweating below the level of the lesion, and compensatory excessive perspiration occurs above the level of the lesion with high environmental temperature. Vasomotor dysfunction with coldness to touch and paleness or slight cyanosis of the skin may be present in severe upper motor neuron impairment. It is seen in the lower extremities of some children with cerebral palsy. Subcutaneous abnormalities may be palpable, such as hard calcific deposits in dermatomyositis or neurofibromatous nodules along the course of peripheral nerves. When arthritis is suspected, each joint should be felt for the cardinal signs of inflammation, warmth, discomfort, and swelling due to synovial thickening and effusion. Much can be learned from palpation of muscles. Tone and bulk are reduced in lower motor neuron paralysis; in longstanding denervation, the muscle tissue feels less resilient and fibrotic. The pseudohypertrophic calf muscles in Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a typical rubbery, doughy, hard consistency. A fibrotic nodule is usually palpable in the sternocleidomastoid muscle in congenital torticollis. In an infant who has an isolated knee extension contracture, a palpable nodule in the quadriceps indicates fibrotic muscle changes at the site of previous repeated intramuscular injections. Localized pain and swelling accompany injuries to soft tissue or bone. Osteoporotic fractures in lower motor neuron lesions with sensory deficit show swelling but are painless. Tenderness in many muscle groups with weakness, fatigue, or skin rash is suspicious for myositis due to collagen disease or parasitic or viral infections.\n\nOrgan Systems Although the primary health care of children with disabilities remains the responsibility of the pediatrician,\n\nHistory and Examination\n\n7\n\nthe pediatric physiatrist should perform a selective general physical examination. The emphasis is placed on organ systems that are at increased risk in certain handicaps and may affect both overall health and successful rehabilitation. Vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, are obtained in all patients. In myopathies and collagen diseases, cardiac auscultation should be performed because of the possibility of associated heart disease. In a child with developmental delay, the presence of a heart murmur may suggest an undiagnosed syndrome. Blood pressure monitoring is particularly important in spinal cord injury, neurogenic bladder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and residual poliomyelitis, as well as in children receiving stimulant medications. In disabilities that cause ineffective ventilation and involve the risk of minor aspirations, auscultation of the lungs must be a routine procedure. Myopathies, thoracic spinal cord dysfunction due to injury or malformation, severe spastic quadriparetic cerebral palsy, and any disability with oral motor dysfunction are such indications. Abdominal and rectal examinations are essential in children with neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction to evaluate bladder distention, bowel or rectal impaction, and anal sphincter tone. Stool consistency, intermittent or continuous bladder incontinence, and gross appearance and microscopic examination of the urine should be noted. Umbilical movements in response to eliciting superficial abdominal reflexes help to delineate the spinal cord level in thoracic lesions. Absent abdominal muscles result in loose skin folds resembling a prune; hence, the name prune-belly syndrome.\n\nNeuromuscular System Examination of neuromuscular function consists of testing reflexes, tone, active motion, strength, and coordination. Limited understanding and cooperation in infants and young children requires adaptation of traditional methods of testing. After four to five years of age, the standard examination is generally applicable. In infancy, reflex testing includes age-appropriate responses that reflect early immaturity and subsequent maturation of the central nervous system. In newborns and young infants, state of alertness, activity, and comfort influence muscle tone (11–14). If the baby is anxious, upset, restless, or crying, this part of the examination should be postponed. Valid assessment may require several attempts. In the first few months of life, flexor tone predominates. Hypotonia or hypertonicity signals neurologic abnormalities. Increased tone is the symptom of corticospinal or basal ganglion\n\n8\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\ndamage. Myopathy, cerebellar dysfunction, and lower motor neuron lesions due to anterior horn disease, neuropathy, or spina bifida all can result in hypotonia. However, a hypotonic stage usually precedes the appearance of increased tone in perinatal anoxic brain damage (l5). This stage of hypotonicity tends to last longer in dyskinetic cerebral palsy than in spastic types. On passive motion of hypotonic muscles or extremities, no resistance is felt. The infant with generalized hypotonia is limp and floppy with handling and, in severe cases, may feel like a “rag doll”—a descriptive term for this finding. In hypotonia related to motor unit disease or lower motor neuron lesion, deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent. In contrast, they are present or increased in floppy infants during the transient hypotonic phase of central nervous system damage (l5). Spastic hypertonicity and related postures are influenced by position in space and the effect of gravity. The child should be examined in supine, prone, and vertical positions to elicit typical postures. Examples include increased scissoring, extension, and plantar flexion of the legs when a child with spastic cerebral palsy is suddenly lifted into vertical suspension. Resistance to both slow and fast stretching of muscle should be tested to differentiate rigidity from spasticity (l6). In infants and young children, one may use a number of developmental reflexes to examine active movements and strength (l7). The Moro reflex includes shoulder abduction followed by forward flexion of the arm. Eliciting palmar or plantar grasp reflexes demonstrates finger or toe flexor function. Asymmetric responses in the upper extremities may suggest Erb’s or Klumpke’s paralysis or hemiplegia. Unilateral or bilateral absence of protective extension response is likewise suggestive of weakness in the respective extremity. A four-month-old infant elevates the head and trunk on extended arms in the prone position. Scapular winging during this activity is a sign of a weak serratus anterior muscle (18). In older children, the wheelbarrow maneuver demonstrates the same finding (18). Lifting up under the axilla elicits spontaneous active shoulder depression. When these muscles are weak, the shoulders slide upward, virtually touching the ears. These signs suggest myopathy with proximal weakness. Young children often adopt ingenious substitutions or vicarious movements to cope with weakness of particular muscles. With weakness of the deltoid, they may fling the arm forward by momentum or substitute the long head of the biceps for shoulder flexion. In advanced shoulder and elbow weakness, they may “walk up” the arm on the torso, using their fingers to get the hand to the mouth. Combat crawl is a usual way of crawling in lower extremity paralysis. Deformities around a joint reflect an imbalance of strength in\n\nmuscles acting on the joint. The deformity or deviation is in the direction of over-pull. Such imbalance may be spastic or paralytic. Visual observation during performance of functional activities to detect muscle weakness should consider the child’s age and the achievements expected for the child’s developmental stage. Walking on tiptoes, squatting and rising without using the arms for assistance, and straight sitting up from the supine position without rolling to the prone position or to the side are mastered by children around three years of age (19). Thus, inability of younger children to perform these activities in a mature pattern should not be interpreted as weakness of the plantar flexors, hip and knee extensors, or abdominal muscles. Testing for Trendelenburg’s sign and grading the triceps surae by having the child rise on the toes of one leg must be deferred until four years of age, when children develop adequate balance. The standard technique of manual muscle testing can be used after school age, except in children who have serious behavioral problems or mental retardation (20–23). The customary grading system of scores from 0–5 or zero to normal is used. Above fair grade, the wide range of normal variations in growth patterns should be considered in judging good versus normal strength. Because children are adept in using substitution movements, the examiner must pay special attention and adhere to precise technical conduct of testing individual muscles. Side-to-side comparison may detect even mild neurologic weakness, although disuse atrophy or mild bilateral neurologic weakness may escape detection. Quantitative strength determination with comparison of both sides is helpful to demonstrate unilateral disuse atrophy in such strong muscles as the quadriceps. This determination is particularly advisable in teenage athletes after knee injury. Resumption of training for competition before virtually equal bilateral quadriceps strength is regained predisposes to recurrent injuries. Testing of strength in upper motor neuron lesions requires the well-known considerations for position in space and orientation of head and major joints, which may affect recruitment of motor units and produce synergistic movement patterns. A common sign of central movement disorders is impaired coordination. Proprioceptive sensory loss or parietal lobe syndrome may contribute to incoordination. Movement abnormalities associated with cerebellar dysfunction, basal ganglion disease, dyskinetic disorders, or spastic incoordination present with specific distinguishing signs. Detection of coordination deficit is based mostly on observation of gross and fine motor function in children less than two to three years of age. Concurrent mild delay of motor development is not unusual. After three years of age, the examination\n\nChapter 1\n\nbecomes more specific for testing the quality of performance in complex and more advanced developmental skills. Around three years of age, the child can walk along a straight line, unsteadily placing one foot in front of the other. In comparison, facility at tandem walking at five years of age is a good illustration of continuing refinement of motor skills with age. The pediatric physiatrist may be asked to evaluate the appropriateness of coordination in children without an overt physical disability (24). Clumsiness of handwriting and drawing, difficulties in physical education or sports, and other subtle signs may be present. Such children may have a motor incompetence of apraxic nature, sometimes related to visuomotor perceptual deficit (25). It also may be associated with learning and behavioral dysfunction. A number of tests are available for examining motor proficiency and dexterity in children without physical disability (26,27). Tasks to evaluate youngsters with minor neurologic dysfunction include imitation of gestures (28), hopping (29), hand-clapping (30), and pegboard performance (31,32).\n\nMusculoskeletal System Examination of the musculoskeletal system includes inspection and palpation of bones and soft tissues, measurement of active and passive joint range of motion, and assessment of stance and gait (33–36). It is complementary to neuromuscular assessment. As in previous parts of this chapter, only developmental variations are discussed. Bone configuration and joint mobility change during the growing years (37,38). Full-term infants may lack as much as 25 degrees of elbow extension because of predominant flexor tone. In contrast, joint hyperextensibility and hypotonia allow increased passive motion in preterm infants. The scarf sign is a good illustration of excessive joint mobility in premature babies. Holding the infant’s hand, the examiner draws one arm across the chest, like a scarf, toward the contralateral shoulder. In premature infants, the elbow crosses the midline, indicating hypotonic laxity of the shoulder and elbow joints. Full-term neonates have incomplete hip extension with an average limitation of 30 degrees as a result of early flexor tone predominance (37,38). The limitation decreases to less than 10 degrees by three to six months. At birth and during early infancy, hip external rotation exceeds internal rotation (37,39). With the resolution of early hip flexion attitude, internal rotation gradually increases. Differences between bilateral hip abduction, apparent shortening of one leg, and asymmetric gluteal and upper thigh skin folds are highly suggestive of congenital or acquired hip dysplasia or dislocation (38). Alignment of the femoral neck in\n\nHistory and Examination\n\n9\n\nneonates is consistent with prenatal coxa valga and increased anteversion. Femoral inclination is 160 degrees, and the angle of anteversion is 60 degrees. Respective adult measurements of 125 and 10 to 20 degrees develop postnatally and are accelerated by weight bearing. Persistent fetal configuration in nonambulatory children with physical disabilities enhances the effect of neurogenic muscle imbalance on the hip joint and contributes to acquired hip dislocation in spina bifida and cerebral palsy. The popliteal angle is 180 degrees in the hypotonic preterm infant, compared with 90 degrees in full-term neonates. A combination of increased flexor tone and retroversion of the proximal tibia causes this limitation of knee extension in mature newborns. By 10 years, tibial retroversion resolves spontaneously. An early varus configuration of the tibia contributes to the physiologic bowleg appearance in infancy and corrects itself by two to three years of age. A systematic review of skeletal development, with examination of the spine and extremities, is presented in Chapter 14. Normal variations of stance and gait should not be mistaken for pathology in the growing child (35,40,41). Gait abnormalities evident on clinical observation include asymmetric stride length and stance phase in hemiparesis; toe walking and scissoring with lower extremity spasticity; crouch posture and gait in diplegic cerebral palsy; Trendelenburg’s gait in motor unit diseases and hip dislocation; gastrocnemius limp with lack of push-off in L4–L5 weakness due to spina bifida; and various types of gait deviations associated with involuntary movements, such as ataxia, tremor, or dyskinesias, in dysfunction of the central nervous system.\n\nSensory Examination A complete examination of all peripheral sensory modalities is possible only in older children(42). Nevertheless, some modalities can be tested in infants and young children, and provide significant information. An infant who cries and squirms to move away from pinprick obviously perceives pain(43). A sleepy infant may be slow to respond and requires repeated stimuli. Withdrawal of the leg from painful stimuli may represent the triple flexion spinal withdrawal reflex in thoracic spinal cord lesion and should not be mistaken for active movement and presence of sensation. Comparing the infant’s reaction to pinprick on the arms or face differentiates actual sensory perception in such cases. Older infants respond to touch and vibration by turning toward or moving away from the stimulus. Presence of superficial reflexes signals an intact afferent and efferent reflex arc. The neurosegmental levels are T8–T12 for abdominal reflexes,\n\n10\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\nL1–L2 for the cremasteric reflex, and S4–S5 for the anocutaneous reflex. In spina bifida, absence of these reflexes generally coincides with sensory deficit in the respective dermatomes. In young children who cannot be tested for proprioceptive function, ataxia and incoordination may suggest absence of this sensation. Testing of position sense is usually reliable by school age. Cortical sensory function is impaired in parietal lobe damage (42,44). The most frequent childhood example is hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Disproportionately poor spontaneous function, neglect, and visual monitoring during use of the arm and hand are suspicious signs. Objective evaluation is generally feasible after five to six years of age, using the same technique as in adults for stereognosis, two-point discrimination (45). and topognosia with single or double sensory stimulation. Testing for graphesthesia may be attempted by using a circle or square. Around eight years of age, the traditional number identification gives more accurate information. Cutaneous sensation and proprioception must be intact, and adequate cognitive ability is a prerequisite for testing cortical sensory function. The child’s age and ability to cooperate need to be considered in the examination of special senses. Moving a bright light or attractive object across the visual field is used to test vision in infants. At one month, the infant will follow to midline and at three months, from side to side through a 180-degree arc. The Stycar test and the illiterate E chart are used for screening preschool children at risk for visual deficit (46,47). At an early age, unilateral impairment or loss of vision and visual field defects, such as hemianopsia, are more likely to remain undetected than bilateral deficits. A child with strabismus or suspicion of diminished vision should see an ophthalmologist as soon as the problems are discovered. Early treatment with eye patching or corrective lenses is necessary to prevent amblyopia ex anopsia (48,49). Central dysfunction of visual attentiveness, discrimination, and information processing may be misinterpreted as diminished vision and require both ophthalmologic and neuropsychologic investigation. Screening of auditory function is a routine procedure in the neonatal nursery, pediatric office, and school. The examination of handicapped infants and children also should include simple screening of hearing, eliciting the blink or startle reflex. Responses by hand clapping to speech of conversational loudness or whisper; perception of finger rubbing near the ear; and reaction to tuning fork, bell, or cricket toy are methods of testing. Absent, lost, or delayed speech, articulation deficits, inattentiveness to sound, a history of recurrent otitis media, head injury, or failure to pass the screening test indicates a need for complete evaluation of auditory function (43,48,50,51).\n\nFunctional Evaluation The pediatric rehabilitation examination is meaningless if the physiatrist does not construct from it a coherent picture of the child’s functional achievements. This evaluation both complements and integrates the variety of information derived from all phases of the examination. The developmental diagnostic evaluation is a convenient, functionally oriented assessment tool for infants and preschool children (19,52). Language, fine motor and adaptive skills, gross motor abilities, and personal–social behavior are the four major areas of function in the organizational framework of developmental testing. The same functional domains are considered in the evaluation of older children and adolescents. However, in these age groups, the examination includes a wider range of developmental expectations and abilities to function in school and society. ADLs and gross mobility skills need to be assessed in this context. In addition to speech, testing of language function includes other modes of communication: reading, writing, spelling, and, if indicated, augmentative communication. Drawing, design construction, arithmetic problems, and questions about handling hypothetical situations in daily life offer a brief, preliminary insight into cognitive and learning abilities. A number of specific assessment instruments were designed for various childhood disabilities (53–56). These instruments are useful functional assessment tools for their designated conditions and appropriately complement the customary developmental evaluation.\n\nINFORMING INTERVIEW Informing the family about the findings of the examination and their implications is an important responsibility of the physician. Factual information must be imparted with a caring attitude. Informing the parents about a newly established diagnosis should be considered as crisis intervention. A diagnostic label is insufficient without explanation of its meaning. The parents need to know the estimated prognosis, including the uncertainties of early prognostication, particularly in central nervous system dysfunction, with the possibility of multiple handicaps. Future needs in care and functional rehabilitation should be outlined. One should emphasize the need to avoid focusing on the physical disability alone and to consider the child’s developmental and social needs. Effective counseling and communication skills are essential for establishing a partnership between the physician and family to ensure the successful outcome of a comprehensive rehabilitation program.\n\nChapter 1\n\nREFERENCES 1.

Apkon and Deirdre Arnholz\n\nChildren with special health care needs (CSHCN) are those children who have been or are at risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally(1). An estimated 12.8% of children in the United States had a special health care need in 2001(2). Due to the large number of CSHCN, primary care providers (PCP) and pediatric subspecialists care for this complicated group of children on a regular basis. Routine health maintenance visits are frequently omitted in favor of visits for acute illnesses, which can result in a failure to discuss routine health care issues, such as growth and development, immunizations, vision, hearing, and dental care. Evaluation of children during an acute illness can pose unique challenges to care providers relating to many factors, including extensive past medical and surgical histories, lengthy lists of medications, and the lack of typical signs and symptoms normally present during a typical childhood illness. This chapter will focus on a discussion of the provision of medical care to CSHCN using a medical home model, the routine health maintenance issues for children with disabilities, and the common acute medical issues that a PCP may be asked to evaluate in this group of children. Finally, this chapter will discuss the issue of palliative care for children with special health care needs.\n\nMEDICAL HOME The concept of a medical home has long been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics as the optimal model for the provision of primary care for all children. As defined in 1992, a medical home should provide care that is “accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, and compassionate. It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who are able to manage or facilitate essentially all aspects of patient care. The physician should be known to the child and family, and should be able to develop a relationship of mutual responsibility and trust with them” (3,4). The provision of “culturally effective” care is an additional mandate of a medical home. Given the multiplicity of the needs of CSHCN, access to a medical home, as defined previously, is of critical importance. Beyond the provision of acute and routine medical care, the medical home can provide both “vertical links” within the medical community and “horizontal links” to the wider community. Within such a network, families should feel that they have a supportive, effective, informed, and caring network to rely on to help them meet the acute, chronic, and often unanticipated problems of a child with special health care needs. Within the medical community, families rely on the primary care physician to make appropriate referrals to and communicate with the multiple subspecialists\n\n14\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\nwho also provide care to many of these children. It can be of enormous benefit to have a designated individual in the office or clinic who is able to coordinate multiple appointments on the same day, thus lessening the burden of travel for these families. Having translator services available, as well as written materials in the family’s primary language, is an additional benefit. Children with special health care needs often require therapeutic as well as supportive services. Examples of therapeutic services include home nursing; physical, occupational, or speech therapy; and in some cases, mental health services. Supportive services may include the provision of letters of medical necessity, assistance with transportation, acquisition of durable medical equipment, provision of information regarding financial entitlements and respite care, connections to community support groups, and communication with schools. Care coordination can and should be facilitated by knowledgeable individuals within the medical home, typically experienced registered nurses (RNs) and social workers. The provision of such services can play a pivotal role in decreasing the care burden on the family, promoting maximal independence of the child and enabling full participation in community life. The medical home has additionally been described as an effective model for implementing a successful transition to adult medical care as children with special health care needs age.\n\nROUTINE HEALTH MAINTENANCE Children with special health care needs see their PCP more frequently than a typical child. (5) Many of the visits are for routine care, such as well-child checks, immunizations, and school and sports physicals. Routine visits, however, can often be redirected quickly toward a disease-specific focused discussion. Although important, the basic well-child visit is no longer the focus. It is important for the PCP to ensure that routine health care needs are being addressed, even if it means that a second appointment is scheduled. The following are examples of health care topics that should be addressed during routine visits.\n\nGrowth and Nutrition Assessment of growth is a basic element of the routine physical examination of children. Routine care in a typical child becomes a challenge when dealing with a child with a disability. Length, weight, and head circumference should be obtained at each health maintenance visit in the very young child, and length and weight should be obtained for the older child. Obtaining a weight on a child who is unable to stand on the office scale is often accomplished by\n\nhaving parents hold the child while stepping on the scale themselves. This is more effective in a smaller child, but is more difficult in a larger child or one with severe spasticity or hypotonia. It is recommended that an office who cares for large numbers of children who are nonambulatory obtain a wheelchair scale, which allows the child to be weighed easily in his or her own wheelchair. Assessment of the length of a child is also problematic when the ability to stand is limited. Use of arm span as a substitution for height may be an acceptable option. Alternatives to standing height also include individual measurements of lower extremity segments when significant joint contractures are present. To obtain segmental measurements, the child is placed in the supine position on the examination table and the assessment is done by adding all of the measurements obtained from the head to pelvis, the pelvis to knees, and knees to feet. Use of knee height has also been used as another means of monitoring a child’s growth (6–8). Plotting a child’s anthropometric data on a growth chart will allow the PCP to track a child’s nutritional status. A weight-to-length ratio below the fifth percentile may represent failure to thrive. However, growth velocity is the more important piece of information. Many children with disabilities will be below the fifth percentile for their age, but as long as their weight and length increase in parallel to a normal curve, growth may be appropriate. A child’s age should be corrected for prematurity until 2 years of age. One must remember that some children with special health care needs have short stature as part of their disease process or syndrome. Special growth charts are available for children with Down’s syndrome and Turner syndrome (9,10). A nutritional assessment should be completed during routine health maintenance visits. When there is concern about a child’s growth, a more careful investigation into the food intake is necessary. The amount, variety, and consistency of food eaten may provide the examiner with information regarding the caloric intake of the child. The amount of food eaten is important, but the amount of time it takes a child to complete a meal also is essential. It is not unusual for a child with severe cerebral palsy or an infant with spinal muscular atrophy to eat a meal over a prolonged period. The amount of energy that is expended during this lengthy meal may cost more in energy expenditure than is actually gained in caloric intake. Additional information that is important to obtain includes how safe the child appears while eating. This is best achieved by watching an infant or child eat or drink during their routine visit. Signs and symptoms of feeding problems include coughing or choking while eating, a wet vocal quality during or after the meal, poor sucking, gagging easily, and vomiting after a meal. A referral to\n\nChapter 2\n\na comprehensive feeding clinic should be considered if there is a concern about the weight of the child or his or her safety while eating. An interdisciplinary clinic may include an occupational and speech therapist, nutritionist, physiatrist, gastroenterologist, and/ or developmental or rehabilitation physician.\n\nImmunizations Routine immunization against childhood diseases should be recommended for all children with disabilities. The most current schedule can be obtained through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians. (11) Special consideration must be given to children with special health care needs. Although children with disabilities are not necessarily at higher risk for contracting childhood infections, they may have greater morbidity when ill with one of these infections. One of the more controversial subjects is administration of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) or measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine to children with a personal or family history of seizures. Administration of these vaccines can increase the risk of seizures in this group of children (12). The seizures are typically short in duration, generalized, self-limited, and associated with a fever. Because the pertussis immunization is given during infancy, the onset of a seizure after the vaccine can be confusing. Frequently, parents implicate the vaccine as the cause of a new-onset seizure disorder, such as infantile spasms, when in fact, the association is coincidental. It is recommended that the DTaP be delayed until a complete neurologic evaluation is completed and the cause of the seizure determined. The MMR, on the other hand, is not recommended to be withheld, even with a recent history of seizure, because it is typically first given after the onset of infantile seizures and the etiology of the seizure is generally already known. Special attention should be given to children who are immunocompromised. Children with physical disabilities, such as those with rheumatologic diseases and Duchenne muscular dystrophy who are on chronic corticosteroids, are included in this special population. In general, it is not recommended that children who are immunocompromised from corticosteroid use receive live bacterial or viral vaccines. Although definitive guidelines do not exist, the current Red Book recommendation is that children receiving high doses of systemic corticosteroids given daily or on alternative days for more than 14 days not receive live-virus vaccines until 1 month after the discontinuation of the medications. High-dose corticosteroids are defined by receiving >2 mg/kg per day or >20 mg/day if the\n\nMedical Care of Children with Disabilities\n\n15\n\nchild weighs more than 10 kg. In the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it is recommended that children receive all of their immunizations prior to the initiation of corticosteroids (13). Immunization against influenza of CSHCN, families, and medical providers on a yearly basis is critical to decrease the potential devastating morbidity and mortality associated with this virus. Chemoprophylaxis during an influenza outbreak is also recommended to decrease the ongoing spread. Influenza immunization of all high-risk children older than 6 months of age and their close contacts should be strongly encouraged each fall (14). High-risk children being seen in the rehabilitation clinics should include those with recurrent pneumonias or upper respiratory infections and those with neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), congenital myopathies, and muscular dystrophies. Children who may have increased risk from complications due to pneumococcal disease should receive the pneumococcal conjugate and/or polysaccharide vaccine (12).\n\nDental Tooth decay is one of the most common diseases of childhood (15). Tooth decay and poor dental hygiene in children with disabilities is related to swallowing problems, drooling, and gastroesophageal reflux. The administration of medications with sweeteners to make the taste more palatable or those that cause gingival hyperplasia such as phenytoin also contribute to tooth decay. Routine dental care of a child or adolescent with severe developmental disabilities may be challenging for parents and caregivers due to an oral aversion, a tonic bite reflex, or the inability of the child to follow instructions to open his or her mouth. Other daily care activities, such as administration of multiple medications or respiratory treatments, may make dental hygiene less of a priority. Once a child takes over the care of his or her own teeth, the quality of cleaning may not be optimal because of cognitive and physical limitations. Dental health of children with cerebral palsy (CP) compared to children with other disabilities is most frequently described in the literature. The incidence of dental caries in children with CP is similar to the general population, although the quality of the caries is different. The size of the carious lesions is greater than what is seen in typical children (16–18). Periodontal disease is more prevalent in children with CP compared to their typical peers, likely due to the presence of gingival hyperplasia from phenytoin administration (19). Malocclusion and developmental enamel defects were also more common in children with CP (20–24). Erosion of primary and permanent teeth has been attributed to chronic gastroesophageal (GE) reflux.\n\n16\n\nPediatric Rehabilitation\n\nThe severity of erosion has been correlated with the duration of the GE reflux disease, frequency of vomiting, pH of the acid, and the quality and quantity of saliva (25–28). Despite the fact that children with CP don’t participate in high-risk activities as frequently as their able-bodied peers, dental trauma is more common (29,30). These injuries, most commonly to the maxillary incisors, are related to trauma during transfers or falls. There is little information about dental problems for children with spina bifida. An important issue that must be addressed at each visit is to ensure that the dental office or operating room provide a latex-free environment (31). Families may need to remind the dentist and hygienist of the child’s risk for an allergic reaction to latex. Latex-free gloves must be available to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can have malocclusion with anterior and posterior open bites, which are associated with lip incompetence, mouth breathing, and macroglossia. Deteriorating oral muscle function as the child gets older is associated with increased plaque and calculus formation and gingival inflammation, but not necessarily with the presence of dental caries (32,33). Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a greater risk of malignant hyperthermia when anesthesia is used for dental care (34,35). Routine examinations and cleaning to maintain optimal dental hygiene should be performed by a dentist comfortable in the care of children with special needs. Some of the dental care may need to be accomplished under anesthesia in order to obtain the maximum benefit. Combining dental procedures with other necessary procedures, such as a brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER), local intramuscular injections with phenol or botulinum toxin, or certain orthopedic procedures, may limit the exposure to anesthetic agents. The American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on oral heath care states that children with special health care needs be referred to a dentist as early as 6 months of age and no later than 6 months after the eruption of their first tooth, or 12 months of age (whichever comes first) (36). Visits will provide the dentist with the opportunity to provide specific education to the family to allow for optimal dental care.\n\nVision Vision screening and eye examination should be a component of all routine health care visits. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the evaluation begin in the newborn period and then at all subsequent visits, with the goal of identifying conditions that might result in visual impairments or represent serious systemic diseases (37). In the child with a disability, this is especially important, given the frequent\n\nassociation of visual disorders with neurologic diseases. The eye evaluation from birth to 3 years should include a vision assessment, which is accomplished by having the infant or young child fix on an object. The examiner assesses the child’s ability to maintain the fixation and follow the object into different gaze positions, a skill that by 3 months of age is developmentally appropriate. Further evaluations of the young child should also include external inspection of the eye and lids, pupillary and red reflex examination, and ocular alignment. Assessment of the child older than 3 years should also include age-appropriate visual acuity measurements and an attempt at ophthalmoscopy. Ophthalmologic disorders frequently seen in children with cerebral palsy require very close follow-up with an ophthalmologist (38). Annual evaluation for cataracts should be completed in children with myotonic dystrophy or those on chronic corticosteroids, such as boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or a child with a juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (13,39). Detailed and accurate documentation of the ophthalmologic examination of a child with spina bifida can be helpful when assessing possible ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunctions. For example, a malfunctioning VP shunt may cause papilledema or changes in extraocular movements. These are early indications that may manifest prior to more obvious signs, such as headaches or lethargy. The eye examination of a child with a disability is best performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist due to the child’s high risk for ophthalmologic problems. The ophthalmologists have the skill needed to obtain a thorough assessment. A referral to a pediatric ophthalmologist for specialized tests, such as an electroretinogram (ERG), may be useful in assisting with the diagnosis of rare neurologic conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases.\n\nHearing Newborn hearing screening is standard of care in the United States. In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed the implementation of a universal newborn hearing screening program (40). Two technologies are used for newborn hearing screening: brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). It is important that all newborns be screened and is particularly imperative for children with disabilities. Periodic reassessments of children with disabilities are important, since a hearing impairment can significantly affect their developmental skills. Primary care providers should pay special attention to children with specific disabilities, as they are at greater risk for developing hearing loss. For example, children with Down’s syndrome are at increased risk\n\nChapter 2\n\nof otitis media and concomitant transient conductive hearing loss (41). Children with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV), both symptomatic and asymptomatic at birth, are at risk for progressive and late-onset hearing loss (42). Children with athetoid cerebral palsy due to kernicterus have a high incidence of hearing loss, as do children who have been treated with ototoxic antibiotics for systemic infections (43,44).\n\nACUTE ILLNESS IN THE PRIMARY CARE OFFICE Children with disabilities present to primary care providers with the same childhood illnesses of their typical peers, but the presenting signs and symptoms may be quite different. Medical personnel who care for these children need to be acutely aware of these differences in order to accurately and efficiently diagnosis and treat the acute illness. It is important that the primary care providers understand the diseasespecific complications and how they may present. Referring to previous medical records can be helpful in determining the unique issues for a particular child. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides specialized forms for families and medical personnel to maintain an up-to-date record of a child’s medical history, current medications, past medical complications and how they typically present, and a treatment plan based on presenting signs and symptoms (45). An up-to-date form can provide medical care providers information in a critical situation. The following section reviews specific acute and chronic complications and strategies for the primary care provider when approaching a child with special health care needs in order to facilitate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nRespiratory Complications Drooling Difficulty in managing oral secretions in children with disabilities results from poor oral motor control. Parents may express concern over their child’s drooling, frequent cough, or increased upper airway congestion. Management of drooling can be pharmacologic or surgical. Treatment is recommended when drooling causes significant skin irritation, social problems, or the child is having recurrent respiratory infections secondary to poor secretion management (46). When oral secretions are copious"
