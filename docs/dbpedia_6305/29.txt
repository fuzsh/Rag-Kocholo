Welcome to my War Aircraft Replicas (WAR) P-47D Thunderbolt project website. This project started by in 1976 and was progressed nicely until mid-1980's when it was moth-balled to raise a family. Now the project's been re-started and is actively being worked.

I'll be updating this website with pictures from the past as well as new photos as the project nears completion.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
