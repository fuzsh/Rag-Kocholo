        "text": "Gautam Menon is presently busy shooting Neethane En Ponvasantham starring Jiiva and Samantha. Isaignani Ilayaraja has composed music for the film. In an interview Gautam shared his experience working with the maestro. He said when he approached Ilayaraja and told him the story and mentioned his requirement, the maestro immediately came up with a number of tunes. The director said he was totally awestruck. He asked Ilayaraja to take it slowly as it was too much for the director to take in. But the maestro was in no mood to stop.\n\nGautam said that the maestro composed all the eight tracks with his Harmonium and made Na Muthukumar write the lyrics. Then he made the singers sing the songs and took the tracks to London. In a matter of 16 days, he completed recording all the 8 songs along with the Hungarian Symphony group in an ultra modern studio.\n\nGautam Menon has said that the songs have come out beautifully and assured that the album would be a chartbuster."
