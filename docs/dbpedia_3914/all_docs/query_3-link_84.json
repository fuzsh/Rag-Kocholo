        "meta_description": "Another urban romantic drama from GVM, this time featuring Jeeva and Samantha, who share a great chemistry. The first half is breezy, evoking a lot of nostalgia with 90s styled school and college love portions. The second half is all about the love-hate drama, which rather feels forced and less engaging at places. The comedy portions of Santhanam were enjoyable. The soundtrack from Ilayaraja was a treat, with Vaanam mella being my favorite. It ends up a mixed package of some brilliant moments and few predictable cliches.",
