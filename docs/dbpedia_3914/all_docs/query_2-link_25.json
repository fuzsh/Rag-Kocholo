        "text": "National Film award-winning director Vetrimaaran has reportedly cast Tamil comedian Soori as the lead in his next film, that is expected to be a big-budget laugh riot and entertainer. This is a far departure for the filmmaker who is lauded for his intense work in films like Aadukalam, Visaranai and the recent hit Vada Chennai.\n\nThe film will be produced by Elred Kumar, who has produced several successful films like Vinnai Thaandi Varuvaya, Ko, Neethane En Ponvasantham and Yaamirukka Bayamaen on behalf of R S Infotainment.\n\nThis will be Soori’s first film in the lead role, after nearly a two decade-long career that has seen him begin with uncredited roles to becoming the main protagonist’s regular sidekick. Fans fondly remember his popular ‘Parotta’ comedy that catapulted him into fame, and success followed with many films such as Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam, Rajini Murugan and Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran to mention a few.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetrimaaran is busy with the shooting of Dhanush’s Asuran that also marks the Tamil debut of Malayam actor Manju Warrier, and stars others such as Pasupathy, Prakash Raj and Yogi Babu. Asuran is based on the novel Vekkai.\n\nVetrimaaran and Dhanush also have the sequel to Vada Chennai in the works, confirmed by the latter himself on Twitter when he posted, “Don’t know what caused this confusion among my fans. Vadachennai part 2 is very much on , Unless you see any official confirmation from my Twitter handle please do not believe in rumours regarding any project of mine. Thank you. Love you.”"
