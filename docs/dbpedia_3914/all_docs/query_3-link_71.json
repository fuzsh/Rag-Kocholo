        "text": "Gautham Menon is back with what he is best at, a breezy romantic entertainer. Post `Vinnaithandi Varuvaya' the director helmed `Nadunisi Naigal' much to the shock of audience thanks to its gory content. The director is now back with a romantic film which is a trilingual in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi with Samantha Prabhu as the lead lady in all three versions.\n\nNEP starring Jiiva and Samantha has music by Ilaiyaraja and the first look teaser of the film has already become a rage among the young with Jiiva singing a yesteryear hit of Ilayaraja and Samantha falling for him. It will be interesting to watch Ilayaraja pair up with Gautham who is known for stylish visuals.\n\nSet in a campus, it's said to be a romantic entertainer with a different take on love. When quizzed if the film will be in the line of `VTV', Gautham rubbished it and expressed that NEP has a stronger and a different take on love and romance. It is also widely buzzed that the lead will be shown in three stages of life in this film.\n\nComing from top class technicians, crew and cast, NEP is one of the most eagerly awaited projects this year. It is slated for a 2012 summer release.\n\nThis could, indeed, be your love story!"
