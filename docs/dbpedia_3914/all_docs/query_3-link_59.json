        "text": "It seems fans of Harris Jayaraj and Gautham Menon will have to wait for some more time to see their favourite music director and director work together again. For, music director Harris Jayaraj has refuted rumours that he is scoring the music for Gautham Vasudev Menon’s next film, Neethane En Ponvasantham (NEP).\n\nThough there has been no official word about who is to compose music for the film yet, there was speculation that AR Rahman might score music for the trilingual, which is being made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. As Rahman is busy with overseas projects, there were rumours that Gautham had approached Harris for the film.\n\nHowever, the music director refuted all such rumours. He said, “Nothing like that happened. I’m not aware of the whole issue.” Vaaranam Aayiram was the last movie in which Harris Jayaraj and Gautham Menon worked together. After that, the music director and Gautham parted ways. However, they became close again and Gautham even performed in Harris Jayaraj’s stage show titled, Harris On The Edge, giving hope to fans of both technicians that the two would work together again.\n\nHarris said that he is currently busy scoring background music for Nanban, the audio of which is to be launched on December 15 at the Nehru Indoor Stadium. Bollywood actor Aamir Khan is also expected to participate in it."
