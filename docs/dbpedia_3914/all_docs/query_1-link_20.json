Voices of Youth Violence — edited by Miles Harvey, with a foreward from Alex Kotlowitz (bestselling author of There are No Children Here and co-producer of the film The Interrupters) — shares stories and perspectives of Chicago residents who have been affected by violence.\n\nWebsite: http://bigshouldersbooks.com/how-long-will-i-cry\n\nVimeo: http://vimeo.com/73977419\n\nThe book is published by Big Shoulders Books, which aims to produce one book a year “that engages intimately with the Chicago community.” The goal is to share quality anthologies FREE OF CHARGE so that they can “make small but meaningful contributions to discussions of injustice and inequality in Chicago, as well as to celebrate the tremendous resilience and creativity found in all areas of the city.”\n\nThus, if you get your hands on a copy of this book, read it, discuss it, and pass it on! Request a copy here.\n\nThe publisher/editors also ask that readers take some time to support groups working on anti-violence efforts in Chicago. A list of organizations — including Alternatives, Inc.! — can be found in the Resource Guide at the back of the book (p.229)."
