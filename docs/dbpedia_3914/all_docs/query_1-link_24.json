        "text": "Biography\n\nLlewellyn Anthony Gonsalvez (born 11 September 1973) is an Indian film editor from Tamil Nadu. He was introduced to cinema through film director Gautham Vasudev Menon in the film Kaakha Kaakha (2003).\n\nHe continued to collaborate with Gautham V. Menon by Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006), Pachaikili Muthucharam (2007), Vaaranam Aayiram (2008), Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), Neethaane En Ponvasantham (2012), Yennai Arindhaal (2015), Achcham Yenbadhu Madamaiyada (2016) and Vendhu Thanindhathu Kaadu (2022).\n\nFollowing the success of these films, director Shankar collaborated with him through Enthiran (2010). He has worked in over two hundred Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Hindi and Kannada films. He is the editor for India's most expensive feature film 2.0 (2018).\n\nAnthony studied for a degree in literature at Madras Christian College, Tambaram, but found himself unsure of a career path once he had finished his education. Following suggestions from his friends, he began learning about animation at Prasad Studio and subsequently enrolled to learn about editing.\n\nHe thereafter received offers to work on corporate ads, trailers, and documentaries from 1993 for Edit Point and continued to work in the same practice till 2004, often collaborating with leading ad filmmakers like Rajiv Menon.\n\nHe then began to work on editing songs in films occasionally, also gaining experience by editing telefilms. Director Gautham Vasudev Menon asked Anthony to edit the song \"Ennai Konjam\" in Kaakha Kaakha for the audio release event of that film. Impressed with his work for that song, he asked him to sign on as the film's editor.\n\nHe has since associated with major directors in Tamil cinema, collaborating regularly with directors including Shankar, AR Murugadoss, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Linguswamy, K. V. Anand, and A. L. Vijay.\n\nAnthony has also nurtured an ambition to direct films and began pre-production on a comedy film titled Jagathalapradhaban in November 2008 featuring Jayaram, Yuhi Sethu, and Namitha. The film, however, failed to take off."
