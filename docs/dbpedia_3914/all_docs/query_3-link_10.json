        "text": "NEP is strictly for VTV fans\n\nGautham Menon decides to narrate the story in a linear fashion without any gimmicks. He goes through 4 episodes of Varun and Nithya's life (childhood, high school, college and work). In all these situations, they break-up due to minor squabbles.(more)\n\nSource: Editorial Board, MovieCrow\n\nNEP has its bright moments, but should have been more engaging\n\nSongs of Ilayaraja propel the story forward but for a generation that is edgy and attention challenged, the numerous tracks prove to be a definite distraction.(more)\n\nSource: Behindwoods Review Board, Behindwoods.com\n\nIntense love story\n\nIt is Jiiva and Samantha the lead pair who carries the film with effortless charm and sweetness.

Prabhu, the editing by Antony and the lyrics by Na. Muthukumar all contribute handsomely. (more)\n\nSource: Karthik Subramanian, The Hindu\n\nAn ideal date movie, despite the slow pace and the flaws\n\nMenon has constructed the film almost as a musical, with Ilaiyaraaja's tuneful songs really driving many of its plot points, including the lovely early segment involving Varun and Nithya's school romance. But the problem is that most often the segue between song and scene isn't as smooth as it ideal...(more)\n\nSource: M Suganth, Times Of India"
