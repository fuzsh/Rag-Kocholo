Gautham Menon's next offering with Jiiva and Samanatha is going the 'Vinnathandi Varavuya' way, as the film will go on floors as a bilingual in Tamil and Telugu! Jiiva and Samantha are on-board 'Neethaane En Ponvasantham' whilst Samantha also has a confirmed berth in the Telugu version.

Ram of 'Kandireega' fame is touted to play protagonist in the Telugu version. AR Rahman is composing the tunes for the film. Gautham Menon's Photon Kathaas is producing 'Neethaane En Ponvasantham'.

As the posters suggest the film will be a breezy romantic entertainer with Jiiva as Raghu, a 21-year old engineering student and Samantha as Nithya, a psychology student.

It maybe mentioned that Gautham Menon's earlier with Simbu - Trisha, 'Vinnaithandi Varuvaya' was a bilingual and released as 'Ye Maaya Chesave' with Naga Chaithanya and Samantha in Telugu that tasted success at the BO. We hope this romantic entertainer, again, repeats Gautham's magic among the Tamil and Telugu masses...
