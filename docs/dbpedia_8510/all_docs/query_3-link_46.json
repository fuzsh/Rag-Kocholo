        "text": "RZ: Well, I guess it depends on how you mean it. I mean, I -- do you mean in a serial killer way or... Nardwuar: Yeah. Actually, twenty-two by George Henard, in 1991 when he jumped out of that pickup truck outside of a cafeteria, and yelled, \"It's Payback Time Belton County\" and then fired away. That was in one of those Time-Life books. That's what made it interesting\n\nRZ: Yeah. (long pause) Nardwuar: Ever seen Diamanda Galas do \"I Put a Spell on You?\"\n\nRZ: I never saw her perform live the whole time I lived in New York. Nardwuar: When you were in New York, were you guys influenced by Live Skull at all?\n\nRZ: I wouldn't say \"influenced\" but we did play a lot of shows with them, that's for sure. Nardwuar: And then eventually were you into Ministry? Because Ministry got guitars and you seemed to go in that direction with White Zombie. Did that influence you at all? The \"Ministry gets guitars\" craze?\n\nRZ: Um, not really, because I was strangely unaware of Ministry because I remember them from their early days and I remember everyone talking, \"You've got to hear Ministry!\" and I couldn't figure out why. So I was pretty late hearing the new Ministry. Nardwuar: It's because you guys were doing the New York\" art fag thing with Live Skull, right?\n\nRZ: Well, I wouldn't say we were doing it but we were certainly trapped in it.\n\nNardwuar: Have you ever tried Absinthe?\n\nRZ: No. Nardwuar: Do you know exactly where in Los Angeles that Alfalfa from the Little Rascals was shot in the head over a bad drug deal?\n\nRZ: I don't know exactly where he was shot but I know exactly where he was buried. Nardwuar: Where is that?\n\nRZ: At the Hollywood Memorial Cemetary on Santa Monica Boulevard. Nardwuar: Have you been to a graveyard at midnight?\n\nRZ: Many times. Nardwuar: Have you found anything cool, Rob Zombie, at Hollywood garage sales? Like, Long Gone John of Sympathy For The Record Industry Records has a \"Devil's Witches\" Manson Family jacket that I think John Waters wanted to buy off him. But I was thinking, being from Hollywood and all, have you ever gone to any cool garage sales and seen like Academy Awards out there in little boxes?\n\nRZ: (sighs) No, I mean, I've bought nothing to that extent of coolness. I mean, that jacket is probably the ultimate find but I've found some pretty good stuff, yeah, you know, it would pale in comparison but some pretty good stuff. Nardwuar: Well actually I think Long Gone John actually got that from a girlfriend or something like that but how about yourself? Like, there's nothing, like, one little item, like any little Munster tidbit that perhaps turned you on when you found it? Because I was thinking it must be incredible going to garage sales in Hollywood Hills, Rob Zombie.\n\nRZ: Well the best one -- there used to be an effects studio out on North Hollywood that went out of business and they sold off everything so you could get life casts of just about anyone, from Bela Lugosi to Leonard Nimoy, and they had props left over from movies that you could buy. But that's about it. Nardwuar: You have a big beard, but so does Johnny Legend. Have you done any gigs with Johnny Legend?\n\nRZ: No, we haven't made the \"beard\" connection yet.\n\nNardwuar: Speaking of battles and killing, Rob Zombie, there there was some serial killer in the 1930s who had a roadside cafe where he would kill his staff and customers, and then feed their bodies to alligators! Do you think that is the wildest thing you've ever heard, Rob Zombie?\n\nRZ: (laughs) Oh, you make me crazy. Nardwuar: Why is that?\n\nRZ: What's your name? Nardwuar: Nardwuar\n\nRZ: I just want to be able to say your name after every answer. Nardwuar: Well, thank you very much, Rob Zombie. Rob Zombie, I was still curious here, what do you know about human sacrifices? Human sacrifices and the Aztecs?\n\nRZ: What do I know about it? Nardwuar: Yeah, what do you know about human sacrifices, Rob Zombie? The Aztecs were into human sacrifices.\n\nRZ: Yeah. It's great. Nardwuar: Have you ever been to a mortuary?\n\nRZ: (silence) Nardwuar: Rob?\n\nRZ: Yes, I'm just giving you some dramatic pause. (laughs) Nardwuar: You have been to a mortuary.\n\nRZ: Yes. Nardwuar: Are you into necrophilia at all, studying the history of it? Because Sally Jesse Raphael was going to do that show on necrophilia but it never aired and I was thinking a zombie is a walking dead! A walking dead! So maybe you've had some run-ins with that?\n\nRZ: Some run-ins! No, I'm sorry. Nardwuar: Do you know of any documented instances of any necrophilia, Rob?\n\nRZ: (silence)\n\nNardwuar: Are you friends with Dave Vanian? Because the Damned have the record called History of the World Part One that has a picture of a tomb on it. A tomb! A tomb! A tomb!\n\nRZ: (pause) Oh yeah? No, I don't know him. Nardwuar: What kind of lenses do you use to get that effect in your eyes?\n\nRZ: They're Bausch & Lomb soft contacts. I don't know. I don't know what kind they are. Nardwuar: You don't know.\n\nRZ: Sorry. I don't have a funny answer for you. Nardwuar: You just did a Cabinet of Doctor Caligari rip-off video?\n\nRZ: Yes, I did. Nardwuar: What was that about?\n\nRZ: (deep breath, yawns) Nardwuar: You seem a bit tired, Rob.\n\nRZ: No, I'm trying to find the humour but I'm, I'm getting -- I'm losing it. What was it about? In what sense? Nardwuar: Well, a Cabinet of Doctor Caligari rip-off video That's cool! History! Rob Zombie!\n\nRZ: (laughs) Nardwuar: Hello, Rob?\n\nRZ: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just laughing. Nardwuar: I've noticed that on your new CD you have a complete fascination with House Industries computer fonts! Perhaps you would like to talk a bit about computer fonts, Rob Zombie! I've been trying to ask you other issues and you haven't been too informative, but computer fonts, you must be into computer fonts because your new CD has got excellent art on it and it seems like you really like the House Industries guys because you have lots of their fonts.\n\nRZ: They have good fonts. (long pause) Don't you think? Nardwuar: They're amazing! Totally amazing! Which ones are you into, particularly?\n\nRZ: (pause) Well, their Monster Font series is good. Their Rat Fink series is good, although I don't think I used it. They have a Custom Van series which I don't have that looks pretty good. Uh, I don't know if all the fonts I used were House Industries fonts. Nardwuar: I once did an interview with Nikki Sixx and I was talking to him about going to school in Seattle and I mentioned to him that Duff was from Seattle but he didn't really want to open up and talk and you know say, \"Hey, I went to school with Duff. I went to school with El Duce from the Mentors and Criss Crass from the Vains who ended up in the Muffs.\" Nikki Sixx went to high school with like El Duce from the Mentors, Duff from Guns 'n' Roses, and Criss Crass from the Vains! Why wouldn't somebody like him want to open up? Why aren't those guys nice and talkative like yourself, Rob?\n\nRZ: I don't know. You'll have to ask Nikki Sixx why he wouldn't want to open up to you. Nardwuar: Well, thanks very much for your time, Rob. I really do appreciate it. Do you have anything else you would like to add to the people out there?\n\nRZ: No, I'm sure you can just write whatever you like, that'd be fine."
