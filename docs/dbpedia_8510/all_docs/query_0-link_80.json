        "meta_description": "Murder Junkies by GG Allin &amp; Antiseen, released 23 June 2022\n\n1. Murder For The Mission\n\nMurder Junkies is the seventh studio album by GG Allin and featuring ANTiSEEN as band. This is GG Allin’s final studio album to be released during his lifetime.\r\nJeff Clayton, lead singer of ANTiSEEN, has described this album as a mixed blessing. Although he is very happy with the way it turned out, he thinks that a lot of people got the impression that they are nothing more than a backing band for GG Allin. Clayton has stated that GG Allin was very professional during the recording of the album, and he wonders how much of GG Allin’s stage act was real and how much of it was “For The Marks”.\r\nNow this album is being released for the first time as it was originally conceived, and it has been remastered in order to deliver the aggressive sound which with it was recorded.",
