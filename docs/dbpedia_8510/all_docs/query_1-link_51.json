        "text": "CKY will release a brand new EP titled Too Precious To Kill on vinyl only as a part of Record Store Day Black Friday. Even if you don't have a record player, you can still stream the group's cover of GG Allin's \"Bite It You Scum.\" Vocalist Chad I Ginsburg dubs the cover as \"relentless and quite vicious,\" which is certainly the truth.\n\n“Nobody knows fucking GG Allin! CKY will kill you with this relentless and quite vicious studio version of this classic punk rock song. It has been a longtime staple in the CKY live show and highly requested for over a decade! Here it is in studio quality, only available as part of our Record Store Day exclusive.\n\n“Crank it up and take a shit on someone!”\n\nPlease don't shit on someone."
