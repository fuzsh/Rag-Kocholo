        "text": "Disgusting sleazebags don't get much disgustingly sleazebaggier than Kevin \"GG\" Allin. His life was a sick form of performance art - he set no limits for himself, meaning that he would smash himself in the head with the microphone, beat his fans up, poop on stage, eat it, throw it at the crowd, work diligently to rise to the top ranks of a Fortune 500 company, let girls vomit, pee and poop in his mouth, shoot up every drug he could find, rape and beat up stupid girls who for some reason trusted him, and eventually he died of a heroin overdose! This is probably for the best, since he always claimed that he was going to kill himself onstage and take as many spectators with him as possible. And his music? SCUMMY! It started off just misogynist punk, but as his voice and mind deteriorated, it became sicker, filthier, messier, scuzzier, noisier, screamier and Perrier. Perrier??? WATER you doing? Ha ha!!! HEEEEE! Always Was, Is And Always Shall Be (by GG Allin & the Jabbers) - Orange 1980\n\nIf you're only familiar with the public image of GG Allin, you will be astonished when you see and hear this album. He's a snotty little twit! Clean shaven face, full head of hair, looks about 20 with an ugly scowl on his pissy little face, wearing a denim jacket with the name \"GG Allin\" above the pocket. Then put it on and what do you get? Poorly mixed punk rock (the drums are WAY the hell back there) with cleanish guitars and a curled lip American trailer trash redneck jerkoff singing macho lyrics about rockin' and rollin' - like Johnny Cougar gone asshole! Some of the lyrics are violent, profane and misogynistic, but not anything like the grossout shock material he would be performing as early as his second album. These songs are catchy as hell and completely rooted in Ramones/60sish punk, with violent lyrics like \"Beat, beat, beat - beat my meat, bitch!\" and \"Don't you mess with me emotionally/Or I will make you bleed internally.\" That's about as bad as it gets though. Most of the songs are just dumb spit-in-your-eye stuff like \"Don't Talk To Me,\" \"I Need Adventure,\" \"One Man Army\" and \"Bored To Death.\"\n\nRidiculous as it is to say, the only thing that hurts this record is GG's attempts to be poppy. As evidenced by everything else he would do in his career, pop music really wasn't his forte - not even pop PUNK. The backup vocals are corny, some of the voice melodies sound riproaringly amateurish with this little kid trying to sing them and one song has the most out-of-tune keyboard you will ever hear in your life - and not on porpoise. It's a WHALE of an out of tune keyboard! See? Lyin'! (Sea Lion)\n\nThis was on Orange Records - David Peel's label! As in Have A Marijuana!! That's right!!! HAVE A FUCKIN' MARIJUANA!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWait wait wait, slow down. Are you telling me that you're one of the 999 billion trillion people who have never heard of Have A Marijuana!?\n\nReader Comments\n\nRebelJukebox@aol.com (James)\n\nI actually thought that GG's early work with the Jabbers was his best stuff. No out reachin' for shock value, just good ol' bad-attitude punk rock, the way that it's supposed to be. But anyways, at random, this girl walked up to me, and yelled \"GG Allin is alive! GG Allin is alive!\" to which I replied, \"Y'know, if you were one of the girls GG raped, you wouldn't be all that stoked on him being alive.\"\n\nAnyways, the stuff with the Jabbers is the best. \"Don't Talk To Me\" and \"Assface\" are classics!\n\ngardner@localline.com\n\nThis one CD is the beginning and end of my GG Allin collection. Unlike the one version you review, this was released by \"Halycon (did they mean \"Halcyon\"?) Recording Corporation. As you say, the songs are catchy and, other than the lyrics, they'd fit in the regular rotation with the Dolls and Ramones. Oh and that \"audio verite\" at the beginning of \"Pussy Summit Meeting\" sorta undermines GG's \"street cred\" ... The CD insert has a photo of a clean-shaven, young-looking GG, sort of resembling David Essex.\n\nFor a truly heart-warming photo of GG and his brother, Merle, check out the Kodak moment on page 298 of Pamela Des Barre's book, \"Rock Bottom,\" with GG in his coffin and Merle displaying his brother's johnson.\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nI imagine that most people who are into GG because of and/or know him best for his violent, profane, sexually deviant, blasphemous, scatological, and generally sociopathic post-1984 work don't have much use for this album, but personally, this is my second-favorite GG Allin record (just a shade behind the ANTiSEEN record). GG functions just as well as a cut-rate Ramones and Dead Boys ripoff as he does the \"Rock 'n' Roll Terrorist\" he would become later on. One thing I like about GG's early work is that unlike later years when he would gather up any bunch of halfway-talented malcontents who were willing to record or tour with him, the Jabbers were an actual BAND, with a stable lineup (at least for the first few years) and everything. Of course, it was all beginning to come apart at the seams by the time the album was actually released; the story goes that GG, personally and without consulting the rest of the band, had the original Ramones-style band photo that was sel! ected for the cover replaced with the self-portrait of him \"wearing a denim jacket with the name 'GG Allin' above the pocket\". I easily give this a 9/10. Best songs are \"Cheri Love Affair\", \"Unpredictable\", and the insanely-catchy, will-stick-in-your-head-for-weeks-at-a-time \"Beat Beat Beat\".\n\nUNHOLYROLLER666@webtv.net\n\nThis is my least favorite GG Allin CD.It sounds far too pop and doesn't represent what GG was all about.This record reminds me too much of the Ramones...............\n\nstephen_wood@comcast.net\n\n\"And I don't know what's the matter with your yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap. I'd like to tie your hands and feet, put you in a sack!\"\n\nIf you do not worship Dionysus your mother will mistake you for a wild animal and eat you. GG was the Jesus of our age. We could never live our life that way, but we don't have to because he already died for us. Honestly, does a bunch of postmodernist pseudointellectual bullshit really negate the creative power of raw appetite and drunken carnality? Sure, the system tries to coopt this force with products like Barbie and Britney Spears, but the unbridled id personified by GG Allin is the real thing: making it a dangerous force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe reason people like George \"is a son of a\" Bush, Dick \"go fuck yourself\" Cheney, and Donald \"hot prison porn\" Rumsfeld currently have a monopoly on power is that society as a whole still tries to dismiss or repress what is brandished \"bad\", \"evil\" or \"dirty\". The collective moral sense that is offended by GG Allin is what enables these white washed villains to stay in power. The people who blindly obey this kind of \"morality\" are the ones cramming our government with Republicans when we should be complaning that the Democrats aren't good enough. Clearly, when we can't acknowledge these issues on a personal level, listening to a crazy record and having fun, we aren't going to succeed at becoming critical about them on the global stage. I know it sounds like a stretch for me to say that if more people listened to GG less people would vote Republican. But it is nonetheless true: GG would be more of a symptom than a cause, however. The kind of people who are actually exposed to GG Allin would probably never vote Republican unless it was a joke. My point is that enjoying GG Allin requires you to be unrepressed concerning your appetites. Republicans, on the other hand, believe we invaded Iraq in order to bring them \"freedom\".\n\nSure, being unimpressed with GG Allin because your sense of cultural ennui has been dangerously heightened by your expensive education is far more intelligent than just being offended by him. I think postmodernism gives a very valuable and interesting framework through which to look at many contemporary artists. But in GG's case especially, this would be to miss the point. What was great about him was not his imitation of various genres and cliches, it was that he took them to an extreme that no one can imitate now without paling in comparison to him. I think that it would do everyone good to have their proverbial cherry popped by GG Allin because, paradoxically, I think it is those that can't stand him that he has the most insight to offer. Of course I wouldn't try to convince anyone to listen to his music at any given moment but if you talk trash on GG someone should skullfuck your left eye socket and then shit into the newly formed bloody cavity. Rebuttal? You have 30 seconds, Mr. President. I'm sorry, Mr. President, are you having difficulty speaking while I shit in your gaping eye socket? (Sorry I just watched the Presidental debates.)\n\nAdd your thoughts? The Masturbation Session 10\" - Alive 1998\n\nThe most important thing you need to know about this single is that the title is not a metaphor.\n\nSure, you could imagine a similar title being used for nearly any record by the Grateful Dead, Dave Matthews Band or Phish, but GG Allin is none of those things and the title is not figurative.\n\nThis 7\" includes the gritty but gleeful rock n' rollers \"Sluts in the City\" and \"Tough Fuckin' Shit\" (the latter a parody of Nancy Sinatra's \"Sorry 'Bout That\"!), an inept punk-speed cover of the Stooges' \"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\" a hilariously incongruous radio commercial for Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be and \"The Masturbation Session,\" the title of which is not an exaggeration.\n\nEven when performed at punk speed, the earliest GG Allin material tended toward the happily melodic which, combined with his young white trash voice, renders the material a bit light in the loafers compared to the throat-shredding bile he'd be creating within the next couple of years. \"Tough Fuckin' Shit\" isn't a bad pop song, but it's ruined by a booming mega-reverbed mix. \"Sluts in the City,\" on the other hand, is just \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" with different words and an awful chorus. The live Stooges cover has the advantage of being meaner in tone, but.. A bass solo!? In a GG Allin song!? Oh well. At least it's not \"The Masturbation Session,\" which is another type of solo altogether.\n\nThe absurd highlight of the single involves a golden-voiced radio announcer delivering a spirited pitch for GG's debut album. Perhaps it didn't seem quite as bizarre back in 1980, but knowing the drug-fuelled rapist cretin that GG would become, it's retroactively hilarious to hear this Mainstream Man from the Middle-of-the-Road raving about his \"energetic, raunchy, killer rock!\" Also, he gives out GG's home phone number, which is certainly an odd thing for a commercial to do.\n\nThe lowlight of the single would undoubtedly be the title track, which features the orgasmic exclamation \"Let me lick the crust off your shorts. Oh, you smell so sweaty.\"\n\nIn conclusion, if there is a grosser single in existence, I don't want to hear it!\n\n(Because it's probably by Supertramp.)\n\nReader Comments\n\nBrendan Boyer\n\nHey, just wanted to let you know that Sluts in the City is actually an (uncredited) cover of the song Kids in the City by the glam-rock band Candy. So if it's just the same song as Blitzkrieg Bop, then that means that the Ramones were ripping off Candy!\n\nAnd then later GG Allin also ripped off Candy, and way more blatantly at that.\n\nAnyways, here's the original song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbHCLyy0p10\n\nAdd your thoughts? Gimme Some Head 7\" (by GG Allin & the Motor City Bad Boys) -Orange 1980\n\nAs the title of one of his own live albums acknowledges, GG Allin suffered from Antisocial Personality Disorder. He exercised lack of empathy or remorse towards others, poor behavioral controls, recurring difficulties with the law, promiscuity, a tendency to violate the boundaries and rights of others, aggressive and violent behavior, inability to tolerate boredom, abusive relationships, irresponsible work behavior and disregard for safety. Other Allin characteristics that support this diagnosis included superficial charm, shallow emotions, a distorted sense of self, a constant search for new sensations, a tendency to physically and verbally abuse peers, and tendency to manipulate others without remorse or empathy. Yet further evidence included egocentrism, megalomania, lack of responsibility, extroversion, excessive hedonism, high impulsivity, and the desire to experience sensations of control or power.\n\nIn other words, if you've ever wondered what would drive a man to go onstage and poop all over himself, it's Antisocial Personality Disorder. GG did it because behaving like a human freak show earned him the attention that his narcissism demanded. Whether this was due to heredity (his father was mentally unstable) or environment (he was raised in a cabin with no electricity, he performed poorly in school and was made fun of by peers, he later became addicted to alcohol and heroin) is hard to gauge, but it's worth noting that his brother Merle isn't exactly the boy next door either. It's possible that a study of GG's brain would've shown cortical underarousal or impaired social response reversal, but who knows? For that matter, I imagine his habit of bashing the microphone into his head could've damaged his frontal cortex too, which would definitely have increased his aberrant behavior.\n\nWhatever the cause of his disorder, he definitely had one. He was not a \"rebel\" acting out against society and trying to save rock and roll; he was a damaged human being whose impaired brain was unable to create positive feelings or sympathy towards other human beings, yet demanded that they make him the center of attention at all times. You know how he always ranted that he didn't give a fuck what anybody thought of him? That wasn't an empty boast. He was actually acknowledging how he felt every day of his life. To paraphrase Nirvana, he didn't care what people thought as long as it was about him. His brain was miswired; he couldn't have given a fuck if he'd wanted to. It's an absolute miracle that he didn't wind up a serial killer or corporate CEO.\n\nStill, these two songs are pretty great. Featuring the MC5's Wayne Kramer and Dennis Thompson, \"Gimme Some Head\" and \"Dead or Alive\" are sleazy but propulsive '70s rock'n'roll in the New York Dolls/Dead Boys vein. GG's voice is still young and teenagey, and the recording sound is very loud and strong. Also, he was nuts.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Banned In Boston, Pt. 2 EP (by GG Allin & the Jabbers) - Black & Blue 1988\n\nThis is GG and the Jabbers recorded live at The Channel in August 1982, when he was still a sweet young boy with the hicky little voice of a white trash trailer parker. Unfortunately the tape gets a little warbly as it goes, but the excitement and dare I say MENTAL LUCIDITY of GG and his young band are more than worth the price of admission to Legally Blonde Pt. 2: Red, White and Blonde.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of Bob Newhart, the very first words on this disc are a shout from the audience, \"FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKIN' HOMO!\" GG, too young to be completely out of his fucking mind like he would be in five years, refrains from fisticuffs and calmly replies, \"Hey, we love you too!\" Can you believe that? I mean, he was still a disgusting creep (as evidenced by his introduction to \"Gimme Some Head\" -- \"This next song's off our new single. It's for all you girls that like to suck cock!\"), but it's just incredible to think that the filthydisgusting horrible GG Allin started off as a pinheaded pissbrained little kid rockin' the crowds with some GREAT punk rock songs. Songs like \"You Hate Me & I Hate You!\" \"Don't Talk To Me!\" (GOD, I LOVE the way the guy so methodically plays the chords in this one! It's almost like power pop, but played WAY too friggin fast!) \"Assface\"! And the coolest thing on the release for both newfers and oldfers: a song called \"Nuke Attack\" that is, in fact, an early version of \"I Wanna Piss On You\" with (very) vaguely socially conscious lyrics!!!!!!\n\nThink about that for half a second. That means that this human being sat down at some point and said to his band, \"Man, that 'Nuke Attack' riff totally kicks ass! If only the lyrics were about PEEING on somebody!\"\n\nCome on. \"I Wanna Piss On You\"?!? What kind of asshole would write a song called \"I Wanna Piss On You\"!!?!??!?!\n\nI would. But aside from me, I mean COME ON!!!!!\n\nAdd your thoughts? Insult & Injury Volume 3: 5-26-82 Providence, RI and More - Black & Blue 1997\n\nLife's a big difficulty and sometimes it can get busy. Hey, we've all been there. Maybe the guy at the bus stop ate your shirt and suddenly you're standing there with no shirt and it's all cold. Or perhaps you went to the bank and instead of money, a bunch of bananas popped out of the machine and now you have to buy your new car with a banana. This is what life does to all of us. It buries us in manure and then kicks us in the ass. For this reason, I refuse to write a GG Allin review today.\n\nAlso I'm really busy at work.\n\nBut seriously, this CD is an asshole! It's young and punky, but I'm almost certain that about half of it already appears on Banned in Boston, Volume 2. Furthermore, the band has a great trashy live punk sound as if they were the young Ramones or Misfits thrashing out their high-energy music into your face, but half the riffs are completely derivative of the New York Dolls, and the last ten minutes are devoted to nothing but audience members chatting and GG performing a song he'd already played earlier in the set!\n\nYou know what the Jabbers sound like? A cross between those obnoxious mid-'70s proto-punk Cleveland bands (Electric Eels, Pagans, Mirrors) and late '70s punk rock outfits (Ramones, Dead Boys). At this concert, they perform four songs from Always Is, Was, Will Be Are, two from the Gimme Your Head Bloodrock single, one each from the You Have Me & I Have You love single and No Rulers school single, and a song called \"I Hope She Holds Her Breath 'Cuz I'll Never Call\" that's sung by bassist Al Chappel, who wiggles his voice upwards at the end of every line like the worst Johnny Rotten impersonator in the world (besides Andrew Schofield).\n\nHere are some stage patters:\n\n\"This first here song goes out to all you fucken assholes!\"\n\n\"You're making too much noise! We gotta have silence here.\"\n\n\"You're lucky to be here; you get to see US!\"\n\n\"Let's hear it for the band!\" (*crowd cheers*) \"Faggots! Can't make any more noise than that!?\"\n\n\"It's dedicated to all you ugly fuckers - and every one of you looks pretty ugly to me.\"\n\nFor this reason, I refuse to write a GG Allin review today.\n\nDON'T TRY TO TALK ME INTO IT!\n\nOkay, here are some jokes:\n\nWhy did GG Allin cross the road?\n\nBecause he was no chickenshit!!! (However, he wanted to roll around in it, and thus followed a chicken until it had a bowel movement, at which point he rolled around in it)\n\nKnock knock\n\nWho's there?\n\nGG Allin\n\nGG Allin who?\n\nGee, gee, Allan Clarke - I'm a huge fan of your Bruce Springsteen covers.\n\nSorry, you're at the wrong house.\n\nIn that case, do you have any poop I can roll around in?\n\nWhat's the difference between GG Allin and Nicolas Cage?\n\nOne performs with garbage and fecal matter; the other performs in garbage and fecal matter.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Occupation 7\" (by GG Allin & the Jabbers) - Blood 2000\n\nUpon learning of my protracted career difficulties, GG Allin of the Jabber Corporation made an offer. Unfortunately, I soon learned that, like most CEOs, he was not to be trusted.\n\nHIS PROMISE: \"We can't afford a dental plan at the moment, but you'll have the opportunity to hobnob with some of the highest ranking executives in the sector, including 'Brother' Wayne Kramer and 'Third Cousin by Marriage' Dennis Thompson.\"\n\nTHE REALITY: A bland Johnny Thunders riff with some jerk soloing over it the whole time.\n\nHIS PROMISE: \"There isn't room in our budget for sick days at the moment, but the Corporation has some promising new ideas that should put us in the red at no time.

No Rules 7\" (by GG Allin & the Jabbers) - Orange 1983\n\nAccording to the old clock on the wall, I will turn 30 years old in less than 12 hours. This is a major, major life change, and not one that I've particularly been looking forward to. 30 to me has always meant no more youth. One is expected to have his \"shit together\" by the time he turns 30. I, unfortunately, LOST my shit approximately two weeks ago, getting laid off after seven years of at least passable service. Granted, it wasn't the greatest job in the universe but it paid pretty well and it was mostly easy. Now I'm sorta freelancing and trying to get writing jobs and just sort of living off the wife, I suppose. But that's not the real issue. The real issue is my sophomoric, gross sense of humor. You can't DO that when your 20s are gone. Because it's just... you know, GROSS. Like David Lee Roth. Or a dirty old man. Nobody wants to hear a wrinkly old bag make poop jokes. I'm expected to be a mature adult now -- which is FINE in real life, because I'm fairly mature in my relations to other people. But my reviews have always been my escape into bad humor and tasteless, unnecessary comments. They make me laugh! But will they still make YOU laugh when you know they're coming from an old fogie who uses Rogaine and has to exercise three times a week to keep the pizza paunch away? It's just like Jello Biafra says in \"Chickenshit Conformist\": \"Imagine Mark Prindle at 35!\" Now you don't have to. Because I'm thirty in a few hours. And from there, I'm only two or three weeks away from 35, according to the calendar I made when I was drunk. So what will become of me? Will I stop cursing? Settle down and write fucking boringass SHIT reviews like everybody else in the world? (No offense against everybody else in the world -- it's not their fault their reviews SUCK THE SHIT OUT OF MY BELLY BUTTON, PACKAGE IT IN ALUMINUM FOIL AND SELL IT AS \"MARS BARS.\"). I'm not old enough to have a midlife crisis, but I'm certainly having some sort of youth-end self-reflection thing going on. I've never been an official adult before! What if everybody realizes how stupid I am? What if I accidentally tell them how stupid I am? FUCK! GO BACK AND DON'T HAVING READ THAT!\n\nIf nothing else, I certainly can't be reviewing GG Allin records once I turn 30, so let me slip this last one in under the literal gun that the Arab Nazis are pointing at me through my computer according to any given Feral House book. No Rules is a really good early single by Our Man Friday, full of three speedy great fast basic fast punk rockers and one disappointing generic Ramones ripoff (or \"homage\"). The guy really did have a damn fine punk rock band at the beginning of his career. I know some people aren't too keen on his grossout, distorted-to-hell sleazeball later material, but this early stuff is really just a slightly racier take on everyday normal snotty punk. Who could hate it? \"You're a fuckup! You're a fuckup! You're a fuckup! You're a fuckup!\" It's funny, dumb, fast, fun -- grab it by the diddle-daddle before it consplodes!\n\nSee, I can't write nonsense like that when I'm an adult. People will think I'm former MTV veejay J.J. Johnson, trying to fit in with the hip new generation even though I'm 40 and grotesque. What a depressing day for mankind and all of America. The sexiest young music critic in the business (or as we in the business call it, \"the biz\") has lost all his hair, grown a full beard and gained 85 pounds -- all since the beginning of this review! AWWWWWWW FUCK A DIDDLY ASS CROTCH PUSSY ASS POOP!\n\nOr so says the aging, senile former record reviewer Mark Prindle as he angrily shakes his cane at the young whippersnappers doing \"ollies\" on their hoverboards.\n\nReader Comments\n\nhdlevesque@yahoo.com (Henri-Désiré Levesque)\n\nWhich of these songs is the \"Ramones ripoff/homage\"? They all sound more or less like the Ramones to me.\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nI must respectfully disagree with Mr. Prindle here. If there is a stinker on this album, it's the title track. Sure, it's fist-pumpingly anthemic enough, but there is no melody to speak of, the lyrics fail to move me, and it just comes off as nondescript and bland. It's a perfectly good song, to be sure, but \"perfectly good\" just doesn't cut it when juxtaposed with three other classic pieces of old-school, New York style punk rock. Also, what's wrong with \"NYC Tonight\"? Sure, it sounds like the Ramones, but so does all of GG's pre-1982 material-- and a good deal of the rest of New York punk scene does, as well. What, just because he speaks of \"rais[ing] hell in New York City\" rather than his native Boston, he's suddenly ripping off the Ramones? GG raised hell in every town he played in.\n\ntriceea33@yahoo.com\n\ndo you really not like mars bars?

I'm not in the mood for quotation marks at the moment, so caps will simply have to suffice: HARD CANDY COCK, I DON'T GIVE A SHIT, DRINK FIGHT AND FUCK, I WANNA FUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT, I'M GONNA RAPE YOU, FUCKIN' THE DOG, COCK ON THE LOOSE, CLIT LICKER, BLOW JOBS. And I suppose there are a few others, but they don't contain curse words, so what's the point? No point! That is my answer to everything at this point in our society, as we kill ourselves with the ozone layer and greenhouses.\n\nGG made a quantum leap starring the highly-talented, meteoric young star Scott Bakula on this album, with his new band The Scumfucs kicking the shit out of the pussyass Jabbers, with distorted heavy guitars a-blarin', high-speed angry punk drums a-smashin' (audibly so, too!) and a healthy wad of scraggly phlegm cloggin' up GG's voicebox so, young as he still be, he sounds angry and urban instead of rural and stupid. This is punk rock! A few of the songs still sound like poorly advised bubblegum Ramones ripoffs (especially the disgusting sing-songy \"I Wanna Fuck Your Brains Out\" and \"Teacher's Pet\" - BLEAHEW~!), but most of the others are hard angry punk, so HEY WAIT A GODDAMNED MINUTE!!! \"POORLY ADVISED\"??? NOBODY ADVISED GG ALLIN, YOU FUCK. GG ALLIN DID EVERYTHING HIS WAY, YOU FUCK!!!! YOU AREN'T FIT TO LICK HIS FUKIN SHITT YOU DICK COCK SUCKER!!\n\nSorry about that, Reader Comments shoved me away from the keyboard to get in a few words. I'm back now. This is a really profane, violent, fun punk rock record that you'll get a real kick out of if you're into stuff like that. Hideous lead guitar work though (as bad as my work with the Low-Maintenance Perennials!) and a weird mix where the fuzzy guitars keep overloading and then disappearing when GG screams too loud (as bad as my work with the Low-Maintenance Perennials!). And the end of the CD features a great in-concert bit, with people in the crowd laughing and making fun of GG as he cusses them out (as bad as my work with the Hollyridge Strings Play The Hits Of The Low-Maintenance Perennials!).\n\nOh, I forgot. Gotta always talk about what GG looks like. Still young, but his hair is messier, he's grown a stupid-looking redneck mustache and he's going around with sunglasses in front of his eyes and no shirt on like a tough hick punk (which is weird considering he grew up in Vermont. Hurm). On a funny note, this album nowadays is usually referred to as its initials E.M.F.. Isn't that a hilarity laugh? Remember that band E.M.F.? They were really good!\n\nIf ya like SHIT!\n\nReader Comments\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nMany people view this as the prototypical GG Allin record, probably based on the fact that, more than any other record of his, it is chock full of songs that would prove to be his best-known work: \"Drink, Fight, & Fuck\", \"Cock on the Loose\", \"I'm Gonna Rape You\", \"Hard Candy Cock\", and more. However, what most of these people forget is that for every classic on this album, there's a dud (\"Clit Licker\", \"Out for Blood\", \"Teacher's Pet\") or even an outright embarrassment (\"Convulsions\"). This is a maddeningly inconsistent album. Another bone I have to pick with this album is the production. GG's albums are, of course, always grossly underproduced, but this album comes perilously close to unlistenable at times (\"Out for Blood\", for example). Frankly, I think that his next album, \"You'll Never Tame Me\" (not reviewed on this site), is much more representative of this stage of his career because despite the fact that the album contains fewer well-known songs, the low points! aren't nearly as low either. 7/10. Best songs: \"I'm Gonna Rape You\", \"Fuckin' the Dog\", and the criminally overlooked \"God Of Fire In Hell\".\n\nbtelford@bright.net (Mucous Mike)\n\nWhen I met GG for the first time at the Channel it was during a Suicidal Tendencies show in 1984. My friend from Ohio, my girlfriend and I had eaten some valiums and drank on the 'T' all of the way there from Brighton. Things started getting out of hand and we had to rest in the back bar. That's when I saw through my double vision GG talking to his girlfriend Tracy. I yelled, \"Hey Assface!\" which was a song on the \"You Hate Me & I Hate You\" EP that I had. I didn't really know if that was him because I had only seen a few pictures before and I had only been in Boston for a couple of months. GG looked and yelled the same thing back at me. Then he comes over and sits down with us like we were old friends and we talked about music and all kinds of shit for about an hour until he left. He took down my name and number (he still lived in Manchester at the time) and we became pretty good friends. He would come down to Boston and we'd go to the Rat and get all fucked up and ! go to Merle's or my place and just get stupid drunk all night long and of course we'd go to plenty of concerts and raise hell. Anyway, shortly after the initial Channel meeting, I was in Newbury Comics on Boylston St. and they had a copy of 'Eat My Fuc' on vinyl in nothing but a record sleeve and it had the hand-drawn spurting dick in black and red magic marker. I of course had to own this and I still have it to this day. I wonder what it's worth since I only played it once to record it (I since have everything on the album on CD). We remained friends up until his death. I went to visit him at Jackson and spent a week in Chicago with him and Liliana a couple of weeks before his first arrest. I got some great pics of him that I took in Jeff Clayton's basement during the photo shoot for Murder Junkies with the ANTiSEEN in Charlotte. He was always fun and whenever I look through my vinyl and I see that unique GG art on the 'Eat My Fuc' album, it brings back great memor! ies of a fun guy who knew more about music and rock and roll his! tory than anyone I've ever met, except for maybe Merle. R.I.P.\n\nI always treated him like a regular guy instead of some rock star and he told me that he considered me to be a close friend several times. When I would throw little parties at my apartment in Boston, GG would come down and there would be girls there and he was as polite a gentlemen as you'd ever want to meet. No problems ever...just laughing and good times. When he went crazy was when he was in front of an audience filled with posers and gawking fucknuts who thought they were at a zoo rather than a rock and roll show. Frankly, when it comes to a more interesting and pertinent biography, I always thought that I could have done a MUCH better done than Todd Phillips and his half-assed 'Hated'. I bet if I ever had the time I could write some great true and compelling anecdotes about the fun and crazy shit we got into in Boston. So many people I know have awesome video footage of GG..not just concert stuff but normal hanging out an! d yukking it up stuff that would have painted a much more accurate picture of the man and his life than was seen in 'Hated'. Phillips' artsy documentary didn't scratch the surface and it used irrelevant people plus lame and boring footage to show GG in a way that was not at all consistent with what those who knew him well would say. I spent a week with he and Lilliana at her Chicago penthouse in 1989 right before his first arrest. I had a great time laughing it up, drinking HARD and just relaxing. One night we even sat a piano bar and sang old tunes with a woman who was playing the piano (no shit). Of course the best times we had were all before the prison years when he basically lost a huge chunk of his humanity and it was! replaced with a burning hatred that was just a flame before. H! e said that when he first went to prison, he was forced to dry out and he started to remember many things about himself and his life that were deeply repressed before prison, almost entirely through his drug and alcohol abuse. But when he was able to think more clearly without the booze and drugs, he started to really HATE the Human Condition and how it had warped him as a child (his father) and how he found himself having to face his demons without the luxury of something to numb his brain. He used to call me collect from Jackson just to tell me the latest things he was remembering about his childhood and young adult life and he seemed genuinely shocked by it. He really had an arrested development when he came to a normal maturity level because of his awful childhood and when he died at the age of 36, you might have thought you were looking at and talking to a guy in his late 40's or early 50's.\n\nI guess you can tell that not all of GG's friends were scummy stupid assholes. GG was one of the most, if not THE most, important forces in my life. I feel extremely lucky to have known him and to have experienced this unique example of a tortured yet vital soul. What I always want to express to anyone that I talk to about GG is that above all else, his life was about music. It was his first real friend and he died for and with it. He knew more about early rock and roll, who was who, etc. than anyone I've ever met. We had discussions that would last for hours just about our ideas on music. It was the music that attracted me to him and that's what I'll always remember about him. As for the punks he beat up, well suffice to say that in some way or another they likely deserved it. GG didn't turn on someone unless they had it coming, and most people did.\n\nandrew.moncrieff@virgin.net\n\nMucous Mike's story is one of the greatest things I've read about GG. He says something about Todd Phillips' Hated movie being half-assed, but I just have to add - I read an interview with Todd looking back and I think he'd probably agree with you about a lot of things. The bit that stood out was Todd saying \"He wasn't like an animal. He was a good guy, most of the bad things about him came out from alcohol and drugs\".\n\nIt does seem that his legend may have overshadowed him a little. Seriously, it's rare to find people so committed to a premise, let alone such a transgressive one. He is a hero.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Live Fast Die Fast 7\" (by GG Allin & the Flying 69) - Black & Blue 1984\n\nI was just in the other room throwing a turd at somebody out the window when it suddenly occurred to me that I haven't reviewed a GG Allin record in a while. As the Reverend Jim Jones once said, \"Now is the time for all good men to come to the (Kool) aid of their GG Allin fans.\" Well, I'm nothing if not entirely naked and standing in the middle of a shopping district, so pass the Dr. Mustard and let's breast!\n\nThis record is still very early GG Allin, so the Johnny Cougar stupidity and bad hard rock machismo of \"Live Fast, Die Fast\" and the 1984 version of \"I Need Adventure\" have to be understood in that context. Note I didn't say \"ENJOYED in that context,\" as doctors would have to discover a whole new sub-level of mental retardation before these two exercises in impotent redneckism are to be enjoyed by anyone. The other two tracks are extremely catchy punk rockers though - \"Livin' Like An Animal\" sounds like the Adolescents or early Bad Religion while thematically supporting GG's infamous \"eating my own poop\" decree, and \"Louden Boomer\" is cool Weirdosy surf-spy punk with a really loud bass guitar. Not sure about the lyrics. Wasn't there a TV dog named Boomer at some point? Maybe it's about how loud he barked.\n\nDoes your head hurt from all this insight? I could write slower if you need me to.\n\nReader Comments\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nI can't really say for sure, but this EP sounds like it might be an ill-advised stab at commercial accessibility for GG. There's not a single curse word on it, fer chrissakes. Ironic, then, that this EP should come out the same year as the album that marked his permanent descent into the psychotic abyss, \"Eat My Fuc\". Anyhow, I agree with Mark that \"Live Fast, Die Fast\" sucks-- slow, lumbering, far too long-- but I happen to like the rewrite of \"I Need Adventure\", if only because hearing GG repeatedly sing \"Come on boys let's show 'em what we can do\" sounds vaguely homosexual. Hands down the best song on here, though, is \"Livin' Like an Animal\". Note that the melody and entire first verse of that song were incorporated into the song \"Fuckin' the Dog\" on the Eat My Fuc album. Also note GG's humorous mispronunciation of \"orangutan\". 8/10.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Singles Collection (Volume One) - TPOS 1999\n\nThe most inneresting about this disc is that it begins with a single that GG just played DRUMS on. And Merle played bass! 'Twas a band called Malpractice, and their hit single \"Love Tunnel\" was about as tacky as GG but with a guy who couldn't sing OR yell! After that, we get into GG's rancid early pop/punk crap (\"1980's Rock N' Roll\" is by no small stretch one of the absolutely most sophomoric, hideous songs I have ever heard). Then there's a couple Velvet Underground-style songs by a band called \"StripSearch.\" I can't tell if GG sings on 'em or what the hell. Then FINALLY we get to \"Gimme Some Head\" and the GG we all know and love (except for the readers who responded here - everybody else loves GG, especially the Hindus) comes bustin' lose. The rest is as offensive and catchy as you're gonna need! No noiserock here - this was strictly early GG. When I purchased it at the Princeton Record Exchange last weekend (the same day that I was given a VHS copy of The Car!), the young fellow behind the counter said this unto me -- \"This is the poppiest stuff he ever did!\" So take it from that guy - this is some poppy GG. Which isn't ALWAYS a good thing, but it certainly works wonders with monstrously funny, melodic punk tunes like \"A Fuck Up,\" \"I'm Gonna Rape You\" and the world famous David Peel (who had the genius to rip off \"Eleanor Rigby\" as \"All The Homeless People,\" sing a song about marijuana to the music of \"Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye\" and sing \"Libertarians For Freedom\" to the music of \"O Tennenbaum\" ALL ON THE SAME ALBUM) anthem \"Devil's Prayer,\" which I guess must have been written by the two of them when they played together back in the dusky musky nineteen-seventies. What the hell are they saying anyway? \"Blippity So of The Souls Of The World - Have Mercy On Us?\"\n\nReader Comments\n\nColin T.\n\nPRINCETON RECORD EXCHANGE!!! Fuck yeah, Mark!\n\nSaturnSaturn138@aol.com\n\nFirst of all I am not a follower of GG Allin. I don't own any of his records I doubt I could find any if I tried. If did manage to find one I would most like buy it to just laugh at it (that is if it didn't cost me any more than four bucks). But it seems to me that all the people who write in and say how they worship The Misfits, The Ramones, The Stooges, Black Flag Ect. Fail to realize is that GG Allin was the inevitable conclusion of the Stooges, the Ramones, The Misfits, Ect. In the same way that abstract expressionism was the inevitable conclusion to expressionism.\n\nirontyrant@earthlink.net (Michael Grefski)\n\nOh, mellow out gang. GG Allin was an offensive disgusting anti-musical self-destructive prat, but taken on his own terms he was the inevitable evolution of the Iggy Pop punk-nihilism syndrome taken to it's logical extreme. GG Allin was a product of the wierd, sick environment he was raised in (dirt floor, no electicity, religious zealot father) and he ascended to the depths of his destiny. If he didn't do it, somebody else would have so just get over it.\n\nscumfuc_69@yahoo.com (Jake Strange)\n\n1st off, half the people on here never heard GG's music, but want to post their opinions based on reviews they read? That's fucking lame! Go pick up a record or CD, then judge him! So, he's taken a shit & flung it into the crowd, sometimes I wish I had the balls to do that. Haven't you ever felt like doing that at some point? Even the guy who reviewed these albums admits to not knowing much about GG. Lame. You idiots need something to base your opinions on before they can be valid! And some of you base your opinions on gossip, which is not in any way \"punk.\" So if you don't like GG, I can respect that (I guess), but if you don't know anything about him, check him out before you decide and make your uninformed \"opinions.\" Fuck you all! The ScumFuc disease will never cease to spead until you're all dead or either realize how fucking lame you are....\n\nrockylisa@yahoo.com (Rob Potts)\n\nWhen I was in the military I knew a girl from NY who knew GG ALLIN. She hooked him up with a gig in a San Diego club. He kicked over a bunch of shit on the bar and was thrown out. I actually talked to him on the phone. He said fuck San Diego and was never coming back. He was a scumbag and died. Whatever...\n\nalexindc108@yahoo.com\n\nI'll second that, Scumfuc_69. These people who judge GG Allin without even watching or listening to him...I mean come on - where's the logic in that? Secondly....those of us who DO like him don't want to hear you're sniveling little diatribes. Go away! You're never going to change any minds. The fact that you all care enough to take some time out of your day to hate on him ... well, the irony of that is pretty thick ain't it?\n\nAlso: Mr. Prindle, definitely check out the 'Savage South - Best of 1992' DVD ... it's as good as \"Raw Brutal Rough and Bloody - 1991\"\n\nPiss\n\nAdd your thoughts? Aloha From Dallas (by GG Allin & the Texas Nazis) - Last Call/Flesh 1995\n\nRecorded live at the Twilight Ballroom on August 17th, 1985 during the whirlwind Eat My Fuc tour with Tracy Chapman, this CD features just about the dumbest stage patter you're like to ever hear.\n\n\"Any you girls who wanna get fucked or raped, come out in front.

Plus, you can't hear him hurl his feces! If it's live GG Allin you want, go VHS. Then you can hear him hurl his feces!\n\nIsn't it cool how, regardless of GG's big master plan to be the most extreme and violent entertainer of all time, all anybody remembers is that he crapped onstage all the time? I have a theory about this -- we're desensitized to violence, drug use and profanity by TV and the media (and television), but how often do you get to see a big Hollywood actor star crap in a movie and then throw it at someone? See, this should be demonstrated in school everyday for children, so they won't be so upset when they grow up and GG Allin craps on them.\n\nWARNING TO COMPLETISTS: This is the same album as Boozin' And Pranks so don't buy them both!\n\nAdd your thoughts? Hated In The Nation - Danceteria/ROIR 1987\n\nAnother compilation. This one's cool because it features lots of soundbites of GG in concert talking like a dumbass. Also has some answering machine messages including what sounds like the guitarist from the Dead Kennedys asking GG to open a show for them! Lots of the material can be found on the last two records I just reviewed though, so don't be fooled into giving all your money to the coproate monster moneygrubbering sleazebags at ROIR.\n\nSo why do you need this album? Because there's a song on it called \"Ten Year Old Fuck.\" It's about fucking 10-year-old girls. GG Allin was a class act and a friend to all.\n\nReader Comments\n\nrdidonato@austin.rr.com (Rosa-Maria Di Donato)\n\nGG also waxes poetic on this album: \"I love diarrhea. So much of it for you hee-yuh.\" Plus if all the \"punk\" bands around nowadays heard \"Hard Candy,\" they'd quit like they should.\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nMy relationship with this album is love/hate.\n\nLOVE: The selection of songs on here is impeccable. Sure, it's light on the Jabbers material, but GG had grown past that, and in order to advance his notoriety and \"mission\", as he tried to do with each album, it would have seemed best to focus on the current state of GG's music. Secondly, and most importantly, GG assembled a veritable mid-80's alt-rock supergroup during the 1986 New York Superscum tour from which the live versions of \"Ass Fuckin, Butt Suckin...\", \"Blood for You\", \"Drink Fight & Fuck\", \"Eat My Diarrhea\", and \"Ten Year Old Fuck\" were culled. With Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth on guitar (n.b.: this was just months before SY charmed the alt-rock world with their hat trick of classic albums- EVOL, Sister, and Daydream Nation); Gerard Cosloy, president of Homestead Records (later co-prez of Matador Records); and Mykel Board of Artless as producer. With a guest appearance by Dinosaur, Jr.'s J Mascis. What is not to love? And more importantly, how did GG possibly get all these alt-rock luminaries to tour with him, especially since at this point he was already quite notorious in the alt-rock/underground rock world?\n\nHATE: Mykel Board, using snippets of prerecorded between-song banter, tried to construct this album as \"the GG show that could never be\" (since his shows rarely lasted more than two or three songs due to the cops or club owners pulling the plug on his antics). BAD IDEA. If GG fans wanted a real-life full-length live CD with all the hits on it, Boozing and Pranks more than fills the bill. (\"Show that could never be\", my ass!) But as it is, the splices between the prerecorded material and the songs (culled mostly from his albums, sometimes from other live shows) sound ridiculously amateurish. I realize that the level of recording technology available to an underground rock producer in the mid-80's would probably be pretty primitive, but if you can't make the editing sound professional, don't bother doing it! Sure, your average drunken, drug-addled GG fan won't notice or care, but then again. he could have slapped all the same songs on there and called it Grea! test Hits 1984-87 and ended up with essentially the same CD minus everything that is wrong with it. And it would still function as probably the most definitive GG Allin greatest hits collection to this day, because as it happened, 1984-87 is when most of GG's greatest hits were recorded.\n\nspinaltomek@hotmail.com\n\nI don't like GG Allin as much as I thought I would. I'm a lot into provocative music, extraordinary performances and that kind of stuff. I like the Dwarves a lot, especially for their early 90s live actions. And GG Allin was probably one of the most impressive live acts of all time. But the music is often kind of dull. I really like songs like \"Bite It You Scum\", but then again, that's just Ramonesy punk with more provocative lyrics. It's not extremely fast or aggressive music, it's not very creative. For the most part its pretty generic. And my impression is that this guy takes everything pretty serious. Probably you have to at some point or otherwise you wouldn't be rolling in your own shit every other night. I'd just prefer this if it would be a little more self ironic.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Insult & Injury Volume 4: Live at the Rocket 2-15-87 Providence, RI (with Afterbirth) - Black & Blue 1997\n\nApparently the story behind this flaky concert is that GG found himself booked but lacking a band. His pals in Afterbirth said \"Howdy-do!\" and they learned five songs. So this hour-length concert features five songs.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: GG ALLIN DID NOT WRITE EPICS.\n\nSo what's a guy to do when he's contractually obligated to stay onstage for a full hour, but only has 15 minutes of material? Why, CURSE a lot, of course! And GG Allin's just the man for that position here at the corporation.\n\nAs such, this is sort of the The Day the Laughter Died of the GG Allin catalog. Just as Andrew \"Dice\" Clay's audience for that outing grew increasingly uncomfortable waiting for a punchline that never came, GG's audience becomes more and more exasperated as the minutes between songs stretch on and on and on. Honestly, \"Dice\" was much more successful at torturing his audience, but then he had more experience in the field.\n\nThe songs are \"Blood for You,\" \"Teacher's Pet,\" \"I Wanna Rape You,\" \"Sluts in the City\" and \"Drink, Fight & Fuck.\" All are muffled and unlistenable, the first and fourth are godawful songs, and the fifth is sung by GG as he lies on the ground with a male audience member urinating into his mouth. I'm pretty sure he stole this gimmick from Neil Diamond, but his retching, gargling, gagging delivery is an absolute scream regardless.\n\nIf you've happened upon my Ted Nugent review page, you may be familiar with a 'live album' game entitled \"Which of these quotes are actual Ted Nugent comments made at this concert, and which are not?\" I would now like to play this very same game with GG Allin's Insult & Injury Volume 4. Let us begin!\n\n\"As long as I don't take a shit onstage, these motherfuckers are gonna pay me! So I may just stand up here and beat off all night 'cuz I don't really give a fuck. Really! You can all leave right now because I don't give a fuck!\"\n\n\"I'll really do it! I'll suck this guy's cock onstage.\"\n\n\"If any girl's been wearing her panties for two days, and they really smell - if you're ugly, I'll give you five bucks, if you're good-lookin', I'll give you ten. And if you're beautiful, I'll fuck you for 25!\"\n\n\"I'm ugly, right? I'm an ugly fuckin' scumbag!\"\n\n\"I am fucking God! I'm the fucking cunt of the Earth!\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's great? You paid six bucks to hear a ramblin' idiot!\"\n\n\"Who took my fuckin' glass? I want that fuckin' glass! Don't fuckin' touch it, cunt!\"\n\n\"Come on, give me AIDS!\"\n\n\"It don't matter; I've lost all my teeth anyway.\"\n\n\"Where's the guy that wants to get his dick sucked?\"\n\n\"I want those underpants. Fill 'em with piss!\"\n\n\"That didn't hurt. pussy. Pussy!\"\n\n\"Fuck you too, you fuckin' Mohawk fuckin' queer!\"\n\n\"Are there any underage children here that wanna get laid?\"\n\n\"If I shit in my hand, will one of you motherfuckers eat it?\"\n\n\"I could take a shit right now and throw it at you, and you'd be running out the fuckin' doors because you're a bunch of fuckin' pussies!\"\n\n\"I wanna rape somebody tonight! You could be willing, or I'm just gonna go for ya. What's it gonna be?\"\n\n\"I've fucked my dog, I've fucked my brother, but tonight I wanna fuck a girl!\"\n\n\"I ain't no fuckin' good-looking guy. I'm ugly! I can't get laid! I have to beat off!\"\n\n\"I beat off fuckin' six times a fuckin' day!\"\n\n\"Fuck niggers! Fuck Abraham Lincoln! Hurray for the KKK! I hate niggers! Fuck jigaboos too!\"\n\n\"I wanna fuckin' rape and abuse young girls! And if you don't like it, get the fuck outta here!\"\n\n\"Does anybody have any drugs?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you give me the finger but you're a fat fuckin' asshole!\"\n\n\"You know what I really wish I could do though? I wish I could take a shit on you!\"\n\n\"Where's that purple-haired bitch? I'd like to beat on her a few times!\"\n\n\"You want more? You don't even deserve my fuckin' shit! And I won't even shit on you!\"\n\n\"I'd like to rape about three or four more girls.\"\n\n\"Thank you! I wanted a mouthful of piss and I got it!\"\n\n\"All you gotta do is hate niggers and hate spics and be a goddamned scumfuck. Fuck everybody!\"\n\n\"I gotta get off the stage, the guy said. So fuck you! I hope you all get killed on the way home! And I don't give a fuck about each and every one of you, so eat my asshole! You want more? Well, fuck you!\"\n\nANSWER KEY: It was a trick question! All of those quotes were actually pulled from Barack Obama's recent State of the Union address.\n\nThe funniest part of the CD comes after the tragic debacle finally crawls to its overdue end, when the club's announcer jumps onstage to say, \"Okay, let's all thank GG Allin for a great set!\"\n\nAdd your thoughts? You Give Love A Bad Name (by GG Allin & the Holy Men) - Homestead 1987\n\nWhere in Sam Frank's Disco did GG Allin's voice disappear to? Suddenly he doesn't just sound scraggly - he sounds downright disgusting! He's just screaming his obscene lyrics like there's a huge ball of disgusting phlegm lodged in his throat that he enjoys having there so he's not bothering to hack it up in public like a generous person would think to do. And his new band The Holy Men don't even play \"punk rock\"! They're distorted, trashy and noisy as hell, but the music is more of a midtempo slash-and-burn grunge noise figpuck sound, with just a couple fast 'uns thrown in for the kids to dig.\n\nAnother really good record for GG. Critics hate this guy, but fuck them. They don't know what rock and roll is if they can't see the headbanging, hilarious aspects of shit like \"I'm A Rapest\" (his spelling, not mine), \"Teenage Twats\" and \"Swank Fucking,\" which begins the record with the stirring couplet, \"Your pussy smells like piss/Your asshole smells like shit.\" GG Allin - fabled poet of the Underwood!\n\nAlthough this record certainly doesn't include any of GG's best known songs, it's very consistent, with only two slow trudgers kinda testing the patience a bit. And a Charles Manson cover!!!! Just like the Lemonheads and Guns 'N Roses! But different! Because this song is actually a GOOD Charles Manson song! Even though I think Charles Manson is an asshole and anybody who glorifies him deserves to have their loved ones slaughtered so they can see how \"wicked cool\" it is!\n\nReader Comments\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nThe first time I ever heard this album, it instantly earned a place as my least favorite GG Allin CD of all time. But after I gave it a few more listens, I discovered that the songs-- some of them, anyway-- are all right, they just need some time to grow on you. In fact, there are even a couple of GG albums I now like less than this one (\"Suicide Sessions\" and \"Brutality and Bloodshed...\", to be specific). Obviously, GG's music has a new and distinctly non-punk sound here. By his own admission, GG had been heavily into heroin at about this time; I don't know what if anything that has to do with the fact that that the lyrics and songwriting have both gone down the crapper since his days with the Scumfucs, but I do know that if even GG Allin himself thought he was doing too much heroin, he had to have been doing a hell of a lot. As Mark said, this is an album full of mostly droning, atonal grunge sleaze, but there are a few songs that do distinguish themselves enough to mak! e me enjoy them. \"I'm a Rapest\" is one of only a handful of GG songs whose lyrics can still, to this very day, offend me. And, even though it's not particularly distinctive or well-done, I still for some reason love the lead guitar work on \"Scars On My Body, Scabs On My Dick\" as well as the jaunty little melody at the end of each chorus of \"Tough Fuckin' Shit\". (Notwithstanding that, I still say the original Cedar Street Sluts version of that song was better.) Thumbs are definitely down, though, to \"Beer Picnic\" and the pointless, unnecessary, and poorly performed Charles Manson cover. 6/10. Note: The CD version of this album includes the 6-song \"Watch Me Kill\" single at the end, without explaining that this was not originally part of the album. While the single is a much better piece of work overall than this album, it still doesn't quite fit in with the overall feel of the original album. Stick with the vinyl-- very good advice in any musical situation, actually.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Live...Carolina In My Ass 7\" (by GG Allin & the Primates) - Repo 1990\n\nDear G.G.,\n\nI just wanted to say thank you for paying tribute to me in the title of your latest single, Live...Carolina in My Ass. As a fellow artist, I know you understand the hard work that goes into creating a great song. And when I reached into the deepest recesses of my soul way back in '68 to create the lasting folk classic \"Carolina On My Mind,\" I never in my wildest hopes imagined that it would one day serve as the inspiration for a muffled live recording of \"Cock on the Loose\" and \"Diarrhea Blues\".\n\nDon't get me wrong: I'm a big fan of \"Out for Blood\" and \"Drink, Fight & Fuck\" too, and they've more than earned their placement on Live...Carolina in My Ass. But for my money, your brilliant poetic mind shines most brightly on the other two tracks. Although I own the lion's share of your discography, I must admit unfamiliarity with \"Diarrhea Blues\" prior to this release. Was it an improvised live track? Or perhaps a tour-penned composition that you never got around to recording in the studio? Whatever the case, I adore its sludgy Flipper-style bass line and am already planning a cover version with my guest, Linda Ronstadt.\n\nIn addition to your skillful songcraft, I'm highly impressed by your charismatic stage patter, and will definitely have to begin my next set with \"If you're wondering who's got the smallest dick in the world, you're looking at it right now.\" Furthermore, I can only imagine the look of relief that must've appeared on your fans' faces when you assured them, \"You can come up - I'm done shittin' now!\" You can bet that the next time I defecate onstage in the middle of \"You've Got a Friend,\" I will issue my audience the same assurance.\n\nMy only complaint with Live...Carolina in My Ass is the sound quality. Did you literally have the tape recorder stored inside your anus? The murky, muffled sound sucks all the bite out of your punk rock attack -- though luckily the tuneful melodies remain.\n\nIn conclusion, I just want to reiterate how thrilled I am that you chose to reference one of my songs in the title of your record. Please feel free to do so any time you'd like! I've attached an addendum with a few examples.\n\nWith deepest sincerity,\n\nJames Taylor\n\nADDENDUM\n\nLive...Fire and Stain\n\nLive...Mockingturd (with Carly Simon)\n\nLive...How Sweet it Is (to Be Loved by Poo)\n\nLive...You've Got a Friend in Your Ass\n\nAdd your thoughts? Expose Yourself To Kids 7\" (by GG Allin & the AIDS Brigade) - Homestead 1988\n\nBy this point, GG's voice was getting REALLY rough, perhaps from all the little pieces of poop stuck on the sides of his throat. But all three riffs on this three-riff single are too basic generic pop-punky for my blood (taste).\n\n(taste my blood)\n\nThe title track is hilarious and ridiculously mean-spirited, but \"I'm A Gypsy Motherfucker\" sounds too much like the Ramones' \"All The Way,\" and \"Hangin' Out With Jim\" might as well be Screeching Weasel for its complete lack of understanding of why the Ramones were a great and important band (hint: it had nothing to do with sissyass pop-punk songs about girls).\n\nSay! Did you ever notice that when you mix up the letters in GG Allin, you get \"Vanilla\"? You also have to change the two \"G\"s to a \"V\" and an \"A,\" but to me that makes it even MORE spooky.\n\nReader Comments\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nYay! This is the only truly, consistently great piece of work to come from GG Allin in the entire period between the breakup of the Scumfucs and the collaboration with Antiseen (1985-1991). Also, it's the last music he would ever record that could by any stretch of the imagination be called \"punk\". All three of these songs became late-period classics and concert staples for GG, and they all deserved it much more than that piece of shit lame-ass \"Outlaw Scumfuc\" song. I obviously agree with Mark in his love for the title track, but I think he gives short shrift to \"Gypsy Motherfucker\" which is equally as \"hilarious and ridiculously mean-spirited\" as the title track, and yes, \"Hangin' Out with Jim\" is not as good as the first two, but it's way better than anything on his previous two albums. 9/10.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Doctrine Of Mayhem - Black & Blue 1990\n\nGG's catalog is impossible to keep track of. Various labels have released so darn many singles, EPs, compilations and especially live CDs that I've just given up (a) trying to figure out the correct order for the discography and (b) buying up all the various shmoot and shelackle. But Doctrine Of Mayhem is a necessity. It's a compilation featuring a little acoustic GG, a little of a short-lived band he had called the Cedar Street Sluts, and a whole lotta awesome Scumfucs material, much of which could very well be called the greatest material of his career. Classic angry catchy punk anthems of hate like \"Bite It You Scum,\" \"I Wanna Piss On You,\" \"I Wanna Fuck Myself\" (later covered by Faith No More!), \"Needle Up My Cock,\" \"Fuck The Dead\" and \"Ass Fuckin' Butt Suckin'\" carry on that awesome Scumfucs tradition that made Eat My Fuc such a wonderfully cleansing blast of fury and stupidity. Two versions of the slow, ugly pretentious \"Blood For You\" (in which GG refers to himself as Jesus Christ, among other deities) are a bit much though, and \"GG's Xmas Song\" reaches way, way, WAY over the line of \"pointless profanity.\" See, it's a parody of the 12 Days of Christmas, but it's all stuff like \"Cunts A-Layin',\" \"Pussies Fuckin',\" \"Crusty Panties\" and other hilarious line parodies like that. With just GG and his acoustic guitar. Give me the uproarious good times of the Bob Rivers Comedy Corporation any day!\n\nGive me Dr. Demento's Greatest Christmas Novelty Hits Of All Time any day!\n\nGive me Christmas With The Vandals any day!\n\nGive me the Beach Boys' Christmas Album any day!\n\nGive me The Ventures' Christmas Album any day!\n\nGive me Paul Revere And The Raiders' Christmas Present any day!\n\nDon't give me Patsy And Elmo's Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer any day!\n\nBy the way, I pissed off a guy at work by sending an email around comparing his newborn daughter to a groundhog. Can you believe the sensitivity of some people? Sheesh. What he needs is some nice ASS FUCKIN! BUTT SUCKIN! CUNT LICKIN! MASTURBATION!!!!!\n\nHuh? No, I didn't make that up. It's a line from a song.\n\nHuh? NO! It's not from Huey Lewis And The News' \"The Heart Of Rock And Roll\"! Jesus! Would you just drop the issue?\n\nAdd your thoughts? * Freaks, Faggots, Drunks & Junkies (by GG Allin & Bulge) - Homestead 1988 *\n\nThis is the album that made me a GG Allin fan (from afar, of course), so let it do the same for you! Nineteen horrific tracks, covering the gamut from spoken word to country/western to hardcore punk to avante noise to industrial noise to trash grunge to AC/DC-style hard rock -- all driven into the dirt by a disgustingly reverbed mud-level guitar tone, shitty airplane hangar-quality production, vomitously low, grizzled screamed vocals and yet another batch of stupid, offensive lyrics with no attention at all placed on \"rhyme\" or \"point.\"\n\nOh, would you have written \"reason\" instead of \"point\"? Well, I guess that's why I'm the world famous record reviewer Mark Prindle and you're just the lowly high-powered CEO of Microsoft, which is probably named after the inferior state of your phallus. Brian Wilson covers on this one include \"Be My Fuckin Whore,\" \"Suck My Ass It Smells,\" \"Dog Shit,\" \"Sleeping In My Piss,\" \"Anti Social Masterbator\" (his spelling, not mine. I would have spelled it \"Auntie\"), \"Last In Line For The Gang Bang,\" \"Cunt Sucking Cannibal,\" \"Commit Suicide\" and \"My Bloody Mutilation.\" 50 minutes long! Why haven't you bought it yet? Do you think I'm doing this for fame and romance?\n\nReader Comments\n\ndrazy@gatecity.com\n\nNot even ratable and I questions one's intelligence who give this piece of shit a ten. My cousin and I tinkered with GG when we were teenagers and didn't know any better. We're both over thirty now, and have created more danger, excitement, and virtuosity during our 45 minute rendition of The Stooges \"No Fun\" than this sociopath created in his entire lifetime. Anyone who gets a thrill out of this stuff (eating poop, punching out members of the audience, threatening to kill himself on stage, etc.) should avoid admitting it in public, let alone on line. Send me half of what you would pay for anything GG ever did and I will send you a cassette of me farting. I promise, it would be closer to real music than this fuck ever imagined.\n\nJohnnyB8@aol.com\n\nare you an idiot?? how does this ant-piss(/pissant) get a 10 and NO miles davis album get higher than an 8?? i realize that you dislike jazz, but cmon. this crap doesn't deserve the plastic cd that it was printed on damnit! this is a load of crap. how can you even recognize someone who eats their own ass-fun (poop)? man mark, ill still read your reviews but, this one, well this one is a little bit stupid. By The Way, besides you, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY LISTENED TO GG ALLIN? WHO THE HELL IS HE? If all he does is sing about raping girls, gay men, eating crap, drinking piss, and doing every drug he can find, then the bastard deserved to die. Peace Marky.......\n\nWBinder007@aol.com\n\nOh wow, never thought I'd agree with drazy about anything. Granted, we do disagree on certain things, like, say, the proper spelling of 'The Strokes.' (A hint, drazy- there's an 'r' in 'Strokes.') And just how much they fucking suck. (Answer: Quite a considerable amount.) But anyways, GG is a, well, how can I say this, oh yes, that's right: an embarrasment to the entire entertainment industry and much of the human race. Unlike some on this page, I have had the misfortune of hearing some of GG's \"music,\" and regret it mightily. Face it, there aren't any riffs, just noise and offensive lyrics. And not in that borderline entertaining way like Anal Cunt, either. This is just plain atrocious. It's too bad he didn't die before all of his noted \"accomplishments,\" which seem to be limited to criminal activity, (some minor offenses and some very serious ones) and terrible music. Because really, that kind of person is the kind of person we need more of in society. Waste of fucking flesh if you ask me.\n\narmlesspete@hotmail.com (Robin Kempson)\n\ngg on a whole...listen to more of his songs..there are some classics, even if your not down with the whole scat man thing.\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nEverybody seems to think this is GG's best album, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. The best songs are only marginally better than those on his last album, and the abundance of shitty songs on this album makes it even more inconsistent than \"Eat My Fuc\". The droning, grungy, Melvinsy sound that debuted on his last album continues here. I suppose I should applaud his feeling the need for a change of direction, since the classic, old-school-punk musical palette that he was previously drawing from was totally dated by 1985, but I wish he'd have replaced it with something halfway interesting to listen to. I realize GG wasn't as musically adept as the guys in Black Flag, Husker Du, or the Minutemen who were taking the same quandary and using it to make timeless, sonically adventurous music, but for God's sake, I could have done better than this-- and I was 7 at the time. Also, with the notable exception of \"Outlaw Scumfuc\" where he gives it a half-assed shot, GG does! n't even seem to be bothering to try to actually SING on any of these songs. Speaking of which, \"Outlaw Scumfuc\" is the only real honest-to-God classic on here, and it's totally undeserving of the status. It's an okay song, to be sure, but not in the same league as his work with the Scumfucs. Other sings I enjoy on this album are \"Antisocial Masterbator\", \"Dog Shit\", \"I Wanna Kill You, \"Be My Fucking Whore\", and \"Young Little Meat\". Sure, that may seem like a long list of good songs, but when you consider pieces of shit that never should have been recorded like \"My Revenge\", \"Family\", \"Wild Riding\", \"Suck My Ass It Smells\", and \"My Bloody Mutilation\", you realize that this album is mediocre at best. 6/10.\n\nUNHOLYROLLER666@webtv.net\n\nThis was the first GG record I ever bought and it made a believer out of me.I bought it after looking at some of the song titles.Great fucking record from start to finish,fuck these pussies that can't dig GG.Go listen to Blink 182 or something,fucking cunts.....\n\nhauntedken@hotmail.com\n\nThis is classic GG, the first one I listened to and still my favorite. Catchy, yet raw, This just isn't a great GG album, it's a great Rock and Roll album, up there with FunHouse and Beggars's Banquet. Definitive GG Allin, this is noisy and structured, recorded rough sound-wise, but somehow that helps the whole record out... brilliant.\n\njavier.blanco@asemas.es (Javier Blanco Perez)\n\nHi, Mark; nobody noticed how similar is this GG allin record to Turbonegro's Ass Cobra? I love that record (and of course, i know that was released about eight years after this Allin's one), so when i first heard the \"Faggots, Freaks, Drunks ...\" i thought that was a fine record (of noisy-scummy punk). Of course, i think the musicians in the norwegian outfir are much more capable than the ones behind GG, and the songs are more polished, with a poison idea-meets- the- misfits edge, but the decadent performance of Hank Von Velvete, the singer, is very similar to GG's one (listen to \" I got erection\", \"Black Rabbit\" or the song in norwegian about the new wave hooker girls and the punk rockers...)\n\nGreetings...\n\nscumfuc_69@yahoo.com (Jake Strange)\n\nThis album, even though it is very roughly mixed is one of GG's best. Some refer to it as GG's bible. There are a few boring and even stupid songs on here, such as \"Wild Riding\" & \"Crash & Burn\" but nevertheless, the only thing that can drive a true Rock 'n Roll fan from this record is the questionable production. GG covers most of his life up to that point on this record, such as his lust for sluts & whores, alcohol (all of which I love too), abuse, filth, body fluids, blood, intravenious drugs, and more!!! It even has a pro-suicide song!!! How can you beat that?!?! Especially with all those cocksucking metal bands getting shit for supposedly making songs that made kids commit suicide (which is false), here is a man who actually wrote a song that obviously encouraged suicide. I always thought my band could do better than GG concerning offensive & controversial lyrics until I heard this record & realized I was wrong. Though this is one of his many badly produced records (the bass is barely audible!!!) it is definitely one of the best, & that is not open for debate.\n\nsteve.robey@mindspring.com\n\nI bought this album because I was curious and tend to like extreme stuff. But Jesus H Christ on a Whole Wheat Bun, this shit is scary. I've hardly ever listened to it again (it sounds terrible), but I love the song titles. \"Suck My Ass it Smells\" still makes me laugh out loud (and Mark, I've seen you refer to it several times in your other reviews - even for the Monkees and crap!), and I can sometimes be found whistling \"Be My Fuckin' Whore\" to myself while at work (\"Hey!\" my boss says, \"Isn't that GG Allin?\" \"Why yes,\" I reply, \"Wanna borrow it?\").\n\nIf you're fascinated by the criminally insane, give this one a spin. GG Allin is so frickin pathetic and repulsive you can't turn away (like Jon Bon Jovi!). And I only say this because I know he's passed away (if you can put it that gently), cause otherwise he might hunt me down. So if you're a fan out there with a scary-sounding email address, just remember: I'm 8 feet tall and 400 pounds and I own an attack elephant.\n\nMs. Anne Thrope\n\nThis, from start to finish, is one of the most dementedly enjoyable albums to which I have ever listened. The only artists that came close to GG Allin were Pussy Galore, but they weren't nearly as extreme or self-destructive. What strikes me most about FFD&J is how triumphant Allin manages to sound on the majority of songs, telling the listener: \"You haven't lived until you've slept in your own piss and raped a 10-year-old girl!\" That's the kind of stuff Allin says in his interviews, but he sounds so genuine on this album that you just have to laugh at the extremity of his statements.\n\nThe best song on this album is \"Outlaw Scumfuc\" of course, GG Allin's anthem. One could imagine a whole room full of Scumfucs from the \"Scumfuc Society\" raising their mugs of beer and bellowing out this tune while bashing their heads against various objects. The best song is not necessarily my *favorite* song however; that honor belongs to \"Caroline & Sue.\" The entire song is so hilarious in its explicit imagery that I can't ever sing it to myself without cracking up laughing at some point. \"Let's celebrate GG being double-teamed by two washed-up whores, one a regular woman and one a transvestite\"; it's just too much!\n\nDespite what people have said about the \"sound quality\" of the album (there's hardly any), said quality is both completely appropriate to the artist and really *makes* the album. I didn't like \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" because the sound quality was too *good*, and the musicians were far too professional.\n\nI have issues with this album only from an organizational stand-point. First of all, tracks 16-18 shouldn't be on the album; the sound on the tracks isn't consistent with the rest of the music. I like the tracks, they just shouldn't be on FFD&J. Second, \"Wild Riding\" and \"Crash & Burn\" really suck, and should have been tossed from the get go. Third, the tracks -- the ones that should be on the album -- should have been organized so as to make the album flow better from start to finish, although I do like the idea of book-ending the album with the two \"spoken-word\" tracks.\n\nIn conclusion, anyone who is entertained by extreme nihilism should buy this album. All others shouldn't bother.\n\njohnllbar@verizon.net\n\nBecause numerous people have posted that \"Outlaw scumfuc\" was their favorite song on the album. I hope they all know its a cover. well music and lyric structure, at least of \"Longhaired Redneck\" by David Allin Coe. though, GG Probably had a reason for covering a D.A.C. song (he knew his rock history) David Allan Coe released an album in the early 70's called \"Nothing Sacred\" which had such ditties on it as FINGER FUCKIN SALLY, LAY ME DOWN SOME RAILS (about cocaine) CUMSTAINS ON THE PILLOW, WHITE GIRL WITH A NIGGER, FUCK ANITA BRYANT (pro gay song, go figure) FUCKIN IN THE BUTT and some others. that was for years, and maybe still is... THE Most Offensive Country Album ever. (it's SO out of print) So GG had good source material. I've said it before, but I love your site, thanx\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nNow for the man who sings with feces in his throat. Well. . .\n\nHot poop. This is almost as good as Damaged! Yeah, it's a complete bloody ripoff of that album (style-wise), but in this case, both the lead singer and lead guitar player are better. Henry Rollins, for all his pain and rage, was just a confused, pissed-off kid--this GG Allin fellow is a DANGEROUS MAN. A DANGEROUS SCREAMING MAN (with diarrhea all over himself). No WONDER he got arrested like twenty times.\n\nDamaged may be a more unified LP, and Black Flag may be a more impressive sonic force (not to mention more. . . er, socially responsible in their lyricism) (sisicciss, ississism. Ism.), but this album has the better songs. Call me Sammy Hagar if you want, but \"Be My Fuckin' Whore\" has STILL not left my head. And there's at least six or seven other tunes that are just as good on here.\n\nNow, if only the last song weren't just RANDOM FUCKING NOISES for NO REASON for FIVE MINUTES, I'd consider advancing this album to \"List Candidacy.\" As it is, it's merely \"almost as good as Damaged.\" What a sad, fecal-matter-saturated world this be.\n\nDevilock138_719@MSN.COM\n\nFinally, someone agrees with me that this album is amazing. I don't really care for 'My Bloody Mutilation' too much though (Or at all), but I consider the closing song to be 'Cunt Sucking Cannibal' so that one doesn't really count... I must have read this somewhere down the line a long time ago because I always have thought of the production as how you put it here in this review (shitty airplane hangar-quality).\n\nI don't see how not many people like this. It's got a real noise rock kind of feel to it and it's very eclectic as well. I usually refer to this as GG's 'art' album (When I'm actually with some people who know half a shit about music which is usually never!).\n\nLester East\n\nIt pisses me off that people dont want to admit that GG had anything to offer Rock n Roll just because of the shitting and raping. First off, there is no documented case of GG actually raping anybody as far as I know. He did get time for allegedly handcuffing and torturing an Ann Arbor woman against her will; who I hear later admitted it was consensual after his death. What people dont like to acknowledge is that the woman was obviously obsessed over GG. She went to his show and asked him to marry her before she ever even met him. She invited the whole band to stay at her place and even waited a day or two after the alleged torturing to report the incident to police. What people really dont like to acknowledge is that they more than likely deserved all they got from GG. Second, what the fuck? All his act consisted of was him taking the most negative aspects of Iggys act and taking them to the limits. There have been documented cases of Iggy defecating behind the full stacks and throwing bits of it at audience members. I also read that a few women got seriously hurt at Stooges shows. Once Iggy grabbed a woman by the face and hurled her across the floor. He also accidentally kicked a woman in the chin, causing her to bite part of her own tongue off. We all know about Iggy vomiting on stage and cutting his chest to bits. People, including myself, worship Iggy. Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground can get away with making offensive noise (Sister Ray, I Heard Her Call My Name) and people call it genius. Lou Reed has often admitted to doing some pretty vile shit back in the day sucking cock and ass and shooting up dope that guy is considered the cream of the crop of punk icons.\n\nGGs work is obviously built on the groundwork of people like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Jim Morison, Alice Cooper and Rocky Ericson; going all the way back to Hank Williams, Jerry Lee Louis and Elvis Presley. GG and his brother Merle knew and know more about Rock n Roll history than most of the fuckers around playing it now days. Why didnt GG push the limits in a positive way? Because Rock n Roll is suppose to be dangerous. Rock n Roll is supposed to offend decent people and scare parents. If Rock n Roll fails to do this then its stagnant. I will say this, by the time of GGs death his shows had gotten bigger. I saw a few performances behind barricades in front of head shop mentality grunge kids and it had gone from rock show to freak show.\n\nI know how tired I am after a show lugging around amps and playing my ass off for 20 people. Not to mention nursing the wicked hangover I usually have the next day. Can you imagine abusing drugs and alcohol, beating yourself to a bloody pulp, passing out on the floor and waking up to catch a Greyhound bus to do it again? GG did it time and time over.\n\nIf there ever was a Rock n Roll savior it wasnt Elvis or John Lennon. No, it wasnt Kurt Cobain. Who else in Rock music endured such bodily injuries as Jesus before his crucifixion (on a nightly basis I will add)? Who else in Rock had such a small yet devote group of outcast and misfits as followers? Who else was as loathed by his own people as GG? Who else in Rock offered his flesh and blood for the eating? You, me, or any other self proclaimed Rockers will never outdo what GG had done before us. You will never have to push the violence or vileness to the extreme because GG did it for you. In a way he did die for our ability to rock without possibly dying. If you intend on being a threat to the industry then go ahead. Youll never outdo GG and why bother tying? You dont even have to try to come close. Hell, his birth name was even Jesus Christ Allin.\n\nBesides all that, the guy had a hand in writing over a hundred songs and most of them were catchy as fuck. Even the cover tunes that he rewrote are still great.\n\nAdd your thoughts? No Room for Nigger 7\" (by GG Allin & the Scumfucs) - Fuckin' A 1993\n\nOkay, that's not a very nice sentiment. But look, the guy hated everybody; it's not like he was going to make an exception for black people. Plus, he clearly just recorded this song for shock value; there's no actual racist substance to it at all. In fact, here is the entire lyric, but with the offending word replaced by \"cracker\":\n\nNo room for you\n\nNo room for you\n\nIn my eyes\n\nNo room for you\n\nIn my eyes\n\nNo room for you in my world\n\nNo, no room for cracker\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nNo room for you in my world\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nNo room for you\n\nNo, no room for you\n\nNo room for you in my world\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nNo, no room\n\nNo room for you in my world\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nCracker, cracker, cracker, cracker\n\nNo, no, no room for you in my world\n\nNo room for you in my world\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nNo, no room for cracker\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nNo room for cracker\n\nAnd voila! It's an obstinate parrot.\n\nMore importantly, the song is grinding, growling and deranged, as is the sick fuzzed-out headbanger b-side \"Kiss Me in the Gutter.\" This single will melt your stereo and jam a screwdriver into your ear.\n\nFeel free to use that last sentence in your match.com profile.\n\nReader Comments\n\nPeter\n\nThis was actually GG and Mark Sheehan, I think recorded during Suicide Sessions (Kiss Me in the Gutter is listed on the tape but doesn't appear), though a demo appears on an 88 tape with other Suicide Session songs labelled Scumfucs Reunion (which may or may not be with the Scumfucs), others of which have turned up on the Violent Beatings compilation with a remastered version of the Watch Me Kill 7\" with Mark. And for some reason, it was only ever called No Room For Nigger on the limited edition colour picture sleeve, all others striking the latter half.\n\nThis is a pretty convoluted time. But goddamn dig that harmonica.\n\nAdd your thoughts? The Best Of The Suicide Sessions (by GG Allin & the Scumfucs) - Awareness 1997.\n\nIf this is the Best, I'd hate to hear the WORST!!!!\n\nBut all hilarious kidding aside, this is an itch-achingly disappointing collection of half-assed trudgers. It's all very poorly recorded, slow and noisy but only occasionally catchy and, because of GG's retched screaming tendencies of late, it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to understand the lyrics, which I'm sure are poetic and mature, much like the work of the late Robert Frost. Some of the stirring pieces on this wax-go-spin include \"Shit On My Prick,\" \"Cornhole Lust,\" \"Spread Your Legs, Part Your Lips,\" \"Stick A Cross Up A Nun's Cunt,\" \"Drug Whore\" and \"Lillian Phone Fucker.\"\n\nIt's just not very good. Too many of the songs are just a bunch of tuneless noise with GGG yelling over it. In fact, while playing it tonight, engaged in a heated game of Triple-Ball with my fiancee Brenda and my puppy Henry, I perceived some discomfort in the face of the woman component in the above equation. I sayeth to thine, \"What's wrong, are you tired?\" And she replied, \"Yeah, and I hate GG Allin.\" And I'm all like what the fuck, because she sang along with tons of the songs from the first three albums, remembering them from her punker days in high school (in fact, she insists that Always Was, Is And Always Shall Be should get the 10 - she LOVES \"Automatic\"). So I says, \"Huh? I thought you liked GG Allin?!?\" And, in that mysterious wily female way, she seductively replied, \"Not this shit.\"\n\nReader Comments\n\nPeptobsml@aol.com\n\nSuicide Sessions is a one-dot album if I ever heard one. No way this crap is four dots better than Family Man. Not that I'm saying Family Man is great stuff or anything, it's just that all the criticisms you applied to the music on that album apply here tenfold. Thank God I only downloaded this off Napster and promptly deleted it. Just think: if Lars Ulrich would have his way, I might have actually spent precious money BUYING that cd someday. HEYell naw!!\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nGG Allin at his most lyrically depraved and musically minimalist. All of the weak points of \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" and \"Freaks, Faggots, Drunks, and Junkies\"-- weak songwriting, a tendency towards tuneless noise both in terms of vocals and musicianship, overall air of half-assed thrown-togetheredness-- are amplified here tenfold. I suppose I should consider this album a complete piece of garbage, and half of it I absolutely do. But the best songs on here somehow stand among my favorite GG songs. Again, these are songs that you need to let grow on you. Like peptobsml@aol.com, I thought this was one-dot crap the first time I heard it. Maybe it's a dumbing-down process that allows you to eventually enjoy (some of) this music after a while, I don't know.\n\nThe songs on this album can be divided into three basic categories:\n\n1) Uninspired psychotic rants shouted over tuneless noise (\"Troubled Troubadour\", \"I'm Dying, I'm Dying, I'm Dead\", \"Pain and Suffering\", etc.)\n\n2) Songs whose lyrics consist of GG simply repeating the title over and over again, usually over slow, inane guitar chords (\"Shit On My Prick\", \"Cornhole Lust\"). If the title is vulgar, which of course it always is, it's good for a cheap laugh once or twice but gets old fast. (I suppose \"Stick A Cross Up A Nun's Cunt\" falls into this category too, but GG included a few other lines to repeat ad nauseam in addition to the title. Maybe it's my 12 hellish years of Catholic education, but hearing him yell \"Hail Mary, full of shit\" does it for me every time.)\n\n3) Actual songs! I might mention here that GG is beginning to display quite a talent for balladry (note: balladry here defined as \"storytelling through song\", not \"power ballads\"... ugh.) It's strange how the words GG uses in songs like \"Sitting In This Room\" and \"Liquor Slicked Highway\" combine with the things you already know or assume about him to evoke feelings and images with almost effortless effectiveness. Also, I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but last year when I was depressed after breaking up with my longtime girlfriend, \"Dagger In My Heart\" became the first-- and so far the only, thank god-- GG Allin song that I ever identified with. Other good songs on this disc include the almost belligerent self-loathing of \"I Live to Be Hated\", and \"Spread Your Legs, Part Your Lips\" which may be the best example ever of GG's penchant for callous misogyny and objectification of the female gender. 4/10-- yeah, there were some great songs on here, but more than half of the dis! c is unlistenable garbage. If he had whittled it down to maybe a six-song EP I could easily have doubled that grade!\n\nAdd your thoughts? Outside Inside 7\" (by GG Allin & the Disappointments) - Bitter Boy 1990\n\nApparently the groove on this record was etched backwards, allowing the listener to place the phonograph needle in the center of the record and watch it work its way to the edge. It's this sort of exciting novelty that makes so many of us yearn for the 'good old days,' before cutting-edge technology rendered vinyl obsolete with the introduction of the cassingle.\n\nLess novel is the audio component, which features live versions of four Freaks, Faggots, Bleeps & Blunders songs and a terrible cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Dead Flowers.\" The sound is interesting in that there's a slight slap back delay on everything (leading me to think this was a sound desk tape rather than an audience recording) but the guitar is completely drowned out by GG's growling delivery, leaving the songs a raspy husk of their former chainsaw glory.\n\nCharismatic words of wisdom include:\n\n\"Yeah I'm fucken drunk, fuck you!\"\n\n\"Fuck you, bitch!\"\n\n\"If you're gonna do it, motherfucker, do it right. Or don't fucken do it at all. And take your fucken chair, bitch!\"\n\n\"You gotta kiss ass to somebody. But not me! I don't kiss ass for nobody!\"\n\n\"Hail Mary, full of SHIT!\"\n\nI guess it should come as no surprise that \"GG Allin\" kinda rhymes with \"Jimmy Fallon.\"\n\nAdd your thoughts? Insult & Injury Volume 2: The Bloody Years - Black & Blue 1993\n\nOne thing we think I've all had my fill about is complaints about GG Allin sound quality. Sure, it mostly all sounds terrible but keep in mind the guy never had any money, and that which he did acquire was immediately spent on drugs. And soap? Oh MAN, the soap that guy purchased! One time Ivory called me and said \"Hay we're out because of GG Allin.\" What was I supposed to do about it? What, do I have a bunch of vegetable fat and lye sitting around my apartment? Of course I do, but that's for sex.\n\nThe thing is -- GG Allin may be the only performer in history whose voice, music, personal hygiene and general demeanor were so disgusting and fecal that his output is actually enhanced by its nearly unlistenable audio texture. This low sonic quality continues on Insult & Injury 2, which includes: (a) godawfully recorded 1986 live renditions of \"I Wanna Fuck Your Brains Out,\" \"I Wanna Rape You,\" \"I Wanna Fuck Myself,\" \"Teacher's Pet,\" \"Blood for You,\" \"Hard Candy Cock\" and \"Eat My Diarrhea\"; (b) excruciatingly recorded 1989 home recordings of songs entitled \"Sitting in This Room,\" \"Thinkin' & Drinkin',\" \"Peanut Butter Picnic\" and \"Ugly Friends\"; (c) pristine 120-track quadraphonic recordings of some telephone conversations; and (d) a song that's not by GG Allin.\n\nHere's something interesting: the title \"The Bloody Years\" refers not to GG's crimson-pigmented stage antics but rather a human being! This man, who goes by the name \"Bloody Mess,\" is another Black & Blue recording artist that the company apparently thought they could foist onto our collective consciences through the powerful medium of GG Allin. It doesn't work though, mainly because the guy sounds about 10 years old and spends most of his mic time ranting against \"poseurs\" (i.e. people who bathe). Still, he played a key role in all facets of this release, backing GG on the live material, supporting and co-writing the home recordings, documenting his telephone conversations Nixon-style, and forcing his band Bloody Mess & the Skabs to perform a spirited and enjoyable 1993 tribute entitled \"Murder Groupies.\"\n\nThe live material sounds like it was taped on a Recordio disc, but it's fun to hear the guitarist (Bloody?) sneak in licks from The Fall's \"C.R.E.E.P.\" and The Crucifucks' \"By the Door\" between songs, and GG's banter is as PhD-earning as ever. Here, see:\n\n\"Are there any girls in here that wanna get raped?\"\n\n\"Hey! Does anybody have any cocaine?\"\n\n\"I wanna rape you! Where'd you all go? I can't rape you if you're standing in the fucken back!\"\n\n\"Believe me, it's not fuckin' easy being me.\"\n\n\"I can't go off the stage anymore or we can't play. So what can I do? You know, you guys want us to play, I gotta stay up here. If you want us to get tossed out right now, I'll do that again. I'd like to do that again, but hey fuck man, we travelled about three days to get here so what the fuck. I can still bleed right up here, you know!?\"\n\nThe home-recorded material is stronger overall than the live stuff. In particular, the emotional acoustic Stones-style \"Sitting in This Room,\" feedback-drenched sloth-stink-rocker \"Peanut Butter Picnic,\" and screamy hooky \"Ugly Friends\" will make you forget such in-concert mistakes as Bloody's humiliating spoken word \"Sicko Psycho,\" a half-speed \"Hard Candy Cock\" and the always awful \"Blood for You.\"\n\nBut the best section of all might be the nine minutes of phone conversation snippets that close the record. GG could be a pretty entertaining conversationalist when he wasn't worried about being 'on,' and here he tempts the listener with such minor revelations as:\n\n1. He's a huge Iggy Pop fan, going so far as to call him \"God\"!\n\n2. He dropped out of school in the 10th grade!\n\n3. He once bummed people out at a club by distributing Nazi-themed tschotskes while wearing a jockstrap!\n\n4. He once made sweet love to a woman on the floor at a Black Flag concert!\n\n5. He once interrupted Henry Rollins making sweet love to a woman in order to secure the icon's autograph on his guitar! GG's conclusion: \"Henry's cool. He's kind of an asshole really, but he's cool.\"\n\n6. He drinks a bottle of Southern Comfort before every concert!\n\n7. He's going to visit John Wayne Gacy in prison this Saturday and wants to know if Bloody is still interested in joining him!\n\n8. He has bowel movements onstage and throws them at people!\n\nWhere else in the world are you going to find revelations like these about one of the most important cultural figures of the late 20th century? And don't say \"markprindle.com\" although that's clearly the case, now.\n\nIn conclusion, \"drawer\" spelled backwards is \"reward.\"\n\nAdd your thoughts? Live In Boston 1989 DVD (by GG Allin & the AIDS Brigade) - Music Video Distributors 2010\n\nI love this DVD so much it makes my phantom hair hurt. I'll never forget the day two weeks ago when I toddled home from work with my eyes glazed over, wanting simply to fall asleep on the sidewalk but knowing that I owed it to the world to view Music Video Distributors' latest GG Allin DVD release. I wouldn't say I 'dreaded' it, but I definitely figured I'd have to stop for a nap after 15 minutes or so.\n\nINSTEAD, I SPENT THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF HOURS WITH MY EYEBALLS LITERALLY GLUED TO THE SCREEN, CAUSING SEVERE OCULAR TRAUMA.\n\nThis DVD is jam packed with violence, filth, obscenity, rage, blood, male nudity, feces, urine, transvestitism - and some fangoddamnedtastic rock and punk music. Here's a breakdown of the contents, along with excitable comments on each:\n\n1989 AIDS BRIGADE REHEARSAL - OH SWEET YES YES YES. Following an unplugged \"I Wanna Fuck Myself\" duet by the Allin Brothers, the viewer is thrust into a terrific rehearsal by GG Allin & the AIDS Brigade, featuring tight, tough and astonishingly musical performances of \"Cock on the Loose,\" \"I Wanna Fuck Myself,\" \"Bite It You Scum,\" \"Cunt Sucking Cannibal,\" \"Expose Yourself to Kids\" and \"Gypsy Motherfucker.\" The skinny guitarist looks as white trashy as the rest in his camouflage cap and no shirt, but he's a killer guitarist, adding swampy bottleneck slide to all your favorite trashy documents of hate. If you, like most, tend to write off GG Allin's music as nothing but profane noise, watch this footage to see that only the \"profane\" part is accurate. GG is actually standing at the mic, singing! No nudity, no freak show -- just GG singing his songs!\n\n1989 AIDS BRIGADE MAKE-UP SESSION - OH HELL YES MY GOD YES. Because GG had been banned from every club in Boston, they decided to dress him as a woman to sneak him onstage. But hey, why stop there? As such, the entire band dressed in drag, with wigs, lipstick, blush and women's clothing converting them into four of the most delightful women you'd ever care to date! The biggest treat of this session is getting the chance to see Merle and GG with no facial hair or sunglasses. Yes, you get to see what Merle Allin ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE! And without his gigantic Hitler mustache and face-hiding shades, he looks like a normal guy with long face and deep-set eyes who loves to joke and laugh. GG still comes across as a major misanthrope, but Merle is having a gasser of a time talking like a woman and cracking gags about his brother's feminine mystique (\"There's gonna be lipstick on my dipstick tonight!\"). The guitarist doesn't seem quite as thrilled as the Allins as he stares into the camera and mutters, \"I'm 25 years old.\"\n\n1989 AIDS BRIGADE PERFORMANCE IN BOSTON - OH HELL MY YES AGAIN. Because they're made up as women (in GG's words, \"The prettiest girls in Boston, I'd say!\"), they change the gender references of every song performed, bringing the crowd such female-empowering sentiments as \"Cunt on the Loose,\" \"Expose Yourself to Boys,\" \"Cock Sucking Cannibal\" and \"I Wanna Rape You, You Slimy Cock!\" The guitar is too trebly here, but it's great fun watching the guys dance around in their dresses and high heels, looking every bit the New York Dolls fanatics that they were. GG eventually shows his man wares to the crowd, but that's as far as he goes. This is a rock'n'roll concert!\n\n1993 MURDER JUNKIES PERFORMANCE IN SEATTLE - GOOD GOD UNCLE WIGGILY WOW. The rock'n'roll era is over; bring on the Freak Show! Merle is in his trademark shades and overgrown Hitler mustache, Dino the drummer is as naked as his frontman, and GG is there solely to hurt, frighten and freak people out. By the time the first song begins, he has already removed all his clothes, urinated and defecated onstage, tasted his stool and hurled it into the crowd, ripped up a Bible and set it on fire, wiped his anus with an American fla"
