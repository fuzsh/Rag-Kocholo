        "text": "“I hate you motherfuckers”\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis essay will focus on an American Punk that both enlighted the spirit of rebellion which anarchy would take place in but also brought up a huge cinism: GG Allin who manifested himself as a part of an “image” throughout his body and the “hate” he possessed. GG Allin in The USA was a popular phenomenon with a non-discoursive punk attitute which included speeches of both self-awareness that turned into a cinism and self-reputation by using his own bodily rejections such as urine and feces. “I hate you motherfuckers” began to officialize his state of self-manipulation and he became one -or maybe the first- of the most hated artists of all time. It’s been officially heard from his own speech that the day he met rock’n’roll was a salvation which prevented him from becoming a serial killer. It is no coincidence that he received fan letters from the infamous serial killers whose positions within societies were highly related to the industrialization and idolization of the “other” as the modern day anti-heroes. GG Allin borrowed the same cultural influence by sloganising “legalize murder”. Still a hate against the members of a society would never prepare an enough space for a legitimate homicide in any sense GG Allin believed in. Was it a flashpoint when he started to reflect the anger to himself and the hate to his body?\n\nGG Allin concerts were full of “artistically” self-mutilation that both affected himself and the audience. The throwing of his own feces to the face of an audience simply resulted with a lawsuit which has been lowered as killing rock’n’roll if he ever was sentenced. He simply declared that all his actions were licit as long as he really believed in that. Thus, his lowering continued as avoiding an artist to be put in a political context since “socio” was eliminated by self-oriented, lucid behaviours. That’s why GG Allin should be evaluated as a “body image” through the visual methodology of Panofsky which consists of pre-iconography, iconography and iconology. This method will contextualise the Punk attitutes which turned into a body image rather than a political discoursive commune.\n\nDr. Burak Bayülgen\n\nWHEN JUNKIES LEGALIZE MURDER\n\nPre-Iconography\n\nHated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies (Todd Phillips, 1993) presented GG Allin from the public eye rather than judging his actions. The film stripped GG Allin from the comments which metaphorically covered up his body. Almost the whole film presents GG Allin in performance, naked and uncovered from the accusers. Phillips depanded on fans, long time drinking buddies and audience. The film saved GG Allin’s phenomena for the pre-iconography as if no over-voice has been dubbed onto his career. This leads the way from an undubbed representment to a critically approached “body image” in which GG Allin shall be deduced. This is an approach to see GG Allin through a reasonable eye, yet this structure makes his actions apparent to lead the way to iconology. Phillips’ film focused on representations of his artistic reality while avoiding the apprehensions of his hate against everything that were reflected and cinically submerged. The reflection of GG Allin as a non-discoursive artist will stick to Phillips’ film but the first part of this reading necessitates avoiding an over-voice.\n\nPhillips structured his film from “what he did in front of people” rather than “how he is accepted”. As pre-iconography, GG Allin was nothing more than he artistically thought. Since GG Allin behaved in the name of rock’n’roll, he became a cornerstone that rather changed himself instead of his time and space. He did not offer a salvation but his short life submitted a kind-of-joy for the eyes of his fans, apoliticized from all the rules and regulations.\n\n“hate”, “fuck”, “scum”, “die”, “myself”, “ass”, “cock”, “suck”, “shit”\n\nIconography\n\n“He kept threatening to kill himself, yet he poured every ounce of himself into living his life to the fullest and doing it his way. He was committed to his art. Over the course of his life, he made numerous recordings, overcoming lack of money, lack of consistent collaborators, lack of anything even close to record label support. He recorded output ranges from catchy as hell songs like “I Wanna Fuck Myself” to sinister dirges like “Snakeman’s Dance.” He was unrepentant about everything he did. He was on a mission. And it ended too soon”. (Johnson, Richard, 2015: 5)\n\nAccording to some of his fans, GG Allin was totally an idol that was on a mission. Nevertheless, even Phillips’ film does not determine the motivation of a fanhood and agglomerate a GG Allin fan with a punk music fan. That’s why the iconography should focus on how GG Allin treated himself and his body in terms of “hate”, “rock’n’roll” and “mission”.\n\nThe most significant part of iconography is the assumption of a discourse as an out-of-discourse. In other words, how did GG Allin extinguish the signs of a discourse into none? It requires 2 steps in which his lyrical themes are included.\n\nThe first step is to look at his body as an “image” which has been seen through the eyes of fans. He’s been treated as a fictious character who could be adapted into anything that is “other” than a leading artist. The anthology called Blood For You managed to do that:\n\n“It’s not meant to aggrandize the man of apologize for the shit he did in his life. It’s designed to put this character that had no place in the real world into worlds where he makes sense, and maybe to make sence out of who he was”. (2015: 5)\n\nThe Second Step is to attribute a fantasy that refers to any other arts. The image is so loaded with fantasy that his licit attitutes make sense as if they were fictious. GG Allin’s image is not only the rejection of urine and feces but a rejection and apoliticization of real-time/space. GG Allin’s image becomes fictious if the punk attitute has been drawn out of a political context which brings out toleration and endurance of his stage acts.\n\nIconography’s schematics lead their ways to look at GG Allin in terms of visual methodologies such as artist-artwork-audience relationship in which the audience take part in both iconography and iconology. As Greenberg stated for Pollock paintings, the kitsch was where there was no other explanation beyond the viewing or every viewers would feel the same. Out of his performative characteristics, GG Allin’s visual body was kitsch that could not complete itself to a camp behaviour. He broke his teeth with the microphone, hurt and cut himself with razors, injected microphones and bananas to his anus. He intended to rape his female audiences. He shit and smeared. All these actions were beyond an explanation and were self-mutilations of a body image that was viewed but not interpreted as if reading a newspaper by hearingly repeating the slangs “who cares?” or “suck it then”.\n\nIconography is also related with the context of his music. Since most of his recordings were poorly produced in audio quality, he performed music from punk to spoken word, from rock’n’roll to country. He gave stand-up shows and most of them resulted with brutality. He stood as if he convinced to say something to his audience, but he only burned newspapers which he read and attacked his female audience which resulted with being attacked by her boyfriend. The repetition of words “hate”, “fuck”, “scum”, “die”, “myself”, “ass”, “cock”, “suck”, “shit” in almost all of his songs still make no sense out of slang, self-mutilation and cinism. These songs refer to end his own self rather than ending a society or a commune. Whenever he had a message to convey, it consisted the words “fuck it, suck my cock, die” as a formulation. His disbelief in any authorities applied every outlaw casts to himself and only left a few of them to the audience. His defense against “killing rock’n’roll” prevented him from flapping and as much as he flapped, rock’n’roll survived beyond authorities.\n\n“GG Allin is like a cartoon character – a horrible, obscene cartoon character with a rich history of fucked up behaviour and a messiah complex, not to mention all the cum, shit, self abuse and abuse of others. He’s got an army of obsessive fans that is balanced out by those who hate and deride him”. (2015: 4)\n\nIconology\n\nIconology strips GG Allin from the time/space of a fantasy in which the toleration of a devoted fan took place both artistically and visually. To give him an extra-diagetic life brought him an utopian safety to ensure his extreme actions. That was the moment when punk attitutes made sense in GG Allin’s context. His lyrics made sense unless they were not applied to a fantasy. Then, he became a flashpoint of where and when everything had possibilities like “legalizing murder”. His fans stated that GG was their God, yet, it was still the fantasy which was applied to their self, rather than a consciously focus on politics. Hated did a great work which apoliticized GG Allin from his fans’ discourse. The film did not bring out a determinist basis for becoming a fan who wanted to be apoliticised from the discourses they have been embarked. That was how the audience perceived GG Allin as if as much as they see GG Allin and apoliticize them from a discourse, they see themselves away from the politics of the environment that sorround them and dominantly embarked on them by governments, states and nations.\n\n“As GG Allin stated in the mass media’s populer phenomenia on serial killers, he is a cartoon character to whom mass audiences follow, like and enjoy. He preached violence, but was almost always polite and respectful offstage. In some interviews he was soft spoken and thoughtful, while in others he was clearly putting on a show. He happily invited as many punches as he threw”. (2015: 4)\n\nConclusion\n\nThis essay has evaluated GG Allin as a non-discoursive artist despite his actions meant much for his fans. In order to determine a “non-discoursive” statement, GG Allin has been taken as a “body image” that required perspectives of pre-iconograpy, iconography and iconology. Pre-iconography followed Hated: GG Allin and The Murder Junkies’ structure to present him as the object of an eye without an over-voice. Iconography part took his actions and his lyrical themes to a level of fantasy which staged him to a fantastical view rather than politically acquired. The artist-artwork-audience framework has been given in terms of artist-message-receiver but the body image of GG Allin has only been what it was seen without an interpretation. Finally, iconology stripped GG Allin from all the real time/space to create him in a world of cartoon in which the toleration for his actions took place.\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nBal, Mieke (1996) “Reading Art?” In Generations and Geographies in the Visual Arts: Feminist Readings, G.

I can’t say that I’m sure everything is 100% right and complete because a lot is coming from “legends” and stories. I just took vinyl or CD releases in this report because with demo tapes I would write for as long as I live on this report-and don’t forget that English is not my native language so I can’t exactly say in English what I mean in German. But who cares? Here we go!\n\nA Few Words About\n\nthe East-German Hardcore Scene\n\nBy Sebastian Haufe of BWF\n\nDiscordia fanzine volume 1 – 1998\n\nAt this time, the active scene in East-Germany (the area of the former G.D.R.) can be subdivided into just a few centers which have all created their own cosmos-like certainly everywhere in this world. First, a survey over bigger scenes which I do not describe in detail because of our poor knowledge about these scenes.\n\nMain centers are Berlin (which took a special development because of their status as a real big city and the capital of Germany-also their divided development as a “West and East part” is important) because I just know the “bigger names” in the Berlin HC business which I will not tell anything about (’cause I think it wouldn’t be fair to the rest of the scene-the roots which make it all possible). Then there is Leipzig where the scene took a cool and correct development because of good locations and a lot of involved people. Smaller scenes which are mainly the interface of all “different’/ alternative/ underground styles of music (“United We Win” -you know) developed around smaller locations and, for instance, around Chemnitz, Nunchritz, Rosswein or Bischofswerda. But now some areas which surely own an active scene, but I just know some of the bands from there. A short survey:\n\nNorthern East-Germany is where the seaport Rostock is situated, which has a lot of great bands like DRITTE WAHL. Although they are surely the leading ship of the East-German punk, their acceptance in the HC scene is good because of good and intelligent releases and live gigs. After the success of DRITTE WAHL came the bands CRUSHING CASPARS (HC-metal like PRO-PAIN) and GRINDMACHINE (TYPE O NEGATIVE style) under the care of the DRITTE WAHL management to a bigger circle of fans.\n\nWe also haven’t told about the scene around Halle and Dessau, which has Halb7 Rec., an active record label in the punk/oi! genre with TIN-PAN-ALLEY (now VIU DRAKH), and old-established , band which is well known because of a lot of touring and some releases-their sound unfortunately changed from HC to a musty metal sound.\n\nNot far from Leipzig is Chemnitz situated south which has a club called Talschock which has been hosting a lot of gigs for a long time and that’s why it had a lot of influence on the development of the scene in and around the town. If there is a band from overseas or Scandinavia in Germany to do a tour, Chemnitz is surely on the tourplan. Well known bands are OUTLINE (new school, split 7″ with DAWN OF ALL AGES) and LOUSY which hit the nail on its head.\n\nIf you’re going into the western direction, you’ll find Jena which had DRUCKKAMMER (R.I.P.) a band which you could call an EARTH CRISIS with German Lyrics. Unfortunately, they split up after releasing a CD.\n\nA striking fact is that more big cities, for instance Dresden, don’t have an active scene in the HC movement because of the lack of locations where “real” HC bands can play-all bands which came from Dresden were called HC and were an insult to the word. But a few active people are doing HC shows in Dresden; mostly the Conni 18 (hello Ralph!) which always presents interesting bands and gives young bands the possibility to present themselves to the crowd. Also, there are 2-3 clubs which do HC gigs, but they just take the more well-known bands into their program.\n\nLet’s start now with some history. The band most legends exist about came from Leipzig and are unfortunately no longer active: DMB. Because of the reunion of the two German states in the year of 1989 and the following “new orientation” development of a musical underground movement, it took some time before people started to create their own music. That’s why the first vinyl releases of an active scene are dated from the years after 1990. In the year of 1992 the DMB 7″ is released which gives us excellent HC-style with English lyrics. The songs were recorded in a studio in the western part of Germany and released by a West German label (X-Mist Records) too because at that time there were just a few underground record labels active in the east and the bands did not have enough money to release expensive DIY products. DMB became a legend, as they were the first East German band that toured wrth an American band (SFA from . NY). Unfortunately, DMB split up because of internal problems and tried their luck in different bands-most well known are UP IN ARMS in which the former DMB guitarist plays. UP IN ARMS released a 7″ on the Czech label, Day After Rec. and an LP on Halb7 rec. too, but their releases never reached the great quality of their live performance. But already before 1992 there was life signs of the scene around Leipzig, for instance, CHRIST WEEPS BACKWARDS or THE ART OF THE LEGENDARY TISHVAISINGS who released a 7″ and a CD, but they were not “pure” hardcore-so I don’t discuss them. But one I do notice: From C.C.B., T.A.O.T.L.T. and DOD, a band called THINK ABOUT MUTATION was formed which is now one of the most selling East German indie rock bands (mix of techno and metal).\n\nThe year of 1993 gave the scene a new highlight: BBC released their demo tape Under the Milkyway Tonight, which is now available as a 7″ (Day After Rec.). The best description is an “East German SHEER TERROR“. Here you see the strong connection of the scene from Leipzig to NY-HC, although BBC has Abo Alsleben who is one of the most active guys from Zoro, which is now completely finished with NY-HC. Now they give a noisecore band the possibility to play a show rather than a HC band. Times are changing…\n\nLater BBC changed their American sound and are now doing confounded HC with only German lyrics on their CD. Unfortunately, the whole scene from Leipzig didn’t change their tough-imaged NY-HC, that’s why the now active bands FULL SPEED AHEAD (cool NY-style 7″ on Minefield Rec), NORTH SHORE (old school, like GORILLA BISCUITS-7″ on Minefield Rec.) or D.H. (R.I.P. -7″ released) are strongly influenced by the American originals. Through the massive support of the Liepzig scene and around the location Conni Island, the bands quickly built up a good name. We made some noise there too; they are really sympathetic guys. As a sample of the activities by the bands from Leipzig, you can hear them on a CD sampler released on Minefield Rec. which present all of the previously mentioned bands and songs from DENIED REALITY (new school) and S.F.O.C. (musty HC-metal).\n\nAnother important band from the East German scene released a split LP with FOR AGE, and they are STAND AS ONE. While STAND AS ONE have been energetic throughout the years and released a split 7″ with MURDERED ART from Berlin (Mad Mob Rec), I don’t know anything about any other FOR AGE release. STAND AS ONE give you powerful old school HC which is played perfectly and really kicks ass!\n\nAround 1992 or 1993 is when the 7″ from USE YOUR STRENGTH from Bautzen was released. This especially has a very personal meaning because, for me, it was the first 7″ on which HC was combined with clear political and social statements. Clear refusal of animal experiences and the enthusiasm for vegetarianism/ veganism in such a way was never seen in the East German scene before. Just the 7″ title Destroy the Myth of Animal Experiences shows the evidence/task of this band. Already in this time, USE YOUR STRENGTH dissed the whole “tough guys from NY” attitude-really cool. USE YOUR STRENGTH remained U.Y.S. and developed their style into intelligent, paincore and released an LP called Zodiac (Maximum Voice Prod.) in 1994-unfortunately, this record is surely out of press.\n\nBetween the “big cities” Dresden and Bautzen is situated a small town called Bischofswerda which is really interesting because of their bands. On the basis of the old-established location East Club, which is the interface of all scenes of this town, the climate in the town for the development of the scene is right. LEPRA made the first try in releasing vinyl with their What’s the Disease 7″ (Summertime Rec.) in 1994. PARANOISES, the oldest band in town, tried the next step with their MCD Noise of Silence (Summertime Rec.) in 1996. Although they are not satisfied with the soundmix, the MCD contains 5 powerful punk/crossover songs with characteristic vocals. The latest releases of the Bischofswerda posse were BWF with their split 7″ with AGATHOCLES from Belgium and a CD in 1998. Although most people think there is a grindcore band behind the three letters, we call our style a “hard rockin’ bastard” (because I’m a member of this band I don’t know what to tell you-see review in this ‘zine). And, there’s a new interesting band coming from my town-the youngest and sweetest child of our scene: POOR LITTLE MITE, which play emotional “pop-core”.\n\nAnother active pole developed over the ..years around Riesa/GroBenhain around the club Kombi. Proof of this energetic band is given to you by the 7″ from the HOLY PIGS which split up a few weeks ago (R.I.P.). They worked with two singers, but because of the bad production, the 7″ didn’t show the qualities of this band Contrary to HOLY PIGS, POURING PITCH are still active and present a CD which I haven’t heard yet, sorry. ‘ However, some qualified people have told me that POURING PITCH now go in the D.R.I. direction-old school strikes back!\n\nNormally I could write down more, and more, and more… but for a survey, these lines are more than enough. In the beginning, I didn’t think that this report could become like a “thesis”. If there are any questions or you are interested in one of the mentioned releases, please write me and I’ll send you the concerned addresses.\n\nWhat do you know about the Czech Republic? Probably not too much, so here are few geopolitical facts: it is situated in the middle of Europe, with 10 million inhabitants; it originated in 1993 (before, it was part of Czechoslovakia, which split into 2 separate states). There is 1 city with a population over 1 million (Prague), and a few cities with a population of several hundred thousand people (Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň)…). From 1948 ’til 1989, the nation lived under the iron fist of a socalled “Communist” regime that turned the state into one big concentration camp. After some years of a rightwing “economy at any cost” government recently came an equally arrogant social democratic (left) government. The country is currently suffering a recession caused in part by widespread corruption in government and business. Enough for a beginning? I hope so.\n\nFilip / Insane Society Recs. 1999\n\nAlthough there were some alternative activities before 1989 as well, they were only marginal and weak, because of the ruling regime’s repression. From November 1989 onwards, we can speak of the rise of anarchist, ecological, animalrights and similar movements and of course also of hardcore and punk music.\n\nThe anarchist movement’s activities began mainly in Prague, but they slowly reached other towns as well. C.A.S. (the Czech Anarchist Association), which was formed shortly before the November “revolution”, has organised several demonstrations in Prague, mostly against racism (after 1989, there was a boom of the naziskinheads movement over here), but also against the National Exposition, which cost a lot of money and was surrounded with financial machinations. Some of these demonstrations led to violent conflicts with Nazis and the police, who were of course on their side. The Nazi skinheads started to be a real threat directly after 1989; their popularity was constantly rising; in line with the nation’s general hidden racism and intolerant mentality (especially against the biggest ethnic minority here Gypsies). Also, the most popular skinhead band, “Orlik”, hit the music charts and they easily managed to sell more than 100.000 records. Lately they were replaced by more outspoken and more “hardcore” types of nazi bands, who weren’t so wellknown, but still had an influence on young Nazis. In spring ’90, there was a flood of racist attacks on Gypsies, blacks, etc., in Prague and in the northwestern part of the country. These were the first victims of the new Czech fascism, and the number of such attacks is higher every year. Anarchists were the first ones who took a stand against Nazis, back in these times, when police, the media, and politicians absolutely ignored the problem. It took them 7 years and more than 25 murders to make them realise it and do something about it (the turning point was the murder of a Sudanese student in Prague in autumn ’97, though the passivity of the police towards Nazis’ actions is still relatively high in some areas).\n\nBack at the beginning of the 90’s, the anarchist movement was based mostly around the magazine A-KONTRA, which was issued more or less regularly, with a print run of several thousand copies, and was distributed throughout the country. It stopped publishing after several disputes in the editorial collective in ’95, but there are now some hopes of resurrecting it. A-KONTRA faced several state repressions and one of their editors was even charged for attempted murder of the leader of the Czech Communist Party the police lied that he had confessed to it, but later he was found innocent and the police had to apologize to him and to pay damages. AUTONOMIE was another magazine, founded in’93, and later the people around it formed the A.F. (Anarchist Federation), which had several branches, but didn’t last very long. AUTONOMIE stopped publishing in 96.\n\nIn 1995, the C.S.A.F. (CzechSlovak Anarchist Federation) was founded, and began publishing SVOBODNA MYSL (“Free Mind”) magazine. After a dispute in ’97, the C.S.A.F. continued under this name, but some of the former members left it and formed the Federation Of Social Anarchists (F.S.A.), with their own magazine called SVOBODNA PRACE (“Free Labour”). SVOBODNA MYSL changed its name to EXISTENCE, which is now the new magazine of C.S.A.F. The reason for the dispute was the typical conflict in anarchist movements everywhere the conflict between the “true anarchist”, promoting class war and anarchosyndicalist approach, here represented by F.S.A., versus the approach of the more “autonomous” anarchists, less ideological, more open to other alternative movements (mostly squatting and ecological activities), represented by C.S.A.F. Both organisations are based in Prague, but they have several branches around the country. Besides publishing their quarterly magazines, they organise different actions and demonstrations F.S.A., who is a member of the International Workers Association, has organized demonstrations against unemployment and syndicalist propagation work among workers, while C.S.A.F. has set up solidarity demos/street theatres for the Zapatistas, and antifascist demonstrations and has participated in some squatting activities.\n\nKONFONTACE is a new magazine in newspaper format published by former editors of AUTONOMIE. It comes out every 2 months and manages to get the attention of “normal” people outside the anarchist ghetto. It’s quite radical and in it you can find wellwritten articles on police repression, the media, elections, etc.\n\nBesides C.S.A.F. and F.S.A., there is another active anarchist group, called AKTIVITA CABARET VOLTAIRE, an informal anarchopunk group, based in the northwestern part of the Republic. They publish ‘zines, do distribution, organise and participate in different actions, and do a lot of support activities for the anarchist movement (such as money collections, etc.). You can get more precise information on all of these anarchist organisations directly from them contact information is at the end of this scene report.\n\nSquatting:\n\nAlthough the first squatting attempts took place already at the very beginning of the 90’s, the first relatively longterm and successful squat started in March 1992 the SOCHORKA squat in Prague on pplk. Sochora street 28. It was a typical apartment house, squatted by the anarchists around A-KONTRA magazine.\n\nDespite an attack of cca 150 Nazi skinheads in December ’92 and a subsequent police eviction, it was resquatted shortly after eviction and managed to exist until September 97. The inhabitants left it after an agreement with the local council that they will get a new place for their activities (they got the new place in the end, but it’s in very bad condition now; there are plans to do something like a “Free University” there). The SOCHORKA squat was the centre of anarchist activities for a long time; it was the home of the A-KONTRA editorial staff and printing press and also contained a small gig place in the basement.\n\nLADRONKA: the most famous Czech squat last year it celebrated 5 years of existence. This old fortress from the 17th century, situated in the Prague suburbs, was squatted in August ’93 by people related to AUTONOMIE. LADRONKA faced eviction several times, but after massive protests and demonstrations, the city gave up the idea of selling it to real estate speculators, and now there haven’t been any eviction threats for a long time. The squat has hosted a large number of gigs, exhibitions, rave parties etc. and is a very important place for the Czech autonomous movement. The adress is Tomanova street 1, in the Brevnov quarter, and the building is situated in the middle of a park. Some of the recent gigs included Varukers, Detestation, Cripple Bastards, Hellkrusher etc.\n\nSquatting is not very widespread over here, particularly because of the very tough sentences that you can face if you try it (a large fine or up to 2 years of imprisonment), but also because there doesn’t seem to be enough active people willing to gather together to do it, with the exception of the bigger cities. In summer ’97 a group of people in Prague squatted a new house ZENKLOVKA on Zenklova street. They made agreements with the owner that they could use it until its demolition, but after pressure from the police (their antiextremist branch), the owner changed his mind and agreed to let the police to evict the squatters. After some nonviolent resistance (ocupation of the roof), the squat was evicted in the beginning of ’98. The same group of people later found a new building, and so on May 1st ’98 the MILADA squat was founded, in the Holesovice quarter near a railway station and student campuses. It’s old villa, scheduled for demolition. Squatters have made some minor repairs and opened the bar. There were several police and security agency attempts to evict them in October (again, after their agreement with the owner, police pressured him, convincing him that they found hard drugs in the squat). When the same nonviolent tactic was used to defend the house, the cops finally gave up, and MILADA is still going strong. You can get more information about its current situation from the C.S.A.F. contact adress. There was a squat in Brno from August ’til November ’97, when the house was violently attacked by police. Squatters were beaten down and had guns pulled on them, and in the end cops locked them all in one room and then threw a tear gas projectile inside. Meanwhile, they managed to destroy/steal most of the furnishings. The second day, the squat was definitively evicted.\n\nThere are several other places in Prague for punk and alternative activities the PROPAST punk pub (Lipanska 3, quarter Zizkov) there is also small record shop near from here BASS RIOT STORE (Chvalova 8), the UTOPIE autonomous cafe (Wenzigova/Lublanska street corner, Nove Mesto quarter) and the 007 CLUB (Strahov Hill, among the university campuses). There used to be a socialcultural centre called BLACK HAND, which was quite wellknown worldwide, but from the beginning of its existence in ’93, it had lot of problems with the local authorities, and it never attracted the wider attention of the people. The centre closed down in ’97 and later was demolished, there’s now a very nice concreteparking lot in its place…\n\nAnimal rights and ecological activities, over here are mostly official and mainstreamoriented they aren’t very radical at all. They do some useful activities, but most of them have clearly distanced themself from any autonomous or anarchist activities, because they fear for their public reputation. They have chosen instead to cooperate with politicians; they give advice on which party to vote for in the elections, and so on. Summer blockades of the construction site for the Temelin nuclear power plant were one of the few examples of good cooperation between anarchists and ecological activists. These went for several years, but have now stopped. The general “step backwards” in the strategy of these organisations has also something to do with the policy of their funding most of their income comes from foundations established by the European Union or other official sources, who don’t like to see very radical activities. You can find more honest and more “grassroots” groups; the problem is that they are too small and they lack finacial resources. In the animal rights field, the most active are probably SVOBODA ZVIRAT (“Freedom for Animals”) and ANIMAL S.O.S., who both organise info stands, demonstrations, petitions, exhibitions, etc. against several forms of animal abuse. Brno is home to NESEHNUTI (“The Unmoved”, more officially the “Independent Social Ecological Movement”), which works in the human and animal rights fields, and is also active against a planned motorway, which will spoil an important recreation area in Brno. The Czech chapter of EARTH FIRST! was established some months ago in Prague. They put out an Action Update newsletter and also plan to have an internet site. There are some other smaller groups working on these issues spread all across the country, often working on local problems.\n\nLast year saw 2 street parties, which were among to the Czech autonomous movement’s biggest actions ever. The GLOBAL STREET PARTY took place 16.5.98 in Prague, organised by EARTH FIRST!, C.S.A.F., and other groups as a protest against world globalisation and against the city’s unsustainable traffic situation it is plagued by cars and pollution. The action was attented by cca 3.000 people and started peacefully, until the demonstration went onto Prague’s most important traffic artery and blocked it. Cops tried to stop the demonstration, but they were fought back and had to escape. A cop car was turned over, and some other were smashed with bricks. Then part of the march headed to the city centre, where the McDonalds’ and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked, causing big damage to their property. The police, who at first weren’t able to handle the situation at all and let the people riot, then arrived in big numbers and went absolutely mad. They beat up lot of people, including innocent passersby. In their obvious “nobrain style”, they couldn’t pick up the actual rioters, but arrested mostly those demonstrators who didn’t manage to escape. The arrested people went through several punishments and beatings and were thrown to jail for about 2 weeks, but in the end they were released, because the cops couldn’t charge them with anything. The GLOBAL STREET PARTY made headlines in the mass media for many days and caused public discussions about globalisation, police brutality, the problems of young people, etc. Also, a special antidemonstration police squad was formed.\n\nA LOCAL STREET PARTY was organised 3 months later,-this time with cca 4.000 participants. It started in a park, with a rave party, info booths with alternative press materials, etc., and the march was shorter this time, with a route avoiding the possible conflict points, such as the abovementioned restaurants. It must be said that this time police showed up in all force, with thousand of cops readied and several dozen plainclothes cops among the demonstraters themselves, some of them dressed as punx. These “masked” cops tried to provoke some action that would give a reason to attack, but they weren’t successful. The demonstration went OK, without large conflicts, the only exception being the march of cca 100 people on a McDonalds’ restaurant after the official end of the demonstration finally the plainclothes pigs managed to provoke a few confused punx who were immediately arrested after their first attempt to break the police line. If you are interested in seeing pictures from both parties, check out the lidskaprava.cz site on the internet.\n\nNo need to say that no action was taken against the cops who beat up and humimilated the people after the GLOBAL STREET PARTY. Police brutality against anarchists and punx is already something common over here, after several wellknown cases such as the beatings of protestors against the Velka Pardubicka Steeplechase in ’92, the raid on the Propast punk pub in ’96, and the attack on the demonstration against police brutality in ’97 (which, ironically, was supposed to commemorate the Propast raid). The “antiextremist branch” of the Czech police is investigating not only the anarchist and autonomous movement, but also the official ecological organisations like GREENPEACE, which led to an international scandal a few years back. Cops and nazis are surely the biggest threat to punx like everywhere. As a reaction on widespread naziskinheads movement, the Czech version of Antifascist Action ANTIFASISTICKA AKCE (A.F.A.) was formed some time ago, they do newsletter called “Akce” (previously “Antifa News”), but otherwise aren’t very active.\n\nHardcore Punk Scene:\n\nOK, OK, so now definitely something about the music. Now, at the beginning of 1999, there is really a good and strong hardcore/punk scene, but first let’s look a bit into the history of the Czech punk/HC scene. The first punk bands started over here in the beginning of the 80’s (A 64, ENERGIE G, ZIKKURAT, etc.) and slowly the scene started to grow. During the 80’s and especially at the end of 80’s, when the opression by the regime wasn’t as strong as before, there were more and more punk bands, such as F.P.B., VISACÍ ZÁMEK, PLEXIS, H.N.F., Z.N.C. etc. and later also first hardcore bands (TELEX, P.S., SUCIDAL COMMANDO, S.R.K., MICHAEL’S UNCLE, KRITICKA SITUACE, etc.). In these times, punk was in the deep underground, gigs were illegal, bands had problems with the authorities and it was absolutely impossible to release a record (the first official Czech punk record was a 7″ by VISACÍ ZÁMEK in ’88!). Punx always used to have problems with cops, in school and at work, because of their appearance. Some of them were sentenced for “crimes” such as “having a negative stance towards socialist system” or even “propagation of fascism”, etc. Society and especially the media looked on punk as a tool of Western imperialism, smuggled into our country to spoil the young people. Since 1989, all this has changed, and punk has reached a wider range of young people, official media, and record labels, and these old bands have started to release their first records (mostly on new commercial labels, but there was hardly anyone thinking about that back in 1990 here). Luckily, some new and fresh DIY labels, zines, bands, gigs, etc. also emerged soon, and the scene became more political and DIYoriented. Thanx to people like KRITICKA SITUACE singer Robert, Martin (MALARIE RECORDS) or Bergamo (and his Black Hand agency), the foreign punk/HC bands (Nausea, Murphys Law, Inferno, Chaos U.K., No Means No, Concrete Sox, Gorilla Biscuits etc. in the first years, and then tons more) started playing gigs here, and a relatively strong and independent scene was built.\n\nSo, who is who in current Czech HC/ Punk?\n\nLet’s start with grindcore, which recently is quite popular over here. The trio MALIGNANT TUMOUR is playing a mix of grind/mincecore in the vein of Agathocles and Regurgitate, now with political lyrics. They have about 5 split EP’s and one split CD + tons of tapes out and have also played on festivals in Belgium and Germany. Future plans include a full CD and some more split EP’s. From the same city (Ostrava) as M.T. come CEREBRAL TURBULENCY (they have progressed from death metal to pure grindcore), P.T.A.O. (exSOCIAL DEFORMITY, heavy megabassed grind/noise, a split EP with Japanese Final Exit is out) and PURULENT SPERMCANAL (gore grind in the vein of Gut/Impetigo). It seems that this town is the capital of grind! Other grinders TWISTED TRUTH, influenced by old N.D., who just recently released a split EP with ROT on Fudgeworthy Records and plan 2 more split EP’s with MALIGNANT TUMOUR and WARSORE. INGROWING (exPLASTIC GRAVE, who released a split 7″ with Agathocles), one of the most popular bands in death metal/grind territory, have a split CD and a split EP out, some new releases out soon. NEGLIGENT COLLATERAL COLLAPSE do weird grind/industrial mixes, sometimes with the help of a computer, some tapes out, their drummer did a Czech grind core encyclopedia on the internet! GRIDE, from the southwestern part of the Czech Republic, do a killer mix of extreme hardcore and grind with great sociopolitical lyrics, they call their music “power gride core” and so far have done 1 split EP w/LIES AND DISTRUST and a split LP with M.B.. They have also played some gigs abroad. Besides the split EP, GRIDE also share a drummer with LIES & DISTRUST, who play classical scandiinfluenced crust core with growling vocals. L&D also plan a split EP (w/ EXEKUCE) and a split LP in Brazil later in ’99. Two other cool crust bands are located near the Polish border HOW LONG? (a split EP out, another planned) and R.A.F., both play dual voc crust butchery, R.A.F.even include a trumpet! This area is also home to HIBAKUSHA, DISNEY and ZRADCE RASY, all playing the crusty shit too. Another raw crustpunx EXEKUCE (based around the “Propast” punk pub) are one of the few bands currently playing in our capital Prague, with a split EP due out sooner or later. Brno is home to MRTVA BUDOUCNOST, fastasfuck dualvoc extreme core with 3 split EP’s. They have a split LP w/LEFT IN RUINS (on Six Weeks Rec.) and another one w/GRIDE (collaboration of Insane Society, View Beyond and other labels), future plans include an 8″ flexi in the U.S. and huge pile of compilations. M.B. did some touring abroad too. Also continuing the tradition of the extreme HC style (Hellnation fans take note!) are PANGS OF REMORSE from the Western part of the country, they did a split EP and a German tour with M.B. back in’96, but haven’t been very active since this time. Some new vinyl (probably with S.O.K. a mix of thrash/grind/HC + whatever… with 100% crazy lyrics) may come out sooner or later. Crust/grind/extreme HC is already wellestablished here with most bands of this style already going strong for long years. One of the brandnew additions to the family are MINDLOCK, producing some cruel sounds in the Sore Throat vein.\n\n…\n\nOriginal Source:\n\n> CZECH SCENE REPORT.PDF"
