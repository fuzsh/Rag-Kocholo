        "text": "GG Allin & the Scumfucs / Artless split LP\n\nYup, a match made in… Anyway, Mykel Board’s ARTLESS material is the same as what appears on the recent Placebo Records one-sided 12″, while I don’t know nor care if G.G.’s stuff was previously released. This label wants to license more US bands for European release.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Holy War / Starving Missile\n\nIssue MRR #34 • March 1986\n\nGG Allin & the Scumfucs You’ll Never Tame Me cassette\n\nGG will never change. Rockin’ early punk-style garage numbers and every combination of obscenity and sexual depravity. We decided a woman should review GG to see if he really is offensive, and I think that if you are offended with such absurdities as “I Wanna Fuck Myself” (“cause I’m the best”) or “Needle Up My Cock” or “Kill the Children, Save the Food” and don’t see the obvious ridiculous satire, you’re just as sexually repressed as GG. If you like to hear strings of cuss words for 45 minutes, find this tape.\n\nReviewer Ruth Schwartz\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #28 • September 1985\n\nGG Allin & the Scumfucs I Wanna Fuck Your Brains Out EP\n\nWell, GG has once again risen to a new low… “I Wanna Fuck Your Brains Out”? “I’m Gonna Rape You”? I dunno, he might be able to get away with that shit if there was any streak of humor in there but instead there’s a really nasty streak of misogyny here. I’m not sure which is more disgusting, the songs or the pictures of ALLIN masturbating and shooting up. It’s not even intelligent enough to offend. Just pitiful.\n\nReviewer Dogtowne\n\nLabel Blood\n\nIssue MRR #25 • May/June 1985\n\nGG Allin & the Scumfucs I Wanna Fuck Your Brains Out cassette\n\nDo you think that if I give this a bad review, G.G. ALLIN will stop sending me something new to review every issue? Probably not, but it’s worth a try. Here goes: The only thing smaller than this guy’s brain is his dick, which he tries to overcompensate for by writing pathetic songs (four of ’em here) of sexual degeneration. Wishes he were IGGY, but his ego’s too big to accept such “small-time” status. Okay, G.G., send the next one…\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel self-released\n\nIssue MRR #23 • March 1985\n\nGG Allin & the Scumfucs Eat My Fuc 12″\n\nLike it or not, GG represents the authentic spirit of “rock ’n’ roll.” After half a dozen 7″ers and an album, you’d expect him to mellow out, but he’s more primitive and disgusting than ever. I mean, the production on this garage release is almost as distorted as GG’s values! With a homemade drawing of an ejaculating member on the cover and reflective song titles like “Fuckin’ the Dog,” “Clit Licker,” “Drink, Fight, and Fuck,” and “Cock on the Loose,” this would make a perfect gift for Sunday School teachers all across America.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Blood\n\nIssue MRR #14 • June 1984\n\nArtless / GG Allin & the Scumfucs split EP\n\nA suitable mixture of retardation, one natural (G.G.), one contrived (ARTLESS). G.G.’s SCUMFUCS belt out a couple of sleazily recorded garage guitar classics like “Drink, Fight, and Fuc.” Mykel Board’s ART and ARTLESS perform some fast, tightly wound punk with a sarcastic Republican/Reaganoid stance. If anyone takes either of these “shocking” characters too seriously, they must be “dense-packed.”\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Schrott\n\nIssue MRR #10 • December 1983\n\nGG Allin & the Scumfucs Hard Candy Cock EP\n\nGG apparently has a new band this time around, and I can’t say I’m particularly crazy about them. Instead of his earlier ’60s garage punk sound, he now has more of a late ’60s metal sound, solos and all. Idiotic and poorly recorded.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Blood\n\nIssue MRR #8 • September 1983"
