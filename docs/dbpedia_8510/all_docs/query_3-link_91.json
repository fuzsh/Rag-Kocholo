One of those photos became the cover for Xiu Xiu's excellent A Promise album. But, for this trip to happen in the first place, Jamie needed to raise some money. For 8 months before they left, they recorded as many punk and ska bands as they could (One of the bands was Short Round). This isn't the only time that Jamie has intersected with ska. Another band they recorded, Firme, lent them their horn section for the Knife Play record. One of their old 90s bands, IBOPA (Indestructible Beat Of Palo Alto), played with a lot of ska bands since they were a fun horn-driven band (Ska was an influence, but not a style they played). Another one of their bands, Ten In The Swear Jar, released a record on Asian Man Records, and Pitchfork made a point to talk about ska in the review, despite there being NO ska on the album.We talk about all of this with Jamie, and so much more. We discuss the time period when they worked at Streetlight Records, how they discovered ska and reggae on KPFK on Sundays, how their 2nd concert ever was Pato Banton and Tippa Irie, and how they briefly played bass in a dub band. They also tell us about the time GG Allin jumped on stage and demanded they \"plays some blues.\" They tell us stories about The Cactus Club. They tell us why Deerhoof is an amazing band. We learn who Richard Snakedick is. We discuss what it was like to perform a balloon solo as the opening act on AJJ's 2021 tour, and we find out why they once blurted out \"Fred Flintstone's Lucius Dick.\" Plus, Jamie sings for us a Weird Al-style parody song they wrote when they were a teenager. Just imagine The Grand Illusion by Styx, but it's The Grand Fart!

It's not the “nasty women” nasty, it's the poop on the stage, spit on your fans kind of nasty. While his music was mostly forgettable, his cult-like legacy in the punk rock world continues to live on.
