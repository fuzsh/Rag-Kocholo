        "text": "GG Allin Dirty Love Songs 2xLP\n\nJust in case you don’t have enough GG ALLIN records, this release will solve your problems. OK, this package contains no songs playable on the radio, ten songs with “fuck” in the title, three with “cock,” five with “piss” or “shit,” etc. Live and studio, usually good sound quality.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Fan Club\n\nIssue MRR #56 • January 1988\n\nGG Allin Hated in the Nation cassette\n\nHere is GG ALLIN with 45 minutes of raw, intense debauchery. Some may call him sexist, violent, or stupid, but some of these tunes are catchy! Not for the easily offended or “politically correct.”\n\nReviewer Walter Glaser\n\nLabel ROIR\n\nIssue MRR #49 • June 1987\n\nGG Allin Biggest Tits 1980-1983 EP\n\nShitty adolescent cover, great shitty rough production, and this six song “best of” 7″ is probably already rare. If you can’t get it — don’t sweat it — he’s got a tape coming out on ROIR as well as a full LP on Homestead soon. Jesus…\n\nReviewer Dogtowne\n\nLabel Black & Blue\n\nIssue MRR #48 • May 1987\n\nGG Allin Tasteless Animal Noise cassette\n\nOld G.G. doesn’t give up, but then why should he? This unclear live recording doesn’t quite pack the punch of his studio offerings, but it does feature some imbecilic between-song raps by way of compensation. You’d probably have to see G.G. in person to get the full effect of his tastelessness.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Orange\n\nIssue MRR #6 • May/June 1983\n\nGG Allin No Rules EP\n\nHey, this is even better than G.G.’s usual garage punk offerings, being faster, tighter, and minus sexism. Amazing! The background choruses turn “No Rules” into a classic, but this guy still serves as a constant reminder of how absurd people can be. That’s a recommendation.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Orange\n\nIssue MRR #5 • March/April 1983\n\nGG Allin You Hate Me and I Hate You 7″\n\nThe undisputed king of New Hampshire raunch rock returns with yet another trashy garage offering. G.G. may be predictable in his excesses, but when the results are this loud and absurd, it’s OK with me. This type of bone-crunching guitar-heavy stuff is as American as mouldy apple pie, but don’t expect the Reaganoids to invite G.G. to perform at the White House.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Orange\n\nIssue MRR #2 • September/October 1982"
