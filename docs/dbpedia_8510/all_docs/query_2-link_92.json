        "text": "Disappointments were a punk/hardcore band from Muskegon, Michigan, USA, where some members also played as a touring band for GG Allin and the band itself also collaborated with the artist for the Outside Inside EP in 1989. GG is best remembered for his notorious live performances in the 80's and 90's that typically featured wildly transgressive acts such as defecating onstage, committing self harm, and a variety of violent actions towards the audience and even animals. GG died in 1993 of an heroin overdose, before pledging that he would commit suicide on stage as a work of art.\n\n[]\n\nPeel mentioned on his 19 January 1988 show that he got a hold of the Disappointments record when he read a review of their 7\" on a Maximumrocknroll music fanzine and asked their record label to send him a copy, which they did and started playing tracks from it in that year.\n\nShows Played[]\n\nThis database is incomplete and is compiled from these website.
