        "text": "Although the blatant misogyny is on full display throughout that first LP, the full onslaught of antisocial behavior and violence was years away. That short period in the late '70s is the only time GG Allin's vocals could be described as \"tuneful\":\n\nThis is a great point, and you've very successfully said what I meant but couldn't articulate, when I vaguely said that GG \"messed it up.\" His position comes from completely misunderstanding the source material, ie rock music, not grasping the distinction of rebellious vs dangerous, and that is very much where GG goes off the rails for me, and where he is indeed, quite extremely wrong about almost everything, whenever he comes up in conversations like this thread.\n\nLittle Richard and the ideas of Little Richard, in his prime, were dangerous to the establishment forces of the times (racism, sexuality/gender roles, questioning of authority, law enforcement, censorship, clothing, etc.). But only dangerous because they were rebellious, and only because deep down at the core Richard was basically and essentially right about so much of the stuff in his own times that he was stirring up a wild rebellion against. Which to me is the crucial part of it that GG seems to have never got, or understood, or even come close to grokking. Great post.\n\nI believe dangerous is the correct term to use. Dangerous being the opposite of safe. When rock n roll becomes too safe and sanitized, it loses its essence. Rebelliousness has its merits in rock as well, but the other side of that dime is obedience. I don't believe anyone has described rock as being too obedient when referring to its moralistic decay. Too safe is a term I hear all the time, and thus the element of danger is what is missing.\n\nThere was no law banning mosh pits when they started to appear, but the very act of joining one was a dangerous pursuit, rather than a rebellious one. The mosh pits I see now are fairly tame in comparison.\n\nDanger is a vital element to rock n roll.\n\nI alerted one of The Jabbers to this thread and here was his response\n\n\"It is hard to defend any post 1984 GG. The music went right the hell downhill and never, ever, came back up with any sort of integrity. Unfortunately, as pointed out constantly, it is the only GG people really know as it gets all the attention.\"\n\nWhat did he mean by \"dangerous?\"\n\nI think even a broken clock can be right twice a day. What is \"dangerous\"? In art, it's anything you want it to be. In a field of brashness and swagger and making parents nervous, of course it should be \"dangerous\". Incite your daughter to lascivious movements; put your complacent relationship into jeaopardy with risky opportunity; use your inner fire to whip your head around, and lash out at the hand that feeds you! Sure!\n\nEverything about rock that threatens the mundane, is the reason it exists. Everything about the attitude that lures the young to throw off its' chains of the banal life they are following, is what excites them about it. You don't need GG Allin to tell you that!\n\nIt's all Panties, Percosets, and The Pompatus of Love, baby!\n\nIt's a sad story really, he got dosed with a large amounts of LSD by someone he trusted.\n\nThat dude should be ashamed of himself. He may have been a wing nut to start with, but\n\ndosing someone with LSD against their will should be a crime.\n\nI had the (mis?) fortune of being at one of his shows, no feces thrown, but lots of running headfirst into the crowd swinging his fists, which I wasn't thrilled with, a lot of the kids were like gazelles at the watering hole, ready to bolt lol, the band was ok\n\nyes!\n\nI was GG's neighbor in 1988; he lived in the apartment building next to mine in Allston, and we would frequently wait for the T (the Boston subway) together on Commonwealth Avenue. I was only 18, so he scared the **** out of me (no pun intended here), as I knew who he was and that his band was pretty much banned in Boston. I avoided him.\n\nOnce, he and his bandmates walked into the record store where I worked, and GG bought a NY Dolls live videotape. Again, I avoided him.\n\nThe next time he saw me at the T station, GG made a beeline toward me. I was terrified.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said, in a perfectly normal voice, \"is the new Patti Smith record out yet?\"\n\nI stammered \"No, it comes out Tuesday.\"\n\nHe said \"Thanks\" and that was it. I couldn't believe that he recognized me from the record store.\n\nAfter that day I had several exchanges with him, once at the local supermarket of all places, and he was always pleasant. Someone, I forget who, said \"Catch GG before he's had his first drink, and he's okay.\"\n\nSubstance abuse, especially when combined with mental illness, is a helluva lot more dangerous than rock-n-roll."
