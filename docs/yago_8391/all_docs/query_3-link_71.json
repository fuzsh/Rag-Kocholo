        "text": "The Wolf of Oren-Yaro\n\nAuthor: K.S. Villoso // Published: July 23, 2019\n\n★★★★\n\nA queen of a divided land must unite her people, even if they hate her, even if it means stopping a ruin that she helped create. A debut epic fantasy from an exciting new voice.\n\n“They called me the Bitch Queen, the she-wolf, because I murdered a man and exiled my king the night before they crowned me.”\n\nBorn under the crumbling towers of Oren-yaro, Queen Talyien was the shining jewel and legacy of the bloody War of the Wolves, which nearly tore her nation apart. But her arranged marriage with the son of a rival clan should herald peaceful days to come.\n\nHowever, her husband’s sudden departure before their reign begins puts a quick end to those dreams, and the kingdom is fractured beyond repair.\n\nYears later, Talyien receives a message, one that will send her across the sea. What’s meant to be an effort at reconciling the past becomes an assassination attempt. Stranded in a land she doesn’t know, with no idea whom she can trust, Talyien will have to embrace her namesake.\n\nA wolf of Oren-yaro is not tamed.\n\nGoodreads\n\n“I think I understand you,” I said. I also thought I wanted to hit him in the face, but not everybody appreciated knowing that.”\n\nI wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into when I picked up this book. I haven’t seen many people talk about it but I did notice a few Twitter friends praising it and what can I say? I had to read it. Let me just tell you that this was unlike anything I’ve ever read! (I’ve been saying that a lot lately) but I mean it.\n\nI’m so happy I gave this book a chance. It was definitely an adult fantasy. I haven’t read that many books in this genre but I adored this one so much! I got through it 3 days mostly because I wanted to take my time with it. There’s a lot of political intrigue which I actually really enjoyed. I loved following the story through Queen Talyien’s perspective. She wasn’t a perfect character. She often got stuck and had no one beside her that she could trust but she always used her head no matter how overwhelming. I loved seeing her become a bit more sure of herself as the story went on. I was exasperated at times with what she was going through but I rooted for her so hard. She was determined and only wanted what was best for her kingdom and her family.\n\n“They called me “bitch”, the she-wolf, because I murdered a man and made my husband leave the night before they crowned me.”\n\nThere were some side characters and although I didn’t really feel much for any of them I definitely loved Khine. He was such a sweetheart and I just loved their banter and shared moments. There was a lot of second guessing on my part when it came to the characters. You couldn’t be too sure who to trust. Characters aside, I’m not Asian and can’t comment on the representation but I do know that a lot of Asian friends really loved this one and they would definitely know better.\n\nAs for the information I thought it was flushed out really well. There was a lot of talk about Queen Talyien’s life and what happened during her fathers time and between the kingdoms. I liked that it wasn’t heaped all in one go and overwhelming. The author put the information in just the right places so everything came slowly and right when it needed to be known. The plot was a bit slow but I found myself already sucked in so there wasn’t anything to do but continue.\n\nI hadn’t realized that I reached the end of the book because of how absorbed I was into the story. I flipped the page and found out I was already done. Book two comes out this year and I’m so excited to see what happens next! This is definitely one I would recommend you to read.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nK.S. Villoso was born in a dank hospital on an afternoon in Albay, Philippines, and things have generally been okay since then. After spending most of her childhood in a slum area in Taguig (where she dodged death-defying traffic, ate questionable food, and fell into open-pit sewers more often than one ought to), she and her family immigrated to Vancouver, Canada, where they spent the better part of two decades trying to chase the North American Dream. She is now living amidst the forest and mountains with her family, children, and dogs in Anmore, BC."
