        "text": "1983 film\n\nThe Story of PieraDirected byMarco FerreriWritten byProduced byStarringCinematographyEnnio GuarnieriEdited byRuggero MastroianniMusic by\n\nPhilippe Sarde\n\nsax soloist Stan Getz\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n107 minutesCountryItalyLanguagesItalian, West Germany\n\nThe Story of Piera (Italian: Storia di Piera) is a 1983 Italian drama film directed by Marco Ferreri.[1] Hanna Schygulla won the award for Best Actress at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film starts in one of the new towns of Latina with the birth of Piera, daughter of the somewhat unbalanced Eugenia and her apparently sane husband Lorenzo, who has a job with the PCI. Eugenia's behaviour at home and in public becomes increasingly erratic and when on top of this Lorenzo loses his post, the strain puts him into a mental hospital. Piera leaves school to work for a dressmaker and pursues her dream of acting, eventually breaking into television and theatre. Interleaved with her outside life we see her sexual development, from kissing neighbourhood boys to a lesbian relationship while she is in hospital with breathing problems and finally to adult men. While Piera is maturing as a woman and as an actress, Eugenia is deteriorating and has to be locked away. The film ends with Piera taking her mother out for the day to a deserted beach, where the two women undress and hug each other tightly in a moment of natural tenderness.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nIsabelle Huppert as Piera\n\nHanna Schygulla as Eugenia\n\nMarcello Mastroianni as Lorenzo\n\nAngelo Infanti as Tito and as actor playing Jason\n\nTanya Lopert as Elide\n\nBettina Grühn as the young Piera\n\nRenato Cecchetto\n\nMaurizio Donadoni as Massimo\n\nAiché Nanà as the midwife\n\nGirolamo Marzano\n\nLidia Montanari as \"Cento mille lires\"\n\nLaura Trotter as young midwife\n\nMarina Zanchi\n\nLina Bernardi\n\nElisabetta Ambrosini\n\nFiametta Baraila\n\nSerana Bennato\n\nRita Caldana\n\nCristina Forti\n\nLoredana Bertè (herself, singer \"Sei bellissima\")\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
