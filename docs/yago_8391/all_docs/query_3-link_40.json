        "text": "If there’s one thing that divides the bookish community more than any other, it’s book trailers.\n\nOK, and love triangles, but book trailers are pretty controversial.\n\nPersonally, I love them. Nothing gets me more excited for a new book than a trailer with epic music, flashes of the characters in exciting scenarios, and gripping titles that give me just enough of the plot to really grab my attention.\n\nOne of my closest friends is brilliantly talented at creating and editing videos (she edits all my [frankly terrible] video snippets for my day job) and she made these absolutely gorgeous trailers for my debut novel, The Fair Queen, and my short story anthology, Enchanted Waters.\n\nSound on for an epic cinematic experience!\n\nI honestly fangirl over my own stories watching these.\n\nThe first book trailer I think I ever saw was for Throne of Glass by Sarah J. Maas, which is still one of my favourite series. It was captivating and lured me in, and sadly I thought it meant there was a movie in the works because I had never come across the concept of a book trailer before. Now I’m addicted to watching them – although they still make me wish every book would be turned into a film.\n\nHave you read Nevernight by Jay Kristoff? It’s a really dark and bloody adult fantasy series inspired by Roman culture, with some of the most incredible world-building I’ve ever experienced. There are three suns so it is almost literally “nevernight”. Genius.\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nSo, an actress named Piera Forde decided to film a series of shorts adapted from Nevernight and share them on her YouTube channel, and it is one of my favourite things. To have an actor love your book so much that they decide to fund their own serial adaptation of the story? Absolute author bucket list item right there.\n\n(Piera actually has a short film of The Assassin’s Blade by S. J. Maas on her channel too – definitely worth a watch to see her play Celaena!)\n\nIf anyone feels like doing the same thing for The Fair Queen, let me know! I’m all for it.\n\nLyndsey\n\nx\n\nHi guys! I thought you all might be missing my face since my last video in March, so here is my May Illumicrate unboxing! I had to cut it loads because I kept fumbling my words, I left some in (explusive, anyone?) for your entertainment, so please enjoy my ramblings and the contents of this quarter’s bookish subscription box.\n\nIf you like, you can pop over to YouTube and subscribe to my channel, it’d be lovely to have you!\n\nHere is a list of links to the products mentioned in this video:\n\nIllumicrate – http://www.illumicrate.com/\n\nTruth or Dare by Non Pratt – http://buff.ly/2svbcdl\n\nThe Waking Land by Callie Bates – http://buff.ly/2tTtNO4\n\nFeyre mug by Merwild (Coralie Jubenot) – http://buff.ly/2tTS4Ua\n\nMermaid Lagoon candle by Flickerink – http://buff.ly/2tTGqsM\n\nMap bookmark by Penguin Co\n\nEnchanted door hanger and print by TJ Lubrano – http://buff.ly/2tTGjxj\n\nSwish & Flick keyring by Nutmeg & Arlo – http://buff.ly/2t0MYbZ\n\nPoster from Windfall by Jennifer E.

All my own opinions.\n\nHello! I’ve got something a bit different for you today, it’s my February Illumicrate unboxing, but instead of trying to photograph the contents I decided to film a vlog!\n\nI have never done this before so please forgive the light from the window glinting off my glasses (is there any way to stop that and still have enough light??) and my sniffing, I’m clearly getting a cold *thumbs down*.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nLinks to products mentioned in this video:\n\nIllumicrate – http://www.illumicrate.com/\n\nWintersong by S. Jae-Jones – http://buff.ly/2nJKJH7\n\nRed Sister by Mark Lawrence – http://buff.ly/2ngOVet\n\nBare Necessities pouch by Literary Lifestyle Company – https://literarylifestylecompany.com/\n\nMagic & Mischief lip balm by Bookish Serendipity Co – http://buff.ly/2nJI5Bi\n\nA Darker Shade of Magnets by Her Bookish Things – http://buff.ly/2nJNKr6\n\nFantastic Beasts bookmark by Jane’s Tiny Things – http://buff.ly/2nJDZJg\n\nFlame in the Mist sampler by Renee Ahdieh – http://buff.ly/2ngZkqi\n\nI bought Illumicrate with my own money and didn’t receive anything in exchange for this review! All my own opinions.\n\nWhat did you think of this box? I absolutely loved it, especially the surprise second book! It was very heavy when it arrived – always a good sign. I do love a good bookish candle though, the Aiden from Illuminae Meraki candle in November’s box smells divine, so here’s hoping the May box includes another candle!\n\nDid you enjoy my first ever vlog? Would you like more videos? Let me know in the comments. You can subscribe to my YouTube channel as well if you prefer watching vlogs!\n\nUntil next time,\n\nLyndsey\n\nx"
