        "text": "SELECTED FOR BOOKS AT BERLINALE 2021!\n\nIn this powerful debut novel, the beauty of the Arctic nature in Lapland contrasts with the brutal actions conducted both at a secret Nazi prison camp during the Second World War and against the indigenous Sámi people after the war. These secrets are buried deep, while inconceivable destinies drive the narration, resulting in an intoxicating read.\n\nIn the middle of the Arctic wilderness in North-Eastern Lapland, in 1944:\n\nA young Finnish soldier, Väinö, works as a translator at a German-led prison camp where extreme cruelty is part of daily life, not only prisoners but also guards have to fight to preserve their humanity. The crimes committed are buried deep in human mind, but later omitted with complete silence in the official history.\n\nThe town of Enontekiö in Western Lapland, from 1947 to 1950:\n\nJournalist and photographer Inkeri settles in the town, to write a series of reports on Lapland’s reconstruction. She also has an agenda of her own: to find out what happened to her husband who disappeared during the war.\n\nThe more Inkeri gets to know her young tenant Olavi – who is also originally from the south but has lingered in Lapland after the war ended – the more convinced she becomes that he is hiding something concerning her husband’s destiny.\n\nInkeri is also acquainted with a young Sámi girl who lives at the local boarding school where the objective is to assimilate the Sámi children to the dominant culture.\n\nUnderneath the skies of polar night and midnight sun, dark secrets begin to unfold.\n\nHistorical note:\n\nFinland was an ally to Hitler’s Germany against the Soviet Union during the second World War, from 1941 to 1944. In 1944, Finland negotiated a secret separate peace treaty with the Soviets. A part of that treaty was the demand that the Finnish army needed to chase the German troops out of Finnish territory. The Finns waged war to force the Germans to retreat to Norway via the Northern route in 1944 and 1945; this period is known as the Lapland War. As a result, Lapland was burnt to ashes when the Germans used the so called scorched-earth policy.\n\nFor decades, it was claimed that there were no Nazi camps in Finland during the Second World War, nor were the Finns taking part in the deportation of the Jews. Recent historic research has however showed that these two claims have been untrue: In fact, traces of more than 200 Nazi camps have been found in Northern Finland, and it has been proven that racial projects were conducted at these camps, or at least made possible by actions taken at the camps.\n\nFurthermore, racial projects on the Sámi people – the indigenous people in Lapland, living in Northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia and speaking several Sámi languages – were continued in Finland after the war, all the way to 1960’s and even 1970’s. Today, the Sámi are the only officially recognised indigenous people in the European Union\n\nThis web of competing nationalistic and ethnic motivations is depicted for the first time in Finnish literature in Land of Snow and Ashes."
