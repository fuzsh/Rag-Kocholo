        "text": "Wine World Documentaries\n\nSome powerful documentaries about wine were produced in this century.\n\n• The best known, yet controversial, is “Mondovino,” an official selection at the Cannes film festival, which fiercely criticized the wine globalization process and the loss of diversity in the wine world. The movie stirs the consciences and makes you think. It was filmed in 2004, but what it explains is still very relevant today, and in fact, some of its prophecies have sadly come true.\n\nAfter Mondovino, there have been several outstanding documentaries. One, for instance, treats the incredible story of convicted fraudster Rudi Kurniawan.\n\n• “Sour Grapes” is available on Amazon Prime. It’s a fast-paced documentary that bluntly teaches us about the dirtiest part of the business. It opens with a crowded and festive wine tasting event in an elegant hotel, then intermixed with images of investigators examining bottles and labels. “Do we have any reason to believe this bottle is counterfit?” plays on the audio track, and the scene is set for introducing the world of wine auctions, extremely wealthy wine enthusiasts, and Rudi’s particular capacity for manufacturing deception. Interviews include wine detective Maureen Downey, who, along with the FBI, ultimately proved to be Kurniawan’s downfall. He’s now back on the wine scene, but that’s another story (or maybe a new documentary).\n\nOther Great Wine Documentaries\n\n• “Red Obsession” explores the obsession for Bordeaux, the holy grail of fine wines, by a booming and voracious Chinese market, and from there, its impact on the global market. It delves into the intricacies of the wine business. Roger Ebert described: “The narration is simply done, providing us with the necessary context to understand the interconnectedness of this world, its history, its reliance on weather, politics and trade agreements. Informative though it may be, ‘Red Obsession’ is a moody and emotional piece of work.”\n\n• “Somm” tells the adventures and misadventures of four aspiring master sommeliers. This documentary delves into the intense preparation for the prestigious MS exam, offering a behind-the-scenes look at their rigorous training and dedication.The ending will literally leave you frozen… And it pushes you to watch the sequal: “Somm into the Wine.” This film is perhaps more thoughtful, with questions like: what is wine, where does it come from, and where is it going?\n\n• “Blood into Wine” and “Barolo Boys” both recount the stories of wine pioneers and rebels, the one set in Arizona and the other in Barolo. “Blood” portrays follows multiplatinum recording artist Maynard James Keenan as he sets out to bring status to Arizona’s burgeoning wine regions. “Barolo Boys: The Story of a Revolution” explores the story of a group of winemakers who revolutionized winemaking in the Barolo region of Italy, challenging traditional practices. In some way, they fight to do what they believe in honestly, sometimes brutally so. Wine is the driving force, and it’s exciting to see how vinous passion moves people in both films.\n\nWhich are your favorite wine movies?"
