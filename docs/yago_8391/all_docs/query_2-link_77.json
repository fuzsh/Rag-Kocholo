        "text": "''Dear Maestro'' was shown as part of last year's New Directors/New Films Series under the title ''Chopin.'' Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review that appeared in The New York Times on March 21. The film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza 3, Broadway between 62d and 63d Streets.\n\n''CHOPIN,'' as ''Dear Maestro'' was originally called, was an odd title for Luciano Odorisio's spirited comedy, which turns out not to be about the composer himself, but about a small Italian provincial city, where a new orchestra is being assembled. There appears to be considerable competition for the conductor's job, and this provides Mr. Odorisio with what little excuse he needs for a plot. For the most part, though, his film is cheerfully anecdotal, without any well-defined center but with a wit and intelligence that help hold it together.\n\n''Dear Maestro'' is also very adroitly acted, by a cast headed by Michele Placido and Giuliana De Sio. They play Francesco and Marta, the foremost conducting hopeful and his sexy, faithless, but very companionable wife. Francesco, who has a way of becoming physically ill every time he thinks of anyone else's landing the job, is a 40-ish academic less troubled by Marta's frequent infidelities than by his own unrealized ambitions. Somehow, the two seem to have a satisfying marriage.\n\nThe movie, which is set in the city of Chieti, introduces a group of music-world oddballs and gossips, including one very minor character who has earned the nickname of ''Chopin'' by trying to pass off one of Chopin's compositions as his own. All of them are busily engaged in speculation about the new orchestra, and there is some feeling that a local-born conductor now living in Milan, named Serano, will be invited back. Maestro Serano does indeed appear, but in a moving and unexpected way, as he re-encounters Francesco, who is a longtime friend. Mr. Odorisio makes their meeting sound the film's most stirring note.\n\nMr. Odorisio, who has worked with the Taviani brothers and Marco Ferreri, gives the film some amusing details, including Francesco's and Marta's electrified version of Botticelli's Venus (it's a lamp), and a couple of Indian house guests who think it is beautiful and would give anything to buy it from them. He also fills the soundtrack with some very unlikely music, including one country-and- western-style song by an Italian pop crooner and the theme from ''New York, New York.'' The latter is played with the film's opening credits, as we first see Chieti, a city whose medieval architecture and charming setting don't accurately mirror the show-business ambitions of some of its denizens.\n\nSearch for Conductor\n\nDEAR MAESTRO, written and directed by Luciano Odorisio (Italian with English subtitles); camera, Nando Forni; edited by Antonio Uterzi; at the Lincoln Plaza 3, Broadway between 62d and 63d Streets.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
