        "text": "Two and a half years ago, in the middle of the pandemic when no one was traveling, I won the lottery and became CEO of Lonely Planet (when Red Ventures — a great company I was consulting for — acquired it). Leading this legendary brand and imagining its future has been one of the most fun rides of my life. A few memories as a lifelong fan of Lonely Planet: Traveling by train across India with my partner Piera in 2005 using LP as our bible or sitting in an airport terminal in Burundi three weeks before lockdown reading LP’s East Africa guidebook and imagining all the places we could go to next. Today, thanks to the work of an amazing team of people, Lonely Planet is thriving and I’ve decided that it’s time for the next challenge. Here are 5 quick highlights from the last 2.5 years: 1. Reimagining the essence of the iconic LP brand as travel that transforms you — the story-worthy travel that stays with you long after the trip is over. 2. Building a whole new digital experience. Taking the time to build relationships with travelers that are personalized, meaningful and evolving LP to a membership business. So much great work - and growth - is underway here. Sign up at LP.com to follow along. 3. Appreciating how truly great a book business can be when you take a fresh look at everything that goes into it. It's rewarding to create books that stand the test of time and serve as companions. If you’re near a bookstore head to the travel section to see for yourself. (PS: books aren’t going anywhere). 4. Acquiring Elsewhere.io, an amazing travel business that connects you with local experts to plan epic trips. I highly recommend checking it out if you’re dreaming of an adventure. I know I will still use it long after I am gone. 5. Sourcing many new incredible local contributors from around the world. The LP spirit – seeking exploration, fun and connection – is the same spirit I take with me into the next chapter. For now, my mind is racing to plot some epic trips this year."
