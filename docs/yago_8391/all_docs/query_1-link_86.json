        "text": "Salve ragazzi,\n\nBella notizia! New York’s Lincoln Center announced the dates for Open Roads, New Italian Cinema: May 28 – June 6.\n\nThe virus cancelled Lincoln Center’s Open Roads New Italian Cinema last year, but not this year! And although I will miss going to New York and meeting all of the directors and actors, this is good news for YOU, because this year Open Roads will be virtual.\n\nOpen Roads brings the best contemporary Italian cinema to the USA, making it possible to see films that wouldn’t otherwise have been available here. For me, it’s better than Christmas. I have gotten the chance to meet and talk with so many of the fascinating and famous in Italian cinema!\n\nI haven’t heard about the 2021 lineup yet, but I will let you know when I do.\n\nNEW TO STREAMING - Favola (FairyTale)\n\nI had a lot of fun watching this one yesterday!\n\nFavola is an LBGTQ screwball comedy in gorgeous living 1950s technicolor that features Mrs Fairytale (Filippo Timi) as the perfect ’50s housewife, her stuffed poodle, Lady, and her best friend, Mrs. Emerald (Lucia Mascino). Piera Degli Esposti plays Mother, who visits Fairytale only to remind her that she prefers her (never seen but reportedly abusive) husband.\n\nIt was shocking how immediately I was able to accept Timi as a ’50s fashion plate (Those dresses! I want them!), talking with Lady and spending her days offering Mrs. Emerald luscious looking cocktails. Watch this movie for the clothes and the set design, if for nothing else. Lovers of mid-century modern, ’50s TV, and COLOR, COLOR, COLOR will be captivated from start to finish.\n\nThe comedy is what we used to call “madcap”: Who’s roofying whose cocktail? and Shouldn’t you let that guy out of the bathroom? and Put down that gun Mrs. Favola; someone’s gonna get hurt.\n\nBut the love story is actually very sweet, and as zany as the story can be, that’s how touching and sad it can be, as well.\n\nI’d better issue a silliness warning, for those who detest whimsy and fanciful storylines. I usually do, but not this time. The irony and satire (and the fashion!) got me good. Oh, and Filippo Timi. He’s the best.\n\nWhere to get it:\n\nAMAZON\n\nSpeaking of Filippo Timi…\n\nThe star of Favola, Filippo Timi, has been one of my favorites ever since he starred in Marco Bellocchio’s Vincere, the story of Benito Mussolini. I think it was Newsweek that called his performance “one of the top ten of 2010 that wouldn’t get an Oscar”.\n\nI first saw Timi in person at the Venice Film Festival when he was there for a really adorable movie called Missione Di Pace. In it, he played a pretty hilarious Che Guevara. I saw him standing all alone in the theater and thought it might be a great time to catch him for one of my famous selfies, but as I approached, he appeared to act like he didn’t see me and he walked away.\n\nKnowing what I now, it might not have been the snub I’d thought it was. Timi is practically blind, suffering from something called Stargardt which limits his center field of vision. This guy had so much going against him when he was young, what with the eye problems, a reported stammer, epilepsy, and, they say, he was a chubby little guy. But look at him now! He’s one of Italy’s finest actors and he’s HOT, to boot. For those of you have lusted after the handsome Timi, I have bad news; he’s taken. He’s actually married to Sebastiano Mauri, the director of Favola.\n\nSebastiano has promised to give me some insight into the movie, so hopefully I will have that for you soon.\n\nWhiny Baby of the Day: Gabriele Muccino\n\n“Let’s face it, dear @PremioDavid jury, this is the umpteenth time (and since 2003 when you first snubbed my work), that’s you’ve blown it. It’s not me who is the loses, but it’s you - your credibility, which has been lost for years.”\n\nHey Gabriele, I have some advice for you. Stop making movies that stink and maybe they’ll stop snubbing you. (Seen Fathers and Daughters? Don’t bother.) As president and artistic director of the David di Donatellos Piera Detassis pointed out, the there are many, many people who vote on the awards, so if he’s going to pick a fight with the academy, he’d better be prepared.\n\nHey everyone, Buona Pasqua, and Buona Pesach! Have a wonderful and blessed weekend - alla prossima volta!\n\nUn bacione,\n\nCheri"
