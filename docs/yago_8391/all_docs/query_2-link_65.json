        "text": "PEPLUM! SWORD AND SANDAL, SWORD, AND FANTASY,\n\nOR ADVENTURE, THAT IS THE QUESTION.\n\nA brief look at the genre that was dubbed Sword and Sandal or Peplum.\n\nHercules, Goliath, Samson, Maciste, and other such characters were regularly featured in Italian produced Sword and Sandal movies, or to give them their correct genre name, Peplum or Pepla. (the latter being the plural). I must say now that I have never been a great fan of this genre, but I also have to admit that the films were bountiful in the action and imagination departments, rich in colours and had wonderful costumes, they also did from time to time have an interesting or quirky storyline, but I personally found these mini epics or Biblical leaning tales a little too slow and at times downright boring.\n\nThey became the staple fodder of many Saturday morning picture clubs that were so popular in the 1960’s in the UK, I am proud to say that I was an ABC Minor, and was one of the kids cheering on the hero and hissing and booing the in the traditional pantomime way. At the time of seeing my first Peplum I was very young, probably about eight or nine years of age, so this would have been around 1963 or 64, but I knew even then that these movies were different as in sometimes the actor’s mouths did not move when dialogue was being heard. (not that you could hear it most of the time above the hullabaloo of the kids screaming).\n\nOf course, dubbing improved as the years rolled forward, but I still never appreciated fully the antics of Gladiators, Romans, Greeks, Barbarians, and Saracens as various scenarios played out on screen in these dramas that were set in ancient times. But saying that I did enjoy films such as El Cid and Spartacus.\n\nCompared to the adventures of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon, which were also regulars at the Saturday morning fracas, the Sword and Sandal tales seemed rather tame, after all Buck and Flash were real heroes who fought the bad guys and always won. And the episodes all had cliffhanger endings, with a trailer for the next episode being shown as soon as the action had finished with a voice over telling everyone in the cinema “Don’t Miss the Next Thrilling Episode”.\n\nI think it was the duration of those early peplums that I had the problem with, a serial would be twenty or maybe thirty mins in length whereas a feature film would be at least eighty, which for an eight- or nine-year-old is a long time to sit still in itchy seats dodging kia-ora orange drink cartons that were being thrown everywhere and trying to make head or tail of what was going on up there on the screen.\n\nAs I said I think my first real encounter with an Italian sword and sandal epic was in the early 1960’s, when the Astoria cinema was showing Goliath and the Barbarians, starring the muscle-bound American actor, Steeve Reeves who was supported by Chelo Alonso as the love interest (she played a small part in Leone’s The Good the Bad and The Ugly at the beginning of the movie, Angel eyes killed her husband).\n\nThe original title of the film was Il Terrore dei Barbari, which I found out years later, so was it really anything to do with Goliath at all? Its tag line said it all, A Thousand and One Women Dream of his Embrace! I think I enjoyed it, I say I think because I can’t really recall much about it, all I knew at the time that there was a lot of swordfights going on, displays of strength and nasty baddies, with the central character being the hero of the piece even if he did kiss that girl in the film (Yuk).\n\nSo maybe I will start my look at the Peplum or The Sword and Sandal adventure genre with this movie from 1959. Although it was produced in the final year of the 1950’s it never reached the U.S.A. or the U.K. till the early sixties. The print I saw probably was edited heavily, which made it a little incomprehensible at times, and had a musical score by Les Baxter, which replaced the original Italian score by the talented Maestro Carlo Innocenzi.\n\nI will say here and now that the score by Innocenzi is in my opinion far superior and more in keeping with the epic sound as created by the likes of the great Hollywood composers of the 1930’s 40’s and early 50’s. The film which was directed by Carlo Campogalliani is listed as an adventure, but always seems to be discussed as a peplum and included within that genre of film. It had a simple plot, when barbarians invade his village and kill his father, a local man (Reeves) vows revenge and begins to wage a one-man war against them. The man we can only assume is Goliath in the title of the film.\n\nBut Goliath was a name thrown into the hat by American film makers, a name taken from the book of Samuel in the Bible and applied to the Reeves character, (remember the story of David and Goliath) why? Well I don’t know and the American distributors probably did not either.\n\nThe character of Hercules however had appeared a year previous in Pietro Francisci’s film Le fatiche di Ercole (Hercules) that was scored by composer Enzo Masetti, the movie starred Steve Reeves, and it was this production that was responsible for spawning a series of nineteen movies that were produced from the late 1950’s onwards, and which some forty plus years later were still being produced, the hero returned to the screen in two movies in 2014 that were released almost simultaneously, but neither did well at the box office.\n\nOf course, there was the version that was released in 1983 with strong man Lou Ferringo (The Hulk) in the title role, which was produced by Italian film makers, directed by Luigi Cozzi and had a score by Pino Donaggio, but the less said about that particular outing the better, apart from the score or at least the rousing march like theme from it. The production is totally forgettable before you even finish watching it. In fact, I think it is fair to say that most of the Hercules films produced after the decade of the 1960’s are not worth viewing, many of the more recent entries trying to place the hero in a contemporary dateline, as in New York City, which does not work at all.\n\nThis is what happens when non-Italian film makers get involved and think that they can improve on a series of films that have entertained audiences for years. Yes, the original Italian movies maybe cheesy and cliched, but there is just something about them that makes fans return to them often and made me in the end take a shine to a handful. I suppose we must ask the question was the Hercules series a peplum, or was it a fantasy adventure?\n\nHercules features in Greek mythology, so does this mean that movies such as Clash of the Titans can also be called peplum even if they were not produced by Italian filmmakers? Or are they Sword and Fantasy, Sword and Sorcery or what? Films in this at times quirky and outrageous genre, were given the name Peplum by French movie critics in the early 1960s, and although it is a label that stuck, it was a rather cruel way of referring to the films as a collective, at first being regarded as an insult by many Italian, producers and directors, the harsh way in which the Peplum was named also happened a few years later when critics dubbed the Italian made western the Spaghetti western or Macaroni western. And these were not the only types of Italian movies that were given nicknames to describe them, Filone, (a type of bread), Giallo, (the colour yellow), Mondo, (world, because they were-mainly documentaries). I think they were meant as a disparaging label at first but after a while become something that was quite endearing.\n\nSword and Sandal movies that included a strong man figure such as Hercules, or Goliath, often featured American actors in the central role, such as the already mentioned Steve Reeves, with other Stateside names such as Paul Wynter, Mark Forest, and Reg Park stepping into the sandals and donning the Enkyklon (Greek Toga) to bring these characters to life. And as the genre of the Peplum developed and grew, we would see more and more non-Italian actors being given leading roles, such as Cameron Mitchell, which Italian studios thought maybe would make the movies more acceptable to American audiences. Again, this was something that happened in the Italian western and the Gothic horrors as produced by the likes of Bava and Argento.\n\nActors would be given American sounding names, and composers also would write under an alias,\n\nEven the Italian-American actor Lorenzo Luis Degni, (Lou to his friends) was given a more Americanised sounding name and was credited as Mark Forest, for his appearances in examples such as La Vendetta di Ercole, aka Goliath and the Dragon. Which was directed by Vittorio Cottafavi, in 1960. and Maciste l’eroe più Grande del Mondo aka-Goliath and the Sins of Babylon, which was helmed by Michele Lupo, in 1963,and contained a rousing score by Francesco De Masi. Which we come to later.\n\nSword and Sandal epics would often be co-productions with cast and crews from all over Europe, but predominantly being from Italy, Spain, Germany, and France. At the same time as the Italians were making their peplums, American film crews were utilising the facilities of Cinecitta for numerous Biblically slanted productions, (Ben Hur, King of Kings, Sodom and Gomorrah etc), and it would be the way that Hollywood deserted Italy after the epic bubble had burst that galvanised Italian directors and producers to re-invent the western.\n\nSo, let’s move away from Hercules and his like and go to tales of Greece and Rome, some of which were rich in romance, adventure and epic proportions, and others which contained a leaning towards the mystical the mysterious and the fantasy worlds of Gods and Demons. But in this article, I don’t think I will be assessing the qualities of the movies, but focusing more upon the style and sounds on their soundtracks, employed by composers such as De Masi, Lavagnino, Rustichelli, Savina, Fusco, etc etc.\n\nAs I have already said the Peplum is not exactly my favourite genre, but if it were not for the Sword and Sandal adventures of the 1950’s and early 1960’s we would not have the spaghetti western. I am not going to examine every Peplum, doing that I think would send you to sleep, (wake up at the back) but I will pick titles here and there and not even in any order or year of release, (so the ones I like then ok).\n\nL’assedio di Siracusa (The Siege Of Syracuse) was released in 1960, directed by Pietro Francisci, and starring Rossano Brazzi, Tina Louise, Sylva Koscina, Enrico Maria Salerno, Gino Cervi, Alberto Farnese, Luciano Marin, and Alfredo Varelli. The film is set during the Second Punic War between 214 and 212 B.C. and focuses upon the Roman siege of the Greek city of Syracuse. The Romans are preparing for their invasion, but Greek scientist and philosopher Archimedes (Brazzi) invents what looks like an oversized mirrored dish that reflects the sun’s rays and produces a powerful beam of light, that is strong enough to burn the Roman fleet.\n\nThe score was the work of Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, and it is one of the composers finest works in this particular genre, the music is initially dramatic, but has to it a fragile and romantic sound, which at times becomes lilting and emotive. The composer utilising solo violin throughout the work and an ample helping of strings and far away sounding horns.\n\nThese elements combine with woods to create beautiful tone poems that are effective, rich, and supportive to the storyline, but also are wonderfully haunting and mesmerizing away from the images. The score was released onto CD by Digit Movies in 2009 and contained twenty-nine tracks from the soundtrack. Considering the age of the score the recording has excellent sound quality thanks to the remastering, and is presented well with info on the movie and score and numerous stills from the production illustrating the booklet.\n\nDigit movies was a label that embarked on an extensive programme of releasing Italian film scores onto CD and would at times release a score that had never been available before, normally taken from the vaults of vintage labels such as CAM records who were really the first soundtrack specialist label, being established long before Varese, La La Land, Quartet, and Intrada. It seemed at one point that Digit Movies had the monopoly on the Italian film music market, its output putting most other labels into the shadows.\n\nThe soundtracks that they released on to CD were from all genres, but it is the Peplum scores that we will focus upon within this article, of course other labels began to issue and re-issue sword and sandal epic scores, and we will also look at these. A score I had many years ago on a CAM LP record was Saul and David, (CAM CMS 30.127) which was released in 1964.\n\nNow, this is one of the movies that I would argue is not a peplum, but a Biblical story, with a mixture of adventure and romance, but many do categorise it as a Sword and Sandal, the music was grand and certainly had epic proportions to it, the prelude being a classically slanted piece performed by brass, percussion, and strings, the composer Teo Usuelli fashioning a beautifully lavish sounding central theme for the movie that was filled with emotion, purveyed a sense of tragedy and created drama but also having shades of melancholy. The soundtrack was later re-issued onto CD as part of the CAM soundtrack encyclopaedia. The release boasted bright and vibrant artwork compared with the original LP cover, which had a red background and a monochrome picture of one of the characters from the film.\n\nTeo Usuelli was born in Italy on December 13th 1920, he completed his educational studies in Milan. After having received his diploma in Humanities, he attended the Faculty of Pure Mathematics at the State University for four years with good results. He specialized in music, choir, and song in 1944 and graduated in Composition from the Conservatory Giuseppe Verdi of Milan in 1945.\n\nAfter having fought the Nazi’s as a partisan from 1941 to 1945, after the war he began his musical career as a director of vocal polyphonic groups for various concerts and radio programs of polyphonic music, paying particular attention to the Italians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He moved to Rome in the late forties and was very much in demand and became busy writing music for cinema and television. In the field of folk music, he studied Italian regional groups, and his transcriptions, from the laudi of the 1200s to the songs of the mountain, are now in the repertoire of numerous choirs. Among the most famous are Montagnes Valdotaines and Belle rose du printemps. He has also composed various songs, such as Meravigliose labbra and La canzone del faro, which were successful. He taught “Harmony and Counterpoint” in the conservatories of Piacenza, Bologna and L’Aquila; he retired from teaching in 1986, and then created for RAI 3 TV a series of 6 episodes, entitled Che musica è each of which was dedicated to a major contemporary Italian composer. Uselli acted as Conductor and took part in debates with the public and presenting various music performed by “Spettro sonoro”. During his later career the composer began working on music with computers, programming and composing “digital music”. He collaborated with the C.R.M. (Center for Music Research) of Rome, creating software for the projects “FLY10” and “FLY30”. Among his compositions in this genre are Mooning for soprano and c64, Sinite for Fly10 and soprano, and Nomina for Fly30 and soprano. He collaborated with filmmaker Marco Ferreri as well as many other well-known and respected directors. He died in Rome on April 13th 2009.\n\nAround about the same time as I purchased Saul and David on LP I was lucky enough to add Maciste l´eroe piu Grande del Mondo to my collection, again on a CAM LP. With similar cover design to that of Saul and David, it had the monochrome picture of two characters from the film in a chariot, on a dark red background with Greek hieroglyphics in gold. In the UK the movie was entitled Goliath and the sins of Babylon, the score by Francesco De Masi has been re-issued onto CD by CAM in recent years, but I still prefer sometimes to put the LP on the turntable and let it play, pops and crackles included.\n\nDe Masi penned a vibrant, heroic, and romantic sounding work, which was dominated by sweeping strings, booming percussion, and urgent brass, with a lilting and emotive love theme performed by solo violin which was charming and haunting.\n\nThe composer also provided the film with a memorable march composition that at times sounded more like a pirate movie score, but still effecting and supportive.\n\nWhen released in the United States it was distributed by American International who straight away decided to have the movie re-scored by Les Baxter, even though De Masi’s music was excellent. De Masi scored numerous Peplums, and wrote the music for several Historical dramas, Suleiman the Conqueror from 1961 coming to mind instantly.\n\nIn 1964 the composer scored Maciste nelle miniere del re Salomone (Maciste in the mines of King Solomon) which starred Reg Park in the role of a strongman, this is where I think I get confused, so many strong men all played by different leading actors, all calling themselves Maciste, Hercules, or Goliath. De Masi’s score is magnificent, filled with epic sounds and proud anthem like theme’s, but also tinged with a hint of mystery and drama.\n\nThe score or sections of it were released on a CD from digitmovies, also this is available on digital platforms.\n\nThe album also includes tracks from Kerim Son of the Shiek (1962) which starred Gordon Scott, and La Rivolta della Gladiatrici (The Arena) which was released in 1974.\n\nDe Masi was also responsible for Maciste, il gladiatore più forte del mondo-aka- Colossus of the Arena (1962). Which had Mark Forest in the lead role and was directed by Michele Lupo. Again the composer putting his own unique musical stamp upon the proceedings with highly dramatic and tense musical moments which mingle with strident martial sounding pieces and affecting love themes. Ok, enough of these strongmen before I begin to feel inadequate, and onto other Peplums,\n\nsuch as I Sette Gladiatori-Gladiators 7, which was basically an attempt to cash in on the Magnificent seven movies that were doing well at the box office, the American west being exchanged for Greece and Rome, and apart from a seven in the title that’s where any similarities cease. I always thought that this was rather an odd movie, but hey who I am I to argue with the people who write this stuff. Framed for the escape of five gladiators from the arena, the son of one of Sparta’s leading citizens is sentenced to the arena as a gladiator himself and forced to fight for his life in the Roman Colosseum. Years later he manages to escape and return to Sparta, only to find out the truth about his father’s death, which was ruled as a suicide, but in fact, was a murder. He also finds out that the woman he loves is about to marry the evil king who has usurped the throne. He sets out to enlist the help of six of his fellow gladiators and with them return to Sparta to save his woman and place the rightful king on the throne.\n\nMusic was by Marcello Giombini, who is probably best known for his bouncy theme to the Lee Van Cleef western Sabata (1969).\n\nI thought now might be a good time to mention a movie that is said to be the first Italian Peplum, and no it does not have Hercules, Goliath or any other strongman in the title or cast. Instead, it has seven rather small heroes. I Sette Nani alla Riscossa or The Seven Dwarfs to the Rescue was released in 1951.\n\nDirected by Paola William Tamburella, it starred Rossana Podesta, Roberto Risso and Georges Marchal. The plot is a simple one, having been warned in dreams that Snow White is in danger, the Seven Dwarfs set out to rescue the princess from the evil Prince of Darkness. Well, is it a peplum, it’s on the list, but it is put into the category of a comedy, adventure, fantasy. So again, more confusion.\n\nMusic was by Alessandro Cicognini, who was a composer who favoured small ensembles rather than large orchestras. This Italian film and classical composer, trained at the Milan Conservatory of Music. And from 1946, was frequently associated with the films of Vittorio de Sica. Cicognini retired from film composition in 1965 to pursue a career in teaching. The movie Un’avventura Romantica (2016), directed and co-written by Davide Cavuti, is loosely based on Alessandro Cicognini’s life. In the movie, Cicognini is portrayed by Edoardo Siravo. Born on January 15, 1906 in Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy. He was a composer and writer, known for Bicycle Thieves (1948), he died on November 9, 1995 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs to the Rescue is legendary in certain circles and is looked upon as a not very good children’s movie that was produced in Italy. It is a sequel to Snow White as in the fairy tale that we all know and love and played out in the Disney animated, happy ever after film from 1937. It takes place after the Dwarves first encounter with the Princess, and they have returned to their home in the forest, and she has married her Prince charming, however just when you thought it was safe to eat apples again along comes war, intrigue and political problems which the prince has to take care of. But the Prince is betrayed so the Dwarves set off to help him and Snow White. Their adventures on their way to rescue the Royal couple, do become a little drawn out and tiring, but finally they help the prince and princess and save the day (Yay). So why it is referred to as a Peplum I do not know unless it is referring to the tunics that some of the cast wear?\n\nBut as I have already stated the Peplum contained many odd storylines, and it was a genre that on many occasions crossed over into other types of film, including tales of vampires, monsters, and mythical creatures. So maybe this is where confusion reigns, as to what is a peplum, a sword and sandal, a historical drama, an adventure, a sword, and fantasy, etc etc etc. Sword and Sorcery I always thought referred to the likes of movies such as Conan, The Beastmaster, Hundra, Red Sonja, Kull the Conqueror, The Sword and the Sorcerer and Willow.\n\nWith mythological or Greek historical adventures being set out in films such as Jason and the Argonauts, 300 Spartans, Helen of Troy, Clash of the Titans, and more recently Troy and 300. Then there are movies like The Long Ships, The Vikings, and Prince Valiant. Maybe we should invent a genre to place all these movies in and call it Mythoadventurepeplumswords?\n\nAt least they would all be in one collective, and I would not have this headache. So, shall we go back to Roman tales? (yes, please lets). But, wait what about The Fall of the Roman Empire? (what about it?) is this not a Peplum?\n\nOk, lets go back to movies made in Italy by Italian filmmakers with Romans in them shall we. (ok touchy). Back to 1961, and to a movie directed by Sergio Corbucci, in which the sons of God Marte and Rea Silvia are dropped to the river Arno. They are breast-fed by a she-wolf and grow into Rómulo (Steve Reeves) and Remo (Gordon Scott). The siblings set out to establish the city of Roma and fight against the tyranny of dictator king Amulio who is the ruler from Alba-Longa.\n\nThe brothers then come to a parting of the ways as they lead their people toward the founding of a new city. Duel of the Titans, or Romulo e Remo, is a tale before the city of Rome is built, so where better to begin. The score was by Piero Piccioni and the music he penned was released on CAM records on LP and then later onto CD.\n\nA year later in 1962, Steve Reeves was back, as The Avenger or playing the lead in La leggenda di Enea, Reeves reprises his role as Aeneas, whom he previously played in the superb historical drama The Trojan Horse original title La Guerra di Troia which was released in 1961. Having survived the destruction of his city, the Trojan noble and a band of survivors have made their way to Italy, where they hope to create a new life for themselves.\n\nBut the region is already populated by various tribes, ruled by warlords, and Aeneas’s longing for peace cannot be accomplished without recourse to battle and bloodshed. The two movies were in my opinion serious attempts to make historical films, and the first did succeed, the second however was shall we say had a storyline that was elaborated upon for effect and to add more action scenarios to the plot.\n\nMusic for both of the movies was by Giovanni Fusco, who provided them with suitably epic sounding works, the wo scores were released onto CD in 2009 as a two-disc set by Digit Movies.\n\nActor Gordon Scott made his debut in the sword & sandal genre in 1961, Goliath and the Vampires, (see we are back onto Goliath etc again) is a fast-paced and action-packed affair, that is sometimes said to be co-directed by Sergio Corbucci (who also co-wrote it with Duccio Tessari), although this is something that is often questioned, with the main direction on the film being credited to Giacomo Gentilomo. The film contains some effective set pieces, which involve different worlds and creatures, and for a movie made in the early 1960’s it was at times quite gory. With some elements of the storyline still being utilised through to the mid 1980’s in other tales that came into the Peplum genre.\n\nI think that a Peplum certainly becomes more interesting when they contain horror and fantasy elements within the storyline, for example as in Mario Bava’s already mentioned, Hercules in the Haunted World’ or Goliath and the Dragon (which was Hercules, but I won’t start that debate again). Goliath and the Vampires, had the tag line See the Virgin Harem of the Vampire God, which was obviously applied when it was released in the States. Maciste’s village, (hang on where did he come from, it said Goliath on the poster)? Anyway, the central characters village is attacked by pirates. The women, including his fiancee Guja, are carried off to Salmanak, where the lair of the blood drinking Kobrak is located. So, Goliath, Hercules, or Maciste, (take your pick) vows to rescue them.\n\nThe effective score was by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino.\n\nA movie that is oft referred to as a Peplum is Atlas, but is it a true entry into the genre, as it was directed by Roger Corman, and scored by Ronald Stein. It was rare that the composer stepped into the Epic genre, and I think I am correct when I say that Atlas was in fact the only time he worked on this type of movie. Stein is probably better known for his work scoring Sci-Fi or even horror movies. The music for Atlas is a grand, sweeping, and brassy affair, with the composer creating a rich thematic tapestry that is coloured with a varying assortment of compositions that are cleverly orchestrated and arranged.\n\nThis is a work that can be likened more to the glory days of Hollywood as in Quo Vadis and probably more akin to the style of Rozsa, Newman and their like rather than the sound and styles created by composers such as, De Masi, Trovajoli, Lavagnino, and others who worked on the plethora of sword and sandal mini epics that were abundantly released via the Cinecitta studios during the 1960’s and 1970’s. Ronald Stein, fashioned placid and romantic sounding nuances that compliment and act as a respite from the more action led cues, with fanfares a plenty this is probably one of the best ‘Peplum’ or non-Peplum soundtracks (whichever way you look at it) that I have heard. To say that it is an imposing and entertaining work would be an understatement.\n\nFeared by Every Man, Loved by Every Woman, Behold the Mightiest Man Who Ever Lived.\n\nSo, forget Goliath, dismiss Hercules, and all the other strong men thus far mentioned, and enter another Adonis with super human strength. Released in 1961 Atlas, was looked upon initially as another addition to the ever-growing examples of the Italian made peplum movie, but looking closer one can see that this is although essentially a peplum, or at least having all the ingredients and look of this genre, is in fact something a little different. Filmed in Greece amongst the ruins of that ancient civilisation, it was directed by the King of the B movie Roger Corman.\n\nI think and this is just my own opinion, that maybe Corman had seen the success of the Italian made Sword and Sandal epics and decided that he could maybe produce something that resembled these, thus generating at least some of the box office attraction that they had amongst audiences worldwide. The film maker seizing the opportunity to imitate and attempt to do it better than the Italians or at least put a different slant upon things, in a very similar way that the Italians would do a few years later when they took the American western and transformed it into something fresh and vibrant, in the form of the Spaghetti western. Corman even played the part of a Greek soldier in the picture but was not credited, as did the screen writer on the movie Charles B. Griffith.\n\nThe film featured Michael Forest in the title role of Atlas, Forest was a busy actor, he is probably better known for his work behind the microphone as opposed to in front of the camera, providing English voice overs for a variety of Italian and European movies, but he also played small parts in numerous films that were successful at the box office during the 1960’s. Corman’s choice of location was always thought to be rather odd, with most of the action taking place amongst the ruins of Athens which for a movie that was supposedly set in a period when the ruins would have been buildings. In fact, Corman and Griffiths cleverly wrote into the script references to the ruins, with characters remarking that they had been at war so long that the ancient temples and cities had been destroyed. This may not have been a film that was Oscar material in any way, shape, or form, but it was a movie that was entertaining, which I suppose is the whole point of making movies and the action on screen was aided greatly by Ronald Stein’s sweeping and robust soundtrack.\n\nOk let’s go back to more mainstream Peplums shall we, enough of these rippling muscles and heroic type characters, (As I am feeling even more inadequate). When I say more mainstream, were any of the films in this genre mainstream? Colossus of Rhodes for example, which starred Rory Calhoun, as a Greek military hero named Darios, who travels to visit his uncle in Rhodes in the year 280 BC. Rhodes has just finished constructing an enormous colossus of Apollo to guard its harbour and is planning an alliance with Phoenicia which would be hostile to Greece.\n\nDarios flirts with the beautiful Diala (Lea Massari) daughter of the statue’s mastermind, while becoming involved with a group of rebels headed by Peliocles (Georges Marchel). These rebels seek to overthrow the tyrannical King Serse (Roberto Camardiel) as does Serse’s evil second-in-command, Thar (Conrado San Martin). The rebels’ revolt seems to fail, with Peliocles and his men being captured and forced to provide amusement in the local arena, but an earthquake eventually upsets, not only the Colossus in the harbour, but the balance of power in Rhodes as well.\n\nDirected by Sergio Leone, the film had a musical score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, who Leone would initially turn to and ask to write the music for A Fistful of Dollars, but finally working with Ennio Morricone.\n\nRome against Rome is another example of the Peplum which was re-titled War of the Zombies by AIP for American and UK distribution. So, more confusion, the film in its original form ran for just over 110 minutes, but the edited version for American and British audiences was cut down to 90 minutes, and had the worst dubbing I can recall, because of the editing and the terrible dubbing the storyline was lost altogether and it became a confusing and pathetic piece of cinema.\n\nThe music was by Roberto Nicolosi, who again provided a score that mixed symphonic colours with a flourish here and there of electronic scoring, that added a more mysterious air to the proceedings. It was not the best of the Peplum genre, and many have said it was probably one of the last films in the genre to be made.\n\nReleased in 1964 at the same time that the Italian western had firmly taken hold of audience’s attention, so the Peplum, epic, or sword and sandal adventure lost its appeal almost overnight. And non-Italian audiences deserted the toga clad heroes of Rome and Athens for the anti-heroes of the wild west as created by Leone, Corbucci and Sollima. This has been a brief look at the Peplum, and maybe it’s a subject I may return to at a later date, but for now let’s put the swords away and ditch the sandals."
