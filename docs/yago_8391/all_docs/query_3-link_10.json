        "text": "The Spring of Piera was a temple complex built around a natural spring of religious importance located within the depths of the Forgotten Swamps, west of the Sanctuary of Olympia in Elis, Greece.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn classical antiquity, the spring was where sixteen Elean women, tasked with organizing the Heraian games, sacrificed a pig and purified themselves in before the ceremonies.[1]\n\nThe spring led to a natural cave which was inhabited by bears. During the Peloponnesian War, the Spartan misthios Kassandra explored the place, finding one of the Ainigmata Ostraka within.[2] Around the same time, she met members of the cult of Hedone camping at the spring. They called the waterfall of the spring the \"Waterfall of Joy\", where the waterfall fell the \"Froth of Fantasy\", and the cave the \"Cave of Self-Knowledge\".[3]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAssassin's Creed: Odyssey"
