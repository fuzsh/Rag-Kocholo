        "text": "Hi everyone! I haven’t shared many TBRs this year because I haven’t been doing them. But next month is non-fiction November and I’ve been really into non-fiction this year so I thought I would participate.\n\nNon-fiction has become one of my favourite genres ever recently. I used to love it as a kid and then went off it, but I’m right back into it and loving it so much. I don’t know if I’ll exclusively read non-fiction next month, but I do want it to be the major genre I read.\n\nI am trying to work through my physical TBR this year, so I have four books from there I hope to read, plus two audiobooks I want to get to.\n\nDARK EMU BY BRUCE PASCOE ➤\n\nThis is probably the number one title I definitely want to read. Dark Emu is by an Aboriginal Australian historian, and Koori man. Dark Emu re-examines colonial accounts of Aboriginal Australia after the arrival of the First Fleet, attempting to use evidence to overturn the popular perception of Aboriginal people as a ‘hunter-gatherer’ culture by citing evidence of pre-colonial agriculture, engineering and building construction by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This book is very popular in Australia right now and I really need to read it!\n\nH IS FOR HAWK BY HELEN MACDONALD ➤\n\nThis is admittedly one of those books I’m reading because\n\neveryone says its good. This is a memoir about Helen Macdonald and her experience raising a Hawk after her father passes away. So many people say this is one of the best non-fiction books of all time so I’m excited to see what I think of it.\n\nFIRE AND FURY: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wollf ➤\n\nThis was THE book in 2018 and I never read it then but I think I might finally read it this month. I just feel like this is one of those books ~you need to read~.\n\nDEPENDS WHAT YOU MEAN BY EXTREMIST BY JOHN SAFRAN ➤\n\nAnother Australian non-fiction, this is about John Safran, who is Jewish, and his investigation into Australia’s alt-right movement. It follows his experience going to alt-right rallies and discusses the kinds of people who attend them, and how Australia perceives the alt-right in comparison to how they perceive themselves. I’ve heard a lot about this book and I’m interested to see what it’s like.\n\nTHE GENE BY SIDDHARTHA MUKHERJEE ➤\n\nI told myself I’ll read this book for non-fiction last year and I didn’t get to it so I hope I do this year. I bought the audiobook for this so I can work through that. This is, as the title suggests, about the gene and how humans came to understand the importance and role of gene’s within the population. I really like detailed histories like this so I think I should love this book.\n\nKNOW MY NAME BY CHANEL MILLER ➤\n\nThe final book in my list is also a must-read and one I have on audiobook. This is Chanel Miller’s memoir, who was the unnamed victim in the Brock Turner case. I’ve been meaning to read this for a long time, I’ve heard it’s incredibly powerful but also horrifically sad. But to me this is an important book to read.\n\nThat is my TBR for non-fiction November! Honestly this is a lot of books to get through but we will see how it goes! If you’re participating in Non-Fiction November I would love to hear about your TBR and what you plan on reading.\n\nuntil next time!\n\nHi everyone! Welcome back. You may or may not notice I took a little impromptu two month hiatus. I’ve been so busy with starting a new job as well as super focussing on my writing. At the same time, I hit a massive reading slump which meant I hadn’t read much and therefore didn’t have a lot to talk about. But I’m finally starting to get my reading groove back, and with it comes my desire to blog and talk about books. So I’ve decided to do a little recap of the past few months and walk you through some things I’ve been reading and watching and what I’ve been up to, hope you enjoy!\n\nAUGUST\n\nThe major point of August is that I got a new job! I unfortunately lost my old job due to Coronavirus, but I’m really happy to have a new position now. I was super busy in August, working a lot and having to learn a lot of new things for my job, so I didn’t so much else at all, unfortunately. Although, it was my best friends birthday which was a lot of fun, and my football team (Australian Rules football this is, not soccer), had a bit of a form patch in August which was nice, because honestly my team (Fremantle, yes Australian’s you can point and laugh) don’t win that many games 😭\n\nBut I did watch THE UMBRELLA ACADEMY, SEASON TWO which I enjoyed so much. I think this series has such great characters and I liked season two a lot more than season one. I also watched 3%, season three. Which is a really underrated Netflix show set in a future, apocalyptic Brazil with dystopian elements. I love it a lot, especially since season three gave me CANON SAPPHICS.\n\nIn terms of reading, I read LAURA DEAN KEEPS BREAKING UP WITH ME in August which I loved. It was so beautifully illustrated and I enjoyed the story so much. I feel like we need more books talking about how lgbtq+ relationships can be toxic without the narrative implying lgbtq+ people themselves are inherently toxic because of their sexuality, and I think this graphic novel did a great job of that.\n\nFor most of the month I was working on reading STAMPED FROM THE BEGINNING: THE DEFINITIVE HISTORY OF RACIST IDEAS IN AMERICA by Ibram X. Kendi which was excellent. It’s non-fiction that is both incredibly informative whilst also being easy to follow and well-structured. I am so glad I read this and I honestly think it is a /must read/.\n\nI also read THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL by Anne Bronte, which I enjoyed a lot. I finally read THE MARTIAN by Andy Weir, like 6 years after the hype. I thought it was alright, maybe a little too long and the main character too imperfect but it was fun. Finally I read PRINCESS BARI by Hwang Sok-Yong which is a translated South Korean novel about North Korean refugees with fantasy elements. I liked the writing a lot, as well as the portion set in North Korea. Hwang Sok-Yong lived in North Korea illegally for some time so the book encapsulates some of his memories of the country, especially during the Cold War.\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nIn September I tried to do the Letterboxd Scavenger Hunt, which is a challenge where you need to watch 30 movies that fit within 30 random prompts assigned to you. I failed the challenge, as I always do, but I did see some movies I liked. I finally watched SAMSON AND DELILAH which is a classic Australian movie featuring a romance between two Aboriginal kids by an Aboriginal filmmaker. The movie is mostly spoken in Warlpiri, an Indigenous dialect, which I thought was really cool.\n\nI also saw Christoper Nolan’s TENET in the cinemas which I had been so highly anticipating. I enjoyed it a lot, probably not as much as Inception which is shares similarities with, but I still liked it a lot.\n\nOther movies I saw included THE OLD GUARD, which I loved for it’s representation. The immortal gay husbands live in my mind rent free. I watched KNOCK DOWN THE HOUSE, a documentary about grassroots politics in the United States. I also saw KILL BILL finally, and HUSTLERS which I missed in 2019.\n\nBut my favourite thing I saw was definitely PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE ! It’s a French film with a lesbian romance and I LOVED IT SO MUCH. It’s beautifully shot, beautifully acted with such lovely thematic exploration and quotes that actually made me ache (Do all lovers feel they are inventing something? IM FERAL)\n\nIn terms of TV, I got obsessed for a second with OUTER BANKS on Netflix. My friend told me it gives ‘Teen Wolf: Season one vibes’ which basically means it’s extremely cringy and bad but also excellent and entertaining. I can definitely back that up. This TV show is insane and makes no sense and was kinda cringy but I loved watching it so much it was so entertaining.\n\nI also finally watched FLEABAG and oh my god I loved it so much. Fleabag is all about grief and family and regret and god I just adored it so fucking much. It’s also actually laugh out loud funny. Phoebe Waller Bridge is a genius, that is all I have to say.\n\nI also started to get back into reading in September.\n\nI finally read Ronan Farrow’s CATCH AND KILL: LIES, SPIES AND THE CONSPIRACY TO PROTECT PREDATORS which is about the Harvey Weinstein investigation. This was excellent and I really am glad I finally read it.\n\nI reread THE GILDED WOLVES which is one of my favourites ever (review here!) and then read THE SILVERED SERPENTS arc I had which is the sequel. I didn’t like the sequel AS much but I still really liked it a lot and I cannot wait for book three.\n\nI also read THE LAKE HOUSE by Kate Morton which has been on my physical TBR for so long so it felt nice to finally get to it. The last book I read was TERRA NULLIUS by Claire G. Coleman. Terra Nullius is an Australian science-fiction novel by an Aboriginal author. This book kinda didn’t work for me because it relies on a plot twist I figured out early because of seeing a spoiler review , but I did still like bits of it.\n\nOCTOBER (SO FAR)\n\nI’ve been trying to focus on reading in October. I finished CHAIN OF GOLD by Cassandra Clare, another book that had been on my physical TBR a long time. I didn’t like it as much as her previous books, but it was still entertaining so I gave it three stars.\n\nI also finished two audiobooks, BLANCA & ROJA by Anna-Marie McLemore and BOYFRIEND MATERIAL by Alexis Hall. I love Anna-Marie McLemore and think they write such stunning books, and I think this one just pipped Wild Beauty as my favourite of their books. Boyfriend Material is a contemporary romance with the fake dating trope which was a lot of fun. Romance isn’t a genre that always gets me particularly invested or moved but all I ask if I have fun which I did with this one.\n\nI’m currently reading FOUR BOOKS which is a lot. The first is OVER NINE WAVES, which is a book of Irish legends I picked up in Dublin. The second is HIZBU’LLAH: POLITICS AND RELIGION for a book club I’m in where we read Political Science texts. I’m reading THE MOONSTONE, which is a classic mystery novel written in 1868 as part of #Victober and finally, I just started IMAGINARY FRIEND by Stephen Chbosky which I’ve owned for so long and never got to.\n\nIn terms of movies, I watched Enola Holmes which was very sweet. I also finally got around to watching Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) which was a lot of fun and had such a great performance from Margot Robbie. Finally, I have been trying to watch movies from around the world so I decided to watch a 2019 film from Kosovo, Aga’s House. This was a very slow-moving movie but I loved the way it was filmed, the characters felt extremely authentic and the representation of women was excellent, especially since it looked at the effect of the Kosovan War on women, specifically, which is often overlooked.\n\nThat is my little recap of what I’ve been up to. I know it’s a little messy and long-winded but I hope it gives a little snapshot. I’m starting to plan out content for this blog again so I hope to properly be back soon. I’d love to hear what you thought of anything I’ve been reading/watching if you have too, and what you were up to the past few months.\n\nuntil next time!\n\nHi all ! I decided to do a ~controversial post~ today and talk about some popular books I won’t be reading (probably). Some of these are out and some aren’t, but all of them are books I’ve seen a lot of people hyping up and I just – have no interest in reading! There’s so many of these for me, especially given how much I’m not into YA lately, but I decided to pick out ten books I think super popular right now that I have no interest in reading.\n\n➤ Twilight / Midnight Sun by Stephanie Meyer\n\nBetter get the big one out the way first. With Midnight Sun coming out, it feels like Twilight is back on and I’ll just… never read this. Allll the problematic elements aside, this still interests me absolutely zero percent. I don’t really get into vampire novels, and even reading this for ~content~ which a lot of people seem to do honestly doesn’t appeal to me, just seems annoying. I’m so content skipping the Twilight phase\n\n➤ Throne of Glass of Sarah J. Maas\n\nThis series cops so much flack and yet it still has a lot of die-hard fans and gets recommended to me ALL THE TIME. I’ve read the first book but I know I’ll never ever continue. First of all, it’s so long to dedicate my time to. Second, I really didn’t like book one and third, I’ve heard so many bad things about the later books from actual fans of this series who liked the earlier books. So there’s no way I’d spend my time on this when I could read other things.\n\n➤ A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas\n\nFor similar reasons as above, I really don’t have any interest in reading Sarah J. Maas. I did hear the second book of this series is good, but they’re really long and I really don’t think I’d ever pick this up over the hundreds of other books on my TBR.\n\n➤ Call Down the Hawk by Maggie Stiefvater\n\nThis one might be ~controversial~. I love The Raven Boys and still reread and enjoy it. But I don’t think I’ll be continuing with the series when this new book comes out. I’m torn because Adam Parrish is my fave boy, but ultimately I don’t think this series needed more. But the major reason is that I don’t want to support Maggie Stiefvater anymore (for a multitude of reasons). Also, the cover is literally hideous, which I’ve interpreted as a sign from the universe to not buy this. I’ll probably just read a spoiler review of this so I know what happens to Adam and leave it at that.\n\n➤ A Curse So Dark and Lonely by Brigid Kemmerer\n\nThis is a more recent book but a lot of people seem to be reading and loving it lately. It’s been recommended to me a few times, but I’ve come to a realisation recently – I really don’t like retellings. There are a few exceptions but generally, they aren’t my thing. I also am just not interested in this, so as much as it keeps coming across my Goodreads and Twitter I don’t think I’ll be reading it.\n\n➤ Serpent & Dove by Shelby Mahurin\n\nEvery one is reading this lately, mostly for it’s enemies to lovers content. I’ve seen it described as Nina/Matthias fanfiction which.. I kinda hate Nina and Matthias as a couple. This is one of those hit or miss books and I just feel like I’ll land in the HATE IT camp. So even though a lot of people keep telling me to read it, I don’t think I will be.\n\n➤ My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell\n\nA lot of people are talking about this one right now, but it’s subject matter just does not interest me at all. I can see why a lot of people are into this book and are interested in how it deals with it’s topic, plus explores its themes, but the things it explores are just not ones I care about reading myself, even though I think this book is doing something important.\n\n➤ Nevernight by Jay Kristoff\n\nPeople endlessly recommend this to me and I just….. don’t care. First, I don’t care for the author and find the way he tweets and some things he has said to be extremely off-putting and problematic. But mostly, the entire concept of this book just doesn’t appeal to me. I hate books with footnotes and told about one person from the POV of another. Also, the tropes/archetypes of the main character are ones that just don’t really appeal to me, I just don’t ever find ‘one girl has to be super badass/hard’ to be a compelling character arc. Finally, I watched the series starring Piera Forde on YouTube and although it was cool, it didn’t interest me enough to pick the book up.\n\n➤ My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Otessa Moshfegh\n\nAnother adult literary book I’ve heard people rave about endlessly but the premise just…. does not interest me at all. I actually originally thought this was non-fiction and was more interested in reading it then than I am now finding out it’s a novel. I have heard so many people describe this book and talk about it and it never, ever makes me want to actually read this.\n\n➤ Educated by Tara Westover\n\nThis book originally interested me for it’s premise. I thought a memoir about growing up in a cult would definitely be interesting. But ultimately hearing more and more people talk about this, I’m less inclined to pick it up. I kinda feel like its been talked to death and know every thing that happens in it. There was also some problematic elements that were called out which kinda put me off picking it up.\n\nAre there any popular books you have no interest in reading, have you read any of these, or think you won’t ever read them like me? I would love to hear in the comments.\n\nuntil next time!\n\nHi everyone ! The past few days my braincells have been focussed on one thing and one thing only, and that is Taylor Swift’s new album, ‘folklore’. I’ve been a dedicated and passionate Swiftie since I was about 13, and if you follow my twitter you know I talk about her … a lot a lot. So I was THRILLED, SHOCKED, BAMBOOZLED when she announced out of nowhere she was dropping an album that day. What a twist I did not have on my 2020 bingo card !!\n\nI am in love with this album, and after seeing people do this tag I thought I better do the same, because what better way to combine two things I love.\n\nBefore I start, let me just say: the top three songs are ‘august’, ‘cardigan’ and ‘invisible string’ ARGUE WITH THE WALL. Okay, now let’s get into the tag\n\nLink to the original creator: Ilsa @ A Whisper Of Ink\n\nTag at least 3 people.\n\nDeclare the rules and list of prompts in your post\n\nThank whoever who tagged you and link to their post.\n\nThe 1 definitely is one of my favourite songs of the album. It is so beautifully written and sung, makes me feel nostalgic, and is a perfect intro to this album.\n\nFor this prompt, I had to choose The Last Magician by Lisa Maxwell which was the first book that came to mind. The ending of this blew my MIND, so much happens so quickly and when I finished it I literally just put it down and started at the ceiling because there was much to think about. This is such such an underrated historical fantasy I love it so much.\n\nThis song is SO SO amazing I genuinely get chills every time I listen to it. the way she sings ‘but I knew everything when I was young’, plus the ‘I knew you’d miss me once the thrill expired / And you’d be standin’ in my front porch light / and you’d come back to me’ makes me WILD with emotion I love it so much. It reminds of me This Love and basically makes me lose my mind each time I hear it.\n\nSome people might think this is a bit of a strange choice but .. okay, this song gives me the exact same feeling that listening to ‘Ribs’ by Lorde does. It’s a very particular mix of happy memories, sad nostalgia and I feel both happy and sad reading it. I feel like i had such a different response to this book then most people, but it really got me for it’s mix of fluff and fun and … hard hitting nostalgia. The quotes about love, friendship and change as you grow up, those hit hard !!\n\nI love story telling songs so I really like this one. The cheeky way says Fifty years is a long time / Holiday House sat quietly on that beach / Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits / And then it was bought by me. it’s so funny, I love Taylor Swift owning her reputation\n\nFor this prompt, I’m going to go with throwback to one of my favourite fictions of last year. Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is a memoir by a therapist, talking in part by her own therapy after she gets broken up with, and in part about her own patients she was treating and their stories. It’s about how therapy works and helps people. I found this so so fascinating, both the authors story and the stories of her patients, as well as the discussion around therapy methodology and how it helps. It’s also extremely well written and will get you super invested.\n\nExile is one of my mid-tier songs from this album but I really do love the sound of the duet between Bon Iver and Taylor Swift and the end when the drums hit.\n\nFor this prompt I chose the biggest flop of the year, All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. I honestly just didn’t gain a single thing out of this book, like there was books I disliked just as much but at least they had original concepts. This was just boring, it’s honestly EVERY trope and story about world war two you’ve read about before. I wish I had just dnf’ed this or unhauled it instead of wasting my time reading it and finishing it waiting for it to get good.\n\nTHIS SONG IS ABOUT THE REPUTATION ERA CHANGE MY MIND. Which actually makes me sad because reputation is my favourite Taylor Swift album.\n\nI rarely cry in books, I don’t know why I just don’t get affected that way. But one book which actually made me SOB was The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. I was listening to this on a bus trip and I had to stare out the window and put my hoodie up and hope no one noticed that I was BALLING. I love this book so much purely for giving me that reaction because I don’t have it too often.\n\nFor this prompt I definitely think Radio Silence by Alice Oseman. I identify with Francis, the main character, so much and the entire themes, vibe and ideas in this book just match so well with my life. Everything about this book just feels like it was written for me like it’s my ideal story type, character dynamics (platonic best friends!!), it’s got a dark vibe, it’s about making art and friendship. Like every specific thing I am always looking for in YA contemporary.\n\nI feel like I don’t need to explain why, by far, the most nostalgic book/series for me Harry Potter. I know a lot of people feel the same. I’m trying not to talk about Harry Potter much on my public socials for many reasons but, I cannot really answer this question with anything else it IS my childhood nostalgia book\n\nBEST SONG ON THE ALBUM !!! BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!! an instant classic. the bridge!!!! gets me every single damn time\n\nThis is a hard prompt for me because I don’t really associate books with seasons or read certain books in certain seasons like some people do. In the end I chose an Australian books because, I think Australia just had the best summer. I kinda went with the ultimate Aussie book in Cloudstreet by Tim Winton. This book is set in Western Australia, and deals a lot with the water and beach and the Australian summer, so I definitely associate it a lot with summer in Australia. Tim Winton is a very popular Australian novelist but this is honestly the only book of his I’ve read that I liked.\n\nThe first book that came to mind was Clap When You Land which definitely fits, but I decided I would go for We Are Okay instead because that book deals with those themes in such an intense way. We Are Okay is about a girl staying in her dorm over the holiday break and her ex-girlfriend coming to visit, and it’s just about …. loneliness, sadness and grief. It’s such a beautifully written, emotional book and I love it so much.\n\nSometimes books that are bad are also the best book you’ve ever read in terms of like, entertaining attention-grabbing content and thats The Foxhole Court for me. I read this entire trilogy in less than 48 hours and then could literally not do or think about anything else for weeks later. It was incredible. Even though I would tell people to approach this series with a healthy amount of scepticism, the book hangover it gave me was legendary.\n\nThis song is an absolutely underrated classic. It’s SO CUTE, very classic Taylor Swift song writing and makes me smile every time I hear it.\n\nFor this I am definitely going to have to go with Simon Vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda. I think I’ve talked about this before but, this is a book I read right when I was considering coming out as bisexual and it really helped me at the time. I remember sitting in my bed crying my eyes out at the scene where Simon comes out to Abby in his car. Although this is a book I don’t love as much now, it definitely is one that held a lot of importance to me at the time.\n\nAnother iconic smackdown song by Taylor Swift, I love the lyrics and all the subtle little story moments from her past she included in this.\n\nOf course there’s soo many I could do for this one, I even have a twitter thread of some of my favourite female characters. But owing to the ‘mad woman’ title I decided to go with Adelina Amouteru from The Young Elites. Years since I read this book and I still stan her and her villain arc SO MUCH. Honestly, her ‘well everyone treated me badly maybe I’ll treat them badly back’ energy really fits with this song.\n\nI definitely have to go with the book that has HAUNTED ME ALL YEAR and choose On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong. So many things about this are haunting. The themes deal with feeling haunted by the past, the narration stuck with me, as did the story, and the writing itself, like the literal Lexical Choices are also haunting, they are worth reading and staring at. I love this book so much.\n\nthe way this song through me in a full ‘is taylor swift coming out’ loop because I missed the “””its from a males POV””” anyway I’m just saying taylor swifts tendency to be like ‘girls are so pretty and amazing I was in love with one and wished I had kissed her’ (he said) is interesting\n\nFor this prompt, I am choosing Laila and Severin from The Gilded Wolves. You may think it’s a strange couple because they aren’t even together but… I LOVE FRIENDS TO LOVERS. AND I LOVE ‘WE GOT TOGETHER ONCE IT WAS A MISTAKE EXCEPT WE BOTH SECRETLY THINK IT WASN’T’. The yearning is intense, off the damn page, and I love them so much.\n\nSo many so many but I have to go with Emma Carstairs from Lady Midnight I love her so much like she deserved the entire world and I don’t even care that the fandom dislikes her she IS that bitch. She’s funny, badass, but has a lot of emotional depth and complexity, and I love her relationships in this series. A queen and a legend.\n\nI definitely have to go with Wolfsong by T.J Klune for this one. I put this book on my five star TBR predictions list and thought I would love it because everyone does and it was… soo meh. I really hated the romance and the writing style, and overall just found this so boring. I really don’t get how people loved it so much and rated it five stars.\n\nI loved this tag so much, and I love this album so much. Thank you to Ilsa for putting it together. If you’ve listened to this album, then I’m tagging you! I would love to see what everyone else comes up with for these prompts.\n\nuntil next time\n\nSummary:\n\nmy rating: 4 stars\n\npublished: 2020 by Wednesday Books\n\ngenres: contemporary, lgbtq+ fiction, young adult, romance\n\ncontent warnings: depictions of cancer, public outing, fatphobia, homophobia/lesbophobia/biphobia, off-page death\n\nSynopsis:\n\nWill Tavares is the dream summer fling―he’s fun, affectionate, kind―but just when Ollie thinks he’s found his Happily Ever After, summer vacation ends and Will stops texting Ollie back. Now Ollie is one prince short of his fairy tale ending, and to complicate the fairy tale further, a family emergency sees Ollie uprooted and enrolled at a new school across the country. Which he minds a little less when he realizes it’s the same school Will goes to…except Ollie finds that the sweet, comfortably queer guy he knew from summer isn’t the same one attending Collinswood High. This Will is a class clown, closeted―and, to be honest, a bit of a jerk.\n\nOllie has no intention of pining after a guy who clearly isn’t ready for a relationship, especially since this new, bro-y jock version of Will seems to go from hot to cold every other week. But then Will starts “coincidentally” popping up in every area of Ollie’s life, from music class to the lunch table, and Ollie finds his resolve weakening.\n\n❝ It’ll get easier. That’s the beautiful thing about the universe. It puts you through trials, but it never gives you anything you can’t handle. We grow from these things. ❞\n\nI received this book from Hatchette Australia, though it had been on my radar way before they sent it to me. Only Mostly Devastated is a Grease inspired YA contemporary. After Ollie and Will spend the summer together, they vow to keep in touch. But Will ghosts Ollie, and when Ollie unknowingly transfers to Will’s school, Will refuses to acknowledge him or their summer. The two are stuck in an impossible situation, Will isn’t ready to come out yet, Ollie doesn’t want to have a secret relationship, and they they both still have feelings for one another.\n\nIn many ways, this could have been a lot like many queer YA contemporary I have read before. Themes around being publicly out and dating in school are common. But Only Mostly Devastating dealt with many of it’s queer themes in a way that was refreshing in it’s complexity, and it’s willingness to give space for the main characters to mess up, apologise, and do better.\n\nOnly Mostly Devastated is both a very lighthearted read, and simultaneously quite dark at times. The way Will and Ollie treat each other is often harmful, they make mistakes and deeply hurt each other over and over. This book allows the characters to experience a range of messy emotions and experiences, and exercise those emotions in ways that are not always one hundred percent positive and healthy. But I liked this messiness of this book, I liked that it allowed it’s characters space to mess up and grow, and was compassionate in it’s treatment of both characters situation. There’s also a subplot involving one of Ollie’s family members, who has cancer. This plotline added another element of darkness that for me makes this not necessarily a straight-forward fluffy romcom.\n\n❝ Maybe our Happily Ever After hadn’t worked on the first shot. And maybe Happily Ever Afters weren’t a singular event. Maybe they were something you had to work at, and build, and never give up on, as long as they were something you still wanted ❞\n\nI enjoyed the use of perspective and narrator in Only Mostly Devastated. You all KNOW how much I love a little clever use of unreliable narrator. Not that I would call Ollie unreliable in the typical sense, but this book is firmly in his perspective, and I liked how it pulled you along for the ride. In ways, this book had hints of Adam Silvera in how it uses narrator to depict other characters in select and oftentimes unfair lights. I also really liked how the book addressed this, pulling back from Ollie’s perspective to allow the reader to see from a different point of view. I thought Gonzales managed to draw the reader into Ollie’s perspective, convince you of it’s reality, and then destroy this reality in a really effective way.\n\nThere is also a plot line about a bisexual female character in this book I LOVED. It’s also very messy, depicting a girl who ‘kisses other girls to please men’, which, is a bit of a controversial bisexuality topic. But I thought it was handled really well, and I identified with the bisexual character quite a lot. I think showing imperfect representations of bisexuality is really important, as is reinforcing the validity of exploring your sexuality.\n\n❝ I fled. I fled like a bigot dodging the concept of equality. ❞\n\nAs for criticisms again, once again I am complaining about the first person narration. I feel I have had to write this for so many books lately, but I just hate this perspective. Admittedly, it was used well here, so I give it half a pass, but in general I still find fourth wall breaks and first person style narration a little cringey at times. It’s just something I will never enjoy and something that always pulls me out the story, especially if I don’t find the main character funny (which I didn’t really in this books)\n\nI also thought the start was a little slow, taking about one hundred pages to really get going which is unfortunate in such a short book. However, the book did make up for this because it really grabbed me after the first third, so it’s not a major issue.\n\nIn some cases, I might have rated this book a three star because of the slow start and writing style, but ultimately, I enjoyed the gay and bi representation so much and the depiction of messy teenagers in a positive way that I decided to bump it up to a four star.\n\n❝ Apathy is incompatible with hate. Love works okay. ❞\n\nOverall, Only Mostly Devastated is a neat little queer YA contemporary that offered something new to a genre which can sometimes feel repetitive to me. People who enjoy Adam Silvera for his messy depictions of characters and relationships will probably find something to like in this book. It’s a book that can often be dark, but has such a beautiful and uplifting end which positive affirmations and themes, and I really loved that about it so much. Books like this make me happy and excited for queer young adults, and the representation they will be able to find of their lives and identities within the books they pick up.\n\nuntil next time!\n\nHello everyone! I really wanted to do a recommendation post, but couldn’t think of something to theme it on. Then I came up with this idea.\n\nSo if you don’t know, Wikipedia has the ability to generate a random article. Which obviously, can be on absolutely anything. So I decided today to base my recommendations on random wikipedia articles I generated. I made it a rule that no matter what five came up, I had to use them, so this was quite a challenge for me.\n\nI’ve generate five articles to recommend a book based off of, so let’s get into it.\n\n1: 1998 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship\n\nThis is an annual basketball event held in Africa. Unfortunately, I haven’t read any books about basketball, but I have read some sport books in general, which I used for these prompt.\n\nI ultimately recommend RUNNING WITH LIONS by Julian Winters. This is a book about soccer, following a under 18s team at summer camp. There is also an important championship match in this book. There is a diverse cast and found family tropes. This book is a lot of fun and has an m/m friends to enemies to lovers romance as the central relationship.\n\n2: Atrial Branches of Coronary Arteries\n\nThe atrial branch of coronary arteries deliver blood to the heart. I decided to choose a book that deals with the heart as an organ/in a medical sense (rather than say, romantic)\n\nFor this wikipedia entry I am recommending TIN HEART by Shivan Plozza. Tin Heart is an Australian young adult contemporary novel. The main character is the recipient of a heart donation that saves her life. The book deals with Marlowe’s desire to contact her donor’s family, even though they don’t want to meet her, and discusses living with congenital heart disease as a young person. This is a really unique YA novel and I think a lot of people would really enjoy it for it’s complex main character and original premise.\n\n3: Magatama\n\nMagatama (勾玉, less frequently 曲玉) are curved, comma-shaped beads that appeared in prehistoric Japan from the Final Jōmon period through the Kofun period, approximately ca. 1000 BCE to the sixth century CE.\n\nThis was a hard prompt for me to recommend off. I don’t have any books about prehistoric Japan, magatama or curved, comma-shaped beads. In the end, I chose THE SWORD OF KAIGEN for this prompt. This is a military fantasy based on historical Japan. I chose it for it’s historical elements and it’s Japanese setting. This is a really unique fantasy, it has elemental magic and the main character is a mother, which is something so rare but appreciated in adult fantasy. The rarity some elements of this book kind of match the rarity of magatama ???\n\n4: School Life (2019 film)\n\nSchool Life (French: La Vie scolaire) is a 2019 French critically acclaimed award winning teen comedy drama film. It follows a group of teenagers disillusioned by a world that seems to have turned it’s back on them.\n\nIt is unfortunate I have no YA contemporary books set in France for this one. There are a lot of YA contemporaries that could fit with a group of teenagers feeling disillusioned with the world. Utimately though, I decided to go with one that has a teen comedy vibe like this movie and choose HERETICS ANONYMOUS by Katie Henry. This is about a group of teenagers at a catholic school who feel the administration doesn’t care about them and has turned their back on them. It has a large cast who start carrying out pranks to point out the hypocrisy of their school and to be honest, the world, and it’s really funny.\n\n5: Kennet and Avon Canal\n\nThe Kennet and Avon Canal is a waterway in southern England with an overall length of 87 miles (140 km), made up of two lengths of navigable river linked by a canal.\n\nFor this, I decided to continue on with the idea of waterways and canals and recommend DART by Alice Oswald. Dart is a longform poem, told from multiple perspectives, all of which relate to the river Dart in England. The river, ferryman, water nixies, dead man and more speak to narrate the story of the river and its importance in English countryside. Kennet and Avon Canal is an important waterway, and similarly, Dart talks about the importance of that river in England historically, it’s current state, and the future of the river.\n\nThis was A LOT harder than I expected. It took me literally weeks to write this post because I had to think about each entry that came up for so long. But it was also super fun and I hope you enjoyed reading this post and my recommendations. I would love to hear what you would have recommended for each of these wikiedpia entries\n\nuntil next time!\n\nSummary:\n\nmy rating: 5 stars\n\npublished: 2018 by Hogarth Press\n\ngenres: literary fiction, contemporary fiction, Irish fiction\n\ncontent warnings: depictions of abuse, assault, suicide, depression\n\nSynopsis:\n\nConnell and Marianne grow up in the same small town in rural Ireland. The similarities end there; they are from very different worlds. When they both earn places at Trinity College in Dublin, a connection that has grown between them lasts long into the following years.\n\nThis is an exquisite love story about how a person can change another person’s life – a simple yet profound realisation that unfolds beautifully over the course of the novel. It tells us how difficult it is to talk about how we feel and it tells us – blazingly – about cycles of domination, legitimacy and privilege. Alternating menace with overwhelming tenderness, Sally Rooney’s second novel breathes fiction with new life.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: This is not a spoiler free review, it is more a discussion of the text and it’s themes. It therefore may contain some light spoilers.\n\n❝ He brought her goodness like a gift and now it belongs to her. Meanwhile his life opens out before him in all directions at once. They’ve done a lot of good for each other. Really, she thinks, really. People can really change one another. ❞\n\nNormal People is my first foray into Sally Rooney’s work, despite hearing a lot about her. I can tell you now it will not be my last foray, because I absolutely loved this book. Rooney’s writing is whip-smart, funny, and not afraid to show the simultaneous tenderness and heartbreak that comes with loving someone, exposing your vulnerabilities to them, over and over again, and having someone know you so intimately well they have the power to change you.\n\nNormal People revolves around Connell and Marianne, who attend the same school in rural Ireland. Connell is popular and sporty, but he’s also poor. Marianne is unpopular and disliked, but she’s from a wealthy family. Hence, the tension between them. Connell’s mother is Marianne’s family cleaner. Eventually the two start dating, but keep it a secret. Connell does not want people to know about his mum being a cleaner, or to have people judge him for dating Marianne. Outside of school they are desperately in love, within school, Connell won’t even acknowledge her.\n\n❝ Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it ❞\n\nThis disparity in wealth, privilege and power plays out throughout the rest of the book. Through their relationship, power tips from one to the other while Marianne and Connell desperately try to meet on solid ground in the middle. The way power fluctuates between them is almost comical at times, Rooney shaping dramatic scenes and moments that would be unbelievable except they’re really not. Rooney is clever, able to sharply curb her writing so that it never becomes too melodramatic. In a way she reminds me of Austen, in her ability to perfectly satirise and simultaneously dissect class and wealth disparities.\n\nRooney’s writing is young and fresh, and her much revered millennial voice really stood out to me. I enjoyed the dialogue in this, the way the characters speak felt authentically young. They are politically aware, cynical, and ensconced in the bubble of academia. I recognised these characters, even as some of them made me cringe.\n\nThe most bold choice, stylistically, is the removal of all dialogue tags. I liked that too. You get the sense in this book nothing that is said was possibly said the way the character thinks it was – not that these characters are unreliable in the typical sense, but like most people, they aren’t wholly reliable either. Dialogue reads like it’s slipping loose from the tongue, like each character on the page only thought up what they said five minutes ago.\n\n❝ It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about ❞\n\nRooney interrogates modern relationships and how they are at the mercy of modern discourses. Casual dating, love under capitalism and the importance of politics and value alignment within relationships. Rooney also teases out disparities in class and wealth within Ireland, contrasting rural and city living, working class and wealthy families, and examining the levels of privilege and wealth that breed within universities, specifically Trinity College with it’s illustrious reputation and famous alumni.\n\nRooney is a marxist, who has spoken about how her politics affect her writing often. The influence was evident; class differences and power imbalance as a result of privilege and wealth is put to the forefront frequently within this book. It forms the central complication between Connell and Marianne, time after time. The flow of social capital, and how people can use their social capital to the benefit or detriment of others is also a prevalent theme of the book.\n\nBut Rooney also presents the benefit of sharing our resources. Marianne and Connell’s relationship metaphorically demonstrates the value of social marxism. At different times, they both have things the other needs. Instead of helping, they withhold, and it drives them apart. It is when Marianne and Connell are finally able to meet on solid ground, when each one is having their needs met by the distribution of resources from one to the other they finally are complete, and not only that – they flourish. This is evidenced in Marianne’s final thoughts ‘They’ve done a lot of good for each other. Really, she thinks, really. People can really change one another‘.\n\nThis was such a beautiful summation of this book, and this relationship. People really can change one another, and sometimes someone can offer you the exact thing you need. This, I feel, is the entire thesis of Rooney’s book. That sometimes you meet people who greatly improves your life, by offering you exactly what you need. Rooney also asks, what if we extended this to society, what if wealth, class and more could be transcended or solved by the sharing of resources, for the satisfaction of needs, even if it is only amongst friends. To use the Marxist phrase; to each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.\n\n❝ It’s not like this with other people, she says. Yeah, he says. I know. ❞\n\nI feel like I have just scratched the surface of all the things I can talk about in this book. Which is just another strength. Rooney wrote a beautiful, humanising story about love and relationships and how two people can profoundly impact each other over a life time. But she also wrote a clever book that tackles love under capitalism, the frustration of the modern generation (whether valid or not), and the growing gap between rich and poor. Rooney is able to embed these issues so neatly within her story, teasing out parallels between our world, the the world of the central couple. The book works because both it functions so smoothly on these two levels.\n\nI hugely enjoyed this book, and I cannot wait to read Conversations with Friends. Rooney truly is the new millennial voice I’ll be watching out for. If that makes me a cliche, caught up with the most recent trend, then so be it."
