        "text": "Hey Yaâ€™ll!\n\nThis is my spoiler-free review of Nevernight by Jay Kristoff. This is the third book in recent months that Iâ€™ve read because of Piera Forde. Iâ€™m coming to accept her recommendations as gospel. This book has amazing humor, awesome stabby-vibes, some maneuvering the likes of which I did not expect, and surprisingly well-written smutty scenes that I was HERE FOR. The only reason I ended up dropping it to four stars is because while this was an awesome book, I never really connected with any of the characters on an emotional level, and for me thatâ€™s a necessity to a five star read.\n\nGoodreads Review and Updates\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family.\n\nDaughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her fatherâ€™s failed rebellion with her life. Alone and friendless, she hides in a city built from the bones of a dead god, hunted by the Senate and her fatherâ€™s former comrades. But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer, and a future she never imagined.\n\nNow, Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republicâ€”the Red Church. If she bests her fellow students in contests of steel, poison and the subtle arts, sheâ€™ll be inducted among the Blades of the Lady of Blessed Murder, and one step closer to the vengeance she desires. But a killer is loose within the Churchâ€™s halls, the bloody secrets of Miaâ€™s past return to haunt her, and a plot to bring down the entire congregation is unfolding in the shadows she so loves.\n\nWill she even survive to initiation, let alone have her revenge?\n\nDescription via Goodreads.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nSo I donâ€™t know if it was just the mood I was in when I was reading this or what it was but I just could not connect to any of the characters. I mean maybe it was just the back of my brain protecting my heart from almost certain death when one of the characters dies (because itâ€™s obvious before even reading the book that SOMEONE is going to die). I donâ€™t know. Maybe it was because I feel like so many bad things were happening to people around Mia but never to Mia herself? I feel like I wanted her to personally go through some shit, you know? I just was riding the struggle bus with the characters on this one.\n\nThe reveal regarding Mia specifically near the end of the book was predictable, in my opinion. There are so many hints beforehand and I honestly donâ€™t know how more people donâ€™t guess ahead of time. HOWEVER, the reveal concerning the traitorous little FUCKS at the actual end of the book I was not expecting at all, and I am NOT COOL with the Cassius thing.\n\nI will say that I definitely got what I was looking for when it came to the stabby vibes. I went into this book ready to read about a savage little bean and that is definitely what I got. I mean DAMN, Mia has some serious balls. As for Mia, I really wasnâ€™t expecting her to have as much of a conscience as she did. I donâ€™t know, I was expecting her to be like an unfeeling killer and I got someone so S O F T and Iâ€™m not even mad about it. I canâ€™t wait to see how she fucks things up in the next book and I feel really bad for her enemies.\n\nI also got MORE than i was expecting when I got to the smut in the book. I donâ€™t know why no one ever talks about this in their review because I probably would have read it sooner had I known there were smutty scenes.\n\nI think besides the not being able to connect to the characters, the other reason I only gave it four stars is because I feel like this entire book was just building up to whatever is going to happen in Godsgrave (which I still need to read). I always have trouble with first books because I feel like a lot of the time theyâ€™re setting up for future books and thereâ€™s more information dumping than there is connecting, you know? I think the fact that I took the time to read every single footnote didnâ€™t help this. My suggestion to first time readers is to ignore the footnotes. I promise you, not reading them will not make you miss vital information, it might actually add to your reading the story because I think half of what made me guess the Mia reveal was contained in the footnotes. You can always go back through and read the footnotes later ðŸ™‚\n\nThe character Tric is a sweet little bean and the fact that he falls in love with Mia after she explains why sheâ€™d rather be called a cunt than any other insult made me practically fall off the couch laughing. Tric is at the Red Church to gain a little revenge of his own, and his backstory makes it very obvious that he has a grudge to bear and that heâ€™s motivated and a little prideful. Tricâ€™s story is, I think, pretty powerful and I donâ€™t know how I feel about what happens with him by the end of the story. I think Iâ€™m hoping that itâ€™s not true and it gets fixed in Godsgrave (desperately trying to avoid spoilers here, so sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense).\n\nI donâ€™t really have much else to say, so here are some of my thoughts that might be spoiler-y if I put them into context (so I wonâ€™t):\n\n*Miaâ€™s poor, poor arm\n\n*sassy shadow pet(s)\n\n*Everyone dies. No one is safe\n\n*Traitorous biatch (you know who I mean)\n\n*Tric. Everything about him.\n\nVerdict: read it.\n\nI feel like Iâ€™ve been flopping back and forth between 4 and 5 stars, and writing this review has me all hyped and wondering if I should bump it back up to five ;D Anyway, Iâ€™m really glad you all sticked around for this review, and I hope to see you on my next post.â™¥"
