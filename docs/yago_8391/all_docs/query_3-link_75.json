        "text": "August 22, 2013\n\nOne of life's greatest pleasures is discovering a book that is unknown and yet turns out to be a memorable read! This book about an Italian family in the 1920's (till present day) totally grabbed my attention and did not let go until the last word! A fascinating read and one that I will never forget. I enjoyed Piera's (the older sister of this clan) retelling of her family's story to her nephew Davide after her brother's body is found murdered when the whole family thought Vito had fled to Argentina to evade his debts. It is a gripping, heart wrenching tale of family secrets, of what people do to maintain their honour and what people do to survive loss, heartache and desire. A must read...seriously!!!\n\nNovember 29, 2010\n\nA dark but compelling combination of mystery and family drama. Solitaria tells the emotional story of several generations of an impoverished - first, literally and later, spiritually - italian family. The story is set in both contemporary southern Italy - declining and old-fashioned, yet timeless, full of la dolce vita and bittersweet roman continuity - and in the mid 20th century decades of the past, complete with period descriptions of devastating fascism and post-war renewal.\n\nThe present is narrated by Canadian university professor David, who has traveled to Italy with his opera singer mother to deal with the discovery of the gun-shot body of his uncle, Vito, who had been missing since the 1950s. The family's various quirky siblings travel from around Italy and the globe to converge at the home of their reclusive, difficult and bitter, self-appointed matriarch and eldest sister, Pieta. Pieta is the only family member who knows the circumstances of Vito's murder, but she is not willing to speak of it to anyone except her long-lost nephew David. The family history of the 1903s to the 1960s is recounted to David in poetic, beautifully written flashbacks narrated by Pieta.\n\nIn some books frequent flashbacks can become annoying, but in Solitaria they were very well done, perhaps because they were tied together with so many beautiful and insightful observations about memory. Pieta, for all her out-of-touchness, is pitch perfect when she speaks of the flexibility of truth and untruth in emotional memory, the all-too familiar and realistic way that siblings can recall the exact same childhood situation drastically differently, and the ways that families come apart, drift away, and then come back together again.\n\n***Potential spoiler below this lovely and vaguely relevant picture of the Tuscan countryside taken from a bell tower in San Gimignano during my first visit to Italy***\n\nSolitaria does contain themes of incest, so perhaps may not be a book for the faint of heart, younger readers or those looking for a light, fluffy read. I felt that the mature themes were handled with sensitivity and intelligence, but if incest is something that bothers or upsets you too much to read about, then you may want to find another book. This one is really beautiful though, so give it a try if you can keep an open mind!\n\nEdit: Oops, I almost forgot to disclose that I won this book in a goodreads giveaway contest!\n\nJanuary 1, 2011\n\nI received this book as a first read and was very excited to receive it. Thank you to the author for the book and the opportunity to read it.\n\nThe beginning of this book was a little difficult but the story picked up its pace as the book progressed. The story itself was fantastic and the ending came as a shock to me. I love a twist ending. I think, for me, the difficulty was in the overly descriptive way that the book was written. It wasn't a book that I could lose myself in and forget the world around me. It was more a book that I felt I had to work at. Furthermore, a great deal of the book contained Italian phrases which, although fit the storyline well, made the book more difficult to read effortlessly. I think the author had a wonderful premise and is clearly a very talented writer. However, for me, this book was more work that I usually like to have when reading for pleasure.\n\nDecember 25, 2010\n\nA solid 4.5 stars & I'm rounding up. Excellent story & characters that drew me into their lives. The only problem for me was that the ending seemed a bit abrupt. It's a good thing though when you don't want to give up the people, but would like to know what happens next.\n\n12/20/10 - Started this one this morning & it already looks to be very good!\n\nI won this book in a First Reads giveaway. I look forward to reading it.\n\nSeptember 15, 2021\n\nSpannend met een verrassend einde; een boek dat ik moeilijk weg kon leggen en het liefste in een keer uitlas.\n\nWel vond ik de personages stuk voor stuk wat negatief aangelegd. Veel sarcasme, achterdocht, kinderlijke jaloezie en nijd, maar ook het gevoel dat ze elkaar net zoveel haatten als dat ze elkaar nodig hadden en voor elkaar wilden zorgen.\n\nEn wat is dat toch met je eigen familie aantrekkelijk vinden?\n\nFebruary 15, 2012\n\nOriginally posted on Across the Litoverse\n\nTo protect familial honour, the truth can be buried—but one must know that secrets never die. When a demolition crew unearths Vito Santoro's remains at an Italian seaside villa, his sister Piera locks her door against the accusations and anger of her extended family. Following Vito's disappearance fifty years earlier, Piera insisted she received regular correspondence from her eldest brother after he settled in Argentina. His former wife, Teresa, was left to raise their infant son, Marco, under Piera's iron rule without knowing that Vito was, in fact, dead. As forensics teams investigate Vito's mysterious death, the five remaining Santoro siblings and Teresa demand answers from Piera; however, the self-proclaimed matriarch will only open her door to her Canadian-born nephew, David, who she entrusts with a scrapbook detailing her youth and the circumstances leading up to Vito's disappearance.\n\nBut the Santoros are rife with their own resentments, conflicting desires, and bitter feuds—at times, her siblings' stories undercut and complicate Piera's narrative to the point where no one can be trusted. David, as an outsider and an academic, possesses the tools needed to uncover the unnamed familial shame strangling his family, but the cost proves higher than anticipated…\n\nGenni Gunn's Solitaria marked an excellent addition to the 2011 Scotiabank Giller Prize Longlist for its complex tussling over family honour and personal sacrifice, its staggering portrayals of guilt/shame shared between siblings, and its poetic exploration of a multigenerational mystery within a gorgeous Italian landscape. I do love it when narrators are unreliable and, in the case of Piera and her siblings, the reader learns that each tale contains mere shards of the truth, and that a storyteller does little more than reflect their own biases concerning the past.\n\nGunn offers a well-crafted literary mystery populated with deceptive, complex characters circling around an explosive revelation that will keep readers riveted until the last page.\n\nIdeal for: Mystery readers who like a clean shot of the literary in their fiction; Folks looking for a captivating, poetic Canadian novel; Readers who love a gorgeous Italian backdrop; Kids keen on cruising through the 2011 Giller Prize Longlist.\n\nFebruary 16, 2016\n\nAt an abandoned villa in Fregene, Italy, a seaside town on the Adriatic near Bari, a work crew accidentally unearths a body. Tests identified the gun-shot riddled body as that of Vito Santoro, a man presumed immigrated to Argentina decades earlier, and missing since the 1950 19s. The news rocks the Santoro family. As the family gathers from all corners of the world, its matriarch, Piera, locks herself in her room and refuses to speak to anyone other than her nephew, David, from Canada. She is the only one who knows the circumstances surrounding Vit 19s death. To David, Piera slowly begins to reveal the family secrets of the past.\n\nWith flashbacks to post-war Italy, David learns about the hard luck life of the Santoro family 13 the unfaithful father, a mother in the throes of depression, and of their children, each of whom struggles towards adulthood desirous of their own needs. Slowly, through Piera and David 19s conversation, he learns the darkest of family secrets, about love a love unrequited, and his true bloodlines.\n\nThis story captivates the reader from the very first pages. Told, with vividness and emotion, while being rich in its simplicity and ripe with emotion, this dark mystery unfolds slowly, entrancing the reader, luring them to its shocking ending. The novel explores poverty and human failure, vice and love, incest and death. It is a deeply intellectual story, moving but fulfilling.\n\nThe author, Genni Gunn, is of Italian roots, having been born in Trieste and having travelled extensively throughout Italy. Therefore, readers can be assured of the authentic Italian feel within the story concerning cultural and historical issues of the time. Ms. Gunn has been a finalist for the prestigious CBC Literary Awards, has published nine books: three novels, including Tracing Iris, which is being made into a film, and numerous short stories and poetry collections, one of which was a finalist for the Gerald Lampert Award. But, her talents do not end there. The author has also produced an opera, Alternate Visions, which premiered in Montreal in 2007. Her poem, 1CHot Summer Nights, 1D was turned into classical vocal music and has been widely performed all over the world.

Piera, the main character, is wonderful - well-intentioned in a way that only the narcissistic can be, poignant, very badly behaved, holding secrets and keys that are always subject to subjectivity. She is nicely counterpointed by her too dispassionate though affectionate nephew from Canada, the only person to whom she will reveal the key to the mystery - the story behind a body uncovered during renovations of a house on the Italian coast - the oldest brother in a family of 7. The story of the family is absorbing - I could see every two room house by the railway tracks among the scrub, the menace of the tracks nearby, the kids slightly out of control, the tired but very sexual parents. The writing is clear, lively, evocative. The structure with the discovery of the body and then taking the whole novel to reveal what happened worked beautifully ' I never felt manipulated and always just impatient enough. Gunn does a good job of describing the grinding poverty rural Italians experienced during and after World War II, often having only bread and wild dandelions with a teaspoon of oil to get by on. This is a world where sibling rivalry and resentment is much more real than the thin layer of expected familial love we project on the image screen we turn outward. Absorbing, pleasureable, intriguing.\n\nNovember 11, 2012\n\nI'm no literary buff or great lover of realistic fiction (actually I swing more to the opposite side of the spectrum), but I really liked this book. The scenes of Italy are captivating as is Piera's story of her childhood which is pretty much the only force moving the book's plot forward. Compounded with big personality's and lots of family drama, this book though not riotously captivating, is subtly thought provoking and occasionally disturbing.\n\nLikes: Italian phrases, use of tenses (though sometimes awkward), beautiful description, great charaterization for Piera and Vito.\n\nDislikes: repetive parts underlined for importance (artifacts and glass) or faulty editing, some characters are one-dimensional, climax wasn't a climax (it was easy to guess the outcome from the onset), the resolution was short and sweet but lacking some depth in David's grand revelation.\n\nRating: 4 stars\n\nI'll probably read this again when I'm older, to see if the story changed for me. It probably will.\n\nDecember 18, 2012\n\nA dark and mysterious story of family love, betrayal and the secrets we bury in the past. The scenes of Italy are beautiful and so richly crafted that one feels as though they are on the train peering out at the historic landscape alongside the characters. The sweeping mystery is slowly revealed in short passages constructed around letters and photographs by a most unrelaible narrator, which leave the reader guessing as to the truth and motivation behind each revelation. It is refreshing to read a mystery they leaves the reader to fill in the blanks and decide the truth for themselves. A highly enjoyable read."
