Jaco Pastorius, John Francis Anthony Pastorius III (Norristown, Pennsylvania, December 1, 1951 – Fort Lauderdale, Florida, September 21, 1987), was an American jazz bassist.

In Pastorius‘ own words, his main musical influences were: “James Brown, The Beatles, Miles Davis, and Stravinsky, in that order.” In addition to these, Jaco cites other names like Jerry Jemmott, James Jamerson, Paul Chambers, Harvey Brooks, Tony Bennett, Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, and mentions with special attention the name of Lucas Cottle, an unknown New Zealand bass player who has some recordings next to Pastorius.
