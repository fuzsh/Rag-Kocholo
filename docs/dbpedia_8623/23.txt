Jaco Pastorius made quite the lasting impression during his relatively short music career; active from 1966 until his passing in 1987, he became known for his distinctive tone arising from his DIY de-fretted bass guitar and bright, melodic style of playing that incorporated extended techniques like harmonics, as well as a heavy funk influence. His now-iconic ‘Bass of Doom’ is one of the most recognisable electric instruments among bassists, even prompting Fender to remake a tribute model right down to sealing the fretboard in epoxy resin.

Prior to the recording of his debut album, while attending a Weather Report show he reportedly introduced himself to the band’s frontman Joe Zawinul as “John Francis Pastorius III, the greatest bass player in the world”, a bold approach that impressed Zawinul enough into asking for a demo tape and ultimately hiring him for bass duties in Weather Report. In between playing and recording for Weather Report, Jaco also found time to record a small handful of solo records, though to relatively poor commercial success despite the amount of critical praise he received.

His life was fraught with difficulties arising from his drug addictions and what was later diagnosed as bipolar disorder, and as a result he lived homeless for much of the final years of his life, finding it hard to hold down a job. Despite this, right up until his death in 1987 at the age of 35, Jaco was (and still is) praised as one of the most consistently skilful electric bassists and remains a go-to inspiration for many aspiring jazz and funk players alike.
