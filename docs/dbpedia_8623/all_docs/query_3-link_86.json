        "text": "John \"Jaco\" Pastorius III was an American bassist, composer and producer well-respected in the jazz world, particularly the jazz fusion movement of the 1970s and 1980s, as a virtuoso of the electric bass. He recorded as both a solo artist and as a member of the renowned band Weather Report (1976 - 1981). He also collaborated with artists such as Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny and Joni Mitchell.\n\nThough he passed away at the young age of 35 and therefore had a relatively short career over the course only 10-15 years, Jaco is still widely regarded today as one of the best bassists of all time, specifically of the electric bass. His style of playing incorporated elements of funk, lyrical solos, bass chords, and innovative harmonics. More than just a technical master of his instrument, his musicianship propelled the compositions that he played on to new heights and new directions, forever changing the landscape of music and influencing all who heard him.\n\nJaco's approach to the bass and the music he wrote continues to be a wellspring of inspiration for a great many musicians and listeners alike. He's left an indelible mark on the continuum of musicianship, including with some of our very own New Orleans musicians; Louisiana native drummer Ricky Sebastian played drums with Pastorius for several years, and New Orleans based bassist Pat Casey has been so influenced by Jaco's craft that he began hosting annual tribute concerts to the late bass master in 2016, nearly 30 years after his death.\n\nTonight, join us for what promises to be an incredible evening of supreme musicianship and expansive exploration with the return of Pat Casey's Tribute to Jaco Pastorius, featuring:\n\nPat Casey - bass\n\nRicky Seabastian - drums\n\nOscar Rossignoli - piano\n\nBrad Walker - saxophones\n\nShows at 7:30pm & 9:30pm\n\nDoors at 7:00pm & 9:00pm\n\nRestaurant is Open 5pm - 11pm for dinner before or after your showtime:\n\nAdvance Ticket Holders can now automatically make dinner table reservations for the Dining Room online via OpenTable.com\n\nAdvance Ticket-Holders can also make table reservations for dinner by Emailing reservations@snugjazz.com after your tickets have been purchased online by forwarding your E-ticket confirmation with dinner request info.
