Pastorius was trying to enter the Midnight Bottle Club in Wilton Manors, Florida, (where he’d been banned), and became involved in a fight with a bouncer, Pastorius fell into a coma and was put on life support. In 2006, Pastorius was voted “The Greatest Bass Player Who Has Ever Lived” by readers in Bass Guitar magazine. Pastorius was a member of Weather Report and worked with various acts including Joni Mitchell, Pat Matheny and Herbie Hancock. Watch his band’s performance at the Montreal Jazz Fest in 1982."
