        "text": "Not all visitors to Fort Lauderdale make their way up Dixie Highway. Those who do are often paying homage to one of the greatest bass players ever – Jaco Pastorius.\n\nBefore we go any further, let’s listen to him in action. This is from 1978.\n\nJaco wasn’t born here in Fort Lauderdale but nevertheless considered himself a South Floridian (and Broward County local). He grew up, and was educated, in the Oakland Park area of the city, where the park now stands.\n\nSadly, he died here in Fort Lauderdale too at the age of only 35 – in an altercation with a bouncer at a Wilton Manors club\n\nPosthumously, in 2006, Bass Guitar Magazine officially declared him the ‘Greatest Bass Player Who Has Ever Lived.’\n\nJaco Pastorius Park opened in December 2008 and the video below shows the park (and its murals) plus Jaco’s son, Julius.\n\nJackie\n\nJJ is originally from the UK and has lived in South Florida since 1994. She is the founder and editor of JAQUO Magazine. You can connect with her using the social media icons below."
