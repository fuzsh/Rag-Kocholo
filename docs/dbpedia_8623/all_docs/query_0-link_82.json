        "text": "So I discovered Jaco this year. It was surreal... Who is this guy that everyone keeps talking about? The greatest bass player ever? What? What about Victor Wooten? Oh, Victor looked up to this Jaco? What?!?!\n\nSo a couple things after diving into his music and being absolutely blown away.\n\n-Get a good tone, and stick with it.\n\n-Modulation can distract from being creative with your playing, a lot of the time you don't need it!\n\n-Music is much broader and complex than originally understood.\n\n-Don't limit yourself, Jaco played in bands for years of every style, and took a little from each one, musically.\n\n-Jazz is cool.\n\nI couldn't helped but be moved by his tragic and early death. Especially the brutal way that he died that night at the hands of a martial artist bouncer, who didn't know how to stop before it was too late... A life lesson that I gathered about family is that we need family more than everything else, and the fact that Jaco was estranged from 2 beautiful families is, in my mind, what drove him over the edge so to speak.. He needed to be with them and live life with them.. The road killed him!\n\nAny thoughts on Jaco?\n\nLove Jaco.\n\nI'm not sure now what all but I know I learned stuff from his playing and interviews.\n\nHarmonics on bass in particular, but that learning technique stuff is just a little side benefit compared to his musicianship and musical contributions to our community.\n\nThe mental health stuff is tragically awful, how big he was compared to how little help he got when he really needed it.\n\nA reminder that when we see others suffering with those problems we might need to go out of our way to help them.\n\nMight have to drag them to a hospital even if they protest.\n\nAnd maybe it's a reminder to not condemn those who struggle with substance abuse and erratic behavior, since those could be signs a person is bad, or maybe signs a person is sick.\n\nSomeone commented about this, saying in so many words, \"where were all those friends of his, those jazz musicians??\". Where were all the people who benefited from his enormous talent... As soon as he fell off the radar, he was abandoned by every single one of them..\n\nPerhaps he burned those bridges, but it makes me upset that he had noone that could have let him couch surf for a while until he cleaned his act up..\n\nFor goodness sake, he could have joined any band in the world, or made his own and been a millionaire... Maybe the failure of his project \"Word of Mouth\", financially, with the big record label was enough to dishearten him permanently.\n\nMaybe he was travelling down a path that he devised on his own, in his depression and mental anguish, and before it was too late to turn back, he was destroyed...\n\nI met Jaco when I was 19, after a Weather Report concert in Gainesville, Florida. It was his first tour with them; he wasn't famous yet, but we had all heard of him: the word was out, at least in Florida.\n\nHe went to a bar with me and a friend and spent two hours talking to us. It changed my life; he talked me into leaving journalism school and coming to Miami to study music. (Was it a great idea? Maybe not... ))\n\nThe next time I saw him was a couple of years later, in Ft. Lauderdale. He remembered my name, a kid he had met just once a couple of years before. That's how he was.\n\nThen I wound up playing calypso with a bunch of steel drummers, one of who was Othello, a good friend of Jaco's. He started showing up at our gigs, and was always cool and encouraging, even though I was just banging out Yellow Bird and Matilda on the bass pans.\n\nI met Tracy once and Ingrid once, but didn't know either. They both were very nice; Tracy made a joke about how when Jaco was mad at her he would play Portrait of Tracy with the distortion turned up on his Acoustic 360. (Anyone who ever had one of those knows how that sounded...))\n\nAfter I moved to the West Coast in 1980 I never saw him again. He had begun drinking and getting high, but I missed the whole trip down and only heard about the New York period second hand.\n\nThere's this: I've seen a lot of great musicians in my life, but I've never seen anyone better than Jaco. He was one of kind.\n\nIt really hurt when he was killed and it still does.\n\nSomeone commented about this, saying in so many words, \"where were all those friends of his, those jazz musicians??\". Where were all the people who benefited from his enormous talent... As soon as he fell off the radar, he was abandoned by every single one of them..\n\nPerhaps he burned those bridges, but it makes me upset that he had noone that could have let him couch surf for a while until he cleaned his act up..\n\nFor goodness sake, he could have joined any band in the world, or made his own and been a millionaire... Maybe the failure of his project \"Word of Mouth\", financially, with the big record label was enough to dishearten him permanently.\n\nMaybe he was travelling down a path that he devised on his own, in his depression and mental anguish, and before it was too late to turn back, he was destroyed...\n\nMany here know I'm in 12 step recovery, was a street level junkie in NYC, suicidal etc.\n\nHelping me was frustrating/ heartbreaking/ impossible until I was willing.\n\nBystanders/ friends/ family, are unprepared for being the middle man between the sick and the doctors.\n\nAll the reasons that could be listed, reasons in the sick persons head, none of them really matter. Just excuses.\n\nAlmost like shopping for gear expecting it will make us play better, same as needing medical help for mental illness and making lists of why it's the wrong time or whatever. Different consequences, but similarly meaningless excuses for putting off what's needed most in favor of what's not needed at all.\n\nI don't blame his friends and associates, though the fact remains that something could have been done, it's just harder than even most medical professionals can manage.\n\nMusicians are in a hard hit community.\n\nWe can carry his history as a reminder to be kind to the seeming crazies.\n\nThey did not choose that for themselves.\n\nAnyone who knows someone in that sort of shape can go to a hospital and ask to talk to maybe a social worker or a psych nurse about getting a patient admitted for psych eval. If there's substance abuse involved you can call an AA or NA hotline and explain, sometimes they can have a few members do a 12 step call and just talk with the person, sometimes peer recognition sparks hope, or a few understanding folks can cajole the sick person into a trip to the ER for eval.\n\nMight sound nuts but I've done this sort of thing. Many of us in 12 step recovery were once where Jaco breathed his last breaths, and would go to the ends of the earth to pull a peer back from the brink.\n\nWe are all so damn tired of watching friends die, many of whom are sensitive creative kind people.\n\nThere's also Alanon and Naranon, programs for families of drug and alcohol abusers. They can help family help family, where often those closest are the worst helpers, and need some training in not guilt tripping or placing expectations etc.\n\nThe thing with mental illnesses like bipolar disorder and depression is that sufferers tend to self medicate, so they fit right in to 12 step programs which are full of similar folks, but who got a combo of medical and peer support along with the 12 steps and etc etc.\n\nAnyhow, back to his gifts!\n\nNot all lives are long lives but Jaco brought a lot in his short run..."
