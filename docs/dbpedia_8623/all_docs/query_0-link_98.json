        "text": "My review of the unearthed archival find, Jaco Pastorius' Truth, Liberty & Soul Live In New York: The Complete NPR Recording, today at All About Jazz.\n\nThese days, there's a plethora of recordings, originally made for radio or television broadcast, being released by labels ranging from thoroughly legit to highly suspect. In some instances, these are real archival finds; true gold, mined from hours of hours of recordings, lovingly restored and packaged. In other cases they're clearly nothing but money grabs. Capitalizing on old contracts with holes in them the size of a Mack truck, these cheaply packaged, sonically acceptable but far from stellar releases muddy the waters for labels that look to do it right: gain all the proper permissions; ensure that a percentage of the proceeds go to the artist (or estate, in the case of those no longer alive); do everything possible to bring the sound (and, where applicable, video) as close to 21st century standards as possible; and artfully package them, with booklets containing informative liner notes, photos and other memorabilia.\n\nAmongst some of the better independent labels handling archival finds the right way are ECM, Cuneiform, MoonJune, Panegyric...and Resonance Records, the non-profit American label whose small but important discography of unearthed finds by legendary jazz artists ranging from Bill Evans and Wes Montgomery to Larry Young and Sarah Vaughan has been nothing short of exemplary, demonstrating how it should be done and setting a suitably high bar for others to follow, especially in the jazz world. With the release of Truth, Liberty & Soul Live in New York: The Complete NPR Jazz Alive! Recording, the label has truly outdone itself: not only bringing a stellar live performance of electric fretless bass phenom Jaco Pastorius' out-of-the-park June 27, 1982 performance at Avery Fisher Hall, with his 22-piece Word of Mouth Big Band-- first aired on the American public radio network's Jazz Alive! program--into long-overdue commercial release, it does so in what has become the characteristically thorough and signature Resonance Records way.\n\nNot only does this deluxe package include a 100-page booklet containing articles, interviews and testimonials from various people, ranging from Word of Mouth band musicians including drummer Peter Erskine, trumpeter Randy Brecker, reed multi-instrumentalist Bob Mintzer and steel pans master Othello Molineaux, to fellow bassists, NPR folks involved in the original broadcast (including original recording/mixing engineer Paul Blakemore, who also remixed the original multi-tracks for this release), Jaco biographer Bill Milkowski, childhood friend Bob Bobbing and many more, along with photos and relevant historic memorabilia; it also includes a full forty minutes of music making its very first appearance here, having apparently managed to escape the hands of bootleggers over the decades.\n\nContinue reading here..."
