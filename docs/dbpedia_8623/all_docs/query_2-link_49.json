        "meta_description": "This story of a musician hailed as a genius and dismissed as a madman will appeal to anyone intrigued by the fine line between creative inspiration and insanity. Jaco looks deep inside the life and music of this talented but tormented bass player who revolutionized his instrument and became one of the most potent forces in modern music. Like his heroes Charlie Parker and Jimi Hendrix, Jaco didn't make it to age 40. But by the time he died at 35, the music world was indebted to him. Jaco had reinvented the role of the electric bass - playing melodies, chords, harmonics and percussive effects simultaneously, and bridging the gaps between jazz, classical, R&amp;B, rock, reggae, pop, and punk.The life story of the man who revolutionized the electric bass is an in-depth look at a tormented genius who achieved international fame and died tragically at a young age.",
