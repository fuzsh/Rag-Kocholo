        "text": "Jaco is one of the most tragic and yet inspiring stories in the history of modern music. Any artist who was fortunate enough to share the stage with this legend will tell you that Jaco radiated music without even trying. Every thought, every movement, every impulse he had, created a singular sound, groove and feeling the world of music just couldnâ€™t get enough of.\n\nFrom his time coming up through the club-bands of South Florida, to his groundbreaking work with the seminal fusion band Weather Report, Jaco changed the way people thought of bass. The very moment he picked up that instrument, Jaco raised the bar and, for the first time, made the electric bass guitar a true centerpiece. Never again would the bass be just a supporting instrument. This was Coltrane come back to life with strings instead of reeds.\n\nBefore his untimely demise, Jaco changed not just the world of bass, but the world of music. He will long be remembered as a virtuosic bass player, arranger, bandleader and the inspiration for generations of musicians, new and old."
