        "text": "Jaco Pastorius\n\nHailed as the greatest electric bassist in the world. Jaco restructured the function of the bass guitar in music. He was truly unprecedented, performing audacious technical feats. Jaco played both fluid grooves and hornlike solos with equal virtuosity and incorporated harmonics into his playing as an additional musical tool. He is best known for his work with jazz-fusion group Weather Report and as a solo artist. Signature Tunes include \"Donna Lee\" and \"Teen Town\"."
