        "text": "Born: December 1st, 1951, Norristown, Pennsylvania\n\nDied: September 21st, 1987, Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n\nJaco Pastorius was an American jazz fusion bassist revered not only for his incredible technical ability but for his funky sixteenth note grooves and beautifully melodic phrases and solos. He was a true innovator on bass and is regarded by most as one of the most influential bassists of all time.\n\nBorn John Francis Pastorius III on December 1, 1951, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Jaco displayed an early passion for music, taking up the drums at an early age before eventually settling on the electric bass. In his teenage years, Jaco played bass with Wayne Cochran & The C.C. Riders.\n\nPastorius famously began playing on an upright bass which eventually couldn’t hold up to Florida’s humidity and cracked. JAco then purchased a brand new 1966 Fender Jazz Bass at the age of 15 with the money he had saved. At the age of 21, he acquired a 1962 Fender Jazz Bass which would eventually become known as the “Bass of Doom”. Jaco eventually removed all of the frets from the bass (some say with a butterknife) and then coated the fretboard with epoxy resin. This new fretless sound, utilizing the bridge pickup of the bass only, would become his signature sound and one of the most emulated by bass players around the globe.\n\nJaco was a bass teacher at the University of Miami in the early 1970’s where he met and befriended guitarist Pat Metheny. In 1974, the pair recorded an untitled album with pianist Paul Bley and drummer Bruce Ditmas. The album would later become known as “Jaco”.\n\nPastorius gained prominence in the 1970s as a member of Weather Report, a pioneering jazz fusion band. His virtuostic bass playing, characterized by intricate melodic lines, harmonics, and a unique fretless sound, set him apart from his contemporaries. His groundbreaking work on albums like “Heavy Weather” (1977) showcased his ability to push the boundaries of traditional jazz and incorporate elements of funk and rock into the genre.\n\nJaco’s eponymous debut solo album, “Jaco Pastorius” (1976), solidified his reputation as a solo artist. The album featured a blend of original compositions and re-imagined standards, highlighting Pastorius’s exceptional skills as a composer and arranger. His composition “Portrait of Tracy” from this album became a bass showcase and a testament to his innovative use of harmonics. Bassist Victor Wooten once explained that he learned everything he knows about harmonics from spending an entire night learning “Portrait of Tracy” as a young musician. The album featured a host of jazz giants including Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, David Sanborn and Lenny White as well as R&B/Soul duo Sam & Dave.\n\nDespite his musical genius, Jaco Pastorius faced personal challenges, including struggles with mental health and substance abuse. These issues eventually took a toll on his career and personal life. His erratic behaviour led to strained relationships with bandmates and collaborators, leading to his departure from Weather Report in the early 1980s.\n\nTragically, Pastorius’s life was cut short on September 21, 1987, when he died at the age of 35 after a confrontation with a nightclub bouncer in Florida. His untimely death marked the end of a brilliant but tumultuous career. Jaco Pastorius was a living example of the very fine line between genius and madness and his legacy endures through his groundbreaking contributions to the bass guitar and his influence on countless musicians across genres. He is remembered not only for his technical prowess but also for his ability to infuse emotion and creativity into his music, and for his pure love and joy for making beautiful music on the fretless bass."
