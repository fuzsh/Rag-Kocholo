        "text": "Jaco Pastorius, the man who revolutionized how the bass guitar is played and who is, for many, the best and most influential bass guitarist ever, was a student of The Urantia Book which inspired his world famous musical hit song Havona!\n\nIn the very active years of 1974 and 1975, Jaco communicated with Joe Zawinul, leader of jazz fusion band Weather Report. Upon meeting Zawinul after a 1974 Weather Report gig, Jaco introduced himself by calling himself “the greatest bass player in the world.” Zawinul didn’t bite that time out, but after receiving an early mix of Jaco’s solo album, he decided to call on the bassist when Weather Report needed a bass player in late 1975. Jaco joined the group and remained in Weather Report through 1981, displaying both incredible musicianship and onstage showmanship. He was also a famed session player, most notably appearing on Joni Mitchell’s Hejira (1976) and Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter (1977). In Mark Bego’s biography Joni Mitchell, the legendary singer-songwriter comments on her musical connection with Jaco: “In a way, I feel like I dreamed Jaco. I mean, he was exactly what I was waiting for, sonically. . . .”\n\nJaco lives on through his legacy. There aren’t any other like him, and every bass player is in one or another way influenced by him…\n\nTo learn more about Jaco’s life, go here: http://jacopastorius.com/life/, and to stay in touch with Jaco’s family, go here: https://www.facebook.com/jacopastorius\n\nVideos from Jaco Pastorius"
