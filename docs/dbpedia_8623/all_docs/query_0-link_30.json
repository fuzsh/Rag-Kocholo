        "text": "Jaco’s magnum opus represents the realization of the promise that he showed on his 1976 self-titled debut. During those five years in between recordings, he accelerated his development as electric bass phenom and enthralling concert attraction in Weather Report, the premier fusion band of the day. While challenging dominant leader and synth maestro Joe Zawinul on a nightly basis, Jaco also brought to the band such memorable tunes as “Teen Town,” “Havona,” and “Punk Jazz.” Word of Mouth was crafted on a much larger canvas than any of Jaco’s previous works, more beholden to Stravinsky and Bach than James Brown and Wayne Cochran. And while his bass virtuosity is apparent on Bach’s “Chromatic Fantasy,” the Beatles’ “Blackbird,” and his cathartic “Crisis,” it’s the gorgeous orchestral rendering of his poignant waltz, “Three Views of a Secret,” the suite-like “John and Mary,” and the jaunty “Liberty City” that most impress here. Guest soloists include Michael Brecker, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Toots Thielemans. Originally released in July of 1981, Word of Mouth was Jaco’s first post-Weather Report album. Now reissued as a 180-gram vinyl pressing with glossy covers and heavyweight gatefold jacket, it more than stands the test of time."
