        "text": "Artist: ELLA FITZGERALD\n\nFormat: LP\n\nBar-code: 5060348583042\n\nCat No: NOTLP304\n\n£13.99\n\nElla Fitzgerald made her mark in the worlds of jazz and scat, and during the Big Band era was collaborating with the likes of Louis Jordan, Count Basie and Louis Armstrong. But it was in the 1950’s that she really made her mark, with a series of ‘Songbook’ albums spotlighting all the great songwriters of the day. It’s been said that Ella’s unique interpretations delivered with a voice so rich it was like cream in your coffee. Small wonder then that she’d take a ground-breaking approach when it came to recording an album of Christmas songs. Ella’s Christmas album was revolutionary in that it wasn’t about Christmas in the traditional sense and would go on to influence pretty much every Christmas album since, for two reasons: It’s really joyful, and it really swings.\n\nWISHES YOU A SWINGING CHRISTMAS (180G GOLD VINYL LP) quantity\n\nSide One\n\n1.
