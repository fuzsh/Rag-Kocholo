        "text": "For the longest time, my favorite film was Spielberg's E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.\n\nThat was until 12:01am on December 19, 2001.\n\nAfter a long wait in line I finally got to my seat in the Sony Metreon IMAX Theater in downtown San Francisco to witness what many critics had claimed to be impossible for almost fifty years. A live-action version of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.\n\nFrom the original Internet preview oh so long ago, it had been a torturous wait that was made even worse a few short months before the premiere of the film.\n\nEarlier that year, we had the chance to view the twenty minutes of footage that New Line cut together for the Cannes' Film Festival. It featured a montage of never-before-seen footage and dialog leading up to the Moria sequence where for the first time we were able to see fully complete effects sequences and listen to Howard Shore's completed score.\n\nThe Moria sequence was complete from Balin's Tomb all the way up to the first reveal of the Balrog's head. New Line decided to torment viewers even more by then showing five minutes of footage from both The Two Towers and Return of the King, which ended with a shot of Frodo and Sam at the Cracks of Doom?\n\nNonetheless, the footage renewed our hopes that Fellowship wouldn't be a disaster. The Hobbit effects worked, the score was very fitting, and the whole thing seemed perfect.\n\nSo, after three hours in that giant IMAX auditorium on that cold December night I was fully ready to sit there another six hours to see both The Two Towers and Return of the King right then. But, I knew that it would be another year until the second installment, and I knew that the next year would be a torturous wait.\n\nAnd it has been.\n\nThe Two Towers is only two months away, but the Extended Cut Fellowship of the Ring is finally here on a stunning four-disc set that will probably go down in history as the best DVD ever produced.\n\nIn August, New Line released the theatrical cut of The Fellowship of the Ring, and that two-disc set is truly an archive of that release. You will not find the trailers or any promotional material about the film on this four-disc set, and you will not find the theatrical version of the movie. So, if you want to own that original version of the film, and have the trailers, you'll need to pick up that two-disc set.\n\nWhat you will find on this four-disc stunner is the extended 208-minute cut of the film spread across two discs with four commentaries and a new DTS soundtrack. If that wasn't enough, there are two more discs filled with over six hours of material that explores the epic undertaking of bringing Tolkien's classic to the screen.\n\nSince this review is so long, here's an index to let you know exactly what is covered where.

For those few people who have not, allow me to educate you.\n\nPeter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh had a truly daunting task. They had to convert Tolkien's lengthy fantasy epic into a motion picture screenplay while still staying true enough to the text to respect it and keep fans happy.\n\nAnd with The Fellowship of the Ring they did a pretty amazing job.\n\nThere are changes, sure, as it truly is impossible to completely translate the entire text of The Lord of the Rings into a coherent screenplay - let alone just one third of the story. But, the changes that they made are completely sensible and don't harm the spirit or intention of the story in any way.\n\nWe don't have Tom Bombadil, Arwen's role has been expanded greatly, and there are many other small changes to the story to make it flow as a movie should, especially since this first part of The Lord of the Rings is the slowest.\n\nBut, the things they added in are great. You actually see things here in the films that are only mentioned in the books. One example is when Gandalf heads to Minas Tirith to read the account of Isildur. And moving Boromir's death from the begging of The Two Towers to the end of Fellowship is a great change as it would have been a bad way to start the second movie.\n\nIt isn't word for word, but it's pretty close. All of the important dialog is spoken in the movie, and some of it is exactly as it appears in the original text.\n\nThere are even little mentions of The Hobbit such as where Bilbo is recounting his adventure with the three trolls to some young Hobbits, and later we see the three stone trolls after Frodo is injured by the Ringwraiths.\n\nThe movie opens with a great eight-minute introduction that gives the history of the Ring to those who aren't familiar with the story and then continues into a three-hour adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring that's so true to the spirit of the original text that no fan can really be disappointed.\n\nActually, I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.\n\nAs much as I like Star Wars, I think that The Lord of the Rings truly gave some people what they were hoping to see in the new Star Wars movies. It's a classic story with good versus evil, with a very strong sense of dread. The love story isn't overplayed. Characters are fleshed out perfectly. There's action, suspense, and sorrow. It's a true epic that doesn't lose its sheen even after multiple viewings.\n\nThe Cast\n\nAs strong as the script and directing is in the film, it still lives and dies on the cast. Millions around the world know these characters, and they had to have been cast perfectly. Thankfully, they were.\n\nGandalf the Grey: It's been said before, and I said it myself in my review of the Cannes Footage, but Ian McKellen is not in this movie. Sir Ian completely becomes the old wizard we all know and love from the book.\n\nAragorn Son of Arathorn: Viggo Mortensen did a very good job here as the Lost King of Gondor. In Fellowship, Strider/Aragorn is still just the mysterious Ranger and still unsure if he wants to take the throne of Gondor due to his bloodline being responsible for the Ring surviving.\n\nThe Hobbits: Part of the core of the movie is the friendship between the four Hobbits; Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippen. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippen (Billy Boyd) are mainly support roles in Fellowship as their parts don't get much larger until The Two Towers, but I must say that out of the two Pippen's casting seemed the most true to the character in the book.\n\nHowever, I was most concerned about Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), if only because they are two such recognizable actors. But, I was very surprised at the evolution of Frodo in just this first three hours of the story. He goes from being wide-eyed and innocent at the beginning of the movie, to dark and tormented by the burden of the Ring at the end. Just look at these screens for an example:\n\nAs for Sam, Sean Astin did a pretty good job and by the end of the movie where he and Frodo are sitting in the boat you really get the feeling that they are Frodo and Sam about to head into Mordor.\n\nLegolas Greenleaf: I really never heard of Orlando Bloom before the casting announcement, but I honestly have no complaints with his job of the Mirkwood Elf member of the Fellowship.\n\nGimli Son of Gloin: How cool is this? Sallah himself, John Rhys-Davis, playing the stout Dwarf Gimli in The Lord of the Rings! What more can I say? Gimli has some great moments in the film and even delivers a few chuckles.\n\nBoromir Son of Denethor: It was nice to see Sean Bean playing a non-villain in a major motion picture for once. And despite Boromir only being in this first film, he provides a good opposite to Aragorn. Where Aragorn shows to the good of man, Boromir demonstrates how easily one can be corrupted by the power of the Ring.\n\nSaruman the White: Christopher Lee. One of the great villain actors in movie history is playing one of the great villains in fantasy literature. Lee's Saruman is perfectly evil and calculating and I can't wait to see his fate play out in the next movie.\n\nElrond Peredhil, Lord of Rivendell: I've seen people complain about Hugo Weaving as Elrond. They'd crack stupid Matrix jokes every time he'd appear on screen, only to make themselves look stupid. As Agent Smith in The Matrix Weaving showed the poise needed for the regal Lord of Rivendell. When he does his \"Mr. Anderson\" speech early in that flick, it's almost as if Elrond was there interrogating Neo.\n\nArwen \"Evenstar\" Undomiel: Oh, this is the one that made fans go nuts. When it was announced that Arwen's part would be expanded, and that Liv Tyler would be playing the Elf princess, fanatics went into a frenzy.\n\nImagine almost everyone's surprise when Arwen spoke her first lines in the movie and didn't sound like the Liv Tyler everyone is used to. She sounded much more mature, and Arwen's part wasn't as obtrusive as many feared.\n\nGaladriel, Lady of the Galadrhim: The Lady Galadriel had to be someone beautiful and strong enough to hold her own against anyone. Cate Blanchett was a perfect choice to the immortal Elf.\n\nBilbo Baggins: Last but not least, I must mention Ian Holm's appearance as Bilbo. For those who ever heard the great BBC radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings seeing Holm here as Bilbo will bring a smile to their faces as he was Frodo in that radio drama.\n\nThe review continues...\n\nThe Music\n\nThere have been complaints that Howard Shore's music in the movie lacks a theme. To those I just have to ask, \"What movie were you watching?\"\n\nShore's soundtrack flows. It becomes so much a part of this movie that just as you can't imagine Star Wars without John Williams' music it's hard to imaging this film without Howard Shore's.\n\nThere are numerous themes that are woven through the film. There's the light and earthy Hobbit theme, the grand Fellowship fanfare, the Ring's theme, and even hints of things to come. When Boromir and Aragorn talk about the White City, we here a hint of a theme that we may hear more of in the next movies just as we will see the White City in this films.\n\nHoward Shore was completely deserving of his Academy Award for this score. I can't wait to hear The Two Towers and The Return of the King.\n\nThe Effects\n\nWETA Workshop and WETA Digital won an Academy Award for their work at bringing Middle-Earth to life on the big screen, and despite a couple little falters they did an astounding job.\n\nBy falters I mean that there are a couple shots where the CGI characters still look a little too CG. This is a problem that has plagued effects houses ever since the beginning of CG effects, and there are slight improvements in this movie, but you can still tell that they aren't real.\n\nUsing effects to amplify the already gorgeous New Zealand landscape, WETA brought Tolkien's Middle-Earth to life with amazing results. And not just in landscapes.\n\nThrough the use of both miniatures and CG the town of Rivendell, the Mines of Moria, and Saruman's tower of Orthanc are realized, as they probably couldn't have been twenty years ago.\n\nThanks to a little help from Digital Domain, the Ford sequence is even more incredible than one could hope. As the water rages towards the Ringwraiths, the white horses appear just as the book described.\n\nBut, WETA's contribution isn't limited to visual effects as they created a world out of the costumes, weapons, and sets used in the movie. The detail on just some of the clothing is so elaborate you'll want to go through this DVD with a fine toothed comb just to take it all in.\n\nWhat's new in this new extended edition? Head on to the next page for details on all that was added, expanded, and improved upon.\n\nThe Extended Cut, Part 1\n\nThis new version of The Fellowship of the Ring runs for 208 minutes, which adds roughly a half an hour to the movie.\n\nPeter Jackson is very adamant to point out that this version of the movie is not a \"Director's Cut\"; that label would go to the theatrical release. And even after watching this extended version, the original has some strengths in terms of a tighter pace, a little less redundancy, and a slightly different feel to the story.\n\nThis extended cut is truly just for those fans of the book that really wanted to see a bit more in the movie. It stands on its own, but I still believe that the original cut of the film flows a bit better than this one.\n\nBecause of the additional running time, and because there's four commentary tracks on the DVD; the film is split across two discs. The break comes right after the Forming of the Fellowship at the Council of Elrond. Right after Pippin says \"Great. Where are we going?\" the film fades to black and text that says \"The Story Continues on Disc Two\" appears. Upon placing the second disc in the drive, you're given the option to continue the story, continue the commentary, or go in and set up you audio options if you weren't listening to the DD 5.1 EX track that the disc defaults to.\n\nWhile the scene selection menu tells you what has been added (marked with *) as well as what was extended (marked with **), if you simply go directly to those scenes you'll still miss out on little additions throughout the film. There are small changes all over the place that those who have seen the film a lot (like myself) will catch.\n\nI'll just tackle all of these changes in chronological order, right from the beginning of the film.\n\nPrologue: One Ring to Rule Them All\n\nThe film begins as everyone remembers, right up to where Sauron makes his appearance. There are a couple of quick blows with his weapon before he starts to fling the Elves around like rag dolls.\n\nWhen Isildur is trying to escape with the Ring, we see the orcs ambush his party as Isildur slips the Ring on to his finger. We then see the invisible Isildur make his way down to the water where he begins to swim away. As he makes his escape, the ring slips from his finger and the orcs are able to spot him to fill his back with arrows.\n\nConcerning Hobbits\n\nInstead of seeing Frodo reading his book at the beginning of the movie, we're greeted with a close-up of a map of Middle-Earth while Bilbo gives a voice over about hobbits. The camera pans to the left to reveal Hobbiton and The Shire on the map, then pans right and zooms out to reveal that we're looking at a map of Bilbo's in Bag End as the old Hobbit writes his book.\n\nThis scene is a great example of how things were expanded in this cut. Instead of just tacking on new scenes to the existing footage, the sequence was completely re-edited to give it a very different effect. Sure, there are snippets of existing footage in the scene, but they aren't where we remember them, and some things have been changed completely.\n\nAs Bilbo's narration continues, we see many shots of Hobbits going along with their daily lives, which includes a shot of Sam working in his garden. We see a scene of Bilbo panicking when he thinks that he lost the Ring, only to realize that it's still in his pocket.\n\nWhen Frodo meets up with Gandalf, he has a few new lines about Bilbo and how Frodo has seen him going through maps. Some dialog was altered here, as Gandalf no longer tells Frodo that life in the outside world goes along as it always has, instead Bilbo says the line and it's applied to The Shire.\n\nVery Old Friends\n\nThere's a short addition in the scene with Bilbo and Gandalf in Bag End. The knock on the door is revealed to be the Sacksville Bagginses, who are after Bag End and have never forgiven Bilbo for getting so old.\n\nA Long Expected Party\n\nAnother short addition comes during Bilbo's birthday party. After Merry and Pippin steal the fireworks, but before they use them, we see the 111-year-old Hobbit greeting visitors to the party. When his ear twitches, he quickly grabs Frodo and hides behind a tent as the Sacksville Bagginses arrive. The two then share a nice little moment where Bilbo tells Frodo why he really adopted him.\n\nAt the Green Dragon\n\nA short new scene takes place in the Green Dragon Inn after Bilbo has left Hobbiton. We see Merry and Pippen singing and dancing on a table, while Frodo interrupts the Gaffer and Ted Sandyman's conversation about him \"cracking\" with \"and proud of it!\".\n\nWhen Frodo and Sam are leaving the Inn, a drunken Hobbit (not one our four, thankfully) hits on Rosie, which makes Sam a little mad. Frodo comforts him by saying \"Don't worry Sam, Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one\", which had the reverse affect by making Sam even more worried.\n\nThe Passing of Elves\n\nRemember that old photo of Frodo relaxing in a tree? Well, that scene is included as part of Frodo and Sam's trip out of the Shire. After they pass the scarecrow, we see Sam tending a fire as Frodo relaxes in a tree. When Frodo hears Elvish music, he says \"Wood Elves!\" and the two go to see a line of Elves moving through the forest and towards the Gray Havens. The Elvish here is really nice.\n\nAt the Sign of the Prancing Pony\n\nWhile not marked as having anything expanded or added, the arrival at Bree has a little bit of new dialog. There is a mention of the Shire as the Hobbits are trying to get past the gate, and the welcome speech they receive at the Prancing Pony is just a little bit different with slightly altered dialog and delivery.\n\nThe Nazgul\n\nAs Strider leads the Hobbits out of Bree there is some additional dialog about whether or not they can trust him, and moments are allowed to linger slightly. For example, right after Sam asks where he was leading them, we see a close-up of Strider as he reveals that they are headed to Rivendell, instead of it being a voice-over like it was in the theatrical cut. This part leads directly into the new scene in the Marshes.\n\nThe Midgewater Marshes\n\nThis is a decent little scene that features the Hobbits being lead through the Marshes by Strider. As Pippin and Merry are being eaten alive by mosquitoes, Merry says, \"What do they eat when they don't get Hobbit?\"\n\nAs the group rests, Frodo overhears Strider sadly singing a song in Elvish. When asked whom he was singing about, the Ranger responds that it was the Lay of Luthian, and tells Frodo a bit of the tale that parallels the Aragorn/Arwen story.\n\nFlight to the Ford\n\nThere is a very short addition to this scene that features Frodo waking up and seeing the Stone Trolls above him. Sam looks down at Frodo and mentions how they are \"Mr. Bilbo's Trolls!\"\n\nThe Sword the Was Broken\n\nBoromir and Aragorn are introduced to each other in this short extension. Before approaching the Shards of Narsil, Boromir notices the Ranger and mentions how he isn't an Elf. Aragorn gestures towards Boromir's clothing and mentions how the men of the south are welcome in Rivendell. Boromir asks him who he is, and he simply responds, \"I am a friend of Gandalf the Gray\".\n\nThe Council of Elrond\n\nOne of the most important scenes in the first half of the story is expanded slightly at its start. After Frodo places the Ring on the pedestal, Boromir goes for it. However, before he can grab it, Gandalf leaps out of his seat and begins to speak the Dark Speech of Mordor, which blackens the sky and makes the ground shake.\n\nThat ends the additions on the first disc; continue on to the next page to find out what was added on disc two.\n\nThe Extended Cut, Part 2\n\nBefore we dive into the changes on disc two, I should address the new pieces of music that Howard Shore created for the additional footage in the film. Almost every major moment that was extended or added to the film includes new music.\n\nFor example, when Boromir picks up the hilt of Narsil, there is now music playing and it's pretty good. However, the absolute best new piece of score comes towards the end of the film during the battle at Amon Hen when there is some new battle footage of Boromir defending Merry and Pippen. The score there is so good; it makes one really want an extended soundtrack release (hint, hint).\n\nGilraen's Memorial\n\nBefore we see Bilbo go all Gollum-like in his lust for the Ring, there's an excellent new scene of Aragorn tending to his mother's grave in Rivendell. Elrond joins him and tells him that the Elves can reforge the Sword the Was Broken, but only he has the power the wield it. Aragorn replies that he doesn't want that power and never did. It's an excellent addition to the movie, with even more Elvish spoken!\n\nThe Departure of the Fellowship\n\nAfter Bilbo's lunge for the Ring, there is a new scene that simply gave me goose bumps. We see the Fellowship ready to depart from Rivendell as Elrond delivers a speech. When he is done, Gandalf says, \"The Fellowship awaits the Ring Bearer\", and we then see Frodo's reluctant steps out of Rivendell through his eyes. As he passes under the arch, he asks \"Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?\" Gandalf pats Frodo on the shoulder and simply replies, \"Left.\"\n\nThe scene is just so perfect, with so many iconic shots of the characters before they depart on their quest that it's one moment fans of the books will love.\n\nThe Ring Goes South\n\nThe only change to this scene comes when Merry and Pippin tackle Boromir during their sword practice. Aragorn tries to break up the fun brawl and ends up tripping and falling on his back.\n\nThe Pass of Caradhras\n\nAfter the avalanche, but before Frodo decides to go through the mines, a line from Boromir was added where he says that staying on the mountain will be the death of the Hobbits and we see Merry and Pippin looking almost frozen.\n\nMoria\n\nThe Fellowship's arrival at Moria is extended quite a bit. Before Gimli spots the Walls of Moria, Gandalf stops Frodo and has a little talk with him where he warns of the danger from within the Fellowship and you can see that he senses something bad ahead of them.\n\nAs they approach the wall, new footage was added of them searching for the door including a small moment between Gimli and Legolas. Gandalf's attempt at opening the doors is extended a bit with him becoming a little frustrated and telling Pippin that he'll knock on the door with his head.\n\nA Journey in the Dark\n\nAfter the Fellowship is trapped inside Moria by the Watcher, but before they come to the crossroads, we see more footage of them moving through the mines (including one shot that was included in one of the trailers) as Gandalf explains the riches of Mithril to them and mentions how Bilbo received a coat of Mithril, which Gimli says is a \"kingly gift\".\n\nAlso while Gandalf is trying to remember what way to go, a small line about Smeagol was added to his conversation to Frodo about Gollum.\n\nBalin's Tomb\n\nThe addition to this scene comes as the Cave Troll enters the tomb. After Sam dives under its legs, the troll turns around and tries to step on the Hobbit. Aragorn and Boromir, who pull on its chain to allow Sam to get away, stop him. Immediately after that, the troll pulls on its chain, which causes Boromir to slam against a far wall. Stunned, he looks up to find an orc right above him and ready to strike. Aragorn saves his life by throwing his sword at the orc, killing it.\n\nLothlorien\n\nThis is a very different scene than the one in the theatrical release. It proceeds as normal, but cuts right before Gimli says, \"These woods are perilous\". Instead, we see the Fellowship on one of the high tree platforms with Haldir and his elves. He greets the Fellowship, but Gimli curses at him in Dwarvish, which gets a funny scolding out of Aragorn.\n\nAs Aragorn argues with Haldir in Elvish, Frodo looks at the rest of the Fellowship to see worry in their eyes. Remember the shots of Sam, Legolas, Merry, and Pippin that Frodo sees in the Mirror? Those shots are from this scene. Boromir tries to comfort Frodo by telling him that he has to live with the burden of the Ring, but shouldn't have to live with the burden of Gandalf's death.\n\nCaras Galadhom\n\nThe extended Lothlorien scene movies directly into this new version of the Fellowship's arrival at the grand Elven city of Caras Galadhom. We see the impressive trees from the outside, and then move into the familiar scenes of the Fellowship climbing the winding stairs.\n\nAs the reach the top we see a little bit more of the platforms that they are on, and when Celeborn and Galadriel arrive, both have additional lines. Legolas explains how Galdalf was lost to the Balrog and after a little more dialog between Celeborn, Galadriel, and the Fellowship we then move to the scene where the Elves are singing their Lament to Gandalf.\n\nHere some new footage is included that shows Aragorn sharpening his sword, Sam trying to make a poem about Gandalf's fireworks, and a funny moment where Gimli's snoring annoys Aragorn and earns a quick slap by the ranger.\n\nThe Mirror of Galadriel\n\nThe only change to this scene comes at the end, after the Ring tempts Galadriel. When she tells Frodo that to be a ring bearer is to be alone, she shows him Nenya.\n\nFarewell to Lorien\n\nOnly quickly shown in the theatrical cut, the Fellowship's departure is now fleshed out nicely. Legolas discovers the Lembas bread in his pack, takes a nibble, and explains to Merry and Pippin how one bite can fill a man's stomach for a day. After Legolas walks away Merry asks Pippin how many he ate, to which Pippin responds, \"Four\".\n\nMore Celeborn is included here as he gives Aragorn his Elven dagger and explains to him how the Fellowship is being tracked. We get to see the popular \"gifting\" scene as flashbacks with an extended moment between Galadriel and Aragorn where she talks about Arwen and calls him Ellesar!\n\nThe Great River\n\nBefore the Fellowship reaches the Argonath, they rest for a night along the shore of the river. Boromir and Aragorn notice Gollum following them on a log in the river, and this scene was actually seen in one of the trailers where Boromir and Aragorn where peeking out from behind a rock.\n\nAfter that, Sam and Frodo have a little moment where Sam tells him about the promise he made to Gandalf (again), and Frodo tells him that he couldn't help him, \"not this time\". Boromir and Aragorn then have a short argument where Boromir wants to take the ring to Gondor, and Aragorn tells him that he won't let the Ring get anywhere near there.\n\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\n\nA little bit of additional battle footage has been restored to Amon Hen. Before Legolas and Aragorn hear the Horn of Gondor, everyone's favorite Wood Elf shoots about six Uruk-Hai instead of the three we see in the theatrical cut. He and Aragorn then run down the hill towards the sound of the horn, and along the way Aragon slashes up some orcs pretty well and finishes one off by slashing its neck.\n\nMeanwhile, Boromir is defending the two Hobbits and we see him kill more orcs; including chopping off an arm, while Merry and Pippin toss rocks and even team up to tackle an Uruk-Hai. Howard Shore's new music in these scenes is the best of the additional music.\n\nThe Departure of Boromir\n\nThe final extended scene in the film (aside from the fan club credits) comes right after Boromir dies. Aragorn stands over him and says something along the lines of \"they will look for you from the White Tower, but you will not return.\"\n\nOverall\n\nRarely does everything come together in a movie to create a thoroughly entertaining film that pleases audiences of all ages. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those rare films.\n\nThis extended cut includes some scenes that fans of the books will love. However, those who complained about the length of the theatrical release had best steer clear of this one as it runs for about a half an hour longer and it's pace is a little slower than that original version.\n\nBut, if you've read this far you already know how great this movie is. Add this one to the list with Raiders of the Lost Arc and The Empire Strikes Back, it's a keeper.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nHead to the next page for the video review.\n\nThe Video\n\nPresented in the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, this transfer is excellent and is easily one of the best film-based DVD transfers yet. Even in the light of the amazing digital transfer for Star Wars Episode II, this transfer still impresses and proves that traditional film-based movie making is far from dead.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the first thing that will jump out at you is the excellent colors. One could say that they are stunning. The gold on the human and elf armors during the Last Alliance really stands out much more than it did in the theatrical print. You can really tell the difference what is silver and what is gold on the armor.\n\nMoving on to Hobbiton, prepare to be wowed. After Frodo joins Gandalf on the cart there is a shot of some Hobbits working in the field. The green of the grass in the background and the bright yellow of the plants in the foreground jumps right off of the screen at you.\n\nWhen Gandalf approaches Bag End one is impressed with the vibrant green of Bilbo's little round door, but it then gets even better as the door opens and we see Bilbo in his little red vest that really makes to take notice thanks to the clarity of the color.\n\nBut the color isn't the only thing that's impressive in the transfer. The detail is astounding.\n\nIt's great throughout the film, but you really notice the difference as the Fellowship heads into Moria. There are details on the massive pillars that one couldn't really see in the theatrical print and the Balrog features so many little details in its skin that I really hope some electronics stores start to use this disc to demo TVs as it will sell a lot of high-end sets.\n\nThe two-disc DVD release of the theatrical cut of The Fellowship of the Ring featured an excellent 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer, and this extended DVD features a transfer that's even better - although the differences aren't that easy to spot at first.\n\nEdge enhancement was minimal in the two-disc set, and here it's almost completely absent; although I did still notice it once or twice. As with the two-disc set, it's not as bad as other discs such as The Phantom Menace. Also, detail levels are even better. I was able to make out all sorts of new little details in Gimli's armor, as well as see some better texture; especially in close-ups.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nWhat better way to show off this disc than some screens? Here are a couple shots from my favorite scenes in the movie, and then continue on to the next page for the audio review:\n\nThe Audio\n\nEver since its DVD release last year, many have considered Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to have the absolute best Dolby Digital mix on any DVD.\n\nThat is, until the two-disc set arrived. The Fellowship of the Ring featured a robust Dolby Digital 5.1 EX track that was consistently impressive from the opening scene to the closing credits. This new extended cut includes a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix that is even a bit better than that previous release, in addition to a DTS ES 6.1 mix that is one of the best DTS tracks on DVD.\n\nThe Last Alliance in the opening of the film is the first time where Howard Shore's score really explodes to all of the channels, and you better hold on to something when Sauron is defeated, as the resulting shockwave through your sub will send your pets running for cover. In the DTS mix, the resulting bass from Sauron's defeat is much more balanced and less \"jarring\" as the same scene in the Dolby track.\n\nSubtle ambience in the track is amazing with nearly every scene, indoors or outdoors, featuring some kind of sound coming from your surrounds be it the fire crackling in Bag End or the sounds of birds chirping and a trickling stream in Rivendell. All of that ambience comes through even clearer and more naturally in the DTS mix, and that is actually one of the things that sets the DTS track above the Dolby one in terms of preference.\n\nOther impressive scenes include Bilbo's birthday party where the fireworks show gives you some excellent directional fun, while the applause during the speech comes from all around you to give one the feeling that they are right there in the middle of the crowd.\n\nBut, the best part of the entire track comes during the long Moria sequence.\n\nFrom Balin's tomb where the audio puts you in the middle of the battle, to the even more impressive shot when the Fellowship (and you) are surrounded by thousands of orcs; the audio doesn't let up until Gandalf is lost to the Balrog.\n\nEven the quieter dialog moments in Moria impress such as the scene in Balin's tomb before the battle where the audio makes it sound as if you were right there with the group in this huge empty chamber.\n\nIn both mixes, all channels are put to perfect use while your subwoofer will continuously shake your house down to its foundation and make the neighbors call the cops. Even if you don't have a DTS compatible receiver, you can't go wrong with the Dolby mix. But if you do have DTS (and you should), you're in for a real treat with this DVD.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nContinue on to the review of the commentaries...\n\nThis DVD includes four feature-length scene-specific audio commentaries that cover every single aspect of the film from adapting the book to the screen to the actual production and release.\n\nIn order to give you the most complete review possible, I listened to all four commentaries from beginning to end and you'll find details on each one on the four following pages.\n\nCommentary #1 - The Director and Writers\n\nThe first commentary is actually the best of the four as it includes Director, Co-Writer, and Producer Peter Jackson with Fran Walsh (Co-Writer/Producer), and Philippa Boyens (Co-Writer). While the Cast commentary is quite fun to listen to, this one is the most informative of the three with all sorts of cool bits of information revealed.\n\nPeter Jackson is obviously the most talkative person on the track with Philippa Boyens coming in a close second. Fran Walsh doesn't talk too much, but she'll definitely join in on the conversation to provide information on a specific scene or aspect of the script that she contributed to. Jackson is relaxed in the track and completely opens up the floodgates of info. He knows that he's talking to the hardcore fans of the movie and books, so he doesn't really have to waste too much time explaining things.\n\nThere is just so many cool bits of information and stories revealed in this track that I have over two pages worth of notes about it. Here are just some of the best:\n\nAn alternate version of the Prologue was one that would have Elijah Wood doing the voice over. The original idea was that Frodo was telling the story after his adventure, but it was later changed as they realized that Frodo probably wouldn't have been that versed in the history of Middle-Earth.\n\nAs we all know, the Prologue is now told by Galadriel who is revealed to end The Return of the King with a similar voice-over.\n\nNew Line was who wanted a Prologue in the film, but they said it could only be two minutes long. It was one of the hardest scenes to come up with in the film, and the final version runs more than seven minutes.\n\nThe Prologue wasn't finished until the score for the film was being recorded.\n\nGandalf banging his head on the door frame in Bag End was an accident that they decided to keep.\n\nIan Holm (Bilbo) was always on Jackson's \"wish list\" for the film.\n\nBilbo's party was supposed to have 144 Hobbits, but in the film there is only about 100.\n\nThe Bakshi animated version of The Lord of the Rings was Jackson's introduction to the story. He didn't read the book until after he saw that movie and the camera angle used in the \"Proudfeet!\" shot is a tribute to that version of the story.\n\nPeter Jackson convinced New Line to allow him to keep the Bag End set, and he has it in storage.\n\nThere was a scene where Elrond recited the entire \"Ring Poem\", but it was cut.\n\nJackson mentions the popular \"car\" in the movie. He says that he never saw it.\n\nThe \"Wraith Scream\" was actually Fran Walsh. Philippa Boyens made a joke by saying the way they got that scream out of her was by saying that Peter got the film rights to The Silmarillion.\n\nOne of the added scenes shows Strider bringing a deer to feed the Hobbits. That shot was Viggo's idea.\n\nA funny outtake is talked about after the Fellowship hides from the crows. In one take, Gandalf popped out from behind the rock and said \"Spies of Star Wars!\"\n\nAnother funny moment was when Peter revealed that he wanted to do a shot where Bill the Pony was dragged into the water by the Watcher. It came complete with his impersonation of poor Bill.\n\nThe Smeagol mention in Moria was added because of The Two Towers and the hope that some people would see this DVD before watching that movie.\n\nFinally, there is discussion of Dwarf Tossing in the commentary.\n\nCommentary #2 - The Design Team\n\nMoving on to the next track, the Design Team takes over the reigns to discuss creating the look of the film from every angle; be it armor and weapons, artwork, sets, miniatures, or costumes.\n\nYour hosts this track are Richard Taylor (Weta Workshop Creative Supervisor), Alan Lee (Conceptual Designer), John Howe (Conceptual Designer), Dan Hennah (Supervising Art Director/Set Decorator), Grant Major (Production Designer), Ngila Dickson (Costume Designer), Chris Hennah (Art Department Manager), and Tania Rodger (Weta Workshop Manager).\n\nObviously all of them aren't in the same room at once, but some of them were recorded together while it's apparent that others were alone in their commentary. It doesn't hurt the track one bit as it's expertly edited together to create a scene-specific audio commentary. Richard Taylor sort of commands the track as he divulges a lot of information, as well as giving credit where credit is due by naming every person who was responsible for something that he mentions. He does this on the documentary on disc three as well.\n\nWhile it's a solid track, a lot of the information here is duplicated in the documentaries on disc three and some information from track one is repeated here. Still, there are some interesting things revealed in the commentary:\n\nAlan Lee plays one of the Nine Kings of Men in the Prologue (the third one on the right).\n\nThe ring maker originally didn't want to do the movie because he wasn't into fantasy literature, but he took the job after being yelled at by his kids.\n\nIn one of the extended scenes, Bilbo's ear wiggles. That was actually Ian Holm wiggling his ear and not a trick.\n\nThe guy who applied Sean Astin's Hobbit feet was Sean Foot. No lie.\n\nWhen Bilbo drops the Ring upon leaving Bag End, a magnet was under the floor to make it seem heavier than normal.\n\nThere was a moment before production where a Tolkien Scholar visited the Balin's Tomb set and read the Dwarvish Runes on the wall. He then made a big deal to New Line that someone wrote \"Joe Was Here\" in Dwarvish on the wall and that fans would throw a fit over it. The crew went over the set with a fine toothed comb and didn't see that written anywhere on the wall. Apparently a member of the crew was playing a joke on the Scholar and it got out of hand.\n\nFinally, John Howe mentions late in the commentary how he never really drew Saruman, and after the movie has a hard time picturing the wizard as anyone other than Christopher Lee.\n\nCommentary #3 - The Production and Post Production Team\n\nThe third commentary track is a whopper in terms of the number of participants. On the track you'll hear from Barrie Osborne (Producer), Mark Ordesky (Executive Producer), Andrew Lesnie (DP), John Gilbert (Editor), Rick Porras (Co-Producer), Howard Shore (Composer), Jim Rygeil (VFX Supervisor), Ethan Van der Ryn (Supervising Sound Editor/Co-Designer), Mike Hopkins (Supervising Sound Editor), Randy Cook (Weta Animation Designer and Supervisor), Christine Rivers (Weta VFX Art Director), Brian V'ant Hull (Weta VFX Cinemeatographer), and Alex Funke (Miniatures Director of Photography).\n\nEveryone is very active in this commentary with the VFX experts detailing how specific scenes were done, the producing team covering the production aspects, and Howard Shore commenting on how the score evolves over the course of the film. A couple participants were recorded together, but the track is comprised of multiple commentaries edited together.\n\nShore's comments make this track worth listening to. He appears at key moments in the score to point out moments where a theme appears for the first time and then later to illustrate where a theme has fully come into its own. It's one of the best parts of all four commentaries.\n\nAs with the Design commentary, some information here is duplicated from the other tracks and documentaries, but there are some cool things as well. Here is just a small sample of some of the things revealed in the commentary:\n\nThere's a lot of talk about the MASSIVE computer program and how the AI in the program allows the creation of convincing epic battles.\n\nThere will be more use of MASSIVE in The Two Towers, but The Return of the King will be \"all out war\" using the program.\n\nThey talked about the work that went into avoiding leaks from the Hobbiton sets because they didn't want people to see the Hobbits until the right time.\n\nThere are some talks about some funny outtakes such as one where Aragorn is chewing on the plant to heal Frodo and he accidentally spit it out on to Arwen, which looked quite \"pornographic\".\n\nCommentary #4 - The Cast\n\nOk, we've heard all of the technical commentaries and now it's time to have some fun. The cast commentary includes Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, and Sean Bean.\n\nOur four Hobbits were recorded together, which was a good idea as the four have quite a fun time telling stories from the set and just laughing at little in-jokes between them. The first part of the commentary is mostly them remembering being a Hobbit and the fun they had on the set. Lots of laughs come from this group.\n\nThe rest of the cast was recorded separate from each other. My favorite parts of the commentary come from Christopher Lee who is a TOLKIEN GOD. Not only has he been in over 200 films, and has a huge cult following, but this respected actor has read The Lord of the Rings once a year, every year since it was published. He knows the books as well as almost anyone could.\n\nThis is one of those commentaries that is just fun to listen to. It's full of laughter, funny stories, and stories from the set. I actually have more notes from this commentary than the excellent Director and Writer commentary. Here's just a sample of the fun stuff in the track:\n\nMcKellen opens up the track by saying that he's glad it doesn't say \"A Peter Jackson Film\" in the opening credits. He says that the film is truly Tolkien's film.\n\nSir Ian was also originally offered the voice over duties for the Prologue.\n\nThe cast was apparently seeing this extended cut for the first time as Elijah and the other Hobbits were quite surprised and happy to see the extended opening in the Shire.\n\nIan McKellen speaks a bit about how much he wanted to work with Ian Holm and this movie finally gave him the chance to do so.\n\nSir Ian also mentions how he modeled Gandalf's voice after Tolkien's.\n\nThe four Hobbits fought hard to keep the Green Dragon scene in the movie.\n\nElijah was 18 at the start of the production.\n\nThe fab four mentioned some of the games that they played in order to pass the time on the set, including one called \"Cup\" that involved a paper cup.\n\nThere were no Hobbit feet on the first day of shooting.\n\nWhen Sir Ian saw the other Sir Ian in the old Bilbo make-up, he told him that he looked like Judi Dench's mother. So later in the track when Bilbo is giving Frodo Sting and the Mithril coat, Ian McKellen says, \"there's Dench again\".\n\nBilly Boyd and Dominic Monaghan share a story about the two of them sliding down a snowy mountain on shovels.\n\nLate in the commentary the four Hobbits reveal how they would tease John Rhys-Davies by saying \"Indy, they're digging in the wrong place again!\".\n\nAll four commentaries are pretty good, with the first and fourth being the best, but they are only the tip of the iceberg. There is over six hours of supplemental material on discs three and four, so head on to the next page where we'll dive on into the amazing extras in this set.\n\nBefore diving into the great set of special features that can be found on discs three and four, I have to talk about the menus and presentation in the set. All four discs feature fully animated menus set to Howard Shore's music. Each disc is presented like a book, which each menu being a page of that book complete with John Howe and Alan Lee conceptual artwork used as the background. The scene selection menus are even impressive with not only full video used for each selection, but also music from that scene that's played when you have it highlighted.\n\nDiscs three and four are structured like the Appendices of a book, with the third disc being \"From Book to Vision\", and disc four covering \"From Vision to Reality\".\n\nThe Extras - Disc Three, Part 1\n\nDisc three covers the adaptation of Lord of the Rings into a movie as well as the design of the epic and it kicks off with an introduction by Peter Jackson where he tells viewers how the disc is structured and how they can navigate it.\n\nThere are other documentaries out there about Tolkien, but the one on this DVD is by far the best. \"J.R.R. Tolkien - Creator of Middle-Earth\" gives us the complete story about Tolkien's life and talks about how he fought in WWI and most of his close friends didn't return from the war. It was in the trenches when the \"Lost Tales\" were written, and Middle-Earth began to be formed.\n\nThe documentary is very explicit in saying that there is no analogy in the meaning of LOTR, and even includes excerpts from Tolkien's forward to the book where he himself says that there is no hidden meaning. Actor Clive Revill reads these excerpts from Tolkien's forward. After so many bad Tolkien documentaries were farted out on DVD to cash in on the movie hype, it's nice to have a good one such as this to watch.\n\n\"From Book to Screen\" starts out with short interview clips with select members of the cast and crew where they share their memories of reading The Lord of the Rings for the first time, and then dives right on into the daunting task of adapting the book to the screen.\n\nDetails of the history with Miramax are revealed, such as how they were developing the story for the studio, but when they wanted it to be one movie Peter Jackson began to shop the idea of two films around to other studios. Then they met with New Line, who wanted to do the story as a trilogy and the rest is history. Jackson and crew immediately went into re-writes to turn their two-movie treatment into a trilogy, which is when they brought in Philippa Boyens to work with Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh to turn Tolkien's classic into a film.\n\nThe documentary goes into some detail about the changes that they had to make to the story in order to translate it to the screen, and yes Tom Bombadil is mentioned. However, one of the people featured in the interviews is Christopher Lee, and he basically says that Tom Bombadil isn't 100% necessary for the story. Coming from someone who knows the book as well as Christopher Lee; that should be the final word on the whole Bombadil controversy.\n\n\"Visualizing the Story\" goes into a different menu where the disc begins to explore the next stage of adapting The Lord of the Rings to the screen.\n\n\"Storyboards and Pre-Viz: Making Words into Images\" covers the storyboard process as well as the computerized \"pre-viz\" technique. We see how they used storyboards with temporary voice tracks and music to illustrate how the movie will play out. There's also footage of the early animatics, and we learn how Star Wars affected the production.\n\nRick McCallum visited Peter Jackson one day and offered to show them how they were doing the pre-viz on Star Wars. When Jackson and gang were in San Francisco once, they headed up to Skywalker Ranch and were shown how Lucasfilm was using computers to plan out scenes in Episode II. When he returned to New Zealand, he set up a pre-viz department for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nThere's also some test footage with Peter Jackson and a couple others in the incomplete Bag End set where they were working out some of the early scale issues with Jackson playing Bilbo.\n\nAfter that documentary, there are storyboard reels for three sequences. There's the original Frodo version of the Prologue, the shot (and abandoned) scene where the orcs pursue the Fellowship into Lothlorien, and a rapids scene that was never filmed due to flooding in the area. When you're done with those, you can check out early computer animatics for \"Gandalf Rides to Orthanc\" and \"The Stairs of Kazad-dum\". And if that wasn't good enough, there are animatic-to-film comparisons for the \"Nazgul Attack at Bree\" and \"The Bridge of Kazad-dum\" sequences.\n\nFinally, the full video of the Bag End set test is included to round out this section of the disc.\n\nThe Extras - Disc Three, Part 2\n\n\"Designing and Building Middle-Earth\" is an astonishingly in-depth look at the creation of this fictional world for the film and is split into multiple documentaries and galleries.\n\n\"Designing Middle-Earth\" talks about how they brought renowned Tolkien artists John Howe and Alan Lee in as the concept artists on the film. These two artists really defined the look of Middle-Earth through their paintings, and brining them on to the movie was one of the best decisions made early in its production.\n\nPeter Jackson tells stories of how it was tricky to locate Alan Lee, and then we hear from John Howe where he tells us how he received a phone call about the job at 3:00am and immediately accepted it. Believe it or not, these two famous Tolkien artists never met each other until they arrived in New Zealand.\n\nAs the documentary begins to go into great depth on designing the look of the film, we see footage of John Howe and Alan Lee sketching Hobbiton while on location, as well as witnessing their designs of Rivendell and every other location in the film, including how the movie's version of Orthanc came directly from a painting of the tower that Alan Lee did.\n\nIt's an amazing documentary that's very interesting and just draws you right in as you see the design of the movie beginning to take shape, but the disc gets even better from here on out.\n\n\"Weta Workshop\" is one of the best documentaries on the disc. This long featurette takes us inside the massive Weta Workshop where Richard Taylor gives us a tour of everything they created for the film as well as showing us how they created the weapons, armor, and make-up effects in the movie.\n\nThe Workshop was responsible for designing all of the weapons, armor, props, and practical creatures in the film. Basically everything. This great documentary goes into exact detail on how everything was created.\n\nWe see the incredible scale that was needed for an epic of this size with rooms upon rooms that are just packed full of weapons, armor, and masks that were needed for all of the extras. There's even some detail on the miniatures, which are covered in even more depth on disc four. Richard Taylor also describes the design philosophy behind the creatures that they designed such as the Watcher in the Water.\n\nMoving on to the armor department, we see how Weta developed a way to create realistic and light chainmail by creating it out of small plastic rings. John Howe also brought a lot of experience to the armor design, as he's something of an expert in medieval arms and weaponry.\n\nThere's a moment where Richard Taylor gives us a tour of the weapons and armors that they created and describes how each piece was made, which is a real treat to see the detail in all of the important weapons in the movie such as Sting. It's an amazing documentary.\n\n\"Costume Design\" is a shorter featurette that has costume designer Ngila Dickson describing how the unique costumes in the film were made. One neat moment in it is when she points out how Saruman's robes were aged.\n\nFollowing that documentary are stunningly complete Design Galleries. These are split into two sections: \"The Peoples of Middle-Earth\" and \"The Realms of Middle-Earth\". Each of these is further broken down to more specific galleries of images. \"The Realms of Middle-Earth\" includes the various locations in the movie, while \"The Peoples of Middle-Earth\" includes galleries for every character in the film organized into different sections such as \"The Enemy\", \"The Last Alliance\", \"Isengard\", \"Bilbo Baggins\", \"The Fellowship\", \"Rivendell\", and \"Lothlorien\". Most of those go into deeper menus where you're able to browse a gallery of images by character, and many of the images include commentary by the artist. Whew.\n\nThere's an interactive Middle-Earth Atlas that allows you to click on a location that will then display a clip of the film that takes place there. Along the same lines is \"New Zealand of Middle-Earth\", which is an interactive map of the country that shows video clips of the location scouting trips for the major locations in the film.\n\nDisc three is only the beginning, head to the next page for the second disc of special features.\n\nThe Extras - Disc Four, Part 1\n\nDisc four chronicles the translation of the vision to reality with details on the cast, the visual effects, post-production, and more. It begins with a short introduction by Elijah Wood that is very similar to the one that Peter Jackson gives at the beginning of disc three.\n\n\"Filming 'The Fellowship of the Ring'\" takes us on a trip to meet the cast and witness the filming of this epic.\n\n\"The Fellowship of the Cast\" is a fun documentary that includes interviews with each member of the cast as they remember signing on to the movie and their memories of shooting the epic over sixteen months.\n\nThere are lots of laughs in this documentary, and lots of stories from the three Hobbits. Elijah Wood mentions how Sean Astin looked after him just like Sam looks after Frodo. The three other Hobbits also have a lot of fun teasing Sean Astin for his paranoid nature when it came down to safety, such as the time when he was directing some helicopters in for a landing.\n\nPeter Jackson talks about having to re-cast Aragorn at the last minute and how Viggo accepted the role because of his Son, as well as mentioning how they put the actors through boat training early in the production. John Rhys-Davies shares a funny story of how the boat he and Orlando Bloom capsized their boat.\n\nWhen the focus goes to the two Wizards, it's mentioned how Gandalf's voice was modeled after Tolkien as well as how the role of Saruman for Christopher Lee was fulfilling a life-long ambition to be involved with a Lord of the Rings film as he's read the book every year since it was published and even met Tolkien. This part of the documentary gets a whole lot cooler at the end when Christopher Lee recites the Black Speech.\n\nFinally, the documentary covers the scale doubles for the Hobbits, who were just as important to the film as anyone else in the cast.\n\n\"A Day in the Life of a Hobbit\" is basically what it sounds like as it follows Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monaghan through their experiences as Hobbits and includes behind the scenes footage of them becoming Hobbits, filming specific scenes, and having their feet removed at the end of a long day. There's a lot of raw on-the-set footage of the four Hobbits just hanging out and having fun. We learn that Sean Astin kept track of how many days that they had to wear Hobbit feet and the feet weren't actually seen on-screen. At the end of production, there were about fifty days when they had to put on the feet for no reason.\n\n\"Cameras in Middle-Earth\" goes into detail on the actual filming of the movie (well, movies as they were filming three at once) by talking about how they had multiple filming units running around New Zealand to capture all of the footage that was needed.\n\nWe're then taken on a trip around New Zealand to see where every major location in the movie was shot be it a location or a set on a soundstage. Each location is marked by a chapter stop in the documentary, which is packed full of awesome behind-the-scenes footage of the epic being filmed.\n\nAt the end of this section, there is an extensive gallery of Production Photos.\n\nMoving on to the \"Visual Effects\" section, we find three featurettes.\n\n\"Scale\" explains how the illusion of creating small Hobbits out of normal-sized actors was achieved. It shows how the filmmakers used Forced Perspective, Forced Perspective with a Moving Camera, Scale Compositing with a blue screen, Big Rigs (which were giant stilt suits), and Scale Doubles to create convincing Hobbits in the movie.\n\nThis documentary includes lots of never-before-seen test footage where they were figuring out how they can make all of the forced perspective tricks work.\n\n\"Miniatures\" takes us to another menu where there is a documentary titled \"Big-atures\" and a gallery of the miniatures used in the movie.\n\n\"Big-atures\" features Weta Workshop and the elaborate over-size miniatures (or \"big-atures\") that they created for the movie. It shows the models in detail and we get to see Rivendell, Caras Galadham, Isengard and its caverns, Moria, and The Argonath in great detail. The galleries includes images of the models for Orthanc, Rivendell, Moria, Lothlorien, the Hobbiton factories, and The Argonath.\n\n\"Weta Digital\" goes inside Peter Jackson's own little Kiwi effects house in New Zealand where most of the digital effects for The Lord of the Rings were created. Weta Digital is to Peter Jackson what ILM is to George Lucas, and we learn how Jackson created Weta Digital back in the days of Heavenly Creatures so they wouldn't have to pay someone else to do their visual effects.\n\nAfter that introduction is done, we're taken inside the effects house for in-depth looks at how all of the major effects were created in the film. One of the earliest things they did was plan out the entire Cave Troll fight in the computer via a VR staging of the scene. This allowed Peter Jackson to run a virtual camera through the scene to plan out exactly how it would appear in the final film.\n\nIn addition to showing how digital effects were used to enhance landscape scenes, the documentary reveals the creation of the digital creatures such as the Cave Troll, the Watcher in the Water, and of course the incredible Balrog. From there, they show how digital stunt doubles for the actors were created for some of the miniature scenes.\n\nThe Extras - Disc Four, Part 2\n\n\"Post-Production: Putting it all Together\" details the final stages of the film's creation and includes two features:\n\n\"Editorial: Assembling an Epic\" goes into the sheer scale of the editing of the movies. It shows the editing room and just how much work had to go into assembling such a huge movie. Peter Jackson mentions how they had to sit through three to four hours of dailies each night after filming. There's talk about choosing what was left in the film and what was cut, as well as the challenge of getting the film down to an acceptable running time.\n\nIt then goes into a lot of detail about the headache-inducing Prologue sequence that was the final thing they completed in the film, and then discusses the re-editing of the film and this Extended Cut while still stressing that the original theatrical edition was Peter Jackson's cut and that this new version is not a \"Director's Cut\".\n\nFor an example of the challenge in editing the movie, you can check out \"Editorial Demonstration: The Council of Elrond\" where the Forming of the Fellowship is shown in a multi-angle demonstration with six sources of footage that shows you how they were combined into the final sequence.\n\n\"Digital Grading\" is all about how they took the original footage and scanned it into a computer to adjust the image. This was done to not only create an otherworldly feeling for Middle-Earth, but to also maintain consistency throughout the movie. Multiple before and after comparisons are shown via split screen video, and then viewers are guided through the major sequences that were digitally graded and its explained why those grading choices were made. After the process is explained, the documentary has very detailed step-by-step examples of how certain scenes were enhanced.\n\n\"Sound and Music\" includes two documentaries:\n\n\"The Soundscapes of Middle-Earth\" is a featurette of the sound design in the movie that shows how the various sound effects were created. \"The Watcher\", \"Moria Orcs\", \"The Cave Troll\", \"The Balrog\", \"The Ringwraiths\", and \"The Ring\" are all explored in great detail to show how their unique sounds were made before the documentary covers the ADR process that this film, and most films, have to go through.\n\n\"Music for Middle-Earth\" is all about Howard Shore composing his awesome score for the film. He talks about the daunting task of creating a score to a book that the author spent fourteen years writing. In addition to seeing some footage of the scoring, there's a small bit about the Lay of Luthien, as well as the Moria choir that features Dwarvish verses.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. It addresses Enya's contribution to the score, and how Philippa Boyens wrote most of the choral parts of the soundtrack such as the Lament to Gandalf in Lothlorien or the Ringwraiths' theme. Also, Howard Shore talks about the music themes for the temptation, evil, and sheer power of the Ring. He then describes how the Fellowship theme begins in the cornfield at the beginning of the film, is fully formed at the Council of Elrond, and then isn't ever heard again that grand as it crumbles after the death of Gandalf and the Fellowship is broken.\n\nThe final documentary on the disc is the aptly titled \"The Road Goes Ever On...\" that features footage taken from the UK and in Wellington (New Zealand) premieres of the film, and features some interviews with the cast and crew looking back at the five year journey of bringing the Fellowship to the screen. It ends with Peter Jackson looking forward to the next two films, and the words \"To Be Continued...\"\n\n10 out of 10\n\nFor the final score on the disc and my closing comments, continue to the final page.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nSimply put, this is the best DVD ever made.\n\nSince the format's introduction in 1997 there has yet to be a disc that offers this depth and knowledge about a movie wrapped up in a presentation this amazing. The only thing that comes remotely close is the Vista Series release of Pearl Harbor.\n\nHonestly, what more could you ask for? In addition to getting the extended cut of the film with four commentary tracks and a new DTS ES mix for the film; there's two more discs packed full of documentary material that runs for more than six hours. That doesn't even include the wealth of image galleries on the disc.\n\nUnless you truly hate this movie, I don't see any reason why someone with a DVD player wouldn't want this set in his or her collection.\n\n10 out of 10"
