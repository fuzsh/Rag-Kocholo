        "text": "I recently learned the news that I'm going to be a father -- and while my wife and I are still in the \"elated shock phase\" in regards to becoming parents for the first time, we're already talking about our child's foreseeable future. Don't get the wrong idea, we're not picking out our progeny's profession, university, and peer set just yet, but we are evaluating our day-to-day lifestyle and making sure that we're taking all the necessary steps towards becoming good parents. One of our main concerns, of course, is how our jobs and work schedules will affect our child's essential early years of development -- and more importantly, how to responsibly approach my career in videogames.\n\nAnd approach it responsibly I'll have to do, because just like any other entertainment medium, digital gaming has a very broad spectrum. There are platformers, shooters, role-playing games, adventures, puzzlers, and a number of other genre types that run the gamut of demographic appeal. Yet despite that fact, there's no denying that titles aimed at teens and older groups are the ones that dominate store shelves. Walking into your local Target or Best Buy with a young son or daughter in search of an appropriate videogame isn't always easy with IPs like Halo 2, Resident Evil 4, and God of War prominently displayed on the end caps.\n\nWhat are your kids playing?Long story short, my new lot in life got me to thinking about this subject rather heavily. Though I don't claim to be the next Dr. Phil or anything, as an industry professional that's been in the games business for almost seven years, I figured that my knowledge could be put to good use and might provide would-be and existing parents with a possible helping hand. With that in mind, I've set out to answer several questions that I've already considered for my own child, while also addressing inquiries that I've received from parents just like you.\n\nAt what age should I let my child play videogames?\n\nI'm not an expert in child development so obviously that decision is entirely yours as parents. That said, I can speak from my own personal experience and point out that I first began playing videogames around the age of three via the household Atari 2600. At the time, my parents found it to be a rather constructive way to use the television between episodes of Sesame Street and the Electric Company, and as avid gamers themselves, thought it a good method of spending time with my brother and me without having to take us outside. Speaking of which, my brother has a child of his own that is almost five years old, and he allowed his son to start playing videogames at roughly the same age we were when we started.\n\nFor those that feel that three or four years may still be too early to sacrifice your kids' thumbs to the plastic mash monster, you might be interested in the findings of a recent study conducted by the National Institute of Media and the Family (a non-profit organization aimed at watching media content for families). In it, the organization surveyed 657 young people between the 4th and 12th grade age bracket to better understand the demographic and its gaming habits. Of those surveyed 87% of 8-to-17 year-old children play videogames at home. Specific data indicates that 92% of boys and 80% of girls in that demographic play with entertainment software, while the average age of survey participants was 13.7. This data suggests that most parents allow their children to start playing videogames at or before the tail-end of grade school.\n\nHow long should a child play videogames before taking a break and what's the optimal distance for them to sit?\n\nIt has been the general consensus of eye specialists and vigilant moms for years that television watching (be it interactive or not) is best suited at distances of five feet or more. It's also a good idea to have some kind of ambient or overhead light as opposed to the playing in the dark. This distance and the accompanying light are both measures meant to reduce eye strain and fatigue.\n\nAs for the length of the gaming sessions themselves, in an ideal situation nobody (including children or adults) should be playing games for longer than an hour at a time (followed by a 15- to 30-minute break). Just as the light and distance advantages mentioned above are meant to reduce eye strain and fatigue, so too are the frequent pauses... plus it'll teach your kid that there are other places to go in the home other than the couch.\n\nCan playing videogames be dangerous to my child's health? And on the flipside, are there any advantages?\n\nThere is research supported by various scientific organizations out there that prolonged computer and television exposure results in Myopia -- or \"Near-sightedness.\" Of course, there are just as many reports that Myopia isn't caused by our hobby at all -- so an \"official\" answer as it relates to permanent damage to your peepers is still up in the air. But let me tell you this: I had 20/20 vision in 1995 before getting very deep into PC strategy games. A few years later in 1998 after countless all-night sessions of Warcraft 2, Command and Conquer, and Total Annihilation, I had 20/100 vision and was getting my first pair of glasses. Coincidence? I'll leave that for you to decide.\n\nBut what about other physical problems? Do videogames cause people to be fat, lose brain cells, etc? Interestingly, several 1990s studies showed that frequent game players were more intelligent than non-gamers and had a tendency of wanting to exceed in school and athletics. Other more recent studies, however, suggest that frequent game players suffer from chronically bad posture or even hand pains similar to arthritis.\n\nBut it's the psychological effect of videogames that's the most popular debate of them all. Several studies have shown that regular game players have a tendency to be more aggressive and desensitized to violence than infrequent game players. Then again, just as many studies show that games have a calming effect on children, and because they can act out aggressions through fantasy, are less aggressive and more mindful of worldly dangers in real life.\n\nWhat does it all mean? Well, with conflicting reports regarding all mentioned health hazards, there's no right or wrong answer. Until a general consensus among researchers and health officials is revealed, the dangers and benefits of playing videogames are as open for debate as your political affiliation, favorite sports team, or preferred episode of 24.\n\nName some good entry-level software for grade-schoolers.\n\nBetween the ages of five and ten, children are human sponges. They seem to absorb every bit of information you throw at them and are very eager to try out new things and have fun. Reason and problem solving is still developing at this age too and kids in this category love to push their limits. It's because of this always-interested behavior that you should take this opportunity to introduce them to genres like puzzle games, platformers, and as they reach the latter stage of adolescence, full-blown action titles. Complex menu systems and short attention spans will probably make it difficult for these children to get into RPGs, adventures, and similarly long-winded products (but racers might work out if they like the theme).\n\nListed below are ten recent games that would be great for kids in this age group to play, followed by their genre and system they appear on (Click on a title for more information).\n\n-- Animal Crossing (Simulation | Cube)\n\n-- Backyard Baseball (Sports | Multi)\n\n-- Dora the Explorer: Return to the Purple Planet (Adventure | Multi)\n\n-- Frequency (Music | PS2)\n\n-- LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game (Action | Multi)\n\n-- Mario Kart DS (Racing | DS)\n\n-- Meteos (Puzzle | DS)\n\n-- Nintendogs (Virtual Pet | DS)\n\n-- Spyro: A Hero's Tail (Platformer | Multi)\n\n-- We Love Katamari (Action | PS2)\n\nWhat would you recommend for middle-schoolers?\n\nWhen kids hit the 11- to 13-year mark, they start going through some big changes. Their ability to reason and make witty retorts to your attempts to calm them down increases ten-fold (just ask my mother). Puberty may even begin for some in this group as well, but regardless, kids of this age often have more self-doubt than at any other period and their desire to hang out with friends over family amplifies. Expect children of this group to want to broaden their genre horizons more and expect an increase in the desire to play multiplayer games.\n\nListed below are ten recent games that would be ideal for tweens, followed by their genre and system they appear on (Click on a title for more information).\n\n-- Ape Escape 3 (Action | PS2)\n\n-- Chibi Robo (Plaformer | Cube)\n\n-- Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 (Music | PS2)\n\n-- Electroplankton (Music | DS)\n\n-- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Adventure | Multi)\n\n-- The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap (Adventure | GBA)\n\n-- Mario Party 7 (Party | Cube)\n\n-- Mario Super Baseball (Sports | Cube)\n\n-- Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves (Platform | PS2)\n\n-- Zuma: Deluxe (Puzzle | X360)\n\nMy kid is in high school, what's ideal for that age group?\n\nSelf-absorbed, hormone crazy, and full of angst. No, I'm not talking about IGN editors, but rather, teenagers of the 14- to 17-year-old variety. Of course, by now your child will probably want to go out with his friends and play videogames at their house more than yours, but that's all part of growing up. At this point, a teen will likely want to play all the M-rated titles they've heard about from their friends and sites like ours, but if it isn't allowed in your house there's still plenty of great software to enjoy.\n\nListed herein are ten recent games that teens should get a major kick out of, followed by their genre and system they appear on (Click on a title for more information).\n\n-- Burnout Revenge (Racing | Multi)\n\n-- Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King (RPG | PS2)\n\n-- Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance (SRPG | Cubei)\n\n-- Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved (Shooter | X360)\n\n-- Guitar Hero (Music | PS2)\n\n-- Madden NFL 06 (Sports | Multi)\n\n-- Ratchet: Deadlocked (Action | PS2)\n\n-- TOCA Race Driver 3 (Racing | Multi)\n\n-- Tony Hawk's American Wasteland (Sports | Multi)\n\n-- Ultimate Spider-Man (Action | Multi)\n\nWhat games are best to play along with my children?\n\nThere are a lot of benefits to playing games with your kids. Not only will you have a bit of fun yourself, but you'll be able to monitor what they're doing and teach them the value of teamwork all at the same time. The good news is that there are plenty of kid-friendly co-op and competitive games that you can play with your children right now. Many of which are listed above. Here are just a few worth checking out:\n\n-- Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 (Music | PS2)\n\n-- LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game (Action | Multi)\n\n-- Mario Kart DS (Racing | DS)\n\n-- Mario Party 7 (Party | Cube)\n\n-- Meteos (Puzzle | DS)\n\nIn regards to children, is any one system better than another?\n\nWhile the politically correct answer is to tell you no, the real answer to this question is definitely, \"Anything Nintendo.\" In the handheld and console markets, the loveable Japanese publisher / developer has done a terrific job of creating a number of platforms that the whole family can enjoy regardless of their age.\n\nIGN Vice-President of Publishing (and father of three) Peer Schneider had this to add about the popular Japanese giant, \"The Nintendo 64 is still the best kids system around. It has a good selection of all-access games and my children can't scratch carts like they can discs.\"\n\nIf you're the patient type, chances are good that the upcoming Nintendo Revolution will end up becoming the ultimate family gaming console. With backwards compatibility with every Nintendo console ever (including the very \"kid friendly\" NES) and a unique multi-purpose controller, its possibilities are definitely enticing.\n\nIs there a rating system that outlines gaming content?\n\nThere sure is. The Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) is the industry's self-governing body for interactive software. The group has been in operation for nearly 12 years now (previously known as the ISDA) and assigns more than 1000 ratings per year. Thus far, almost 600 publishers have submitted their products to the ESRB and in 2005, 55% of the software that came through sanctions was granted an \"Everyone\" Rating or lower.\n\nWhat does that mean? Shown below is the ESRB software rating system as described on its official website.\n\nEarly Childhood\n\nTitles rated EC (Early Childhood) have content that may be suitable for ages 3 and older. Contains no material that parents would find inappropriate\n\nEveryone\n\nTitles rated E (Everyone) have content that may be suitable for ages 6 and older. Titles in this category may contain minimal cartoon, fantasy or mild violence and/or infrequent use of mild language.\n\nEveryone 10+\n\nTitles rated E10+ (Everyone 10 and older) have content that may be suitable for ages 10 and older. Titles in this category may contain more cartoon, fantasy or mild violence, mild language, and/or minimal suggestive themes.\n\nTeen\n\nTitles rated T (Teen) have content that may be suitable for ages 13 and older. Titles in this category may contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood and/or infrequent use of strong language.\n\nMature\n\nTitles rated M (Mature) have content that may be suitable for persons ages 17 and older. Titles in this category may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content, and/or strong language.\n\nAdults Only\n\nTitles rated AO (Adults Only) have content that should only be played by persons 18 years and older. Titles in this category may include prolonged scenes of intense violence and/or graphic sexual content and nudity.\n\nRating Pending\n\nTitles listed as RP (Rating Pending) - have been submitted to the ESRB and are awaiting final rating. (This symbol appears only in advertising prior to a game's release.)\n\nIn addition to the blanket ratings above, the ESRB also accompanies each designation with a series of descriptors to explain why it received its final rating. Descriptor types indicate if the game includes blood, violence, suggestive themes, use of drugs, and almost 30 other kinds of objectionable content.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery parent has a different rearing style and no two children are the same, but it is still my sincerest hope that this article has helped you, even if slightly, with your ultimate decisions regardless of what they are. Good luck, have fun, and happy gaming."
