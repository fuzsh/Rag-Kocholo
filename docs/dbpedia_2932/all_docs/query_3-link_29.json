        "text": "The mere thought that we’ve seen the last of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin and Gollum is almost too much. If we must say goodbye, though, it’s best to do it when all involved are at the top of their game.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A | Jun 10, 2024\n\nFor all its titanic technical breakthroughs and iconic moments of spectacle, its thematic resonance and sweeping storytelling have helped maintain its legacy beyond similar blockbusters.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 10/10 | Dec 27, 2023\n\nDepictions of true friendship in movies are rare. Depictions of male friendship, even rarer. With The Lord of the Rings, audiences saw trust and affection develop between men brought together by a common purpose.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Nov 3, 2023\n\nIt is a film of epic proportions, huge in scale and filled with moments of violence and emotion. But it is also an intimate and emotional experience, in which many viewers will end up shedding several tears. Full review in Spanish.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Sep 4, 2023\n\nThe extendedversion of \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" doesn't feel any longer than the film everybody saw at the multiplex. There's 50 extra minutes of never-before-seen footage added into the original theatrical release.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 28, 2023\n\nA glorious and satisfactory close to one of the best film trilogies of all time. Peter Jackson's third entry is his biggest in scope, and also his most emotional. For Frodo! [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Mar 4, 2023\n\n... a blood and thunder finale that takes the viewer into a conflict of (quite literally) Middle-Earth shattering dimensions. If anything, Peter Jackson and his collaborators try to do too much with the final book of J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy trilogy.\n\nFull Review | Jul 9, 2022\n\nPeter Jackson's place in cinematic history is cemented with The Return of the King and now Star Wars seems like a film made a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Apr 17, 2019\n\nThis atavistic Christians-vs-Moors narrative doesn't belong in the present day, and that's no doubt why so many people are addicted to it: it's so ideologically overstated that it can easily be brushed off as harmlessly quaint escapism.\n\nFull Review | Feb 28, 2018\n\nThe sense of closure is exquisite, but I'm not sure I'm able to forgive Peter Jackson for the three years that he has taken to put it on the screen. The wait has been excruciating.\n\nFull Review | Feb 27, 2018\n\n[It[ almost needs no review. If you liked, or disliked, either of the first two films, this one offers more of the same, with the emphasis on the \"more.\"\n\nFull Review | Feb 27, 2018"
