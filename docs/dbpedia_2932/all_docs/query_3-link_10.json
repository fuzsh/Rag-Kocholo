        "text": "Ok... maybe not all, but 4 out of 6 on the PS2 ain't bad!\n\nAlso this\n\nANd i had a pretty good time with this one, even though it's Sequel is pretty underwhelming (well the Story of the first one ended with a wet fart... but still! )\n\nAnd well, i can't vouch for the Portable ones, i know there are quite a few on the GBA, like this one with a Cool ass box!\n\nThere are also the Lego Games which are... Lego Games... so that's not bad. Doesn't mean they are amazing either... they are just.... Lego Games.\n\nAs the releases became less frequent over time and after the Hobbit trilogy failed to gain traction, i think it's fair to say that on the law of Averages, the games became worst over time. But still, for such a big franchise that had so many releases, it's quite interesting to note how some of these 1) aged just fine and are still fun. 2) Maintained a good quality level overall.\n\nOf course, there are duds and im sure quite a few of you can point out some.... like the moba one........ but all and all, The Lord of The Rings is a solid franchise in the gaming space it seems!\n\nI recently got my hands on the full set of PS2 titles and plan on going back to play them soon enough. These aren't big games, ranging between 5 to 9 hours each, except for the RPG's . Those are quite a bit longer. But seems like a good time is about to be had.\n\nSo, before there was Shadow of Mordor, did you played these games? Any lost gems or memories from the franchise?\n\nLOTR was indeed the lucky one out of the many franchises that mainly received trash. Harry Potter got some decent games, too, but nothing stellar as far as I remember. The Matrix got multiple games, but at the end of the day all disappointed for one reason or another (I personally enjoyed them, but the jank was real). Stuff like Avatar, Bourne, Wanted, etc. from last-gen were serviceable if rather forgettable experiences. The same can be said for Tron, but at least that got the absolutely amazing and criminally forgotten Tron 2.0. James Bond is one that got multiple great games, but also some duds in the process. Overall it's probably safe to say the LOTR movies (while not all the games are based on the movies but on the books, it's quite obvious how the movies pushed the series to a massive mainstream popularity) received the highest quality for licensed games on average (out of the series that got a reasonable amount of games, especially), and probably the only franchise to get some really great games to boot as wel. Except maybe Mad Max or smaller games like the one for The Mummy reboot.\n\nObviously forgot Star Wars, which generated so many damn games that it's almost its own genre at this point. There have been amazing games, meh games, and some unholy turds as well there, so on average I wouldn't count them ahead of LOTR. But that series definitely produced the most quality in terms of numbers.\n\nThat GBA game is trash. I don't like to be so rude typically, but I got it as a gift and forced myself to play as far as I could. Very little to redeem besides the box art.\n\nI don't know about the one in the OP, but Two Towers (by EA, based on the film) for GBA was a pretty great Diablo clone given the platform, it obviously was dumbed down compared to Diablo games but I had a lot of fun playing it. It basically retold the story from the perspective of several characters, each of which represented a different class with different abilities and skill progression and there was quite a lot of collectibles to facilitate replays.\n\nE: For what it's worth, it was made by Griptonite Games, the company behind the equally surprisingly good Harry Potter GBC games (full-blown RPGs, curiously enough probably the best video game adaptations of the Harry Potter series)\n\nI don't know about the one in the OP, but Two Towers (by EA, based on the film) for GBA was a pretty great Diablo clone given the platform, it obviously was dumbed down compared to Diablo games but I had a lot of fun playing it.

But the fellowship based on the book sadly can't conpare to those."
