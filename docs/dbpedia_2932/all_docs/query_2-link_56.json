Square Enix released its first direct sequel in the Final Fantasy and showed off Final Fantasy XII for the first time.

The first titles of the notorious Capcom Five failed to make much of an impact over the year, but Capcom countered with an impressive unveiling of Onimusha 3 and a surprising Resident Evil Outbreak. All this in a year that should be small beans compared to 2004.\n\nBelow, you'll find sales information for the entire year, a Famitsu survey with Japan's biggest publishers and the third annual IGN Japan awards.\n\nFAMITSU JOUHOU GO!\n\nAnother underage cutie takes the cover honors for issue 788 of Famitsu. That's J-Pop and K-Pop sensation Boa looking so innocent and pure on the cover of the magazine. Boa, who turned 17 on 11/5 of last year, is one of Japan's favorite singers, having made the move over from Korea in mid 2001. Unlike many of the girls who appear on Famitsu covers, Boa actually has some relation to the gaming world -- she'll be providing the theme song for Koei's Sengoku Musou.\n\nAside from the few pages towards the back of the magazine featuring pictures of Boa, this week's issue has a couple of game announcements. Let's explore:\n\nWinning Eleven 7 International: Winning Eleven 7 was one of 2003's million sellers, just as Winning Eleven 6 was to 2002. As it did with Winning Eleven 6: Final Evolution, Konami is bringing back Winning Eleven 7 under a new name, Winning Eleven 7 International.\n\nNew features to the game include an option for six different languages and new clubs like Juventus and Feyenoord operating under their real names. The Japanese national team has increased to 45 players. You can now edit your goal keeper uniform and even stadiums. On top of this are new animations, new uniforms and 129 faces added to the face edit mode. This is the first Winning Eleven game to ship on a DVD-ROM, suggesting that the volume should be huge.\n\nJust as over 600,000 people bought into Final Evolution, we don't doubt that International will be a huge hit. A release is set for 2/19.\n\nBomberman Kart DX: Hudson brings a sequel to 2001's Bomberman Kart to the PS2. The numbers of courses and characters have increased, and the graphics have been improved. It also looks like Hudson will be including a mode of traditional Bomberman delights -- sure to be a reason many people pick up the game in the first place. A release is set for 4/29.\n\nFollowing weeks and weeks of massive weekly review lists, the Famitsu review crew was apparently able to take a break, as this week's issue has just two games reviewed. Next week should see a return to normal.\n\nDai San Teigoku Kyobouki, Global A Entertainment, PS2: 7,5,7,5\n\nIsland of the Kaijuu, Sega, GCN: 7,7,7,6\n\nWe'll of course have to pick up Island of the Kaijuu, as it's made by Ancient, the company run by Mr. Yuzo Koshiro!\n\nFAMITSU SALES MATOME\n\nBefore we get to the 2003 IGN Japanese Game Awards, let's take a look at every hardcore fanboy's favorite thing in the whole wide world: game sales.\n\nThe latest issue of Famitsu contains Japanese sales totals for hardware and software in the year 2003. First, the software. If you can remember far back enough, this year's winners should come as no surprise. Here's the top ten, listed as game name, publisher, platform, sales in 2003 and release date:\n\nYEAR 2003 TOP 100 (1 - 10)\n\n1. Final Fantasy X-2, Square Enix, PS2: 1,941,727 (3/13/2003)\n\n2. Pocket Monster Ruby & Saphire, Pokemon, GBA: 1,704,458 (11/21/2002)\n\n3. Shin Sangokushi Musou 3, Koei, PS2: 1,178,455 (2/27/2003)\n\n4. Winning Eleven 7, Konami, PS2: 1,085,082 (8/7/2003)\n\n5. Minna no Golf 4, SCE, PS2: 875,252 (11/27/2003)\n\n6. Dragon Quest Monsters, Square Enix, GBA: 593,458 (3/29/2003)\n\n7. Gundam: Meguri Ai Sora, Bandai, PS2: 577,972 (11/7/2003)\n\n8.

Dragon Ball Z, Bandai, PS2: 543,312 (2/13/2003)\n\nThere's no stopping Square Enix! But don't discount Pokemon Ruby & Saphire which came in second despite having seen release last November. The totals for the Nintendo game were 4,902,220 until the end of 2003, and have since topped the five million mark. Koei comes in with Shin Sangokushi Musou at number 3 and Konami with World Soccer Winning Eleven 7 at number 4.\n\nInterestingly, 2004 has a similar list of games that could end up forming the top four. Will next year's list see Final Fantasy XII at the top followed by Pokemon Red and Green, Sengoku Musou and Winning Eleven 8? Of course, Gran Turismo 4 should end up somewhere in there as well.\n\nThe remainder of the list is as follows:\n\nYEAR 2003 TOP 100 (11 - 100)\n\n11. Rockman EX 4, Capcom, GBA: 535,836 (12/12/2003)\n\n12. Z Gundam, Bandai, PS2: 535,115 (3/12/2003)\n\n13.

Densetsu no Starfee, Nintendo, GBA: 190,920 (9/6/2002)\n\nThis year, Nintendo takes top honors amongst software developers, with 22 titles on the list (26 if you include the Nintendo subsidiary Pokemon which handles Pokemon titles). But check out Square Enix! The company, in its first year of merged operations, managed 14 titles, vaulting it above the rest of the 3rd parties. The year 2003 and 2002 company rankings, which depict how many games the companies had in the top 100, are as follows:\n\nYEAR 2003 COMPANY RANKINGS\n\nNintendo - 22\n\nSquare Enix - 14\n\nBandai - 8\n\nCapcom - 7\n\nSony Computer Entertainment - 7\n\nNamco - 7\n\nKonami - 6\n\nSega - 4\n\nBanpresto - 4\n\nPokemon - 4\n\nYEAR 2002 COMPANY RANKINGS\n\nNintendo - 17\n\nKonami - 9\n\nBandai - 9\n\nCapcom - 8\n\nSony Computer Entertainment - 8\n\nSquare - 6\n\nNamco - 6\n\nEnix - 5\n\nKoei - 5\n\nBanpresto - 5\n\nMuch of this year's software ended up for the PS2, with Sony attaining a 57.2% software share, totalling 19,007,243 titles. Nintendo platforms account for the bulk of the remainder, with GBA getting a 29.3% share on 9,618,796 pieces of software and GameCube managing a 14.5% share on 4,619,029 pieces of software.\n\nIn all, 1079 titles made their way into the Japanese retail scene throughout the course of the year. In terms of specific numbers of games per platform:\n\nYEAR 2003 SOFTWARE/PLATFORM\n\nPlayStation 2: 556\n\nGame Boy Advance: 153\n\nPlayStation: 142 titles\n\nGameCube: 102\n\nXbox: 63\n\nSwan Crystal: 11\n\nDreamcast: 48\n\nGame Boy: 2\n\nNeo Geo: 2\n\nHardware sales matched up with software quite closely over the year. Here's a look at the number of hardware units sold over the year and some trends\n\nYEAR 2003 HARDWARE SALES\n\nPlayStation 2: 2,994,000\n\nGame Boy Advance SP: 2,433,000\n\nGame Boy Advance: 1,180,000\n\nGameCube: 1,040,000\n\nXbox: 97,000\n\nPSone: 61,000\n\nSwan Crystal: 47000\n\nGame Boy Advance SP was released on 2/14 alongside Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The system managed sales of over 200,000 units in its first month, limited largely by supply shortages. Further \"advances\" in hardware units sold came at the release of Shinyaku Seiken Densetsu on 8/29 and during the Christmas rush.\n\nThe standard GBA, meanwhile, had sales upwards of 500,000 units in its first month of sales for 2003, but dropped off considerably with the release of the SP. Its sales curve matches that of the GBA-SP, although down a few notches in numbers.\n\nCube had a bumpy year. The release of the Game Boy Player on 3/21 saw a jump to nearly 50,000 pieces of hardware in March, following a drop to 30,000 in February. The Enjoy Plus Pack in June followed by Crystal Chronicle's release on 8/8 took the hardware to 100,000 units sold for August. The price drop to 14000 yen didn't see immediate effect on 10/17, but the system shot up towards the end of the year.\n\nPlayStation 2 actually saw a sales drop between January and February, with a rebound to 300,000 units sold in March to coincide with the 3/13 release of Final Fantasy X-2. The PlyaStation BB Unit package, released on 6/12 brought about a slight sales increase, but the big surge happened at the end of the year when SCE lowered the system's price down to 19800 yen and released its popular racing pack.\n\nXbox sales are low-scale here in Japan, so sales \"surges\" amount to just a few additional thousand units sold in a given month. The Cash Back campaign on 5/29 and the release of Dino Crisis 3 on 6/26 saw one such surge, with a similar surge following the 11/20 price drop to 16800 yen and the release of the 19800 yen Platinum Pack.\n\nOverall, according to numbers provided by Enterbrain, Famitsu's parent company, 2003 saw a shrinking of the videogame market by 7.7%. Most of this is accounted for by a 25% drop in hardware sales, with software sales having risen 1.2% from year 2002.\n\nFAMITSU ANKETTO GET!\n\nAnd, just to make you wait a little bit longer before you see what IGN Japan thought of this year's batch of Japanese titles, here's a survey found on the pages of Famitsu. This survey was conducted with videogame companies, most of whom chose to remain anonymous in their responses to the magazine.\n\nQ: What kind of year was 2003 for games?\n\n(Responses: 92)\n\nGood: 27 compaines\n\nBad: 41 companies\n\nNormal: 24 companies\n\nFor companies responding \"Good,\" companies F and T point to lots of smash hits and big titles. Company A mentions that Online titles have come into fruition. A company called GN Software cites the fact that it was able to start off in the game biz.\n\nAmongst companies responding \"Bad,\" Company B points to the bankruptcy of Digicube while developer Arika points to a lack of hits and big titles.\n\nOnly one interesting response from companies responding \"Normal.\" Company P states that while there was a slowdown, they were able to push software of the \"Boys Love\" genre. Hmm... what company could this \"Company P\" be?\n\nQ: What will happen to the year 2004 game market?\n\n(Responses: 86)\n\nGrow stronger: 25 companies\n\nCan't expect much: 19 companies\n\nWon't change: 32 companies\n\nOther: 10 companies\n\nAmongst those who believe a stronger market awaits, company S points to the EyeToy and PSP release while company M points to network-ready games becoming more abundant and big titles like GT4 and FFXII. NEC Interchannel suggests that it will be able to open up titles aimed at girls, including \"Boys Love\" genre titles (ah ha!).\n\nAmong the less favorable responses, company A states that for everyone except the big makers the year will be tough, while company S believes that there's nothing but sequels down the road and that getting acceptance for new titles should be tough.\n\nQ: What companies caught your attention in 2003?\n\n(Responses: 87)\n\nSquare Enix: 21 companies\n\nNintendo: 12 companies\n\nKonami: 9 companies\n\nCapcom: 7 companies\n\nKoei: 5 companies\n\nCompany M gives Konami credit for its excellent character business. For Capcom, company S points to the release of GTAIII and other overseas titles and the KDDI network business. Koei gets attention from company O due to its fanbase.\n\nQ: What companies are you watching for 2004?\n\n(Responses: 84)\n\nSquare Enix: 17\n\nSony Computer Entertainment: 14\n\nSega: 10\n\nNintendo: 8\n\nCapcom/Koei: 7\n\nSquare Enix gets notice from company G for the release of FFXII's while company B believes the fruits of the merger will finally show. SCE gets attention from company A for the PSP and from company S for the PSX. Company R believes Nintendo's mysterious new E3 product will bring the company back from the dead. For Sega, company E is interested in the relations with Sammy while company K is interested in hearing the company's new battle plan.\n\nQ: Are you developing for the next generation of hardware?\n\n(Responses: 73)\n\nCurrently in development: 4 companies\n\nNot in development: 37 companies\n\nHave plans for development: 32 companies\n\nQ: Into what hardware will you place your resources for 2004?\n\n(Responses: 77, multiple responses okay)\n\nPlayStation 2: 52\n\nPC: 24\n\nCell phone: 20\n\nGame Boy Advance: 19\n\nPSP: 15\n\nGame Cube: 11\n\nXbox: 7\n\nPlayStation: 4\n\nDreamcast: 3\n\nArcade: 3\n\nQ: Do you have plans to work with other companies on game development?\n\n(Responses: 76)\n\nInterested: 28\n\nAlready doing so: 25\n\nPlans to do so: 14\n\nNo plans: 9\n\nQ: Do you have plans for a merger?\n\nNo: 56\n\nCurrently Investigating: 3\n\nOutside of these responses, the various companies surveyed provided promises to users. Company S promised that it will make lots of interesting games. Meanwhile, Company N promised to offer new games whose doors are wide and whose center runs deep (as deep as their promise?). Company E promised to reduce delays in its software. Electronic Arts revealed its full name and stated that it aims to get awards in the Famitsu Croww Review. Company G promised to make games that have high originality.\n\nSpecial props to NEC Interchannel who promised to continue to work hard, even on the Dreamcast. Go NEC!\n\nTurn the page for the year 2003 IGN Japan game awards:\n\n2003 GRAND PRIX\n\nWelcome to the year 2003 IGN Japan game awards! First started in 2001 as an excuse to give Shenmue II a \"game of the year\" award, the awards continued to 2002 with Nintendo's Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker taking the top prize.\n\nThis year, we're doing things a bit different. Instead of having just one award for Game of the Year, we're giving awards in multiple categories.\n\nWhatever the category, the requirement is the same. To be qualified, the game has to have been released in Japan but not in America. So, a game like Mario Kart wouldn't qualify because it was released in both America and Japan throughout the course of the year. Other examples of games that don't qualify include Final Fantasy X-2, Virtua Fighter Evolution, Soul Calibur and Mickey Mouse Trick & Chase (which would've been the sure-fire winner of the Kuso-game award had Capcom not given it a stateside release).\n\nWith that in mind, enjoy this year's awards and send any complaints you have to the IGN Japan mailbag. If we receive enough letters we may actually start having a Q&A session answered by Tanaka!\n\nIGN JAPAN GAME OF THE YEAR\n\nSiren\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: SCE\n\nSony Computer Entertainment tapped into some big talent to bring us this new take on horror gaming. The result is a new type of interactive fear that you've never before experienced. The fear is eerily real -- we often found ourselves afraid to move. The brain jacking system is implemented to perfection, offering up a new type of gameplay that will force you to put on your thinking bandanas.\n\nThe game also gets props from IGN Japan for not resorting to \"western\"-looking characters and English dialogue like -- well, like every other survival horror game. Siren takes place in Japan and features Japanese people with Japanese names. From the stages to the character faces, everything was textured using real photography. Playing this game dubbed into English would be kinda like watching a dubbed Japanese movie. And who'd want to do that?\n\nAn often confusing scenario system didn't get in the way of this game leaving the most lasting impression of all games this year.\n\nRUNNER UP\n\nDrag On Dragoon\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nSquare Enix's apparent rip of the Dynasty Warriors series ends up being so much more. A compelling storyline, gameplay time that can be measured in the dozens of hours and the ability to blow away tons of enemies by mounting your flame breathing, flying dragon make this one of the year's best. What's most impressive is the tiny list of credits -- just 17 names -- shown at the back of the game's manual. Can such a small team make such a big game?\n\nBEST PORTABLE GAME\n\nTetsuwan Atom\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nDeveloper: Treasure\n\nSega gets props for turning to Treasure to make this 2D take on the new Astro Boy cartoon. And Treasure gets props for delivering a game that remains faithful to the license while delivering classic boss fights and the multiple forms of gameplay that the company's 2D side has always been known for. No one bought the game here in Japan; let's hope things turn out different in America.\n\nRUNNER UP\n\nSlime Mori Mori Dragon Quest\n\nPublisher: Square Enix\n\nDeveloper: Square Enix\n\nThis may seem like a means of milking the lucrative Dragon Quest license, but Square Enix actually delivered a fantastic title with a unique control scheme, fun story and an illegal level of cuteness. This game is also one of the few quality family titles that doesn't come from Nintendo. Give us a console version!\n\nBEST GRAPHICS\n\n(for game that doesn't suck)\n\nOtogi: Hiyakki Toubatsue Maki\n\nPublisher: From Software\n\nDeveloper: From Software\n\nWe were very much worried towards the end of the year that the full year would go by and we'd have to give Magatama the best graphics award here at the IGN Japan awards. So, we decided to change the name of the award to \"Best Graphics for a game that doesn't suck,\" which disqualifies Magatama, a game that doesn't doesn't suck. Thankfully, Otogi 2 came out and blew Magatama and just about every overseas developed Xbox games as well, away in the visuals department. From Software knows its Xbox.\n\nRUNNER UP\n\nGran Turismo 4 Prologue\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: Polyphony\n\nSome people may argue that Prologue is just a demo and shouldn't be considered for an award. To these people we ask, how do you cope with your communist roots? Demo or not, Prologue is the finest looking PS2 game around and, it can be debated, is the finest looking console racer ever. The car models are certainly unmatched, and at 60 frames per second everything looks smooth. Backgrounds are the only area that could use a bit of work -- we'll see what Polyphony gives us with the final version in 2004.\n\nBEST VISUAL PRESENTATION\n\nBaten Kaitos\n\nPublisher: Namco\n\nDeveloper: Monolith Software\n\nWhile not the most technically impressive title around, Baten Kaitos has one of the most realized world's ever seen in a game. Every section of the world is a sight to behold -- even the overhead map! This is one of the few games, similar to Panzer Dragoon, that's worth buying just for the look of its world alone.\n\nRUNNER UP\n\nMojib Ribbon\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: Nanaonsha\n\nSCE's return to the music scene looks convincingly like it's being drawn by a fountain pen in realtime. A good thing, considering the theme of the game. The character also gets special mention -- he's very cool and grows as you play. Best of all, he can't possibly be worn by cos-players (although we'll probably be proven wrong).\n\nNo one bought Mojib Ribbon here in Japan (making little baby Anoop cry), but lets still pray for an American release so that everyone can experience this cool game from the makers of Parappa, Um Jammer Lammy and Vib Ribbon.\n\nACHIEVEMENT IN AUDIO\n\nMojib Ribbon\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: Nanaonsha\n\nEven if you aren't into hip hop, you can't argue with the technical side of Sony Computer Entertainment's Mojib Ribbon, which has a computerized voice read pre-made song lyrics as you \"write them\" with your pen. The game even allows you to input whole words and make up your own song! The voice doesn't sound realistic, but it fits in wonderfully with the game's theme.\n\nRUNNER UP\n\nSiren\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: SCE\n\nOne area that makes Siren spooky is its sound. It begins with an eerie soundtrack that plays sporadically in the background as you negotiate the levels. Even more haunting, are the grunts and wails the zombies make.\n\nBEST MULTIPLAYER\n\nShibaimichi\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: Bomber eXpress\n\nSo you're like, \"Huh?\". See below for a full explanation of this game which was never covered on IGN and was largely ignored even in Japan.\n\nMOST ORIGINAL\n\nShibaimichi\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nDeveloper: Bomber eXpress\n\nEarly in the year, Sony Computer Entertainment began a brief push for voice recognition games. Shibaimichi was one of the three titles, of which Operator's Side got most of the attention. We ignored Shibaimichi until a few months down the road when we finally got the chance to play it.\n\nKaraoke revolution gets people to get together and sing in front of the videogame screen. Shibaimichi is the acting equivalent, with one or two players acting out a variety of dramatic scenes. One of our favorites involves a high school senior and a younger student meeting on the roof of a building. The student has a crush on the senior and tries to convey her feelings, only to find that the senior is already in a relationship. Other scenes are pulled from outside sources, including two scenes from Romeo and Juliet -- the balcony scene and the dance scene at the Capulet household. The game uses 3D characters to perform the physical side of the acting, with text bubbles indicating what the player should say at a given time. Single player mode has the computer act out one of the parts. The real fun is in two player mode, though, especially if you have people willing to ham it up a bit (and especially if you have people who can actually read Japanese fast enough to keep up with the text -- the game is all Japanese, of course).\n\nLike Karaoke Revolution, the game analyzes your performance, although we've found this area to be mostly BS. Still, this didn't take anything away from Shibaimichi being one of our most favorite multiplayer games of the year and one of the most original titles of the year as well.\n\nWe never wrote about this game, and only a few thousand people picked it up, meaning another excellent original title didn't get any of its due attention.\n\nBEST BABE\n\nHibana (Kunoichi)\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nDeveloper: Overworks\n\nHer game may be a bit too high on the rehash meter, but there's no denying it -- Hibana is hot. We'd love to be killed by her, preferably in the air or on the wings of a plane (but not in a bland sewer). If only her in-game modeled looked as good as the image Overworks cooked up for the instruction manual.\n\nBEST MARKETING CAMPAIGN\n\nSONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT FOR SIREN\n\nA couple of weeks following the release of Siren, stories begain appearing in Japanese newspapers that that the general public had complained to Sony Computer Entertainment that the game's television commercials were too scary and that SCE would be pulling the spots as a result. The company followed up on its promise and the commercials were never seen again.\n\nFrom our perspective, SCE gained the following by doing this:\n\nCovcerage of Siren on national media (the original story appeared in the world's largest circulated newspaper).\n\nA cool in-store marketing weapon, as shown in the above picture that depicts a newspaper article indicating that the commercials were pulled because they were too scary(the above article was actually crafted by SCE). Other stores took it upon themselves to promote the game in this manner.\n\nExtra air time to promote its other games\n\nSo, we're left with the question. Did SCE purposely make a big fuss over a handful of viewer complaints and pull the commercials in order to get more hype for their game? Was this all planned from the start as some sort of clever marketing campaign for Siren?\n\nWhatever the case, the extra push ended up making Siren's sales increase a few weeks after its release, leaving the game with well over 100,000 units sold.\n\nBEST PRESS CONFERENCE\n\nKOEI FOR SENGOKU MUSOU\n\nPress conferences announcing new games have been getting wilder and wilder. Last year, Capcom announced its Capcom Five for the GameCube at Tokyo's Velfarre club, and brought lights and costumes for the games' producers. This year, Koei took their Sengoku Musou presentation to the same club. Members of the press and lucky members of Koei's GameCity fanclub were treated to a mock samurai fight, a Kabuki play presentation and Japanese liquor served by cute girls and handed out to the audience by the company president!\n\nPlus, as a parting gift, Koei gave out delicious choclolate cakes that came in their own dish and wooden box. The stakes have been raised!\n\nCHO KUSO GAME OF THE YEAR\n\n\"Kuso Game\" can translate to \"Crappy Game.\" The phrase is actually the name of a Japanese book that covers, you guessed it, crappy games. \"Cho Kuso Game\" means \"Realy Crappy Game,\" and is the name for the sequel to that book covering even crappier games (Death Crimson is on the cover).\n\nWe decided to call our \"Worst Game of the Year\" award the \"Cho Kuso Game of the Year\" award because we're cool like that.\n\nThe following are our Cho Kuso Game of the Year award recipients. These games aren't presented in order. They're all equally bad and should be burried in a desert (but for the record, Transformers is the worst of the bunch).\n\nTransformers\n\nFirst off, don't confuse this with the Transformers: Aramada game being developed for the American market. The Transformers game we speak of is the Takara-produced trash based off the original television show. Everything about this game is bad, from the graphics to the poorly implemented gameplay. It's sad that the original, infinitely superior television show gets an infinitely inferior game. Such is business.\n\nGlass Rose\n\nThis Capcom game bases its existence on its star character Masahiro Matsuoka from J-Pop group Tokio. Not only is Matsuoka a horrible actor in either real or digital life, but the game ended up being a lame attempt at making a point and click adventure. Sierra was doing point and click adventures far better over a decade ago.\n\nSega Ages 2500: Golden Axe\n\nThis Sega Ages update of the original Golden Axe first proved to us that something was amiss in Sega Ages land. Horrible 3D graphics and a development team that apparently forgot what made the original cool make for one of the year's worst games, even at the price of 2500 yen. Worst of all, they didn't include the original title in its unadulterated form. Shame.\n\nN.U.D.E@: Natural Ultimate Digital Experiment\n\nNote to developers -- do not use the word \"Ultimate\" in the title for your game if it's going to be as lame as this. Red Entertainment and Microsoft hyped this game as allowing you to train a character to speak. You aren't doing anything of the sort. In fact, Sony Computer Entertainment's Operator's Side has far better voice recognition! It's better than Nezmix, though, so maybe Microsoft Japan is getting better at their Japanese games.\n\nYs 1&2\n\nPorting a 2D game that isn't that technically impressive in the first place to the PS2 should be easy. But somehow, Digicub's Team Digi managed to screw it up, giving us an unrefined game with bad load times. Alas, another generation will miss out on the original Ys 1&2 whose story is the stuff of legends. Hopefully, Konami will handle the series better on the console end of things.\n\nAnd on that note of ugliness, we conclude the year 2003 IGN Japan game awards. Send all complaints and differences of opinion to the IGN Japan mailbag. You could contribute to the restarting of Q&A at IGN Japan!\n\nTurn the page for the latest charts.\n\nCHARTS\n\nWhat's hot in the Japanese gaming scene? This section of IGN Japan column will bring you the latest charts from Japan for hardware, software and (the very stagnant) arcades, along with the top thirty most wanted software list. We've sourced Enterbrain for the software sales charts, Media Create for the hardware charts and Famitsu for the most wanted and arcade charts. Check back every week to find out what Japanese gamers are into!\n\nGAME SALES\n\n(1/5 to 1/11)\n\nMegaman continues to flex his popularity as Gran Turismo 4 Prologue, thanks in part to its inclusion in the PS2 Racing Pack crosses the 600,000 mark. This is already above SCE's original sales expectations of 500,000 units. Throughout the chart, Nintendo's strong holiday season shows as many GameCube games make a strong appearance. Could Mario Kart eventually cross the million mark?\n\n1. Rockman EX4, Capcom, GBA: 40,230 (681,992 since 12/12)\n\n2. Gran Turismo 4 Prologue, SCE, PS2: 39,293 (635,751 since 12/4)\n\n3.

Good lord... don't mention the horse racing games!\n\nThis Import release section of IGN Japan will help you sort through the mess. Note that we try our best to include every game included in Famitsu's upcoming release list, but if its kanji is too tough, or if it resembles anything approaching Mahjong, you probably won't find it in this space.\n\nCheck back every week for the latest!\n\nPS2\n\n1/15/2003\n\nSaikyo Toudai Shougo 2004 (Mainichi Communications)\n\nSega Ages 2500: Bonanza Brothers (3D Ages)\n\nAnubis Zone of the Enders Special Edition (Konami)\n\nAnubis Zone of the Enders Special Edition - LE (Konami) 1/22/2003\n\nUchuu no Stelvia (Bandai)\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Atari)\n\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (ESP)\n\nThe Sims (Electronic Arts)\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Electronic Arts)\n\nFu-un Shinsen Gumi (Genki)\n\nKurogane no Houkou 2: Warship Commander (Koei)\n\nKurogane no Houkou 2: Warship Commander & Warship Gunner (Koei)\n\nCho Battle Fuushin - Koei the Best (Koei)\n\nFuushin Engi 2 - Koei the Best (Koei)\n\nNobunaga no Yanou Arashi Seiki - Koei the Best (Koei)\n\nStar Ocean 3 Till the End of Time Director's Cut (Square Enix)\n\nSuper Lite 2000 Puzzle Crossword (Success)\n\nConvoy Densetsu (Spike)\n\nNebula Echo Night (Genki)\n\nSimple 2000 Series Ultimate Vol. 16 (D3 Publisher)\n\nSimple 2000 Series Vol. 44 (D3 Publisher)\n\nPhantom Brave (Nippon Software)\n\nPhantom Brave - LE (Nippon Software)\n\n1/29/2003\n\nShin Megamitensei III Nocturne Maniacs (Atlus)\n\nHajime no Ippou 2 Victorious Road (ESP)\n\nSecret Weapons Over Normandy (Electronic Arts)\n\nAir Force Delta Blue Wing Knights (Konami)\n\nShikigami no Shiro 2 (Taito)\n\nShikigami no Shiro 2 - LE (Taito)\n\nBomberman Jetters - Hudson the Best (Hudson)\n\nAfter (Pione Soft)\n\nAfter - LE (Pione Soft)\n\nRhapsody (Marvelous Entertainment)\n\nRhapsody - LE (Marvelous Entertainment)\n\nExciting Pro Wrestling 5 (Yukes)\n\nExciting Pro Wrestling 5 - LE (Yukes)\n\nGun Grave - Red Selection (Red Entertainment)\n\nGameCube\n\n1/15/2004\n\nIsland of the Kajuu (Sega)\n\n1/22/2004\n\n1080 Silver Storm (Nintendo)\n\nThe Sims (EA)\n\nGakuen Toushi (Idea Factory)\n\n1/29/2004\n\nBomberman Jetters - Hudson the Best (Hudson)\n\n2/11/2004\n\n007 Everything Or Nothing (Electronic Arts)\n\n2/19/2004\n\nLegend of Zelda: 4 Swords+ (Nintendo)\n\n2/26/2004\n\nRogue Ops (Kemco)\n\n3/4/2004\n\nRobocop Aratanaru Kiki (Titus Japan)\n\nCustom Robo for GameCube (Nintendo)\n\n3/11/2004\n\nMetal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (Konami)\n\n3/24/2004\n\nPuyo Puyo Fever (Sega)\n\nGameBoy Advance\n\n1/8/2004\n\nLord of the Rings Return of the King (EA)\n\n1/22/2004\n\nThe Sims (EA)\n\n1/23/2004\n\nGyakuten Saiban 3 (Capcom)\n\n1/29/2004\n\nPocket Monsters Fire Red w/Wireless Adapter (Pokemon)\n\nPocket Monsters Leaf Green w/Wireless Adapter (Pokemon)\n\n2/5/2004\n\nYugioh Dual Monsters Expert 3 (Konami)\n\nYugioh Dual Monsters Beginners Pack (Konami)\n\n2/11/2004\n\n007: Everything or Nothing (Electronic Arts)\n\n2/12/2004\n\nLilipart Oukoku (Sega)\n\n3/18/2004\n\nTennis no Oujisama 2004 Glorious Gold (Konami)\n\nTennis no Oujisama 2004 Stylish Silver (Konami)\n\nMermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Peach (Konami)\n\nYugioh Soroku no Sugoroku (Konami)\n\n3/26/2004\n\nDragon Ball Z (Banpresto)\n\nRikachan no Oshare Nikki (Marvelous Interactive)\n\nXBOX\n\n1/15/2004\n\nPlus Plum 2 (Takuyo)\n\n1/22/2004\n\nUnreal Championship - Xbox World Collection (Microsoft)\n\nNBA Inside Drive 2004 - Xbox World Collection (Microsoft)\n\nHunter the Reckoning - Redeemer - Xbox World Collection (Microsoft)\n\n1/29/2004\n\nAutomodelista US Tuned (Capcom)\n\nBreakdown (Namco)\n\n2/26/2004\n\nNinja Gaiden (Tecmo)\n\nTekki Taisen (Capcom)\n\nTekki Taisen w/controller (Capcom)\n\nTenku-2 (Microsoft)\n\nRogue Ops (Kemco)\n\nSOME TIME IN MARCH\n\nDead or Alive Online (Tecmo)\n\n3/26/2004\n\nDronZ (Metro 3D Japan)\n\n4/24/2004\n\nPuyo Puyo Fever (Sega)\n\nTurn the page for the IGN Japan archive.\n\nBACK NUMBERS\n\nDid you miss an issue of IGN Japan because you were too ignorant to join IGN Insider earlier than now?
