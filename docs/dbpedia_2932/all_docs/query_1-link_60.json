        "text": "1\n\nfenlix\n\nSaGa gang, we won! Emerald Beyond is the highest-rated game of this week batch of reviews!\n\nPdt: kinda suprising this game is arriving to switch this late, I think it has been available on pc for quite a while.\n\n2\n\nN64-ROX\n\nNice stealth Steamed Hams reference there!\n\n3\n\nTotalHenshin\n\n@N64-ROX Can you pinpoint the reference? I couldn’t find it in the text.\n\n4\n\nTotsuTGR\n\nLibrary of Ruina is one of my favourite games ever made, so I will certainly hold bias here\n\nBut I feel as if this review truly doesn't do the game justice.\n\nHaving played the game on PC, I can't comment on the menus, but the story is certainly excellent. Your complaints about characters immediately being killed off are somewhat understandable, but not necessarily true later on. Characters can and do get further development and those that don't serve to build the narrative further. Every single reception holds narrative importance and they all form a cohesive whole later on.\n\nAnother facet of the game that hasn't been commented on is the music. In my opinion, it's excellent. Studio EIM and Mili truly outdid themselves and to see no mention of them whatsoever saddens me.\n\nAnd the combat is more than similar to other deck builders, the effects and Cards available grow more unique and complex as time goes on. Most notable are the EGO pages, which can define the course of an entire reception\n\nWhatever the case, I urge you to spend a longer period of time on the game. Even with clunky UI it is certainly worth it\n\nAnd for prospecting buyers, read more than just this review. Almost all are in praise of this game, this seems to be the sole outlier.\n\n5\n\ntk0001\n\nLooking at the screenshots and content, this review was likely writen with 5 hours of gameplay? Claims like \"Rushed Cutscenes\", \"indistinct characters\" and \"card-based combat system that will click with you pretty quickly\" show a pretty superficial read of the game.\n\nThis is such a bad review that I can just honestly recommend to check the Steam page. No interface problems there and lots of people who have actually spent hours on it to analyze its upsides and failures.\n\n.\n\nEdit: Sheesh, no need for all the spam down there. Anyway, it's clear for anyone that played the game that reviewer haven't pushed through the 5 hours mark. And it is totally fine to play for a few hours and decide they don't like what they've seen. Relatable, even. But it does not make for a good review.\n\n(They would have known for example, that although the Chef was dead, the story surrounding them was far from over and would go on for many chapters still. Also, no mentions to the songs made by Mili band and the fact that Library of Ruina follows a previous game, Lobotomy Corporation, shows no research was made).\n\n6\n\nN64-ROX\n\n@TotalHenshin perhaps it's just me, but I'm looking at the subheadline \"my library's in ruins\" and the only thing I can possibly think of is \"my roast is ruined!\"\n\nBut then again I'm a Steamed Hams tragic who still loves this meme in 2024, I'm probably just seeing it everywhere...\n\n7\n\nVyacheslav333\n\nWhy not a single word about the quality of voice-overs? This game features Korean original voice-overs and a Japanese dub.\n\n8\n\nTotalHenshin\n\n@N64-ROX I could see that being what the author meant to reference. Thanks for the response!\n\n9\n\nSolomon_Rambling\n\nThis is one of the first reviews I’ve read that acknowledges the reviewer didn’t finish the game. I can’t imagine a reviewer putting over a hundred hours into the game, but I do wonder what’s a good stopping point. Thirty hours? Fifty hours?\n\nReviewing games is a tough job, one I usually envy but not in this case.\n\n10\n\nArchange\n\nI do have some bias however this is a complete joke of a review. while yes it a very long game and its not to be expected that the reviewer will play all 100+ hours of main story content, its more realistic that they play at least the first 1/4 to 1/3 of the game. 5 hours is hardly leaving the \"tutorial\" where the game takes it easy on you. their points on a sluggish menu? if you read what the game tells you in and after the first reception (level) it tells you not only how to navigate them and always shows how to navigate the menus, AND it also tells you how to minimize the information on some menus. rushed cutscenes? if you pay any attention to what's going on in the cutscenes you can tell a lot of time and effort went into making not only the artwork of the cutscene but also the dialogue to match each character. small text while yes is a bit of an issue its only really an issue with the port and will likely be fixed in an update, on the pc version there is no issue with text size. the biggest joke about this review is the \"slow overall story\" while yes, some parts can be a little slow it's important to keep in mind it is a DENSE story, trying to speed parts of the story up would to be like making a 2-hour movie on the entire lord of the rings trilogy. if you want a more accurate review of the game it would be better to look them up on YouTube (be mindful you might get spoiled a bit) or look for steam reviews that are less memey.\n\nhowever, if you don't feel like looking for those it is a great game 9/10 however it isn't for everyone, if you don't like visual novel esc games, VERY difficult experiences, or reading this game is not for you. however, if you do get it, the game will quickly grow on you. you do not need to play the previous game Lobotomy Corporation to understand the lore and it has some incredibly engaging story lines, gameplay, and amazing music. While Library of Ruina is not a perfect game, it's important to remember that there is no such thing as a perfect game. every game has its flaws but as long as you can enjoy the game it doesn't matter if its 'imperfect'. You enjoy it and that's all that matters.\n\n11\n\nLogiepogey07\n\nBest content is in SOTC and Impuritas. It is slow, but the buildup is VERY worth it.\n\nPlease play it to completion.\n\n12\n\namongusnyanyan\n\nRemoved - unconstructive feedback\n\n13\n\nSolomon_Rambling\n\nHoly geez, there are some vicious commenters here. @chas_mke, it seems you managed to upset an entire fandom. The good news is somebody obviously shared your review, and now Nintendo Life has five new users.\n\nEdit: Make that six.\n\nEdit 2: Ten now. Maybe the screenshots are from the first five hours to avoid spoilers? The mystery continues…\n\nEdit 3: A veritable mob now. What started off as passingly interesting is now disheartening.\n\n14\n\nStarryEnty\n\nThis feels like someone reviewing Sherlock Holmes and claiming the book is bad because they've only read the first 5 chapters.\n\nTrust me, once you meet Philip, you will Wish. That these characters are disposable.\n\n15\n\nUnnamedEntity\n\nYou really did just play 5 hours skipping the text in a story heavy game, did you?\n\n16\n\nThe-Red-Mist\n\nGreat Split: Vertical\n\n17\n\nENTERTHENAME\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots provided the Reviewer has only made it to Urban Myth level (Still the tutorial) Which is only roughly 5 hours of gameplay (reminder that In the review he said the average play time was 120-250 hours) this is an abysmally small amount of time to play a game before writing a review Especially one so heavily focused on story\n\n18\n\nHeeHoo\n\nI was genuinely irritated with this review that I created this account just so I can leave a comment about how TERRIBLE it is.\n\nThe tiny text and dense menus I can understand due to the fact that this is the Nintendo Switch port of the game and obviously there would be issues like this since Library of Ruina was meant to be played on a bigger screen like on the PC.\n\nHowever I can't forgive you for criticising the game when you've clearly barely played it. Some other people here already mentioned how you obviously, OBVIOUSLY, didn't even put the time and effort to play the game. Your review is unjust, and is quite blatantly misinformations.\n\nWhy are you even reviewing this game in the first place when you can't even be bothered to play it?\n\nEdit:\n\nI re-read the review again, hoping that my eyes were indeed playing tricks but instead I just discover even worse takes as I read it again and again.\n\nWhat was on your mind when you compared this game's book burning mechanics to Persona 5?! I had to do a double take because I genuinely cannot fathom anyone thinking that they're in any way similar at all.\n\nSafe to say, just like what my other fellow commenters mentioned, I'm most likely never going to trust any reviews from this site again if this is the kind of awful quality review it produces.\n\n19\n\nBlue-Reverberation\n\n@Pluto Gather everyone here, please.\n\n20\n\nReborn_Wraith\n\n@Solomon_Rambling At the risk of sounding like a jerk, that's because the review of the game was rushed at best and outright misrepresentative at worst. (also, make that 7. Congrats to the reviewer for enraging me enough to make a new account on a platform I'd never heard of just to state how annoyed I am with the review.)\n\nMy personal thoughts on the review are as follows:\n\n> Unfortunately, its scope and length just don't match up; we'd much rather spend extended periods of time with these characters before killing them off so quickly.\n\nYes, that's because you haven't made it out of the tutorial. While there are certainly games that introduce your overarching antagonist in the first 5% of the game, that's not the point of this one. The reasoning of the devs was even written earlier in the review:\n\n> This vicious cycle paints a clear picture about the kind of dour world these characters live in, but it also makes each new group of characters feel disposable and indistinct from one another.\n\nThat is the point of the earlier levels. You form a cursory attachment to these characters, in the short duration of each of their cutscenes, and proceed to kill them like the mooks they are - and make no mistake, they are the equivalent of the City's mooks. The cutscenes make it exhaustively clear that the first few receptions you fight is against the lowest of the low; the City's equivalent of the scum on the bottom of the barrel that aren't even worthy of being called the lowest grade of Fixer.\n\n> In rushing through these opportunities to revel in its world, Library of Ruina often speeds past some of its most compelling moments and characters.\n\nSee above points re: making it out of the hand-holding phases. The review hasn't reached the fights where understanding enemies becomes more important; it's still in the phase where you could be completely braindead and still win the fights. Of course it's not going to dive too deep into the lore; it still assumes you're getting used to how to actually utilize key mechanics in the game.\n\nMy reasoning may be flawed, though, as I haven't played on the Switch version. I played through the entire game on PC, with its apparently superior UI, and kudos to the reviewer for sticking with the UI. Their complaints are likely completely valid, and god knows that I wouldn't have been able to make it out of Urban Myth if I had to deal with unreadable card text. That may have been the reason why the review terminates so abruptly at such an early phase, and for that, I can excuse the tepid dive into the least detailed of the content.\n\nObviously, my opinion is biased. Still, that's my personal opinion on why the above review isn't as representative of the game as it should be.\n\n21\n\nGamerKromer\n\nOthers have called attention to the review's shortcomings. I want to personally thank you for providing this article to us Project Moon fans. Having read this, we—who are renowned for our poor reading comprehension—immediately regret it.\n\n22\n\nMacky100\n\nThis review is so full of inaccuracies, it greatly saddens me as a fan of the series.\n\n\"You play as Roland, a street thug\"\n\nWrong, he is most certainly not a thug. Even avoiding spoilers, he's a fixer, a more generalized mercenary. He's an incredibly detailed and nuanced character, but that is understood as you play the game.\n\n\"attempt to build out the library and uncover its secrets\"\n\nAlso wrong, you're searching for the one true book so that Angela can become human.\n\n\"Small tweaks to this formula pop up here and here, but this card combat is largely familiar.\"\n\nMuch of the combats at later levels are much more puzzle focused as you have to work with new rules that each enemy introduces. Many of the Realizations take this to the extreme.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it treats much of its cast as disposable.\"\n\nI must wonder what the reviewer thought of xiao's powerful story of dedication to a loved one, or Philip's battle with his cowardly and selfish nature, or Yan's despair over his lack of free will.\n\n\"Just like the combat, there's plenty of potential here, but in the hours that we've spent with Library of Ruina, we haven't seen this potential yield much more than hinting at something greater\"\n\nThis has to be the ultimate sin of this review. Did the reviewer get to urban nightmare? it doesn't lean into its potential because its setting up the story. That thing it's hinting at? That's the story being set up, which, naturally, is paid off as the story progresses. That's like the fundamentals of story telling. Its like watching the first 30 minutes of Back to the Future, turn it off, and say \"you know, its got some potential, but that Doc Brown guy just get's shot and dies? Kind of a boring character, he had a lot of potential.\"\n\nThis review really throws into question all the other reviews on this site, I don't think I'll be coming here again anytime soon.\n\n23\n\nMacky100\n\n@Solomon_Rambling\n\nIf this review is indicative of the other reviews on this website, I'm most certainly not gonna be coming here again for any opinions.\n\n24\n\nPotential_Man\n\nRemoved - unconstructive; user is banned\n\n25\n\nHe5hT0T\n\nRemoved - inappropriate; user is banned\n\n26\n\nThe-Vermillion-Cross\n\nI did not die for this. You specifically mention how the story is too slow (With regards to that, I do not see as a valid point of negativity), yet know how long the game takes to complete on average. Blasphemy.\n\n27\n\nPotential_Man\n\nThis review is the exact reason why we should liberate all technologies.\n\nUmbrella Thwack or something idk\n\n28\n\nMeursault\n\nShrill cries that tore at the eardrums and mercilessly beat upon my ears.

It has been, it still is, faithful to me.\n\nWhy should I begrudge it, since during the hours, when my soul crushed the depths of my heart, it was seated there beside me?\n\nO sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, because I am certain you will never leave me. Ah, I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being.\n\nBecause I know that on the day of my final agony, you will be there, lying in my sheets, O sorrow, so that you might once again attempt to enter my heart.\n\n34\n\nJohn_subject106\n\n@OrlandoFurioso is that john ruina\n\n35\n\n_YES_\n\nGALLOP ON, ROCINANTE!!!!!!!\n\nYES!\n\n36\n\nCatherineEarnshaw\n\nI must be the reason why you have given up your smiles\n\n37\n\nXiaoLiuSection1\n\nTo me it looks like you didn't properly watch the cutscenes, read the story or play the game.

My eyes fixated on the most painful yet beautiful moments.\n\nThose moments I can only view from afar, as I can’t dare approach them.\n\nAs I cleared the filth obstructing my view, it piled up on the path to the way forward…\n\nI don’t think I can face the growing mountain in front of me squarely.\n\nIf I tried to confront it…\n\nI might be buried under mounds of resentment and suffering from others.\n\nI’m not sad about it, though. I don’t think it’s a shame that I can’t move on.\n\nTo leave you behind in the past and move forward alone would be my greatest pain.\n\nI had only one option, then. To be able to gaze at paradise forever…\n\nI should move all which blocks that sight out of the way.\n\n39\n\nImScorched\n\nI know you have lost that fight, alright?

You barely scratched the surface, and I mean barely. It’s understandable why people are upset. I know you reviewers are busy but at the very least, play the games you’re going to review. I don’t even count that as playing the game. You basically just did the tutorial.\n\n130\n\nShrenne\n\n@hellterfly Agreed!\n\nThey must at least reach Star of the City before they can properly do a review!\n\nI'm going to leave now before Alfonso finds me!\n\n131\n\nCompletesgames\n\nImagine making a review of a game that you haven't finished and called it bad because you are too lazy to progress. Blame it on the UI and things that can be fixable. But my god, this 'review' is so bad that the person who wrote this completely missed every mark.\n\nI thought the 8'o clock circus is full of clowns. I even created this stupid account on your site to make fun of this review. I swear, it is like you guys just hired some bum to play for five hours and wrote a review based of that.

I understand Project Moon games aren't that popular but underrated games often have the most unhinged fans, proven by this comment section. Although while I do find some of the comments funny, it is getting quite out of hand.\n\n134\n\nRosepanner_Rep_Niko\n\n@Shrenne @hellterfly agreed as well, Star of the City is where the game peaks after setting up the stage across the rest of the game and were a big part of the content is. You really cant say you actually played it properly and leave a review without st least getting that far, because it means you didnt get to experience the game properly and flesh out its mechanics and story.\n\n135\n\nbloodred_night\n\nThis is one of the most painful things I've read in my life, shame on you, writer.\n\n136\n\nsinner01_yisang\n\n@hellterfly Prithee fellow, worry not for our extravagant actions, whilst out of the ordinary, are made not out of angst but rather of ennui.\n\nIn less locatious words, we're simply having a field day in a review that is more of a joke than anything and thus is taken accordingly.\n\nIn a way, it is akin to a bait I and my fellows will gladly take, but rest assured we mean no disrespect nor harm, and are merely jesting.\n\nSuch is all I have to say.\n\n137\n\nAllocGazeOffice\n\nI'd like to go back to being a book in the Pale Library, thanks.\n\n138\n\nsinner01_yisang\n\nThe Ideal is real.\n\n139\n\nM4Sherman\n\n@HeeHoo I suppose the reviewer deserving this kind of trolling doesn't actually justify what is technically spam; you do have a point\n\n140\n\nChiefButlerRyoshu\n\nThis review is such a disgrace to the point where i feel the need to make another review.\n\nI will find the author and B.A.R.F. on their hands.\n\n141\n\nENTERTHENAME\n\nWhether or not the Review is updated I Hope the reviewer goes back and plays through the game on their own time It's rather sad that they end up missing out on it because their job is to quickly write up slop for game journo sites.\n\n142\n\nNutzach\n\n@hellterfly As someone who has played a bit of the switch port and the PC version to completion, honestly the complaints about UI in the port specifically are valid in handheld mode, since a lot of text is rather small, but that's about it. The rest of the complaints seem to be coming from a place of ignorance since the reviewer seemed to barely even get into Urban Plague, before the game even sets up most of it's reoccurring characters. Hell, the only Sephirah they've met so far are likely Malkuth and Yesod.\n\nThat being said, with how poorly the game was advertised, I think reviews like this spreading what are tantamount to lies about the game are that much more egregious since word of mouth is that much more important. It's a shame, as someone who loves Project Moon and the universe they've created, to see what is IMO their best game get slandered like this.\n\nAs long as people don't go and actually harass the person behind the review, since that'd be messed up no matter how egregious this piece of \"critical writing\" is, then I don't think it's too bad. Poor site mods though, they don't deserve to bare the brunt of one bad review's comment section.\n\n143\n\nBugGuy\n\nJudging by the review somebody didn’t read.\n\nManager, this one’s a lost cause. Let’s feed em’ to Mephi.\n\n144\n\ncL0k3\n\nI don't understand how a games reviewer could find interest in the setting yet totally misrepresent it (by not acknowledging the existence of the Wings as a concept).\n\nHearing an outsider take is always vital, and I agree that Project Moon's UI creation isn't always the best, but it is worth considering that the game is made by an indie team of 30 total people, and that the game is a port. And the obvious ignorance of the voice acting and music saddens me (as I'd like to hear takes ideally comparing the Korean and Japanese Dubbing, and commentary on the music, especially on motif usage)\n\n145\n\nCaptainofthePequod\n\nThis must be the Review from which all hatred, all evils of the world spout!\n\nAll of your struggles, all of your injustices, all of your pains and losses... that very evil sprang forth from that very Review...\n\nThe fault for this must lie with Ishmael!!!\n\n146\n\nbloodred_night\n\nThe old hag is here, Ahab hit me up babe\n\n147\n\nCAPTAIN_AHAB\n\nI am the only one who matters.

It is only natural for one to fear being naked in the face of the world. At least you and I know one thing. Project Moon shall be our forbidden fruit for the new humanity. Now, speak my name.\n\n159\n\nBig_bird\n\nNah bro, I can see many things but couldnt notice this piece of filth, get it of my eyes\n\n160\n\nxxor\n\n@hellterfly\n\nI fully agree. While the review is bad, and the sh**posts are somewhat funny, we are getting nothing across other than looking unhinged. But other than telling people to please not spam sh**posts there is nothing much we can do other than adding actual criticism and hoping the sh**posts dry out soon.\n\nLet's hope no idiot takes this further than ***** posting a bit here, a bad review doesn't excuse a person being harassed or worse. I know people are upset, but please only criticize the review, and not ruin the life of the reviewer.\n\nThat being said. This review is genuinely bad. I know that reviewers do not have the time to fully experience a 200h game and acknowledge that is a good start, but that makes it even more insulting that knowing that this review treats those few hours like it is all the game has to offer. Naturally there are valid pieces of criticism here such as the small texts and menus, but the rest of the critique fails to actually examine any aspect of the game.\n\nThere are plenty of constructive comments on the positive aspects of the game that were misrepresented or missed by the review so I won't restate all that.\n\nThe worst aspect of this is that this review is one of the first things to come up when you search for the game. And for an indie game, the few reviews it gets from bigger sources are very important.\n\nFor the reviewer to acknowledge that they have not experienced the full game and yet to still go on to go against the popular sentiment shown on this site and steam by user reviews is inexcusable. It makes the entire review seem inauthentic. Only adding the bit about not having fully experienced the game not because that factor was actually considered, but because you had it on a list of things to say somewhere. If you didn't care about the game state that clearly and maybe rethink if you should be reviewing the game.\n\nIf you're able to acknowledge that you haven't really experienced the game then maybe do not assume that the game has nothing else to present to you, and instead look at what other people had to say about the game who actually experienced it all. By not even considering that, the reviewer has very much brought this situation onto themselves. (Like seriously, what did you think was gonna happen when you saw a 9/10 game on steam; a 9.6/10 game on this site at the time of writing; a game with a big fanbase; and gave it a 4/10... Did you not even once look at the user reviews of the game you were reviewing, especially knowing you didn't play all of it?)\n\nI understand that the game may have not been to the reviewers taste, it may not be a game for everyone and that they maybe just got paid to play the game for X hours and then to write a review. But no review would have been better than a review this misleading on an indie game where the review will have an impact.\n\ntldr: The review is horrible. But please do not be a complete idiot and harass the reviewer over it.\n\n161\n\nblindmew\n\nCharlie, at least TRY to give the game a fair chance before dismissing it on a public platform.\n\nYou claim that the game was too long for you to get through, while also wanting to spend more time on certain characters? Those complaints don't match up at all. Simple nitpicking at best.\n\nIf want to explore the game's potential like you said, then please actually play the game beyond the first few hours. You're supposed to be a reviewer, not some sort of free-sample taster.\n\n162\n\nMutilate\n\nBase Power 5\n\nCoins 1\n\nCoin Power +25\n\nOffense level + 3\n\nAtk Weight ⯀\n\n[On Kill] Use this skill 1 more time\n\n(II) [Heads Hit] Damage +7\n\n[Reuse - Heads Hit] +100% Damage for this coin\n\n[Reuse - Heads Hit] If target has 10+ Bleed, deal +50% damage\n\n163\n\nReaderSquid\n\nI'm sorry to say and I most likely bias but this review is really unfair, you review it when you are still pretty much in te beginning. This review is like as if you ate the appetizer and then rate the rest of the meal.\n\nIt really says a lot when you do this, losing credibility since I now know you most likely won't be putting in the hours to reach far in a game. I'm quite disappointed given how much this game does have to give, the mechanics are pretty wonky but given this was on the pc before, I say they did what they could.\n\nPlease next time, review the game after reaching much further into the game. I promise you, it would be great.\n\nThis also reminds me of someone who review cup head for some reason- because they couldn't pass the tutorial.\n\n164\n\nHook-Office-Remnant\n\nBy the wings who let Mayo review another game ?\n\nSomeone please lock this guy in a warp train.\n\n165\n\nToMerry\n\nMommy, should we make the reviewer triangle-shaped or square-shaped?\n\n(Don’t worry, it’s a joke.

Sanity can be seen at the very bottom of the combat bar as the blue or red number right besides a units health, the number itself ranges between -45 to 45. Sanity directly affects the chance of a unit rolling heads; each unit of sanity corresponds to a change of 1% heads rate. In a normal combat encounter outside of dungeons and the Railway, all sinners and enemies usually start at 0 sanity. The main way to gain sanity is after winning clashes or defeating enemies. Sanity is usually lost by using EGO, losing allies, the Sinking status effect or other effects.\n\nReaching -30 or below sanity may cause \"Low Morale\" on any enemy with SP, reducing their skill effectiveness against clashes and one sided attacks. Furthermore, hitting -45 will immediately cause \"Panic\", which is akin to that of Staggered, preventing any action until the next turn (which reset to 0 SP). If Sinner reaches -45 and has E.G.O other than their unique ones, they are susceptible to E.G.O Corrosion, in which they are forced to use only corrosion skill against the manager's decision. Abnormalities and hostiles without any sanity cannot gain the advantages and disadvantages of sanity and take direct gloom damage through Sinking.\n\n185\n\nAlice_Liddell\n\nRemoved - inappropriate formatting\n\n186\n\niloveteasomuch\n\nRemoved - inappropriate\n\n187\n\nExcruciating-study\n\nYou want to write review?

Exposure for a long time can cause individuals to begin to experience the phenomenon of Distortion, similar to our encounter with the artifact called Black Monolith. However, Faust says that this is a different case, which we should proceed with greater caution.\n\nThe white damage caused by the entity is due to its previous exposure to an entertainment source that was erroneously described causing its opinion in specific individuals to reach the repercussions currently seen.\n\nFaust knows that a time span of 5 hours is not enough to determine what an audiovisual entertainment format based on input and reasoning of the person whose duration is around 100 hours can offer.\n\nIt seems to indicate a negligence in the content investigation method on the part of the entity itself.\n\n197\n\nTheBlueReverberation\n\nThis review is utterly shameful, Angelica did not perish for this.\n\nMaybe the path of being a \"journalist\" is not for you, friend.\n\n198\n\nMartinaCaneOffice\n\n…Prez will get all miffed when he will read this…\n\n199\n\nYourSaviorWhiteNight\n\nAdding to my previous statement, I find this review irritating to say the least.\n\nThou hast clearly stated in thy review that \"based on our research, this game takes anywhere from 120 to 250 hours to beat depending on how you play your cards.\" yet thou judge the game based on the little hours thou hast put into the game, saying stuff like the lack of commitment to the characters and story related stuff, while I agree about the UI problem thou hast put a lot of bad word despite the little time thou hast spent on the game which may have ward off many and new vict- players that might be interested in the game.\n\nAside from all this, you all can calm down w the shpost, some comment are kinda crossing the line a bit, if you want to meme atleast meme respectfully. heart heart heart star star kissy face emoji\n\nALSO, Hello PMCH and the great LCB eng dub server, I am in thy wall.\n\n(Impressive voice acting Adhit, thy voice shall guide thee to greatness that await thee, I am sure.)\n\n200\n\nyesodgaming\n\nDING DING DING DING DING DING\n\nBook of Journalist Obtained\n\n201\n\nLCB-Ishmael\n\nHa...

I believe this article may have driven off potential new fans of Project Moon games which is a shame, and a good example as to why you should not judge a game purely based off of 5ish hours of gameplay.

I am surely not showing this to not a single one of the brave Yurodivy patriots on this site, not even Rodya. Remember Yurodivy patriots, never trust a game reviewer on the Internet.
