Gaming site IGN has recently compiled a list together of the Wii’s 25 greatest games of all time and has included both Zelda Wii games in its list. But where do both games place in the list?\n\nClick on the jump and find out!\n\nIGN had an abundance of amazing games for the top 25 list including Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros Brawl, New Super Mario Bros Wii, and Donkey Country Returns. Yet out of these great games Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword both managed to squeeze inside the top ten which is a great achievement! To be precise, IGN ranked Twilight Princess as the seventh greatest Wii game and Skyward Sword eclipsed the other 24 by claiming the number one spot!\n\nIGN’s reason for Skyward Sword to be considered the best was because of its amazing dungeon design, innovative motion controls, and superb narrative. They said the title took risks that helped it to create such well structured gameplay. IGN stated that Twilight Princess was a brilliant game because of its dark atmosphere that had never before plagued a Zelda title and its boss fights and weaponry plan to become “benchmarks” toward the future of the series.\n\nDo you agree with the placements of Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword in IGN’s top 25 Wii games list? Does Skyward Sword deserve to be the number one Wii game? Do you agree with IGN’s praise toward both Zelda titles? Write your thoughts for us in the comments below!"
