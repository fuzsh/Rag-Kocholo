        "text": "This week's release of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies marks the end of a long journey through Middle-earth for director Peter Jackson. The Oscar-winning filmmaker's pair of trilogy adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit have earned multiple awards, billions of dollars at the box office, and critical reaction ranging from zealous acclaim to utter derision.\n\nWith the saga of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins now over, we take a look back at Jackson's cinematic journey through Middle-earth and rank those six theatrical releases in order from bottom to top.\n\nIt's a minor miracle The Hobbit even exists after such a storied and arduous journey to the big screen. While The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has many moments of epic fun, it never recaptures the wonder or mystique of the LOTR trilogy. Jackson pads out this first installment of his trilogy-long adaptation of a slender kid's book with supplemental material from Tolkien's other works, additions meant to not just draw out the story into multiple films but to also further explain some characters' motivations and whereabouts, as well as to establish more connective tissue to the LOTR films. Unfortunately, it takes a full hour for anything to really happen here.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nMuch of the movie's fun and humor derives from the dwarves' interaction with one another and their growing fondness for Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, whose performance anchors the entire trilogy). Jackson makes the dwarves' mission part of a more epic diaspora, a decision that elevates their quest above being a mere treasure hunt like it was in the original story, but the stakes of The Hobbit just don't have the gravity or impact of those in LOTR. By the end of Unexpected Journey, you don't care as much about its characters as you did about the Fellowship at the end of the first LOTR.\n\nThis final film may be Jackson's biggest challenge yet as it has to succeed on three distinct fronts – as the finale to one trilogy, as the connective tissue to another, and as an entertaining effort in its own right. Ambitious doesn’t begin to cover it. The titular battle features the kind of large-scale conflict that Jackson is so good at staging. He carefully sets out the geography of the battleground then guides you through it, as man, dwarf and elf confront hordes of Orcs, who in turn are aided and abetted by several beasts of war, including giant bats and gargantuan worms. Trouble is, it all gets CGI-heavy, with the film at times looking less like live-action and more like animation.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nPredictably the film also segues into multiple endings, but mercifully not as many as the finale of The Return of the King. There’s a slightly jarring tonal shift, and some somewhat clumsy forewarnings of the darkness to come. As a standalone feature Battle of the Five Armies has its fair share of shortcomings however, most conspicuously the fact that the film’s most impressive sequence is its opening salvo, with Smaug casting his sizable shadow over the rest of proceedings. There’s also a little too much filler that seems designed to pad things out, so much so that at times it feels like characters are being reintroduced simply so they can then be bid farewell. But overall it’s a satisfying and ultimately moving ending to this trilogy.\n\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a rollicking piece of epic entertainment, superior to its predecessor An Unexpected Journey technically and dramatically. It clips along at a fast rate, upping the action and the suspense in a way the walking-and-talking first film often failed to. Everything just works better this time out: the battles, the character interplay, the visual effects, the tone, and the energy.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Desolation of Smaug features a lot of material either invented by the screenwriters or culled from Tolkien's supplemental materials and notes. Perhaps its precisely because this film is liberated from simply reenacting the familiar beats from the classic novel and embraces creative license to invent, expand, and explore that it feels more energetic and alive than the first Hobbit. It's as if Peter Jackson simply wanted to make a fun movie here rather than a painstaking recreation of the source material.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has the misfortune of being the middle act of the first trilogy, so it doesn't quite rise to the heights of its companions. It also made a few questionable changes to the source material. But this fantasy epic still has plenty to offer fans of Tolkien's saga. The climactic Battle of Helm's Deep and the Last March of the Ents are two of the greatest moments in fantasy cinema.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhere Fellowship of the Ring shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth, such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur. Those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find The Two Towers much more tightly focused and hard-driving. Those who felt Fellowship's greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find Two Towers a bit remote – more distancing, and not as involving. But such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of its spectacle.\n\nThe battle for Middle-earth came to an end in the the third part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Fans couldn't have asked for a bigger and more emotional conclusion. The ferocious battle between men and orcs at Minas Tirith was offset by the more intimate struggle of Sam and Frodo to cross those final, terrible miles to Mount Doom. If the hero must suffer in his journey, the members of the Fellowship more than paid their dues in this film.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is nothing short of a crowning achievement in not just fantasy cinema, but cinema storytelling in general. The way that it brought so many puzzle pieces, journeys and characters together in such a satisfactory manner was remarkable. Yes, a lot of people like to joke about how many \"endings\" there were to the film, and the fact that it dragged out what should have been a more succinct wrap-up. Regardless, there was nary a dry eye in the theater when this film wrapped up.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is the solid and heart-warming introduction to the trilogy which manages to overcome all the typical obstacles that an expository chapter might face. It's also the film that starts out in The Shire before the characters are beset by madness and monsters, so it's a film that people love to revisit because they can experience Middle-earth before the second siege of the sinister Dark Lord Sauron. If this film had failed to draw us in and show us how wonderfully daft and delightfully serene The Shire was, then we would have lost our \"in.\"\n\nUnlike the fantasy films that have come before it, The Fellowship of the Ring manages to transport the viewer to a different realm with no connection to the \"real\" world. Every Hobbit, Elf and Orc look believable, further transporting the audience into Middle-earth. From the moment Gandalf the Grey enters the Shire at the beginning of the film, the outside world ceases to exist.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThere's a certain majesty to Fellowship, but it's not the majesty of stylish photography or elegant production design. It's a majesty that can only be put on-screen by filmmakers who truly feel the material with which they are working...who truly believe in the task at hand...who have a steady vision to fuel their endeavor. All of the poetic writing and slick post-production in the universe could not make up for the such genuine qualities. Qualities which are fleeting to the point of extinction in most large-scale productions these days. Qualities which are evident here, in welcomed abundance.\n\nMore From Middle-earth"
