        "text": "\"That still only counts as one!\" - grumpy dwarf Gimli.\n\nLooking back at the last five years, I see The Lord of the Rings everywhere. Sure, the movies only came out in the last three years, but for fans of the trilogy the anticipation extended well past that. I can remember following the announcements in 1998 and 1999 until that first little tease of finished footage hit the 'Net in 2000. Then the ultimate torture arrived in the form of twenty minutes of footage from Cannes a few short months before the release of The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nWe had a new Lord of the Rings movie each December. It was something to look forward to. But now it's all over. Sure, there's the Extended Edition of the final film coming out in November, but The Return of the King is the end of the story. We don't have another LOTR movie this year, and it could be a long time before we get The Hobbit.\n\nThe Return of the King is the culmination of everything that started back with The Fellowship of the Ring. It wraps up the story, but it also ends the five-plus year LOTR odyssey. The movie mopped up in awards season, ending with the ultimate head-exploding fanboy moment when Steven Spielberg handed Peter Jackson the Best Picture Academy Award last February.\n\nWe get ROTK on DVD a few months earlier this year. As a result, the extras are lacking one featurette, but what's really important is the movie that's included on disc one.\n\nThe Movie\n\n\" Farewell. At the edge of these shores, our fellowship comes to an end. My work is ended. I will not say \"do not weep,\" for not all tears are evil,\" - Gandalf.\n\nThe Return of the King brings everything from the first two parts of the story together in one epic conclusion. The characters that were separated in The Two Towers are reunited, huge battles are fought, people die, two little Hobbits complete their task, and the story comes to a perfectly satisfying conclusion.\n\nIt picks up right where Two Towers left off. Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are reunited with Merry and Pippin at the ruins of Isengard after the Ents had their fun. Back in Mordor, Frodo and Sam continue their trek to the heard of the black land while Gollum schemes to turn Sam against Frodo so he can finally take back the precious as his own.\n\nGandalf and crew return to Edoras where they learn that Sauron plans to strike Minas Tirith, the main human stronghold. If Minas Tirith were to fall, Sauron wins. When Pippin does something that makes the dark lord think he has the Ring, he is put into moral danger and Gandalf takes him to Minas Tirith where he may be safe, while at the same time the wizard tries to convince Denethor (the father of Boromir and Faramir as seen in the Towers EE) of the certain doom that is at his doorstep.\n\nAragorn, Gimli, and Legolas travel with the Rohirrim as they gather armies for the coming war. While at camp, Elrond brings Aragorn the re-forged Narsil. They slipped in a little thing about Arwen's health being connected to the growth of Sauron's power and that she'd die if he wasn't defeated. Confusing and inflammatory to purists, this story element coincides with Elrond convincing Aragorn that he must accept his destiny. If they want any hope of victory at Minas Tirith, they would need the help of the dead.\n\nSo, the Three Hunters once again go hunting. This time they venture deep into the mountain and take the Paths of the Dead. Inside, Aragorn shows that he is the true heir to the throne of Gondor and recruits the help of the cursed dead to aid them in the coming battle.\n\nMeanwhile, the two Hobbits continue their path to the mountain of fire. There's been a lot of deserved praise for how incredibly Gandalf was captured in the films, but in this third movie the real star is Samwise Gamgee. Sean Astin perfectly captured the soul of Sam in this conclusion to the story making Samwise the most fully realized character from the books that appeared in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Gandalf is still perfect, but Sam comes to life right from the pages of the book in this movie.\n\nYou may have heard Philippa Boyens quote Tolkien when describing Sam in ROTK that \"His will was set, and only death would break it,\" and that is how Samwise is in this third installment. From Shelob's Lair where Sam comes to Frodo's rescue to Mt. Doom where he carries Frodo the rest of the way, Sean Astin is the man here, and his castmates knew it. In interviews, the cast had said they felt Astin was their best chance for an acting Oscar for RotK.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings was always said to be \"unfilmable,\" and I think the Battle of Pelennor fields is a big reason why. I never thought I'd live to see that portion of the book pulled off as convincingly as WETA did in ROTK. You have hundreds of thousands of orcs using siege warfare against a city built into the side of a mountain and thousands of horses facing off against another army of Oliphaunts. That doesn't even bring the Nazgul on their felbeasts into consideration.\n\nSpeaking of the Nazgul, one of the most memorable and iconic images from The Return of the King book was brought to life in the ultimate crowd-pleasing moment when Eowyn stands toe-to-toe with the Witch King, whom no man can kill. Since Eowyn definitely isn't a man she's able to beat him down and the crowd goes wild.\n\nIf Pelennor Fields isn't impressive enough for you, there's still the showdown at the Black Gate where the remainder of the human forces (Rohan and Gondor combined) go to buy Frodo a chance. You have a small group of soldiers surrounded by all of Mordor with the winged Nazgul bearing down on them. Cue jaw drops when the Eagles show up.\n\nBarring a couple omissions from the book, which will be in the Extended Edition for you purists, this part of the trilogy is probably one of the closest in terms of preserving Tolkien's text. In fact, parts of the ending such as the Grey Havens are almost word-for-word from the book. The movie lacks the Voice of Saruman, the Houses of Healing, the Mouth of Sauron, and a couple of other small story elements, but even without those I feel it flows just as well if not better than the theatrical cut of Fellowship.\n\nOne of the big things in this third part of the story that Jackson and crew really focused on and nailed are the relationships between the various characters. We've had about six hours of film to get to know these characters, and compared to other movies that's an entire trilogy. With all of that time, you really get to know and care about these characters so the emotional impact of this finale is greater.\n\nYou may have your issues with the absence of The Voice of Saruman, The Houses of Healing, or The Mouth of Sauron, but Jackson and crew nailed the conclusion to the story so perfectly the tears begin at the Black Gate, especially for those who love the books. If you've read LOTR over the years, you're going to need a box of tissues starting when Aragorn and crew go to the Black Gate to buy Frodo the time to finish his task.\n\nFans will probably start sniffling when Gimli is standing next to Legolas and says \"I never thought I'd die standing side-by-side with an Elf.\" Legolas's \"How about side-by-side with a friend?\" shows that Jackson and pals knew how to affect book readers at the start of the finale. Sam's \"I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\" completes the one-two punch of trying to make fans cry long before the Grey Havens.\n\nA lot of people complained about the \"multiple endings\" to the movie, but the story doesn't end after the Ring is destroyed. There's a lot more to wrap up, and Jackson takes his time to do so including everything people demand to see at the end of Return of the King (and putting the Scouring of the Shire in there would have completely destroyed the emotional rhythm the film hits at the end). And for fans, the torrent of tears just gets stronger and stronger as the ending plays out.\n\nThe Fellowship is reunited in Minas Tirith, Aragorn is crowned king, and all of Gondor bows before four small Hobbits. At the coronation, they slipped in some little winks to people who read the book such as Eomer wearing the tunic that signifies him as King of Rohan, and Faramir and Eowyn are standing side by side looking very happy (which will be expanded upon when Houses of Healing is put into the Extended Edition).\n\nThe story even looks four years into the future and we get to see Sam getting married to Rosie Cotton. Before the Grey Havens when Frodo is putting the finishing touches on the Red Book, Sam walks in. Fans will notice he cuffs his hands on his coat in a very \"mayoral\" way, as those who read the books would know that Samwise is Mayor of Hobbiton.\n\nBut, just as in the book, everything comes down to the Grey Havens.\n\nIt has always been my favorite chapter, and there aren't many fans that can read LOTR and not get misty-eyed at the ending. Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh so perfectly captured not only the text of the ending of The Lord of the Rings, but also the emotion of that final chapter. Gandalf's line \"Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Midde-earth. Go in peace! I will not say; do not weap; for not all tears are an evil\" has always been one of my favorite passages from the book, and aside from a couple words it is exactly what he says to the Hobbits in the movie. It's both fitting and needed at this point in the film.\n\nIn my review of Fellowship, I made the point of illustrating the effect that the Ring had on Frodo in just that first part. In the beginning he was bright-eyed and innocent, and at the end he was tormented by the burden of the Ring. That tormented and dark Frodo is all we saw for the rest of the story, until the Grey Havens. When he steps on the ship and turns back to the camera, we see the happy and innocent Frodo for the first time since Hobbiton at the beginning of Fellowship.\n\nYou know, the Extended Edition can add in the fate of Saruman, Houses of Healing, and the confrontation with the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gate, but I truly hope they don't touch the Grey Havens. I know there are people out there who want to see things from the Appendix ending such as Gimli and Legolas building their little boat and sailing off into the west together, but the emotional tone and flow of the ending is so perfect I'm not sure I want to see it touched to risk messing up what is there. It's perfect as it is. Sam returning home to Rosie and saying \"Well…I'm back\" is how the movie should always end.\n\nIt's still hard to believe it's over. We'll be extremely lucky to get another trilogy as amazing as The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson and crew did the impossible. They brought Tolkien's epic to the screen with a caring hand that resulted in one of the greatest achievements in film history.\n\nThe Return of the King is the perfect ending to that story.\n\nScore: 10 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\n\"Fat hobbit is always so polite.\" - Gollum\n\nI have to admit being really worried about this. You're talking about a 201 minute movie squeezed onto a single disc, with tons of action on screen. That could be a recipe for disaster. Instead, it's succeeds better than movies half its length.\n\nPresented in 2.35:1, Return of the King offers a beautiful, flawless print, with only one real, expected flaw: strobing. Things blur during action sequences a lot. It made getting some good screen shots a real bear at times because there was so much blurring. But you are watching it in real time, not taking screen shots.\n\nIn action, the print is darn near perfect, with near-Superbit performance around 8.5 mbits/sec. Colors are bright and rich. You can really see it in the lava of Mount Doom and the colorful clothing at the ending. Armor shines, blood is too real and the grass and leaves are a vibrant dark green. Black levels are perfect while whites are free of noise.\n\nFine detail is a tad lacking here and there, but what do you expect? Still, in places like the pitted walls of Minas Tirith or the armor worn by both sides, there's plenty of detail to keep anyone who can't wait for the EE in November very happy.\n\nA word of note: RotK was checked out on a JVC XL-44S and Denon DVD-2200 deck. The JVC picture was slightly brighter, particularly faces. Everyone looked pale and overlit. The Denon picture was overall darker and more accurate.\n\nScore: 10 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\n\"Well this is unheard of. An elf will go underground and a dwarf won't? Oh, I'll never hear the end of it.\" - Grum, er, Gimli.\n\nReturn of the King offers a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix or a 2.0 mix, with subtitles in English, French and Spanish.\n\nNow here the disc really shines. The audio mix is a fully immersive experience, surrounding and enveloping you through all of the mayhem and chilling in its silence when need be. The first really powerful experience is early on, when Faramir retreats from Osgillath and the Fell Beasts attack. That will have you ducking in your chair.\n\nSo will the assault on Minas Tirith. The Rohan army charge is downright scary, and you won't forget when the oliphaunts first appear. The mix covers the full dynamic spectrum, with some earth-shaking LFE action all the way up to the high end. The only complaint I have is the musical score, while beautiful, can be overbearing at times. It's not as bad as, say, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but it is a bit too loud in places.\n\nStill, overall, definitely one of the best Dolby Digital demonstrations I've heard in ages. This gives Master & Commander a run for its money.\n\nScore: 10 out of 10\n\nPackaging and Extras\n\n\"Put aside the Ranger, become who you were born to be.\" - Elrond.\n\nAs with the previous two-disc sets, this is really an archive of the Theatrical release. If you want the real meat of the special features (commentary, documentaries, etc.) you'll need to wait until the Extended Edition is released in November. Also like the previous releases, the extras are structured identically.\n\nYou get three promotional specials titled The Quest Fulfilled: A Director's Vision, A Filmmaker's Journey: Making \"The Return of the King\", and the National Geographic Special The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. All three of these have been seen before and are pretty promotional in nature. Don't go in expecting anything close to what you'll get with the EE. Again, this is an archive of the Theatrical release.\n\nContinuing that archival mentality, the disc includes the six short featurettes from thelordoftherings.net. Aragorn's Destiny, Minas Tirith: Capital of Gondor, The Battle of Pelennor Fields, Samwise the Brave, Eowyn: White Lady of Rohan, and Digital Horse Doubles are all available on the website, so if you want to check them out before you pick up the DVD you can go there and watch the Quicktime footage. Since they are Web featurettes, each one is pretty short.\n\nFollowing those featurettes is a collection of the theatrical trailers and TV spots including the cool LOTR super trailer that basically combines the trailers for all three movies into one five-minute trailer that tells the entire story of the trilogy. This was originally included with the Limited Edition version of the ROTK soundtrack before being posted online at Oscar time.\n\nFinally the disc includes a preview of the upcoming EA LOTR games, and DVD ROM links to the official site.\n\nNotice something missing? Since we get the disc two months early this year we don't get a preview of the Extended Edition. I guess that's the price we pay for having The Return of the King on DVD so soon. I'm willing to give that up to have this movie on DVD.\n\n7 out of 10\n\nClick the Media Pages link below for many more nifty, high resolution screen shots."
