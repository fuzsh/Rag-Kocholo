        "text": "The return of ‘The Rings of Power’ is imminent... you can feel it in the water, you can feel it on the ground, you can smell it in the air... Little by little, we’re getting closer to having more details about what Season 2 of the series will be like, and now, thanks to new images that have been released these days, we have a glimpse of what’s coming next in this Prime Video series.\n\nNew ‘The Rings of Power’ images show us new and familiar faces for Season 2\n\nWe already had the image of Tom Bombadil and even a troll inspired by a Breaking Bad character, and now Prime Video has released a great set of images that take us to meet new faces, reunite with heroes and villains, and visit new places we have not seen before in Middle-earth and Númenor. All this thanks to a recent set visit Prime Video conducted with media outlets including IGN, Nerdist, Collider and TV Insider. You can check them out below:\n\nRings of Power: Season 2 new images\n\n1 / 5\n\nA future full of Lord of the Rings movies\n\nFans of the world created by Professor Tolkien couldn’t be happier, as new productions have been announced to take us back to those worlds. In addition to The Rings of Power Season 2, which will be available on Prime Video on August 29th, there are more projects on the way. Later this year, we will also have ‘The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim’, an anime directed by Kenji Kamiyama, director of ‘Ghost in the Shell’, arriving on December 13th. Other projects coming later are ‘The Hunt for Gollum’, a production directed by and starring Andy Serkis, who will return to the role of Smeagol; absolutely nothing is known about the second, other than that Jackson’s team will be involved."
