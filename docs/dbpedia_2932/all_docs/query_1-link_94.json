        "text": "2007 has been a sterling year for gamers. With three new platforms all hitting their stride, we've been absolutely spoilt for choice. Regardless of how you like to get your game on, we've seen some of the finest examples for every genre, from Super Mario Galaxy to Mass Effect to Call of Duty 4. In fact, there have been so many quality titles that it's been next to impossible to make time for them all. Luckily for you that's what we're here for - the following is a look at the best of 2007 from an Aussie perspective, as well as a sneak peak into what 2008 holds for us all.\n\nBennett Ring\n\nAU Editor-in-Chief\n\nJoined IGN: Oct 06\n\n07 Highlight: Realising you need to kill the Big Daddies to save the Little Sisters. Six hours in.\n\nCam Shea| Blog\n\nAU Games Editor\n\nJoined IGN: Jan 07\n\n07 Highlight: Buying a house thanks to videogames.\n\nPatch Kolan| Blog\n\nAU Associate Editor\n\nJoined IGN: Oct 06\n\n07 Highlight: Shooting the breeze with Tim Schafer.\n\n2007: The Year That Was In Australia\n\nMore and more people are playing games, there's no doubt about it. With every year that passes, the balance between guys and girls gets a little more even, and the age range expands even more. Hell, now – alongside 'hardcore' players and 'mainstream/casual' players – you've got this new 'grey gamer' phenomenon. Are old people really playing games? I really hope not but there's no doubt that the industry in Oz keeps getting bigger.\n\nLet's rock you with some hardcore stats, cos that's how we roll yo. Interactive Entertainment in Australia (defined as console games, consoles, edutainment, gaming peripherals and PC Games) for the year to date (January to November) grew in units by 23.2% and in value by 42.5%. Or, less abstractly, console game sales have grown in value by 28%, while console sales have grown by 91%. That's significant growth, fuelled largely by the introduction of the three new machines over the last 21 months, the continuing success of the DS, and one of the strongest Christmas games line-ups ever.\n\nThat growth is set to continue too – Christmas sales are ramping up and both Microsoft and Sony have introduced new, lower-priced models, in the form of the Xbox 360 Arcade and the 40GB PlayStation 3, hoping to extend their reach. Nintendo's Wii meanwhile, keeps notching up sales at a frantic rate.\n\nWhile it will be interesting to see the figures once the dust from Christmas has settled – particularly since both the Wii and Xbox 360 have already had one Christmas on the market, we can give you a snapshot of how each console has performed to date within Australia. As of December 9, the Wii had passed 250,000 units, the PS3 had passed 100,000 units sold, and the Xbox 360 was sitting around the 270,000 figure. Sadly, we can't give you exact figures, but these should give you a good idea. Breaking it down a little further, that's 250,000 units in 12 months for the Wii, 100,000 units for the PS3 in a little over 9 months and 270,000 units in 20 months for the Xbox 360. It's not hard to see that the Wii has kicked serious butt in this market, just as it has in others, but both other consoles have performed well, and as already mentioned, the PS3 is one Christmas down, so it will be interesting to see how it does with a lower price point option.\n\nThe Wii wasn't the only success story for Nintendo this year, with the Nintendo DS also selling exceptionally strongly. In fact, Nintendo told us only a few days ago that – as of December 9 – Australian sales have surpassed 900,000 units. That's 900,000 in 34 months, but most tellingly of all, a full 400,000 of those sales have been in the last 8 months. Aussie gamers went nuts for DS in 2007 in other words.\n\nThe PSP meanwhile, has performed steadily, and while we don't have the latest figures for the system, we expect that it's probably up around 350,000 now, which is nothing to sniff at, but it just hasn't seen the explosive growth that Nintendo's DS has.\n\nWe should also mention that while it's easy enough to focus on the new consoles, in terms of game sales install base is king. A glance at the All Formats charts for the last couple of months shows that the PS2 (with well over two million units sold Down Under) occupies – on average – over four of the top ten slots.\n\nWhat else has been going on locally? Let's take a look at the Aussie development scene. It's been a bit of a mixed bag really. Let's do the good stuff first shall we? The highest profile title of the year from an Australian perspective was undoubtedly BioShock – a critical darling and huge commercial success which was developed in collaboration between Irrational's Australian and Boston studios (now renamed 2K Australia and 2K Boston respectively). Yaay team.\n\nThe good...\n\nAnother huge title for an Aussie developer was Infinite Interactive's Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, which began life as a cult hit on DS and PSP, but by the end of the year had moved across to XBLA, PC, Wii and PS2. A just reception for a great game.\n\nThe Creative Assembly (which has a studio in Brisbane and one in the UK) also continues to turn out top notch titles, with the release of Medieval II Total War: Kingdoms in September.\n\nLet's see… what else was there? Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. IR Gurus' Heatseeker, which was shaping up to be a pretty reasonable arcade combat game, was received very poorly, while Auran's Fury was a critical and commercial failure, ultimately leading to the company filing for bankruptcy.\n\nKrome had a particularly challenging year in terms of critical success, with both Viva Piñata: Party Animals and The Legend of Spyro: Eternal Night reviewing very badly. No sir, we didn't like them at all.\n\n...and the not so good.\n\nStill, we do have one of the coolest development team names anywhere in the world, and that's got to count for something, right? I'm referring, of course, to 'Champagne for the Ladies.' Boo-ya! Plus, there are plenty of high profile projects that Australian teams are working on. Krome is still beavering away on Hellboy: The Science of Evil, as well as the PS2 version of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. IR Gurus is working on Sin City: The Game, and Pandemic Studios (which also has a Brisbane studio as well as one based in the US) is a long way along on Mercenaries 2, among other titles.\n\nOh, and because we're Australian we're also free to claim any New Zealand talent as our own (although we're happy to give Russell Crowe back now – can we have Peter Jackson?), so we should mention that Sidhe Interactive, the guys behind GripShift, are now working on Speed Racer for PS2 and Wii. (The less said about that whole Jackass: The Game debacle, however, the better).\n\nGames of 2007\n\nWe say it every year, but it's true - this year has seen the strongest lineup of quality games that we can remember. The 360 cemented it's position as having the widest range of quality titles, while the PS3 finally came of age towards the end of the year. While the Wii's lineup wasn't exactly immense, there were a couple of jewels in its crown that made it easy to forgive the lack of breadth. The following are the top ten games that IGN Australia reviewed over 2007, based on the review score we gave each.\n\nUnreal Tournament III - PC\n\nEpic\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.2\n\nThe UT series is back in full force. Players who long for competitive twitch shooting have had their prayers answered in a game that steers about as far away from the Halos and Call of Duties as it can. It's also incredibly gorgeous and remains a regular time-eater at IGN AU. We think, in fact, it surpasses Quake III Arena in the pure competitive shooting stakes, separating the men from the boys online while remaining compelling and balanced for all players.\n\nForza MotorSport 2\n\nMicrosoft\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.2\n\nIf it's pure automotive simulation you're after, Forza has you covered. It is stupidly deep at times – to the point of being almost anally accurate, but for racing game lovers, Forza 2 is the best in the genre right now. Perhaps it undeservingly flew under the radar while higher profile games took the spotlight, but we haven't forgotten. As Bennett put it just today, 'Goddamn, I need to get back into that game, actually.\" The fire still burns.\n\nMetroid Prime 3: Corruption\n\nNintendo\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.2\n\nIt's been a great year coming to a close for the Wii. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption takes gameplay traits established in the first two Gamecube titles and ties it to intuitive Wii remote use. The lack of multiplayer does hurt the longevity of the title, but the single-player adventure will stick with you for a long time. Which is good, because this is probably the last we're going to hear from Samus for quite some time, we think. A fitting end to an amazing series.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass\n\nNintendo\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.3\n\nThe DS is the gaming warhorse of the current console crop. It gets some of the roughest, nastiest ports as well as the best and most universally clever and well-suited releases of the year. Phantom Hourglass, while finite, left us reeling. It could be argued that it's not as hard as it could be, but it's no cake-walk. It remains hardware-pushingly pretty, clever, epic in scope and thoroughly entertaining. Above all else, it underlines the series' commitment to careful reinvention and fun.\n\nskate\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.3\n\nskate is one of those games that is on in the background so frequently at IGN AU that it has become something of a gaming staple for us. We feel about skate the way we use to about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the PSX – it's simply the best skating game on the market right now, hands down.\n\nWorld in Conflict\n\nSierra\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.4\n\nSince launch, developer support for WIC has been outstanding – multiple patches have tweaked the few bugs and balance issues that the game shipped with. Its instant access online game, a unique feature that makes it more like a shooter than a strategy game, has proven to be a big success. Fire up WIC any time of the day and you're guaranteed to find thousands of players just itching to give you some radioactive attention.\n\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n\nActivision\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.4\n\nAfter Infinity Ward ditched the World War II shackles and went back to the drawing board, Call of Duty 4 surfaced and blew our minds like an RPG to the face. The game continues to dominate our time on Xbox Live; the single player game, albeit shorter than we'd like, is tremendously fun and gorgeous. Moreover, it's a game that plays almost identically well on all formats. We think there's no finer war shooter on the market going into holiday 2007.\n\nThe Orange Box\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.5\n\nTime may well snatch Game of the Year status from Orange Box when IGN's annual awards are eventually doled out, but there's certainly no denying the impact this boxed set made when it was released. Portal and Team Fortress 2 are astounding in their own ways; both are unique and satisfying with balance and immediate visual panache. The Half-life series, still blowing minds and forming smiles years after HL2's release, continues to leave us shivering with delight at the end of Episode 2. Dollar for dollar, this is the best value release of the year by far.\n\nBioshock\n\n2K Games\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.5\n\nBioshock continues to impress us months after its release. The game's setting is so ripe with imagination and clever design that the levels beg to be replayed. The plasmids are designed with flexibility in mind, the enemies demonstrate impressive AI and the narrative is tightly constructed with depth and logic. It's about the best shooter on the Xbox 360 and most certainly right up there with the finest the PC has ever offered. It's not quite perfect, but it comes damned close. If only Bennett hadn't played it for six hours before realising you need to kill the Big Daddies to save the Little Sisters.\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy\n\nNintendo\n\nIGN AU Rating: 9.7\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy still stands as the best platformer ever made, takes full advantage of the Wii's unique control scheme and it looks a treat. For Nintendo devout, it's a return to form for the portly plumber; for casual gamers, it's a revelation in gameplay, simplicity and accessibility; for Xbox and PlayStation purists, it's a game that can only be viewed with envious eyes. Nintendo brought the magic in 2007 with Super Mario Galaxy.\n\nAustralian News of 2007\n\nIt's been a year of highs and lows in the headlines around Australia this year. These are some of the larger stories that made headlines in Australia during 2007.\n\nOFLC in the News\n\nAOur local content classification board, the OFLC, did its part to filter out the mediocre games from Australian shelves this year. Back in January, the media whip-crackers took the rawhide to Blitz: The League, a move that left the head of Red Ant Australia a tad bit pissed off. Oh well. Here's a tiny violin to play with instead. Similarly, Soldier of Fortune: Payback was banned for a while, presumably for all the explicit violence, dismemberment and other adult content. Violence in a SoF game? We're as shocked as you are. Then, just as suddenly as it was banned, it was unbanned and classified, minus the explosive jets of blood, arms, heads and some ragdolling body effects. Fair enough; shame the game isn't more worthwhile.\n\nThen there's the Manhunt 2 debacle; an ongoing multi-region saga that began with hoo-ha in the US, spread to the UK and wider Europe and ended with the Rockstar offices not even submitting the game for OFLC classification in Australia. This is hardly a shocking move; the last Manhunt game was pulled from shelves out here too, so we're guessing they're not going to bother.\n\nAuran Rolls Over, Plays Dead; Fury Backs Away Slowly\n\nT'was a game called Fury that struck down the mighty Brisbane-based studio of Auran. It was all-or-nothing times for the company and our hats are off for at least taking a risk – even if it didn't pan out. The team invested more than 13 million dollars in bringing Fury out, likely funded in part by the cult hit Trainz.\n\nThis is a blow to the industry in Australia, not to mention to the lives of dozens of Auran's staff, who were laid off when the company filed for Chapter 11. Let us never forget, this was the same company that graced us with the sublime RTS Dark Reign many years ago; if only an Xbox Live Arcade version had been ported or a sequel developed in Fury's place, things might have turned out differently. If only.\n\nBioshock Brings Local Praise, National Pride\n\n2K Australia comprises half of the development team behind the wondrous and waterlogged shooter, Bioshock. Doesn't that fill you with all sorts of patriotism? Green and gold national pride? Doesn't that make you want to take your akubra with the dangling corks, a didgeridoo and a hunk of dried kangaroo meat with you in a dusty swag, while you scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge and proclaim your love for this big, brown land to all and sundry? Maybe you could paint 'Atlas was right' in big red letters down the side of the Opera House. Hey - it worked for the 'no war' guys, right?\n\nBut I digress. Bioshock's co-development is a big win for the Australian industry, demonstrating a world-leading level of talent and quality at a local level. It's also a pleasant reminder that not every game that comes out in Australia is a giant sell-out turd. Okay, maybe 'turd' is a little strong; companies like IR Gurus (now 'Transmission Games') and Creative Assembly are consistently putting out quality releases, and Krome and Blue Tongue are both hard at work on some cool projects. Hopefully, 2008 will be even stronger for local development.\n\nNintendo Back on Top Down Under\n\nAfter two lukewarm console releases in a row (the Nintendo 64 and Gamecube both started strongly but fizzled in Australia), the Nintendo Wii has cemented itself in the retail scene. The telling figures are 250,000 Wiis sold, along with more than 900,000 DS units. Yes, those are official, quotable figures provided by GfK, via Nintendo Australia's PR arm. Pretty astounding, given the limited time in the market for both platforms, coupled with Australia's relatively small population.\n\nThe current Wii shortage is no doubt slowing sales and impacting Nintendo's short-term position in the market, but if the supply can meet demand over Christmas and into Easter next year, then Nintendo may finally achieve the return to the golden era of the late 80s it's been striving for all this time. Microsoft and Sony may have something to say about that, however, since both platforms are really picking up pace, thanks to aggressive pricing and strong releases on both platforms going into Christmas. 2008 is going to be a very telling year – but even if nobody in Australia bought another Wii or DS, Nintendo have surpassed their sales for GC and GBA in a year for the Wii and two for the DS. Astounding.\n\nIEAA Pushes Forward, But No 'R' Rating\n\nThe Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia continued its efforts to push for R classification, a 40% tax break for game development and wider recognition for the gaming industry's contribution to the economy throughout 2007. The year began with its announcement that game sales in Australia had just surpassed $925 million for the previous year, which then topped a billion dollars by July, according to Chris Hanlon, IEAA CEO. We had a chat with him about the billion dollar figure, what this means for the industry, and about the lack of an R rating and what the IEAA is doing to try and get one introduced.\n\nNew figures are being compiled right now for release in January 2008. At this stage, with a change of government, perhaps it's time for the IEAA to reconvene with each state OFLC representative and push for that elusive R rating. The average age of gamers isn't getting any younger, after all.\n\nPrice Wars Begin; Wallets the First Casualty\n\nIt's all Nintendo's fault; they had to go and release a console that almost anyone could afford, at less than half the price of the PS3, which was still more expensive than the 360. That caused Microsoft (sorry, Micro$oft) to laugh heartily until – snap – Sony introduced a 'Value Pack' that included two games for the same AU$999.95 price – since a price drop was not on the cards, given the relative infancy of the console and the manufacturing costs involved. Then came the Xbox retaliation attack – the ultra-budget $399.95 Xbox 360 Arcade Pack; a ringing slap back at Sony who, for a minute there, thought they had the upper hand.\n\nThe result? Sony bumped off the 60GB model altogether, dropping the 20GB model too and introducing a compromise of sorts: a 40GB HDMI model without backwards compatibility and minus two USB ports. That bad boy retails for a more approachable AU$699.95. Then, just to complicate the retail scene further, the 120GB 360 Elite popped onto shelves at AU$729. Sony took another step into gold-standard territory with the 80GB PS3 in Japan and the US. Of course, Nintendo has, all the while, been sitting back and watching its Wiis and DSs fly off shelves with a minimum of price adjustments and the consumer at the point-of-sale has to content with multiple SKUs for the 360 and PS3, which can be downright baffling for mums and dads Australia-wide. Truly, begun, the price wars have.\n\nIGN AU – One Year in Australia; Still Insane\n\nSo look at us – naysayers said we'd sink and, by the gods, we swam like performance-enhanced Olympians with snorkels for noses. It's been a bumper year for the site, with more than 800 AU-branded pieces of news, reviews, interviews and weirdness contributed to the site. Yikes.\n\nWe also doubled our editorial staff to, erm, four. Cam Shea joined Bennett and I at the start of January and I think we got our money's worth with that ginger nut. His bright-eyed enthusiasm and churlish tomfoolery has brightened our dank, subterranean office no-end. That's why it's hard for us to tell him, in this very public manner, that he's fired and also adopted. Tough break there, buddy. Walk it off.\n\nWe also welcome Joanna Cohen as our chipper Rotten Tomatoes commandant. Her knowledge of film from late 60s-era crime flicks to 80s-era John Hughes right-of-passage movies and ability to put up with the near-unbearable stench of gamer-sweat and foul language has earned our respect, trust, and even a little jealousy for her clearly malfunctioning nasal passages and ear canals. Welcome.\n\nA Glimpse at 2008\n\nIf there's a sure fire way to make an ass of yourself, it's to get blind drunk at the office Christmas party and have the mistaken belief that you're actually a good dancer. We already did this at last week's Aussie IGN Beerathon, so the next best thing is to make our Aussie predictions for the gaming industry in 2008. We figure that if we make the list long enough, and fill it with plenty of vague predictions, we're bound to get at least one correct. Here we go.\n\n2008 – The year of the Micro-transaction and downloadable content\n\nForgetting the odd horse armour fiasco, micro-transactions proved their worth in 2007. Once feared and loathed more than a wall-hacking Counter-Striker, gamer scepticism towards these bite-sized gaming experiences died down thanks to the wealth of quality affordable content that hit the scene in '07. No longer do gamers need to spend hours scouring MAME forums to figure out how to get Pac-Man running on their PC – simply plug your credit card details into your console and bam, 10 minutes later you're chewing pills like a 16 year old at a rave. It's not just the classics that are convincing gamers to drop a few dollars here and there – we've also seen some impressive new titles hit the console's digital distribution system. The likes of Flow and Undertow have shown that we needn't fork out a mint for a compelling game experience.\n\nBut these two are just a hint of what's to come. As the cost of big-budget titles continues to skyrocket, a new niche is opening up at the lower end. Now that gamers have proven to be willing to pay for these gaming-lite experiences, the first parties are handing over the keys to the two dollar kingdom. Microsoft's XNA and Nintendo's WiiWare are giving backyard developers the chance to turn their zany sheep-tossing games into a commercial reality. Now we just need a peripheral to swallow the shrapnel filling up the coin jar on top of the fridge. PS3 Flexes its Muscles\n\nThe tide has already turned for the PS3, ever since its strong showing at this year's E3. Think about it - when's the last time you heard it referred to as a George Foreman Grill or the mention of giant crabs (visits to STD clinics not included). Yep, 2008 should finally prove to be the year that the PS3 comes of age.\n\nRatchet and Clank Future and Uncharted: Drake's Fortune both proved that the PS3 isn't a bad home for exclusive titles, and also show that developers are getting comfy with the Cell processor's intricacies. The recent price drop has resulted in a strong sales surge, but there's one piece of upcoming software that should have an even more positive effect.\n\nMGS4 is the PS3's Halo, and here's a few predictions within a prediction on this hotly anticipated snake-fest. Firstly, it's going to have more references to cock than the local chicken farm. Secondly, we reckon it's going to get delayed even further than the recent slippage. It's Hideo's baby, and he's going to take his own sweet time with it. Besides, it takes a lot of time to come up with so many subtle references to Snake's homosexuality.\n\nIf and when it ever arrives, Home is sure to prove a hit with no lifers Second Lifers, while that little optical drive is looking to be one of the console's main selling points. Which is a nice segue to our next prediction. HD-DVD = Hugely Dead Digital Versatile Disc\n\nAccording to Michael Bay, HD-DVD is simply an invention by Microsoft to kill the entire HD optical disk market. We're more inclined to think Mr Bay should lay off the crack, but we do think that HD-DVD is going to be the BetaMax for our generation.\n\nOur chief reasoning is the fact that sales of Blu-ray titles are currently pummelling HD-DVD into a bloody smear on the HD landscape. The recent introduction of HD-DVD players that cost less than a condo in the Swiss Alps won't do much to aid the flagging format – most consumers are happy to pay a few hundred bucks more for a Blu-ray player, as this format has a larger library of blockbuster titles. The recent rumour of Time Warner moving to Blu-ray is yet another nail in the coffin for HD-DVD. If Blu-ray does win the fight, it's a powerful weapon in the PS3's arsenal. Third Parties *heart* Xbox 360\n\nCasting an eye over the list of 2008 games reveals what we already knew – apart from a few big name exclusives, most of the third party titles are coming to both PS3 and 360. With a larger install base the 360 is already going to be the favourite for these cross platform titles. More compelling is the fact that titles developed for both platforms tend to run much better on the 360, as we recently saw with The Orange Box, which suffered from game-breaking framerate issues. Combine these two factors, and developers will see the 360 as the lead platform when making titles that span both platforms. But it's not going to have quite the lead that it enjoyed last year, as the PS3 finally starts to gain momentum. Wii Will Rock You\n\nA cunningly engineered shortage to inflate user demand, or a severe lack of planning – either way, there still weren't enough Wii's to satisfy the demand of newfound Nintendo lovers at the end of 2007. We're leaning towards the severe lack of planning – but Nintendo can be forgiven for not anticipating just how wildly successful the Wii was going to be. Ninty would be remiss not to fill the gap between demand and supply that currently exists for the Wii. We also think that Wii Fit is going to be a super smash hit. While hardcore gamers would rather eat a control pad than be caught dead using it, the Wii target audience will find the promise of exertainment alluring. Yes, extertainment (hey, it's better than entercise!)\n\nSadly, the rest of the line-up for Wii is looking exceptionally wiik. Other than Super Smash Bros Brawl and Mario Kart, there's a distinct lack of first party software on the horizon. And we all know how great the third party games for Wii have been – let's hope they start to raise the bar in 2008. God Save The PC\n\nThe woeful sales figures for Crysis and Unreal Tournament 3 have highlighted the worrying state of gaming on the PC. They weren't so much a drop in the bucket of overall game sales, as they were a sad tear of despair in an ocean of console success. Why is the PC struggling so much at the moment? We've got a few theories…\n\nFor starters, console games are still offering visuals that rival, if not better, most PC games. This is very different to prior console/PC cycles, where PC graphics always leapfrogged the console's a year after a console's launch. The fact that Vista demolishes game performance and reliability more quickly than a sledgehammer to the hard drive surely hasn't helped matters. DirectX 10 hasn't delivered on any of its massive promises either – its flagship title, Crysis, requires DX10 effects to be disabled to be playable on anything but the most NASA-like of hardware. Finally, it appears as if PC hardware evolution has slowed as well – video cards that were released a year ago are still top of the pile.\n\nIt all adds up to a rather bleak year for PC gaming. Combine this with an even bleaker range of software (when compared to the much larger range coming to the consoles), and our beloved PC is going to need all the help it can get. Clash of the Titans\n\nWith the recent merger of Vivendi and Activision, we've got a new gaming behemoth on the block. We're waiting with baited breath to play World of Guitarcraft against Chinese song-miners in 2008. Don't expect EA to sit back and watch its market lead get eaten away though – it's been on the prowl for an acquisition target for quite some time.\n\nOur top pick for EA's lunch is still Ubisoft, regardless of the fact that Assassin's Creed did so well (many analysts argue that the resulting rise in Ubisoft's share price has made Ubi too expensive for EA). But if the French don't surrender to EA (not likely), next in line is THQ – no other publisher is big enough to give EA the range and revenue it needs to clamber back to the top of its throne. Australia – the Digital Sloth\n\nLet's face it – when it comes to broadband, Australia is stuck somewhere in the 16th century. Sure, we've got nice speeds thanks to ADSL2+, but we're limited with how we can use it due to ridiculous data charges. While our US cousins get 100GB or more to play with each month, we're limited to 20GB if we're lucky. That's just over 2 DVDs worth of data for an entire month.\n\nAs a result, while the rest of the western world charges forwards with digital distribution of movies and games, we're going to be stuck using those antiquated shiny Frisbee things for quite some time. The potential for our PS3s and 360s to become the multimedia hubs they're meant to be is severely limited, and we can't even get an electronic program guide for our Windows Media Centres (unless you don't mind paying a couple of bucks a week for IceTV or similar services).\n\nPC 2007 Year in Review\n\nDan, Steve, and Charles give you the rundown on the world's most venerable gaming platform.\n\n2007 Year in Review: PS2 | PSP | PS3\n\nChris, Greg, Jeff and Ryan take care of PlayStation's double-oh-seven.\n\n2007 Xbox 360 Year in Review\n\nHil, Erik and Nate recap the year that brought us Halo 3.\n\nWii 2007 Year in Review\n\nMatt and Mark discuss 2007's Nintendos and Nintendon'ts.\n\nNintendo DS 2007 Year in Review\n\nCraig breaks the year down for the dual-screen portable.\n\nWireless 2007 Year in Review\n\nBefore 2008 rings in, Levi shows us what was up on cell phones in 2007.\n\n<!--"
