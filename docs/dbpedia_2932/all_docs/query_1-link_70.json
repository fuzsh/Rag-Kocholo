        "text": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Leveling Up FAQ =============================================================================== Table of Contents ===============================================================================\n\nIntroduction\n\nEnemies\n\nLevels\n\nConclusion\n\nSection: I =============================================================================== Introduction =============================================================================== The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King has a unique leveling up system. Every enemy slain by your character gains you experience based on your kill rating. You can either kill an enemy with a Fair, Good, Excellent, or Perfect (that's the order from worst to best). The best way to gain experience points is to slay enemies with a Perfect rating. The best way to get one, is to use one of the three Bane moves (Orc, Warrior, Sauron). Which can be used on Orcs (Orc Bane), Easterlings (Warrior Bane), and on Uruk-Hai (Sauron). However, the Banes cannot be used on all enemies. The catch is that the enemy must attack you, you must then parry it, then press square (or whatever the button is for your version; It'll list it on the upgrade screen). With that, most enemies the Banes work on. However, Archers (enemies that attack with a bow and arrow, or a crossbow), the Banes do not work on. If you wish to get experience fast, the best level would be The Southern Gate (once you gain the Bane of Sauron). Use a Bane on either an Orc or Uruk-Hai, then slay as many as you can before your Perfect runs out (each Uruk-Hai is worth 600, an Orc is worth 300 with a Perfect). With around 250 enemies, you can easily gain around 120,000 experience per each time you beat the level killing almost every enemy with a Perfect. All other levels are not as good for experience (The Palantir of Sauron is even better then The Southern Gate, but it is by far the hardest level in the game, close to impossible for a starting player without cheats). Section: II =============================================================================== Enemies =============================================================================== Here is the experience you gain for each enemy slain with every rating:\n\nRegular Uruk-HaiRatingExperienceFair150Good300Excellent450Perfect600\n\nUruk-Hai (Black Armored)RatingExperienceFair90Good180Excellent240Perfect360\n\nUruk-Hai ArchersRatingExperienceFair150Good300Excellent450Perfect600\n\nOrcRatingExperienceFair75Good150Excellent225Perfect300\n\nShielded OrcRatingExperienceFair120Good240Excellent360Perfect480\n\nDead SoldierRatingExperienceFair75Good150Excellent225Perfect300\n\nSpiderRatingExperienceFair75Good150Excellent200 *Perfect300\n\n* - A mess up on EA's part, it should be 225.\n\nEasterlingRatingExperienceFair150Good300Excellent450Perfect600\n\nMumakilRatingExperienceFair1,000Good1,000Excellent1,000Perfect1,000\n\nLife Barred EnemiesRatingExperienceFair300Good600Excellent900Perfect1,200\n\nMouth Of SauronRatingExperienceFair2,000Good2,000Excellent2,000Perfect2,000\n\nSnagaRatingExperienceFair2,000Good2,000Excellent2,000Perfect2,000\n\nSection: III =============================================================================== Levels =============================================================================== And now for the levels. I listed 1 - 300, but to be honest, most people will never reach that. Most people won't reach over 1,000,000 experience for one character (which is only level 57). There is a formula to finding out levels. Please note, it's the best I could come up with. It may be one level off, but it'll either be the level, or you need to add one. Currect experience - 445,000 / 15,000 + 20 = The level. If you can't understand the signs, I'll spell it out for you. Your current experience minus 445,000, divided by 15,000, plus 20. Here's an example: 934,600 (current experience) - 445,000 (489,600) / 15,000 (32.64) + 20 = 52. Now let me explain it. You subtract 445,000 because that's the first 20 levels (and they're not all the same). You then divide that number by 15,000 (because every level after level 20 you need only 15,000 experience to level up). You then add 20 because those are the levels you subtracted in the first place (445,000). Overall it isn't 100% accurate (more like 99%), but it's better then nothing. Here are levels 1 - 300:\n\nLeveling Up ChartLevelExperience Points Needed1023,000310,000425,000540,000655,000770,000885,0009115,00010145,00011175,00012205,00013235,00014265,00015295,00016325,00017355,00018385,00019415,00020445,00021460,00022475,00023490,00024505,00025520,00026535,00027550,00028565,00029580,00030595,00031610,00032625,00033640,00034655,00035670,00036685,00037700,00038715,00039730,00040745,00041760,00042775,00043790,00044805,00045820,00046835,00047850,00048865,00049880,00050895,00051910,00052925,00053940,00054955,00055970,00056985,000571,000,000581,015,000591,030,000601,045,000611,060,000621,075,000631,090,000641,105,000651,120,000661,130,000671,150,000681,165,000691,180,000701,195,000711,121,000721,225,000731,240,000741,255,000751,270,000761,285,000771,300,000781,315,000791,330,000801,345,000811,360,000821,375,000831,390,000841,405,000851,420,000861,435,000871,450,000881,465,000891,480,000901,495,000911,510,000921,525,000931,540,000941,555,000951,570,000961,585,000971,600,000981,615,000991,630,0001001,645,0001011,660,0001021,675,0001031,690,0001041,705,0001051,720,0001061,735,0001071,750,0001081,765,0001091,780,0001101,795,0001111,810,0001121,825,0001131,840,0001141,855,0001151,870,0001161,885,0001171,900,0001181,915,0001191,930,0001201,945,0001211,960,001221,975,0001231,990,0001242,005,0001252,020,0001262,035,0001272,050,0001282,065,0001292,080,0001302,095,0001312,110,0001322,125,0001332,140,0001342,155,0001352,170,0001362,185,0001372,200,0001382,215,0001392,230,0001402,245,0001412,260,0001422,275,0001432,290,0001442,305,0001452,320,0001462,335,0001472,350,0001482,365,0001492,380,0001502,395,0001512,410,0001522,425,0001532,440,0001542,455,0001552,470,0001562,485,0001572,500,0001582,515,0001592,530,0001602,545,0001612,560,0001622,575,0001632,590,0001642,605,0001652,620,0001662,635,0001672,650,0001682,665,0001692,680,0001702,695,0001712,710,0001722,725,0001732,740,0001742,755,0001752,770,0001762,785,0001772,800,0001782,815,0001792,830,0001802,845,0001812,860,0001822,875,0001832,890,0001842,905,0001852,920,0001862,935,0001872,950,0001882,965,0001892,980,0001902,995,0001913,010,0001923,025,0001933,040,0001943,055,0001953,070,0001963,085,0001973,100,0001983,115,0001993,130,0002003,145,0002013,160,0002023,175,0002033,190,0002043,205,0002053,220,0002063,235,0002073,250,0002083,265,0002093,280,0002103,295,0002113,310,0002123,325,0002133,340,0002143,355,0002153,370,0002163,385,0002173,400,0002183,415,0002193,430,0002203,445,0002213,460,0002223,475,0002233,490,0002243,505,0002253,520,0002263,535,0002273,550,0002283,565,0002293,580,0002303,595,0002313,610,0002323,625,0002333,640,0002343,655,0002353,670,0002363,685,0002373,700,0002383,715,0002393,730,0002403,745,0002413,760,0002423,775,0002433,790,0002443,805,0002453,820,0002463,835,0002473,850,0002483,865,0002493,880,0002503,895,0002513,910,0002523,925,0002533,940,0002543,955,0002553,970,0002563,985,0002574,000,0002584,015,0002594,030,0002604,045,0002614,060,0002624,075,0002634,090,0002644,105,0002654,120,0002664,135,0002674,150,0002684,165,0002694,180,0002704,195,0002714,210,0002724,225,0002734,240,0002744,255,0002754,270,0002764,285,0002774,300,0002784,315,0002794,330,0002804,345,0002814,360,0002824,375,0002834,390,0002844,405,0002854,420,0002864,435,0002874,450,0002884,465,0002894,480,0002904,495,0002914,510,0002924,525,0002934,540,0002944,555,0002954,570,0002964,585,0002974,600,0002984,615,0002994,630,0003004,645,000\n\nSection: IV =============================================================================== Conclusion =============================================================================== I thank you for reading this, and I hope it helped you find your level.
