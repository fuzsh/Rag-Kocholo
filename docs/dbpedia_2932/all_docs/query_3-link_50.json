        "text": "It took one ring to rule them all, and 11 Oscars to make movie history. Ten years ago this month, The Return of the King, the third and final chapter in The Lord of the Rings franchise, did the unthinkable: it swept the Academy Awards, winning all 11 categories it was nominated for, including best picture.\n\nOn paper, the film––and the franchise as a whole––was the polar opposite of Oscar bait. These were fantasy films filled with dwarves and hobbits and elves and magic rings. They were directed by a filmmaker known for low-budget horror flicks; cast with a group of unknown actors few audiences could pick out of a lineup; and written, planned, shot, and edited all in New Zealand, far away from the cozy awards-friendly confines of sunny Los Angeles.\n\nWhat Oscar cognoscenti didn’t see from the outset, they would come to realize by 2001, when The Fellowship of the Ring was released to overwhelming critical acclaim. The first chapter would go on to nab 13 nominations––a series high––but only come away with technical awards. A year later, The Two Towers grabbed six nods, but it too lost out on best picture. That set the stage for the final movie, as New Line focused its attention on getting Peter Jackson and the J. R. R. Tolkien-based series the Academy recognition it deserved.\n\nIn honor of the 10th anniversary of the The Return of the King’s awards sweep, VF Hollywood pieced together the film’s entire Oscar campaign. Speaking with more than a dozen people involved with the effort––from New Line executives to designers to consultants––we were able to paint a complete picture of how a fantasy film was able to win 11 Academy Awards––including the granddaddy of them all, best picture––and change the trajectory of the Oscars.\n\nIn 1999, New Line green-lit three consecutive Lord of the Rings films to shoot over a span of 18 months, an incredibly risky proposition for a studio known more for its indie fare. However, then co-C.E.O.s Michael Lynne and Bob Shaye, along with other New Line executives, were confident in the product––and in the awards that could follow.\n\nRussell Schwartz (president of theatrical marketing, New Line, in 2004): The question about the Academy campaign was, was it worth doing? Now when you have a trilogy, it’s very hard not to at least give the first one its due. But again, we wanted to make sure we had the confidence level from early screenings. When you start feeling comfortable about that, then thoughts of the Academy start creeping into your mind.\n\nChristina Kounelias (executive vice president, marketing, New Line, in 2004): [It] was basically two years of “They’re not going to get it, they’re not going to get it, they have to get it on Return of the King.” So our job, and I think we did it well, was to create this sense of inevitability around the movie.\n\nRussell Schwartz: The biggest problem––and this started with Fellowship––was we had the dreaded F word; we were the fantasy movie, and there was no fantasy movies that ever won for best picture.\n\nIn order to secure a best-picture win on the third movie, Schwartz brought in a small army of veteran publicists and awards consultants to assist New Line. Along with Gail Brounstein, who had worked on the previous two Lord of the Rings Oscar runs, Schwartz hired David Horowitz, Johnny Friedkin, Melody Korenbrot, and Ronni Chasen, along with Allan Mayer––who was primarily known for handling celebrity P.R. crises. The strategy was clear: leave nothing to chance.\n\nRussell Schwartz: I said to them all, “Guys I am hiring you because it will be a crisis if we don’t win this fucking thing.”\n\nAllan Mayer (managing director and head of entertainment, Sitrick and Co., in 2004): I had worked with the folks at New Line on a number of projects over the years. Russell Schwartz and Christina Kounelias decided it would probably be helpful to bring someone in who wasn’t specifically an awards campaign person––basically just a strategist who could think two or three steps ahead.\n\nRussell Schwartz: Johnny Friedkin was an old-time marketing guy. He worked at studios in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and he was in touch with the older guard. We figured we needed someone who could talk to that group to help explain what the movie was to people who were in the 70-plus age [range] and had no idea what a fantasy movie was and why they should vote for it.\n\nAllan Mayer: Running an Oscar campaign is really not all that different from running a small political campaign. You’ve got 6,000 voters you have to appeal to and you have a very restrictive set of rules.\n\nChristina Kounelias: It was about reach and different constituencies. It was about trying to communicate our messaging as effectively as possible. Different people had different functions. I think we wanted to work with the smartest people we knew.\n\nIn addition to hiring a team of Oscar consultants, New Line decided to increase its campaign budget in order to give the film maximum visibility among potential voters.\n\nRussell Schwartz: We spent very aggressively but not to the point where people were saying, “Oh, they’re overspending, it’s ridiculous.” We made sure to be in the fight. [. . .] It was between $5 and $10 [million] on the first two, and over $10 [million] on the third.\n\nChristina Kounelias: It was still very modest by most people’s standards, but for us I think it was an aggressive campaign, and more than we had done typically.\n\nRussell Schwartz: When you’re going for every category, which we felt we had to do, we couldn’t not spend. You had to still present the image that this movie was Academy-worthy; you were in the fight, so we couldn’t really notch it down too much.\n\nBarrie M. Osborne (producer, The Lord of the Rings franchise): We pushed to nominate everything we thought had a chance of winning.\n\nGail Brounstein (veteran Oscar consultant): For the last one I know we submitted most of the actors in the supporting category. I think we submitted Elijah in the best-actor category; we submitted Andy Serkis as well.\n\nRolf Mittweg (president and chief operating officer, worldwide distribution and marketing, New Line, in 2004): I think [Andy’s] performance was truly outstanding, because being the man in the suit, you have to do a tremendous amount of acting under the most unusual circumstances. I think he definitely deserved a shot. We had to try it.\n\nThe advertising strategy.\n\nLaura Carrillo (senior vice president, creative advertising, New Line, in 2004): We had selected The Ant Farm to be the agency of choice for the entire trilogy, from audio through print. I think the flow you see within the ads comes from this agency being with us for five years as we developed the campaign.\n\nJulian Hills (president of print advertising, The Ant Farm, in 2004): If you look at the [campaigns for] Fellowship and The Two Towers . . . they are a bit all over the place. They will use a border for some, a different typeface for another––there is no real cohesive look to them. What we did for Return of the King, we created a look that was very specific. We created sort of a sub-brand. It was obviously Lord of the Rings, it was obviously Return of the King, but it was obviously the Academy campaign. When you looked at the Hollywood Reporter and you came to one of these ads, there was absolutely no doubt in your mind what you were looking at.\n\nLaura Carrillo: I remember the ads didn’t have a lot of flair––we didn’t have to trick them out––we just let the photography simply speak to the movie without having a lot of graphics or type.\n\nJulian Hills: We made a wall of hundreds and hundreds of images from both unit photography and frame grabs from the film itself. And what we would do is try to create some sort of narrative or character arc. For instance, Frodo going from the avuncular little hobbit to the really nasty, dirty ring-addicted hobbit that he was in the last film. . . . Laura would come by, and we would spend hours in front of this wall, picking and choosing what we were going to [use] that week.\n\nLaura Carrillo: We also did this insert where we played sort of a numbers game: the amount of days we shot, the amount of extras, the commitment from the actors, from Peter, the amount of material and hours of labor that it took to get this trilogy accomplished.\n\nRussell Schwartz: [It was] one of our coolest ads. It was our first time we went beyond the specific movie and campaigned for the trilogy, because we knew this was our shot. Some people accused us, saying “Well, you can’t campaign for the trilogy, you can only campaign for this movie.” Again, it was the last gasp. What they’re voting for was the scope of the trilogy, not necessarily the individual [film].\n\nAny good Oscar campaign includes press events, and The Return of the King was no different. For the third movie, New Line set up a round of screenings, dinners and Q&As with the actors and filmmakers to help get the word out.\n\nRussell Schwartz: We had a lot of Q&As, the hobbits showed up at a couple awards screenings. It was all about making sure that the movie was humble in its origins.\n\nChristina Kounelias: We tried to do a lot of ensemble booking [with the actors] as a group, because I think that they enjoyed it. It was everybody, it was Elijah [Wood], it was Orlando [Bloom], the two actors who played Merry and Pippin [Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd], Viggo [Mortensen] was also involved, and, of course, Ian McKellen did a lot.\n\nOn January 27, 2004, after months of campaigning, the nominations were finally announced.\n\nGordon Paddison (executive vice president, integrated marketing, New Line, in 2004): You’re [at the office] at whatever time of the morning it was, ready to update [ads], and you’re sitting there with GIF animations and trying to put everything together so you can have the copy ready by seven A.M. And then you get 11 of these things, and you go, “Excuse me? What just happened?”\n\nRussell Schwartz: The most grueling thing to us was the fact that we got no actor nominations, which was bizarre. Because you had Ian and Viggo; everybody was great in the movie.\n\nChristina Kounelias: We really fought very hard for the actors. Unfortunately, because of the spectacle of it all, they wound up getting [shut out].\n\nAfter the nominations, the Oscar oddsmakers got to work, predicting The Return of the King*’s chances, which were good.*\n\nRussell Schwartz: At that point, all the prognosticators were saying that we were certainly in the lead. But that’s a very tricky place to be. If you’ve done these kind of things before, the last thing you want to do is be the frontrunner too early. In many cases, we were the frontrunner early on and you have to maintain that momentum. It’s very, very hard. A lot of movies run out of steam.\n\nLaura Carrillo: We weren’t sure, you know? Even with the box-office success, even with the campaign, even with the amount of materials we put out for three years, you still wonder, can a movie like this, which can be strictly perceived as a fantasy film, win best picture?\n\nTom O’Neil (founder, GoldDerby.com, Oscar expert): It had to be third time’s the charm for it to win. The first installment lead with the most nominations and still managed to lose. By the time The Two Towers lost, there was a feeling of a major crime having been committed, and that they had to make it up. The stakes weren’t just the most successful film franchise in Hollywood history. It was a statement that begged to be made about the Oscars itself, which was: how is it possible that these 6,000 members of the Motion Picture Academy, who earned their living creating fantasies on the silver screen, why can’t they ever honor a fantasy film for best picture? The fact that they wouldn’t do it showed them to be enormous hypocrites, that they only consider heavy-handed stuffy dramas to be great films. So, by the time The Return of the King came back at the end of the race, I think the fans would have physically torn down the Motion Picture Academy with their bare hands if they had lost again.\n\nAllan Mayer: On the Friday before the awards, Russell and Christina and I had lunch in Beverly Hills. There was nothing more we could do at that point. The votes were all in and the die was cast. Russell said, half-jokingly, “Well, either we win on Sunday or we all look for new jobs on Monday,” and he was not entirely kidding. I was just a consultant, but for the two of them, they were totally on the line. The stakes were very high.\n\nOn February 29, 2004, at the Kodak Theater (now the Dolby Theatre) in Los Angeles, The Return of the King made Oscar history, sweeping all 11 categories it was nominated for, including best picture.\n\nBob Shaye (co-C.E.O., New Line, in 2004): When we went to sit down [before the ceremony], Michael immediately said to the people who were sitting to our left, which was the pathway to the stage, “We may have to get up and walk out in the middle, so be sure to get ready to let us stand up and walk through.”\n\nMichael Lynne (co-C.E.O., New Line, in 2004): That was my optimism at work. [laughs]\n\nChristina Kounelias: I think Gail, Russell, and I were [sitting] close together. I remember we’d won a few awards, and then Gail turned to me and said, “We’re six for six.” That’s when it dawned on me that we could have a clean sweep.\n\nBarrie M. Osborne: Once we started winning, it became increasingly more and more exciting for us.\n\nLaura Carrillo: A handful of people from the company got to go to the actual Oscars. The rest of the company was in this big banquet party room with monitors. One by one, as we started to win every single category, there was absolute joy–– tears, hugging, celebration, that whole thing.\n\nRussell Schwartz: I remember the person who ended up winning for best foreign language film, the director just blurted out, “Thank God the Lord of the Rings was not in this category.”\n\nMichael Lynne: When the [best picture] moment came, it was extraordinary.\n\nBob Shaye: When Spielberg said, “Let’s see what we got here,” and he slowly opened the Oscar envelope, and then with his inimitable dramatic pause looked up and said, “It’s a clean sweep,” that was pretty exciting.\n\nMark Ordesky (executive producer, Lord of the Rings series): When the envelope was opened, I could feel my head vibrating, like you could feel yourself disassociating from your own body, and then everything sort of slowed down. And then when the film won, there was this sort of blood rush, and you just felt it was a wonderful culmination. You know, I’ve known Peter since probably 1987, so for me, personally, I felt just an immense joy for him and for the New Zealand crew.\n\nChristina Kounelias: I remember Russell saying to me, “Christina, it doesn’t get better than this.”\n\nMichael Lynne: I remember walking up there with Bob and standing there on the stage with a whole group of us from the film.\n\nBob Shaye: I was afraid that they were going to come up and drag us down, because there was a rule that you weren’t supposed to [have that many people] up there. Ever since one of our ignoble competitors had brought eight people up for some movie, the Academy made [the] rule that only three producers could be up there. And there was Peter and Fran [Walsh] and I forget who else, so Michael just decided we were going up.\n\nMichael Lynne: I wasn’t sitting in my seat. And anyway, I already told those people next to us that I was going. [laughs]\n\nIn the end, the months New Line spent carefully crafting an Oscar campaign ended up paying off. However, it wasn’t the end of the celebration. The studio had worked its tail off to lead The Return of the King to Oscar glory––which is why David Tuckerman, New Line’s head of distribution, got the idea of giving each New Line executive a (fitting) gift.\n\nDavid Tuckerman (domestic-distribution president, New Line, in 2004): We were all trying to figure out some way to celebrate this thing. I just sat there and said, “You know what? Let me find out how much it’s going to cost us to make a ring. Because it is Lord of the Rings.” And that’s what happened. We made 12 of those rings, and 12 people at New Line got them. It looks just like a Super Bowl ring, except it’s not as expensive.\n\nRolf Mittweg: That was David’s idea. He worked that out all by himself. I just told him don’t spend an outrageous amount of money [laughs].\n\nRussell Schwartz: I haven’t seen it in a long time, mine is somewhere in the house.\n\nMark Ordesky: I remember thinking it was pretty funny that a series of films about one ring and multiple rings for 11 kings and dwarf kings, that that’s how it was being acknowledged.\n\nThe entire The Lord of the Rings franchise had an enormous effect on the way Hollywood approaches fantasy films. But whether The Return of the King actually changed the trajectory of the Oscars is still up for debate.\n\nMark Harris (Grantland and Entertainment Weekly columnist): One effect that it had was people could no longer say “Well that could never happen. Avatar could never win because no film in this genre has ever [won].” But, you know, four or five years later, we [had] The Dark Knight––a movie that was taken very seriously by critics––getting eight nominations, and still failing to get a best-picture nomination, and everybody saying, “This is completely unfair, this movie is only being locked out because of its genre.” So it would be lovely to say that Return of the King shattered the glass ceiling and that other movies then soared past it, but I don’t think that’s really how it played in the history of the Academy Awards.\n\nMichael Lynne: I think these films sort of stand on their own and are so idiosyncratic year by year that it’s hard to say whether, for example, [a genre film like] Gravity would be treated any differently if there hadn’t been Lord of the Rings. I am not sure.\n\nRussell Schwartz: You know, the Academy is still a pretty traditional group. And I think what’s great about the legacy is it happened, it shows that it could happen again. I am sure it will happen again.\n\nMark Ordesky: One of the greatest things that New Line did to assure the Academy’s attention, without even knowing it, was simply to green-light three films simultaneously in a never-before-done way. When you look at the Oscar campaigns right now, when you look at a film like, say, Gravity, which is not only a fantastic film but audacious in terms of its technical ambition, its storytelling ambition, I think the Academy responds to those kinds of things.\n\nMichael Lynne: There was a line from Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) that’s kind of a voiceover in the mind of Frodo, that says, “Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.” And I think that thought was in everything we did, and I think particularly what we did when we approached the Academy. So it wasn’t our intention to make this thing seem like the greatest blockbuster of all, but more like the most moving dramatic story you could have in the context of a different genre."
