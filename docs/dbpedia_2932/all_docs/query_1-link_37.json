        "text": "Greatest games of all time lists have, for all time, gone the same way; a team of video game journalists sit down and put together a ranking that is almost predetermined – a seemingly canonical hall of fame that attempts to cover off as many bases as possible. Here at GQ, we thought we’d embrace chaos instead. Rather than shuffle Ocarina of Time, Dark Souls and Ico across a big list according to our own whims, we decided to get our friends involved.\n\nSo we gave the industry at large a blank canvas on which to determine their own criteria of “best”, to see where the chosen games differ – and where they’re similar – to the traditionally accepted canon. That meant gathering together a massive collective of our favourite developers, streamers, directors and journalists in the business. Think of it as an “Avengers assemble” moment.\n\nEach voter had one task: pick a personally ranked top ten list. A game in first receives 10 points. A game in 10th place receives 1 point. We invited 300 individuals to participate, and received 239 final lists with an incredible 652 games receiving one vote or more. Our winner not only received the most votes, but also placed in people’s Number 1 more than any other rival.\n\nFor us, the full list is one of many different stories, from surprising newcomers like 2019’s Disco Elysium making an incredibly deep run in the rankings, to a complete absence of mega-franchise names such as Assassin’s Creed. It’s a mix of new, old and very old, with blockbusters and indies, from every genre and from studios in every corner of the world. There are familiar faces – often in surprising places – and a couple of inclusions we didn’t simply didn’t expect. You can see how it all shook out below…\n\n100. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2004)\n\nBioware // Xbox, PC\n\nThe greatest Star Wars game ever made doesn’t mention a Skywalker or a Palpatine. Bioware’s magnificent prequel tale offers up a story that feels simultaneously like the space operatics of Star Wars and the personal sci-fi of Bioware, with memorable characters, a shocking late-game reveal, and worlds you never saw in Lucas’ films. A remake was announced in 2021.\n\n99. Rez (2001)\n\nNintendo // NES\n\nIf ever you find yourself questioning Shigeru Miyamoto’s genius, then know that he near-on perfected the platforming genre in the space of a year, while also making the very first The Legend of Zelda at the same time. Seems exhausting just thinking about it…\n\n95. Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss (1992)\n\nBlue Sky Productions // PC\n\nIts revolutionary 2.5D visuals might not stand up in the cold light of 2023, but there’s no mistaking The Stygian Abyss’s ongoing impact on role-playing games to this very day. Puzzle-filled dungeons, a peerless physics system, sword combat with fantasy nasties and an oft-infuriating weapon durability system… Sounds an awful lot like another all-timer starring a chap in a blue tunic, doesn’t it?\n\n94. Okami (2006)\n\nClover Studio // PlayStation 2, Wii\n\nTimeless art and a near-perfect Famitsu score didn’t stop Okami from being a flop, taking years to surpass a million copies sold. Nowadays it’s revered for its painterly style and Zelda-like mechanics. Developer Clover Studio shut its doors for good just a few months after release. This is why we can't have nice things.\n\n93. Fable II (2008)\n\nLionhead Studios // Xbox 360\n\nLionhead’s lofty ambition of a choice-driven RPG peaked with Fable II. More dynamic, more heartfelt and more accomplished than the 2004 original, Fable II created one of the most quintessentially British worlds ever playable in a video game with a morality system that lets you run wild with paragon good or devilishly evil deeds. Or just farts. Really wet farts.\n\n92. Mass Effect (2007)\n\nBioware // Xbox 360, PC, PlayStation 3\n\nA game that makes you feel good about punching a journalist while also making you feel bad for fancying a polygonal alien, Mass Effect was BioWare’s big new punt at a not-Star Wars space opera IP about evil squids destroying the universe. It was great – but the series' best moments were yet to come.\n\n91. Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)\n\nRockstar Games // PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC\n\nCousin! Announced when Xbox exec, Peter Moore, revealed the series logo tattooed on his bicep at E3, Grand Theft Auto IV did away with the kitchen sink approach of San Andreas in a then staggering recreation of New York City. You might not be able to base jump off mountains, but this is one of Rockstar’s best, most affecting stories.\n\n90. Super Mario Kart (1992)\n\nNintendo // SNES\n\nThe only Mario Kart game without the Blue Shell is the one that ranks in our Top 100. Coincidence? We think not.\n\n89. Hitman: World of Assassination (2016 - 2021)\n\nIO Interactive // PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n\nFormerly a trilogy of expertly curated stealth games, the World of Assassination series became one package in 2021, with IO Interactive making every level available via Hitman 3. With that, the team consolidated an ultraviolet sandbox of F1 sabotage, industrial wine-pressing catastrophes and death by toilet drowning as a globe-trotting murder sim par excellence.\n\n88. The Last Guardian (2016)\n\nJapan Studio & GenDesign // PlayStation 4\n\nDivisive in a way that many games don’t have the courage to be these days, The Last Guardian saw you make friends with a giant dog-bird creature called Trico that proved to be as hungry as he was impetuous. Those with the patience for director Fumito Ueda’s eccentricities – as well as a nine-year development cycle – would find another unforgettable adventure from the Ico and Shadow of the Colossus creator.\n\n87. Super Mario Odyssey (2017)\n\nNeversoft // PlayStation\n\nThere are entire childhoods with just one core memory: trying to get a 1080 in the halfpipe in the Hangar level for absolutely no reward bar your own sense of accomplishment. Wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\n77. The Secret of Monkey Island (1990)\n\nLucasfilm Games // PC, Mac, Amiga, Atari ST\n\nWorth its spot for the invention of ‘Insult Sword Fighting’ alone…\n\n“Now I know what filth and stupidity really are.”\n\n“I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.”\n\n76. Pokémon Gold and Silver (1999)\n\nGame Freak // Game Boy Color\n\nWidely regarded by the Poké hardcore as the series’ high watermark, Gold and Silver were so assured of themselves that their postgame featured almost the entirety of Pokémon Red and Blue’s Kanto region. This seems even more of a flex in 2023, when many games struggle to ship their first level out of the door in a fully functional state.\n\n75. Metroid Prime (2002)\n\nRetro Studios // GameCube\n\nLike much of the Metroid franchise, Prime’s existence feels like a borderline miracle and its recent Remastered incarnation does nothing to dissuade us of that notion. Created by the Texas-based Retro Studios largely in the space of just two years, it took the series themes of isolation and exploration and transplanted them into what is still Nintendo’s only first-person shooter of note.\n\n74. Undertale (2015)\n\nToby Fox // Mac, PC\n\nCertainly, the only game on this list to have been gifted to the head of the Catholic Church. Undertale was what YouTuber MatPat decided to give to Pope Francis when an internet summit was held at the Vatican in 2016. We can only hope Pope Francis attempted a pacifist run.\n\n73. Final Fantasy VI (1994)\n\nSquare // SNES\n\nThe last of the 2D Final Fantasys occupies a uniquely macabre place in franchise history. Considering its sequel saw one lead character impaled by a giant samurai sword, that is really quite saying something.\n\n72. Yakuza 0 (2015)\n\nNintendo // N64\n\nWhat’s there left to achieve after you’ve made (what was) the undisputed gaming GOAT in Ocarina Of Time? Scar an entire generation with cosmic nightmare fuel, of course.\n\n68. Thief: The Dark Project (1998)\n\nLooking Glass Studios // PC\n\nOne of the rare video games that can be completed without leaving a trail of corporeal destruction in your wake, Thief pioneered the stealth genre as we know it. And so, like a guard who’ll loudly declare their every waking thought to the shadows, we too are duty-bound to proclaim its pioneering excellence to the cold, uncaring void that is the Internet.\n\n67. The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (2002)\n\nNintendo // GameCube\n\nIn fairness to those gamers who lost their tiny minds upon Wind Waker’s 2001 Space World reveal, the spiritual successor to Ocarina Of Time did seem like an almighty gamble. At a moment when Nintendo desperately needed to prove its wares weren’t just for kids, here was its Hero of Time in a playable anime form. The Gamecube might have tanked harder than the Master Sword through Ganondorf’s skull come Link’s final boss fight, but this remains that dinky console’s crowning achievement.\n\n66. Fallout New Vegas (2010)\n\nMaxis // PC\n\nThere’s more to The Sims 2’s considerable legacy than its appeal beyond what was then the gaming’s core demographic of Kalashnikov-loving young men. Given how this sequel doubled down on appealing to players outside such a narrow bubble – The Sims 4 currently claims 60 per cent of its audience is women between the ages of 18 and 24 – we’d be remiss in not celebrating such a pioneering approach in what can still be a depressingly insular industry.\n\n62. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (1997)\n\nKonami // PlayStation, Sega Saturn\n\nAKA the “vania” in the Metroidvania genre that’s defined every major noughties indie hit of note from Hollow Knight to Dead Cells, as well as Hideo Miyazaki’s Souls franchise, Symphony Of The Night deserves better than to be known for all the classics it inspired. If nothing else, it still boasts one of gaming’s most iconic plot twists, while whipping your way through Dracula’s undead hordes remains bloody brilliant fun.\n\n61. Grand Theft Auto III (2001)\n\nRockstar Games // PlayStation 2\n\nRevolutionary for its 3D open world, Grand Theft Auto III had unparalleled freedom for the time. Voice acting, mission design, world-building and a gritty city underbelly atmosphere all combined for a video game that changed everything forever. Rockstar would, somehow, deliver two sequels in the following three years. A feat that’s all the more impressive now that GTA V has gone a decade without a successor – which, excitingly, is about to change.\n\n60. Super Metroid (1994)\n\nNintendo // SNES\n\nArguably the most subversive game in Nintendo’s entire back catalogue and certainly one of its most influential, Super Metroid pits its female action hero against the merciless flora and fauna of an alien planet. Although much of this oppressive vibe is carried over from its NES predecessor, Samus Aran’s third adventure is elevated by the fresh intricacies its 16-bit level design could afford. That and the fact its difficulty was dialled back from “soul-crushingly brutal” this time around.\n\n59. Fallout 3 (2008)\n\nBethesda Game Studios // PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\n\nWould you leave the relative safety of an underground vault to venture out into an irradiated hell on Earth in order to find your lovely dad who is Liam Neeson? Your answer may vary, but one thing is for sure: Bethesda made a mighty fine RPG out of that very question, and the new show based on the series has only solidified the irradiated fun.\n\n58. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006)\n\nBethesda Game Studios // PC, Xbox 360\n\nOblivion’s “step out” moment – when you leave an introductory dungeon and see the game’s vast world – was one of the defining moments of the Xbox 360 era, and practically paved the way for open-world RPGs on console. Plus they managed to get Patrick Stewart to do about nine seconds of voice work – not bad for 2006.\n\n57. Final Fantasy IX (2000)\n\nSquare Enix // PlayStation\n\nFinal Fantasy’s OG PlayStation family saw two high-flying siblings stand either side of a weird emo kid with great hair. FF IX is probably the most straight-laced of the bunch, which is really saying something given one of your party members is a giant frog chef. Nevertheless, it uses that breathing room to tell a classic fantasy story of heroes, a princess and Michelin-starred swamp cuisine.\n\n56. Inside (2016)\n\nPlaydead // Xbox, PC, PlayStation 4\n\nOne of the most bizarre, horrifying and unexpected endings in all of gaming, Inside’s noir aesthetic and lonely atmosphere are in keeping with Playdead’s debut, Limbo, but it ratchets up the mechanical and design craft to make this a clear standout.\n\n55. Hollow Knight (2016)\n\nTeam Cherry // PC, Mac\n\nIt’s still astonishing that a game as expansive, compelling and finessed as Hollow Knight was made by an Adelaide-based team of just three developers. Although its Dark Souls meets Metroidvania influences are immediately apparent, they’re transcended by the sheer detail and TLC that oozes throughout the dilapidated remains of Hallownest and its curious inhabitants. To those who wasted untold hours before slaying its Radiance boss, we salute you.\n\n54. Ico (2001)\n\nJapan Studio, Team Ico // PlayStation 2\n\nMario and Luigi. Nate and Sully. Call of Duty and teabagging. Gaming is full of unforgettable duos, but Ico’s is one of the more iconoclastic. Twisting the boy-meets-princess fairytale in a colder, more austere direction, it remains one of the most daring titles in PlayStation’s frequently crowd-pleasing back catalogue.\n\n53. Dishonored 2 (2016)\n\nArkane // PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox One\n\nA game of almost peerless interconnected craft, Dishonored 2 contains not one but two of the all-time greatest levels: a labyrinthine clockwork mansion, and a brain-bending adventure through time. Arkane’s grasp of complex, enjoyable systemic gameplay mechanics peaked here. Criminally, the game barely made any money, but we’re sure the Number 53 spot on this list is every bit as valuable to publisher Bethesda.\n\n52. Half-Life (1998)\n\nValve // PC\n\nAs anyone who has returned to GoldenEye 007 in recent years will attest, many vintage first-person shooters are best left to the ravages of time. Although Half-Life garnered rapturous acclaim in the late ‘90s for its then cutting-edge graphics and physics engine, it's novelist Marc Laidlaw’s twisting sci-fi narrative and the immersive way it was told without relying on cut-scenes that means Valve’s first classic of many still holds up. That and the fact those headcrabs still haunt our waking dreams.\n\n51. Final Fantasy X (2001)\n\nSquare Enix // PlayStation 2\n\nMuch like Lionel Messi goals and Logan Roy expletives, the Final Fantasy franchise is now storied enough for everyone to have their own favourite. Look past its oft-memed laughing scene, and Final Fantasy X is worthy of its place amongst the RPG series' finest offerings. Not least for its invention of blitzball, one of the greatest (fictional) sports known to both mankind and Spira residents.\n\n50. Spelunky (2008)\n\nMossmouth // PC\n\nAlongside Fez and The Binding Of Isaac, Spelunky led the noughties charge for a new breed of low-budget, big-brained indie games that set an entirely new direction for the art form. By dialling in on a small but perfectly formed idea – find treasure, don’t die – players were hooked in minutes, but would spend hours risking death by impalement, snakebite or an irate shopkeeper amongst many other perilous fates in order to master the fiendish charms of Derek Yu’s creation.\n\n49. Stardew Valley (2016)\n\nConcernedApe // PC\n\nStardew Valley gives you the chance to swap the big smoke for a small town and grow crops, nurture livestock and commit to a relaxed country life. Where games such as Civilization gamified the one more turn aspect to keep players hooked, Stardew Valley convinces your brain to play one more day at a time… Until your wife has taken the kids, but you have some very big cabbages and award-winning wine.\n\n48. Grand Theft Auto V (2013)\n\nGiant Sparrow // PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox One\n\nBy 2017, “esoteric video games that made you feel something” were no longer a preposterous genre. If the likes of Gone Home and Everybody’s Gone To The Rapture helped to carve out a space for the ‘walking sim’, then …Edith Finch didn’t so much tug at our heartstrings as it did wrench them out of our chest with surprising finesse. Bath time has never felt the same again.\n\n38. Hades (2020)\n\nSupergiant Games // Switch, PC, Mac\n\nSupergiant’s colourful, contemporary take on Greek mythology made full use of the early access model to give players the opportunity to play the game before “full release”. It meant Supergiant could improve the game with players as they took note of detailed feedback, mainly for even more lusty character design.\n\n37. Silent Hill 2 (2001)\n\nKonami // PlayStation 2\n\nA horror classic that made a virtue of its technical limitations by fusing an oppressive, ever-present fog and our fear of the unknown to sweaty-palmed effect. After Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro's aborted P.T. attempt to revive the franchise in 2014, a remake is expected later this year.\n\n36. Super Mario Bros 3 (1991)\n\nNintendo // NES\n\nSuch is Nintendo’s dominance during the NES era, it claimed 94 per cent of the North American console market as its own. Aside from printing money by the absolute truckload, that machine’s greatest achievement was Super Mario Bros 3 in which Miyamoto set the platforming bar so high, its star plumber has leapt over it only occasionally in the intervening decades.\n\n35. Portal (2007)\n\nValve // PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\n\nAfter the imperious Half-Life: Alyx and Counter-Strike 2’s promising debut, it seems like Valve is seriously flirting with becoming a video games developer again. So it’s worth remembering that in 2007, the now PC gaming monolith was on such a hot streak it could afford to toss off a puzzle game as inventive as Portal as part of The Orange Box compilation package. Pure genius from start to finish, it proved to be as creative as it was outright hilarious.\n\n34. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009)\n\nNaughty Dog // PlayStation 3\n\nUncharted 2’s mid-game, high-speed train cart set piece rivals the best of the Mission: Impossible movies, and it was all done on a PlayStation 3 in 2009. Nathan Drake’s sophomore outing pushed the envelope for motion capture and rip-roaring action, and is a high bar for the best-selling PlayStation series.\n\n33. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (2004)\n\nKonami // PlayStation 2\n\nLong before Hideo Kojima veered off into post-apocalyptic parcel delivery and Konami decided pachinko machines were the only game in town, the auteur and his longtime publisher were at the peak of their combined powers with Snake Eater. With a newfound emphasis on camouflage and close-quarters combat, this was as close to espionage realism as the PS2 could muster. Just don’t ask us to explain the plot.\n\n32. Deus Ex (2000)\n\nIon Storm // PC\n\nSet in 2052, Deus Ex still feels ahead of its time for both the sheer choice afforded to its players and the unnerving prescience of its conspiratorial plot. Riffs on global pandemics aside, Warren Spector’s iconoclastic creation is even more remarkable for its ongoing influence on the immersive sim genre. Having been sold to the Embracer Group in 2022 as part of $300 million acquisition from Square Enix, a franchise revival seems sure to arrive before its predicted dystopia, if only just.\n\n31. Shadow of the Colossus (2005)\n\nTeam Ico // PlayStation 2\n\nA game where less is truly more, the beauty of Shadow of the Colossus’ painterly, minimalistic environments are outmatched only by the monolithic creatures you track down throughout your quest. Academy Award-winning director, Guillermo del Toro, hailed Team Ico’s game as a “masterpiece” and an influence on his twisted directorial craft.\n\n30. Outer Wilds (2019)\n\nNintendo // N64\n\nEdge magazine’s first-ever 10/10 – one of just 24 in the magazine’s 30-year publication – went to Super Mario 64. Directed by Nintendo’s Mario overseer, Shigeru Miyamoto, this transformative platformer set a dizzying precedent for 3D games while they were still in their infancy. In 2021, a pristine original copy became the most expensive video game ever when it sold at auction for more than $1.5M.\n\n17. Final Fantasy VII (1997)\n\nSquare Enix // PlayStation\n\nFinal Fantasy VII (AKA the one with the samurai sword impalement) was the most expensive game ever made in 1997. It now looks so blocky that eliciting such emotional reactions from players seems like madness. Truly, this marked a massive step forward for RPG storytelling. So much so that Square Enix pumped probably double the dough into a multi-part remake.\n\n16. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011)\n\nBethesda Game Studios // PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\n\nDragons! Skyrim captured both hardcore and casuals with its streamlined role-playing design. Its snowy mountain peaks are an incredible discovery space with 100s of hours of quests and secrets and – like all Bethesda games – thousands of fan-made mods created entire new quests and systems to elongate the game’s life for over a decade.\n\n15. Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)\n\nRockstar Games // PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n\nPerhaps the greatest flex in video game history, Rockstar outdid its own benchmark for cinematic storytelling and attention to detail with Red Dead Redemption 2 - a sombre story about a man running out of time, in which you can also hog-tie innocent victims to train tracks and marvel at lovingly rendered horse testicles. Video games, eh?\n\n14. Super Mario World (1990)\n\nNintendo // SNES\n\nThere are a whole bunch of reasons for Super Mario World’s iconic status. The fact that it launched alongside Nintendo’s SNES console, its joyous abundance of platforming trickery and an effervescent soundtrack that absolutely slaps. Really, we reckon it’s all down to the debut of a charming green dinosaur called Yoshi.\n\n13. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998)\n\nNintendo // N64\n\nHeld aloft as the undisputed GOAT for decades, Ocarina of Time’s crown has slipped a little after 2017’s Breath of the Wild redefined The Legend of Zelda franchise once again. For those who still have the “Song Of Time” written into their muscle memory, no amount of open-world adventuring can supplant this game’s magic.\n\n12. Disco Elysium (2019)\n\nZA/UM // PC\n\nA game where your inner psyche narrates its way through one almighty hangover/murder mystery, Disco Elysium’s non-traditional role-playing mechanics put conversation as the primary interactive element. Just make sure your detective's morale doesn’t drop so low that they literally lose the will to live.\n\n11. Resident Evil 4 (2005)\n\nCapcom // GameCube\n\nResident Evil 4’s grasp of pace, tension, and campaign variety is still near flawless, as its thirst for truly revolting insectoids. Legendary director Shinji Mikami and the team at Capcom popularised the over-the-shoulder view seen in every game after from The Last of Us to Grand Theft Auto. The critical reception to a 2023 remake shows its impact has not waned a jot.\n\n10. Half-Life 2 (2004)\n\nValve // PC\n\nMany of the games on this list would arguably not exist without Half-Life 2, a game that demonstrated what it was possible to do with 3D spaces, playing with physics models to create engaging puzzles and levels. It remains immensely playable to this very day. Now how about that sequel, Valve?\n\n9. Dark Souls (2011)\n\nAlexey Pajitnov // Electronika 60\n\nEffortlessly simple game design. The rights to Tetris have been contested many times, but few can deny the impact of Alexey Pajitnov’s block-buster. As one of just two pre-1990s games in our Greatest 100, it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the most ported game ever made; more than 65 platforms officially.\n\n2. The Last of Us (2013)\n\nNaughty Dog // PlayStation 3\n\nA dad game for the ages, Naughty Dog’s punt at a Cormac McCarthy-inspired post-apocalyptic travelogue was one of the riskiest moves in PlayStation history. With 32 million copies sold in the franchise so far and season two of a critically acclaimed HBO TV show already in the works, it's safe to say Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley's almighty gamble paid off.\n\n1. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)\n\nNintendo // Switch\n\nNintendo’s magnificent Switch launch game changed how many saw open-world experiences. Vast in size, deeply systemic, with a completely freeform approach to exploration, combat and puzzles. Few games match its scope for experimental play opportunities, and few give the player so much sense of authority over their own discoveries. Its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, has one hell of a legacy to live up to.\n\nMeet the voters…\n\nThanks to everyone who submitted personal lists.
