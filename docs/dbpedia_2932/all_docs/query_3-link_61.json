        "text": "The Lord of the Rings franchise is making a comeback over a decade after Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series became two of the highest-grossing trilogies of all time.\n\nAmazon renewed interest in the franchise with its Middle-earth-inspired Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power TV show. Now, the franchise will return to the big screen with The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nWhile waiting for the highly anticipated movies to arrive, check out our guide for 10 other high fantasy and fellowship movies like The Lord of the Rings you stream online right now on platforms like Disney+, Paramount+, Hulu, and more!\n\nArmy of Darkness\n\nViewers who love the battle scenes and chilling monsters in the Lord of the Rings trilogy will enjoy Army of Darkness. Army of Darkness is the third installment in the Evil Dead franchise, in which Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported to medieval times. Although it’s a horror comedy, it boasts surprising similarities to Lord of the Rings, with Ash establishing a fellowship, the presence of a Gandalf-like wizard, and an epic castle battle scene reminiscent of Helm’s Deep.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\n\nSimilar to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves follows an unlikely band of adventurers who embark on an epic quest. The group, led by the charming thief Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine), is as lovable as any band of Hobbits or Dwarves, while the film effectively builds a fantasy world filled with elves and wizards. It’s a great film for anyone looking for a more light-hearted alternative to Lord of the Rings.\n\nEragon\n\nEragon is a fantasy movie that follows a farm boy, Eragon (Ed Speelers), who sets off on an adventure after discovering a coveted dragon egg. From the fictional fantasy world to the evil ruler to the unsuspecting central hero, Eragon echoes the main plot points of the Lord of the Rings. Its dragon-centered premise will also appeal to fans of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, although fans of the Eragon book may be disappointed by its divergence from the source material.\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story isn’t a fantasy movie but includes a sophisticated fictional universe and a group of heroes on a daring adventure. It’s a standalone Star Wars movie that tells the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who joins forces with resistance fighters to foil the Death Star plans. The group’s perilous journey to the realm of evil strongly parallels the Lord of the Rings fellowship’s trip to Mordor.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of few works to introduce a fictional world nearly as sophisticated as Tolkien’s Middle-earth. Both Tolkien and C. S. Lewis have been described as the “Fathers of Modern Fantasy,” so it’s not surprising the film adaptations of their work share similarities, including the ability to wholly transport viewers into a new realm with its own history, mythology, and forces of good and evil.\n\nThe Green Knight\n\nThe Green Knight is an epic medieval fantasy movie that follows Sir Gaiwan (Dev Patel) as he struggles with whether to accept the consequences of his battle with the Green Knight (Ralph Ineson). It will appeal to viewers who love the gorgeous cinematography, soundtrack, and honorable warriors in Lord of the Rings. Also, the film has a unique connection to Lord of the Rings, as it’s inspired by the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which Tolkien translated to English with E. V. Gordon.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nIf you’re looking for a kid-friendly alternative to The Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz is the film for you. The 1939 musical fantasy follows Dorothy (Judy Garland), a young woman from Kansas who is transported to the magical land of Oz, where she seeks help from a great wizard to return home. While it’s a light-hearted musical with flying monkeys and witches, it’s also a great introduction to fantasy with a simplified Lord of the Rings-esque story of a group of travelers in a magical land.\n\nTolkien\n\nTolkien isn’t a fantasy story, but the biopic will appeal to most Lord of the Rings fans. The film examines Tolkien's (Nicholas Hoult) early life, including how he came to love language and drew inspiration from his experiences in World War I for his trilogy. Viewers interested in The Lord of the Rings’ themes and parallels to real life will enjoy Tolkien.\n\nWarcraft\n\nViewers who loved the epic war scenes in The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies will be especially intrigued by Warcraft. The fantasy movie is based on the video game series of the same name and sees a war break out between humans and orcs when dark magic causes their worlds to collide. It’s an epic war movie filled with fantastical creatures, dark magic, and realms reminiscent of the world of Lord of the Rings.\n\nWillow\n\nWillow is a dark fantasy film with many similarities to The Lord of the Rings' tale of good vs. evil, although instead of a ring, the key to an evil ruler’s reign is a baby. Since it was released in 1988, many Lord of the Rings fans grew up watching Willow. The two films capitalize on a high fantasy premise, feature many archetypes in the fantasy genre, and both feature groundbreaking visual effects and costumes for the time, giving them a similar vibe.\n\nWhere to watch movies like The Lord of the Rings online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream these 10 movies like The Lord of the Rings in the United States!\n\nJames Bond is one of the longest-running film franchises of all time. Based on Ian Fleming’s book series of the same name, the franchise has produced 27 movies with seven different iterations of Bond at the time of writing. Since Daniel Craig retired from the role following No Time to Die, the film series has been on hiatus while the search for the next Bond continues.\n\nWhile you wait for the next era of Bond, check out our guide for 10 great movies similar to the James Bond series you can stream online today on platforms like Apple TV+, Peacock, and more!\n\nArgo\n\nThe James Bond movies and Argo feature a spy leading a high-stakes covert mission, but the main difference is that Argo is based on actual events. It tells the stranger-than-fiction true story of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), a CIA exfiltration specialist, who used the cover of a fake film production to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran. In addition to featuring a highly intelligent and pragmatic spy and a high-stakes mission, Argo’s incredible story and performances earned it several Oscars.\n\nArgylle\n\nViewers who love the campier early Bond films like Diamonds are Forever will enjoy the lighthearted spy comedy Argylle. The movie sees the novelist Ellie Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) pulled into an international spy scheme when her books seemingly start to predict real-life events. It’s a wild and off-kilter story, but Henry Cavill’s Bond-like Argylle and the underlying romance make it an enjoyable spy movie.\n\nAtomic Blonde\n\nAtomic Blonde’s Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is often considered a female Bond, given that both are mysterious, elite spies working for MI6. Theron effectively makes the character her own, though, in an adrenaline-pumping plot set before the collapse of the Berlin Wall. With a woman who gives Bond a run for his money as the most elite spy, John Wick-esque action scenes, and unpredictable plot twists, Atomic Blonde is even better than what most imagined a female 007 movie would look like.\n\nGhosted\n\nGhosted is another more playful alternative to the James Bond movies. The film follows Sadie Rhodes (Ana de Armas), a secret agent who unintentionally pulls her needy and clueless boyfriend, Cole Turner (Chris Evans), into one of her missions. Although it’s largely a hilarious, action-packed rom-com, it does borrow a few pages from Bond with major story twists and over-the-top villains.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service\n\nViewers who love Bond's dapper and gentlemanly charm will be interested in Kingsman: The Secret Service, which features a whole organization of gentlemen spies. Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is recruited into the secret service his father secretly worked for and quickly takes on a global threat in a stylish but brutal fashion. Kingsman: The Secret Service boasts more violence and humor than the typical Bond movie but capitalizes on its agents’ gentlemanly flair.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout\n\nAll of the Mission Impossible movies are great for fans of Bond, with many considering Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) the closest thing to the American equivalent of Bond. Meanwhile, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is often considered the best movie in the franchise with its fast pace, high-quality action sequences, and intriguing plot of Hunt’s race against time to stop a nuclear terrorist attack.\n\nMunich\n\nMunich is a high-stakes spy drama based on historical events. It follows Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent tasked with assembling a team to assassinate the terrorists who carried out an attack on the Israeli Olympic team at the 1972 Olympics. The movie is a high-quality, nuanced spy thriller that will appeal to viewers looking for a more realistic depiction of the world of espionage than Bond.\n\nThe Bourne Identity\n\nLike Mission Impossible, the whole Jason Bourne franchise will appeal to Bond fans. The Bourne Identity tells the important origin story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a man suffering from amnesia who is skilled in combat and has mysterious ties to the CIA. It’s a great movie for fans seeking a more action-packed, mysterious alternative to James Bond.\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a spy thriller that follows CIA agent Napoleon Soto (Henry Cavill) and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who are forced to team up and foil a criminal organization’s plot to spark a nuclear war between the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War. It’s a stylish and charming spy movie, which will be a real treat to Bond fans who have long wished to see Cavill as an iteration of Bond.\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a spy thriller that tells the true story of Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s off-the-books black ops team who secretly played a vital role in World War II by disrupting the German U-boat supply. In addition to offering viewers an intricate spy story and non-stop action, the film also features Bond author Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), as Fleming’s role within Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during WWII partially inspired his Bond novels.\n\nWhere to watch movies like James Bond online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream these 10 movies like James Bond in the United States!\n\nAiring from 2007-2012, Gossip Girl was one of the hottest teen dramas of the late 2000s. The show centered around a privileged group of teens in Manhattan’s Upper East Side who attend one of the city’s most affluent schools. Through their privilege, they live sordid, drama-fueled lives… and someone seems to know all about it and is publishing it all on a blog for the world to read.

With the release of Alien: Romulus, the upcoming Alien: Rogue Incursion video game, and the upcoming Alien: Earth TV series on FX… the franchise is arguably hotter than ever.\n\nIf you can’t wait for the next installment to be released, check out our guide below to discover other great movies like Alien that you can stream right now using platforms like Netflix, Disney+, Max, Prime Video and more!\n\nPredator\n\nNo, Alien and Predator were not made by the same people nor were they originally in the same cinematic universe. But the two franchises just blend together perfectly. So perfect in fact that they’ve even created an entire Alien vs. Predator franchise. If you love the Alien movies, trust me, you need to watch Predator. It’s an absolute must.\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nAlien’s famous tagline was “In space no one can hear you scream,” and the movie was lauded for creating great tension by utilizing the depths of space to make the crew of the Nostromo completely stranded and helpless. Event Horizon utilizes a similar setting, this time on a spaceship that’s literally been to hell and back…and it’s brought a few stragglers back with it.\n\nThe Thing\n\nOne of the best (and scariest) parts about Alien is the horrifying xenomorph. If you want some more terrifying (and totally gross) morphing alien carnage, you need to watch John Carpenter’s classic The Thing. In the movie, a group is stranded in an Antarctic base, but they discover they’re not alone. A parasitic alien is able to infect hosts and take their shape, or turn them into monstrous creatures. The Thing is 100% body horror, and will definitely make your skin crawl.\n\nThe Fourth Kind\n\nSet in Alaska, The Fourth Kind presents a first-contact movie where Milla Jovovich is victimized by extraterrestrial forces. The movie had a brilliant marketing campaign that purported the story to be true, even fabricating news articles online and claiming that the very real Chapman University had conducted the studies. For a totally unique take on an alien movie, you gotta watch The Fourth Kind.\n\nDead Space: Downfall\n\nBased on the popular video game series (which is partly inspired by Event Horizon which is also on this list), Dead Space: Downfall centers around a space crew that discovers a mysterious artifact on an alien planet. After bringing it aboard their ship, something evil comes with it and begins killing everyone. Yeah, it’s a lot like Alien and that’s exactly why you’re gonna love it. There was also a follow-up with Dead Space: Aftermath.\n\nNOPE\n\nOne of the more modern alien films is Jordan Peele’s NOPE. The movie has lots of undertones, like society’s obsession with filming everything and our determination to domesticate wild animals – but it’s also a terrifying alien movie about a giant flying creature that becomes territorial and feeds on humans. Yikes.\n\nSunshine\n\nLong before Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh became Oscar winners, they starred in Danny Boyle’s Sunshine. The movie focuses on a space expedition to the sun, where a group of astronauts need to deploy a bomb to reignite the dying star and save Earth. But someone (or something) begins killing off the crew one by one before they can complete their mission… but why? Sunshine was a sleeper hit that’s since become a cult classic thanks to its visceral setting and great story.\n\nUnderwater\n\nUnderwater is kind of like “Alien in the ocean”. In the movie, a team of aquanauts encounter Lovecraftian monsters at the bottom of the sea and they’re forced to fight for their survival. If you love the terror of deep space, you’ll also be terrified by the blackness and bleakness of the ocean’s depths.\n\nLeviathan\n\nBlending Underwater and The Thing together is 1989’s Leviathan. Complete with chest-bursting and all, the movie truly does feel like an underwater version of Alien. Plus, the movie used practical effects instead of CGI, so any practical effects fans will definitely love this undiscovered gem. That same year an almost identical film was released called DeepStar Six that Alien fans will also love.\n\nLife\n\nSet in the near future, Life centers around a crew of astronauts who discover the first proof of extraterrestrial life. Like all good alien movies, the creature is xenomorphic and parasitic, quickly utilizing the astronauts as a food source. The film also starred some surprisingly big names like Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nWhere Can I Watch Movies Like Alien Online?\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where all these movies like Alien are streaming right now!\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, the Alien franchise is returning to the big screen with Alien: Romulus. Before delving into the next installment, viewers may wish to catch up with the prior films in the horror sci-fi franchise. This guide will explain how to watch the Alien movies in order and where you can stream all the movies online!\n\nThe Alien franchise began in 1979 with the release of Alien from director Ridley Scott. It follows the crew of the spacecraft Nostromo, including warrant officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), and executive officer Kane (John Hurt), who are on their way home from a mission in deep space. However, they soon find themselves fighting for survival when an alien species (later identified as Xenomorphs) infiltrates their ship.\n\nAlthough Alien received mixed reviews upon release, it was reassessed and is now considered one of the greatest sci-fi horror movies ever. The blend of horror and sci-fi, the strong female lead in Sigourney Weaver, and the chilling and dreadful premise were groundbreaking. Additionally, the scene where the alien emerges through Kane’s chest is considered one of cinematic history's most iconic scenes.\n\nSigourney Weaver returned for the 1986 sequel, Aliens, with James Cameron signing on to direct. The film sees Ripley return to the original site of the attack on Nostromo after another ship goes dark while in the area. Aliens did what few sequels accomplish and came to be considered equal to or greater than Alien in quality, thrilling viewers with its exploration of a Queen Xenomorph and further character development of Ripley.\n\nWeaver returned for Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection, but the franchise started losing momentum. Alien 3 was criticized for undoing the Aliens' ending, while Alien Resurrection had a convoluted script. Hence, the next Alien film would diverge from the original movies and start a new crossover franchise with Predator.\n\nOriginal Alien director Ridley Scott was vehemently against the crossover and eventually received the green light to revive the franchise with two prequel films, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. The prequel introduced archeologists Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) and android David (Michael Fassbender), who run into a deadly alien species while attempting to track the origin of humanity.\n\nWhile the prequels didn’t entirely eclipse the original movie and its sequel, they received relatively positive reviews. They revitalized the franchise, raising excitement for Alien: Romulus, which will take viewers back to the time of the original films.\n\nHow to watch the Alien movies in order\n\nViewers can either watch the Alien movies in chronological or release date order. Chronological order is fairly simple, as it is the Predator vs. Alien movies, followed by the prequels and original series. The new film, Alien: Romulus, is set to take place between Alien and Aliens. The chronological order is:\n\nAVP: Alien vs. Predator\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem\n\nPrometheus\n\nAlien: Covenant\n\nAlien\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nAliens\n\nAlien 3\n\nAlien Resurrection\n\nWhere to watch the Alien movies online\n\nSee below for the release date order, as well as where to watch the Alien movies online in the United States!\n\nThe release of Netflix’s live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender has renewed interest in the critically acclaimed series.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender set itself apart from other TV shows with its meticulous world-building and tackling of mature topics through a kid-friendly animated series about a group of elemental benders. Although few shows can parallel the groundbreaking nature of the original series, there are other projects that come close to echoing the show's world-building, spirit, and fantasy elements.\n\nCheck out our guide for 10 more great TV shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender that you can stream online right now on platforms like Netflix, Disney+, and more!\n\nAvatar: The Legend of Korra\n\nYou can’t get much closer to Avatar: The Last Airbender than its spinoff series, Avatar: The Legend of Korra. The spinoff takes place 70 years after the original series, where a new Avatar, Korra (Janet Varney), has taken Aang’s place. It delves deeper into more obscure bending powers, such as metal bending and blood bending, and continues its sophisticated worldbuilding by examining a world steeped in political unrest.\n\nBlack Clover\n\nBlack Clover is a strong choice for viewers looking for a more expansive array of elemental powers than the four basic elements in Avatar: The Last Airbender. The anime series takes place in a complex fantasy world where most individuals boast some kind of power, such as wind magic, gravity magic, spatial magic, and many more. It’s a strong anime series that offers viewers a unique look into a society built on magic.\n\nFairy Tail\n\nFairy Tail is another series that offers a more expansive delve into a fantasy world filled with magic. The anime explores seven different types of elemental magic and how a magical world maintains order and peace through numerous wizard guilds. It’s perfect for viewers seeking a more comedic and lighthearted alternative to Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nKipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts\n\nLike Avatar: The Last Airbender, Kipo and the Age of Wondereasts is one of those rare series that appeals to all ages and probes surprisingly mature themes about race and class. It follows Kipo Oak (Karen Fukuhara), a young girl navigating a post-apocalyptic world where humans live underground due to tense relations with the surface-dwelling mutants. The show excels at world-building and has received critical acclaim for its diversity and LGBTQ+ representation.\n\nNaruto\n\nNaruto explores elemental powers like Avatar: The Last Airbender but includes a unique ninja twist. In Naruto, many individuals have a natural affinity for the five Chakra natures: fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. Viewers will find a protagonist similar to Aang in Naruto Uzumaki, as he boasts the rarest Wind Release powers and strives to become a great leader in his village.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians' exploration of the offspring of Greek gods means there is plenty of exploration of children with the power to manipulate elements like water, lightning, or plants. However, the show is most like Avatar: The Last Airbender in its story of a boy burdened with prophecies that he will save the world but who finds support and lifelong friendships on his journey.\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power is a reboot of the 1985 series She-Ra: Princess of Power. It follows She-Ra (Aimee Carrero), a young girl who joins the Rebellion to stop the evil tyrant Hordak (Keston John) from conquering the world. Like Avatar: The Last Airbender, it’s notable for its diversity and for tackling mature themes about corruption and imperialism.\n\nThe Dragon Prince\n\nThe Dragon Prince is created by Aaron Ehasz and Justin Richmond, who both worked as executive producers on Avatar: The Last Airbender. The show follows three children whose protection of the titular Dragon Prince is vital to restoring peace to the world. Its beautiful animation and deep dive into a world at war and steeped in magic derived from nature make it feel like a spiritual successor to Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nThe Owl House\n\nThe Owl House follows Luz Noceda (Sarah-Nicole Robles), a teenage girl whose life changes when she stumbles into the Demon Realm and begins pursuing her dream of becoming a witch. It has received high critical acclaim for its outstanding LGBTQ+ representation. In addition to its diversity, it boasts the same carefully crafted critique of colonialism as Avatar: The Last Airbender as well as the “found family” aspect.\n\nXiaolin Showdown\n\nSimilar to Avatar: The Last Airbender, Xiaolin Showdown is heavily influenced by Asian culture and examines a world filled with magic and martial arts. The show follows four young monks, Omi (Tara Strong), Kimiko (Grey DeLisle), Raimundo (Tom Kenny), and Clay (Jeff Bennett), as they search the globe for magical artifacts that will help maintain balance in the world. Xiaolin Showdown will especially appeal to viewers who enjoyed the epic fight scenes in Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nWhere to watch shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where these 10 TV shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender are streaming in the United States!\n\nA unique Alien race, gorgeous planets, underlying messages about real-world problems, and fighting for good – these all helped make Avatar and its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water not just successful movies, but two of the highest-grossing movies of all time. In fact, Avatar is the highest-grossing movie ever, with The Way of Water taking the #3 spot at the time of writing.\n\nIf you loved the Avatar movies and are looking for other films with a similar vibe and style, check out our guide below to find out where you can stream the best movies like Avatar online right now!\n\nPocahontas\n\nIn a nutshell, the first Avatar movie is basically Disney’s Pocahontas on a different planet – A group of settlers arrive in a new world and cautiously befriend the natives…all while secretly plotting to take their land and resources. There’s a reason Avatar was often called “Pocahontas in space”. But with great music, stunning colors, and a real message about humanity, Disney’s Pocahontas is a great movie, so Avatar should wear that title as a badge of honor.\n\nThe Time Machine\n\nIn The Time Machine, an inventor goes so far forward in time that he watches society crumble and later rebuild, with a new race of forest-dwelling humans called Eloi now inhabiting the Earth’s surface. Fans will definitely notice a similar visual style and vibe between the Eloi and the Na’vi from Avatar.\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire\n\nOne of the closest movies to Avatar is Disney’s Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Set in the 1910s with an awesome steampunk and Jules Verne aesthetic, the movie follows an expedition under the sea to uncover the lost city of Atlantis. Once there, they meet the Atlantians who harness an incredible power thanks to their symbiotic relationship with their environment. As always…the visitors then become invaders when it’s revealed they actually came for resources and treasures.\n\nDistrict 9\n\nOne of the themes Avatar touches on is the way that humans don’t value the Na’vi or their land because they’re perceived as the “other” and thus not worthy of any rights. Taking this idea to the extreme was District 9, where an alien race is held captive in South African internment camps. The movie was heavily inspired by the apartheid and if you loved Avatar’s underlying messages, you will appreciate the way District 9 comments on race, colonialism, and the abuse of civil liberties.\n\nStar Wars: Return of the Jedi\n\nIn Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, the Empire has invaded the remote moon of Endor to build a shield generator – taking over the Ewoks’ home planet and destroying the environment in the process. Luckily, the Rebellion teams up with the Ewoks to reclaim their planet and save the galaxy. Just like the Na’vi must save their planet from humans, viewers will find lots of similarities in the Battle of Endor.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nAt its core, Avatar is a first-contact film, where humans work to navigate their encounter with the Na’vi. For one of the most iconic first-contact movies ever, you need to watch Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The movie is suspenseful, but compelling, and even kind of scary because for much of the film, the audience is left unaware of the aliens’ intentions. There’s a reason it was nominated for 9 Oscars.\n\nFernGully: The Last Rainforest\n\nIn FernGully, a group of fairies and woodland creatures are suddenly disturbed by loggers who have come to chop down the rainforest. You can probably already see how this is similar to Avatar, and being an animated movie, it’s also loaded with lush colors and a great larger-than-life rainforest setting, making it feel even more similar to James Cameron’s epic films.\n\nThe Fountain\n\nJust as humans arrive on Pandora in search of “unobtanium” in Avatar, The Fountain tells of humanity’s search for The Tree of Life, echoing the way Europeans used to believe the Fountain of Youth was hidden somewhere in the Americas. Like the humans in Avatar, who are desperate for power and resources, The Fountain tells of the search for something even greater: Immortality.\n\nTarzan\n\nIn a lot of ways, Tarzan is kind of like the Na’vi in Avatar. He’s grown up living with nature, utilizing it as his home, instead of just as a place that can be mined and logged. When he finally makes human contact, many of the same scenarios in Avatar happen, and the movie ultimately asks who is the true savage – the person living with nature, or the people who wish to destroy it.\n\nStrange World\n\nIf you loved Avatar for its stunning colors and exotic planetary landscape, you’ll love Strange World. Heavily inspired by Journey to the Center of the Earth, the movie follows a family who must search for a new energy source… but in the process, they learn about the fragile balance that holds the environment in equilibrium. It’s a great and colorful adventure that has sadly and unfairly been overlooked.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Avatar online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where all these movies like Avatar are streaming online in the United States!\n\nDo you love the Transformers franchise and are looking for movies with similar vibes? Or maybe you’re just looking for more films with some giant robot action? Well, you’re in luck because we’ve got some movies that are perfect for Transformers fans, and they’re all available to stream and rent online.\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where you can watch movies like Transformers streaming online right now using platforms like Netflix, Paramount+ and more!\n\nPacific Rim\n\nIf you love Transformers for its giant robots, you’ll love Pacific Rim. In the movie, giant monsters (kaijus) rise up from the ocean and begin destroying the world. To fight back, humans build giant 10-story battle mechs known as Jaegers. Come for the giant mechs and stay for the epic action.\n\nPower Rangers\n\nIt’s morphin’ time! In the 2017 reboot of Power Rangers, the gang has to once again defeat the evil Rita Repulsa (this time played by Elizabeth Banks). Obviously, it wouldn’t be Power Rangers without a bit of morphin’ – and just like classic series, the Rangers combine their zords to create Megazord. It’s totally cheesy, but also super nostalgic, making it tons of fun.\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nOne of the most iconic scenes in Star Wars history (hell, in cinematic history as a whole) is the epic battle of Hoth. And what’s the main reason the scene is so damn cool and iconic? The AT-AT Imperial Walkers. The giant, hulking robotic war tanks that look like some kind of iron-plated mastodon are easily one of the coolest parts of the entire Star Wars universe. You can also check out Return of the Jedi for the Battle of Endor which features the smaller, bipedal “Chicken Walker” AT-STs.\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong\n\nIf you love the giant robot battles in Transformers, you’ll probably love the entire MonsterVerse franchise thanks to its giant monster madness. But if you want a robotic addition to the franchise, check out Godzilla vs. Kong, which reintroduced audiences to Mechagodzilla – a giant robotic kaiju designed to kill the others and reign supreme.\n\nCube\n\nOne of the coolest parts of Transformers is obviously the transforming. For a film that’s radically different, but with a cool transforming plotline, check out Cube. In the movie, a group of strangers wakes up trapped inside a giant mechanical cube that’s made of smaller ever-shifting cubes. As the cube constantly transforms its layout, the group must fight to escape.\n\nA-X-L\n\nA big part of Transformers is the bond that forms between the Autobots and the humans, especially in the original three films and the prequel Bumblebee. For a similar vibe, check out A-X-L, where a young guy finds a military-created robotic dog designed to be the ultimate weapon. But as the two become friends, they realize that A-X-L doesn’t need to be a killing machine and could be a useful resource and friend to the right owner.\n\nAtlas\n\nA perfect fit for fans of Transformers or Titinfall, Netflix’s Atlas sees J-Lo piloting a giant mech across an alien planet to save humanity. If you’re looking for a movie full of giant robot shenanigans (and a whole lotta’ Jenny from the Block), Atlas is a must-watch.\n\nReal Steel\n\nIf you watch Transformers to see robots fight each other, then you’ll love Real Steel… a movie starring Hugh Jackman that’s literally about boxing robots. The film currently has two potential continuations, with a planned sequel and an upcoming television series in the early stages of development. So fans can expect a lot more robot punches to come.\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\n\n2008’s The Day the Earth Stood Still is an adaptation of the 1951 film of the same name that was an adaptation of the 1940 short story, Farewell to the Master. In the movie, aliens come to Earth and are protected by a giant mechanical defender known as Gort (Genetically Organized Robotic Technology). Since it’s a classic sci-fi tale, all genre fans should watch the movie at least once.\n\nUltraman: Rising\n\nThe classic Ultraman series got a fun twist with Ultraman: Rising. In the movie, Ken can morph into the towering and iconic Ultraman… but this time he’s tasked with raising a baby kaiju. It’s a fun, lighthearted, and family-friendly monster movie that everyone will love.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Transformers online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where all these movies like Transformers are streaming online in the United States!\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is one of the most successful film franchises of all time, and with a sixth installment on the way, viewers may be interested in additional movies that take them to the sea.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean series follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on their daring nautical adventures, which have featured additional characters like Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).\n\nIf you loved the energetic, swashbuckling premise of Pirates of the Caribbean and its unique characters, here are 10 more great movies about pirates and sea adventures that you can stream today on platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and more!\n\nA Hijacking\n\nA Hijacking has a more serious tone than Pirates of the Caribbean and is set in the present day instead of the Golden Age of Piracy. However, it's an intense action movie for those interested in modern-day piracy, following a Danish merchant ship taken hostage by pirates. The film is both a pirate action movie and an adrenaline-pumping hostage story set against the beautiful backdrop of the ocean.\n\nCaptain Blood\n\nCaptain Blood premiered in 1935 and was one of several films that helped revive the swashbuckler genre. The film follows Peter Blood (Errol Flynn), a doctor imprisoned for completing his medical duties, who escapes and begins a new life of high-seas piracy. It boasts the same spirit and energy as Pirates of the Caribbean and is a must-see swashbuckling classic.\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nTom Hanks portrays the titular character in Captain Phillips, who is tasked with keeping his crew safe when his merchant ship is taken hostage by Somali pirates. The film earned high critical acclaim for its powerful and highly suspenseful tale based on a true story. It has a far more serious and mature tone than Pirates of the Caribbean but is the closest one can get to learning the exhilarating true story of modern-day pirates.\n\nHook\n\nHook is both a pirate adventure and a unique take on the classic tale of Peter Pan. In the movie, an adult Pan (Robin Williams) is forced to return to Neverland to save his kidnapped children from the pirate Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman). With a pirate as iconic as Jack Sparrow and a swashbuckling tale with a fairy twist, Hook is a solid alternative to Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea\n\nLike Pirates of the Caribbean, In the Heart of the Sea is a riveting nautical adventure focusing heavily on sea creatures. Based on the event that inspired Moby Dick, the film follows the Essex, a whaling ship helmed by Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth), as it's pursued by a vengeful whale. In the Heart of the Sea is perfect for viewers who especially loved the heart-stopping sea monster attacks in Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nJungle Cruise\n\nJungle Cruise isn’t a pirate or sea story, but it gives Pirates of the Caribbean a run for its money as the most swashbuckling tale in modern Hollywood. The film follows Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) and Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) as they journey down the Amazon in search of the Tree of Life. Similar to Pirates of the Caribbean, it boasts a larger-than-life adventure paralleled by few in energy and spirit.\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\nFor viewers who want a more accurate and detailed depiction of sailing than the Pirates of the Caribbean, Master and Commander is the way to go. The movie follows Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) of the Royal Navy, who is tasked with capturing a French vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. It’s a suspenseful sea adventure that also packs in quite a lot of history and insight into sailing.\n\nPeter Pan & Wendy\n\nLike Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pan and Wendy offers the perfect mixture of piracy and fantasy. It’s a mesmerizing reimagining of the tale of Peter Pan, and Jude Law shines as Captain Hook. With imagination, heart, and adventure, it’s a more kid-friendly alternative to Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Goonies\n\nThe Goonies is a pirate adventure from the imaginative and innocent perspective of children. When a group of young friends find a map leading to a buried pirate treasure, they embark on an adventure that soon brings them aboard a real pirate ship. It’s a kid-friendly version of Pirates of the Caribbean that centers more on heart and spirit than pirate references.\n\nThe Sea Hawk\n\nThe Sea Hawk is a must-see for Pirates of the Caribbean fans, as it's considered one of the greatest maritime adventure movies in cinematic history. The movie follows privateer George Thorpe (Errol Flynn), who serves his country by looting Spanish ships.

Given its enduring legacy, movies and TV shows about the Roman Empire and ancient Rome have fascinated viewers for decades. Hence, Ridley Scott’s upcoming Gladiator II and the new epic Those About to Die series have sparked much excitement.\n\nIf Those About to Die leaves you seeking more of Ancient Rome before Gladiator II, this guide will reveal the 30 best movies and TV shows on the Roman Empire you can stream right now on platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, and more!\n\nOne of the movies that most frequently comes to mind regarding the Roman Empire is the original Gladiator. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film follows Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe), a man who becomes a skilled gladiator on his mission of vengeance. Gladiator delves deep into one of the most intriguing aspects of ancient Rome while capturing the galore of the Roman Empire through breathtaking cinematography, leading it to critical acclaim.\n\nSome of the best movies on the Roman Empire are much older than Gladiator, though, such as Ben-Hur (1959), Quo Vadis, and Spartacus (1960). Both religious epics Ben-Hur and Quo Vadis were released in the 1950s, making their enormous scale and innovative filmmaking techniques all the more impressive. Ben-Hur boasts one of the most iconic film sequences of all time with its chariot race, while Quo Vadis delves into the infamous reign of Nero. Meanwhile, Stanley Kubrick’s critically acclaimed Spartacus delves into the slave revolts that comprise the Servile Wars. Viewers may also enjoy The Fall of the Roman Empire, which many consider the 1964 version of Gladiator.\n\nSince Egypt was once a province of the Roman Empire, unique films like Cleopatra (1963) and Agora blend Egyptian and Roman history. A few filmmakers have gotten even more creative with Ancient Rome by tackling history through comedies like A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum and Monty Python's Life of Brian. Life of Brian is considered one of the greatest comedies of all time, as it explores a young man born in Ancient Rome who is mistaken to be the Messiah.\n\nViewers looking for a more expansive exploration of Ancient Rome may prefer TV shows to film epics. The Spartacus TV show offers a more detailed look into the slave revolts against Rome, while docuseries like Roman Empire provide a more accurate deep dive into figures like Commodus and Julius Caesar. Rome is one of the most large-scale TV shows to delve into Rome’s transition from a Republic to an Empire, and Barbarians is a strong choice for those looking for a bloody historical series.\n\nWhere to watch movies and TV shows about the Roman Empire online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to watch 30 of the best movies and TV shows about the Roman Empire!\n\nWith the release of Twisters, disaster movies are back in the spotlight, and why shouldn’t they be? Nothing says summer blockbuster quite like a giant disaster bringing out the hero in us all as we venture through seemingly unbeatable challenges and have wild adventures.\n\nIf you loved the new Twisters movie, here are 10 other films you’re sure to love. Best of all, they’re all streaming right now. Check out our guide below to discover 10 movies like Twisters and where to watch them!\n\nTwister\n\nIf you loved Twisters, you’ll obviously love the film that started it all, Twister. The movie follows dueling storm-chasing teams and centers around one very unlucky region of Oklahoma that is walloped by numerous tornadoes (including a massive F5) in the span of a few days. It also gave birth to the hilariously famous flying cow.\n\nThe Impossible\n\nSometimes fact is stranger than fiction, and no amount of drama and action from Twisters can compare to 2012’s The Impossible. The film centers around a real family who were vacationing at an oceanfront resort in Thailand when the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami occurred. The family got separated and was forced to fight for their lives in one of the worst natural disasters in history. Naomi Watts even received an Oscar nomination for her role in the movie.\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure\n\nIn The Poseidon Adventure, a tsunami causes a massive wave to crash into an ocean liner, tipping it upside down. As the ship slowly begins to sink, the passengers and crew inside are forced to race to the bowels of the ship (which are now above water) to escape. The Poseidon Adventure was a massive hit, scoring 9 Oscar nominations in 1973.\n\nSkyscraper\n\nHong Kong’s newest skyscraper is the tallest building in the world, standing 240 stories tall. Unfortunately, criminals are targeting the building and have set the 96th floor on fire, trapping everyone on the floors above in a towering inferno. Skyscraper starred The Rock and is certainly on the more wild and bombastic side, but sometimes that type of movie is exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow\n\n2004’s The Day After Tomorrow not only revived the disaster movie genre, but it was also one of the first mainstream movies to put climate change in the spotlight and show viewers the potential consequences of our actions. Though not scientifically accurate, the movie depicts what happens after climate change tips the scales and thrusts Earth into another Ice Age.\n\nVolcano\n\nIn Volcano, Los Angeles’ very real LaBrea Tar Pits are revealed to not be tar pits at all… but instead are the seepings of a previously undiscovered underground volcano. Sadly for the City of Angels, that volcano decides to finally erupt and destroy the metropolis. The premise is wild and silly, but it’s tons of fun. How could you not love a movie about a giant volcano suddenly bursting beneath America’s second-largest city?\n\nGeostorm\n\nCan’t decide which natural disaster you’re craving? Then check out Geostorm, which has them all! In the movie, a weather-controlling satellite is cyber-attacked, causing massive storms to destroy cities across the globe. From hail to lightning, tornadoes, squalls, tsunamis, and more, the entire planet must survive a variety of storms, each deadlier than the last.\n\nSharknado\n\nIf you’re craving more movies about tornadoes, why not check out Sharknado? In the movie, a hurricane and a series of tornadoes (totally unrealistic) pick up a bunch of sharks from the ocean (super unrealistic) and then drops them – still alive – onto the city of LA (unbearably unrealistic). The acting is horrible, the CGI is horrible, and the premise is absurd. But Sharknado is so bad you can’t stop watching. It’s like a trainwreck. A trainwreck filled with sharks. You’ll want to turn the movie off, but it’s so asinine that you won’t be able to. It’s simply too bad to be ignored.\n\n2012\n\nRemember the hype over the Aztec calendar? Or was it the Mayan calendar? I can’t even remember anymore, but back in 2012 the hysteria was so strong that some people literally ventured to mountaintops and pyramids to await the apocalypse. The movie 2012 capitalized on this fear by showing the world getting destroyed by a series of natural disasters… in the year 2012, with only a chosen few being saved by giant “arks”.\n\nInto the Storm\n\nInto the Storm very much feels like a spiritual sequel to Twister. The movie takes place in a small Oklahoma town where a cluster of tornadoes have touched down, creating the largest storm in the state’s history. There’s also fire tornadoes and even a massive mile-wide F-5 that flattens the town. The hyperactive storm makes the movie feel less believable than Twister, but a bigger storm means more chaos and more destruction…and isn’t that what a disaster movie is all about?\n\nWhere to watch movies like Twisters online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where all these movies like Twisters are streaming online in the United States!\n\nGlen Powell is one of the fastest-rising actors in Hollywood ever since his breakthrough role in Top Gun: Maverick. While some may think he’s an overnight sensation, he has been active in the industry for over 20 years and has starred in many hidden gems before the Top Gun sequel. Since he has attained more widespread recognition, he has shown an affinity for comedies and action movies, including playing a storm chasing influencer in the Twister standalone sequel, Twisters.\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where to watch Glen Powell’s best movies on streaming platforms like Netflix, MGM+, Disney+, and more!\n\nThe film that boosted Glen Powell’s career is also one of his best movies: Top Gun: Maverick. Not only does Powell shine as Lieutenant Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin, who strongly parallels a young Maverick Mitchell (Tom Cruise), but the movie also surpasses the original with its stronger storyline and breathtaking aerial cinematography.\n\nSince then, Glen Powell has proven he’s a leading man with Anyone But You and Hit Man. In Anyone but You, Powell and Sydney Sweeney mesmerize viewers as Ben and Bea, a couple whose electric connection with one another sours. Despite their ill feelings towards one another, they’re forced to vacation together in Sydney, Australia, to support their friends’ marriage. The film was a box office hit due to its raunchy rom-com premise and the palpable chemistry between Powell and Sweeney.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hit Man, Glen Powell portrays Gary Johnson, who poses as a hitman to catch those conspiring to commit murders. He truly shows his acting prowess by taking on numerous identities, accents, personalities, and disguises for the film. Although Anyone but You and Hit Man received the most fanfare, Powell also recently starred in the highly-rated Devotion and The Blue Angels.\n\nHowever, not all of Glen Powell’s best movies are new. One of his best pre-Top Gun: Maverick films is the 2018 rom-com Set It Up. In this movie, Powell takes on the role of matchmaker Charlie Young, who conspires with Harper Moore (Zoey Deutch) to set their bosses up so they can get some much-needed time off. Once again, Powell's chemistry with his co-star is wonderful, and the movie is a lighthearted and enjoyable rom-com.\n\nPowell also has a small role in the powerful biographical movie Hidden Figures, which highlights the contributions of three incredible women who helped win the space race.\n\nWhere to watch the best Glen Powell movies online\n\nCheck out our guide below to find the 10 best Glen Powell movies, ranked by Powell’s performance and the quality of the movie, and where to stream them!\n\nStranger Things is gearing up for its fifth and final season. The show became one of Netflix’s most-watched series of all time due to its unique blend of sci-fi and ‘80s vibes, which has drawn nostalgic comparisons to movies like E.T. and Stand By Me.\n\nIf you’re looking for more shows with retro charm, youthful characters, and quality sci-fi stories, this guide will reveal 10 more great TV shows like Stranger Things you can stream today on platforms like Netflix, Max, Prime Video, and more!\n\nCobra Kai\n\nCobra Kai isn’t set in the ‘80s, but its predecessor, The Karate Kid, was. As a result, the ‘80s nostalgia is almost as strong as in Stranger Things, with numerous references to ‘80s movies, cars, music, and more. Additionally, its story of a group of teens who join karate dojos and become involved in feuds and town secrets is almost as intriguing as Stranger Things, even without the supernatural elements.\n\nDark\n\nDark boasts several similarities to Stranger Things, especially since it is set in a fictional town where several teenagers begin investigating the disappearances of children. Although the show initially takes place in the present day, season 2 is set in the ‘80s. However, Dark also distinguishes itself from Stranger Things by delving into time travel rather than alternate dimensions and featuring more mature themes and content.\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nDead Boy Detective is set in the present day, but Charles Rowland (Jayden Revri), the ghost of a teenage boy who died in 1989, brings in some ‘80s vibes. With 1980s vibes, teen detectives, and plenty of grisly stories about demons and ghosts, Dead Boy Detectives will appeal to viewers who especially enjoyed the horror elements of Stranger Things season 4.\n\nDeadly Class\n\nSet in the 1980s, Deadly Class follows the adventures of Marcus (Benjamin Wadsworth), a homeless teen who gets recruited into King’s Dominion, an elite private school for the children of prominent crime families. It plays like a dark, rebellious teen drama with ‘80s undertones, violence, and high stakes.\n\nFrom\n\nFrom elevates the horror/sci-fi elements of Stranger Things, placing viewers into a mysterious town that traps its residents and holds terrifying secrets. While Stranger Things has elements of mystery surrounding its small town with grim secrets, From delves deeper into this premise with a town that offers viewers a very complex and terrifying puzzle.\n\nHis Dark Materials\n\nFor those intrigued by Stranger Things’ Upside Down, His Dark Materials offers a deep dive into the sci-fi concept of alternate dimensions. The series follows Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keene), whose investigation of a kidnapping and a mysterious substance known as Dust leads her on an adventure through multiple worlds. With strong character development and faithfulness to its source material, His Dark Materials is an exceptionally well-made teen adventure series.\n\nI Am Not Okay with This\n\nLike Stranger Things, I Am Not Okay with This is set in the 1980s and focuses on a girl with telekinetic powers that she doesn’t quite know how to control. While its lead character is reminiscent of Stranger Things’ Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), I Am Not Okay with This also leans more into the coming-of-age elements and has an indie feel to it.\n\nLockwood & Co.\n\nWhile it’s set in the present day, Lockwood & Co. still brings the ‘80s vibes by occurring in an alternate dimension reminiscent of the ‘80s. In the series, a group of teens are forced to take matters into their own hands when they learn that only children can sense and dispose of ghosts who pose a deadly threat. With ‘80s vibes and a group of ghost-hunting and mystery-solving teens, Lockwood & Co. is a solid supernatural alternative to Strange Things.\n\nMisfits\n\nMisfits see a group of teenagers navigating supernatural occurrences as they all discover they have wild powers after an electrical storm. For viewers looking for a Stranger Things-esque show but with some elevated humor and off-the-wall storylines, Misfits is the show for you.\n\nPaper Girls\n\nPaper Girls has drawn strong parallels to Stranger Things with its ‘80s setting and group of teen friends who bike around their town and investigate supernatural activity. It sets itself apart from Stranger Things by having the teens caught in the middle of a time-traveling conflict rather than alternate dimensions. Additionally, it approaches the sci-fi genre from a feminist perspective with its all-female lead cast.\n\nWhere to watch TV shows like Stranger Things online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream TV shows like Stranger Things in the United States!\n\nMia Goth has quickly become one of the most talked about actresses in Hollywood thanks to her role in Ti West’s X trilogy. Her career is also still relatively young, with her first major role in a wide-release film being 2018’s Suspiria. Goth has since become known as a prominent horror actress and is seen by many as one of this generation’s top Scream Queens.\n\nCheck out our guide below to find out where you can watch the best Mia Goth movies streaming on platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Max and more!\n\nYou can’t talk about Mia Goth’s career without highlighting the X trilogy. In 2022’s original X movie, a group of pornstars arrive at a rural Texas farm to secretly film their next movie. But little do they know their elderly hosts are so jealous of youth that they’re willing to kill. This was followed by the prequel Pearl, which explores the younger years of X’s killer.\n\nIn X, Mia Goth played both Maxine and Pearl, and in the prequel, the actress reprised the role of Pearl, portraying her at a younger age. The finale of the trilogy is MaXXXine, which jumps forward in time and sees Goth returning to her role as Maxine. Set in LA during the ‘80s, Maxine looks to break into Hollywood, but little does she know she’s being stalked by one of the city’s most infamous serial killers: The Night Stalker.\n\nAnother major horror credit for Mia Goth is the Sundance hit Infinity Pool. The movie takes place in a bizarre, fictional foreign country where tourists can literally get away with murder by cloning themselves and forcing the clone to receive the punishment. Much like the movie Hostel, this brings out the most brutal and horrific side of people and the film becomes a complete bloodbath.\n\nBut horror isn’t all Mia Goth is known for. In 2020 she starred alongside Anya Taylor-Joy in the film adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma. The movie is a pulpy, Regency-era British dramedy about the young Emma and her misadventures in life and love. Though the movie was far from the first film adaptation of Emma, it was praised for its costume design and the cast’s performance.\n\nBut before any of her major roles, Mia Goth earned herself a small part in the disaster epic Everest in 2015. The movie retells the tragic story of the 1996 Mt. Everest disaster where dozens of people on the mountain became lost and disoriented during a massive blizzard, resulting in 9 deaths. The movie starred Jake Gyllenhaal, Robin Wright, and Keira Knightley among others.\n\nWhere to watch the best Mia Goth movies online\n\nFind out where to watch more of Mia Goth’s best movies using our guide below, showing where you can stream and digitally rent her best films!\n\nStar Wars isn’t your typical sci-fi story, which often focuses on alien invasions or the rise of AI. Instead, the film is what’s known as a space opera. Space operas offer up grand, epic stories, often about galactic warfare and power struggles, while also focusing on romance and adventure. It’s a unique subgenre that separates it from the rest of sci-fi.\n\nFortunately for Star Wars fans, there are some other great space operas out there, as well as some other sci-fi movies with elements similar to George Lucas’ famous franchise. If you can’t wait for the next Star Wars installment to come out, check out our guide below to find out where you can stream more great movies like Star Wars online right now!\n\nStar Trek\n\nStar Wars and Star Trek have been rivals for decades, but oftentimes fans of one franchise are also fans of the other – and it’s clear to see why. Star Trek also follows a group (in this case, Starfleet) who traverse the universe defending it from evil and working to restore peace and order. The main difference is that Star Wars is more centered on an epic war, whereas Star Trek is more about preventing a widespread war.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy, a ragtag group of misfits are brought together by chance and try to save the galaxy in a clunky old ship. If that isn’t 50 Shades of Star Wars, then I don’t know what is. The movie has since spawned two sequels, a holiday special, two Disney rides, and is known for its great soundtrack and fun action.\n\nSpaceballs\n\nIf you’re a Star Wars fan, it’s basically a sin to not watch Spaceballs. Written and directed by Mel Brooks (he also has a few roles in the film), Spaceballs is the ultimate Star Wars spoof. Why have Jabba the Hutt when you can have Pizza the Hutt? And why have Yoda when you can have Yogurt? Spaceballs also has a fantastic comedic cast including John Candy, Joan Rivers, and Rick Moranis.\n\nHardware Wars\n\nIf Spaceballs is a little too high-budget for your tastes and you want some seriously niche fan-made hilarity, you need to watch Hardware Wars. Han Solo is now “Ham Salad” and the Millennium Falcon is replaced by a flying iron. Hardware Wars is a wildly hilarious no-budget ‘70s spoof of Star Wars that I promise will make you laugh (especially if you’re watching with a few friends and a few drinks).\n\nTitan A.E.\n\nIn Titan A.E., Earth has been destroyed by aliens, forcing what’s left of humanity to live as refugees in whatever dingy galactic outposts they can find. But the secret to human survival is hidden out in the cosmos and it’s up to an eclectic team of characters to find it. Titan A.E. is a great animated alternative to Star Wars and has a kickin’ soundtrack that includes Lit, Powerman 5000, and Luscious Jackson.\n\nTreasure Planet\n\nAnother great animated sci-fi epic is Treasure Planet. The movie is a galactic remake of the classic Treasure Island tale and follows Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who joins a motley crew to search the universe for treasure. The plot stays mostly the same as Treasure Island, but its new space setting makes it fun and unique.\n\nWing Commander\n\nBased on the ‘90s video game series that eventually starred Mark Hamill (see, there’s already a Star Wars connection), Wing Commander centers around the intergalactic war between humans and a feline-like alien race known as the Kilrathi. Upon its premiere, the movie was a total bomb, but in recent years viewers have come to love its campy oddity – very much in the same style as Star Wars’ own kitschy charm.\n\nStarship Troopers\n\nRobert Heinlein’s original 1959 novel Starship Troopers was a swampy mess of pro-fascism and pro-war philosophy… but all told from a pro-America viewpoint. Unlike Heinlein, who never actually saw war, director Paul Verhoeven was born in Nazi-occupied Netherlands and set out to make his film version of Starship Troopers a complete rebuke of Heinlein’s worldview. The film is a total mockery of the pro-war crowd and shows that with war, there’s only one result: death and destruction, there is no winner. For a great space opera that has one hell of an underlying message, this is a must-watch.\n\nSerenity\n\nPicking up after the events of the cult-favorite TV series Firefly, Serenity brought back much of the original cast like Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, and Summer Glau. The film follows the crew of the Serenity as they navigate the galaxy, trying to defeat the evil Reavers. It kind of feels like one giant episode of Firefly, which if you’re a Star Wars fan, is a great thing.\n\nBlue Harvest\n\nBlue Harvest (Season 6) was a double episode-length Family Guy special that parodied Star Wars. Peter took the role of Solo, while Lois played Leia. Other iconic characters joined in too, with Quagmire playing C-3PO. Two more Star Wars specials followed with Something, Something, Something Darkside (Season 8) and It’s a Trap! (Season 9). Even if you’re not a Family Guy fan, the Star Wars specials are still really enjoyable.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Star Wars online\n\nCheck out the list below to find out where to watch movies like Star Wars online streaming in the United States right now!\n\nThe eight-movie Harry Potter film series is the fourth highest-grossing film franchise of all time, which isn’t surprising considering it is based on the bestselling book series of all time. For viewers looking for more wholesome, magical films, this guide will reveal where you can stream 10 movies like Harry Potter on platforms like Disney+, Max, Hulu, and more!\n\nHarry Potter is one of those film series that appeals to viewers of all ages due to its sophisticated worldbuilding, emotional storylines, and ability to offer viewers an escape into a magical world. Viewers simply couldn’t get enough of the golden trio — Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Stone), and Ron (Rupert Grint) — and their fantastical adventures.\n\nIf you want to re-experience the magic of Harry Potter, here are 10 more whimsical, magical, and family-friendly movies to check out.\n\nEncanto\n\nSimilar to how Harry Potter explores people who inherit magical powers, Encanto focuses on a household where magic runs in the family. The Madrigal family’s home in the Encanto is reminiscent of Hogwarts, as it’s a breathtaking place bursting with magic, which also grants the family members special powers. While Encanto boasts the magical and whimsical elements of Harry Potter, it also features award-winning music and a powerful story of family and tragedy.\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\n\nSet in the same universe as Harry Potter, this prequel film follows animal-lover Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he searches for magical creatures. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them offers viewers a deeper dive into Harry Potter history and the vastness of the Wizarding World and its creatures. Whimsical, enchanting, and an impressive feat of world-building, the movie is everything one could want from a prequel to Harry Potter.\n\nHalloweentown\n\nHalloweentown tells the Harry Potter-esque story of a young girl who one day discovers she is actually a witch and travels to a magical place where all witches and supernatural beings live. It may not have the sophisticated world-building of Harry Potter, but it’s the perfect introductory film to magic for young viewers. It will also appeal to viewers who want a wizarding story with more Halloween spirit.\n\nMiss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children\n\nViewers who prefer the Harry Potter series' darker and more mature films, such as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, will enjoy Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. The movie boasts director Tim Burton's gothic flair and is heavier on the supernatural aspects, but it boasts the same spirit as Harry Potter with its story of children with extraordinary abilities who struggle to find acceptance from the non-magical world.\n\nPercy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\n\nPercy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is essentially Harry Potter for mythology fans. It still has magic, a child’s discovery of his powerful heritage, and an otherworldly school, Camp Half-Blood, but instead of being based on British myths and folklore, it is heavily inspired by Greek mythology. The movie is a great Harry Potter alternative for viewers who prefer gods and goddesses to wizards and witches.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\n\nLike Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe offers an escape into a magical world. The worldbuilding is stunning, and the storytelling is captivating. Viewers will be wholly engrossed in this magical story, in which four children become kings, queens, and knights instead of wizards and witches.\n\nThe House with a Clock in Its Walls\n\nThe House with a Clock in Its Walls follows the story of a young orphaned boy who discovers he comes from a family of witches and warlocks and must use his magical powers to uncover a dark secret in his Uncle’s house. The movie is fun and lighthearted, with mild horror and fantasy elements. It also echoes one of Harry Potter’s most emotional storylines of a young boy navigating loss and grief.\n\nThe School for Good and Evil\n\nThe School for Good and Evil is heavily reminiscent of the Gryffindor vs. Slytherin dynamic in Harry Potter, exploring a magical school with students predisposed to be heroes or villains. While it’s a little heavier on the teen drama aspects, it’s ultimately an entertaining and lighthearted fantasy story that explores the concept of good and evil.\n\nThe Sorcerer’s Apprentice\n\nSimilar to Harry Potter, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice brings magic to a modern-day setting. Instead of Hogwarts, though, the action takes place right in New York City as a young man discovers he’s the protégé of the powerful sorcerer Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage). It is a great coming-of-age movie with a fun fantasy twist.\n\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles\n\nViewers who loved the fantastical creators of Harry Potter will love The Spiderwick Chronicles’ deep dive into a magical world filled with ogres, trolls, fairies, and goblins. The movie boasts excellent world-building and stunning visual effects. It’s an imaginative and whimsical story that tackles the power of belief in magic.\n\nWhere to watch movies like Harry Potter online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream movies like Harry Potter in the United States!\n\nBridgerton is one of the most-watched Netflix series of all time. The show’s popularity is hardly surprising as it blends an alternate historical setting with romance, spice, secrets, and high society. For viewers looking for their next period romance drama fix after Bridgerton season 3, this guide will reveal where you can stream 10 more great TV shows like Bridgerton on platforms like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and more!\n\nPart of Bridgerton’s appeal is its ability to transport viewers into another timeline and social class. Another major part of the appeal is the fairytale-like love story that each Bridgerton sibling gets as they come of age.\n\nFor those seeking more of the romance and scandal Bridgerton offers, check out these 10 great shows, which are filled with unique historical settings, magical love stories, and plenty of juicy scandals.\n\nAnne with an E\n\nAnne with an E reimagines Lucy Maud Montgomery’s Anne of Green Gables. The period drama is geared toward slightly older audiences than the books; it tells the origin story of the orphan Anne Shirley and delves into issues like sexuality, conformity, and childhood trauma. Like Bridgerton, it takes advantage of the power of reimagination and alternate histories, providing a wild and heartwarming coming-of-age story about a teenager growing up in 1896 Avonlea.\n\nDownton Abbey\n\nSimilar to Bridgerton, Downton Abbey follows the lives of a wealthy, aristocratic family, the Crawleys, in a specific British historical setting. Viewers who especially enjoy the historical element of Bridgerton will appreciate Downton Abbey’s more serious tone and intimate look into how real-life historical events affect the Crawley family's drama, struggles, and romances.\n\nMary & George\n\nMary & George tells the stranger-than-fiction true story of how mother-and-son duo Mary (Julianne Moore) and George Villiers (Nicholas Galitzine) found an unconventional way to royalty during the reign of James VI and I (Tony Curran). Viewers looking for a show with the same playful tone and penchant for scandal as Bridgerton will love this wild and spicy period drama.\n\nQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\n\nViewers can’t get much closer to Bridgerton than the show’s official spinoff series, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story. Several familiar Bridgerton faces, like Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) and Lady Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell), return in this prequel/spinoff series that serves as an alternate history of the rise of Queen Charlotte and her love story with King George III (Corey Mylchreest). Largely serving as a bonus Bridgerton story with some additional social commentary and historical reimagining, Queen Charlotte is everything fans could want in a spinoff series.\n\nSanditon\n\nLike Bridgerton, Sanditon is set in the Regency Era and is adapted from an unfinished manuscript by legendary romance writer Jane Austen. The series follows Charlotte Heywood's (Rose Williams) adventures in a quiet seaside village as she finds romance, ambition, and small-town secrets. With solid storytelling and a less modernized take on the Regency era, Sanditon is a strong alternative to Bridgerton.\n\nThe Artful Dodger\n\nViewers seeking a period drama with more action and swashbuckling adventure will enjoy The Artful Dodger. It boasts the historical elements and forbidden romances of Bridgerton but also serves as a unique continuation of Jack Dawkins’ (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) story after the events of Charles Dickens’ Oliver Twist.\n\nThe Buccaneers\n\nSimilar to Bridgerton, The Buccaneers is a period drama that follows several wealthy young women as they navigate high society and seek partners for marriage. The twist is that these women are Americans, and their navigation of London's high society sparks an interesting cultural war. Given that these women are less accustomed to and less willing to follow the rules of high society, there’s even more room for scandal, humor, and feminism.\n\nThe Gilded Age\n\nHailing from the same creator as Downton Abbey, The Gilded Age is an intriguing drama that strives for historical accuracy while tackling the titular American time period. While it’s largely a deep dive into the race and class conflicts of the time, it does have that Bridgerton-esque flair with its exploration of the clash between two powerful and wealthy families.\n\nThe Great\n\nThe Great is a satirical and comedic reimagining of Catherine the Great's (Elle Fanning) rise. It takes Bridgerton’s alternate history premise and lighthearted tone and ramps it up several notches for a delightful and absurd spin on a historical story.\n\nVictoria\n\nViewers interested in what happens beyond Bridgerton’s Regency Era will be intrigued by Victoria, which examines the rise of Queen Victoria (Jenna Coleman) from the 1830s - 1850s. It finds a balance between historical accuracy and creative liberty and boasts phenomenal performances. The show especially boasts the ability to transport viewers into a different time and enthrall them with the period's history, art, and costumes.\n\nWhere to watch TV shows like Bridgerton online\n\nCheck out our list below to find out where to stream TV shows like Bridgerton in the United States!\n\nSummer has arrived yet again, and that can only mean one thing… the return of Shark Week!
