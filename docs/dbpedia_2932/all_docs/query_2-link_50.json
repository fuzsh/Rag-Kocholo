        "text": "As part of the effort to personalize, Rockstar's PR department tracked scores for reviewers on a person-by-person basis, often hoping to influence which writers were selected to review their games. \"Rockstar was big on trying to get specific people to review specific games,\" says Zuniga. \"But it's a fine line--you can't just come out and ask, because it seems like you're trying to take away editorial control.\" They went so far as to track seemingly pointless personal details of some writers. \"Hilariously, we even had a list of journalist preferences: Likes cake, married, went to school at Indiana U. Shit like that,\" says Zuniga. \"It was a weird f*cking place to work.\"\n\nIn the end, the efforts never earned the kind of scores head honchos wanted. \"The score would never live up to the expectation,\" says Zuniga. \"If it scored a 99, the expectation was for every other review to be 100.\" What the higher-ups wanted was what business tends to want: predictability, something that can be planned and executed. \"They wanted to feel comfort,\" says Zuniga. \"They wanted to know that when we went to Company A and talked with Person B that we could expect result C.\"\n\nVeteran Laura Heeb Mustard says that, in the end, blackballing isn't an effective strategy for a publicist--that, in fact, it's bad PR. \"While there are many ways to attempt to persuade a journalist to hold on a story, one way I would not recommend is by trying to bully them into not reporting the item,\" says Mustard. \"While there are some outlets that may retreat in fear of being cut off, there are others that will retaliate against your threats. Now, they're in a position of scooping your news--with the added bonus of a juicy story about how you tried to strong-arm them. We've seen a number of different cases of this recently, and quite frankly, in each case there are more effective strategies that could have been applied.\"\n\nOften, she says, such strong-arm tactics are not born in the PR department, but further up the chain of command, where executives have less experience in the trenches with the media and more power to wield. \"While it may be the PR person that is ultimately tasked with carrying out the threat, you should dig deeper into where the actual threat is coming from. I bet it's from someplace in management,\" says Mustard. \"Execs have a hard time reading bad press because they very quickly see the negative impact of it. And because they usually have the authority to do so, they often come down on PR to either 'fix the problem' or to punish the outlet. However, because they aren't involved in day-to-day media relations, they often fail to see the long term negative impact of retaliation against the media.\""
