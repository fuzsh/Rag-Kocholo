INTRODUCTION [INRO1] ================================================================================ \"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\" The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King the video game is based on the movie The Return of the King as well as the books, The Two Towers and The Return of the King by J.R.R. Tolkien. The game follows the paths of what's left of the Fellowship to their conclusion. This game uses the same Hack n' Slash engine as EA's previous title \"The Two Towers\" but greatly improves upon it. Sporting more RPG elements, a much larger character selection, better graphics and clips from all three films. This is one of the best movie to video game transitions ever made. This is my second full length FAQ/Walkthrough. The goal of this guide is to provide comprehensive coverage of the game, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King while giving away as little as the story as possible, but by no means is this guide spoiler free. This guide was written using the Playstation 2 version of the game, but since there is little difference between the ports, it is useable for all platforms. -Shift *Warning* This guide does contain minor spoilers for both the game and the books. ================================================================================ 2.

This will most likely be your primary attack throughout the game. * FIERCE ATTACK: A strong yet slow attack. Which is capable of breaking enemy shields and armour. Useful against shield carrying foes and a must against most champions. * PHYSICAL ATTACK: Either a kick or a shove depending on the character. It is worthless by itself when used against enemies, but is apart of some useful combos. It is also used to knock down ladders. * PARRY: Used to deflect enemy attacks and arrows. * RANGED ATTACK: A longed range attack useful for taking out enemy archers. There is no aiming needed, just face towards your target to achive a lock. Holding the fire button results in a more powerful shot. Each shot will use one missile. * BACKSTEP: A quick step backward. Useful when fighting Trolls, Archers or when trying to get out of a crowd. * ACTION COMMAND: Lets you interact with certain objects on some levels. More on this below. * KILLING MOVE: Useful to quickly take out knocked down enemies, as well as those in their 'stand up' animation. * SPECIAL ABILITY: What special ability you have depends on what character you are using. Whenever you activate it, the portrait of your character (by healthbar) will begin to fill. Once filled the ability will deactivate and you must wait for the portrait to empty before you can use it again. * PAUSE MENU: From this menu you can look at a mission tip, the upgrades your character has, or quit the current mission. Note: Any controls mentioned in the Walkthrough are for the PS2 version. --------------------------- - CHARACTERS --------------------------- ARAGORN -Special Ability: Increase damage/Enter perfect mode faster -Missile Weapon: Arrows Aragorn is your jack of all trades character, good at everything, bad at nothing. But what else would you expect from the lost king of men? He has decent health, speed, and power. As well as a fairly quick killing move. He also has the coolest looking warrior bane, where he flips them over and stabs them right in their face with his dagger. LEGOLAS -Special Ability: Increase damage/Enter perfect mode faster -Missile Weapon: Arrows Legolas is fast and has a great power in is ranged attack. But his melee attacks and health leave something to desire. When you fight hand to hand, stick with longer combos to get into perfect mode, then let your bow sing. GIMLI -Special Ability: Increase damage/Enter perfect mode faster -Missile Weapon: Hand Axes Ah, Gimli as powerful as umm...a dwarf with an axe, and as slow as...well, a dwarf with an axe. His melee attacks are fairly slow, but very powerful, so stick to short combos like the Orc Hewer and Balrog's Gambit, as he'll probably kill them before you get off something longer. He's ranged attack is slow and not to strong, so stay away unless you have to use it. His killing move, though it looks cool (he uses it in the ROTK movie) it's VERY slow, so stay away from it and Final Judgment if there is more then one enemy around. GANDALF -Special Ability: Magic Shield -Missile Weapon: Magic Bolts At level ten, Gandalf is the strongest character in the game, and he's not to bad before that either. Although he can't take many hits, he can dish out tons of damage. Whether by bashing enemies while under the protection of his shield, or using his incredibly powerful(especially when upgraded) devastating and ranged attacks. The downside to his devastating attack is that it costs ten missles per use, but the resulting perfect mode (if there is enough enemies) is well worth it. His killing move is somewhat slow, so stick to magic and combos that kill them while they stand. THE HOBBITS (Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin) -Special Ability: Turn temporary invisible -Missile Weapon: Throwing Knifes The Hobbits are very quick, in both foot speed and their strikes. However they're weak both offensively and defensively, and must rely on banes and Final Judgment to kill the majority of their foes. Their upgraded ranged attack wont kill instantly, but will poison them so they will drop later. The killing move is incredibly fast, you should be able to take out knocked down enemies even in the middle of crowds. Their special ability has them using their Elvish cloaks to turn invisible, though they move half speed, any non-boss enemy (including Champions) can be killed with one killing move to the back. To unlock Merry and Pippin as playable characters you must complete the 'Crack of Doom'. FARAMIR -Special Ability: Increase damage/Enter perfect mode faster -Missile Weapon: Arrows With the exception of a couple animations involving his dagger, and a much stronger ranged attack(on par with Legolas) Faramir is exactly like Aragorn. To unlock Faramir as a playable character you must complete the 'Crack of Doom'. --------------------------- - ENEMIES --------------------------- The forces of Sauron have many different species in their ranks. Some you will constantly face off against throughout the game, others only appear in a single mission. Most of your enemies can be divided into four different types: -Normal: The basic version of the enemy, easiest to defeat. -Shield: These enemies are capable of carrying a shield, which will deflect all Speed, Ranged, and Physical attacks from the front. You must use a Fiecre attack break the shield. -Archer: These guys arm themselves with a bow or crossbow, to attack you from a distance. -Champion: These are the normal enemies with a life bar. In addition to having much more life, most are equipped with armour. ORCS -Types: Normal, Shield, Archer, Champion -Bane: Orc Bane These are the small goblin-like enemies you encounter in almost every level. They are short (only a foot or so taller then a Hobbit) and normally arm themselves with just a sword, a shield and a spear or a crossbow. Singly week, they rely on large numbers to overwhelm their foes. URUKS -Types: Normal, Shield, Archer, Champion -Bane: Bane of Sauron These are the larger species of Orcs from Mordor, encountered on later levels. They have respectable offensive capabilities, and even a small group can pose a threat to a weakened warrior. Fortunately they lack a solid defense and are easily defeated through cautious attacking. URUK-HAI -Types: Normal, Shield, Archer -Bane: Bane of Sauron These half-orc, half-men hybrid are the creation of Saruman the White. Clad in armour baring the White Hand, most of these Orcs where killed at the battle of Helm's Deep and entirely wiped out in their escape back to Isengard. Similar to Uruks in most respects, they only appear in three levels. BESERKERS -Type: Champion -Bane: None These are the Champion Uruk-hai who carry large swords. Found almost everywhere in the Two Towers game, they make a few scattered appearances in this game. TROLLS -Type: Champion -Bane: None These large and strong giants are more then capable of taking out even the strongest of characters. Their presence never goes unnoticed on the battlefield. They require special tactics to bring down. Try using discarded spears or make them the sole target of your special abilities. DEAD -Types: Normal, Shield, Archer, Champion -Bane: None The men of the mountain pledged their allegiance to Isildur, to fight for him and the Last Alliance. When they broke their oath, Isildur cursed them and they now walk the earth as spirits. They have fighting style similar to that of the Orcs, but they have no Bane. They only appear in three levels. EASTERLINGS -Types: Normal, Shield, Champion -Bane: Warrior Bane These are the evil men hailing from the unknown lands east of Middle-Earth. They are in constant battle with the Men of Gondor and Rohan. Though their offensive capabilities are average, their armour is thick and requires several strikes before they fall. SPIDERS -Type: Normal -Bane: None These giant spiders are the children of Shelob. They take several strikes from a Hobbit's blade to be killed. Fortunately they are prone to fliping on their backs, ripe for a killing move. The combo, Final Judgment, is a great way to exploit this weakness. SPIDERLINGS -Type: Special -Bane: None These are the small (well normally they would be huge) spiders that appear in large groups on the floor. There is no way to kill them, and they drain your health very fast if you step on them. They don't like fire, so a well placed torch will cause them to scatter. MUMAKIL -Type: Champion -Bane: None The Mumakil are the giant Elephant-like beasts riden by the men of Harad. They are well armoured and can take multiple shots of arrows, spears and even siege fire before they fall. THE NAZGUL -Type: Boss -Bane: None These are the Nine, the Ringwraiths, Black Riders. Whether on foot, horseback, or airborne riding on top Fell Beasts, they are a force to be reckoned with. SHELOB -Type: Boss -Bane: None A gaint spider-like creature whose lair sets at the backdoor of Mordor. SAURON'S LIEUTENANT (Mouth of Sauron) -Type: Boss -Bane: None A Man (he is not a Ringwraith) of great power and importance in the land of Mordor, the ambassador of Sauron. He is sent to parley with the Captains of the West at the Black Gate. --------------------------- - DROPPED ITEMS --------------------------- These are the items you will find scattered around levels or dropped by enemies: * RED POTION: Recovers a small amount of health. * GREEN POTION: Recovers a moderate amount of health. * SILVER QUIVER: Recovers your missiles. * ELVEN RUNESTONE: Gives you 1000 experience points, this cannot be dropped by enemies. --------------------------- - ACTION COMMAND --------------------------- You can interact with various objects on most levels by pressing the Action Command button while inside the blue circle. Some of the more common ones: * SPEARS: Normally found protruding out of some suckers side, or arranged in some semi-organized piles. These things are powerful enough to break armour and shields, and will kill any unarmoured normal enemy (including Trolls) in one shot. * SIEGE ENGINES: Catapults, Ballistae ect. These are normally used to fulfill objectives or to help you bring down enemy siege engines. They are very useful when fighting Mumakil. * BOILING OIL: Strategically set in a few places, knock these over to rain a painful death on whatever is below. * HOT COALS: Set in metal baskets across a few levels. You can knock them over at certain angles, spreading the coals over the floor and setting any enemy who walks over them on fire. * TORCHES: Useable in scaring away spiders, burning webs or lighting Orcs aflame. * LEVERS: Used in the raising and lowering of bridges and the opening and closing of gates. * LADDERS/ROPES: Allows acending/decending to different heights. --------------------------- - SKILL METER --------------------------- The Skill Meter is that circular meter to the right of your health bar. Every time you attack (and connect) with an enemy, or parry an attack, it increases. Every time an enemy connects with you, or you just stand around, it decreases. The Skill Meter effects how much experience points you get will you dispatch an enemy. A fair kill happens when the skill meter is very low, and nets you the least amount of experience points. A good kill when the meter is under half, giving you a moderate amount of experience points. An excellent kill when the meter is above half, which gives a high amount of experience. A perfect kill will only happen when the meter is full, which puts you in 'perfect mode', this gives you the maximum amount of experience. There are several ways to get into perfect mode: -Use Combos. Combos raise your skill faster then regular button mashing, after enough combos(and parrying) you'll enter perfect. -Parry. Depending on how many enemies are around you, you can reach perfect by simply parrying. -Use Banes. If you successfully preform a bane, you'll immediately go into perfect mode. However, since the mode starts at the beginning of the animation it's much shorter then a normal perfect mode. -Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Faramir's special ability allows them to reach perfect in only a few hits, combos, or parrys. -Gandalf's devastating attack, when used in the middle of a crowd. Your mission rating is based on how many kills you receive in each category. For example, you get 56 Fairs, 28 Goods, 20 Excellents, and 10 Perfects. You mission rating would be 'Good'. Even though you had more fairs, it's offset by the excellents and perfects. You will then receive bonus experience off your mission rating: -Fair: 1000xp -Good: 2000xp -Excellent: 3000xp -Perfect: 5000xp --------------------------- - COMBAT TIPS --------------------------- * Parry and dodge. Not only will you save health, but you will also keep your skill meter from decreasing. Since parrying will raise your skill, you should always try to parry instead of dodge. However, there are some situations, like when fighting a Cave Troll, where parrying wont work. * Use Combos. Not only do they increase your skill faster, most of them look pretty cool. You bought them for a reason you know. * Banes. Know your enemies and whether or not you have a bane that will work on them. The Orc Bane works on Orcs. The Warrior bane works on the Easterlings (evil men). The Bane of Sauron works on Uruks and the Uruk-hai. * Champions, or normal enemies with a life bar, normally have armour. Which means you must first break it using a fierce attack or spear before you can harm them. * When fighting Archers, the parry, backstep, shoot tactic is very effective. * When surrounded don't panic. Just keep parrying and wait for either an ally to come and help you, or a chance to either bane or backstep away. * When your low on health(it's flashing red) the chances of an enemy dropping a potion dramatically increase. The same goes if your out of missiles. * Use your special ability wisely. After each use you will have a small 'cooldown' time, where you will have to wait to use it again. * Try to get into perfect mode as much as possible. Not only do you get the maximum amount of experience from your kills, you get increased damage as well. ================================================================================ 3. WALKTHROUGH [WLKT3] ================================================================================ Although you can pick any path after Helm's Deep, some stages will still be locked until certain stages on other paths are completed. This walkthrough presents the paths in an order that will not cause them to be interrupted by this. This guide was written for single player, but since there is very little difference between single player an co-op, it can be used for both modes. The Playable Characters list at the beginning of each subsection applies directly to single player. The Recommended Upgrades list at the end of each subsection applies to those who use the guide from beginning to end. Keep in mind that to beat this game it will take a certain amount of skill. This walkthrough will give the heads up and general strategy for each stage, but several times over the course of the game you will be forced to fight large groups of enemies to advance. And to kill these enemies may require practice. Make sure to know your combos, banes, and any weaknesses your enemies may have. This guide will give as many tips as possible, but if you're still unable to complete a particular stage, it's probably because you're simply not killing fast enough. This game has a steep learning curve, but once you master it, the game will seem too easy. Good luck. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3a. HELM'S DEEP ~The Path of the Wizard~ [WLKA] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"There suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shinning in the rising sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Behind him, hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men... 'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn. 'Gandalf is come again!'\" Playable Characters: Gandalf After the opening scene you'll start the tutorial. Which immediately thrusts you into battle with four Uruk-hai, just use your speed attack to dispatch them. Now keep fighting around here near Gimli until Legolas asks for aid. Then make your way to the ladder, using your fierce attack on the shielded Uruk-hai in the way. After you ascend the ladder (just in time too) use your ranged attack to pick off each archer, while parrying and backsteping their arrows. After they're defeated, Aragorn will need your help back on the ground. Fortunately, a rope will appear a few feet away, take out the three charging Uruk-hai, and slide down the rope. Since this is a very easy level and a great place to gain lots of experience, just keep fighting away here until the level ends. You will mainly be attacked by Uruk-hai, and you will be getting alot of help from your allies. You can try standing near a pile of spears and start chucking them at anything that moves, or just jump into the melee. Your choice. If for whatever reason you want to end it prematurely, fire off a catapult at the cart. Either way you should end up with at least 11,000xp. Use this to purchase the Orc Bane and the Orc Hewer for the fellowship. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: Orc Bane, Orc Hewer. -Gandalf: None. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3b. ROAD TO ISENGARD ~The Path of the Wizard~ [WLKB] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Gandalf The level opens with several Uruk-hai running away from you, don't waste your missles as you can't hurt them. As you proceed up the path two Uruk-hai will try and jump you, since the Orc Bane wont work on them use the Orc Hewer and keep going. A little further up the path you'll see an Ent smashing some Orcs. Then a couple shield Uruk-hai backed by an archer will attack you, take out the Uruks while under the log then back up and shoot the archer. Alittle further down the path you should spot one of those explosive carts. Target it with your ranged attack and fire, it will explode and kill the Uruks nearby. After killing an Archer on the rock take the left path and blow up another cart, then backtrack and take the right path. As you pass under the bridge you'll get jumped, take them out and follow the path to the other side of the bridge and flank the Archers. Continue down the path, taking out Uruks and Archers as you go. Soon, you will run into some small Orcs--these you can bane by parrying their attacks and using your killing move--this will put you in a short perfect mode, which is very useful in the upcoming fights. Follow the path downhill and to the right. *Checkpoint* After the Ent smashes two Orcs together, continue down the hill. At the base of the hill a counter will appear in the top right corner. You (or the Ents) must kill 75 Orcs to proceed. Just hang out near the base of the hill and kill the Orcs that attack you. If you want you can enter the middle of the battle, but you run the risk of Ents trampling you. After 75 are dead, an Ent will break some rocks revealing a new path, take it. As you proceed you'll hear some dialogue between Gandalf and Saruman. Once you round the next bend, two Uruk-hai backed by several Archers will attack you. Lure the Uruks back around the corner to take them out free from Archer fire. Now pick off the archers and continue down the path. After a couple more scuffles you'll reach another checkpoint. *Checkpoint* Run up the small hill, shoot the cart and finish off anything that survived. In this next section, you'll have to shoot carts at the bases of the towers, while being assaulted by arrows and waves of three Orcs each. Just shoot the nearest cart, parry the arrows, bane the Orcs (this is a great place to get bane timing down), and proceed to the next tower. Once you reach the bridge, take out the two towers on it's left side, kill the two shielded Uruks and cross it. Take a left to grab the exp item, and kill the next wave of enemies. Now head right past the bridge. Once you get to another hill two Orcs and their Archer buddys come out to attack you. Lure the Orcs away from the Archers and bane them. Then quickly kill the Archers and run down the hill. Once you reach the base, you'll be shot at from off screen, immediately backstep and take out the charging Orcs while behind cover from the Archers. Run down the hill and you'll see an Ent trying to break the dam, only he is being shot at by Archers, who are guarded by a Beserker. Approach the champion and use your magic shield (R1+R2+L1+L2). Attack him with a fierce attack to break his armour, then Orc Hewer him to death. Now it gets a little hectic, you must protect the Ent by killing the archers (who will ignore you and only attack the Ent). After you kill the Archers on yourside, take out the ones across the river. Then shot the dam as many times as you can before the next wave comes. Eventually, the dam breaks and the level ends.

MINAS TIRITH-TOP OF WALL ~The Path of the Wizard~ [WLKC] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Gandalf The Orc icon in the top right corner is your overrun meter, should it fill, you will automatically lose. The map icon next to it looks a little like this: ST X X X X X X ST ----------------------- ----------------------- | E|X X|E | -------------------- | X X | -------------------- | ------------ G |C P| -------------------- X: Places where ladders can appear C: Catapult Tower P: Potion Tower E: Empty Towers G: Way to the gate ST: Places where siege towers can appear Your goal here is to keep the wall from being overrun. When you see red dots appear on the map, that means a ladder is going up, quickly run to it and use your physical attack (circle) to knock the ladders down, reducing your overrun meter. So keep running from ladder to ladder knocking them down and killing any Orc that climbs up. But try not to get hung up fighting any Orcs that make it onto the wall, focus mainly on knocking down the ladders. Note: If you need some health, there are a couple of potions in the bottom right tower. After awhile you'll see a cutscene of a siege tower approaching, and Gandalf will say you need to use the catapults. Run to the bottom left tower, while knocking off any ladders in your way, and fire the catapult twice, bringing the siege tower down. Quickly go back to knocking off the ladders to lower your overrun meter. But stay either in the middle or right section of the wall, as another siege tower will appear on the far right side, and this one your going to have to shoot. After you destroy it, return to the middle, and keep knocking off ladders and killing Orcs (Orc Hewer is great here). Keep your eye on the left side of the map for another siege tower, once you see it, return to the catapult tower. After you order the first shot, a flying Ringwraith will attack the tower, shot him a couple of times and he will fall, blocking off the right section. Order the second shot to finish of the siege tower. Then hurry back to the middle section. Once there, you'll see a cutscene of a siege tower landing on the right section. Hurry there by using the action button near one of the middle ropes to lower yourself to the outer wall. Then run to the next rope and climb up over to the next section. Run to the tower, use your magic shield, kill the Orcs and destroy the tower. After it's destruction, follow the Gondorian soldiers to the gate to end the level.

MINAS TIRITH-COURTYARD ~The Path of the Wizard~ [WLKD] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Gandalf The goal of this level is to hold off the orcs until 200 women make it to safety. The first wave is nothing but regular orcs, and a couple of which carry shields. Just use the Orc Bane and combo them to death. Save your special ability and missiles for later. The next wave consist of unshielded Uruks, and unless you have the Bane of Sauron, you'll have to stick with combos. Note: The are two potions in barrels on opposite sides of the courtyard. Once 50 women make it to safety, several orc archers will line up at the far gate. Quickly take them out with your missles and concentrate on the new waves of melee attackers. If you have the missles to spare, wait by the gate for the next wave of Uruks. Wait for the first couple to pass you then use your devastating attack (hold triangle), which should send you right into perfect mode. Once 100 women make it to safety, champion Uruks will start to appear. Use your fierce attack to break their armour then take advantage of the spears that are spread around. If they have no back up, try to relentlessly combo them for a perfect mode. Catapult fire will also start to rain down, but always in the same spots, which you should avoid. When 150 women make it to safety, a short cutscene will occur. You're now up against Trolls, plus everything else from the preceding waves. Quickly use your special ability and charge one of the Trolls. After a few combos, he'll go down and set you in perfect. Now quickly grab a spear and skewer his buddies, if you can't reach the spears in time, just concentrate on one with your ranged attack. Now if your low on health, retreat to the safety point, where the Trolls won't go, and hold there. Otherwise kill has many enemies as you can. Once 200 women reach the safety point, a cutscene will occur and the level will end.

PATHS OF THE DEAD ~The Path of the King~ [WLKE] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it. The way is shut.\" Playable Characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli Proceed down the path and through the mists. Once on the other side, the Dead will attack you, take them out with speed attacks, and continue on. Don't pick up a spear yet, instead run under the arch. This will trigger a cutscene, and you will have to fight more Dead. 'Kill' them and continue on. Enter the mists and start walking. About halfway through you will see spectres fly over head. Guess what? You're right, more Dead. When on the other side of the mists, you will see two Archers appear on the bridge. Once they're dispatched, take the left path up towards the bridge. Take out the next wave, grab the quiver and cross the bridge. Follow the path straight and take out the two Dead that spawn. Continue past them and grab the experience slab from the ledge. You should be level two now, and if you purchased any level two upgrades for the Fellowship, your character can now use them. Right after you grab the slab, some Dead predictably spawn behind you. After you're done with them, run up to the left edge and push a boulder down on some enemies below. Now backtrack to the bridge. Go to the lower level and take the descending path for a red potion. Go back up and attack the shield carrying Dead. Continue on to take out whats left of those you dropped the boulder on. After another room of enemies you should run into a raised bridge. Run to the lever on it's right side, before you have a chance to turn it, three Archers spawn across the gap. Take them out and lower the bridge. Grab the potion on it's left side and cross. *Checkpoint* Note: To pass through the mists quickly, turn around and backstep. As you proceed through the mists, the bridge will raise and you will get ambushed. Use your special ability to get into perfect and destroy them. Run up to where the Archers guarding the bridge stood for a red potion, then exit on the other side of the mists. There is another red potion as you round the bend. A few steps after that you'll see a short cutscene and have to fight more Dead. Make your way through them and enter the next section of mists. On the other side is more Dead, then to change things up you get to climb a ladder then more Dead. But not just normal Dead, these Dead have a champion Dead. Anyway use your special ability, and kill the Dead. After these Dead are dead, continue on and fight some more Dead. Now knock over the giant statue, bridging the gap across. Once across, take the left path and run under the statue to the lever on the gate's right side. Feign using the lever and kill the two champions that spawn behind you. Then raise the gate and pass through. Grab the potion and start to cross the long bridge. Once you reach the middle, you will be trapped and attacked from both sides. A counter of 35 will appear in the upper right corner. Aragorn and Legolas should use Final Judgment on each new enemy that spawns from one side. Gimli can use Orc Hewer. Once you start getting overwhelmed, use your special ability and finish the rest off in perfect mode. Once you defeat 35, run to the other end of the bridge and the level will end. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: None. -Aragorn: Ranger Fury, Dunedain Arrows, Gondorian Sword Master. -Legolas: Mirkwood Arrows, Light of Lothlorien. -Gimli: Dwarven Fury, Lonely Mountain Lore. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3f. THE KING OF THE DEAD ~The Path of the King~ [WLKF] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"The dead do not suffer the living to pass.\" \"You will suffer me!\" Playable Characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli Boss: The King of The Dead -------------------------- During the cutscene your allies will be cut off from you, leaving you to fight alone. Once the battle starts, he will burrow into the ground and raise up at another location. Avoid him as he reappears or you will take some damage. He will then attack you with brief three hit combos, parry then respond in kind. After a few exchanges, he will borrow again and appear on the far edge of the area. A cutscene will occur, and you'll have to fight four unshielded Dead. Sine you can't hurt their King now, concentrate on them. He will then attack with his three hit combo, hereafter he will again summon more dead, this time four Archers. Take them out using the textbook parry, backstep, shoot technique. If you need more missles, there is a quiver behind one of the boulders. Once again he tests his three hit combos on you. Got his pattern yet? Well, too bad he's about to change it. Another cutscene will occur. You will gain control behind one of the boulders, right as The King does his wind attack. This will break away a section of the boulder. Quickly jump out and shoot a few arrows his way. Do the same through his second wind attack. On the third, just parry, as the rest of the boulder crumbles, he will try to get some cheap shots from behind the dust. He will then attack you with his five hit combo, parry his attacks (his last strike is somewhat delayed) and give him a Orc Hewer right back. He will now switch between; summoning more powerful dead (including champions), his wind attack, and attacking you physically. Just keep wearing him down, and he'll fall. *Checkpoint* After the cutscene, the mountain starts to collapse. Your two allys take off, which is a clue (besides the dialogue of course) that you should too. Seriously, if the dust bowl catches up to you, you will die, so start running. Once you reach the main gate, the path you used to enter will be cut off, and you are forced to go a different way. Unfortunately, there is alot of Dead ready for you. So use your special ability, jump into the mob, and start parrying. Once you hit perfect, use speed attacks to kill as many as you can. Once they're dead, continue on. Note: You can't help but notice all of the boulders crashing down, although they CAN hurt you, I've only be hit once in the several times I've played through. A little further up the path you come to a piece of the way you took in. Soon you'll encounter another short cutscene, producing more Dead. Use your special when available and go for any Champions first. Continue on and you will run into some more mists...which you still walk cautiously through. Once on the other side you'll meet up with your allys and a green potion. Get ready for several more waves of all types of the Dead. Just use Orc Hewer or Final Judgment until the Champions start appear, then use your special and go into perfect to maximize your experience. Since the dust bowl can still catch up, don't linger once they are all defeated. Quickly run out the opening to end the level. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: Warrior Bane, Dark Deliverance. -Aragorn: Wilderness Rage. -Legolas: Elven Fury, Lothlorien Arrows. -Gimli: Mountain Rage, Eredor Axes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3g. THE SOUTHERN GATE ~The Path of the King~ [WLKG] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli To start off, just head to the wide open gate. Once you set foot on the bridge, you will be ambushed. A Troll will shut the gate and jump down from above, and several Uruks and Orcs will try and surround you. Quickly run from the Troll (he will stay on the bridge) back towards the starting postion. Start thinning out the Orcs and make your way back towards the left side of the bridge. Now get into perfect mode, and quickly pick up a spear and skewer the Troll. Note: If you don't kill the Troll here, you can easily kill it using the burning oil on top of the wall. This level has tons of enemies that just keep respawning, as such it is capable of producing massive experince points. So just keep killing as many as you see fit. You do have an objective though. On either side of the path are catapults, one on the right and two on the left. The one on the right will just fire at a Troll on top of the wall. The two on the left will destory a tower in such a way that it gives access to the top of the wall. Make your way there. A few feet from the ladder, three Uruks will attack you. Go into perfect by using the Bane of Sauron (if avialable) or your special ability. Quickly run up the stairs and repeatedly fire at the Troll until he's down. Take out the remaining enemies and knock down the ladders. Eventually a Mumak (Elephant) will show up. Periodically fire at it while taking out new waves of Uruks, and it will fall. Finish off the Uruks and open the gate. A few Orcs will come from the other side of the gate and wait on the bridge. Keep using the nearby pots of burning oil on them until they're dead. Climb down from the wall and enter the gate to end the level.

PELENNOR FIELDS ~The Path of the King~ [WLKH] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli Once your start, run as far right as you can. A counter will appear in the upper right corner. You must kill sixty enemies, mostly Uruks and Shielded Easterlings, before you can move on. I recommend staying away from the middle, where several champions are, and just picking off enemies from the edges. *Checkpoint* You will now have to stop a Mumakil before it can trample Eowyn and Merry. Keep running left until you see it, and use the Ballistae and arrows to bring it down. Once it's defeated, another Mumakil will start advancing, but it's on the other side of the chasm and you are out of range. In between the second and last Ballistae (heading left) is a flag, and to the left of the flag is a path leading into the chasm. Run down and stright across, ignoring all enemies, to the other side. Take out the Mumakil as you did the first one, only this time you are going to have to deal with a few Uruks and Easterlings. A cutscene will occur and the Witchking will start attacking Eowyn and Merry. Run to the left until you see him. Knock down the charging Easterling and shoot as many arrows into the Witchking's side as you can. After Witchking flies off, go back to the path leading down into the chasm, but don't go down yet. Wait here until you see another Mumakil start to advance. Now pay careful attention to which side of the chasm it's coming from, if you see torches, it's on this side, if you see a flag, you will have to cross. Take it out as fast as possible, then go back and attack the Witchking. This process could happen several times, but once the Witchking runs out of life, the level will end.

THE BLACK GATE ~The Path of the King~ [WLKI] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Men of Rohan, of Gondor, my brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come, when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends, and break all bonds of fellowship. An hour of wolves, and shattered shields, when the Age of men comes crashing down. But it is not this day, this day, we fight!\" Playable Characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf Boss: Mouth of Sauron --------------------- Alright a one versus one fight to the death against this...boss? He really is nothing more then a Champion Uruk without armour, but with an extended life bar. All you have to do is baskstep his jump attack, then combo, parry, combo, parry ect. That's it. If you don't reach perfect mode by combo/parrying don't bother wasting your special, as you won't get any extra points. Or you could just to spite him ;) *Checkpoint* There will then be a cutscene where thousands of Orcs will, literally, come through the gate. You will now have to defend your little stronghold from their onslaught. A counter will appear in the upper right corner, signalling how many champions you must kill. As you fight portraits of your allies will appear along the top, and if they should die, you will lose. Depending on who you are playing as, they will be in different postions: ---------------------------------------------- Playing As |Front |Right |Left |Back | ----------------------------------------------| Aragorn |Aragron |Gandolf |Legolas |Gimli | Legolas |Legolas |Aragorn |Gandalf |Gimli | Gimli |Gimli |Aragorn |Gandalf |Legolas| Gandalf |Gandalf |Aragron |Legolas |Gimli | ---------------------------------------------- Note: If you move next to an ally who is low on health they will begin glowing, similar to how you glow when you pass a checkpoint, and start rapidly recovering health. Stay near the front and wipe out as many enemies as you can (devasting attack works great for each new wave), don't worry too much if a few slip by. Once the first Champion enters, immediately break his armour with a Dark Deliverence, and combo him to death. After he's dead make sure all your allies are fine. Don't take to long though, as you might miss another Champion entering through the front, and they make quick work of your allies. After you have killed the third Champion, another cutscene will occur. You now have to defend not only the front, but the right and left as well. The forth Champion should come fairly quickly out of the right. After your done with him make sure your allies health is fine, and look for the next two Champions to come from the front. As long as you keep your allies (and your own) health high, and kill the Champions fairly quickly, you shouldn't have much of a problem. Note: For some reason, you may have to kill seven Champions instead of just six. I think this is because of the small delay in the counter, and if you kill a second Champion before the counter displays the first, the second kill won't count. *Checkpoint* After surviving that last part, your treated to another cutscene, and as an added bonus you get to fight: Boss: Three Ringwraiths ----------------------- Quickly use the three nearby spears on the first one you target, then finish this one off with your ranged attack. Now run next to who is ever lowest on health. Use spears if your near any, otherwise use your ranged attack. After the second one is down, you can either engage in melee combat, or take him out long range. After their defeat, the level ends.

ESCAPE FROM OSGILIATH ~The Path of the Hobbits~ [WLKJ] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Sam Your goal here, as the name infers, is to escape the city of Osgiliath. Follow Gollum and you will run into some Orcs, take them out and head up the stairs. You should see a Ranger fending off some Orcs on the far end, head towars them and the wall to the right explodes, giving you points for the kills. Head through the new opening and use your ranged attack on the Orc archer behind the rubble. Once you ascend the nearby stairs, a timer will appear in the upper right corner. The timer will slowly start to fill, and once it does, a Ringwraith will swoop down and grab Frodo. You can however reverse this by moving Sam (Frodo can still be out in the open) under some sort of roof. Head up to the next section of the roof. Go behind the three Orcs who get crushed by catapult fire to find a ladder. After decending the timer will disappear. Take out the archers from behind and go down into the next section. Keep fighting Orcs here and you should reach level two. Which means you should now have access to the Orc Bane, use it on the rest of the Orcs. Once your done, grab the red potion thats next to Gollum and head up the next set of stairs. Continue along this path, slaying any Orc in your way. Once you see a green potion, grab it and exit to the left. *Checkpoint* After ascending the ladder, the timer comes back again. This is a much larger area then the last, so be quick with your kills. To the left after the bridge/ramp is a roof, lower the timer and continue on. Soon you'll come to a ladder, as you decend you'll see a Ranger get killed by a couple Orcs. Once you reach the bottom, follow the spiral stairs all the way up. Kill any Orc in your way, grab the red potion, then push the bell down the stairs. The bell will then break through debris, providing a new path. Slaughter the Orcs in your way, and run up to another roof area. The timer will appear again, right as you see a few poor suckers get nailed by siege fire. You can take your time killing here, as there is a small roof sheltering a green potion nearby. Be a little quicker through the next section though, lower the timer and continue on. At the end is a ladder, a very long ladder. Take it down to the next floor, ice the Orcs there and decend yet another ladder. You should now be in the sewers. After running through the first set of Orcs, you should see a Champion. Stay where you are and used your throwing knifes against the Archer. Once he's down, use your special ability to sneak around the the Champion's back. Now instantly kill him using your killing move. Take out any remaining Orcs, and open the gate to end the level. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: None. -Sam: Poison Blade, Cloak of Haldir. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3k. SHELOB'S LAIR ~The Path of the Hobbits~ [WLKK] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Sam This level is a small maze, and it's very easy to get lost in. To top that off there are spiders, large spiders, everywhere. They respawn fairly frequently, so if you backtrack, you'll run into them again. Final Judgment is more then effective on these spiders. However if your up against three or more, knock a couple on their backs before you start using Final Judgment. To start off, stick to the right path, all the way to it's end. Here you will find an experience slab, grab it and you will be ambused by three Spiders. Take them out, and backtrack to the start. Now take the left path, you should see a Spider run off to the left. Following it will lead you into a trap, go for some experince then return. Go right for a few steps and you will come to a large intersection. You should now be able to go either right, left, or straight. Head straight, and take the first right. Weave inbetween all the spiderlings for a green potion. A few steps down the path opposite of the green potion, Sam will get ambushed. Squash them and go right. You will find an Orc fending off a couple of Spiders, help him out, then kill him yourself. Go back to where you where last ambushed and take a left. You should see a couple torches, this is the way to the next section. First kill the three approaching Spiders, then run past the torches. Take the first right (up) you come across. Here is another experience slab, and predictably, another ambush. Once your done, return to the torches. Note: To get to the torches from the start, go left, right, straight (middle), second left, left. Use a torch to scatter the Spiderlings, and pass safely through them. Kill the three Spiders that drop down. Pick up the nearby torch, and throw it at the web. Once it stops burning, head through and you will see several Orcs huddled in the middle of the room. Go right and the camera switches, two Spiders will come from behind. Kill them, and grab the nearby torch. Target one of the cocoons, and watch the Orcs burn alive. Do the same with the next torch, and take out any survivors with the hot coals or the Orc Bane. Head over to the corridor on the far end. Bane the first two Orcs you come across, and walk around the bend. Grab the nearby torch and throw it at the coccoon hanging over the Orcs. You will come to another fork in the road, take the left path to a ridge overlooking a few Archers. Use your knifes or the torches to take them out, and return to the fork. Follow the right path around for a room with more Orcs. Ascend the ramp to the right, stop and grab the torch, and throw it at the coccoon. Once the fire is out, go and push the pile of boulders on the hapless Orcs below. As you approach the area that they were guarding, three Spiders come out to greet you. Destroy them and head through. *Checkpoint* As you cross the bridge, a few Orcs will come out from the other side. As they stand there and watch, grab the torch, and light up the coccoon. Fight your way through the next corridor, using torches to scatter the Spiderlings in the way. The end is blocked by a web, burn it and enter. Kill the next group of Spiders and Orcs. You'll then come to a large room, filled with pockets of Spiderlings. Ascend the right path, scattering Spiderlings and slaying any Spiders in the way. Once at the top, use the torch on the web, and decend the ramp. As you head through the pockets of Spiderlings, Orc archers will assult you from the exit. Use your knifes to take them out, and head through the last pocket of Spiderlings. Once at the end, after learning that three is never enough, four Spiders attack you, kill them, and continue up to the tunnel's exit. *Checkpoint* Boss: Shelob ------------ Use a combo to get her attention, and then parry her counter attack. Try to corner her, or she will make good use of her backstep. Once she has taken enough damage, she will retreat to a ledge and several Spiders will appear. Quickly take out the lone ones first, before attacking the group in the middle. Once her children are dead, she leaps at you from the ledge. If she misses she will be stunned after the landing, use this to get in a couple of cheap shots, then start exchanging combos. She will again retreat to her ledge, and have more Spiders attack you, do the same as last time. This time before returning to the ledge, she will start charging randomly around the area. Use your special ability, and she will again return to a ledge. Destory the next wave of Spiders, dodge her leap attack, and finish her off. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: None. -Sam: Cloud of Shadow, Poison Daggers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3l. CIRITH UNGOL ~The Path of the Hobbits~ [WLKL] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Sam As soon as you start, a counter appears in the upper right corner. Your goal here is to kill 80 enemies. The Orcs and Uruks are have a little brawl going, and will hardly notice you, that is until you stab them in their backs. Start off by using your cloak and backstabbing the Uruk Champion. Then take out the nearby Orcs using the Hot Coals and their Bane. Lower the nearby ramp. and kill the two Orcs that notice you. Continue along until the camera changes and take out the two charging Uruks. Head into the corridor. Quickly bane one of the Orcs and use the resulting perfect mode and your cloak to take out the nearby Champion. At the end of the corridor, you should have twelve kills. Note: Sam can't use the Bane of Sauron until level six. You will enter a large room with several fights going on. Use the spears on the nearby enemies then go down the steps. Kill the mob in front of you. Try to get into perfect and use the nearby coals. Ignore the fight off to the right, and enter the nearby corridor. Fight your way through. At the end is a small room with a large brawl going on. Bane the shielded Orc that notices you, then quickly knock over the coal basket, clearing the room. Pick up the green potion then exit on the other side, you should have around 35 kills. You'll come to yet another melee. Use you cloak and sneak around to the stairs on the other side. Fight your way up and enter the first exit. Use the Oil on a large group fighting down below for a nice 15+ kills. Continue up the stairs, and you'll encouter a Champion at the top, don't sneak attack him or use the spears. Instead take him out with strings of combos and try for perfect mode. Then immediately use the action button to cut the rope suspending the chandelier causing it to crash down on the melee below...all while in perfect mode. When you regain control, some Orcs start running up the stairs. Use the nearby coals to take 'em out. Now head back to the large room after the first corridor. Take out the Orcs if you need to, otherwise just run past. Keep heading right and you'll see another ramp. Hit the switch to lower it, killing half a dozen Orcs in the process. Run up the path, Bane the Uruk and push the barrel onto the Orcs below. If you didn't have 80 kills by now, you should. Head up the wodden ramp and you'll see a cutscene of the Orcs retreating. Head across the bridge, then up the steps to the Ballistae guarded by a Champion. Sneak attack him, then set off the Ballistae. Now enter the tower. Boss: Pissed off Orc -------------------- Damn did you see that drop kick? Anyway this guy is easy. Just pick a stack of spears and don't stop throwing them at him (they replenish faster then you can throw them). The first spear breaks his shield. The second spear stuns him. The rest thrown will hurt him. If your too slow he will pick up another shield, so you'll have to start over. After he kicks it, the level is over. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: None. -Sam: Cloak of Celeborn, Morgul Daggers, Halfling Strength. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3m. THE CRACK OF DOOM ~The Path of the Hobbits~ [WLKM] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Frodo Boss: Gollum ------------ Your regular attacks can't harm him, but they will cause him to backstep. Stand near the edge and parry his first attack. Then move around to his side and attack so he backsteps towards the edge. This will cause him to lose his balance. Quickly use your physical attack and he'll slip and grab the edge. Now use your killing move to make him fall. This only takes away a fifth of his life, but after each fall your given a red potion. After his second fall, boulders will start to rain down. After his third fall, lava will cover the ledge. After his forth fall, part of the ledge will break off (if your on it during the cutscene don't worry, you'll live). After his fifth fall, boulders and lava will rain onto the small platform, dodge these hazards and knock off Gollum for the last time. Recommended Upgrades: --------------------- -Fellowship: None. -Frodo: Poison Blade, Cloak of Haldir. *Game Over* Or is it? You've now unlocked three secret characters, some more interviews, a couple bonus stages(see below), some cheat codes, and are now able to use any character on any level in the game. Enjoy. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3n. PALANTIR OF SARUMAN ~The Palantirs~ [WLKN] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Playable Characters: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Faramir The Palantir of Saruman is a bonus stage unlocked after you beat 'The Crack of Doom'. It is an 'endurance' level, where your goal is to defeat twenty waves of various enemy groups. After each wave you are returned to the starting postion and given a red potion. This stage features many different types of enemies found in the different paths of the game. Some of these enemies have even doubled in size and are that much stronger. Good luck and godspeed! Note: Numbers are approximated.

The archers will still be firing at you, but will hopefully hit the melee enemies. * When facing a mixed wave of shielded/unshielded take out or break the shields first. If you don't your combos will constantly be broken up because you'll hit a shield. * When facing the groups of spiders, the combo Swift Justice will tear them apart. * If you start losing health when up against Champions, Don't use one of your saved potion(unless you really have to). Instead concentrate on killing the Champions as they will drop a potion. * Trolls have a wicked backhand, so either stick to short combos + backstep, or use ranged attacks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3o.

If you have the option, Bane an Easterling over an Uruk-hai. * When facing waves of unshielded melee attackers, the combo Swift Justice is your friend. * When facing waves of shielded melee attackers, the combo Helm's Hammer is your friend. * When facing waves of all archers, keep parrying (this will easily send you into perfect). When ever possible use a backstep and slowly inch over to a group of archers. After taking out a few groups, the wave is much easier. * When facing the mixed groups of Melee/Archers, keep some of the Melee attackers alive as you go from archer group to archer group. The archers will still be firing at you, but will hopefully hit the melee enemies. * When facing a mixed wave of shielded/unshielded take out or break the shields first. If you don't your combos will constantly be broken up because you'll hit a shield. * If you start losing health when up against Champions, Don't use one of your saved potion(unless you really have to). Instead concentrate on killing the Champions as they will drop a potion. * Trolls have a wicked backhand, so either stick to short combos + backstep, or use ranged attacks. ================================================================================ 4.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS [FAQS7] ================================================================================ Topics Covered: Game Help, Co-op, General. --------------------------- - GAME HELP --------------------------- Q: Who are the secret characters? A: Faramir, Merry, and Pippin. Q: How do I unlock them? A: Complete 'The Crack of Doom'. Q: How do I unlock Gollum/Smeagol? A: You can't. He was mentioned as a hidden character in a lot of previews, but never made the final cut. However, you can interact with him in a couple of stages. Q: How do I kill the second Mumakil(Elephant) on Pelennor Fields? A: You have to cross over to the other side in order to be in range. In between the second and last Ballistae(heading left) is a flag, and to the left of the flag is a path leading into the chasm. Cross the chasm and ascend the path on the other side. Now kill it just as you did the first. Q: How do I kill the Champion Orc in the sewers at the end of Escape From Osgiliath? A: Simple, just use your special ability(L1+R1+L2+R2) to turn invisible, then go around to the Champion's back and use your killing move (R2) for an instant kill. Q: What is the max character level? A: Twenty. Q: Do you get anything for reaching level twenty? A: No. Q: Is it better to buy upgrades for the Fellowship or just a single character? A: It is much more cost effective to purchase for the Fellowship, but purchasing for a single character can increase reply value. It's your call. Q: How do you get to 100%? I only have 87%/93%, what gives? A: You must complete every stage, including both Palantirs(bonus levels) at least once. Character level has NOTHING to do with it, beside unlocking the Palantir of Sauron. Q: I can't get the PS2 Cheat Codes to work, what's the deal? A: If your inputting the codes based on how you see them on the screen you could have just made a simple mistake. If you look at the d-pad on your PS2 control,notice how the arrows point inward and not outward. The in game screen copies this, so the 'up' arrow is actually down on the d-pad. If your still confused check the Cheat Codes section above, those are the correct codes. Q: What does the 'Targeting Indicator Mode' cheat code do? A: It will shade enemies who are about to attack you in a red hue. --------------------------- - CO-OP --------------------------- Q: What are the differences between Single Player and Co-op? A: -Some of the camera angles are different. -You are restricted to play 'The Path of the King' first. -There are no Checkpoints, instead you are given one life to share between each player. Q: How do I get past the crumbling bridge and into the tower at Cirith Ungol? A: Start running during the cutscene. Once you get to the bridge, cross it side by side, if you don't it will crumble behind the lead player, killing the one who trails. --------------------------- - GENERAL --------------------------- Q: Rent or buy? A: Rent. Although it's a good game, it probably won't take longer then four hours to complete. The bonus levels and unlockable characters can keep you busy for awhile. But don't buy if it's over 20$. Q: Which follows the books closer, the game or the movie? A: Surprisingly, at least in the parts it covers, the game. It has some scenes, like the Mouth of Sauron, and when Gandalf holds the gates of Minas Tirith alone, that where not in the movie. Q: Are there any interviews of Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), or John Rhys-Davies(Gimli)? A: No, not in this game. You can see their interviews in 'The Two Towers' game. Q: Who did the voice acting? A: The cast from the movies. Q: Why can't I select any characters other then Sam? A: You can't because the version of the game you ILLEGALLY DOWNLOADED is glitched. Buy or rent the game next time. Q: Is there a demo for this game? A: Sure is! For PC owners anyway(link is line breaked to fit format): http://www.eagames.com/official/lordoftherings/returnoftheking/us/editorial /game_demo.jsp?skin=default Q: How come your guide doesn't cover the GBA Return of the King? A: Because it is a completely different game. The PS2, GC, Xbox, and PC game are pretty much the same. ================================================================================ 8.
