        "meta_description": "It's like a hammer. When I first played this game, it was like a sledgehammer came down and smashed everything on screen to bits. Everything from the whiz of smoking arrows to the seemingly infinite particles bursting in air to the furious roar of Tree-ents tearing Saruman's damn down, to the omnipresent score ratcheting the tension of the moment to a higher level. When you finish the first level of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, your ears will ring, your eyes will flash and you'll want more. \r\n\r\nLord of the Rings: Return of the King, EA's second console venture using the license based on the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings, ramps up every aspect -- the gameplay, visuals, and sound -- and drives it home with an impressive punch. The hack-and-slash action game is still very much just that, a twitchy combo-fest derived from arcade sensibilities, but now it's surrounded by a superior level of production quality that cannot be mistaken, it's got co-op, and it's filled with interactive backgrounds and newly playable characters.",
