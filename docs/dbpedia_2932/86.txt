As with the first two chapters, Jackson's rendition of this Tolkien classic is astonishing. Every detail of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is just right, and from the struggles of three very small creatures to stay alive as they scale sheer rock to huge battles with hundreds of thousands of warriors, every moment is vivid, exciting, and moving. That means not just Middle Earth citadels, a giant spider, and thousands of phantom combatants, but also smaller moments of equal power. Sam and Gollum each try to make Frodo mistrust the other. There are villains, grotesque and powerful, weak and greedy. And there are heroes: loyal, brave, devoted, and honorable.

The tone of The Return of the King is epic and majestic, the battles brilliantly staged. But it's still all about the story. Characters learn and deepen. Even little Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) go from cute comic relief to genuine heroes. There's so much going on that some characters seem like not much more than cameos, especially Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchette). And the post-ending endings, after more than three hours, may seem a bit too much. But this is still an epic to satisfy both the most devoted Tolkien fans and viewers who are new to Middle Earth. In its own way, it's as thrilling an adventure in storytelling on film as the quest it portrays.
