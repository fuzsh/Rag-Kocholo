Syd of Valis, known in Japan as SD Valis (ＳＤヴァリス), is a Sega Mega Drive action game. A super-deformed remake of Telenet Japan's 1989 game Valis II, it was first released in Japan in February 1992[3]. When localized for its American release two months later[4], its title was erroneously interpreted as Syd of Valis, presumably read verbally by a member of the localization staff unfamiliar with Japanese culture.

Story

After defeating Rogles (in Valis), Yuko takes the train home and goes about her regular life, still carrying the Valis sword around. One afternoon while eating pudding, Yuko is contacted by the deceased Reiko, who insists that Yuko return to Queen Valia immediately.

In the opening cutscene, the evil Megas appears before Yuko while she is eating an ice cream cone and challenges her to come to Vecanti to defeat him. Yuko transforms her ice cream into the Valis sword, and the adventure begins.

Gameplay

The game is an action platformer similar to the other Valis titles. Yuko is moved with and and ducks with . She jumps with ; if not swinging the sword, she double-jumps with again while in the air. The physics are much floatier than in the other games. Yuko attacks by shooting projectiles with the Valis sword with , which can be aimed with the D-Pad while swinging the sword (including swinging straight up while standing or straight down while in the air). The button can be held for continuous fire. Yuko also has screen-clearing bombs that can be used with , which are limited but can be replenished by finding items.

The game has multiple selectable weapons and armor suits that can be switched by pausing the game with START . Additional weapons and armor are acquired from certain boss fights. Each weapon has a base attack power (A. Power) which is modified by the armor being used; each armor has a defense level (D. Power) and a speed statistic. Yuko's normal speed is 10; it can be raised to 15 (Yellow Armor or Super Armor) or 20 (Speed Suit) at the expense of control, especially when jumping, which can be a detriment in platforming-intensive areas. Each weapon can be powered up to Level 3 over the course of the game, which increases the size and damage of each shot.

Yuko's health is indicated by a health bar at the bottom of the screen. She loses a life if she runs out of health. Falling down a bottomless pit typically costs health rather than losing a life. Yuko's health can be replenished by finding items; defeating bosses also fully restores her health bar. Yuko gains additional health points after defeating certain bosses. The player is awarded an extra life every 5,000 points earned. The game ends if the player runs out of lives; there are no continues.

Weapons

Normal Beam A simple ball-shaped projectile is fired straight forward. Wide Beam Shoots an arrow-shaped blade that does slightly more damage than the Normal Beam. Homing Beam A star-shaped projectile seeks out near by enemies and damages them. It can sometimes become confused and circle enemies infinitely. 3-Way Beam Fires a projectile like the Normal Beam but in three directions (forward, up at 45 degrees, and down at 45 degrees).

History

A European release was planned by Ubisoft[10] but it did not materialise.

Legacy

Syd of Valis would be the last Valis title released on a Sega system; Telenet Japan ceased all Sega development in 1993, and later released Valis IV exclusively on the PC Engine and Super Famicom.

The game was re-released as part of Valis Collection by Retro-Bit in 2022. It was also re-released as part of Mugen Senshi Valis Collection II for the Nintendo Switch by Edia on the same year. Once again, it was released for Nintendo Switch again on stand-alone format in December 2022 on Japan and April 2023 in Americas and South Korea. Both re-releases on the system keeps the Sega logo at the startup.

Versions

Renovation Products brought the game to the US as Syd of Valis. While the box and instruction manual call the lead character Yuko, the game changes her name to Syd. The title screen is changed from SD Valis to Valis Syd, presumably a localization error. The US cover is taken from Sugoroku '92 Nari Tore Nariagari Trendy, a board game for the CD-ROM² by Laser Soft. It features a number of characters who not only do not appear in the game but are not related to the Valis universe at all with the exception of Yuko front and center. The other characters are from various Telenet properties, including Guy Kazama from Last Alert, Yu and Rim from the Cosmic Fantasy series, and Tetsuya from Super Albatross. Additionally, the "Game Over" screen and the credits are untranslated. The re-releases of the game on Nintendo Switch features new in-fly English translations in the Japanese ROM.
