The arcade games and racers were a lot of fun too: Virtua Cop, House of the Dead, Sega Rally, Sega Touring, and Manx TT Superbike. The Saturn was THE premier system for 2-D fighting games.

My granny had the Saturn, so I was thinking about both at the same time. Editing my OP\n\nfor the RPG fan these are great. Phantasy Star 2-4, Shining in the Darkness. Might and Magic, A Faery Tale adventure. For more action oriented rpgs, get Crusader of Centy, Wonder boy. For the strategy rpg fans there is the shining force series, Warsong, and King's Bounty. For action fans however there's a huge delight as the genesis is known for action. Classics like Streets of rage, sonic, boogerman, beavis and butthead, Herzog Zwei, Castlevania, Contra, Gunstar Heroes, Gain Ground, Valis, El Viento and so many more.\n\nMy necessities are listed like this\n\nWarsong\n\nPhantasy Star 2-4\n\nShining Force 1-2\n\nContra\n\nCastlevania\n\nGunstar Heroes\n\nMutant League Football\n\nNHL 93\n\nOMG! Paco, I love you!!\n\nI had The Faery Tale Adventure on my Amiga Commodore 600 when I was a wee thing. My mother gave it to Goodwill when I was in HS (because she thought I didn't want it) and I thought I was doomed to never be able to play it again!\n\nI am so happy now, though I miss my Amiga and the 100s of games I had for it, this is a great day! I sense a reason to set my Genesis up again XD Thank you!"
