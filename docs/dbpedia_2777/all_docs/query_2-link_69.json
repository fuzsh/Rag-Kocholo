        "text": "The publisher Retro-Bit has announced today (20th October) that it will rerelease the three Valis games (Valis: The Fantasm Soldier, Syd of Valis, and Valis III) both individually and as part of a collection, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.\n\nThe three games follow the Japanese schoolgirl Yuko Asou who is chosen to wield the legendary sword, Valis, and become a great warrior to protect the three realms. Telenet Japan created the series in 1986 on Japanese personal computers and it has since gone on to receive many ports and sequels.\n\nThe original game and Valis III were ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. The second game, meanwhile, received its port one year later, in 1992. This version of the game, dubbed Syd of Valis, came with a drastically altered art style that was more \"chibi-like\" in nature.\n\nRetro-Bit's collection will contain a master slipcase and an acrylic stand featuring a trio of characters (Yuko, Valna, and Cham) from Valis III. Each game will also have a replica Genesis/Mega Drive clamshell, with a reversible cover, an art card, a full-colored manual, and a number to prove its authenticity. These cartridges will fit any North American Genesis or PAL Mega Drive, as well as similar third-party machines.\n\nSomething that is important to note is that this Retro-Bit release is entirely unrelated to the Valis collection previously released for Nintendo Switch. It also won't come with a download code, being a physical-only product.\n\nPre-orders open today and will stay that way until November 11th, 2022. If you want the full collection, it will set you back roughly $144.99 / €169.99, while the individual games will cost you around $49.99 / €64.99 each. In Europe, you'll be able to pre-order it from Strictly Limited Games, DragonBox Shop, Spel o Sant, while North Americans should head to Castlemania Games or Limited Run Games\n\nDo you plan to pick up this collection? Let us know in the comments!"
