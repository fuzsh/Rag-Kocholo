        "text": "Post by Ex on\n\nA lot of us have played (or still play) classic computer platforms, such as Apple II, Commodore 64, or Amiga. Famous PC platforms which had western releases. But what of the PC platforms of the far east? How much time have you spent with the PC88, PC98, MSX, MSX2, FM7, FM Towns, X68000, and more? Only in recent years have I begun to explore the vast ocean of Japanese retro PC gaming. Every instance has been interesting, and many times rewarding as well. Sure there's droves of untranslated eroge, yet many quality platformers, shmups, and puzzlers lie in wait. So what's your experience with this type of retro gaming? Do you have any classic Japanese PC games you'd recommend?\n\nI'll come back later and post my own experiences.\n\nPost by anayo on\n\nMy 2001 XBOX is what I use for Sharp X68000 and PC98 emulation. Sharp X68000 looks so cool to me. It's like they combined the luscious graphics of a Super NES with the rockin' FM synth of a Sega Genesis. I've only played a stage or two in Akumajou Dracula and Geograph Seal, though - no complete playthroughs yet. Once I'm farther along with my Sega Genesis backlog I definitely want to spend more time with this.\n\nI'm not as sure if I like the PC98 yet. I mainly got it for Rusty, but from what I can tell the PC98 wasn't really designed to handle lots of dynamic sprites whizzing around like Sega and Nintendo, so action games seem to have mediocre frame rates. Everything I've heard indicates it was better suited to rendering high resolution, static graphics that just sit still and look pretty. Consequently the best genre on there is point and click adventures like Policenauts. While I intend to play the Policenauts fan translation for Sega Saturn, I'm not enamored with the genre. I tried completing Snatcher on my Sega CD and fizzled out around the 60% - 70% mark. Which PC98 games are supposed to be the best? I haven't conducted much in-depth research for myself yet.\n\nPost by Ex on\n\nSharp X68000 looks so cool to me. It's like they combined the luscious graphics of a Super NES with the rockin' FM synth of a Sega Genesis.\n\nThat's a very keen way to describe the X68000, I can get behind that description. PLAY AQUALES\n\nWhich PC98 games are supposed to be the best?\n\nI've only beaten Night Slave (mecha shooter platformer) and Rusty (Castlevania inspired). But I've heard good things about:\n\n46 Okunen* (EVO on SNES was a sequel to this)\n\nBelloncho Body Inspection* (ecchi RPG)\n\nBrandish 3 (hardcore dungeon crawler)\n\nCRW Metal Jacket* (mecha strategy)\n\nFarland Story series* (action RPG)\n\nHayate The Battle (fighter)\n\nMacross Skull Leader* (sci-fi space strategy)\n\nMarble Cooking* (ecchi puzzler)\n\nReserve (ecchi board game)\n\nReserve 1/2 (ecchi board game)\n\nYugekitai ~ Saikyoushin Fukkatsu no Maki ~* (adventure)\n\nYugekitai Kakuto Hen 1 ~ Saikyoushin Fukkatsu no Maki ~* (fighter)\n\n*Has English fan translation.\n\nSarge is right the PC88/98 were designed as business computers, and their OS interfaces were optimized for menu based applications. This is why the Japanese adventure game genre became menu based.\n\nPost by bonesnapdeez on\n\nThe Farland games are awesome, though you're all probably better off playing the later console titles. Oh, these are turn-based SRPGs, not ARPGs.\n\nI like these Japanese computers quite a bit, though the obscene obscurity of all of the hardware and software is disheartening. You pretty much have to go full emulation, though MSX stuff can be found fairly easily if you wanna pony up the cash.\n\nI am fortunate to own an MSX. This is the most similar to a Western computer of the era. It looks like a fat keyboard, and takes carts (+ disks and cassettes with addition drive attachments). Note that all complex games are on the MSX2. The MSX1 library is similar to black label NES, SG-1000, etc. with some oddball simple RPGs thrown into the mix (I have Hydlide II and Dragon Quest). I dig it.\n\nOne thing I was lucky enough to find for \"cheap\" last year for the PC was the Dragon Slayer Chronicle. This contains (officially) emulated versions of these classic PC-88, PC-98, and MSX2 RPGs. Pretty rad.\n\nPost by Ex on\n\nthese are turn-based SRPGs, not ARPGs\n\nI was misinformed!\n\nI am fortunate to own an MSX.\n\nNice. I've seen lots of good looking MSX 1 & 2 games lately. Stuff like:\n\nAshGuine Story II\n\nBuster\n\nChubby Gristle\n\nFray\n\nGolvellius II\n\nKing's Valley II\n\nKnightmare III\n\nM36 A Life Planet\n\nSD Snatcher\n\nSilviana\n\nSofia\n\nThe Maze of Galious\n\nTrantor - The Last Stormtrooper\n\nTreasure of the Usas\n\nValis II\n\nWar of the Dead\n\nWar of the Dead 2\n\nXak I, III, III\n\nPost by dunpeal2064 on\n\nI have really only messed around with PC98 stuff personally, but I find all of it fascinating. As someone who grew up far away from PC gaming, the stuff here looks (obviously) much more in line with what I grew up loving.\n\nMy experience is still pretty low, though. I've played the 5 Touhou games for the PC98, and I remember trying out some cheeky RPG that Bone mentioned at some point (Knights of Xentar? Something like that). I would love to dig into this stuff more asap, assuming I can get everything set up correctly."
