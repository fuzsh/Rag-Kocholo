        "text": "Be sure to check out my previous entries in the Retro Gaming Club, where I write short preview posts on three retro games I played that month. Oftentimes I havenâ€™t played them before. so it can be a fresh experience for me. I also want to highlight older games and give them a little spotlight for you to check them out as well.\n\nRiver City Ransom: 1989, NES ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ® out of ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®\n\nIf you read my previous Retro Gaming Club post, I wrote a little about Double Dragon II. I canâ€™t remember where but I read that River City Ransom was an inspiration for that game, so I was looking forward to giving it a try. Well, it definitely is similar to Double Dragon, but it has RPG elements in that you can improve your stats, buy items, collect money, and fight bosses. The story isnâ€™t that complicated, you are out to beat up some street gangs to clean up the city and save Ryan (one of the main characters) girlfriend.\n\nThe beatâ€™em up style is fun and challenging, as enemies will go right up to you and bash you with weapons. They donâ€™t hold back, and if you arenâ€™t fast you will be easily overtaken so make sure your ready! I noticed that sometimes they would rush me from a corner of the screen so it was tough to dodge them. If your playing on the Nintendo Switch like I was, then you can review or save your game with ease. If not, thereâ€™s a password system you can use.\n\nI havenâ€™t beat this one yet, but I do recommend it if you like games like Streets of Rage, Final Fight, and the NES era. It is not a short game, and there are lots of places to explore as you wander around but itâ€™s interesting to see since itâ€™s based in Japan. Overall, I recommend this one but be in for a challenge.\n\nWatch the full playthrough here.\n\nSuper Valis IV: 1991, SNES ðŸŽ® out of ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®\n\nWhen I look through the library of games available from the NES or SNES era on the Nintendo Switch, I like trying out games that look a little different. The box art isnâ€™t familiar nor have heard of the game before, so those are the ones I would rather play so I can see what Iâ€™ve missed out on. Super Valis IV is definitely not your average SNES game, mainly because of itâ€™s difficulty and odd plot. Itâ€™s about a warrior named Lena who seeks out to stop the king of evil spirits from controlling the world. Somehow the moon has something to do with this, but Iâ€™m not sure so I wonâ€™t try to figure this out.\n\nItâ€™s a side-scrolling platform game where you fight enemies with a sword and projectiles you can collect in each stage. Each projectile is different but they run out, except your main one so use them when in a pinch or during the boss fights. The bosses can be painfully hard to beat, or a breeze, so get ready to be frustrated. If I had rented this game when renting was around, I would never have been able to complete this one. Iâ€™m still stuck on a boss where he flies around and your stuck on a small platform. He appears on different sides of the platform but heâ€™s so fast and there isnâ€™t much space to move that heâ€™s hard to avoid.\n\nI donâ€™t know if I will be going back to this one, but if you havenâ€™t played it yet, give it a try to see how far you can get or if you can get through it all and let me know.\n\nWatch the full playthrough here.\n\nWrecking Crew: NES/Famicom, 1985 ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ® out of ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®\n\nI did not know that there was a Mario game that I had not played, especially one so old! Wrecking Crew starts off with Mario who is dropped off in various levels, or phases, where you have to destroy various objects like walls or ladders to complete the stage. If you are touched by various enemies that chase you around then you lose a life, but itâ€™s not that difficult to avoid them.\n\nIâ€™ve played through several levels already but when you turn on the game, I noticed you can select all the way up to phase 100, and I donâ€™t see myself playing this for that long. Itâ€™s fun and can get tricky to figure out how to get to the objects to wreck, but itâ€™s definitely an arcade game that is meant for you to play for long periods of times and use quarters to finish the game.\n\nCheck this one out if you want to see one of Marioâ€™s first games. Just be careful of those little blue suckers, they will chase you all over the place!\n\nWatch the full playthrough here."
