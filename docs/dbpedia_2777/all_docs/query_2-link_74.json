        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nxxcoolsjxx\n\n60%Sega Mega Drive/Genesis\n\nLike I've seen with some other reviews, this game had potential for sure, but just came out mediocre. A pretty basic sidescroller where different sword upgrades send out different type of beam attacks. Movement is similar to the old Castlevania where your character can only move at a walking pace, while bosses can fly around the screen. I liked the whole upgrade system that reminded me something like Gradius where you stack certain upgrades to gain some good weapons. The game is pretty simple and easy, spells aren't balanced all that great, best the game in just over an hour probably.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nPrivate\n\n20%NES\n\nHonestly this would have had massive potential to uproot Castlevania (its upgrade system is pretty neat), but failed to do so for several reasons:\n\n1) godawful level design that is immediately apparent on the first level but only gets progressively worse (you pretty much have to watch hisatoki's video to know what to do - reading the one admittedly detailed guide on GameFAQs will still leave you scratching your head)\n\n2) bizarre running physics (made worse on the ice level)\n\n3) absurd respawn rates\n\n4) excessively bullet-hell bosses (just the snake one, really)\n\nShareCompleted\n\nArino4u\n\n60%Sega Mega Drive/Genesis\n\nIt's a fun little game, I like that it's easily beatable in one sitting. At the same time though, I'd be way less forgiving of it's flaws if it was longer than an hour and half. The level designs don't feel all that interesting, they mostly just boil down to walking right and firing a few shots at whatever enemy pops up without much challenge. Still though, there is something weirdly compelling about it even though it's sorta shitty. I'm excited to check out the other games in the Valis series because I think there's some potential in this game that just didn't really shine through in this first entry. Overall though it's a fun way to spend an afternoon.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nsupah_mama_luigi\n\n60%TurboGrafx-CD\n\nthe interesting thing about this game is the fact that its difficulty is strange. the level design and enemy placement is much like ninja gaiden, but the movement is more like a classic castlevania game. if either of those games arent your jam, then I would steer clear of this one. The difficulty is like not so hard that you want to give up, but definitely hard enough that you get irritated. plot was generic and girls are girls"
