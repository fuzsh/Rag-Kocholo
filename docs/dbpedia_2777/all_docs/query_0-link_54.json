        "text": "Once a proud example of action/platforming that could tell a story, the Valis series has since deteriorated into a mockery of its former self, like a beauty queen turned crack whore. However, long before it went Hentai, Valis began its downward slide with a game that proved Telenet simply no longer cared. This is what we got instead of a true Valis II port…\n\nWhat better way to begin 2012 than with another installment of Reader Roundtable? For over five years, we’ve been gathering the monthly play accounts of our staff and readers and letting them share with everyone. It’s a great way to see what we like and what games we may have missed, and this year is no different.\n\nStallone has more than a couple of games on the Genesis, and they all range widely in quality, just like his movies. Some, like Rambo III, are quite good, and others initially seem horrible but warm up to you the more you play them. Cliffhanger fits neatly into the second category. It doesn’t really t make any effort to stand out among 16-bit beat-’em-ups, good or bad.\n\nSome great news about Sonic (trust us, it’s actually good news!), more updates from WaterMelon Group, and Genesis games on the Sony PS Vita! This installment of MEGA Bites has some great info you, so come on in and see what’s been on the Genesis grapevine for the past few weeks.\n\nSega did a great job porting Data East’s arcade shooter, and Darwin 4081 is sure to offer a decidedly different take on space shooters for those who think they’ve seen it all. This Japan-only import sports some solid gameplay and an interesting weapons system, and while it’s not the best shmup around, it’s one that’s worth checking out."
