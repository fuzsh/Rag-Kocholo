        "text": "So following the announcement of the Mega Drive Mini 2 Friday morning, I’ve pretty much only been thinking about it, lol. I managed to snag a console this morning, so now I’ve at least got no worries about having one of these in my hands (provided Amazon Japan didn’t sell more than they get, lol). So with that in mind, and knowing a little more about the intentions of the device, I’d like to do as I tend to do and speculate what else might show up on here.\n\nA quick recap of the first 11 games:\n\nBonanza Bros.\n\nFantasy Zone (brand new port of the arcade game, considered a bonus)\n\nMagical Tarurūto-kun\n\nMansion of Hidden Souls (CD)\n\nPopful Mail (CD)\n\nShining Force CD\n\nShining in the Darkness\n\nSilpheed (CD)\n\nSonic CD\n\nThunder Force IV\n\nVirtua Racing\n\nOther perimeters that we know of: there’s over 50 total games included with bonuses, 20 CD games were added, there’s nothing from the 32X on here, and the goal is to make this one for fans of the system in Japan first and foremost and pull out the stops to cater to that audience. We also know three third parties outside of Sega and M2 featured on here: Game Arts (aka Gung-Ho Entertainment), Nihon Falcom, and Game Freak.\n\nThe first games I want to mention are several of the ones I brought up when the Genesis Mini was about to released (with a couple updates since I wrote that three years ago):\n\nHerzog Zwei\n\nTechnosoft’s cult classic joined the Sega Ages line for the Switch as its last title, but its early and commanding attempt at real-time strategy would be a great addition to the Mini 2, especially since it fulfills the “fan-driven” mentality going into the MDM2.\n\nBare Knuckle 3 (Streets of Rage 3)\n\nBare Knuckle 3 was a far fairer experience than the rental-adverse localization that we got over here. Plus I’d love to see the localization changes beyond the difficulty…as I’m all about that, haha. I’d be surprised if this didn’t show up.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3/& Knuckles\n\nSpeaking of sequels, arguably the biggest omission on the Mini was Sonic’s third outing. I’m on record saying I’m not much of a fan, but it’s SONIC 3 & KNUCKLES. It’s like the definition of the Sega Genesis, haha. With Sonic Origins bringing it back, I imagine it’ll be a given to be included alongside Sonic CD.\n\nRocket Knight Adventures and Sparkster\n\nOne game well regarded and loved from the 16-bit era remained elusive from all regional versions of the original Genesis Mini — Rocket Knight Adventures, the bombastic action/platformer from Konami. I hope this time, seeing how big of a fanbase it has and Sega’s eye for appealing to those fans, it’ll come to pass. Sparkster would be a nice bonus!\n\nShining Force II\n\nWith Shining Force CD and Shining in the Darkness featured, may as well go all in and fill in the missing link of the series on the Genesis and get II on there as well.\n\nBattle Mania and Battle Mania: Daiginjō\n\nThe Battle Mania series is one I’m curious to test out after reading Kid Fenris discuss them in detail on his blog, and given the muddiness of Vic Tokai’s back catalog, it might be impossible for either title to get a rerelease. However, these are exactly the sort of games I’d expect Sega to try to sort out to get on here. Borrowing a fair amount of inspiration from Capcom’s Forgotten Worlds, it is also unafraid of throwing shade at Nintendo, which seems to fit the 16-bit wars well in my opinion, haha.\n\nEl Viento\n\nNihon Telenet is a bit of a fascinating publisher, best known for the Valis series. Among their history sits the Earnest Evans series, a very experimental set of games that played around with large sprites and somewhat unorthodox gameplay ideas, and El Viento might be the most polished of the lot. And it’s another action game starring a woman! With Edia taking ownership of the IP recently, the odds have definitely improved to include this!\n\nGauntlet IV\n\nThis is a licensing headache of infinite proportions; we’d have to go to Warner Bros Interactive, current owners of Midway and Tengen/Atari Games’ back catalog, ask for permission to reissue a game they had no hand in making, and see if some magic happens. We haven’t seen a proper re-release of Midway’s games since last gen, so I don’t think WB is in a hurry to play ball here…but Sega did mention that they were thinking about it for the original MDM, and since this is a true fan’s version of the machine’s catalog, and it’s M2’s first game…so who knows?\n\nLangrisser\n\nThe turn-based strategy title Langrisser, localized as Warsong, would be a novel inclusion just to have a more direct competitor to Fire Emblem’s style of gameplay, especially with the sequel already on the original MDM. It would be nice to see where it all started!\n\nSo, those original pulls put us at 22 games. We have another 30ish slots to consider! What a wild ride this system could be! So before we get into the 15 additional Sega CD hopefuls, let’s talk about 17 other Genesis carts I’d personally like to see on top of what I’ve mentioned already:\n\nPhantasy Star II\n\nI feel the first proper Phantasy Star on the Mega Drive should get props on the MDM2, and seeing that sequels are on the docket here, I’d be surprised if it wasn’t. PSIII is also a possibility, but it’s the least liked of the trio, so I wouldn’t be too shocked if it gets skipped over.\n\nBare Knuckle (Streets of Rage)\n\nI also think the original Bare Knuckle has decent odds making it onto here, seeing that it’s one of Sega’s strongest trilogies on the system.\n\nBio-Hazard Battle\n\nThere’s a surprising number of shooters on the Mega Drive, so I’ve grabbed a variety of them from Sega and third parties to be included. It’s a popular niche genre and it’s one that thrived on the Mega Drive’s speedier processor. BHB is one of Sega’s earlier efforts and a solid take from what I could see.\n\nWhip Rush\n\nWhip Rush comes a little later down the road and has some nice parallax scrolling from what I’ve seen, plus cool box art, haha. It’s also not seen much in rereleases, so this is an ideal platform for it.\n\nArrow Flash\n\nThe last one of these from Sega, Arrow Flash has some fancy cutscenes to spice up the story, and would make a nice addition as well.\n\nPulseman\n\nGame Freak’s action game actually saw physical release in Japan (it was only offered on the Sega Channel here in the States) and seeing that another title of theirs is already on the MDM2, this seems like a given to me.\n\nShin Souseiki Ragnacenty (Crusader of Centy)\n\nThis obscure action RPG is quite good I’ve heard, but rare in all regions. Sounds like the ideal sort of game to toss onto the MDM2.\n\nGley Lancer\n\nA superb shoot-em-up from Masaya with stunning visuals, anime-influenced cutscenes and a banging soundtrack, I feel this is almost a given to include on here.\n\nBurning Force\n\nA behind-the-back shooter from Namco, this one gained more notoriety on the Genesis/Mega Drive than in arcades I feel, and would be a nice get for the MDM2.\n\nSplatterhouse 3\n\nIf Sega is willing to wade into the M-rated pool for this machine, Namco’s gory Splatterhouse sequels are both worthy additions, but I’m going to put down the third as I’ve heard it’s the most dynamic in terms of gameplay and mechanics as my pick. Although if the original is anything to go by, I may be too grossed out to play it, lol.\n\nZero Wing\n\nThe meme legend (“All Your Base…”) is actually from this solid shoot-em-up from Toaplan, and of all of their potential Mega Drive ports this one seems most fitting because of its pop culture status.\n\nValis\n\nWhile not quite the same game as the MSX/PC-88 original, this is closer in scope with some gameplay tweaks and spells earned from bosses. With Edia now in charge of the IP and this version of the game popping up in their second Valis collection, it’s not too wild to suspect it would be included on the MDM2 as well.\n\nGaiares\n\nAnother Nihon Telenet title, this is a cult classic shoot-em-up that is best known here in the States for its goofy ad campaign. With a recent cartridge reproduction and it popping up on the Evercade Revolution collection, this seems possible for a MDM2 slot.\n\nSuper Street Fighter II\n\nMost of Capcom’s better known ports are already on the MDM, and there hasn’t been a lot of fighters appearing on my list, so I may as well dump this here to try to represent the genre. I don’t expect Mortal Kombat, SNK ports or Eternal Champions sequels to show up on the MDM2…\n\nPanorama Cotton\n\nThis unique Cotton sequel recently got a revival on modern platforms, and Sega and Success already collaborated on the Astro City Mini, so it doesn’t seem outside the realm of possibility for this to show up.\n\nTwinkle Tale\n\nWhen I read that the MDM2 is aiming for “true fans” of the system, I looked at some games I’m far less familiar with to see what would be considered rare or hard to find, and Twinkle Tale was such a game. An overhead KiKi KaiKai style shooter with a fantasy vibe, this is a extremely difficult game to come across physically thanks to the publisher backing out of the industry after its initial release. Seeing as it’s among the rarest Mega Drive carts in Japan, I would think this might have some reasonable possibility if Sega could find out who owns the IP nowadays.\n\nYs III: Wanderers from Ys\n\nNihon Falcom had several of their games ported to the Mega Drive, and Ys III is perhaps the best known…so I picked it over a couple others.\n\nNow for those Sega CD games…15 more I’d like to see join alongside the five we already know of:\n\nSwitch (Panic!)\n\nThis is a weird experimental minigame sort of thing from Sega, and has a cult following from what I understand…so it screams MDM2 material, haha.\n\nDark Wizard\n\nA tactical RPG from Sega that foregoes a lot of the Mega CD conventions of lavish unskippable cutscenes in favor of using the extended memory to make dynamic multi-unit battles, this seems like a solid possibility to me to include.\n\nShin Megami Tensei\n\nSince Sega owns Atlus, why not toss in this enhanced port of the Super Famicom classic?\n\nKeio Flying Squadron\n\nThis is a dream get, as Victor Entertainment’s involvement with games is limited, but to me this is one of those essential Sega CD titles and a cult legend in the cute-em-up genre, so I am hoping Sega works their magic to make this appear on the MDM2.\n\nLunar The Silver Star\n\nLunar: Eternal Blue\n\nWith Silpheed already confirmed, I just HAVE to include Lunar and Lunar 2 from Game Arts. They are the most well known and beloved JRPGs on the Sega CD, and it would be shocking if neither of them made it.\n\nVay\n\nDeveloped by Hertz and published by SIMS, a collab between Sega and Sanritsu (and now operating independently), I feel that this JRPG would be an interesting obscurity to snag for the MDM2.\n\nEarnest Evans\n\nYes I’m going a little heavy on Nihon Telenet games, but this is an amazing opportunity to capture a lot of these interesting curios previously lost to licensing hell and only recently revived via Edia to not consider them. To me, I saw Revolution ads all the time for Wolfteam’s trio of action games, shooters and more, and I want to give them a shot. Earnest Evans is related to El Viento and the Sega CD version has some better sound and visuals, so I’d go with this one.\n\nAnnet Futatabi\n\nAnd to round out the trilogy, the second Annet title (this time named after her!) would be a cool curio as I don’t believe it’s seen as much love as the other two.\n\nCosmic Fantasy Stories\n\nThis is a bundle of two PC Engine RPGs, with enhanced graphics and music. And I’m all for seeing more RPGs!\n\nSol-Feace\n\nThe last of the Telenet titles I’ll be spotlighting, this is one of Wolf Team’s better shooter efforts and would be a great inclusion.\n\nTime Gal\n\nTaito’s answer to Dragon’s Lair isn’t quite as stunning to look at on the Mega CD, but it’s definitely one of the early standouts showing what the hardware was capable of and would be a nice break in the shooter/RPG/action game well I’ve mostly been focusing on.\n\nSnatcher\n\nAs much as I grumble about Hideo Kojima around here, I can’t deny his influence on the medium, and Snatcher might be one of his greatest achievements. The Sega CD version is the one more Americans are familiar with, and would be a fantastic get if possible.\n\nFinal Fight CD\n\nCapcom didn’t produce any Mega CD titles themselves, but Sega did port over their important beat-em-up pioneer Final Fight to the system, almost as if to outclass the Super Nintendo effort. With two player, a Redbook soundtrack and unique cutscenes, this would be quite a fascinating experience.\n\nDenin Aleste\n\nSince MUSHA made it onto the original MDM, let’s toss in another Aleste title, but this time for the Mega CD, Denin Aleste. It looks incredible!\n\nShadowrun\n\nThe Japanese MDM included the very last game released on the Mega Drive, Compile’s Madō Monogatari I, so I think it would be fitting to include the very last Mega CD game, Compile’s own take on the Shadowrun IP from FASA (which would require some licensing, of course). Drastically different from Sega and Data East’s spins on the IP, it screams out “MDM2” to me.\n\nWhew! That’s a lot! I’d be happy seeing any of these show up, and I imagine several will! I’ll be posting updates on the lineup as Sega releases more details, so stay tuned!"
