        "text": "Before Sonic took off the Genesis was not super hot in the US, and it's competition, released around the same time, was Nec and their Turbografx-16.\n\nHowever the Genesis pulled ahead by a good amount even before Sonic. Letting Sega grab the vacuum that was the teenager/young adult demographic for themselves and setting the stage for it's bounce. Leading it to have great third party support later.\n\nBut NEC clearly had the better game line up and screens in mags. It's crazy how pre Sonic Sega some how beat the TG16 early library.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nTG16 early pre Sonic US lineup:\n\nAlien Crush\n\nBlazing Lasers\n\nKeith Courage\n\nChina Warrior\n\nDungeon Explorer\n\nR-type\n\nLegendary Axe 1 and 2\n\nMonster Lair (Wonder Boy III enhanced remake)\n\nJack Nick's Turbo Golf\n\nKlax\n\nSpace Harrier\n\nJJ and Jeff\n\nBonks Adventure\n\nNeutopia\n\nYS book 1+2\n\nCyber Core\n\nBloody Wolf\n\nDouble Dungeons\n\nSplatter House\n\nBravoman\n\nTiger Road\n\nDevil's Crush\n\nNinja Spirit\n\nDragon's Curse\n\nLast Alert\n\nValis II\n\nBomberman\n\nAero Blasters\n\nSuper Star Soldier\n\nGenesis pre Sonic US lineup:\n\nAltered Beast\n\nMs Pacman\n\nSuper Thunder Blade\n\nGhouls n ghosts\n\nThunder Force II\n\nSuper Hang-on\n\nBurning Force\n\nRevenge of Shinobi\n\nGolden Axe\n\nPhantasy Star II\n\nHerzog Zwei\n\nAfter Burner II\n\nSuper Hydlide\n\nColumns\n\nAtomic Robokid\n\nMichael Jackson's moon walker\n\nInspector X\n\nStrider\n\nThunder Force III\n\nCastle of illusion mickey mouse\n\nCyberball.\n\nAs you can witness, The Genesis got torn to shreds, with such fun and varied games that have in most cases, greater polish.\n\nI am still baffled that even before Sonic, Sega managed to stay around 1 million units in front of NEC and the Turbo.\n\nMs pacman was the best selling Genesis game next to Altered Beast before Sonic, maybe that brought in older casuals or was a game parents shared with kids. But that would only explain some of the gap.\n\nWhich console do you think had the best pre-Sonic library (1989-early 91) in the US?\n\nImo, Sega was just demolished. It's not even fare. Poor NEC, such injustice in the US market.\n\nEven if you knew nothing about either line up, a quick \"genesis best games\" and \"turbo grafx 16 games\" searches would tell you all you need to know. The majority of the best tg16 games when you search came out in the 80's, majority of the best genesis games came out in the early/mid 90's.\n\nEh, the Turbo CDs most popular games were in the 90's so I guess it depends on if you combine both or separate hucard games.\n\nTurbo if you ask me. Few really great Genesis games are from the 80s.\n\nGenesis/Mega Drive is really weird, it released in 88 but that's not ingrained into everyone's mind, most people will tell you that the console launched around the same time as SFC/SNES.\n\ni got mine in 1989.\n\nI love both of these libraries but I played much more Revenge of Shinobi, Castle of Illusion, Strider and (especially) Ghouls n Ghosts at the time.\n\nWhy ask the question if your entire angle seems like you're trying to prove that the Genesis library was inferior? Both libraries had a lot to offer and even early on had bona fide classics.\n\nSega had a very aggressive marketing campaign. It was everywhere and all of my friends knew about it. The TG16 was like the Sega Master System of the 16-bit era awareness-wise (not software-wise).\n\nMarketing and retail distribution was more important than you perhaps realize. They didn't have the internet and YouTube videos back then and no one would have any idea what games were available, if they were any good, or even where to get them.\n\nMy experience at that time was most Genesis owners bought the system for sports games which you entirely ignored.\n\nMarketing and retail distribution was more important than you perhaps realize.

And both systems had them near even when they did. Also TG16 had near equal coverage.\n\nThe list of Genesis games in the OP is woefully incomplete.\n\nWikipedia lists 85 Genesis games that precede Sonic's North American release: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sega_Genesis_games\n\nwhile the OP only lists about 20. Why?\n\nWhy aren't you asking me why I didn't list \"every\" TG16 game too? Why only Sega?\n\nI said in the OP \"some examples\" not \"every game\" lol. I typed this thread on a phone. Tough enough to get the current lists out.lol.\n\n(Also wiki isn't a good source there's missing games for both )\n\nI had a TG16 and immediately regretted it when the Genesis launched.\n\nIn the US at least I thought it was no contest and much preferred the console and games from Sega. The Genesis was really a step forward graphically when it launched.\n\nHell for a 1988 console it was able to compete the snes for a while and got support up to what, 1996-1997? I rembember lots of people thought the genesis was new when Sonic came out in 1991. Goes to show it was still 'fresh' graphically.\n\nA console full of nice experiments too from many developers.\n\nHell for a 1988 console it was able to compete the snes for a while and got support up to what, 1996-1997? I rembember lots of people thought the genesis was new when Sonic came out in 1991. Goes to show it was still 'fresh' but graphically.\n\nA console full of nice experiments too from many developers.\n\nI am not sure if it was really a perfect port but stuff like Altered Beast and Ghouls and Ghosts looked arcade perfect to me when I first see it.\n\nThe TG16 could not compete with that. At least I didn't think so as a kid.\n\nThe double-spacing of the lists in the OP bothers me. As does the exclusion of Bonanza Bros, which I'd legitimately take over anything named here.\n\nBonanza Bros fans unite.\n\nIt's one of those games that superficially looks like shit? Or like...you can just LOOK at it and tell that it isn't any fun.\n\nBut it is a lot of fucking fun. Man, that's an IP Sega really needs to revisit.\n\nI am not sure if it was really a perfect port but stuff like Altered Beast and Ghouls and Ghosts looked arcade perfect to me when I first see it.\n\nThe TG16 could not compete with that. At least I didn't think so as a kid.\n\nSplatterhouse and Galaga 88/90 are great, and we're very good conversions for the time.\n\nHell for a 1988 console it was able to compete the snes for a while and got support up to what, 1996-1997? I rembember lots of people thought the genesis was new when Sonic came out in 1991. Goes to show it was still 'fresh' graphically.\n\nA console full of nice experiments too from many developers.\n\nThe one-two punch of Sega of America's 1991 marketing campaign and the release of Sonic the Hedgehog is a very particular inflection point in history that I think back to fairly often. It was almost like a \"stealth relaunch\" of the Genesis, which up until then wasn't much more than a curiosity with extremely little mindshare in the general public. They just went all out on multiple fronts at the same time: blockbuster mascot platformer, $50 price cut, and over-the-top ad campaign all during the tail end of '91.\n\nLike I know I wasn't the only one out of my peers who tried out both Sonic and Mario World on public demo kiosks at about the same time, and did a double-take when I'd look at their respective systems' software catalogs and think \"wait, the Sega already has 100 games?\"\n\nThis is an extremely slanted OP. You might mention the games but I don't know if you remember living through it, but it was actually kind of hard to find Genesis games for a long while much less Tg-16 games... My local KB Toys and I think Service Merchandise were only places that might get Sega games but they were always limited even after Sonic. Stupid Nintendo nonsense\n\nAlso anyone who unironically mentions 'JJ and Jeff' as a game worth playing.... Ugh. Bad memories\n\nSeparately, I am still sad I never picked up more Master System games before the big bubble.
