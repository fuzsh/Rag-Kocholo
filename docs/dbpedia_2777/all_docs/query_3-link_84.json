        "text": "Partnerstore collaboration with Retro-Bit. We ship internationally.\n\nThe epic story of Yuko Ahso from ordinary schoolgirl to the Warrior of Valis saving Earth and the Dreamland from the invading hordes from the Dark World graced the SEGA Genesis®/Mega Drive over 30 years ago. Those looking to own all three titles, they can look forward to receiving an additional master slipcase to store all three titles as well as a special acrylic stand displaying Cham, Valna, and Yuko.\n\nSleek new master slipcase for those that purchase all three games\n\nIncludes an additional acrylic stand featuring the three heroines\n\nFeaturing artwork from all three titles\n\nIncludes each game and its contents\n\nMakes for a great addition to any retro game collection\n\nRelease FAQ\n\nQ) What is included in this release?\n\nA) As this is a collection of three titles, those who purchase the entire collection will receive a\n\nmaster slipcase, an acrylic stand featuring the trio from Valis III, as well as each of the three\n\ngames themselves. Each game comes packed in a replica Genesis/Mega Drive clamshell case\n\nthat features a reversible inlay cover with alternate artwork, a full-colored instruction manual, art card, and an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.\n\nQ) Is this the same collection that is on the Switch?\n\nA) This is an entirely separate collection independent from other Valis collections. None of the work between either release was shared and fans can expect the quality and attention to detail that we have continued to offer for each of our releases.\n\nQ) How many will be made? The certificate has a number on it - is that the limited total?\n\nA) The number on the certificate sample image is just a placeholder. The total number will depend on the amount pre-ordered during the ordering window.\n\nQ) Will there be another reprint?\n\nA) Like all of the titles we offer, this will be an open pre-order window for a limited time. There are no plans to reissue this collection again.\n\nQ) Will other Valis titles get a release as well?\n\nA) While we are excited about further considerations of other Valis titles, we have not announced any plans at this time.\n\nQ) Will this be available for download or on other consoles?\n\nA) This is a physical re-release of the SEGA Genesis®/Mega Drive cartridges. We currently do not have plans to release it in any other form. Updated 10/20/2022 Technical\n\nQ) What consoles can play this cartridge?\n\nA) This game is compatible with North American SEGA Genesis® consoles, PAL Mega Drive\n\nconsoles, and most 3rd party consoles that are able to run Genesis/Mega Drive cartridges. Due to the shape of the cartridge, it will not fit into a JP Mega Drive console.\n\nQ) What voltage is used on the chip?\n\nA) It uses a 5-volt chip to retain your console’s performance and will not damage your console.\n\nQ) Are the insert points beveled?\n\nA) Yes, the insert points are beveled and the edges are rounded to allow for proper insertion without damaging the pins in the cartridge slot.\n\nQ) Is this game region-free?\n\nA) Like our prior releases, this game is region-free so long as it is compatible with the console.\n\nQ) Does this run at 50hz on PAL consoles?\n\nA) The game is multi-regional and can run at 60Hz (NTSC for North America) or 50Hz (PAL Europe and Australia).\n\nGameplay FAQ\n\nQ) What are the differences between the original releases and these?\n\nA) All licensing has been updated on all three titles. Additionally, players can expect to see these changes:\n\na) Syd of Valis: Several portions of the game that still had Japanese text have been\n\ntranslated into English. This includes the Game Over, the End Game screen, and the\n\nCredits.\n\nb) Valis III: The Music Test has been unlocked after previously only being available in the\n\nJapanese version. Players can hold A+B+C and press Start on the title screen to view it.\n\nDelivery\n\nWe ship worldwide using registered mail to make sure your products arrive safely.
