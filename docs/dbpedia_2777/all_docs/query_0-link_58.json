        "text": "Welcome to Project2612, your one and only source on the web for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive VGM soundtracks. Our mission is to provide you with the most accurate, non-waveform reproduction of Sega Genesis/Sega Mega Drive music to date, using the VGM format. We currently have a total of 705 soundtrack sets, with every single known song (and even some hidden songs not used!) in these games.\n\nThe VGM Format originated on SMS Power!, and is actually multiplatform, but for this site's purposes, we'll be focusing solely on the Gen/MD and select games on a case-by-case basis for its derivatives, the 32X and the Sega/Mega CD. For more information, as well as all the formats VGM supports, you may visit SMS Power! by clicking on the above link.\n\nYou may be skeptical about the quality of the VGMs over formats such as GYM, GSR, or even MP3s, but with over 6661976 Downloads, how can you be wrong in giving it a shot? Best of all, VGM rips are so easy to do that even YOU can do it. That's right! You need no fancy coding knowledge. You don't need to know the drivers of the game. You don't need to go digging through the game ROM to find the data! All you need is a little patience, a lot of love, a pinch of nostalgia, and, of course, our tutorial, right in that navigation bar up there. It will teach you everything you need to know, from the programs used and proper tagging, to how to cleanly trim a song so it loops flawlessly, like all other songs on this site. :) Also, don't forget to join our forums and come chat with us on IRC. We hope you enjoy your stay here, and do drop by often - we update all the time!"
