        "text": "Main Reviews Studs Duds Art Info Store\n\nDown and Dirty Reviews: Genesis -- N - S\n\nOver a hundred games here! Sega has really out done themselves with the Genesis. You'll see a lot classic shoot em ups, action platformers, and much more but there are not a lot of those sports games reviewed because they are not my favourite. All reviews are by StarSoldier unless noted.\n\nThe overall scores are out of 100.\n\nThe graphics, sounds, and game play are out of 10.\n\nScore / Name\n\n79 NHL 94 (Electronic Arts, 1993)\n\nOut of all the NHL based games for the Genesis, 94 is perhaps the most sought after. I did like all the fighting and the action was very quick in this game too but it looks so choppy compared to what we're playing now, eh? If you paid over $2 for it than you got ripped off by the way but there is no denying that this is still a great action title with a lot of features.\n\nFor 1 to 2 players\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 5\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n64 NHL 98 (EA, 1997)\n\nI only bought this yearly hockey game because it was kind of rare but still the tired franchise is still plays very well. I hate all those confusing options before a game and the game play wasn't as intense of 94 but all the controls still work seamlessly and the graphics and sounds are very realistic. I'm not really a hockey nut even though I'm Canadian but if you love the sport then go for this edition.\n\nFor 1 to 4 players\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 9\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n32 The OOZE (Sega, 1996)\n\nThis one had serious potential. In the game you were once acclaimed scientist but you were murdered by a group of terrorists looking to steal your work. Instead of dying though you were transformed into a massive blob monster and now you are on a quest for revenge. It's a cool idea and the game starts out fun but you are a very big target and the game quickly becomes frustrating as you take a lot of hits merely because of your big size and limited areas to travel across.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 5\n\nsound: 4\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n70 OUT RUN (Sega, 1991)\n\nAnother arcade hit from Sega arrives on the Genesis and the translation is fairly close. Out Run is your typical 3D racing game where you try to finish a course in the shortest amount of time possible but the big difference from other games of this type is you can choose where to go near the end of the stage. The graphics are a little choppy and the music is scratchy too but Out Run still plays great so if you liked the arcade game then this is definitely worth a look.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 5\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n51 OUT RUN 2019 (Sega, 1992)\n\nOut Run 2019 is a very strange upgrade of the classic arcade racer that plays pretty much the same as the original. You still try to complete each stage in the right amount of time and there are detours at the end of each too so you can try out different stages but now there are new 500 miles per hour cars and futurist tracks. The game is fun but there is nothing special here overall.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 5\n\nsound: 5\n\ngameplay: 5\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n30 PAC MAN 2 The New Adventures (Namco, 1994)\n\nRemember all those boring Sega CD games like Night Trap or Time Gal where you were just watching the movie and the game would demand you place in the right command and just the right time or you would lose? Well Namco here got the stupid idea to make a 2D story based game where you throw commands at Pac Man but you don't really control the yellow dude himself. This game has the original Pac Man and edited Pac Man Jr. too which are sadly far superior games. It could have been decent but I don't care too much for the slow paced main cartoon game though because the adventure moves so slowly to be any real fun.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 5\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n62 PAPERBOY (Tengen/Atari, 1991)\n\nPaperboy is a simple game of throwing around papers at people's houses day but after a whlie even tossing around the news at anything wears thin. Paperboy is a good buy for arcade fans but that doesn't mean it translates well to the home market and everyone won't like the high difficulty here either.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n30 PGA TOUR III (EA, 1996)\n\nI only got this because golf video games can be fun at times and I thought EA sports would do a good job here..... I was quite wrong. The 3D graphics stinks, the sound is horrible, the pacing is very slow as well. I had must more fun with more accessible titles like Power Golf and NES Open, PGA Tour III here is just a commercial joke and boring as hell.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 4\n\nsound: 3\n\ngameplay: 5\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n95 PHANTASY STAR II (Sega, 1990)\n\nHere is one of the best RPG's ever for any system, and it's also one of the hardest. In the game two young warriors brave the many dangers to solve the mysteries of the worldwide monsters and diasters. Can you find the main Mother Brain behind this? The great story line highlight a long 6 meg quest that's not for the weak.\n\n*Battery back up game saves 4 files\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 9\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\nTTR DUD of the MONTH COLLECTION!\n\n74 PHANTASY STAR III: Generations of Doom (Sega, 1992)\n\nSega's first two Phantasy Star games were some of my favourite role playing games ever made and I was really looking forward to next installment in the series. Sega decided to make some very radical changes to the series like adding a generations aspect to the story lines, they changed the graphics so they appear more realistic, and the whole game has a new medieval feel to it but despite their best efforts, many had mixed reactions to part III and that includes me. Although part III was a decent game, some hardcore RPG nuts didn't like Phantasy Star III's super slow pace and goofy looking battle scenes. Phantasy Star III still has a lot going for it like four different endings, more realistic graphics, unique new music, and who can forget the massive quest that spans across three generations? Despite all that Phantasy Star III is still my least favourite game on the popular series.\n\n*Battery back up game saves two files.\n\n*Uncommon Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 9\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n91 PHANTASY STAR IV: The end of the Millennium (Sega, 1994)\n\nIn the 4th game of this famous series you help Hunters Chaz Ashley (the rookie swordsman) and Ayls Brangwin (the veteran slasher thrower) on a mission to kill any monsters for cash in this huge 24 meg game. Overall Phantasy Star 4 is too similar to part 2 with very few enhancements so it kind a hurts this game a little, plus I felt that the character development was a little weak especially for the main figures like Chaz and Rika. I still really enjoyed playing this awesome game from beginning to end and I still wanted more after the game was finally completed. The graphics were awesome, the music was still good, the battles were fun, the game was never too slow, and there were even cameos and info from past games of the series which was great for me because I played them all.\n\n*Battery back up game saves three files\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 9\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n64 PITFIGHTER (Tengen/Midway, 1991)\n\nHere is an actual GOOD version of this tough underground fighter where you pick from one of three characters and you then you basically fight for survivor in a brutal fighting tournament with no rules. This game even has some of the full motion videos from the popular arcade game too which is impressive for a cart based game. Pitfighter is not the prettiest fighter anymore since the animation is so chunky but it controls decent enough plus beating up people never gets old.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n71 PIRATES! GOLD (MircoProse, 1993)\n\nPirates Gold is a good looking strategy game that lets you feel like what it's like to be a pirate on the high seas. I know it sounds cool already but it's not all stealing and fighting because you have worry your crew moral, you cash flow, and your travel routes. There's actually a lot of strategy involved and it can get addictive. Sadly it can also get repetitive and good luck finding a copy too.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n51 POWER RANGERS: The Movie (Sega, 1994)\n\n\"Yup, you guessed it!\" This is another one of those sloppy Final Fight type clone. You know the deal fight a bunch of the same old bad guys for the hundredth time and then fight a cheesy boss monster. It may shut up the kids for a while but pro players will easily push this to the side for a better fighter like Streets of Rage.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 5\n\nsound: 4\n\ngameplay: 5\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n58 PRIMAL RAGE (Time Warner/Atari Games, 1995)\n\nThe limited dinosaur fighting game by Atari Games also came to the Genesis. In this one on one beat em up you get a choice of only 7 dinos to pick from and there are no bosses for some reason. Its fun beating up dinosaurs and giant apes but after you seen all the questionable content then the game quickly loses its appeal.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 5\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n78 The PUNISHER (Capcom/Sculcupted Software, 1994)\n\nIt's odd with the success of Capcom's arcade beat 'em up like Final Fight and Knights of the Round, the Punisher here is the only cartridge based side scroller brawler by the software giant for this popular console. So it any good? Well, the cool thing about the Punisher here is you get to duke it out with either the Punisher or Nick Fury in singles or co-op plus there are tons of punks to fight that may or may not carry weapons. Fortunately you can use weapons too and fun to pick up knives, bats, flame throwers, and even machine guns to help gain an edge. There are scenes in the game where you can draw guns to get rid of enemies but it's odd you can do it when the game tells you to. Although the animation is a little weak and the sound effects are muffled, the game play is intense and the action rarely slows down either despite all the carnage on screen at once.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n78 QUACKSHOT Starring Donald Duck (Sega, 1992)\n\nEasily one of the most original and most challenging games for the Sega Genesis. In this game you help Donald Duck find a lost fortune in gold and if anyone gets in the way then you have your trusty toilet plunder gun by your side to stun enemies or use them as platforms if they stick to a wall (after you get the right power up). Quackshot is a solid adventure title that has some great graphics, great music, and it even has a great idea.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 8\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n19 RACE DRIVIN (Tengen/Atari Games, 1993)\n\nHere is a simply awful looking 3D polygon racing game originally from Atari Games. This is the sequel to the game Hard Drivin; the only difference now is that players can select their track before a race. Although you don't see 3D games on the Genesis too often, with these sad visuals now you know there is a very good reason.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 3\n\nsound: 2\n\ngameplay: 3\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n71 RAIDEN TRAD (MircoNet/Seibu Kaibatsu, 1991)\n\nAlthough its cool to see this arcade hit on the Sega Genesis, its hardly the best Raiden version out there. The graphics for example; look extremely dated with the loss of detail and music sounds very scratchy now too. This edition does include a new bonus 9th level not found anywhere else though. Raiden here is still a decent shooter with tons of action but sadly the two player option was taken out and even on Easy the difficulty is insane especially later in the game.\n\n*Uncommon Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n70 RAMBO III (Sega, 1989)\n\nHere is one of the first games released for the Sega Genesis and it's not too bad. Although the game is your standard shooter, Rambo III still holds up well today with plenty to shoot at. Rambo III is a very good action title with some impressive 16-bit graphics but the whole game could have been longer.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n67 RANGER X (Sega, 1993)\n\nRanger X is a very unique action game featuring a powerful robotic soldier with a weird roller jet weapon device that either acts like a side kick or can be attached to yourself to change your method of attack. The game is a fun and graphically impressive title thanks to the all the carnage on screen but the only real issue with the title is that it really gets tough later on in the game.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n31 RASTAN SAGA 2 (Taito, 1991)\n\nRemember that great action game called Rastan from a few years back? This doesn't look like the original tough barbarian action game at all, this looks like a super lame cartoon show now! The graphics are goofy, the sound effects are annoying, and the game moves so slowly now. Just avoid this joke of a game and sequel.\n\n*Uncommon Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 3\n\nsound: 4\n\ngameplay: 2\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n62 RC PRO AM CHAMPIONSHIP (Tradewest/Rare, 1992)\n\nYes, there is a RC Pro Am game for the Genesis and this version has cleaner graphics and sounds then the older Nintendo versions. Sadly, it's only an one player game now for some odd reason which is odd since most versions are multi-player. This is still a great remote control toy car game especially if you loved those original NES games.\n\n*Uncommom Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 5\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n56 RED ZONE (Time Warner, 1994)\n\nThis action game here is easily one the best looking games on the old Genesis. It doesn't control very well or even play very well for that matter whether you're in a helicopter or on the ground 'but hey' it has Full Motion Video, and that's most important thing, right? Red Zone has a lot of flaws but once you master the difficult controls it isn't too bad.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 9\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n63 REN & STIMPY: Stimpy's Invention (Sega/Blue Sky, 1993)\n\nStimpy's Invention is a fairly good two player action game starring the not too children-friendly comedy duo. If you don't know who these guys are you play as mentally challenged fat cat and overly aggressive small dog and you are on a mission to find the parts to Stimpy's crazy happy helmet. The game is packed with some funny moments here and there like the ability to grab Powdered Toastman's butt and use the other player as a weapon but the action itself is nothing we have not seen before.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\nThe StarSoldier Game of the Month!\n\n90 REVENGE of SHINOBI (Sega, 1990)\n\nRevenge is an absolutely great 4 meg sequel to the original arcade Shinobi that really showed off the powers of the Sega Genesis back in the day. In the game you play as a ninja on a mission to save his bride from the powerful super natural enemy he defeated in the past. Not only are the graphics impressive but the music here is excellent as well and fits the game perfectly. The game is hard but ROS is a highly recommend action title if you haven't played it already.\n\n*Multiple versions released\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 9\n\nsound: 10\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n24 RINGS of POWER (EA/Naughty Dog, 1991)\n\nThis game actually has some brief nudity if you know the secret code and the game was done by the same people who did games like Crash Bandicoot and Jax and Daxter. The game itself though isn't very impressive. The strategy style game play here stinks big time thanks to the confusion menus, unbearable music, and really ugly graphics.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 2\n\nsound: 1\n\ngameplay: 5\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n62 RISK (Parker Brothers, 1994)\n\nHere's a rare one! If you never heard of this Parker Brothers game, you help control your armies to overtake your friends armies in this translated board game. War and imperialism: fun for the whole family! The single player game can get dull and repetitive but the multi-player games can be a lot of fun and the added mini games were nice touch as well.\n\nFor 1 to 4 players\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n58 RISTAR (Sega, 1994)\n\nRistar is a weird and slow moving action game starring a long armed starkid looking to rescue his father. The hook here is you hero can use his long arms to grab ledges, objects, or enemies kind of Radd Spencer in Bionic Commando. This game tried to be the next great 2D Sonic-like platformer but like I said before it's way too slow and that's not good for a long action game like this.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 5\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n65 ROAD BLASTERS (Tengen/Atari Games, 1991)\n\nThis game has both shooting and 3D racing action all in one but it didn't do either one all too well since the game doesn't feel very different from level to level plus you really have to be careful of your very limited time here as well. Oh well at least this is one of Atari's legends from the 1980's also features a wide selection of 50 levels, limited guns, and different enemies here. Road Blasters on the Genesis is one of the better versions out there but the game play isn't the most in-depth.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n85 ROAD RASH (Electronic Arts, 1991)\n\nOhya, this game forgets all the bullcrap found in several racing video games before it and Road Rash became something special. In the game you are a young biker looking to move up in the ranks and you can kick or club your way to victory as you race across several dangerous tracks filled with rivals, cops, and even traffic. The game starts off easy enough but the action heats up in later stages with more aggressive enemies and smarter cops looking to bust ya plus you can take realistic damage too. If a car hits you for example you go flying off your bike and after that then you have to run and get your bike if you can. It's funny, it's realistic, and it's awesome! Road Rash lacks multi-player but thankfully there's still tons to do like earn cash and dish out damage so it's no big deal.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 9\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n79 ROBOCOP VERSUS TERMINATOR (Virgin, 1994)\n\nEver wonder what if the Robocop ever fought the Terminator? Me either but here is a game about it anyway. In this 2D action game you play the role of Robocop (a cyborg who was once a law enforcement officer) and it is up to him to rid the streets of crime but it won't be easy especially when you encounter the super robots the Terminators. The game plays like a standard action/shooter title but what is here is not only intense but it is quite violence as well. Robocop vs. Terminator is a well crafted game that will appeal to more mature audiences.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\nRated (MA-13) for players above 13\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n78 ROCKET KNIGHT ADVENTURES (Konami, 1993)\n\nOne of Konami's first ever games on the Sega Genesis. RKA is a goofy looking but intense action game starring a blue possum with a sword and a rocket pack. The character never really took off but it was a interesting idea at least. The problem with Rocket Knight here is the game play is too fast for a platformer and I found the game play more confusing then fun but once you learn the controls and see the cool stage designs there is a great game here.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n76 ROCK N' ROLL RACING (Interplay, 1993)\n\nThis fun Super Nintendo hardcore racer comes to the Genesis complete with its famous heavy metal rock midi music and its deadly weaponary. The sound isn't as good as the Snes version but the crazy hardcore driving game play is still intact here so that's cool. If you like overhead racing games like RC Pro Am but you something with a bit more action then you'll love this.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n75 ROLLING THUNDER 2 (Namco, 1991)\n\nThis action spy game looks quite impressive for it's day. In the game you play as one or two highly skilled spies on a mission to stop some mutant terrorists in some cool anime style action. It's a very difficult game and the controls can be a little stiff at times but it's still a lot of fun thanks to it easy to pick up arcade-like game play.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 8\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n60 ROLLING THUNDER 3 (Namco, 1993)\n\nAnybody remember this game in the somewhat popular action series? Rolling Thunder 3 is a really basic arcade spy style arcade game that's easy to play and slightly easier to control then the last game but Namco also took out the fun two player mode as well. The game is nothing too new but it's still solid spy action.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n87 SAGAIA (Taito, 1991)\n\nSagaia is an action packed side scrolling shooter based on the popular Darius series. This game is loaded with a huge 28 levels, multiple power ups, and it has even multiple endings. The story is about the heroic Darius fighter pilots and how they get a destress call from another solar system where their old enemies are planning an grand scale invasion. So can you save our solar system from destruction? The only problems with this fine title is that some stages can get repetitive plus the music although catchy can be annoying. Still Sagaia is so intense and so large that it makes for a must for any diehard shooter fan.\n\n*Uncommon Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 7\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n41 SAINT SWORD (Taito, 1990)\n\nThe lame name of Saint Sword really fits this dull action title well because this game here absolutely stinks! The levels are absolutely huge but that's also part of the problem. Its very easy to get lost and your on the clock too so you have study the game or you would make it very far. Thanks but no thanks.

Because the game was so popular it was even made for several other gaming system other than SNK's very own Neo Geo cartridge system. This version has some nice graphics and the game play stays intact but the 3D scaling effects are done plus the giant EarthQuake is missing from the lineup possiblily from the weaker hardware when compared to the stronger Neo Geo.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n77 SHADOW DANCER: The Secret of Shinobi (Sega, 1991)\n\nHere is another great Shinobi game but unlike the others now you have a white dog to help you through the 5 challenging levels.

If you are new to this you play as a man that has been transformed into a hideous beast creature and now you are on a mission for a cure. My biggest issue with the game is your beast character is the horrible hit detection, your standard punch attack that you'll be using for 90 percent of the game has short range and it's easy to take a lot of damage from the many enemies here. Another issue is the overall difficulty, one life and no continues so good freaking luck.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 5\n\ngameplay: 3\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n24 SHADOW of the BEAST II (Electronic Arts, 1992)\n\nThe beast is now cured but he still has to deal with a huge list of enemies in this sequel. This nearly impossible to play action game comes with great character detail but lousy character animation and the insane high difficulty feels as unbalanced as ever. Was Shadow of the Beast that good of a game to get a sequel in the first place especially after the first one bombed here? I remember hating it on the Genesis last time and this new one still plays like sh*&! This game could have been an awesome sequel to the popular PC original thanks to the good art and monster killing game play but this is very poorly done.\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 4\n\ngameplay: 3\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n53 SHINING in the DARKNESS (Sega, 1991)\n\nHere is the first game in the Shining Force series is your average 3D dungeon type of game.

See why Sonic is a still a great and fun game to have around. Sonic was fast, he had a attitude, gameplay anyone could master, plus graphics and sound that still hold up even today. Sonic the Hedgehog also won the 1991 Game of the Year in such magazines like Electonic Gaming Monthly, Video Games & Computers, and more thus making the game the next big thing of it's time.

A very impressive feet! Here is the historic game that helped to turn the tables on Nintendo and made the Sega Genesis number 1. The new 3D bonus levels, the spin dash move, and the 2 player battle modes added extra punch to a already fun game. Sonic 2 is a great game for people looking for easy to control arcade action that any one can pick up and play.

Fortunately, you can take multiple hits and even earn power ups if you destroy the mother ship that appears from time to time. This great shooting game comes packed with 17 levels, a great soundtrack, and different enemies for each section too. Space Invaders 91 is really great for retro fanatics and maybe this game will win over new fans as well thanks to the intense action.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 8\n\ngameplay: 6\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n83 SPLATTERHOUSE 2 (Namco, 1992)\n\nThe bloody sequel to the cool Turbografx-16 horror game features more weapons and all new gruesome creatures that makes Resident Evil look like a cake walk.

The game plays like a Final Fight clone so you can grabble certain enemies and do combo moves too.

It's highly recommend you buy this game with the instruction manual because there are tons of alien races to study each with their own different technology. There are even some Asteroids-like battle scenes here but the game is more of a strategy title and a slow one at that.\n\n*Uncommon Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 6\n\nsound: 4\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n07 STAR FLIGHT (EA, 1991)\n\nI wanted to like Star Flight here but the problem is it has terrible sound, terrible graphics, and terrible well, everything!

There is a lot you can do in the game like managing resources and visiting aliens but it's just way too slow for my taste.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 player only\n\ngraphics: 3\n\nsound: 0\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\nSECOND OPINION!\n\nI loved that game! I know the graphics and sound weren't top notch, but if you've ever played the PC version you will know that they are a huge improvment over that.

It really doesn't make that much of a difference though. This is a great fighting game with 12 playable fighters each with their own moves but the music and sound effects are noticeably worse on the Genesis.

In the game you help the vigilantes Axel, Adam, and Blaze clean up the mean streets, beaches, and hideouts of a gang invested city. Streets of Rage is easy to pick up and play yet still tough to master too with great controls and you can even use a clear all enemies bomb attack like in Golden Axe. Although it's a clone of Final Fight, it surpasses the original in so many ways especially that Snes diaster.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 8\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n90 STREETS of RAGE 2 (Sega, 1992)\n\nThe first ever 16 Mega bit game on the Genesis is this popular sequel to Sega's original well done fighting title. Streets of Rage 2 removes Adam from the original cast and adds the giant pro wrestler Maxx and the small but very scrapy Skate to the line up so you have an impressive four characters to pick from now. If that wasn't cool enough the visuals look way better with larger characters and the sprite detail rivals what the arcades were currently doing at the time. SOR2 is a great looking fighting game and it plays great but it is a bit too easy and it now looks even more like Capcom's Final Fight so it loses some points for unoriginality. Still a very cool game though that just plays great.\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 9\n\nsound: 7 ............. poor digital voices.\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n74 STREETS of RAGE 3 (Sega, 1994)\n\nThis edition to the once popular franchise is not as easy or as linear as the second Streets of Rage but despite that improvement it's not all good. First off the new music just feels out of place here and the new robotic character named Zan just sucks in comparsion to the previous game (I miss Maxx). Plus if that wasn't enough Sega even censored this game by putting more clothes on the ladies and the original Japanese version had a strange boss that looked very fruity. Oddly this boss can still be unlocked with a Game Genie code though. Streets of Rage 3 isn't bad but it loses some of the magic from the last titles thanks to the strange sci-fi story line and high default difficulty.\n\n*Rare Genesis game\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 8\n\nsound: 4....... just awful!\n\ngameplay: 8\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n46 STREET SMART (Treco, 1990)\n\nStreet Smart is a merely OK one on one beat em up with some fairly good graphics for its day but Street Fighter II absolutely kills this in terms of complexity, options, and animation.

There's just one problem though, Superman is a total wimp and in most of the stages you only have a few types of short range punches and kicks to fight off several different enemies that always seem to surround you at the worst moments.

The graphics and sounds are not as polished as the arcade in terms of quality so Super Monaco GP has aged a bit in presentation and the password save system is a bit annoying but the game still plays great thanks to the smooth controls and I also like that blonde chick in the swimsuit too, eh?\n\nFor 1 or 2 players\n\ngraphics: 7\n\nsound: 6\n\ngameplay: 7\n\nFind this game on eBay here!\n\n68 SUPER STREET FIGHTER II (Capcom, June 1994)\n\nThis fighting upgrade here ended up being the biggest memory size cart for the Genesis clocking in at a whooping 40 megs!
