        "text": "Why does this thread exist?\n\nWith the increase of digital sales worldwide, a lot of publishers are trying to resurrect old titles so people can play them in modern consoles.\n\nArcade Archives, Sega Ages, Konami collections, Capcom collections and so on.\n\nLike most of things nowadays, many of them are overlooked, so I have made this thread to list and discuss them. There are many people waiting that publishers release again the favorite games from their childhood.\n\nWhat years are considered Retro?\n\nEveryone have a diferent opinion from post-2005, so I'll look case by case. PSP, DS or Wii are a thin line.\n\nMaybe there will be a game that it's considered retro for people who visit the thread in 2025 and not now.\n\nHow are companies releasing their games?\n\nPublishers and developers are bringing the old classics in many ways:\n\nPort: Releasing the original game with minimal changes (Emulated games included)\n\nRemaster: Improving the original game, sometimes including new features\n\nRemake: Creating a new version of the original game since zero\n\nRevival: Forgotten games are released many years later for the first time or games coming back after >10 years keeping the old formula.\n\nSequel: New titles of dormant IPs.\n\nI'll try to make different tables by months. So, we don't have a huge table that takes up half of the thread.\n\nGreat games already available\n\nSunset Riders\n\nCollection of Mana\n\nPhantasy Star\n\nMoon: Remix RPG Adventure\n\nCapcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle\n\nCastlevania Advance Collection\n\nTurok\n\nMega Man Zero / ZX Legacy Collection\n\nVirtua Racing\n\nDoom 64\n\nLatest Releases\n\nGAMETYPEO.PLATFORMDATEO.YEARCOLLECTIONXuan-Yuan Sword: Mists Beyond the MountainsRemasterPC12/08/2319991080 SnowboardingPortNintendo 6412/08/231998Nintendo 64 -

They really seemed to be rolling along there for a while, but I'm feeling pretty certain that they've closed that door at this point.\n\nI mean, I do understand that Nintendo probably isn't keen to highlight their uber-early, super-uncreative \"clone\"-era by pasting up like Block Fever and SF-HiSplitter for everyone to see.\n\n...and I can definitely understand why Monkey Magic will most likely never see the light of day again.\n\nBut it would be nice to see them at least throw Sheriff and Arm Wrestling up on the service. Maybe Radar Scope and Space Firebird as well just for completeness. Let's face it, this is probably one of the best chances we'll have to get official re-releases of these things and seems a shame to leave some on the chopping block.\n\nAt the very least, I'm thrilled that they finally obliged in releasing official versions of the arcade Punch-Out games, DK Trilogy, and even Sky Skipper (which is alot more fun that I imagined it would be). Pretty half-and-half on the Vs. System library as I imagine most people are, but at least it's mostly there for posterity.\n\nMy favorite experience from this - I put about a dozen hours into Punch-Out and Super Punch-Out on Switch in order to be able to 1CC (through Sandman) them on any difficulty. Recently was traveling with my family and stopped at one of the largest arcades in America on a vacation. Weaving through isles to find the Punch-Out machine, and whooping it live as a result of the effort felt pretty sweet, let me tell you. Had a few looking over the shoulder to see after Kid Quick, which seems to be the stopping-block for a lot of folks.\n\nLooks like we're going to have a new Virtual Console by Hamster.\n\nSquare Enix trademarks The Divine Force in Japan, Hamster trademarks Console Archives\n\nSquare Enix filed a trademark for “The Divine Force” on October 5 in Japan, which was made public today.\n\nAre Enix SNES games getting re-released finally? We'll see.\n\nIn other news, two more Cotton games announced for the next week.\n\nCotton 100% SNES version\n\nPanorama Cotton Mega Drive version.\n\nPrice is €14.99 each one.\n\nIt's almost beyond parody to me that literally hours before my article on the death of piecemeal reissues was to go live Hamster pretty much ends up starting their own form of Virtual Console. Very curious to see how it goes down, since I don't think people will be happy if they charge 800 yen for FC games... SNES/PCE though? I'll buy all the PCE games in the world. There's a good potential for it to be like Project EGG, and hopefully be an expansive library of classic games on PS4/Switch... But I also worry we'll get boring done to death games like NES Gradius/Pac-Man and the like.\n\nWould love to see stuff like Terra Cresta II on this though.\n\nBut may I ask why the Squaresoft trademark would relate to Enix stuff? Two of the three games in the soul blazer trilogy have pretty immovable legal issues (Soul Blazer's OST, Gaia's art) that require external parties, so I doubt it could be for that... Unless it's The Creation of Heaven and Earth, which I don't think has as many issues save for Nintendo's translation.\n\n'Sup fellow retro-friends.\n\nThought of the day:\n\nI'm still disappointed that Arcade Archive wasn't able to finish up the Nintendo-developed Arcade ports. They really seemed to be rolling along there for a while, but I'm feeling pretty certain that they've closed that door at this point.\n\nI mean, I do understand that Nintendo probably isn't keen to highlight their uber-early, super-uncreative \"clone\"-era by pasting up like Block Fever and SF-HiSplitter for everyone to see.\n\n...and I can definitely understand why Monkey Magic will most likely never see the light of day again.\n\nBut it would be nice to see them at least throw Sheriff and Arm Wrestling up on the service. Maybe Radar Scope and Space Firebird as well just for completeness.

Had a few looking over the shoulder to see after Kid Quick, which seems to be the stopping-block for a lot of folks.\n\nI don't think there's too much left for Nintendo's lineup, to be blunt. Most of their big VS games are all out and I can't think of any outside of light gun titles that scream \"must-port\". Their pre-DK era isn't really good and outside of Radar Scope/Sheriff I don't think any would be noteworthy from a historical POV. Don't know why Monkey Magic in particular would be problematic, unless it's just how unsettling the whole game looks, but I'd give that as much odds as Space Firebird (As in, next to none).\n\nI would also agree with you on Arm Wrestling, but after playing it at Galloping Ghost... Yeah, if that came to switch all the Joy-Cons on earth would drift at once, it's VERY taxing to mash the stick, to the point it physically tired me out. Turbo could help for the button mashing bits, but constantly jamming on the stick might not be something Nintendo wants people to do.\n\nI don't think there's too much left for Nintendo's lineup, to be blunt.

Turbo could help for the button mashing bits, but constantly jamming on the stick might not be something Nintendo wants people to do.\n\nFor Monkey Magic, it's really just the imagery of knocking out a Monkey's teeth before turning his eyes into \"x\"s while being surrounded by skulls that makes me think it has a low chance. It may be primitive arcade graphics, but that description alone sure sounds like something modern Nintendo would shy away from. Maybe not. Pretty meaningless either way, since it's a totally unremarkable breakout clone beyond that, eh.\n\nAnd yeah, I totally hear ya on Arm Wrestling. I always thought that tiring aspect was by-design to really make you feel like you were in a physical contest. It really doesn't work great without an arcade stick either way. But it does close out the Takeda Punch-Out trilogy to some degree....\n\nI assume, however, that it is mostly ignored because it was never released in Japan, which always appears as something NOJ sees as a less relevant release for one reason or another when you look at their history.\n\n'Sup fellow retro-friends.\n\nThought of the day:\n\nI'm still disappointed that Arcade Archive wasn't able to finish up the Nintendo-developed Arcade ports.

Would love to see stuff like Sheriff, Radar Scope, and even Vs Mach Rider.\n\nIn any case, it's great that we got the original arcade Donkey Kong, both arcade Punch-Outs, and most impressive of all, Sky Skipper! It's pretty incredible that they were able to get that, given how few machines of it remain."
