        "text": "whats the best game of Pc Engine (turbo16) and Sega Cd\n\ni played near all console, but these 2, only a very few times\n\ni own a lot of classic console but not these 2 consoles.\n\ni want to know only the great games of any genre: platform, action,racing,puzzle...\n\ni would be very happy to know it.\n\nthanks a lot for answer, i appreciate it\n\nnote`: if you know any 32x great game, i would like to know it too\n\nSega CD games:\n\nSnatcher - A good adventure game, one of the few games that I actually played through to completion. Definitely recommended.\n\nRobo Aleste - A very difficult shooter, one of the best.\n\nLunar: The Silver Star - A good turn-based RPG.\n\nPopful Mail - A nice action/RPG.\n\nSonic CD - Some would say its the best Sonic game, but I actually think its the worst... Worth checking out anyway.\n\nSilpheed - A good arcade shooter that actually shows a bit of 3D rendering on the Sega CD. Quite Nice.\n\nOh, and 32x Games:\n\nKnuckles Chaotix - An interesting platformer, I actually quite like it.\n\nSpace Harrier 32X - Probably one of the, if not the best fort of Sega's arcade classic.\n\nrenejr902 said:\n\nwhats the best game of Pc Engine (turbo16) and Sega Cd\n\ni played near all console, but these 2, only a very few times\n\ni own a lot of classic console but not these 2 consoles.\n\ni want to know only the great games of any genre: platform, action,racing,puzzle...\n\ni would be very happy to know it.\n\nthanks a lot for answer, i appreciate it\n\nnote`: if you know any 32x great game, i would like to know it too\n\nI would divide my tg-16 time with Parasol stars and a some Rainbow Islands\n\nSnow bros for the genesis is great, so are the sonic games, Sonic CD for segacd.\n\nChris\n\nsega cd:\n\ndark wizard - good stategy rpg\n\nfinal fight - in some ways better than the arcade game. definitely tons better than horrible snes port\n\nheart of the alien - frustrating yet fun sequel to out of this world which is also included.\n\nKeio's Flying Squadron - cute fun shmup\n\nflink - fun platformer\n\nbc racer - fun mario kart style game\n\neternal champions - enhance version of the genesis game. one of the few original console fighting games of the time\n\npc engine hu card:\n\nair zonk - fun and crazy horizontal shooter\n\ndevil's crush - very fun pinball game that doesn't try to recreate actual pinball and so is a fun video game\n\ndownload - pretty fun shump with hilarious engrish profanity when you lose.\n\ngalaga 90 - galaga made even more addicting\n\nbonks adventure - first in a series of fun platformers\n\nblazing lazers - excellent shmup\n\nninja spirit - probably as good as the shinobi games\n\nsplatterhouse - first in great horror movie inspired series\n\npc engine cd:\n\ngate of thunder - excellent side scrolling shmup\n\ncastlevania dracula x - one of the best pure action castevania games\n\nfaussete - interesting side scroller with mechanic similar to bionic commando\n\ngain ground - great port of thinking mans action game\n\nsapphire - fun shmup with great graphics\n\nvalis I and IV - very fun side scrollers\n\nspriggan - like the sega cd version (robo aleste) but even better\n\nstar parodia - fun and funny vertical shmup\n\nI'm finding tons of great pc engine games\n\nAdd to the list of great TG-16 CD titles above \"Lords of Thunder\". I compared it to the Sega CD version and the TG-16 version blows it away. The music is better, the graphics are better and it has an intro the Sega version does not.\n\nThe Exile RPGs are good (although the first one doesn't work in the current version of Temper), Ys series was good.\n\nI find the TG-16 games have \"cleaner\" graphics than most Genesis games which use alot of dither.\n\nOther games not mentioned that I thought were good and you might like are:\n\nTG-16/PC-E HuCard:\n\nOveride (shooter)\n\nBloody Wolf (action/shooter)\n\nDungeon Explorer (action/rpg)\n\nBomberman 1 & 93\n\nNeutopia I & II (great zelda style rpg series)\n\nTwinbee (shooter)\n\nParodius (shooter)\n\nSuper Star Soldier (shooter)\n\nFinal Soldier (shooter)\n\nSoldier Blade (shooter...imagine that)\n\nBonk 3 (also on SCD) (platform/adventure)\n\nR-Type (shooter)\n\nTG-16/PC-E CD/SCD:\n\nall of these are in English:\n\nBuster Bros (great arcade port)\n\nCosmic Fantasy 2 (rpg)\n\nBeyond Shadowgate (great adventure game)\n\nCotton (shooter)\n\nDragon Slayer (fun Falcom RPG)\n\nDungeon Explorer II\n\nDynastic Hero (different port of Wonder Boy in Monster World but is agood action rpg)\n\nMonster Lair (platform shooter)\n\nJapanese:\n\nKiaidan 00 (Great mech shooter)\n\nPop n Magic (Parasol Stars type game)\n\nNexzr (great shooter)\n\nSylphia (yet another shooter but is good)\n\nFray (run&gun action adventure)\n\nSega CD:\n\nVay (rpg)\n\nShining Force CD (strategy rpg)\n\nAndroid Assault (good shooter with a nice soundtrack)\n\nLunar Eternal Blue (rpg)\n\nPanic! also called Switch!
