        "text": "misadventurous: ALIEN SOLDIER is like GUNSTAR HEROES's ripped-as-fuck older brother who is not gonna take any of your shit. I agree with DAIS that playing around on the control screen to get a feel for it is best but disagree that you shouldn't immediately go play the actual game, enjoy it for all of ten minutes (tops), and die in a fireball, like I always seem to do. It is Pure Game; it gives you a set of things you can do and requires you to learn how to do ALL of them if you want to succeed. (“SUPEREASY” mode is not super easy, by the way, except compared to “SUPERHARD”)\n\nSchwere Viper: It's a Game Arts platformer in association with GAINAX. You play as a leggy sorceress with the power to annihilate foes in hordes thanks to her plentiful streams of lightning, as well as four different familiars with various attacks. Stages start off pretty normal with a linear romp through a forest full of beasties and an old temple with some fairly sneaky secret paths, but quickly become more interesting with a trek through a multi-layered canyon filled with old pathways and secret items, and even an assault on an flying airship. Then, once it crashes (thanks to you) you make your way through the wreckage in an interesting stage filled with odd angles and nasty surprises. I'm so glad I happened across an actual copy of this game before my nearest cool game store closed down. It's really worth a look!\n\nRT-55J: man it has severe pacing and content issues (it can seriously drag on). But when it's firing on all cylinders it's clear that it's just barely shy of being one of the all-time platform-shooting greats up their with Gunstar Heroes and Contra Hard Corps. The core mechanics are rock solid, and bosses and soundtrack are impressive by any standard.\n\nspectralsound: if i was in the 90s again this is what i would picture a Treasure shooter to be like, before finding out it would just be all browns and greys and Serious Themes. gleefully anarchistic, and bonus points for both having two badass girls for main characters and having a damned amazing soundtrack.\n\ndiplo: A momentous game with a solid grasp of how to challenge players, but it's lost the sense of place that its recent ancestors, like Rondo of Blood and Super Castlevania 4, have. Stages feel like gauntlet-bricolages rather than (mostly) narrative flowing units. The final stage is just a bummer with a couple of thematically unexplainable rooms and a horribly uninteresting boss rush; there's not much reason to go through with it if you've gotten to that point, except for the satisfaction that official closure brings. Excellent soundtrack loved by everyone who's heard it. It's also the first Castlevania game to let you choose between two characters from the start.\n\nLick Meth: Back when Treasure had to make a name for themselves they released this vivid platformer with a great sense of visual humour, a great soundtrack (and memorable sound effects such as the 'Target!' shout) and the crux of the gameplay dynamic, the switchable head function. It's really quite hard, much more so than the earlier Gunstar Heroes which didn't punish as badly for continuing. It's mostly a platformer, with scrolly shooty levels appearing from time to time, and a great running theme in the stageshow presence in the background and between levels (and occasionally falling onto the player). Standout tracks include the exciting bonus game music, and an interpretation of the March part of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.\n\nBacon&Onions: You have two versions of this to choose from- patch translated original JP version or as I grew up with the hard as nails Western version which replaces the dolls with robots, throws out the dialog cutscenes, starts you off with 0 continues instead of 3, makes continues HARDER to earn, and doubles the HP of every boss. After completely mastering the Western version I find the JP version too easy and the dialog detracts from the story I had in my head based on the visual cutscenes.\n\n?: Dynamite Headdy is the best game on the sega genesis, overlooked by many who were burned out by the difficulty. The main attack mechanic is your head which functions as is a sort of bungee corded grapple hook. Every level of this action oriented platformer masterpiece is jam packed with secrets and some of the most creative level and boss designs treasure has ever done.\n\nthestage: it's like a game from a pc genre that doesn't exist that somehow ended up on a console. it's kind of like commandos if commandos were more action based, featured proto-TF2 aesthetics, and was confined to one screen per level. and multiplayer. you get a squad of five soldiers distributed between a handful of classes (gunner, grenade dude, rocket launcher dude, flamethrower dude, dynamite dude), you select dudes, move the cursor around, tell them where to go, whether or not they should shoot, etc. if you run into another soldier you get into some white-hot NHL 94 style brawls. you can call medics. it's great. oh yeah you can even forgot the five dude team for a team of two guys that you control directly, switching between them with like the B button or something. I've never really seen anything like it. maybe you could call it a real time version of frozen synapse with smaller levels\n\nYoutImaginaryFriend: Super Offroad is actually one of my favorite multiplayer games. Me and my little brother spent a lot of time playing that game together (along with TMNT Arcade and Super Contra) and we got hours of entertainment out of it. I love the way it feels, and it's the only racer of its type that I've enjoyed playing.\n\nBacon&Onions: If this were not a mcdonald's branded video game it would be regarded as it should be, one of the GREATEST WEIRD games of the 16 bit era. As the story goes our creepy anti-hero Ronald finds a torn piece of a treasure map and proceeds to track down and beat down anything in his path to collect the entire map. Greed and smart investment is a heavy theme in the game, as you must give chunks of your hit point GEMS to allies and bosses in order to make progress in your quest for treasure. Completed boss cutscenes depict them laying crying and humiliated look as Ronald beams. The music, boss and level design is fantastic, and if you can embrace taking on the role as Ronald Mcdonald in a Treasure game you'll have a hell of a time. Dynamite headdy is a spiritual successor to the grapple hook mechanic of this game. Of particular note is the unforgettable Train stage. I won't spoil it but the tunnel scene and boss fight are equally brilliant.\n\nTuxedo: I legit like Moonwalker.\n\nAs a kid my cousin had this, Sonic, and a ton of other games and I basically played Moonwalker as much as every other game combined.\n\nI can't say I like the arcade version as much, it's more polished but there are way less dumb neat little touches, and isometric action w/ 8 direction movement/attacking cannot be anything but awkward. Charge attacks matter, and charge attacks are no fun.\n\nkiken: SEGA could have ported the arcade game respectably to the MD/Genesis… yeah, it would have been toned down aurally and visually, but I think the heart of the game could have been preserved. Plus, the arcade game supports multiple simultaneous players.\n\nMy opinion of the home port of MJ's Moonwalker has and always will be: disappointing.\n\nusername: Sure it could as easily be the SNES port, whatever. This is a wonderful arcade game to play with friends, seeing if you can push Dikembe Mutumbo to a quintuple double and watching your opponent (or yourself) start to lose it when one of you catches fire and things get completely out of hand.\n\nusername: Everyone considers '94 to be the best Genesis edition, mainly due to the actual gameplay part being the best. I say 93 is close enough in that regard, introduced (I believe) injuries to the experience, had the fighting that was cut from 94, and has rare injuries that result from fighting. For solo play that might not be enough but against friends fighting and injuring was a highlight I can't do without.\n\ndiplo: An absolute nightmare. There's not much special about PS2's dungeons, except that viewing the totality of a given one on a site like VGMaps might make you legitimately angry. PS2 has random enemy encounters, so the layouts don't need to account for dynamic enemy positioning. Therefore, dungeons must rely on creative geometry to generate interest. However, there's often a fierce dedication to symmetry/inverse mirroring (either in an individual floor plan or floors' plans in relation to one another), greatly lessening the possibility for surprises. Layering, overlapping, or revelatory interconnectivity in paths are pretty much nonexistent. Tension comes either from sheer dungeon size or the worry of reaching a dead end. Getting to a dead end means having to backtrack and risk more (drab) random fights. This is a kind of tension that is boring, purely attritional, and easily made. Compositionally, one of the worst Genesis soundtracks I've ever heard: it makes me feel like the death of music is happening in real-time. Thankfully, the composer, Tokuhiko Uwabo, stopped making music a few years after the release of PS2.\n\nToups: the music is sparse and minimal and is impressive to me because of its effective use of the genesis sound chip. I love FM synth sounds but lots of genesis soundtracks are made with such an awkward grasp of how to use FM synth that they sound all warbly and poorly mixed and weird. I also disagree with diplo because many of the compositions (though simple) feature interesting and unpredictable harmonic structures. lots of subtle, jazzy modulation which is used effectively to communicate the kind of ambiguous unease which is a major theme of the game.\n\nthe main thing about phantasy star II is how impressively atmospheric it is. it is a very minimal game; it only splurges on the monster designs and animations, which are among the most excellent I have seen from that era, and arguably the real star of the game. the massive and confusing dungeons populated with horrifying mutant creatures create a palpable sense of dread. the writing is sparse but actually pretty good and thoughtful and purposeful.\n\nJamesE: The only game in the series that stands up as being legitimately worthwhile without rose tints and childhood attachments - the music's great if you can dig dirty synth sounds (and I'm a total synth freak), your party moves at a snappy, quick pace and there's a neat system by which you can use macros in battle and execute special joint attacks. The whole thing moves with a really quick pace once you beat the first Dungeon and it'll probably feel like an awesome doujin game if you squint.\n\nusername: I remember my friend renting this game from the local video store one day and bringing it over. I don't know what it is but sailing around the Caribbean, slowly gathering a large force to rain havoc upon spanish colonies in search of treasure, gather treasure maps that could lead to finding your lost family, deciding whether to split the booty now or press on and risk a mutiny, watching your guy age and deciding whether it is better to retire with your dignity intact or press you luck and rapidly deteriorating skills for one more tour round the islands… I'm sorry, I think that was a sentence when I started. Whatever it is, I loved it and haven't found another game since that has scratched that particular itch quite as well.\n\nscratchmonkey: Horribly broken, in the sense that all you need to do is grind to get the best bike (it really only takes about 30-40 minutes to do so) and then it's all about learning the courses and not crashing — it's still great fun to bash the other riders with assorted weaponry and having the other races have names and faces goes a long way toward making the racing have some meaning to it. One of those series where the first game gets it so right than all the sequels are inevitably disappointments.\n\nSniper Honeyviper: I prefer the arcade version, but that's just me. The “layering” of the stages is better visually defined between the two planes of movement, preventing moments of confusion that lead to cheap deaths (though there are still plenty of those). Additionally, stage layouts are often more deliberately paced, with every aspect of them meticulously fine-tuned. Note that the two versions have completely different stages and should be considered two different games.\n\nTexican Rude: I really enjoyed Shining Force I because it was sort of SRPG lite. The worst part of any SRPG for me is all the meta-gaming you have to do. Delay the battle to level up your guys more (particularly your healer.) Balance a dozen character's equipment. SF1 is simple enough that I could handle the equipment stuff between missions. I also loved that it gets progressively more ridiculous in what you're doing. The world goes from whatever-fantasy to anything goes you get a super fast wolfman to help you with the stage involving a super laser. You get a baby dragon that could be super powerful, but takes a whole lot of work to make him that way.\n\nI can understand why SRPG fans might hate it, but as someone that would like to enjoy the genre but hates all the between mission stuff, I like it a lot.\n\nscratchmonkey: It's a super-basic RPG, yeah, and pretty generic in terms of art and setting and all. That said, I think it works pretty well as a “Starter” RPG. Even with the generic fantasy setting, it's got some personality and the basicness of it means that it's not very daunting to get into and get through.\n\nBroco: Sonic 1 is my favorite Sonic as well. It varies up the pacing more instead of aiming for nonstop speed, and it has a nice difficulty curve where you pick up lives in the earlier levels and lose them in the later ones. It's the only Sonic where I get more engaged as I get further in the game rather than less so.\n\nSchwere Viper: The one and only. Certainly slower than its successors, but has the best level design of the lot. Each zone has its own “personality,” challenging Sonic in a different way. It has enough variety to keep things fresh, and doesn't outstay its welcome at just under an hour long (for a relaxed session). Love or hate the 'hog, this is one of the most solid platformers on the system.\n\nBenoitRen: I think Sonic the Hedgehog has aged pretty well, because it relies more on platforming and momentum than going fast. Then Sonic the Hedgehog 2 added the spin dash and momentum-based platforming was largely thrown out through the window. […] The original game's zones have more personality to them than Sonic 2's. Sonic 2 just picks a theme and calls it a day, not really bothering with attractive art design. Hill Top is especially boring.\n\nwinkerwatson: I think select button maybe hates Sonic 2 now and I would say that it's something of a curate's egg. Metropolis Zone derails the games pacing entirely I feel. And Casino Night and Hilltop are two ideas that were far better executed in Sonic 3. But levels like Chemical Plant, Mystic Cave (best bottomless pit in the whole franchise) and Oil Ocean are all great in terms of music, unique level features and whatnot. From Sky Chase Zone on its a great precursor to the narrative of 3 and Knuckles.\n\nRonk: While the 3rd Game (with Knuckles) has more characters, more interesting levels and generally more going on, the second one is more aesthetically pleasing and easier to pick up and play anytime and goshdangit does it have the best soundtrack, seriously Sonic 2's soundtrack is the best on the Mega Drive, if not one of the best of all time and i'll fight everyone on this\n\nseven: sonic 2 has a compelling difficulty curve that's clearly designed to create an emotional arc and the sense that you're going on a journey (see: the break it provides in the form of casino night zone and hilltop zone), instead of boring arcade-style difficulty. sonic 1 has fucking labyrinth zone.\n\nsonic 2 makes the best use of a limited-lives system i've seen: game overs are an opportunity to learn new paths through old stages, grab extra lives and develop mastery, completing stages in under a minute to get continues. sonic 1's “replayability” is that it mocks you if you win without completing all the extra stages.\n\nthe Sonic 2 Experience is with friends at a party cheering you on as you invade a fortress in the sky and burn the stockpile of lives you've built up over the course of hours on a nail-biting final boss fight, everyone cheering as you just barely pull through. the Sonic 1 Experience is dying repeatedly at Marble Zone.\n\nthe key difference between them is that sonic 2 seems to care about the player having a good time.\n\nRudie: Really the only way to play these two games is the locked on catridges or a patched ROM. Has probably some of the smoothest level and wordless story progression in video games, and it came out in 1993/4. Having a second player as Tails isn't nearly as viable.\n\nFelix: I don't really like the overall design direction of Sonic 3 – the huge levels that somehow always give the impression of being on the worst available route, the addition of SRAM for the first time, the too-many shields and bonus stages – it's all a bit much. The S&K half is actually a lot more enjoyable for me (even if the last level is a little weak); it's probably the single best, comprehensive Sonic game design (CD is at least as strong but too weird and too inaccessible), and I think it suffers from always being counted as S3&K.\n\nscratchmonkey: Yes, the first one. Just a goofily-fun deathmatch game with a real sense of momentum once one of the players got one of the ships that was really good/that they were really good at. There was nothing more demoralizing than when one player ran off a string of multiple victories with a “shitty” ship.\n\nhandsomenattou: (Yuzo Koshiro at the very top of his game (i.e. Better soundtrack than any game that would come before or after), awesome grapple moves that make you feel like a god, perfect length. The best beat 'em up to come out of the golden age of beat 'em ups)\n\njodeaux: At any point in this game you can pause it and there will be some sort of interesting/arresting image to greet you. The amount of visual interest and the color palette is intriguing on it's own, but that's not even taking into account the fact that it sports the best soundtrack to a video game ever made. I will fight you to death on that point. It's like some sort of brawler/acid trip filtered through the minds of Japanese nerds conceiving of what a 12 yr old boy's idea of wish fulfillment would be in the wasteland of post-reagan America.\n\nTake It Sleazy: Still a singular game after all these years. An action roguelike with brilliant multiplayer mechanics that other roguelikes should be copying by now and this should be a genre good lord it's 20 years old come on you fucking nerds. It's also a rather clever inversion of the typical videogame cliche of a world filled with nothing but wandering monsters and treasures for the hero. A stellar soundtrack and a great sense of humor. Super ahead of it's time and the kind of SEGA-ness that made Nintendo just look sad and old.\n\nTalbain: If you like turn-based SRPGs, Warsong is a really unique take on the genre, given that it is not just commanders but commanders and units they command. Another really interesting design decision was to make all units disappear when the commanding unit disappears, allowing for some very strategic bosses and scenarios. Tons of unique units and progression paths, branching storyline with lots of different endings — lots to love.\n\nLick Meth: It's not a difficult game by any means (it's very easy to get through without losing a life), but instead it's more about the dazzlingly lovely marriage of a nice soundtrack and glorious display of colourful surroundings. Your co-op abilities either work as piggybacking your partner up cliffs, letting down a rope for the other to get up, or Mickey pulling Donald's fat arse through small gaps. It's not without problems, but it's nice enough to stop worrying for a bit with. Also features different level designs for Mickey/Donald/Co-op, for some variety.\n\nRenfrew: nails the aesthetic of early 90s X-men and everything it entails. The opening segments are one mind blowing idea after another. Turn on the game and it starts you in the first level with a random character! Unlock Magneto to team up with him because the threat is so great! I've never gotten particularly far in it, but I'm going to try again.\n\nSniper Honeyviper: Forgotten sequel to Another World where you play as the alien buddy from that game, and it even includes AW for good measure. I haven't played too far into it yet; it's definitely less subtle than AW, with a huge bombastic actiony intro, but the puzzle design definitely seems to be of the same caliber.\n\nUPDATE: I have done my research on this thing and played it more, and it's “irredeemable shit.” Never mind.\n\nSniper Honeyviper: Some extremely solid level design here, although the focus on exploring the stages rather than merely rushing through them is a bit of a buzz-kill in a Sonic game. There's a time-travel gimmick which allows you to visit four different versions of each stage, but it's mostly an excuse to have more pretty graphics and music. Ignore what everyone says, the US version's soundtrack is the best.\n\nSniper Honeyviper: Freaky experimental Knuckles game where you and a partner bungee through a level with Delicious Physics. The stages themselves feel sprawling and unfinished, but at least you've got the most beautiful 2D backdrops in the series to stare at, as well as some really cool polygonal bonus stages. A real curiosity, with one of the best FM synth Sonic soundtracks."
