        "text": "Post by Colonel Kurtz on\n\nI have two games on the Genesis, both from Konami, that display in a lower resolution than ALL the other MD/Genesis games: Turtles in time/Hyperstone Heist, and Sunset Riders. Other Konami games like Bloodlines do not display in this lower resolution. So please help me in answering these questions:\n\nWhat exactly is this lower resolution? ... And the most important:\n\nWhich other Genesis games used this lower resolution??? Are there even some other games that do?\n\nThanks, guise.\n\nThe resolution was smaller both horizontally and vertically, evidently. What is this sorcery?\n\nPost by kingmike on\n\nInteresting as TMNT and Sunset Riders were the first two Genesis games Konami made, I believe.\n\nI believe the Genesis only had two resolutions: 256x224 (32 tiles wide) and 320x224 (40 tiles wide).\n\nSupposedly a vertical resolution of 240 was also available on PAL consoles only.\n\nNever paid too much attention, but I'm sure there's more games that used the 256 mode (I know Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, which I made a fan-translation patch for, did).\n\nPost by Colonel Kurtz on\n\nThe guesstimate is usually about 15% of the games use the lower resolution.\n\nTHAT much!?! Do you have some examples, some names? The aim of this thread is to make a comprehensive list.\n\nPost by alphex on\n\nInteresting as TMNT and Sunset Riders were the first two Genesis games Konami made, I believe.\n\nAren't they also SNES ports? The SNES uses a lower resolution, y'know.\n\nPost by ommadawnyawn2 on\n\nFrom the MD thread at neogaf;\n\n\"Genesis games are 320x224. A few games are \"low-res\" 256x224\n\nList of low-res Genesis games:\n\nBart's Nightmare\n\nKrusty's Super Fun House\n\nMegaman the Wiley Wars\n\nMidnight Resistance\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers\n\nMonster World 4\n\nNew Zealand Story\n\nPat Riley Basketball\n\nRoad Rash\n\nSaturday Night Slam Masters\n\nScooby Doo\n\nShadow of the Beast 2\n\nShining on the Darkness\n\nShining Force\n\nShining Force 2\n\nSnake Rattle and Roll\n\nSnow Bros.\n\nSol Deace\n\nSplatterhouse 3\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation\n\nStreet Fighter 2’:champion edition\n\nSuper Street Fighter 2:The new challengers\n\nSuper Monaco GP\n\nSuper Volleyball\n\nSuper Battleship\n\nSuper Battletank\n\nSunset Riders\n\nVirtual Bart\n\nWonder Boy in Monster World\n\nDo you know others low-res games? (maybe japanese games) \"\n\nPost by Colonel Kurtz on\n\nI know of Castlevania Bloodlines, weirdly. Kurtz just said it didn't, but I remember that it does, at least briefly.\n\nBad memory on my part, then. I just tested with Wonder Boy Monster World, and yep, it works.\n\nommadawnyawn2: Thank you for the list. It's a great start. I'm testing each game, and the list is legit so far. Congrats to Neogaf.\n\nEDIT: Not so bad memory after all. Many full-screen bitmaps like the Konami logo, the demo text, and the progression map, are displayed in the lower resolution, that's true. But the game itself - the playing levels - are displayed in standard resolution, so I'd clearly classify it as a regular resolution game, but with some quirks. You were right, it uses low-res briefly, very briefly; but it does use it in some rare instances.\n\nSince it is the game levels themselves I'm looking for, I simply did not care for those logos in Bloodlines; and it seems like everybody did it anyway.\n\nPost by Colonel Kurtz on\n\nSome games use the low res mode JUST for the title screen. Looking at my personal collection of screenshots, I notice the following games:\n\nSonic CD\n\nRanger-X\n\nGranada\n\nI can upload if you want evidence\n\nYeah; it seems like artists found it easier to draw big full-screen bitmaps in a lower res, hence the logos and title screens. Maybe it was simply to gain some space on the ROM.\n\nAnyway, the mystery of \"Bloodlines\" is explained as a widely adopted practice among developers.\n\nPost by kingmike on\n\nInteresting as TMNT and Sunset Riders were the first two Genesis games Konami made, I believe.\n\nAren't they also SNES ports? The SNES uses a lower resolution, y'know.\n\nTMNT I know is not the same game, though it's similar.\n\nSunset Riders for Genesis I believe was released a year earlier (1992) than SNES (1993). Though both were based on the original arcade version (1991). I'm not too familiar with the arcade version, but I think the SNES version was a more faithful port while the Genesis version was kind of a remix (different levels). I think the Genesis version also only included two of the four playable characters while the SNES included all four, though it still only supported two players at a time (compared to the 4P arcade version). Not that it makes a HUGE difference, as I think they were basically two characters of two types. If I recall, one type had a more powerful shot while the other could shoot faster. Something like that."
