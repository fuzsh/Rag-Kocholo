        "text": "Posted on Nov 27th 2008 at 01:04:15 PM by (NESman93)\n\nPosted under Sega Genesis, video games, Sega, Genesis, classic gaming, review\n\nIn 1989, at a time when the NES was increasing even more in popularity, Sega, who already had some popularity in the United States with the 8-Bit Master System, and Arcade games such as Altered Beast and After Burner II, released a video game console that was meant to take on Nintendo's NES, the Genesis, which became one of the greatest 16-Bit consoles of all time.\n\nAt the time of it's release, Sega's main success was in the arcades, and overseas in the UK, where the Master System was extremely popular. On October 29, 1988, Sega release the MegaDrive in Japan. About a year later, on August 14, 1989, Sega release the Genesis in the United States. Sega pushed the Genesis on American consumers with the classic \"Genesis does what Nintendon't\" commercials. Those who paid the money for the system got the system, controllers, hookups, and the arcade port of Altered Beast. Many of the games released at launch were arcade ports and sports games. These include: Strider, Pat Riley Basketball, James \"Buster\" Douglas K.O. Boxing, and Michael Jackson's Moonwalker. The graphics of the system made people question why they were still playing on the old 8-Bit NES. Some kept their Nintendo's, and some took the leap into the 16-Bit era. Early in the Genesis' lifetime, Sega released a peripheral for the system called the Sega Power Base Converter. This peripheral slid into the cartridge port of the system an allowed the user to insert Sega Master System games into the converter, giving it backwards compatibility with practically all Master System games, and game Cards.\n\nAs the years went on, the Genesis saw some fierce competition coming from Nintendo, with their Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and NEC's TurboGrafx-16. Sega held on, however, and gained even greater popularity with the release of the game Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic was, as most today know, a blue, bad ass, in-your-face hedgehog, and was much more fierce when compared to Nintendo's little Italian plumber, Mario. Also, Sega was able to beat out Nintendo with one fighting game, Mortal Kombat. While the Genesis version of the game didn't look as good or sound as good as the SNES version, the Genesis version had full blood, and no censored fatalities.\n\nAs the Genesis passed into the 32-Bit era, Sega tried to keep up with the graphics of the more advanced systems. They began to push the games to their graphical limits, and even released a couple of add-ons to make the system more powerful. The first of the two was the Sega Mega CD, released in Japan in 1991, and released in the United States in 1992 as the Sega CD. As the name states, this add-on was a disc drive that attached to either the bottom of the model 1 Genesis or on the side of the model 2. The add-on also enabled the Genesis to play audio CDs. Most of the games on the Sega CD were crappy FMV (full motion video) games. Some of the better ones, however, were Sonic CD, Snatcher, The Terminator, and Mortal Kombat. Mortal Kombat on the Sega CD featured the same Genesis graphics, but arcade sounds, speech, and music. Later on, in 1994, Sega released the Sega 32X, which was inserted into the cartridge port of the Genesis, could play all of the regular 16-Bit games, and also had its own line of 32-Bit games such as Mortal Kombat II, Knuckle's Chaotix, Star Wars Arcade, Doom, and Virtua Fighter. These add-ons are infamous for their low amounts of killer titles, and extremely high prices at launch.\n\nIn closing, Sega made their greatest benchmark on the video game industry with the Genesis, and many gamers of today swear by the old Blast Processor. This system gets a 8/10.\n\nRecent Entries\n\nAnalytical Tools for Tracking Results in Aviator (8/23/2024)\n\nAviator Mobile Version: The Convenience of Gameplay Anytime, Anywhere (8/22/2024)\n\nHow to Create Your Own Gaming Blog and Earn Money (8/20/2024)\n\nHow to Find the Best Bookmaker for Live Betting with the Help of OnlineBetting (8/13/2024)\n\nIn Which I Describe Pizza Tower at an Exhaustingly Long Length (7/31/2024)\n\nNice read.\n\nYeah, MegaDrive/Genesis is pretty sweet. With all addons, it can use four different formats (or five, if you count SMS cartridges and cards separately), so the game library is huge. I'd say Genesis is best used for fighter games and platformers. The consoles and cartridges are sturdy and rarely break. Also, the systems, addons, and games, are cheap and easy to find; of course, that also means that like NES and SNES, Genesis is a very \"mainstream\" retro system, and many people have one (I like obscure stuff that nobody knows about).\n\nI have, in the past few years, gained more of an appreciation for the Genesis. But I'll always be more of a SNES fan.\n\nNice review. I'm surprised you didn't gave it a 10.\n\n@Nik the Russian:But, i only mentioned 3 add ons, where are you getting 5 formats. are you referring having a system with only 1 add on?\n\n@NESman93: Genesis Cart, 32X Cart, SCD CD, SCD32X CD, and SMS Cart. 5 formats (or 4, if you don't include the Sega Master System).\n\n@logical123:yeah, i didnt read the question close enough\n\n@logical123:\n\n6 if you include the Sega Master Cards as the Power Base Converter does both.\n\nThe Genesis is my favorite system. There's a ridiculous variety of games with the more arcade-styled gameplay I enjoy most.\n\n(By the way, the 32X was released in 1994, not 1992)\n\nExcellent review and one of my favorite systems. Nothing excites me more than finding genny games in the wild.\n\nI never could love the Genesis. Even with all the shooters for it and all the RPGs and strat games, just something about it always felt wrong. SNES wasnt perfect but it always felt better, even today it does.\n\nNo one would deny the Genesis' awesomeness. Especially for import gamers, the system had its share of positive aspects. After all, early games such as Warsong, the Valis games or Ys III had no region code, so you can play them on European systems - excellent. ^^ The only problem I'm having with the Genesis is its poor sound quality...its miles behind the SNES in that regard. Other than that, it's by far one of the greates video game systems of all time, period.\n\nNo, it deserves a 10/10.\n\nThe Mega Drive vs. the NES was a pretty easy decision to make. The year later the SNES comes out. What surprised me the most is that despite having come out a whole year later it couldn't match the Mega Drive for speed or number of sprites on screen at any one time. It wasn't until Donkey Kong Country came out and took full advantage of the systems graphical and audio capabilities.\n\nVery fond memories of the Mega Drive, playing a new game every week during its time and nearly all of them were pretty damn good if not great.\n\nWait, or was that two years later the SNES came out? Never mind. But yeah, the Mega Drive was definitely my favourite, but the SNES was also a great system too.\n\nDefinitely one of my all time favorite consoles!\n\nI wish I hadn't sold it off. But I was able to pick one up about a year ago from a friend at work, along with a NES, and a slew of games. I've been slowly rebuilding my Genny library of games: Phantasy Star 3, Aerobiz, Master of Monsters, and Mutant Leagues Football & Hockey (all from ebay). Got a long way to go...\n\nLogin or register to comment\n\nIt appears as though you are not a member of our site, or are not logged in.\n\nIt appears as though you can not comment currently.
