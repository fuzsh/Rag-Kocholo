        "text": "The Valis series (夢幻戦士ヴァリス, Mugen Senshi Varisu/Mugen Senshi Valis; known in America as \"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\") is a Japanese 2D action platform video game franchise developed by Telenet Japan. Its popularity has spanned four sequels, a spin-off, and remakes across several platforms.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMost of the games star the heroine Yuuko Asou, a normal second year schoolgirl from Japan who is summoned by the Valis sword (from where the series takes its name) to protect three worlds by using its power: Earth, the spirit world and the dream world known among the games as Vecanti.\n\nGames[]\n\nThe series consist of the games enlisted below:\n\nMugen Senshi Valis/ Valis the Fantasm Soldier\n\nMugen Senshi Valis II/ Valis the Fantasm Soldier II\n\nMugen Senshi Valis III/ Valis the Fantasm Soldier III\n\nMugen Senshi Valis IV/ Valis the Fantasm Soldier IV/ Super Valis IV\n\nValis SD/ Syd of Valis\n\nValis Visual Collection\n\nValis X\n\nValis Complete/ Valis Complete Plus\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection II\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection III\n\nOther media[]\n\nManga[]\n\nThe first manga of Valis was released on 1989. Little is known about it as there is almost no information on the internet. The only known things about it is that it's based on the first Valis game and was drawn by the original Valis artist designer Pixel.\n\nThere is also a short manga of Valis SD in the manual of the same game.\n\nA new manga series for Valis illustrated by ZOL was released in 2008 by Kill Time Communications and featured in the seinen manga magazine Comic Valkyrie.\n\nMerchandising[]\n\nIn 2006, a figurine of Yuuko was included within the Valis Complete gamebox. In 2008, NCSX Millenium toys corporation released two collections of Valis PVC figurines, the first having Yuuko and Reiko and the second having Yuuko (with two forms), Cham and Valna.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReception[]\n\nMost of the games had a great reception and a great advertising in Japan, making it the emblematic series of Telenet Japan and one of the most popular for the PC-engine game console. Contrary to there, the series didn't have too much promotion and/or popularity in America or Europe. Even so, at the time it became popular between many fans all over the world (mostly thanks to the internet and game magazines).\n\nTrivia[]\n\nOn December 2009, Sunsoft acquired the entire game catalog of Telenet Japan, having plans for re-launching many of their games including the Valis series ones for the Wii's virtual console.\n\nThe series was one of the firsts to introduce the \"magical warrior swordswoman\" concept to the Japanese fiction; this concept served later as an example for many anime series in the 90's.\n\nAlthough the series wasn't too popular at launch, its fanbase grew in the last years, even trying the creation of fangames.\n\nA common extra in the PCE-CD versions of the series is that in the debug menu in the messages option, you can hear an extra message from the seiyuus (voice actors) of the characters giving greetings to the public.\n\n[]"
