        "meta_description": "When it comes to video games that end up getting plenty of sequels, most of the time, the series gets better with each installment, further improving on what was done previously and making a better product as a result. With the Valis franchise, on the other hand, it seems like the exact opposite of that. I did really enjoy my time with the original Valis, and I do think it was a pretty good game, but the further we go along in this series, the worse and worse it tends to get. Sure, none of the games are outright bad, but it just seems like it isn’t going to get better any time soon, which can be seen clearly with this installment of the series. Rather than jumping straight into Valis IV, I figured I would take a detour from the main story for a bit, and I decided to check out a bit of an odd title of out the bunch, Syd of Valis.<br><br>For those who are unaware, this game is a demake of Valis II, with it being made specifically for the Sega Genesis only, and it now uses a chibi art style for all of the characters. Going into this demake, I had known that this game had a pretty bad reputation, even from back when it originally came out, but I was somewhat looking forward to it. I am a big fan of chibi art-styles, as you could probably tell by the profile picture I often use on the internet (Mega Man Powered Up), so it was already winning me over in that regard, so I hoped that it would win me over in other ways. However, that was not the case, as this is definitely the worst game in the series so far, and at the end of the day, I can only really say it is ok.<br><br>The story is basically the exact same as the original Valis II, except this time told in bullet points with much more simplistic cutscenes and visuals, which I would complain about, except the original story wasn’t that complex as is, so it doesn’t matter, the graphics are definitely my favorite part of the game, as it has that chibi art-style I mentioned earlier, and I love it so much, but the rest of the game still looks pretty good aside from that, the music is fine for the most part, although a lot of it does suffer from that good ol’ Genesis twang, so if you are not a fan of that, you may wanna mute the game then, the control is simple enough, but sometimes you running speed can be way too fast when it comes to dealing with enemies, and the game is pretty similar to that of the original, except with a few changes that do make it stand out a little more.<br><br>For the most part, the gameplay remains the same as Valis II, where you take control of Yuko once again (who they refer to as Syd in the game, even though that is completely wrong), take on five different stages each with several sections to them, take down many different enemies before you using your main sword weapon and its limitless amount of projectiles, gather plenty of health items, powerups, and upgrades to give you an edge over the foes that you will face, and take on plenty of bosses that, for the most part, are manageable, but some of them can be pretty annoying. It is as standard as a Valis game can be for the most part, and as such, if you have played any other game in the series, you mostly know what you will get out of this title. That being said, it was still fun for a good bit, and there are some new features that I wish were actually in other Valis games aside from this one.<br><br>Powerups in Syd of Valis work a little differently then they do in any other Valis game. Rather then simply picking them up and using them after they drop from enemies, you actually gain these powerups from certain bosses after you defeat them, and you will have access to them for the remainder of the game, being able to swap between them anytime you want. Not only that, but you also get new suits of armor that increase your defense and speed, along with power crystals which can make your attacks even stronger, and whenever you do change out your weapon and armor, there are stats on the screen that let you know how strong they are compared to others. This, in my opinion, is a really cool feature, and one that I wish was in all of the other Valis games at this point. Sure, the old method is fine enough, but again, I’m sure we have all had those moments where we accidently grab a powerup we don’t want to use, and we feel depressed as a result, so having them work like this is a much better alternative in my opinion.<br><br>Unfortunately though, that is about the extent of positive things that I can name about Syd of Valis as a whole, as it has plenty of shortcomings that bring it down significantly. The game is way too short, with you being able to blaze through levels and bosses in no time, the story is, again, dumbed down exponentially to where it feels like it doesn’t mean anything anymore, there is no more voice acting, which is understandable since it is a Genesis game, but still, and of course, as is Valis tradition, nothing is done too much to further expand upon the gameplay, and it just gives you more of the same as before. Really, the only reason anyone could potentially want to seek out this game is because of the chibi art-style, which is a great art-style, but that can only do so much for the game at the end of the day. If I wanted to just admire the visuals and nothing else, then I would just watch a YouTube video instead, so the game has to pick up the slack in that respect.<br><br>Overall, despite the appealing art-style and improved powerup and armor system, Syd of Valis is definitely a demake in the most literal sense, being inferior to the original in many ways, while not really updating too much about to make players want to check it out even if they had already played the original. I guess I could recommend it for huge Valis fans, but aside from them, there isn’t really anyone else that this remake could appeal to, so I would just stick with the original any day. Which even then, the original Valis II isn’t even all that good either, so it’s a lose lose situation at the end of the day. Although, I will say this, I did find it interesting seeing these enemies that were stolen and used in those Pokemon bootlegs that <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zJD9B0za9k&amp;pp=ygUPam9udHJvbiBwb2tlbW9u'>JonTron covered a while back</a> (skip to the 3:43 mark). I learned something new today, I’ll tell you that.<br><br>Remake #7",
