Fantasm Soldier Valis II) is an action game developed and published by Telenet Japan for various popular Japanese home computers in 1989. Though believed to have started development before the TurboGrafx-16 version known simply as Valis II, it was published afterward, and is a distinctly different game from the home console version. The Sharp X68000 version came out considerably later, and has some modifications to improve the graphics and shorten some of the longer stages. It also adds voice samples and runs smoother than the 8-bit counterparts.\n\nIn this home computer version, Yuko is capable of collecting multiple outfits and weapons and retaining them. She can switch between them at will on a menu screen. Each weapon and several suits have multiple levels. In addition, Yuko is also capable of picking up and learning different magic spells.\n\nLike the home console version, it tells the story of Megas’ invasion to Vecanti. Unlike the other version, it ramps up the nudity and violence to previously unseen (in the Valis series) degrees. It’s the only game in the classic series to feature actual semi-nudity, and it’s also the most bloody of them all. Whereas the TurboGrafx-16 version depicts Megas as some kind of tragic anti hero who finally dies in Yuko’s arms, here he is much more sadistic with a mad robot chameleon as an adviser.\n\nTitle screen\n\nScreenshot\n\nCut scene\n\nTable of Contents"
