This document provides a personal account of the development of the nitrous oxide-acetylene flame for atomic absorption spectroscopy by J.B. Willis. \n\n[1] Willis began working with atomic absorption spectroscopy in 1958 and experimented with various flame types, initially using air-coal gas and air-acetylene flames. He developed new burner and nebulizer designs to improve the technique. \n\n[2] In the early 1960s, Willis sought to develop flames capable of atomizing metals like aluminum that were not effectively atomized in air-acetylene flames. He experimented with oxygen-acetylene and oxygen-enriched air-acetylene flames, and collaborated with other researchers exploring high",
