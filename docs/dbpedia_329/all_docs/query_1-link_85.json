        "text": "In the latest blog in our series, and to celebrate International Women's Day, we chatted to Jodie Walsh, one of our Data and Analytics Consultants about her experiences as a woman in tech, how she has evolved her career goals over time and how Inciper has enabled her to progress.\n\n1.) How long have you been working in tech?\n\nInciper is the first technology-focused organisation I have worked in. Before this, I was part of an internal data team within a mergers and acquisitions firm for 5 years.\n\n2.) How did you get started working in tech?\n\nWith an analytical type of brain, I’ve always had a keen interest in the hows and whys - the mechanics and logic behind everything. I started off as an administrative assistant and would say this is when I started to develop my technical skill, immersing myself in reporting, data management and CRM administration. Over the following years, I progressed into a more technologically focused role. I received dedicated training and mentorship in data and BI reporting, taking opportunities to be inquisitive and learn from the expertise around me.\n\n3.) Do you have a qualification related to your job?\n\nI have a degree in Mathematics which has given me a foundational knowledge in logical thinking and problem solving which are well-utilised in technical roles. Mathematics forms the basis of computer and data sciences and as such is a desirable qualification that many employers will look for.\n\n4.) How did you arrive at Inciper?\n\nDue to the pandemic, I was made redundant and found myself looking for a new challenge.\n\n5.) Describe your progression opportunities at Inciper\n\nI was initially employed in a hybrid role at Inciper - my primary responsibility was as a Managed Services Analyst and my secondary focus was progressing down the Data and Analytics route. In this role, I’ve been able to provide both D&A project support and develop my skills in this area, whilst also familiarising myself with our existing clients and the natural flow between implementation and Managed Services.\n\nI’ve now successfully transitioned to the Data and Analytics team full time, thanks to the guidance and training received as well as being provided the space to focus, explore, gain certifications and experience. With the everchanging spectrum of technologies available and improvements made to those technologies, there is a continued opportunity to further my own understanding and knowledge and apply these across a multitude of market sectors.\n\n6.) Describe what you do at Inciper in one sentence?\n\nI am a Data and Analytics Consultant, responsible for working in partnership with clients to deliver quality solutions befitting of their data management and analytical reporting requirements through the use of Microsoft technologies - from data warehousing through to data modelling and down to report design and creation.\n\n7.) What’s the best part of your job?\n\nSeeing the difference made and value added by the solutions we’ve implemented, particularly with reporting as it is such a tangible asset offering near-immediate obvious benefit due its visual nature.\n\n8.) What’s so cool about Microsoft technology?\n\nThe vast variety of offerings and integration between Microsoft technologies is impressive. The continued expansion of low to no-code GUIs make these offerings far more accessible. Microsoft are at the forefront of innovation which makes for some very exciting progress in relatively new areas of technology.\n\n9.) Who’s your tech hero?\n\nAlan Turing and the Bletchley Park Codebreakers. Turing set the standard for modern day computers, using his own knowledge and research into mathematics to create the Turing Machine – capable of computing algorithms. Turing worked with GCHQ at Bletchley to (repeatedly) crack the German Enigma code in WWII (the code would change every day and hence large computing power was required).\n\nTuring went on to further the field of computational theory and we still see his name in technology today. For example, the requirement for computers to be “Turing-complete” and the “Turing Test” in artificial intelligence – the name given to the judgement on whether a machine is intelligent or not.\n\nThough he may be an obvious choice, this is a man we can always afford to celebrate a little more, especially in light of his mistreatment after his ground-breaking contributions to the war effort. Of course, I can’t talk about Alan Turing without mentioning the many women who also worked at Bletchley feeling the urge to join the war effort and forming the team of human codebreakers."
