        "text": "Grattan B 3 Blackpool Celtic 1\n\nHALF-TIME substitute Alan Walsh came on to grab a hat-trick which helped Grattan B lift the City Challenge Cup with a victory over Blackpool Celtic in a competitive final at St Colman’s Park.\n\nGrattan B were beaten finalists last season when they went down to Cathedral Celtic in the final at the Cross, so for them, there was some unfinished business to attend to on Saturday.\n\nFrom the off, both sides made their presence felt when at one end, Chris O’Callaghan’s firmly struck effort went straight at Scott O’Shea while at the other end, Gavin Duggan drilled a solid effort at the well-positioned William Matthews.\n\nA terrific chance fell for Grattan B when Jamie Carroll found himself in on goal, but he rifled against the woodwork to waste a gilt-edge opportunity.\n\nGrattan were to rue this big miss as the impressive Eoin Duke got away on the right before crossing for Ali who touched home the opener on just seven minutes.\n\nA response from Grattan then saw Richie O’Hare combine with Jamie Carroll before skewing an effort wide of the target.\n\nAnother chance then fell for Carroll, but he just could not manage to get his feet together to crack an effort on target.\n\nMinutes later, Carroll noticed Matthews off his line and tried to loop his effort into the net from distance, but it was all in vain.\n\nA ball then over the top fell for Eoin Duke, but he skewed wide after narrowing the angle too much for himself.\n\nAnother ball into space looked like it was falling for Duke again, but he left it go for the available Kyle O’Keeffe who pulled the trigger too prematurely instead of carrying it another few yards, so a chance went.\n\nA nice Blackpool move followed after that when O’Callaghan found O’Keeffe with a lovely pass and after O’Keeffe helped on for Duke, the winger fired straight into the arms of O’Shea.\n\nBlackpool were playing good football and enjoyed possession when after Kyle O’Keeffe’s effort never bothered O’Shea, Ali showed good control before rifling wide.\n\nAnd when a lovely delivery from Corey Caffery found Duke in space down the right channel, the winger’s effort to fire a forceful low cross for Ali went off Troy Barry before arriving into the arms of Scott O’Shea.\n\nJust before the break, a great chance fell for Blackpool when Ali exchanged passes with Eoin Duke before thumping a low effort wide of the far post to waste an opportunity.\n\nWith both sides exchanging control over the first ten minutes of the second period, Grattan found a way back into the game when substitute Alan Walsh was accorded a second bite of the cherry before drilling home the equaliser to make it honours even once again.\n\nWhat a chance fell for Blackpool’s Ali after that.\n\nA misunderstanding in the Grattan defence accorded the Blackpool Celtic striker freedom on the ball and as the goal gaped, he somehow managed to skew wide.\n\nThis miss came back to haunt Blackpool as Grattan B took the lead when Alan Walsh was played into space by Dan Broderick before lifting over the advancing William Matthews to hand Grattan the lead on 72 minutes.\n\nOne minute later, Blackpool Celtic were rocked right back on their heels when Gavin Duggan reached Walsh who got there first over Matthews to poke home his side’s third as well as finish off his hat-trick and make it 3-1 on 73 minutes.\n\nBlackpool had a chance to reduce the arrears soon after, but from a cross, Ali headed wide while unattended before Clive Greens saw his low effort, well held by O’Shea.\n\nBlackpool were pressing hard now and what a chance they had to get one back when Ali found himself in front of a gaping target, but he somehow hooked over what was the final chance for Blackpool.\n\nShortly after, referee Tony Thompson brought closure to an entertaining final.\n\nGRATTAN B: Scott O’Shea, Jimmy O’Brien, Simon Deady, Troy Barry, Adrian Duggan, Steven Harris, Richie O’Hare, Dan Broderick, Jamie Carroll, Gavin Duggan, Danny Whittington.\n\nSubs: Alan Walsh for Jamie Carroll (half-time), Trevor O’Brien for Richie O’Hare (65), David Forde for Jimmy O’Brien (85).\n\nBLACKPOOL CELTIC: William Matthews, Corey Caffery, Cillian O’Connor, Billy Murphy, Craig Horgan, Fionn Murphy, Eoin Duke, Kyle O’Keeffe, Abnel Karin Abdul Ali, Chris O’Callaghan, Luke Delaney.\n\nSubs: Jay Hawthorne for Cillian O’Connor (70), Scott Duggan and Clive Greene for Billy Murphy and Corey Caffery (77).\n\nReferee: Tony Thompson.\n\nAssistants: Alan McDonagh and Conchur O’Conghaile.\n\nFourth Official: Paul O’Sullivan."
