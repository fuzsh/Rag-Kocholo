        "text": "Prineha Narang, Assistant Professor of Computational Materials Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) has been named to MIT Technology Review’s prestigious annual list of Innovators Under 35.\n\n“MIT Technology Review inherently focuses on technology first - the breakthroughs and their potential to disrupt our lives,” said Gideon Lichfield, editor-in-chief of MIT Technology Review. “Our annual Innovators Under 35 list is a chance for us to honor the outstanding people behind those technologies. We hope these profiles offer a glimpse into what the face of technology looks like today as well as in the future.”\n\nNarang, who joined SEAS in 2017, develops novel quantum engineered materials and devices with applications in sensing and photodetection, energy conversion, as well as quantum information processing. Her research is at the exciting intersection of computational materials science, condensed matter theory, quantum chemistry and quantum photonics.\n\nBefore joining SEAS, Narang was a Ziff Environmental Fellow at the Harvard University Center for the Environment and a Research Scholar in Condensed Matter Theory in the MIT Department of Physics, working on new theoretical methods to describe quantum interactions. She holds an S.M and Ph.D. in Applied Physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) where she worked on light-matter interactions.\n\nNarang joins a prestigious group of past honorees, including colleagues Conor Walsh, Robert Wood, and Donhee Ham, and former SEAS student and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg."
