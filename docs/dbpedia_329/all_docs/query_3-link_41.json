When applied to frequency stabilization of microwave oscillators, this technique enabled more than two orders of magnitude improvement in oscillator phase noise performance relative to the previous state-of-the-art. At the beginning of the 90s, the West Australian company Poseidon Scientific Instruments (PSI) licensed the phase noise suppression technique from the UWA. For over a decade, PSI remained the manufacturer of the lowest phase noise microwave oscillators. In 2012, the US defence contractor Raytheon acquired PSI and oscillator noise suppression technology rights to “enhance its defence capabilities.”\n\nIn 2022, the South Australian company QuantX Labs (former Cryoclock) signed an agreement with the UWA to resume manufacturing microwave oscillators with interferometric signal processing."
