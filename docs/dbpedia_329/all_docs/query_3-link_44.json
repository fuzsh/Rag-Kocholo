        "text": "Alan Budney is a Professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and Director of the T32 Predoctoral and Postdoctoral Training Program in the Science of Co-occurring Disorders. He received his PhD in Clinical Psychology from Rutgers University and did his postdoctoral training at the University of Vermont. He has conducted extensive research on the development and evaluation of innovative behavioral treatments for Cannabis Use Disorders in adults and adolescents. This programmatic research has focused on integrating innovative contingency management interventions with more traditional behavioral therapies and using computer-assisted therapies to enhance access to and the cost effectiveness of these approaches. He has also conducted human laboratory and survey studies characterizing cannabis use and withdrawal. His recent work leverages social media enrollment strategies to assess the impact of the changing legal landscape of cannabis, to develop on-line interventions for cannabis use problems, and to develop methods for accurately measuring cannabis consumption to inform more meaningful public health messaging about the potential negative and positive consequences of cannabis use. Dr. Budney was President of Division 28 and Division 50 of the American Psychological Association and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence. He was a member of the DSM-5 Substance Use Disorders working group and has served on numerous scientific reviews at the NIH and other institutions. He is currently on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Center for Medical Cannabis Research at the University of California San Diego. Dr. Budney has also been an active member of many community task forces targeting reduction in delinquency, violence, and substance use problems.\n\nDr. Budney is an avid sports fan and enjoys the theatre. He will play golf with anyone interested whenever possible, enjoys downhill skiing when not injured, and would love to BBQ if youâ€™d like to stop by his home in Charlotte, VT."
