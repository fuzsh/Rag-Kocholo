        "text": "Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy is an analytical technique used for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the elements present in different samples like food, nanomaterials, biomaterials, forensics, and industrial wastes. The main aim of this book is to cover all major topics which are required to equip scholars with the recent advancement in this field. The book is divided into 12 chapters with an emphasis on specific topics. The first two chapters introduce the reader to the subject, it's history, basic principles, instrumentation and sample preparation. Chapter 3 deals with the elemental profiling, functions, biochemistry and potential toxicity of metals, along with comparative techniques. Chapter 4 discusses the importance of sample preparation techniques with the focus on microextraction techniques. Keeping in view the importance of nanomaterials and refractory materials, chapters 5 and 6 highlight the ways to characterize these materials by using AAS. The interference effects between elements are explained in chapter 7. The characterizations of metals in food and biological samples have been given in chapters 8-11. Chapter 12 examines carbon capture and mineral storage with the analysis of metal contents."
