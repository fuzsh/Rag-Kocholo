Informit pays deep respect to their Ancestors and Elders, past and present. We extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples upon whose lands and waters we conduct our business.\n\nWe recognise that the Kulin peoples have been practicing their culture, caring for Country and sharing knowledge through the generations since time immemorial. Informit is excited by the revitalisation of Indigenous Knowledges that is underway. We are committed to promoting achievements of Indigenous scholars, building strong relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations, and supporting Indigenous-led ways of knowing, being and doing.\n\nArtwork Birrarung Biik by Lewis Wandin-Bursill, Wurundjeri"
