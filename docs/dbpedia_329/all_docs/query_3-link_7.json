        "text": "Completely agreed on the above assessment. When considering the security of a device's wireless and/or wired interfaces, a direct internet connection may seem to provide the greatest risk of exposure. However, it is important to keep in mind that such connections are likely to possess the most up to date, industry accepted security measures. The fallacy lies in assuming that wired interfaces are somehow more secure and thus do not require the same levels of rigor. Such thinking is based on the assumption that someone else will ensure the security of whatever networks devices are wired into. Unfortunately, this is simply not true. A quick look through cybersecurity headlines shows that internal networks get breached regularly, and unsecured \"hardware targets\" are low hanging fruits for attackers. Furthermore, lack of over the air firmware update capabilities place significant burden on the manufacturer's ability to perform an update at all, as devices with wired-only interfaces will require some accompanying software element that can be deployed on the host device (possibly not under the manufacturer's control), which can perform a software update.\n\n3\n\nI wonder if we could set a record through the power of #linkedin and the #medtech community by helping two lucky Test Engineers land successfully....lighting FAST üëÄ We are helping a Global Med-Tech org hire 2 Entry-Level Test Engineers for what intends to be a lengthy assignment.

With the FDA‚Äôs QMSR ruling of 02 Feb this year, greater emphasis has been placed upon the needs of Risk Management for Medical Devices. This being one of my favourite topics for the importance within Medical Device development, Risk Management (alongside the Design Controls process) are often being treated and regarded as, ‚Äùthose painful document deliverables we need to have‚Ä¶‚Äù rather than the tools they can and should be to drive the development process. But when to start them? ISO 14971:2019 (and ISO 13485:2016) define the life cycle (that the standards are applicable to) as ‚Äú..from the initial conception‚Ä¶‚Äù, yet the FDA‚Äôs QS Reg wording from 1996 defined in the preamble a period of research, ‚Äúcreativity and innovation‚Äù that the FDA would not expect design control requirements. With the QMSR, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the FDA does not expect manufacturers to maintain records of all changes proposed during the very early stages of the design process‚Ä¶‚Äù. Although many manufacturers appreciate this caveat, I‚Äôll be describing the risks (pun absolutely intended) of missing important design knowledge during those early design iterations and using the analogy of Agile Project Management processes to show. With an emphasis on Risk Management and the Design Control Processes as tools for development, rather than the perceived documentation need, I believe that focus on the activity and effort for the two will aid to deliver safe, effective and high-quality Medical Devices. I‚Äôll walk through a detailed (and colourful!) flow-diagram for how this all comes together.\n\n8\n\nDemystifying Pre-Compliance Testing for Medical Devices: Your Guide to IEC 60601 Ensuring the safety and efficacy of your medical device is paramount. But navigating the world of regulatory compliance can feel overwhelming. This article dives into understanding pre-compliance testing for medical devices according to IEC 60601, a crucial step in your journey to market. **What is IEC 60601?** The IEC 60601 series is the international gold standard for medical electrical equipment safety. It outlines essential performance and basic safety requirements to minimize risks to patients, operators, and bystanders. **Why Pre-Compliance Testing Matters** Pre-compliance testing allows you to proactively identify and address potential issues before formal certification testing. This saves time, money, and avoids last-minute design changes. **Key Areas of Pre-Compliance Testing (IEC 60601-1 Focus):** * **Electrical Safety:** Leakage currents, grounding, and potential for electric shock. * **Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC):** Your device's immunity to electromagnetic interference and its own emissions that could disrupt other equipment. * **Mechanical Safety:** Sharp edges, crushing hazards, and stability during use. * **Usability:** Ensuring clear instructions, intuitive controls, and suitability for the intended user. * **Risk Management:** Proactive identification and mitigation of potential hazards throughout the device lifecycle. **Benefits of Proactive Pre-Compliance Testing:** * **Increased Confidence:** Gain peace of mind knowing your device is on track for compliance. * **Reduced Costs:** Identify and fix issues early to avoid expensive redesign later. * **Faster Time to Market:** Avoid delays caused by certification test failures. * **Improved Product Quality:** Pre-compliance testing helps ensure a safer, more reliable device. #MedicalDevices #IEC60601 #PreComplianceTesting #MedicalDeviceSafety #RegulatoryAffairs #Research #medtech #emiemc\n\n16\n\n2 Comments\n\nSo I asked a question, What if a #SaMD manufacturer submits using ESTAR and says #Cybersecurity doesn't apply? What is the manufacturers experience going to be?\" as a member of the audience during the recent #Medcon panel on cybersecurity panel attended by Matthew Hazelett, Edison Alvarez, and moderated by Eric Henry. The funny answer was framed as a yelp review, 0 out of 5 stars don't recommend. The more serious answer, you're going to be RTA rejected and you'll be in a bad position because you'll then be doing a post-mortem on your device's cybersecurity rather than developing it as part of the device. So not only will your submission be RTA rejected, FDA will assume you got off on the wrong foot and focus even more on your resubmission. #FDA #MCRA #medtech #medicaldevice #regulatory #FDAsubmission #digitalhealth\n\n48\n\n2 Comments\n\nWorking with these regulations daily, I can see Farhad's point. While my colleagues and I do our best to support startups through the compliance process, navigating these regulations requires a structured approach (and thinking) from management. A clear understanding of timelines and effective planning are absolutely essential for success. MedTech project management is less flexible than other sectors, which can be a major hurdle for new project managers entering the field. The good news is, the FDA has addressed this challenge (and therefore, we do not need to reinvent the wheel!)! They've implemented parallel regulatory pathways specifically designed to streamline the approval process for smaller businesses. Sure, these paths still demand high-quality work, but they recognize the limitations of startups and offer valuable assistance programs, like the SBIA initiatives from both CDER and CBRH. The EU could learn a lot from this approach. A similar streamlined system would significantly reduce the burden on startups and foster a more innovative environment. Let's hope to see this happen soon!\n\n8\n\nThere are many valuable sections of the Basic Lateral Flow Training course, but here's why I think the unit I teach on is so important. When it comes to Cassette Design, you will find that this single device will either enhance or ruin your assay. You may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to make your assay work perfectly in the lab. But if your assay doesn't work in your cassette, then it's worthless. In just a few minutes, I share a few key areas of cassette design that will save you from making common mistakes; mistakes that could cost you more than our entire course. I'll show you what causes an assay to not flow properly or consistantly and I'll show you how to mitigate these issues. You will be equiped with knowledge that can be used immediately to review your own cassette design. It's a win all around!\n\n5\n\nü§• All models lie. Some are useful. This is also true for these models we use when building medical devices: ‚ñ∂ ISO 14971 ‚ñ∂ IEC 62304 ‚ñ∂ STRIDE threat classification model ‚ñ∂ Design Controls All of these contain models. They are useful, but they also lie. I've seen so many teams struggle with this that I think it's really important. What do I mean by \"lie\"? To answer this, let's first define \"model\". I find it useful to define a model as \"a simplified description of reality that is useful for some purpose.\" (Definitions are models too.) A model is \"lying\" when it doesn't fit reality. In software speak, it's a \"leaky abstraction\". Have you ever debated whether: ‚ñ∂ something (e.g., a delay in patient care) is a hazardous situation or a harm? ‚ñ∂ a software item definition aligns with the source code? ‚ñ∂ a threat is Spoofing or an Elevation of privilege? ‚ñ∂ a requirement is actually a user need? These debates happen because reality is more complicated than our models. And that's okay. What matters is that the models are useful. To resolve the debates like this happen, go back to the \"why\". Once you know the purpose of the activity, it is usually easy to frame the discussion in a more productive way. But before we are able to reframe the discussion, we need to first recognize that we're working with models. They \"lie\". Has your team ever gotten stuck in these types of debates? What strategies have been useful for you to make these models useful?

Drive it for the carbon footprint. But more importantly drive it for the fun factor. It‚Äôs a great experience. Jim Farley hits it right on the nose. Don‚Äôt let bad political rhetoric kill the EV industry. It‚Äôs the future. And it does not have to be the only option. I believe that alternatives are part of the consumer choice. If built well with good infrastructure the consumer will naturally choose. But attacks on EV owners are not warranted just as a few years ago attacks on gas guzzlers were counter productive. Let things develop on their own. Just engineer quality products either good user experience. https://lnkd.in/eMURPktM\n\n1\n\nAnyone coming from a traditional software development background is amazed at the \"overhead\" of medical device development. But it's not overhead, it's the law to meet regulations and to have a safe and effective product. === Title: Compare challenges of medical device software development vs traditional software development Developing medical device software presents several unique challenges compared to traditional software development: 1. Regulatory Compliance: Medical device software must adhere to strict regulatory standards (e.g., FDA regulations in the United States) for safety, efficacy, and quality. This involves extensive documentation, validation, and verification processes that are not typically required in traditional software development. 2. Risk Management: Medical devices often have higher stakes in terms of patient safety. Therefore, risk management is critical throughout the software development lifecycle to identify and mitigate potential hazards. 3. Complexity of Requirements: Medical device software must meet specific functional and non-functional requirements related to accuracy, reliability, interoperability, and security. These requirements are often more stringent than those for traditional software. 4. Validation and Verification: Validating and verifying medical device software involves rigorous testing and validation against predefined requirements and standards. This process is more extensive and formalized compared to traditional software testing. 5. Long Development Lifecycles: Due to regulatory requirements and the need for thorough testing and validation, the development lifecycle of medical device software can be longer and more complex than that of traditional software. 6. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Medical device software development often requires collaboration between software engineers, biomedical engineers, healthcare professionals, regulatory experts, and other stakeholders. This interdisciplinary approach adds complexity to project management and communication. 7. Post-Market Surveillance: Unlike traditional software, medical device software requires continuous monitoring and post-market surveillance to ensure ongoing safety and effectiveness after deployment. In summary, while both types of software development share commonalities in terms of coding and project management, medical device software development requires additional considerations and adherence to regulatory standards to ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance. === Note: ChatGPT completely missed the importance of cybersecurity for medical device software. The regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity were significantly enhanced late last year.\n\n7\n\n1 Comment\n\nüöÄ Accelerating Medical Device Development with In-Silico Testing üöÄ The journey of bringing a medical device from concept to market is intricate and challenging, often involving extensive testing phases that can significantly extend product development timelines.
