        "text": "Teacher Spotlight\n\nTeacher Spotlight\n\nOur campus has amazing educators that will be featured weekly in this section. Our hope is for you to enjoy learning more about the those working closely with your child.\n\nJoseph Bauer\n\nI’m an 8th grade Science teacher at Walsh. This was my fourth year at the campus. I served as an instructional assistant and 7th grade Science teacher during my first year and an 8th grade Science and U.S. History teacher the year after. Luckily, I can say that I am finishing my second year of full devotion to 8th grade Science this year. This is incredibly fortunate, given my wide range of science puns. Uranium carbon?…you know, because their chemical symbols are U & C (as in: you see)…well, I didn’t promise they were “good” puns!\n\nI’m a born and raised Central Texan from a family of educators. I graduated and received my credentials from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016. As a result, you can frequently find me on an emotional roller coaster on Saturdays in the fall rooting for my Longhorns. Outside of school, I love reading authors like Hemingway and Dumas, hiking in our state parks, chowing down at just about any taco or BBQ joint, and knocking out a morning crossword puzzle. Above all, I love traveling with my partner, Jonaphine, a soon-to-be medical resident who has been my better half since my days at UT. Lastly, I do admit to a guilty pleasure of shutting myself in with a good science or history documentary, so if there are any suggestions, let us know! Till then, adios folks!\n\nDawn Chapa\n\nHi everyone! This is my 6th year at Walsh Middle School. I was a special education inclusion teacher for five years and had the opportunity to co-teach with some amazing people. I currently teach Texas History and have loved the challenge to learn and grow as an educator. I am also one of the sponsors for FCA at Walsh. I have lived in Round Rock for 28 years. I have three beautiful daughters. Chloe, my oldest, is a graduate from Texas A&M (Whoop) and is also a teacher. Sydney, my middle, is currently a student at The University of North Texas (go Eagles). My youngest, Ashley, will be a junior at Cedar Ridge High school this fall. Ashley will be the Social officer President for Royalty and I spend a lot of my time watching her dance. I am her #1 FAN!!\n\nI also have three dogs, Max, Mia, and Charlee. I love to travel and learn new things. I enjoy spending time with my family, going on walks and reading. Moreover, my favorite hobbies are cooking and baking. My favorite food is pizza and my absolute favorite place to be is the beach!! My favorite thing about teaching is the relationships I build with my students. People call me crazy for teaching middle school but it’s my favorite age! I feel it’s important to make a difference in these students’ lives. However, I quickly realized that these students have a huge impact on my life as well! I love that my students refer to me as “Mama Chapa”. I am so blessed to be a part of the Walsh family. I am grateful to have the opportunity to be surrounded by fabulous administration, educators, and students! I love my job and I will forever call Walsh my home!!\n\nLori Keese\n\nI have had the pleasure of being a part of the Walsh Wildcat Family in some capacity since 2012. First as a parent, then a substitute teacher, followed by an Educational Assistant. It was during this time that I realized my passion was to become a teacher. The 2019-2020 school year has been my first year as a certified classroom teacher, and what a year it has been! I am teaching 6th Grade Math and serving as the campus Math Interventionist. One of the best parts of teaching is watching my students grow both in and out of the academic environment. I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know my students and working through the bumps in the road and celebrating successes TOGETHER.\n\nMy husband and I have had the great pleasure of raising two children. Lexi, age 19, moved to California after high school graduation to pursue her dance education. Our son Cooper, age 15, keeps us busy with his extracurricular activities consisting of swimming, basketball, and track. When we are together, it is always filled with laughter and games. It is not unusual for us to break out in an impromptu dance! In my spare time, I love to bake, craft and explore new places. Even though it took me a while to figure out that I wanted to be a teacher, looking back I realize it is who I am and have always channeled that role. I am blessed to be at such an incredible school and have the opportunity to collaborate and work alongside a group of compassionate, brilliant teachers, and special students.\n\nChaundra Anderson\n\nThis is my 5th year at Walsh and my 15th year of teaching. Prior to coming to Walsh, I taught in Austin ISD at Bailey Middle School in South Austin for 10 years. In Austin, I taught both English and History in 7th and 8th grade. I love working with kids and teaching them interesting stories History has to offer. I am originally from Texas and attended Texas A&M University where I got my degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. I met my husband in Austin, and we have a beautiful six year old daughter, Isabelle. When I am not teaching, I love to spend time with family, explore new places, and catch up on my reading list. I am so happy to be part of the Walsh Family!\n\nAudra Graves\n\nI was born and raised in Cypress, Texas which is on the outskirts of Houston, Texas. I graduated from Cy-Fair High School, where I participated in volleyball, basketball, and track. I attended Wharton County Junior College, Tarleton State University, and The University of St. Thomas. I played volleyball for all three of these colleges. I also coached club volleyball. I love all things sports, spike ball, sand volleyball, skimboarding, hiking, kayaking, working out, board games, and reading! I am very passionate about making an impact and helping people!\n\nI moved to Round Rock in 2016. I previously taught 8th grade math and coached 8th grade volleyball in Spring ISD. Then I taught 8th grade Math/Algebra 1 at Walsh Middle School for two years. This is my second year teaching 7th grade math/ACCEL. My husband and I got married in January of 2018. His name is Patrick. We have a 20+ pound orange tabby cat named Simba and an amazing 4 and a half month old son named Ayden Shawn Graves. I no longer know what sleep is and it is totally worth it!\n\nJennifer Allen\n\nHowdy fellow Wildcats this is my first year teaching 6th grade Language Arts at Walsh. I am passionate about literacy and the discovery of unique and fascinating ways of sharing my love of learning with my students. I enjoy being a middle school teacher as students are full of life, open to new concepts, and bring a creative perspective to their learning experience. I love teaching at Walsh as teachers, staff, students, parents and PTA work together to enhance the student learning experience. I am happily married to my best friend and have 3 amazing kids who attend middle and high school in Leander. My son, a freshman in high school, is in JROTC and robotics. He spent much of his time in middle school as a member of the Running Brushy Band and participated in the 40th annual Western International Band Clinic in Seattle, Washington. My daughter, an 8th grader, has a love for journalism and is the Editor-in-chief for her school’s yearbook. She is also this year’s NJHS president and plans to join FFA next year as she has a love for animals. My youngest, in 6th grade, is enjoying her first year in the RBMS band as a clarinetist. She is looking forward to joining track and basketball next year. We live on a ranch where we raise horses and barbado sheep. My love for ranching blossomed during my childhood as I spent a lot of time at my family’s cattle farm. I was a joyous recipient of a forever family as an adopted child. I have always been grateful that my mom, a retired teacher and community volunteer and my dad, a retired high school tennis coach chose me to be their daughter. Due to their decision to share their lives with me, I gained two younger sisters, one of which is an incredible teacher who ignites a passion for learning within her students. My other sister, mom of beautiful triplets, is a physical therapist who is dedicated to making sure her patients receive optimal care. I am also a grandmother of two beautiful girls from my extended family that are 10 and 1. My favorite hobbies include road trips with my family, reading, caring for my animals, singing, volunteering and supporting our Wildcat community.\n\nGrace Bissell\n\nHey Walsh Fam! Grace Bissell here. I teach 8th grade Language Arts and there’s nothing in the world I’d rather do. This is my first year teaching at Walsh and my fourth year teaching overall. What I love the most about being an educator is the relationships I’m able develop with my students. I find middle schoolers fascinating and I love watching them discover who they are as well as what their purpose is in this great big world. Growing up in a family of nine truly equipped me to relate with and engage with scores of personality types and instilled in me a tendency toward speaking loudly and dancing wildly – which you can imagine entertains my students daily. I literally put on a song and dance routine. Is it more for me or for the kids? We’ll never know. Aside from yelling and dancing, my hobbies include: reading (duh), running, cooking, and just generally being around people. Every day after work, I look forward to my afternoon nap and long walks with my husband and puppy dog. Although I was born in Gatesville, Texas, I spent most of my formative years in Nashville, Tennessee. But don’t worry – I came back to Texas as soon as I was released to make my own choices. I attended Baylor University, met the love of my life, and followed him to Georgetown. Round Rock ISD was always a top pick for school districts to launch into my teaching career, and ever since my first principal took a risk on this fresh college grad, I haven’t looked back! My favorite thing about teaching at Walsh is the incredible 8th grade team I get the honor of working with. They’re positive, passionate, and tenacious. Not only do they love each student on a relational level, but they also fight to see each one excel academically. I learn more about what it means to be a rock-star educator from watching their interactions with students and hearing them share what strategies they’re using in the classroom.\n\nI don’t have it all figured out. I still have a lot to learn, but I’m proud to be a Wildcat and excited to grow here as a teacher, mentor, colleague, and friend.\n\nBryn Oliveira\n\nI am lucky enough to say that this is my second year teaching Texas History and coaching girls athletics here at Walsh. Being able to coach and teach has been a dream come true. I am so lucky that I get to come to work everyday and truly love what I do. My partner, Anthony and I have a boxer named Calzy, and two cats named Nikita and Ash. We love to get outside and explore the area around us. Austin is beautiful and offers cool hiking and mountain biking locations.\n\nRandolph Joyce\n\nI am the Science teacher for Team 6.3. I have been teaching for 16 years now, but this is my 5th year with Walsh and in RRISD. Before Walsh, I taught 6-8 Sciences and Aerospace Science at Shoal River Middle School in Crestview Florida. The Aerospace Science program really gave me great opportunities as a teacher. I was able to attend Space Camp for Teachers, Ride on the Zero G Weightless Flights of Discovery to do experiments in zero gravity and I was also named The 2013 Air Force Association Teacher of the Year in Florida. Even with all those wonderful experiences, I can truly say that Walsh is the most amazing school that I have been a part of in my teaching career. I am thankful to be here at Walsh Middle School!\n\nMy Bachelor’s Degree is Health and Physical Education, with Minors in Social Sciences and Sports Medicine.\n\nI have 2 amazing boys, Kaden (13) who go to school here as an 8th grader and my youngest son Collin (10) who is a 4th grader at Cactus Ranch Elementary.\n\nMy hobbies and interests include Superheroes, Superman is my favorite! Going to the movies, I really enjoy sitting back and letting the movie take me to a far away place. I also enjoy staying fit, by working out and doing cardio occasionally (nobody really likes cardio, right?…)\n\nI can’t wait to see what the future has in store for me and my boys here in Round Rock. It’s Great to be a Walsh Wildcat!!\n\nJayson Sherman\n\nI am a Spanish 1B and Spanish 2 teacher here at Walsh. This is my fourth year teaching at Walsh and my seventh year of teaching overall for RRISD. On Friday Club days I sponsor the Comics Creation club. I am also the Walsh Boy’s soccer coach. We are looking forward to another excellent season this year!\n\nI am originally from New England, having grown up in a little coastal town in Rhode Island. I graduated from Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York where I studied Spanish and musical performance for classical guitar, and also played for the Division I men’s soccer program.\n\nIn 2012, I made the best decision of my life to move to the Round Rock area with my wife Tamara and our son Elliot (2). When I’m not at school I enjoy spending time with our dog Chance, as well as training for triathlons. Our family loves to travel and explore, go for bike rides, and drink tea!\n\nMy favorite thing about being a teacher at Walsh is to be able to work with such caring, innovative, and dedicated students and coworkers. I feel very fortunate to be a part of the Walsh community!\n\nCasandra Hernandez\n\nI am a Spanish teacher here at Walsh. This year I have the opportunity to teach Spanish II and 1B to seventh and eight graders. I am in my fourth and a half year of teaching here at Walsh Middle School. I began my career in Round Rock ISD as a substitute at CD Fulkes Middle School in the fall of 2015. In 2016 I started working as a Spanish II teacher at Walsh Middle School. I feel very fortunate and blessed to work with amazing students, parents and the wonderful Walsh community. I was born and raised in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon Mexico until I was ten years old. I then moved to Georgetown, Texas with my parents and my three siblings in 1993 and began my journey of learning a second language. I am the first generation in my family to have a college degree. Although I experienced many obstacles and hardships I believed that having an education was very important and that is why I never gave up the dream of attending a university. In 2010 my dream became a reality and I enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin in 2010. I graduated from UT at Austin in the Fall of 2013 with a Bachelor’s in Spanish and a minor in education with a focus on language teaching. During my studies at UT I also completed the U-Teach program. I have been happily married to Fredy for 10 years. We have three children that attend Old Town. Seth is 9 years old and he is in 4th grade, Desiree is 8 years old and she is in 3rd grade and Katherine is 6 years old and she is in Kinder. I am so happy and thankful to work at Walsh and to get the opportunity to share my passion for learning and to be able to teach the Spanish language and culture with the students. The most rewarding thing for me as a teacher is to build relationships with my students and to inspire them to be the best that they can be and never give up. I look forward to many more years at Walsh.\n\nMarlin Parrack\n\nI am very honored to teach all grades at all levels of French (1A, 1B, and 2) here at Walsh Middle School, where I am enjoying my 6th year as a proud Wildcat! Previously, I have taught French at two other middle schools in Round Rock, and prior to that I taught French at the University of Texas and at Texas Tech. I have also taught bilingual English/French classes in France. In my 30+ years as an educator, I have found myself most productive, appreciated, and gratified here as a member of the remarkable Walsh family.\n\nAt Walsh, I have served as a Collaborative Teacher, a Mentor Teacher, and am currently Department Chair of World Languages. I am co-sponsor of the Geography Club, and the announcer for both the NatGeo Bee and the National Spelling Bee. At the district level, I have participated in the development of curriculum, the creation and calibration of the District Common Assessment, and reviewing and selecting instructional material for World Languages. I have also presented at a number of language symposia and conferences at district, state, and regional levels.\n\nI am from Lubbock, Texas, where I attended Texas Tech, earning a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing and a Master of Arts in Romance Languages. I have lived in the greater Austin area for over 20 years and consider this my forever home. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and learning new languages, doing home improvement projects, reading, and playing word and trivia games online. I am a cat dad to Purrcy and Mewlissa, an uncle to Julien…and “Monsieur” to 120 awesome students.\n\nKelley Smith\n\nI’m excited that this is my 5th year at Walsh Middle School and my 10th year in the district. Prior to teaching 8th grade ESL at Walsh, I taught 5th grade in RRISD and 2nd & 3rd grades in California. While I spent many years in California, my early childhood was spent in Boston so I’m a huge fan of the Red Sox and Patriots!\n\nWhen I’m not at school, I enjoy hiking and traveling with my active sons, Lincoln (11) & Harrison (9) and their active dad, Ryan. We also have a dog, Maeve, who joins us on many of our family adventures. When I have time to myself I enjoy practicing yoga, reading, and running.\n\nMy favorite thing about teaching at Walsh is that I get to create relationships with really amazing students and teachers. I feel so fortunate to be a Wildcat!\n\nChristy Zunker\n\nI am the 7th grade ESL teacher here at Walsh. I teach a reading intervention class and provide inclusion support in math, science, and language arts. On Friday Club day, I teach cursive, calligraphy, and word art.\n\nThis is my 26th year of teaching, all of them proudly in RRISD. I started my teaching career at Double File Elementary where I taught 2nd and 3rd grade. After 9 years at Double File Trail, I transferred to Cactus Ranch Elementary where I taught 3rd grade for 9 years. I finally made it to Walsh, the best middle school in the district, in 2012. I started as a 6th grade math, accel math, and TAG math teacher before moving to my dream job as an ESL teacher.\n\nI was born and raised in the beautiful mountains and basins region of Alpine, TX. I graduated from Southwestern University in Georgetown, TX. I have been married to my high school sweetheart, Rusty, for 23 years. We are the proud parents of Noah, 20, and Eli, 17, who are both Eagle Scouts. Noah is a junior at Harvard, and Eli is a senior at Round Rock High School. When I’m not at Walsh, I enjoy going to group fitness classes at the YMCA with my husband. As a family we like to take road trips, hike, camp, play Pokemon Go, support Eli in football and track, discuss sports, and cheer for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMy favorite thing about being a teacher at Walsh is the relationships I have built with my students and their families. I love being able to use the Spanish my grandparents and parents taught me with many of my families. I look forward to many more years here at Walsh. #onefamily\n\nBryan Babbs\n\nI am the 6th Grade ESL Teacher. This is my 6th year teaching at Walsh and my 7th year of teaching overall.

Additionally, I earned my Masters in Educational Leadership from Western Governors University in December.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my family watching and rooting for our favorite Houston sports teams (Go Texans!). I also spend time with my two dogs, a dachshund named Dash and a boston terrier mix named Derby. On the weekends, you can often find me out and about playing Pokemon Go (Gotta Catch ‘Em All!).\n\nI come from a family of educators and am proud to follow in their footsteps. While education is not my first career, it is the one that feels like my calling. I consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to be a member of Walsh faculty, where I get to work alongside some of the most caring, accomplished teachers and thoughtful, inquisitive students!\n\nJennifer Bergeron\n\nDirector of Bands\n\nJennifer Bergeron is in her sixteenth year of teaching and has been a band director at Walsh Middle School in Round Rock, Texas since 2012.

I was born and raised in Mission, Texas near the Mexican border. After high school, I decided to move to Corpus Christi, attend A&M Corpus Christi University, and receive a Liberal Arts degree in Psychology. I stayed in Corpus for 7 years, and for 4 years, I worked as a case manager in IDD Services for the Behavioral Health Center of Nueces County. After those four years, I decided to take the leap, move to Austin, and continue my job in IDD services in Travis County at Integral Care. However, I knew deep down, my heart was in education and decided to get my certification in teaching. Jump to a year later, I began working in Leander, but decided my roots had to be in Round Rock at Walsh where I have been for almost 3 years working with 8th graders. When I’m not in the classroom, I love taking my 3 chiweenies on walks near the lake, going on yoga hikes, or camping.\n\nSharon Greenstone\n\nI am very happy to be teaching my ninth year here at Walsh Middle School. I am an Inclusion and Language Arts teacher, so I am lucky to be able to teach a variety of subjects. I must admit, though, that my biggest love is reading and it is so fun when students find a book that excites them and motivates them to read more. I love seeing my students learn new things and grow every day. I grew up outside of Chicago until I was ten (where I acquired my lifelong love for the Chicago Cubs) and in Dallas. I am a proud University of Kansas Jayhawk, where I majored in Elementary/Middle education. My husband, Andy, also graduated from KU and we love watching our team play basketball. We have three children: Meagan, a sophomore at McNeil High School, Natalie, a Walsh Wildcat in 8th grade, and Matthew, a 4th grader at Sommer Elementary. We also have two dogs, Charli and Winston, who keep us busy with their crazy antics. We love to travel, try new restaurants and foods, and relax as a family. I am looking forward to the rest of this fabulous school year with my incredible students.\n\nTamara Acuff\n\nI am honored to have spent the last 12 years of my 18 year teaching career at Walsh MS. I am a proud product of RRISD schools; graduating from McNeil HS after attending Grisham MS, Forest North Elem and Anderson Mill Elem. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Stephen F. Austin State University where I met my husband, Brent, who is a band director in Hutto ISD. Our daughter, Bailey, is a 6th grader at my middle school alma mater, which has been a really fun experience!\n\nTeaching reading, sharing books and helping my students find their new favorite books are some of my favorite things. When I’m not reading, I also enjoy cooking, scrapbooking, knitting and spending time with my family, including my parents and my brother and his family who live close by in San Antonio. We love visiting the beach, watching movies (snuggled up with our dachshunds Ranger and Rosie) and all things Disney!\n\nJanel Bates\n\nI am so thankful to be a part of the Walsh family! My teaching career began in 2003, and I am in my fourth year of teaching here at Walsh. I love teaching 8th grade and helping students begin their transition to high school. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas at Austin. Although I received my Masters of Education from Texas Tech University, I still bleed burnt orange! I love to bake, especially at this time of year when it is cold outside. I enjoy trying out new vegetarian recipes, and my favorite restaurant is Thai Cuisine. My other hobby is practicing Krav Maga, an Israli form of hand to hand combat. I’ve been practicing this form of self defense since 2003 and think I’m hooked for life! My husband and I have been married for 11 fantastic years, and have 2 beautiful children. Our daughter, Ambergray, is 9 years old and is a third grader at Cactus Ranch Elementary. She loves ladybugs, gymnastics, and volleyball. Our son, 6 year old Croix, is also at Cactus Ranch Elementary as a kindergartner. He likes science, parkour, monkeys, and ninjas. Our family enjoys road trips, reading together, bike rides, and playing games together.\n\nJosh McCusker\n\nThis is my sixth year at Walsh. My awesome wife and I have three awesome kids, a dog that can catch footballs, a dog that barks at the one catching footballs, and two cats that don’t seem to see the point of dogs. Most of our free time is spent around swimming pools, either practices, meets, or just . All three of our kids are competitive swimmers and have been swimming since they were toddlers. My other hobbies include deadlifting, eating cookies, and watching the Iowa Hawkeyes continue to be the greatest collegiate athletic program in the state of Iowa.\n\nAimee Spikes\n\nI am so excited to be a part of the Walsh community! My family and I have lived in Round Rock since 2006, but I grew up in the Houston area. After graduating from Baylor University with a degree in Biology, I went to work in the Cytogenetics Department at Baylor College of Medicine. I met my husband at a Christmas party when we were both home from college. That was 30 years ago and we now have 2 wonderful daughters. After our children were born, I decided to stay at home with them. When they were older, I began working as a substitute teacher. I enjoyed it so much that I earned my teaching certification and am now in my 10th year at Walsh! Our oldest daughter, Lauren, graduated from Texas A&M University and is now an investment banker living in New York City. Our youngest daughter, Ashley, is graduating in May from the University of North Texas where she is studying art education. When I’m not at school, I enjoy traveling, cooking, and spending time with my family and friends.\n\nBen Sterling\n\nI am a native Austinite and UT graduate who moved to New York and worked as an actor for the last decade. I have recently moved back to Texas with my wife and 2-year-old daughter. As an actor and teacher, I have been practicing theater and improvisation in Austin and New York for over 20 years. I have taught, directed, and performed with over twelve improvisational and sketch troupes, including the recent run of Start Trekkin at the Hideout Theatre. Some of the subjects I have taught include improvisation, stage combat, scene-study, auditioning, Shakespeare, Shakespearean improvisation, long-form improvisation, view-points, clowning, and mimesis to name a few. I have performed on stages in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Seattle, Florida, Chicago, Boston, and Austin as well as on film and television. I am still an active company member of the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey where I toured the east coast performing and taught at schools through the Shakespeare LIVE program, as well as performing on their Main-stage. My most recent credits on their main-stage include Charles from As You Like It, and Tony in Royal Family. Most recently I starred as Lt. Kelly in the Off-Broadway debut of Butler at the 59e59th street theatre in Manhattan. I am excited to be a new member of the Walsh community.\n\nDeanna Dawson\n\nGreetings! I am so excited to be a teacher at Walsh this year!\n\nI was born in Pennsylvania but grew up in various places all over this great country of ours, such as: Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and now Texas! I have had various professions, from fire fighting, opening restaurants across the country, webmaster/layout artist for a fishing publication, and now teaching. I have always had an innate calling for teaching and training, and decided to become a teacher after an amazing morning of teaching my niece to paint and at the declaration from one of my best friends. With her help, I set upon the journey of becoming a certified teacher.\n\nI am so thrilled to be apart of Walsh Middle School and to not only teach but mentor students to prepare them for their future endeavors.\n\nAngela Stearman\n\nThis is my fifth year at Walsh Middle School and I teach Business Information Management (BIM), Fundamentals of Computer Science and Journalism/Yearbook. In addition, once a week I host the FAC class for coding lessons. They’ve just begun to master the concept of loops. My first career was managing multi-million dollar financials, pricing, contracts, projects and acquisitions for the likes of Intel and AMD. I was also often tapped to train newcomers, which I thoroughly enjoyed. One of my favorite roles was training brand new MBA graduates. They were always so intelligent and motivated, I learned as much from them, as they did from me. This year, I am so pleased to be teaching a brand new class. The 2019-20 school year is the first to have Computer Science at the middle school level. Like BIM, it is a high-school-credit class, so I have high expectations of the students. And, the students at Walsh rarely disappoint. I am so fortunate to teach at the best middle school ever! In my spare time, my hobbies are cooking and reading. I like to walk around the neighborhood in the evening with my husband, Greg. Since my two boys, Ryan and Jared, are adults now, I have four dogs and a cat to help fill my time. I also have two granddaughters, via my two oldest step-children. Ava is 7 and Penny is 2. I love it when they call me Grandma! Even though I’m now a grandma, I am determined to keep doing new things and taking on new challenges. In fact, I just sang karaoke for the first time and I’m taking my first Vegas vacation in a couple of weeks. I have a group of about 5 really good friends that will usually join me in new adventures, and I hope they never stop!!!\n\nArtemis Agadakos\n\nI am thrilled to be teaching my 4th year here at Walsh Middle School. I love teaching reading and writing. I think there is no better escape than that between the pages of a good book; that is why my goal is to ignite a passion for both reading and writing in every student’s mind and heart.\n\nI have the most amazing colleagues and students. I love coming to school each day and seeing what their beautiful minds will create; they make work feel like “work.” I look forward to learning and growing side by side with everyone this year!\n\nRachel Zertuche\n\nI am so excited to be a Walsh Wildcat and teach amazing students every day! My 7th grade English Language Arts classes are full of enthusiasm and curiosity. They have lots of voice and we are working on imbuing their writing with those entertaining voices. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 1996. I attended courtesy of academic scholarships I received due to being a National Merit Scholar. My Bachelor of Arts is in English and History. I earned my Master of Arts in English Literature from the University of New Orleans, where I passed my comprehensive in American Literature with distinction. My husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary this summer. We have two sons, ages 8 and 6. Humberto is a sous chef at Trace, the restaurant at the W hotel in Austin. Lorenzo and Caden attend Brushy Creek Elementary and are third and first graders respectively. They are both in cub scouts and gymnastics. I enjoy reading, baking, karaoke, dancing at 80s nights with my friends, and laughing at funny memes.\n\nShannon Waites\n\nI am truly blessed to be a part of the Walsh community! This makes my fifth year teaching Language Arts at Walsh. I am beginning my 32nd year in education. My experience includes working in the ESL/Bilingual Department, teaching Pre-Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th grades. I grew up in Plano, Texas and I’m a proud graduate from The University of Texas. I met my husband our freshman year of college, and we just celebrated our 32nd wedding anniversary this summer! He is my “rock,” and thankfully, always supports my passion for teaching. I am also blessed with my two grown children. My oldest son, Cameron, graduated from Texas Tech and now works for Dell. My youngest son, Brennen, graduated from Texas A&M and became our token Aggie. He’s also a Dell employee. My family has a deep passion for college football, so our fall Saturdays are always full of BBQ, fun, and rivalry! In my spare time, I enjoy exercising with my friends every weekday morning. You can also find me in the neighborhoods and on the trails with my favorite four-legged child. Amigo is our two year old Golden Retriever who makes our family complete. I also truly value the time I spend with my family. All of my immediate family has moved to the Georgetown area, so we are now fortunate enough to get together as often as possible. When I reflect back to the reasons I chose to be an educator so many years ago, the reasons remain the same today. I want to inspire and empower my students while instilling a life-long passion for reading and writing!\n\nJharna Bhatt\n\nI am an educator who loves to inspire the students I work with and the peers I work alongside. I value building relationships with students, colleagues and community members. Embracing challenges and new opportunities is a passion of mine and I try and instill this in my students and peers.\n\nBeing born and raised in the culture of Bombay, India (now Mumbai) presented many challenges for me when I moved to the United States of America in 1999 with my husband. I embraced the American lifestyle while still maintaining my heritage which I now share with my 15-year-old son, Tanish. In America, I took the opportunity to earn my Masters Degree in Middle School Math/Science from The Ohio State University in 2003 (G0 BUCKEYES!). I have taught math in different school districts for 14 years but I have most recently enjoyed working in the same district in which my son attends, Round Rock ISD. Tanish is currently a sophomore at Round Rock High School and is a proud member of Dragon Band.\n\nI have overcome and faced head-on many challenges in my life. Moving from one country to another, adapting to a completely different lifestyle, the sudden loss of my husband in 2013, and learning how to be a single parent. I teach students that every challenge is merely an obstacle to be conquered with the opportunity to grow, learn and embrace your new-found knowledge. It is simply your mindset and determination that will assist you in these endeavors.\n\nKaleong Chong\n\nMy name is Kaleong Chong, this is my third year here at Walsh. However, I have taught Middle School Math for the past 9 years, mostly working with 8th grade math.\n\nI was originally from Malaysia, came over to USA at the age of 17 to attend UT Austin, where I got my undergraduate degree in BBA. Years later, I went to Texas State and got my Master’s in Education. I met my wife, Phoebe, in Russia, where we spent 12 years doing missionary work. We have 2 wonderful daughters, Dasha, who is now studying in Germany; and Patricia, here with us in high school.\n\nI believe that education is the key to success for all students, and any child that chooses to succeed, can, and usually will. Making that choice as a teenager can often seem difficult. I do promise that when that decision is made, I will be there ready to help. I love to bring out the best in young people and watch how life is transformed everyday with new questions, ideas, and friendship.\n\nOne interesting fact about me is that I speak English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Russian, some Malay and two other dialects.\n\nAlan Aycock\n\nI love that I am a part of such an amazing campus here at Walsh. This is my 5th year teaching here at Walsh and my 8th year teaching overall. I have taught a few different subjects. I have taught band in Oklahoma, a 4th grade classroom, 5th / 6th grade math and history, and now I currently teach 7th grade math. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2007 with a degree in music education. While at OU I got to perform in the Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band, the Sooner Showmen Basketball Band, and several different instrument ensembles. This explains my passion for OU. It was truly an amazing experience getting to attend school there and I love everything about the campus.\n\nHeidi Jenkins\n\nJaime Wells\n\nI am so excited to teach Texas History at Walsh. I love my students and they are forever “Wells Kids”. This is my 17th year teaching, I have been at Round Rock ISD for 8 years. I am committed to making a difference in the educational process and positively affecting the students I serve. My role as a leader is to lead and teach my students to be leaders. I maintain professionalism and provide my students with professional growth to be successful life long learners. It is important to me to commit to life-long learning both for my own personal growth and as a model of continuous learning for my students. My personal values are inherent in my ability to lead with passion. At home my husband Dan and I love to being involved with our kids and all their fun activities.\n\nCheryl Springfield\n\nI absolutely love being a part of the Walsh family. I’m in total awe of the administration, staff and hard-working teaching professionals I am lucky enough to work with everyday. This is my 2nd year at Walsh. Last year, I was a 7th and 8th grade inclusion teacher. This year, I’m teaching World Cultures and learning so much from my amazing team and students. I love teaching 6th graders. They are such active learners and so very inquisitive about the world around them.\n\nThis is my 16th year of teaching. Most of my career was spent teaching 4th grade at Cypress Elementary in Leander ISD. I then subbed for a couple of years, looking for my next adventure. I found my home at Walsh! When I’m not around campus, I love spending time with my family. Just this month, I celebrated my 32nd wedding anniversary! We are the proud parents of two adult “children.” Our son, Curtis, graduated from Texas State, a CPA living the life in Houston. My daughter, Lauren, graduated from Texas Tech with a degree in Electronic Media. She lives in Dallas working in software sales. We all love rooting on our favorite sports team (which we don’t always agree on,) traveling and just spending time together.These first few weeks have been about getting to know these amazing 6th graders and I have loved every single minute of it. It’s going to be an amazing year. Walsh is a great place to be and I’m so happy to be here!\n\nConcetta Williamson\n\nWow! I can’t believe this is my 8th year at Walsh and my 19th year teaching middle school science. I am known for my animated teaching style, passion for science and ability to form strong, meaningful relationships with students. My goal for students? I hope that when they leave my classroom, they will go forward with a positive attitude toward learning and the confidence to “Be the Boss Applesauce.” When I’m not MC‘ing Camp Wildcat, acting as Team Lead, or rapping about plate tectonics, I enjoy attending Texas Longhorn football games, traveling with my husband and daughter and spending time with our golden retriever. Although I have taught in Austin, Boerne, Bethesda, and Highland Park, Walsh is home. Thank you students, parents, and staff for making me a part of YOUR family.\n\nHeather Lucas\n\nI am beyond excited and blessed to be a part of the Walsh Family! I have been teaching for 11 years and substitute taught on and off for 10 years before making it official; that’s 21 years in education! I have taught many subjects in my time, but mainly Sciences. I currently teach 7th Grade Science and coach Cheerleading with the amazing Coach Martinez! I was accepted into RRISD first cohort ‘I Lead’ program and am looking forward to becoming a more supportive and successful leader. When I’m not teaching or cheering on the Wildcats, I’m a mother and partner. Mr. Smith and I have an unbelievably amazing son named Ian. Ian is 4 years old and attends Chandler Oaks Elementary. We love to spend time with family and friends playing games, BBQing, traveling, or catching the latest movie. I’m looking forward to yet another outstanding year here at Walsh…WE ARE, WALSH!!! GO WILDCATS!!!\n\nAmber White\n\n13 years of service with Round Rock ISD and is one of the founding members of Walsh Middle School! She has a passion for science and science education and strives to make learning fun!! She channels her inner Miss Frizzle every day, engaging students, broadening their horizons, and making science relevant and meaningful. Being true to one’s self and continuously striving to be better, along with quirky themed earrings and a whole lot of randomness makes her science class an exciting place to be! At the end of the year, students walk away from Ms. White’s class with a greater love for science! They know they were and will continue to be loved; each student of Ms. White’s holds a permament place in her heart. Outside of school, Ms. White loves punny jokes, knitting, making polymer clay jewelry, painting, and playing games with her son, Gavin. She loves movies and books and all things FUN! If you ever happen to see her outside of school, stop and say, “Hello!!” We are one family!"
