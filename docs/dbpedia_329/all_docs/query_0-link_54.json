D-67433 Ncustadt Printed in the Fcdcral Republic of Germany Preface to the third Edition Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) is today, more than 40 years after it was pro- posed by Walsh as an analytical procedure, well established in numerous fields of in- strumental analysis. Due to its high specificity and selectivity, as well as the fact that operation is relatively simple, AAS has gained its place alongside ICP OES and 1CP-MS. It is used to perform numerous routine tasks in the laboratory ranging from the determi- nation of trace contents through to major constituents. The fact that more than 1000 original papers dealing with AAS are published every year is a clear indication that there are numerous new developments over and above the routine applications. These include new knowledge on atomization and other reaction mechanisms, im- proved analytical methods, especially in the fields of trace and ultratrace analysis, as well as in solids analysis, particularly using slurries. A major contribution has been the devel- opments in instrumentation, such as transversely-heated graphite furnaces, integrated platforms, the application of solid-state detectors, or simultaneous multielement AAS, as well as new sample introduction and on-line pretreatment techniques such as flow injec- tion. New areas of application including the analysis of ‘high tech’ materials and specia- tion analysis must also be mentioned. To do justice to these manifold developments, this monograph has been rearranged, completely revised, and correspondingly extended. Thus, Chapter 1 on the historical development of AAS is new; in the first instance i t demonstrates the maturity of the technique and provides the historically interested reader with the background informa- tion, and in the second instance i t frees the technical chapters from historical ballast, leaving them free for a discussion of the current state of knowledge. Chapter 2 on the physical principles of AAS is also largely new; many of the topics discussed in this chapter are only inadequately treated in standard textbooks or not at all, and other topics have only been thoroughly developed in recent years. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 are likewise new. Chapter 5 deals with procedures of measure- ment and calibration, the principles of quality control and assessment, and the basics of the statistical evaluation of the analytical results. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with automation and species analysis, and present a short review of the developments in these areas dur- ing recent years. On the other hand, the comparative chapter on other analytical proce- dures is no longer included since the recent developments in 1CP OES and ICP-MS are well beyond the scope of this monograph. Compared to the last edition, Chapter 8 includes significantly improved knowledge on the mechanisms of atomization and interferences, particularly for GF AAS and HG AAS. Chapter 9, dealing with the individual elements, now includes information on the stability and storage of test sample and calibration solutions, as well as the deterini- nation of species. In the treatment of applications in Chapter 10 , methods no longer rele- vant, such as the determination of volatile elements by GF AAS using atomization from the tube wall with peak height evaluation, have been eliminated. On the other hand, all relevant procedures for speciation analysis are newly included. Throughout this edition the terminology proposed by 1SO and IUPAC has been used consistently. Thus, instead of ambiguous units such as ppm, ppb, etc., we have consis- VI Preface tently used the IS0 units mg/L, pg/L, ng/L and mg/g, yglg, nglg, etc. We have also at- tempted to avoid concentrations quoted in percent, which nevertheless was not possible in all cases since it was not clear from the original papers whether the concentration of acids, for example, were quoted in weight or volume percent. To establish the bibliography we applied a relational databank (PELIDAS, 0 M. Sperling) to evaluate more than 55 000 entries from the field of atomic spectros- copy using plausibility checks to guarantee the quality of the citations. For the selection of the 6500 or so citations in this monograph, next to their information content, their topicality and availability also played a role. It is clear that for such a selection subjec- tivity comes into play, even though we have always attempted to be objective; we there- fore ask for our readers’ understanding if any paper that they deem to be important is not cited. To maintain the topicality of this monograph we have also departed from traditional methods of production. Since the entire work, including the layout, was produced on the authors’ PCs, we were able to update the contents until shortly before publication. We feel sure our readers will excuse the inadequacies of the word processor used in produc- ing the layout since these are more than compensated by the advantage of topicality. Uberlingen, September 1998 Bernhard Welz Michael Sperling Preface to the second Edition In the nine years since the publication of the first edition of this monograph, atomic ab- sorption spectrometry has undergone a remarkable development. This is perhaps no entirely true for flame AAS, which nowadays is established as a routine procedure in all branches of elemental analysis, but it is certainly the case with all other techniques of AAS. Even though flame AAS had already found acceptance in many standard methods due to its reliability in the mg/L range, it is only a few years ago that considerable doubt was cast on the ability of graphite furnace and hydride generation AAS to provide cor- rect results at all in the pg/L and ng/L ranges. The difficulties observed by many analysts using these techniques were due in part to the shortcomings of the instruments employed and in part to non-optimum application, since the significance of a number of parameters had not been recognized. In addition, the general problems of trace and nanotrace analysis had to be taken into consideration, since these newer techniques opened this concentration range to AAS. These days, the causes of the majority of interferences and also the possibilities for their elimination are known. Even if all technical problems have not been completely solved, the way to their solution has been shown. Thus, as well as the flame technique, the graphite furnace, hydride generation, and cold vapor techniques are nowadays of equal significance. The major field of application of these newer techniques is in trace, nanotrilce and ultratrace analysis. Each of these techniques has its own atomizer, its own specific mechanisms of atomization and inter- Preface V11 ference, and of course its own preferred field of application. In this second edition, these three techniques are thus treated separately whenever this appears expedient. This made it necessary to substantially revise numerous chapters. Chapter 3 now deals only with atomizers, their historical development, and their specific characteristics for each technique. A new chapter 8 has been introduced in which the mechanisms of atomization and the interferences for each technique are discussed in detail. Additionally, typical interferences and their elimination are mentioned. A general discussion and clas- sification of interferences is presented in chapter 7. Application of the Zeeman effect for background correcttion is also treated in detail in this chapter. This treatment includes the theoretical aspects of the method, the various configurations, and their advantages and disadvantages. In the chapters on individual elements and specific applications, the various techniques are, wherever applicable, weighed against each other. A discussion on trace and nanotrace analysis has also been newly introduced, since the newer techniques of AAS are among the most sensitive methods for elemental analy- sis. Solids analysis is also treated since this has become possible with the graphite fur- nace technique. A section on environmental analysis has been included in the chapter on specific applications, and topical questions on the analysis of air, waste water and sew- age sludge are addressed. Ainong associated analytical methods, atomic emission spectrometry employing an inductively coupled argon plasma is discussed especially, since it is frequently regarded as a competitive technique to flame AAS. However, a broad treatment of this theme is outside the scope of this book. Graphite furnace atomic emission spectrometry has also received attention even though, like atomic fluorescence spectrometry, it is rarely used in practice. Finally, terms, nomenclature and units of measurement have been brought into line with the latest international standards - a fact reflected in the changed title of this mono- graph. Of particular help in this respect was my work on the committee of material test- ing within the German Institute of Standardization. This committee was chaired by Dr. Hans Massinann, who, until his death, worked on the completion of DIN 5 1 401 and who also made valuable suggestions for the second edition of this book - a fact greatly appre- ciated. I should also like to thank those readers who wrote to me pointing out errors in the first edition; they have made valuable contributions to improving this work. I should particularly like to thank Sir Alan Walsh who drew my attention to a number of errors and who proposed numerous improvements and more precise definitions. The numerous new diagrams were prepared with the customary care by Mr. E. Klebsattel who receives my grateful thanks. I should also like to thank Mr. J. Storz for designing the cover. This book is the English-language version of its German forerunner “Atomabsorp- tionsspektrometrie” (formerly “Atom-Absorptions-Spektroskopie”) which is now in its third edition. As for the first edition the translation has been very capably carried out by Christopher Skegg to whom I extend my thanks. Meersburg, May 1985 Bernhard Welz VIII Preface Preface to the first Edition It was very convenient that the translation of my book into the English languagee was undertaken just as I was completing the second German edition. Therefore, all the latest developments and publications could be incorporated directly in the English edition Usually, years go by between the publication of the original book and the completion of a translation which, therefore, typically does not represent the latest state. Here, how- ever, the translation could be published about a year after the original German edition. This is of special importance for the rapidly growing field of furnace atomic absorption which was hardly known a few years ago when the first edition of my book was pub- lished. In the meantime it has found worldwide acceptance among analysts. So, to all my friends and colleagues who have been involved in the translation and completion of this book, I would like to express my thanks for the time that they have spent and for all the effort that they have put into it so that it could be published so early. Last not least, I want to express my pleasure that my book on Atomic Absorption Spec- troscopy has been accepted for translation into English. I hope that it will prove a stimu- lus to atomic absorption spectroscopy and will help analysts and spectroscopists in their daily work, Meersburg, March 1976 Bernhard Welz Contents 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption ................................. 1 . 1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.7.

1. 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Spec- trometry 1.1 The Early History The beginning of optical spectroscopy is generally attributed to Sir ISAAC NEWTON [ 3205 1 who, in a letter to the Royal Society in 1672, described the observation that sun- light is split into various colors when it is passed through a prism. Albeit JOANNES MARCUS MARCI vON KRONLAND (1595-1667), professor of medicine at the University of Prague (Figure 1 - l ) , had already explained the origin of the rainbow on the basis of the diffraction and scattering of light in water droplets in his book Thuumantias. Liber de urcu coelesti deyue colorum upparentium nuturu ortu et cwusis published in 1648; he can thus be looked upon as the first spectroscopist. The history of absorption spectrometry is closely connected with the observation of sunlight [5934]. In 1802 Wollaston discovered the black lines in the sun’s spectrum. These were later investigated in detail by Fraunhofer, who assigned letters to the Figure 1-1. ‘Joannes Marcus Marci. Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine, and Profcssor, born in Kronland i n Bohemia, 17 Junc 1.595.’ 2 I The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry strongest lines, starting at the red end of the spectrum with the letter A. Even nowadays it is common to refer to the ‘sodium D line’, a designation originated by Fraunhofer. In 1820 Brewster expressed the view that these Fraunhofer lines were caused by ab- sorption processes in the sun’s atmosphere. The underlying principles of this absorption were established by KIRCHHOFF and BUNSEN 13 121-3 1241 during their systematic ex- amination of the line reversal in the spectra of alkali and alkaline-earth elements. They conclusively demonstrated that the typical yellow line emitted by sodium salts in a flame is identical to the black D line of the sun’s spectrum. The classical experimental ar- rangement is shown in Figure 1-2. Figure 1-2. Experimental setup of KIKCHHOFF and B ~ J N S E N for investigating the line reversal in the sodium spectrum (according to [5934]). Radiation from a lamp is focused by lens 1, through the flame of a Bunsen burner B into which sodium chloride is introduced with a spatula. The radiation beam is dispersed by prism P and observed on screen S. The sodium D line appears as a black discontinuity in the otherwise continuous spectrum. The relationship between emission and absorption was formulated by Kirchhoff in his law, which is generally valid and states that any material that can emit radiation at a given wavelength will also absorb radiation of that wavelength. The connection between atomic structure and the interaction of atoms with radiation was established by Planck (1900) in the quantum law of absorption and emission of radiation, according to which an atom can only absorb radiation of well defined wave- length il or frequency v, i.e. it can only take up and release definite amounts of energy F : where h is Planck’s constant and c is the speed of light. Characteristic values of t‘ and v exist for each atomic species. On the basis of this and many other spectroscopic observations, Bohr proposed his atomic model in 1913, the fundamental principle of which is that atoms do not exist in random energy states, but only in certain fixed states which differ from each other by integral quantum numbers. Upon absorbing a quantum of energy, an atom is transformed 1.2 Sir Alan Walsh and the Period 1952-1962 3 into a particular, energy-enriched state ‘containing’ the radiation energy which has been taken up. After a period of around lO-’s to 10kx s the atom can re-emit this energy and thus return to the ground state. Although Kirchhoff had already recognized the principle of atomic absorption i n I860 and the theoretical basis was steadily extended during the following decades, the practical significance of this technique was not recognized for a long time. Since the work of Kirchhoff, the principle of atomic absorption was mainly used by astronomers to determine the composition and concentration of metals in the atmospheres of stars. Chemical analyses were only carried out very sporadically by this technique; the deter- mination of mercury vapor did, however, acquire a degree of importance 14225, 63801 (see Section 1.8.1). The actual year of birth of modern AAS was 1955. In that year, publications authored independently by WALSH [6135] and ALKEMADE and MILATZ [ 125, 1261 recommended AAS as a generally applicable analytical procedure. 1.2 Sir Alan Walsh and the Period 1952-1962 Even though the publications by ALKEMADE and MILATZ 1 1 25, 126) in The Netherlands and WALSH [6135] in Australia appeared in the same year, making it difficult to answer the question as to who actually rediscovered AAS, Alan Walsh (Figure 1-3) is generally recognized as the ‘father’ of modern AAS. This privilege is his just due since he cam- paigned with untiring energy against the resistance to this new idea for more than a dec- ade, spending much time to overcome the disinterest and misunderstanding. Best of all, let Alan Walsh himself describe the events and developments of the period 1952 to 1962 [ 6 1371. ‘My initial interest in atomic absorption spectroscopy was a result of two interacting experiences: one of the spectrochemical analysis of metals over the period 1939- 1946; the other of molecular spectroscopy over the period from 1946-1952. The interaction occurred early in 1952, when I began to wonder why, as in my experience, Figure 1-3. Sir Alan Walsh. 4 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry molecular spectra were usually obtained in absorption and atomic spectra in emission. The result of this musing was quite astonishing: there appeared to be no good reasons for neglecting atomic absorption spectra; on the contrary, they appeared to offer many vital advantages over atomic emission spectra as far as spectrochemical analysis was con- cerned. There was the attraction that absorption is, at least for atomic vapours produced thermally, virtually independent of the temperature of the atomic vapour and of excita- tion potential. In addition, atomic absorption methods offered the possibility of avoiding excitation interference, which at that time was thought by many to be responsible for some of the interelement interferences experienced in emission spectroscopy when using an electrical discharge as light source. In addition, one could avoid problems due to self- absorption and self-reversal which often make it difficult to use the most sensitive lines in emission spectroscopy.’ ‘As far as possible experimental problems were concerned, I was particularly fortu- nate in one respect. For several years prior to these first thoughts on atomic absorption, I had been regularly using a commercial i.r. spectrophotometer employing a modulated light source and synchronously tuned detection system. A feature of this system is that any radiation emitted by the sample produces no signal at the output of the detection system. This experience had no doubt prevented the formation of any possible mental block associated with absorption measurements on luminous atomic vapours.’ In an internal report for the period February-March 1952 Walsh suggested that the same type of modulated system should be considered for recording atomic absorption spectra. ‘Assuming that the sample is vaporised by the usual methods, e.g. flame, arc, or spark, then the emission spectrum is “removed“ by means of the chopper principle. Thus the emission spectrum produces no output signal and only the absorption spectrum is recorded.’ In the same report he continued: ‘For analytical work it is proposed that the sample is dissolved and then vaporised in a Lundegardh flame. Such flames have a low tempera- ture (2000 K) compared to arcs and sparks (5000 K) and have the advantage that few atoms would be excited, the great majority being in the ground state. Thus absorption will be restricted to a small number of transitions and a simple spectrum would result. In addition, the method is expected to be sensitive since transitions will be mainly confined to those from the ground level to the first excited state.’ The next report for the period April-May 1952 included the diagram shown in Figure 1-4 and described the first experiment as follows: ‘The sodium lamp was operated from 50 cyclesk and thus had an alternating output so that it was not necessary to use a chop- per. The D lines from the lamp were isolated-but not resolved from each other-by means of a direct vision spectroscope and their intensities were measured by means of a photomultiplier tube, the output from which was recorded on a cathode ray oscillograph. Amplification of the signal was achieved by the a.c. amplifiers in the oscillograph. With the slit-width used the signal gave full-scale deflection on the oscillograph screen. A Meker flame was interposed between the sodium lamp and the entrance slit of the spec- troscope. When a solution of sodium chloride was atomised into the air supply of the flame the signal at the oscillograph was reduced to zero. The principle of the method is therefore established.’ I .2 Sir Alan Walsh and the Period 1952-1 962 5 Figure 1-4. The first outline by Walsh for the measurement of atomic absorption from his report for April-May 1952. In retrospect Walsh admitted to ‘optimistic naivety’; he nevertheless recalls: ‘This simple experiment gave me a great thrill, and I excitedly called John Willis, who at the time was working on infrared spectroscopy and was later to make important contribu- tions to the development of atomic absorption methods of chemical analysis. “Look,” 1 said, “that’s atomic absorption.” “So what?” was his reply, which was the precursor of many disinterested reactions to our atomic absorption project over the next few years.’ In his report for June-July 19.52 Walsh discussed the problem of recording atomic absorption spectra using a continuum source and came to the conclusion that a resolution of approximately 2 pni would be required. This was far beyond the capabilities of the best spectrometer available in his laboratory at that time. The report concluded: ‘One of the main difficulties is due to the fact that the relations between absorption and concen- tration depend on the resolution of the spectrograph, and on whether one measures peak absorption or total absorption as given by the area under the absorptiordwavelength curve.’ This realization led him to conclude that the measurement of atomic absorption re- quires line radiation sources with the sharpest possible emission lines. The task of the monochromator is then merely to separate the line used for the measurement from all the other lines emitted by the source. The high resolution demanded for atomic absorption measurements is in end effect provided by the line source. At this point Walsh had already recognized the salient points of AAS: The use of line radiation sources, which make a high-resolution monochromator unnecessary, the princi- ple of modulation, which makes the technique selective and eliminates the radiation emitted by the atomizer, and the use of laminar flames of relatively low temperature to atomize the sample. A patent for the technique was lodged at the end of 1953 and an atomic absorption spectrometer was publicly demonstrated in Melbourne in March 1954. However, during the exhibition the instrument aroused little interest. The last changes to the specifications for the patent were submitted in October 1954 and immediately thereafter WALSH sent his first manuscript about AAS to Spectro- chimica Acta, which was published at the beginning of 1955 [6135]. This paper was followed by others from Walsh’s group [SO101 and also from ALLAN [ 13.51 in New Zea- land and DAVID [ 14261 in Australia. Nevertheless the technique was still looked upon as a ‘scientific curiosity’ rather than a practical analytical technique. In the meantime, Hilger and Watts had built an instrument, but since the radiation source was not modulated it could not exploit the technique. Other manufacturers later made the same mistake. WALSH [6137] recalls that ‘by 1958 there was no sign of any 6 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Specti-omelry instrument manufacturer willing to produce the type of instrument which we thought desirable.’ WALSH then decided to arrange for the production of appropriate equipment. The necessary items were manufactured by three small companies in Melbourne and then assembled by the user. ‘As it transpired,’ he wrote (61371, ‘for the next few years the members of our research group were increasingly involved in supporting the commercial production in Australia of atomic absorption equipment. That a new type of Australian industry was eventually created was, of course, cause for much satisfaction, but it was inevitable that there was a substantial reduction in our research effort over a period of several years.’ Figure 1-5.

It was during these discussions that Chester Nimitz (the then current General Manager of the Iiistrurnent Division of Perkin-Elmer) asked, rather tersely: “If this goddam technique is as useful as you say it is, why isn’t it being used right here in the USA?” My reply, which my friends in Norwalk have never allowed me to forget, was to the effect that the USA was an underdeveloped country! The Perkin-Elmer deci- sion to embark on a large-scale project relating to the production of atomic absorption equipment was made shortly afterward.’ The very first instrument built to Walsh’s ideas, the Model 303, is depicted in Figure 1-5. From this time point there was ;I remarkable growth in AAS, which can be demonstrated by the number of spectrometers produced (Figure 1-6). 1.3 The Development of Spectral Radiation Sources One of the decisive steps during the rediscovery of AAS was the realization that the high resolution required for measurements by this technique could be provided by the sharp emission lines of line radiation sources. For his experiments, WALSH used hollow c c r t h - ode lamps (HCLs). This type of lamp was first described by PASCHEN 145551 in 1916. However, early lamps of this type were unstable and not at all easy to operate since ar- gon under a pressure of approximately 1 kPa had to be continuously pumped through them. Only after the introduction of sealed lamps with fused-in electrodes [ 15241, which were modified by WALSH rt ul. f2945, 501 I ] for use in AAS, did this type of source become applicable for routine use. The construction of one of these early HCLs is de- picted in Figure 1-7. Despite the clear advantages of sealed sources for routine operation, demountable HCLs with exchangeable cathodes have been reported from time to time 1258, 2174, 3 129, 4968, 55931. However, these sources have only acquired a limited significance for research purposes, since their operation is more complicated and requires experience of high vacLium techniques. Figure 1-7. Schematic construction of a simple hollow cathode lamp as used by JONES and WALSII [2945]. 1 - glahs cylinder; 2 ~ hollow cathode; 3 ~ nickel anode. 8 I The Historical Development of Atomic Abcorption Spectrometry At the beginning of the 1960s a development phase set in during which the HCL was made into an extremely reliable spectral source that can be used for virtually all elements determinable by AAS. SLAVIN [5439] recalls in particular the very fruitful cooperation between Jack Sullivan at CSIRO and Carl Sebens and John Vollmer from Perkin-Elmer. A further impulse came from WHITE [6297] who showed that after several hundred oper- ating hours a normal cylindrical cathode changes its geometry due to the transport of sputtered metal from the hot inner side to the surface. Thereby a cathode in the form of a hollow sphere with a relatively small opening is produced. When the ratio of the diame- ter of the opening to the internal diameter of the sphere is 1.4, virtually no more metal atoms can escape from inside the cathode, thus largely eliminating the problems of self- absorption and self-reversal. After years of research, MANNING and VOLLMER [3849] introduced an HCL that was marketed under the tradename Intensitron@. Careful isolation of the anode and cathode with mica disks and ceramic materials contributed markedly to the stabilization and localization of the glow discharge, leading to a more intense emission for the same lamp current, to a better ratio of the emission of the atomic lines in comparison to the ion lines, to less self-absorption, and to a longer lifetime (see Section 3.1. I ) . For a number of ele- ments, particularly stable and intense emission could be obtained when the metal was in the molten state in the cathode. VOLLMER [6100] reported an HCL containing a mixture of bismuth and lithium that had a significantly improved radiation emission compared to a lamp with a cathode made of bismuth only. The operating current was chosen in such a way that a thin film of molten bismuth formed on the inside of the cathode. Similar lamps, in which the analyte is molten during operation, have also been described for a number of other elements 13850, 6101). Numerous working groups turned their attention to the construction of rnultielement lamps in order to avoid a too frequent change of lamp. JONES and WALSH 129451 con- structed a lamp containing several cathodes in the same glass cylinder, each of a different metal. MASSMANN [ 38341, and BUTLER and STRASHEIM 19821, constructed multielement lamps whose cathodes consisted of rings of various metals pressed together. The concept used nowadays for the construction of multielement lamps was developed by S E B E N ~ ef al. [5207], in which various metals in powder form are mixed, pressed, and sintered. Using this method, virtually any metal combination can be produced 1 1882, 2496, 38421. As well as the work on the development of reliable radiation sources for routine use, considerable efforts were directed to increasing the radiant intensity while at the same time decreasing the self-absorption. SULLIVAN and WALSH 1568 I I constructed a special type of hollow cathode in which the glow discharge on the cathode was used principally to sputter as much cathode material as possible. The cloud of atoms, which in normal HCLs is responsible for the self-absorption, was then excited by a second discharge produced in front of the cathode by a supplementary electrode isolated from the first discharge. The authors reported a hundred-fold increase in the intensity of these lamps compared to conventional HCLs. The half-width and profile of the resonance lines were said not to have altered and, above all, practically no more self-absorption or self- reversal was to be observed. Accordingly, the calibration curves published by SULLIVAN and WALSH showed good linearity up to high absorbance values. These findings were verified through work by CARTWRIGHT et a / . [1092-10941, in which attention was also 1.2 Sir Alan Walsh and the Period I YS2- 1962 9 drawn to the considerable improvements for such difficultly vaporized elements as sili- con, titanium, and vanadium. At that time only lamps of low radiant intensity were avail- able for these elements. However, despite occasional reports about their use 11201, these high-intensity lamps did not attain lasting significance in AAS. Review articles on the development of radiation sources for AAS were published by BUTLER and BRINK 19841 and by SULLIVAN [5687l. Recently, various HCLs have been described in which the glow discharge is en- hanced by microwaves [ 1079, 10801 or by radio waves 1245, 18481. Compared to con- ventional HCLs, an improved signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and lower limits of‘ detection were achieved with these lamps [4830, 61731. Nevertheless, since only a two- to three- fold improvement is obtained it is questionable whether the increased operating com- plexity is worthwhile. A monograph edited by CAKOLI [ 10781 provides a good overview of the various attempts to construct improved HCLs for AAS. Electrodeless dischurge lamps (EDLs) are among the radiation sources exhibiting the highest radiant intensity and the narrowest line widths. A thorough investigation of this lamp type was made by BLOCH and BLOCH [670] in 1935 and in subsequent years they were used in a variety of high resolution studies. At the end of the 1960s EDLs found increasing interest in atomic fluorescence spectrometry [ 301, 887, 1400- 1402, 1405, 38673. The more intense radiation of EDLs by at least a power of ten compared to nor- mal HCLs was of considerable interest for this technique since the fluorescence signal is, in the first approximation, directly proportional to the radiant power. At about the same time the first applications in AAS were described 1888, 1400, 1404, 14051. The early papers published on EDLs were largely concerned with the design of these lamps and a number of authors gave detailed instructions on their construction [ 1404, 1405, 3867, 638 I ] . Although their design is really very simple-a few micrograms to a few milligrams of the analyte, either as the element or the halide, are fused into a quartz tube under an argon pressure of about 1 kPa-their operation gives rise to a number of problems. Various factors, such as the purity and dimensions of the quartz tube, the pres- sure of the inert fill gas, and the quantity and chemical form of the analyte, play an im- portant role. The excitation frequency and the location of the quartz tube within the radio frequency coil are further important factors. SNEDDON et ul. [ 54801 have published a review article which provides the interested reader with detailed information on the de- velopment, manufacture, and operation of this type of lamp. In an entertaining manner, HERB KAHN [3000] described how, through a conversation with L’vov, the enormous difficulties in the manufacture of EDLs could be virtually eliminated in a single stroke. At that time L’vov was routinely using EDLs without hav- ing observed any difficulties. During the conversation it became clear that two factors were essential for the stable operation of EDLs: firstly the metai content in the lamp should be in the microgram and not in the milligram range, and secondly the lamp should be operated at a frequency of 100 MHz or less and not at a frequency of 2450 MHz which was usual up to that time. As Kahn said, within three hours of reporting this con- versation to his engineers he saw the ‘best cadmium EDL that had ever been seen in the western world.’ Very volatile metals, such as mercury, thallium, zinc, and the alkali metals, earlier were determined using low presswe vapor discharge lamps since these were offered commercially at low prices and gave a high radiant intensity. Various papers were pub- 10 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Speclroinctry lished in which these lamps were compared to HCLs 13841, 5010, 54091. The disadvan- tage of these lamps is that-under normal operating conditions-they emit strongly broadened lines due to self-absorption and self-reversal of the high internal atom con- centration and are therefore little suited to atomic absorption measurements 15891 ]. For use in AAS, vapor discharge lamps had to be operated at highly reduced currents to avoid excessive self-reversal which in turn resulted in increased instability. Since excel- lent EDLs for the volatile elements are nowadays commercially available, vapor dis- charge lamps are no longer of significance in AAS. The trniperuturr gmdierzt lamps (TGLs) introduced by GOUGH and SULLIVAN [2185], which are in principle also vapor discharge lamps, gained a degree of impor- tance. The section of the lamp containing the analyte element (as the pure metal) is heated. Two electrodes are located in a separate section of the lamp; a relatively high current (approx. 500 mA) at low voltage (approx. 30 V) is applied to the electrodes. The quartz window is located in the discharge zone where it is heated to prevent condensa- tion and self-reversal of the metal vapor. It was reported that these lamps provided a greater radiant power for the same line width as EDLs 12185]. Naturally a TGL can only be manufactured for those elements that have a sufficiently high vapor pressure at the operating temperature, such as As, Cd, K, Na, P, S, Se, Te, and Zn. In 1955 ALKEMADE and MILLATZ [ 1261 proposed using a ,flmze, into which high metal salt concentrations were sprayed, as a radiation source for AAS; various authors followed this stimulus [5395]. A flame as the primary radiation source has the advantage that i t is cheap, universal, and very flexible. Especially for multielement analyses 1982) it admits to practically any desired element combination. As further variants, electric sparks [5594, 55961 and arcs 12721, 32801 were investigated as radiation sources by a number or authors. A disadvantage of these radiation sources-compared to lamps-is their low stability and intensity. However, the greatest disadvantage is that, depending on the temperature of the source, the half-widths of the emission lines are at least as wide and mostly wider than those of the absorption lines, leading to non-linear calibration curves (see Section 2.5.3). These disadvantages have prevented the wider application of this type of source. Despite the unfavorable prognosis that Walsh made for the application of continuum sources in AAS, time and again experiments have been made with such sources. Contin- uum sources demand a spectral apparatus with a very high power of resolution. In his first paper about AAS, WALSH [61351 showed that a monochromator with a resolution of at least 2 pm was necessary to measure the line profiles of absorption lines. Walsh was also doubtful whether there would be enough radiant energy in this small interval to provide a usable S/N ratio. This was confirmed in the earliest papers published on the use of continuum sources since the sensitivity obtained was around two powers of ten lower than with HCLs 138401. A little later, however, FASSEL et (11. I18511, by using a 150 W xenon arc lamp or a 650 W halogen lamp, were able to attain sensitivities for a number of elements that were comparable to those obtained using HCLs. Similar results were also reported by MCGEE and WINEFORDNER 140161, and KELIHER and WOHLERS [3070]. However, the calibration curves in many cases were significantly more non- linear than when using HCLs. More recently the application of continuum lamps as the primary source has been judged increasingly positive. In a review article, MARSHALL et I .2 Sir Alan Walsh and the Period 1952-1 962 I I al. 139031 particularly emphasize the possibility of performing multieleinent analyses in AAS. The first really convincing application of continuum sources in AAS come from ZANDER et al. 16515,65161, O’HAVER et al. 144091, and HARNLY and O’HAVER 123861. These authors used xenon arc lamps with a power of 150-300 W, an Echelle polychro- mator, and wavelength modulation with a quartz refractor plate. This permitted meas- urements to be performed at various positions along the line profile. HARNLY 123891 and also O’HAVER and MESSMAN 144101 have published review articles on their experience of using continuum sources for multielement AAS. The greatest problem for the application of continuum sources is that the radiant in- tensity of the xenon arc lamps normally employed falls off drastically below 280 nm 144091. SMITH et a l . [5460] found that at the zinc line at 213.9 nm a line radiation source emits 500 times more photons than a continuum source. To overcome this problem, experiments have been performed more recently to pulse continuum sources 14209, 4210, 51601 or to use flash lamps 14591 since the radiant intensity is higher over a short time interval. Lasers, whose properties, such as intensity and spectral bandwidth, can be optimized for practically every spectroscopic experiment, have been proposed as radiation sources. Tunable dye lasers can be set to virtually any atomic line between 2 13 nm and 900 nm with a bandwidth corresponding to the natural line width of an atomic line. These prop- erties would seem to make them suitable for use in analytical atomic spectroscopy [ 18071. Despite the extremely good spectroscopic properties of tunable dye lasers there are a number of practical and economic reasons why they have not found their way into common use: these laser systems are expensive, frequently unreliable, and difficult to operate. In contrast to dye lasers, diode lasers would seem to be more suitable to one day re- place HCLs and EDLs. Diode lasers are cheap, reliable, easy to operate, and have long lifetimes [2519, 43621. HERCENRODEK and NIEMAX 125181 presented a laser AAS in - strument in which the HCL had been replaced by a diode laser tuned to the absorption wavelength. The monochromator with photomultiplier could then be replaced by a sim- ple semiconductor photodiode [3470]. These authors point to a number of advantages of laser AAS which can be ascribed to the fact that, in contrast to HCLs and EDLs, lasers are sources with selectable wavelengths. It is possible to set the wavelength to the flank of an absorption line, thus allowing higher analyte concentrations to be determined. The background in the direct neighborhood of the absorption line can be measured and cor- rected, or a reference element can be measured. Similar suggestions for the use of diode lasers as sources in AAS have also come from the group around WINEFORDNER 1377, 378,4339-43411 and from AXNER [3562]. As attractive as laser AAS may appear, it is unlikely that it will attain practical sig- nificance in this century. The reason lies in the wavelength range available to diode la- sers. Currently the lowest reachable wavelengths are around 660-670 nm [ 377, 378, 34701. By cooling to 0 “C or with liquid nitrogen, respectively, it has been possible to come down to 620 nm or 585 nm, but this technique is unsuitable for routine use. Even with frequency doubling in crystals it is likely to take years until the important wave- length range for AAS of 190-325 nm can be attained with diode lasers 134701. 12 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry 1.4 Single-beam, Double-beam, Single-channel, Multi-channel The first AAS instrument presented by WALSH and co-workers in Melbourne in 1954 was a double-beam spectrometer. WALSH recalls that 'after our initial experiments we regarded this as absolutely necessary because of the poor stability of many of our HCLs' [ 6 1371. Resulting from the close contact that Walsh had with Perkin-Elmer (compare Section 1.2), the first AAS instrument developed by that company, the Model 303, was a double-beam spectrometer (Figure 1-8). \\ / FIELD LENS , \\ CHOPPER \\ IMAGES M5 FLAME P U P I L BEAM RECOMBINER Figure 1-8. Beam path of the Perkin-Elmer Model 303 double-beam spectrometer (from [ 29901). The 'do-it-yourself' instruments produced by Walsh et ul. from I958 obviously had to be of simple design and thus employed the single-beam principle. From these begin- nings the Techtron company later developed a complete atomic absorption spectrometer that was also a single-beam instrument. Likewise, the early instruments manufactured by Hilger and Watts and several other companies were also single-beam spectrometers, since they were built from existing emission spectrometers or their components. The question as to the better principle-single-beam or double-beam-split AAS theorists and users into two often hostile camps for more than two decades. The greatest advantage ascribed to single-beam instruments was the use of a minimum number of optical components and thus a lower loss of radiant energy. Long term stability was seen as the major advantage of double-beam spectrometers. A number of authors showed that the precision attainable with a single-beam spectrometer was in fact better [5559], espe- cially at low absorbance values near to the limit of detection [3518]. Under these condi- tions noise is mainly due to photon noise, lamp flicker noise, and flame noise. Even at an early stage a number of authors recognized that measurements with a sin- gle-beam spectrometer were virtually independent of larger fluctuations in the operating conditions, provided that a sufficiently large number of reference measurements were performed 134 181. Electrical circuits for drift correction were also described that pro- vided drift-free signals for several hours I57 161. I .4 Single-beam, Double-beam, Single-channel, Multi-channel 13 Nowadays there is more or less general agreement that the advantages of double- beam spectrometers frequently have been overvalued. The double-beam principle can merely compensate for changes in intensity of the radiation source and changes in sensi- tivity of the detector, but not drift phenomena in the atomizer, such as the warmup of a burner. Further, it has been shown that during the warinup phase of a radiation source, not only the radiant intensity, but also the line profile, and thus the sensitivity, change 113.571. This means rhat even with a double-beam instrument a certain warmup time is required. But since the quality of radiation sources nowadays is significantly better than in the early days of AAS and their radiant intensity changes only very slowly after a relatively short warmup time, increasing numbers of single-beam instruments are coming into use that have double-beam characteristics by automatically measuring and correct- ing thebaseline chrectly piior to the measurement. As well as classical monochromators, resmmce defectors were investigated in the early days of AAS. SULLIVAN and WALSH 15682, 5683, 56861 reported the use of reso- nance detectors as ‘ monochromators’ in atomic absorption spectrometers. The mode of operation of a resonance detector is depicted schematically in Figure 1-9. After passing through the atomizer, the spectral radiation emitted from the primary source falls on the resonance detector. The detector consists of a device for producing a cloud of neutral analyte atoms, similar to an HCL. If the radiation passing through the atomizer again falls on analyte atoms in the ground state. the radiation of the resonance lines is ab- sorbed, while the remaining (noii-absorbable) radiation passes through the atom cloud. The absorbed resonance radiation excites the metal atoms to fluoresce. The fluorescent radiation can be measured, for example, by a detector at right angles to the incident ra- diation beam. The fluorescence signal is proportional to the absorbed radiation. Since the spectrum of the fluorescence radiation consists only of spectral lines that were absorbed by the cloud of atoms, resonance detectors can take over the function of the monochromator. I t was shown experimentally that, due to the absence of non- absorbable background radiation, the calibration curves obtained with resonance detec- tors were linear over a wider range than those obtained when the radiation of the primary source falls directly on the detector. The major disadvantages of this type of detector are that only a small portion of the fluorescence radiation emitted in all directions falls on the radiation detector and that an individual resonance detector is required for each ele- ment. Resonance detectors were thus used only rarely in practice [746] and are nowadays merely of academic interest. 1 El- + Figure 1-9.

They employed several HCLs that irradiated a flame in different positions and the radiation was intercepted by resonance detectors. Likewise, MAVRODINEANU and HUGHES [ 39841 described a multichannel spectrometer that oper- ated with several HCLs and detectors. The design of this spectrometer is depicted in Figure 1-10. BUTLER and STRASHEIM [982] developed a simultaneous instrument with several HCLs and a movable detector. MITCHELL et ul. (41381 used a Vidicon detector to construct a multichannel atomic absorption spectrometer and were able to determine ten elements simultaneously. BUSCH and MORRISON 19761 published a review on the early attempts to construct multielement instruments. Figure 1-10.

In subsequent years, numerous attempts were made to construct multielement atomic absorption spectrometers. In most cases two to four elements could be determined either simultaneously or in rapid sequence. Normally, classical components such as HCLs or EDLs, mono- or polychromators, and conventional detectors were employed [ 108, 414, 1622, 3343, 347 1, 4275, 48541. Such instruments were characterized by insufficient sensitivity or poor S/N ratio [414, 4275, 48541, or by a lack of tlexibility 13343, 34711. Typical for this is the suggestion by LUNDBERG and JOHANSSON 1.36581 to use a multi- element HCL and a rotating sector disk that allowed the radiation of three elements to fall in rapid sequence on the detector. This instrument is naturally restricted to the three elements for which it was built. A much more tlexible concept was developed by the group around O’HAVER [6515, 65 I61 on the basis of a continuum source. The principle problems for the use of contin- uum sources, which had already been recognized by Walsh, were overcome in a very elegant manner. O’Haver and co-workers used a very intense xenon arc lamp, an Echelle polychromator of high resolution, and wavelength modulation through an oscillating quartz plate. An advantage of this system is that the resolution of the Echelle polychro- mator is roughly in the same magnitude as the width of an atomic line I 307 I ] , so that spectral overlap is hardly to be expected. At the same time the non-absorbable radiation is effectively masked and thus a sensitivity comparable to normal AAS attained. I .S The Non-specific Attenuation of Radiation 15 Nevertheless, the problem of the simultaneous determination of several analytes by AAS has only been satisfactorily solved in recent years after the combination o f Echelle polychrornators and matrix detectors 14783,4784, 53321 (see Section 3.7). 1.5 The Non-specific Attenuation of Radiation As already recognized by Walsh (compare Section 1.2), the selectivity and specificity of AAS arebaseh on the use of element-spedifiche sources, modulat‘ion of tWis rahiat‘ion, and selective amplification. Nevertheless, within the atomizer the radiation can be at- tenuated not only by atomic absorption but also by a number of other effects that have been known collectively as ‘non-specific’ or ‘background absorption’. The most frequent causes are radiation absorption by gaseous molecules and radiation scattering on parti- cles within the absorption volume. These effects were recognized in principle at an early stage and described by a num- ber of authors. As early as 1962, WILLIS 163381 showed that radiation losses, caused by scattering on particles or absorption by molecules not dissociated in the tlame, led to errors that could not be corrected by the analyte addition technique. In 1965 B l r ~ l ~ l N G s [ 6361 measured the radiation scattering caused by various salts at higher concentrations in an air-propane flame. Through the use of an air-acetylene flame and a premix burner, background attenuation is not a serious problem, at least not for solutions whose con- centrations are not too high. Thus in his monograph on AAS published in 1968, SLAVIN [54 131 devoted only one page to interferences caused by radiation scattering. In graphite furnaces however, and especially in the longitudinally-heated version proposed by Massmann, very high non-specific attenuation of radiation can be observed. GUCER and MASSMANN [ 22561 made very detailed investigations on molecular spectra in graphite furnaces and recorded the dissociation continua of a number of alkali metal halides (see Section 5.4.1. I ) . The major problem in the 1960s was that there were no suitable means for eliminat- ing non-specific attenuation. The frequent recommendation to use a ‘matrix blank sam- ple’, which exhibits the same background absorption as the true sample but does not contain the analyte, could rarely be performed in practice. Such matrix blank samples are seldom available and attempts to prepare them synthetically mostly fail due to the high purity requirements placed on each constituent. Furthermore, the composition of the concomitants often varies from sample to sample and their true content is frequently unknown. Most procedures originally proposed for the elimination of background attenuation were based on the fact that while atomic absorption occurs in a very narrow spectral range, molecular absorption and radiation scattering are both broad band phenomena. One such procedure is the reference elerneizt technique in which the absorption of an- other element at a neighboring wavelength is measured and subtracted from the absorp- tion at the analytical wavelength. A prerequisite for this technique is naturally that the reference element is not contained in the sample. Further, ‘broad band’ does not mean that the background attenuation remains constant over a range of several tens of nano- meters. Thus for measurement of the background attenuation using the reference element 16 I The Historical Development of‘ Atomic Absorption Spectrometry technique the ‘next best’ element must be chosen [ S S 3 0 ] , i.e., the element whose wave- length lies closest to the analytical wavelength. Frequently, however, the next-lying absorption line is so far removed that only a qualitative estimation of the background attenuation at the analytical line can be made. WI12LIs [6339 I and SLAVIN [S406 I therefore proposed correcting background at- tenuation by me~isurirzg the effect (it a non-absorbable line. Although such lines do not exhibit element-specific absorption, they can be attenuated by scattering o r molecular absorption, i.e., exhibit background attenuation. The advantage of using such lines for correction is that any radiation attenuation measured can only be non-specific, and that many more non-absorbable lines are available than absorption lines. Nevertheless, even this technique is not sufficiently accurate and requires two sequential measurements at different lines. In 1965, KO~KTYOHANN and PICKETT [3196] proposed using a continuurn source in addition to the line source for quasi-simultaneous measurement of the total attenuation and the background attenuation. The atomic absorption signal is obtained by subtraction. The first commercial system for automatic background correction (BC) based o n the principle proposed by KOIRTYOHANN and PICKETT 13 1961 was introduced in 1968 129941. Among other things this principle was chosen because i t could be incorporated without notable changes into the then most widely used double-beam spectrometer, the Perkin-Elmer Model 303. As depicted in Figure 1 - 1 I , the sector mirror which originally served to split the beam was used to send radiation from the HCL and a deuterium lamp in rapid sequence through the flame. The radiation from the deuterium lamp was proc- essed as the reference signal by the electrical measuring system (for details see Section 3.4.1 ). 0’ Figure 1-11. Schematic of the background cor- rector used i n the Model 303. 1 - HCL; 2 ~ con- tinuum source: 3 - rotating sector mirror (from [ 2994 j). Although this system of BC represented a considerable improvement compared to the usual practice at that time, nevertheless its limitations soon became apparent. MASSMANN (39381 pointed out that continuum sources were not capable of correcting the background attenuation caused by electron excitation spectra since these consist of many narrow lines. These spectra are based on electronic transitions in the molecules. The structure ofthe bands is derived from the transitions of the rotational and the various vibrational levels of the one electronic state to the rotational and vibrational levels of the other electronic state, i.e., between discrete energy states of the molecule. DE GALAN 120431 and MASSMANN 1.3938, 3941 I in particular repeatedly stressed that the uncontrolled use of a background corrector cannot guarantee correct results; in fact it may even introduce errors. I t is important when analyzing unknown samples to work 1.5 The Non-specific Attenuation of Radiation 17 both with and without BC. In this way important information about the appearance and magnitude of background attenuation can be obtained that would otherwise be lost when working solely with BC. Among other things this is important because the accuracy of BC decreases with increasing background attenuation. MARKS et ul. 138911 pointed out a further source of error that can occur when using continuum sources for BC; radiation from the continuum source can be absorbed by atoms of concomitant elements within the spectral bandwidth passed by the monochro- mator. The result here is also overcompensation. MANNING [3857] reported a spectral interference of this sort in the determination of selenium in the presence of iron, and VAJDA 15973 1 found a whole series of similar examples. Although these limitations of continuum source BC have been known for years, many analysts have had a blind faith in the infallibility of background correction. Espe- cially in graphite furnace AAS (GF AAS) this led to considerable errors. For example, virtually all determinations of chromium in biological materials performed prior to I978 must be viewed with skepsis owing to incomplete BC [2295, 60141. The same is true for the determination of selenium in blood due to the presence of iron 12963, 3497, 3857, 50391. In a review article, SLAVIN and CARNRICK [5434] presented a multitude of similar examples. In work published in 1966 and 1967, BARRINGER [395] and LING [3533] found that improved BC could be achieved by using radiation close to the analytical line rather than with continuum sources. They utilized the principle of self-reversal of resonance lines where the line is strongly broadened and thus the original wavelength virtually disap- pears. In 1983 SMITH and HIEFTJE [5474] took up the proposals of Barringer and Ling for BC using high currerzt pulsing. The total absorption is measured while operating the HCL under normal conditions, then the lamp is pulsed with a high current, which leads to self-reversal (refer to Sections 2.3.3 and 3.4.3), so that the background is measured with the strongly broadened line close to the analytical line. This technique has the prin- cipal disadvantage that it can only be applied to volatile elements since only these exhibit sufficient self-reversal. Additionally, a considerable loss in sensitivity can occur. Compared to continuum source BC, high current pulsing has the advantage of re- quiring only one lamp. Further, higher background attenuation can be corrected. Com- pared to Zeeman-effect BC (discussed below), high current pulsing has the major disad- vantage that the signal dissipates only slowly so that a lower modulation frequency is required which, together with the above mentioned loss in sensitivity, makes it unattrac- tive for GF AAS. For flame AAS, on the other hand, continuum source BC is usually adequate. A by far more efficient system for BC, especially for GF AAS, is obtained by utiliz- ing the Zeernun effect (refer to Sections 2.6 and 3.4.2). As early as 1969, PRUGGER and TORGE [4721] applied for a patent for the upplication qf’ the Zeemun +>ct ,for hack- ground correction. Shortly thereafter HADEISHI and MCLAUCHLIN [ 23061 worked on the same subject. In the following years, especially in Japan, the application of the Zeeman effect for BC was studied intensely 12307, 321 1, 32121. However, the first really effec- tive system for BC in GF AAS was not introduced until 1981 [ 18921. The reason for this is to be found in the multitude of ways in which the Zeeman effect can be applied in AAS. It took a relatively long period until the optimum way had been found. 18 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry The Zeeman effect-the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field-is treated in detail in Section 2.6. However, the technical application to BC is mentioned here very briefly. As depicted in Figure 1-12, the magnet can be mounted at either the radiation source or the atomizer; the magnetic field can be orientated either parallel or perpen- dicular to the radiation beam, and a constant or an alternating magnetic field can be ap- plied. These possibilities give eight different configurations (refer to Section 3.4.2). Nevertheless they differ in part considerably in their realization, application and, above all, in their performance. 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . '. ,' I L- 1 2 3 4 5 \\ ,Or; I . Figure 1-12.

PKUGGER and TORGE 147213 used a permanent magnet mounted at the radiation source with the magnetic field at right angles to the radiation beam path. The same con- figuration was also examined later by KOIZUMI and YASUDA [ 32081, and STEPHENS and RYAN 15567, 55681. From 1971, HADEISHI e ta / . [2306, 23071 made extensive studies of various Zeeman systems. They started by examining a longitudinal constant field at the radiation source. As will be shown later (Section 3.4.2), no atomic absorption can be measured using this configuration since the radiation is split into two components-one component (0') is shifted to shorter wavelengths while the other ( ( T - ) is shifted to longer-and the actual analytical line disappears from the spectrum. Hadeishi used an EDL filled with the pure isotope '\"Hg (or in later work with the isotope leXHg) as the radiation source. In a suitable magnetic field (about 0.7 Tesla), the isotope line splits in such a way that the (z component coincides with the center of the absorption line for natural mercury, while the 0' component is situated at the far end of the absorption pro- file. The atomic absorption and background attenuation are measured with the (T- com- ponent, while the background attenuation alone is measured with the (I+ component. A rotating polarizer is used to discriminate between the polarized (I components. This pro- cedure can naturally be used only for the given element and can thus be regarded as a scientific curiosity, rather than a generally applicable technique. 1 .S The Non-specific Attenuation of Radiation 19 The configuration of the magnet at the radiation source, which was used almost ex- clusively in earlier studies, has a number of principal problems. The greatest is that con- ventional HCLs cannot be operated in a magnetic field and EDLs only with reduced performance. Mercury is the only element that has a sufficiently high vapor pressure to emit stably under these conditions. It is therefore hardly surprising that the initial inves- tigations on the Zeeman effect were concerned with this element almost exclusively [2306-2308, 3208 I . With other elements, even when they form highly volatile halides, the EDL must be heated to between 250 \"C and 300 \"C to obtain a vapor pressure of around 1 kPa. This vapor pressure is required if the radiation source should emit stably when run at 2 W power at 100 MHz 13209, 646.51. After evaluating more than sixty pub- lications on EDLs HADEISHI 123 1 1 ] came to the conclusion that this type of source can be used routinely only for elements of high vapor pressure. For other elements it would be necessary to develop special sources that emit stably in a strong magnetic field. For a number of elements, STEPHENS [5.569] constructed capacitively coupled sources, run at a relatively low frequency of 2 MHz, that were magnetically stable. KOIZUMI and YASUDA 132101 designed a lamp in which the anode and the cathode were in the form of two parallel plates. This source was operated at 500 V under a high fre- quency field of 100 MHz. MURPHY and STEVENS [ 4247 I attempted to run conventional HCLs at 2.5 MHz, but found that the cathodes were destroyed rather quickly. Other attempts to operate HCLs in strong magnetic fields were also not particularly successful [.5570, 5.5721. HADEISHI [23 101 developed a 'magnetically concentrated' lamp for low-volatile ele- ments in which the cathode could be exchanged to permit a change of element. To re- duce self-absorption to a minimum, operating conditions had to be maintained by con- tinuous evacuation and supply of argon. The magnetic field localized the discharge in this lamp so that a high radiant power could be attained [6361 1. Nevertheless, HADEISHI [231 I ] regarded the high technical requirements with special lamps as the greatest disad- vantage of the direct Zeeman effect with the magnetic field at the radiation source. Resulting from these difficulties with sources located in the magnetic field, from the middle of the 1970s investigations were increasingly made with the magnetic field at the atomizer. The investigations by KOIZUMI and YASUDA [3211, 32121, DAWSON et a/ . [ 14431, and FERNANDEZ et al. [ 18901 are mentioned in particular. These authors used a constant magnetic field, which did not however prove to be optimum. Constant magnetic fields, regardless of whether they are applied at the source or the atomizer, often lead to a loss in sensitivity, and to strong curvature and 'rollover' of the calibration curves. The ideal system, a longitudinal alternating field at the atomizer, was first described in 197.5 by UCHIDA and HATTORI [.5946] and a year later by OTRUBA et al. 1 4499 1. These publications received little interest, however, probably because in both cases a flame was used for atomization, and continuum source BC is normally fully adequate for this type of atomizer. In retrospect it can be seen that the Zeeman effect took so long to become established as a technique for BC because all work published earlier used unsuitable configurations. Time and again i t can be observed that a system which offers principal advantages can- not establish itself if there are technical problems (design of new lamps), or analytical 20 1 The Historical Development of Atomic Absorption Spectrometry disadvantages (loss in sensitivity, rollover of the calibration curves), or badly selected applications. From 1978 DE LOOS-VOLLEBKECT and DE GALAN 12042, 35851 made detailed stud- ies on the various configurations for utilizing the Zeeman effect for the measurement and correction of background attenuation in GF AAS. They came to the conclusion that in principle a longitudinal alternating field at the atomizer would be the best, but that this might require too many compromises with re"
