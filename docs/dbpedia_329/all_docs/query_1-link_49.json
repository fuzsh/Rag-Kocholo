        "text": "Steve Coogan is a bit of a Marmite comedian, a straw poll of some JL staff fell into two camps, you either love him or hate him. The very fact that I coughed up 30 quid to watch an hour and a half of weird and wonderful comedy from himself and a small group of ensemble players should give you an idea of what camp I firmly sit in. Never seemingly out of the national news for long with a series of real life adventures that sometimes cause his less than savoury characters to pale by comparison, Mr. Coogan started by appearing( somewhat nervously at first) as the man mad Pauline calf and then once finding his rhythm slipped into something more comfortable as her less than desirable brother Paul ,as he zoomed onstage in a wheelchair .opening with an impression of Steven Hawking, his venomous tongue making frequent joke mileage throughout the whole show at the expense of Tv hardman Ross Kemp. The ensemble players serving as filler acts while costume changes ensued. Several more minor characters including the rock fan Saxondale appeared (a bit too close for comfort and too well observed for my liking!) and gave us fans what we wanted :a tirade against the world and all that was wrong with it. But it was in the second half that Coogan appeared as his most famous alter ego the broadcasting god that is Alan Partridge .The crowd roared its approval as he walked Onstage singing a medley of out of date pop songs, sporting a natty silk bomber jacket and cheap white jeans he spun round to reveal his show was sponsored by…..Whiskers! It really was enough to make a cat laugh! Especially as he walked down to shake hands in person with lucky devotees in the front row.\n\nA mock guest couple was interrogated about how successful they had become after following Alan’s Self help book and in Alan’s blatant but likable product placement way slipped in a clever reference to the apparent need of the BBC to give him a 13 part series for him to chat about his book! The Coogan onstage show had been recently criticised in the Liverpool press and this I feel lead to one or two hecklers on the night being quickly dispatched by the rapier tongue of Mr.Coogan much to the delight of the audience who by now were firmly behind our hero. The show ended with another quick change and a self deprecating song the title of which was too rude to reveal here; Steve Coogan singing about the failings of one ….Steve Coogan, I could not help but see that like most tortured geniuses (Rob Gaffney!) a genuine human was beneath the comic mask and was appealing from the heart to be liked and admired and that made the show all the more poignant. The production was short at around one and a half hours but as long as you went with a broadminded approach it was certainly sweet.\n\nAlan walsh.\n\nI found out today that an old friend is about to be euthanised.I,m sad because that friend is dumb ,has helped people safely home in all weathers and has never ever complained or asked for anything in return.I was supported by the friend through most of my formative years and the friend was in the background as I had one of my first teenage snogs.When I walked my first pet and had the odd afternoon out bonding with my sadly long gone parents.,the friend was there too.That friend is the Seaforth Radar Station viewed at its best from Crosby beach and in a short sited burst of redevelopment enthusiasm the powers that be are about to pull it down.\n\nFor those of you who have been drawn to the beach like bees around a honeypot by the very excellent Anthony Gormley Installation ‘Another Place’,I would be surprised if you have never glanced around and been impressed or at least wondered about a building that at first looks like someone had physically picked it up from a Berlin wall jumble sale and transplanted it at the mouth of the Mersey.\n\nThe building itself has an impressive technological history ,being an integral part of the Seaforth docks development scheme that was one of the wonders of the Liverpool world when it opened for receiving world wide cargo including the dreaded shipping containers that sounded the death bell for hundreds of local dockers jobs (Including my fathers)the new dock scheme was a reminder of the Harold Wilson “White heat of technology”.Liverpool and in particular this piece of allegedly brutal architecture was home to the country’s first port assisted radar that helped guide ships large and small to safe harbour.\n\nThat’s the history lesson bit and if you are still awake I do have a point to get to.\n\nI,m a sentimental old fool.In a technological irony not overlooked by me ,the need for this structure has been replaced by advances such as satellite navigation and it is now no longer required.Having said that, the owners ,the MDHC offered to open the structure to bird watchers and the like ,to generate a fresh new use for the building but sadly that offer has been rejected in favour of the more avant guard .My interest is more emotive ,less tangible.In the days when the whole beach area was a lot less popular and more isolated than it is now;to me it conjures up visions of underage lads spending long hot late sixties summers,riding Raleigh ‘Riviera’ bikes on a quiet Sunday morning quite illegally around the building site that was that radar station.It was a bit like an old ‘Mission Impossible’ episode,one of our advanced party had found a slashed section of chain link fence.In the normal spy caper the agent would be clad in black from head to foot with all he needed within a small black rucksack.Had the pathway been more popular in those days than it is now our small gang of four must have looked ridiculous forcing conventional bikes with ‘sit up and beg’ handlebars through the broken fence.I don’t suppose my Hawian style shirt from T.J. Hughes would have added to the low profile spy image ! You could smell the teenage bravado as we climbed the concrete steps of that tower probably long before any coastguard operative did.It was just a husk then .No doors, glassless windows and stark concrete and breezeblock interior.It was probably the closest you could get to a bunker with a view.It was cool and shelter for us to drink our orange cordial and nibble on our penguin biscuits.We made several Sunday forages onto the site as kids ,doing what kids do best; exploring without the risk of nanny state intervention.It was a place of safety not just for mariners but for our imaginations too.It was a space station,it was London airport guiding down Gerry Andersons ‘Fireflash’ Supersonic aircraft.It was a bunker as we played in our naïve way attacking the russians with pretend nuclear missles.It was a place of safety in a boring Sunday world of catholic masses and lamb dinners with mince sauce.If I have one strong memory of our times there it was the day we discovered a working phone had been installed by contractors.My mate Kevin made a brilliant suggestion that he would ring his auntie and see how she was.What he neglected to tell us was that she lived in Germany.For some bizarre reason he happened to have her number in a battered Collins diary in his saddle bag.As he dialled we kept watch looking for the ‘border guards’(read site security) that patrolled the DMZ between Crosby and the no mans land of Seaforth docks.The irony of ringing a German from our bunker was not lost on us and we laughed and teased and made Hitler jokes as he struggled to make himself heard above the din.\n\nSadly, shortly afterwards the site was secured and we could no longer access it from Crosby Beach. But the memories lingered on years later as I coughed and wheezed my way fitness running along the path that ran alongside the site. Now the tower is to be replaced by a bold new Liverpool observatory and I cant help thinking that old and new would have complimented each other. Maybe I’m being selfish here, why can’t they bulldoze the eyesore that is the old marina club that has been left to rot? These days the whole of the marina at Crosby is reminiscent of New Yorks Central Park when the sun arrives. Families and dogs come out to play. Couples court and kites fly. In the distance the tower watches. It’s a bloody landmark for god’s sake! Would you pull down the Liver building? I don’t suppose Ill get to go up that tower again legally or illegally before its destroyed in an act of vandalism that will meet with the approval of the art correctness brigade. But at the back of my mind maybe just maybe I’m morning the passing of my youth and long gone friendships. Would it not be good to stay young, be master again of all I surveyed across the River Mersey and bring the ‘Fire flash’ safely into land one more time. Just don’t bill me for that telephone call; in today’s climate the compound interest would pay for a new tower!"
