        "text": "From the role of COO at CombineNet, Rich became CEO at CombineNet in 2012. Within this role he maintained responsibility for product strategy and direction, engineering, IT operations, and customer support and service delivery to CombineNet's global clients.\n\nRich successfully, personally led many of the largest engagements and sourcing events, including the largest global air freight sourcing event ever conducted (43 airlines, $1.5 billion).Rich later became the founder and leader in operations research at US Airways, as well as supporting Oracle as a transportation consultant.With many years of work with CPOs understanding their challenges and needs for leveraging sourcing technology to best advantage, Rich is able to advise Keelvar on how best to serve its customers across many industries.\n\nâWhat excites me about Keelvar? The team. Period. These are exceptional people--engineers, professional services, sales and marketing. People who understand what procurement professionals and their companies need and are able to deliver it.â\n\nPreviously a lecturer in Artificial Intelligence in University College Corkâs Computer Science Department, Alan specialized in Optimization, Game Theory and Algorithmic Mechanism Design. Alan founded Keelvar in September 2012 when he left the University to commercialize advances in AI for procurement teams.\n\nâ\n\nAlanâs specialist knowledge in Optimization, Game Theory and Mechanism Design gives Keelvar an edge in terms of innovating with offerings that exceed competitorsâ technical capabilities. This enables Keelvar to define an entirely new category of the solution, putting Keelvar in an ideal position to lead this new category that Keelvar has called Autonomous Sourcing.\n\nâ\n\nWinning the Cork Company of the Year in the small company category in Keelvarâs first year, and moving on to be awarded a Gartner Cool vendor award more recently has highlighted Keelvarâs international progress.\n\nâ\n\nâWe are transforming a space that has a huge potential to impact the lives of everyone on the planet. Our customers manage over â¬90bn in spend annually using our software so we are excited about how Artificial Intelligence can transform how suppliers engage with big business for win-win outcomes.â\n\nâ\n\nDavid is a technology pioneer with nearly three decades of experience defining and communicating the strategic direction for innovative technology companies. He was the co-founding CEO of Cape Clear Software, which was started in 1999 and raised $50 million in investment capital from leading VC firms through its acquisition by Workday in 2008.At Workday, he served in various technology and product leadership roles, ultimately serving as CTO, while the company grew from its early stages into a leading global cloud ERP provider.\n\nAs Keelvar's Board Chair, David helps to direct and advise Keelvar as the company advances its product development and accelerates growth in the market.\n\n\"What attracted me to invest in Keelvar and join as Board Chair is primarily the quality and depth of its technology and team. I'm also highly impressed by the customer success they have achieved in applying very advanced techniques to create better, easier ways to optimize and automate strategic and routine sourcing processes.\"\n\nAs Chief Technology Officer, Valentina leads the Engineering and Product departments in our goal to develop innovative products and to continuously improve our existing solutions.\n\nPreviously VP of Customer Success, Valentina has our customers and products at the forefront of her mind. She is committed to delivering value, ensuring both new and existing users are successful in their use of our software solutions, and promoting a customer-centric mindset across the organization.
