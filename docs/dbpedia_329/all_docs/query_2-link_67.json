        "text": "These are two completely different things. Don’t use inline styles - EVER - but totally use Bootstrap, if you want.\n\nI doubt that any potential employer is going to look at your resume, see “Bootstrap” in your list of skills, and start jumping up and down on their bed, squealing with excitement. Like any other framework or library you learn, it’s not likely going to be the key to you getting a job anywhere. However, like any other framework or library you learn, Bootstrap makes use of concepts and conventions that you’ll see all over web development, so knowing Bootstrap does tell others that you have a grasp of some fundamental vocabulary which is common in front end programming. This makes it valuable to learn.\n\nThe main reason you should learn Bootstrap (or Foundation, or any other CSS framework) is so you can build the FreeCodeCamp projects quickly and without having to worry about much about the style. Don’t expect yourself to be a CSS wizard. Focus on the JavaScript.\n\nHello! I always see posts like this, not only here in FCC, but also in front-end communities. In my opinion, frameworks are reality and make you produce faster. Obviously, to be a better developer, you should learn how to build things from scratch, but Bootstrap can obviously save a lot of time. This is particularly important if you are willing to find a real dev job, where you’ll have to deliver real projects in short periods of time. So, study the foundations of CSS and HTML to be able to use not only bootstrap, but any framework that cross your path. (So answering your question: yay!).\n\nps: never use inline CSS, this is a really bad practice and will make your code look way worse.\n\nI think you are getting somewhat confused about classes, css, bootstrap, etc. The above posts pointed out very well that using classes in not using inline elements. Keep in mind that Bootstrap is nothing more than css that is already written for you. (And it is written by Twitter… so yes, it is very good css…)\n\nAs a beginner, bootstrap is a - yay! When you get started, you should be able to start building things almost immediately. If you ignore bootstrap like some people do, you end up spending many long hours trying to implement basic things like containers, rows, and responsive media queries that Bootstrap already has. So, I say definitely start out with some Bootstrap (although you should at least know the rudiments of CSS).\n\nAs a intermediate developer, Bootstrap is a - meh. To many people who started off with Bootstrap become attached to it - so much to the point that they would not be able to build a decent looking site without it. This is a big problem, because just adding class names is great at first, but when you get older, its time to set down the baby bottle and pick up a fork.\n\nAs a professional developer, Bootstrap is a - YAY!!! Once you can build a basic site, and you understand how Bootstrap works “under the hood”, its potential shines. When you get a job, you can build a site much faster with Bootstrap than someone who does it all himself. A site that might take you 20 hours to build vanilla, could be built in about 5. You now how more time to get more jobs == more money.\n\nBootstrap is definitely something you should know. So is jQuery. Some people try to reinvent the wheel when they start out and do everything themselves. You don’t have to be that person, but you don’t have to be the guy either who has been programming for over a year and still relies on Bootstrap for all his sites."
