He will also work to grow Wincor Nixdorf's successful service business in the U.S. Wincor Nixdorf has recently made great strides within its service business in the U.S., including announcing the availability of its innovative eServices platform that connects Wincor Nixdorf service management with service customers via an electronic network.\n\nPrior to his new position at Wincor Nixdorf, Walsh served as managing director for Wincor Nixdorf Ireland. He was a key factor in the successful turnaround of the organization, quickly turning Wincor Nixdorf Ireland into a fully developed service organization focused on direct customer relationships and a market share of nearly 50 percent in 2004. Additionally, under Walsh's leadership, Wincor Nixdorf Ireland secured a significant outsourcing agreement with Bank of Ireland. Bank of Ireland chose Wincor Nixdorf to manage its off-site cash dispensing network, over 600 ATM terminals, making the financial institution the first major customer of Wincor Nixdorf's outsourcing business.\n\n\"Wincor Nixdorf USA is now a supplier of hardware, software and services for more than 400 customers in industries like retail, petrol, hospitality, banking and postal services,\" said Javier Lopez-Bartolome, president, Wincor Nixdorf USA. \"In the four years since he has been with Wincor Nixdorf, Alan has made a tremendous impact on our company. In his role as the new vice president of banking, he is already making significant progress in building out our direct sales teams and strategic partner business,\" Lopez-Bartolome continued. \"Alan is uniquely qualified to take on the role as vice president of banking and I am pleased to congratulate him on his new position at Wincor Nixdorf.\"\n\n\"Wincor Nixdorf offers a rich history of innovation, commitment to customers, a strong global presence, and a customer base that includes many of the world's most well-known financial institutions,\" said Alan Walsh. \"Wincor Nixdorf continues to strengthen and grow its business in the U.S., and we do not intend on slowing down. I look forward to being a part of and leading Wincor Nixdorf Banking USA.\"\n\nA native of Ireland, Walsh received his degree in software engineering from the Carlow Institute of Technology."
