        "text": "Stepping out and competing for the last time is a bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, you can take stock of the halcyon days of your playing career and revel in their highs. But on the other, you know stepping off that field you’re walking into a totally\n\ndifferent world.\n\nKnowing what you want to do, where to go for guidance, or where your skills can be put to best use isn’t easy and the sheer breadth of possibilities is daunting. The good news, however, is that FutureProof understands this better than most and is\n\ndedicated to helping athletes find their next challenge.\n\nIn a recent story here on the blog we spoke to Palmer Foster, a professional athlete turned salesperson in the fintech sector for his advice and heard how the fintech industry has felt like a natural home.\n\nTo follow, we caught up with a strategic partnerships leader for Trade Ledger, one of the fastest-growing businesses in the fintech space, Alan Walsh.\n\nWith an incredible wealth of experience working for financial stalwarts like Barclays, Santander and American Express, Alan moved into fintech six years ago and hasn’t looked back since.\n\nIn this piece, Alan explains his move into fintech and tells us why the sector is perfectly suited for athletes and an exciting industry to be in.\n\nThe appeal of fintech\n\n“Fintech has exploded over the last few years as new technologies are rapidly affecting how the financial services industry operates,” says Alan. “It’s all about how we can do things better, faster, easier and more cost-effective for customers.”\n\nThe industry has emerged as the fastest-growing tech sector and boasts some of the fastest-growing companies in business. It’s an industry that’s awash with investment and represents, according to Alan, one of the biggest opportunities for anyone, but\n\nespecially athletes.\n\n“With investment comes competition and it’s the competitive landscape and fast-paced nature that I think appeals to an athlete’s DNA,” says Alan.\n\n“Established banks have literally been around for hundreds of years and we are now seeing fintech organisations take market share. It’s an extremely exciting time as rapid innovation is driving banks’ recognition that partnering with fintech is the way forward.”\n\nThere’s a healthy rivalry and more and more collaboration between fintech and banks as the industry strives to make things better for consumers.\n\n“It’s an empowering feeling working in fintech because the ultimate end goal is tangible for all,” says Alan. “Everyone is working to make finance simpler to understand, money easier to manage, payments easier to organise and make\n\ncustomers happy.”\n\nThe opportunity within fintech\n\nAs Palmer expressed so clearly in his interview, the pace of growth of the businesses within the fintech sector opens up a world of possibilities for a fresh starter to try their hand at different things.\n\nThe need for all people within the business to be involved in multiple aspects of the entire operation guarantees a solid grounding in multiple departments and a chance to learn quickly.\n\nBut for Alan, the opportunity expands beyond finding a new department to work in and into a world of personal development – another facet of the sector an athlete should relish.\n\n“The sector is at the cutting edge of technology and innovation and as such, there is always a challenge in finding talent ready to work with it,” says Alan.\n\n“As a result, companies employ attitude over experience, mindset over qualifications. Fintechs aren’t simply digitising analogue experiences, they are completely disrupting the industry in the same way Netflix did to entertainment and Spotify did to music.\n\n“Athletes have a winning at all costs mentality. A drive to succeed through navigating the challenges that come their way. That is so similar to start-up life and fintech businesses.\n\n“I have been so inspired by the athletes I have met and am completely confident in their success in business. People with these attributes will fly through the ranks because they get stuff done and that is what fintech want, need and reward on.”\n\nWhether you’re degree qualified or not, fintech organisations are crying out for people to come in with the right mentality, a willingness to learn and a competitive streak in their character.\n\n“Athletes are the perfect fit and I can’t wait to see more of them make the move into the industry,” says Alan.\n\nCreate connections and build a lifelong career\n\n“With the levels of investment injected into the sector, it’s only natural that high profile leaders come and work within it,” explains Alan. “And with such high calibre leadership coming in to work in relatively small organisations, you get a chance to\n\nwork up close and learn from some of the best.”\n\nRubbing shoulders and forging relationships with these inspirational leaders offers more than just a learning opportunity. It provides a chance to open doors further down the line in your career as well.\n\n“The innovation attracts people from big organisations to startups as they seek to make a big impact,” says Alan. “Being in that environment and building something successful can pretty much fast-track your career and build bonds with highly driven people who will remember you and your work for years to come.”\n\nConsidering many of the leaders and founders of organisations in this space are young and entrepreneurial, forging relationships with them is a great way to nurture your career aspirations and even elevate your goals.\n\nSpeak to our experts today"
