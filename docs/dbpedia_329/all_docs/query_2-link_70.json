This anti-glare, touchscreen display has full HD 1080p resolution and features an edge-to-edge multi-touch system with support for 10-point gestures.\n\nThis Mondopad allows you to brainstorm, capture, save, and share your ideas on an interactive whiteboard. ConX Whiteboard is supported, which enables you and co-workers in other locations to interact and share ideas on a Mondopad whiteboard at the same time. Share content securely from PCs, Macs, tablets, or smartphones to make meetings collaborative, productive, and sustainable. An Intel Core i7 processor with a 256GB SSD and a full version of Microsoft Office are included. A wireless keyboard and mouse are included as well.\n\nInteractive Whiteboard\n\nBrainstorm, capture, save, and share your ideas on an interactive whiteboard without borders or barriers. Use a complete collection of digital pens, shapes, lines, and colors on a canvas up to 100-display screens in size; paste and annotate backgrounds and images, then email directly from the Mondopad.\n\nView, Annotate, and Share\n\nYou can take notes on anything you’re presenting and then save and email your changes. You can mark-up documents, images, web pages, or videos, and manage common or secure files through email, office network, USB drives, and cloud-based services like Dropbox.\n\nBrainstorm and Share Ideas Through the Cloud\n\nThis Mondopad supports ConX Whiteboard. This enables you and co-workers in other locations to interact and share ideas on a Mondopad whiteboard at the same time. By using your Mondopad and your ConX Cloud login credentials you can join a ConX Whiteboard session and start drawing. Everyone will see the same whiteboard screen, and each participant can draw or write in a different color or they can insert text or images. If you’re already on a ConX Cloud video call, hit “join” and the ConX Whiteboard will appear allowing you to see and hear co-workers while sharing and editing your ideas at the same time. ConX Whiteboard works either in conjunction with ConX Cloud, or on its own with any other video.\n\nVideo Connect to the World\n\nThe video calling service is included for the first year, allowing you to make and receive video calls or add your own video conferencing client onto the Mondopad as you would on any other PC. You can bring groups of people together with the ConX Cloud and the users can connect from any device, anywhere. Subscriptions are available ranging from three seats up to 100 virtual meeting rooms, each with 50 seats.\n\nBring Your Own Device\n\nYou can connect and share content securely from PCs, Macs, tablets, or smartphones to make meetings collaborative, productive, and sustainable. By casting your device’s screen to the Mondopad and viewing up to four AirPlay or Chrome casts simultaneously you can control the Mondopad with your device from anywhere in the room.\n\nInFocus Mondopad INF5522AG Specs\n\nDisplay\n\nNative Resolution\n\n1920 x 1080\n\nContrast Ratio\n\n1200:1\n\nResponse Time\n\n9 ms\n\nRefresh Rate\n\n60 Hz\n\nDot Pitch\n\n0.67 x 0.67 mm\n\nSurface\n\nMulti-Touch Points\n\n10\n\nConnectivity\n\nUSB I/O\n\n4x 3.0 / 3.1/3.2 Gen 1\n\n2x USB-B (Unspecified Version)\n\n2x 2.0\n\n3x (Unspecified Version)\n\nEthernet I/O\n\n3RJ45\n\nBuilt-In Speakers\n\nYes, 2x 10 W\n\nHardware\n\nStorage\n\n256 GB 2.5″ SSD\n\nRAM\n\n8 GB\n\nEnvironmental\n\nOperating Temperature\n\n41 to 95°F / 5 to 35°C\n\nElectrical\n\nPower Consumption\n\nTypical: 130.0 W\n\nDimensions\n\n32 x 51 x 4″ / 81.3 x 129.5 x 10.2 cm\n\nWeight\n\n84 lb / 38.1 kg\n\nBuying guide of projector for business\n\n“Digital Notice Board Offer A Multitude Of Benefits”\n\nOnly logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review.\n\nRelated products\n\nBENQ\n\nRated 0 out of 5\n\nRE9801 Smart Interactive Display\n\n₹350,000.00 Original price was: ₹350,000.00.₹159,900.00Current price is: ₹159,900.00.
