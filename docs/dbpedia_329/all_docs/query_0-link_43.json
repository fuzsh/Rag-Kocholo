        "text": "Livesay Maintains Lead In Bassmaster Elite Series Event On Lake Fork\n\nLee Livesay of Longview, Texas, is leading after Day 3 of the 2022 Simms Bassmaster Elite at Lake Fork with a three-day total of 87 pounds, 15 ounces.\n\nPhoto by Seigo Saito/B.A.S.S.\n\nMay 21, 2022\n\nQUITMAN, Texas — Despite a lifetime of fishing Lake Fork and several years of guiding on the East Texas powerhouse, Lee Livesay found something he’d never seen before and that revelation delivered a Day 3 limit of 27 pounds, 5 ounces that kept him atop the Simms Bassmaster Elite at Lake Fork with a three-day weight of 87-15.\n\nLivesay heads into Championship Sunday with a 3 1/2-pound advantage over Idaho superstar Brandon Palaniuk — and he credits much of his success to that new discovery.\n\n“Most of the fish I’ve caught this week have come from a spot I’ve never even caught a bass on,” said Livesay, who won his first St. Croix Bassmaster Open presented by Mossy Oak Fishing at Ross Barnett on April 30. “I found them the first day of practice and thought they were little, but they grew. I got lucky yesterday and got an 8-pounder on another spot where it was just her.”\n\nLivesay knows Fork intimately, but the spot he’s leveraging this week was so unassuming that it had never caught his eye. During practice, another tournament crowded the lake’s diminished waters — the lake level is down 5 1/2 feet for dam repairs — so Livesay searched for less obvious spots.\n\n“I went looking at off-the-wall stuff I’d never looked at,” he said. “When I found them, I thought they were catfish. I came back the second day of practice and caught two under 4 pounds.\n\n“I kind of wrote it off because usually a big one will bite before the little ones. But I went to it (during the tournament) and caught most of my bag there yesterday and all but my biggest one there today.”\n\nLivesay described his spot as a small point reaching into the standing timber with a high spot. That 30-foot by 30-foot section has hard bottom where bass pull up to feed.\n\nWhile the first two days saw Livesay catching fish early and securing all of his weight by late morning, Saturday kept him waiting until 9:15 a.m. for his first keeper. Another difference: Livesay couldn’t find the big afternoon bites the first two days, but he caught an 8-2 Saturday shortly after noon.\n\nThat kicker came off a deep point that was loaded with white bass — a common forage for Lake Fork giants.\n\nLivesay caught all of his bass on a 6th Sense Divine Hybrid Jig with a Netbait Paca Craw.\n\nPalaniuk caught 26-9 on Day 1 to place eighth before adding a second-round limit of 30-1 — his first limit of 30-plus in Bassmaster competition — to rise to second. His Day 3 bag of 27-13 gave the former Bassmaster Angler of the Year a total of 84-7.\n\nWhile many anglers reported flurries of activity, Palaniuk caught one good fish each hour from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. He started with a 5-1 at 7:21, added a 3-9 at 8:44, then a 3-10 (9:01), a 6-6 (10:03), a 5-15 (11:46) and a 6-13 (12:06).\n\n“Yesterday, I had a major flurry; today I just didn’t,” Palaniuk said. “The fish were moving around a lot, they wouldn’t stay in my places and really set up.\n\n“I would have thought that with today’s lighter wind, they would have hunkered down, but with less wind, the bait’s probably moving differently, it’s not pushed up against there and the bass just moved with the bait.”\n\nReturning to the same spots in the lake's lower basin where he fished the previous two days, Palaniuk caught his bass over hard bottom with a variety of Rapala crankbaits and a big spoon.\n\nGerald Swindle of Guntersville, Ala., is in third place with 80-14. After placing third on Day 1 with 29-7, he added 22-5 and slipped to fourth on Day 2. His Day 3 limit of 29-2 helped him move up a notch with 80-14.\n\nSwindle said the key to surging ahead Saturday was switching locations and baits. He spent the majority of his day flipping a Zoom Magnum Trick Worm on a 3/4-ounce shaky head amid trees in the Lake Fork Creek arm. With more than half his day gone, Swindle relocated to a point in 25 feet of water and picked up a deep-diving crankbait.\n\n“I left that area and I had about 26 pounds; I’d done all I could do and I guarded it a while to make sure they didn’t keep biting,” Swindle said. “At noon, I was convinced they were not going to bite the rest of the day, so I went and checked one more point.\n\n“I graphed the point and (the fish) that were there the second day of practice hadn’t been there in the tournament, but I pulled in there today and I’m like, ‘Well, there they are.’ I caught a 6-4 and a 5-6 off of it. I caught two more 4s and a 3 that wouldn’t help me.”\n\nNotably, Swindle had just switched to a lighter-action rod prior to catching his 5-6. That fish was hooked in the top of the head — a common occurrence with treble-hook baits — and the new rod’s flexibility allowed him to finesse it to the boat without popping the hook loose.\n\nChad Pipkens of DeWitt, Mich., still leads for Phoenix Boats Big Bass honors with an 8-11 largemouth.\n\nDay 1 leader Cliff Prince of Palatka, Fla., leads the race for VMC Monster Bag with his 32-5 limit from Day 1.\n\nPalaniuk leads the Progressive Insurance Bassmaster Angler of the Year standings with 442 points. John Cox of DeBary, Fla., is in second with 422, followed by David Mullins of Mt. Carmel, Tenn., with 401, Drew Benton of Blakely, Ga., with 381 and Brandon Lester of Fayetteville, Tenn., with 377.\n\nJay Przekurat of Stevens Point, Wis., leads the Falcon Rods Rookie of the Year standings with 320 points.\n\nThe Top 10 remaining anglers will take off at 7 a.m. CT Sunday from SRA Headquarters — Lake Fork. The weigh-in will be held at the same location at 3:10 p.m., with the winner earning $100,000. Coverage will be available on Bassmaster.com and the FOX Sports digital platforms. FS1 will also broadcast live with the tournament leaders beginning at 7 a.m.\n\n2022 Simms Bassmaster Elite at Lake Fork 5/19-5/22\n\nLake Fork, Quitman TX.\n\n(PROFESSIONAL) Standings Day 3\n\nAngler Hometown No./lbs-oz Pts Total $$$\n\n1.

But after adding 28-10 to his first-round weight of 32 pounds, Livesay heads into Semifinal Saturday leading Brandon Palaniuk of Rathdrum, Idaho, by 4 pounds.\n\nAn active morning saw Livesay catch all of his weight by 10 a.m. Anchoring his bag with a 7-10, he spent the rest of the day searching for one of the mega-schools that he knows hold the caliber of bass that could’ve pushed his total past his Day 1 effort.\n\n“I had a 4-11 and I jumped one good one off that would have helped me a little bit,” Livesay said. “I thought for sure I was going to run into a school that was right to catch a 7-plus-pounder this afternoon, but it just didn’t happen.\n\n“Obviously, I’m happy with leading the tournament. I can’t complain; I’m just a little frustrated not finding a new group yet.”\n\nLivesay said he’s hopeful that a smaller Day 3 field — only the Top 47 competitors — will afford him greater opportunities. With Lake Fork’s water level down about 5 feet for dam repairs, plus big winds rendering a lot of areas unfishable, Livesay struggled to find anything that would cull.\n\n“I’m thinking that losing 45 guys tomorrow is going to let some stuff rest a little bit,” Livesay said. “I haven’t been able to get on anything that was fresh in the afternoon, and the wind has been blowing so hard I haven’t been able to backtrack on my schools.\n\n“It’s going to take a lot of luck, and I think I’m going to need a fresh group or two of fish to keep it going.”\n\nComing off his first St. Croix Bassmaster Open presented by Mossy Oak Fishing win at Ross Barnett on April 30, Livesay started his day fishing a point in 8 to 14 feet. He caught one of his keepers there and then moved deeper to the 12- to 15-foot range.\n\n“One of my deeper fish came on a spot where a timber edge and a fenceline come together; there’s a high, hard spot there with a channel swing,” he said. “The other ones were on a little point with timber.”\n\nLivesay caught his bass on a 6th Sense Crush 300DD crankbait, a 6th Sense Divine Hybrid Jig with a NetBait Paca Craw and a Hog Farmer hair jig. He said the crankbait fish preferred a fast presentation. Also, positioning was key.\n\n“When I’m throwing in that timber, I’m trying to get the best angle to get the fish out of the timber,” he said. “I usually like to stay farther away from them when I’m casting to them, but you have to be able to get them out.”\n\nAfter his offshore searching came up empty, Livesay moved shallow and threw a topwater. He caught a few bass that way, but none upgraded his weight.\n\nPalaniuk, who placed eighth on Day 1 with 26-9, added 30-1 for a 56-10 total. This was Palaniuk’s first 30-pound limit in his Bassmaster career.\n\n“It was awesome — I’ve been trying to do that for years,” Palaniuk said. “I got close this year at Santee Cooper, I’ve been close other times before, so when I caught that last 6-pounder today, I was excited.\n\n“I was stuck at 28 pounds forever with a 4-pounder, and I had lost a 6-pounder earlier in the day and it was just eating at me and eating at me. I finally caught that 6-2 around 1:00.”\n\nPalaniuk attributed his success to investing the time to locate the right groups of fish. Bass school by size, so he referenced his practice search, during which his Humminbird MEGA Imaging allowed him to identify groups of higher-quality fish.\n\nFishing the lake's lower basin, Palaniuk caught his bass over hard bottom with a variety of Rapala crankbaits.\n\nBryan New of Saluda, S.C., is in third place with 52-5. After placing 17th on Day 1 with 23-7, he added 28-14.\n\nRotating through a series of spots — mostly hard bottom on long points — New tried to intercept groups of bass as they moved up to feed. One fortunate encounter yielded a 15-minute flurry that included two fish in the 7-pound class, a 6 and a 5.\n\n“I was just running around and trying to get on a place,” New said. “If you get on a place at the right time, and can get them going, it happens that quick.”\n\nNew caught his fish on a Spro Little John Super DD, a hollow-belly swimbait and a Zoom Magnum Trick Worm on a Greenfish Tackle football head. His two biggest ate the swimbait.\n\nChad Pipkens of DeWitt, Mich., is in the lead for Phoenix Boats Big Bass honors with an 8-11 largemouth.\n\nPrince is currently in the lead for the VMC Monster Bag with his 32-5 limit from Day 1.\n\nPalaniuk leads the Progressive Insurance Bassmaster Angler of the Year standings with 442 points. John Cox of DeBary, Fla., is in second with 438, followed by David Mullins of Mt. Carmel, Tenn., with 415, Drew Benton of Blakely, Ga., with 383 and Brandon Lester of Fayetteville, Tenn., with 374.\n\nJay Przekurat of Stevens Point, Wis., leads the Falcon Rods Rookie of the Year standings with 320 points.\n\nSaturday’s takeoff is scheduled for 7 a.m. CT at SRA Headquarters — Lake Fork. The weigh-in will be held at the same location at 3:10 p.m. Coverage will be available on Bassmaster.com and the FOX Sports digital platforms. FS1 will also broadcast live with the tournament leaders beginning at 7 a.m.\n\n2022 Simms Bassmaster Elite at Lake Fork 5/19-5/22\n\nLake Fork, Quitman TX.\n\n(PROFESSIONAL) Standings Day 2\n\nAngler Hometown No./lbs-oz Pts Total $$$\n\n1.

Essentially, he became more discerning, as he sought quality over quantity.\n\nCrowding throughout the lake, plus a strong Southwest wind blowing 15 to 20 mph, compelled him to remain in the creek where he started and diligently seek its greatest potential.\n\n“Having 25 pounds early allowed me to go find what I found this afternoon,” he said. “I wasn’t in a hurry to go anywhere because I knew the wind was going to wipe out a lot of the stuff. I knew (big fish) live in that creek, and I knew it was the right place to be.\n\n“I fished around in that area and tried to find something else and, late this afternoon, I tried to duplicate (my morning spot) and I ran across two other points that had some fish. On the second one I fished, I caught two 7-pounders. That’s what made the difference.”\n\nPrince was understandably lean on details, but he did note that his morning and afternoon spots shared similar features. A particular type of bottom and specific positioning in the creek were key to his success.\n\nMost of Prince’s bites came in 4 feet of water. Locating fish with his electronics helped him make the targeted casts that hit the right zone.\n\nPrince said he caught a couple of keepers on a Carolina rig, but all of the bass he weighed bit reaction baits. He had two main baits — one with a moderate pace and the other, a faster presentation.\n\n“The bigger fish like the faster bait better,” Prince said.\n\nWith Fork’s water level about 5 feet below normal pool, the lake’s fishable area has shrunk considerably. This definitely worked in Prince’s favor, as he found feeding competition whipping the concentrated fish into a frenzy.\n\n“I used my Garmin Panoptix to see them,” Prince said. “Once you found where they were sitting, you could catch them. If they were there, they’d bite.”\n\nLivesay is in second place with 32 pounds. While he fully expected to do most of his work in the 8- to 14-foot range during the afternoon period, Livesay ended up catching all of his weight around timber in the 18- to 25-foot range.\n\nFishing a 6th Sense Crush 300DD crankbait, a 6th Sense Divine Hybrid jig with a Netbait Paca Craw and a Hawg Caller Magnum Shaky Head with a 10-inch straight tail worm, Livesay anchored his bag with a 7-12. Once he reached 32, Livesay spent the rest of his day trying to find a bigger bite\n\n“I needed a couple of 7-pounders to push my weight higher; I wanted to be closer to 35,” Livesay said. “I got lucky and caught some bigger fish than I thought I would on those mid-depth spots. I just had a good morning.\n\n“After that, I went and looked at a bunch of other stuff, because eventually, I’m going to run out of fish. I left a bunch of fish biting in that mid-depth because I didn’t think I was going to catch the 7- to 8-pounder I needed.”\n\nGerald Swindle of Guntersville, Ala., is in third place with 29-7. Patience and persistence proved essential for the two-time Elite Series Angler of the Year, who struggled to find a fishable spot much of the day.\n\n“I spent a lot of gas trying to get on two spots — those were the only two I could fish,” Swindle said. “At one point, I spent an hour and five minutes running and never stopped and got on a place.\n\n“I ran around a bunch and I knew it was going to be that way because I had a really late boat draw. Some of the spots are so small, even if someone tells you that you can (fish a spot they’re fishing), you can’t make the right cast.”\n\nWhen Swindle finally found a spot he could fish, he caught his weight on crankbaits, jigs and big worms. Targeting a hard spot amid standing timber, he used his Garmin LiveScope in conjunction with Humminbird 360 to locate the right targets and monitor fish positioning.\n\nGary Clouse of Winchester, Tenn., is in the lead for Phoenix Boats Big Bass honors with an 8-10 largemouth.\n\nPrince is currently in the lead for the VMC Monster Bag.\n\nBrandon Palaniuk of Rathdrum, Idaho, leads the Progressive Insurance Bassmaster Angler of the Year standings with 436 points.

Carmel, Tenn., with 416, Drew Benton of Blakely, Ga., with 367 and Clifford Pirch of Payson, Ariz., with 367.\n\nJay Przekurat of Stevens Point, Wis., leads the Falcon Rods Rookie of the Year standings with 323 points.\n\nFriday’s takeoff is scheduled for 7 a.m. CT at SRA Headquarters — Lake Fork.

(May 16, 2022) – Boater Mario “Mark” Riojas of Blanchard, Oklahoma, caught five bass Sunday weighing 13 pounds, 2 ounces, to win the MLF Phoenix Bass Fishing League Presented by T-H Marine on Lake Eufaula presented by Flamingo Fish and Marine . The tournament was the third event of the season for the Bass Fishing League Okie Division and the second event in a two-event Bass Fishing League double-header on Lake Eufaula over the weekend. Riojas earned $4,009 for his victory.\n\n“It’s been brutally tough for Lake Eufaula for this time of year,” said Riojas. “Saturday, when I fished the first BFL of the weekend here, the lake was up and muddy. I ended up with one fish, and my co-angler pulled out two at the very end of the day.\n\n“I stewed over that on Saturday night and decided to go back to the same spot because that’s the only spot I had caught fish,” Riojas added. “I worked a half-mile stretch of bank in the Porum Landing area back and forth all day and pulled out five keeper bites flipping buck brush in about 6 feet of water.”\n\nRiojas said the day’s bites were few and far between and described the tournament as a “grind.” Riojas said his bait of choice for the day was a 4/0 flipping hook with a 5/16-ounce pegged weight and a green pumpkin Zoom Brush Hog.\n\n“I’m pretty excited to win this,” Riojas said. “This was my 81st event that I’ve fished with Major League Fishing, and I’ve never had a win.

(May 16, 2022) – Boater Kelly Readhimer of Beech Bluff, Tennessee, caught five bass Saturday weighing 18 pounds, 1 ounce, to win the MLF Phoenix Bass Fishing League Presented by T-H Marine on Percy Priest Lake presented by Lithium Pros. The tournament was the third event of the season for the Bass Fishing League Music City Division. Readhimer earned $4,235 for his victory.\n\n“I practiced on Friday and caught probably 13 or 14 pounds in one school,” Readhimer said. “I threw a crankbait into it and didn’t get bit, so I spun the boat around and fired up onto the point in 8 to 10 feet of water. I caught three 3-pounders in a row. So I marked those fish.”\n\nReadhimer said he began the tournament Saturday fishing a shad spawn and didn’t catch a bass. He said he returned to the school he found the previous day, but nothing bit the crankbait he threw. He switched to a brown ¾-ounce football mop jig and cast to the point, hopped the jig twice and landed a 4½-pound bass.\n\nReadhimer said he focused on the Hobson Pike Bridge area and targeted a shallow flat that ran from an island to the bank and featured a lot of large rocks. He hopped the jig, caught a couple of keeper bass, and fished the spot until he filled his limit.\n\n“All I was doing was stroking that big mop jig,” Readhimer said. “You couldn’t drag it and get bit. I was stroking it so hard with 30 minutes left in the tournament that my right arm was cramping.”\n\nReadhimer said he had been to Percy Priest only five times and felt fortunate to get the win.\n\n“I don’t have a lot of experience on the lake, but I knew it was fishing tough,” Readhimer said. “Basically, I had two spots and I just milked them for all it was worth. The way I found those fish was just luck.”\n\nThe top 10 boaters finished the tournament in:\n\n1st: Kelly Readhimer, Beech Bluff, Tenn., five bass, 18-1, $4,235\n\n2nd: Billy Hinson, Mount Juliet, Tenn., five bass, 17-5, $2,618 (includes $500 Phoenix MLF Contingency Bonus)\n\n3rd: Josh Tramel, Smithville, Tenn., five bass, 16-14, $1,413\n\n4th: Chris Fondren, Lebanon, Tenn., five bass, 15-14, $988\n\n5th: Zach Youngblood, Smithville, Tenn., five bass, 15-6, $811\n\n5th: Mike Bryant, Cookeville, Tenn., five bass, 15-6, $1,011\n\n7th: Brandon Edel, Hendersonville, Tenn., five bass, 15-1, $706\n\n8th: Bryden Mugleston, Mount Juliet, Tenn., five bass, 14-3, $1,225\n\n9th: Michael Tuck, Old Hickory, Tenn., three bass, 13-2, $565\n\n10th: Dylan Wright, Murfreesboro, Tenn., five bass, 12-8, $494\n\nComplete results can be found at MajorLeagueFishing.com.\n\nMugleston had a largemouth that weighed 6 pounds, 6 ounces that was the heaviest of the event in the Boater Division and earned the day’s Berkley Big Bass Boater award of $590.\n\nBrian Haworth of Cookeville, Tennessee, won the Strike King Co-angler Division and $2,413 Saturday after catching five bass weighing 14 pounds, 11 ounces.\n\nThe top 10 Strike King co-anglers were:\n\n1st: Brian Haworth, Cookeville, Tenn., five bass, 14-11, $2,413\n\n2nd: Harvey Daniels, Portland, Tenn., four bass, 10-9, $1,059\n\n3rd: Robert Moore, Elkmont, Ala., five bass, 10-8, $806\n\n4th: Gary Haraguchi, Murfreesboro, Tenn., four bass, 9-7, $494\n\n5th: Teddy Baggett, Nashville, Tenn., four bass, 9-0, $424\n\n6th: Grant Frazier, Manchester, Tenn., four bass, 7-15, $388\n\n7th: Matt Perkins, Smyrna, Tenn., three bass, 7-11, $353\n\n8th: Keith Whipple, Iuka, Miss., three bass, 7-4, $318\n\n9th: Logan Stewart, Nashville, Tenn., four bass, 7-1, $282\n\n10th: Ricky England, Sparta, Tenn., three bass, 6-9, $247\n\nHaworth caught the largest bass in the Co-angler Division, a fish weighing in at 4 pounds, 8 ounces.

(May 16, 2022) – Boater Logan Anderson of Catawba, North Carolina, caught five bass Saturday weighing 17 pounds, 10 ounces, to win the MLF Phoenix Bass Fishing League Presented by T-H Marine on Kerr Lake . The tournament, hosted by Vance County Tourism, was the third event of the season for the Bass Fishing League North Carolina Division. Anderson earned $7,415, including a $2,500 Phoenix MLF Contingency Bonus, for his victory.\n\n“We had a fog delay and still had a little bit of fog when we took off, so I knew a lot of people would stay in Nutbush and fish,” Anderson said. “I wanted to get as far away from that as I could. But, that’s the place I’m most familiar with, so I started right at the mouth of Nutbush.”\n\nAnderson said he began fishing docks with a Queen Tackle Glimmer Blue Shad Tungsten Swim Jigand immediately caught a 4-pound bass. His co-angler caught one that weighed three pounds, so Anderson said he knew good fish were in the area. After he missed another good fish and then caught another 4-pound fish, Anderson said it was time to relocate.\n\n“After we ran out of stuff there, we took a run up the lake to Ivy Hill,” Anderson said. “I caught some more on the swim jig and then caught a couple on a new Queen Tackle prototype spinnerbait that is coming out. That’s all I did all day – fished docks and laydown trees as the main source of cover.”\n\nAnderson said the swim jig and spinnerbait produced 12 fish during competition – seven of which were keepers.\n\n“Until I put them on the scales I would not have believed I had almost 18 pounds,” Anderson said. “This is my first year fishing BFLs as a boater, and as hard as it is to win one, it’s insane to win in just my third try.”\n\nThe top 10 boaters finished the tournament in:\n\n1st: Logan Anderson, Catawba, N.C., five bass, 17-10, $7,415 (includes $2,500 Phoenix MLF Contingency Bonus)\n\n2nd: Aaron Digh, Denver, N.C., five bass, 16-1, $2,458\n\n3rd: Tyler Trent, Nathalie, Va., five bass, 15-12, $1,640\n\n4th: Scott Hamrick, Denver, N.C., five bass, 15-9, $1,147\n\n5th: Bradley Staley, Pleasant Garden, N.C., five bass, 14-8, $1,558\n\n6th: James Blankenship, Siler City, N.C., five bass, 14-6, $1,301\n\n7th: Jason Barnes, Concord, N.C., five bass, 14-2, $819\n\n8th: Chris Dover, Blacksburg, S.C., five bass, 14-1, $737\n\n9th: Jeffrey Davis, Raleigh, N.C., five bass, 13-12, $655\n\n10th: Jordan Hall, Leasburg, N.C., five bass, 13-10, $573\n\nComplete results can be found at MajorLeagueFishing.com.\n\nTodd Harris of Lexington, N.C., and Staley both had largemouth that weighed 4 pounds, 13 ounces that were the heaviest of the event in the Boater Division.

(May 16, 2022) – Boater Robert Davis of Bethalto, Illinois, caught four bass Saturday weighing 14 pounds, 4 ounces, to win the MLF Phoenix Bass Fishing League Presented by T-H Marine on Lake Shelbyville. The tournament was the season-opener for the Bass Fishing League Illini Division. Davis earned $4,825 for his victory.\n\n“This tournament was a hot grind,” Davis said. “My original plan did not pan out, so I went with Plan B that I had found the week before – fishing spawning and post-spawn fish, and that paid off.\n\n“I was going back and forth between shallow and deep fish,” Davis added. “I was slow-rolling a spinnerbait near the bottom. Everything I was getting was just subtle bites; they weren’t hitting very hard at all. It was just a reaction bite. I could get them fired up for about 10 minutes and then go two hours without another bite, then get them fired back up for about 10 minutes. It was tedious.”\n\nDavis said he fished three different areas up-river on Lake Shelbyville, and his slow-rolling technique focused on water about 20 feet deep and produced four keepers in the livewell.

(May 16, 2022) – Boater Clint Bissonett of Dayton, Ohio, caught five bass Saturday weighing 19 pounds, 14 ounces, to win the MLF Phoenix Bass Fishing League Presented by T-H Marine on Patoka Lake. The tournament was the second event of the season for the Bass Fishing League Hoosier Division. Bissonett earned $4,435 for his victory.\n\n“I had 140 waypoints marking bed fish that were spawning, so I just ran through them and caught the ones I could,” Bissonett said. “Some you could catch on one cast, and some you’d have to work on a while.\n\n“My last fish I had tried for an hour on Thursday to get it to bite and on Friday for an hour to get it to bite during practice,” Bissonett added. “At the end of the day during the tournament I didn’t have any other big ones located that would help me, so I ran back up the river and went back to that fish and caught it within 10 minutes.”\n\nBissonett said he relied on “typical” bed-fish baits – creature baits, tubes and finesse worms – manufactured by Bent Rod Baits to load his limit.\n\n“This feels really good,” Bissonett went on to say. “I had a really good chance to win this same event last year, but I ended up coming in fourth. It just wasn’t my day. It was a day where everything went wrong. Every single day since then I have thought about coming back and winning.

The tournament was the fourth event of the season for the Bass Fishing League Cowboy Division. Ford earned $5,122 for his victory.\n\n“There were other boats at the spot I wanted to start at, but one left, and I was able to move in where I wanted to a little closer,” Ford said. “My co-angler caught a 3-pounder first on a wacky worm. I’m a crankbait fisherman, but tried a jigging spoon, a tail spinner and a drop-shot rig, but I ended up going back to my crankbait.”\n\nFord said the change back to his crankbait paid off, as he hooked his largest fish of the day – an 8-pound largemouth – that boosted his confidence for the rest of the tournament. Ford finished up the day with six keepers on a Strike King Pro Model 8XD and a Strike King Pro Model 5XD crankbait.\n\n“About every hour I would hook into one,” Ford said. “I fished clean and didn’t lose any fish. My first four fish weighed more than 20 pounds.\n\n“The water temp was 85 degrees with an air temperature of 90 degrees,” Ford added. “We were doing everything we could to keep fish alive.”\n\nFord said he called the tournament director to see if he could weigh in early to preserve the fish he had and ended up weighing in by 1 o’clock.\n\n“I really didn’t know what I had at that time,” Ford said. “I didn’t think I had 30 pounds.\n\n“With bass fishing there are a lot of lows,” Ford added. “I zeroed in my last tournament, so to go from zero to win this one, I won’t lie to you, this feels real good. But I’m staying humble. I know I could go out next week and strike out.

During practice leading up to the event teams reported a post spawn pattern that was causing the lake to fish a little tough. Teams were hoping the early morning shad spawn would produce a few big bites. Lay Lake is known for quality spotted and largemouth bass. 225 teams fished for a $10,000 first place price and $37,400 for the remaining 40 places.\n\nThe team of Chris Rutland and Coby Carden are a well-known team on Lay Lake. They drew boat number 100 putting them about middle of the pack at blast off. The team had about 5 spots they wanted to start on. They ran past two of those spots with other competitors on them and stopped at the third spot to begin their day. They caught a limit there in about 30 minutes using a Spro Bronzeye frog in a brim color. Then they decided to move to their second spot while the shad spawn was still going on. They caught two really good ones on the second stop- probably the same ones they found in practice and checked on a few times during the week to make sure they were still there. Coby shared, “the lake is not fishing like it normally does with the shad spawn. It’s fishing really tough; I’m not sure exactly what is going on, but the fish just aren’t really up there.” A big plan for them was “not to get spun out this morning if the shad spawn wasn’t there. We knew if they weren’t there, we would move through some of our other spots and hit enough places during the day. Eventually, we could put ourselves in contention to get some bites.” The team spent the afternoon targeting brim beds using a Big Bite Baits YoMama in the Hematoma color. They culled up to 19.25 pounds and a $10,000 pay day.\n\nThe team of Emmanuel Globetti and CJ Knight drew boat number 225, the last boat to blast off in the field. They didn’t let the low boat draw get to them saying, “your boat number is your boat number. We couldn’t let that affect our day. We had a slow morning only catching two fish in the first hour and a half. When we got to our first spot, there were some teams in the area, but they weren’t exactly where we wanted to fish. We started to just run water and fish and stumbled on a limit fishing that way. About mid-morning we dialed in a better pattern after running place to place getting a better bite until 3 o’clock. We feel like the key for us was the sun coming out and positioning the fish. We caught them on boat docks, lay downs, offshore brush piles and doing a little bit of everything today.” The wind was also key for them today along with the sun. “We used the wind and the sun to position the boat so we could make the cast to not spook the fish.” They weighed in 17.38 pounds and claimed a 2nd place check for $5000\n\nThe Team of Noah Godwin and Cole Godwin finished third with 16.21 pounds. “We started out in a creek where we found a shad spawn. The creek had a shad spawn on one side and brim beds on the other side. In practice the shad spawn seemed to last about 10 minutes first thing in the morning, and when we got there today, we probably just missed it. We hoped to catch some good ones in there, but it just didn’t happen. We caught one about 2-pounds and fished around in that area with a Chatterbait. We caught 20-30 fish but could only cull up to about 8-pounds. We decided to make a move about 1:00, and we caught 2, 4 and 6 pound fish in the last hour of fishing.

(May 14, 2022) – While Lake Guntersville continues to show out for anglers across the board, pro Spencer Shuffield of Hot Springs, Arkansas , finished yet another stellar day, bringing a limit weighing 19 pounds, 6 ounces to the stage Saturday to lead the final 10 anglers and advance to the final day of competition at the B&W Trailer Hitches Stop 4 on Lake Guntersville Presented by A.R.E. in Guntersville, Alabama. Shuffield’s three-day total of 63 pounds, 7 ounces, was a mere 12 ounces over rookie Nick Hatfield of Greeneville, Tennessee, who brought a limit weighing 21-15 to the scales for a three-day total of 62 pounds, 11 ounces, good for second place.\n\nPro Lane Olson of Forest Grove, Oregon, moved from second place to third, with a limit weighing 19 pounds, 1 ounce, for a three-day total of 61-9, while the reigning Tackle Warehouse Pro Circuit Angler of the Year (AOY) Michael Neal of Dayton, Tennessee, finished the day in fourth place, with a limit weighing 19-9, giving him a three-day total of 61-2. REDCREST 2022 Champion “Big Fish” Bobby Lane of Lakeland, Florida, brought a five-bass limit to the stage – the biggest bag of the day, 22 pounds, 9 ounces – for a three-day total of 59-13 to round out the top five.\n\nAfter starting the day in 32nd place, pro Brandon Mosley of Choctaw, Oklahoma, made the biggest move of the day, bringing a limit weighing 20 pounds, 4 ounces to the scale for a three-day total of 54-7 to slide into the tenth and final spot in Sunday’s Championship Round.\n\nThe final 10 anglers are now set, and competition will resume tomorrow on Championship Sunday, where weights are zeroed, and the angler that catches the heaviest five-fish weight will earn the top prize of up to $135,000.\n\n“I caught a limit pretty quick today, then idled around and ended up finding some good stuff later in the day,” Shuffield said. “I had 18 pounds or so and made a cast on a new school I found and caught a 4½-pounder to cull out a 3½-pound spotted bass, so it worked out pretty good.\n\n“The spot where I’ve been catching my big fish all week, I thought I could win off of that spot, but after today I no longer think you can win there. As a matter of fact, I don’t even know if I’m going to try to fish it tomorrow,” Shuffield continued. “The second school I found during practice had the same potential as that main spot, I just haven’t had a chance to fish it because there have been two or three other guys on it all the time.”\n\nShuffield said fish out on the ledges just don’t seem to want to bite when there are multiple guys fishing them, and that rings especially true for the bigger bass.\n\n“Today I was able to pull up on that second spot and there was no one on it,” Shuffield said. “The fish were set up just right and biting nearly every cast I threw at them, and there were even bigger ones following the ones I had hooked up all the way to the boat.”\n\nShuffield has caught all his fish this week on the Duel Hardcore Bullet Crank 7+, and said his last good fish today was caught on a Duel Hardcore Bullet Crank 5+, a new bait that will premiere at ICAST later this year.\n\n“The cool thing about that crankbait is that you typically have to have current on those ledges to make the fish bite it, but the way I’m fishing it is forcing them to bite,” Shuffield said. “I feel like as long as they are bunched up together, current or no current, I can still get them to bite, just because of the way I’m presenting it. It’s completely a reaction deal, they have no choice but to snap at it, and they’ve been eating it really well.\n\n“I’d be netting a 4-pounder on that second spot today and there would be six or seven 5-plus-pounders right there with her,” Shuffield continued. “I’ve left a lot of big ones out there this week, so I’m really looking forward to getting back out there and leaning into them tomorrow.”\n\nThe top 10 pros advancing to the final day of competition Sunday on Lake Guntersville are:\n\n1st: Spencer Shuffield of Hot Springs, Ark., 15 bass, 63-7\n\n2nd: Nick Hatfield of Greeneville, Tenn., 15 bass, 62-11\n\n3rd: Lane Olson of Forest Grove, Ore., 15 bass, 61-9\n\n4th: Michael Neal of Dayton, Tenn., 15 bass, 61-2\n\n5th: Bobby Lane of Lakeland, Fla., 15 bass, 59-13\n\n6th: Nick Lebrun of Bossier City, La., 15 bass, 58-9\n\n7th: Jacob Wall of New Hope, Ala., 15 bass, 56-7\n\n8th: Ron Nelson of Berrien Springs, Mich., 15 bass, 55-12\n\n9th: Josh Butler of Hayden, Ala., 15 bass, 55-9\n\n10th: Brandon Mosley of Choctaw, Okla., 15 bass, 54-7\n\nAnglers finishing 11th through 50th are:\n\n11th: Derrick Snavely of Piney Flats, Tenn., 15 bass, 54-5, $11,000\n\n12th: Blake Hall of Decatur, Ala., 15 bass, 53-12, $11,000\n\n13th: Justin Lucas of Guntersville, Ala., 15 bass, 53-7, $11,000\n\n14th: Rusty Salewske of Alpine, Calif., 15 bass, 53-2, $11,000\n\n15th: Jared McMillan of Clewiston, Fla., 15 bass, 52-6, $11,000\n\n16th: Trevor Fitzgerald of Belleview, Fla., 15 bass, 52-4, $11,000\n\n17th: Kyle Cortiana of Broken Arrow, Okla., 15 bass, 52-4, $11,000\n\n18th: Dylan Hays of Hot Springs, Ark., 15 bass, 51-12, $11,000\n\n19th: Skeet Reese of Auburn, Calif., 15 bass, 51-8, $11,000\n\n20th: Chris Lane of Guntersville, Ala., 15 bass, 51-0, $11,000\n\n21st: Ricky Robinson of Greenback, Tenn., 15 bass, 50-14, $10,500\n\n22nd: John Hunter of Shelbyville, Ky., 15 bass, 50-11, $10,500\n\n23rd: Mickey Beck of Lebanon, Tenn., 15 bass, 49-13, $10,500\n\n24th: Grae Buck of Green Lane, Pa., 15 bass, 49-7, $10,500\n\n25th: Matt Becker of Finleyville, Pa., 15 bass, 49-3, $10,500\n\n26th: Kyle Weisenburger of Columbus Grove, Ohio, 15 bass, 49-2, $10,500\n\n27th: Brian Latimer of Belton, S.C., 15 bass, 49-0, $10,500\n\n28th: Alex Davis of Albertville, Ala., 15 bass, 48-12, $10,500\n\n29th: Larry Nixon of Quitman, Ark., 15 bass, 48-11, $10,500\n\n30th: Cody Pike of Powhatan, Va., 15 bass, 48-10, $10,500\n\n31st: Dakota Ebare of Brookeland, Texas, 15 bass, 48-9, $10,000\n\n32nd: Tyler Stewart of Dubach, La., 15 bass, 48-4, $10,000\n\n33rd: Takayuki Koike of Otsu Shiga, Japan, 15 bass, 48-4, $10,000\n\n34th: Jason Reyes of Huffman, Texas, 14 bass, 48-2, $10,000\n\n35th: Josh Bragg of Fayetteville, Ga., 15 bass, 47-15, $10,000\n\n36th: Steve York of Bronson, Mich., 15 bass, 47-8, $10,000\n\n37th: Casey Scanlon of Eldon, Mo., 15 bass, 47-5, $10,000\n\n38th: Clabion Johns of Social Circle, Ga., 15 bass, 47-2, $10,000\n\n39th: Chad Warren of Sand Springs, Okla., 15 bass, 47-0, $10,000\n\n40th: David Walker of Sevierville, Tenn., 15 bass, 46-0, $10,000\n\n41st: Robert Nakatomi of Sacramento, Calif., 13 bass, 45-8, $10,000\n\n42nd: Ramie Colson, Jr. of Cadiz, Ky., 15 bass, 45-8, $10,000\n\n43rd: Jim Moynagh of Shakopee, Minn., 15 bass, 44-15, $10,000\n\n44th: Tom Monsoor of La Crosse, Wis., 13 bass, 44-13, $10,000\n\n45th: Cal Lane of Guntersville, Ala., 13 bass, 44-9, $10,000\n\n46th: Mike McClelland of Blue Eye, Mo., 15 bass, 44-8, $10,000\n\n47th: Shonn Goodwin of Moore, Okla., 14 bass, 44-4, $10,000\n\n48th: Jeff Bridges of Pilot Point, Texas, 14 bass, 44-2, $10,000\n\n49th: Bill McDonald of Greenwood, Ind., 15 bass, 43-15, $10,000\n\n50th: Keith Carson of DeBary, Fla., 10 bass, 35-3, $10,000\n\nFor a full list of results visit MajorLeagueFishing.com.\n\nOverall, there were 236 bass weighing 739 pounds, 11 ounces caught by 49 pros Saturday.
