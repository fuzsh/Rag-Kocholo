GBC is represented by one of the largest international distribution networks in over 100 countries. Over 40 years after inception, GBC is world renowned in the field elemental analysis field as a result of its quality products and services.\n\nGBC customers benefit from our efficient and effective global organisation. Access to information, applications support and technical service is never more than a phone call or email away.\n\nThe modern AAS instrument was pioneered by Sir Alan Walsh in the 1950s at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). In Melbourne, Australia, whilst gardening one weekend Walsh realized that measuring the absorption of light was more valuable than observing the emission.\n\nGBC Scientific Equipment was founded in 1978 by Ron Grey, Ivan Bartlett and Peter Charlton.\n\nIn this picture, Sir Alan Walsh (second from left) stands with GBC’s Directors from left, Peter Charlton, Clive Davenport and Ron Grey over an early GBC AAS – the 903 and System 1000."
