        "text": "Allan Walsh is a hard-core players’ guy, a union guy.\n\nThe longtime NHL agent typically is described as “controversial” or “outspoken,” and usually both. He’s followed by more than 40,000 people on Twitter, including virtually everyone in the hockey world. And Walsh, co-managing director of Octagon Hockey, regularly defends players, including his roughly 30 clients, while calling out management all the way up to Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\n“Hey Gary, you know what else is ‘terribly disruptive’ to an NHL season … LOCKOUTS! 3 of them on your watch,” Walsh tweeted in November, in response to news that the NHL was considering not allowing players to attend the Olympics, again, in 2022.\n\nSo it may come as a surprise that Walsh is among those who are on the fence about whether NHL players would be better off without a union.\n\nFor years, Walsh was “a traditional unionist,” he said. “Now I see the fact that the players are unionized is being used against them. And in fact … I wonder whether the players would be better off without a union.”\n\nIn an odd twist, Walsh — who seemingly has an opinion on everything — hasn’t decided on which side he leans.\n\nOn the outside, Walsh is a hard-driving, verbally combative force of nature. And he’s got the numbers to prove it. During a career that spans 23 years, Walsh has negotiated $1.4 billion in player contracts, represented 19 first-round NHL draft picks and traveled 5 million miles on airplanes, continually jetting off to games and to recruit players all over the world. His Twitter location even reads “Los Angeles / On an Airplane.”\n\nWhen he’s not in an arena, he’s watching hockey on the four TVs in his office or the four he has at home — from 4-10 p.m. every NHL game day.\n\nBut despite his hard-charging nature, those who know him say he’s extremely sensitive, thoughtful and caring.\n\nJeff Solomon, Los Angeles Kings executive vice president, has known — and negotiated against — Walsh for 15 years. “You can count on him being honest and you can count on him being professional,” Solomon said, “but in a way where I have my hand on my wallet to make sure it’s still in my back pocket, which is a very good thing for an agent.”\n\nWalsh lives in L.A. and the two see each other often, but Solomon noted that Walsh canceled their recent lunch at the last minute because he was flying to Dallas to see a client who was getting called up from the minors.\n\n“So this is a guy who was coming up to play his first NHL game, and he doesn’t treat him any different than he does Marc-André Fleury,” Solomon said.\n\nWalsh has represented Fleury, the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NHL draft, since he was a teenager. Now the star goalie for the Vegas Golden Knights, Fleury says Walsh is like family. “He has very strong opinions, but the biggest quality about him is he really cares about his players,” he said.\n\nFleury said he and Walsh talk roughly three times a week, about all kinds of things. “He played goalie for a while,” Fleury said. “Maybe that is why we connect so well — he has the goalie mindset.”\n\nGrowing up in Montreal, all Walsh wanted to be was a goalie in the NHL. Well, a goalie and a lawyer.\n\nHis idol was Ken Dryden, a goaltender who went on to become a member of Canada’s Parliament. “Ken Dryden was the goalie of the Montreal Canadiens at the time and was the only player in NHL history to be a full-time NHL player and a full-time law student,” Walsh said.\n\nWalsh started goaltending at age 5. “I was a really good goalie in my community, but as I progressed to higher and higher levels, it became very obvious, being vertically challenged at 5-8, that I didn’t have any prospects of playing professional\n\nhockey.”\n\nWalsh went to McGill University in Montreal for undergrad and to Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. After his second year of law school, he got an internship at the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office, which turned into a full-time job.\n\nWalsh, 53, cares deeply about justice. Anyone who reads his Twitter feed can see that. He tweets regularly about injustice, whether it’s being inflicted on hockey players, other athletes or fellow airline travelers.\n\nWalsh became an L.A. prosecutor in 1990 when he was 25, with an office down the hall from Marcia Clark, lead prosecutor of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Walsh prosecuted murder cases himself but specialized in gang violence. Trying a case is like producing a play, Walsh said, in which his ability as a great storyteller came in handy. The prosecutor must decide what witnesses to put on, in what order and they had to be at court at exactly the right time.\n\n“The judge is saying, ‘You’d better be ready with your witnesses at 10 a.m. and not waste one minute of the court’s time.’” Walsh said. “At times that meant jumping in a car with my homicide detectives and going to find the witnesses in the neighborhood for the trial for the next day.”\n\nHe tried 40 murder cases, losing just two, but those aren’t the ones that haunt him. The cases he still thinks about are the ones he won, especially the last one. In that case, Walsh secured two life sentences for the killers of a high school honor student.\n\n“That case almost killed me,” he said. “I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep. I was losing hair. When that case was over, I had a sense of obtaining justice for this horrible act … but I remember thinking, ‘I don’t know how many of these I can go through.’”\n\nNot long after that, he met David Schatia, a Montreal lawyer who’s also a pioneer of the hockey representation business. Schatia was one of about six or seven hockey agents in the 1970s and represented four No. 1 picks during that decade, including hall of famer Denis Potvin. But by the 1990s, his business had fallen off.\n\nWalsh got Schatia’s number from a mutual acquaintance and cold-called him in 1995. They met in Schatia’s Montreal office and hit it off. After talking for three hours, Schatia decided to introduce him to some of his hockey contacts and see if he could recruit players.\n\nOne of those contacts, a commissioner of a minor league in western Canada, gave Schatia a call. “He says, ‘Who is this guy?’” Schatia recalled. “‘He just won’t stop. He’s like a pit bull. He’s really insistent. He wants to go. He wants to meet.’”\n\n“I thought to myself, ‘Maybe we have a winner.’”\n\nSchatia and Walsh decided to go into a 50-50 partnership and founded an agency called CanAm Sports. In 2004, they sold it to Octagon.\n\nOctagon President Phil de Picciotto says Walsh is “a passionate advocate” for his clients and called his outspoken style refreshing. “In an era where many people are reticent to let others know how they really think, you never have to wonder about Allan,” de Picciotto said.\n\nWhen asked why he’s so outspoken, Walsh turns the question around: Why aren’t other agents more outspoken?\n\nWalsh joined Twitter early on — in July 2008. “The first [NHL] lockout in the social media era was 2012-2013,” he pointed out, “and during that lockout I would advocate for the players on Twitter every day.”\n\nThe work stoppage before that, in 2004-05, was the most significant in the sport because the players agreed to a salary cap and an escrow after being locked out an entire season.\n\n“In 2004, if all of the NHL hockey players were represented by agents like Allan Walsh, there would be no salary cap and none of the players would be paying escrow,” said Ian Penny, who’s now general counsel of the MLB Players Association and was a staff counsel at the NHL Players’ Association during the 2004-05 lockout.\n\nThe NHL and the NHLPA will decide in September 2019 whether to opt out of the current collective-bargaining agreement, and the escrow, as well as the Olympics, are just two of the issues on the players’ plate. Decisions on that, let alone on possible decertification, have not been made.\n\n“I think there is a great debate right now about whether unions are worthwhile,” Walsh said. “It’s debatable.”\n\nAs to his future, Walsh is not thinking about retiring any time soon. When that time comes, though, he won’t be one of those people who just fades away.\n\n“When I go out of this business … I want to go out on my terms,” he said. “I’m going to decide when I go out. I am not going to go out because I stopped working as hard as I do and just mail it in and wait for it to happen. That’s not me.”"
