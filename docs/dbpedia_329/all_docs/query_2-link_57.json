        "text": "Normal, everyday engine combustion can cause carbon deposits to build up throughout the fuel system. Those deposits can clog the fuel injectors and impede the flow of fuel. Left unchecked for too long, they can impair engine power, start-up, acceleration and fuel efficiency.\n\nFuel system cleaners’ targets carbon deposits, breaks them up and clears them out of your car’s system, and keeps vital engine parts clean with continued use. This helps optimize performance, minimize emissions and maximize power and fuel economy. Texaco Techron® fuel system cleaners will help deliver the best engine efficiency your car can get.\n\nA new car is just as vulnerable to deposit buildup as an older car. As engine technologies advance, operating temperatures become hotter, fuel pressure increases, tolerances are tighter than ever, and fuel injector holes are becoming much smaller and more numerous. So, deposits can start building up within the first few thousand miles. But here’s the good news: Techron is formulated to work in both older and newer engines.\n\nTechron® is proven effective in a wide range of field tests against the competition. At Texaco, we routinely look at competitors' products on the shelf and compare them against the performance of Techron. Our engineers break them down to their molecular level and analyse their contents. Some competitor products either completely lack or have very little of the key detergents found in Techron. And unlike some competitors, Texaco has test results to back up every performance claim. That explains why engine manufacturers and professional mechanics worldwide use Techron® to solve deposit-related problems.\n\nIf Techron products are used in smaller displacement engines, such as a motorcycle, you should not use the whole bottle. We recommend 30 ml of product for every 4.5 ltr of fuel.\n\nKnocking and pinging is generally caused by improper combustion in your engine, called “auto-ignition.” Increases in engine load, temperature, compression, spark-advance, air-fuel ratio and combustion chamber deposits all contribute to the tendency for an engine to knock. Using higher-octane gasoline reduces an engine's tendency to knock. If excessive combustion chamber deposits are contributing to the knocking problem, you may benefit from adding a bottle of Texaco Techron® Concentrate Plus to your next tank of fuel."
