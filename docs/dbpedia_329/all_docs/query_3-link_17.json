        "text": "(credit: HPS Bike)\n\nLimited to just nine models, The HPS Alan Walsh Art Edition Bike was unveiled in July at Walsh Gallery, Monaco. Priced at €20,000.00, this bike is the perfect collaboration of technical lightweight performance and elegant art. Designed in collaboration with British artist Alan Walsh of the Walsh Gallery on Monaco’s Rue Grimaldi, the bike weighs under 9kg and makes use of the latest in F1 technology.\n\nRenowned for its innovative e-road bikes, HPS builds upon the momentum of bikes such as the HPS Domestique in 2021, the Ares limited edition range in 2022 and powering the revolutionary Lotus 136, to present this elegant and technologically advanced bike. “The goal was to create a visual bike of elegance and beauty with ties to Monaco and motorsport which influence much of my art,” said Alan Walsh, Artist, and owner of Walsh Gallery, Monaco.\n\n(credit: HPS Bike)\n\nWell known for his vibrant, bold and clean style the British artist who is based in Monaco on the Côte d'Azur, Walsh presents a “deep red bold stripe to represent Monaco with small flashes of gold sitting on top of the metallic white to sparkle in the Riviera sunlight adding luxury and sophistication.”\n\nUsing their F1 technology driven HPS WATT ASSIST™ Pro motor system, HPS are pioneering lightweight technology and performance to present the lightest e-road bike in the world as the battery and motor system together weigh only 2.3kg. New to the repertoire, this bike is available in four sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large and features a carbon monocoque frame designed by HPS and manufactured in Italy. Along with creating a beautiful visual masterpiece, Walsh was able to visit the factory in Italy noting that the “craftsmanship that goes into building a bike was very cool. Seeing the project come to life from paper sketch to finished machine was a joy and I was really happy with the result!”\n\nAnother unique aspect of the design is that the external battery (made in Germany) is housed in a standard-looking seat tube mounted bottle cage and is removable. Some of the additional features include\n\n• HPS WATT ASSIST™ Pro motor system\n\n• Campagnolo Wireless Super Record group set\n\n• Campagnolo Shamal Carbon Wheels\n\n• Deda carbon custom painted handlebars and a custom-made carbon saddle in collaboration with FIT.\n\n• Pirelli P ZERO™ tyres\n\n• 193Wh modular battery @ 1.2kg delivering up to; three hours of power on a charge, 220 watts, 14N/m of torque."
