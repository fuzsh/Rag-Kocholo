        "meta_description": "Australia has always had a touch of inferiority complex when dealing on the international stage. In the period between the 1970s and 1990s when state businesses such as water, power and roads dominated state economies and provided massive employment, it was virtually impossible for any Australian innovator to have their product used by state organisations.",

        "text": "The argument put forward by the engineers running those organisations at the time was that the product, device or service was untested, untried and therefore uncertain as far as they were concerned. If you could convince someone reputable from overseas to try it and it worked, well, come back and see us. The result was that many of our best and brightest left and many of our inventions ended up on foreign soil and eventually sold back to us. We are now trying to embrace the home-grown inventive wizards of Oz and are being recognised for this on a global level.\n\nWe need to celebrate innovation and the following list of inventions from 1901 to 2000 makes interesting reading.\n\n1901: Federation Wheat William Farrer released the Federation wheat strain, resistant to fungal rust disease and drought.\n\n1901: Flotation method of ore separation The method for separating ore from rock crushings, using bubbles to float the ore to the surface, was developed by Charles Potter and Guillaume Delprat of NSW.\n\n1905: Thrust bearing Anthony Michell invented the tilt-pad thrust bearing, which reduced friction and increased power transmitted.
