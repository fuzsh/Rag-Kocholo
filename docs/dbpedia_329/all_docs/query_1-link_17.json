        "text": "HPS, the creator of the world’s lightest range of e-bikes, has unveiled its latest model, the Alan Walsh Art edition bike, which has been designed in collaboration with British artist Alan Walsh of the Walsh Gallery on Monaco’s Rue Grimaldi.\n\nWith the 2024 Tour de France fever reaching its zenith, e-bike manufacturer HPS has announced a collaboration with artist Alan Walsh.\n\nHPS, which is based in Monaco like the artist behind the creative design, is renowned for its innovative range of e-road bikes. Following the launch of the HPS Domestique in 2021, the Ares limited edition range in 2022 and the Lotus 136, the company is now adding the Alan Walsh Art edition Bike to its growing collection.\n\nHarry Gibbings, the founder and CEO of HPS, says, “We are delighted to be working with our friend and favourite artist, Alan Walsh. We came up with the idea of collaborating one evening to celebrate the Tour de France’s last stage starting in Monaco, where we both live and work.”\n\n42-year-old Alan Walsh is known for his bold, clean style, which is heavily influenced by the French Riviera and luxury automobiles.\n\n“The goal was to create a visual bike of elegance and beauty with ties to Monaco and motorsport, influencing much of my art,” says the British artist, who has run a gallery in the Principality since 2020. “The deep red bold stripe represents Monaco, with small flashes of gold on top of the metallic white to sparkle in the Riviera sunlight, adding luxury and sophistication.”\n\nThe HPS Alan Walsh Art edition model is available in four sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large, with a retail price starting at €20,000.00.\n\nThe lightweight e-bike will be on display at Walsh’s eponymous gallery on the Rue Grimaldi in Monaco during the Tour de France, which will be passing through the Principality on 21st July.\n\nRead related:\n\nAlan Walsh launches ‘Extraordinary Automotive’ exhibition\n\nMonaco Life is produced by real multi-media journalists writing original content.
