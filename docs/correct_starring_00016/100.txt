Love Actually star Laura Linney has a uniquely positive attitude about her character's predicament in the movie.

Laura plays lovelorn office worker Sarah, who secretly worships her colleague Karl – portrayed by Westworld's very own Rodrigo Santoro.

If you're a fan of the Christmas classic, you'll be familiar with the rest – it doesn't work out for them.

But now, 16 years since the release of Love Actually, Laura has revealed that she doesn't want you to feel sorry for her character.

Appearing on The Graham Norton Show, Laura said: "People feel sorry for me, but they shouldn't. I really believe I got the best kiss in that movie, hands down!"

Adding some context to her enjoyment of the scene, she elaborated: "We were both very broken-hearted when we made that movie. He had just been dumped, I had just been dumped. I remember the day we had to film, we were both slumping to the scene.

"He was like, 'Laura, my heart is broken,' I was like 'So is mine.' I turned to him and said, 'Well, all day long we get to make each other feel better.'"

There you have it, maybe Sarah's storyline wasn't that heartbreaking after all – especially when you think about what happened in the US version of Red Nose Day Actually...

The Graham Norton Show returns this Friday (January 25) on BBC One.
