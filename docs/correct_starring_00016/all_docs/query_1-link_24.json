        "text": "Plenty of people adore the classic 2003 holiday film, Love Actually, but thereâs one particular scene that really helped one of the movieâs stars.\n\nLaura Linney, who played Sarah in the popular film, recently appeared on the British talk show, The Graham Norton Show, to reveal that her kissing scene with costar Rodrigo Santoro, who played her love interest, Karl, was quite memorable for many reasons. âIt was so much bigger than I thought it would ever be,â the 54-year-old said of the Richard Curtis directed film. âAnd I had the best ever kiss in that movie with Rodrigo Santoro.â In one scene, the onscreen pair not only dance at an office party, but take their night behind closed doors. And thatâs exactly what the Ozark actress needed at the time.\n\nâIt was sweet because we were both very broken hearted when we made that movie,â Laura recalled. âWeâd both been dumped, so all day we made each other feel a lot better!â Well thatâs one way to cure the blues. And for those hoping that the pair will become an item in real life, that wonât happen as the actress is married to Marc Schauer, and the Westworld actor, 43, has been seeing Mel Fronckowiak since 2013.\n\nLove Actually continues to reel in more and more viewers every year, as it still remains one of folksâ favorite holiday movies. Other big names in the cast included Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant. Although, Hugh, 58, is still scratching his head at the fact that the film is still obsessed over by tons of fans.\n\nâI donât know why Love Actually is still so popular,â the actor recently told Daily Mail. âEveryone watches it at Christmas, which is niceâ¦ Do I remember anything from filming? I mean, there was the horror of that scene where I had to dance aroundâ¦â\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46lmK6qkWK5qrrNnrBmraOasW64zq%2BcZpmTqcKiuMuyZKSho6h6tbuMnZyapF2strW0jJupnpmbqr1w"
