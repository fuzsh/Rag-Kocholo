        "text": "Red Nose Day Actually, which finally screened in the US last night, featured a new scene starring Sarah (Laura Linney). This post contains spoilers.\n\nSPOILERS below: If you are based in the US and you haven't watched Red Nose Day Actually yet you can watch (and donate) by going to this Facebook page (US only).\n\nOne of the most devastating storylines in the original Love Actually film involved Sarah (Laura Linney)...\n\n...and her doomed crush on Karl (Rodrigo Santoro).\n\nWhich took place while she was caring for her brother Michael (Michael Fitzgerald), who would ring her constantly throughout the day.\n\nIn the original film Sarah got with Karl at the end of the work Christmas party, which made you think they would have a happy ending (like every goddamn film like this ever).\n\nBut she was interrupted by a phone call from Michael.\n\nAnd then she got another phone call from him, which she also answered, and she and Karl stopped making out for good.\n\nAnd the last we saw of them in the entire film was this deeply sad exchange in the office.\n\nAnd you blamed Karl because it wasn't her goddamn fault.\n\nWHY DON'T YOU GIVE A SHIT, KARL? FFS.\n\nIn case you think they got together afterwards, Emma Freud, the script editor for Love Actually, revealed that they didn't in a series of tweets in 2015.\n\nAnyway, last night in the US they screened Red Nose Day Actually, a short follow-up to Love Actually.\n\nA previously unseen story about Sarah is featured in the US version of the new film.\n\nThe new scene starts with Sarah (Laura Linney) typing late at night in an office â€“ some things never change.\n\nAnd a colleague is looking at her like, \"Oh for god's sake, you've worked late every single night for the last 13 years, give yourself a night off for fuck's sake, Sarah.\"\n\nShe then gets a phone call, with the same ringtone as before, which makes you think it is her brother.\n\nBut the person on the other line is not her brother. No. It is in fact PATRICK DEMPSEY, FOR SOME REASON.\n\nAnd she responds with this:\n\nHe jokes to Sarah that every time he rings her she always answers, then he says she is a nice wife and she responds with this:\n\nOH, AND THEY HAVE KIDS NOW.\n\nWe don't find out what happened to her brother (which is a bit frustrating), but at least we know that the most devastating storyline now has a goddamn OK ending.\n\nThe follow-up was filmed to raise money for Red Nose Day. To donate, head to the Red Nose Day website.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, you can watch here (US only).\n\nEvery Little Goddamn Difference Between The UK And US Versions Of \"Red Nose Day Actually\"\n\nbuzzfeed.com\n\nI Was An Extra In \"Red Nose Day Actually\" And It Was So Bizarre\n\nbuzzfeed.com\n\nShare This Article"
