        "text": "Plot twist: There will be two versions of the Love Actually sequel, actually. Though the first 10-minute sequel premiered on Red Nose Day in the U.K. on Friday, Entertainment Weekly has revealed that the version premiering in the U.S. on May 25 on NBC will have one slight twist: it will also feature Laura Linney.\n\n“I’d done something for the last Red Nose Day,” the actress tells EW. “So I’d kept in touch with [Love Actually director] Richard Curtis. And then he sent me an e-mail, explaining this short film reunion. I said yes, obviously. How could I say no? And right away we were figuring out our schedules.”\n\nIn the original 2003 film, Linney plays the kindhearted Sarah, an American working at a graphic design company in London and taking care of her mentally ill brother. She also falls in love with her boss, Michael (played by Rodrigo Santoro).\n\nThe actress will film her sequel scene in April but tells EW she has “no idea what I’m doing yet. Not a clue.”\n\nWe shan’t spoil what happens in the Love Actually sequel, but there were many tidbits from it that took the Internet by storm—like a clip of the once and future prime minister (Hugh Grant) dancing to Drake’s Hotline Bling, and a surprise cameo from supermodel Kate Moss.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe short manages to answer everyone‘s questions about everything that happened to the beloved characters. Did Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Mark (Andrew Lincoln) ever get together? Did the rebellious Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) find inner peace? Is Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) still wrapping gifts with absurd pomp and circumstance? We hope so—though U.K. fans and web-savvy Americans already know. Soon we’ll learn the romantic fates of Sarah and Michael, too.\n\nLOVE ACTUALLY\n\nThe Love Actually Sequel Is Here, With a Special Supermodel Cameo\n\nThe 10-minute sequel premiered as a Red Nose Day special in the U.K.\n\ndrama, actually\n\nLove Actually Cast Invites You to Guess Who Aged the Best in Sequel Teaser\n\nThe cast got together for a cue-card-style trailer for its upcoming Red Nose Day reunion.\n\nCHRISTMAS IS ALL AROUND\n\nLove Actually Stars Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, and More Offer Clues About the Sequel\n\nThe short premieres March 24 in the U.K. and May 25 in the U.S.\n\nTech\n\n“It Was Astonishing”: How NBC Convinced Al Michaels to Embrace His AI Voice for Olympics Coverage\n\nThe network will use an artificial clone of the legendary broadcaster’s voice to narrate its daily recaps of the summer event. “It was not only close,” he says of the technology, “it was almost 2% off perfect.”\n\nHollywood\n\n22 Undersung TV Gems to Binge Right This Second\n\nNow that Peak TV has peaked, consider watching one of these unjustly uncelebrated series, handpicked by Maureen Ryan.\n\nPolitics\n\n“Don’t F-cking Leave”: How Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists Trap Their Followers in the Movement Forever\n\nIn an excerpt of her new book Black Pill, CNN correspondent Elle Reeve wades through the organizational muck of the far right—which consists of the “suits” and “boots”—and reveals the personal pitfalls of being famous among all the worst people.\n\nCelebrity\n\nMethod Man Talks Wu-Tang Clan, Working With ODB’s Son, and the “Uncomfortable Subject” of Martin Shkreli’s Auctioned Album\n\nThe Wu-Tang Clan member goes deep on the history of Shaolin with Vanity Fair.\n\nStyle\n\nKendrick Won the Battle Against Drake, but the Proxy War for Hip-Hop’s Soul Isn’t Over\n\nIt’s unsurprising that women are at the center of this war of words, but this is also a rare instance of girls and women being defended by mainstream male rappers.\n\nMovies\n\nRosemary’s Baby Prequel Apartment 7A Aims to Raise Hell: A First Look\n\nJulia Garner and Dianne Wiest star in this follow-up to the 1968 thriller, centering a side character’s nightmarish untold story.\n\nBusiness\n\nHow Art Mogul Louise Blouin Lost Her Fabled Hamptons Estate\n\nLouise Blouin lost La Dune, the Hamptons estate where she once entertained Prince Andrew and Calvin Klein, but she’s not letting go quietly."
