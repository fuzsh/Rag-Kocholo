        "text": "FADE IN:\n\nINT. HEATHROW AIRPORT\n\nA montage of LOVING PEOPLE greeting each other LOVINGLY at the airport plays under a monologue about LOVE.\n\nHUGH GRANT (V.O.)\n\nHi folks, Richard Curtis here. Yes I know, Iâm using my favourite mouthpiece Hugh Grant to say this, but make no mistake this diatribe is just straight-up Richard Curtis talking to you directly. Finally I donât have to be filtered through an actual professional director who knows what theyâre doing. IâM in charge this time, so Iâm seizing this opportunity with both hands to deliver my MANIFESTO.\n\n(cracks knuckles)\n\nSo here it is. You know how in my breakout success they had that cheesy cover of âLove Is All Aroundâ? Well to me thatâs not just a generic sentimental song hook, thatâs my whole worldview in its entirety. I think that love is EVERYWHERE and in EVERYTHING and that EVERY HUMAN ENDEAVOUR IN HISTORY has been motivated by LOVE LOVE LOVELY LOVE, that love ACTUALLY IS ALL AROUND. In fact I honest-to-God originally named this movie âLove Actually Is All Aroundâ, but the studio shortened it to just âLove Actuallyâ because they apparently figured it was better for a title to be incomprehensible than gag-inducingly saccharine.\n\n(exhales)\n\nSo yeah, I think youâve been fairly warned. If youâre allergic to schmaltz, get out while you still can.\n\nINT. 10 DOWNING STREET - FIRST SUBPLOT\n\nWe meet HUGH GRANT, who is now a CHARACTER and not RICHARD CURTIS. But at the same time is still basically RICHARD CURTIS.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nThatâs right, itâs the usual: the shy, awkward, stammering nice guy.\n\n(pause)\n\n...And the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Sure, that makes sense. Not like British parliament is a nest of vipers and the top job has been filled exclusively by ruthless assholes for centuries or anything.\n\nHe meets his new STAFF, including tea lady MARTINE McCUTCHEON. This triggers the UNBEARABLY TWEE CLARINET STING which tells us that LOVE IS HAPPENING. This piece of music is going to be used in this movie ONE THOUSAND TIMES.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nAttractive lady incoming! Activate the Richard Curtis version of charm!\n\n(deer-in-headlights look)\n\nUh, gosh, er, h-hello... sorry, er...\n\nMARTINE MCCUTCHEON\n\nHoly crap, youâre wimpy for a world leader. Oh, shit, shouldnât have said âcrapâ to the PM. And I definitely shouldnât have said âshitâ, for fuckâs sake! OH COCKSUCKING ARSE.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nOh my. Weâve got some salty dialogue for whatâs essentially an overcast Hallmark movie.\n\nMARTINE MCCUTCHEON\n\nYou also get to see some bare tits later on! Thatâs just how movies are in the United Motherfucking Kingdom!\n\nINT. CHURCH - SECOND SUBPLOT\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY and CHIWETEL EJIOFOR have just gotten married. Suddenly about half the guests start playing âAll You Need Is Loveâ.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nSurprise, this was set up by me, the best man! I found out which of your wedding guests were professional-level musicians, contacted them on the sly, wrote them an arrangement of this song for strings, brass, woodwind, and electric guitar, hired a choir and a solo vocalist, got them to rehearse for a week, made sure everybody all sat together according to instrument section, then managed to sneak allll this shit in without either of you noticing anything!\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\nAw, what a sweet, and probably fantastically difficult and expensive, gesture to celebrate our getting married! And here I was worried you didnât even like me.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\n(cold glower)\n\nDo not insult me by speaking to me, woman.\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\nOkay, getting some mixed messages here.\n\nCHIWETEL EJIOFOR\n\nSo wait, what has this got to do with the whole prime minister storyline?\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nOh well see, one of the random guests at this wedding is an employee of the husband of Hughâs sister.\n\nCHIWETEL EJIOFOR\n\nAh, so itâs part of that whole fad for movies like Magnolia and Amores Perros where there are like ten plots happening at once and they only barely have anything to do with one another.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nExactly, except the theme isnât the usual bleak despair, but instead the whole lovey-dovey cotton candy nauseating optimism thing weâve got going on.\n\nINT. CRAPPY FLAT - THIRD SUBPLOT\n\nGinger dork KRIS MARSHALL comes rushing out to his roommate ABDUL SILAS.\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nIâve got it! Abdul, you know how I get routinely rejected by every single woman I ever speak to?\n\nABDUL SILAS\n\nYou mean because you look perpetually hungover and your face is about eighty percent teeth?\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nRight, but I figured out how to negate all that! I just have to go to America! My nasal headcold of an accent will instantly make me irresistible to American women, who are all sexually permissive supermodels! AMERICA!\n\nABDUL SILAS\n\nGeez. After The Tall Guy starred an American, the love interests in Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill were American, and even the Mr. Bean movie was set in America, I wasnât sure if Richard Curtis was just trying for wider box office appeal or had an actual fetish going on. Iâm thinking we have our answer now. Ew.\n\nEXT. PARK BENCH - FOURTH SUBPLOT\n\nLIAM NEESON is hanging out with THOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER, who already has all of his LACONIC CHARM, and is trying very hard to figure out the whole HOW TO ACT thing.\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nSo Iâm your stepfather, and your sole legal guardian now that your mother has passed away. Huh, thatâs actually an interesting relationship! This movie might have a couple of complex things to say about love after all.\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nSure sure, except that weâre only gonna focus on that for about a scene and a half before we pretty much hurl it entirely out the window in favour of me having a crush on some girl Iâve never even spoken to.\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\n(sighs)\n\nOf course.\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nAn American girl.\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nOooof course.\n\nINT. RADIO STATION - FIFTH SUBPLOT\n\nBILL NIGHY is being interviewed on the RADIO.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nIâm here with ageing rock star Bill Nighy, whoâs come to promote his new single and effortlessly steal the whole movie.\n\nBILL NIGHY\n\nThatâs right, Iâm currently trying to get the number one single for Christmas, which is apparently a whole thing in the UK, with a Christmas song that demonstrates conclusively that I, Bill Nighy, should never attempt to sing ever again.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nOh so this movie is set at Christmas, is it? I suppose that does add a bunch of bonus feelgood energy that we donât have to work for.\n\nBILL NIGHY\n\nThat, plus it allows us to cover for some of the more bizarre character behaviour in the movie. If ever we need somebody to do something weird or dumb or contrived, they can justify it by saying âBecause itâs Christmas. And at Christmas youâre supposed to be brave/tell the truth/some other rule we made upâ.\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nWow, what an all-purpose convenience!\n\n(puts cat on head)\n\nBecause itâs Christmas. And at Christmas youâre supposed to wear housepets as hats. Ha ha, this is fun!\n\nINT. MOVIE SHOOT - SIXTH SUBPLOT\n\nMARTIN FREEMAN and JOANNA PAGE are naked on a MOVIE SET.\n\nJOANNA PAGE\n\nWeâre professional naked body doubles!\n\nMARTIN FREEMAN\n\nYes, including me. Martin Freeman. I take my clothes off and show off my naked body for a living. Martin Freeman, who has the physique of a tube of toothpaste. Weâre claiming I doubled for Brad Pitt once. I whose torso bears an uncanny resemblance to an unbaked baguette.\n\nJOANNA PAGE\n\nAnyway, here is our one joke: weâre going to be extremely shy and British in our burgeoning romance, despite the fact that weâre constantly grinding our naked bodies against each other and shoving our genitals in each otherâs faces and whatnot.\n\nMARTIN FREEMAN\n\nThat is our one joke! Enjoy!\n\nINT. OFFICE - SEVENTH AND EIGHTH SUBPLOTS\n\nLAURA LINNEY (who is AMERICAN) is called into a meeting with her boss ALAN RICKMAN.\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nI wanted to touch base vis-a-vis your secret crush on coworker Rodrigo Santoro.\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nEr, this doesnât seem like a very appropriate or professional topic for you to bring up...\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nAnyway, I just thought youâd like to know that what you thought was just a private thing in your own head has actually been common knowledge for years, everybody has always known including Rodrigo, itâs all very humiliating for you really, now I order you to go and tap that.\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nThis is the most uncomfortable conversation of my entire life.\n\nAfter she leaves his office, HEIKE MAKATSCH enters to kick off the next subplot.\n\nHEIKE MAKATSCH\n\nHi, itâs me, your young and sexy assistant. I just thought that Iâd start spontaneously and aggressively trying to seduce you. Without you initiating or encouraging anything, I will make repeated, unambiguous sexual overtures, determined to wear you down despite your noblest intentions.\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nOh, is THAT how middle-aged men wind up cheating on their wives with their secretaries? They get relentlessly harangued into it more or less against their will, is that how weâre portraying this?\n\nHEIKE MAKATSCH\n\n(shrugs)\n\nMaybe they do if theyâre Alan Fucking Rickman.\n\nINT. FRENCH COTTAGE - NINTH SUBPLOT\n\nCOLIN FIRTH arrives at his HOLIDAY HOUSE, where he meets housekeeper LÃCIA MONIZ.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nI just broke up with my wife after she had an affair with my brother. That has no bearing whatsoever on this storyline and pretty much never comes up again, I donât even know why it was a thing in the first place.\n\nLÃCIA MONIZ\n\n(in Portuguese)\n\nWe donât speak the same language as each other. This affords us essentially one comedic opportunity, which is that one of us will say a thing, then the other will coincidentally say the same thing. We do that a LOT.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nThereâs a language barrier keeping us from communicating with each other. This forms the basis of a single repeated joke, which is that one of us will have a line, then the other will happen to have the same line. This happens CONSTANTLY.\n\nLÃCIA MONIZ\n\n(in Portuguese)\n\nAlternately, sometimes the repeated line will have one key humorous difference in it!\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nMeanwhile, sometimes the second version of the line will be altered in an amusing fashion, purple monkey dishwasher!\n\nLÃCIA MONIZ\n\n(in Portuguese)\n\nTHAT IS OUR ONE JOKE! ENJOY!\n\nINT. 10 DOWNING STREET\n\nHUGH is getting ready to do POLITICS.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nSo as the new PM, I should start meeting other world leaders and going over foreign policy with them. Maybe today I could meet with the president of Russia or the prime minister of Japan or-\n\nMARTINE MCCUTCHEON\n\nDo you remember whose movie youâre in?\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nPresident of the United States it is, then! All right, letâs go meet Bill-\n\n(coughs)\n\n-nton. Sorry, frog in my throat! As I was saying, itâs time for me to meet that superficially charming yet unmistakably slimy and probably corrupt horndog southerner, President Bill\n\n(coughs again)\n\n-nton!\n\nHe meets with US PRESIDENT BILLY BOB THORNTON.\n\nBILLY BOB THORNTON\n\nAll right, letâs hash out the agreement between our two great nations. With the previous administration the arrangement was that we got to take whatever we want and generally fuck you guys in the ass. So I figure, if it ainât broke?\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nEr, well, I suppose, sure.\n\nBILLY BOB THORNTON\n\nExcellent! The first thing I think Iâll take is... MARTINE!\n\n(molests Martine)\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nWHY YOU - OOOHH!!!\n\n(goes out to press)\n\nHEY EVERYBODY I JUST DECIDED THAT AMERICA IS DUMB AND THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS A BIG POOPYHEAD AND WHO NEEDS THAT STUPID GLOBAL SUPERPOWER ANYWAY SO THERE.\n\nTHE PRESS\n\nWow, weâre so impressed that youâre actually standing up to America! Here we thought you were a wimp, but it turns out youâve got the balls to fight for our nation after all!\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nEr, yes. Thatâs totally what I was doing. Definitely wasnât causing an international incident because I was sore that a guy was putting the moves on a girl I like, thatâs for sure. Nope, Iâm a hero.\n\nTHE PRESS\n\nYou sure are! After all, publicly humiliating the President of the United States can only have positive repercussions for us!\n\nAfter this, HUGH goes and asks a FLUNKY to transfer MARTINE somewhere where she canât be a source of DRAMA.\n\nFLUNKY\n\nYou got it. Although you are aware that being essentially booted without explanation right at this point of time could make her think youâre punishing her for being sexually assaulted.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nIt could, and in fact it does! But somehow that doesnât negatively impact her feelings towards me, so itâs not a problem.\n\nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE\n\nALAN is out shopping with his wife EMMA THOMPSON when he spots a NECKLACE.\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nHey, that might help me get me laid with Heike! I should come back here later when Iâm not with my wife.\n\n(catches Stupid Disease)\n\nOR I SHOULD PURCHASE IT NOW WHILE SHEâS STEPPED AWAY FROM ME FOR LITERALLY SECONDS SURE OKAY\n\nROWAN ATKINSON\n\n(yâknow, because Curtis had to squeeze him in somewhere)\n\nShould I giftwrap it?\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nOf course not, I donât have time for that, I can do it myself later.\n\n(symptoms get worse)\n\nWHY YES GO AHEAD\n\nROWAN ATKINSON\n\nVery well! And somehow when this process takes more than forty seconds, the joke is going to be that IâM the unreasonable one.\n\nINT. ANDREWâS HOUSE\n\nKEIRA suddenly pops in at ANDREWâS PLACE.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nThe she-beast! Why dost thou darken my doorstep?\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\nAs I said on the phone earlier, all existing footage of the wedding self-destructed like a Mission: Impossible briefing. I noticed at the wedding that every time I turned around you had a camera pointed right at me, so can I see what you have?\n\n(grabs video)\n\nWhy here it is! Iâll just sit down and watch it right now despite your protests, ta!\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nAh shit, she called me about this days ago. Iâve had plenty of time to send her an edited highlight reel so she wouldnât see the whole incriminating thing, or destroy the tape, or even just hide it in a drawer. I suck.\n\nKEIRA watches the TAPE only to find that it consists entirely of OBSESSIVE CLOSEUPS OF HER FACE.\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\n...Okay well THAT was the creepiest thing Iâve ever seen.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nIn my defense... uuhhhmm... nope, nothing I can say right now to salvage this situation.\n\n(dives out window)\n\nINT. LIAM AND THOMASâS HOUSE\n\nTHOMAS bursts in, in a panic.\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nDisaster! That vague offscreen girl I like is going to be moving back to America on Christmas Eve!\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nWho the hell moves on Christmas Eve?\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nPeople who need the timing of movie climaxes to line up. How do I win her before she leaves?\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nYou could try introducing yourself, that might be a start. Or you could be the slightest bit realistic and realise that long-distance relationships are hard enough for grown-ass adults with attention spans, so what youâre proposing is completely hopeless.\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nOh, I know! Sheâll be singing in front of the school on Christmas Eve! Like an hour before sheâs due to move out of the country, which is completely plausible! I should learn to play the drums so I can be part of the band.\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nKid, weâve already passed the âtwo weeks until Christmasâ title card. If we assume they need at least a week of rehearsals, that means youâll have to learn the drums well enough to win the audition inâ¦ what, two days?\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nI think what weâre discovering is that this movie doesnât know how calendars work.\n\nINT. FRENCH COTTAGE\n\nCOLIN and LÃCIA are now IN LOVE.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nYes, I love you, even though weâve still never had a conversation where actual information was communicated! I donât know your likes and dislikes, anything about your family, a single anecdote from your entire life, or whether youâre nice, or smart, or funny, or anything at all. Yet I love you, for whatever definition of love I could possibly be satisfying!\n\nLÃCIA MONIZ\n\n(in Portuguese)\n\nMe too! You could literally have just told me that you think the Ku Klux Klan gets a bad rap as far as I know, but you have a nice face and make lots of lovey-dovey eye contact, and thatâs good enough for me!\n\nEventually the holiday ENDS and they go back to their respective HOME COUNTRIES.\n\nINT. OFFICE\n\nLAURA is working late when her crush RODRIGO SANTORO comes to HIT ON HER.\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nSo, wait, itâs been established that youâve known about my crush for literally years, but only now, right after Alanâs little heart-to-heart, are you doing anything about it? I can only assume he had an equally unprofessional conversation with you too, then.\n\nRODRIGO SANTORO\n\nYeah, it was horrible, the manâs an HR nightmare. But I do agree with him that we should bang, so shall we?\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nDonât mind if I do!\n\nThey go on a DATE, then go back to LAURAâS PLACE. But right when theyâre halfway through TEARING THEIR CLOTHES OFF, the PHONE RINGS and LAURA HURRIEDLY ANSWERS IT.\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nWhy hello, my brother who has acute paranoid schizophrenia! Yes, I DO think Jon Bon Jovi would be good at performing exorcisms. Yes, that IS an actual thing we discuss in this phone call in the actual movie. Yes, I DO think that Richard Curtis has a very loose understanding of how mental illness works. Okay, bye now!\n\n(hangs up)\n\nSorry about that. Even though heâs in an institution where he has access to round-the-clock psychiatric care, I never dare miss one of his random out-of-the-blue gibberish phone calls. I will, at all times, derail absolutely anything thatâs going on in my own life to make sure he can unload his meaningless bullshit on me.\n\nRODRIGO SANTORO\n\nThat sounds really unhealthy for both of you. Can you even have a romantica relationship under those circumstances?\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nActually no. I give up, presumably forever, on finding a life partner.\n\n(pause)\n\nâ¦Huh, thatâs really depressing actually. How are they gonna find a resolution to this plotline that fits in with the rest of the sunny cheesefest that is this movie?\n\n(written out of remainder of movie)\n\nWell. Thatâs one way to go.\n\nINT. WISCONSIN AIRPORT\n\nKRIS arrives in AMERICA.\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nAnd so begins my stupid half-baked plan! It will undoubtedly be quite amusing to see what an utter fool Iâm about to make of myself.\n\n(approaches three beautiful women)\n\nHi, Iâm-\n\nELISHA CUTHBERT\n\nOH MY GOD YOUâRE SO HOT AND HANDSOME YOU REJECTED WEASLEY SIBLING YOU!!\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nOkayâ¦ Iâm Kris, and-\n\nJANUARY JONES\n\nHOLY FUCK WHAT A STUD, I LUST AFTER YOUR MISSHAPEN SCARECROW BODY!!\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nâ¦â¦Woozle wuzzle?\n\nIVANA MILICEVIC\n\nYOU ARE SEX INCARNATE, I WANT TO HAVE YOUR GOOFY-ASS BUG-EYED BABIES!!\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nAll right, all right, I think I see where this is going. Clearly Iâm going to fall for this, follow you back to your place expecting to have the orgy of my wildest fantasies, only to be robbed or otherwise humiliated, right?\n\nHe follows them back to their place, then has THE ORGY OF HIS WILDEST FANTASIES.\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nOh! Never mind then, I guess Curtis just wanted to jam a little Penthouse letter into this thing.\n\nINT. RICKMAN RESIDENCE\n\nIt is CHRISTMAS EVE. EMMA is allowed to open one of her PRESENTS.\n\nEMMA THOMPSON\n\nOoh, ooh, I choose this one! Itâs clearly the pretty necklace I found in Alanâs coat pocket the other day!\n\n(opens present)\n\nGasp! Itâs just a CD the exact size and shape of the necklace box! Itâs a classic sitcom-style coincidental misunderstanding, except used for tragedy!\n\nShe corners ALAN where the KIDS canât hear.\n\nEMMA THOMPSON\n\nYou jerk! Iâm not even gonna ask whether you just gave the necklace to Heike, or cashed it in for the implied blowjob-\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nOh, phew! Because letâs face it, it was probably the latter.\n\nEMMA THOMPSON\n\nThe point is, you betrayed my trust! Iâll carry on for the kidsâ sake, but our marriage is permanently worse now; youâve broken something that canât ever be fixed, and I can never love you the same way again.\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nOkay, how the fuck does THIS fit in with Curtisâs Love Manifesto? How come characters like me and Emma and Laura get screwed, while Kris gets to nail the entire population of Fantasyland, Wisconsin? This is bullshit!\n\nINT. GREGOR FISHERâS FLAT\n\nBILL shows up at the door of his manager, GREGOR FISHER.\n\nBILL NIGHY\n\nWell, I did it! By promising to humiliate myself and outright begging people to take pity on my washed-up old ass, I got my terrible song to be the number one song for Christmas. But while I could be celebrating with celebrities and attractive people, I choose to spend time with you, my oldest and closest friend. Itâs all very heartfelt and genuine and honestly thereâs not much to make fun of here.\n\nGREGOR FISHER\n\nNo, aside from a single kinda-cringey gay joke this is the best scene in the movie and doesnât lend itself to jokes. Wanna just skip to the next scene? Itâs a fucking goldmine.\n\nBILL NIGHY\n\nOh, itâs THAT one, isnât it? Brilliant!\n\n(grabs popcorn)\n\nEXT. KEIRA AND CHIWETELâS DOORWAY.\n\nANDREW shows up at KEIRA and CHIWETELâS PLACE. CHIWETEL answers the door.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nOh! Erâ¦\n\nCHIWETEL EJIOFOR\n\nWell this is a surprise. What are the boombox and the giant placards for?\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nNOTHING NEVER MIND I HAVE TO GO.\n\n(leaves)\n\nOkay, obviously that didnât happen, but you have to admit, there was a fifty-fifty chance that it could have. No, in actuality KEIRA answers the door, and ANDREW presses play on a BOOMBOX and holds up the first of a big stack of PLACARDS.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\n(on placard)\n\nSAY ITâS CAROLLERS\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\nWhat are you doing? Youâre freaking me out, fuck off.\n\n(closes door)\n\nI know, I know, that didnât happen either, but really the chances were even better than fifty-fifty on that. Anyway:\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\nItâs carol singers!\n\nCHIWETEL EJIOFOR\n\nReally? Because it sounds like a solo vocalist accompanied by a piano.\n\nKEIRA KNIGHTLEY\n\nOkay then itâs a single carol singer with a piano, now let me stand here for several minutes listening to this Christmas carol completely by myself okay?\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\n(on placard)\n\nSooo yeah\n\n(flips card)\n\nI guess we have a bit of an elephant in the room\n\n(flips card)\n\nWe should probably just discuss this like rational adults\n\n(flips card)\n\nBut as weâve seen clearly that is not my forte\n\n(flips card)\n\nAnd something like a text or a letter or an email can go astray\n\n(flips card)\n\nSo Iâve cobbled together this ramshackle solution\n\n(flips card)\n\nIn order to acknowledge that yes I have developed an inconvenient and kinda obsessive crush on you\n\n(flips card)\n\nBut itâs fine\n\n(flips card)\n\nIâll get over it\n\n(flips card)\n\nAll I want to do is clear the air then never speak of this again and just be friends\n\n(flips card)\n\nGiven the story so far this moment is actually kinda poignant and sweet\n\n(flips card)\n\nBut letâs not kid ourselves\n\n(flips card)\n\nThis is still at heart a FUCKING WEIRD thing to do\n\n(flips card)\n\nSeriously who does something like this\n\n(flips card)\n\nPeople who see this scene without having watched the whole movie will find it SO CREEPY\n\n(flips card)\n\nOr even people who remember the scene later on without remembering all the context\n\n(flips card)\n\nThere are going to be entire novels worth of discourse about how toxic this entire subplot is\n\n(flips card)\n\nSo just a heads up on that\n\nShe gives him a CONSOLATION KISS, he DEPARTS, and probably things are a little bit weird between them for the rest of their lives.\n\nINT. PORTUGUESE RESTAURANT\n\nCOLIN shows up at the restaurant where LÃCIA works.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\n(in âPortugueseâ)\n\nHello to LÃºcia! I am learn tiny part of Portuguese so can relationship actually be.\n\nLÃCIA MONIZ\n\n(in âEnglishâ)\n\nI have also same idea! We really do think same way in all thing all time, huh? Kinds of weird if you think! So shall we now to have date? Or even just conversation for first time?\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\n(in âPortugueseâ)\n\nNo! Am proposal you marriage! Skip all steps, straight to marriage go, like fucking Disney character!\n\nLÃCIA MONIZ\n\n(in âEnglishâ)\n\nIs wonderful idea! Especially as your first marriage only end six weeks ago! Probably not even divorced yet! I marriage you yes!\n\nEverybody CHEERS, even the people who were established as having NO IDEA WHATâS GOING ON.\n\nINT. 10 DOWNING STREET\n\nHUGH is pouting.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nSigh, I wish I could have made it work with Martine. Perhaps thereâs still some organic, believable, character-driven way we can be together. One that doesnât rely on shameless contrivance and coincidence. Oh well, time to read some random Christmas cards grabbed from all the ones sent to me by anybody in the entire kingdomâ¦\n\n(opens card)\n\nâDear sir, just so you know I totally wanted to bone you the entire time and still do, love Martine.â\n\n(pause)\n\nIâll take it! All the extremely real and serious reasons for not pursuing her romantically have magically disappeared!\n\n(jumps into government vehicle)\n\nWe must find Martine McCutcheon! Unfortunately I only know her street, not her exact address.\n\nDRIVER\n\nYouâre the national leader and sheâs a former employee. I think you can find out her address.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nYouâre right. By KNOCKING ON EVERY SINGLE DOOR IN HER STREET ONE AT A TIME!\n\nHe DOES THIS. Eventually he finds the right house.\n\nMARTINE MCCUTCHEON\n\nBut rats, I was heading out to a school nativity play. I canât miss that for something as petty as the prime minister bursting into my house and declaring his love for me.\n\nSo he ACCOMPANIES HER to the SCHOOL PLAY. They start MAKING OUT BEHIND THE SCENES, but then the CURTAINS ARE RAISED and EVERYBODY SEES THEM.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nUh. I donât suppose you know what happens to a prime minister if heâs caught having secret sexytimes with an underling at a primary school?\n\nMARTINE MCCUTCHEON\n\nOne hundred percent there would be a massive scandal, his approval ratings would drop like a stone and heâd stand no chance at reelection, and she would become a national joke forever, and basically both of their lives would be ruined.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nI see. What about insteadâ¦ âAnd they all lived happily ever afterâ?\n\nMARTINE MCCUTCHEON\n\nIn this movie? I think we can swing that.\n\nMeanwhile, THOMAS has performed with the BAND at the SCHOOL PLAY but failed to get THE GIRL.\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nDangit, I went through with my genius plan of playing some drums adjacent to her, and she still didnât fall madly in love with me!\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nHoly fuck, are you telling me that all through rehearsals you still havenât attempted to actually talk to her?\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nTalkâ¦ TO her? Why thatâs just crazy enough to work! But crap, sheâll be getting on a plane in about ten minutes to leave the country. Iâm going to have to-\n\nLIAM NEESON\n\nOh God are we really doing this stupid romcom cliche\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\n-chase her through the airport!\n\nHe aggressively bypasses AIRPORT SECURITY and sprints through the AIRPORT just a couple of years after NINE ELEVEN, no doubt causing a massive panic and getting several flights cancelled and ruining hundreds of peopleâs CHRISTMAS, but hey it was all worth it so that THOMAS could confirm that SOME GIRL knows his NAME.\n\nINT. HEATHROW AIRPORT\n\nOne month later, in a convenient coincidence all of our movieâs CHARACTERS pile off the same AIRPLANE and arrive back in ENGLAND.\n\nHUGH GRANT\n\nMartine and I are still dating!\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nLÃºcia and I are still engaged!\n\nALAN RICKMAN\n\nMy marriage is still in the shitter!\n\nKRIS MARSHALL\n\nIâm still shagging those same Americans or something!\n\nLAURA LINNEY\n\nIâm still gone from this movie!\n\nBILL NIGHY\n\nIâm, like, here.\n\nANDREW LINCOLN\n\nIâm still being just friends with Keiraâ¦ is this all weâre doing in this scene? âOne month later everything was exactly the sameâ?\n\nTHOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER\n\nIâm even still with that girl, implausibly enough. Sheesh this is a nothing note to end on.\n\nHUGH GRANT (V.O.)\n\nSo there you have it! Thatâs love. Itâs beautiful, itâs messy, itâs complicated, itâs irritatingly cutesy, itâs unpredictable, sometimes itâs excruciatingly predictable. Itâs contrived, itâs artificial, itâs unrelatable. It doesnât always make sense, its characters are one-dimensional, but it makes a mint at the box office and becomes a holiday staple regardless.\n\n(smiles)\n\nBecause itâs Christmas. And at Christmas, youâre supposed to watch cheesy sentimental garbage.\n\nEND."
