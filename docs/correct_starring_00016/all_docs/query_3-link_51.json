Just why?\n\nI don't remember Emma Watson being in it?\n\nI always hated the Laura Linney storyline. Her brother was in a care home. He wouldn't have had so much access to a phone to call her all the time, (pre mobiles and even so) it was clearly obsessive reassurance seeking behaviour and the staff should have been all over it, providing distraction and deflection as it wouldn't have been good for him to continue that, not to mention causing burnout for his sole/primary support person. Sheesh.\n\nWhen Martine tells the PM her ex thought she was fat\n\n' I can call the SAS , lovely fellows , but one phone call away '\n\nI do love Hugh grant in that film\n\nI agree that much of it is dubious though, especially Keira knightly and the porn couple\n\nToo cringy\n\nTbf, I don't think it's supposed to be realistic. It's a fantasy (albeit in large part a male one). About Christmas as a time where the usual rules of things don't apply. The dissonance comes from the fact that those elements of it sit alongside sadder ones (thinking mostly of the Emma Thomspon story).\n\nIt's a strange film that we Brits get all sentimental about, and i just don't get it. There are so many cringeworthy bits as pp have said.\n\nIn the back of my head I'm thinking \"cuddly rom-com family viewing,\" and then BOOM! That Martin Freeman porn scene comes on. The whole film is below average at best, and the only bit worth watching is the Emma Thompson /Alan Rickman situation.\n\nIt's a silly film. But very watchable. I remember hating it when it came out in the cinema. But quite enjoy watching it for the nonsense now.\n\nAll these points have been made & done to death - yes, there are many, many holes in the plot & storyline; behaviour of more than a few characters is problematic viewed through today's lens; the body shaming is wrong.\n\nIf that's sufficiently bothersome, don't watch it but honestly, it's all been covered extensively.\n\n(And on Emma Thompson 'sissy' comment - actually there I disagree. That was the nature of their friendship, support hidden behind joking comments.)\n\nWhat about all the comedy forrin people at the end? I cringe so hard I nearly turn inside out. AND they have a fat one they (horrors) try to palm off on Colin Firth instead of the thin daughter. At least U think that's how I remember it."
