        "text": "Laura Linney is an American actress who works in film, television and theatre.\n\nLaura returned to Broadway in the Manhattan Theatre Club’s spring revival of Lillian Hellman’s hit, The Little Foxes this year, in which she received a Tony Nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play. The Little Foxes, directed by Tony winner Daniel Sullivan, alternated Laura and Cynthia Nixon in the lead roles of Regina Hubbard Giddens and Birdie Hubbard.\n\nShe was most recently seen in Ozark, a Netflix original series where she plays Wendy Byrde opposite Jason Bateman and Julia Garner. The second season of Ozark is set to release in 2018. She will also be seen in Netflix’s revival of Tales Of The City, where she will star opposite Olympia Dukakis and Ellen Paige.\n\nLaura will also make her London theatre debut this June in Richard Eyre’s limited three-week run of My Name Is Lucy Barton, the stage play adapted from the Elizabeth Strout novel of the same name. The play will follow Lucy Barton, who after an operation wakes to find her estranged mother at the end of her bed, bringing back memories of her early life in the country, her subsequent escape to New York and the two women’s complex relationship.\n\nLaura was also seen in The Dinner, directed by Oren Moverman with Richard Gere, Steve Coogan and Rebecca Hall, which premiered on May 5, 2017. Other recent film work includes Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals, where she played Anne Sutton – Amy Adams’ mother. While Linney’s performance lasts only three minutes and 15 seconds, it was deemed “a one-scene wonder” by Entertainment Weekly. Other recent film credits include Sully, Genius, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, You Can Count On Me, Kinsey, The Savages, The Fifth Estate, Hyde Park On Hudson, The Squid And The Whale, Mystic River, Absolute Power, The Truman Show, Primal Fear, The Mothman Prophecies, Love Actually, P.S., The House Of Mirth, The Details and Congo, among many others.\n\nLinney starred in and produced the Showtime Series The Big C for four seasons for which she won a few awards. She also won multiple awards for her portrayal of Abigail Adams in the HBO miniseries John Adams directed by Tom Hooper. Early in her career, she starred as Mary Ann Singleton in Armistead Maupin’s Tales Of The City series, a job for which she continues to be most grateful and proud. She appeared as Kelsey Grammer’s final girlfriend in the last six episodes of Fraiser; was directed by Stanley Donen in Love Letters, and starred opposite Joanne Woodward in Blind Spot.\n\nShe has also appeared in many Broadway productions, most notably Time Stands Still and Sight Unseen, both directed by Daniel Sullivan and written by Donald Margulies. Additional credits include Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, directed by Richard Eyre opposite Liam Neeson, Six Degrees of Separation, Honour, Uncle Vanya, Les Liaisons, Dangereuses, Holiday and The Seagull.\n\nLinney has been nominated three times for an Academy Award, four times for a Tony Award, once for a BAFTA Award, and five times for a Golden Globe. She has won a SAG Award, one National Board of Review Award, two Golden Globes and four Emmy Awards. She holds two honorary Doctorates from her alma maters, Brown University and The Juilliard School."
