Her mother, Miriam Anderson \"Ann\" Perse (née Leggett), was a nurse at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and her father, Romulus Zachariah Linney IV, was a playwright and professor. Linney spent summers with her father in New Hampshire and fell in love with the stage, working with the local theatre group beginning at the age of eleven.[2][3][4] Linney's paternal great-great-grandfather was Republican U.S. Congressman Romulus Zachariah Linney.

The New York Times wrote: \"Best of all is Miss Linney's Nina. From a naive, idealistic artist's groupie with a streak of crazy determination, her Nina emerges as a woman who is a lot stronger and more complicated than the terminally wounded bird-woman that is the character's traditional interpretation. Though deeply embittered at the end of the play, she is also fortified by a hard-won self-knowledge. Miss Linney projects the character's ambiguities with stinging force and clarity. She is clearly a talent of enormous potential.\"[10]\n\nLinney first appeared in minor roles in a few early 1990s films, including Lorenzo's Oil (1992), Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), and Dave (1993).
