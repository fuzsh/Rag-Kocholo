        "text": "One of the most popular Christmas movies contains 10 different love stories, but not all have happy endings. Since Love Actually takes place primarily in London, most of the actors are British, making Laura Linney one of the only Americans in the film. And her characterâs arc is among the more tragic tales.\n\nLaura Linney plays Sarah in âLove Actuallyâ\n\nThe stories in Love Actually are all connected, so Laura Linneyâs character Sarah is associated with numerous other characters. Sarah first appears at Juliet and Peterâs wedding, played by Kiera Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor. And sheâs sitting next to Colin Firthâs Jamie as they are friends. But thatâs not where Linneyâs main plotline in the movie lies.\n\nLater, the audience learns that Sarah works for Harry, played by Alan Rickman, at his graphic design company. She has been working there for two years, seven months, three days, and two hours. And Sarahâs been in love with her co-worker Karl, played by Rodrigo Santoro, for two years, seven months, three days, and an hour and 30 minutes.\n\nSarah and Karl confront their feelings for one another at the companyâs Christmas party, where they dance together. Karl drives Sarah home, and she invites him in. However, when theyâre about to have sex, Sarahâs brother Michael, who has a mental illness, calls. And she has to visit him.\n\nAt the end of Love Actually, Sarah and Karl work late on Christmas Eve. He wishes her a merry Christmas just before he leaves, but nothing more happens. So the question of whether or not Sarah and Karl end up together is left in the air.\n\nThe âLove Actuallyâ sequel features Laura Linney, but not Rodrigo Santoro\n\nIn March 2017, BBC broadcasted Red Nose Day Actually, a short sequel to Love Actually, to raise funds for Red Nose Day.\n\nIn the original version of the Love Actually sequel, Laura Linney didnât appear. However, NBC aired the short film a couple of months later that included Sarah and gave fans an update on her love story.\n\nSadly, Rodrigo Santoroâs Karl is nowhere to be seen in Red Nose Day Actually. Instead, Patrick Dempsey, who isnât in the original movie, is the man in Sarahâs life. Dempsey plays her husband; they have children, cats, and a house together.\n\nItâs unclear what happened to Karl, but perhaps Sarah moved back to the United States, met Dempseyâs character, and moved on with her life.\n\nRodrigo Santoro has a different ending for Sarah and Karl\n\nAlthough the Love Actually sequel confirms that Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoroâs characters donât end up together, Santoro has another conclusion in mind.\n\nDuring an appearance on Buzzfeed Newsâ show AM to PM, the actor discussed the Christmas movie and his interpretation of Sarah and Karlâs relationship after the film.\n\nâI personally love the movie,â Santoro shared. âItâs so well written, and thatâs one of the reasons that the movieâs still there and itâs one of the peopleâs favorites. Itâs complicated, itâs complex, itâs sweet, itâs just smart, itâs fun, and itâs just a blessing to have been a part of it.â\n\nAnd he believes that Sarah and Karl got their happily ever after. Santoro said, âYes, definitely yes. Iâm much more mature now. Different times. Sixteen years later!â\n\nThe actor is also on board for making a proper sequel.\n\nâThat would be great to get all those actors together 16 years later [and find out] what happened to them,â Santoro explained. âThere was talk. I donât know if they ever really meant it, but they were talking about a sequel. But I donât know if it will ever come. I would love that!â\n\nLove Actually is available to stream on Peacock. And fans can watch Red Nose Day Actually on Facebook.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZpicrKWWua3FjKWYrqqRYrmqus2esGabmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlmnZ6Zeqyt0aVkrJ2hqrKtesetpKVn"
