        "text": "Back in March, Love Actually fans found themselves divided into two camps: those who lived in England, and were thus able to watch Red Nose Day’s cast reunion immediately, and those who lived across the pond, who would have to wait until May. Luckily, Thursday night brought everyone onto the same page, as NBC finally aired the full reunion—with a special guest appearance by Patrick Dempsey, who was not in the version that aired originally in the U.K.\n\nWhat was the erstwhile McDreamy doing in Love Actually? Turns out he’s the happy ending for Sarah, played by Laura Linney. In the original film, Linney’s character chooses caring for her mentally ill brother over a relationship with Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), her ultra-sexy work crush. Luckily, it seems the 2010s have been kinder to Sarah than the early aughts. In the reunion, she’s once again working late when she gets a call. She answers, addressing the caller as “my darling,” which might lead viewers to expect to hear her brother, with whom she also used that term of endearment, on the other end of the line. Instead, there Dempsey is. He’s her husband, and by the look of things, they have at least one child and a cat. Good for them!\n\nAs for the rest of the gang: as you might have heard in March, Andrew Lincoln’s Mark apparently really did marry Kate Moss, while Juliet and Peter (Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor) are still happily married. Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son (Game of Thrones’s Thomas Brodie-Sangster) reunite to talk about love, actually, as the kid turns up with his old school crush, Joanna (Olivia Olson), so that she can ask for his hand in marriage. (How modern!) Bill Nighy’s Billy Mack is as narcissistic as ever; Rowan Atkinson is still wrapping gifts at the speed of cold molasses—albeit at Walgreens now. And as for Hugh Grant’s prime minister? He’s not the dancer he used to be, as evidenced by the disastrous results from his “Hotline Bling” jam session.\n\nLove Actually: Behind the Scenes\n\n1 / 8\n\nLondon, Actually\n\nLove Actually Stars Offer Fans “Cuddles,” a Tea Date, and More for a Good Cause\n\nJoin Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, and Richard Curtis in London, actually.\n\nthe worst, actually\n\nLove Actually: Andrew Lincoln Thought His Character Was a “Creepy Stalker”\n\nThat famously romantic scene with Keira Knightley made the actor incredibly nervous.\n\nthe plot thickens\n\nThe American Version of the Love Actually Sequel Has a Surprise Twist\n\nSo this is why Laura Linney wasn’t featured in the British version. . .\n\nTelevision\n\nBill O’Reilly and Jon Stewart Reunite After a Decade for On-Air Battle\n\nFor the first Daily Show episode since the attempt on Trump’s life, Stewart invited an old sparring partner back into the ring to discuss this “terrible fucking week.”\n\nPolitics\n\nAs Donald Trump’s Prospects Soar, Ivanka Inches Back to the National Stage\n\nSources say Ivanka will attend next week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee—a dramatic turnaround after skipping Trump’s campaign launch and criminal trial.\n\nRoyals\n\nKate Middleton Gets Back Behind the Camera to Celebrate Prince William’s 42nd Birthday\n\nIn the week since her return to the spotlight at Trooping the Colour, the Princess of Wales has proven that she is using her photography skills again.\n\nNews\n\nNikki Haley Wants Her Own Voters to Get Off the Fence—and Back Donald Trump\n\nDuring her Tuesday night speech at the Republican National Convention, Haley addressed her past feud with the former president while giving him her wholehearted support: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him.”\n\nNews\n\nAbortion Was Scarcely Mentioned in RNC Speeches Despite Coordinated GOP Effort to Roll Back Protections\n\nFrom Republican nominee Donald Trump to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, those who usually have a lot to say about abortion were remarkably silent on the issue.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace.

The restructuring “may look callous,” she says. “But it’s so that we get it right, so I don’t have to do it over again.”"
