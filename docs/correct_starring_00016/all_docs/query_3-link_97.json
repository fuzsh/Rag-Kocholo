        "text": "I adore “Downton Abbey,” the latest TV series that people like to talk about in part so they can establish that they are the kind of person who watches “Downton Abbey.” Luckily, I, too, am that kind of person, so I have no problem with everyone I know chuckling about the Dowager’s latest zinger. (I review the show in next week’s issue. Spoiler: it’s a positive review.)\n\nNonetheless, I do have a bone to pick with PBS. Now, I’m sympathetic to their excitement over the show’s success. I understand their desire to make a nice frame for their big hit. As the New York Times recently pointed out, this a chance for PBS to swagger like HBO and AMC: “Downton” is their “Mad Men,” their “Sopranos,” their opportunity to stick a fat tentpole up under that tatty do-gooder tent.\n\nBut do we really need Laura Linney, in a black dress and a tense grin, to welcome us?\n\nThis is nothing against Linney (I’m sure she’s a very nice woman, and I really enjoyed “You Can Count on Me”), but what is she doing there? Is she intended to represent the kind of tense uptown white lady who might be hosting a “Downton Abbey”-themed dinner party—or perhaps conducting a surprise graduate seminar on the show? Is she meant to make us feel safe with the British accents, acting as a gentle psychological bridge from “Love, Actually?” What is that half smile all about? Why is she talking to me in that soft, confiding voice? She seems friendly but she’s actually very angry, right? Because I must say, she’s freaking me out.\n\nAlso, every time I see Lady Linney, I think of this:\n\nSeriously, PBS, these sorts of painful intros are not happening on AMC. You don’t see Robert Downey, Jr., introducing “Breaking Bad.” CBS hasn’t cut a deal with Silda Spitzer to introduce “The Good Wife” (although maybe they should, because last night’s episode was outstanding, and the show doesn’t get nearly enough buzz)."
