She has won one SAG Award, one National Board of Review Award, two Golden Globes, and four Emmys.

Among her prominent Broadway productions are The Crucible, Time Stands Still, Sight Unseen, and Six Degrees of Separation. And on television, she has starred in the Showtime series The Big C and the HBO mini-series John Adams, as well as Tales of the City and Frasier. She currently features as Wendy Byrde in Ozark, a role for which she has earned Emmy and SAG Award nominations.\n\nLinney holds honorary doctorates from her alma maters, Brown University and The Julliard School. She has been honored for her work in cancer advocacy and is a sought-after speaker focusing on reconsidering the arts as essential for success, easing the pain of cancer and finding beauty in tragedy, and navigating gender inequality in the film industry. She also delivers master classes on acting and theatre.

Linney was born on February 5, 1964 in Manhattan into a theatrical family; her father was the playwright Romulus Linney. She graduated from Brown University in 1986 and later studied at the Arts Theatre School in Moscow and graduated from the Juilliard School (M.F.A.) in New York City in 1990. She immediately began performing on Broadway, eventually earning praise for her roles in Six Degrees of Separation and Hedda Gabler.\n\nLinney began her film career with a small part in Lorenzo’s Oil (1992), followed by a role in the comedy Dave (1993). In 1993 she also appeared as Mary Ann Singleton in Tales of the City, the television miniseries based on Armistead Maupin’s book. Her breakthrough came in 1996 when she starred opposite Richard Gere in the film Primal Fear, a thriller that revolves around the murder of an archbishop. This led to starring roles in other movies, including Absolute Power (1997)—in which she portrayed the daughter of a man (played by Clint Eastwood) who is framed for a murder involving the president—and the comedy-drama The Truman Show (1998).
