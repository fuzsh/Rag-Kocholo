Mudvayne is an American heavy metal band formed in Peoria, Illinois, in 1996.[1] Known for their sonic experimentation, face and body paint, masks and uniforms, the band has sold over five million records worldwide.[2] The group consists of guitarist Greg Tribbett, drummer Matthew McDonough, lead vocalist Chad Gray, and bassist Ryan Martinie. The band became popular in the late-1990s Peoria underground music scene,[citation needed] and they found success with the single "Dig" from their debut album L.D. 50 (2000). After releasing four more albums and touring relentlessly for nearly a decade, Mudvayne went on hiatus in 2010. They reunited in 2021 and continue to perform live.[3][4]
