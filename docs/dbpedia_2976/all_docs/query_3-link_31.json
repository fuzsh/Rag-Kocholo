        "text": "Proven Quality Since 1888\n\nFrank McDonough opened a small manufacturing plant with the intention of building custom made sawmill equipment that was better than anything being built at that time. Because he worked in the sawmill, he knew first hand what equipment improvements were needed. The mill was built on the banks of the Eau Claire River in a city now nicknamed “Sawdust City” because saw milling was the main industry in the 1800s when thirteen sawmills were operation in Eau Claire. By the early 1930s the virgin white pine was gone and so were the mills along the banks of the Eau Claire River. But Frank’s machinery manufacturing company survived and prospered.\n\nBy 1890 McDonough’s equipment was already recognized for its innovations, rugged design and value. Two years later, in 1892, McDonough was granted a patent on the first “Traveling Bed Feed Resaw”, now known as a Linebar Resaw. Today, it is one of the most profitable machines in the modern mill-a machine that has actually saved many sawmills from extinction.\n\nThe most recognized provider of sawmill machinery solutions.\n\nThe lumber industry has grown and changed a lot since the 1880s, and McDonough Manufacturing Company has grown right along with it. We have never lost our ability for innovation nor our desire to make the best sawmill equipment available. Our exclusive Super Duty Air Strain system is a case in point. So is our patented McDonough End Dogging Log Feeding system. McDonough Band Mills, Band Resaws and related equipment items are better known than ever for rugged design, reliability and value. Our continuing company policy of complete, personal service is still the best in the industry.\n\nBrand loyalty is no longer the main factor in new equipment purchases. Value and payback have become the new criteria and we are still considered a preferred supplier. There’s a reason we haven’t forgotten Frank McDonough’s original philosophy that has brought us to where we are today.\n\nHighest standard of efficiency.\n\nMcDonough Manufacturing was started to fulfill a need. Frank McDonough’s business philosophy was clearly stated on his business logo: “McDonough sawing Machinery - Highest Standard of Efficiency - Rapid Production -Design - Durability - Simplicity - Strength.”\n\nBy 1890 McDonough’s equipment was already recognized for its innovations, rugged design and value.
