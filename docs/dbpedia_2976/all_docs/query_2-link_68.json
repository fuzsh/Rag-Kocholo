        "text": "I'm sorry, but personally, I don't get it. I think the band is ok. Ryan, he's a good bass player, but in my opinion, far from deserving of the pedastal so many people like PB seem to want to put him on. Chad, if your into that sort of thing, does a good job, but wanting to emulate that, i just don't get it. The band in general, like I said, their ok, but.... great? I don't see it.\n\nPB, I know your young, and at your age hero worship is still a pretty big thing. I know when I was young, Geddy Lee was my hero and I didn't think any other bassplayer in the world could hold a candle to him. Hmmm ok, so I guess I didn't completely grow up or out of it because, Geddy is still my hero. And there is something to be said for learning to emulate the style or sound you like to help you learn and grow as a musician. But let me tell you lil bro, if your only claim to fame is that you sound or play just like somebody else, then there will be very little fame in your future. Its about finding the musician inside of you. Finding your sound and your style and if you are lucky enough to find a sound/style that is new or unique, then your chances of succeess as a musican grows tremedously. While the ability to duplicate someones sound/style can have its place in a cover band, having your own style/sound and taking what they did and making it your own more often is much more appealing, even in a cover band.\n\nSo my advice to you PB, I think if your would spend as much time and effort as you spend trying to sound/play like someone else, trying to find your sound/style, you would be a much better bass player and to start that quest while still as young as you are, will help put you well ahead of the game. Because trust me, once you start the journey to find the musician thats inside you, you will spend the rest of your life on it. Because as we grow, and I'm not just talking age, are tastes change or perhaps get more refined. Example... as a kid we want soda pop, doesn't matter what kind as long as its soda pop. Then as we grow a little as soda pop drinkers, it starts to matter, whether we realize it or not, we take the pepsi challange and we decide we want pepsi over coke, or whatever. I was a pepsi man persoanally. But today, I drink Ruby Red Squirt almost excluseivly. What the heck does this have to do with music, Yes, I can hearing you asking that. Nothing and everything. It was purely a way to demonstrate that over the years, as we grow are tasteslse is using change or become more refined. The same is true with our music. The simplist example would be.. look at when we first started playing music, That cheap bass and that crappy little distorted amp sounded great to us... were making music and were gonna be rockstars.... how long did it take for that cheap bass and crappy lil amp to lose its appeal and to become nothing more then the crap they have always been but we were to nieve to know better. Today we want a better bass and a better amp. As we grow we really start getting demanding with exactly what we want from our gear. The music inside of you is exactly that. Today you are happy sounding like someone else, tomorrow you will start wanting to start finding your sound, and all I am saying to ya bro, the earlier you start that journey, the better it will be for you in the long run.\n\nSo keep in mind, there is nothing wrong with learning a technique or finding a sound someone else has as long as you keep it in perspective as far as, how can I use this to my betterment, because if you are trying to be nothing more than a copy of someone else, you my friend are doomed.\n\nOr at least this is my opinion. And having said all this ... I used to be able to start with 2112 and play my way through farewell to kings and onto hemispheres, straight through, note for note. So you can take this post for what its worth. But I can tell ya, I wasted alot of time trying to be Geddy before I finally discovered BassPlyr Randy."
