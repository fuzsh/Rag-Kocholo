        "text": "For those who don’t know, Mudvayne hasn’t really been a thing since 2009, sadly. Ever since their singer, Chad Gray, and guitarist, Greg Tribbett, have formed the supergroup of Hellyeah, the most recent work of Mudvayne was their self-titled album that marked their 5th studio album release.\n\nIt’s been 5 long years for long time Mudvayne fans like myself, Hellyeah is scheduled to release another album later this year, and all we’ve heard about the return of Mudvayne is on Wikipedia saying “Mudvayne will be on hiatus until at least 2014.” “At least?” Man, I know Hellyeah has been doing good and sold some good stuff, and that all the members of Mudvayne are doing something in music that satiate their appetite, but come on. It’s been 5 years and we demand a return of a great band to put more great albums back on the music shelves around the world!\n\nNow, before I get yelled at, let me just say that I’m willing to wait as long as I have to to get a new album. Even all the demands and questions from fans got to whoever manages the band’s Facebook because at the end of March this year said, “Final Explanation.. Mudvayne is on Hiatus.. With respect to all the band members, we are all doing something in Music that satisfies our appetite right now. When the time is right, Mudvayne WILL be back in action. In no shape or form is this a disrespect to our Fans. We Love our Fans and will give them all they can handle when it is Time. Til then, Patience is needed. Sincerely Mudvayne.. NOW RANT!!!” This post shows that the desire for a return has been increasing in numbers of people around the world. I understand that Mudvayne members have been keeping themselves busy and that’s amazing news no matter how you look at it. Even when Mudvayne isn’t together they’re still doing work that can and potentially will improve their musical prowess and that will lead to albums that will be loved by fans and in no way be disappointed in any way, shape, or form. And if you don’t agree with me think of it this way : imagine a band you love going on hiatus and doing nothing during that time period, and then coming back and putting out a really shitty album that doesn’t deserve to be in the presence of that band’s past work. I think that about sums it up, wouldn’t you think?\n\nI can’t deny that I love Mudvayne and I want a return as soon as possible… but I can wait. I may not want to but I will. And why? Because it’s worth it. I hope the term “good things come to those who wait” is greatly expressed here.\n\nAnd to those who don’t understand my anticipation for this band to return… just imagine if it were announced that Disturbed was getting back together after all these years. Wouldn’t that be great, too?"
