        "text": "Mudvayne, which has been on hiatus since 2010, is set to reunite this fall and perform at four festivals in the United States: Inkcarceration in Mansfield, Ohio; Louder Than Life in Louisville, Kentucky; Aftershock in Sacramento, California; and Welcome to Rockville in Daytona, Beach, Florida.\n\nThe only exact performance date that has been announced is Oct. 9 at Aftershock. Inkcarceration will take place Sept. 10 to 12, Louder Than Life is set for Sept. 23 to 26, and Welcome to Rockville will be from Nov. 11 to 14.\n\nMudvayne posted the following statement to social media: “These symptoms suggested that our evolution, I suppose, from the animal kingdom into human kingdom itself was catalyzed or triggered by our encounter with these hallucinogenics, and… Yes, we are an ape with a symbiotic relationship to a mushroom, and that has given us self reflection, language, religion, and all the spectrum of effects that flow from these things And one can only wonder how these hallucinogens might effect our future evolution as well They have brought us to this point and as we make our relationship to them conscious, we may be able to take control of our future evolutionary path.”\n\nDanny Wimmer, founder of Danny Wimmer Presents said: “In our fan surveys, Mudvayne has consistently been one of the most requested bands – even though they weren’t an active band! We’ve been working for years to make this happen, so when I got the call that they’d finally take a meeting, (DWP Executive VP and Talent Buyer) Gary Spivack and I jumped at the chance to fly to Vegas. We sat down for dinner with Mudvayne, their lawyer Eric German, manager Diony Sepulveda and agent Ryan Harlacher – the band hadn’t even been in the same room together for 10 years – and pleaded our case for why the time was right for this to happen. We were hoping to announce this in 2020, we’re fortunate enough to be able to do it in 2021, and DWP is super pumped to have Mudvayne exclusively at all four of our festivals this year.”\n\nMudvayne’s last release was its self-titled album in 2009. The band formed in 1996 and released five full-length albums, the first three of which—”L.D. 50″ (2000), “The End of All Things to Come” (2002) and “Lost and Found” (2005)—have been certified gold, along with the single “Dig” from the first album. The single “Happy?” reached number one on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart in 2005, one of the band’s six top 10 singles.\n\nVocalist Chad Gray and guitarist Greg Tribbett were founding members of Hellyeah in 2006. Tribbett left that band in 2014 and, with Mudvayne drummer Matthew McDonough, later formed Audiotopsy, which has released two albums. (The future of Hellyeah is uncertain after the death of drummer Vinnie Paul in 2018 and the release of his final recordings on the album “Welcome Home” in 2019.) Mudvayne bassist Ryan Martinie started playing with jazz fusion/progressive rock band Soften the Glare in 2015. In March 2021, Gray released his first solo single, a cover of “Always on My Mind,” a song made famous by Willie Nelson.\n\nFor more information on the Danny Wimmer Presents festivals, visit:\n\nwww.DannyWimmerPresents.com\n\nwww.AftershockFestival.com\n\nwww.Inkcarceration.com\n\nwww.LouderThanLifeFestival.com\n\nwww.WelcomeToRockvilleFestival.com\n\nFor more information on Mudvayne, visit:"
