        "text": "This is my favorite band, they have been ever since I heard Not Falling on Fuse. I then sought out to buy \"LD50\" and \"The End of All Things to Come\". Then I found out they had a earlier EP, \"The Beginning of All Things to Come\", downloaded it, it wasn't bad, not great though...\n\nThey just released \"Lost and Found\" not too long ago, earlier this month. I love it. My favorite songs are \"Rain.Sun.Gone\", \"IMN\", \"Determined\", \"Happy\", and \"TV Radio\". But all of the songs are very good.\n\nThere bassist, Ryan Martinie, is great. He's my favorite bassist, but in this album the bass isn't as pronounced as the previous two. Still very good basslines though, lots of slapping/popping and tapping. (Some people may not care about that at all, but I'm a bassist so I said it.)\n\nAnyways, what do you think of them?\n\nI think \"The End Of All Things To Come\" was their peak in every way. It was an improvement over \"L.D 50\", and the lyrics in TEOATTC were just superb, in my opinions.\n\nReally creative band when they want to be. \"Lost & Found\" is a real departure from the Mudvayne I first discovered on MTV2 one night after church. There's no songs like Dig or Not Falling on this record. It's good, but it's just not the Mudvayne I know and love.\n\nUncle raj: Check out The End of All Things to Come. (The album, not the song. The End of All Things to Come song is pretty odd.) It has more melody. Especially World So Cold. Extremely good song, one of their best.\n\nCasey: Determined is supposed to be the Dig/Not Falling rival. I do know what you mean, Lost and Found isn't the same, but that makes me happy in a way. Personally I thought LD50 was the best sonically, it was just so raw, and lots of talent. TEOATTC was held back a little bit, I think it could have been a lot better, but I loved it anyways. The lyrics on TEOATTC was definately the best Chad has written.\n\nYay. We need another Mudvayne topic, mine got lost under some dust a long while ago. >_>\n\nCurrently my favorite band \"No way! The name and the sig don't give it away at all\" you say. \"You're quite the clever cat\" I reply.\n\nAnyway. I only have the 4 CDs, because I'm too lazy to find out if there are any more obscure ones, and I don't buy singles >.<; but goddamn what a great band.\n\nLD50 just blew my mind when I heard it. End of All Things (which I actually picked up first, thinking Dig and Death blooms were on it), started me off. And Lost and Found is just a work of bloody art. Then there's the re-release of Kill I Oughtta -- The Beginning of All Things to Come -- but I digress. Great great band.\n\nKill I Oughta\n\nThe Beginning of All Things to Come\n\nL.D. 50\n\nThe End of All Things to Come\n\nLost And Found\n\nIf you have the above albums, you have them all. I don't know about singles, I don't buy them either, but there are no other albums.\n\nI didn't like Kill I Oughta/TBOATTC that much, they were both basically the same I think, pretty much same songs and everything. I hated Poop Loser, but hell I love all of their other songs, as I said, my favorite band.\n\nHeh, it makes you happy.\n\nBad pun, I know.\n\nI do like Mudvayne very much. Death Blooms is my favorite song\n\nAs far as I know, the only difference is that TBOATTC has 2 Dig remixes and \"A version of the interludes in their entirety from our album L.D.50\" other than that, they say \"this recording is an unaltered version of a demo that we had originally put together for solicitatrion purposes... \"etc.\n\nWell, good to know I pretty much have it all then (not like LP - I have bloody 13 disks of official stuff XD).\n\nI love Mudvayne, I remember when I first bought L.D. 50, I hadn't really heard anything by the band and purchased the album on impulse alone but it blew me away, it was the first Mudvayne album I bought and by far my favourite, even though I love all their other material.\n\nTheir bass player is amazing and Chad has an amazing vocal range, overall Mudvayne are by far one of my favourite bands.\n\nOh, and Death blooms has got to be the best Mudvayne song ever.\n\nMy thoughts= Adam's\n\n@ Adam:Have you heard Death Blooms on the Ozzfest 2001 CD?You gotta check it out.It has everything-Great Bass work,Melodic singing and Brutal screaming by Chad\n\nMy thoughts= Adam's\n\n@ Adam:Have you heard Death Blooms on the Ozzfest 2001 CD?You gotta check it out.It has everything-Great Bass work,Melodic singing and Brutal screaming by Chad [/b][/quote]\n\nI haven't heard it on the Ozzfest 2001 CD but I thought it would of been the same as the album version, but if it isn't I may have to go check that out."
