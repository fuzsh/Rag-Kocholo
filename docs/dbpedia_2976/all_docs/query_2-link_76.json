        "text": "Vocalist Chad Gray and guitarist Greg Tribbett have been taking part in an on-going side-project that includes drummer Vinnie Paul (Pantera) and the guitarist and bassist for Nothingface, Tom Maxwell and Jerry Montano, respectively.\n\nThe band's name is called HELLYEAH and will be releasing its debut April 10th, 2007, via Epic Records. You can hear rough cuts of two tracks at the band's official mySpace:\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/hellyeah\n\nThe two Mudvayne members will tour in support of the new project in between recording the upcoming Mudvayne album, which is slated for a third or fourth quarter release. The band is once again working with Dave Fortman, who worked with them on Lost and Found.\n\nAccording to Gray, he is excited for both Mudvayne's and HELLYEAH's futures:\n\nIt's cool to have both Mudvayne and HELLYEAH as creative outlets now, even though the approach, subject matter, and attitudes between the two projects are completely different. I'm looking forward to balancing both bands in my life â€” my new extremely busy life."
