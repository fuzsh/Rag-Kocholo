        "text": "Some celebrities have famous lookalikes that you’ve probably never noticed…\n\nWe all know that Nina Dobrev and Victoria Justice were most certainly twins separated at birth because they look completely identical – and anything less than matching DNA doesn’t make sense.\n\nWe are also all guilty of mixing up the redheads of Hollywood, Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard – and also Isla Fisher and Amy Adams, who are constantly mistaken for one another by fans.\n\nWe even see the Jesse Plemons and Matt Damon confusion, but these are all a bit…familiar.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of some of the celebrity lookalikes in Hollywood you’ve almost certainly never noticed – and now you won’t be able to unsee…\n\nCate Blanchett and Domhnall Gleeson\n\nIt’d be easy to think that Domhnall Gleeson’s celebrity lookalike is his father, Brendan Gleeson – but think again!\n\nWith his pale skin and ethereal beauty, Domhnall has a very similar look to Cate Blanchett.\n\nWhile on The Graham Norton Show earlier this year, the actor revealed that some of his old colleagues had gone so far as to nickname him Cate because he looked so much like the actress.\n\n‘All my cast mates started calling me Cate because at that time I particularly really looked like her,’ he revealed.\n\n‘And I’d be walking down the street and people would stop to tell me that I looked like Cate Blanchett which was upsetting as a young man trying to make your way into the world.’\n\n‘You’re like “I’m on the West End” and “Cate!” like “f**k off”,’ he joked.\n\nDaisy Edgar Jones and Joseph Quinn\n\nDaisy Edgar Jones’s doppelganger is Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn who is currently starring in A Quiet Place: Day One.\n\nWhile promoting her film Twisters, the actress spoke about their similar looks.\n\n‘I haven’t been mistaken for Joe Quinn but people do tell me I look like a female Joe Quinn.’ She then conceded: ‘I see it.’\n\nIn an interview with Elle in 2022, the star again: ‘Apparently, I’m really great in the most recent season of Stranger Things.’\n\n‘Everyone is saying I look like Joe [Joseph] Quinn, who is brilliant in that series. I do see the likeness.’ She then added: ‘I think we could play brother or sister.’\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Elvis Presley\n\nOK, now hear us out.\n\nYes, Khloe Kardashian doesn’t look like the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll at the moment, but Khloe from a decade ago? We see it!\n\nIt’s most likely the high cheekbones and the almond eye shape paired with the pointed chin that makes the duo look rather similar.\n\nSadly the pair never got to cross paths as Elvis died seven years before the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star reality star was born.\n\nJenna Ortega and Pete Davidson\n\nJenna Ortega is better known for her Stanley Kubrick stare and her dead-pan expressionless face in Wednesday – but one frame from the Tim Burton Netflix series is most certainly giving Pete Davidson vibes.\n\nWith their pristine white teeth and their matching dark brown eyes and eye shape, there is something similar about their looks.\n\nAlthough their faces may have some similarities, Jenna is 5ft 1 and Pete is 6ft 3, so they would probably look a little different in real life next to each other.\n\nSophie Turner and Boy George\n\nGame of Thrones star Sophie Turner looks surprisingly similar to Boy George when he was younger.\n\nIn fact, in a 2019 interview, the singer said that he would be quite happy for the actress to play him in a biopic.\n\n‘There’s been some really interesting suggestions,’ he told Australian radio show 96.9 Fitzy and Wippa. ‘One of the most interesting suggestions was Sophie Turner.\n\n‘It’s really strange, but that’s been a suggestion. I think that will upset people, which I quite like. Like, Oh, she can’t play you, she’s a woman, you know. But when I was 17, I would have loved to have been her! That was the ambition.’\n\nIggle Piggle and David Cameron\n\nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron looks surprisingly like In The Night Garden’s Iggle Piggle.\n\nSomeone pointed out this similarity about a decade ago, and the memes haven’t really stopped since then.\n\nYes, the politician doesn’t look identical to the magical children’s TV character, but there is something similar about the pair that we can’t quite put our finger on.\n\nZac Efron and Leonard Whiting\n\nAnyone who was forced to watch Romeo and Juliet 1968 during their GCSEs will be well aware that the guy playing Romeo, Leonard Whiting, looks just like Zac Efron – specifically in his High School Musical and 17 Again era.\n\nIs it because of the side fringe? Perhaps. But the internet has been up in arms about the similarities for decades.\n\nThere are even articles explaining that Zac Efron did not star in the 1968 film because he wasn’t born until 1987.\n\nTimothee Chalamet and Natalia Dyer\n\nStranger Things star Natalia Dyer looks just like Timothee Chalamet, which fans realised in 2019.\n\nIt’s most likely their marching jawlines and straight eyebrows but the pair certainly share a few similar delicate features that make them look just like brother and sister.\n\nPeople are even urging casting directors to hire the duo to play twins – we’d definitely tune in to watch that!\n\nNeal McDonough and Robert Ri’chard\n\nWith his white blonde hair, some think that Neal McDonough looks a little like the late James Michael Tyler who played Gunther on Friends, but we have found an even stronger doppelgänger.\n\nThe Band of Brothers and Desperate Housewives star looks just like Cousin Skeeter star Robert Ri’chard.\n\nThe pair have almost the exact same features with matching eyes, noses, eyebrows and mouth shapes. Even their differences can’t hide the fact that the pair basically have the same face.\n\nOnce again we demand a film where the pair play brothers or at least relatives of some kind!\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Big cat sighting of ‘large hissing creature’ revealed in UK government files\n\nMORE : Detective who can never forget a face reveals who he wants to find next"
