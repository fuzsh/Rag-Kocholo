        "text": "Allow me to share a secret that may come as a shocker to you: my first music wasn’t the pop-punk that I love and defend so often (although Good Charlotte’s The Young and the Hopeless was the first CD I ever bought). No, it was Nu Metal. In fact, nu metal defined the majority of music that I bought and worshipped when I first went to public school in the eighth grade.\n\nNow, as I look back on those days when I started wearing black band tees and tight jeans, I can still sort of see why nu metal was such an appealing genre. In high school, everything sucks. I mean, even if you have every reason to be generally happy, there’s always some problem that, in your teenage mind, is so severe that you can do nothing but incessantly whine about it, much to your friends’ chagrin. Nu metal appeals to that side of every teenager’s life: in those moments when your problems, no matter how small, matter; artists in this genre just seem to get you. So, with that, I can see why nu metal appeals to a wide audience.\n\nBut I have a problem with the abject worship of these bands that have made a mockery of rock ‘n’ roll in the post-grunge world. There are some of these bands that I think have truly furthered the artistic craft that they started in the late 90’s and the early 00’s, but I’ll thank them later in this article. At this point, I’d like to bash (and I mean bash) the artists that should’ve stopped long ago, back before Ozzfest was just a wet dream for Korn fans.\n\nSpeaking of Korn, they are by far the worst offenders. Back in 1998, Korn was arguably one of the most inventive rock bands around. I know it seems trite now, but “Freak on a Leash” really was a new idea. Not only was the video, which featured artistic camera angles following the never-ending path of a bullet, so impressive, but the song was just plain awesome. The beat boxing that Jonathan Davis nails in the song’s breakdown is earth-shatteringly good. And I’ll admit, I’ve enjoyed songs from 2005’s See You on the Other Side and 2007’s Untitled, but even I had to look back at those songs and, well.. They aren’t on my iPod anymore.\n\nBut Korn aren’t the guiltiest offenders because they’ve made some of the best nu metal; they are the worst because they just won’t stop. Since 2010, Korn have released three new albums (Korn III, The Path of Totality, and Paradigm Shift), each more depressing than the last. Korn III attempts to recall the glory days of the band’s sound, before guitarist Brian “Head” Welch quit to become a born-again Christian. But all it succeeds in doing is proving that there is an age limit for bands in this genre, and 42 (that’s right, Davis is 42!) is too damn old. The last two albums, the latter even featuring the return of Welch, pack in so much dub-step that it’s impossible to tell that this is even Rock. Rock is about substance and vocal; if not vocal, then at least soul. “Freak on a Leash” had some soul; “Never Never” never has and never will.\n\nLimp Bizkit also falls into this category of ineptitude. I’ll admit, even though I’ve never liked anything they’ve ever done, Significant Other was not unlistenable. Like Davis in “Freak on a Leash,” the fusion of hip/hop and heavy metal comes right on through on singles like “Break Stuff.” They were pretty incendiary in their time and I am none too surprised that a lot of their material is still considered some of the best examples of nu metal as a genre.\n\nBut this is what Fred Durst looks like in 2013! That jump he’s making in the picture above? What, is he trying to be twenty again? The only front men that can still exude that kind of charisma and energy past forty are men like Iggy Pop and David Lee Roth, and that’s because those legends maintained a strict training regimen that allow them to stay fit enough to perform acrobatics on stage. Durst clearly doesn’t; he can’t pull off the exciting performances he could in his youth. That, on top of the reductive new album entitled Gold Cobra, leaves a lot to be desired. And I mean a lot.\n\nThe last band on my hit parade of hate has to be Mudvayne. Unlike Korn or Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne embraced the heavy metal aspect of nu metal as opposed to the hip/hop and, frankly, that’s probably a good thing. Vocalist Chad Gray and drummer Matthew McDonough could never have achieved the sort of rhythm necessary to bring rap influence into the mix. But it wasn’t necessary. Gray’s scream and Greg Tribbett’s heavy riffs made their music every bit as impressive as Korn’s. I could point to “Dig,” “Not Falling,” and “Happy?” to argue this point.\n\nBut Mudvayne has dried up in the last few years. Their last two records, The New Game (2008) and Mudvayne (2009), attempted to infuse a pop sensibility while removing the anger and tension that made their first three records enjoyable. Gray’s scream is reduced to nothing and sales began to tumble. So it’s no wonder that Gray and Tribbett put Mudvayne on hold to perform with Hellyeah, a less-than-stellar southern metal band featuring Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul. That’s how bad Mudvayne became: they sold out and then went Hank III on their music.\n\nCan nu metal really just be this bad nowadays? Other music critics I’ve read and watched would say, without a doubt, yes. But I’m not that nonchalant about disregarding an entire genre. Having grown up with this type of music, I can point to several instances in which bands attempted and in some ways succeeded in improving their sound and style.\n\nThe greatest success story is Linkin Park. Their initial success was leaps and bounds higher than any other nu metal band; Hybrid Theory and Meteora defied logic with how many units they moved. In fact, Hybrid Theory is the most successful debut album for any musical act in the 21st century and it was certified diamond after only five years on the shelves. Airplay furthered hit singles like “In the End,” “One Step Closer,” and “Numb”. While the two albums sounds eerily similar in sound, style, and subject matter, it didn’t matter. Linkin Park defined nu metal for a brief period. Combining Chester Bennington’s blistering scream, Mike Shinoda’s emotive lyricism and flow, and the band’s high octane energy level made Linkin Park the rock band of the early 00’s. I mean, how many other nu metal bands found success with a crossover featuring Jay-Z?\n\nLinkin Park’s key to success was their ability to change with the ebb and flow of rock ‘n’ roll. Unlike Korn, Slipknot, and Disturbed, Linkin Park felt the pulse of modern music a little more closely. Minutes to Midnight, released in 2007, completely revamped their sound, nearly abandoning rap and, to some degree, the rage that made Hybrid Theory and Meteora such memorable records. I won’t stand behind Minutes to Midnight as an artistic triumph, but the success of their singles certainly translated into decent record sales, especially in 2007.\n\nA continued reinvention took place on their last two records, the highly political A Thousand Suns and the nostalgic Living Things. Fans may have lambasted A Thousand Suns, but it actually stands apart, for me, as their most well put together record. Everything on it flows so smoothly and the pseudo-communist themes in songs like “When They Come for Me” and “Wretches and Kings” are lyrically fascinating. Living Things brought back the short, aggressive sound, but counter-balanced it with slower, balladeer tracks not dissimilar from those featured on Minutes to Midnight. But Living Things is an artistic triumph: try listening to “Lost in the Echo” or “Victimized” without feeling chills.\n\nLinkin Park is probably the only nu metal band to continue to hit #1 on the charts, but other bands have attempted to redefine their sounds and proven to be good at it. Papa Roach, once known for combining rap and rock, has since moved through post-grunge on Getting Away With Murder, emo-metal on The Paramour Sessions, glam metal on Metamorphosis, and now electro-metal on 2012’s The Connection. The days of “Last Resort” and “Broken Home” are gone with the wind.\n\nBut I love Getting Away with Murder: “Not Listening,” “Done with You,” and “Do or Die” were all great tracks. And The Connection, while conceptually flawed, certainly has its highlights. “Still Swingin’” sounds surprisingly good, while “Where Did the Angels Go” recalls the days of Infest, just minus the rap. Despite his growing age, Jacoby Shaddix can still put a lot of traditional metal vocalists to shame. I’ve seen him live; the dude can wail.\n\nAnother interesting case is Three Days Grace. One of the heaviest mainstream bands when their debut came out in 2003, these Canadians proved that Nickelback was not the only hard rock band to come out of Canada in the 90’s. The eponymous debut featured some pure nu metal: heavy chords and unoriginal but evocative lyrics pervaded songs like “I Hate Everything About You,” “Just Like You,” and “Wake Up.” Their follow-up increased the levels of musicianship but slightly lowered the levels of hate expressed in the lyrical content, which received a lot of mixed reactions in the nu metal community.\n\nBut I find their new sound extremely satisfying. One-X is one of my favorite albums: it packs a huge punch, with hard rockers like “Riot” and “Animal I Have Become,” both of which have more of a party vibe than anything on Three Days Grace. Their most recent (and last with former lead singer Adam Gontier) was last year’s Transit of Venus, which was one of the most experimental albums I’ve heard from a band like this. Mixing in distortion, covering Michael Jackson’s “Give In to Me,” brilliantly I might add, and incorporating numerous string arrangements allowed Three Days Grace to expand their sound and make their songs a little more accessible to the general public. I’m gonna go out on a limb and admit it: I think Transit of Venus is, musically and lyrically, their best record. And it did not fully abandon that nu metal edge that gave their music grit.\n\nNu metal is, unsurprisingly, not on the top of the charts anymore. Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, and, yes, even Korn, still top the charts on new release dates, but the albums usually fall out of the top ten almost instantly. But is this really nu metal’s fault? Album sales, especially for anything related to classic guitar-based rock, have tumbled in the last decade. Men like Springsteen and bands like Pearl Jam can’t hold on to #1 for more than a week now. The best “rock” bands out there now are Mumford & Sons and Imagine Dragons, and I don’t think they qualify as “rock”.\n\nBut that’s the world we live in now, sadly. Guitar bands have largely fallen off the face of the planet, only to be replaced by pop stars and rappers. Is nu metal the cause of this decay in rock? This author says.. Probably. But you can’t just blame nu metal: blame the rock bands that stood against the nu metal wave, like Creed and Nickelback. No band since Guns N’ Roses has so creatively improved upon the soundscape of rock ‘n’ roll, aside from Nirvana and the advent of grunge. But I support the existence of nu metal: it provided a new escape for fans of a particular mindset and that, my fiends, is why I like it.. Stay classy!"
