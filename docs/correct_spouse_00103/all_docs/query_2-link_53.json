        "text": "It was so heartwarming to hear from so many ’01s for this column. I asked classmates to share their go-to sources for book recommendations. I was inspired by a text chain among Debra (Brodsky) Shigley, Suzanne (DeVries) Decker, and me in which Suze and Debra often volley around recently read books and authors. I sit on the sidelines of these conversations as I have very different taste in books (I’m looking at you, dense nonfiction) but still delight when this happens as I gain insights not only about potential reads but everything else going on in their worlds. I hope there are lots of similar text chains simmering among our classmates.\n\nThere were lots of fun responses to this prompt connecting back to some of our most prolific ’01 authors. Katie (Reichardt) Bishop wrote in of her writing experience to say, “It’s been a fun ride hearing about how The Best Seller novel has positively impacted readers in their jobs and relationships. I’m thrilled that the book consistently ranks favorably in ‘Business Mentoring & Coaching’ among the books on Amazon!” Rachel Richardson’s third book, Smother, is forthcoming from W.W. Norton in January 2025. She explained, “The book is about living through the middle years of motherhood under the near-constant smoke of the West’s catastrophic wildfires. But it’s not all bleak—I also have several love poems in the book, addressed to my female friends and to the power of friendship overall as a way to carry on. Two of them are dedicated to Nomi Stone ’03 and Giulia Good Stefani (and you’ll catch a little bit of Dartmouth lore in them too), but they stand more broadly for all of my formative Dartmouth friendships—I feel so grateful for the mutual support they’ve provided through these intense midlife years.” Tara Dairman shared that her latest children’s novel, The Girl from Earth’s End, was recently named to the Vermont Golden Dome Book Awards list and is a finalist for the Colorado Book Award. She recommended reading the work of Ann Braden and Minh Le. Allison (Murray) Brennan said she read one of Tara’s other books, Desert Girl, Monsoon Boy, to her pre-K class for Earth Day. Dean Krishna seconded Tara’s recommendation, noting that his kids love Minh’s Let Me Finish! The good news for all of those Minh Le fans is that he has a new book coming out! Built to Last is Minh’s 10th children’s book and his fourth collaboration with National Book Award winner Dan Santat. To round things out, Ale Checka wrote in recommending three of the authors mentioned here: Rachel, Tara, and Minh.\n\nKeep reading, writing, and supporting our ’01 authors!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy spring, ’01s! So much to share this month so we will dive right in.\n\nAfter spending four years as senior corporate counsel at Curia Global, Leah Threatte is switching industries to join MVP Health as legal affairs counsel.\n\nRandy Choniere and his wife are moving back to Chicago after seven years away.\n\nLast July Gene Long and his wife welcomed their first child, a daughter named Clara Marie Long.\n\nRicky Joshi and his wife, Morgan, also welcomed a daughter, named Arielle Asha Joshi. Ricky sees some Dartmouth spirit in Arielle given her love of the outdoors and long walks in the Austin, Texas, Hill Country.\n\nJane Parkin Kullman and her family were recently in Hanover for a quick visit, hitting up a basketball game as well as Lou’s, Ramunto’s, and the Hood Museum.\n\nFinally, Andy Pease wrote in with a lovely connection from his current world back to his school days, so I am including the whole thing here. Andy shared, “I’m still living with my family (wife Lisa, kids Ben and Maya, 8 and 5) in Oneonta, New York, where I’m the band director at Hartwick College. I’ve stayed in touch with some of the musical goings-on at Dartmouth, particularly the Dartmouth Wind Ensemble and its director, Brian Messier. This ensemble played a huge part in my entire Dartmouth experience—I played trumpet with them and the Marching Band for all four years. It just played at the CBDNA (College Band Directors National Association) Eastern Division conference in Ithaca, New York, this weekend, and I was tapped to introduce them at their concert. I took the opportunity to highlight the amazing Mexican Repertoire Initiative the ensemble is doing to eulogize the recently departed band director from our years, Max Culpepper, and to shout ‘Go Big Green!’ into a microphone in Cornell’s concert hall. The band sounded incredible, and I was pleased to see that today’s students still have incredible opportunities to learn and grow through music.”\n\nHere’s hoping that our ’01 community continues to learn and grow doing what we love and continue to pass these things down to future generations.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nWe have two great 2001 updates for this cycle. This summer, Jennifer (Tlumak) Westerholm was promoted to assistant director of the Metro Nashville Government Department of General Services. She directs the sustainability division, helping make municipal buildings, vehicles, and operations more environmentally friendly. She enjoys living and working in her hometown, practicing cartwheels with her 4-year-old, losing running races to her 7-year-old, and doing life with her husband, Pete.\n\nSope Ogunyemi wrote in with an update so rich with information that I am including it with just a little light editing. Thanks, Sope, and take it away: “It has certainly been a rollercoaster summer—year? decade?—and the only way we’ve been able to get through it has been with lots of help from family and friends, including those from Dartmouth! First family updates: On July 7, 2023, Hilary Prentice and Bart Blackburn ’06, who got married last year, welcomed a baby boy, Tice Blackburn—little brother to Beckett! Lots of proud Dartmouth aunties, including Hilary’s sisters, Amanda Prentice ’06 and Julie Prentice ’09 (all fourth-gen Dartmouth alums!), plus Margaret Lee and Jeet Sohal, who hosted a baby shower for Hilary and Bart at Margaret’s home in Los Angeles. It was a beautiful way to kick off the summer with lots of family and friends in attendance, including Kelly Fisher, Melissa Miranda, and Lubna Ammar, who traveled down from the Bay Area to attend and celebrate Melissa’s birthday, as well as Sylvia Kinderman, her husband Chase Dorkey ’99, and lots of everyone’s kids. Most of us were also in attendance at last year’s wedding, and it was a wonderful reunion! Later in the summer I did a bit of traveling and while in Portugal on the African Lisbon tour, I was thrilled to meet a Dartmouth alum, the incomparable Jennifer Leigh Warren ’77. We had a blast and plan to reconnect this fall when we’re both back in Los Angeles. We also both highly recommend the Naky’s African Lisbon tour if you find yourself in Lisbon. It reminded me that earlier this year I moderated a panel at University of Southern California Forward Summit on emerging disruptions in entertainment and was similarly thrilled to find a Dartmouth alum, Ash Cook ’18, was on the panel as well.”\n\nHave a great start to the year, ’01s!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy fall, ’01s! Leslie Orne has been named the chief executive officer of Trinity Life Sciences, a global life sciences commercialization solutions company. Scott Harrison has not just a new job but an entirely new career. After more than 20 years in finance, he is joining the math faculty at Byram Hills High School. After participating in a jumpstart program at Manhattanville College in January, he will have his teaching certification by the end of the year and is excited to be joining his wife, Alissa Harrison, in the field of education. Scott and Alissa continue to live in Bedford, New York, with their two middle school-aged boys.\n\nThe string of ’01 authors continues! Emmett Hogan recently self-published an ebook, Same-Sex Marriages in the European Union: A Guidebook. In addition to covering the law, Emmett reflects on his educational experiences at Dartmouth and the University of Michigan School of Law. The book is available on various platforms including Kindle, Nook, and Apple Books.\n\nI am guessing that many of you have had the shared experience of being on text or email chains trying to figure out when to organize a dinner, party, or trip with a group of ’01 friends. Sometimes they come to fruition and sometimes they don’t. On the flipside, last weekend Joe Sondheimer and I were at an impromptu New York City gathering replete with Dartmouth friends, including Suzanne (deVries) Decker, Julie (Calderon) Rizzo, Debbie (Bernstein) Foster, Alexis (Vagianos) Siegel, Miriam Ingber, Peter Vassilev ’00, Julia Levy ’02, and Alex Wilson. It is always nice to know that ’01s will take planes, trains, and automobiles to support each other at the last minute.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nGreetings, ’01s! Some great news to share this month in the world of publishing and entertainment.\n\nRochelle Bourgault is living in Portland, Maine, and started a new job as a curriculum writer for Sounds True, a digital learning company that specializes in wisdom and spirituality. As she says, “The work is such a sweet spot: I get to write about mindfulness, meditation, conscious business, breathwork, and so many other healing practices.” Her work in online course creation has featured fellow Dartmouth alums Jack Kornfield ’67 and Belinda Chiu ’98. Rochelle was also happy to catch up with Kascha (Semon) and John Snavely while on vacation near San Diego.\n\nIn other writing news, professor emeritus Andrew Garrod and Robert Kilkenny recently coauthored a book, Black Matters: African American and African College Students and Graduates Tell Their Life Stories, with Anthony Luckett as one of the contributors.\n\nBen Mandelker wrote in with exciting updates: “The podcast I co-host, Watch What Crappens, has just signed with Wondery/Amazon Music, and, according to Forbes, in 2022 was the most downloaded podcast in the country for women across all categories (which, quite frankly, is bonkers).” Ben also shared that he is on tour and has been thrilled to see Dartmouth friends while on the road. Sylvia Kindermann, Case Dorkey ’99, and Judy Huang came out to the Los Angeles show; Aseem Gandhi and Isaac Berniker joined in San Francisco; Sam Short ’02 made it to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Jane Parkin is going to try to make it to Boston.\n\nFinally, congratulations to Mindy Kaling for receiving a National Medal of Arts from President Joseph Biden in March. Mindy was cited as “giving voice to a new generation of storytellers.” We are so proud of all our amazing classmates!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy 2023, ’01 family. It is wonderful to hear that so many of you are seeing each other these days, with the latter half of 2022 including many ’01 nuptials. Ricky Joshi married Morgan Birch (Cal State ’11) at a beautiful multi-day wedding in Scottsdale, Arizona. Close to 25 Dartmouth alums celebrated with the happy couple, including Jim Willett, Eric Bussey, Tom Allason ’02, Chad Silverman ’02, Ross Johnson ’02, Rishi Kapur, Ed Yip ’04, and Matt Meehan ’04! Ricky is the cofounder of the bedroom brand Saatva (and has been opening locations across the country, including a new one in Boston) and Morgan is a program manager at Google. They reside in Austin, Texas. In July Evelyn Chen went to Banff, Canada, to celebrate Hsin Lin’s wedding to Troy TenEyck, along with Bernette Tsai, Candice Ling, and Wendy Yu ’02. Then in August Evelyn headed to Tuscany, Italy, for love, wine, and gelato at the wedding of Karin Goodfellow and Peter Tsapatsaris. Bruno Carvalho ’04, Janine Denny ’02, Andrea Haffty ’02, Minh Le, Kelly Fisher, Melissa Miranda, Arthi Reddy, Rachel Richardson, Michael Rozas ’02, Roshan Shah,and Anila Thomas joined in the Italian celebration. While in Siena, Italy, for the Palio horse race, Evelyn met Jolie Kemp ’21, who asked what it was like at the College—when she was born! Tommy Levi married Melissa Gurat in Vancouver, Canada, with Dave Castleman, Brian Nealon, and Amanda Herring ’02 in attendance. James Sitar wrote in with two exciting pieces of news: “I got married on October 8! My remarkable wife, Molly Gilles, is a UW-Madison grad. Some fellow Dartmouth alums helped us celebrate, including Ben DeWitte ’02, Brad Sturges ’02, Angela Russo, and Mike Vidmar ’04. And in the first year of the pandemic I started my own publishing company devoted to the game of golf. It’s called Back Nine Press, and I’ve just published my fourth book: a children’s book about golf by television commentator Shane Bacon. People can learn more and order our hardcover books at www.back9press.com.”\n\nIn other news, after 17 years teaching at Edgemont Jr./Sr. High School, Alisa Harrison joined the math department at Scarsdale High School this fall. She encouraged any alumni living in Scarsdale to reach out! Finally, I promised Erich Shigley ’99, Th’00, that I would mention the recent trip that he, Debra (Brodsky) Shigley, Joe Sondheimer, and I took to the Orlando, Florida, area with our combined four children. Rollercoasters were ridden, spells were cast, Mickey ice creams were consumed, and the kids had fun too. Cheers to a wonderful 2023 filled with continuing ’01 adventures!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy holidays, ’01ers. With the year coming to an end, I thought it would be nice to highlight some classmates helping to better communities large and small. Bayard Russell is using his work from home day at Google to volunteer at a food bank in Brooklyn. Jacqueline Dresow is spending a lot of time helping out with youth soccer. She started coaching her 7-year-old Taylie’s team, is moving to coach her 4-year-old Keia’s team, and hopes to one day coach a team for her youngest child, Cody.\n\nTwo classmates have new books out. Writing under the name “Jack Lutz,” John Lutz had his debut novel, London in Black, published by Pushkin Press this past summer. John describes the book as a dystopian novel set in London, where he has been living with Emily Nytko-Lutz since 2010. Shazia Omar’s children’s novel, Sun Moon Secret, was published by Guba Press this past spring. Set in the Bay of Bengal, the book tells the story of twin sisters who must learn to use their inner powers to save their village.\n\nAfter 15 years working in Minnesota state government agency leadership, Dan Pollack is moving into the private sector in the government relations practice at Lockridge, Grindal & Nauen in Minneapolis. Jesse Foote and Beth Huston ’02 and their kids are relocating to Malaga, Spain, for the 2022-23 school year. They are excited to welcome visitors.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nWe made it to summer, and I hope that many of you have been able to visit with fellow ’01s you may not have seen in a while. Joe Sondheimer and I have enjoyed getting to see and celebrate with classmates during the past few months. We took our kids, Sasha (11) and Simon (9), down to Birmingham, Alabama, to celebrate the bat mitzvah of Violet Levine, daughter of Bob Levine and Emily (Hess) Levine ’05. It was a multigenerational Dartmouth crowd with Donald Hess ’70, George LeMaistre Jr. ’70, Doug Turner, Tu’94, and KevinGoldman ’00 and his wife, Sasha, taking part in the festivities. We also caught up with Suzanne (DeVries) Decker and her husband, Adam, this winter. In addition to her real estate practice at Fried Frank, Suze and Adam recently started a commissary kitchen for short-term rentals called Hudson Valley Beta Kitchen (HVBK, www.hvbetakitchen.com). Located in Croton on Hudson, New York, HVBK provides fully licensed kitchen space for caterers, bakers, and other food makers who have outgrown their home kitchens. There was a New York Times crossword puzzle clue about How I Met Your Mother’s “Bro Code,” not that long ago, prompting me to check in with Matt Kuhn. He is happy to report that Doogie Kamealoha, M.D., for which he is an executive producer and writer, was recently renewed by Disney+ for a second season. Matt will be in Hawaii for filming this summer with new episodes expected to air this fall.\n\nMeredith (Rubin) Slawe wrote in about recently joining the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in New York, where she is a partner specializing in the defense of class actions and mass arbitration. Meredith and her husband, Daniel Slawe, were excited to celebrate the bar mitzvah of Billy, the oldest of their four children, this spring. Congratulations are in order for Jim Noonan, who had his first book published this past April. Professor Figgy’s Weather and Climate Science Lab for Kids is full of science projects for the whole family. To learn more about Professor Figgy (hint: it’s Jim!) and his line of science kits, visit www.ProfessorFiggy.com. Finally, Kevin Stanhope (widowed)recently proposed to Stephanie Roy, his girlfriend of more than two years. While no wedding date has been set, they are looking forward to their household of four, with each of them bringing a boy in their blended family in Kevin’s home state of Maine. Congratulations to all!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy almost spring, fellow ’01s! The class of 2001 baby boom continues. Robin Levine and her husband, Jonathan Cook, welcomed son Eli Solomon Cook-Levine in December. We are told that little Eli looks a lot like his dad but has his mom’s eyes. The whole family is looking forward to a winter filled with long strolls down Laguna Beach in California. Abby Gillard and her wife, Mary Grefe, welcomed baby Margaret “Maggie” Marie in early September. She joins big sister Mary, 2.\n\nShazia Omar wrote in from Dhaka, Bangladesh, where she is still writing and exploring yoga. She recently edited a new anthology, Golden: Bangladesh at 50, to celebrate the country’s 50th anniversary.\n\nFinally, since Josh Crowfoot wrote in with his first ever class update, I am happy to quote him directly. He reported, “I’m living in Chattanooga, Tennessee, working as a commercial real estate attorney for Daspin & Aument LLP. Chattanooga has a lot of the beauty of the woods and mountains of New Hampshire! I live there with my wife, Randi, and two kids, Eloise (2) and Jack (3). I was bummed the ’01 class reunion got canceled this past summer (always a good time!). For the latter part of 2021 I was able to attend a few Zoom calls with fellow ’01s Jorge Miranda, Aki Naito, Kaili Temple, Pam Lombardi, and Joe McKnight to get my Dartmouth fix. Good conversation and adult beverages were had! Also, Aki gave birth to her first child, daughter Yuna Miel Naito Westin, on October 28, which was wonderful baby news! If any ’01s are down Tennessee-way, give me a shout.”\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy 2022, fellow ’01s! We have a lot of news to share so let’s get to it. Mateusz Troicki and his family of five embarked on a nine-week cross-country road trip during the summer. Mateusz and crew traveled more than 14,000 miles across 28 states and more than a dozen national parks…and of course fit in a visit with fellow alum Jacques Dorcé while in California. Christopher Taylor is sharing the wonderful news of a clean bill of health after being diagnosed with stage IV melanoma in 2020 and subsequently undergoing brain and lung surgeries, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. He is grateful for every day and recently celebrated his recovery by running a half marathon. Well done.\n\nWe seem to be in the midst of another class of 2001 baby boom.\n\nJacqueline Dresow and her husband, Marc Cooperstein, welcomed their third child, Cody, who joins big sisters Taylie (6) and Keia (3) in Costa Mesa, California.\n\nAndrew Natan Trief and his wife, Samantha (George Washington University ’11), this October welcomed a daughter, Maayan, who joins big brother Rafael (3). Andrew is taking a step back from work to be a full-time dad and is loving all of the new experiences that come along with this new role.\n\nFinally, we have Gretchen (Bell) Biggins and her husband, Tom, who welcomed their eighth child, Isabel Mary, this past April. Gretchen reports that, “Life in the Biggins house is busy, crazy, loud, and full of love!” Congratulations to all!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy fall, ’01s! I am writing this the weekend after what would have been our 20th reunion. I hope that many of you were able to get together with Dartmouth friends at some point during the summer or are making plans for the coming months. A gaggle of ’01 families got together in Westport, Connecticut, in June, including Miriam Ingber and Peter Vassilev ’00, Suzanne (DeVries) Decker and Adam Decker, Alissa (Abbey) Stoltz and Don Stoltz, and Joe Sondheimer and me—and all our combined kids, 10 in total, who really didn’t want to listen to any of us talk about our time in Hanover. I hope your gatherings allow for a little more nostalgia!\n\nIn other news, Jeff Dutremble recently welcomed his second daughter, Quinn, who joins big sister Aria, 3. Another big arrival is his first book, Find a Lost Smile. The book, which was published this summer, is about following your heart despite pressure to conform. Catherine N. Montoya defended her dissertation this spring after a challenging year of working full-time from home and managing three kids through remote learning. She finished up her doctorate in educational leadership as the first graduate in the inaugural cohort of the University of New Mexico Native American Leadership in Education program. Finally, Miena Meek Hall recently completed her residency in family medicine and is beginning her practice in Hinsdale, Illinois. She is also part of the inaugural class of the Leadership Academy of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine. Congratulations to everyone!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nSay hello to summer, ’01s! Our class continues to be busy despite this strange year. Dean Krishna was recently elected as a partner in the law firm of Stradley Ronan. Dean focuses on tax issues and is based in Philadelphia. Sean Alpert married Emily Stoler (Tulane ’05) in a small ceremony in Alexandra, Virginia, this past November. The couple welcomed their daughter, Maya Clementine, in February and have high hopes for her as a prospective class of ’39. On the professional front, Sean has been working in marketing for Salesforce for 10 years. Kate (Sherwin) Edwards and her husband, Beau, also welcomed their first daughter, Elizabeth Joan, this past November. Kate, Beau, and Elizabeth live in Austin, Texas. Congratulations to all of these new pandemic parents!\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be gathering in Hanover for our 20th reunion this June, but it is still a great time to reflect on what we have done during the last two decades. We have built careers and reinvented ourselves. We have struggled and persevered. Sometimes we decided to go it alone and at other times we leaned on those closest to us. We have experienced love and profound joy, experienced parenthood, and, sadly, have been forced to say goodbye to friends, family members, and classmates. Through it all, we have had each other, and for that we can always be grateful. Cheers to our ’01 family. We will gather together to share it all another day.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello spring, ’01s! For this column, classmates reflected on how they have contributed to their communities during the past year. It is wonderful to hear about what people are doing to help improve the world around them. Courtney Henning Novak was struggling to manage distance learning for her second-grader but found an outlet for this angst that could help others. She published The Distance Learning Activity Book for Parents Just Holding On to Their Last Shred of Sanity. It is available on Amazon and can provide some light-hearted tips and distractions as parents try to close out what feels like the longest school year on record.\n\nIn the world of medicine, Ali Rashid described his year as the vice chief of the anesthesiology department in his Florida hospital. In addition to the routine management, this year was filled with new challenges such as allocation of personal protective equipment and creative usage of space for increased numbers of patients. Ali also pitched in with the ICU when possible. This rollercoaster of a year ended with Ali receiving the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Reflecting on all that has happened, Ali remarked that what stands out to him most about 2020 is “the uncertainty of every day in contrast to the certainty to our commitment.” These are great words for our ’01 family. None of us can claim to know what the spring will be like, but members of the 2001 class will tackle whatever comes our way with hard work, perspective, and good humor.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy new year, ’01 family. We finally made it to 2021, meaning that our 20th reunion is this coming June. Start making your plans to return to Hanover…or to change the whole trip in the event that it gets delayed due to the pandemic. Most of us should have experience with that at this point. I will keep my fingers and toes crossed that many of us will gather in Hanover in a few short months. In the meantime, a few updates to tide you over.\n\nThose working in entertaining and the arts have found new and increasing audiences. Ben Mandelker seems to be thriving with us all holed up in our homes as his cohosted podcast has been reaching new heights of more than 3 million hits per month. He and his cohost were also guests on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in September. Andy Pease wrote in to exclaim, “I have an album coming out!” Andy conducted the Hartwick College Faculty Wind Octet on the album, Stravinsky: Alone No More, in September 2019 and the digital release should be out now on the digital platform of your choice. The album includes a piece from fellow alum Oliver Caplan ’04. Given that the editing process was almost completely derailed by the pandemic, Andy’s 2021 resolution is to take some time off.\n\nPavan Nihalani wrote in from Dubai to celebrate the birth of his daughter, Lila Doshi, who was born in July. Her older brother, Bodhi, is reportedly “skeptical” of the new addition as of this writing.\n\nFinally, it is with a heavy heart that I report the passing of Naomi (Kim) McWilliams in September. She is survived by her husband, Scott, and son, Benjamin, 10. We are keeping this part of the ’01 family in our thoughts.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01 family. How is it already November? How is it only November? Regardless of which camp you fall into, it is a great time to pause and reflect on all that has happened in a single year and to make sure that we take stock of all that we have to be thankful for. We have some ’01s doing wonderful things in various communities. Jessica (Wirth) Strine is serving as a trustee to Tyler Arboretum. With more than 600 acres of wide-open space, it is a wonderful place for families to connect with nature (while keeping their distance) in the Philadelphia suburbs. On the professional front, after almost two decades in institutional investment management, Jessica launched a corporate advisory firm that helps public companies navigate environmental, social, and governance issues that matter to their investors. You can check out her work at www.sgpgovernance.com. Bradford McKeown is serving on the board of nonprofit Carpe Mundi, which provides mentorship and a cohort-based study abroad experience for disadvantaged Portland, Oregon, college students. Carpe Mundi was founded by Hansell (Bourdon) Woods ’02, who served as its first executive director.\n\nOur ’01 authors are as prolific as ever. Daniel Davey Stulac’s second book, Life, Land, and Elijah in the Book of Kings, will be published this December. Also arriving this fall is Daniel and Danielle Davey Stulac’s second daughter, who will be little sister to Abigail, 18 months. Tara Dairman’s first picture book, Desert Girl, Monsoon Boy, was published by Putnam/Penguin Random House in May. Tara also reported that she and her husband, Andy Cahill, and their two children have been living in an RV full-time since May of 2019, traveling around the United States and Canada. This past summer they were able to have some socially distanced catch-ups with Christine Percheski in Illinois, Jennifer Tlumak Westerholm in Kentucky, Sabrina Hepburn in Colorado, and Anna Rudberg Speiser in Nebraska. Quang Trong recently wrote a book, Composite Architecture, which discusses the history, technology, opportunities, and challenges surrounding composite materials such as carbon fibers.\n\nIn other news, Matt Shaffer and his family recently moved to Denver, where he is continuing his private mental health counseling practice and enjoying the outdoors. Anna Bammi is living in Washington, D.C., and has studied Montessori pedagogy as an early childhood educator.\n\nFinally, with a heavy heart, Kate (Mattern) McGee, with her husband, Conner ’02, son Jamie, 8, and daughters Alex, 7, and Casey, 5, wrote in to share the death of her son, Lukey, in a car accident just prior to turning 2 years old this past December. Donations in Lukey’s memory can be made to his preschool, the New Canaan Nature Center, at https://newcanaannature.org/thank-you. The ’01 family is holding you in our hearts.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01 family. As I write this in June, I truly have no idea what September will be looking like. Wherever you are, whatever you are doing, I hope that you and yours are healthy, safe, and enjoying each other’s company. Even though everyone is still pretty cooped up in late June, our ’01 family remains busy. Chance Hill is enjoying his time as one of nine elected University of Colorado regents overseeing the college system. He got married in December, and he and his wife, Nicole, were able to honeymoon in Jamaica before the lockdowns. If you are looking for something to read this fall, we have another class author in our midst. Aaron B. Wilkinson’s book, Blurring the Lines of Race and Freedom, will be published by the University of North Carolina Press this fall.\n\nWe have some ’01s taking on some new jobs. After 13 years at Nixon Peabody, Leah Threatte is now corporate counsel for AMRI, a research and manufacturing organization. Joe McKnight recently took a management role on Amgen’s cardiovascular marketing team and is looking to relocate to either Connecticut or California. Ricky Joshi cofounded Saatva, a luxury, direct-to-consumer mattress company that is one of the fastest growing e-commerce brands ever.\n\nKelly (Keene) Horst, her husband, Adam ’00, and their three children recently moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where the adults will take on roles at the Mayo Clinic. Kelly will join the faculty in the department of radiology. She was also recently recognized by the Indiana High School Cross Country Hall of Fame. Congratulations to all of these great ’01s!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-6938; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01 family. I hope you are all well and spending this summer outside after a very long spring.\n\nAbby Gillard wrote in with some great news. She and her wife, Lisa Grefe, welcomed their daughter, Mary, into the world this spring. Little Mary has already traveled from her home in Iowa to visit Hanover. Abby and family got to catch up there with Katie Gayman and Caleb Moore and their family. Pre-baby and pre-travel prohibitions, Abby and Lisa went to the finals of the Women’s World Cup in France and also met up with Mary McVeigh ’03 and Erin Osborn ’05.\n\nThe ’01 class officers have been busy creating some great opportunities to get together. Make sure to follow the 2001 Facebook account as well as the new Instagram account. You will find information about ’01 gatherings, including virtual happy hours. Another great new initiative is an online book club highlighting ’01 authors and ’01-related content via Goodreads. By the time of this printing, the book club will have probably finished up All Four Stars by Tara Dairman and will be working on The Benefits of Being an Octopus by Ann Braden.\n\nEither there is not much going on in the ’01 universe or everyone is too inundated with emails and Zoom meetings to spend any more time in front of their computers to send updates. My guess is probably a little bit of both. Here’s to hoping that some of your Zoom meetings involved catching up with some old Dartmouth friends.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01 family. I hope you are all enjoying a wonderful spring. A lot of goings-on in California this winter. Before the weather turned warm Evelyn Chen spent a week skiing at Lake Tahoe, where she met up with Bernette Tsai, Andy Kim, Masashi Kiyomine, and Wendy Yu ’02. The snow was not great but the company made it well worth the trip. Matt Kuhn, his wife, Alecia, and their lovely daughter, Edie, 3, welcomed little brother Albert “Albie” Milo to the world in January. Albie arrived at an opportune time, as Matt recently wrapped the sixth and final season of Fresh Off the Boat, a network comedy series that he was co-showrunning for the last two seasons. Also in Los Angeles, Jenny Alden and Kirk Spahn ’99 welcomed their second son, Axton Ellis. On hand to great little Axton were big brother Alden Charles, 3, and new puppy Flash.\n\nNot everyone is in L.A., though. Shazia Omar is running yoga retreats around the world; Spain in March and Thailand in October. Her first novel, Like a Diamond in the Sky, was recently rereleased for its 10th anniversary. Abraham Mahshie is on the move again. When we last heard from Abraham, he was in a cabin in North Carolina writing about Spanish bullfighters. He has since spent four months following Donald Trump around Mar-a-Lago as a political reporter and is now in Washington, D.C., covering the Pentagon and trying to figure out how it all fits together. Marcella Gift shifted from her career in finance to start a business, a footwear line called Emme Cadeau. Her goal was to create a shoe line that was comfortable, colorful, and had lots of charisma. Her shoes were used by Andy Hilfiger in his New York Fashion Week show last September and have been worn by Wendy Williams on her show many times.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nGreetings, ’01 family. In the spirit of brutal honesty, I completely forgot about writing this column until a few hours ago. It is due tomorrow. My family and I are on vacation. I left my computer at home. We were in a car driving from San Francisco to visit family in Napa when Joe Sondheimer innocently called out from the backseat, “Hey, Rach, this calendar alert says you have a Dartmouth Notes column due tomorrow.” I am usually on top of things, but this one slipped through the cracks. So now I am sitting in our hotel lounge with a borrowed computer, getting it done. All I can say is thank goodness for Google Calendar, Netflix to occupy the kids, and some of you for sending me updates after the last issue’s October deadline. It takes a village.\n\nEmily Nytko-Lutz and John Lutz are currently (or at least as of October) living in London and “recently” welcomed their first baby, Mia Catherine Lutz. Peter Leckerling and his wife, Yaqing, had their second daughter, Mina Yaqing Leckerling, in September. Mina is named after a student Peter and his brother taught during their time volunteering in Nangi, Nepal, the summer after Peter’s junior year at Dartmouth. Mina, whose name roughly translates to “jewel,” was introduced to a trio of Dartmouth alums, Imani Payne ’99, Nahoko Kawakyu-O’Connor ’99, and Don Kawakyu-O’Connor ’98, in utero and is now looking forward to meeting many more.\n\nMichelle Chui and her husband, Justin Sarma, were honored to attend the New York City wedding of Tim Waligore and Katie Unger. It was a Dartmouth-heavy crowd, with Athena Waligore, Laura (Dellatorre) Basford ’03, Richard Jay Nussbaum ’03, Alice Keefe ’80, and Bill Keefe ’76 also in attendance. Michelle hopes that Tim and Laura “live long and prosper.” Also spotted on the streets of New York: Miriam Ingber, Peter Vassilev ’00, and Tammy (Gargas) and Pete Ferris met up in Central Park to carbo load with Hamilton (Fryer) Reavey and Kevin Reavey ’02 before Hamilton ran the New York City Marathon the next day. There is little doubt that this group, along with their combined eight children in tow, downed a lot of pasta to get Hamilton ready for the big race.\n\nI can derive at least two morals from this tale of close deadlines: Set calendar alerts; and please send me updates, even if you think it is too late!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel. sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy 2020, ’01 family. For this column I asked people to share their new endeavors for 2020. Andrea Glover Paez wrote in to say that she and her husband, Jason, became parents with the birth of their son, Xavier Malcolm Douglas Paez, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Tom Campbell started a new job with Amazon, helping to build drones, and moved out of a floating home on Lake Union onto stable land in Fremont, Washington. Welcome to dry land, Tom. Rochelle Bourgault wrote that after years of wishing to be back in her home state, her family of four moved to Portland, Maine, this past summer. They are acclimating well to the abundance of good food and coffee, a lovely farmers’ market, and being in a beautifully walkable city. Tara Dairman and Andy Cahill visited in August, and all their kids loved playing together, taking wagon rides in the garden, and eating their weight in Holy Donuts. (Author’s note: I recently had one of these Maine potato donuts and they are, indeed, delicious.) Although this is not quite a new activity, I promised Miriam Ingber to report that Miriam and I—along with her husband, Peter Vassilev ’00; my husband, Joe Sondheimer; Suzanne (DeVries) Decker and her husband, Adam; and Alissa (Abbey) Stoltz—managed to have dinner together without our combined 10 children on a lovely night in September. These types of reunions can be done. Try it and report back for the next issue!\n\nFor our last column I asked you to write in with some of your community endeavors and the responses keep coming in. Katie (Reichardt) Bishop, her husband, Jim, and their two sons, Ben (10) and Jason (8), recently traveled to Juarez, Mexico, to build homes alongside the locals, providing solid foundations, walls, and roofs for families in need. Katie also volunteers for Reading Partners locally in Denver and has been a mentor and speaker to various young women’s groups in the area. Katie also shared some exciting personal news. Paceline Power, a book she coauthored with her dad, will be published and available for your reading pleasure in the coming months. It is a business book written in novel form with a cycling theme about the importance and power of your relationships. Check it out at www.PacelinePower.com.\n\nAs part of the “Call to Lead,” Dartmouth undertook the “Call to Serve” this past year. Evelyn Chen, our Alumni Council representative, says that ’01s logged more than 400 service hours, contributing to Dartmouth’s goal of more than 250,000 total hours in 2019. Nice work, everyone, and thanks for helping out with this initiative.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy holidays, ’01 family. Even though the weather is turning colder, we have one last update from the 20th anniversary of our Sophomore Summer. Alisa (Beck) Harrison reported a reunion of DOC trip C-55. (Yes, they apparently still know the number.) Amazingly, half of the original members of this DOC trip got together with their families at the new Moosilauke Ravine Lodge this past summer. Alisa and her husband, Scott Harrison, were joined by Halsey Morris, Jon Mingle, and Betsy Parks-Stamm, along with nine children ranging in age from 2 to 10. A good time was had by all despite thunderstorms thwarting their attempts to summit the peak.\n\nSince we are entering the holiday season, I thought it would be nice to focus on how ’01s are giving back to their communities. Joe McKnight recounted his interactions with Cheeriodicals, a group that provides patients with entertainment kits during hospitalizations. As part of a team-building event with Pfizer’s North American internal medicine marketing team, Joe worked with Cheeriodicals for two days, assembling boxes full of crosswords, coloring books, stuffed animals, and other toys, and then delivered boxes to local hospitals around New York. Finally, Jane Parkin Kullmann shared some of the great community service she is doing with Women of Dartmouth Boston. During the past year they have volunteered at a number of different organizations including a shelter for survivors of domestic violence, an organization that provides professional clothes for women in need, and another group that focuses on providing homeless women with basic necessities. They also held a toiletry drive and are looking forward to continuing these efforts next year.\n\nIt is so great to hear about the work being done by one of our local Dartmouth groups. I am sure there is other inspirational work being performed throughout our alumni community. If you have more to share, please let me know. See you in 2021!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel. sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01s. Even though it is almost fall, we are wrapping up our 20th anniversary of Sophomore Summer series. Pavan Nihalani planned to spend most of his summer in Ecuador, exporting bananas to the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nJane Parkin Kullmann and Karilyn Heisen recreated their Sophomore Summer trip to the Second College Grant a few years back and are broadening their horizons this year to take their families camping at Acadia National Park. It seems like a nice way to celebrate Jane recently completing her Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nFinally, Gretchen (Bell) Biggins and her husband, Tommy (Amherst ’01), spent their summer with their growing family. Gretchen and Tommy are excited to announce the birthday of their seventh child, Robert “Bobby” William Biggins. Big siblings Abigail, Samantha, Tommy, Ben, and Andrew are incredibly in love with the latest addition.\n\nAs one could imagine, their house is decked out with two triple bunks and they drive a 12-passenger airport van full of car seats. Gretchen noted, “Fellow ’01 Jane (Serene) Limmer, husband Bryan, and sons Michael and William joined us for a jaunt in the van when they visited in June; it was wonderful to catch up after too many years apart. I have also run into fellow ’01s Bri Johnson, Katie Gayman, and Caleb Moore on the sports fields in Lexington, Massachusetts, where they all live and where I am coaching high school girls lacrosse.”\n\nCongratulations to all, and hope you can make it to Hanover for Homecoming Weekend in October.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nThere is a lot going on in the ’01 world right now. In addition to many 40th birthday celebrations, people are on the move in all sorts of ways. After winning a 2018 Grammy Award for Bluegrass Album of the Year, Chris Pandolfi is gearing up for a big year with his band, The Infamous Stringdusters. Patrick Burleigh, Jeremy Robin, and Chris O’Connell ’04 recently joined him at the beach in Mexico for Strings & Sol, a music festival featuring the Stringdusters. Matt Shaffer wrote in to say that all is well in Chicago, where he continues to work in private clinical practice in the mental health field. He is staying busy chasing around his 4-year-old daughter, Reba, and gets to see Mike Levy and Jim Sitar from time to time.\n\nWe have some career changes afoot. Bradford McKeown recently started a job at Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor in the firm’s Portland, Oregon, office. Sasha Kraev started a new position as the chair of cardiac, thoracic, and vascular surgery at Billings Clinic in Montana and just had her first child. Paul Biggs has passed the one-year mark in Berlin. Paul reports, “My wife, Paige, and our two boys, Crosby, 4, and Hugo, 1 (and born in Berlin), moved to Germany from Portland, Oregon, last year, and have been enjoying every second of it. I’m working for a software startup based here, and we make it a point to travel somewhere new at least once a month (just got back from Mallorca). While it takes most expats a while to get used to the rampant nudity, especially on the East German side of town, turns out my years of streaking the Green prepared me well for this chapter of life!”\n\nThe ’01 class has a lot going on in the world of academics. Boulat Bash left Raytheon BBN Technologies last spring and moved to the warmer climes of the Southwest to work as an assistant professor at the electrical and computer engineering department in the University of Arizona. Jason Kelly recently took a new job as an assistant professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, after finishing up a postdoc at the Harvard Kennedy School. Jason, his wife, Rebecca, and daughter Abigail are loving their new digs in Jamestown, Rhode Island, right across the bay from Newport, and are spending lots of time outdoors, enjoying the beaches and exploring the local playground circuit: “I am happy to report that I recently wrapped up five weeks serving as the acting dean of the U.S. Military Academy and will be returning to my role as the vice dean for academic affairs at West Point. I am sure that Sylvanus Thayer would be very happy to know that the Dartmouth-U.S. Military Academy connection continues to this day.”\n\nHave a great summer, ’01s near and far!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nIt took a little cajoling but we have some awesome updates for your reading pleasure. A while back, Chance Hill wrote in to say that he was running for a seat on the Colorado University board of regents, representing the state’s 5th congressional district. He won the seat in November, and starts his six-year term in November. In other fantastic follow-up news, Jesse Foote reports that his Kickstarter campaign to develop his treasure hunt game, Color Clues, was a success with participation from many ’01s, including Sean Alpert, Lindsey Anderson, Paul Biggs, Ivan Cestero, Hillary Dunleavy, Maribel Florez, Mike Foote, Dominic Germana, Devon Green, Dean Krishna, Ian Laing, Patrick Leslie, Brooke Lierman, Jorge Miranda, Prince Neelankavil, Jon Potter, Rhea Powell, Kristin Romberg, Roshan Shah,and Margaret Sloat. Take a look at www.colorclues.com. Maybe all the ’01 kids can play at the next reunion.\n\nSpeaking of ’01 kids, there are more of them in this world. Andrew Trief and Samantha Shabman (George Washington ’11) welcomed their first son, Rafael Noah, on October 7 in Atlanta. Splitting time between Atlanta and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Andrew would love to catch up with ’01s passing through the South. Valeria (Guerrero) Lewis, husband Stephen, and son David recently welcomed second child Amelie Maria. Valeria and Stephen also celebrate the second anniversary of their firm, law offices of Lewis and Guerrero in Miami. Costa Mesa, California got a new ’01 baby with little Keia Dresow Cooperstein joining Jacqueline Dresow, Marc Cooperstein, and big sister Taylie (3) in April. Also in California, Jenny Alden reports that she (re)connected with Kirk Spahn ’99—the two parties dispute whether an initial connection was made many years earlier in Hanover—in 2015. This meeting was apparently more memorable with the pair now happily married and parents to a beautiful baby boy. Last, and certainly not least, Jessica Wirth Strine wrote in from Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, to say that she completed her happy family of seven with the birth of Camilla (“Milly”) June Strine last March. In June Jessica pivoted away from portfolio management and took a job with Vanguard.\n\nThe years 2018 and 2019 are a milestone for many a classmate with at least a plurality—perhaps a majority, but I have not crunched the data—of ’01s turning 40. As expected, many of our classmates are celebrating with ’01 friends and exciting adventures. Rochelle Bourgault is embracing the new decade with her husband, who is turning 50, by relocating her family of four from Marblehead, Massachusetts, to Venice, California, for the entire month of February. Some ’01 friends, Amanda (Montgomery) Martin and Melissa (Singh) Merchant, traveled to Boston to join Jenna and Steve Leschuk for Jenna’s 40th celebration. Evelyn Chen is taking these 40th birthdays global. Just before celebrating Bernette Tsai’s 40th in the Bay Area with Andy Kim, Wendy Yu ’02, and Masashi Kiyomine, Evelyn helped organize Equality Now’s 2018 gala in Los Angeles, helping to raise more than $1 million for women’s and girls’ rights. She will be celebrating her own 40th with some skiing in Hokkaido and traveling around Japan in late February through early March.\n\nThanks for the updates everyone. Have a great spring!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel. sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy new year, ’01s! For this set of notes I sent out an email asking what traditions you have maintained with Dartmouth friends since graduation. One type of response dominated all the rest: The class of 2001 continues to have babies. I received eight updates for this column, and six of them involved new children. Two updates involved Meeta Agrawal, but more on that later.\n\nJen Feltner shared a nice tradition that she created with her friends from the fencing team. This crew gets together for Mardi Gras-themed fencing reunions, a tradition that sprang up following Jen’s time living near New Orleans. Far from Louisiana, Jen is studying mountain lions and their competitors (think wolves and grizzly bears) north of Jackson, Wyoming, during her fifth year in a Ph.D. program in wildlife biology at the University of Montana.\n\nA couple of European updates to share. Georges Dyer and his wife are moving to London. He will still be running the Intentional Endowments Network from there and looks forward to connecting with Dartmouth friends in the United Kingdom. Abraham Mahshie is returning to the United States after spending four years in Spain. He is currently writing a travel essay-style book on Spanish bullfighting as well as reporting on crime and the midterm elections for the Macon County News in the Smoky Mountains.\n\nAnd now to those babies. Abby Nova and Tim Wright welcomed Benjamin Fowler Nova-Wright in February. He joins big brother Alex (9). Abby is a partner and producer at Stand Sure Media and Tim recently joined Guggenheim Investments. They recently moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn and were lucky enough to live upstairs from Meeta Agrawal and family. Meeta has the distinction of being mentioned in two independent responses to this request for information. Alka Singal wrote about her whirlwind trip to Mexico City with Sylvia Kindermann and Meeta. Meeta will be starting as the arts and leisure editor at The New York Times. Sylvia and her husband, Case Dorkey ’99, recently had a baby, and it was on Alka’s birthday. So much to celebrate! Andy Pease is an assistant professor of music and director of instrumental music at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York. He and his wife, Lisa Samols (Columbia ’04), recently added to their family with the arrival of Maya Samols Pease in June. Their older son, Ben (3), is currently thrilled to be a big brother but it is unclear if that goodwill will last through the printing of this column. Pavan Nihalani wrote in to report the arrival of Bodhi Doshi Nihalani in New York City in August. An already impressive child, little Bodhi managed to sleep through most of the 13-hour flight back to Dubai when he was just 4 weeks old. Well done. Amar Dhand and Charlene Ong welcomed Daphne Cleopatra Dhand in September and are planning a visit up to Dartmouth soon. Amar also recently had some of his research on social networks in medicine published in Nature Communications. Susan Kown Lee and her husband, David, welcomed daughter Iris Lee to their family in October.\n\nThe ’01 family continues to grow, and based on this non-scientific data collection, will have a 25-percent chance of living near or vacationing with Meeta. I like those odds. Congratulations to all.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy fall, ’01s! You may not be aware, but Connecticut seems to be a hotbed of Dartmouth ’01 activity. Joe Sondheimer and I were happy to host a pool party bringing together lots of Dartmouth friends in the Constitution State. Alissa (Abbey) Stoltz,her husband, Don, and their family moved to Weston about a year ago, and Miriam Ingber, Peter Vassilev ’00, and their children are very recent transports to Westport. We were joined by Kristin Delaney and her daughter as well as Suzanne (deVries) Decker and her sons, who were all willing to cross the New York state line for the afternoon. Debra (Brodsky) Shigley and Erich Shigley ’99 and their kids came down from Boston to join the festivities. Scott and Alisa (Beck) Harrison and their kids also visited Ridgefield for a concert in the park this summer. In other Connecticut news, Alexis (Vagianos) Siegel, Adam Siegel ’00, and their four children have moved from Greenwich to Miami.\n\nIn neighboring New York, Carolyn (Roth) Fiuza and her family departed the Upper West Side for the leafy streets of Bronxville just in time to welcome their second daughter, Isabelle, in June. Juliana, 4, is enjoying her new home and role as a big sister. Rounding out our discussion of the tristate area, Chris Tully and his wife, Lisa (Rutgers ’04), recently moved to new digs in Chatham, New Jersey, and welcomed their third child, Lucas Michael.\n\nFurther north, Rochelle Bourgalt, her husband, James Gotz (Michigan ’91), and their daughter, Margaret, 2, welcomed Benjamin to the family at sunrise on a lovely July morning in Marblehead, Massachusetts. And even closer to that which connects us all, Abby Gillard traveled home to New Hampshire from West Des Moines, Iowa, where she lives with her wife, Lisa. The high point of the trip was a day spent at a lake with Katie Gayman, Bri Johnsen, and Jen (Murray) Talmadge and their kids. They also met up with Bri’s husband, Eric Wang ’02, Riley Lochridge ’02, and Seth Smith ’02, who were on their way back from their annual trip to the Second College Grant. Abby reports, “We were missing a few members of the Dartmouth women’s soccer class of ’01, but it was epic nonetheless!”\n\nIn the Midwest, after many years in the fashion retail industry, Chris Miranda graduated from Ohio University College of Medicine and started his residency in family medicine at Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nHope everyone has a great holiday season, no matter where you are!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nIt has been an extraordinary few months filled with professional and personal triumphs for the class of 2001. First and foremost, give a rouse for our own Mindy Kaling for being selected as Dartmouth’s 2018 Commencement speaker. What an honor! Jesse Foote recently launched a game called Color Clues that lets parents easily set up treasure hunts for their kids. The game uses sequences of colors and audio clues so kids of any age can solve the hunts completely on their own. You can try it out for free at the App Store, and keep an eye out for his Kickstarter campaign to preorder the game box. Mary Barensfeld’s work continues to be published in international and national publications for both architecture and landscape architecture work in the San Francisco and Pittsburgh regions. Check out her recent projects at www.barensfeld.com. A happy one-year anniversary to Erin Dromgoole, who married Paul Rupprecht (University of Maine ’05) around this time last summer. Erin and Paul met through a running club, so it should not be surprising that both running and Dartmouth friends were prominent parts of the event in Windsor, Vermont. Fellow Dartmouth cross-country and track alums Peggy Johnson and Parker Pruett were a part of the ceremony, and Joe McKnight gave a wonderful, heartfelt “man of honor” speech at the reception. Other ’01s in attendance included Terra Beaton, Dave Chalmers, Bill Peter, Alex (Kremer) Marshall, Erika Cafarella, and Handol Khym. Dartmouth cross-country and track and field coach Barry Harwick ’77 even put in an appearance at the ceremony. Michael Friesner recently attended Rob Hallenbeck’s wedding to Lauren Murphy in beautiful Kerrville, Texas. There were many ’01s on hand to celebrate, including Karyn Brudnicki (and her husband, Mark Landis ’97), Eric Bielke, Elliott Freirich, Greg Fournier, Jen Gillcrist (exchange from Wellesley ’00), Nick Dominguez, and Dave Marmaros.\n\nIn parenting news, Adrian Loewing and her husband, Patrick, celebrated the birth of their son, Brayden Patrick Carroll, in February. It sounds like this trio is planning on going places, as little Brayden is already in possession of three passports—from Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We hope that you bring him stateside soon! Jacqueline Dresow wrote in from Costa Mesa, California, to announce the April birth of her second daughter, Keia Dresow Cooperstein. Big sister Taylie (3) is adjusting better than expected. Brooke Lierman and Eben Hansel welcomed their second child, Eliza Hansel, last November. Brooke is completing her first term representing part of the city of Baltimore in the Maryland House of Delegates. Her bid for re-election starts with the primary this summer and includes the much-appreciated support of many classmates. To those just beginning or solidly in the throes of their parenting journey, Todd Jelen is “fairly confident” that he is the first member of the class of 2001 to have a child graduate high school. Todd’s son, Preston, will attend and play football at the University of Minnesota next fall. Congratulations all around!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy spring, ’01s! Anyone remember what you were up to 20 years ago this month? Why celebrating your first Green Key Weekend, of course. Turn that one around in your head for a little while as you read about the activities of your fellow classmates.\n\nWe have ’01s doing some great work in government. Dan Pollack currently serves as the deputy commissioner of health for the State of Minnesota and was excited to report that his new boss, Jan Malcolm ’77, is also a Dartmouth alum. Carrie (Hoverman) Colla moved her family from Hanover to Washington, D.C., to work as a Robert Wood Johnson health policy fellow in Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s office. This endeavor would not have been possible without the love, support and babysitting provided by her husband, Geoff ’04, and parents, Steve ’71 and Nancy. Speaking of D.C. (in name only), Minh Le signed with DC Comics to write a Green Lantern graphic novel as part of its new middle-grade imprint, DC Zoom. (For anyone who is curious, the DC in DC Comics was derived from Detective Comics, not the District of Columbia.)\n\nAs usual, we have ’01s on the move. Kate (Mattern) McGee and her husband, Conner ’02, moved out of New York City to New Canaan, Connecticut, last summer. They are quite grateful to have a bigger home as they ushered their fourth child, Luke, in along with the new year this December 31. He joins big brother Jamie (6) and big sisters Alex (4) and Casey (2). Kate is very excited about the large contingent of Dartmouth alums in the Connecticut suburbs and has become involved in the new Women of Dartmouth of Fairfield County team. Anyone living in the area and interested in getting involved should email the group at women.of.dartmouth.fairfield.county@dartmouth.edu.\n\nIn other baby news, Sena Ku Jaret and her husband, Jeff, welcomed another daughter, Raiyu Ku Saret, into the family in December. Big brother Rylan and big sister Isla are completely enamored. Tom Campbell and his wife, Meghan (Holyoke ’01), welcomed their daughter, Ella, to the world in October. Tom lives in Seattle and recently met up with Aiden Marcuss, a friend from freshman trips. Two decades of friendship! Here’s hoping that many of you are keeping up with those first-year friends!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01s! Not much news to report but what we do have sounds pretty awesome. After spending 18 months living in Hong Kong, Amanda Cook and her husband, Zak Mazeika, are returning to London. They are not flying as one might expect. Instead, they are taking the train or, to be more precise, many trains. They will spend a month moving through China and then take the Trans Siberian train north before heading west across Russia to St. Petersburg. They will then head through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. From there, Amanda and Zak will complete the journey to London on the Eurostar. If you are intrigued, you can follow their journey on AndOurOtherAdventures.com. The plan is travel from January through March, so by the time you check out the website, it should have a lot of good content. Enjoy!\n\nAlso in Great Britain, Jennifer (Gill) Didondi and her husband, Alberto, welcomed their second daughter, Delia, on October 6 in Redding, England. She joins big sister Lucia.\n\nFinally, I have a note from the class of 2001 executive committee. Our class officers are always looking to increase the quality and quantity of how we engage with each other as a class and with Dartmouth. We host a variety of activities and are looking to increase our scope. Last year we sponsored a mini-reunion in Boston as part of the Dartmouth football game at Fenway Park. The executive committee is eager to sponsor similar events in various locations across the country (or anywhere really…the British Isles seem popular) in the coming year. If you are interested in planning or hosting a mini-reunion, please reach out to the executive committee at dartmouthclass2001@gmail.com to get started.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nSeasons’ greetings, ’01s! During the past few months a bunch of people have reminded me that this is the 20th anniversary of our freshman year. Sit and ponder that with a cup of tea while I give you an update on an ’01 couple that met during our DOC trips way back when. Roxanne (Stahl) and Chris O’Hara celebrated the anniversary of their meeting 20 years ago by moving from New York City to New Canaan, Connecticut, getting a puppy named Sadie and welcoming their third child, Samuel, who joins sister Maddie (9) and big brother Jackson (7). In other baby news, Nicholas Kovner and his wife, Georgia, welcome their third child, Nicholas Thomas, this September. He joins big sisters Paige and Savannah.\n\nA lot of ‘01s are going places—literally. Ben Mandelker went on tour. His podcast, “Watch What Crappens,” hit 1.5 million listens per month so he and his cohost celebrated by taking their show on the road to play to sold-out crowds in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. Ben will be coming to N.Y.C.’s legendary Bowery Ballroom this year, so keep an eye out. Madeline (Medeiros) Ruiz took a sabbatical from her art history teaching gig and moved to Madrid, Spain, with her husband, Kially Ruiz ’98, and children Max and Sofia. During their year abroad Maddy plans to write a book on spirituality in art. Peter Leckerling and his family have relocated back to the United States, Chicago to be exact, after living in China for 16 years! He is looking forward to working at a boutique private equity firm and spending more time with his former Tabard roommate Mikah Soliunas. Sarah ’99 and Dominic Germana and their twin sonstraveled from their home in North Carolina up to Hanover for Homecoming. After watching the bonfire and enjoying the festivities, they went to Boston to spend the day with Greg Chittim and his family.\n\nFinally, Tara Dairman recently published her fourth novel for young readers. Published by Wendy Lamb Books/Random House, The Great Hibernation is about a town where all of the adults fall asleep and the kids are left in charge. Sounds like my house on a Sunday afternoon.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy fall, ’01s! We have a lot of ’01s on the move in various ways.\n\nAndrea Glover recently moved to Port St. Lucie, Florida, where she teaches high school history. She also recently got engaged to Jason Paez on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building.\n\nEvelyn Chen went in a new direction in becoming the Director of Development for Equality Now, an international nonprofit defending the human rights of women and girls through legal action. Still committed to environmental causes, she also recently joined the Board of Directors of the Lower East Side Ecology Center in New York City.\n\nIn the moving forward together category, we have some Dartmouth-laden weddings to report. Molly Feltner wrote, “I got married in June to Brad Costello (Ohio University ’00) with many Dartmouth alums in attendance. I was walked down the aisle by my father, Jonathan Feltner ’67, sister Jennifer Feltner served as the maid of honor and pastor Anna Rudberg Speiser presided over the ceremony. Also in attendance were Andrew and Karilyn Heisen, Mike Bern and Rachel Roth ’02, Andy Pease, Emmett Hogan, Annie Norman ’02 and Dave Norman, MALS’06, Colin McGlynn ’03 and Anna Serotta ’03, Julie Sleison Choiniere ’03, and Roland ’78 and Mary Walter Feltner ’78.\n\n“In other news, I’m currently in the midst of a major career change. After nearly 16 years working in journalism and nonprofit communications, I’m going back to school to become a physician assistant.” Boulat Bash also wrote in with news of his recent wedding to Gail Sweeney ’03 at Occom Pond and the DOC House in July. Boulat said the wedding was “officiated by our mutual friend Andrew Heisen and Elliot Olshansky ’04 and Jesse Roisin ’05 were among my groomsmen. Many of our Dartmouth friends celebrated with us, including Karilyn Heisen, Eric Shoemaker, Kathryn Shoemaker ’04, Jeremy Fineman, Elizabeth Terry ’07, Dan Maxell Crosby ’02, Sarah Maxell Crosby ’04 and Laura Quayle ’06. Additionally, Rob Strong ’04 did a great job photographing our special event.”\n\nAnd it looks like Katie Miller is moving mountains, or at least moving across a whole bunch of them. Katie recently returned from hiking the GR20 across the length of Corsica. Apparently this trek is considered the toughest long distance trail in Europe. Katie spent 13 full days channeling her inner Napoleon while hiking up and over these mountains from north to south—and has the bug bites to prove it.\n\nSee you all in 2018!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy last days of summer, ’01s! Graduations, meet-ups, babies and an election to report.\n\nTom Campbell recently completed his M.B.A. from the University of Washington Foster School of Business in Seattle. Now that he is out of school again he is looking forward to a more relaxing summer this year! He also said that he ran into Mamie (Fitzgerald) Marcuss at a fundraising dinner last month. They had a nice time catching up. Pavan Nihalani and his wife, Avni Doshi, also spent some time with fellow ’01s recently. As part of a trip to California, they visited Pablo Stern in San Francisco and Jeet Sohal in Los Angeles. They also spent a lot of time outside of the cities, hiking in Mineral King—a remote part of Sequoia National Park—and in Joshua Tree.\n\nWe have some baby news as well. Our esteemed previous class secretary has not forgotten the ’01 class notes and sent word of her newest addition. Kristina (Duran) Panettiere welcomed Margaret Rose on May 9. Big sister Eve (3) is enjoying the life of an older sibling but recently observed that “the baby doesn’t really do anything.” The entire family plans to spend some time in Connecticut and Maine this summer in addition to a trip to Storyland with friends. Richard Baek wrote in to share the arrival of Maxwell Lee Baek back in April. Congratulations to all!\n\nFinally, Chance Hill is running for University of Colorado regent in Colorado’s 5th Congressional District. There are nine regents elected throughout Colorado who sit on a board that governs all four campuses of the University of Colorado system. With 32,000 employees, the CU system is the third largest employer in the state. He asks everyone to “please check out my campaign video and website at chanceforcuregent.com. Any donations are greatly appreciated! Between the campaign and my job as a relatively new attorney at a law firm in Colorado Springs, I have been busy!” Best of luck, Chance!\n\nDon’t forget that Homecoming Weekend is October 6-7. I hope that many of you will attend and share some memories with the rest of us.\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nFor this column, I asked our classmates to share some of their community service endeavors. As suspected, ’01s are doing some great things in this world.\n\nWe have some classmates engaging in micro-level community building. Christine Percheski, her husband, Will McCleskey, and daughter Megan (age 2), welcomed James Stephen to their family on January 9. Stephen Forster, his wife, Suzanne, and son James, welcomed Robert William to their family on February 16. Karyn Brudnicki and Mark Landis ’97 ushered their son, Alexander Gavin Brudnicki-Landis, into this world at 9:47 p.m. on February 5, during the Patriots’ epic Super Bowl victory. Karyn also shared that she is in her seventh year as the president of the board of directors of Community Boating Inc., a not-for-profit that promotes “sailing for all” in the greater Boston area through a variety of programs for all ages, means and abilities.\n\nOther classmates are contributing to the world of letters. Amanda Cook sent word of the publication of her first book, Wellpreneur, about digital marketing for the wellness industry. Kimberley Tait’s debut novel, Fake Plastic Love, will be released in May. Inspired by her undergraduate thesis on F. Scott Fitzgerald, the book explores post-grad millennials as they navigate new lives in London and New York. To further pique your interest, Kimberley shared that some of the characters are Dartmouth graduates and a few chapters are set in Hanover.\n\nKimberley was not the only classmate to share how their experiences at Dartmouth influenced their current pursuits. Jane Parkin Kullmann wrote in about her work as a volunteer with MentorNet, an organization that provides mentorship to women in science, technology, engineering and math fields. Jane started out as a mentee at Dartmouth and is excited to now work as a mentor for a younger generation. Athena (Lentini) McAlenney wrote, “I’m a professor at a small college in New York teaching teachers how to teach kids to read. I’ve got Dartmouth’s late Dr. Pano Rodis to thank for inspiring me to pursue teaching.” Athena added that she, along with her husband, John, and sons Charlie (age 5) and Teddy (age 2) have become regulars in Hanover thanks to frequent road trips north to visit her brother-in-law’s brewery, Red Barn Brewery, in Danville, Vermont.\n\nStill others looked to the world of the arts in reaction to current events. Karin Goodfellow helped organize Together We Rise, a festival that brought together a diverse collective of artists, activists and Boston community members to stand up for a more just, peaceful and creative future. Karin enlisted Debra (Brodsky) Shigley to help with marketing for the event.\n\nFinally, last October Samantha Berdinka competed in her first USA Boxing-sanctioned amateur bout through a fundraiser for Haymakers for Hope, whose mission is to knock out cancer by literally fighting for a cure. Numerous Dartmouth alums crowded her corner to cheer her on, including Emilia Warrington Peraza ’02, Melissa Roth ’00, Jennifer Burka and others. In the end Samantha raised money for cancer research and is now a retired boxer with an undefeated record of 1-0.\n\nKeep it up ’01s!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nFor this particular column, I asked fellow ’01s to share their recent athletic endeavors. As the outpouring of responses can attest, every ’01 is an athlete in some way, shape or form.\n\nA few ’01s have been or will be lifting lots of boxes as they move around the country. Tara Dairman and Andy Cahill are relocating to Austin, Texas, with their daughter this January. They are looking forward to meeting up with any alums in the area. Lindsay (Reich) Jerutis, her husband, Jason (Connecticut College ’01), and their three children, Eleanor (5), Elizabeth (3) and Miles (almost 1), recently bought a house in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Adding endurance and patience to her athletic skillset, Lindsay joined the world of New York City commuters when she went back to work this fall as the general manager for the lifestyle brands at Time Inc.\n\nAnother one of our endurance athletes, Debbie (Bernstein) Foster, sent word of the October 28th arrival of twins, Jacob (Jake) Charlton and Sophie Carolina in Washington, D.C. Debbie welcomed these two budding Patriots fans along with their dad, David (Harvard ’00), and big sisters Abby (6) and Maddie (4).\n\nExercising some serious brainpower, Catherine Montoya began a doctoral program in educational leadership at the University of New Mexico. She is part of the inaugural cohort of the Native American leadership in education program, joining six other students representing an array of tribal nations. Catherine says she has “been busy balancing being a wife, mother of three, student and employee, but looking forward to the opportunity to further give back to Native students.”\n\nWe have some ’01s learning new tricks! Joe Sondheimer would like me to tell you that he recently completed his first triathlon (the TriRidgefield in Connecticut), but instead will share that he has progressed from being able to juggle three balls to skillfully juggling four. Not only did Ellen Pfeiffer add a third child, Daniel, to her brood, she also recently learned to hula hoop!\n\nFinally, I am excited to share the inspiration for this column. Debra (Brodsky) Shigley, Nicole (Diadato) Park, Julia Gertsberg-Scharf, Brookie Purcell and Katie Miller successfully completed the Fenway Spartan in Boston last November. Adorned in matching Dartmouth green knee-high socks, these ’01 athletes climbed walls, ran up stadium steps, heaved gallons of water uphill and did more burpees than any reasonable person should ever do. Nice work, ladies!\n\nCongratulations to all of our athletes. Work hard, play hard!\n\n—Rachel Milstein Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel. sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHappy New Year, ’01s! I hope that you are finding time to enjoy the holiday season with family and friends.\n\nAli Rashid sent his warmest wishes from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he recently became the course director of anesthesiology and perioperative medicine for the University of Miami internal medicine residency program. He is “very excited to have [his] first position with the word ‘professor’ in it!”\n\nWe seem to be in the midst of a class baby boom. Jane Parkin Kullman and Jens Kullman, along with big sister Ellie, celebrated the birth of a son, Henry David, on September 25 in Sydney, Australia. Kelly (Keene) Horst and Adam Horst ’00 welcomed their new son, Adam David, to their brood, which already consists of 4-year-old Rebecca and 2-year-old Josephine. Chris Tully wrote in to report the October 13 birth of his second daughter, Sienna Brynn. Finally, Michael Levy and his wife, Nichola (Wisconsin ’02), announced the birth of their second child, Ruby Louise, and shared news of his recent work at FloSports.tv, a sports media startup. Congratulations to everyone and here’s hoping that you get some sleep sometime soon.\n\nLeah (Threatte) Bojnowski checked in after attending the Black Alumni of Dartmouth Association (BADA) mini-reunion in Washington, D.C., in October. As BADA president, Leah helped organize the weekend-long event, which included a cocktail party, career counseling sessions and a banquet for around 150 attendees. She happily reported, “The best part of the weekend by far was a group trip to the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. It really is must see!” Great job on the mini-reunion and thanks for the recommendation on this fantastic new museum, Leah.\n\nLooking forward to hearing and reporting more news in 2017!\n\n—Rachel Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’01s! Thank you to Kristina Duran Panettiere for keeping us all up to date during the past five years. I look forward to following in her footsteps in the years to come.\n\nOur classmates continue to provide us with good reads. Corrie Francis Parks published her first book, Fluid Frames: Experimental Animation with Sand, Clay, Paint, and Pixels (Focal Press), this spring and is in her third year of teaching animation at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. As she reports, “After pounding away on the manuscript for two years I am very happy to get back in the camera room making animated shorts!” Tara Dairman hit the road in July and August to promote Stars So Sweet (Putnam/Penguin), the final novel in her foodie middle-grade series. Classmates Jeff Birk, Bill Burgess, Jessica Grabarz, Melissa (Singh) Merchant and Katie Wade all came out to bookstore events to help celebrate.\n\nWe also have some classmates on the move. Jennifer Feltner is currently living in Jackson, Wyoming, where, as part of her Ph.D. work in wildlife biology, she is researching mountain lions and other large mammals in Yellowstone National Park. She will be transferring to the University of Montana this fall and would love to meet other Dartmouth alums living in or around Missoula. Tom Campbell and his wife, Meghan Palmer (Holyoke ’01), spent their first summer in their new floating home on Lake Union in Seattle, Washington. Amanda Cook and her husband, Zak Mazeika, have left London to spend a year in Hong Kong. They would love to connect with any alums passing through. Andrew “Natan” Trief became the rabbi of Beth Shalom Synagogue in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, this summer. Natan shared that the president of the synagogue is a fellow Alpha Chi Alpha, Mark Hausmann ’83. Just after Natan stepped into his new rabbinate, Baton Rouge was hit by devastating floods. Anyone interested in helping his congregants and the city recover can visit bethshalomsynagogue.org to learn more.\n\nWe have two weddings to report. Lynne Grossman wrote in to share some great news: “I got married on April 23 in Charleston, South Carolina, to Vern Bond (Williams ’03). We had an amazing weekend with our friends and family—and many Dartmouth alumni celebrated with us, including the groom’s aunt and uncle, Marianne and Bob Price ’78, and many friends (in no particular order): Kerry (Blum) Palladino, Kate Mattern McGee, Conner McGee ’02, Katie Codey ’02, Kristin (Verdiani) Rowe, Patrick Rowe, Meghann (Ganey) Carroll, Alissa Golden, Roxanne (Stahl) O’Hara, Chris O’Hara and Lindsay (Reich) Jerutis. We recently moved from N.Y.C. to Connecticut and are enjoying married life in the suburbs.” Adrian Loehwing tied the knot to Patrick Carroll in New York two weeks after our reunion. Numerous ’01s were in attendance, including Kara (House) and Mike Bayer, Kristin Delaney, Nazanin Dana, Kelly Hsieh, Lauren Emerson, Jennifer (Taylor) Veneris, Jess Webster and Shelley (Sandell) Allen.\n\nFinally, on June 27 Rob Costello and his wife, Julianne, welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Robert Joseph Costello IV. The couple was pleasantly surprised to have their baby delivered into the world (and into the Dartmouth fold) by fellow ’01and Boston obstetrician and gynecologist Joan Hier.\n\n—Rachel Sondheimer, 143 Branchville Road, Ridgefield, CT 06877; (203) 645-693; rachel.sondheimer@gmail.com\n\nMany thanks to our reunion committee for hosting what I hear was an especially memorable event in June. Several people have told me the weekend exceeded their expectations, and I’ve seen some great pictures of not only ’01s, but also their families. So sweet! If you’d like to share your own photos with a broader audience, please post them in the “Dartmouth College Class of 2001” group on Facebook.\n\nIf you missed reunion like I did or were too busy enjoying the incredible weather to attend the ’01 author panel, you may not have heard two classmates published books this summer. Tara Dairman’s third novel, Stars So Sweet, was published by Putnam/Penguin in July. I’m a Gladys Gatsby fan and will dig into this one shortly. Meanwhile, I’ve also ordered Minh Le’s Let Me Finish!—out since June—andcan’t wait to read it with my 2-year-old. Llama Llama has been on heavy rotation in our house for months now, so we’re ready to mix things up a little.\n\nCongratulations to Carrie Hoverman Colla, who gave birth to her third child, Chloe, on April 30. Carrie said, “She attended reunion with us and enjoyed the festivities!” I’m not sure who’s more impressive, Carrie or Chloe!\n\nThis is my final column, as my term has come to an end, and Rachel Milstein Sondheimer will take over from here. Thank you, Rachel! And thanks so much to all of you for making this a fun gig. I’ll miss all the notes, so please do keep in touch, and enjoy the last of summer!\n\n—Kristina Panettiere, 20 Great Rock Road, Sherborn, MA 01770; dartmouth2001notes@gmail.com\n\nBy the time this column reaches you, many of us will be heading off to or just returning (and perhaps recovering) from reunion. I hope the festivities inspire lots of you to write in with news or memories!\n\nElenor Mak wrote earlier this spring to share some gorgeous photos of Caroline Chang’s wedding, which was “an early Dartmouth ’01 reunion in Malibu, [California].” Other classmates in attendance included Kim Vu, Candice Ling, Annie (Chung) ’03 and Ricky Wong and Soon Hyouk Lee.\n\nSeveral ’01s sent word of new babies, too. I owe Rochelle Bourgault a prize for emailing me the same day her daughter was born! She and her husband, James Gotz (University of Michigan ’91), welcomed Margaret Rachel Gotz on April 25. Rochelle still plans to attend the reunion, which will give her a chance to stop at the Coop for Margaret’s first Dartmouth onesie.\n\nLouisa Sadler Gauthier and her husband, Michael, welcomed a baby boy this March. Andrew Fuller joined big brother Henry (age 2). Louisa noted, and many will agree, “The days are long but the years are short!”\n\nDean Krishna and wife Reena announced the arrival of their third child, Ellora, who joined big sister Asha (age 4) and double big brother Veer (age 6).\n\nAnd Emily (Nielsten) White welcomed a daughter, Nora, on April 12. “Our son, Owen (who is almost 2), is excited to be a big brother. While we’ll enjoy our beach community here in California this summer, we are sorry that we can’t make it to Dartmouth reunion.”\n\nFinally, I received an entertaining update from Nicho Dankers: “As part of the early alumni retirement program here in the Upper Valley, the trumpeted report is that Aliette Karina Frank ’00 and I are—indeed—gettin’ married (at a spontaneous place and time somewhere between Balch Hill and New Year’s Day, 2017). Please forgive me if this update sounds potentially epic.\n\n“Since graduation I learned that my great-grandmother, Bertha Whittaker, was a house mother for the Tri-Kap fraternity (after my great-grandfather, William, passed away during the Great Depression and my great-uncle, Lyle, could afford tuition through writing a fraternal house history). Suffice to say it stoked my affections for the College on the landscape that shaped my life. Currently Aliette is pursuing a post-doc in anthropology while I’m working locally part time with an artistic arborist and finishing up my urban-growth forestry thesis for the University of Washington School of Environmental and Forest Sciences.” He also forwarded an email he’d just sent to safety and security in which he hilariously recounted and confessed to a number of on-campus transgressions between the years of 1998 and 2003. Nicho, I hope they share your good sense of humor. If not, as you pointed out, the statute of limitations has passed.\n\nHave a wonderful summer, everyone!\n\n—Kristina Panettiere, 20 Great Rock Road, Sherborn, MA 01770; dartmouth2001notes@gmail.com\n\nReunion is just around the corner now! If you haven’t registered yet or need more information, there are lots of helpful details at dartmouth.org/reunions.\n\nCongratulations to Pavan Nihalani, who married Avni Doshi at Burning Man on September 4, 2015. The happy newlywed wrote me to say, “There was an intense dust storm all day long and at 6 p.m., the scheduled time of the wedding, we couldn’t get to the chosen venue because of the storm and our minister failed to show up. In true Burning Man style, however, order emerged from chaos, our photographer found us a new location and one of the guests announced that he was an ordained minister and could marry us! Our beautiful, intimate group included ’01s Pablo Stern, Puck Wheaton and Schuyler Minert as well as Ariel Diaz ’02. Avni and I are living in Dubai, so please get in touch if you pass through.”\n\nAnd best wishes to Adrian Loehwing, who is engaged to marry Patrick Carroll, an Irishman from Dublin, this summer. The two met in London three years ago. Of the proposal, she wrote, “He took me to Paris one weekend last August and proposed with an emerald ring at Sacre Couer at sunset with all of Paris lit up below us. Very romantic! The wedding is happening in New York two weeks after reunion, so it will be a great way to catch up with old friends in Hanover and, I hope, see many of them again at the wedding two weeks later!”\n\nWe have new babies in the ’01 family, too. Amelia Kahl and Alan Green welcomed their second daughter, Ginevra River Kahl-Green, on December 5. Their older daughter Eleanor (3) is excited to be a big sister! Elizabeth (Walter) Shelly and her husband “welcomed son Rowan in December—the best early Christmas present possible! Big sister Hazel is cautiously optimistic about this new family development, especially as baby brother’s arrival also came with lots of grandparent attention and presents.” Jessica Wirth Strine and her husband, Todd, had their second baby boy, Jonas Michael Strine, on December 27. Jessica told me, “We are keeping it real in our den of toddler toys and fuzzy vibrating infant nests in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.”\n\nLast November, after more than eight years with Schwab, Robin DeGracia left for “a small, fast-growing financial services firm called AssetMark to join its newly created product management team. Then very shortly afterward, my husband and I bought our first home, here in the Bay Area. We and our two children are now nicely settled in and looking to have years of wonderful memories here.” Ali Rashid is enjoying his new job and home, too. From sunny Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he wrote, “I’ve been working in the ICU and operating room getting a very broad variety of work and spending a lot of time working with my brother (and roommate) Omar Rashid ’00, who is a cancer surgeon at the same hospital. We are doing a lot to move forward (and I’d like to think pioneer) enhanced recovery after surgery and comprehensive surgical care. It’s rare to have a close periopertive team like we do and the hospital has been very supportive so we’re just running with it!”\n\nFinally, we’re nearing the end of the school year—last chance to pay your class dues! You can get it done in two minutes right now at our class website: 2001.dartmouth.org.\n\nI hope to see you all in Hanover in June!\n\n—Kristina Panettiere, 20 Great Rock Road, Sherborn, MA 01770; dartmouth2001notes@gmail.com\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nWill Hughes and his wife, Gray, welcomed a healthy new baby, Alexander, on September 18. “He joins Peter (5) and Whitney (2). Three little kids is endless fun but also a workout!”\n\nSusan (Swords) Gudas added to her family in the fall, too. “My husband, Chris Gudas (Brown ’01), and I welcomed Olivia Mary Gudas this October. We are overjoyed and our Doberman pinscher Perrla has been an amazing big sister.”\n\nTara Dairman and Andy Cahill became parents just before the turn of the year. They “are thrilled to welcome baby Nora Lucille Dairman-Cahill to the family. She was born on December 23, 2015, in Boulder and looks forward to her first visit to Dartmouth this summer for reunion.” For the record, these three babies are exceptionally adorable. I saw pictures of Alexander and Nora, and I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Olivia.\n\nBen Mandelker wrote with big news of a different variety. His podcast, Watch What Crappens, “which skewers Bravo TV,” hit a ratings milestone of 200,000 monthly listeners and reached No. 3 on the iTunes TV and film charts. “I’m super excited about it, and I can’t wait to see how it grows over the next year!”\n\n—Kristina Panettiere, 20 Great Rock Road, Sherborn, MA 01770; dartmouth2001notes@gmail.com\n\nI’m very sad to report our classmate Adam Tanney passed away in September. On behalf of the class, I offer our sincere condolences to all his loved ones, including his son, Xavier.\n\nWhen I set out to collect news for this particular column, I solicited book recommendations in addition to updates. Thank you to all who participated! I, for one, will be checking out some of these titles in the months to come. As you make your own 2016 reading list, please consider When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, the late husband of Lucy (Goddard) Kalanithi. It broke my heart and brought me solace at the same time. Jessica Wirth Strine loved The Orphan Master’s Son by Adam Johnson, and Leah (Threatte) Bojnowski enjoyed The Dovekeepers by Alice Hoffman. Shira (Reiss) Krance recommends The Year of Soup by her father, Howard Reiss ’73. She said, “This novel was recently ranked No. 1 on Amazon in the bisexual romance category.”\n\nAndrew Trief sent me a happy note to say he’d married Samantha Shabman (George Washington University ’11) in the fall. He “had proposed six months earlier while running the Paris marathon with her, just a few minutes before the finish line.” Dartmouth alums in attendance at the wedding included Ivan Cestero, Christopher Taylor and Tibor Nagy ’00. Andrew also included a strong recommendation for Narcissus and Goldmund by Hermann Hesse. Andy Pease is excited to announce he and wife Lisa Samols (Columbia ’04) had a baby last spring. “Benjamin Samols Pease was born on May 3 in Tempe, Arizona. I also just finished my doctorate (doctor of musical arts) in wind conducting at the Arizona State University School of Music, graduating eight days after Ben was born. We now live in Phoenix.” On his bookshelf? Hyperion by Dan Simmons and its sequel, Fall of Hyperion. “They’re like Canterbury Tales in space opera form—good stuff!” Steve Forster wrote to say he and wife Suzanne welcomed their first child, James Stephen Forster, on May 16. Catherine (Nakai) Montoya and husband James had a girl, Callie, on May 18. Catherine noted, “Our boys (Jacob, 7, and Justin, 6) love her so much, checking on her constantly or helping us keep her entertained.” And Julia Calderon Rizzo, husband Mike and son Luke welcomed baby Natalie to their family on August 24. Congratulations!\n\nVanessa (Spencer) Blake’s 18-and-over women’s doubles tennis team won the 6.5 Combo State Championship for Georgia in October. She added, “We are headed to the regional championship in Alabama in the spring!” And earlier this year Kelly Fisher second chaired a trial in Portland, Oregon, “that resulted in a $3 million jury verdict. We represented a nurse who was terminated after 34 years of employment after she complained that time standards relating to productivity were negatively impacting her ability to properly care for patients. The jury found for us on all counts (retaliation under Oregon’s nurse staffing law, age discrimination and breach of contract), awarding $1.5 million in compensatory damages and another $1.5 million in punitive damages.”\n\nFinally, a note fromour class VP, Kristin Delaney:“I am busy planning our 15th reunion (June 17-19—save the date!) with our class committee and committee reunion volunteers. I’m currently working on picking caterers and collaborating with the ’00s and ’02s on cluster events. If you’d like to help, please reach out! In my free time I am currently finishing We Are Called to Rise by Laura McBride (wonderful!) and about to start Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert.”\n\n—Kristina Panettiere, 20 Great Rock Road, Sherborn, MA 01770; dartmouth2001notes@gmail.com\n\nSave the date!

Meanwhile, enjoy these updates from your classmates, and please consider submitting one of your own. Everything you read here will make a great conversation starter in June!\n\nIn early August Jane Parkin Kullmann published her first article for her Ph.D. in JMIR Research Protocols. You can read the article, which is about developing a web-based questionnaire for her study of ALS, here: www.researchprotocols.org/2015/3/e96. Sherryta Freeman is now the senior associate athletic director for student development at the University of Pennsylvania. Sarah Craft wrote to say, “This year I was the alto soloist at Carnegie Hall in Vivaldi’s Gloria with the Masterworks Festival Chorus and at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall in Mozart’s Coronation Mass with the American Classical Orchestra. This fall I’ll be a soloist with Princeton Pro Musica in Mendelssohn’s Elijah and on January 19, 2016, Carnegie Hall will present me in a solo spotlight recital with legendary pianist Warren Jones as part of its annual art song celebration, ‘The Song Continues.’ And I’m still living in Brooklyn with my husband, James Lawrie ’00, and our two kids, Theo (6) and Owen (3).” Kudos to each of you!\n\nEmily (Pollakowski) Harder welcomed a daughter during last year’s epic New England winter. “Our newest addition, Cecily Hope, joined our family in between snowstorms this past February. Big sister Elsa and big brother Ethan have enthusiastically welcomed her. Adam and I are smitten.” Kate (Mattern) McGee and husband Conner McGee ’02 had their third child, Cassandra “Casey” Elizabeth, on June 25. She joins big brother Jamie (3 1/2) and big sister Alex (2) in their busy N.Y.C. household. Kate added, “Conner has recently returned to financial advising and now works at Morgan Stanley, and I run marketing for the startup delivery.com.” Also on June 25, Clara Elise was born to Matt Wilkens and wife Julia (University of Virginia ’05). Matt says, “Clara’s an extremely laid-back, healthy and happy baby girl and we couldn’t be happier parents.” Ryan Heiberg and his wife, Suzanne Beauchene, are pleased to announce a new addition to their family, too: “Savannah was born August 1 and is heavily guarded by her older brothers Dorian and Drew and enjoying the exceptionally warm and sunny summer in Seattle.” Finally, Esther Freeman and Adam Young are delighted to announce the arrival of Amos Jonathan Freeman Young, born on August 11. Fortunately for Amos, Esther notes, “Our labradoodle Moosilauke isn’t so sure, but we think we’ll keep the baby!” Congratulations to all! And new babies, please be good to your parents. Maybe they’ll take you to Hanover next June.\n\n—Kristina Panettiere, 20 Great Rock Road, Sherborn, MA 01770; dartmouth2001notes@gmail.com\n\nHi, ’01s!\n\nAnna Rudberg Speiser and her husband, Pete, “love living in an 1890s farmhouse on my family’s farm in northeast Nebraska, keeping horses, raising chickens and starting up some beehives. Pete is working as a Lutheran pastor in a neighboring town and I’m a pastor and chaplain at a hospital in nearby Sioux City, Iowa. And our most exciting news is we had our first child, Ingrid Linnea, last July. Inga’s 10 months old now and such a joy! We enjoy seeing Dartmouth friends on occasion, most recently Jennifer Tlumak Westerholm and Christine Percheski, and only wish we weren’t all so spread out.” Happy belated birthday to Inga!\n\nJay Bregman raised $2.5 million for Verifly, his new venture aimed at putting trust and safety into drones. He is actively hiring in New York City; Dublin, Ireland; San Francisco, California; and Xiamen, China. Ramon Zertuche joined Ford Motor Co. recently as manager of international government affairs for the Americas (Canada, Mexico and South America). He previously served as minority staff director for the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nMichael Holmes wrote to say he’ll “be enrolling in the master’s program in English literature at University of Vermont, Montpelier, and also serving as a graduate teaching assistant in charge of sections of the introductory freshman writing course. He already has one essay, about Henry James’ The Golden Bowl, flagged by a professor—Daniel Mark Fogel, who happens to be founder of The Henry James Review!—as literary journal material, so with any luck it’ll one day see publication.”\n\nJen Feltner shared, “My update is that I’ve made a major career shift during the past few years from Chinese language and literature (my major at Dartmouth) and international relations to wildlife biology. I’m now getting my Ph.D. in wildlife biology at N.C. State, but my research is based in the southern gr"
