        "text": "Actress Abigail Spencer is locked up in a nasty custody battle, and the 'Suits' star says she is the victim of verbal abuse and bullying by her ex-husband.\n\nAccording to legal documents, obtained by The Blast, Spencer filed documents in her divorce case asking a judge to modify the custody arrangement with her ex-husband, Andrew Pruett.\n\nRelated:\n\nStars at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic\n\nThe Documents\n\nIn the filing, Spencer says her ex is controlling and is not allowing her, and the couple's son Roman, to have a healthy relationship. She also pleads with the court to force her ex-husband to not be allowed to use her acting career against her in the custody war.\n\n\"It is essential to my livelihood that I not only be able to continue working as an actress, but that said work does not negatively impact my relationship with Roman or my ability to exercise my custodial time,\" Spencer says in the documents.\n\nThe Alleged Abuse\n\nShe continues, her ex-exhusband, \"makes no effort to accommodate my work schedule n He bullied me our entire marriage and he has continued this attempt over the past 8 years since our Separation.\"\n\nAbigail describes the verbal abuse and nasty exchanges with her ex Andrew Pruett, saying, \"He has yelled at me numerous times in Roman's presence and made scenes numerous times in public. i.e.‚ a child's birthday party; in front of an entire restaurant of people; in a parking lot at church; an open house night in front of other parents to name a few.\n\n\"He is verbally abusive and a bully,\" Spencer says.\n\nAvoiding Contact\n\nThe actress explains she avoids direct contact with Pruett as much as possible. \"I try not to be on the phone with him alone or alone with him at all and do everything via text and email to make sure I'm not subjecting myself to his abusive behavior,\" she says in the documents.\n\nAbigail stars in the television show, \"Reprisal\" and the on-location filming also became as sore spot with the ex-couple.\n\nMeghan Markle Connection\n\nSpencer has been in the news lately because of her friendship with 'Suits' co-star Meghan Markle.\n\nIn February, Abigail was photographed attending a baby shower in NYC for Markle. But, she is a bit tightlipped about the princess, telling US Weekly, \"She’s so amazing. You know, I try not to … I don’t talk about our relationship but, you know, she’s amazing. She’s wonderful. She’s one of the most incredible people on the planet, so I’m just glad that other people get to see her wonder.”"
