        "text": "Uncategorized\n\nLast Week Delight 7/22/2024\n\nBoy howdy a lot has happened in the world in the last 10 days. Let’s see what little joys have happened in my slice of it.\n\nThe ridiculously hot weather in Baltimore finally broke and we got a nice day or two before returning to our regularly scheduled hot (but not obscene) and humid weather.\n\nWe were supposed to be getting our windows replaced today, but last week when I looked I didn’t see a permit pulled so I asked my husband if he wanted to call the window people to check on it. We are both introverts who hate making phone calls, and it’s usually always a war between us about who has to call for things like repair people or food delivery. Overall I’m always the loser because I have to call so many doctors offices, pharmacies, and insurance companies that I can’t pawn off on him. Anyway, in this instance he didn’t even fight me on it. He just said he would do it, which was amazing. The company did not in fact yet have the permit pulled so we’ve rescheduled, which turns out to be good anyway because it’s supposed to be off and on rainy today.\n\nI always take an umbrella with me when we go to the Newport Folk Festival. It comes in handy for both rain and shade. I was thinking this year I wanted to buy myself a reflective umbrella so that the hot sun is not absorbing into my normal black umbrella. I threw one in my Amazon cart and waited for Prime Day to see if the price dropped, which is did. Then when it came my husband started laughing because he also apparently bought me a reflective umbrella on Prime Day even though we had zero conversations about me wanting one. So now he’s taking the one I ordered, and I’m taking the one he ordered for me because it’s girly and has flowers on it.\n\nI have struggled with minor plantar fasciitis for a couple of years. The orthopedist I saw about it last year was horribly sick, unmasked, and got me sick so I never wanted to go back to him and my foot felt somewhat better if not all better after doing some of the stretching exercises he recommended, but then in addition to the remaining pain from that, I developed some tendonitis in my outer ankle and side of my foot back in April. It wasn’t really getting much better so I finally saw a podiatrist about it last week. I really liked him. He’s the first doctor I’ve had since mask mandates dropped that walked into the exam room, saw me in a mask, and asked if I wanted him to wear one too. And I also appreciated that he looked at my medical history and immediately knew that long term high doses of NSAIDs were would of the question for me. I have to explain that to most doctors when they try to prescribe them, so I wasn’t anticipating that a foot doctor would be on top of the fact that my Crohn’s does not do well with that. So I left with a prescription for some new shoes (please to enjoy me wearing the same pair of sneakers with every outfit for the next year) and the same stretches I’ve already been doing. So hopefully this all eventually starts feeling better though he said it could take over a year.\n\nI love Garrett’s cheddar/caramel popcorn mix. I have tried many other versions of it from brands you can buy in the grocery store to mixes from other fancy popcorn shops and none of them are as good as Garrett’s. There’s something about the richness of their flavors, especially the cheese. The caramel is a deep almost burnt caramel and the popcorn is super coated in it so it’s very crispy which makes a nice contrast to the softness of the cheese popcorn. Since I don’t live in Chicago I do not have easy access to Garrett’s popcorn and buying it online is obscenely expensive. A lot of businesses do their own sales to compete with Amazon’s Prime Day and for some reason I got a Facebook ad for Garrett’s sale, so I decided to treat myself. The discount pretty much just wound up covering what I had to pay in shipping, so it was still pricy but a nice rare treat.\n\nCobra Kai came back for it’s final season this week. The show is not great anymore. They have definitely run out of story, and at this point all the supposed teenagers are like 30 years old. But what makes me happy about it is saying Cobra Kai. I don’t really know how to explain it buy there’s a way like to say the name of the show really quick in not quite a whisper that I find super fun and it’s the only way I say it.\n\nAnd now for my musical delights:\n\nAs I wrote about in my previous post I won tickets to see Mt. Joy at Merriweather Post Pavilion.\n\nAs I believe I have previously mentioned, I am watching this 20 year old ABC Family show, Wildfire. In the episode I watched yesterday the song “What Can I Say” by Brandi Carlile was on the soundtrack. It’s the first song used on the show that I’ve actually recognized. It’s off her self-titled first album which was released during the run of this show. A lot of songs from her first two albums made their way into TV soundtracks in the mid-aughts. Those first few seasons of Grey’s Anatomy were chock full of them. Anyway, it’s a song of Brandi’s that I really love, and it was nice to hear it. It made me go listen to that whole album after I finished watching the episode. She was but a wee baby when this album came out. She was probably younger than some of the actors playing teenagers on the show.\n\nMt. Joy at Merriweather Post Pavilion\n\nLast night we went to Merriweather Post Pavilion to see Mt. Joy. I had entered a contest to win free tickets and actually won. I had been on the fence about going to see them because I already had so many other concerts at Merriweather this summer and with it being the week before the Newport Folk Festival I wasn’t sure I wanted to be in a big crowd and risk getting sick and ruining my trip. But I figured since I had free tickets I would go.\n\nI first became familiar with Mt. Joy when they played the Newport Folk Festival a number of years ago. I was like who is this band singing a song about Baltimore? I figured they must be from Baltimore, but they’re actually from Pennsylvania. The last time I saw them was back in 2018 at the 8×10 Club, which is this tiny club in Baltimore that holds a couple hundred people. They’ve come a long way since then. Last night they were pretty close to selling out Merriweather Post Pavilion, which has a capacity of 19,000 people. I feel like along the way they have turned into a bit more of a jam band (though they definitely haven’t gone all in on this), and the fans they have accumulated along with that made me feel very out of place. I don’t remember feeling like I was way too old and too sober to be at their previous show, but I definitely felt like that last night. The vast majority of the audience was teenagers and twentysomethings who were all high.\n\nWe had already positioned ourselves in the far back corner of the lawn right up near a corner of the fence where I figured it would be pretty quiet. I turned out to be wrong about that. I still don’t understand how walking in front of our blanket became the way that people were moving about the lawn because logistically it didn’t make much sense, but all of a sudden it just turned into this thoroughfare of people constantly walking right in front of me. Add to that fact that even though we were right next to the fence a group of EMTs working the festival decided that shoving themselves in the corner next to us with some of them sitting on the fence was a great place to wait until they were needed for any medical emergencies. So instead of being away from people I literally had a guy hovering over my head and a constant stream of people walking by me. The EMTs of course were not interested in the concert either so they were chatting with each other ruining my ability to listen to the music. At that point I was just super annoyed by everyone and told my husband we had to move. There is a grassy area off to the side of the lawn that’s not part of the lawn proper where there are some picnic tables set up. There isn’t really a view of the stage from there, but at that point I didn’t care if I could see as long as I could hear. It turns out I could still see a screen from there, so while not the ideal view at least I could still see something. And I was much happier with more space around me.\n\nI was amused by the EMTs talking and saying that this concert should be an easy one to work. The weather had cooled off and the crowd was going to be nice and chill, which yes because they were all high. They said that country concerts are the worst ones to work, which did not surprise me in the least. There’s a reason why I rarely go to country concerts even though I like a lot of country music.\n\nAnyway, as for the show it self, there was no opener. Mt. Joy played two sets with a break in between. I still enjoy their music, though some of it a little less live because of the live versions getting dragged out and turning into jams. Though again I will say none of them went on obscenely long. In addition to music from their own albums they played a couple of covers. I was not surprised that one of the songs in their finale was “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac since they did the same thing on their recent live album. I was totally surprised to hear them play Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own”. I love that song, so that was kind of fun. Not my favorite concert ever, but overall a good night and definitely worth the price I paid to get in.\n\nThe girl, so confusing version with Lorde by Charlie XCX\n\nIn some corners of the world the album of the summer is Charlie XCX’s Brat. In one of the songs on the album “The girl, so confusing”, Charlie XCX is singing about another pop star who people compare her to, but she doesn’t know what their relationship is. She doesn’t know if they’re friends or not. She feels like they’re complete opposites, but people won’t stop comparing them, and whatever relationship they might have has been tainted by that. The chorus broadens out the narrative to address the fact that women are pitted against each other like this in general while the verses seem very specific to this one other person.\n\nInternet sleuths being internet sleuths very quickly ascertained that the other pop star in question was Lorde. The original song is catchy, but what really makes the song worth talking about is the updated version that features Lorde which includes a verse with her singing her side of the story about how she was jealous of Charlie XCX. How she was having all kinds of her own personal body issues that being compared to Charlie XCX didn’t help and that it really had nothing to do with her at all.\n\nIt’s a very open, honest, and revealing response that could have gone an entirely different way. Lorde could have felt offended by the song, but instead chose to be honest about her own insecurities in a way that has hopefully strengthened her relationships with Charlie XCX . More importantly I hope it serves as a good example to all the girls out there who are feeling insecure and comparing themselves to other girls and feeling like other girls hate them even though it might have nothing to do with them.\n\nLast Week Delight 7/15/2024\n\nI randomly bought a bag of dried sugared mango at Target awhile ago that I didn’t eat right away. I wound up taking it on my trip to St. Thomas to have on hand as an airplane snack. I had never eaten it before, and now I am in love. I keep buying more every week at the grocery store. I’m lying to myself that it’s healthy for me. It’s probably better than eating chips, but dried fruit already has a ton of sugar in it and this is coated in sugar on top of that. But it’s delicious.\n\nFor weeks everyone in my neighborhood has been wondering where our ice cream man has been as he hasn’t been coming around. He’s an old guy, so every time he disappears for a long stretch everyone gets worried. But he was back last night. I already had a dessert on hand, so I didn’t actually get any ice cream, but it was nice to hear his little tune driving around the neighborhood again.\n\nOn Saturday night we went over to our friends’ house for dinner and a game night. We hadn’t seen them since a Christmas party in early December, so it was good to hang out and catch up.\n\nI ordered salmon for dinner on Saturday and the portion was huge, so I took the rest of it home and I thought it was even better on top of the salad I made for myself for dinner last night. A perfect dinner for a hot night.\n\nAs I have mentioned in this blog before I have doing a rewatch of One Tree Hill while listening along to the Drama Queens podcast, which has been hosted by the three main actresses from the show. We recently reached the end of season 6 of the show. Hilarie Burton left the show along with Chad Michael Murray at the end of that season. There was unsurprisingly no new podcast episode the week of July 4, but they put out a little teaser saying they had a big announcement for next week’s episode. I pretty quickly figured out that they were going to add a new co-host figuring it would be one of the actresses that joined the show after season 7. I was right about the new co-host. I was 100% wrong about who it was going to be. Turns out despite the name of the podcast being Drama Queens, the new co-host is Robert Buckley. I follow the podcast’s Instagram account, so I saw the little announcement video they put up on the account before I heard the episode where they introduced him. In the video you see someone putting on an evil queen from Snow White costume until they turn around and reveal it to be Rob. I thought it was something that the podcast producers put together, but turns out it was all Rob’s idea to show up like that. They record over Zoom and the amount of hysterical laughing that happens when they let him in the Zoom room was priceless. I am a little bummed that it sounds like Hilarie Burton is mostly leaving the podcast other than as a co-producer and an occasional pop-in. They had always talked about her staying on getting her perspective as someone who has never seen the final three seasons of the show, which I wish they would do even if they wanted to bring on someone else who experienced filming the show and could give the behind the scenes intel. She was always my favorite on both the show and the podcast, so I wish she was still going to be around more but oh well.\n\nMy oldest friend who I met in 8th grade and who I have managed to stay real life friends with despite my family moving again after 9th grade sent me photos she found yesterday. One was of me with 3 kids I used to babysit. Two were siblings that lived next door and I had a regular gig with. The third kid I didn’t even remember, but she jogged my memory. I wrote on the back of it me with the three kids names on it. I have no idea why I would have then given it to my friend. She also sent me this photo of the corner of my bedroom from those few years we lived in Massachusetts. Turns out my memory of that bedroom was pretty fuzzy. I have zero recollection of that bulletin board at all. It makes sense that I had one, but I have zero memory of it in that room or ever putting anything on it. Also wow I had some old lady style back then. A floral bedspread and that rose colored table skirt with the lace doily on the night stand. Woweee! And in case you’re wondering if I’ve always been the way I’ve been about music, the answer is yes. After sending the unadulterated version of the photo, my friend send it again with the antenna from my stereo circled with the comment VIP radio antenna for making mix tapes.\n\nAnd now for your musical delights\n\nI entered a contest to win tickets to see Mt. Joy at Merriweather Post Pavilion on Saturday and last night I got an email saying I had won! I’m excited. My poor husband how now has to get dragged to one more concert because no one else wants to go with me is less excited.\n\nLast Wednesday was Mavis Staples 85th birthday. She is such an inspiration. Always so full of joy but always doing her part to fight the injustices of the world while promoting love. It was great to see her getting a bunch of accolades across various media outlets. It’s always nice to be able to celebrate people while they’re still alive. It also gave me a good excuse to revisit one of my favorite performance’s from the Newport Folk Festival.\n\nNew Music Friday: 28 by Zach Bryan\n\nThere’s a ton of new music out today. Almost too much to keep up with. So far I’ve managed to listen to the new albums by Johnny Blue Skies (fka Sturgill Simpson), Clairo, and Cassandra Jenkins. What I’m choosing to write about though is Zach Bryan’s surprise (I think) album drop on the 4th of July called The Great American Bar Scene.\n\nZach Bryan has obviously been a phenomenon over the past couple of years seemingly overnight rocketing to the kind of stardom that sells out arenas. His music seems like it was made in a lab to appeal to me. I wrote about “Something in the Orange” a few years ago, but other than that song I found it difficult to get into his music the way I felt like I should be. It’s not because I dislike it because quite the opposite I really do like it. As I said it’s precisely my favorite kind of music. My issue was that by the time I came across Zach Bryan (again the perils of being a music lover not on TikTok these days) he already had a lot of music out there, and it was hard to know where to even start. Even the album that was released shortly after I become aware of him, American Heartbreak, has 34 songs on it and is 2 hours long. It’s too much. So mostly I would hear songs here and there and think I like that, but never really spend much time with his albums.\n\nAnn Powers said something to the effect of (I’m greatly paraphrasing here) that the new album is where Zach Bryan really came together for her, and I can agree with that. I feel like it has stepped his songwriting up a notch and feels like a more cohesive album than just here’s every song I’ve written since I put out my last album. Bryan has talked about his musical influences like Bruce Springsteen (who appears on “Sandpaper”), Tyler Childers, and Jason Isbell. I can hear all those influences come through in this music while Bryan still comes through with his own voice. To me this album is like if Tyler Childers and Jason Isbell had a baby and Zach Bryan raised it.\n\nI’ve only had time to listen to the album all the way through once at this point (too much music, not enough time!). 28 is the song that jumped out at me the most during that listen, so it’s what I’m sharing with you here. Now I need to get back to listening so I can join the rabid Zach Bryan fandom (or perhaps I shouldn’t so I don’t get disappointed when I can’t get tickets to see him in concert).\n\nLast Week Delight 7/8/2024\n\nObviously one of my biggest delights of the week was going to see Gatsby at the American Repertory Theater on Saturday, but no need to elucidate more on that here since my previous post goes into great detail about the trip.\n\nI almost feel like I’m jinxing it writing about it here, but I’m happy that our current HVAC system is still hanging on by a string and functioning despite this horrid heat. Fingers crossed it keeps working until they can replace it in a couple weeks.\n\nOn the Fourth of July we went to my sister-in-law’s house for a bbq. It was a nice afternoon of hanging out with family.\n\nOur Fourth plans were around lunch time so we actually wound up back home around 6:30. Normally we’re at our friends pool party and stay up there until their neighbors set off fireworks. Since we did something different and were home this year I suggested to my husband that we walk up to the top of a parking garage in neighborhood that also sits at the highest point in the neighborhood and is well elevated above downtown to see if we could actually see the Baltimore fireworks from there. Turns out there is a great view of the fireworks from up there and we are far from the only people with that idea. We could also see official shows I think from Essex and somewhere else in northern Baltimore County. There was also something that looked fairly professional out to the west, but I don’t know what that would have been. Plus you just got a nice panoramic view of all the illegal fireworks going off around the city. So we saw lots and lots of fireworks.\n\nI’ll write more about it in my next TV Diary post, but I started watching this 20 year old ABC Family show, Wildfire, that is sort of a teen drama set in the world of horse racing. It’s ridiculous, and I’m loving it. It’s rare that I find shows I actually want to binge watch these days. It was the perfect way to spend my very hot Friday off of work.\n\nOne of my book clubs met yesterday. We’re all in our mid-40s and in perimenopause, so we read The Menopause Brain and had a nice discussion about it. Plus I got to snuggle with my friends’ teeny tiny new Siamese kitten, Tybalt, who is only 3.5 pounds and super skinny right now. He was a little love bug and so cute.\n\nAnd now for my musical delights:\n\nKick It! That shout at the beginning of the Beastie Boys’ “(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)” is so delightful. I am sort of agnostic about the song as a whole, but that “Kick it!” always gives me a little jolt of joy.\n\nYesterday I heard the song “Make Me Lose Control” by Eric Carmen. For some reason it made me think about my mom. I guess because it’s probably a song she liked when I was a kid. I don’t have any particular memories attached to it. It’s also not a song I ever really hear. I still hear “Hungry Eyes” by Eric Carmen fairly frequently, but I almost never hear this song by him.\n\nGatsby at the American Repertory Theater\n\nSeveral years ago I saw news that Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine was working on a musical adaptation of The Great Gatsby. The story and her music seemed like a perfect fit to me, so I was really excited by the prospect of it and hoped to one day see it on Broadway. Years went by and I didn’t hear anything more about it, and then one day I heard that a Gatsby musical was opening on Broadway, and I was super excited until I realized that it was an entirely different musical based on The Great Gatsby. Apparently with The Great Gatsby’s copyright expiring two different groups were trying to produce a Broadway show based on it at the same time. Obviously only one of them was ever going to make it to Broadway. Unfortunately it was the wrong one. I thought all hope was lost of me ever seeing Florence Welch’s version of it until I saw that the American Repertory Theater at Harvard was mounting a production this summer. I was determined to get up there to see it.\n\nI thought it might be slightly easier than it turned out to be since my sister lives outside of Boston. I figured I could go up there for a weekend and visit and see the show, but our schedules during the run of the show would just not jive. When I was available she wasn’t and vice versa. Eventually I noticed that they had extended the run by 2 weeks so I thought that I could tack it onto our normal trip to the Newport Folk Festival since they’re fairly close, but of course by the time I found out about the extension the show that we would have gone to had we done that was sold out. The only weekend I could figure out to go up there was over 4th of July, but plane tickets to go up for the whole weekend were crazy expensive. Then I thought to myself I wonder if it would be cheap if we flew up and back in the same day on that Saturday since that shouldn’t be a super busy travel day for the long weekend. I was correct. To fly up and back same day was like $600 cheaper for the both us than if we had gone for more days. So as crazy as it seemed that’s we decided to do.\n\nOur flight left Baltimore at 7 am. Due to strong storms up the coast instead of flying directly up the coast like you normally would we did some crazy route out west, up near Syracuse and north of Albany and up north by Portland, Maine where we swung out to see and then eventually came back into Boston going southwest. It added about 45 minutes to our normally quick flight. We still made it in plenty of time. We got dropped off in Cambridge around 10:30 and made our way over the Harvard Art Museums, which is I guess technically 3 art museums in one. It’s free and open to the public, so it was a great way to kill time for about an hour before meeting my sister for lunch before the show.\n\nGatsby was absolutely fantastic. I don’t know all the logistics behind how shows get to Broadway and why the other one made it instead of this one, but I will definitively say without having seen the other one yet that the wrong one made it. I was prepared to acknowledge my bias in that assessment initially because of my love of Florence Welch, but having now read reviews of both productions I feel fairly confident in my opinion. The reviews for the actual Gatsby on Broadway are terrible or mediocre at best. I think the only Tony Award it got nominated for was costumes. So not a super ringing endorsement for that production. Every review I read of the Gatsby production at A.R.T. was glowing. At some point I sort of do want to see the Broadway production so I can make my own comparison, but I’m sorry most people won’t get to see the better one.\n\nThe music and lyrics very much felt like they were written by Florence Welch. I could totally hear her voice in them, especially when any of the female characters were singing. I loved the music and story. The book written by Martyna Majok was both funny and dramatic. I appreciated that they played a little bit loose with the story. I felt like they made it better. They really leaned into the idea of the haves and the have nots with the Buchanans and Gatsby versus George and Myrtle Wilson. They also made all the queer subtext that people have written in their heads about Nick and Jordan Baker text. It’s not central to the plot in any way, but Nick does make out with a male photographer at a party and Jordan is clearly into whoever she wants. Apparently that offended a couple of older women who left right after Nick’s make out session. Meanwhile all the relationships felt fuller to me than they do in the book. I actually love the book, but this show made it feel even more alive to me.\n\nThe performances were all wonderful. Solea Pfeiffer who played Myrtle was the real stand out of the show. Her performance just blew me away, and I’m not the only one. I saw her called out in a number of the reviews I read, especially the final fight song with her and Matthew Amira as her husband George Wilson. Really the whole cast was great though. If you somehow happen to be in the Boston area in the next couple of weeks and can get tickets I can’t recommend it highly enough.\n\nAfter the show we hopped straight back in an Uber and headed back to the airport. Unfortunately our plane out was delayed, but it wasn’t horrible We made it home again only about 45 minutes late. I said that yesterday was making up for every flight I’ve taken since COVID started which have all been on time or even early. So we were back home again about 16 hours after we left our house in the morning. I kind of crazy trip, but I’m really glad we did it.\n\nSong of the Summer 2024\n\nWe’re halfway through the summer so it’s probably about time for me to talk about my songs of the summer. There was an early assertion that “Espresso” by Sabrina Carpenter was the song of the summer, though I feel like people have maybe turned on it a little bit because they’re tired of Spotify shoving it at them or something. I don’t use Spotify in a way that might cause that to happen, so that is not an experience I share. It is not and has never been my personal choice for Song of the Summer. I don’t know what it is about the song but if I’m not listening to it, it immediately falls out of my head. Despite having heard it many times at this point I could not sing a note of it for you right now. It also doesn’t fit the criteria of what I like in my songs of summer, which I will get back to in a minute. It definitely is giving full on rosé wave vibes, but that means it’s too downbeat for me.\n\nI have also heard people talking about “Million Dollar Baby” by Tommy Richman. I gather it rose to popularity through TikTok as so much does these days. I am an old who does not have and refuses to get TikTok even though I do hate that it pretty much leaves me out of the musical loop these days because that’s where all the new music seems to be coming from and then all of a sudden there are these artists who are ragingly popular who I have never heard of. Anyway, I started seeing stuff about how “Million Dollar Baby” was dethroning “Espresso” as the Song of the Summer, but I had never even heard of it. I sought it out on Spotify, listened to it that one time, and hope to never, ever hear it again. I viscerally hated it. It definitely is way too downbeat to be Song of the Summer in my opinion, and I just don’t like it as a song.\n\nSo you ask, if I am uninterested in the two biggest contenders for Song of the Summer what do I think the Song of the Summer should be? I’m glad you asked. First I’ll share what I look for in the song of the summer. As you probably have guessed based on the fact that I think “Espresso” and “Million Dollar Baby” are too downbeat, I want an upbeat, poppy song. I want something that is fun to sing along to. That’s pretty much it. Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” is probably still the epitome of the Song of the Summer for me. There are some pretty good options this summer though.\n\nMy top pick is probably Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”. It’s a fun song. It’s super upbeat. It’s a fantastic song to sing along with. The hot summer weather always makes me more drawn to country music so it’s country influences are an added bonus. It also has the benefit of really being cross genre so people who are drawn to hip hop, pop, and country can all potentially enjoy it. I even heard it on the local country radio station the other day, which I was not expecting.\n\nMy second choice is Ariana Grande’s “we can’t be friends (wait for your love)”. It’s also a fun, upbeat song. It totally gives me Robyn vibes and reminds me a lot of “Dancing on My Own”. I was a big fan the second I heard it. It’s still a song I hear on the radio a lot, but it’s not a song I feel like as really been a part of any larger conversations which is a shame because I love it.\n\nMy final choice, which I am not actually sold on as Song of the Summer is “Too Sweet” by Hozier. I think its ubiquitous is starting to fade some, but there was a moment where I couldn’t turn on the radio without hearing that song on at least one channel. It is fun to sing to, but I doesn’t quite give enough of a pop song vibe for me to think of it as the Song of the Summer even though it is a song I like.\n\nI have one more song as a runner-up that I have never considered for Song of the Summer but which is entirely inescapable on pop radio right now, which is Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me”. It is a song I enjoy and will definitely be a signature song of 2024, but that doesn’t mean that I think it is the Song of the Summer. I don’t have any real reasons why I never considered it a contender, but it’s my list so I can do what I want. I also just wanted to through it in here so that I could write about how weird I find it that all of a sudden after hearing it non-stop for months and months without there being a radio edit all of a sudden one of the local pop stations has been playing a radio edit version of it that bleeps out the word “chains” from the phrase “whips and chains”. It seems like an odd choice and even more bizarre given how many thousands of times they played that song with no bleeping of that word.\n\nLast Week Delight 7/1/2024\n\nWhew halfway through the year already. Time is flying.\n\nUsually I’m freezing in my office no matter whether it’s summer or winter. I feel like the heat is never high enough when it’s winter and the AC is too cold when it’s summer. Last week for some reason it was perfect, and I was comfortable without having to put on a cardigan or wrap myself in a blanket. Today we’re back to normal.\n\nThere is a house in my neighborhood that has a row of tiny skeletons sitting on a low brick wall in front of their porch. They dress them up and create little seasonal tableaus for them. I love it. Last week I noticed they had a new summer tableau for them that they hadn’t used before. Usually in the summer they’ve just had a little sunglasses on, but this summer they have bathing suits and some of them are sitting in little inner tubes while others are holding tiny surf boards. They also have some little tiki bars in the middle of them. I love it!\n\nWe’ve been getting quotes to replace our windows and I bizarrely wound up in a conversation about social emotional learning with one of the guys. He’s the one who brought it up. I definitely wasn’t expecting that to be a topic that someone who has been hanging windows for 25 years would be talking to me about and super in favor of.\n\nAnd apparently I have a lot of musical delights this week, but not that many other ones.\n\nObviously seeing Sarah McLachlan in concert last week was a delight.\n\nI heard the song “Break It Down Again” by Tears for Fears last week. It’s such a good song, but it’s a Tears for Fears song that I almost never think about and is not one of the handful that usually still makes it to the radio on occasion.\n\nI am 100% sure I have written about my feelings for the song “We Built This City” by Starship on this blog before. I feel like more than once even, but I’m too lazy to do a search and find out. Anyway, I also heard that song this week. I loved it when it was popular in the 80s and have never lost my love for it even though it is kind of cheesy and very much of its time and has become entirely maligned by society since then. I don’t think it deserves the scorn it gets, but it doesn’t matter because I love it no matter what.\n\nI watched the movie I’m Not OK on Max over the weekend. The final scene is set to the song “Tarzan Boy” by Baltimora. It did fit the scene well, but it also felt like an odd choice given that the movie is set in present day to throw a song from the 80s in there. I have always liked that song though and am never unhappy to hear it, so I appreciated its use.\n\nSarah McLachlan at Merriweather Post Pavilion\n\nI always feel like I’m a bit of a weirdo because most people’s taste in music sort of freezes after their mid-twenties and for the most part they just keep relistening to the same music that they were into during their teens and early-20s. There’s tons of research to support this. It’s not just anecdotal. I have never fit into that scenario. I could barely even name you what the popular music was at the time. I enjoy hearing random songs here and there that take me back, but I don’t actively seek out music from that time. Sarah McLachlan is probably the one exception to that. I still actively choose to listen to Sarah McLachlan and treated myself to a copy of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy on vinyl for my birthday last year. That album would be in my top 10 albums list even though no individual song on it would come anywhere near my top 10 songs.\n\nSo when Sarah McLachlan announced she was going to do a 30th anniversary tour for Fumbling Towards Ecstasy I was super excited. First I was perplexed though because I couldn’t figure out how it was the 30th anniversary since I firmly associate this album with my life in 1997. Looking into it turns out the album was released in Canada in 1993 and in the United States in 1994, but it had a slow build and was in fact at the height of its popularity in 1997. So there you go. I even had a number of friends who rarely ever go to concerts who wanted to go with me for a change because see above about people being most interested in the music of their high school and college years. I saw her once when I was in college sometime in the 1997/1998 time frame. It was the only big name concert I went to in college though I went to a bunch of club shows. I was thinking it was the only time I had seen Sarah McLachlan live, but then I remembered last night that I did in fact go to the 2010 revival of the Lilith Fair where I would have seen her play though I remember absolutely nothing about it. I should have seen her play with Brandi Carlile at The Gorge a couple years ago, but stupid COVID.\n\nFeist opened the show. I don’t actually know much of Feist’s music, pretty much only her most popular song “1,2,3,4”. So that was in fact the only song that she played that I knew. She was fine, but I’ve never been able to get into her music that much.\n\nSarah McLachlan was fantastic. She played for 2 hours and 10 minutes, which these days is a long set though probably what she was used to playing back in the day when she was actually touring. Her voice has held up really well despite being in her mid-50s. I guess taking years off from performing helps a lot with that. I was a little surprised at some of the notes she could still hit. She honestly still looks and sounds the same as she did 20 years ago. Good for her.\n\nThe first half of the show she did a mix of songs from her albums that followed Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. She of course sang all her hits as well as some songs that I wasn’t that familiar with from the last non-Christmas album she released in 2014. Then the last half of the show she performed Fumbling Towards Ecstasy straight though. She actually did a costume change before she starting playing Fumbling, which amused me a little. She switched from the flowy sundress she was wearing to a flowy lace lined tank top and a pair of black leather pants. I don’t know why artists choose to dress themselves in super hot things when it’s hot outside. At least it wasn’t blazing hot like the night before, but it wasn’t like it was cold outside either. There was of course a fun audience sing-a-long during “Ice Cream”. I was particularly impressed that she could still hit those high notes in “Fear”. I also enjoyed hearing her tell stories about the songs that I had never heard before. It was a great performance and a great way to relive some of my musical memories of the past.\n\nSince I go to a lot of concerts I’m always intrigued by the audiences at different shows. This one was firmly middle aged people close to my age. I didn’t even see many people with kids though I saw a few. It was unsurprisingly a majority female audience. At least around us no one really seemed to be drinking. I saw a few people walk by me with beers, but for the most part everyone just seemed to be drinking water or soda. This is what happens when you get a bunch of middle aged women out on a weeknight and they know they have to get up to deal with kids and work in the morning. And at least in the pavilion where we were people were definitely committed to enjoying the seats that they paid for. People got up and stood during a couple of songs, but for the most part everyone stayed seated for the whole show. I was trying to decide if the two women in front of us just completely left right when she was starting to play Fumbling or if they decided to move to the lawn where they might be able to stand and dance without feeling like they were blocking everyone even though I’m not sure how much people on the lawn were up either. It’s not like Sarah McLachlan’s music is super upbeat and danceable.\n\nAnyway, it was a wonderful outdoor summer concert. Pretty much all I could have asked for."
