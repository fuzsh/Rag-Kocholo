        "text": "The breakout Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan features a lot of interviews from people who ~actually~ know Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.\n\nSo much of the couple’s story has been publicly told by “sources” or Buckingham Palace officials, making this a refreshing change.\n\nIn the mix is Abigail Spencer, who actually had a (reported) tie to Harry before Meghan even met him. But who is Abigail Spencer, exactly? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAbigail and Meghan were friends before they co-starred on 'Suits.'\n\nAbigail is an actress, and actually starred on Suits with Meghan. (She played lawyer and partner Dana Scott.) But Meghan and Abigail were friends before that. Abigail told ET that the two met at an audition more than 10 years before her friend married Prince Harry.\n\n“I saw her and was like, ‘Who is this gorgeous girl?’” Abigail recalled. “She was just so stunning and there was just something about her, and that's how we met.” The two became friends and stayed close while filming Suits. Abigail even contributed to Meghan’s former lifestyle blog, The Tig.\n\nShe was the first person who knew that Meghan was dating Harry.\n\nAbigail spoke in the documentary about Meghan telling her about her new flame, and her description of the event is everything.\n\nAccording to Abigail, Meghan spilled the tea at Bergdorf Goodman in New York in September 2016.\n\n“She was like, ‘I think I met someone and I'm in love,’” Abigail said in the series. “I could feel everything vibrating. I was screaming because I could feel it was different.”\n\nAbigail attended Meghan and Harry's royal wedding.\n\nAbigail was photographed going into the church where Meghan and Harry got married, holding hands with Priyanka Chopra, another famous friend of Meghan’s.\n\nShe's been coy about what the wedding was like, but she did drop a hint as to what she gave Meghan as a gift. \"I think what [Harry and Meghan] would love is [for people] to donate to one of the charities that they are involved in,\" she said to ET.\n\nShe's from Florida.\n\nAbigail was born in Gulf Breeze, Fla., according to her IMDB bio. Fun fact: She and Meghan share the exact same birthday of Aug.4, 1981, per IMDB.\n\nIs Abigail Spencer related to Princess Diana?\n\nMaybe? Princess Diana’s maiden name was Spencer, and Abigail told Parade that it’s possible that they're distantly related.\n\n“My grandmother swears [we are], but I’ve never done any digging,” she said. “I did meet a lot of Spencers [in England] and I am a Spencer, so who knows?”\n\nWhat other TV shows has she been in?\n\nShe started her career on All My Children in 1998, and has since been on a slew of big-name shows, including Grey’s Anatomy, Mad Men, and How I Met Your Mother.\n\nIn the early years, before her acting career really took off, \"I felt like the best thing I could do was start writing for myself,\" she told the Wrap. \"So I started writing and I ended up selling a pilot during that time.\"\n\nShe’s currently working on a comedy series for NBC alongside Jon Cryer and Donald Faison.\n\nWho is Abigail's partner?\n\nAbigail is divorced from Andrew Pruett, and the two share a son named Roman who is currently 14.\n\nShe takes her son to work sometimes.\n\nIn 2018, she told Parade that her son joins her on set sometimes.\n\n\"I got him to come to set the other day and he wanted to go do hair and makeup with me,\" she said. \"So he got a wig put on, and bruises and cuts put on his face... So when he came to set, I was like, 'Okay, we’ve got to put you to work.' He sat by a video village. He looked like a little savant director with his headphones on. He gave his direction and his feedback after the take.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
