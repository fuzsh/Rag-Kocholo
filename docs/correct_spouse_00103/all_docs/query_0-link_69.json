A review of the series in Variety called Spencer \"prodigiously talented\" and that she played \"a character whose major personality traits are 'smart' and 'plucky.'\" A review in Deadline.com said that the show was a waste of Spencer's talents. The New York Times wrote that \"Abigail Spencer is good as Lucy, the spunky historian who is the show's central character.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nSpencer married Andrew Pruett in 2004 and filed for divorce in February 2012.[26] The couple have a son named Roman.\n\nFilmography"
