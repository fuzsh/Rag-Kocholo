The information can be found in Madison County IL where they were in 1806. There is even a plaque at the courthouse in Edwardsville, IL concerning Martin Pruitt. They were around Moro, Wood River, Bethalto, and Fort Russell townships. There is a Pruett family cemetery in Madison COunty IL somewhere in Section 28 of the county and on the \"old Pruett Homestead\".

Solomon did not have a child named Solomon Jr. We know this in that Solomon supplied various family information to various Madison County IL publications during his lifetime. In one (I believe it was the Maditon County Gazetteer, a small book), he tells about his siblings and when the were born plus gives the names of his own children who they married and how many children each had. No where in the list of children is there a Solomon.\n\nSolomon Pruitt was an icon in Madison Co IL during his lifetime and when publishers wanted information on the life and times in the county they went to him. Of course, he was also in the militia (Black Haw War) and his family was highly involved with the Wood River Massacre in 1814 or 1815.Also have noticed that some Pruitt researchers are trying to say that Martin's grandfather is Samuel Prewitt. Another cousin descendant from Martin via son Solomon did research back in the 1950's and he found where Martin's grandfather was Henry Pruet who married Mary Ross. I have found evidence of Henry and Mary's marriage in Henrico Co VA where the Pruitt's were and where William (father of Martin) was born. Also many have Martin's lifespan screwed up. Son Solomon clearly stated that his father died in 1844 in his 92nd year of life. If the first year of life is from your birth to your first birthday, then Martin would have been 91 years of age plus months and days. Thereby, death in 1844 would placed his birth in 1752 as he would have been 92 years of age in July and he died in February. Where people are getting a birth year of 1748 or 1759 is beyond me. With this in mind, I take their information lightly and only use as a guide until I find evidence to support it or denounce it.\n\nDebbi Geer\n\nMore About SOLOMON PREWITT:\n\nResidence: Madison Co., Illinois\n\n34.JACOB PRUITT PRUETT6 PREWITT (WILLIAM PRUITT PRUETT5, SAMUEL PRUITT PRUETT4, JOHN PRUITT PRUETT3, THOMAS PRUITT PRUETT2, JOHN PRUITT PRUETT1) was born 1765 in Rowan Co., North Carolina, and died May 14, 1845 in Alabama.He married NANCY AGNES RICHEY M.

UNKNOWN.He married (2) RACHEL VININGHAM 1762.He married (3) JANE PARROTT Abt. 1770.She was born Abt. 1755.\n\nNotes for DAVID II PREWITT:\n\n[PruittMurrell.ged]\n\nPREWITT\n\nMuch of the information here comes from Phyllis Hickey-Kay, Carl Edward Bird and the referenced Order Book.\n\nRICHARD PREWITT1\n\nDAVID PREWITT2, I\n\nDAVID PREWITT3, II\n\nHe was born in the 1746-51 time frame, perhaps in Virginia. He died after 6 Jan 1806 and probably before 1820 (C.E. Bird states he flourished 1746-1820). The finding of two Davids, Senior and Junior, on the 1807 Knox tax rolls and only one on the 1808 roll probably means that this David died about 1808.\n\nThe Virginia Census of 1787, supra, p.635 shows a David Prewit in Franklin County with 2 horses/mules, 5 cattle, no blacks and no white males between 16 and 21. He was not tithable. There was also an Elijah, but because of his age he cannot be the son of David. He may have been in Henry County, Virginia in 1779 and he served in the Revolution as a member of the Virginia Militia. Crozier's Virginia Military Records, 975.5 V817m, pp. 185-189, lists Henry County Militia called to aid General Greene at Hilsborough, North Carolina on 11 March 1781, preparatory to the battle at Guilford Court House. David Pruit was in Tully Choice's Company.\n\nIn 1787 he received a grant for 115 acres in Greene County, North Carolina (now Tennessee) on the Little Chucky River. North Carolina Land Grants in Tennessee 1778-1791, supra, p.41.\n\nA David Prewit appears, without land, on the 1802 Knox tax rolls. On the 1803 Knox tax rolls a David appears with 150 acres on the Cumberland and another David appears with no land; abbreviated references after their names may mean Jr. or Sr. On the rolls for 1804 is a David,Sr., with 150 acres and Jr. with no land. In Knox County Order Book A at page 104, by virtue of actual settlement he is given, as Prewit, a certificate for settlement on 150 acres on 7 November 1803; at page 179 he is paid a bounty on 5 Nov 1805 for killing a \"woolf\"; and at page 189 is recorded a 6 January 1806 entry for 300 acres. He is in the 1810 Knox census. It is probably this David that appears on the 1807 tax roll with 150 acres on the Cumberland River, with one white male above 21, one male between 16 and 21 and three horses/mules.\n\nHe married Jane Parrott, in 1770 according to Bird. They had five children.\n\nDavid Prewitt4. It is highly unlikely that David I ever made it to Kentucky, so the Jr. must be a son of our David, though no source has mentioned a David. On 23 February 1839 a warrant was issued in Whitley County for a David Pruit, on the grounds that he had abandoned his unnamed wife, leaving her destitute and a charge on the county, but it is not certain this was our David. A David appears on the 1807 tax roll with one white male and one horse/mule, and on the 1808 tax roll with one white male and two horses/mules; this is probably Junior.\n\nJohn Prewitt4. Married Judith DeMoss on 10 Aug 1805, in Knox County. Kozee, Pioneer Families, supra, p.72; Tri- County Knox-Laurel-Whitley Early Marriages, supra, p.74. A John appears on the 1807 Knox tax roll with one white male. A John is listed on the 1808 Knox tax roll with 114 acres on Rockcastle, one white male above 21 and one horse/mule. He is possibly the John Prewitt who held 50 acres on Brian Creek, surveyed 1-2-1833. Whitley County Survey Book 1-169.\n\nElijah Prewitt4. Our ancestor.\n\nWilliam Prewitt4? (nearby in 1810 census but not in the 1795 census.)\n\nUriah Prewitt4? He appears on an 1807 Knox tax roll and a 1808 tax list.

He is shown on the Pickens County, AL, listing of the Census with his wife Lydia, age 20, and three children: William, Martha, and Thomas Jefferson. Dudley Prewitt, Jr., is on the Pickens County AL Census for 1830 and 1840. My other information matches yours, based on secondary sources. Thomas Jefferson Prewitt, b. March 1850 in AL, was my great-grandfather. He married Mary Martha Vickery and had the following children: Hilliard Dudley \"Dud\", Walter, Minor, Annie E., Rufus Mortimer, Claude, and Cora. Most of this family moved to Texas, via Mississippi where Rufus was born, by the beginning of the 20th century. Richard A. Prewitt provides the following note on James Fields Prewitt: \"...b. jan. 12, 1831 Pickens Co., Ala.; married Martha Ann merchant; served in Woods Regt., Co. D, 23rd Tex. Cav in the Civil War; died at San Antonio, Bexar Co., Texas on June 25, 1921.\" Another note says that Dudley Marion Prewitt, b. 1835 in AL, was the first Sheriff of Clay Co., Texas. Also, it is possible that both \"Fields\" and \"Dudley\" are an old family names from the lines allied with the earliest Prewitts in Virginia and South Carolina.\n\nMore About DUDLEY JR.

There are many “common threads” that lead me to believe that the children of Dudley Prewitt, Jr. (father of Dudley Marion Prewitt) are related to one of my ancestors, Rebecca Guin. These include: Tuscaloosa and Pickens Counties in Alabama, land patents in Pickens County, the Palmetto township, Confederate veterans, Bosque County, Texas and feminine given names Rebecca and Otta.\n\nThere is an interest on my part in learning more about a “Rebecca” probably born in Pickens County, Alabama about 1840(she would have been approximately eleven years old). My interest in the family stems from trying to learn more about my great grandmother, Rebecca Guin. She was the wife of Zimri Guin, a farmer and Confederate veteran of Pickens County, AL. They were married about 1859 and are listed in the census 1860-1880. . I have most recently learned that her maiden name was probably Pruett/Prewitt.\n\nMore About REBECCA PREWITT:\n\nResidence: Valley Mills, Texas\n\nvii. POLLY A. PREWITT, b. 1841.\n\nviii. MOSES F.
