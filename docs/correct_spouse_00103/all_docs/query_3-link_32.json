        "text": "Spencer spoke on camera about how she watched Markle being broken down by the barrage of bad press. The actress revealed it was she who led the charge to break the narrative around the duchess, speaking to People magazine about the Meghan Markle she knows and holds dearly.\n\nMeeting Meghan, before Harry\n\nSpencer and Markle, both 41, properly bonded when they started filming Suits together in 2011. Spencer played the part of Dana “Scottie” Scott, a former flame to Harvey Spencer (Gabriel Macht).\n\nThe fellow American actress says she and Markle connected even more when they started working together. They also discovered they were born on the same day, in the same year, just hours apart.\n\nProtecting her pal\n\nOver the past few years, there have been glimpses of the duo’s seemingly close relationship. Speculations of their tight friendship were cemented when Spencer attended the royal wedding in 2018.\n\nWhen asked by Entertainment Tonight what a good gift idea was, she said the couple would love it if people donated to one of the charities they were involved in. In 2020, she was spotted hiking with Harry and Meghan on Canada’s Victoria Island and was also at Meghan’s New York baby shower.\n\nHer own successful Hollywood career\n\nMum first\n\nSpencer was married to businessman Andrew Pruett in 2004 and split in 2012, reported TMZ. The couple have one child together, 14-year-old Roman. In 2018, she told Parade that Roman has joined her on set.\n\nIn 2018, she told Parade that Roman has joined her on set, adding, “He got a wig on, and bruises and cuts put on his face.” She said he was big on baseball and she spent a lot of her time at baseball games with him.\n\nA nature lover\n\nSpencer told Parade that she grew up on the beach and in the desert. She said her grandparents owned horses but her family were also surfers. She said they would often take long road trips to find the perfect beaches. Spencer said growing up they’d stop and meet new people in communities and that’s the culture she still enjoys.\n\nA businesswoman is her own right\n\nSpencer is the owner of Country Line Florals, a flower delivery service. It was launched as a mobile flower truck and subscription service in 2020.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the company is a homage to her late father, surfing legend Yancy Spencer. He died while visiting her for Valentine’s Day in 2011. She told the publication that he went for a surf at County Line one day, and then called her to say, “I’m having a heart attack. Call 911. I love you and pray.” He died 10 minutes later.\n\nShe added that the outpouring of love after his death touched her.\n\nIt was when a friend dropped off flowers on her doorstep that her love affair with floral arrangements began."
