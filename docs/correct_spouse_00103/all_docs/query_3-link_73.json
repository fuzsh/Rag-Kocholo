        "text": "She started dating Josh Pence in 2012, when she was still married to Andrew. There was no known arguments or physical violence which led to the separation. When she was dating Josh, her marriage was almost over and it was not considered to be infidelity. Andrew was also not seen with any girl when he was married, to be rumored to be his secret girlfriend. Andrew never talked about why things did not work out with his former wife. Abigail also did not talk a lot about the separation. The sources near to them said that the news was a shock to them, too.\n\nThe relationship between Abigail and Andrew after the separation is not known. Though there are rumors that they were not able to be together in the same place, there were no evidences to prove the same. The separation settlement was smooth and there are no details about the spousal support and child care support. It was stated that there was no battle, in terms of financial settlement. Some people state that both of them waived their rights for spousal support and thus, there weren’t ugly battles during the separation.\n\nShe never talked about her boyfriend either. Though they are seen in a lot of parties and public places, together, there are no details about how things are moving between them. There are no details about whether they are living together or not. She does not talk about her personal affairs to the media. Josh is also silent about his relationship with her. Andrew’s personal data are not available on the internet. He is not known to be dating anyone, as of now. Thus, it is considered that he is taking his time to start back the game, from the beginning. He remained silent for all the rumors and comments about his life with Abigail. There are no rumors about her having a relationship with anyone, behind Joah’s back."
