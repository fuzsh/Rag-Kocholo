        "text": "Burn, baby, burn\n\nChelsea on Fire turn up the emotional heat\n\nby Brett Milano If I wanted to play a dirty trick on the band Chelsea on Fire, I'd put them up in front of a crowd of punters who'd just gotten out of a Red Sox game. They are, shall we say, not the ideal group for that demographic: Sox fans aren't known to dig bands who play tense, angular punk rock with lyrics about internal breakdowns and sexual rage. Especially when that outfit is fronted by two women who don't put on a whole lot of sweet airs and don't have a whole lot of hair between them.\n\nThe band played such a bass player Amy (she hates her last name and couldn't think of an alias, so it's just Amy). \"And the spy overheard a conversation between two guys. The first one said, `Is that a man or a woman up there?' And the second one said, `I don't know, but he's sure cool.' What we usually see in our audiences is a gaping mouth and a vacant look in the eye. I don't think they're bored or else they'd leave; but they're never moving.\"\n\nI wasn't bored when I caught the band at the Middle East recently, though I had no trouble figuring that Amy and singer/guitarist Josey Packard are women, and that drummer Adam Simha isn't. I heard a band who specialize in cathartic outbursts but put some thought and some chops into it; there were enough song structures and dubwise rhythms to set you up for the moments of screaming and clatter. In terms of sonic terrain and intensity level, I'd compare them to Come or the Zulus, both of whom gave a subversive twist to the basics of loud-guitar rock, and whose songs had their share of subtext if you were looking for any.\n\nChelsea on Fire's self-released homonymous album (whose release was celebrated with a gig at T.T. the Bear's Place this week) captures some of what I heard, though it cries out for better production (the guitar sound needs to be thicker, and more of Packard's vocal subtleties need capturing). It's still one of the better local debuts in recent memory, its material charged with venom and nuance. The songs get relatively accessible (\"Mean Things\" is punkish and punchy at three minutes). At the other extreme is \"Lake,\" basically an unedited jealousy rant that gives Packard seven minutes to say everything people are usually too timid to say in rock songs (\"I meant to tell your girlfriend something/I meant to tell her that I loved you/Shit!!\").\n\n\"That was the one I was really embarrassed about,\" Packard admits. \"It was something I shouted out at one of our jam sessions -- that was the time I had to make the big long speech about how I love and trust you guys.\" She's addressing her bandmates over beers at the Middle East. The band members seem a well-matched set of personalities, with Packard and Amy (who displays a habit of waving table knives at her mates) as the volatile characters and Smith playing the straight man. \"I definitely feel like Derek Smalls,\" he says -- invoking the Spinal Tap equation of two band members being fire and ice, the third being lukewarm water.\n\nChelsea on Fire have been together for a little over a year. Their members hail from outfits with embarrassing names like Celestial Spirits in Bondage and Desired Effect -- the latter being a Zulus cover band Simha and Packard played in for one gig at MIT, doing the Down on the Floor album in its entirety. (\"I spent a week asking Malcolm [Travis] how he did everything,\" Simha recalls.) Meanwhile, Packard played with a couple of outfits she'd rather not name. \"I probably would have killed myself if those bands had gotten off the ground. It was death, it was bad. Meanwhile I felt like a powder keg, like I was ready to explode. I had something I wanted to do and I wasn't sure what it was, but I didn't want it to be candy.\"\n\nSaving the crass question for last: why do they have so many songs dealing with sex? \"Because everybody knows that's all women think about,\" Packard shoots back.\n\nPOP TIMES THREE.\n\nIn view of its hardcore-heavy booking schedule lately, the words \"pop at the Rat\" roll off the tongue about as easily as, say, \"classical at the Hard Rock,\" \"bowling at the Middle East,\" or \"Tiny Tim at Man Ray\" (oops, that last one just occurred). But next Thursday finds the Rat hosting a strong triple bill -- the Gravy, the Jigsaws and Shoemaker, all introducing new or forthcoming CDs -- that shows where local pop has been and where it may be going.\n\nIf the Gravy's name doesn't sound familiar, that of their frontman, ex-Cavedogs singer/guitarist Todd Spahr, ought to. Spahr got burned last time around with Merang, a harder-edged combo that never quite caught on (though they were a good band, dammit). So Spahr's launching his new project quietly; yet he's recently wrapped up an album with producer Jon Lupfer at Q Division. (Lupfer's also working with the other two Cavedogs spinoff groups, the Brian Stevens Band and Poundcake.) Instead of putting the album out locally, he's looking for a national contract first.\n\nSo what does it sound like? \"I'll let you figure that one out. I just want to get this album out and play all over the place, instead of just doing the local thing again. The locals are all done with me by now -- but hey, they love me and that's beautiful,\" the affable guitarist says, keeping cynicism in check. The Gravy's album includes one unrecorded Cavedogs song (\"Hangman's Pop\") and a couple of Merang leftovers, but most of it was written since that band broke up. \"We threw some four-track recordings on for good measure -- and I can already hear people saying, `Oh, so you're doing the Guided by Voices thing.' But the rest is pretty high-tech; we actually used digital sources on it.\"\n\nSome bands get excited when they sign to major labels, but I'd bet that the Jigsaws are even more pleased about the contract they've signed. Their second album, Wicked Alternative, is the first legit release on Yellow Dog, a European label better known for putting out some of the most desirable Beatles and Beach Boys bootlegs (hence no label address is listed on the disc). Jigsaws singer/bassist Tom Brewitt easily qualifies as one of the most devoted Beatles collectors in town; when last we spoke he was commiserating over the massive disappointment that was \"Free As a Bird.\"\n\nThe first Jigsaws disc, last year's Cereal Toy, wore its mid-'60s influences on its sleeve; on Wicked Alternative, they're at least hidden a little further up the sleeve. Thus the title is only partly a joke. Take '60s pop values, add some lyrical irony, a bit of distortion, and some tricky chord changes -- and you get something akin to modern rock. That equation serves the Jigsaws well. Their hooks hit more often than they miss, and the lyrics have moments of wiseass wit (including this local-radio reference on \"I'm in a Band\": \"Left the suburban nest/I'll even make it cleaner/I've got to have respect/At least from li'l Juanita\"). Elsewhere one can hear as many traces of recent Sebadoh as mid-period Beatles. The Jigsaws still have a British Invasion heart, but this time it's there in spirit rather than in blatant imitations. (Even the 34-minute bonus track -- yep, the entire album played backward -- is a homage of sorts. Think of it as \"Revolution 9\" times four.)\n\nAs for Shoemaker's Engage (a six-song EP on Badger), suffice to say that Big Dipper live -- sort of. Ex-Dipper drummer Jeff Oliphant is at the helm, and the disc sounds uncannily like his former band. (Dipper singers/guitarists Gary Waleik and Bill Goffrier make appearances; Waleik also produces.) The opening track, \"Edith Row,\" starts off with a cappella harmony Ã  la Fairport Convention -- just the sort of musical trick Big Dipper might have pulled -- and the old band's trademarks are all here: vocals that land halfway between nerdy and wide-eyed, lyrics heavy on clever non sequiturs, guitars that jangle and bounce, melodies that jump out of your glove just when you think you've caught them. Ordinarily I might knock Shoemaker for being a throwback, but Big Dipper were a terrific band whose sound could use some reviving (even their worst album, Slam, holds up pretty well), and the songs on Engage have some of the same magic.\n\nTHE EMBARRASSMENT.\n\nSpeaking of Big Dipper, speaking of influential bands with a local connection, and speaking of smart and twisted songwriting, I'd advise anyone with an ear for local history to check out the Embarrassment's Heyday, a two-CD anthology on the Jersey-based Bar/None label. True, the Embarrassment weren't from Boston, but they sounded as if they should've been. Their songs had that \"too smart to be punk, but too weird to be anything else\" quality that would have endeared them to local crowds. And two members of the Kansas-based band wound up here -- Bill Goffrier with Big Dipper, and drummer Woody Geissman with the Del Fuegos (and currently Laurie Geltman).\n\nThe double CD gives a near-complete picture of the band (save for a 1990 reunion album), with a disc of studio tracks and a disc of live, drunk, and otherwise odd material (their habit of learning unlikely cover tunes -- here it's Led Zep's \"Immigrant Song\" and Michael Jackson's \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\" -- predated the Replacements by a couple of years). And there are two versions of the band's greatest hit, \"Sex Drive\" -- a churning, nervous-energy-driven tune about one particular dilemma: \"He yells, `Hey, get outta my way/I haven't had any sex all day.' \" Timeless sentiments indeed.\n\nCOMING UP.\n\nLots of options tonight (Thursday): rock heroine and Middle East employee Mona Elliott introduces a new project, Victory at Sea, at the Mid East upstairs while Roadsaw and Bison play downstairs. Papas Fritas, Trona, and Jack Drag are at T.T. the Bear's Place, Ashera and Jeff & Jane are at the Rat, and Lars Vegas play Johnny D's . . . Big Catholic Guilt play Mama Kin tomorrow (Friday), Laurie Geltman's at the Phoenix Landing, and the reggae band UNI are at the Western Front . . . On Saturday, the Magnetic Fields hit the Middle East, Deby Pasternak and Memphis Rockabilly play the Tam, Laurie Sargent's at Johnny D's, Underball and promising popsters Resolve are at the Rat, and Tree and Jocobono are at Mama Kin . . . Turkish Delight play Mama Kin on Wednesday; Darling Picassos and Huck are at Axis."
