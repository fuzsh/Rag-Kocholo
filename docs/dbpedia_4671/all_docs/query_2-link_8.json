        "text": "Cultures around the world have a myth or folklore about a trickster, but it is rare that several different cultures share the same image of a trickster. From California to the Appalachian mountains various Native American cultures adopted Coyote as the trickster. Sometimes a creator, other times a destroyer, both wise and foolish, Coyote (or Old Man Coyote) is a popular tale. Today we’ll be looking at some of these stories and exploring how they came about.\n\nTricksters, Coyotes, and Oral Stories\n\nTricksters are found across the planet’s folklore, mythology, and religion – we have discussed two of them on this blog, Anansi the Spider from Akan folklore and Loki of Norse mythology. Tricksters can use dishonesty and tricks for their own benefit, the benefit of others, maliciousness, or simply fun. Br’er Rabbit of African-American folktales were used as inspiration for enslaved Africans and their descendants for undermining slavery; whereas the Greek god Hermes uses tricks to poach his brother Apollo’s cows but gives the world cooked meat and the lyre. Meanwhile, we can see the snake in Abrahamic religions that tempts Adam and Eve into eating the forbidden fruit as being a trickster – using his guile he tempts Adam and Eve into going against God’s rules forever casting humans out of Paradise. Tricksters serve as both cautionary tales and tales of admiration. As argued by Lewis Hyde, tricksters needs relations with people and institutions that have ‘traditions that can manage the odd double attitude of both insisting that their boundaries be respected and recognizing that in the long run their liveliness depends on having these boundaries regularly disturbed.’ Tricksters therefore serve as a way to test the fabric of society, if pushing it too far it often backfires on them.\n\nCoyote appears in folk tales and myths in many different cultures found across the United States and Canada, and to a less extent Mexico. These stories were also told orally so were subject to change and adaptation with each telling which created a diversity in Coyote tales even among the same culture. One story I will tell today is from the Apsáalooke, (the Crow people), where Old Man Coyote creates the world until deceived by his brother Coyote into bringing war to humanity. That is just one version of the story – others have Old Man Coyote willingly introduce war to humans with his brother, others have Old Man Coyote and Coyote being the same being, and others Old Man Coyote did not make the world. The oral nature of the Coyote tales also likely allowed it to spread, especially as many of the cultures who had Coyote myths were semi-nomadic and had the ability to take their stories over a wide distance in a short period of time. This would have resulted in a blending and adapting of Coyote stories.\n\nThe question now arises, why is Coyote a coyote? Again, reflecting the uncertainty of tricksters, Coyote’s being varies from tale to tale. In some he is a man called Coyote, others he is an anthropomorphic coyote, and others he is a literal coyote. Sometimes he is Old Man Coyote, sometimes he is just Coyote. As argued by Barry Lopez, coyote often represents human values placed onto the figure of coyotes as actual coyotes often do not represent the bold and brash personality of actual coyotes. However, coyotes have many qualities that make them good trickster figures – smart, very adaptable, and opportunists. Many people encounter coyotes when they are scavenging through their garbage or raiding farms placing the coyote in an ideal position to be turned into a trickster. For a similar reason for other Native American cultures the raven became a trickster representation and both also were seen as being associated with death. Both animals are opportunists eating things they’ve caught but also scavenging making them a liminal being – one close to the living and the dead. Coyote, like many tricksters, is a contradictory one – wise and foolish, helper and hinderer, kind and devilish, close to the living and the dead.\n\nCoyote as Creator\n\nThis is one version of the Apsáalooke creation story, and if you read the post on Creation stories you will find similarities with others from around the world. Millennia ago there was just water and in the water floated Old Man Coyote. Despairing one day of his loneliness he spotted two ducks bobbing on the water. He asked the ducks if they could dive underwater and see if they could spot anything, so they did. After a while, in which Old Man Coyote became very worried, the ducks returned – one carried mud and another a stick. Old Man Coyote took the mud and the sticks from which he moulded the land. Plants soon grew and stop them from drying out he carved lakes and rivers to keep them hydrated. Old Man Coyote was still lonely so from his thought he created a brother; as he was Old Man Coyote he named his brother Coyote. Coyote said that Old Man Coyote had done a good job so far, but the world was a bit boring, so together they created forests, valleys, mountains, and plains to liven up the world. As they did this they chatted and from their discussions the animals began to pop into existence – wolves and coyotes and woodpeckers and bears and deer and bison and snakes and butterflies, and finally humans. Old Man Coyote was happy with the world, but Coyote was a troublemaker. He riled up Bear to challenge Old Man Coyote, but a quick curse forced Bear to sleep in her den during the winter. Old Man Coyote was especially proud of humans but life was hard for them – having no fur they shivered in the cold and with no fangs they could not hunt. Coyotes new plan was hatched. He said that humans were struggling and maybe giving them weapons humans could hunt buffalo for food and to make clothing. Old Man Coyote agreed and introduced humans to weapons falling into Coyote’s trap. He had taught humans how to argue and now armed they learnt war. Old Man Coyote despaired, seeing how his beloved humans were now killing each other.\n\nWe see in this version of the tale the contradictory nature of Coyote rationalised – there is both the wise Old Man Coyote and the malevolent Coyote. However, as mentioned, this is just one version of the tale. In some versions Old Man Coyote and Coyote are in agreement to bring war to humanity; in others it is just Old Man Coyote; and others there is no Coyote, instead there was a creator called either Akbaatatdia or Iichíkbaalee. Crow creation tales are not the only ones that Coyote appears in. The Dine, (Navajo), of the US Southwest also feature Coyote in their creation story, the Dine Bahane. This story features humans travelling through four worlds before arriving in the Fifth World where we live today. The First World was a dark place covered by water, and alongside the first humans there was Wise Coyote and Angry Coyote (although in many versions they are the same being). Coyote, whether intentionally or not, helps humans reach the other worlds, but not always without issues. In the First World Angry Coyote’s arguments ends up bringing witchcraft into the world and later steals the children of Water Monster. However, this turned out to be a good plan as Angry Coyote plugged the gap between the Fourth and Fifth Worlds preventing Water Monster from coming through.\n\nIn the Dine Bahane the two aspects of Coyote emerge – one of selfishness and spite, but one of guidance and ingenuity – regardless if there are one or two Coyotes. I want to discuss two other stories where Coyote helps create humans showing the dichotomy of the figure. The first comes from the Nez Perce. Once there was a monster who was swallowing animals whole so Coyote decided to fight back, but as a weak animal he had to use his brains. He called to the monster and made friends with him, so one day Coyote casually asked the monster if he could see inside the Monster’s stomach. Bemused, the monster agreed and Coyote went inside to check that the rest of the animals were fine. Then he killed the monster from the inside. Elated that the monster was dead Coyote said he would create a new people: humans. Carving the monster into four he threw the pieces away and where it landed a new group of humans emerged. Finally he wiped the blood on his hands on the ground from which the Nez Perce themselves emerged. This ‘Creation through Dismemberment’ shares many similarities with other Creation stories, with it also highlighting Coyote’s ability to use tricks for the benefit of others. Meanwhile, the Miwok people of California had a Coyote creator that was selfish. All the animals decided to make a new one, the human, but all disagreed about what traits humans should have. Puma wanted humans to be quiet hunters like himself; Bear said humans should be super strong like him; Deer said they should have antlers like his; and Raven said they should have wings for soaring. The animals agreed to make sculptures and tomorrow they’ll bring the sculptures to life. While the other animals slept Coyote, wanting humans to be in his image, smashed the other sculptures leaving just his, so humans ended up being like Coyote – sneaky and wily. As William Bright has argued, humans projected our own characteristics onto Coyote so this version becomes very literal. It also shows how humans have survived – like coyotes we have had to use our brains to survive.\n\nCoyote the Fool\n\nOften Coyote stories serves as lessons and deals with intimate topics that elsewhere may be seen as being taboos. Sex, greed, and scatological humour often are represented in these tales. One such comes from the Lipan Apache. One day Coyote saw some juicy berries so he went to eat them. “Don’t eat the berries,” the bush they were growing on said, “They’ll give you bad gas.” Coyote ignored the bush’s warning and ate the berries, but soon the ‘find out’ from his ‘fuck around’ soon caught up to him. With a belly ready to burst Coyote spotted Crow tucking into a dead buffalo. Despite his stomach ache Coyote’s greediness eyed up the buffalo so he called over to Crow. How about a game? Whoever could poop the farthest wins the buffalo. Although Crow was saving the buffalo for his family he agreed to the challenge, and he pooped as far as he could. Then Coyote let his bowels open and he naturally won. An upset Crow begged Coyote to have some of the buffalo, and feeling ‘kind’ Coyote let him have the meat around the ribs, joints, and eye sockets. While Coyote is to be ridiculed, eating berries he knew to be dangerous, the true moral lies with Crow. His gambling cost his family showing the error in making bets. Coyote also comes afoul of poorly thought of bets. In another story from the Cochiti Old Man Coyote looked at Old Woman Beaver with lust so made a bet with Old Man Beaver – whoever caught the most fish could have sex with the other’s wife. Coyote thought his wiliness would trump Beaver’s knowledge only to find out he could not catch anything. Beaver and Old Woman Coyote had sex, and Old Woman Coyote boasted that Old Man Beaver was better in bed than Old Man Coyote. These stories further highlight different concepts of what is taboo. For Europeans these stories crossed too much into the private of bodily fluids and sex, whereas different ideas of what is a taboo in Cochiti and Apache culture meant it was simply risqué.\n\nCoyote in Life and Death\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Coyote myths often place themselves in the liminality between life and death. We have already encountered stories where Coyote created life, but the Blackfoot had a story where Old Man Coyote and Old Woman Coyote create the process in order to create life: they were the first to have sex. Old Man Coyote and Old Woman Coyote were commenting how similar they were except that their bags were different. Old Man Coyote had a penis in his and Old Woman Coyote had a vagina. They agreed that putting these items between their legs was best as it would not get in the way. Then, Old Woman Coyote noticed that Old Man Coyote’s penis could go in her vagina. Sex was then created, and during the first love making the two discussed the role of men and women in Blackfoot society. Unlike the other Creation stories here Coyote literally made the process for life to happen, but it also shows the casualness to sex. Anthropologists recording Blackfoot stories in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century were embarrassed and actually edited or omitted from these stories references to sex. Here Coyote was a taboo, but for the Blackfoot he was simply creating a natural part of the world reflecting his own characteristics – his own inquisitiveness.\n\nWith life, there is also death. Coyote stories have also discussed how he brought death into the world. Among the Maidu Coyote appeared in several stories. When humans were first made by the Earth Initiative Coyote laughed at the look of them which the Earth Initiative chastised him for. Coyote lied saying he had never laughed bringing lies into the world. Later, when humans were fully made the land was a paradise which irked Coyote. He decided that death needed to come into the world so he got Rattlesnake to hide behind a stone while he organised a race. When someone passed Rattlesnake was to jump out and bite them. However, the person at the front of the race was Coyote’s own son who became the first person to ever die when bit by Rattlesnake. A distraught Coyote wept the first tears regretting ever bringing death to the world. A tale from the Zuni resembles the Greek story of Orpheus and Eurydice. One harsh winter Coyote’s wife died and his howls of anguish was heard by all. It was so sad that a death spirit visited Coyote and made a deal. If Coyote followed his exact words then his wife would return to the land of the living. He did. The spirit took Coyote to the spirit realm and told him, “Make your journey back with your wife. Do not touch her, not even a hair for six days.” Coyote begun the way home with the spirit of his wife following behind. However, before the six days were over, whether it was love, lust, or both, Coyote tried to embrace his wife who vanished in his arms. The spirit appeared and told him, “You ignored my rules so you will never see your wife again, and the dead will remain dead.” While there are stories where Coyote maliciously brings death to the world but these stories are interesting for making Coyote a victim as much as a perpetrator. His own short-sightedness resulted in the loss of his loved ones, and we are meant to feel his pain. After all, Coyote is meant to represent us – we are short-sighted and guided by emotion in the face of life and death.\n\nCoyote, Gifts, and Ego\n\nIt is a common trend in trickster stories that using their wits they bring something positive to the world as either a by-product or intentional from their actions. Coyote is no exception from this. In tales of how humans got fire it is often Coyote who is the one to steal fire on behalf of humans. Among the Wasco in Oregon Coyote does some good but for selfish reasons. One night Coyote bumped into six wolf brothers looking at the night sky. Asking what they were looking at the youngest wolf told Coyote that there were some animals up in the sky which they could not get to. Bold Coyote announced he could get them to the animals, pulled out a bow and arrow, and fired into the air. The arrows stuck into the sky and each other forming a ladder which the seven canids could climb. After a long climb they reached the sky where the animals turned out to be two bears. The wolves went to play with the bears while Coyote admired the view. He descended his ladder taking each arrow with him. When back on the ground he looked up seeing the wolves and bears were now stars in the sky – they were the Big Dipper. He called over Meadowlark and asked him to spread the news of what he has made. Coyote made the Big Dipper, one of the most iconic constellations that we use to navigate, and he wanted people to know it was his doing. His benevolent act was only done to benefit his own ego and to get adoration.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoyote is a figure as diverse as the peoples of the Americas. Most of the stories we have discussed today come from the west of what is now the United States and Canada, but Coyote tales are found as far east as the Appalachians. Just these western stories alone cover a huge area encompassing hundreds of cultures and nations. Oral stories further allowed Coyote to diversify, but all through that time Coyote represents us. He can be compassionate, egotistical, impulsive, a thinker, and a fool. With each telling he shifted and changed, and that is the point of Coyote. A trickster never remains the same, much like human society.\n\nBibliography:\n\nDavid Leeming, The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009)\n\nLewis Hyde, Tricksters make the World: Mischief, Myth, and Art, (New York, NY: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1998)\n\nWilliam Bright, (ed.), The Coyote Reader, (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1994)\n\nBarry Lopez, Giving Birth to Thunder, Sleeping with his Daughter: Coyote Builds North America, (New York, NY: Open Road, 2013)\n\nScott Leonard and Michael McClure, Myth and Knowing: An Introduction to World Mythology, (New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2004)\n\nMourning Dove, Coyote Stories, (Caldwell, ID: Caxton Printers, 1934)\n\n‘Old Man Coyote Makes the World’, Mythology Podcast, (29/03/2022)"
