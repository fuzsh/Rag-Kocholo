        "text": "The overground railroad? What is that?\n\nRecall a bit of history to begin the journey to understand.\n\nIn slavery times in the United States, there was the underground railroad.\n\nThat was a network of people, places, signs, and signals that helped enslaved people making their way toward freedom.\n\nThat was always a dangerous journey.\n\nThere were songs such as Follow the Drinking Gourd that contained maps and directions in their lyrics.\n\nThere were marks and signs along paths in the woods.\n\nThere was the call of the barred owl, which Harriet Tubman used to let people know she was there to guide them on their way, to escape as she had done.\n\nThere were people who gave food and shelter along the underground railroad .\n\nWhen slavery ended, danger for people of color who took to the road for work, for family, and for any of the many reasons one might travel did not end, though.\n\nAs car travel became more common, travelers of color might drive through the night because they could not find a place that would allow them to stay. Day or night, African Americans traveling for work, family, or any reason one might take to the road traveled with fear of rejection and embarrassment at being denied basic services at best and of violence for just being on the road, at worst.\n\nVictor Hugo Green, a black postal worker in Harlem, saw a need. He published the first Green Book in 1936. It was published almost annually though 1966. What was The Green Book?\n\nMy colleague Alison had an encounter with The Green Book and other African American travel guides. Take a moment to follow the link and learn what she experienced\n\nThough there were some changes in format and scope over the thirty year period, “What never wavered throughout the life of The Green Book” writes Candacy Taylor in her book Overground Railroad, “was the courage and security it afforded black people, so they could pack up their cars and go.”\n\nAuthor and photographer Candacy Taylor was drawn to make her own journey. Her exploration of the Green Book stories and legacy led to her to travel thousands of miles across the United States.\n\nWhat she learned along the way to visiting former and still active Green Book sites and businesses led her to write the book Overground Railroad: the Green Book and the Roots of Black Travel in America.\n\nOverground Railroad is part history, part social commentary, part reflection, part memoir, part geography.\n\nThe Overground Railroad will take you on a journey through history and place that may well leave you thinking about race, travel, and community in the United States with perspectives you had not had before.\n\nTaylor structures Overground Railroad chronologically, tracking editions of the Green Book and events in history through eleven chapters that begin in the 1930s when travel by car was the main way of getting around and continue up through the 1960s with consideration of the effects of integration and wider ranges of travel.\n\nWherever you were going and in whatever part of the United States you found yourself in these years, if you were black travel was likely to be uncertain if not actively dangerous. Taylor is also well aware that this is still the case.\n\nStories from Taylor’s late stepfather added to her understanding and serve to illuminate parts of her journey. She also includes material from many interviews, findings from her research, contemporary and historic photographs, and her own reflections.\n\n“The Green Book deserves special attention now because our past and current policies shape how not just black people but people of all races and gender identities navigate this country,” Taylor writes.\n\nDuring her research for Overground Railroad Taylor herself navigated big cities and small towns, highways, boulevards, backroads, and byways.\n\n“Photographing Green Book sites gave me a greater understanding of and insight into the guide that I never would have had merely reading it in my office at Harvard University,” she reflects on her writing of Overground Railroad. “On the road I felt the tenor of a bygone era and saw a new cycle of grit and survival along Matin Luther King Boulevards and in the dilapidated houses on dirt roads across the nation.”\n\nShe found Spanish colonial style hotels, businesses along busy city streets, boarded up bars, still thriving restaurants, and places where only a sign reminds of what was once a safe place for black travelers to stop for the night. She found music venues which had begun to welcome integrated audiences, and beaches which had kept strict segregation lines even when swimmers entered the water.\n\nShe also found sundown towns. These are places where people of color could not enter or be in a town beyond sunset. There were towns, cities, and villages like this all across the country, though they were found especially in the north and west. It was a major concern for black travelers that they not get stranded in or near a sundown town.\n\nThat was something, for instance, that could happen if you were black and driving along that freeway symbol of American freedom and adventure on the road west, Route 66.\n\nRoute 66 has been the subject of songs, a television series, and nostalgic t-shirts. The road ran from Chicago to Los Angeles, bringing drivers through both city and countryside.\n\nIt wasn’t safe for black travelers. When the Green Book was first published in the 1930s half of the counties Route 66 ran through had sundown towns. By the 1950s thirty-five percent still did, along with state segregation laws in place in six of the eight states as far west as Arizona.\n\nWhether you know this sort of history or not, The Overground Railroad is likely to open you to new ideas, places, stories, and connections among them. One such idea Taylor points up is that The Green Book was a part of the fight for human rights; for people to travel and be respected wherever they go.\n\nIn one appendix to Overground Railroad Taylor offers brief, thought provoking graphics with ideas about what we can do now to help in this cause. There is also a bibliography and a select guide to some of the sites Taylor visited.\n\nEarly in Overground Railroad Taylor wrote about her perspective on what connects past and present.\n\n“This is not a book about this history of road-tripping and black travel,“ Candacy Taylor writes. “It’s more of a pilgrimage toward understanding a country so blinded by symbolism that it can’t or won’t tackle the pervasive, relentless forces that created the environment for the Green Book to thrive in the first place. It is a book that I hope will show how we got here and why, after all this time, we still have so far to go.”\n\nFrom the verses of Follow the Drinking Gourd to the Green Book editions to The Overground Railroad, each generation offers maps for the journey.\n\nSide note: in case you are wondering about the drinking gourd in the song, that’s a reference to the big dipper, which points to the north star in the night sky.\n\nPhotograph of winding road by MaxWdhs from Pixabay\n\nPhotograph of man on street by Engin Akyurt from Pixabay\n\nFane Hotel photograph and sundown town sign are Illustrations from The Overground Railroad."
