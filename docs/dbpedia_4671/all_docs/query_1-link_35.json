        "text": "March 2 was the anniversary of one of Wilt Chamberlain?s monumental feats ? shooting 87 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nYou don?t think that?s monumental? Don?t you know that Chamberlain was the worst free-throw shooter in pro basketball history? In a 14-year career that at one time doubled as the NBA record book and still produces awe (he averaged 50.4 points and 25.7 rebounds per game in 1961-62), the Big Dipper shot an embarrassing 51.1 percent from the free-throw line. To illustrate just how bad that was, Shaquille O?Neal, considered the worst free-throw shooter in today?s NBA, has a lofty 58.1 career free-throw percentage.\n\nBut on March 2, 1962, at Hershey, Pa., in front of 4,124 fans, Chamberlain hit 28 of 32 free throws as the Philadelphia Warriors defeated the New York Knicks, 169-147. Oh, yeah, March 2 is better-known for another Chamberlain anniversary. That was the game in which he scored 100 points, on 36-of-63 shooting.\n\nBeing a sports history/stats geek, I was reveling in the Chamberlain anniversary when my thoughts logically turned to Don Nelson.\n\nThe highlight of Nelson?s distinguished 14-year playing career was hitting the winning basket in Game 7 of the 1969 Celtics-Lakers NBA Finals, the last of the epic Chamberlain-Bill Russell duels. What a beaut of a shot it was, too. Final seconds of a close game. The ball was swatted out of John Havlicek?s grasp, Nelson picked it up ? at the free-throw line, no less ? and shot. The ball hit the back of the rim, went straight up ? three or four or five feet ? and straight down through the hoop.\n\nSo, that?s the Chamberlain-Nelson link, but from there naturally I contemplated Nelson?s NBA career.\n\nI can?t tell you how sick I am of so-called NBA fans in general and Warriors fans in particular bashing Nelson ? essentially because the Warriors stink this year but there?s an awful lot of age-ism attached to the criticism of Nelson. He?s old. So what? Connie Mack managed the Philadelphia Athletics when he was 88. George Halas was 72 and still head coach of the Chicago Bears. OK, OK. Mack and Halas also happened to own their teams, but the point is just because you?re eligible to collect Social Security doesn?t mean you can?t lead a team. Maybe I like Nellie because he and I are sexagenarians ? although it must be pointed out I?m on the low end and he?ll be a septuagenarian in two months. But I think my defense of Don Nelson has more to do with his being a living sports treasure working right here in the Bay Area.\n\nHe was a key player on five NBA championships with the Celtics, titles that span the Red Auerbach-Russell era and the Dave Cowens-Jo Jo White era. Now this guy is closing in on Lenny Wilkens? record for most NBA coaching wins. Cynics say that all it proves is that Nelson has been around an awful long time. And then they say at the rate the Warriors are going, if he stays around much longer he?ll also pass Wilkens for most coaching defeats.\n\nBut it?s a big deal to have coached in five decades. Critics point out he?s never coached an NBA champion, never even coached in the Finals. Show me any of his teams that you think should have played for or won an NBA title. You can?t. Nelson?s best teams were talented, yes, but they were supreme overachievers, too. And exciting to watch. Even his bad teams are exciting to watch.\n\nHis coaching resume doesn?t include championships, but it?s loaded with resurrections. With the Bucks in the late 1970s, the Warriors in the late ?80s, Dallas in the late ?90s and again with the Warriors in 2007, he took moribund franchises and turned them into winners, often big winners, including playoff runs, sometimes deep playoff runs. That takes talent.\n\nIn the 14 seasons between Nelson?s two coaching stints with the Warriors, no coach led them to the playoffs, no coach even led them to a winning season. Not Rick Adelman, not P.J. Carlesimo, not Garry St. Jean or Dave Cowens or Brian Winters or Eric Musselman or Mike Montgomery. Coincidence? I don?t think so.\n\nRobert Rubino can be reached at robert.rubino@pressdemocrat.com or 521-5261."
