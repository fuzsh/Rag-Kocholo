        "text": "It's been an incredibly challenging yet rewarding semester for me. Organizing four courses to maintain a great GPA, working on two distinct data analytics projects in the departments of Applied Statistics and the CSCE team. I am very grateful to have such a supportive professor and program supervisor, Dr. Robert Steiner, who showed me the path and had my back through this journey. Also, I have Worked on data analytics projects, learned to adapt to diverse environments and exceed expectations, and participated in prestigious tech competitions - it's been a whirlwind of activity and learning. I'm excited to share that our efforts have yielded remarkable results. Alongside my teammate Fidel Gutierrez, we clinched third place in the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Software Innovation Competition, a collaborative initiative with the United Nations focusing on their Sustainable Development Goals. A heartfelt thanks to Dr. Rajaa Shindi and Dr. Alex Barsi Lopes for this opportunity and guidance. This journey has been more than just about winning. A platform where we proved our pluck against some of the brightest minds. Also, participating in the NSF Hub: Southwest Region IdeaLaunch Regional I-Corps for Development & Leadership Program taught me the crucial skill of identifying core issues and crafting effective solutions. This achievement marks a significant milestone in my academic and professional journey. I'm grateful for all the support and the invaluable learning experiences. Looking ahead, I'm energized to embrace more challenges and opportunities that lie in my path. #AppliedStatistics #AIS #UnitedNations #Innovation\n\nLiverpool John Moores University You have thought me resilience, consistent upskilling ,determination and good faith in this journey I begun on August 2022. I am happy to say that I am at the last lap of it. Though challenging and demanding,I proclaim that it is worth the investment. I am glad I took chance of the opportunity. I am excitedly pulling through the hurdles and await the amazing benefits thereafter. Hello Friends, you can also give it a chance. The learning will challenge but make you if you do not give up.

The different levels indicate the level of difficulty of a particular qualification. The Level Descriptors outline the general outcomes of learning at SCQF levels under five broad headings: - knowledge and understanding; - practice (applied knowledge and understanding); - generic cognitive skills (e.g. evaluation, critical analysis); - communication, numeracy and IT skills; and - autonomy, accountability and working with others. The Descriptors allow broad comparisons to be made between qualifications and learning and allow learners, employers and the public in general to understand the range of skills and learning that should be achieved at each level. #scqf #qualification #practice #levels #communication #evaluation #accountability #ITSkills #employer #accountability"
