        "text": "Toupees, tube tops, car keys, cameras, cares, inhibitions and\n\nlunch: A great many things are routinely lost on roller\n\ncoasters, as demonstrated by the items found on, near or beneath\n\nthe tracks. These include glass eyes, hearing aids and--in\n\nquantities that resist rational explanation--underpants.\n\n\"False teeth,\" adds Ronald V. Toomer, revered architect of\n\napproximately 80 coasters worldwide. \"They find lots of false\n\nteeth.\" In 1994 workers at the Blackpool Pleasure Beach\n\namusement park in England drained the reflecting pool beneath\n\ntwo coasters and found 25 sets of false teeth.\n\nAt historic Kennywood amusement park in West Mifflin, Pa., a\n\npassenger on SkyCoaster parted with his false teeth, and they\n\npitched, in a hideous parabola, into the french fries of a\n\npassing pedestrian. \"That person showed up at the lost and\n\nfound,\" park spokesperson Mary Lou Rosemeyer reluctantly\n\nconfirms, \"with the teeth\"--how shall she put this?--\"still in\n\nthe fries.\" While the disembodied dentures did not, alas, devour\n\nthe fries, they remain a coffee-stained symbol of what man will\n\nsacrifice to stir, if but for a moment, his jaded viscera.\n\nThis is a story about roller coasters, so throw your arms in the\n\nair. Not literally, mind you. \"I am told,\" Toomer says with\n\nneither pride nor embarrassment, \"that someone's prosthetic arm\n\nwas found under one of my rides.\"\n\nWorkers at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, last year collected\n\nmore than $11,000 in loose coins and bills shaken free from\n\nriders of the park's 12 roller coasters (there are now 13). But\n\nthe most valuable item ever found on a coaster belonged to\n\nEmilio Franco. In 1949, Franco, a West Virginian coal miner\n\nrendered mute by a nervous disorder, rode the terrifying Cyclone\n\nat Coney Island in Brooklyn and found, for the first time in six\n\nyears, his voice. He screamed on the Cyclone's second descent\n\nand, upon disembarking at the platform, spoke his first words\n\nsince World War II.\n\nWhile those words were I feel sick, a larger point remains.\n\n\"Riding a roller coaster,\" says Phil Hettema, who designs these\n\ndiabolical devices for Universal Studios theme parks, \"is a way\n\nof telling yourself, I'm alive.\"\n\n\"We are living in a roller-coaster Renaissance, a second Golden\n\nAge,\" says industry analyst Paul Ruben, North American editor of\n\nPark World magazine. The 50 most popular amusement parks in\n\nNorth America hosted a record 242.9 million visitors in 1998,\n\nvastly more than the attendance at all NBA, NFL, NHL and Major\n\nLeague Baseball games combined, and a number close to the\n\ncountry's population.\n\n\"There's an industry saying: A carousel is the soul of an\n\namusement park, but a roller coaster is its heart,\" says Jim\n\nFutrell of the National Amusement Park Historical Association\n\n(NAPHA). The roller coaster is the vital organ, the\n\nindispensable engine, the Great American Scream Machine (or\n\nGASM), and it has never been more robust. There are about 1,000\n\nroller coasters operating in the world. While the U.S. alone had\n\nmore than 1,500 in the late 1920s--the end of the first Golden\n\nAge--by the mid-'70s they had dwindled to 145. Think about that:\n\nTwenty years ago, the U.S. roller coaster was nearly extinct.\n\nYou may now lift your jaw off the ground with both hands.\n\nMercifully, the late '90s have been a time of unprecedented\n\nconstruction, and Futrell says 520 coasters, more than half the\n\nworld's total, are operating in the U.S. About 80 coasters\n\nopened around the world last year, and at least 90 more have\n\ndebuted in 1999, including one in the Micronesia Mall on Guam.\n\nAll of them do unspeakable things. \"The idea is to knock your\n\nsocks off,\" says Hettema, whose newly opened Incredible Hulk\n\nCoaster at Universal Studios Islands of Adventure in\n\nOrlando--with its catapult launch into an immediate 180-degree\n\nbarrel roll--also tends to knock off bikini tops.\n\nSwimsuits are recommended on the amphibious BuzzSaw Falls\n\ncoaster, which opened last month at Silver Dollar City in\n\nBranson, Mo. There are 27 varieties of roller coaster, including\n\nstand-up coasters such as The Riddler's Revenge, at Six Flags\n\nMagic Mountain in Valencia, Calif. More preposterous\n\ncontraptions are on the drawing board, such as the coaster set\n\nto open next March at Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara,\n\nCalif., on which passengers will lie back and be propelled into\n\nconcentric circles of hell. In Utah there is one prototype for a\n\ncoaster on which the car itself turns, and another for a ride on\n\nwhich the car races through the threads of a cylindrical track\n\nlike an Archimedes' screw.\n\nAlready running is Superman The Escape, a \"shuttle coaster\" at\n\nSix Flags Magic Mountain. Though it's not everyone's idea of a\n\nroller coaster, it meets the technical definition: It uses\n\ngravity and rides on rails. Superman is not a continuous loop\n\nbut an L-shaped track on which passengers are shot down a\n\nstraightaway and then up a tower before pausing and falling\n\nbackward to earth, all in 30 seconds. Its 15-passenger car\n\ntravels from 0 to 100 in seven seconds, exerts 4.5 G's on the\n\nrider and is roughly equivalent to taking off in an F-16 from\n\nthe deck of an aircraft carrier. At the top of the tower, 415\n\nfeet above suburban L.A., riders experience six seconds of\n\nweightlessness before plunging back whence they came.\n\n\"You can let go of your sunglasses at the top of the ride,\" says\n\nMagic Mountain spokesperson Andy Gallardo, \"and they will remain\n\nthere, floating in front of you.\" Trouble is, you can \"let go\"\n\nof anything at the top of the ride, and it will remain there,\n\nfloating in front of you.\n\nIf we are living in a roller-coaster Renaissance, the U.S. is\n\nits Florence. This nation's technophilia and leisure worship\n\nhave joined in unholy matrimony to sire an astonishing\n\nsubculture of coasterdinks and rollerwonks, men and women for\n\nwhom roller coasters have become a lifestyle--or something more\n\nclosely resembling life itself. This is not the case with Rich\n\nRodriguez, a 40-year-old man who last summer spent 22 hours a\n\nday for 47 consecutive days on the Big Dipper at Blackpool\n\nPleasure Beach, breaking his own Guinness world record for\n\nmarathon coastering. \"I do it in a Lindberghian spirit of\n\nadventure,\" says Rodriguez, an earnest Brooklyn native who is a\n\nteaching assistant in the communications department at Miami.\n\n\"I'm not one of these roller-coaster obsessives who can tell you\n\nwhat kind of bolts are in the track.\"\n\nRodriguez is eager to distinguish himself from the likes of\n\nDreadlock Jim, a multiply pierced, Rasta-haired coastermane from\n\nSaginaw, Mich., who practically lives in his car. Dreadlock Jim\n\nreportedly drove 80,000 miles and visited 101 amusement parks in\n\n1998. He has the elusive quality (and personal hygiene) of\n\nBigfoot. \"I saw him in Tampa yesterday, on Montu at Busch\n\nGardens,\" a 22-year-old rollerphile named Walt Breymier told me\n\nlast January in Orlando as we stood in the construction site\n\nthat would become Islands of Adventure.\n\nThe theme park wouldn't open for another four months, but the\n\nIncredible Hulk was up and running, and, as Breymier explained,\n\n\"There's something called ERT: Exclusive Ride Time.\" It is a\n\nprivilege extended to people like Breymier, of the\n\nVirginia-based Coaster Zombies club, whose members were given a\n\nno-expenses-paid trip to Orlando to test-ride the Hulk in\n\nexchange for the good word of mouth they were certain to spread.\n\nFor some Zombies it was the second trip to the construction site\n\nin as many months. \"I came down at Christmas and watched Hulk\n\nrun from the outside,\" said Sam Marks, 41, a customer service\n\nmanager at Pitney-Bowes in Arlington, Va., which is \"24 miles\n\nfrom Six Flags America,\" where Marks spent at least 28 days last\n\nsummer.\n\n\"I'm giving up a week's worth of work to be here,\" said\n\nBreymier, a night supervisor at the Target department store in\n\nBel Air, Md., who lives within a five-hour drive of 15 amusement\n\nparks. \"I took a bus here to save money. I've been serious\n\nhardcore since '97.\"\n\nAmerican Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) has 5,800 members, not all of\n\nwhom are serious hardcore. \"Our membership runs the gamut from\n\ncasual to 'coasters are my life,'\" says ACE public relations\n\ndirector David Escalante, whose surname suggests ascents and\n\ndescents and whose signature ends with a line drawing of a\n\nroller coaster. (Such salutations are common among coastermanes:\n\nPark World's Ruben ends telephone conversations by saying, \"Go\n\nwith gravity.\")\n\n\"I'm a gawker,\" a man in a sweatshirt bearing a likeness of the\n\nroller coaster called Raptor told me at Raptor's home, Cedar\n\nPoint, on the banks of Lake Erie in Sandusky. The Raptor fan, it\n\nturns out, was not a gawker but a GOCCer, a member of the\n\nGreater Ohio Coaster Club. GOCCers and ACErs and Coaster Zombies\n\ngather in cyberspace to discuss first drops and chain lifts and\n\nlateral G's and brake runs and camelbacks, and to exchange\n\nintelligence about new coaster construction.\n\n\"You'll read, 'There are reports of a truck carrying blue track\n\nnorth on I-95: Where is it going?'\" says the Zombies' Marks.\n\n\"It's kind of pathetic. Some people have broken into parks just\n\nto look at the construction of a new coaster.\" He pauses, lost\n\nin thought beneath a beige Gilligan hat with a blinking red\n\nlight and the souvenir pins of myriad coasters. \"By the way,\"\n\nMarks says of such break-ins, \"I didn't really do that once,\n\nwhen I was 16 years old.\"\n\nFor 18-year-old Jeff Tolotti, coasters are not life itself. \"I\n\nalso enjoy free falls,\" he says of rides like the Cedar Point\n\nPower Tower, in which human cargo is hoisted in a harness up a\n\n24-story obelisk, then dropped to earth in 2.3 seconds.\n\n\"And I like really big, really fast spinning rides,\" says\n\nBreymier.\n\n\"These are known in the industry,\" says Kennywood's Rosemeyer,\n\n\"as Spin-'n'-Barfs.\"\n\nTo barf, on the serious-hardcore coaster circuit, is to lose it,\n\nand nearly everyone loses it eventually. \"It takes me a lot of\n\nrides,\" says Marks, \"like 27 consecutive at Six Flags St.\n\nLouis.\" When a Los Angeles helicopter pilot--a Vietnam combat\n\npilot turned traffic reporter--loses it on Viper at Magic\n\nMountain, as happened a couple of years ago on the world's\n\ntallest looping coaster, what chance do the rest of us have?\n\nWhile marathon champion Rodriguez was living in the sixth car of\n\nthe Big Dipper in Blackpool last summer, a press photographer\n\njoined him to take his portrait with the coaster in motion. As\n\nRodriguez said \"Cheese,\" the photographer lost it. Says\n\nRodriguez, who has an almost courtly way of speaking, \"I've also\n\nhad regular passengers get ill near me.\"\n\n\"I lost it on Akbar yesterday,\" Breymier said in Orlando last\n\nJanuary, referring to Akbar's Adventure Tours, a \"simulator\n\nride\" at Busch Gardens in Tampa. \"There's one scene where you're\n\nriding on a camel, up and down, up and down on a tour through\n\nEgypt, and I just lost it.\" He said this in the manner of a\n\nfullback facing the press after a fumble. Then Breymier boarded\n\nthe Hulk for a 10th straight time, before his ERT expired.\n\nWhat, exactly, is the appeal? Several enthusiasts told me that\n\nriding a coaster is better than sex. In some cases, this was\n\nclearly a matter of conjecture. In others, evidently, it is sex.\n\n\"The back car is for your heavy-metal S&M crowd, people who like\n\na lot of whip action,\" says Ruben, to which we can only say\n\nthat, in addition to ERT, there is something called TMI: Too\n\nMuch Information.\n\nGerald Menditto practices abstinence. He has operated the Coney\n\nIsland Cyclone for 25 years but has, astonishingly, ridden the\n\ninfernal thing only twice. Menditto is what is known in the\n\ntrade as a chicken. Ask coaster architect Toomer, whose 80 rides\n\ninclude the superlative Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point, to name\n\nhis favorite machine, and he responds with a good, long chuckle.\n\n\"You mean to ride?\" says the 69-year-old former mechanical\n\nengineer. \"Oh, I don't ride 'em. Oh, no. Haven't for years. I\n\nget motion sickness real bad. The bigger ones, I get sick as a\n\ndog on those.\"\n\nThese coasterphobes play a vital role in the amusement-park\n\necosystem. \"They're a good thing,\" says Ruben, who has ridden\n\nmore than 4,000 miles on 525 coasters. \"Someone has to hold our\n\nchange.\"\n\n\"We don't laugh at people who are afraid of snakes,\" says Brian\n\nNewmark, a Harvard-trained psychologist in suburban Boston, \"but\n\nwe laugh at people who are afraid of roller coasters.\" We should\n\nnot. Newmark, who has treated coasterphobia, cites the case of a\n\n55-year-old man married for several years to a rollerweenie\n\nwhose passion he desperately wanted to share. \"It was an\n\nobstacle in his life,\" says Newmark. \"The question with a phobia\n\nis, Does it interfere with daily function? When parents are\n\nfearful, children sense that and become habitually fearful of\n\nthe world around them.\"\n\nCoasterphobia has not always been an irrational fear. When the\n\ninfamous Crystal Beach (Ont.) Cyclone opened in 1927, a\n\nfull-time nurse was employed at the unloading platform. The\n\ncoaster had a 97-foot first drop into an 85-degree right turn.\n\n\"Hats, purses, combs and false teeth all flew out on that turn,\"\n\nsays Ruben, 62, who grew up in nearby Niagara Falls, N.Y.\n\n\"Riders were thrown into their seatmates and cracked their\n\nribs.\" By the end of the Cyclone's run, in 1946, more people\n\nwere watching this ghoulish spectacle than participating in it.\n\nSuch a coaster, alas, couldn't leave the station in today's\n\nlitigious society. \"When a new ride opens up, you get a lot of\n\nlawsuits,\" says Toomer. Retired from Utah's Arrow Dynamics Inc.,\n\nToomer spends much of his time in trials, testifying about\n\ncoaster safety. \"We have 200 million riders a year on coasters\n\ndesigned by our company,\" says Toomer. \"When someone comes to me\n\nand says our ride hurt his back, I say, 'Would you believe that\n\n15 million people rode it before you did, without a problem?'\"\n\nIn the past 11 years, there have been 11 nonoccupational\n\nroller-coaster-related fatalities in the U.S., few of them\n\ninvolving mechanical malfunction. Last September at Paramount's\n\nGreat America in Santa Clara, Calif., a Mexican tourist lost her\n\nhat on an \"inverted coaster,\" the kind that speeds its suspended\n\npassengers, feet a-dangle, around a high-speed glorified\n\ndry-cleaning rack. The woman's 24-year-old husband didn't speak\n\nEnglish and thus didn't heed warning signs when, after finishing\n\nthe ride, he entered a restricted area to retrieve the hat. He\n\nwas struck in the head and killed by the dangling feet of\n\nanother rider, a 28-year-old woman, who suffered a broken leg.\n\nThe point is, while you might have your face bloodied by the\n\noccasional dive-bombing goose (as happened to Fabio this spring\n\nin the front car of Apollo's Chariot at Busch Gardens in\n\nWilliamsburg, Va.) or be stuck upside down for two hours\n\nawaiting rescue by the fire department (as happened to 23\n\npassengers on Demon, at Six Flags Great America outside Chicago,\n\nin April 1998), riding a roller coaster is much safer than\n\nriding a bicycle. \"We all look for things that push the\n\nboundaries of our daily existence,\" says Hulk designer Hettema.\n\n\"Roller coasters are a safe way to do that. Riding a coaster is\n\na more practical way to feel alive than jumping off a cliff.\"\n\nMore practical than a cliff dive, coastering better approximates\n\nmountaineering. Rodriguez had \"surreal visions\" during his\n\n47-day Blackpool marathon last summer. \"You can experience a\n\nkind of natural high while riding,\" confirms Ruben.\n\nEnthusiasts speak of rides the way climbers talk of the Seven\n\nSummits. On every coastermane's \"lifetime list\" are Dragon Khan\n\n(at Port Aventura, near Barcelona) and Monte Makaya (at Terra\n\nEncantada, in Rio de Janeiro). Both have eight inversions, the\n\nworld record. Oblivion (at Alton Towers, in England) makes an\n\n87.5-degree drop into a 100-foot hole in the ground. \"I've\n\nheard,\" one rollerphile told me lasciviously, \"it's terrifying.\"\n\nThe names of the world's great modern coasters are conceived to\n\nheighten such terror: Megaphobia, Mind Eraser, Exterminator,\n\nAlpengeist and--at Parc Asterix outside of Paris--Tonnerre de\n\nZeus, which means, sounds and feels like the thunder of Zeus.\n\nNone of these, however, have the exotic, elusive appeal of\n\nFujiyama, King of Coasters, at Japan's Fujikyu Highlands fun\n\npark in the northern foothills of Mount Fuji. \"Fujiyama is the\n\none I want,\" Tolotti told me, as if it were a white whale. It\n\nmight as well be.\n\nFujiyama is the world's tallest traditional complete-circuit\n\ncoaster, 259 feet at its high point. The ride's toupee-ravaging\n\nfirst drop of 230 feet is also a complete-circuit record. And\n\nFujiyama shares with the formidable Steel Phantom at Kennywood\n\nthe Guinness mark for the fastest complete-circuit coaster, with\n\na top speed of 82 mph.\n\nWhat's more, I resolved not merely to ride Fujiyama but also to\n\ndo it immediately after speed-eating bowls of soba noodles with\n\nanother Japanese phenomenon: Hirofumi Nakajima, the Black Hole\n\nof Kofu, the former world champion of competitive eating, a man\n\nwho once consumed 24 1/2 hot dogs in 12 minutes, as if feeding\n\npencils into an electric sharpener.\n\nIn the days leading up to my trip, I thought many times of\n\nhurling. But I also thought of Kipling:\n\nIf you can meet with Gluttony and Gravity\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\n\nIf you can ride with Kings--of coasters--and not lose it;\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\n\nAnd--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!\n\nThere is no clown. That is the first panicked thought of every\n\nnoodle-gorged gaijin in line at Fujiyama: There is no cutout\n\nclown bearing the traditional disclaimer, YOU MUST BE TALLER\n\nTHAN ME TO RIDE. What if I am too tall, thinks an anxious\n\nAmerican who is nine inches taller than the average Japanese\n\nmale. All of the recorded warnings played in the serpentine line\n\nto board Fujiyama--and these warnings are manifold, believe\n\nme--are, unhelpfully, in Japanese. All the signs are in kanji.\n\nThat changes when you at last approach the loading platform\n\nafter 90 angst-inducing minutes in line: Adjacent to the\n\nplatform is a small door painted with the leering cartoon\n\nlikeness of a barnyard fowl. This is your last chance to exit\n\nbefore you are swept, like a cork on a fast river, onto\n\nFujiyama's malevolent rails. The sign on the door is in English.\n\nIt reads: CHICKEN GATE.\n\nThe Chicken Gate thumbs its beak at current coaster etiquette,\n\naccording to which parks attempt to allay, not inflame, a\n\nrider's anxieties. Near the Hulk at Islands of Adventure,\n\npassengers can pick up a pamphlet titled Anxious about Riding.\n\nNo such luck at Fujiyama, where the only sound on the platform\n\nis the metallic echo of the train's lap bars locking into place.\n\nIt is the sound of finality, like lockdown at Leavenworth.\n\nWith a temperamental lurch, the train pulls away from the\n\nplatform and begins its inexorable climb, 235 feet up the first\n\nhill. The angle of ascent leaves the rider in roughly the same\n\nposition--and disposition--as a dental patient. The only sound\n\nnow is the ratch-ratch-ratcheting of the chain lift. It recalls\n\nto me the rattling chains of Marley's Ghost.\n\nWhen at last you crest the first hill, there is a pause, long\n\nenough to let your knuckle hair stand at attention as you take\n\nin the view. Twenty-five stories above the Fujikyu Highlands,\n\nyou are staring straight at Mount Fuji, and it is\n\nbreathtaking--so perfect a mountain that it almost seems a\n\ntheme-park contrivance, like the Matterhorn at Disneyland. You\n\ncan only gape at it and whisper, \"My God, what a lovely....\"\n\nThen the bottom falls out of your world.\n\nThe first drop at Fujiyama is, in essence, a plane crash. When\n\nyou pull out of the near-vertical 20-story plunge, your car is\n\ntraveling about 80 mph toward a course canopied with wooden\n\nbeams, which appear to be no more than six feet above the track,\n\noffering sufficient clearance only to the average Japanese,\n\nwhose culture promotes something called Tall Poppy Syndrome, in\n\nwhich heads that jut above the crowd must be cut back down to\n\nsize. Only later do you learn that Tall Poppy Syndrome is a\n\nmetaphor and that these low beams are a calculated optical\n\nillusion known in the coaster trade as Headchoppers. Indeed, a\n\nsimilarly terrifying specimen exists on Shivering Timbers in\n\nMuskegon, Mich.\n\nBut in the moment, as you hurtle toward presumed decapitation,\n\nyour thoughts turn to many things: To the vindictiveness of\n\nJapanese engineers, to the criminally negligent absence of\n\nclowns and to Hirofumi Nakajima, with whom you imprudently\n\nengaged in an eating contest scant hours earlier. But before you\n\nknow what hasn't hit you, you are suddenly--to your profound\n\nrelief--coasting on small camelbacks into the brake run leading\n\nback to the station. You have survived Fujiyama. You have not,\n\nmoreover, lost it.\n\nOr have you? The souvenir photograph offered at ride's end\n\ndoesn't lie: Somewhere on the first drop I let fly a\n\nTourette's-like torrent of involuntary profanity. To judge by\n\nthe photo, in which ampersands and exclamation marks practically\n\nbillow from my mouth in a cartoon balloon, these epic\n\nobscenities came as a revelation to the plaid-skirted Japanese\n\nschoolgirls seated in front of me. Each of their mouths is\n\nforever frozen in a rictus of disbelief.\n\nFor one brief shining moment of American ingenuity, in 1991,\n\nKennywood's Steel Phantom was faster than Fujiyama is today. For\n\nits first seven days of operation, the Phantom was the fastest\n\ncoaster of all time, doing 90 mph, a speed quickly deemed too\n\nuncomfortable for humans to endure without lifelong 24-hour\n\nchiropractic supervision. So this creature, another spawn of\n\nToomer's evil genius, had to be retrofitted with additional\n\nbrakes. The Phantom is now more spine-chilling than\n\nspine-killing, particularly when it passes beneath the tracks of\n\nthe Thunderbolt coaster, with which it is entangled.\n\nSuch is the Phantom's menace that park officials made me ride it\n\nwith a 15-year-old from Mars, Pa., named Ed Murphy. The kid, a\n\nveteran of 20 Phantom rides, could only stare grimly from our\n\nfront seat as I babbled nervously. When I blurted that I had\n\njust eaten a chicken-salad sandwich, young Ed said, as we\n\nascended the chain lift, \"I wish you hadn't told me that.\"\n\nThe Phantom is frequently cited as the second-best steel coaster\n\nin existence, after Cedar Point's Magnum XL-200. Cedar Point has\n\nthe highest concentration of coasters anywhere in the world.\n\nWhat's more, the park is on the beach where Knute Rockne\n\ninvented the forward pass with Notre Dame teammate Gus Dorais\n\nwhile the two worked as lifeguards in the summer of 1913. The\n\nhistoric spot, marked with a plaque, is now part of the Soak\n\nCity water park.\n\nI rode Magnum with Cedar Point public relations director Robin\n\nInnes, who wore a shirt and tie and carried on, with consummate\n\nprofessionalism, a business conversation as we climbed the\n\n205-foot first hill. \"This was the first coaster to break the\n\n200-foot barrier,\" Innes said casually as we crested. \"This\n\nfirst drop is 195 feet and aaiiieeeyeaaah! Hoohoohoo!\n\nWahahaheee! celebrating its 10th anniversary this summer and oh\n\nman! Oh man! Woooooo! Yeaaahh! top speed of 72 miles an hour,\n\nwhich is approximately yes! Whoahoho! Woohooee! Hey hey! the\n\ntubular steel track eee-heee-hoo-ha-haaaa! be happy to if you\n\nhave any questions.\" I had no idea what he was talking about,\n\nbut I nodded frequently in response.\n\nToomer designed Magnum but never rode it. Still, he is aware\n\nthat it remains the favorite of a great many coasterphiles,\n\nwhose reasons are largely intangible and perhaps best\n\narticulated by Innes when he said, \"Wahahoohaheeeeee!\"\n\n\"Ten years after opening,\" says Escalante, the ACEr, \"Magnum\n\nstill hasn't been improved on.\" At the coaster's anniversary\n\nparty in June, Toomer signed 1,000 autographs.\n\n\"I never expected that I'd become some kind of nut-club cult\n\nleader,\" the designer says. But he has become just that, with 80\n\nwildly popular coasters stretching from Indonesia to Spain to\n\nthe interior of Buffalo Bill's Casino in Primm, Nev. \"These\n\nrides,\" he says, pondering a legacy, \"will be around for a very\n\nlong time.\" To say the least. Leap-the-Dips opened in 1902 and\n\nruns to this day at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pa.\n\nNot far from Leap-the-Dips is the Wildcat, at Hershey Park. It\n\ngives riders the most instances of air, or negative G's: 11\n\ntimes passengers are lifted from their seats. \"There's an arms\n\nrace for everything now,\" says industry analyst Ruben. The list\n\nof superlatives is seemingly endless, much like the venerable\n\nBeast at Paramount's Kings Island, near Cincinnati. The Beast is\n\nby far the longest wooden roller coaster in the world, both in\n\ntrack feet and in ride time. It travels a tortuous 7,400 feet\n\nand covers an area more than twice that of Kennywood's\n\nThunderbolt. The Beast lasts an unheard-of three minutes and 40\n\nseconds. And \"no man,\" as Dr. Johnson said about Paradise Lost,\n\n\"ever wished it longer.\"\n\nSTRIKE THAT: One man has ever wished every ride longer. A\n\ncoaster jockey of exceedingly rare gifts, Richard Gregory\n\nRodriguez now takes his place beside Ted Williams and Jascha\n\nHeifetz as a 20th-century titan whose skills simply overwhelm\n\nour powers of analysis. Twelve times Rodriguez has set the world\n\nrecord for marathon coastering, but last summer was his Beamon\n\nleap, his Secretariat-at-Belmont moment: He rode the Big Dipper\n\nin Blackpool for 1,013 1/2 hours over 47 days, from June 18\n\nuntil August 3, nearly doubling his own record of 549 hours, set\n\nin Blackpool in 1994. \"The three big questions I get,\" Rodriguez\n\ntold me solemnly, while sitting for an interview in a sidewalk\n\ncafe near his home in Miami, \"are Why? Do you get paid? and How\n\ndo you go to the bathroom?\" We will try to answer each of these\n\nquestions in due time, but for now you need understand only that\n\nRodriguez's life is a cat's cradle of coaster history. In him\n\nall of the industry's threads intersect.\n\nHe was born to greatness, blessed genetically and\n\ngeographically. For starters, young Rich grew to the minimal\n\nacceptable standard of 48 inches, then kept going, eventually\n\nleveling off at 5'8\" and 160 pounds--\"The perfect size for\n\nriding,\" he says. \"Like a Formula One driver's.\"\n\nEven more propitious, Rodriguez was born in Brooklyn, the cradle\n\nof American amusement, home of the original Luna Park and Coney\n\nIsland, where the first commercially successful roller coaster\n\nwas built, in 1884. The Gravity Switchback Railway was the\n\nbrainchild of LaMarcus Thompson, who had made a fortune\n\ninventing seamless hosiery. More than a century later, in\n\nunintentional homage to the stocking magnate, an astonishing\n\nnumber of women would toss their underwear from roller coasters,\n\nin the same spirit in which unmentionables are flung into trees\n\nfrom chairlifts on ski slopes. It is a dirty little secret--a\n\nVictoria's Secret--of the family entertainment industry. But we\n\ndigress.\n\nRodriguez was raised in the shadow of the great coaster jocks of\n\nthe '70s, men such as Jim Bruce, who made his reputation on the\n\nSwamp Fox in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Noel Aube, who tamed the\n\nWildcat at Lake Compounce in Connecticut. But Rodriguez's true\n\nheroes were aviators: solo balloonists such as Ed Yost and Steve\n\nFossett and, above all, Charles Lindbergh. Two years after\n\ncrossing the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis, Lindy rode the\n\nCyclone at Coney Island and said, \"A ride on Cyclone is a\n\ngreater thrill than flying an airplane at top speed.\"\n\nSo, in the summer of 1977, 18-year-old Rich Rodriguez set out to\n\ncommemorate the 50th anniversary of Lindbergh's flight--and the\n\n50th birthday of the Cyclone--with an audacious act of his own.\n\n\"I don't want to overdramatize this,\" he would say years later,\n\n\"but Lindbergh was a longshot in '27. He would have been 20-to-1\n\nin a horse race. He wasn't well financed. And here I was, not\n\nwealthy, from Brooklyn, and I thought, What can I do in\n\nLindbergh's spirit of adventure? Can I accomplish something?\"\n\nCarrying only a pillow, a blanket and a note from his\n\ndoctor--plus the blessing of management at Coney Island's\n\nAstroland--Rodriguez set out on Aug. 18, 1977, to break Michael\n\nBoodley's world record of 45 consecutive hours on a roller\n\ncoaster. He selected the sixth car from the front. \"It's the\n\nmost stable ride,\" says Rodriguez, who would soon make the sixth\n\ncar his signature. As he traveled 50 mph in the frigid Coney\n\nIsland nights, with the wind whipping off the Atlantic, his face\n\nswelled grotesquely. He resolved, then and there, that next time\n\nwould be different. Next time he'd bring lotion.\n\nThere would be a next time, too, for Rodriguez shattered\n\nBoodley's record, set on the Cyclone, by staying on that angry\n\nmechanical bull for 103 hours and 55 minutes to enter the\n\nGuinness Book of World Records. Then, between 1977 and 1982,\n\nRodriguez would break his world record nine times, the last two\n\non corkscrewing coasters in Quebec and Germany.\n\nUnder Guinness guidelines, a rider can spend an average of five\n\nminutes of every hour off the coaster--or a total of two hours a\n\nday, to be divided as the jockey sees fit. Rodriguez used his\n\ntime to eat and go to the bathroom, which is to say, he did all\n\nof his sleeping on the coasters, snoozing through every\n\nterrifying turn of the corkscrew. Soon the word went forth:\n\nThere was an undisputed King of Coasters, a man the British tabs\n\ncalled Queasy Rider, a misnomer if ever there was one. \"I was\n\nblessed with a strong stomach,\" says Rodriguez. \"I never get\n\nsick.\" He was, in short, the Natural, and the trade magazines\n\nall headlined his ONE TRACK MIND.\n\nBut his one-track mind was wandering. In 1982, after spending\n\n328 hours on the Super Werbil at Holiday Park in Hassloch,\n\nGermany, to set his 10th world record, Rodriguez walked wobbily\n\naway from marathoning. There were, simply, no more Magic\n\nMountains to climb. For the next 12 years, the Natural\n\nsquandered his gift. He matriculated at Columbia, receiving a\n\nbachelor's degree in history and political science. In 1987 he\n\njoined the Army, serving his country for 2 1/2 years before his\n\ndiabetes was diagnosed and, at his request, he was honorably\n\ndischarged. He then moved to Chicago to educate America's youth\n\nas a substitute high school teacher. It was all very wasteful,\n\nthis attention to duty, and Rodriguez watched his record fall to\n\na younger jock, the Quebecois upstart Normand St. Pierre, master\n\nof Le Monstre at La Ronde Park in Montreal.\n\nBy 1991 Rodriguez was a 32-year-old diabetic injecting himself\n\nwith insulin four times a day, and it appeared that his train\n\nhad long since left the platform. Or had it? \"George Foreman had\n\ncome back to boxing,\" recalls Rodriguez. \"Mark Spitz was trying\n\nto return to the Olympics, and I began to wonder, Why not? At\n\nfirst it was hard to find a park to train in, but I'd buy some\n\nride operators at Coney Island a couple of beers, and they'd let\n\nme ride all day.\"\n\nHe went to Blackpool in 1994 and rode for 549 hours to reclaim\n\nthe record that St. Pierre had held, in his absence, for 11\n\nyears. Rodriguez returned to form on the Big Dipper, which was\n\nbuilt in 1921. Today's brakes are almost all hydraulics, but at\n\nBlackpool, as at Coney Island, large men still pull enormous\n\nhand brakes. \"If he misses the brakes, I could be dead,\" says\n\nRodriguez. \"If my hand falls out of the car when I'm asleep, I\n\ncould lose a limb. I'm going around something like 12,000\n\ncircuits, and any number of things can go wrong.\"\n\nIn 1979, at the Vancouver Pacific National Exhibition, Rodriguez\n\nwas on a coaster that was \"double training,\" or running two\n\ntrains on one track. When his train pulled into the platform,\n\nthe train behind it failed to brake. Rodriguez bailed out before\n\nimpact. \"Otherwise,\" he says, \"I would've broken my neck.\"\n\nLast summer, feeling stronger than ever, Rodriguez returned to\n\nthe Big Dipper to go head-to-head against his nemesis, St.\n\nPierre, who would be riding Le Monstre in Montreal in a kind of\n\ntransatlantic staredown. In all fairness, the Francophone never\n\nstood a chance. Rodriguez forever lowered the lap bar on his own\n\nplace in history. \"The first couple of days are always a\n\nshakedown period,\" he says of the marathon. \"It's almost\n\nimpossible to sleep. By the fourth day, my body has a will to\n\nadapt. After two weeks, it feels more normal to be on the\n\ncoaster than off.\" (When he is off, Rodriguez still feels the\n\nride, like the phantom leg of an amputee.)\n\nSt. Pierre withered in the white-hot heat of such greatness and\n\ndisembarked from Le Monstre after an otherwise astonishing 670\n\nhours. But Rodriguez, already in possession of the world record,\n\nrefused to stop. He rode for gratuitous hours, then days and\n\nfinally weeks, until he passed the 1,000-hour mark and put the\n\nrecord forever out of reach. On the final lap of his odyssey, he\n\nbreasted a tape at the platform, a U.S. flag on his sweater, and\n\nthen swigged from a champagne bottle. He was bussed by a pair of\n\nBlackpool belles. Then, spent, he called his mother from a cell\n\nphone.\n\nHis legs were badly bruised. His knees, though padded, were\n\ncross-hatched with cuts from the violent jostling of the steel\n\ncar as he slept. His face resembled a peeled tomato, rubbed raw\n\nby the wind off the Irish Sea. Imagine driving from Miami to\n\nJuneau and back at 65 mph with your head out the window, and you\n\nonly begin to comprehend the man's 11,362-mile ride to nowhere.\n\nEnsconced that night in an English hotel, Rodriguez couldn't\n\nsleep. \"I kept waking up in bed,\" he says, \"bracing myself for\n\nthe first drop.\"\n\nThe next morning, England awoke to a bizarre and lengthy\n\neditorial in The Times of London denouncing Rodriguez. \"If\n\nfutility can be graded,\" the piece said, \"surely this bizarre\n\nbid to turn entertainment into tedium might almost set a record.\"\n\nThe first time Rodriguez heard this was when I mentioned it to\n\nhim recently. \"I know I'm not Neil Armstrong,\" he said. \"I keep\n\nthis in perspective. I know there's a lot of humor here. I'm 40\n\nyears old, and it will be easy for people to say, 'This guy is\n\nmissing a few bricks.' But you know, I don't get paid, I have\n\nslept in airports, I try to raise some money for diabetes\n\nresearch. I just want to keep my dignity, if that is possible.\n\nThis is not a glamorous life.\"\n\nSo why live it? \"I think it's the connection to people,\"\n\nRodriguez says. \"Most people don't understand what I'm doing,\n\nbut they want to be a part of the fun. They ask, 'Can I bring\n\nyou a blanket?' 'Will you come to dinner at the house when it's\n\nover?' At Blackpool, a family brings me candy. I rode with a\n\nlittle girl and a little boy when I set a record in Blackpool in\n\n1979, and I wrote them a note. They came back in '94 and rode\n\nwith me again.\"\n\nThe kids had, of course, grown up. One of them still had his\n\nyellowed note, and she showed it to Rodriguez 15 years after\n\nhe'd written it. It said, \"Thanks so much for riding with me.\"\n\nHis life had come full circle. But then it did so 505 times\n\nevery day on the Dipper, 22,725 times in all last summer.\n\nThe traditional complete-circuit roller coaster always returns\n\nto its station, to where it began. So it is with all of\n\nroller-coasterdom. In the way that cities are building retro\n\nballparks, neoclassical wooden coasters are now going up, and\n\nancient amusement parks--such as 101-year-old Kennywood--are the\n\nenvy of the industry. \"The '50s saw urban decline and the flight\n\nto suburbia,\" says Futrell, the NAPHA historian, \"and the '60s\n\nbecame a real struggle for the old-time traditional parks. The\n\n'70s brought theme-park development. Now we're getting back to\n\nthe vintage parks. Kennywood is almost the Wrigley Field of\n\namusement parks.\"\n\nKennywood's Thunderbolt was named the top roller coaster in the\n\nworld in a highly publicized Discovery Channel special that aired\n\nover Memorial Day weekend. The wooden coaster opened in 1968.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who don't even count steel as\n\ncoasters,\" says Breymier, the Coaster Zombie.\n\n\"Ride operators like the older rides,\" says Futrell. \"They're\n\nsolid but simple pieces of machinery, with pulleys and gears and\n\nchains.\"\n\n\"You know how you remember the Top 40 songs from high school,\n\nwhat you heard when you were driving around in your car at\n\nnight?\" Rodriguez said out of the blue in one of our last\n\nconversations. \"I remember the song that was playing at Coney\n\nIsland the first time I rode the Cyclone, in 1976. It was Turn\n\nthe Beat Around by Vicki Sue Robinson. The summer of '77,\n\nAfternoon Delight was the big one. The summer of '78 was all Bee\n\nGees and Donna Summer. At most of these parks, a deejay plays\n\nthe hit songs 10 or 15 times a day. I can still hear Fly, Robin,\n\nFly and Love to Love You Baby. Remember a song called Magnet and\n\nSteel? When I hear that, I think of riding the Rebel Yell in the\n\nsummer of 1978, and it makes me happy and wistful.\"\n\nNot long ago a woman called me from Premier Rides, a space-age\n\ndesign firm that builds roller coasters with linear induction\n\nmotors, powered by magnets. I couldn't bring myself to call her\n\nback. Whatever lies in the future, I realized, the charm of\n\nroller coasters is in their evocation of the past. In addition\n\nto the Big Dipper, Blackpool Pleasure Beach has one of the\n\nworld's last surviving Tunnels of Love. One of the last.\n\nI finally understood Rodriguez and his white-knuckle attachment\n\nto roller coasters. It has nothing to do with magnets and steel\n\nand plenty to do with Magnet and Steel.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BILL FRAKES High Rollers Corkscrews, death dives, knife-edge turns: A new generation of roller coasters raises the stakes for those in search of cheap thrills by Steve Rushin [T of C]\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPHS BY BILL FRAKES Incredible?
