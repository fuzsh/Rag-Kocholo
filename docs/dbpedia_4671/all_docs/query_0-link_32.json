        "text": "Britain is in the middle of the worst bear market since the Seventies, with no end in sight to three years of gloom that has wiped Â£700 billion off share prices, according to City experts.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index plunged below 4,000 for the first time since 1996 last Monday in the steepest one-day fall since the 11 September terrorist attacks . On Friday, it closed at 4,098. The damage was even worse in the US.\n\nBob Semple, equities strategist at Deutsche Bank, says: 'We recovered quite quickly from the big market falls in 1987 and 1998, but this time it's different.'\n\nHe adds: 'If you look at the charts, you will see that from 1972 it took 31 months before the market started to rise again, but it was not until 1979 that the All-Share index was back at levels achieved seven years earlier. The real take-off did not happen until 1981.'\n\nStripping out inflation, key US stock market indices took 16 years to recover from the boom that ended in 1966. Further back, it was not until 1940 that prices were back to levels registered prior to the Depression, sparked by the 1929 Wall Street crash. Statistics like these augur ill for the future.\n\nAnalysts are wondering whether the last 20 years have been the exception to the rule. 'Returns of between 10 and 20 per cent a year are a thing of the past,' says one researcher. 'People have to lower their expectations.'\n\nThe bears gained ammunition last week, when a London Business School study showed that in the last 100 years, shares worldwide have on average returned little more than 5 per cent above risk-free government bonds.\n\nThe authors predict that the premium over bonds in future may fall to as little as 3 per cent. Over a long period, that still beats stashing your money under the pillow or putting it in the building society. But it hardly justifies having the vast bulk of your savings in equities.\n\nMany pension and life insurance funds have switched out of shares and into bonds to ensure they can meet their liabilities in volatile trading conditions. The big question is the timing of a recovery. Robert Buckland, head of equity strategy at the US investment bank Citigroup, says: 'My feeling is that we are in a fragile recovery phase. But volatile means exactly that - expect swings of 5 per cent either way as the norm.'\n\nSteve Russell at HSBC says: 'I do not think that we are about to go into a big recession, but there are still problems ahead; I doubt a rally in prices can be sustained for long. Why should there be a big bounce when equities are producing such poor returns?'\n\nBuckland believes the test for the UK will be the resilience of the housing market. 'Consumer spending has been strong because confidence has been buoyed by the rising values of properties. If housing crashes like equities we could be in trouble. The British consumer is affected far more by what his house is worth than by a fall in share prices.'\n\nOn balance, the experts do not believe the market is telling us to prepare for an economic slump. 'Markets often get it wrong on this sort of thing,' says Mark Tinker, head of debt and equities research at the London-based arm of Germany's Commerzbank. 'The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson used to joke that the market had predicted 11 out of the last five recessions.'\n\nBuckland too doubts whether the economy is heading for the rocks, but adds: 'We all hope some of the steam will come out of housing.' Tinker is most optimistic. 'The UK market looks cheap. I think the bubble started in 1998 when the index was roughly at the same level as it is today.\n\n'Just think back to the height of the boom. Everyone was saying the good times would roll for ever. Now it is all doom and gloom. But isn't the time to sell when everyone is buying, and the time to buy when the herd is stampeding towards the exit doors?'\n\nBuckland says: 'What is interesting is the way this sell-off has unfolded. The dotcom companies were first to be dumped, then it was the turn of telecommunications; a little later we had a a loss of confidence in the \"old economy\".\n\n'Now investors are selling shares indiscriminately. Professional operators who were buying futures contracts that track the FTSE index in the hope of better times to come have been big sellers.\n\n'Suddenly, there is a realisation that there may be no significant recovery in corporate profitability in 2003. Even in 2004, earnings might grow by no more than 4 per cent.'\n\nSo the argument for selling turns on the thorny issue of valuation. In the absence of a revival in profits growth, share prices still appear high, but more so in the US than in the UK, say analysts.\n\nThe effects of the market malaise are bound to spread. If firms are in a worse state than we thought, they will not invest, and there will be less scope for expansion because banks will be reluctant to lend them money. Weak equity prices make it trickier for companies to raise fresh capital. Investors remain nervous despite last week's reassuring comments from central bankers. Europe may not have had a scandal akin to Enron or WorldCom, but fears of corporate sleaze are pervasive on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n'If shareholders can't believe the figures, is it any surprise that they are staying clear of equities?' asks a leading UK fund manager.\n\nPrivate investors are certainly staying on the sidelines. Roy Johnstone, 43, a chef from Loughton, Essex, says he will never buy shares again after losing thousands of pounds during the technology boom, when he borrowed money from his bank to invest. 'I think it's an insider's game; the little guys don't have a chance,' Johnstone says.\n\nPhilip Augar, author of The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, is less downcast: 'At some point we are going to get to a point where buying shares makes sense again.' Is that time now? 'We must be getting close,' he says."
