        "text": "9/96 Bill Goffrier Art Show now in Wichita\n\nThe Embarrassment Years, an exhibition of drawings and paintings following the artistic and musical paths of Bill Goffrier, was showed at the EVO Gallery in Wichita, September and October, 1996. Yep, you can actually buy Bill's art through the gallery. Information on the show and buying some real Embo art can be had by giving them a call at 316-264-4622, or via Z. Jacobs at imimike@southwind.net. (We are working on getting some additional scans of reproductions of Bill's art available via this page.)\n\n5/18/96 Embos Alumni News\n\nJim Rosencutter, the Embos' sound man for their last few years, wrote me with an update/correction on the \"where are they now\" information:\n\nJon Nichols is living in Orlando and is a manager for America West Airlines.\n\nRon Klaus is living in Phoenix.\n\n(Jim is a student now at Friends University; I have added his email address to the 'where are they now' section in the \"Brief History\" page, linked below.)\n\nBill Cornell sent me a clipping last fall that I only just now resurrected about Woody/Brent -- from the Boston Globe 9/22/95 (no page number):\n\nWoody Giessmann, former drummer for the Del Fuegos and the Embarrassment, is now a counselor with the Massachusetts Drug and Alcohol Hotline, and he's organizing a benefit for the group Oct. 1 at Mama Kin. 'We're in need,' says Giessman, explaining state funding has ebbed. As to his own involvement: 'I lost a brother to a gunshot, drugs and alcohol. Later on, it beacme an issue in my life. This is me paying back.'\n\n(3/18/97 -- copy of text above)\n\nI'm happy to add the following clip, sent to me by the self-same Elissa Schwartz from the Boston Globe \"Names and Faces&quot column, 10/16/96:\n\nDrummed Out of Bachelorhood When Woody Giessmann, former drummer of the now defunct Del Fuegos, got married to Elissa Schwartz on Sunday, he should have known he was in for a rocking wedding. After all, he invited former bandmates Dan Zanes, Warren Zanes, and Tom Lloyd, who implored Giessmann to sit in on drums as they played three songs. Also there was Laurie Geltman (whose band Giessman is now in), who belted out a couple of songs at the gala at the VFW Hall in Cambridge. For the record, Lovedogs was the actual wedding band."
