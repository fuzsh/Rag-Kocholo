        "text": "Big Dipper wasn’t around that long in its first wave – four years, generously speaking, from 1986 to 1990. But it was an era where indie rock felt like it mattered, where pop was smart and a little bit arty, where bands burst to life, then sputtered almost as quickly, and yet still are remembered as vital, even, and maybe especially, in Boston, which definitely didn’t forget them.\n\nIt went something like this: 1986, and former members of other awesomely indie Boston rock curiosities, Volcano Suns and Dumptruck, guitarist Gary Waleik and bassist Steve Michener, met guitarist Bill Goffrier, former leader of Kansas punks The Embarrassment. Along with drummer Jeff Oliphant, it wasn’t long before friendships were formed and a band after that, and studio time was booked and a demo was recorded, and local college radio caught their buzz.\n\nBig Dipper had a sound that suggested barely-repressed angst beneath a smoother, lighter-touch surface: noisy guitars set against starry-eyed harmonies and humor, and sweet melodies gnarled by unkept rhythms, all on subjects as strangely appropriate as extraterrestrial life, godlike presences and devolving relationships.\n\nAt the time, it worked: four albums in three years that stand up as prime examples of the era’s tuneful, but not-quite-comfortable post-punk and arty pop. They were embraced. Epic Records came calling about three albums in, even.\n\nBut they didn’t make it.\n\n“We had to deal with the fact that we were not going to to be a commercial success,” recalled Goffrier about the band’s gradual splintering in 1990. “We dealt with one member dropping out at a time, starting with Steve.”\n\nGoffrier’s up for talking about Big Dipper because a funny thing happened during the band’s long holding pattern in cultish obscurity: it ended, sort of.\n\nIn 2008, Merge Records released a 3-CD anthology called “Supercluster” that drew heavily from the band’s early albums and also from unreleased material.\n\n“Supercluster took so many yeas to put together because there were so many songs we had done a good job with that we didn’t put out. Merge offered to do it,” he said. “It was a lucky break in Big Dipper’s short history of lucky breaks.”\n\nA renewed interest from fans – of the band, and of the era – finally prompted Big Dipper to not only get together, but reunite as a live band.\n\n“We’d all just been too busy,” Goffirer recalls of the reunion five years ago. “We’re still really too busy with our own lives, but getting back together was just so much fun and there were so many positive feelings around it that we decided to take it a little further.”\n\nLuckily, the band got a push from friend and admirer Robert Pollard of Guided By Voices fame, who invited the band to open for his Boston Spaceships project in a 2008 show at the Paradise Rock Club.\n\n“We couldn’t pass up that opportunity,” Goffrier said.\n\nGranted, the Big Dipper that took the stage that night – and has continued, more or less since – includes what might be called an “anthologized” lineup. Goffrier, Waleik and Oliphant remain from the formative days, and are joined by bassist Tom Brewitt, who played in later versions of the band following Michener’s exit.\n\nBut it’s the band that exists today, and the band that released 2012’s marvelous “Big Dipper Crashes On the Platinum Planet,” Big Dipper’s first album of original material in more than two decades and sounds like it was plucked from that fertile late 80s period in percolating indie, yet still packs a whallop.\n\nBig Dipper’s returned to the stage off and on since the 2008 reunion, and they’ll celebrate “Platinum Planet” on February 2 at Cambridge’s Middle East.\n\nHome Down The South Shore\n\nYou wouldn’t call Big Dipper a South Shore band, but Goffrier, who lives in Hull, embraced the area both as musician and artist. He lived in Hingham and has exhibited his work all over the area, including Hingham’s South Street Gallery and at several locations in Quincy.\n\nIt was art that brought him to Boston in the first place, following four years with Wichita and Lawrence, Kansas-based punk crew The Embarrassment (where he played with future Del Fuegos drummer and fellow Kansas-to-Boston transplant Brent Giessman). Big Dipper was front-and-center, but then began a gradual fade, member-by-member.\n\n“Even when Gary bowed out, I still wanted to keep going,” Goffrier said. “For a while, we played very low key gigs as a trio, doing a whole new set of material and dropping a lot of the Big Dipper songs. Then we dropped the name itself and the trio kind of fizzled out after that. No one ever had any bad feelings, it was always one member wishing the rest of us well and whoever was left carrying on. Then as the mid-90s came around, I had given up on it too.”\n\nThough most of the Big Dipper crew stayed in Boston – Waleik lives in Natick, and Brewitt in Cambridge, while Oliphant lives in Arizona – there was no fruitful talk of future band projects. Goffrier returned full-time to painting and visual arts. He also became a father.\n\n“I think that sort of happened to all of us in some ways, because we all have busy lives,” Goffrier said. “You land in a professional non-musical career, you become a parent, you try to earn a decent living not tied to being on the road.”\n\nThe first reunion of the band was actually at Oliphant’s wedding earlier in the decade, Goffrier said. But Big Dipper was asked to do live shows following the Merge anthology.\n\n“I understand how the business works and we needed to get out there to help promote it,” he said. “Getting back into it was interesting because we were re-learning the songs – some of those songs were completely gone. So we did a lot of work putting the arrangements back together and present what people wanted to hear from the old catalog. After all that work it made sense to keep some kind of momentum going.”\n\nBig Dipper may be reunited, but you wouldn’t call a band with three shows on its calendar rebooted. Maybe they’ll do more, maybe they won’t, and that’s how it will stay, Goffrier said.\n\n“We like to celebrate it, and everyone has their perspective on where they want it to go, but we haven’t much talked about it beyond this handful of shows,” he said. “Someone wants us to come out to Chicago, I hear, but beyond that I don’t know if there will be other plans. I don’t know if there need to be any more.”\n\nThey all have other projects and pursuits. Goffrier, along with his art, has a thriving, country/folk-centric collaboration with another Hull local, singer/songwriter Karlee Dean, that began with duo songwriting in 2010 and soon became semi-regular performances. (The duo’s Bandcamp site nicely catalogs their recorded work: www.karleedeanandbillgoffrier.bandcamp.com.) He’s a presence about town – non-stop music man Dave Foley is a buddy – with plenty of love for it.\n\n“I can cross the street and be at Gun Rock Beach,” he muses.\n\nBut then again, more Big Dipper can’t be ruled out, either.\n\n“I’m in my fifties and plan to keep going into my seventies,” he said, laughing. “I know I can at least paint into my eighties. Maybe I can rock, too, we’ll find out.”"
