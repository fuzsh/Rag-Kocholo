        "text": "Could the rich get J-Richer?\n\nMichigan State basketball is one of three finalists for 2024 recruit Jase Richardson, the son of former Spartans standout Jason Richardson. The other finalists are Cincinnati and Alabama. He's made official visits to all three.\n\nRichardson, the No. 34 recruit in the country for next year's class according to 247Sports.com, is set to make his announcement at the Top Flight Invite this weekend in Las Vegas.\n\nRichardson recently reflected on his visit to Michigan State in an interview with 247Sports.com, saying head coach Tom Izzo has pitched the idea of teaming him with Jeremy Fears, a freshman point guard on this season's team, in the Spartans backcourt. This season's backcourt is mostly upperclassmen.\n\n\"I love Coach Izzo,\" Richardson told 247Sports.com recently. \"We connect on many great levels and him always telling me stories of coaching my dad and stuff my dad used to do on campus.\"\n\nJason Richarson, a Saginaw native, played at Michigan State from 1999-2001, playing in two Final Fours, and winning the 2000 national championship. He went pro after two seasons, and was the fifth overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors. A shooting guard, he played 13 seasons in the NBA.\n\nJase Richardson, 6-foot-3, 180 pounds and rated four stars, plays at Columbus High School in Miami, Florida, after transferring there from Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, along with his brother Jaxson. Jase immediately became a top-10 recruit in the state of Florida after his move.\n\nMichigan State, still heavy on recruiting freshmen in the era of the transfer portal, had a top-10 recruiting class for 2023-24, led by forwards Xavier Booker and Coen Carr, and guards Fears and Gehrig Normand. Izzo has two recruits committed for the 2024 class, four-star shooting guard Kur Teng from Massachusetts and three-star power forward Jesse McCulloch from Cleveland.\n\ntpaul@detroitnews.com\n\nX: @tonypaul1984"
