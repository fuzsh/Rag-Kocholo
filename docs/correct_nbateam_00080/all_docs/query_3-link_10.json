        "text": "The High Plains Observers welcomes Jason Richardson to the HPO team as he interviews local interesting community citizens. Below you can read more about Jason, his background and how he began his podcast business. You will be able to listen to Jason and his guests on Facebook and HPO.\n\nMy name is Jason Richardson, host of the Hutchinson County Podcast and I will share a story on how I got to this point.\n\nI'm a 1991 graduate of West Texas High and after high school attended one year college. I figured out college was not for me and worked various jobs. I started work for the State of Texas at the Clements Unit in 1994 working there until 1998 and then in 2000 got my class A CDL.\n\nI worked for a cement company for three years then went to work in the oilfield driving a truck in 2003 and in 2010 was presented the opportunity to be a pumper in the oil field until 2022.\n\nIn 2012 I was presented the opportunity to volunteer for a local radio station here in Borger, Texas -- KQTY -- as a commentator for Borger Bulldogs Sports and in that time frame of 11 years was presented other opportunities.\n\nBasically, media is my hobby and the oilfield is my real job.\n\nI currently work in the oilfield and for the past two years in a different capacity for the State of Texas.\n\nWhen George Grover, the station manager retired in November 2023 I took that opportunity in January of 2024 to start a podcast during my off hours.\n\nWe will see where this journey takes me. I've had a lot of good guests and a lot of good guests yet to come on the podcast.\n\nIt's a learning experience and hopefully with time things will improve. As the saying goes, you're your worst own critic in that department.\n\n\" You can't change what people think and say about you. You just do what makes you happy and move forward.\"\n\nI want to thank High Plains Observer and Gina Gillispie for sharing my podcast and helping my podcast grow -- it is greatly appreciated."
