        "text": "Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nEarlier today, the Orlando Magic made a blockbuster move by sending Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat, Mickael Pietrus and a 2011 first-round pick to the Phoenix Suns for Hedo Trukoglu, Jason Richardson and Earl Clark.\n\nThe six-player trade should be finalized within 24 hours.\n\nThe Magic made another big deal in acquiring Gilbert Arenas from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Rashard Lewis.\n\nThe trade should work out for both teams as the Magic have improved their perimeter game and they get Hedo Turkoglu back.\n\nTurkoglu struggled greatly in Toronto and Phoenix so maybe being sent back to Orlando is exactly what he needs. Turkoglu averaged nearly 17 points per game in his final season with the Magic as opposed to his 9.5 with the Suns.\n\nThe Magic will also get Jason Richardson, which is definitely an improvement from Vince Carter. Richardson is averaging four more points than Carter and shoots 41 percent from the perimeter while Carter only shoots 34 percent.\n\nThe Suns acquisitions of Carter, Gortat and Pietrus can help them down the stretch. They all can benefit from point guard Steve Nashâ€”especially Gortat, who will get much more playing time in Phoenix with no Dwight Howard starting in front of him.\n\nFinally, the Magic capped their day off by sending Rashard Lewis to the Wizards for Gilbert Arenas.\n\nLewis' numbers have gone down in the past few seasons so the Magic will get a scorer in Arenas who has shown flashes of his former self this season.\n\nThe only negative for Orlando is the remaining $62.4 million left on Arenas' contract but if he plays well, it could turn out to be a steal.\n\nArenas will likely play shooting guard in Orlando for the remainder of the season."
