The Magic have seen some magical years and some bad ones as well. Whenever things looked bleak for Orlando, a superstar player would magically appear on its roster.The franchise may be known mostly for big name stars bolting the city for larger markets, the best Magic players are some of the greatest in NBA history. Shaquille O'Neal was the first superstar to play for the Magic. During his time in Orlando, Shaq was the best young player in the league. Between he and Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic had two of the brightest stars in the league.\n\nAfter Shaq bolted for Los Angeles and Hardaway had major knee surgery that made a shell of his former self, the Magic looked to find two new superstars to replace them. In came Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill. While Hill was hampered by injuries, McGrady developed into one of the greatest Magic players of all time. When McGrady left, Dwight Howard arrived to take over. As the best center in the NBA, Howard took the Magic to the NBA Finals in 2009. But like Shaq, Howard skipped town when he was traded to Los Angeles in 2012.\n\nOrlando has had some of the best current players in the NBA on its team since it came into the league, a number that would make other teams jealous. It's hard landing one superstar, nevertheless a number of the greatest players in basketball history, but the Magic have done exactly that. More recently, NBA stars like Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, Franz Wagner, Jonathan Isaac, and Mo Bamba have given the Magic hope for a bright future.\n\nVote up the best Orlando Magic of all time, and rerank this list according to who you think should be considered the greatest Orlando Magic player in team history."
