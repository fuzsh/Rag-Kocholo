We're at the Hoophall Classic in Springfield, Massachusetts. Jase, you guys are going away 2 and 0. You played fantastic. You were the player of the game for I know the last game. Did you get it the first game too or no? OK, OK, that was Cam. But how does it feel to walk away on such a prestigious event on a high note?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: I think it was, like, a really big thing for us. Playing the number two and number three teams in the country is definitely like a Geico test in a way. So just coming away with those wins, it's a huge confidence-booster, especially when we got playoffs coming up soon.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: Yeah. And you and your brother both came into this team like you're new this year, but the way that the team chemistry is built, it's seamlessly-- like, you guys play so well together. What sort of work went into that to be able to play so well on the court?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: I think just a lot of off-court things. I feel like when we first got out here, it was a lot of off-court team bonding, and we just all kind of connected on a different level. So we bring that on to the court. And then with the ball movement, it becomes effortless.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: The last time we spoke, I remember you were saying you didn't get a lot of minutes with your brother. But now, you guys are playing much, much more. How has that chemistry been, and are you trying to, like, just kind of hold these moments close because you're a senior and he's still got two years and you don't know if you'll be able to play with him again?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: Yeah. I think it's been really fun playing with him, especially now he's growing into his own. He's becoming a better player each and every day. So I'm kind of just like cherishing watching my little brother grow up through this high school basketball process, and just taking it all in.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: I mean, he won the slam dunk contest at City of Palms. Does he ever do any dunks and you're like how'd you do that?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: No. There was one in the backyard. We were in the backyard. He had flip-flops on, and he went underneath both legs and dunked it. I was like and you in flip-flops and swim trunks right now. Like, that's ridiculous. Some of the stuff he just does just amazes me.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: All right, you're headed to Michigan State next year. Are you kind of in your little brother's ear like trying to recruit him a little bit at all?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: No. I want him to go wherever he wants, he feels like going. I'm always going to support where he goes. But at the end of the day, I'm still go green. I'm bleeding green for sure. So I'm definitely telling him, but I'm going to let him do his own thing.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: What did your dad say, who also played there, won a National Title there. What did he say to you when you finally told him, like, I'm going to follow in your footsteps and go to Michigan State?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: He was actually really shocked. He was surprised. I told him, and his initial reaction, like, he was like are you sure? Are you 100% positive? I was like, yeah, I'm 100% positive. So we kind of just sat down, and he just asked me what went into my decision. And he understood what went into my decision, and he was happy for me.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: What was his reaction?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: So I FaceTimed him the day the day of, and I called him. I was like, Coach, I'm ready to come out there. I'm ready to be a Spartan. I don't think he talked for a cool 30 seconds.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: Did you think the phone froze?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: I was like, Coach, you good? He's like, no, I was just-- I'm just so shocked. I can't believe it. I'm so excited. I'm going to celebrate tonight. I was super excited to tell him and have him have that reaction.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: How are they saying that you can come in next year and be an instant impact on the team?\n\nJASE RICHARDSON: Definitely can just come in with their guards with core coming in with me, and then we got Jeremy and Tre Holloman there. I feel like just us four, we could really do big things in the back court in the Big Ten.\n\nKRSISTIN PEEK: All right, well Jase, good job this weekend. Good luck the rest of the year. And for more information on Jase Richardson, keep it right here on Yahoo Sports."
