        "text": "Tom Izzo has been coaching for so long that soon a kid of one of his former players will be on Michigan State basketball's roster.\n\nFour-star 2024 guard Jase Richardson committed to MSU on Sunday afternoon. He decided to follow in the footsteps of his father, former Spartans guard Jason Richardson.\n\nRichardson, the No. 34 ranked recruit in the country according to 247 sports, chose the Spartans over Alabama and Cincinnati. Richardson made the announcement at the Top Flight Invite basketball tournament in Las Vegas.\n\nRichardson is listed at 6-foot-3, 180 pounds. He is a versatile guard that can play on or off the ball offensively. He currently plays for Columbus high school in Miami, Fla. along with his brother Jaxon. The brothers played in Las Vegas for Bishop Gorman high school prior to this year.\n\nRichardson is MSU’s third commitment in the 2024 class, joining four-star guard Kur Teng from Massachusetts and Jesse McCulloch, a four-star forward from Cleveland. Teng and Richardson will help fill in for Michigan State’s veteran backcourt that is expected to leave after the season, along with current freshman Jeremy Fears Jr. and Gehrig Normand.\n\nJason Richardson played at Michigan State from 1999-2001 and was an integral member of Izzo’s first two Final Four appearances and the national championship in 2000. He was selected fifth overall in the 2001 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors and had a 13-year professional career."
