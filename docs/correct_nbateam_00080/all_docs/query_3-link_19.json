        "text": "MSU's top 50 basketball players: No. 29 Jason Richardson\n\nThis is the 22nd in a 50-day summer series, counting down the top players in Michigan State basketball history, as I see them. The criteria is impact and performance at MSU only, professional career irrelevant. Have your own opinion? Share your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nNo. 29 – Jason Richardson\n\nWing, 1999-2001, Saginaw\n\nThe Skinny: Richardson is the most spectacular athlete and dunker in modern MSU basketball history — a mix of freakish bounce, hang time and mid-air creativity. He was also an All-American as a sophomore, a consensus second-teamer, averaging 14.7 points and 5.9 rebounds as the leading scorer on MSU's third straight Final Four team in 2001. Richardson was first-team All-Big Ten that season, his final season, and began to also show the outside shot (49 3s at 40 percent) that keeps him in the NBA today, years after his young legs have left him.\n\nAs a freshman, he was a role player on MSU's 2000 national championship team, but not insignificant, averaging 5.1 points and 4.1 rebounds in 15 minutes a game, while providing memorable and momentum-altering highlights.\n\nWhy he's No. 29: If Richardson had played another season, he'd be higher on this list. But with only one banner year, one could argue No. 50 Marcus Taylor (a similar career arc) or No. 30 Stan Washington (also uber-athletic and more statistically productive over a longer period of time) belongs ahead of Richardson. If you'd made that argument to me well enough about a month ago, they might be. But Richardson's two-year resume — two Final Fours, two Big Ten titles, a national title, an All-American season, being the leading scorer on a team with a bevy of other scorers and great players, and the flair in which he played — puts him here, despite his short tenure.\n\nHe was also a McDonald's All-American recruit and the first in a wave of heralded new-level recruits, after Mateen Cleaves and Charlie Bell, that validated what was happening in East Lansing."
