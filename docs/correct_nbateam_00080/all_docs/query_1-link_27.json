        "text": "Jason “J-Rich” Richardson is on to the next one. He has terminated his relationship with basketball agent Dan Fegan, but has not yet chosen a replacement. In 2011, Richardson signed a 4-year, $25 million contract with the Orlando Magic, and was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in August 2012. He has an option in 2014 and will be an unrestricted free agent in 2015.\n\nThe past month has not been kind to Fegan. In addition to the departure of Richardson, Fegan lost Brooklyn Nets power forward Kris Humphries. Humphries’ business manager said that Humphries wanted a company that could not only effectively negotiate his professional contracts, but also an agency with deep connections for marketing opportunities.\n\nFegan recently left Lagardère Unlimited and is rumored to be joining basketball agent Happy Walters at Relativity Sports, although that move has not yet been confirmed. Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel heard Richardson say the following about Fegan after making his decision to go in a different direction:\n\n“I think a lot of guys feel like there were just left in the dark with a lot of things: him changing agencies, or whatever he did with the change. Just kind of neglect.”\n\nWhile Humphries and Richardson have cut ties with Fegan, the basketball agent still has a client list full of very successful NBA players, including Dwight Howard, John Wall, Ricky Rubio, Stephen Jackson, Shawn Marion, Nene, and Kevin Martin. However, Fegan needs to make sure that the aforementioned players do not feel as though they are left in the dark and neglected."
