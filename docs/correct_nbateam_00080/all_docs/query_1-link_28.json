        "text": "Richardson said he definitely wants to be in Orlando beyond this season. He was acquired in the Dec. 18 blockbuster trade with the Phoenix Suns, a deal that brought Hedo Turkoglu, Earl Clark and Richardson to Orlando for Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat and Mickael Pietrus. Richardson, who led the NBA in 3-pointers made and attempted this past season, has had preliminary talks with the Magic about a contract extension. But with the league not having a Collective Bargaining Agreement beyond July 1 and teams uncertain what the salary structures will look like next season an extension in the coming weeks isn’t expected.\n\nJason Richardson sat out a portion of Wednesday’s practice because of soreness in the bottom of his left foot, but he expects to play Thursday against the Hawks in Game 6. Richardson stepped on a piece of glass in his home Tuesday afternoon, prompting an emergency trip to the hospital and seven stitches in the bottom of his foot. He took a pain-shot before the game and said the foot felt mostly numb while he was on the court. But he walked with a noticeable limp on Wednesday, and he decided to skip the last 15 minutes of practice because of the pain.\n\nJason Richardson played through considerable pain Tuesday night after stepping on glass at his home in Orlando in the afternoon. The accident caused him to have seven stitches sewn into the bottom of his foot before the Orlando Magic’s 101-76 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday. When asked about how much it hurt, Richardson exhaled and said, “It’s tough. It hurts.” He said he won’t miss Thursday’s Game 6, but it’s possible he could be limited in Wednesday’s practice. “I’ll be ready to go,” Richardson said. “I’m a tough guy.”"
