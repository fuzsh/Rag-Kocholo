        "text": "SAGINAW, MI — A pair of all-time Michigan State University basketball greats were among the latest roster of local athletes honored for soaring above the competition during their playing days, the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame Board of Directors announced Thursday, April 27.\n\nArthur Hill High School alumnus Jason Richardson and Freeland High School alumna Victoria “Tori” Jankoska joined the hall of fame’s 2023 class along with former players, a coach and a longtime Saginaw News reporter.\n\nThat lineup included Arthur Hill football star Alfonso Boone, Swan Valley High School multi-sport star Jenni Rasmussen, Merrill High School All-State football defensive back Ken Tolfree, Frankenmuth High School speedster Don Voorheis as well as both the 2006 and 2008 girls basketball state champion teams from Nouvel Catholic Central High School.\n\nFormer Hemlock High School softball skipper Larry Graf and Saginaw News/MLive reporter Hugh Bernreuter joined the athletes on the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Class of 2023 was unveiled by 2017 inductee and onetime Arthur Hill football star Clifton Ryan. They will be honored during a banquet at 4 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 5, at Horizons Conference Center in Saginaw Township. Tickets are on sale at SaginawCountySports.org.\n\nJankoska was among the inductees in attendance at the Thursday announcement.\n\n“It means a lot for me to be here today,” she said of being part of her home county’s Sports Hall of Fame. “I played because I loved it and was passionate about basketball. Everything else that’s come after it has been just icing on the cake.”\n\nShe said her excitement was accompanied by some Spartan pride, considering she was named in the same class of inductees as another Michigan State basketball standout, Richardson, who was not in attendance Thursday.\n\nJason Richardson\n\nOf all the athletes honored Thursday, Richardson perhaps was the most recognizable name, in large part because of his championship run with Michigan State University’s basketball team and a lengthy professional career in the NBA. After winning the 2000 NCAA Championship as a Spartan, Richardson was selected No. 5 in the 2002 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors. Known as a high-flying scorer, his 15-year career ended in 2015 after stays with the Charlotte Bobcats, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe 6-foot, 6-inch shooting guard won two NBA Slam Dunk competitions and, during the 2006-06 season with the Warriors, was 13th in the league in scoring average at 23.2 points per game. With 14,644 career points, he is No. 159 on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, besting other top Michigan natives such as Jalen Rose and Derrick Coleman as well as fellow Saginaw-born baller Kenyon Martin.\n\nRichardson’s stardom first came to light in Saginaw, where he burst onto the scene as a sophomore with the 1997 Arthur Hill basketball team. He was a member of The Saginaw News Dream Team in 1998 and ‘99; he also clinched First Team All-State and All-Valley honors during that 2-year stretch. In 1999, he was named Mr. Basketball in Michigan during a season when he led the Lumberjacks team to the Class A state championship game. There, Arthur Hill fell short, 54-47, to Ann Arbor High School.\n\nA member of the 1999 McDonald’s All-American Team, Richardson’s No. 23 jersey was retired by Arthur Hill.\n\nVictoria “Tori” Jankoska\n\nJankoska was a four-time All-State basketball player during her career at Freeland High School, from 2010-13. Her 2,333 career points ranks her No. 1 on the all-time scoring list among high school teams in Saginaw County and No. 9 in the state. She earned the 2013 Michigan Miss Basketball Award.\n\nAt Michigan State, from 2013-17, she became the women’s basketball program’s all-time leader in points, three-point shots made, and field goals made as well as No. 2 all-time in assists. She averaged 16.9 points per game during her four years in college, including 22.6 points per game during her senior campaign.\n\nShe was drafted No. 9 in the WNBA draft and later played for the Polish basketball team, Basket Gdynia.\n\nJankoska now serves as an assistant coach with the Virginia women’s basketball team.\n\nAlfonso Boone\n\nBoone, a fellow Lumberjack joining Richardson this year in the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame, also enjoyed a long career in the pros. In 11 NFL seasons, the defensive end started on 41 of 129 games played on franchises including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears, Kansas City Chiefs and San Diego Chargers. He retired after the 2010 season, racking up 129 tackles and 15.5 sacks from 2000-10.\n\nBoone first disrupted offenses in Saginaw, though, including as a member of Arthur Hill’s 1991 state champion football team. He also was a member of the 1992 squad that came within one score of repeating as state champions.\n\nHe played collegiately at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California. There, he twice was selected to the All-Mission Conference team and was named Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nJenni Rasmussen\n\nAt Swan Valley, Rasmussen was a standout on the basketball, volleyball and softball teams in the late 1990s.\n\nShe tallied 91 career pitching victories and 979 career strikeouts, including 412 strikeouts during the 1999 season. That softball career included six no-hitters during her senior year as well as four perfect games. She tied for second in the state for lowest ERA that season. The Michigan High School Softball Coaches Association in 1999 named her Miss Softball.\n\nShe later played softball at Central Michigan University, where she was named to the All-Mid-American Conference team in 2002 while posting an 8-0 conference record. There, she helped lead the program to conference championships in 2000 and 2002.\n\nKen Tolfree\n\nA 1975 Merrill High School graduate, Tolfree was named All-Valley, All-County and All-State in football during his season season. He also earned All-Conference accolades in basketball and baseball. For the latter program, he remains the school’s all-time stolen base leader.\n\nHe enrolled at what is now Saginaw Valley State University and played for the football program from 1976-79, when he became the institution’s all-time interception leader with 22. He also was named to the All-Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference teams in 1978 and 1979 as well as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics All-American team his senior year, when he helped the Cardinals advance to the playoffs.\n\nDon Voorheis\n\nA 1959 Frankenmuth High School graduate, Voorheis at one time was known as the fastest high school runner in both the county and state. He won state championships for the 220-yard dash in 1957, 1958 and 1959; and the 100-yard dash in ‘58 and ‘59. His performances in several of those state title competitions were the fastest ever recorded at the time.\n\nVoorheis also led Frankenmuth’s football team in scoring while playing running back for three years.\n\nHe also was named Thumb B Conference MVP in basketball while playing for the high school.\n\nLater, he competed in track at Michigan State.\n\nNouvel Catholic Central High School 2006, 2008 girls basketball teams\n\nThe Nouvel Catholic Central girls basketball team clinched its second-ever state title in 2006, defeating Flint Hamady High School, 65-56. The 28-0 team was led by sophomore Jenny Ryan, who set a championship game record when she scored 17 points in the first quarter. She finished the game with a career-high 30 points.\n\nThe 2006 season marked the last time the state’s girls basketball competition was played in the fall. So, when the Panthers won a second title in the winter of 2008, it was part of consecutive championship runs. That roster bested Galesburg-Augusta High School, 73-42, to earn the 2008 title. Senior Kelly Kretz led the way with a game-high 20 points and eight rebounds. Ryan, who was named Associated Press Class C Player of the Year that season, set a championship game record with 12 steals. She also scored her 1,000th career point during the contest.\n\nLarry Graf\n\nAs a head softball coach, Graf’s teams won three Tri-Valley Conference West Division championships and appeared in three state Final Four competitions. His career record was 702-272. Graf began his coaching career in 1986 at Hemlock High School, where the softball field later was named in the former coach’s honor.\n\nGraf was inducted into the Michigan High School Softball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2006 and the Michigan Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHugh Bernreuter\n\nColloquially known as “The Mad Bavarian” because of his Frankenmuth roots, Bernreuter joined The Saginaw News in 1986 and continues to write for the publication, which now is part of MLive. He has won 46 writing awards from United Press International, Michigan Associated Press, and the Michigan Press Association in categories including sports columns, sports features and sports writing. His coverage has included Super Bowls, MLB playoffs, college football bowl games and NCAA men’s basketball playoffs.\n\nBefore going pro as a reporter, he was a beat writer covering Spartans basketball at Michigan State.\n\nBernreuter serves as a member of both the Harry Hawkins award committee and the Detroit Lions High School Coach of the Week panel.\n\nRead more on MLive:\n\nParty on McCarty summer concert series to launch with ‘80s music in Saginaw Township\n\nSaginaw Art Museum to host exhibition featuring Philadelphia artist’s work"
