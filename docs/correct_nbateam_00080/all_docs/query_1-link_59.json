        "text": "Staged at Stadium 29, the National Training Camp is the culmination of the 2018 Jr. NBA Thailand presented by Foremost program. Richardson will help coach 100 boys and girls selected through Jr. NBA Coaches Academy workshops and the Regional Selection Camp. At the end of the National Training Camp, eight boys and eight girls will be named as the 2018 Jr. NBA Thailand All-Stars. Together with their counterparts from Southeast Asia, the 2018 Jr. NBA Thailand All-Stars will travel to Shanghai in October to attend NBA China Games 2018 featuring the Philadelphia 76ers and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n“Basketball is a great way for kids to stay active and learn important values that will serve them both on and off the court, and I’m eager to play a part in the development of young Thai athletes of the Jr. NBA program,” said Richardson.\n\n“Foremost continues to advocate for children in Thailand to embrace healthy and active lifestyles,” said Dr. Olarn Chowiwattana, Corporate Affairs Director of FrieslandCampina Thailand. “By participating in the Jr. NBA Thailand program and interacting with world-class athletes like Jason Richardson, boys and girls in Thailand can learn about the importance of physical activity through basketball while incorporating milk into their diets.”\n\nRichardson, a 6’ 6” guard from Saginaw, Michigan, was selected 5th overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 2001 NBA Draft. A two-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion, Richardson also played for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Charlotte Hornets), Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers, averaging 17.1 points, 5 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.2 steals per game in 14 seasons in the NBA.\n\nThe Jr. NBA, the league’s global youth basketball participation program for boys and girls, teaches the fundamental skills as well as the core values of the game at the grassroots level in an effort to help grow and improve the youth basketball experience for players, coaches and parents. During the 2017-18 season, the NBA reached more than 26 million youth in 71 countries through a variety of camps, clinics, skills challenges, league play and outreach events.\n\nIn addition to presenting partner Foremost, the event is also supported by official partners Advanced Info Service (AIS) and Gatorade. MONO and TrueVisions are official media partners of the Jr. NBA in Thailand, while Spalding serves as a supporting partner. The program is also conducted in association with the Embassy of the United States in Bangkok."
