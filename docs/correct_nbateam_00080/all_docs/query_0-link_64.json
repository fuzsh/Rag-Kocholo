        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The Orlando Magic acquired troubled guard Gilbert Arenas from the Washington Wizards and Hedo Turkoglu and former Arthur Hill and Michigan State star Jason Richardson from the Phoenix Suns in a major roster shakeup Saturday.\n\nOrlando traded forward Rashard Lewis for Arenas, then sent Vince Carter, Mickael Pietrus and backup center Marcin Gortat to Phoenix. Orlando also received Earl Clark from the Suns.\n\nThe Magic are 16-9 but had lost five of their last six games and slipped from first to fourth in the Eastern Conference. The slide was magnified by winning streaks of 11 games by Miami and 12 by the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Magic are just the latest Eastern Confrence team to shake up their roster.\n\nMiami added LeBron James and Chris Bosh in the offseason, of course. They’re 20-8 and trail only 21-4 Boston in the East.\n\nBut the Bulls also added Utah’s Carlos Boozer, Kyle Korver and Ronnie Brewer. The Bulls, 41-41 last year entered Saturday with a 16-8 record.\n\nNew York picked up free agent forward Amare Stoudemire and point guard Raymond Felton as part of an overhaul that brought 10 new players. The Knicks went 29-53 last season, but are 16-11.\n\nIndiana, 32-50 last year, traded for Darren Collison and James Posey and are 12-13 and in a playoff spot.\n\nAtlanta (17-11) and Milwaukee (10-14) are the other current playoff teams.\n\n“Now, the East is really a totally different scenario with all the trades that happened,” the Pacers’ Danny Granger said. “It’s really wide open. I kind of like how it’s different than it has been in past years.”"
