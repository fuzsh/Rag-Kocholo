        "text": "The Lakers will send All-Star center Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers, who also will receive shooting guard Jason Richardson from the Orlando Magic. The Sixers will send guard Andre Iguodala to the Denver Nuggets. The Magic will receive Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, rookie swingman Moe Harkless, forward Josh McRoberts, three protected first-round draft picks and a 2013 second-round pick from the Nuggets (by way of Golden State). In addition to Howard, the Lakers will also receive Earl Clark and Chris Duhon from the Magic.\n\nThe Nuggets are very fond of Afflalo, but Iguodala could be viewed as an upgrade. The Magic would view the Denver guard as a future building block while Gasol is either a piece they can hold onto or turn around in another deal. For the numbers to work, Orlando would have to move another player, expected to be Jason Richardson, who would re-route to either the Lakers or Nuggets. Should the Rocket miss out on both Howard and Bynum, they may have interest in Gasol. While they may not give up as much to the Magic, Orlando could be looking at a solid return in a subsequent Gasol trade to Houston."
