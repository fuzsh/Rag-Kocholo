        "text": "Jason was selected to coach in the Mass Elite youth camp this week. He did an excellent job of teaching technique and being a great example for the players. He has received some attention from the NCAA, and should continue to as the summer rolls on. He has demonstrated skills on film also. On defense, he plays with power and uses a mix of moves to get into the backfield. On offense, he can pull to the edge and looks to finish every block. Keep and eye out for this captain this fall."
