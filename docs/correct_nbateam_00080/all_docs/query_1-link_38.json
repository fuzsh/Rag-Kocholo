        "text": "The Magic allowed Turkoglu to leave via a sign-and-trade during free agency in 2009. Turkoglu signed a five-year, $53 million deal and was sent to the Toronto Raptors for cash considerations and a trade exception.\n\nTo replace him the Magic traded Courtney Lee, Rafer Alton, and Tony Battie to the New Jersey Nets for Carter and Ryan Anderson.\n\nTurkoglu disappointed in Toronto and was shipped to Phoenix for Leandro Barbosa and Dwayne Jones during the offseason where he has again underperformed. Carter struggled initially with the Magic but got better as last season went on. Still, his reputation for milking injuries and not being a clutch performer have followed him around throughout his career.\n\nTurkoglu enjoyed the best period of his career in Orlando and evidently the Magic believe that he'll thrive once again with the team."
