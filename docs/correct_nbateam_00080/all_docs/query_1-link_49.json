        "text": "Jameer Nelson received a few invitations to attend games during the 2018-19 NBA season, but he declined them all. He wanted to continue his playing career, and because of that, it just did not feel right to visit a professional arena as a spectator. Going as a fan would have felt like he had closed a door that he wanted to keep open.\n\nBut now that the Orlando Magic have reached the playoffs, Nelson happily would make an exception for the team’s first-round series against the Toronto Raptors.\n\n“I would love to come to a game,” Nelson said during a phone interview. “I’ve always told people I’m not going to go to an NBA game until I’m ready to go. And this is the ideal situation. If I can get things handled here (in Philadelphia) with my family for a day or two, I’ll definitely try to get down there to support.”\n\nSeeing the Magic qualify for the postseason for the first time in seven years means something special to Nelson. He spent the bulk of his career in Orlando, and the franchise believed in him when some others did not.\n\nNelson, a co-captain of the Magic’s last playoff team, the 2011-12 squad coached by Stan Van Gundy, knows something about building a winner. Nelson had helped the franchise develop into a title contender, and it pained him to see the team plunge toward the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings and remain there year after year. It hurt to see fans suffer through a rebuilding project that went on and on and on with no end in sight.\n\nNelson said he feels ecstatic for Orlando now, and he is not alone in his joy. Many of his former teammates and coaches from the Magic’s last playoff club feel the same way, including Quentin Richardson, Ish Smith, Hedo Turkoglu and, of course, Van Gundy. They never lost their affection for the city or for Magic coach Steve Clifford, who was an assistant on Van Gundy’s Magic staff from 2007-12. Those were the franchise’s glory days, and they included an NBA Finals appearance in 2009.\n\nOn Sunday night, Van Gundy watched on TV as the Magic clinched their playoff berth by beating the Boston Celtics 116-108.\n\n“I wasn’t overly nervous for Steve because even if they didn’t win that game I thought they’d get the job done, anyway,” Van Gundy said during a phone interview. “But I wanted to be able to see the look on his face and the happiness when they got in. That’s what I was really tuned in for. I just wanted to see the celebration.\n\n“I just know how hard this was. Steve is very unselfish and he’ll never talk about himself, but I hope he feels a great sense of accomplishment. I think to take over a team where the core had been together and not had success and to change that whole culture and mindset, to get guys to be mentally tougher and to stay the course and to believe in themselves (is very difficult). Then they were at 20-31, and he just stayed consistent and kept holding guys accountable but also got them to believe in themselves. I know that is a very, very difficult thing to do.”\n\nAfter the final buzzer Sunday, the Fox Sports Florida telecast showed Clifford smiling on the sideline as he shook swingman Wes Iwundu’s hand and received a hug from rookie center Mo Bamba. A short while later, the broadcast showed Clifford beaming outside the team’s locker room, necktie discarded, as he congratulated players.\n\n“To see that big smile out of him made my day,” Van Gundy said.\n\nVan Gundy immediately sent Clifford a congratulatory text message.\n\nThirty minutes after the final buzzer, as Clifford was walking out of Boston’s TD Garden, he received a phone call. On the line was Turkoglu, one of the players Clifford worked closely with during the Magic’s heyday, calling from Istanbul, where he serves as an adviser to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n“Yeah, he called, obviously with advice about how to do things the rest of the way,” Clifford said, feigning anguish. “Jameer had advice, too. All those guys, I love ’em, but they’re experts, you know?\n\n“We had a close team,” Clifford added. “I stay in touch with a lot of those guys. Those were great years, great years. You go through the games that we went through in those years, I think you have a bond that you’ll never lose.”\n\nRichardson, a Chicagoan who spent two seasons with the Magic, decided to settle in Central Florida after his playing career ended. He has visited several of the team’s practices and games this season, and he said he wants to congratulate Clifford face-to-face. Richardson, now an analyst for “The Bounce,” a Yahoo Sports weekly studio show, plans to attend Games 3 and 4 of the series at Amway Center on Apr. 19 and 21.\n\nNo one could keep Richardson away, not that anyone would want to. He played 13 NBA seasons and made many friendships during and after his playing career. His is close with Magic point guard D.J. Augustin, center Nikola Vucevic and forward Jonathan Isaac. Richardson is especially proud of Isaac, a 21-year-old who was mentored at Florida State by one of Richardson’s closest childhood friends, Seminoles assistant coach Dennis Gates.\n\nRichardson also knows Magic president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman and Magic GM John Hammond. Weltman and Hammond worked for the Los Angeles Clippers when Richardson was a rookie there during the 2000-01 season.\n\nFor Richardson, the Magic’s turnaround has been especially gratifying because he knows so many of the people involved.\n\n“As a fan looking at it, everybody’s been waiting for them to get back on the right track,” Richardson said by phone. “With Jeff and John, since they’ve come in, they definitely have the needle pointed in the right direction. I’m just happy for them getting to taste this real success, and I think it’s something that they could really build on for the future.”\n\nThe 2011-12 season was Richardson’s last with the Magic, and that campaign will be remembered as one of the most controversial and drama-filled in the franchise’s 30-year history. Before the season even began, perennial All-Star Dwight Howard requested a trade. In the months that followed, team officials’ efforts to convince Howard to change his mind gripped Orlando and the rest of the NBA.\n\nHoward’s Magic teammates were passengers on an up-and-down roller coaster beset with dizzying highs and demoralizing lows. In mid-March, in a stunning surprise on the eve of the trade deadline, Howard waived a clause in his contract that would have enabled him to become a free agent at the end of the season. It seemed like Howard would remain in Orlando long term.\n\nThe warm feelings from that announcement — one team officials trumpeted with a press conference — evaporated when, after weeks of rumors, Van Gundy confirmed during a game-day shootaround on Apr. 5 that Howard had gone to the team’s uppermost management and told them he wanted Van Gundy fired.\n\nTwo days later, despite back pain, Howard scored 20 points and collected 22 rebounds in Philadelphia as the Magic defeated the 76ers 88-82.\n\nNo one knew it then, but Howard would never play another game for Orlando.\n\nCiting his sore back, Howard soon left town. The situation had gotten so divisive and so emotional that people speculated Howard had made up the back injury and was lashing out at Van Gundy and the team for the coach’s revelation that Howard wanted him fired.\n\nThe truth was, Howard did have a serious back injury — one that required surgery. In the years since, Howard has never been quite as explosive as he was before his surgery.\n\nHoward’s Magic teammates and coaches made do without him. They held a 33-23 record as of Howard’s last game but finished the regular season 4-6. The players — a group that included Ryan Anderson, Glen “Big Baby” Davis, Chris Duhon, J.J. Redick and Jason Richardson — grew closer in Howard’s absence.\n\n“Even without Dwight, we fought our tails off to get to where we were,” Nelson said. “There were a lot of distractions that year, a lot of things going on. But we stuck together. There was some rough times. There was a lot of uncertainty. But for the most part, things were positive.\n\n“When you have a guy like Dwight, who at the time was, in my opinion, one of the top-five players (in the world) — definitely the top big man — he was so dominant that we relied on him for a lot. And we couldn’t do that anymore. He wasn’t playing, so we had to come together and figure things out, kind of redo the way we played a little bit, and we were successful with it, mainly because of the coaches and the type of character we had as a team and as individuals.”\n\nThe late-season slide dropped the Magic to the sixth seed, and they faced the up-and-coming Indiana Pacers in the first round.\n\nThe Magic were heavy underdogs, but they won Game 1 in Indianapolis 81-77 as Nelson and Jason Richardson scored 17 points apiece and Davis added 16 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks.\n\n“We went out there without our All-Star and our best player, Dwight, and we fought,” Quentin Richardson recalled. “We laid it on the line, undermanned and outmatched. I just remember Big Baby playing out of his mind and doing everything he could and … everybody collectively coming together and really trying to fight and get a victory.”\n\nOrlando lost Game 2 by 15 points and Game 3 at Amway Center by 23.\n\nIsh Smith, the Magic’s third-string point guard back then, recently recalled that the Pacers kept the Magic “at arm’s distance, like a boxer” in those games.\n\nBut in a sign of how tough-minded the Magic were, they nearly won Game 4 in perhaps the loudest, most tension-filled game at Amway Center before or since. The Magic ended up losing in overtime 101-99.\n\n“That game was so close,” Van Gundy said. “It’s those games where you go back as a coach and (ponder) different moves … because one bucket or one stop can turn the game. Those are the ones that drive you crazy.”\n\nIn Game 5 in Indianapolis, the Magic were eliminated 105-87.\n\nVan Gundy never coached another game for Orlando. Two weeks later, he was fired. The franchise also let general manager Otis Smith go.\n\nIn the months that followed, the team hired Rob Hennigan as its new GM, and Howard continued to demand a trade. In August, Hennigan completed a four-team deal that sent Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Magic also traded away Earl Clark, Duhon and Jason Richardson.\n\nOnly one player who came to Orlando in that trade remains on the Magic roster, center Nikola Vucevic.\n\nAt the time, many people expected the Magic to tear down the roster in an effort to rebuild it through the draft. The team sent Anderson to New Orleans in a sign-and-trade deal. During the 2012-13 season, it traded Redick and Ish Smith to Milwaukee.\n\nVucevic and Nelson played two seasons together in Orlando. After the 2013-14 campaign, Nelson and the Magic mutually parted ways.\n\n“Jameer is a guy I respect a lot,” Vucevic said recently. “He helped me a lot when I came here and my first two years (with the organization). A great guy. A great veteran to have. I wish we had kept him longer because he would have been great for some of the young guys that we had.”\n\nNo one knew just how long the rebuild would last, that it would take a total of seven years before the franchise returned to the playoffs.\n\nVan Gundy eventually returned to the NBA, joining the Pistons in 2014 as their president of basketball operations and coach. His tenure in Detroit lasted four seasons. This past fall, he and his wife, Kim, moved back to Lake Mary, an Orlando suburb. He works for ESPN as a commentator and basketball analyst and has taught a sports business course this semester at Stetson University.\n\nHe remains a celebrity in Central Florida. In the days before Sunday’s playoff-clincher, some strangers approached him around town and asked if he thought the Magic would reach the postseason.\n\nVan Gundy raves about the Magic’s progression under Clifford. Since Jan. 31, when they were 20-31, Clifford’s team has flourished. It has gone 22-9, the third-best record in the NBA over that period.\n\nVan Gundy noted the Magic’s offense and bench have improved significantly in recent months.\n\n“They were always pretty good defensively, but now, since the start of February, they’re first or second in the league defensively,” Van Gundy said. “They’re just really solid, and I think when you watch them, you see a real belief on the part of the players, a belief in what they’re doing and a commitment to getting the job done. Even if it’s not going well and a team is scoring (against them) a little bit, nobody panics and goes off on his own. They stay the course.\n\n“They’ve really been good to the point of I think they have a chance to beat anybody. I’m not saying I would make them the favorites. I wouldn’t want to put that pressure on them, anyway. But I think they have a chance because 30 games (of high-level play) is different than a five-game stretch or a 10-game stretch. Thirty games is a long time, so they have been playing at this level for a long time. I have no reason to doubt that they can continue to play at this level.”\n\nIsh Smith, 30, recently completed his ninth NBA regular season and his third regular season with the Pistons. On Wednesday night, Detroit clinched a playoff berth of its own. As the regular season wound down, Smith acknowledged he was rooting for Orlando to reach the postseason on one condition: that the Magic qualifying for the playoffs would not negatively impact his Pistons.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of friends that still live in Orlando,” Smith said. “My old barber still lives there. I follow him on (Instagram) and sure enough, he put, ‘We’re going to the playoffs!’ They’re happy and excited. When you get in, you don’t know what can happen.\n\n“I’m happy for them. Vucevic is a friend of mine. He was there when I was there. Competing against those guys, they’re playing hot. They’re playing well at the right time. That’s what you want.”\n\nQuentin Richardson, through his visits to Magic practices and games, has watched up close as the team has matured.\n\n“I think they’ve been doing it collectively over the course of the year,” Richardson said. “I think they’re getting more and more used to Coach Cliff’s system. They’re buying into things. Just the way they’ve done it (has been impressive), rallying around Voochie and Voochie being the driving force, basically the All-Star and the leader of the team. The young guys, they’ve added to it. It’s been refreshing to watch, great to watch. I was glad they didn’t come up short.”\n\nNelson, now 37, played for five teams after the Magic waived him.\n\nBut he has not played in a postseason game since May 8, 2012, when the Pacers eliminated the Magic.\n\nNow he has some hard-earned knowledge about the playoffs he wants to pass along to the Magic’s current players.\n\n“One thing I take from it is you have to cherish those moments,” Nelson said. “You don’t know when you’re going to get back. You don’t know when you’re going to have a good team again. You don’t know when you’re going to be around a basketball mind like Stan’s or Cliff’s. So take advantage of it in the right way.\n\n“That’s one thing that I would tell these guys: Just cherish the moment and don’t get outside of yourself. Be who you are and continue to play the same way in the playoffs that got you here.”\n\nPerhaps Nelson will have the chance to say that in person at Amway Center.\n\n“I want to get that feeling of being inside the arena,” Nelson said. “That gives me goosebumps right now, just thinking about the atmosphere that was around us during that time period of us making the playoffs five years in a row with Stan.”\n\n— James Edwards III of The Athletic staff contributed to this report.\n\n(Top photo of Nelson and Van Gundy: Joshua C.
