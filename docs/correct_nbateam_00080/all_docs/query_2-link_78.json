        "text": "\"When searching for a keynote presenter for the 2020 Sailing Leadership Forum, US Sailing was looking for someone from a sport background who can inspire the leaders of the sailing community to work together to achieve success both individually and as part of a team. Dr. Richardson took the time to understand the sailing community to make the session relevant and impactful. He asked questions, did his own research and came to the event prepared to deliver. Jason’s keynote presentation delivered exactly what the sailing community needed to hear. He inspired the audience on a personal level to analyze their own belief system and determine what is holding one back from growth. At a team leadership level he delivered a message of finding clarity, purpose and working together to achieve success. Attendee feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Some session evaluation comments included “Interactive, engaging, funny, and relevant as we all work to do our best to progress this sport in a variety of communities and along a mix of pathways.” “inspiring” “empowering” “energetic” “engaging” “I felt personally recharged. He knows what makes us tick. And how to share that in a way to pry my aperture open for learning” We look forward to inviting Dr. Jason Richardson back to present at future events! \"\n\nKatie Ouellette - US Sailing\n\nMembership Engagement Director\n\n\"Dr. Richardson has the proven ability to improve the performance of both individuals and organizations.
