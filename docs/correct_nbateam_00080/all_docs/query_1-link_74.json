        "text": "Mumbai, Oct 28 (IANS) Former NBA player Jason Richardson will begin a three-day promotional tour of India on October 29 to support the continued growth of basketball and to interact with fans.\n\nRichardson will travel to New Delhi and Ahmedabad to conduct basketball clinics for players and coaches alike and engage with fans at two of NBA’s premier events in India – the Jr. NBA programme and NBA Jam.\n\nRichardson will make his first stop in New Delhi on October 29 where he will engage with Ramjas School students as part of the Reliance Foundation Jr. NBA programme — a comprehensive youth basketball initiative that applies the values of basketball to positively impact the lives of Indian boys and girls.\n\nThen he will go to Ahmedabad on October 30 to participate in NBA Jam powered by Jabong at the MICA Institute where fans will have the chance to meet him. Richardson will then visit Mumbai on October 31 for a live television appearance on Sony Six’s NBA morning show ‘Around the Hoop’.\n\n“I understand that basketball is growing rapidly in India and I can’t wait to experience the excitement firsthand. It’s encouraging to know just how many boys and girls across the country are picking up the sport and I look forward to meeting with some of the promising young talent India has to offer,” said Richardson.\n\nAt six feet and six inches, Richardson was a guard/forward from Saginaw, Michigan, and was selected fifth overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 2001 NBA Draft. Over the course of his 14-year NBA career, Richardson also played for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Charlotte Hornets), Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers before retiring in 2015.\n\nRichardson was named in the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2002 and is a two-time NBA Slam Dunk Champion (2002 and 2003)."
