word // Brandon Richard

A mid-season trade sent shooting guard Jason Richardson from sunny Phoenix to just as sunny Orlando where he'd fill the void left by a departing Vince Carter. Since joining the Magic, J-Rich has had his ups and downs, which he openly admits. Making the transition from a point guard dominated team to a squad where the center dictates the offense is a tough task, but one that Richardson confronts head on. The rest of the season will act as somewhat of an audition for J-Rich, who will be a free agent as season's end.

As of last April, Richardson is also a member of Team PEAK, one of the Chinese sneaker brands trying to expand business stateside. On the court, he's been wearing Player Exclusive colorways of the PEAK Team Dynamic sneaker since his days in Phoenix. In the video below, PEAK caught up with Richardson in the locker room to get his thoughts on his new team and wearing PEAK kicks. We also get a nice look at J-Rich's Orlando Magic Away Team Dynamic PE. Check it out.
