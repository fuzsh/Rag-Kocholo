        "text": "The New Yorker, May 27, 1996 P. 94\n\nANNALS OF SCIENCE about fraud charges leveled David Baltimore... Baltimore won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1975, when he was a 37 year old professor of biology at M.I.T. 37 is young for a Nobel, but Baltimore had been known among biologists as a wunderkind for some time. The work for which he shared his prize, astudy of how a special class of viruses reproduce themselves, ran contrary to most beliefs on the subject at the time. Describnes how Baltimore was never suspected of faking anything himself, but he had stubbornly defended the work of someone who was--a biomedical scientist at M.I.T. named Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who was one of six coauthors of the disputed paper, which was published in the journal Cell in 1986... Baltimore's support of her work was perceived to be unprofessional and unwise, if not irresponsible. The Baltimore case touched deep-seated doubts about the scientific enterprise. It has now dragged on for a decade, leaving wrecked careers in its wake, pitting congressmen against scientists, and producing both martyrs and tormentors... He stepped down as President of Rockefeller University as a result of the controversy... The woman who brought the accusations against Imanishi Kari was Margot O'Toole... There would have been no Baltimore case without O'Toole, a postdoctoral fellow whom Imanishi-Kari had hired to work in her lab at M.I.T. in the summer of 1985... Tells how Imanishi-Kari had invented a system to provide a way of getting at some of the details of the process of producing antibodies... O'Toole was assigned to do the tests & much of the controversy arose from the dubious results she recorded & noted as recorded in the tests... Tells how the paper's co-authors were forced to publish a retraction of sorts about incorrect data she uncovered & how this led to a congressional investigation... It is now ten years since O'Toole first raised her questions against Imanishi-Kari. Apparently most of the charges against Imanishi-Kari will be dropped.... Describes investigations by Rep. John D. Dingell, as well as by scientistific invetigatorss Walter Stewart & Ned Feder..."
