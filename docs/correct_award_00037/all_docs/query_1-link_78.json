        "text": "Dr. David Baltimore, was the presenter of the Nelson Mandela Science Lecture\n\nat Wittsvaterstrand(WITS) University in Johannesburg, South Africa on\n\nOctober 5th. As the event organizer, I documented Dr. Baltimore's trip to\n\nSouth Africa and Rwanda.\n\nShortly after arriving in Johannesburg two weeks ago, Dr. Baltimore was\n\npreparing to give the event's keynote lecture, concerning the many\n\napproaches to curing the viruses that pose the greatest danger to humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the crowd gathering to hear him in the auditorium was unaware that\n\nthere were events beyond their control taking place outside on the\n\nuniversity campus. Sparked by a rise in student fees, student demonstrators\n\nwere taking over the campus.\n\nWhen I informed Dr. Baltimore of the precarious situation developing outside\n\nhe reacted coolly, saying he would continue the lecture despite the noisy\n\ndistraction coming from the protesting students outside the auditorium.\n\nOn the way to Dr. Baltimore's lecture, he, myself and Dr. Wilmot James, head\n\nof the Africa Genome Education Institute, visited Nelson Mandela at his\n\nFoundation. Dr. James wrote the forward to one of Mandela's biographies.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dr. Baltimore told Mandela that he had just endorsed\n\nHillary Clinton for President, due to his approval of her newly announced\n\nscientific agenda. Dr. Baltimore stated that he would do all in his power to\n\naid research in the United States that will hopefully soon lead to a vaccine\n\nor cure for the HIV/AIDS virus.\n\nWe went on to WITS at noon for the lecture. As David Baltimore rose to speak\n\nthere was a smoke and thunder of voices, rattling of the doors at the back\n\nof the Great Hall at WITS. Protestors threatened to disrupt the third\n\nannual Nelson Mandela Science Lecture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaltimore, the President Emeritus and Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of\n\nBiology at CalTech whose work on the identification of reverse transcriptase\n\nthe mechanism by which retroviruses, like HIV, infect cells -- earned him the\n\n1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine at the age of 37.\n\nAfrica, with 10% of the world's population, has 60% of its infections. In\n\n1994 South Africa, at the dawn of transition to majority rule, already had\n\n850,000 people infected with HIV. In 2007, largely as a result of\n\ngovernment negligence and the promotion of \"alternative\" remedies such as\n\ngarlic and beetroot, there are 5.5 million South Africans who are HIV\n\npositive. Surprisingly this is the first time that Baltimore has been to\n\nJohannesburg and Rwanda.\n\nThe students outside the Great Hall, held back by campus security, weren't\n\nconcerned about AIDS. They were protesting the university's decision to\n\nraise fees, expressing their displeasure by emptying garbage out of bins and\n\ninterrupting lectures nothing violent. It is said that approx 20% of\n\nstudents at WITS are HIV positive.\n\nInside the hall a student yelled to Baltimore, \"You're my hero! You rock!\"\n\nBaltimore laughed.\n\nHIV was identified in 1981 and is now the most studied virus in science.\n\nIt is also history's most destructive, estimated to have been responsible\n\nfor the deaths of 25 million people. Three years ago the Gates Foundation\n\noffered grants for the study of audacious new approaches to combating HIV.\n\nBaltimore was one of the recipients for a gene therapy approach and he is\n\nnow building the tools necessary for it to work.\n\nIn the speech, Baltimore said that if you are going to think about the most\n\ncomplicated issues in science, then you must be prepared to be wrong. That doesn't ameliorate the awful disappointment at the\n\nfailure of the phase II Merck HIV vaccine trial. Merck's vaccine was hoped\n\nto stimulate an immune response in the body's T-cells, enabling them to\n\nrecognize and destroy the HIV virus. The greatest difficulty facing vaccine\n\nresearchers has been that none of their laboratory subjects (chimpanzees\n\nand/or mice) are affected by HIV in the precisely the same way as humans,\n\nmaking it nearly impossible to tell how a vaccine will work in a human\n\npopulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaltimore said he had found a way around this impasse by using gene therapy\n\nto create a mouse, which has an immune system highly similar to humans.\n\nOne-day-old mice are injected with human stem cells that then supplant the\n\nmice's own immune systems.\n\nGene therapy requires that new genes be incorporated into the human genome\n\nto express new proteins to combat HIV in novel ways. \"Interestingly,\" says\n\nBaltimore, \"the virus that is a natural for this role is HIV itself.\"\n\n\"Retroviruses operate by integrating themselves into their host's DNA\" he\n\nexplained in the lecture. \"The enzyme responsible for kicking off the\n\nprocess that synthesises a DNA copy of the RNA virus is reverse\n\ntranscriptase. Interfere with the operation of reverse transcriptase and HIV\n\nis unable to function. Many of the anti-viral therapies for HIV have taken\n\nthis approach.\"\n\nBaltimore himself is now building genes to target the enzyme the\n\nidentification of which earned him his Nobel Prize.\n\nA science student at WITS asked Baltimore, \"How does one target the action of reverse transcriptase?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer from Baltimore was: \"Micro RNA is a very exciting new discovery\n\nof one approach. Micro RNA (miRNA) are tiny lengths of RNA, containing no\n\ngenes, which regulate gene expression directly. The miRNA is complementary\n\nto messenger RNA (which carries the code for protein production) and acts to\n\ndampen gene expression. In other words, it is an off switch.\"\n\nOther points of note from Baltimore's remarks were:\n\n1. Novel miRNAs could be produced to interfere with HIV RNA synthesis to\n\nDNA. 500 miRNAs have been identified and there is an enormous amount of work\n\nstill to perform. Baltimore has just been appointed to be head of a\n\nscientific panel advising a new business looking into this.\n\n2. Another area is histone modification. Histones are proteins which act as\n\nspools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene expression. They\n\ncould be used to turn whole regions of genes on or off. However, gene\n\napproaches run risks of how patients respond.\n\n3. Amgen, a company where Baltimore is a director, has a drug called\n\nVectibix. It is used for the treatment of colorectal cancer and inhibits\n\nthe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr). They have recently discovered\n\nthat only 15% of patients respond to the therapy. It appears that the bulk\n\nof patients have EGFr genes with mutations downstream of the gene that are\n\nsufficient to prevent the efficacy of the drug.\n\n4. It could be that a gene therapy approach to HIV runs into similar\n\ncomplications. This opens up the necessity for pharmacogenetics where\n\nremedies are targeted to specific expressions of particular ailments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It may be that I can't pull off the gene therapy approach,\" said Baltimore,\n\nat the end of the hour long lecture. \"But I think we will. The Gates\n\nFoundation only wants to fund things that are a great challenge. If you\n\nspend a lifetime in research doing this you'll probably never get funded.\n\nBut, occasionally, you've got to be willing to take a giant leap.\"\n\nThe applause was deafening at the conclusion of the talk. Baltimore was\n\nthanked profusely by the WITS University Chancellor and the director of the\n\nDepartment of Science. The students had stayed away from the lecture hall as\n\nHIV/AIDS was not their concern that day.\n\nOn his return to Pasadena from Africa earlier this week I called Baltimore\n\nfor news of his visit to the President of Rwanda. He was elated by his trip\n\nto Africa and explained: \"Rwanda is the leader in AIDS research. Rwanda is\n\nspecial. They are building a country on the back of genocide. They are\n\ncommitted to do the right thing. They have the best system in the world for\n\nmonitoring AIDS treatment. Built and run by them with their own software.\""
