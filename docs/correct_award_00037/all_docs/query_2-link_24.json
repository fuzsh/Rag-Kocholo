Named after Nobel prize-winning scientist David Baltimore, this Chair honors the tremendous legacy of Whitehead Institute's Founding Director. Under Baltimore’s leadership, Whitehead Institute became one of the world’s preeminent institutions for foundational biomedical research.\n\nCreated in 2023, the Chair's inaugural incumbent is Mary Gehring, Whitehead Institute Member and professor of biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gehring is a plant biologist whose current work focuses on the epigenetics underpinning the resiliency and nutritional content of food crop plants.\n\nThe Baltimore Chair is underwritten by an endowment created by generous donors."
