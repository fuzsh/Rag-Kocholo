        "text": "In the midst of a public health crisis, David Baltimore can be trusted to offer reason and rational thinking when the climate is so often dominated by misinformation and distrust.\n\nAfter all, the Nobel laureate, FasterCures board member, and president emeritus; Robert Andrews Millikan professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, has dealt with this sort of thing before.\n\nHis impressive career has been defined by groundbreaking research into virology, genetics, and DNA; and he’s been at the forefront of efforts to mitigate HIV and AIDS. Speaking to Mike, he outlines the challenges of treating COVID-19, while reiterating that—despite the obstacles—there is reason to be hopeful."
