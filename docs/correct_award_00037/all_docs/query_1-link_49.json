        "text": "Robyn Williams: And so to a Nobel winner who first appeared in this program in 1975. His work was a great example of research that comes into its own, like lasers and relativity, when at first you don't know how they may be useful. His revelation of the way viruses take over the cell and its DNA, how the enzyme transcriptase operates, were the key to tackling HIV/AIDS and many cancers. He was until recently president of the famed Caltech campus and is still working there. So what does he think about Covid?\n\nDavid Baltimore: Well, we've never had an epidemic like this before, that just came out of nowhere, and so all of us were totally susceptible, and we haven't had to deal with that kind of situation. You can say maybe in 1918 we did, but most of us weren't around then. So we've had to invent ways of responding to this challenge from nature. And we've done that, we've done it not perfectly. We've, I think, made mistakes, I think we've misinterpreted data. But we had the absolutely remarkable piece of good fortune that Moderna and BioNTech were working on a new way of vaccination. And they're not great ways of vaccination, they're probably not the best ways, but they're fast, and they could be mobilised quickly.\n\nRobyn Williams: Why aren't they the best?\n\nDavid Baltimore: Well, vaccination is really about proteins. And these are RNA, so they're one step…in the steps of biological processing, they're one step away. And I've actually tried to find out why they work. It's not clear to me why they work. You put it in the arm, like it was any other vaccine, and magically you get the protein and the protein induces antibodies, but it is a bit magical. And so I would love to understand better how it works. I have the strong feeling that a more traditional way of making vaccines, which is clumsier, more expensive, more difficult, slower, may give you a better immunity.\n\nRobyn Williams: You said we've never been as vulnerable because there's a new disease, but the AIDS and the way in which your work inspired a treatment was pretty new as well, wasn't it?\n\nDavid Baltimore: It was, but it is not as widespread. Plenty of people have gotten AIDS, but as a fraction of the population, it's still pretty small. Many, many more people got coronavirus.\n\nRobyn Williams: What do you think about the ways in which the treatment has been applied, and what is the present situation when it comes to looking after AIDS and similar sorts of inflictions?\n\nDavid Baltimore: Why I think we've done an extraordinary job of making drugs that stopped the development of AIDS, that put the virus sort of back in its box. They're not perfect, they don't cure people, but they do stop the spread, and they stop symptoms. And so many, many people are living relatively normal lives, even though they are infected and remain infected.\n\nRobyn Williams: A tremendous achievement. And it's been followed up in what ways? AIDS is more or less understood, but what about other diseases where similar applications could apply?\n\nDavid Baltimore: Well, AIDS is a funny disease because it's so poorly infectious actually. And it really is only spread effectively by very intimate contact, totally different than coronavirus or flu where it comes out of the air and you can breathe it in. So it's fascinating. In fact, I think what we're learning is that each virus is its own challenge, and that we can't meet the challenge of a new virus by analogy with an old virus because it's different enough that we have to rethink the way it's spread, the way you make drugs, susceptibility to drugs, how do you make vaccines, who you give it to, how well the vaccine maintains itself in the body.\n\nRobyn Williams: Bernard Shaw was kind of against vaccination, or something like it. Can you understand the processes by which people are against?\n\nDavid Baltimore: Yes, I can understand it. Because even though I get injections of vaccines somewhat frequently, and I get blood samples taken even more frequently because I'm getting old and they try to keep track of how I'm deteriorating, every time I see a needle approaching my skin, I freeze. Now, I don't stop anybody from doing it because I know what's good for me. So my head actually dominates the weakness of my body. But I can easily understand other people who just say, 'Eyah!!! I'm not gonna do it.'\n\nRobyn Williams: But it's only a tiny pinprick in the shoulder, you can hardly feel it.\n\nDavid Baltimore: It is true that you can hardly feel it. If you've got a good phlebotomist, you don't feel it at all. But it's a violation of the integrity of your body, and you want to minimise those. And it's scary, because you don't know what happens when putting some fluid that was made in a laboratory into your body.\n\nWe live in a society, and we are together in this society, and we have to behave in a way which is consistent with the needs of our society because we draw from our society, we don't live in isolation. And so to argue that you don't want to do something because it makes you queasy or whatever, is not a good argument, you really do have to respond to the needs of the society, the needs of the people around you, the needs of your family.\n\nRobyn Williams: From the vantage of an 85-year-old life, what do you think the United States needs to do to get its act together on many fronts now?\n\nDavid Baltimore: We have to get people to be more comfortable with each other and not so suspicious. I think we've moved into an era of very deep, terrible suspicion of what each other are doing and of what the society is doing. Part of it is because we've been so successful scientifically, that scientifically-oriented part of the population has moved way ahead of a lot of other people in the society who haven't paid as much attention to science or just don't have as much background to understand it. That's a schism that doesn't do well for us. So we need to cross-educate each other, we need to come together to think about what science is doing.\n\nI just spent the early part of this week at a meeting in England, talking about genome editing, which is a classic case of what we can do today that affects our whole society, because we can now modify the gene pool, and that means modifying the inheritance of not only our families, but all future families. So it's a very powerful way of moulding the future nature of human beings. Do we want to do that? Are we smart enough to do that?\n\nRobyn Williams: There could be a gene for Harvard.\n\nDavid Baltimore: I spent my life avoiding Harvard, so you aren't going to get me on that one.\n\nRobyn Williams: That conference, by the way, condemned what the Chinese scientists had done to produce two girls from a genetically modified egg.\n\nDavid Baltimore: When the meeting was held five years ago, we condemned that, I personally condemned it. I was running that meeting in Hong Kong.\n\nRobyn Williams: And it was condemned again now.\n\nDavid Baltimore: And it was condemned again now and it deserves condemnation. The wonderful thing, as I said in opening this meeting in England, is that for five years we haven't had anybody else try. That's pretty amazing, because it's easy. What the Chinese scientists proved was that you can mobilise the resources to make these changes in heritance pretty easily. And so if that's easy to do, why haven't many more people done it? Why haven't there been companies do it in other jurisdictions, not in the United States? And I think it is because we've had such absolute agreement in the condemnation of what was done by Jiankui He five years ago.\n\nRobyn Williams: Yeah, I think the argument is that once you've got it into a living person, and that person passes on a gene, and there may be in the complication of the cell division various different mistakes, and that could be passed on and on and on.\n\nDavid Baltimore: Right.\n\nRobyn Williams: But the students themselves, are they still up to the mark?\n\nDavid Baltimore: Oh yeah, we get extraordinary students here at Caltech. Whether overall the students who are going into higher education are as good as they used to be is an interesting question and I'd say there's plenty of evidence that they're not, that some of the very best students, potentially the best students, are not coming into the universities today, particularly men. So we now have an excess of women over men.\n\nRobyn Williams: Oh, I see, not an excess overall.\n\nDavid Baltimore: No, no, but in the university, women represent 60%, even more, of the student body, whereas it used to be that they represented 10%, 20% presentative of the student body and we were trying hard to get more women. But right now, I think the real problem is that there are a lot of men who are not coming in to the university and not getting the kind of training that prepares them for the world that we're creating.\n\nRobyn Williams: Do you think some of the men, many of the young men have lost the plot? Are they too concerned with their screens and with their games?\n\nDavid Baltimore: That could be. I don't feel I really understand what's going on, but certainly a lot of men are very involved with the games. But you know, a lot of women are too. That doesn't seem to be the distinction. I have a daughter, I have now a granddaughter, both of them spend a lot of time in front of screens."
