        "text": "David Baltimore, President Emeritus and Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at Caltech in Pasadena, California, received his B.A. in Chemistry from Swarthmore College in 1960 and a PhD in 1964 from Rockefeller University. Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1975 in Physiology or Medicine for his research into viral replication that provided the key to understanding the life cycle of retroviruses, Baltimore has profoundly influenced national science policy on such issues as recombinant DNA research and the AIDS epidemic. He is an accomplished researcher, educator, administrator and public advocate for science and engineering and is considered one of the world’s most influential biologists.\n\nBaltimore’s numerous honors include the 1999 National Medal of Science and 2000 Warren Alpert Foundation Prize. He is Director of the Joint Center for Translational Medicine, a collaborative effort joining Caltech and UCLA in a program translating basic science discoveries into clinical realities. He is past-President and Chair of the American Association of the Advancement of Science and has published more than 680 peer-reviewed articles."
