        "text": "Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies (April 27, 1806 – August 22, 1878) was queen consort of Spain from 1829 to 1833 and regent of the Kingdom from 1833 to 1840.\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies was born in Palermo, Sicily the daughter of King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and his second wife, Maria Isabella of Spain. King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies was the son of Ferdinand I of the Two Siclies (who was the third son of King Carlo VII-V of Naples and Sicily by his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony.) By the way, King Carlo VII-V of Naples and Sicily was also King Carlos III of Spain.\n\nCarlos IV of Spain\n\nMaría Isabella of Spain\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies’ mother, Maria Isabella of Spain, was the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. This means her parents were first cousins; her grand fathers (Carlos IV of Spain & King Francesco I of the Two Sicilies) were brothers.\n\nOn May 27, 1829, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, Queen Consort of Spain as the third wife of King Fernando VII of Spain, died. Fernando VII, old and ill, had gone his entire reign without producing a male heir, sparking a succession duel between the Infanta Maria Francisca and the Infante Carlos, and the Infanta Luisa Carlotta and the Infante Francisco de Paula. Fernando VII declared his intention to marry and assembled the Council of Castile, who tasked the King with remarriage.\n\nKing Fernando VII of Spain\n\nFollowing Luisa Carlotta’s suggestion, Fernando VII sent for Maria Christina of the Two Siclies, his niece, who had already given birth to a child and pleased the King’s eyes. The two were wed on December 12, 1829 at the Church of the Atocha.\n\nWith her betrothal and then marriage to Fernando VII, Maria Christina became embroiled in the conflict between the Spanish Liberals and the Carlists. The Liberal faction, and the Spanish people, greatly revered Maria Christina, and made her their champion; when she first arrived in Madrid in 1829, the blue of the cloak she wore became their official color. The Carlist’s were absolutists and highly conservative, and derived their name from the Infante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina who they favored for the throne. Using King Felipe V’s enactment of Salic law, which banned women from taking the throne.\n\nFernando VII and Maria Christina produced two daughters, Isabella in October 1830 and Luisa Fernanda the next year. However, in a secret session of the Cortes in 1789, King Carlos IV reversed the Salic Law of succession with the Pragmatic Sanction. Seeking to secure the succession of an heir of his siring, no matter their gender, Ferdinand VII announced the Pragmatic Sanction in March 1830. The Pragmatic Sanction removed the Salic system established by Felipe V of Spain and returned Spain to a a male preferred primogeniture, similar to the British style of mixed succession that gave succession rights to women. This type of system of succession predated the Bourbon monarchy in Spain.\n\nOn the trip to La Granja, Fernando VII was badly injured by a coach accident. He became ill and increasingly sick over the summer. At one point, Fernando VII was found unconscious at the palace chapel. Seeking council in the event of Fernando VII’s death, Maria Christina approached the Carlist Francisco Calomarde, who advised her that the Spanish people would rally behind Infante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina.\n\nInfante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina (March 29, 1788 – March 10, 1855) was an Infante of Spain and the second surviving son of King Carlos IV of Spain and of his wife, Maria Luisa of Parma and the younger brother of King Fernando VII.\n\nInfante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina\n\nFearing the actions of Infante Carlos de Borbón, and wanting to make him his ally, Maria Christina coerced Fernando VII into signing a decree making her regent if he died, with Infante Carlos de Borbón, as her chief adviser. Infante Carlos de Borbón refused, demanding total governance. Calomarde, with Maria Francisca and Maria Theresa, reissued his warning, coercing the King and Queen into repealing the Pragmatic Sanction.\n\nWhen Fernando VII appeared to have died, the repealing was announced publicly, and Maria Christina was deserted by her courtiers. Fernando VII was discovered to be alive, and news of this also spread. Altogether, Luisa Carlotta, at that time in Andalusia, soon arrived at La Granja and speedily re-enacted the Pragmatic Sanction and orchestrated Calomarde’s dismissal.\n\nWhen Fernando VII actually did die on September 29, 1833, Maria Christina became regent for their daughter, proclaimed Queen Isabella II of Spain. Isabella’s claim to the throne was disputed by Infante Carlos de Borbón who claimed that his brother Ferdinand had unlawfully changed the succession law to permit females to inherit the crown.\n\nInfante Carlos de Borbón, Count of Molina immediately claimed the throne of Spain after the death of his older brother King Fernando VII in 1833. Claiming the style and title, King Carlos V of Spain, first of the Carlist claimants to the throne of Spain, he was a reactionary who stridently opposed liberalism in Spain and the assaults on the Catholic Church. His claim was contested by liberal forces loyal to the dead king’s infant daughter, the new Queen Isabella II. The result was the bloody First Carlist War (1833–1840).\n\nIsabella II as a child. She is depicted wearing the sash of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa.\n\nSome supporters of infante Carlos went so far as to claim that Fernando had actually bequeathed the crown to his brother but that Maria Christina had suppressed that fact. It was further alleged that the Queen had signed her dead husband’s name to a decree recognizing Isabella as heir. Despite considerable support for Carlos from conservative elements in Spain, the Liberal faction supporting Queen María Christina as Regent, successfully retained the throne for her daughter.\n\nI did a post many years ago about the lineage of Carlos II of Spain and how inbreeding resulted in his physical and mental state. Unable to father any children with his two wives, this resulted in the Spanish Habsburg Dynasty being replaced by a branch of the French Bourbon Dynasty, with Philippe, Duke of Anjou, a grandson of King Louis XIV of France (also a great grandson of Felipe IV of Spain) who became the first Spanish king of the House of Bourbon as King Felipe V. Felipe V’s accession provoked the 13-year War of the Spanish Succession, which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns while confirming his accession to the throne of Spain.\n\nAlfonso XII of Spain\n\nFelipe V was King of Spain from November 1, 1700 to his abdication in favour of his son Luis on January 14, 1724, and from his reaccession of the throne upon his son’s death, September 6, 1724 to his own death on July 9, 1746. The sum of his two reigns, 45 years and 21 days, is the longest in modern Spanish history.\n\nAlthough the Spanish Bourbons didn’t intermarry at first, once this branch obtained the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily (later the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) and the Duchy of Parma, along with Spain, they then began inbreeding at an alarming rate.\n\nOne of the members of the Spanish Bourbons who seems to be as inbred as Carlos II was King Alfonso XII of Spain. If you look at Alfonso XII’s official genealogy it’s very startling. Most of us commoners have eight unrelated great-grandparents. Alfonso XII only had four great-grandparents, and even then they were all from the House of Bourbon. Let’s dissect this.\n\nI will begin with Alfonso XII’s first set of four paternal great-grandparents. His first paternal great-grandfather was Carlos IV of Spain, who’s father and mother were King Carlos III of Spain, Naples and Sicily and his wife Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nCarlos IV of Spain\n\nMaria Louisa of Parma\n\nCarlos IV of Spain married his first cousin Maria Luisa of Parma in 1765. Maria Luisa of Parma was the youngest daughter of Felipe of Spain Duke of Parma (also a son of Carlos III of Spain) and his wife Louise Élisabeth of France. This makes Maria Luisa of Parma Alfonso XII’s paternal great-grandmother. Therefore, the father of Carlos IV of Spain and the father of his wife, Marie Louise of Parma, were brothers, Carlos III of Spain, and Felipe of Spain, Duke of Parma, respectively.\n\nCarlos IV and Maria Louisa had three children that were ancestors of Alfonso XII. The only one we’re concerned with at this moment is Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, their youngest son.\n\nAlfonso XII’s next paternal great-grandfather was Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain the daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain. Francesco I was the son of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies who himself was the son of King Carlos III of Spain, Naples and Sicily. Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies was the younger brother of Carlos IV of Spain.\n\nCarlos III was granted the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily after his father, Felipe V conquered the two kingdoms in 1734. His elder half-brother, Fernando VI of Spain, died in 1759 without an heir so Carlos succeeded as King of Spain. Naples and Sicily went to his second son, Infante Ferdinand, and Carlos III’s eldest son became Carlos IV of Spain. On March 8, 1816 Ferdinand merged the thrones of Sicily and Naples into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. This created the Bourbon-Two Siclies branch of the Spanish Bourbons.\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his first cousin María Isabel of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. had many children and the one that concerns us here at this moment is Infanta Louisa Carlotta, Princess of the Two Sicilies.\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies\n\nMaría Isabel of Spain\n\nOn June 12, 1819 in Madrid, Luisa Carlotta married Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, the youngest son of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. This meant Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain was his wife’s maternal uncle. He was ten years older than Luisa Carlotta.\n\nInfante Francisco de Paula of Spain and his wife Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies were the paternal grandparents of King Alfonso XII of Spain. Their son, Infante Francisco de Asís Duke of Cádiz, was the father of King Alfonso XII.\n\nThis completes Alfonso XII’s paternal ancestry. Coming soon is his maternal ancestry.\n\nBelow is a simplified chart of his paternal ancestry."
