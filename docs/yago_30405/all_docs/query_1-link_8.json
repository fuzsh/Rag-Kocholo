        "text": "Pragmatic Sanction of King Ferdinand VII, (March 29, 1830), decree of Ferdinand VII of Spain, which promulgated his predecessor Charles IV’s unpublished decision of 1789 revoking the Salic law of succession, which had denied royal succession to females. The Pragmatic Sanction was intended to permit his unborn child to succeed to the throne, even if it were female.\n\nFerdinand, still childless on the death of his third wife, María Josefa Amalia, in 1829, married María Cristina I of the Two Sicilies in that year and, in so doing, threatened the mounting hopes of his brother Don Carlos regarding the succession. The birth of a daughter, Isabella, in October 1830 greatly complicated the issue. By the ancient law of Castile and Leon women could rule in their own right. This right had, however, been abrogated by an act of 1713 designed to prevent any union of the crowns of Spain and France; and, although Charles IV had restored the former position in 1789, his enactment had never before been published, and its validity was now hotly disputed. Hence the birth of Carlism, the movement by which the supporters of Don Carlos and his heirs were known, which was for more than half a century to be a disrupting factor in the history of Spain. When, on Sept. 29, 1833, Ferdinand died, his daughter was proclaimed queen as Isabella II. The First Carlist War (1833–39) broke out almost immediately."
