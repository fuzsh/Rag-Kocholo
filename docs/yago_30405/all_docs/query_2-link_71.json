        "text": "Daughter of Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, died unmarried.\n\nWho might Maria Elisabeth (1743-1808) marry?\n\nIf you can prevent her catching, smallpox which terribly scarred her face, making her considered unfit for marriage, she may not became the abbess of the Convent for Noble Ladies in Innsbruck from 1780, so you will have to make her stay away from the convent.\n\nShe became known for her sharp tongue and would eventually became greatly overweight.\n\nIf it was not for the scars, she would have been married to King Louis XV of France\n\nNot bloody likely. Mimi was the only one of Maria Theresia's daughter who was allowed to marry a man of her choosing, solely because a) she was her mother's favorite, and b) she exploited the funk MT was in after François of Lorraine died.\n\nThat said, Maria Elisabeth was considered for Louis XV, but her smallpox scars put paid to that idea. Mimi was supposed to marry the duke of Chablais as part of her father's plan to patch Austro-Savoyard relations. Provided François dies on schedule, and Louis rejects her as OTL, Elisabeth might end up as duchess of Chablais.\n\nNot bloody likely.
