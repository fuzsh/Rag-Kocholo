He was also the grandson of the French King XIV, grew up at the court of Versailles and from there was taken to Madrid where he would be named Spanish monarch at a very young age. He suffered from bipolar disorder, was hypochondriac and very manic, he also suffered an attack of hysteria when he went horseback riding because he believed that the sun affected him, because of this he wandered at night and sometimes called all his servants to keep him company. He also had other hobbies such as always wearing the same shirt because he thought he was going to be poisoned through his clothes, he also did not let anyone cut his toenails and fingernails because he believed that his ailments would increase, because of this his toenails grew so much that he could not walk. Another of his quirks was that he thought he was a frog and that he had no legs or arms. On 2 November 1701, he married his cousin Maria Gabriela of Savoy, daughter of King Umberto II of Italy. With her he had his first four sons named Louis I who was born on 25 August 1707 and died on 31 August 1724, Infante Philip of Spain who was born on 2 July 1709 and died on 29 July 1709, Infante Philip Pedro Gabriel of Spain who was born on 7 June 1712\n\nPhilip V\n\nand died on 28 December 1719 and finally Ferdinand VI of Spain who was born on September 23, 1713 and died on August 10, 1759. After Maria Gabriela died he married his second wife, Isabella of Farnese in 1714, with whom he had seven children including Charles III of Spain, Infante Francisco, Mariana Victoria of Bourbon, Philip I of Parma, Maria Teresa Antonia Rafaela, Luis Antonio Jaime and Maria Antonia Fernanda. On the other hand, if we talk about his period in the reign we know that he inherited the Spanish throne when Charles II died without descendants, becoming the first Bourbon in the dynasty of Spain, in 1701 he was sworn in as King of Spain before the Castilian courts and tried to carry out a series of reforms to modernize the country, These included the creation of a modern army and navy, as well as the reorganization of the financial and tax system, but it faced many difficulties and not all of its reforms were carried out. In January 1724 he unexpectedly ceded the throne to his son Luis, but after his death in August of the same year, he reigned again until his death on 9 July 1746 at the Buen Retiro Palace.\n\nFerdinand VI, also known as ''the Prudent'' or ''the Just'', son of Maria Luisa Gabriela of Savoy and Philip V of Spain, was born on September 23, 1713 in the Royal Alcázar of Madrid, and was baptized without great solemnity in the Franciscan church of San Gil on December 4. As for his reign he had before him a succession of two elder brothers, Louis and Philip Peter, and another elder brother than the one who had died shortly after birth, and Philip Peter also died, so Ferdinand was second in succession after Louis, who was six years older than him. Ferdinand argued that there was no room for the abdication of a king and had a hard time convincing the king himself to reign again, but on September 7, 1724, a week after the death of Louis I, Ferdinand's father, Philip V, once again held the crown of the monarchy of Spain\n\nFerdinand VI\n\nand Ferdinand was appointed as the new Prince of Asturias and sworn in on November 25 by the courts of Castile. On the other hand, Ferdinand married in 1729 Bárbara de Braganza, daughter of the King of Portugal, in the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista in Badajoz. They had a series of restrictions, among them that only ambassadors from France and Portugal could visit them, another of them was that they could not eat in public or go for a walk or go to any temple or convent. But Ferdinand during the last years of his reign his mental illness and physical deterioration was described as swollen, clumsy, with swollen legs and a lost gaze and it was getting worse until his death on August 10, 1759 in Villaviciosa de Odón, Madrid.\n\nCharles III of Spain was born on January 20, 1716 in the Real Alcázar of Madrid at four in the morning and grew up with his caregiver María Antonia de Salcedo. In addition, on August 25, 1716, the day of the feast of San Luis, he was baptized in the church of the Monastery of San Jerónimo el Real in Madrid along with his older brothers Felipe and Fernando. His godparents were Mariana de Neuburgo and his great-uncle Francisco Farnese. In 1729 he moved to Seville with his father and later in 1738 he married Maria Amalia of Saxony who was 14 years old. She was a German princess from a wealthy family and her marriage had a political interest\n\nCharles III\n\nThey were married by proxy at the Dresden Palace in Saxony on 9 May and the wedding took place on 9 June in Naples. On the other hand, Charles inherited from his mother the duchies of Parma and Plasencia in 1731 and also a few years later when his father reconquered the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, in the course of the War of the Polish Succession, Charles became king of those territories. During the reign of Naples and Sicily he tried to reform and modernize the kingdom, unifying it, winning the affection of the citizens together with his wife. In Spain, he also carried out several reforms, including reforming studios and schools. He finally died on 14 December 1788 in Madrid.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th exactly in 1700 Spain was rule by Fhilip V, he was a man that had serious problems because he was bipolar and had euphoric episodes ,followed by depression periods, also he thought that was like a frog and hadn’t legs and arms but he ruled likewise.
