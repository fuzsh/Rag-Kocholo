        "text": "The King of Spain is the head of state, a symbol of his unity and perseverance, who is responsible for deciding and moderating the proper functioning of the institutions and at the same time being the highest representative of the nation. In addition, he performs the functions expressly conferred upon him by the constitution and laws. He is the supreme commander of the armed forces and the holder of the highest patronage over the royal academies. The Constitution of 1978 deals with the institution of the crown, the person of the king and his functions in the II. Title, in Articles 56 to 65. The current King of Spain is Felipe de Borbón y Grecia as Felipe VI.\n\nThe King of Spain is the second sovereign master of the insignia of the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Royal Order of Charles III, the Royal Order of Elizabeth the Catholic, and the Order of the Noble Ladies of Queen Maria Luisa. He may also use the title of Catholic Majesty and, moreover, is an honorary and hereditary canonist of the Cathedral Church of Leon and the Basilica of Santa Maria Mayor in Rome.\n\nThe Constitution recognizes the King as absolutely inviolable and relieves him of all responsibility on his part, be it political or legal. At the same time, however, the Constitution provides for the nullity of all its acts which are not within its competence and are the responsibility of the Prime Minister, ministers, parliamentarian or parliamentarians.\n\nUnification of Spain\n\nWhen we speak of the King of Spain, we are talking about the period since the so-called reunification of Spain. Before the unification itself, there were several separate kingdoms and counties in what is now Spain. The unified Spanish state was established in 1469, when Ferdinand Aragon, heir to the throne of Aragon, planned to marry Isabel I of Castile, the heir to the Castilian throne. In 1474, Isabel of Castile became Queen of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon (as Ferdinand V of Castile) her royal husband. In 1479 Ferdinand Aragon became King of Aragon, creating a personal union of Castile and Aragon.\n\nIn 1504 Izabela of Castile died and the throne in Castile was joined by her daughter Jane of Castile (Madia), which de de jure Castile and Aragon again separated. Ferdinand of Aragon was her regent, however, because after the death of her husband Philip of Habsburg in 1506 went crazy. Initially, Ferdinand of Aragon was temporarily expelled by nobles and replaced by Jane’s husband, Philip of Habsburg. However, he died in 1506. In 1512 Ferdinand of Aragon conquered the Kingdom of Navarre and annexed it to Aragon.\n\nIn 1516, the throne of Aragon was inherited by the grandson of Ferdinand of Aragon, Charles of Habsburg, who was also from 1519 the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. He was the son of Jane of Castile, but at the same time for his mother’s madness “guardian and co-ruler”, but not the only ruler of Castile. In 1555, Jane of Castile died, making Charles of Habsburg the only ruler of Castile.\n\nIn 1580, a personal union was established between Portugal, Aragon and Castile, creating Spain in the sense of restoring the Roman “Hispania” covering the entire Iberian Peninsula. When Portugal separated in 1640, the name Spain for the rest of the peninsula remained unchanged. It was not until the Bourbon’s accession to the throne in 1700 that the centralized state of Spain was created. Until then, there had always been only several kingdoms with a common ruler. So until then, the Spanish kings had in their title – King of Aragon, Castile and Valencia, the Count of Barcelona. The Spaniards as a nation were even mentioned in the Constitution of 1812.\n\nThus, the first King of Spain is considered Charles I of Habsburg.\n\nOverview of kings and queens.\n\nAustrian dynasty\n\n23.1.1516 – 16.1.1556 Carlos I.
