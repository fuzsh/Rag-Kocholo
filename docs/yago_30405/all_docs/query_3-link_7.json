        "text": "So what if to smooth things over even more between the Habsburgs & William the rich (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Duke_of_Jülich-Cleves-Berg), someone insists that Amalia of Cleves (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalia_of_Cleves) weds Charles V.\n\nI know Charles had a deep love for his deceased Isabella and as such didn't wed again following her death in 1539, and William didn't particularly like the Habsburgs but for the sake of argument it comes up somehow either\n\nCharles (I'll marry your sister, the territories can be considered her dowry, if we have kids they'll inherit the low countries, you won't attack me because I married to your sister)\n\nOR​\n\nWilliam (I'll know what your up to because my sister is your wife, increase my influence as I have a sister for an Empress and my other sister has some influence in England, making me more of an international player; it also acknowledges to a degree my family's claims to those territories, I'm cool with the Emperor now)\n\nOR​\n\nMary of Hungary (These 2 guys will be the end of me, I need someone to help mediate relations between the 2, ah! William has a sister ,perfect, sure she a little older kids aren't necessary, afterall our dear sister Isabella married Charles at 23 and our dear sister Eleanor is Queen of France and she married that darn Francis at 32, why not follow those examples no?)\n\nAmalia would've been 26 around 1543 when the treaty was negotiated. I believe Mary of Hungary oversaw it's particulars, but I could be mistaken as the page on the Italian War 1542-1546 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_War_of_1542–46#Initial_moves_and_the_Treaty_of_Venlo) implies Charles was campaigning in the region, the marriage could take place in the late winter that year before Charles moved to Speyer to negotiate with the German princes. (Also does anyone know if William's marriage to Maria of Austria, Ferdinand I's (later HRE) daughter was arranged at this time? Can't find particulars on the treaty to that level)\n\nSo guys, I'll leave it to you to speculate... Do they have kids, a son, a daughter maybe more? Will Charles give them the low countries? Relations with England? The succession in the Empire (who becomes Emperor, the Burgundian branch or the Austria branch?) With no Low countries to tempt parliament, will they accede to a marriage between Mary I & Philip of Spain? Who does Philip marry instead (sorry I've gotten a bit excited).\n\nSidenote:\n\nI believe this has bubbled up before (2014 & 2015) but this particular match hasn't been well explored, it's usually more Charles and Anna instead.\n\nOk so, here's how I see a marriage between Charles and Amalia going down and the effects it may have:\n\nAmalia of Cleves is, probably after the birth of their first child, going to find herself being pressured to take up a position of power in Burgundy, particularly when Charles finally decides that her son is 100% going to inherit the Netherlands. Most likely this'll be around 1545 or so, with Mary of Austria, who has been stuck in that role since 1531 finally able to leave once Amalia is settled in that role. She'll probably either return to a position of power in Hungary once Ferdinand realises she's free and available to help him, or perhaps she'll be pulled into a position as Regent in Naples, but regardless, Amalia and her son are going to be sent off to Brussels.\n\nI'm banking on a wedding night baby, so little Charles is born in 1544, so let's say the new couple are married by proxy around November, and meet in person shortly after.\n\nConsidering Charles fathers 10+ children in his lifetime and Amalia comes from a somewhat fertile family, they'll probably have a second kid. I'm going to cut it off at one more, however, for a few reasons:\n\nCharles is not in love with this wife, and thus will be fine to let her rule from Brussels with minimal contact year to year.\n\nCharles is getting older and likely isn't as fertile as he once was. Once the gout truly starts setting in towards the late 1540's/early 1550's I think we can rule out 3rd/4th/5th children.\n\nAmalia is going to be highly stressed following her taking up a position as Regent of Burgundy, particularly once Mary of Austria is able to leave. That isn't conductive to a lot of children.\n\nFor those reasons, let's say three pregnancies, with two live children and one miscarriage/stillborn. I'm also going ahead and making the second child a daughter named Anna, after her aunt in England. Amalia and Anne were decently close in age and Anna is a perfectly respectable name at the time, so it's a likely choice, and I prefer it over the equally likely Isabella, if just because I wouldn't want to name my child after my spouse's previous spouse.\n\nOnce it starts really kicking in that Charles is dying, I can see him abdicating to his infant son with Amalia as Regent in Burgundy, similar to how he abdicated the Imperial throne and Spain OTL. This'll be a mere formality rather than a huge surprise.\n\nAfter Charles' death that's when things get interesting for Amalia. She's got real power in Europe, and the first thing I can see her doing is consolidating her son's position of power in any way possible. A high profile betrothal would work well, but the main thing will be to begin introducing her son into power and teaching him how to command respect and lead.\n\nFor the marriages of Charles and Anna, I'm going to say that I can see Charles marrying Claude of France, but considering that OTL his brother married her sister and that's likely to happen, I could also see Renata of Lorraine being a real candidate, as would his cousin Marie Eleanore of Cleves or any Italian Princess interested in the Hapsburgs. Anna might be offered to William V, Duke of Bavaria if Renata isn't available, but she would also be a candidate for Edward VI of England until his death, and potentially would make a more suitable Queen of France for Charles IX, if just because she'd be more likel to bring some Burgundese lands back into French hands with that marriage. It'd depend on the political situation and how it changed over time, however.\n\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor (b.1500: d.1558) m. Isabella, Infanta of Portugal (b.1503: d.1539) (a), Amalia, Princess of Cleves (b.1517: d.1586) (b)\n\n1a) Philip II, King of Spain (b.1527)\n\n2a) Maria, Archduchess of Austria (b.1528)\n\n3a) Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria (b.1529: d.1530)\n\n4a) Stillborn Son (c.1534)\n\n5a) Joanna, Archduchess of Austria (b.1535: d.1573)\n\n6a) John, Archduke of Austria (b.1537: d.1538)\n\n7a) Stillborn Son (c.1539)\n\n8b) Charles III, Lord of the Netherlands \"Duke of Burgundy\" (b.1544)\n\n9b) Anna, Archduchess of Austria (b.1547)\n\n10b) Stillborn Son (c.1549)​\n\nWell Charles V will not have nothing to decide about giving or not the Low Countries to his son from Amalia, as that lands would have been surely destined to the children of Charles and Amalia in the wedding contract (like they were destined to the children of Philip II and Mary of England in OTL) so after their father’s the second wedding neither Philip or Mary and Maximilian (and their heirs) will have any claim on that lands until the extinction of the descendants of Charles&Amalia...\n\nThe pragmatic sanction of 1549 ATL also will settle the succession in Netherlands on Charles, his heirs, his eventual brothers and theirs heirs, Anna and her heirs, any eventual younger daughter and her heirs, then Philip and his line and after that the descendants of his daughters Mary and Joanna followed by that of his brother Ferdinand (and that of his sisters Eleanor, Isabella, Mary and Catherine)\n\nI doubt William had that good of a hand to have that included in the contract especially given OTL, but it would be a good pot sweetener though. I can definitely see the ATL 1549 pragmatic sanction going\n\nCharles, his heirs, his brothers (& their heirs), Philip of Spain (& his heirs), Ferdinand of Austria (& his heirs) and then heir to nearest female heir (& her heirs) of the last ruler of the region (in this case Anna), as in complete extinction of the male lines before going back to the female line."
