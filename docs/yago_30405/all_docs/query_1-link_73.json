        "text": "HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ILLUSTRIUOS ORDER OF ST. JANUARIUS\n\n� Guy Stair Sainty\n\nThe founder of the Order of Saint Januarius, Charles VII, King of the Two Sicilies (from 1734-1759, died 1788), was the first reigning Monarch to reside in this kingdom since 1502. Of unusual intelligence and benevolent disposition, Charles embarked on a series of reforms, to the considerable benefit of the people of his new dominions, who no longer endured the rule of a Viceroy representing a distant Sovereign. Since the kingdoms were surrounded on three sides by the sea and were bordered on the fourth by the Papal States, considered by a loyal Catholic Monarch to be inviolable, there was no room for further expansion. Hence, the king was able to concentrate his energies on beautifying his capital, paying off the National Debt (accomplished in a particularly short time) and reducing taxation.\n\nCharles's Habsburg predecessors had used the resources of the Two Sicilies to subsidize their armies. The young King, in contrast, put all his energies into firmly establishing his authority, building the Palace of Caserta (the largest in Europe after Versailles), founding the Capodimonte porcelain factory (with the assistance of specialists from Meissen brought to Naples by his Queen) and sponsoring the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii. The latter made Naples, already the largest European city after Paris, with a population of between four and five hundred thousand, the most popular tourist attraction in Europe and brought considerable numbers of free-spending foreign visitors. The Royal Palace at Portici, constructed at the foot of Mount Vesuvius and directly above Herculaneum, contained the first public archaeological museum and the Royal Family were frequent visitors to the excavations. The construction of the San Carlo theater gave Naples one of the finest opera houses in Europe, and the establishment of the Reale Albergo dei Poveri, the first government-sponsored home for the underprivileged.\n\nCharles, as a young Monarch, was considerably influenced by his father Philip V, King of Spain. Philip had proved a highly capable ruler, not only bringing peace to his Kingdom but in ultimately re-establishing Spanish influence in Italy. The interchange between the two Kingdoms remained a constant feature of international relations and insured the passage of the three Family Pacts of the eighteenth century between Spain, France and the Two Sicilies in 1733, 1743 and 1761. It is hardly surprising that the young King Charles VII of the Two Sicilies looked to his father for advice in administering the affairs of his Kingdom. Spanish forces had placed him on the Neapolitan Throne and he was surrounded by Spanish advisers, or men whose dislike of the Habsburg Viceroys administering their state on behalf of an absentee Sovereign, had led them to support the Spanish invasion and the accession of Charles as their King.\n\nItalian writers, however, have ignored the influence of King Philip and Charles's extensive correspondence with his father, and the names of those knights of Saint Januarius whose nominations were made at the instigation of King Philip. The late Don Achille Di Lorenzo, author of a 1963 partial Roll of the Order, not only omitted these names but in a subsequent publication stated that he could not consider them legal since, in his view, a foreign sovereign could not intervene in the affairs of another Kingdom. The reality is, however, that the correspondence between Charles and Philip survives in the Spanish archives and demonstrates the contrary. We learn from this that various nominations to the Order were made at King Philip's instigation and they are amply documented. Furthermore, King Philip himself invested many of these knights with their collars personally, at his court in Madrid, acting with the consent of his son, King Charles.\n\nCharles first proposed the idea of founding a new Order of Chivalry to his father soon after the successful invasion of Naples in 1735. In a letter from Philip s Minister, the Count of Santisteban, of 15 June 1735, the new King was advised to wait until after his formal investiture with the Crown of the two Kingdoms. The following month Santisteban informed King Philip (6 July 1735) that King Charles intended to go ahead with the foundation of this new Order; appropriately, it was to be named for the patron Saint of his capital, the Bishop-Martyr Januarius. [1]. The older Monarch approved the idea but recommended that his son send him the projected constitution and statutes before publication. On 30 August 1735 Santisteban wrote to King Philip again, informing him that King Charles had decided it should have sixty knights and suggesting the names of the first nineteen members. His father proposed that he should wait for a suitable occasion, in a reply of 29 October, but that occasion did not arise for another three years.\n\nCharles' plans were further advanced by mid-1737 and on 21 June 1737 King Philip wrote to him once again expressing approval of the idea. Charles had already suggested the formation of a class of Magnates of the Kingdom, paralleling the Spanish Grandeeship, an idea that was supported by King Philip (letter of 23 December 1736), who later suggested the names of candidates. [2] This project was ultimately abandoned because of disagreements among the Two Sicilies nobility, and the problems this project seemed to foment encouraged Charles to return to the concept of founding a new Order. In mid-1738 his marriage to Maria Amalia Walburga, eldest surviving daughter of Friedrich August II, Elector of Saxony (August III, King of Poland), proved to be the opportunity he needed. [3]\n\nLittle is known of Saint Januarius beyond the fact that he was Bishop of Benevento and was martyred at Pozzuoli with six companions, circa 305. As a finger was cut off during the martyrdom a phial of blood was obtained, which is preserved in the Cathedral of Naples. This relic is exposed to the public on various occasions during the year, when, after an interval of time it liquefies; if it fails to do so then it is considered a portent of ill-fortune for the city. This phenomenon, which has been recorded for the past five hundred years, has been carefully observed and no satisfactory rational explanation has been produced to discount the miraculous nature of the liquefaction. Saint Januarius, who is often invoked against eruptions of Vesuvius, is portrayed on the badge of the Order holding a book with two phials of blood and the motto \"In Sanguine Foedus\".\n\nThe comparatively late foundation date of this institution makes it the last great dynastic Order to be constituted as a Chivalric fraternity rather than a National Merit Order. The Scottish Order of the Thistle had been created from a mythical past by James II in 1687 and its Sovereignty assumed by his successors, while the Russian Emperor had founded his Order of Saint Andrew just forty years earlier. [4] In 1701 the King of Prussia had founded the Order of the Black Eagle to mark his own elevation to Kingly rank. With the decision to announce the formation of the Order to coincide with his marriage, a firm date was set for July 1738. King Charles's Ambassador, the Count of Santisteban informed King Philip that the first list of members included some forty-six names, of whom thirty nine had already been approved by the Spanish King in earlier correspondence. [5]\n\nThe Order's Statutes and foundation both date to 3 July 1738 and the first promotions to the Order were made three days later. These Statutes were published in Italian and Spanish and limited membership of the Order to sixty Roman Catholic noblemen, although non-Catholics have been admitted by successive Grand Masters in exceptional cases and the total complement of the Order has exceeded sixty on several occasions. As an Order of the Collar and the highest Order of the Kingdom, it was intended to equal in rank that of the Golden Fleece, awarded by his father in Spain, and that of the Holy Spirit, given by his cousin in France. Indeed it was the frequent practice for the Princes of each branch of the House to receive all three Orders.\n\nAs they had discussed in their correspondence, King Charles reserved for his father, Philip V, King of Spain, the right to appoint up to six Knights, emphasizing the unity of the House of Bourbon. Benedict XIV confirmed the foundation of the Order by a Papal Bull of 30 May 1741, and second Bull of 27 July of the same year; the Papal authority given to its foundation served to protect it from the purported abolition by the government of Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy in 1860.\n\nIn a letter of 26 July 1738, King Philip wrote to his son nominating for election six noblemen, the Duke of Mirandola, the Duke of Medinaceli, the Duke of Gandia, the Count of Montijio, the Marquess de San Juan de Piedras Albas, and Marquess Scotti. In a further letter of 28 July he asked his son to accord the Collar of Saint Januarius to the Duke of Bournonville, the Prince of Masserano, the Marquess of Bedmar and the Duke of Atrisco. Then, in a separate communication on the same day he informed his son that he had accorded the Spanish Knights of the Order the title of Excellency since, although most of the Spanish Knights were already so entitled as Grandees of the1st Class, the Marquess of San Juan de Piedras Alta was not hitherto an Excellency . [6]\n\nOn the first promotion of the Order, the King himself dispensed all his nominees from the need to submit any formal proofs of nobility (although all of them would have been able to make such proofs, had it been required), and the statutes provided that such dispensations could be given in the future. [7] It has been alleged that an informal distinction (in that such differentiation was not prescribed in the Statutes and there was no difference in the badge or regalia) existed between Knights of Justice who had to prove four quarterings, and Knights of Grace, who were only required to prove two paternal quarters, but these differences were not consistently adhered to and the award of the Order in any case conferred hereditary nobility. [8] The title of \"Royal\" was accorded the Order in its first statutes but the style of \"Illustrious\" (Insigne) was never formally attributed to it, appearing for the first time in the Gaceta de Madrid of October 6th 1749 and thenceforth accompanying the designation Royal in official acts with increasing regularity.\n\nThese privileges reciprocated those extended to knights of the Golden Fleece in the Two Sicilies and, just as King Charles was delegated by his father to invest any Neapolitan or Sicilian Knights with the Collar of the Spanish Order, so Charles commissioned his father to invest the Spanish Knights of Saint Januarius on his behalf (letter from King Charles 20 August 1738). When the King was unavailable, investiture could be made by some other person so authorized as happened with the Viceroy of Mexico the Duke of La Conquista (invested by a Bishop, not identified, in 1739). A further nomination of a Spanish Knight by Philip followed a request for the Order from the Marquess of Bay, on the grounds of his services in Italy (24 August 1738) but this nomination was held over by King Charles for a later occasion (letter from His Sicilian Majesty, 21 October 1738). [9]\n\nThe special status of this Order as a quasi-religious military institution was emphasized by the division of the Knights, in a Royal Decree of September 21st 1738, into novice and professed Knights; although this distinction was later dispensed with there were differences in the form of reception and the costumes of these two categories. The professed Knights were required to make certain promises in addition to proving their lineage, including a profession of the Catholic faith, a promise of loyalty to the Grand Master, an undertaking to keep the peace between their confreres and a promise to attend Mass on certain days. There were also special provisions regarding the reception and investiture of ecclesiastical members laid out in a supplement to the Statutes. [10] [5]\n\nOther Spanish nominees proposed by King Philip were Don Sebastian de la Quadra (1738), [11] the Duke of Solferino (1739), [12] while the Marques de Salas di Rivera, [13] don Jos� Miranda [14] and don Jos� de Diesbach y Cartellas (all Spaniards) were nominated directly by King Charles. [15] Spanish records disclose further solicitations to King Philip for his support for nominations to Saint Januarius, but these were not necessarily successful, some candidates making several requests without ever being nominated. The records include requests from the following: Brigadier don Pedro Gasca (Colonel of the Farnese Regiment, requested the Collar from Gaeta where he was stationed 1 November 1738), [16] the Marquess of Santa Cruz de Mudela (20 October and 2 December 1738), [17] the Count of Puertollano (1739), [18] the Marquess of Valdecarzana (1739 and 1746), [19] the Duke of Veragua and Berwick (1739), [20] the Count of Mahony (1740), [2-1] the Marquess of Guadalc�zar (1740 and 1745), [2-2] the Count of Jauche (asking for the place of the deceased Marques de Bay, 30 September 1741), [2-3] the Count of Valhermoso (1746), [2-4] Don Fadrique de Bernuy, Marquess of Benameji, and the Marshal of Alcal� del Valle (no date). [2-5] These solicitations demonstrate the ongoing practice of the Spanish King nominating members, or being perceived by Spanish nobles as the person to whom requests for nomination should be addressed, even into the reign of Ferdinand VI.\n\nKing Charles VII inherited the Spanish Crown as King Charles III on August 10th 1759. By article II of the Treaty of Naples of October 3rd of that year, he was required to establish the Infante Don Ferdinand, his second son (third-born since the exclusion of the eldest who was severely retarded) as King of the Two Sicilies. The new Sovereign received the Two Sicilies Crown, as Ferdinand IV of Naples and III of Sicily, by the Pragmatic Decree of October 6, 1759. This ordained that the succession should pass by male primogeniture among the descendants of King Ferdinand, and failing them of his younger brothers, unless the Crown of Spain was united with the Sovereignty of the Two Sicilies, in which case the latter had to be ceded to a son, grandson or great-grandson of the prince who so combined both successions. [2-6] In the event of the male heirs of King Charles III becoming extinct, the Two Sicilies Crown would pass to the nearest female heiress of the last King.\n\nThe first Almanach of the Kingdom following Charles' departure named Ferdinand as the Grand Master of Saint Januarius but the dowager Queen of Spain (Elisabeth Farnese) immediately wrote to Tanucci pointing out that this was an error. This letter was followed by one from the King, dated September 30th 1760, in which he wrote to his former Minister that \"....concerning the Order of Saint Januarius, I did not believe it opportune to renounce this Order in favor of my son the King when I left and I have reserved it for me as Founder, and such renunciation will be made when he has attained his majority\". [2-7]\n\nThe Marquess of Villarreal de Alava has also located a document in the same archives, demonstrating that King Charles continued to make appointments after leaving Naples. The following letter, dated December 17th 1765 and directed to Marchese Tanucci, stated: \"Among the honors that the King Our Lord will deign to concede on the occasion of the marriage of the Prince our Lord, will figure the Cordons of the Royal Order of Saint Januarius to the Cardinal Archbishop of Seville, to the Prince of Butera, to the Duke of Bournonville, Grandee of Spain, Lieutenant- General of the Royal Armies, Captain of the Flemish Company of the Bodyguard; to the Prince of Belmonte Pignatelli, to the Prince of Campofranco, to the Count of Fuenclara, Grandee of Spain, Lieutenant-General of the Army, Maggiordomo Maggiore of the Infante Don Luis; to the Marquess of Squillace, [and] to the Duke of Granada de Ega, Grandee of Spain, Lieutenant-General of the Royal Armies. For the presentation of the Collars of the Knights that are living in Naples, H.M. delegates the King, His beloved Son, and for those who are living in Sicily, the King delegates the Viceroy of Sicily...\". [2-8]\n\nIn a letter from Marchese Tanucci to King Charles III, dated August 12th 1766, the Prime Minister of the Two Sicilies wrote to his former master to request that he make some disposition concerning the Grand Magistery of the Order of Saint Januarius. He suggested that if the King of Spain wished to retain the Grand Magistery, as founder of the Order, during his lifetime, then he should concede the title of Grand Master Governor of the Order to his son, the King of the Two Sicilies, since the majority of knights were Neapolitans and Sicilians. [2-9] Until recently no document was thought to have survived showing when the King actually made this resignation, causing some historians speculatively to date it to 1764; however, it seems that Tanucci's 1765 letter decided King Charles to resign the Grand Magistery, which he did on December 9th 1766. [2-10] King Ferdinand, who was listed in the Royal Calendar of 1766 as a Knight of the Order with his father as Grand Master, is not listed as the latter until 1768 and did not appoint any Knights until May 13th 1768 when he made several admissions to celebrate his marriage to the Archduchess Maria-Carolina.\n\nThe first promotion of the Order, made on July 6th 1738, including those added by the King of Spain, totaled fifty-five in number; to these should be added the names of five other Spanish Knights admitted by King Charles between October 20th 1738 and January 25th 1739, completing the membership to the sixty Knights specified in the Statutes. The most comprehensive list of members of the Order since its foundation was published in Naples in 1963; [2-11] but this contained several errors and omissions which were discovered by the Marquess of Villarreal de Alava, who has shown that there were thirty Italians, nineteen Spanish, two French, two Belgians, one Pole and one German. [2-12]\n\nKing Francis I wearing the Collars of the Golden Fleece & Saint Januarius\n\nThe fall of the Neapolitan Monarchy to the French invader in 1798 led to the Order being awarded more often to non-Italians and foreign Sovereigns. The first of the latter to receive the Order was Czar Alexander I, while two Russian noblemen, Admiral Feodor Ouchakov and Count Vassili Vassilievitch Levachov, were exempted from the limitation to Roman Catholics. During the period of the Napoleonic wars the Order was given to more foreigners than at any time in its history, including Landgraf and Prince Ludwig of Hesse-Phillipsthal (nominated in 1802), Prince Regent George (later King George IV) of Great Britain, King Carlo Felice of Sardinia, Prince Clement von Metternich-Winneburg and Prince Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, Duke of Dino, all nominated in 1816 and a number of British officers, the most notable of whom was Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington (nominated in 1816). [2-13]\n\nOriginally the Order had four principal officers whose duties were to administer its affairs, a Chancellor, Master of Ceremonies, Treasurer and Secretary, all of whom wore a slightly different breast star to the ordinary Knights. These duties were limited by a reform of August 17th 1827, to certain ceremonial roles at the installation of Knights (no successors were appointed to the then holders of these offices), [2-14] and the administration was confided to the Secretary, who, since 1860 has always been a Knight of the Order. he first officers of the Order were the Most Rev. Don Mondillo Orsini, Archbishop of Capua and nephew of Pope Benedict XIII (as Chancellor) who was also appointed a Knight in the first promotion, Don Giovanni Brancaccio, another Minister (as Treasurer) who could not make the full noble proofs and was never appointed a Knight and Don Gaetano Brancone (as Secretary), who was likewise never made a Knight; all three were nominated to their posts on the same day as the publication of the Statutes (July 3rd 1738). Marchese Bernardo Tanucci, the Secretary of State, was appointed Master of Ceremonies two months later on September 13th and was admitted as a Knight in 1764, In practice, as the principal Secretary of State, Tanucci controlled the Order and, after King Charles went to Spain, the affairs of the Kingdom, until King Ferdinand attained his majority.\n\nDetail of the Collar of Saint Januarius from the Portrait of Francis I\n\nThe Order was rarely at its full complement of sixty Knights, although in the last two years of the Monarchy there were sixty-five appointments, extending its membership considerably, of whom twenty-seven were non-Neapolitans, mainly foreign diplomats. 1861, the year in which the King was forced into permanent exile, saw a further extension of its membership as thirty-four new Knights were admitted, most of whom were Neapolitan and Sicilian noblemen who had remained loyal to the King. Many of the other Knights had immediately accepted office under the Savoy Kings and may be presumed to have forfeited membership by breaking their oath of loyalty to the Grand Master. Certain Sovereigns continued to maintain diplomatic relations with the exiled Court, including the Emperor of Austria, the Kings of Bavaria, Wurtemberg and Hanover, the Queen of Spain, the Czar of Russia, and the Pope, all of whose Ambassadors received the Order between 1862 and 1870. From 1870 until the death of King Francis II, the Order was only rarely awarded, to a few former subjects who had remained loyal, the elder sons of the Count of Caserta, the former reigning Duke of Parma and his brother the Count of Bardi (both nominated in 1883), the reigning Prince of Monaco and Ferdinand, Prince and later Czar of the Bulgarians (nominated in 1891).\n\nThe succession of the Count of Caserta marked a substantial increase in importance of the Constantinian Order, while the Order of Saint Januarius continued to be given only rarely. Between the death of King Francis on December 27th 1894 and the death of the Count of Caserta on May 26th 1934, only thirty-one appointments were made, of whom the first four (and a further two) were Cardinals and including those of his sons who had not been nominated by Francis II, other than Prince Don Gabriele (who was appointed by Prince Don Ferdinand-Pius). The next Grand Master, Ferdinand-Pius, who died in 1960, only made two appointments to the Order, Prince Don Gabriele and Don Filippo Lancellotti, Prince of Lauro (who died in 1970). [2-15] Ferdinando-Pio's next brother, Prince Don Carlo, had been appointed a knight of Saint Januarius by his father the Count of Caserta, but Prince Don Carlo's only surviving son, the Infante Don Alfonso had never received the Order. Nonetheless, with the death of his uncle Ferdinando-Pio, the Infante Don Alfonso succeeded to the Headship of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies and Grand Magistery of Saint Januarius by virtue of the laws of succession of the Kingdom and the Pragmatic Decree of Charles III of October 6th, 1759. [2-16]\n\nSince 1960 the Order has been awarded sparingly and total membership (including Royal Princes) has not exceeded eighty, most of the knights being members of Royal Houses, senior officers of the Constantinian Order or Italian grandees. The Infante Don Carlos, Duke of Calabria and his late father, both followed the example of the nineteenth century Sovereigns of the Two Sicilies in awarding the Order not only to the heads of other Royal Houses (or reigning Sovereigns), but also to their closest advisers, several of whom also hold high office in the Constantinian Order.

The Marquess of Villarreal de Alava, Op. cit. 1964, pp.472-473 and 554-562, has shown conclusively that the transfer was made formally on December 9th 1766: \"My dear and much beloved son./ When the All Powerful summoned me to the Throne of Spain following the death of King Ferdinand VI, my very dear and much beloved Brother, conforming to the spirit of the Treaties of this century I established, by a solemn act and law promulgated on the 6 October 1759, the succession to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the person of Your Majesty ......... Finding that Your Majesty has almost attained Your majority, I believe that it is necessary that I should explain something which I have had in mind and declare that the Sovereignty and the Grand Magistery of the Order of Saint Januarius pertains to Your Majesty and Your successors as Kings of the Two Sicilies, fully and absolutely, as it pertained to me as Founder.// And in order that immediately Your Majesty is placed in full possession of Your authority that You shall be Head, Sovereign and Grand Master of the aforesaid Order, I ordain this in the form of a most solemn and express declaration by this my decree signed by My hand and witnessed by the undersigned Councilor and First Secretary of State and Dispatch. May Our Lord protect Y.M. my very dear and much beloved son, for as many years as He may grant you. San Lorenzo 9 december 1766. // I THE KING // Geronimo de Grimaldi.\"\n\n[2-11] This corrected many of the mistakes and omissions in the Roll published at Naples in 1885 by Francesco Bonazzi.\n\n[2-12] See Villarreal de Alava, Op.cit., pp.489-553, in which the first members of the Order, listed in the Roll only by their titles of nobility, are each correctly identified. Three Royal Princes were included, the Infantes Don Filippo (Duke of Parma) and Don Luis, and the King's brother-in-law the Electoral Prince Friedrich Christian of Saxony, Prince of Poland, and two Cardinals, Lodovico Belluga and Troiano Acquaviva d'Aragona. Recent research by the present author has indicated that the Rolls published in Naples also omitted the names of some 19th century members of the Order - for example, the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor on 14 December 1830 granted permission to the Marquis de Dreux-Brez�, formerly hereditary Grand Master of Cermonies of the French Court, who had been nominated on 27 July 1830, to accept the Order, although his name is not listed in any of the published Rolls. The family names of many of the first Knights can be found on the recent Rolls of the Order of Saint Januarius and the Constantinian Order, including Moncada, Caracciolo, Colonna, de C�rdoba, and di Sangro. Over the next sixty years, other families of which members are or have been recent supporters of the present Grand Master include the names Gonzaga, Fitzjames Stuart, Osorio de Moscoso, Alliata, and Pignatelli.\n\n[2-13]The first British knight was John Joseph (sometimes called James) O'Mahony, 2nd Count of Mahony, a Lieutenant-General in the Neapolitan Army and son of a leading Jacobite, Daniel O'Mahony, created a Count by Philip V of Spain (9 Nov 1706), by Lady Ann Clifford, daughter of the Hon. Thomas Clifford and Charlotte, suo jure 3rd Countess of Newburgh. He was nominated on June 15th 1747 and is the ancestor of the present Earl of Newburgh. The next British knights were Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Martin (nominated in 1810), Lt-Gen Thomas (Mahon), 2nd Baron Hartland (nominated in 1816), Lt-Gen Sir John Du Platt (nominated in 1816), Lt-Gen Sir William Phillips (nominated in 1816), Lt-Gen Sir John Murray, 8th Baronet (nominated in 1817), Rear-Admiral Sir David Milne (nominated in 1818), General John (Fane), Lord Burghersh, later 11th Earl of Westmoreland, GCB, GCH, Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty (nominated in 1825), General James Ochoncar (Forbes), 17th Lord Forbes (nominated in 1829), the Rt Hon (and Hon.)
