        "text": "Fraser’s political philosophy creates a “thick,” nuanced understanding of justice as embodying a range of normative principles meant to inform political, economic and cultural practices. She considers what constitutes just social relations and values, who ought to be involved in such discussions, and how to deliberate to achieve justice within a globalizing world. Here Fraser is particularly concerned with the ways that various feminist theories and movements, have helped—and sometimes hindered—efforts to think about and organize movements of justice by and for women. In short, Fortunes of Feminism represents an ambitious re-theorizing of political philosophy from the standpoint of feminist concerns and struggles over the last four decades, offering up a universal political philosophy of justice informed by and informing women’s emancipation in the midst of a global crisis of world capitalism. The book is not without lacunae, however, and I conclude with two suggestions towards a more truly egalitarian—and ecological—feminist political philosophy, largely compatible with Fraser’s own framework.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, I visited Nancy Fraser at her home to conduct an interview on the various social, economic, and political struggles of our day. From the fight against neoliberalism to the movements challenging the far-right, Fraser analyzes our contemporary situation, remaining firmly rooted in the Marxist tradition. Central to Fraser&#39;s theoretical work is the concept of social reproduction, the sphere of capitalism associated with women. Her help in theorizing and organizing a &quot;Feminism for the 99\\u0025,&quot; opposed to what Fraser calls &quot;progressive neoliberalism,&quot; provides activists with both theoretical and practical tools for challenging the gender asymmetry inherent in the capitalist system. The following is an introduction to the thinking of Nancy Fraser, outlining her critiques of the capitalist system, her theoretical insights into social reproduction, and her articulation of the urgent need for a Feminism for the 99\\u0025.\n\nis one of the most important intellectuals of our time. Philosopher, critical theorist of society, feminist theorist and activist: with her influential work from the 1980s until today Fraser has offered significant contributions in the fields of social and political theory, feminist theory, contemporary philosophy, and lately in the debates around the relation between climate change and capitalism. On the occasion of Fraser's 75 th birthday in 2022, and on that of the 10 th and 20 th anniversaries of the publication of two of her books in 2023-respectively, Fortunes of Feminism (2013) and Redistribution or Recognition? (2003, co-authored with Axel Honneth)-, the monographic section of the present issue of \"Scenari\" aims to celebrate these anniversaries with selected contributions dedicated to the investigation of her work and thought. After the publication of our Call for Papers on the website of \"Scenari\", several scholars with different backgrounds and working in different disciplines generously submitted their contributions dealing with various aspects of Fraser's philosophical-political work and the main fields of her research, in order to assess their relevance and impact today.\n\nFraser is one of the most important American philosophers and one of the leading figures of contemporary critical theory. From the 1980s to the present, Fraser has published on political philosophy and social theory, reflected upon feminism, justice, and capitalism, and has participated in public debates on current issues. The interview aims at retracing the main themes of her thought, underlining the persisting link which joins her understanding of political philosophy with social critique and public engagement. The interview also emphasizes the developments of her thought, starting from her formation in the American New Left, the encounter with feminism and the neo-Marxist cultural critique of capitalism, and the discussion of Habermas’s thought. Also discussed is Fraser’s complex feministic theory and her post-Westphalian and three-dimensional model of global justice. Another crucial topic is the recent elaboration of an enlarged view of capitalism, based on a combination of Karl...\n\nNancy Fraser is one of the most important intellectuals of our time.
