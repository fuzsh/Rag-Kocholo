For many years the mere menti;- ■ of the month of January has brought to mind the Publish- ing House, and has been connected with the urge to give to the support of that interest of the Church. We have called this \"Offering\" THE PUBLICA- TION DAY OFFERING. But in a larger sence we should not use this term, but one of wider conotation and meaning and ad- judge it \"The Literature Offering,\" for it is more than an offering to a publishing plant — it is an offer- ing to an important interest of the Brethren Church. Did 1 say \"an important interest?\" That phrase is not quite narrow enough. It is a MOST important interest of the Brethren Church. I almost said \"THE MOST IMPORTANT INTEREST.\" But possibly that is a little too wide an application, and we will simply say, \"One of the MOST important.\" But truly the word \"important\" is the key to our thought at this time, for a vital, important link in the work of the church would be seriously and great- ly weakened if there would be any \"let dowTi\" in the support that is given annually throughout the Broth- erhood, to the Brethren Publishing Company. There are two vital things I want to call to your attention. 1. The need of additional equipment in the printing plant proper, and, 2. The necessity of liquid- ating the present indebtedness on the building, NOW, while money is plentiful. It is important that this be done in order that money thus given out for interest be applied to the regular work of the church in thus giving opportunity to use such money in the literature \"spread\" that the Gospel might be more thoroughly administered. For after all the purpose of the Brethren Publishing Company is not to make money for a corporation, but to print all the litera- ture possible to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Equipment Just a few words about this. There is a constant need in any machinery operated plant for repairs, re- placements, added equipment to bring it up to oper- ating capacity, and new type faces, in a printing plant, to present the kind of a paper that will meet the demands of the reading public. This we desire to do, but funds prevent many such desired improve- ments. Your offerings help with this part of- the u ^^^^- Ashland, Ohio Debt Liquidation At the present time the Publishing Building is the only interest of the church that is seeking to cancel a building debt. Just recently you will remember the Benevolence Board removed the indebtedness from the Brethren's Home at Flora, Indiana. It will not be too long until a Chapel will be in building on the College Campus which will entail a call to the Brotherhood for needed funds to complete it. The good women of the W. M. S. will see to that. But now the primary interest of the church to be envolved is the Publishing Company. Let us get this debt out of the way before we are called upon to assume an- other. Would that we could make it clear that the Publishing Building is the property of The Brethren Church, the National Conference, with its delegates being the stockholders of the same. Therefore it is YOUR PROPERTY and you are a part owiier. It belongs to no particular congregation and to no par- ticular individual — it belongs to the church. There- fore we ask that you help support what is properly partly yours. Is that asking too much? F. C. V. A WORD OF APPRECIATION Too often we fail to give recognition to those who are most important in the conduct of the affairs of an organization and take them as a matter of course. However no institution can endure which does not have the loyal support of its employees. They are rather more than a mere entity, they become at once either an asset or a liability. Well the Brethren Publishing Company can con- sider its force in the printing plant a great asset, for we have a very loyal group of men who really have the interest of the work at heart. In our foreman, Mr. Don Burns, with the company for the past fif- teen years, we have one who is not only willing, but able to make all things \"go well.\" The editor wishes to express his great appreciation to him and to our very efficient pressman, Don Emmons, and to our linotype operator, C. L. Plank, one of the best, for the close association, helpful efficiency and good comradeship in these few words that space permits. A fine force of fine fellows. F. C. V. It is imperative that those who seek a vision of ,Gpd shall fi-equent the House of God, where He is revealed and worshipped. — Roy L. Smith. The Christian hHome The Brethren Evangelist Rev. Arthur R. Baer From the primitive cave to the millionaire's pal- ace, home is the place where a family lives. Yet there is a tendency to think of home in too materialistic terms. There are certain essential materials without which it would be impossible to build a house, but they fall far short of making a home. I love Edgar Guest's poem, \"Heap 0' Living\" but I feel that even he takes too much into consideration the material construction. In the old home, father ruled sternly and abso- lutely; today, in many homes that would mean re- bellion. Yet, there is a definite need of proper dis- cipline in the home with fuller understanding and sympathy. In too many homes parents have yielded, and in many so called Christian homes the children are not being reared in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Without such Christian nurture and with no Christian worship the home is at best merely neutral in its religious influence. In the home as else- where, neutrality is denial, it is disloyalty. The establishment of a Christian home is one thing, the maintenance is another. It requires con- stant vigilance and additional help apart from itself or it will not survive. A Christian home is not merely a place of mutual understanding, where sins have been mutually forgiven and selfish desires dispelled. The Christian home is a God possessed and a God possessing institution. It is not a home garnished but empty, it is a home tenanted by the Holy Spirit. Disallusionments are bound to come, even where two decide that their home is to be Christian. After the daily grind begins it is likely that both will find that neither of them are angelic, but mostly human. It is well to accept at the outset that these tantaliz- ing imperfections do not preclude the possibility of maintaining a Christian home, and it will help if they are able to draw upon an abundant supply of Christian graces. One of the most serious dangers is that the home may be allowed to become merely nominally Chris- tian. Therefore it is highly important that prayer- ful consideration be given to the recreation, the lead- ing matter, the social contacts as well as the personal habits. The teaching of a Christian home is still effective, when its lessons are taught persistently and cour- ageously, and practiced faithfully each day as a mat- ter of conscious habit founded on convictions. Under such conditions there is nothing to equal its power. There are other influences functioning in society, but these do little but echo the standards of the home. It is impoi'tant then that our homes be Christian. Christian homes are now our greatest need. Sometime it may happen, that homes will redis- cover Jesus and retuni to Him as the great leader. — Cameron, W. Va. .Ai^ Some Contributions Which Ashland College Has Made to the Cause ol\" Christianity and the Brethren Church Dr. Martin L. Shively Ashland College During the sixty-five years of the existence of this institution of learning, the men and women who have served as instructors within its halls, have done their utmost to lead in the achievement of the goals for which the college was called into being. And one of the outstanding goals has from the first been the development of Christian character in the students who sought instruction in its class rooms. Every stu- dent has been required to take a course in the study of the Bible, and none have left its halls who did not,, by both precept and example have set before him: the aims and ideals which were so wonderfully ex- emplified in both the teaching and example of our^ Lord. The daily services conducted in the college chapel, have left lasting impressions in the minds ofi both students and teachers. Everything reasonably January 1, 1944 possible has always been done to fix in mind and heart, the nature and revelation of God in the per- son of our Lord. Only eternity can reveal the extent of the lasting impressions made upon both mind and soul of those who lived even for a short time, under the influences exerted here. The Brethren Annual for 1921 listed 71 names of men serving in the ministry of the Brethren Church, who had received their training in the halls of Ashland College, and the Annual of 1942 added 29 new names to this list, so that I am sure that I am not exagerating when I say that not less than 150 men and women have passed through its halls to go out into the world with their chief objective to preaching of the Word. And in addition to these, there have been many hundreds more who have be- come instructors in the public schools, each of whom has at least in some measure passed on to the pupils under their charge, the teaching and ideals so con- stantly emphasized here. And in addition to these, men and women have entered other fields of labor. and I am sure that I cannot be charged with wistful thinking when I say that while a few may have failed to make a decided impress for good in com- munities in which they made their homes, com- munities are at least a little better for their living in them. They have become teachers in the Sunday Schools, and leaders in many fields of activity, and in practically every instance the ideals of Ashland College, find expression in them. And Ashland Col- lege continues to serve as it has done during all the years of its existence. Its ideals and objectives have not been reduced. Young men and women are still being prepared for definitely religious service in a world which sorely needs them, and above the speak- ers desk in the chapel, there is the beautiful large picture of Christ standing at the door, patiently knocking, waiting to be admitted to the human heart. Both the picture as well as the addi'esses daily de- livered there, cannot but make a lasting contribu- tion to the lives of all who see and hear. Ashland College still serves. . — Ashland, Ohio. The Church s Responsibility to Youth By Bishop William Pearce If vital definitions are heeded, tlie chuixh is a body of peo- ple called out from the world, and they come according to the terms of the call. Said Glendower, \"I can call spirits from the vasty deep.\" \"Why, so can I,\" said Hotspur, \"or so can any man. But will they come when you do call for them?\" In the Bible view the church is a company of people separated from the worldly order by all the emphasis of the narrow- way and the strait gate at the head of the way. It ranges all the way from the child Timothy to the mother Eunice and the grandmother Lois. All ranks and conditions may be comprehended in that glorious institution, the church of the living God, upon Scriptural terms of life. Mutual respect, and helpfulness and love must prevail in the beautiful entanglement of age distinctions, or confusion will ensue. That gentle man, gentle as a nurse cherishing her children, the marvelous apostles of the Gentiles, led the way, and the wise and the righteous will follow in all the ages. That does, not mean a compromise in doctrine, or practice, but a loving regard for the body of which Christ is the head. Especially should the church cherish its younger members. Orthodoxy of doctrine is of little worth if not accompanied by the orthodoxy of love. Our young people are well worth cherishing, and the Young People's Missionary Society has a peculiar claim upon the church at large. It is the ward of God, as its life and vigor show, and there- fore the ward of the church. Its members are precious pearls in the setting of the love feast; habitations of God through the transforming Holy Spirit; eager participants in mission- ary enterprises; the delight of the pastor in proportion to their influence and their numbers; the pledge of the church'.'; prosperous future; the example of the world of what the grace of God can do for the lost; the fishers of men com- mended by our Lord; the devoted to Christ, while the masses of the young people are living for themselves, the worst form of idolatry. As among the advanced in life, so among the young peo- ple, there will be found the listless and the unspiritual, the camp followers and the merely social, whose life is a flicker, or a fading, and who are keen on programs and dull in prayer. The Epistles in the New Testament and the messages to the churches in Asia reveal that in the old long since, defections threatened and factions arose, so there is always danger to people of all ages. One great command with one great obedience will safe- guard the church in all its stages of life: \"Be filled with the Spirit.\"— The Free Methodist. §n§n§ ESTIMATES -'^ Man calls sin an accident; God calls it an abomi- nation. ■: Man calls sin a blunder ; God calls it blindness.

The Brethren Evangelist Distinctive Brethren Doctrines and Practices By Rev. Dyoll Belote THE LORD'S SUPPER (Following the declaration of purpose in last month's \"Foreword,\" we shall in this article take up the second of the separate acts of the Communion service. Our subject for this article will, therefore, be that of \"The Lord's Supper.\") The Lord's Supper — Its Institution The second of the distinct acts in the Communion service is that of the Lord's Supper, or Love Feast, or the Agape. These are three different terms referring to the same thing the full evening meal which Jesus ate with the disciples on the night of His betrayal, and which was preceded by the feet-washing and followed by the eucharist. And we must not forget that these symbols were used in the exact order named, by the apostolic church in perpetuation of the Lord's Me- morial service. There is a very simple proof that this supper was intended by the Lord to be a part of the completed service, in the fact that it is set exactly between Feet-washing and the Eucharist in its institution. There is a solemn asservation that Jesus was not acting unwittingly or thoughtlessly, for there are three facts set forth concerning His position and attitude in the first three verses of John 13. It says that Jesus knew (a) that His hour was come to depart out of this world, and that (b) He was come from God and went to God, and lastly that all authority was given unto Him in Heaven and on earth. It was, there- fore in the solemn consciousness of these facts that He pro- ceeded to establish these and all the ordinances which He set in the church for the blessing of His disciples in all ages. By precept — \"If I, your lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet\" — and by example — \"I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you.\" Then having taken his garments (which He had laid aside to exemplify the manner of the feet-washing) He sat down again to the meal (from which He had risen to give the visual understanding of the cleansing service), and taught His followers, and hastened Judas on his way to the completion of his devilish plot against our Lord. And when He had taught and fellowshipped with them all (even Judas to whom He gave a sop). He instituted the Eucharist and commanded its observance. It does not appeal to good judgment to believe that Christ would make a revelation of His departure and authority, follow that by the instituting of a sacred ordinance, then break the thread of sacred acts and engage in an ordinary meal, and then later take up the thread of sacred things and institute another ordinance. The supper came between the two ordinances — both of which He emphatically commanded, it is vitally connected with them, and it must also have been commanded. The Love-feast Kept by the Apostles Jesus gave no authority to the disciples to originate ordi- nances, and there is no evidence of their having done so. The apostles simply carried out the things which their Lord Iiad taught them. So when we find the disciples mentioning the love-feast as a regular and undisputed institution of the Christian church, we accept that as evidence that it must have had the authority of the Lord. No amount of argument can make a bit of bread and a sip of wine into a \"feast.\" Paul speaks of this service in his first letter to the Corin- thian church, 5:7, and says, \"For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ: wherefore let us keep the feast, ...\" Paul, patently, was not referring to the Eucharist alone, but to the entire love-feast, and he speaks of it as if it was well known as one of the services instituted by the Lord. And since the apostle regarded the love-feast as an institution ordained by the Lord to be perpetuated and guarded against misrepresentation, we believe we should do the same. The Lord's Supper — A Word-study The Greek word translated \"Supper\" has in the meaning of the word in the original, the meaning of a full evening meal. Various Greek Lexicons all give this meaning to the term. And the same word when it is used elsewhere in the Gospel is universally translated \"feast\" or \"supper.\" The passages in Matt. 23:6, Luke 14:12, and John 12:2, where the word \"deipnos\" appears in the original have the word trans- lated in each case as \"feast.\" Another simple statement will also help to put the \"sup- per\" exactly where Brethren claim it should be put — and left. That the \"supper\" is not to be identified with the bread and wine is easily seen in the declaration that \"as they were yet eating Jesus took bread and blessed it, etc.\" They had been eating while He was discoursing to them, and then — after the supper — He instituted the service of the bread and the wine, the Eucharist. Beside this in the Scriptures the bread and wine are never called the Lord's supper. 1 Cor. 10:16. The Love-feast — Its Symbolism. That there is a symbolism in the love-feast is generally admitted by thoughtful folks. If we admit that the supper which Christ ate with His disciples that night was an ordi- nary meal, and carried to the apostles nothing more than the suggestion of the satisfaction of physical hunger, then we must treat it as an ordinary meal and leave it at that. But if Jesus first, and the apostles after Him, taught that January 1, 1944 there is a religious significance in the feast, then we have commendable warrant for believing that the feast was meant to be continued, that the truths back of it may be taught and perpetuated. A. The love-feast is a memorial of Christ's love. The infer- ence, in this case, is undeniable, since in the introduction to the entire service in John 13:1 explicit reference is made to this love of Christ's: \"Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.\" And later as Jesus was teaching His followers during the supper He gave spe- cial commandment for the perpetuation of this type of love. \"A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you\" (John 13:34). The feasts at which this commandment is exemplified are a means of teach- ing and urging its continuation. \"The love-feast, with this new name expressing this new type of love, which the world first saw in Jesus, is a standing memorial of Jesus' love.\" The world of OUR day needs this memorial, that it may be frequently reminded of God's love as manifested in Christ Jesus. B. The love-feast is also a symbol of the love which should characterize Christ's followers. It was while instituting this feast that the Lord said, \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one toward another\" (John 13:35). Just as the feast commemorates the love of Jesus for His disciples, so also it must urge upon those dis- ciples the necessity and desirability of a like mutual love one for another. It will be remembered that it was at the end of this same feast that Christ prayed to the Father, having this thought of mutual love for each other and said, \"That the love wherewith thou lovest me may be in them, and I in them.\" (John 17:26). And so by example, by commandment and prayer Jesus gave to this new supper such a significance that for all time it has ceased to be rated as common, and has become a bond of love in the Christian brotherhood and a source of spiritual blessing to all who partake, seeking fellowship and blessing. — Uniontown, Pa. -t-s^ ■V^.->- Imagination and the Changing World A Radio Address By Dr. L. L. Garber The Prophetic Poets, by means of the skilful and artistic use of the creative imagination, foreshadow, prefigure, and create the emerging and better world. \"Imagination was given us that we might reshape an ugly world into the likeness of our dreams.\" — Russell Gordon Smith. Eminent psychologists and thinkers everywhere concur with the saying of one of the greatest military leaders of all time: \"Imagination rules the world.\" Our national history is an outstanding illustration of the fact. We have achieved greatly, are achieving greatly, will achieve greatly because we employ the creative imagination in unusual ways. The Pilgrim Fathers imaged a better world beyond the seas, braved the perils and hardships of the stormy Atlantic, and realized their fondest hopes and desires — the home and haven prefigured in their dreams. The Revolutionary Fathers imaged a country of wider freedom, of larger opportunity, of juster relations between man and man. Hence they estab- lished principles, fostered ideals, set precedents, and organ- ized a government that has changed the whole course of hu- man history. \"Man is master of his fate\" only insofar as he creates in his imagination the better and the new so vividly, so cun- ningly, so compellingly that he creates the desire, the cour- age, the hardihood to strive, to suffer, to die for this new and better way. Our sons and kindred are striving, fighting, dying on every frontier of the world because we as a people have imaged a safer, a better, a nobler world that can and, therefore, must be created. In such an hour it is fitting to examine some of the work of the great Prophet-Poet who has depicted most definitely and suggestively the spiritual elements and material develop- ment of the emerging democratic warless world. But before we take up in detail the prophetic pictures of the immortal Tennyson, let us hear another's statement of how image-creators build and destroy nations and civiliza- tions : \"We are the music (image) makers And we are the dreamers of dreams. Wandering by lone sea-breakers, And sitting by desolate streams; World-losers and world-forsakers, On whom the pale moon gleams; Yet we are the movers and shakers Of the world — forever — it seems. With wonderful deathless ditties We build up the world's great cities; And out of a fabulous story We fashion an empire's glory: One man with a dream of pleasure. Shall go forth and conquer a crown; And three with a new song's measure Can trample a kingdom down. We in the ages lying, In the buried past of the earth. Build Nineveh with our singing. And Babel itself in our mirth, And o'erthrew them with prophesying To the old of the new world's worth; For each age is a dream that is dying, Or one that is coming to birth. A breath of our inspiration Is the life of each generation; A wondrous thing of our dreaming Unearthly, impossible, seeming — The soldier, the king, and the peasant Are working together in one. Till our dream shall become their present, And their work in the world be done.\" The prophet both foresees and creates. In such fashion, Tennyson has helped create the present world, and is help- ing create the new and better emerging world. He saw that this is a progressive, developing world when he wrote these couplets: \"Yet I doubt not through the ages One increasing purpose runs. And the thoughts of men are widened With the process of the suns.\" The Brethren Evangelist \"Men, my brothers, men the workers, Ever reaping something new: That which they have done but promise Of the things that they shall do.\" Further, Tennyson believed that a finer, lovelier Christian spirit would measurably motivate human conduct, and wrote this matchless metaphor to symbolize the process: \"Love took up the harp of life And smote on all the chords with might; Smote the chord of Self that trembling, Past in music out of sight.\" The growing embodiment of this lovely prophetic hope is now in impressive unfolding consummation. Never before has any group of nations espoused and endeavored to carry for- ward so just and Christ-like a program as the allied nations are now furthering. When, before, in the spirit of \"I am my brother's keeper,\" did a group of nations propose to expel 1 from human affairs, all brutal tyrants, all blood-stained ex- ploiters, all ruthless selfish conquerors? When was Good Will and studied altruism so widespread as today ? When, before, did a group of nations, so powerful, so intelligent, so wealthy, plan so scientific and long-term effort to help the under-privileged, educate the inept, and succor the starving by developing and utilizing all the resources of the \"good earth\" and the best intelligence of our common humanity to abolish want, fear, and needless suffering from every race, color, and class ? As a prophet, Tennyson saw in vision how invention, dis- covery and cooperative organization would transform the world. He wrote: \"So I dipt into the future. Far as human eye could see. Saw the vision of the world And all the wonders that would be.\" He saw the airplane commerce, with its mighty transform- ing influence, almost a century before it began. In 1842 he wrote this: \"Saw the heavens fill with commerce. Argosies of magic sails. Pilots of the purple twilight, Dropping down with costly bales.\" This commerce, which has been rapidly developing for some years, will undergo a vast civilization-transforming expan- sion in the immediate future, carrying the useful products of every nation to every other, abolishing want, and promoting human friendships, racial good will, and all forms of culture. Further, he saw, heard, and vividly describes noisy, crash- ing, terrifying aerial battles, such as are today taking place in many parts of the world. He further predicted that such vastly destructive world conflicts would eventuate in the nations of the world, taking the most fateful and significant step forward Time has ever witnessed; an international co- operative step, culminating in the abolition of war through the establishment of a Parliament of Man, a United States of the World. He wrote: \"Then the war-drum throbbed no longer. And the battle-flags were furled. In the Parliament of Man, The Federation of the World.\" Still further, Tennyson suggests how this Federation of the World will maintain a durable peace and a warless world. The method is so simple that you will not understand its power and feasibility until you have done some analytic comparative thinking in reference to it. Understand Tenny- son's famous couplet: \"There the common sense of most Shall hold a fretful realm in awe (Under control) And the kindly earth shall slumber, Lapt in universal law.\" The prophecy of Tennyson implies no fanciful dream or un- tried experiment. The method is as old as civilization itself. Thousands of peaceful cities and prosperous states, past and present, prove the efficiency of the method. All logic tends to prove that a method that has worked successfully in thousands of cities, nations and empires, will succeed when applied to the organization of the world federation. \"The Common Sense of Most,\" a democratic majority of the citi- zens, holds the unwilling and criminal minded in subjection and awe by its legal regulations, its courts, and its police ■ force, in every organized unit, great or small. Our own great commonwealth of states. The Soviet Union, the great British Commonwealth of nations, with thirteen millions of square miles of territory and five hundred million of inhabitants, all maintain peace within their borders in the same way through organized common sense. What these great aggregations of people of all races and religions have done and are doing for themselves, the nations of the world can do for all by a world organization with a world legislative body whose laws and regulations are enforced by an inter- national police force. The organization of the Federation of Man, the Parliament of Man, will be the greatest political achievement in human history. It will be the crowning master step in the establish- Time permits only a suggestion of the immense collateral benefits that will flow from such an organization of the world for peace. When one catches a vision of the intellectual, material, artistic, moral, economic, and humanitarian possi- bilities of such organization, he is filled with a boundless enthusiasm for it. That it will be, in a large way, the answer to the appeals and prayers of millions of suffering, hungering, enslaved, military-burdened, tax-ridden, war-bedeviled, fear-benight- mared men and women, and of countless homeless orphans, fleeing refugees, and lonely wanderers on the waste places of the earth, is an equally appealing prospect to all who would \"deal justly\" and \"love mercy.\" Every citizen should catch the spirit of Tennyson's prophetic visions. A United States of the World meets the challenge of the hour. The mighty changes on the earth, recent and pending, make such an organization easy, essential, desirable, imperative. Ours is a shrunken world. Space and time have in most respects been immensely curtailed or annihilated. Europe is in our backyard and Asia's teeming millions just around the corner. We chum, argue, fellowship with all the world. No nation can be safe, prosperous, and happy, unless all are fed, sheltered, educated, and civilized. The vastly expanded facilities for the creation and dis- tribution of human necessities and creature comforts makes all this possible under the Parliament of Man, a United States of the World, under which — \"The common Sense of most Shall hold the fretful realms in awe, And the kindly earth shall slumber, Lapt in universal law.\" \"Oh beautiful the poet's dream That sees beyond the years. Where alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed by human tears.\" — Ashland, Ohio. Januaiy 1, 1944 !S'62365 EDITORIAL COMMENT \"Growing Pains' of the World Dr. C. F. Toder By \"We are living, we are dwelling in a grand and awful time; In an age on ages telling to be living is sublime.\" THE SEERS in every age see something of the relation of the past and present to the future, and are therefore thrilled by the current of progress which they discern. The earthquake which is now shaking down the social and political structure of the world, has brought fear to those who lack faith in God or knowledge of His ways of working; but to the wise who understand (Dan. 12:10) it has brought joyful expectation, for they see in these judgments the ending of the dispensation and the nearness of the Kingdom of God. THE KINGDOM once before was near and was offered to the Jews, but because of the unbelief of their rulers it was taken from them and given to believers among all peo- ples. Now the end of the \"times of the Gentiles\" is at hand and the awakening of Israel is proceeding. Among the many signs of the coming kingdom, the rise of \"kingdom against kingdom\" may be the most conspicuous, but it is not the most fundamental. When Jesus wished to illustrate the growth of the king- dom itself, He likens it unto seeds so\\^^l in the ground which springeth up, man knoweth not how, but sees first the blade, and then the stock, and then the head of grain. Carrying the illustration into human experience, we see first the mystery of life and note the \"growing pains\" in the passing from childhood to youth, and from youth to age. Parents who do not understand sometimes punish their children for seem- ing laziness or misconduct for which they are not to blame. All periods of transition are marked by painful readjust- ments. THE BIOLOGICAL LAWS of individual growth are also the laws of social growth. Sociology is a comparatively new science and its teachers have not yet fully understood that society, world society, is itself an organism in the process of growth, and therefore has its crises or transitions with their corresponding \"growing pains.\" Let us consider the analogy. With the background of the creation of electrons, atoms and molecules or elements, life begins with a single cell. The cooperation of like cells produces tissues; the co- operation of modified tissues produces organs; the coopera- tion of organs forms systems, and the cooperation of the systems defines the organisms. In society the cell corre- sponds to the individual; tissues correspond to the different trades and professions; organs correspond to the unions of related interests; systems correspond to the larger groups called departments of government, and the cooperation of the whole defines the organism, whether it be the family, the tribe, the nation, the empire or the world government. COOPERATION AND LIBERTY. Now when the offspring of any Adam and Eve become numerous and agree to coop- erate for mutual protection or benefit, that cooperation is obtained by the surrender of certain individual J,i)>.erties which were enjoyed before. The members who rebel against the Ashlari loss of these \"personal liberties\" become the criminals who are justly exiled or obliged to obey the agreements necessary to the cooperation of the group. When a number of tribes agree together to form a nation, or a number of nations are formed into an empire, in each case the larger cooperation is obtained at the cost of minor liberties which were enjoyed by the separate groups. The United States of America can only exist because the original thirteen separate colonies and the succeeding territories, in order to join the union, were willing to limit their libertie.-; to matters of purely local interest and leave the control of national interests to the federal government. In the same way individual Christians, when isolated, have no super- vision, but when members of a congregation have congre- gational supervision; and when congregations form a denom- ination they agree to limit their congregational liberty to purely congregational matters and submit the denominational matters to the central authority of the denomination. Those who rebel against such authority must choose between iso- lation or submission to the laws of cooperation. IT IS THE TRANSITION from these lesser forms of co- operation to the larger forms that cause the \"growing pains.\" The loss of liberty hurts all those who are not willing to sacrifice some personal desires for the common good. In this phenomena we find the cause of the quarrels among children, divorces among parents, divisions in churches, and wars among nations. It is the greatest danger in the world today. Slaves to vice are unwilling to give up their liquor and their cigarettes for the good of their families and the world. Traf- fickers in the business which causes vice are unwilling to give up their profits for the common good. Pigmy politicians oppose any social program which may cost them votes or position. Ambitious rulers will rule or ruin. Ambitious nations parade their idea of sovereignty to the loss of a greater and better sovereignty. THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is always opposed by the dogs in the manger who are too ignorant to appreciate the kingdom and too selfish to sacrifice their personal desires for the better things of the kingdom. Such are the reaction- aries who with a loud profession of patriotism or piety, good will or wisdom, seek to conceal their selfish motives and en- list in their support the good people they can deceive. They are the hypocrites whom Jesus denounced. They brought de- struction upon their people in His first coming and have brought the world to the horrors of the present crisis. And they vAW do their best to prevent a cooperative post-war world, but they will not succeed for long. They will not succeed because Almighty God is still King of His creation. It is He who \"hath determined the appointed times of the nations and the bounds of their habitation.\" Acts 17:26. He has ordained the cycles of moments and days and the cycles of times and of ages. When the 430 years, de- creed for the sojourn in Egypt, were ended, that \"selfsame day His people moved out.\" Exodus 12:41. When the time came for the Messiah to be \"cut off\" (Dan. 9:26) that day and hour He died upon the cross. And then \"the full end, and that determined,\" of the wrath of God is poured out upon Israel because of persistent unbelief, then their despairing cry will be heard and the Lord will come. Then the times of the Gentiles will end and the kingdom of Heaven will be established. Thus it is wTitten and thus it will come to pass. WHAT, THEN, SHOULD WE DO ? First of all we should do our utmost to give the good news fo the kingdom to all nations as a witness unto them. (Matt. 24:14). At the same time we should let our light shine wherever we may be. Amid the voices of the unconverted announcing their plan for the new world, we must announce the program of our coming King. Read it all in Isaiah 61 and its confirmation in 10 The Brethren Evangelist Luke 4:18, and Acts 15-14-18, and Romans 11:25-32, and Matt. 5 — 7, and similar passages. It is expected that the criminal classes will jeer at this program, for the carnal mind does not understand spiritual things. The first point in the program is the preparation of the people, a regenerate people. The dry bones must come to life. The repentance of Israel precedes restoration. The re- pentance of the Gentiles is their only salvation. The danger from powerful but pagan nations and from the criminal classes of all nations is too great to be ignored. The world of good will must protect itself against them. Isolation is im- possible. Force restrains but does not cure. Invention has made the world a neighborhood, but only a new spirit can make it a brotherhood, and that new spirit is from above and not below. It is the work of the Gospel and not of law alone, much less of arms alone. The \"rod of iron\" is necessary; law is necessary; moral education in the schools and educational forces, like the Reader's Digest, are necessary, but above all, true Christian- ity is necessary. The Lord may rule over His kingdom through \"princes\" (Ezek. 45:8, 9) but His spiritual presence is and shall be real. All Utopian pagan plans have failed, but coop- erative federations like the British Empire, the United States. and the Pan-American Union have had success because based in part on Christian principles. The coming kingdom will be neither Jewish nor Gentile, but Christian. The \"growing pains,\" of the awakening world consciousness are like the \"spring fever\" which we all know. In spite of them the sum- mer will come. The trees are budding. Luke 21:29-31. Cordoba, Argentina, South America. CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR TOPIC W. St. CIdir Benshoff; Topic Editor \"ToDici copyrighted bj thp Intematioaai Society of Chrlfltian Eiid©a?or. Used by tienniasion.\" Topic for January 9, 1943 \"BE STILL AND KNOW\" Scripture: Psalms 4:4; 46:10 For The Leader It is a good thing when we can take the time to \"be still\" and to plan with God. We are still at the beginning of this new year. A lot of time and service lies ahead of us. If nat- ural events continue, it will be a year of a lot of fast inove- ment on our part. As a nation we are keyed up to a war- fever tempo. These is little time for rest or meditation. Few people are up-to-date in the things they have to do. We tend to ignore the things which do not have to be done, in favor of the so called necessary duties. Thus we tend to overlook the quiet periods of meditation and prayer which we need. The hour of prayer is laid aside in favor of earthly duties. We are paying the penalty in unrest, nervousness and dis- content. From out of the scriptures comes this call, \"Be still and know.\" Its word at once bring a calm and a peace. The hour of prayer will better fit us for the day of work. It dare not be neglected, for to so do means the loss of our spiritual anchor, even Christ. DISCUSSION 1. \"BE STILL.\" To a child, the words \"be still\" are but a prelude to a greater activity. As well tell Niagara to stop flowing as to tell a child to be still. But we are a little older physically, if not in some other ways, and we should know the meaning of these words. How often we have seen a person who is ever on the go, always rushing madly from one task to another, starting many things, and getting little done. A day to them is but a burning up of nervous and physical energy. We say to them, \"be still\" and we find that they do not know how to be still. Likewise with the Christian. We have become so conceited to think that unless we are ever on the go that the work of the Lord will fail. Not so, for Christ is back of His work. There comes the time each day when we are to be still. That is, a quiet period of time when we should commune with our Lord. We are often weak and helpless as Christians because we have not taken the time to \"be still\" with God. Fifteen minutes alone with God in the morning will give strength for fifteen hours of labor a day. We need God to help over temp- tation throughout the day. So, let us be still and listen to God when he speaks. 2. \"BE STILL AND KNOW.\" One of the great sources of strength for the day is the knowledge that God is with us in our work. If you don't believe this, just try living a day without God. Forget to pray in the morning. Forget to thank Him at meal times. Forget to read your Bible. Forget to thank Him for the benefits of life. Forget to trust Him. At night, go to bed, and, if you still can, forget to pray to Him. If you are any kind of a Christian at all, you will never get to the end of that day without feeling your personal loss of God's companionship. Before night comes you will realize how much you depend on God. If you are used to getting along without God, just try a day with Him. Pray at morning time, at meals, at night. Trust Him and praise Him. Seek His company in all things. Then go back to the old careless way, if you can. The inspiring Christian is the one who has a close walk with God. It comes from the period of morning meditation, from aciking God's blessing upon the day's work. It comes from KNOWING that God goes with us. We need God this year. Let us trust Him more each day. Let us feel Him! nearer to us. I 3. \"KNOW THAT I AM GOD.\" This is the full intention of this verse. We are to be still and know that Jehovah; Lord, is God. None other, no other gods, but Jehovah God. If there is more than one God, then to have order and reason in the universe, there must be one supreme God. For instance, banks have a lot of presidents, and a very dignified list of people the presidents are. But do you notice that of the whole list, there is but one real President? The rest are still presidents, but they are Vice-Presidents. One must be the supreme. So, even if there were many gods in this world, one would still have to be above the rest and cliief God. We Christians have a much easier time of it. Through oui meditation and faith we realize that of the whole universe, that of the whole eternities, there is God, the Eternal. He is ever present, all powerful, all knowing, and personal. While He is God of the ages, He is also God of the individual whc has yielded his heart to Him. Eternal God is a Spirit anc He communes with His image in us, our spirit, when w( open our heart to Him. We are accountable to Him for al that we do. It is to our advantage to seek His face througl our meditation and prayer. Then to follow Him where'er hi leads us this year. 4. OUR GOD CANNOT BE RUSHED. We note the word' of sur scripture suggest a time of quiet. Yes, it takes timi to commune with God. It cannot be a rush proposition. Man; people have testified that it takes hours to effect the prope i attitude with God. Sometimes we must wait until our bodie become quieted, our nerves rested, and our thoughts coUecte before we can feel God near to us. But it is worth it. Th soul which has been alone with God is a powerful soul. Thi January 1, 1944 11 is the soul which will exalt God and praise Him. This is the soul which will seek to bring others to Christ. This soul will serve Christ in the Church. There may not be much in the way of publicity or earthly honor, but such a person will live gloriously for Christ, In this modern day, we do not take time enough to wor- ship God. If a worship service goes one minute over the hour, about 757c of the audience goes home mentally. It is tragic, but no longer can we let the Spirit direct the length of the services. We must close on the dot. This is because we are rushed. But God cannot be rushed. The heart which desires to commune with Him must wait his bidding. A cleansed heart, a forgiving spirit, a longing for God will do wonders in bringing our hearts in tune with God. If we practice the hour of meditation at morning time and the hour of praise at night, our lives will be of that kind which Christ can use. It is the life that will win the moral and spiritual battles of 1944. QUESTIONS 1. How long should our morning and evening prayers be? 2. How often during the day should we pray? 3. What things will help us to pray in public? 4. What is meant by \"preaching in prayers?\" 5. How does God speak to us ? 6. When does God speak to us? The Children s Story Mrs. Loretta Carrithers, Supt. Dear Children: \"Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\" —Matthew 6:3. I once knew an old man who was very wealthy, but he had a stingy heart. He had made most of his money by pinching pennies. He never spent much money on himself or on any one else. In fact, he never married because he was afraid it would cost too much to support a wife. So he lived alone and kept on hoarding his money. He was a very regular attendant at church, and when he was absent one could be pretty sure that he was ill. He en- tered heartily into the singing and was very attentive to the sermon, but when the plate was passed he always dropped in a copper cent. Now it happened one morning after service when the trus- tees were counting the offering they found a five dollar gold piece among the coins. They were highly elated to think that one of the worshippers would make such a fine contribution. Just then our stingy friend rushed up excitedly and said he had put in a five dollar gold piece by mistake thinking it was a new cent aid asked for four dollars and ninety-nine cents in change. But the treasurer of the church said, \"You gave it to the Lord. It belongs to Him now and I cannot give it back. Besides, you should not let your left hand know what your right hand doeth.\" The old man went away in a rage for he know nothing about the real joy that comes from giving to the Lord. He didn't give as the Lord had prospered him, and it made him a miser. When Jesus was standing in the temple. He noticed how the people were putting their gifts into the treasury. The rich men came with large sums, but Jesus didn't say much about them. He was interested in a poor woman who cast two mites into the box. Then He said, \"This poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have east into the treasury; for all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had even her living.\" So you see that Jesus doesn't measure a gift by its size, but by the amount the person has left after giving the gift. The poor widow had nothing left so she made the greatest sacrifice. One day a crowd of five thousand people followed Jesus into the country. It was getting late, and they were hungry. Most of them had forgotten to take food with them. Andrew- found a boy who had five small barley cakes and two dried fishes for his lunch. The boy gladly gave them to Jesus. Then Jesus fed the multitude. He blessed the lunch so that there was enough for all and twelve basketsfull remained. No doubt He gave the surplus to the generous lad. This story illustrates the fact that God always blesses the person who gives to Him. Jesus said, \"Give and it shall be given unto you,\" and God said, \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse and prove me herewith, if I will not open the mndows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\" Let us give to God generously, sacrificially, and willingly. Then we shall find that, \"it is more blessed to give than to receive.\" With love, in Christ's Name, Aunt Loretta. BULLETIH BOARV SUGGESTIONS Suggested by Rev. E. J. Bcel^ey 1. God is no respecter of persons. 2. The Lord gives His presence to those that recognize Him. 3. It is better to be in trouble and have God with you, than it is to be out of trouble without Him. 4. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. 5. Don't criticize the Bible, let the Bible criticize you. 6. Worship is conscious recognition of God. 7. Sins get all people dowm. 8. Salvation gets all people up. PRAYER MEETING DEPARTMENT Conducted by Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Sibert Susgested Outlines LESSON 50 Subject: Joshua, the Successor of Moses 1. Joshua was the son of Nun of the tribe of Ephraim. He was first mentioned at the battle of Amalek, where he led the forces of Israel. Numbers 13:8; Exodus 17:9. 2. He became the companion of Moses, serving him and at- tending him on certain important occasions. He went part way up Mt. Sinai when the ten commandments were given to Moses. Exodus 24:12, 13; Exodus 33:11. 3. Joshua was one of the spies sent from Kadesh to view the land of Canaan. With Caleb, he brought back a good re- port of the land. Ten of the spies were afraid of the people in Canaan and recommended going back to Egypt. Caleb and Joshua were full of faith and eager to go up at once. Num- bers 13:30; Numbers 14:6. 7, 8. 12 The Brethren Evangelist 4. All the murmurers died in the wilderness, that is, all above twenty years old. The ten spies were slain by the plague. Caleb and Joshua were rememembered and blessed by the Lord for their faithfulness. Numbers 14:22-24; Num- bers 14:28-30. 5. Joshua was divinely appointed and ordained as successor of Moses. Moses gave a solemn charge before all Israel, and pledged the presence of the Lord. Numbers 27:18-2.3; Deu- teronomy 31:7, 8. fi. After the death of Moses Joshua was divinely installed as leader of the children of Israel. The Lord gave him en- couragement for his task, and told him what he must do to be successful. Notice especially verse 8 of the following refer- ence. Joshua 1:1-9. 7. Joshua did not argue with the Lord. He was more than ready to go. Indeed, he had been ready to go for forty years. As soon as he got the signal to move, he moved. Joshu:\\ 1:10, 11. 8. As Joshua opened his campaign three supernatural things happened to him which showed that the Lord was with him. First, the river Jordan divided to let the Israelites pass over. Joshua 3:14-17. Second, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joshua and told him how and where to attack the great city of Jericho. Joshua 5:13-15; Joshua 6:2-5. Third, the walls of the city fell flat, after the divine plan had been carried out. Joshua 6:12-21. 9. Joshua met with only one reverse. He was defeated when he first attacked Ai. Some one had disobeyed, and ab- solute obedience is necessary in the Lord's army. (Have some read Chapter 7 before the class convenes, and tell the story in class). 10. Joshua went steadily forward until the greater portion of the land had been subdued. In all, he dethroned thirty-one kings. Before he died he delivered a valuable farewell ad- dress to Israel. Joshua left a precious influence in Israel. Joshua 24:14-16; Joshua 24:29-31. PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICT NEWS Conducted by Rev. C. Y. Gilmer An Unusual Revival at Calvary, N. J. The Calvary Brethren Church has just experienced one of her greatest revivals. Rev. Charles Johnson of Carleton, Ne- braska, was the evangelist. A two weeks meeting was the original schedule, but the attendance and interest demanded a third week. This shows that gas and tire shortage did not prevent people from hearing the old, old story when preached under the anointing of the Spirit. The average at- tendance of the entire series of meetings was in excess of fifty, which is a good crowd for a church located at the inter- section of country roads. Some travelled over twenty miles one way, and one couple, in particular, traveled fifty miles to attend. The services were supported by delegations from neighboring churches and prayer groups of the county. Neigh- boring pastors attended and assisted in making the meetings a success. The members and friends of the Calvary Church are to be commended for their faithfulness. One family driving fifteen miles one way did not miss a single service; another family, driving fourteen miles one way, missed but one service. A lady, seventy-two years of age, walked three miles twice in order to attend the meetings; another lady of eighty-one years missed but one service. Although plans had not been made to use outside talent, many times the pastor, Rev. E. J. Black, was compelled to omit some musical selections be- cause the program was so full of voluntary talent. At the close of the evangelistic service on Saturday eve- ning, November 20, about twenty came forward for recon- secration, and at the concluding service the entire congre- gation with few exceptions came forward for prayer and rededication. Three young people made the good confession, and there will be several additions to the local membership by letter and by baptism. These additions are all sincere young men and women for whom the pastor and people have been praying for several years, and they are fitted for places of leadership in the church. The kindness and hospitality shown the pastor and evan- gelist during the three weeks as they visited in the homes of the congregation and community was superb. Rev. Johnson began to fear that he would become so stout from the Jersey menus that the Nebraska people would not be able to recog- nize him on his return. Brother Black was very pleasantly surprised on the evening of his birthday, which came within the time of the meetings, when the evangelist \"pulled\" a sur- prise by presenting several gifts and a purse of money to him from the people. Brother Black expresses his thanks publicly to Brother Johnson for his splendid messages, and his sincere and direct manner of delivering deep, inspiring and helpful sermons. He deems it also a privilege and a joy to have entertained him in the parsonage where much profitable' fellowship was enjoyed. The Regional Bible Conference held its monthly conference at the Sergeantsville Brethren Church, Sergeantsville, N. J., Friday, December 3. The after- noon session opened at three o'clock with twenty-eight pres- ent. Rev. Clifford Greiner, pastor of the Clinton Baptist Church, brought a very practical lecture on the subject, \"The Second Coming of Our Lord.\" Over one hundred, including eight ministers, were in attendance at the evening session. Rev. Herman Armerding of Plainfield, N. J., was the guest speaker. His subject, \"The Four Portraits of Christ,\" was very interesting and inspiring. News From Our Churches MEXICO, INDIANA The second Sunday in October the Mexico Brethren Church observed Rally Day and Homecoming. Sunday School and worship hour in the morning and the sermon by our pastor, Rev. Arthur Tinkle. There was a bountiful dinner at the noon hour. In the afternoon. Dr. J. Raymond Schutz, pastor of our North Manchester Church, gave a very inspiring mes- sage. A program of music and readings made an inspiring afternoon service. The week of November 7-14 Rev. C. C. Grisso conducted a Bible conference for us using illustrated charts on God's Plan of Redemption from Genesis to Revelation. These studies were greatly appreciated and very instructive to all. They made the sinner think about his soul and made the Christian rejoice in his redemption. We recommend Brother Grisso and his illustrated charts to any church. We had splendid cooper- I ■ Januaiy 1, 1944 13 ation from other churches in our town. On Saturday night three girls from Taylor University rendered two beautiful vocal numbers. On Sunday night the choir of the Church of the Brethren had charge of the music. On Sunday evening, November 21st, we held our Love Feast. This was a very impressive service, but not as well attended as it should have been. We were pleased to have some of the members of the Peru Brethren Church present to commune with us in this happy service. We miss our young men who are serving our country when we gathei' around our communion tables, as well as at other services. Miss Barbara Beecher, a returned missionary from India, will speak to us in the near future, and the Tripper sisters of Peru will give a musical program. Mrs. C. H. Black. §D§n§ TRAVEL FLASHES Burlington, Indiana \"In the heart of the corn belt\" or if not that, it seemed so to a Buckeye. About the finest two-weeks of weather one ever saw at this time of the year, with plenty of Fall work still to be done and an epidemic of \"colds\" — that was the mixture we experienced in this splendid country of good roads, big fanns and the worried and troubled people with exciting news and rumors with every new hour — all this and somo more was a part of the revival at this town of Burlington, Indiana. Wayne Swihart, one of our youngest pastors, settled here only since the School Year started and with two churches to pastor, together with a full-course school job, missed not a night and did his part as fully and diligently as the insuffi- cient hours of the day would allow. We had splendid fel- lowship together and ate a good many luxurious meals in the homes of the Brethren. Mrs. Bame who spent a week with me here and then slipped away to Chicago wrote back to me \"anyway, wherever you are, you are well cared for; it is a fine bunch of people in that church. I liked them.\" As a certain autioneer repeatedly said: \"anybody would.\" We had a lovely home with Brother Charles Hendrix near school and Church with a full-upstairs to ourselves and the best of cuisine all the time. We had other places to go for a part of the time, but stuck fast here because all was so con- genial and so completely satisfactory. Co-operation was good from the Church of the Brethren folks near here. On one night, they gave special music and gave us almost one-third of our audience. From the town churches, we had about the poorest attendance of any of our meetings for many months. The attendance was good all through the two weeks. Flora Brethren dismissed one Sunday night and with Cambria, that traveled 15 miles also with us, the house was filled to capacity which is not too usual these days with half of our people tied up in the war and war-work. The \"Pillars of the church\" whose names one does not need to mention, knowm in each congregation because of their pressing and ultimate necessity to its continuity were with us at every meeting and gave needed encouragement and assistance. One business man told me \"the day after\" that he supposed that I was not satisfied with the results but he could testify that we \"did a lot of good.\" I like to hear of such testimonies, espe- cially from merchants \"not of us,\" even though I do expect this man soon to be of us. No evangelist who counts results by the number of \"con- verts\" these days, would remain at such a task. Even though the collections are better than they have sometimes been, it takes courage to go from place to place with only a small percentage of results compared with a quarter century ago; but our command is the same and the need so much greater that we continue urging our Church people never to forsake the direction of our progress in the course of our Lord Jesus Christ who ordered \"some evangelists.\" If we allow our peo- ple to depend on card-signing — a thing that makes no real Christians; if we do not use these opportunities to \"strength- en our brethren,\" we are remiss in our fidelity to HIM. We did get results. A number of young people decided to follow Jesus and become Christians and will be baptized later. Others who did not fully yield, encouraged us by their faithfulness to hear the gospel message; the word which is \"quick and powerful and sharp\" and of which it is said: it \"will not re- turn unto me void.\" Charles A. Bame, Carey, Ohio. §n§n§ NEWS FROM MT. OLIVE CHURCH, VIRGINIA The Mt. Olive Brethren church in Rockingham County, Virginia, completed its physical preparation for the Fall and Winter months by the building of a new chimney. This was a much needed repair since the former one had become dangerous to use. The church plant now seems in good condition. The spir- itual state of the church should be greatly improved and in good condition since October 4 to 17 found us engaged in a revival series of services under the able leadership of Broth- er Clarence Fairbanks, our pastor at Washington. Three per- sons were baptized on the last night of the meeting and the services of confirmation followed. Brother Fairbanks, a recent graduate of our Seminary, is a very consecrated and well prepared young man. His man- ner of delivery is forceful and interesting. His sermons were Biblical and well illustrated. The attendance, consequently, was consistent and very good in numbers for the present when consideration is given to the long distances some of our people have to travel on ever shortening gasoline ra- tions. The Lord blessed us with perfect weather for the meeting since for the most part it was fair and warm. The offering brought for the evangelist was the best of any since my long pastorate here, which thing was a source of satisfaction to me. Mrs. Fairbanks and charming little baby daughter were here for the meeting as w-as a member of ours now residing in Washington, Brother Walter Koontz. We were very glad to welcome him into our midst again. Brother Koontz was formerly our Sunday School Superintendent and together with Brother Joseph Beckone did most of the labor and planning of our new Sunday School rooms and general im- provement of the looks and comfort of our house of worship. The appointment which I missed here by being in Ashland. Ohio, was cared for by a former pastor. Rev. George W. Chambers, who now resides at Roadesville, Orange County, Virginia. While in Ashland I was glad to see Fels Lam and Dorothy, his wife. Fels is a member of this church and the people here rejoice with him in his achievements as student and now as pastor of the Dickey Church of the Brethren. Dorothy Lam is the college nurse, as well as a college stu- dent, and doing well at both, besides keeping house at the parsonage next door to the church. They were beginning a revival there the days ours in Ashland closed. We want to thank the Washington Church for loaning us Brother Fairbanks for the meeting and trust and pray that their church will grow in grace and in numbers under his leadership. John F. Locke, Pastor. 14 The Brethren Evangelist CALVARY, NEW JERSEY REVIVAL At General Conference of this year arrangements were made for me to go to New Jersey to assist in a meeting at the Calvary church. The date was set for the 31st of Oc- tober. On that date I spoke to the Sergeantsville Church in the morning and in the afternoon opened our meeting at Calvary. Here is a small church, set at the cross roads of one of the many roads of New Jersey. The membership is not large but what they lack in numbers they made up in quality for here I found a people that knew how to pray and to work for the things of God, in the face of great oppo- sition. People said an Evangelistic meeting could not be held at the present time because of gas and tire rationing and people being too busy but where a people are willing to pay the price and leave the results with God He can overrule all difficulties. It might be of interest to notice what people will do who are interested in the things of God. People came to this meeting, but where from : from all over the country. On the closing Sunday Brother Black took a show of hands. Ten had traveled less than five miles, nine between five and ten miles, eighteen between ten and fifteen rails, four be- tween fifteen and twenty miles and four over twenty miles. The count was taken on Sunday but this was a regular thing at each service. Some who did not have the gas to use walked to their work that they might drive to church in the evening. No special arrangements have been made for music yet folks came in, offering their services, until it became neces- sary to ration time. The meeting was scheduled for two weeks but toward the close of the second week the interest was growing to such an extent it was voted to continue for another week. What God can do if we will but do our part. Calvary today has three young men and one young lady who are looking forward to a more definite work for the Master. May He ever encourage them in the forward looking step. The treatment to the Evangelist was such as to make one long to go back. Homes were opened, meals served and words of encouragement spoken, to such an extent as to embarrass one when he thought of his many imperfections. The offering given was beyond expectation. Brother Black is doing a fine piece of work in New Jersey. It is not all roses for him for among the many roses are also the thorns. Why is it that in the Garden of God w-here one has his choice of being either a rose or a thorn, so many choose to be thorns? Yet amid all the trials he continues to go forward. It was a real joy to have folks tell me of their love for their pastor. May the abounding love of God ever lead this people on to greater fields of usefulness for Him is my sincere prayer. C. E. Johnson. §n§n§ REVIVAL SERVICE AT STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA The Stockton Brethren Church is still reaping the rich harvest of blessings brought about by the ministry of Rev. Robert Palmer and Rev. and Mrs. Melvin Palmer in a special revival service held October 24 to November 7. The evening services were conducted by Brother Robert Palmer; and through his stirring messages the brethren were all brought closer to the Lord. Brother Melvin Palmer, The Blind Evangelist, and his wife led the Volunteer Club for school children each afternoon. The first day's attendance was only five, but by the end of the first week there were thirty-nine children of grammar and junior high school ages present. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, and through the united effort of all the Palmers, a number of children and one man were led to accept Jesus Christ as their own personal Savior from sin. The conversion of the husband and father of a family of six marked the completion of a Christian fam- ily circle. It is the prayer of the entire congregation that God may richly bless these loved ones as they continue to serve Him in this wonderful way. Virgil Ingraham. §n§n§ GEORGETOWN, DELAWARE It was a great pleasure to us in Delaware to have Brother I. D. Bowman with us for a week, to hear some of the Proph- etic lectures prepared by him. We felt that they were a storehouse of information as well as a mine from which he drew out and made clear the Heavenly scenery. It was a real treat to the Mt. Olivet Brethren to have Brother Bow- man with us. Our folks enjoyed him as he visited their homes as well as the service he rendered in the Church. Brother Bowman always tries to leave the Church in a stronger spir- itual condition and in a fuller fellowship with their pastor. These are two good points for every evangelist or invited speaker to have. We were also fortunate the same week to have with us \"The Good Will Trio.\" These three girls were formerly in my parish when I was the pastor of the AUentown Brethren Church. The trio sang some of the most wonderful and up- lifting hymns for us. Their harmony was of the best and their voices very sweet. Our members and the outsiders visiting with us speak very highly of their work and stay with us. We all hope some day that the Lord will make it possible for us to have them with us for a Camp-meeting as they would be a blessing unto us and a drawing card for out- siders. These Girls of AUentown come from good substantial Brethren and I enjoyed the loyal friendship of the Silberman and Seagreaves, while as their pastor, as well as when the opportunity so affords it. Two of these girls I took into fel- lowship with the church while there as pastor; these are Eileen and Ethel Silberman. The third was Janice Seagreaves. She was as a little child, an attendant of our Sunday School with her parents George and Evelyn Seagreaves. May I say, that the girls stay with us was both pleasant and helpful. The last Sunday at the morning service we licensed Brother George Hagenbuch to preach while he completed his studies for the Ministry at the Moody Bible Institute. This act was taken by the Church here at a called meeting at the church on the previous Friday. Our desire was to try to help Brother Hagenbuch to help himself while in school, this help would go two ways, in experience by study and preaching and with the remuneration to help pay the expenses. While as Pastor in AUentown, Pa., I baptized Brother George Hagen- buch, who later married our oldest daughter Ruth. We are glad to know that these are both going to school and as Brother Hagenbuch had some training at Moody before he is allowed the credit for that work and hope to go right on to his completion for the Ministry. Ruth will take voice and thereby be a helper in the work before them. When Brother Hagenbuch graduates the Church hopes to present him before the Brethren Examining Board and if agreeable to them will have him ordained to the ministry. May we hope and pray that the Brethren Church will con- tinue to have no other Creed than the Bible, and that we will stand for the Bible, the Whole Bible and NOTHING but the Bible. S. E. Christiansen. January 1, 1944 15 ffiatln tn l&tBt McCLOY — Mrs. Annie Myers McCloy departed this mortal earth sphere on November 17, 1943, aged 76 years, 8 months and 2 days. She was the wife of D. C. McCloy, relict, and together with her late husband was one of the charter mem- bers of the Mt. Pleasant Brethren church. During the writer's second pastorate of the Uniontown congregation she and her husband cast their lot with the Uniontown group. A bit over six years ago Sister McCloy suffered a paralytic stroke, from which she never recovered, remaining a helpless invalid who was tenderly and devotedly cared for by her son and his fine wife. Many of the Brethren ministers who have preached for the Mt. Pleasant congregation will remember the hos- pitality of her home during their stay in the community. Sister McCloy is survived by her son — and only child — Arthur, a brother. Elder M. C. Myers, of Wilkinsburg, Penna., a grandson, Mr. Jack McCloy, of Mt. Pleasant, and three great-grandchildren. Funeral services were held at the family home in Mt. Pleasant on Saturday afternoon, November 20, with Rev. J. E. Hartman, of the Reunion Presbyterian church of Mt. Pleasant (of which church the son and wife are mem- bers) in charge and the writer as a representative of the Brethren church, and a long-time friend of the deceased, as- sisting. Interment was in the Mt. Pleasant Cemetery beside her husband. \"We sorrow not as those who have no hope.\" Dyoll Belote. He left his companion, one son, Leonard, three grand- children, one sister and three brothers. Funeral services were conducted by his pastor. Brother H. E. Eppley and the un- dersigned. R. F. Porte. GARLAND— The Pittsburgh First Brethren Church has been called upon to be parted by the messenger of death, from another of its older and ever faithful members. Mrs. Mary Ann (Moore) Garland departed this life October 5th, 1943, after a brief illness of pneumonia and complications, in her seventy-seventh year. She was the youngest of a family of six children of Rev. Samuel A. Moore, a dunkard minister, and Mrs. Moore, and was born in Bedford County, Pa., near Saxton. After remov- ing to Cambria and to Somerset Counties, the family located in Pittsburgh in 1889. She became a member of the First Brethren Church in 1894, and was active and constructive in its interests through the long years which followed. Married to Joseph W. Garland in 1884, four sons were born, all of whom survive and are members of the First Church. Two of them serve in official capacities. Three grandchildren also survive, one a staff sergeant in the military. Funeral services were conducted from a funeral home by this WTiter, who became her pastor only two months before her death, assisted by Rev. W. H. Neff, of the Pittsburgh Church of the Brethren. Truly, \"Blessed are the dead\" — who live and die in the Lord, and doubly blessed are their children. William S. Crick. MAUZY — Howard L. Mauzy was born in Tippecanoe Town- ship, Kosciusko County, Indiana, near Dutchtovvn, on Octo- ber 23, 1885 and passed to his eternal reward on Sunday, October 31, 1943, at the age of 58 years. Brother Mauzy was one of those Christian men to whom a pastor looks for advice and help. He filled the office of deacon, Sunday School superintendent and teacher at various times during his life. Always faithful, congenial, kind and helpful to every one. The community has lost a valuable neighbor and Christian gentleman and his place will remain vacant in the Dutchtown Brethren Church for a long time. HARPER — Elizabeth Harper, for many years a loyal mem- ber of the Ashland Brethren church, departed this life No- vember 11, 1943, aged eighty-three years, six months and twenty-five days. She had been an invalid for quite a num- ber of years, during which she suffered patiently, until death released her, and she died in the triumph of a living faith in the Lord to whom she liad long ago surrendered her life. She leaves to mourn her departure, two sons, one sister, six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren, and a host of sincere friends and Brethren. Funeral services were conducted by the writer, assisted by Brother Inman, pastor of the city Church of the Brethren. Burial was made in the cemetery at Hayesville, Ohio, in which village she had spent many of the years of her earthly sojourn. ■ -,-■-,, Martin Shively. BARINGER — Mrs. Celesta Keyes Baringer passed away at her home in Fremont, Ohio, on Thursday, December 2, 1943, at the age of seventy-five years. She had been in failing health for several years. She was bom November 8, 1867 in Marion, Ohio, the daughter of the late George and Sophia Keyes. She was mar- ried to Philip J. Baringer in Marion County, Ohio, in 1886. He preceded her in death in 1897. To this union was born one son, E. W. Baringer. In 1900 she was united in marriage to John Baringer, half-brother of her first husband. Follow- ing this marriage they moved to Fremont. John Baringer preceded her in death in 1920. She was a member of the W. C. T. U. and the First Breth- ren Church of Fremont. She was superintendent of the Sun- day School for many years and Treasurer of the church for a long period, until ill health forced her to give up her duties. Surviving besides the son are a granddaughter. Miss Ava Baringer, one step-grandson, Edward Raschke, a step-grand- daughter, Mrs. Ralph Cessna. A brother, Sylvester E. Keyes of Marion, and a sister, Mrs. Emma Gruber of Marion County, also survive. Funeral services were held at the Ochs Funeral Home with Rev. Frank A. Jordan of Clyde officiating. Burial was made at Marion, Ohio, with short services at the grave. RENSBERGER— Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Rensberger passed away at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Alta Walters, near Walkerton, Indiana, on November 23, 1943. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Hoke, and was born in Huntington County, Indiana. She was married to Mr. Simon Rensberger on April 17, 1887 and to this union was born one son and one daughter. The son, John Rensberger, is a resident of Bryan, Ohio. Her husband passed away December 4, 1935. For many years they lived on a farm near Teegarden, Indiana. They were members of the Brethren Church in Tee- garden and were very active church workers as long as pos- sible. Since the death of her husband she has not been able to attend and take an active part as much as she, would have liked to. Her death was caused by a paralytic stroke. The funeral services were conducted by the writer in the Teegarden Church on Saturday, November 27th, at ten o'clock, and in the First Brethren Church in Elkhart, Indiana, 16 The Brethren Evangelist on the same day at two o'clock, assisted by Brother Monroe, pastor of the Teegarden Church, Brother Claud Studebaker, pastor of the South Bend Church, and Brother George Pon- tius of Elkhart.

Metcalf, were loyal and faithful members of the Brethren Church. Mr. Metcalf preceded his companion in death fourteen years ago. The funeral service was held in the Teegarden Brethren Church, the writer officiating. O. C. Lemert. IN MEMORIAM In memory of Miss Viola McBride, beloved member of th>; West Third Street Brethren Church of Dayton, Ohio. Services held at West Alexandria, Ohio, by Rev. E. J. Beekley. The Business Manager's Corner y oeorge S. B aer The Largest OFfering Yet That is the goal that is being set before the brotherhood for the Publication Day Offering the last Sunday in January. There are good reasons why that offering should be the largest. 1. In these critical times the church's agency for printing and spreading abroad the Gospel Message and all matters relating to religious life and work must be enabled to operate in the most efficient manner. The church's task was never more challenging than it is today. Many church leaders realize this fact, but it must grip the mind and heart of the rank and file. Polit- ical leaders and government officials are acknowledging it. We have already had occasion to witness public recognition of the vital importance of the church to the maintenance of home morale. In our capacity as Business Manager we have presented to certain government officials the vital importance to the national welfare of allowing the church and its print- ing plant to operate unimpeded and unhindered in efficiency. And thus far we have received favorable response and have been allowed the skilled labor necessary. If the government gives recognition to the church as an institution that is essen- tial to its life in these trying times, how much more ought the members of the church themselves be alive to the urgency of supplying the funds and other means of support that are so necessary to the highest efficiency of the church's printing plant, which in turn is necessary to the church's best service to a nation in distress and to the hungry hearts of men and women ? Let us thing seriously of the challenge that is pre- sented to us in these times. 2. A second reason why we should give largely to the Pub- lication Day Offering is because the Publishing arm of the church is a vital and very real part of the Lord's work com- mitted unto his church. The very fact that God has given unto men his written Revelation and has caused it to be preserved in spite of fire and sword and heretic through the centuries is sufficient proof that he would have us continue the propagation of that blessed Word through the printed page. This is a note we have often sounded, but must continue to re-echo until it has gotten into the hearts as well as on the ears of our people. God has placed it upon our hearts to urge that you give to and support in every way, the Publishing House as you would the strong arm of the church. 3. Again, the offering should be large this year because it is the aim to use a portion of it to apply on the finishin,g of at least one of the rentals that we have on our hands but not ready for use. Once the little building erected beside the Publishing House is finished and ready for occupancy, it can be easily rented and be a source of income. The other apartments are also yet to be finished, but we cannot go any faster ^vith that work than the funds supplied by the church make possible. And finishing the rentals is by no means the only big and urgent need of the Publishing House. Much equipment ought to be modernized and renewed. But these needs are for future chap- ters in our story. Suffice it to say now that we are asking for the offering to be increased far enough above the amount usually given for the support of the Publishing House to en- able us to pay for the finishing of the little building that will soon be ready for rental, thanks to the aggressiveness of the Prudential Committee. 4. A fourth reason for a large and generous offering is because the Publication Day Offering is an authorized annual offering of General Conference, and the National Goals Pro- gram adopted by the 1943 Conference calls for an annual offering of at least $.5,000.00. That calls for a larger offering in all our churches than has customarily been given. $5,000 is not an unreasonable asking for a cause so vital. It can easily be given if the churches catch the vision. Give as unto the Lord and in a manner that would not cause you to be ashamed, if He stood in your church watch- ing the givers, as he watched them dropping their gifts in Temple box of old.

The name of Brother N. V. Leatherman, when removed from the Berlin, Pennsylvania, pastorate to give place for the name of Brother Whetstone, the present pastor, was inad- vertently omitted from the list of Ministers without Churches. Brother Leatherman's name should appear under this list on page 66. It might be said here that not all names appear- ing on this list are inactive, for many are very active in other departments of the church work. Below is the way Brother Leatherman's name should appear in the annual: Leatherman, N. V. Berlin, Pa. Field Secretary for Ashland College Note also the change of Brother E. D. Bumworth's address: Burnworth, E. D. Muncie, Indiana 1317 Kirby Avenue Pastor Muncie Church QUOTING FROM THE GOSHEN, INDIANA, BULLETIN, Brother H. H. Rowsey, we find the following: \"A happy sur- prise is the way the pastor describes the announcement which was made by Herman Roscoe at the church serv'ice. That an- nouncement reveals that $3,000.00 in building Fund bonds were retired this month (December). That is twice the amount of our usual goal and four times the amount called for under our refinancing program. We are happy for this victory and are looking forward to the complete wiping out of this debt within the next two or three years.\" We rejoice along with the Goshen brethren for this fine victory. FROM A RECENT ROANN, INDIANA, BULLETIN, we glean the following: \"There will be a Union Bible Institute held on the following dates: January 11, 13, 18 and 20.\" Brother Smith F. Rose is the pastor. DR. J. R. SCHUTZ, PASTOR OF THE NORTH MAN- CHESTER BRETHREN CHURCH, is doing a fine thing in that he is conducting a High School and Young People's Forum in his home for any interested young people of the city. We gather from this announcement that this is being conducted on Sunday evenings, either before or after church. We also note that Brother Schutz held a week of meetings in Bluffton, Indiana, early in December in which all the churches of that city participated. FROM THE BRYAN, OHIO, BULLETIN WE GATHER that Rev. W. C. Benshofl' of Waterloo, Iowa, is to be the evangelist in a meeting to be held in the Bryan Church from January 30 to February 13. Remember this meeting in yon- devotions. THE EDITOR WISHES TO STEP OUT OF CHARACTER for a moment, and, as president of the Benevolent Board, he wishes to thank Brother Charles A. Bame for his words (in this issue) concerning the Brethren's Home. That Home is a very much misunderstood proposition. When it comes time for the issuing of the material concerning the Benevolent offering next month, we wish to make some very pointed re- marks concerning our Benevolent work. Brother Bame has given you his reaction to the matter in a very fine way and we wish you would read his report (beginning on page 13) and then re-read it. It gives a very fine cross-section of his feeling in this matter. Only those who have had the privilege j of being there in close association with the Home can really understand the situation as it exists. We will have more to say about this matter at a later date. WHAT DOES THE CHURCH MEAN TO YOU? Back somewhere in 1939 Albert Einstein, that great scientist, once antagonistic to the church, made a testimony to a change of heart and attitude regarding his .antipathy to things spiritual and to the church in particular. He stated very definitely that he had never had any use for the church. He always looked upon science as the final and complete authority and was sure that it spoke the ultimate and specific word of power, to the exclusion of all others. But the great conflict that is now devastating the world came into being, and, being sure that science would speak out regarding it, he waited for the voice of authority. But he waited in vain, for science never spoke, ex- cept to set forth the terrors of total warware. Then, with hesitation, he turned to the press, trusting that those who had spoken so boldly in the past would stand forth with the authoritative word which would cause those who headed the strife to cease in their terrible deeds. But he found that the dictator's hand stopped, quite suddenly, the voice which should have sent forth the clarion call for peace. To his amaze- ment the voice which did speak out was the one which he had despised, the voice of the church. At- tempts were made to still it, but it kept on and on, even in the face of terrible persecution— it could never be stilled. And, though with reluctance, he be- gan to see that that which he had despised was more powerful than science, the voice of the press, or any other force in the world. And his conclusion that after all the church is more forceful than any other phase of endeavor in this world, should be a great testimony to the power and authority which the Master of the Universe exerts over his people. Wars cannot still the voice of God'e people. It cannot, even through the dictator's decrees, be trod- den under foot. How true is the saying, \"Truth crushed to earth shall rise again.\" The church may be throttled by human decree ; it may be forbidden to send forth its message in certain parts of the earth; its ministers may be forbidden to preach the message in public — but ever and always we will find those who, like Peter and John of old, will stand up and say, even at the risk of their very lives, \"Wheth- er it be right in the sight of God to harken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard . . . We mu.^t obey God rather than man.\" Here in America we have not learned the lesson of the suppression of the church by dictator's edict. We have been going along in the even tenor of our way, going to church (if the spirit moved us) taking part in the worship; returning for the evening sei'vice (provided we did not have anything else to do) ; at- tending the mid-week service if we felt so inclined; reading our Bibles when we felt like it — and above all taking the whole thing as a matter of course, not realizing what it would mean to us if we were on the other side of the Atlantic with bombs falling upon the helpless as well as the armed; forbidden to call openly on the \"Name of the Lord.\" The trouble with us in America is that we just haven't thought enough about what it would mean if we were suddenly deprived of the privilege of public worship and congregational gatherings. We never have had to face it and we are priding our- selves on the fact that we never will have to. But that was the attitude of those countries across the sea. And it did come to them. It may never come to us, and pray God it never does, but because of the fact that we are free from this bondage should be the incentive which will bring us to our knees in utter thanksgiving for His mercies. Just what anything one thinks means to us is made manifest by our attitude toward it and our treat- ment of it. If the Church means what it should to each of us we should be more faithful to it and have it more in our thoughts and our activities. It is not mere church going that makes the Christian. Many a man has attended church through practically all the years of his life and never grasped the full sig- nificance of what the church stands for or what it should mean in his life. The church just now is the only constant thing. We are not talking about either church buildings or denomination, but of the Body of Christ. Congrega- tions rise and fall; church buildings are built and decay; church membership rolls are revised by hu- man hands — but the real church goes on and on and on. It does this because it is not of this world; it is not a changing thing that can be whirled about by the mei'e desires of men. The church should mean more to us each day we live. We should take time and effort to reevaluate it each day. There should be no sacrifice too great, nor effort too strenuous, that we would give to it. For it is our life; not merely a human incentive, but a spiritual fullness that fulfills each and every need of spirit, soul and body. What's your evaluation of the Church? F. C. V. The Brethren Evangelist NOW CONCERNING THE PUBLICATION DAY OFFERING A Word From the President of the Brethren Publication Board J. E. Stookey Last August, at the time of General Conference, your Publishing Board saw fit to elect me as Presi- dent of the Brethren Publishing Company. I as- sumed that office with a great deal of reluctance, realizing the responsibility that is connected with it. We, here at the Publishing House, are the servants of the Brotherhood, endeavoring to do the things that will promote the Cause of Christ and the Church. The Publishing Company is vital to the existence of the Brethren Church just as much as any other organization of the Church, if not more so. We are making progress in the work of the Pub- lishing Company, but we can advance only to the extent that the Brotherhood will allow us, through their support, both spiritually and financially. We can not hope to advance in the Cause of Christ and the Church except we do a good share of it through the printed page — in other words through Brethren literature. Your contributions are necessary NOW, not to- morrow or next year. The problems of your Board and the Publishing Company are simplified just to the extent that your interest is shown in its progress — particularly in a financial way. Our plans and ad- vances will be governed by you.
