Arbitron says, “Rating value has nothing to do with the length of a commercial... it has to do with the average number of people listening at any one given time. The same number of people are listening to a fifteen second commercial as are listening to a sixty.”  ATTENTIVE LISTENING...People tuned to KDKA are listening attentively for news and information. End result: your 15-second commercials are heard on KDKA!  REACH BUILDER...Many successful advertisers supplement their regular schedule of 60-second commercials with 15-second commercials to increase their weekly reach.  FREQUENCY BUILDER...15-second commercials are a great way to build frequency and maximize results. They create the same impact and impression at about half the price. Even limited budgets can afford to build solid drive-time exposure.  EFFICIENCY...Because 15-second commercials are priced lower than 60-second commercials you can stretch a budget with more commercials to build frequency and achieve a better response.  POSITIVE HALO EFFECT...Because your commercial message is surrounded by news and information, just like 30-second and 60-second commercials, it’s as credible and important as the news surrounding it.  CREATIVE IMPACT...15-second commercials can deliver a powerful message. They are used effectively as sponsorships of KDKA’s most-listened-to information elements, such as traffic and weather. An effective 15-second commercial is energetic and direct!

He describes the program as looking at life from a religious perspective. That means you can look at everyone and everything, and agree or disagree, from Pope Francis to Satanism, from addiction to spiritual renewal, from Hitler to Mother Teresa, or anything that interests or concerns you. If you want, the program offers you an opportunity to talk back to the church. Each program ends with these words: “Don’t forget how precious life is and how powerful love is. Tell someone now that you love him or her. Pray for peace as if it depended on you alone.”\n\n38. Bohannon began his career in 1960 at his hometown station, KLWT-AM, Lebanon, Mo.
