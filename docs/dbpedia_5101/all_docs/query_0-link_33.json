Tool for sharing information on all aspects dairy including but not limited to; dairy production, marketing, group governance and BDS.AgProcess Concepts Ltd - Consultant was hired to implement program.Initially Prog was to run on CBS but due to its delayed closure, a survey was conducted and Buddu FM and Radio Kitara were found to be the better alternatives\n\n4. Buddu FM – located in Masakawith Offices in Kampala, Sembabule and Kalungucovers masaka, wakiso, Sembabule, mpigi, Kalungu.Radio Kitara- located in Masindi has offices in Kampala and covers Luweero, masindi, nakaseke, nakasongola and parts of Kiboga.\n\n5. Pilot broadcastChose a magazine format to differ from the straight-jacket presenter –caller formatOur maiden broadcast was to be a 6 months pilot run. Purpose was to:Assess receptionEvaluate listernership and feedbackIntegrate farmer recommendations Come up with more suitable format for farmer education and benefit\n\n6. On the whole:Program was well receivedProvided training on most of the aspects of the project and the technologies we are frontingFarmers were given opportunity to participate in call-in sessions and interact with SPs andexpertsAttracted SPs to participate and Sponsor\n\n7. HoweverLimited support from project staff, e.g editorial team was constituted but never satLimited capacity by Radio Buddu to present program in proper format (magazine)Logistical insufficiencies affected data capture from field\n\n8. Credits:Project management for having faith in the programStaff who provided support through active participation on air and those that promoted the program"
