The total amount of new budget authority recommended by the Committee for fiscal year 2000 is $35,282,083,000. This amount is a decrease of $918,189,000 below appropriations enacted for fiscal year 1999 for these departments and agencies. The Committee recommendation is $11,591,468,000 below the budget estimates as amended. This significant difference is partly a result of the Committee's decision not to approve advanced appropriations. highlights of the bill The bill provides funds for fighting crime, enhancing drug enforcement, responding to the threat of terrorism, addressing the shortcomings of the immigration process, continuing the judicial process, conducting commerce within the United States, improving State Department operations, and fullfilling the needs of various independent agencies. internet initiative Global communications and commerce have been revolutionized by the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet also offers unparalleled opportunities for criminal and terrorist enterprises. The Committee recommendation includes funding for a host of initiatives designed to fight computer-based wrongdoing, including: (1) cybercrime teams in the criminal division, U.S. Attorneys, and Federal Bureau of Investigation, (2) grants to State and local law enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to prevent or investigate child sexual exploitation, (3) grants to localities for distance learning, and (4) consumer protection squads at the Federal Trade and Securities Exchange Commissions tasked with combating fraud in the electronic marketplace. These efforts include a focus on protecting children and the elderly. Highlights of the bill include: Department of Justice --$243,000,000 for the Safe Schools initiative of which $180,000,000 is for school resource officers and $63,000,000 for technology, community planning, and prevention activities; --$104,000,000 to enhance law enforcement activities in Indian country; --Increases to fight the proliferation of crime and drugs; --Additional funding to address a comprehensive and coordinated response for counterterrorism efforts, including $204,500,000 to improve State and local response capabilities; --Additional funding for 1,000 Border Patrol agents and associated equipment; --$5,204,000 to enhance the FBI's capabilities to combat child abductions and serial killings; --$22,200,000 for the expansion of DEA regional drug enforcement teams and $56,700,000 to enhance DEA mobile enforcement teams; --Additional funding to DEA for methamphetamine and heroin investigations; --$549,791,000 for new prison building and facilities; --$19,952,000 for the Missing Children Program; --$1,999,550,000 to support State and local law enforcement including: $283,750,000 for the Violence Against Women Program; $452,100,000 for the Edward Byrne Memorial State and $400,000,000 for the Local Law Enforcement Grant Program; $350,000,000 for the Crime Identification Technology Initiative; $40,000,000 for drug courts; $25,000,000 for Bullet Proof Vest Grants; $25,000,000 for the Methamphetamine Program; and $100,000,000 for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant; --$284,597,000 for juvenile justice programs. Department of Commerce --The U.S. Trade Representative is funded at $26,067,000, and the International Trade Commission is funded at $45,700,000; --The Committee recommends funding the International Trade Administration at $308,344,000.

This section restates previous law with regard to the reprogramming of appropriated funds between agency programs or activities. The House and Senate reports accompanying the appropriations bills of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies for several years contained sections concerning the reprogramming of funds between programs or activities. The Committee expects each department and agency to follow closely the reprogramming procedures listed below which are similar to provisions that applied in statute during fiscal year 1997. The Committee desires and expects that both the House and Senate chairmen of the Subcommittees on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies will be notified by letter a minimum of 15 days prior to: --Reprogramming of funds, whether permanent or temporary, in excess of $1,000,000 or 20 percent, whichever is more, between programs or activities. This provision is also applicable in cases where several activities are involved with each receiving less than $1,000,000. In addition, the Committee desires to be notified of reprogramming actions which are less than these amounts if such actions would have the effect of committing the agency to significant funding requirements in future years; --Increasing funds or personnel by any means for any project or activity for which funds have been denied or restricted; --Creation of new programs, offices, agencies, or commissions, or substantial augmentations of existing programs, offices, agencies, or commissions; --Relocations of offices or employees; --Reorganization of offices, programs, or activities; and --Contracts out or privatizes any functions or activities presently performed by Federal employees. The Committee directs each department or agency to notify the Committee when the amount of political appointees rises above 10 percent from either of the previous 2 years or when five political appointees are added. The Committee should be notified 30 days before either of these situations occurs. Similar notification should be provided when the same number of personnel positions are converted from political appointments to civil service positions. In addition, the Committee directs departments or agencies funded in the accompanying bill that are planning to conduct a reduction in force to notify the Committees by letter 30 days in advance of the date of the proposed personnel action. Also, the Committee directs that any items which are subject to interpretation will be reported. Government Performance and Results Act [GPRA].--The Committee recently sent a memorandum to all organizations subject to GPRA funded within this Act. It requested information about the agencies' experiences resulting from the Act. The Committee reiterates that all responses be provided no later than July 1, 1999. TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE The Committee has made funding for law enforcement the centerpiece of the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill. The Committee recommends $17,009,607,000 in new budget (obligational) authority in the accompanying bill for the Department of Justice with a strong emphasis on law enforcement activities for fiscal year 2000. Consolidation of accounting systems.--The Committee directs the Department to plan, develop, and implement a department- wide financial reporting system that would be operational by the end of fiscal year 2000. The Committee is further directed that the Congressional justification books include budget year plus 4 years of funding data for each program line item beginning with the fiscal year 2001 request. General Administration salaries and expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $79,448,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 87,534,000 Committee recommendation................................ 82,485,000 This account funds the development of policy objectives and the overall management of the Department of Justice. The Committee recommends a total of $82,485,000 for fiscal year 2000 for general administration. The recommendation is $3,037,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $5,049,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee recommendation supports the augmentation of the Office of Information and Privacy by six additional reimbursable workyears to meet the increased volume of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act administrative appeals and initial requests. The Committee provides no additional funding for added positions in the Office of Intelligence and Policy Review. No additional funding is provided for the Office of Legislative Affairs [OLA] or the Public Affairs Office [PAO]. The Committee does endorse using non-reimbursable details of career employees. The Committee believes that utilizing the experience of career employees outside of the OLA and PAO offices will provide added insight into the needs of the component agencies and the concerns of the public. joint automated booking system Appropriations, 1999.................................................... Budget estimate, 2000................................................... Committee recommendation................................ $6,000,000 This new account centrally funds development, acquisition, and deployment of the joint automated booking system [JABS]. JABS will standardize booking data, procedures, and equipment throughout Justice. Previously, JABS funding was distributed among various Justice components. The Committee recommendation includes $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for JABS. The recommendation reflects the latest estimate from Justice and fully funds fiscal year 2000 requirements. JABS will save money by eliminating repetitive booking of suspects and improve public safety by identifying repeat offenders and persons with outstanding charges or warrants. The Committee is aware that the program office has just completed a major restructuring of the JABS that will result in life cycle cost savings of over 70 percent. The Committee commends the program office for its efforts and directs that all JABS funding be centralized under the program office as part of the fiscal year 2001 request. Narrowband Communications Appropriations, 1999.................................................... Budget estimate, 2000................................... $80,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 20,000,000 This account centrally funds the conversion of the Department of Justice to narrowband radio communications as mandated by 47 U.S.C. 903(d)(1). The Committee recommendation includes $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for narrowband communications, $60,000,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The recommendation reflects the latest estimate from the Department and fully funds fiscal year 2000 requirements. Previously, narrowband communications compliance funding was scattered among various Justice components. Last year, the Committee was deeply concerned by the proposed narrowband conversion strategy, especially its then- anticipated cost of $1,684,000,000. The Justice Department was directed to present a master plan to Congress that emphasized interoperability and department-wide purchases. In its preliminary report to Congress, Justice demonstrated significant progress in ensuring compliance that is both timely and cost-effective. The Committee commends the authors of the revised strategy for rescuing the narrowband conversion program from certain disaster and looks forward to their final report. Contrary to direction, Justice Department components are still funding radio purchases and other communication systems costs out of base accounts. That is what led the Committee to reduce funding in this account. The Committee directs Justice Management Division [JMD] to identify for the Committees on Appropriations all funding for radios, by component, included in the fiscal year 2000 request. JMD should provide the desired information not later than August 1, 1999. The Committee directs the Justice Department to centralize all radio funding under the narrowband communications program office as part of the fiscal year 2001 request. Counterterrorism Preparedness is deterrence. Our adversaries may know our capabilities, and the risk will continue to diminish as our ability continues to grow. However, we are far from considering this a low-risk issue. In 1998, deaths from terrorism escalated to a new level with 741 deaths and 5,922 injured. The bombings at the U.S. embassy in Kenya killed 291 people and injured about 5,000 people. Of all the terrorist attacks in the world, 40 percent of them were against U.S. targets. The Committee continues to try and address the overwhelming needs of the United States in defending against unconventional terrorist warfare. Attacks with Weapons of Mass Destruction [WMD] and computers are the most discussed. However, the Committee is aware that attacks could be in a variety of forms. We cannot be prepared for all of them, but we can perform risk assessments and decrease the risk to U.S. citizens at home and abroad. With this in mind, the Committee has focused on every aspect of the U.S. Government that has some part of countering terrorism. This includes, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Today, more than 40 Federal departments, agencies, and bureaus, have some role in counterterrorism-related activities. Counterterrorism Fund (including transfer of funds) Appropriations, 1999.................................... $145,000,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 27,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 27,000,000 The Committee recommends $27,000,000 for the ``Counterterrorism fund'' account which was established in Public Law 104-19, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Additional Disaster Assistance, for Anti-Terrorism Initiatives, for Assistance in the Recovery from the Tragedy that Occurred at Oklahoma City, and Rescissions Act, 1995. The recommendation is equal to the request and is $118,000,000 below the 1999 appropriation. This reduction refects a transfer of the first responder grant account to the Office of Justice Programs. This fund is under the control and direction of the Attorney General to: (1) cover the costs incurred in reestablishing the operational capability of an office or facility which has been damaged or destroyed as a result of any domestic or international terrorist incident; (2) cover the costs of providing support to counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or international terrorism, including payment of rewards in connection with these activities; and (3) cover the costs of conducting a terrorism threat assessment of Federal agencies and their facilities. Counterterrorism fund.--The Committee is very concerned the Attorney General's Counterterrorism Fund has been improperly utilized and has become an extension of the Department's annual budget. The traditional mission of the counterterrorism fund is to fund extraordinary costs to provide support to counter, investigate or prosecute domestic or international terrorism. It is expected these extraordinary costs would be incurred in response to an unexpected terrorist threat or act, and not the costs incurred with day to day counterterrorrism operations. These operations should be funded from the Department's annual budget. This high standard is a deliberate effort to maintain the integrity of this fund for its intended purpose. The 1996 political conventions, preparations for the Olympic Games, and the Eric Rudolph manhunt, do not meet this standard. As a result of this mismanagement, funding for the National Infrastructure Protection Center, the National Domestic Preparedness Office, and the Continuation of Operations [COOP]/ Continuity of Government [COG], has been moved to the respective agency accounts. National Guard.--The Committee understands the threat of terrorists using considerable destructive power on individuals, institutions, and facilities. The Committee is especially concerned with the potential use of chemical and biological weapons. The requirements placed upon officials from Federal, State, city, and community agencies are complicated and in many cases unfunded. Most Federal, State, city, and community agencies do not have civil response assets needed to address such a threat or event. These assets include the equipment and training needed to address the demands of terrorism. The Committee continues to recognize that domestic disaster relief is part of each State's responsibility for public safety. The Committee's goals include providing States with an improved ability to respond to terrorist threats or events. This includes training and equipping the first responder who will arrive at the scene within 1 hour of an attack. The Committee is also aware of the State's rapid assessment and initial detection [RAID] elements that are expected to arrive within 6 to 8 hours after an event has occurred. They will assist in confirming the nature of the attack. However, the use of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] could create a situation outside of the response capabilities of local law enforcement. The role of the Department of Justice is to manage crises that are caused by domestic terrorists. This includes the ability to prevent or resolve an act of terrorism. The Committee is aware of the important work the National Guard is doing in preparing for terrorist attacks. The Committee has already provided funding for 254 personnel for RAID teams in fiscal year 2000. The Committee is also aware of the need for the National Guard to have a presence at the National Domestic Preparedness Office. The Committee directs that $300,000 be transferred to the National Guard from the funds provided to the FBI for the NDPO for this effort. Distance learning.--Congress has previously recognized the effectiveness of leveraging existing training capabilities and infrastructure to support emerging and evolving initiatives. The Department of Defense Appropriations for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 directed the Department of Defense to use the National Guard Counterdrug Training Centers and the National Guard Distance Learning Network to provide training for civilian emergency responders and military personnel to plan for and respond to the consequences of weapons of mass destruction. For fiscal year 2000 the Committee already recommended $45,000,000 for the Army National Guard's distance learning and information management requirements. The Committee believes that even greater benefits will accrue from further using these resources in conjunction with the training programs and resources of the Department of Justice. Therefore, we recommend that the Department of Justice and the National Guard establish a collaborative training program to make expanded use of the National Guard Distance Learning Network and other training and education resources of the National Guard and the Department of Justice to train civilian and military personnel. Five-year plan.--In fiscal year 1998, the Committee directed the Attorney General to develop a 5-year interdepartmental counter-terrorism and technology crime plan. The plan is our baseline strategy for coordination of national policy and operational capabilities to combat terrorism in the United States and against American interests overseas. Although primarily a Federal planning document, the plan addresses strategies to strengthen state and local capabilities to respond to terrorism. The plan also identifies critical technologies for targeted research and development efforts, many of which have a direct, practical effect on the ability of State and local responders to combat terrorism. The Committee recognizes the success of this plan is based on the ability of the Attorney General to fully interface with all elements of state and local governments. The initial input from first responders was solicited through a written survey of which fewer than half responded. The Committee directs that a heavy emphasis is placed on the involvement of State, and local governments in the annual updating of this plan. The Attorney General should submit its annual updated report to the Congress regarding the implementation of the plan by March 1, 2000. This status report should include, but not be limited to, the current involvement of State and local governments in the further development of this comprehensive national strategy. It should also include the status of the current domestic threat and provide a risk assessment that is based on what has been funded previously and what will be required in fiscal year 2001. Executive level training program.--The Committee recognizes the imperative to provide mayors, city managers, and their executive emergency management leadership with the skills necessary to plan for, respond to, and mitigate a terrorist incident involving weapons of mass destruction. While numerous initiatives are presently underway at the State and local levels to train first responders, there continues to be a need for intensive executive level crisis management training for local leaders, including mayors, county managers, and senior emergency management personnel. The Committee urges the establishment and operation of an incident response and consequence management training program specifically designated for mayors, county managers, and other senior crisis management personnel. The program should integrate and build upon existing training and data systems to provide resource coordination, contingency planning, crisis management, exercise generation, and decision-aids focused on the needs of U.S. cities. Continuation of Operations [COOP]/Continuity of Government [COG].--In fiscal year 1999 the Committee funded an alternate crisis management/relocation facility to carry on essential Department of Justice functions in the event the Department, or one of its components, is denied access to its current facilities for various reasons, such as a terrorist act. The Committee directs the Department of Justice to coordinate its emergency plan with all other agencies at the relocation facility through established COG channels. The Committee believes there needs to be a process in place for agencies to coordinate problems and issues relative to the overall operations of the alternate crisis management facility, and the Committee expects the Department will work with the other agencies at the facility in the development of a comprehensive emergency plan, which would clearly identify and delineate command and control structures. The Committee recognizes the relocation facility is not under the direct control of the Justice Department, but also understands that facility control could be shared or relinquished depending upon the crisis situation to be managed. With the numerous agencies present at this facility, the Committee believes its successful utilization, in a crisis situation, is dependent upon interagency cooperation and a common emergency plan. The Committee directs the Department to consult with the other agencies located at the facility and report on efforts to identify interagency needs and requirements and how the requirements and actions of other agencies may effect the Department of Justice operations at the facility, as soon as possible. Research activities.--The Committee recommendation includes $30,000,000 for the creation of two counterterrorism laboratories which are being created to research new technologies and threat reduction. These laboratories should work in coordination with each other, the FBI, and the Department of Defense. The purpose of these laboratories is to provide the National Domestic Preparedness Office with needed research on chemical and biological weapons as well as cyber- warfare. The laboratories shall be located at the site of the Oklahoma City bombing and at Dartmouth College. Improving State and local response capabilities.--These programs have been moved to the Office of Justice Programs' Justice Assistance Account, where direct funding is provided. Cyberterrorism.--The Committee understands that today our U.S. economy and even our continuing national security is heavily reliant on a vast array of interdependent and critical infrastructures. The Report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in October 1997 and Presidential Decision Directive No. 63, released in May 1998, call for an unprecedented level of cooperation among U.S. Federal law enforcement agencies, national security entities and the private sector to reduce the threat of information age crime, terrorism and cyber attack. The Committee strongly encourages and expects all Federal agencies to cooperate to the full extent of their authorities and expertise in the response planning, prevention, detection, deterrence, and elimination of vulnerabilities to these critical infrastructures. The Committee further encourages all Federal entities to ensure that resources required to protect critical infrastructures and pursue information age criminals and terrorists are given a high priority within respective programs and initiatives. Finally, the Committee is aware that there are carryover balances available in excess of $24,618,000. The Committee directs the Department of Justice to continue to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees prior to obligation of all counterterrorism funds. Telecommunications Carrier Compliance Fund Appropriations, 1999.................................................... Budget estimate, 2000................................... $15,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 15,000,000 The Committee recommendation includes $15,000,000 for the telecommunications carrier compliance fund. The request included $15,000,000 to reimburse equipment manufacturers and telecommunications support services for implementation of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA]. The Committee continues to recognize the need for law enforcement to retain its ability to use court authorized electronic intercepts in the rapidly growing digital telecommunications environment. At the same time, the Committee is concerned that the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the telecommunications industry have been unable after nearly 5 years of discussions and negotiations to resolve differences regarding compliance with CALEA. On March 27, 1998, the Attorney General filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] advising that the industry's interim technical standard was deficient. The standard was unacceptable because it did not properly address law enforcement requirements that the Department of Justice and the FBI maintain are essential for meeting evidentiary and minimization requirements dictated by law. The Committee notes that $102,580,270 is available in the fund to begin reimbursing industry once an agreement is reached. Administrative Review and Appeals Appropriations, 1999.................................... $134,563,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 149,152,000 Committee recommendation................................ 89,978,000 The Committee recommends $89,978,000 for fiscal year 2000 for administrative review and appeals, of which $59,251,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust fund. The recommendation is $44,585,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $59,174,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The recommendation assumes that $49,741,000 in funds from the Immigration and Naturalization Service ``immigration examinations fee'' account will be made available for Executive Office for Immigration Review [EOIR] operations. Exam fees may be used for expenses in providing immigration adjudication. The EOIR includes the Board of Immigration Appeals, immigration judges, and administrative law judges who decide through administrative hearings whether to admit or exclude aliens seeking to enter the country, and whether to deport or adjust the status of aliens whose status has been challenged. This account also funds the Office of the Pardon Attorney which receives, investigates, and considers petitions for all forms of executive clemency. The recommendation provides $138,119,000 for the EOIR and $1,600,000 for the Office of the Pardon Attorney. The reduction in this account is made without prejudice. Office of Inspector General Appropriations, 1999.................................... $35,610,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 45,021,000 Committee recommendation................................ 32,049,000 The Committee recommends $32,049,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the Office of Inspector General. This recommendation is $3,561,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $12,972,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. U.S. Parole Commission salaries and expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $7,400,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 8,527,000 Committee recommendation................................ 7,176,000 This Commission is an independent body within the Department of Justice which makes decisions regarding requests for parole and supervision of Federal prisoners. The Committee recommends $7,176,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the Parole Commission. The recommendation is $224,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $1,351,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Parole Commission is scheduled to be phased out in 2002 as a result of the creation of sentencing guidelines. Last year, the Commission received a funding increase of almost 50 percent over the previous year to cover costs associated with absorption of cases from the District of Columbia. Having successfully completed that transition, the Committee recommendation ensures timely close out of the Commission's operations. The Committee is aware that the caseload per Commissioner had dropped to its lowest levels ever in the last few years. This is true even with several slots unfilled. The addition of prisoners from the District of Columbia will do no more than restore Commissioner caseload to levels handled at the beginning of the decade. Therefore, the Committee has included a provision in the bill limiting the number of Commissioners to the current three to focus limited resources on necessary staff. The Committee commends the Commission on the smooth absorption of District of Columbia caseload. Legal Activities general legal activities Appropriations, 1999.................................... $475,000,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 576,871,000 Committee recommendation................................ 485,000,000 This appropriation funds the establishment of litigation policy, conduct of litigation, and various other legal responsibilities, through the Office of the Solicitor General, the Tax Division, the Criminal Division, the Civil Division, the Environmental and Natural Resources Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Office of Legal Counsel, Interpol, and the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices. The Committee recommends $485,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for general legal activities, of which $185,740,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust fund. The total recommendation is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $91,871,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The reduction in this account is done without prejudice. Within available resources, the Committee directs the divisions to redouble efforts on hate crimes and domestic terrorism. No funds are provided for tobacco litigation or the Joint Center for Strategic Environmental Enforcement. Winstar.--Winstar describes the over 130 breach of contract suits against the Government that resulted from capital reserve requirement and accounting changes mandated by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act [FIRREA]. Winstar cases have an estimated total liability of as much as $32,000,000,000. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $7,627,000 for Winstar, the full amount requested. Office of Special Investigations.--The Office of Special Investigations [OSI] is responsible for originating, investigating, and prosecuting all denaturalization and deportation cases against Nazi war criminals. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $7,763,000 for the OSI. The $2,000,000 increase over the fiscal year 1999 level will allow the OSI to maintain the pace of prosecutions against Nazi war criminals. It also expands efforts to uncover records on Japanese war criminals, especially those involved in germ warfare and other experiments on human subjects as members of the notorious Unit 731. Superfund litigation.--Corporations that produced war goods during World Wars I and II are attempting to shift the costs for cleaning up contaminated wartime manufacturing sites from themselves to the Government in suits filed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 [CERCLA]. The total liability of the cases filed is estimated at $2,200,000,000. Additional cases are a distinct possibility. That most wartime Federal agencies are defunct, and most successor agencies disinterested, complicates the Government's defense. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $3,088,000 for CERCLA defensive litigation. Vessel pollution.--The intentional discharge of oil and other pollutants from vessels in U.S. coastal and inland waterways is a widespread problem. Justice Department lawyers and investigators, in cooperation with the Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Transportation, have undertaken an initiative to better enforce current clean water laws. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $565,000 for vessel pollution prosecutions, including up to $250,000 for automated litigation support. Chlorofluorocarbon smuggling.--The ban on the use of chlorofluorocarbons [CFC's] in the United States has created a thriving black market trade in freon and halon. Russia, China, and India are exploiting the wide use of older, CFC-dependent air-conditioners and fire suppression systems to supply illegal importers. Justice Department lawyers, cooperating with U.S. Customs and the Environmental Protection Agency, have targeted smuggling rings in coastal and border States. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $262,000 for CFC smuggling prosecutions, including up to $250,000 for automated litigation support. Interagency Law Enforcement.--The fiscal year 2000 budget request dismantles the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account, which funds nine Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces [OCDETF], and distributes OCDETF funds to various Justice components, undermining Congressional efforts to have Justice agencies cooperate on complex, long-term, high value investigations. The Committee recommendation transfers $894,000 from General Legal Activities to the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account to ensure the long-term effectiveness of these multi-agency task forces. Center for Sex Offender Management.--The Committee directs the Center for Sex Offender Management, in coordination with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, to develop a training initiative for local law enforcement that will provide uniform policies in notifying communities about the release of sex offenders. The Justice Management Division is directed to submit a reprogramming, if necessary, to the Committees on Appropriations to fund this effort. the national childhood vaccine injury act Appropriations, 1999.................................... $4,028,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 4,028,000 Committee recommendation................................ 4,028,000 The Committee recommends a reimbursement of $4,028,000 for fiscal year 2000 from the vaccine injury compensation trust fund to cover Justice Department expenses associated with litigating cases under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. The recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and the fiscal year 2000 request. Antitrust Division salaries and expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $98,275,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 114,373,000 Committee recommendation................................ 112,318,000 The Antitrust Division investigates potential violations of Federal antitrust laws, represents the interests of the United States in cases brought under these laws, acts on antitrust cases before the Supreme Court, and reviews decisions of regulatory commissions relating to antitrust law. The Committee recommendation assumes a total of $112,318,000 in budget (obligational) authority for fiscal year 2000 for the Antitrust Division. The recommendation is $14,043,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $2,055,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The entire amount provided will be derived from anticipated offsetting fee collections in fiscal year 2000. U.S. Attorneys salaries and expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $1,090,378,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 1,274,788,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,089,478,000 This account supports the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys [EOUSA] and the 94 U.S. attorneys offices throughout the United States and its territories. The U.S. attorneys serve as the principal litigators for the U.S. Government for criminal and civil matters. The Committee recommends a total of $1,089,478,000 in fiscal year 2000 for U.S. attorneys, of which $500,000,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust fund. The recommendation is $900,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $185,310,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. Much of the reduction from the request is attributable to the restoration of the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account and delays associated with fiscal year 1999 initiatives, described below. As in the past, Committee recommendations focus the efforts of the U.S. Attorneys on those crimes where the unique resources, expertise, or jurisdiction of the Federal Government can, or must, be most effective. Firearms prosecutions.--Multi-agency task forces in Richmond and Boston designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals by enforcing Federal gun laws are credited with slashing violent crime rates in those cities. In response, the fiscal year 1999 Conference Report included $2,300,000 to expand the effort to include Philadelphia and Camden. Building upon continuing success, the Committee recommendation more than quadruples the Administration's request by providing $25,000,000 out of available resources and manpower ceilings to expand the existing ``Exile program'' in Philadelphia, PA and Camden, NJ and to create new task forces in four crime corridors: Las Cruces--Albuquerque, NM; Savannah, GA-- Charleston, SC; Denver, CO--Salt Lake City, UT; and Baltimore-- Prince George's County, MD. Child support enforcement.--The Committee is aware that an estimated $34,000,000,000 in child support payments will have gone unpaid by fiscal year 2000. Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee recommendation provides a total of $5,000,000 for child support enforcement as requested by the Administration. U.S. attorneys should consider cross- referencing their files with those of the national child support clearinghouse and the U.S. trustees to help identify deadbeat parents. The Committee expects to receive a spending plan from the EOUSA prior to the release of these funds. Civil defensive litigation.--Federal civil defensive litigation is unique in that it is non-discretionary and non- delegable. U.S. attorneys offices cannot employ declination criteria to manage or reduce civil defensive caseload. All cases filed against the Government, its agencies, and employees in their official capacities must be defended. The Committee agrees with the U.S. attorneys that this neglected priority can no longer be ignored. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes a provision designating that not less than 2,107 positions and 2,171 full-time equivalents be dedicated to civil and civil defensive litigation as requested by the Administration. The Committee expects to receive an action plan on the use of these resources not later than February 15, 2000. Courtroom technology.--U.S. attorneys have been experimenting with portable, off-the-shelf video and computer equipment for courtroom proceedings. The attorneys found that the equipment substantially improved the presentation of evidence, as well as rapidly accelerating the pace of trials. Users found that they saved the equivalent of one trial day in every five using video and computer equipment. Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee recommendation provides $2,612,000 for a courtroom technology pilot program involving 10 districts, including Colorado, the northern district of Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Vermont. The Committee urges the EOUSA to exploit opportunities created by attrition to add technical staff and further expand the pilot program, if possible. The Committee expects the EOUSA to report to the Committees on Appropriations on its courtroom technology efforts not later than February 1, 2000. Legal education.--Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee recommendation provides $15,015,000 for legal education at the National Advocacy Center [NAC] as requested by the Administration. In addition, also within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $2,300,000 to establish a distance learning facility at the NAC. NAC State and local training funds are provided under the Office of Justice Programs. Cybercrime.--Last year, the Conference Report made available $3,630,000 for cybercrime prosecutions. In large part due to the cumbersome management structure of the U.S. attorneys, cybercrime teams have yet to be formed. Lacking a basis upon which to judge the success or failure of this initiative, the Committee has deferred providing additional cybercrime resources until funds provided last year are expended. Indian country.--As with cybercrime, the U.S. Attorneys are still struggling to meet direction included in the fiscal year 1999 Conference Report. The Committee urges the U.S. Attorneys to move as quickly as possible to redirect resources toward the restoration of the rule of law on Indian reservations. The U.S. Attorneys should coordinate their Indian country initiative with that of the FBI. Violent crime task forces.--Last year, the Conferees provided $1,000,000 to broaden the mission of a violent crime task force to include investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of Internet sexual exploitation of children. The Committee recommends an additional $1,000,000 within available resources to continue and expand this effort under the auspices of Operation Streetsweeper. These funds should be provided to facilitate all aspects, phases, and stages of Internet child exploitation prosecutions. Redeployment of resources.--The current organizational structure of the U.S. Attorneys has hampered their ability to respond quickly and effectively both to changing crime patterns and to Congressional direction. To improve flexibility and responsiveness, the EOUSA has begun using temporary assignments to saturate areas experiencing sudden changes in the quality or quantity of crimes being committed. The Committee endorses the EOUSA's approach and directs that all new hires be 2-year term appointments. Spending decreases.--The Committee is alarmed by spending increases across object classes as high as 102 percent from fiscal years 1995 through 1999. These rates, far in excess of inflation, cannot be sustained. The Committee recommendation freezes spending at last year's level, with one exception. The exception is the elimination of base funding for unstaffed offices. The EOUSA is directed to negotiate cost-free reciprocal sharing arrangements with local law enforcement for office space in cities where federal court may, on occasion, convene. Interagency Law Enforcement.--The fiscal year 2000 budget request dismantles the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account, which funds nine Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces [OCDETFs], and distributes OCDETF funds to participating Justice Department components, undermining efforts to have Justice Department agencies cooperate on complex, long-term, high value investigations. The Committee recommendation transfers $83,277,000 from the U.S. Attorneys to the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account to ensure the long-term effectiveness of these multi-agency task forces. Federal Prisoner Detention.--In many instances, local law enforcement has turned cooperative agreements with the Federal Government for jailing pre-trial and pre-sentencing Federal detainees from a reimbursement for cost agreement into a source of profit. The Committee believes that it is in the best interest of States and localities that the accused be held, but also recognizes that the fees charged by local jurisdictions have, in many cases, exhausted Federal resources. Federal prosecutors are urged to explore all other avenues to pre-trial detention for non-violent defendants, particularly in high cost areas. As an incentive, the Committee recommendation includes a transfer provision that makes available up to $20,000,000 to cover federal prisoner detention costs. District of Columbia.--The election of the new Mayor of the District of Columbia has prompted a rush to restore ``home rule'' to the District. In support of this, the Committee directs the EOUSA, in full cooperation with the Mayor's Office, to develop a plan for the transition of duties and responsibilities from the D.C. U.S. Attorneys Office to appropriate city agencies. The plan shall be delivered to the Committees on Appropriations not later than May 1, 2000 and implementation of the plan shall begin not later than August 1, 2000. u.s. trustee system fund Appropriations, 1999.................................... $114,248,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 129,329,000 Committee recommendation................................ 112,775,000 The U.S. trustee system provides administrative support to expeditiously move bankruptcy cases through the bankruptcy process and ensures accountability of private trustees appointed to administer bankruptcy estates. This system was authorized in Public Law 99-554, the Bankruptcy Judges, U.S. Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986, which established a U.S. trustee system fund in the U.S. Treasury and provided for the collection of fees into the fund to finance program operations. The Committee recommends a total of $112,775,000 in budget authority for fiscal year 2000 for the U.S. trustees. The recommendation is $1,473,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $16,554,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee has not adopted the proposed increase in bankruptcy fees and has adjusted the ``annualization of 1999 pay raise'' to correct an erroneous assumption. Without a fee increase, which the Committee hopes will be addressed in pending bankruptcy legislation, the Trustees will face another year of austerity. The Committee recommendation includes $500,000 to establish a Bankruptcy Training Center at the National Advocacy Center, an initiative proposed last year that could not be acted upon due to a shortfall in fee receipts. The Committee will consider automation upgrades as part of the reprogramming process should funds become available. All other proposed initiatives are denied. The Committee expects the trustees to use available resources and directs the trustees to submit a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations not later than December 31, 1999. foreign claims settlement commission Appropriations, 1999.................................... $1,227,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 1,175,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,175,000 The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission settles claims of American citizens arising from nationalization, expropriation, or other takings of their properties and interests by foreign governments. The Committee recommends $1,175,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The recommendation is $52,000 below the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and is identical to the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee recommendation fully provides for the adjudication of claims against: Germany relating to World War II; Cuba relating to the Castro regime; and Iraq relating to the U.S.S. Stark incident and Desert Shield/Storm. U.S. Marshals Service salaries and expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $502,609,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 569,590,000 Committee recommendation................................ 547,253,000 The U.S. Marshals Service is made up of 94 offices with the responsibility for the protection of the Federal judiciary, protection of witnesses, execution of warrants and court orders, and the custody and transportation of unsentenced prisoners. The Committee recommends $547,253,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the U.S. Marshals Service, of which $138,000,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust fund. The recommendation is $44,644,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $22,337,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee recommendation provides most of the requested base adjustments for this account. The recommendation also includes a $512,000 increase for staff to implement and support a variety of cost-reduction initiatives. This amount includes 6 senior systems administrators for the following locations: Honolulu, HI; Boise, ID; Concord, NH; Scranton, PA; Hato Rey, PR; and Charleston, WV. Courthouse Security Personnel.--The Committee is aware that a significant share of Marshals Service manpower is dedicated to the service of process. The Committee is also aware that in all but the rarest of circumstances using a trained Marshal to serve papers is a gross misuse of an expensive law enforcement asset. Therefore, the Committee has included a provision in the bill prohibiting the use of funds for service of process except in the most extraordinary circumstances. The manpower freed up by this prohibition shall be used to augment existing judicial protection and court security missions. Additional staff, if required, should be drawn from personnel available for reassignment due to the defederalization of District of Columbia Superior Court operations, depending upon the progress of that initiative. Courthouse security equipment.--The Committee recommendation provides $13,750,000 for courthouse security equipment. This equipment will outfit newly opening courthouses in the following locations: USMS Courthouse Security Equipment [In thousands of dollars] Committee Detainee Facilities New Construction recommendation Omaha, NE......................................................... 1,000 Hammond, IN....................................................... 866 Covington, KY..................................................... 161 Charleston, WV.................................................... 100 Montgomery, AL.................................................... 1,130 Tucson, AZ........................................................ 846 Phoenix, AZ....................................................... 861 Charleston, SC.................................................... 379 Albany, NY........................................................ 478 Los Angeles, CA................................................... 256 Sioux City, IA.................................................... 264 Pocatello, ID..................................................... 15 Agana, Guam....................................................... 781 Islip, NY......................................................... 1,783 St. Louis, MO..................................................... 1,754 Kansas City, MO................................................... 450 Las Vegas, NV..................................................... 900 Albuquerque, NM................................................... 200 Riverside, CA..................................................... 436 Corpus Christi, TX................................................ 1,090 ______ Total, USMS Security Equipment..............................13,750 The Committee has provided this funding even though it has grave misgivings about the movement of funding between projects in this subaccount. The Committee expects to be consulted prior to any deviation from the above plan for fiscal year 2000. Contract officers.--The Committee is concerned that contract officers, originally a temporary expedient, are becoming a permanent adjunct to the Marshals Service. Lacking uniform, and, in some cases, even basic training, contract officers are increasingly ill-prepared to deal with an ever more violent and ruthless Federal prisoner population in courtroom, prisoner handling, and lock-up settings. A lack of training and experience is apt to result in contract officers being reduced to bystanders or victims during outbreaks of violence. Therefore, the Committee has included a provision prohibiting the use of funds for contract officers, except for prisoner ground transport, service of process, and evictions. Base resources in the request designated for contract officers shall instead be used to augment the number of deputy U.S. Marshals or detention enforcement officers. Fugitive apprehensions.--At any given moment, 25,000 to 30,000 fugitives are prowling America's streets. With nothing to lose, these fugitives are particularly prone to violent crime. By providing support to all levels of law enforcement, the Marshals' electronic surveillance unit [ESU] is a significant force multiplier in the effort to apprehend dangerous fugitives. The Committee recommendation provides an increase of $5,200,000 over the fiscal year 2000 request for the ESU, including funding for surveillance vans, telephone and bucket trucks, body wire/recorder systems, dialed number recorders, digital cellular tracking systems, and video systems. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes $1,900,000 to continue and expand the Marshals' subscription to credit bureau and personal and commercial property on-line services and $600,000 to continue the Carribbean task force. Threat analysis.--The Marshals' Analytical Support Unit [ASU] analyzes and assesses every threat made against federal judicial officials. The Committee is aware of a proposal to expand the reach of the ASU to include threats made against State and local officials as part of the PROJUST feasibility study. The Committee directs the Marshals to conduct a pilot program similar to the plan submitted to the Committee on March 26, 1999. Videoconferencing.--The Committee is aware that videoconferencing generates savings and improves public safety. The Committee recommendation provides $500,000 for the acquisition and installation of videoconferencing equipment in the following locations: Leavenworth, KS; Dawson County, NE; Las Vegas, NV; Charlotte, NC; and high-volume jail locations to be determined in New Mexico and elsewhere. The Committee expects to be consulted prior to the final determination of the installation sites. Spending decreases.--The Committee recommendation does not include ``base shortfall'' funding. The Committee does not recognize the concept of ``base resources''. It does, however, recognize that Congressional and Presidential approval of a given appropriation bill represents the totality of funds available to an agency in a given fiscal year, short a reprogramming, rescission or supplemental. If the Marshals have unfunded requirements, it is incumbent upon them to present these to the Committee as new initiatives to be properly scrutinized and prioritized. Interagency Law Enforcement.--The fiscal year 2000 budget request dismantles the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account, which funds nine Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces [OCDETF], and distributes OCDETF funds to various Justice components, undermining efforts to have Justice Department agencies cooperate on complex, long-term, high value investigations. The Committee recommendation transfers $1,942,000 from the U.S. Marshals Service to the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account to ensure the long-term effectiveness of these multi-agency task forces. District of Columbia.--The election of the new Mayor of the District of Columbia has prompted a rush to restore ``home rule'' to the District. In support of this, the Committee directs the U.S. Marshals Service, in full cooperation with the Mayor's Office, to develop a plan for the transition of duties and responsibilities associated with the operation of D.C. Superior Court from the Marshals Service to appropriate city agencies. The plan shall be delivered to the Committees on Appropriations not later than May 1, 2000 and implementation of the plan shall begin not later than August 1, 2000. Construction Appropriations, 1999.................................... $4,600,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 8,832,000 Committee recommendation................................ 9,632,000 The Committee recommends $9,632,000 for fiscal year 2000 for construction projects. The recommendation is $5,032,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $800,000 above the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee is aware that a recently-conducted national survey of federal courthouses revealed that 95 percent of prisoner holding and transit facilities have serious security deficiencies. Of 392 courthouses surveyed: 84 percent lack enough courtroom holding cells; 78 percent do not have secure prison elevators; 74 percent do not have enclosed sallyports; 72 percent lack enough interview rooms; 57 percent do not have adequate cellblock space; and 38 percent lack cameras, monitors, and alarms. Years of neglect have created this deplorable situation, posing risks to the judicial family, the public, and the Marshals themselves. The Committee recommendations by project are displayed in the following table: USMS Construction [In thousands of dollars] Committee Detainee Facilities Renovation recommendation Fairbanks, AK..................................................... 300 Prescott, AZ...................................................... 125 Atlanta, GA....................................................... 600 Moscow, ID........................................................ 185 Chicago, IL....................................................... 800 Rockford, IL...................................................... 250 Louisville, KY.................................................... 350 Detroit, MI....................................................... 515 Las Cruces, NM.................................................... 275 Greensboro, NC.................................................... 725 Muskogee, OK...................................................... 650 Pittsburgh, PA.................................................... 550 Florence, SC...................................................... 625 Spartanburg, SC................................................... 800 Columbia, TN...................................................... 250 Beaumont, TX...................................................... 450 Sherman, TX....................................................... 850 Cheyenne, WY...................................................... 500 Security Specialists/Construction Engineers....................... 832 ______ Total, USMS Construction.................................... 9,632 The Committee considers this the first step in reducing the backlog of critical security-related projects. As with courthouse security equipment, the Committee expects to be consulted prior to any deviation from the above plan. Justice prisoner and alien transportation system Appropriations, 1999.................................................... Budget estimate, 2000................................................... Committee recommendation................................ $9,000,000 This account capitalizes a limited revolving fund making prisoner air transportation operations and maintenance self- financing. Aircraft procurement, facilities, and prisoner ground transportation will continue to require appropriated funds. Customer costs will continue to be reflected in the separate agency requests. The Committee recommends $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the justice prisoner and alien transportation system [JPATS]. The recommendation is $9,000,000 above both the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee is aware that the Marshals discovered a shortfall in the JPATS account too late to have it properly addressed in the fiscal year 2000 request. Aside from concerns about the Marshals' management of their budget, the Committee continues to be concerned by a revolving fund that only partially funds operations, does not fund capital investments, and requires yearly augmentation. By any other name, this would be an annual appropriation. JMD is directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the financial requirements to establish a proper revolving fund that fully capitalizes operations, aircraft, and facilities. The report should be delivered not later than March 1, 2000. In addition, JMD is directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the availability of surplus Defense Department aircraft that could fill JPATS requirements. That report should also be delivered not later than March 1, 2000 and then quarterly thereafter. Federal prisoner detention Appropriations, 1999.................................... $425,000,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 550,232,000 Committee recommendation................................ 500,000,000 Under this program, the U.S. marshals contract with State and local jails and private facilities to house unsentenced Federal prisoners for short periods of time. This is usually before and during trial and while awaiting transfer to Federal institutions after conviction. The Committee recommends $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for Federal prisoner detention. The recommendation is $75,000,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $50,232,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The recommendation reflects a refined estimate of requirements based on an extrapolation of actual obligation rates and should fully fund Federal prisoner detention. As an added safeguard, the Committee recommendation includes provisions in the bill that makes up to $35,000,000 available for transfer to this account from ``U.S. Attorneys, Salaries and Expenses'' and ``Fees and Expenses of Witnesses''. Last year, an exploding Federal detainee population created a serious shortfall in this account. The Committee recommendation attempts to balance available funds against the claim for resources made by this account. As mentioned elsewhere, the Committee is concerned that local law enforcement has turned cooperative agreements with the Federal Government for jailing pre-trial and pre-sentencing Federal detainees from a reimbursement for cost into a source of profit. The Committee believes that it is in the best interest of States and localities that the accused be held, but also recognizes that the fees charged by local jurisdictions have, in many cases, exhausted Federal resources. The Committee recommendation includes additional personnel under the Marshals ``Salaries and Expenses'' account to pursue cost reduction initiatives. The Committee has also included a provision in the bill that should reduce the cost of medical care for federal detainees. The Marshals are directed to report quarterly to the Committees on Appropriations on their progress in achieving savings in this account. The Committee has also been informed that the sentencing phase of Federal cases averages 9 months. This is an intolerably slow pace. The Committee directs the U.S. Marshals, in cooperation with the EOUSA, JMD, and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, to report on the causes of sentencing delays and to provide recommendations for expediting the sentencing process. The report should be delivered no later than March 15, 2000. fees and expenses of witnesses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $95,000,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 110,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 110,000,000 This account provides for fees and expenses of witnesses who appear on behalf of the Government in cases in which the United States is a party, including fact and expert witnesses. These funds are also used for mental competency examinations as well as witness and informant protection. The Committee recommends $110,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for fees and expenses of witnesses. The recommendation is $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and identical to the fiscal year 2000 request. No funds are provided for expert witnesses called to provide testimony in tobacco litigation. To improve financial management, the Committee recommendation includes a provision in the bill that makes up to $15,000,000 available for transfer to the ``Federal Prisoner Detention'' account. community relations service Appropriations, 1999.................................... $7,199,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 10,344,000 Committee recommendation................................ 7,199,000 The Community Relations Service [CRS] provides assistance to communities and persons in the prevention and resolution of disagreements relating to perceived discriminatory practices. The Committee recommends $7,199,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the Community Relations Service. The recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $3,145,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee questions the ability of such a small operation to absorb the steep increases provided, or proposed, for CRS over the last few years. The fiscal year 1999 appropriation for CRS was 35 percent higher than the previous year. The fiscal year 2000 request calls for a 44 percent increase. Such increases leave CRS vulnerable to instances of waste, fraud, and abuse. The Committee notes that almost $1,000,000 of the amount provided in fiscal year 1999 was for non-recurring costs. Therefore, a freeze at last year's level provides $1,000,000 available to annualize fiscal year 1999 staff increases. The Committee will consider additional increases in fiscal year 2001, if merited. The Committee is concerned about the possibility that unauthorized solicitation of city officials nationwide may be occurring, and is further concerned of what the implications of this practice may mean. The Committee therefore directs the Justice Management Division to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations 90 days after enactment of this Act, investigating whether such solicitation is in fact occurring, the legality of such solicitations, to what extent such solicitation is occurring, and Justice's plan with respect to disciplinary actions and to ending said practice. assets forfeiture fund Appropriations, 1999.................................... $23,000,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 23,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 23,000,000 This account provides funds to supplement existing resources to cover additional investigative expenses of the FBI, DEA, INS, and U.S. marshals, such as awards for information, purchase of evidence, equipping of conveyances, and investigative expenses leading to seizure. Funds for these activities are provided from receipts deposited in the assets forfeiture fund resulting from the forfeiture of assets. Expenses related to the management and disposal of assets are also provided from the assets forfeiture fund by a permanent indefinite appropriation. The Committee recommends $23,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for the assets forfeiture fund. The recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and the fiscal year 2000 request. Radiation Exposure Compensation administrative expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $2,000,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 2,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 2,000,000 This program was established to permit the payment of claims to individuals exposed to radiation as a result of atmospheric nuclear tests and uranium mining in accordance with the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990. The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 to handle claims and litigation arising from the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and the fiscal year 2000 request. payment to the radiation exposure compensation trust fund Appropriations, 1999.................................................... Budget estimate, 2000................................... $21,714,000 Committee recommendation................................ 20,300,000 This account funds payments to approved claimants under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990. The Committee recommends $20,300,000 for fiscal year 2000 for payments under the Radiation Compensation Act. The recommendation is $20,300,000 above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $1,414,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Administration's fiscal year 2000 request was predicated on the passage of legislation that increased both the amount of payments to qualifying individuals and the number of categories of claimants. The proposed legislation has not been acted on and future passage is uncertain. The Committee understands that the $3,100,000 in carryover available to the fund, when combined with the recommended amount, will be adequate to cover payments in fiscal year 2000. Interagency Law Enforcement Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement Appropriations, 1999.................................... $304,014,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 315,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 304,014,000 The Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement Program, through its 9 regional task forces, utilizes the combined resources and expertise of its 11 member Federal agencies, in cooperation with State and local investigators and prosecutors, to target and destroy major narcotics trafficking and money laundering organizations. The fiscal year 2000 request dismantles this account. The Committee recommendation retains the account in its current form and provides $304,014,000 for fiscal year 2000 for interagency crime and drug enforcement. The recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and $10,986,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. The Committee directs the Executive Office of the Interagency Law Enforcement Agency to use $1,700,000 in carryover funding for its fiscal year 2000 reimbursements to participating agencies. The Committee is also concerned about the ability of the U.S. Marshals Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to participate in these investigations and, therefore, recommends no less than $1,834,000 and $15,286,000, respectively, to be available to them for fiscal year 2000 investigations. Federal Bureau of Investigation Appropriations, 1999.................................... $2,971,448,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 3,293,664,000 Committee recommendation................................ 2,983,579,000 The Committee recommendation provides $2,983,579,000 in budgetary resources for Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] operations for fiscal year 2000. This amount includes $10,287,000 for construction, $260,000,000 in defense discretionary funding for counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and national security activities, and $280,501,000 from the violent crime reduction trust fund. This operating level is $12,131,000 above the appropriation for fiscal year 1999 and $310,085,000 below the fiscal year 2000 request. Much of the reduction from the request is attributable to the restoration of the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account and the delay of a fiscal year 1999 initiative, described below. Salaries And Expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $2,970,161,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 3,283,377,000 Committee recommendation................................ 2,973,292,000 The Committee recommendation provides $2,973,292,000 in salaries and expenses for FBI operations for fiscal year 2000. This level includes funding for the following requested initiatives: Chinese espionage at Federal laboratories.--The passing of ultra-sensitive secrets to China by an employee of Los Alamos National Laboratory is only the latest episode in a longstanding campaign by Chinese intelligence services to penetrate Department of Energy [DoE] laboratories. Lax security at the laboratories has abetted the work of spies. The Committee believes counterintelligence and security at DoE laboratories would be handled best by the FBI. The Committee directs that not less than 60 agents be reassigned as soon as possible to field offices in Albuquerque, Knoxville, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Washington to augment the existing foreign counterintelligence capabilities in these locations. The Committee expects the DoE to fully reimburse the FBI for the incremental costs the agency incurs undertaking this new responsibility. Field Computer Crime/Intrusion Squads.--Traffic on the Internet continues to rise, yet security controls remain inadequate. As a result, the information superhighway has become an avenue for embezzlement, fraud, theft, sabotage, espionage, hate crimes, and pornography. The Committee views field computer crime/intrusion squads as highly trained ``flying squads'', evenly distributed, but deployable as necessary, to support joint investigations involving field offices. The intensive continuing education and training required to develop and maintain cybercrime expertise necessarily limits the number of personnel on squads to an elite cadre of computer specialists. The Committee expects central headquarters to develop promotion opportunities that will reward a career-long commitment to computer crime/ intrusion squads and to provide sufficient training and travel funds to ensure existing squads are robust. The Committee urges the FBI to submit a reprogramming request should the funding available to existing squads for equipment, supplies, and technology upgrades prove inadequate. Computer Analysis & Response Team [CART] Program.--CART examiners extract data from computer and network systems for use in FBI investigations. Using existing base resources already dedicated to CART examiners in the field, the FBI is directed to convert its 95 part-time examiners into 62 full- time examiners. The result would be a 20 percent increase in CART workyears. The Committee believes that the complexity of computer forensic examinations necessitates continuing education for examiners to allow them to remain current with the latest advances in the highly volatile information technology field. This, in turn, demands dedicated personnel whose career track allows them to specialize for extended periods, if not permanently, in this highly technical field. As with field computer crime/intrusion squads, the siting of CART personnel should maximize regional coverage. Also, the Committee expects central headquarters to allocate sufficient travel funds to allow examiners to support field offices lacking on-hand specialists. The Committee recommendation includes an increase of $3,399,000 over the fiscal year 1999 level for training, equipment, supplies, and technology upgrades. The Committee expects the FBI to deliver a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations prior to the release of these funds. Digital Storm.--The Committee commends the FBI's laboratory for developing capabilities to keep pace with systems and countermeasures deployed by targets of investigations. This is being done while they maintain the capacity to exploit information already collected in a timely manner. Digital technology is providing new opportunities in data collection. The Committee understands that an additional $500,000 of base funding is requested for fiscal year 2000. An additional $5,000,000 is provided for this effort. National Infrastructure Protection Center.--The National Infrastructure Protection Center [NIPC] serves as the central clearinghouse for threats and warnings or actual cyber-attacks on critical public and private infrastructures. The Committee recommendation provides $25,392,000 for the NIPC, of which $1,250,000 is for a national program for infrastructure assurance developed in cooperation with the Thayer School of Engineering. The entire amount for the NIPC is to be derived out of available resources and manpower ceilings from this account. Claims upon the Attorney General's ``counterterrorism fund'' should be limited to reimbursements associated with events of an extraordinary nature. Counterterrorism.--The Committee expects the FBI to continue its collaboration with the Southwest Surety Institute. Indian country law enforcement.--The Committee is very disturbed by recent Justice Department statistics that seem to indicate that non-Indian sexual predators are targeting females on Indian reservations. Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee directs the FBI to shift not less than 100 agents to existing Justice Department offices nearest the 10 most vulnerable reservations, including Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River, and Rosebud, SD, and Menominee, WI. Information Sharing Initiative [ISI].--The ISI is a two- pronged effort to modernize the FBI's antiquated information technology infrastructure and to develop advanced software tools to improve the analysis and dissemination of case-related material. Fiscal year 1999 funding for the ISI, the obligation of which was delayed by a Congressionally-directed program review, should sustain initial software development and systems installations through the end of fiscal year 2000. Therefore, the Committee recommendation provides $20,000,000 in base resources for the ISI. The Committee reiterates its support for a pilot that would promote the fastest possible fielding of the capabilities included in modules 3 through 9 to the 10 field offices with the largest caseload. In the meantime, the FBI should study whether consolidation opportunities exist that would speed the deployment of advanced capabilities to the field. To the degree that ISI funding is found to be in excess of needs in fiscal year 2000, the Committee recommends directing available resources to investigative information services, Computer Analysis and Response Teams, and the activation of the FBI laboratory. The Committee expects the FBI to submit a detailed spending plan for the ISI for fiscal year 2000 not later than September 1, 1999. Intelligence.--The Committee is aware that the processing, interpretation, and dissemination of intelligence has been neglected. Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee directs the FBI to ensure that each field office has at least one intelligence operations specialist serving as a collections management officer. Criminal Justice Services.--The Committee recommendation includes $131,066,000 for Criminal Justice Services, excluding the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. National Instant Criminal Background Check System.--The National Instant Criminal Background Check System [NICS] is the immediate source of information for federal firearms licensees seeking to determine whether a given individual's purchase of a firearm would violate federal or State law. The Committee recommendation does not adopt a proposal to establish fees to pay for operation of the NICS. Instead, the Committee provides $104,897,000, the full amount required for NICS, from within available resources and manpower ceilings. The amount provided includes the funds necessary to upgrade the integrated automated fingerprint identification system [IAFIS] to allow for the immediate destruction of the records of gun buyers cleared for purchases and to develop point of sale devices that would allow the largest wholesalers instant access to the NICS. Federal Convicted Offender DNA Database Program.--DNA evidence has revolutionized law enforcement, particularly in the area of sex crimes. Recognizing the high recidivism rate among sex offenders and other violent criminals, the Federal Convicted Offender DNA Database [FCODD] program will establish a central repository of DNA samples from the federal prison population. The Committee recommendation provides $5,336,000 for this new start. Mitochondrial DNA.--The Committee recommendation includes five positions and $2,835,000 for the FBI Laboratory to conduct research and development of the use of mitochondrial DNA to assist law enforcement in the identification of missing and abducted children and other purposes and to operate a missing- persons database as part of the Combined DNA Identification System. The Committee expects the FBI Laboratory to work closely with the NCAVC on the application of mitochondrial-DNA technology as an aid in missing and abducted children investigations. Northern New Mexico Anti-Drug Initiative.--The Committee acknowledges the need for a focused response to illegal drug trafficking in northern New Mexico and expects the FBI to devote sufficient resources to this problem in cooperation with other federal law enforcement agencies. Federal liability.--The Committee has been informed that an unintended consequence of Operation Silver Shovel may have been the lead contamination of several city lots, particularly a site at 76th and Kedzie Avenue, in Chicago, IL. The FBI is directed to report back to the Committees on Appropriations on the following: (1) the circumstances of Operation Silver Shovel, (2) the level of lead contamination at the sites in question that is directly attributable to the operation, (3) the cost of clean-up, and (4) the relative liability of each of the local, State, and Federal agencies involved in the operation. The report should be delivered not later than December 1, 1999. Crimes against children.--The Committee recommendation includes not less than $5,204,000 to maintain the FBI's capabilities to combat child abductions and serial killings. Within this amount, at least $3,439,000 is for: (1) the child abduction and serial killer unit, (2) a police fellows program for training local investigators, and (3) training for State and local law enforcement. Additionally, at least $1,765,000 is recommended to enhance the staffing of the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program to provide more timely assistance to State and local law enforcement requesting case analysis services. National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime [NCAVC].--The Committee recommendation includes 11 positions (4 agents) and $1,232,000 for a classified project being conducted by the NCAVC involving threats to use weapons of mass destruction. Spending decreases.--The Committee is alarmed by spending increases across object classes as high as 83 percent from fiscal years 1995 through 1999. These rates, far in excess of inflation, cannot be sustained. The Committee recommendation freezes spending at last year's level with one exception, described above. In addition, no funding has been provided for the following proposed initiatives: JUMPSTOP, outreach for the National Infrastructure Protection Center [NIPC], cryptanalysis and counter-encryption equipment, laboratory network connectivity, and the civil rights analytical center. JUMPSTOP is a stand alone system that largely replicates some of the capabilities of the Information Sharing Initiative. The NIPC may host federal working groups and regional, State, and local conferences to the degree that it can identify funds out of available resources. Cryptanalysis and counter-encryption efforts duplicate National Security Agency capabilities. The current laboratory network will suffice until higher priority information technology systems are completed. The civil rights analytical center duplicates capabilities resident in the Civil Rights Division. Also, the Committee eliminates funding for furniture and vehicle purchases and includes an undistributed reduction. Finally, the Committee recommendation adopts the staff reductions described in a letter to the Committee dated April 5, 1999 for legal attache and resolution six offices. None of the increases proposed in that letter are provided. Interagency Law Enforcement.--The fiscal year 2000 budget request dismantles the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account, which funds nine Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces [OCDETFs], and distributes OCDETF funds to participating Justice Department components, undermining efforts to have Justice Department agencies cooperate on complex, long-term, high value investigations. The Committee recommendation transfers $113,039,000 from the FBI to the ``Interagency Law Enforcement'' account to ensure the long-term effectiveness of these multi-agency task forces. Schoolbus driver background check.--The Committee is aware that many States require a Federal criminal background check for the hiring of schoolbus drivers, resulting in a seasonal increase in fingerprint submissions. The Committee directs the FBI to allocate sufficient personnel to ensure the timely processing of criminal background checks for schoolbus drivers. Olympic Security.--The Committee is aware of the need for preparations to address security for the coming Olympics in Sidney, Australia. The Committee commends the FBI for the work it is doing with the New South Wales Government, the Sidney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, and the Department of State. The Committee directs that the FBI provide a detailed report on what preparations have been made to address the security of U.S. athletes and spectators and what additional funding may be required. This report should be provided to the Committees on Appropriations no later than October 1, 1999. The Committee directs that a reprogramming be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations for additional funding that is recommended to address these security needs. Construction Appropriations, 1999.................................... $1,287,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 10,287,000 Committee recommendation................................ 10,287,000 The Committee recommends $10,287,000 for FBI construction. This amount is $9,000,000 more than the fiscal year 1999 appropriation and identical to the fiscal year 2000 request. Hazardous devices school.--State and local bomb technicians, not federal officers, are responsible for rendering safe explosive devices in most situations. The Hazardous Devices School certifies bomb technicians and provides a variety of advanced and refresher courses. The Committee recommendation includes $9,000,000 to modernize the school. The Committee directs that top priority be given to ending the practice of conducting ``disruptions'' in otherwise occupied buildings and to developing ranges and other facilities capable of handling the explosive growth in student attendance projected for the foreseeable future. The Committee cautions the FBI to develop an upgrade plan predicated on the assumption that $9,000,000 is all that will be available for school modernization. Drug Enforcement Administration Appropriations, 1999.................................... $1,213,780,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 1,380,242,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,223,146,000 The Committee recommends total budget authority of $1,223,146,000 for the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] for fiscal year 2000. The reduction in this account is largely the result of the Committee's recommendation not to approve the proposed transfer of $103,996,000 from the Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement Fund. The Committee is concerned over the lack of management oversight that has resulted in reporting inconsistencies in DEA's budget, as well as DEA's failure to properly notify the Committees on Appropriations of funding shifts, as required by reprogramming procedures in section 605 of this and previous Appropriations acts. The Committee notes that the DEA has spent much of fiscal year 1999 working to properly realign its resources. The June 1999 reprogramming letter notifying the Committee of the realignment of DEA resources indicates that DEA recognizes the seriousness of its financial management practices, along with the need to accurately report on the use of appropriated funds and to notify Congress promptly when funds are shifted among decision units. The Committee believes it has given DEA sufficient time to address its budgeting deficiencies and expects that the agency will honor its commitment to improve its financial management procedures. Recognizing the importance of combating illegal drug trafficking, the Committee has acted favorably on DEA's requests for resources during years of severe fiscal constraint. However, with that favorable consideration comes an obligation to ensure that funds are used appropriately and in a manner consistent with Congressional intent. Salaries And Expenses Appropriations, 1999.................................... $877,490,000 Budget estimate, 2000................................... 1,055,572,000 Committee recommendation................................ 878,517,000 The Committee recommends total budget authority of $878,517,000 for Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] salaries and expenses for fiscal year 2000, of which $80,330,000 is derived from the diversion control fund, and, in addition, $419,459,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust fund. The Committee recommendation attempts to give DEA the tools it needs to properly wage the war on illegal drugs. In an effort to provide additional DEA agents and personnel, no funding is made available for new vehicle purchases. The Committee recommendation provides funding for the following: Regional drug enforcement teams [RET].--The Committee recommendation includes $22,200,000 for DEA RET teams. Enhancements to this account will enable the DEA to increase personnel by 49 positions (30 agents). Added personnel and resources should be dedicated to locations in the western and central regions of the United States as determined by the DEA and focus primarily on the methamphetamine problems in those geographic regions. RET teams are currently stationed in targeted regions in the United States and have been given the flexibility to deploy agent resources and assets to meet emerging drug trends, specifically in our Nation's smaller cities. The teams direct their efforts toward combating specific drug problems as identified by intelligence sources and leads provided by DEA's Special Operations Division. Mobile enforcement teams [MET].--The Committee recommendation includes $56,700,000 and 39 positions (24 agents) for DEA MET team deployments. MET teams operate in communities at the request of local officials and since 1995 have targeted and dismantled drug trafficking organizations across the United States. The Committee believes that the DEA should increasingly focus personnel and resources on programs which target drug related crime and drug trafficking organizations within the United States. Methamphetamine initiative.--The recommendation includes $27,459,000 to continue DEA's efforts of targeting and investigating methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse across the United States. The funding will allow DEA to continue investigations and stop methamphetamine traffickers; maintain the national clandestine laboratory data base; reduce the availability of precursor chemicals being diverted to clandestine laboratories in the United States and abroad; and clean-up the hazardous waste generated by seized clandestine laboratories. Within the amounts provided, an additional $3,000,000 is made available for the DEA's methamphetamine lab cleanup efforts. The Committee notes that funds for this purpose are also provided to the DEA through the Office of Justice Programs and the DEA's asset forfeiture account. Methamphetamine training initiative.--The Committee recommends that $2,500,000 be provided to the DEA for equipment to train State and local officials to respond to, dismantle, and investigate clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. The Committee encourages the DEA to utilize DEA regional drug enforcement teams in methamphetamine related operations. Heroin Enforcement Strategy.--The statistics for heroin use by teenagers continues to rise. In fact, the use of heroin by twelfth graders has doubled between 1990 and 1996. It appears that many do not understand that sniffing this drug does not change its addictiveness. New Mexico U.S. Attorneys have reported to the Committee that most Black Tar heroin addicts never permanently break the addiction. The Committee recommends $14,926,000 to address this challenge including a $2,000,000 increase above the fiscal year 1999 appropriation. The Committee also directs the Attorney General to report to the Committees on Appropriations on how this funding will be used. This report should be provided and approved before any funds are expended. International counter drug operations.--The Committee recommendation includes $7,500,000 and 27 positions (12 agents) to expand DEA enforcement efforts in Central America and Mexico by enhancing current offices in Belize City, Belize; Managua, Nicaragua; Panama City, Panama; San Jose, Costa Rica; San Salvador, El Salvador; Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and in "
