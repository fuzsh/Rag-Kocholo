        "text": "The purpose of this study is to show the behavior of the air passenger market in Colombia, in terms of concentration, dominance and asymmetry in 2016, considering the variables of operational revenues and passenger transpor‐ tation; using the database provided by the Civil Aeronautics (Colombia). For this purpose, we use the application of the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce designed by [7]. We employ the most representative indicators ratio of concen‐ tration, IHH, Standardized IHH, Entropy, Standardized Entropy, Dominance Index Kwoka, Dominance Indicator, and Gini coefficient. We were able to estab‐ lish, from the two variables used: the market had high levels of concentration, a high degree of heterogeneity in the firms and that there is a firm with a dominant position.\n\nThe International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences 2012 held its 27th meeting in Paris on October 3 and 4, 2012, in the prestigious venue of the Institut Henri Poincaré, after having been held for two successive years (2010 and 2011) at the Royal Society in London. ISCIS 2012 included several invited keynotes and 52 contributed papers that were selected among 81 submissions. The contents of these proceedings reflect a wide range of relevant topics and timely research within Computer Science and Engineering, in line with the objective of the meeting which is to allow the participants, and the readers of these Proceedings, to obtain a snapshot of work in diverse areas and from many different countries. New areas such as energy management in computer systems and net- works, and the use of computer systems to manage energy networks, have recently come to the forefront of research, and these topics are well represented in the Proceedings. Similarly, the security of computer and communication systems is also well-represented in these proceedings, and happens to be one of the most active areas of research. Each submitted paper was refereed by at least two, often three, or four referees, and the acceptance was based on a numerical ranking provided by the referees themselves. We therefore thank the authors of all submitted papers, as well as the referees and the programme committee members for their hard work and contributions. The resulting Proceedings reflect their collective contributions, and the referee comments have not just selected but also undoubtedly improved the papers that are being presented here."
