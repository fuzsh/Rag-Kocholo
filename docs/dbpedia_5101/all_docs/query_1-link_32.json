        "text": "Abstract Income inequality is always being a central concern of economic theory and economic policy. This paper presents the Income inequality; Impacts, measurements and policy implication in Woliso Town. Moreover, the researcher would try to analysis in what way inequalities affect economic development in Woliso town in particular and the countries in general. The general objective of the research was to assess the Income inequality; Impacts, measurements and policy implication in Woliso Town. . And for this research the researcher used simple random sampling techniques. This research also included the finding based on the content of information obtained from dwellers of the town. Hence the researcher found that the difference, the difference in educational level Family size, age, sex and unemployment and other related factors would the cause of Income inequality. In the case of data gathering the researcher used primary data sources from the dwellers of the town by preparing questioners. Beyond this in the case of data analysis the researcher also use descriptive way of data analysis and multiple linear regression models. Finally the researcher would recommend the following “improving the ability, educational status of the society and reducing unemployment and reducing the gap in Income inequality between poor and rich. Key words: Income Inequality, Gini coefficient, Elasticity, multiple linear regressions (OLS) and Woliso, Ethiopia.\n\nIn recent times, the poor performance of students in Biology in Senior School Certificate Examinations (SSCE) has generated serious concern among teachers, parents, and the students because of the conventional method of teaching biology that dominate most classrooms leading to poor performance of students. This study investigated the influence of classroom and laboratory integration on students' achievements in Biology in Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State. Three research questions and three null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. The research design used in this study was the quasi-experimental design. The sample for the study consisted of 80 SSS 2 students from four secondary schools in Odigbo Local Government; two schools were randomly selected each from urban and rural areas from the 55 secondary schools in the study area. Simple random sampling technique was used in selecting the schools and the subjects in their classes. One of the schools in urban area was assigned the experimental group and the other the control group. This was also done to the two schools in the rural area. Both the experimental and control groups were given the same Biology test questions, but the difference is that while those in the experimental group were taught biology with classroom and laboratory integration, those in the control group were taught Biology using the conventional method as classroom was separated from laboratory. The instrument used for the data collection was Biology Achievement Test (BAT) which was constructed by the researcher. The BAT was validated by experts in test development. Mean score was used to answer the research questions while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the hypotheses at P < 0.05 level of significance. From the results obtained, it was found that students in the experimental group had significant higher achievement score in Biology than their counterparts in the control group. The school location (rural/urban) also had significant effect as students in urban area taught Biology with classroom and laboratory integration had a higher mean achievement score than their counterparts in rural area. Also, gender had a significant influence on the achievement of students in Biology as the mean post-test scores for boys is higher than the mean post-test scores for girls. Based on the findings, it was recommended that, both the classroom theoretical concepts and the laboratory skills should be taught simultaneously by the teacher to yield better performance of students in Biology, and the Government should provide well equipped laboratories for schools regardless of the location.\n\nThe Problem Healthcare by definition demands‘ Quality ’ , and the rigors of today’s competitive environment requires efforts that each ‘ Healthcare Organization’ must initiate and sustain. But, ‘ Healthcare Executives ’ , during the last 20 years, have faced the problem of ‘which Quality Model to implement’ and how to measure Quality Programs Progress and Success taking into consideration that pitfalls often accompany quick - and - easy, fast track ‘ Quality’ solutions . The following are some of the problems that most healthcare executives face : There are too many rapidly changing approaches to define and Implement Quality in the Healthcare field . 1981 QA - Mandatory JCAHO Standards . 1983 DRG “ Diagnostic Related Groups ” . 1986 Monitoring and Evaluation Standards. 1988 JCAHO and agenda for Change . 1989 Quality Improvement Initiative . 1989 Conformance to requirements not goodness ( Philip Crosby ) . 1989 Degree of Excellence ( Webster’s ) . 1990 The degree to which health services for individual sand populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge “ Institute of Medicine” . 1992 The degree to which patient care services increase the probability of desired patient outcomes and reduce the probability of undesired outcomes, given the current state of knowledge JCAHO. The Medical Insurance Companies and Regulatory “Accreditation” Agencies influence, to enforce the implementation of the current state of Quality Models. So, not allowing enough time to implement, measure and evaluate. Most of the healthcare Quality Models pay little attention to Customer Satisfaction, and how to be measured. The available Quality Measurement toolkits in the healthcare field do not give clue to discrepancies i.e. highly satisfied customer with relatively low performance or dissatisfied customer with higher performance. Also, today’s healthcare customers are more sophisticated, educated, demanding, and empowered. The Following concerns must be taken into consideration . Only very few customers with problems complain . The average person with a problem eventually tells more people about his dissatisfaction than the satisfied customers will do . Cost of acquiring a new customer is much more than retaining current ones . The average business loses some of its customers each year, often without knowing which customers they have lost ?, When they were lost ? and even why they were lost ?. The Objectives This Dissertation pursues to accomplish three main objectives . Review the most important literatures about quality in both healthcare and non-healthcare fields as a main theme and Customer Satisfaction as the issue of concern . Propose a conceptual framework for a ‘Quality Management Strategy’ that equally appreciates both consumer as-well-as provider satisfactions, i.e. Total Customer Satisfaction, benefiting from the previous Quality Models in Healthcare and other Industries. Also propose, somehow, a tool for measuring Total Consumer Satisfaction . Invite researchers to study the proposal and test its practicality and value for Healthcare Executive Managers and Quality Professionals.\n\nBackground: Patient safety is a significant challenge facing healthcare systems today. An important part of patient safety is the issue of medication administration within the acute-care setting that has long been the focus of scrutiny and research because it contributes directly to patient morbidity and mortality. Aim: The research on “measures used by nurses in safe medication administration practices” was under taken because medication administration is a risk filled procedure in nursing practice and all medications are potential poisons hence necessitating appropriate care when they are being administered [1]. Thus, the objectives of the study was; to identify safe medication administration practice amongst nurses, to assess the role of the nurse in safe medication administration of different routes ,to assess the challenges faced by nurses in carrying out safe medication administration practices. The target population was all the nurses / midwives of the Bamenda Regional hospital with an inclusion criteria being nurses / midwives who were directly involved in bedside patient care. The sample was calculated using a sample size calculation approach to get the number of nurses / midwives to use. The study design was a cross sectional design where the instrument of data collection was the use of an observational checklist and the administration of close ended questionnaires. Results: This study recorded 45 nurses amongst whom were 29 females and 16males. The majority(48.9%) of participants were between the age range 18-28yrs and 21(46.7%) had a work experience that fell within the range 0-5years. The study assesede the participants on the role of nurses in drug administration using different routes, for rectal medication administration, majority of the nurses (73.3%) of the nurses made sure patients defecated before the drug was administered. For topical medication administration, all the nurses used clean used clean gloves and a further majority (66.7%) ensured hygiene and proper documentation, subcutaneous route of administration(p-value <0.01), it was found out that 100% of nurses choose proper injection sites while only 93.3% of nurses document as per agency. For intramuscular route of administration, 100% of the nurses attended to medications once prepared from ampule. In direct intravenous route of drug administration, 100% of the nurses flushed with saline before and after administration to ensure potency. In conclusion, the prevalence of drug administration of different route amongst nurses in this study was 74.3%. this high prevalence recorded was probably because most nurses had good nursing practices on drug administration due to proper training and longitivity in service(p-value 0.02). Conclusion: proper medication administration of different route and safe medication practices are common in this study. Actually, reducing challenges they face requires the commitment of everyone with a stake in keeping patients safe; physician who wrote the prescription, pharmacist who dispensed it and the nurse who received the medicine and administered to the patient, all should assist to improve safe medication administration. Recommendation: the ministery of public health should charge hospitals to organize work shops for nurses to improve on medication admnistration. Keywords: Medication administration errors, drug administration of different route, Patient safety, role of nurses in drug administration."
