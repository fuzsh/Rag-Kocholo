        "text": "For this weeks #tbt article, we present \"How to Win by Changing the Game\" from Strategy and Business November 2008 which discusses how the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company stuck to its gums for more than a century and dominated. tl;dr üëá A true capabilities-driven strat¬≠egy is the most reliable way for a company to thrive when the rules of the game for its industry are in flux. Instead of looking inward at the capabilities you already have and trying to discern your strengths, start by looking outward at the capabilities you need. What must you be able to do to reach the customers you fundamentally want to attract? By designing a portfolio of skills and tools needed to win customers, you can end up changing the game instead of playing by the rules. https://lnkd.in/db3YGAhS\n\nIn the 1950s, the chips market was facing a common yet frustrating problem: too many broken chips and too much air in the packaging. ü§ù The innovative minds at Procter & Gamble entered. They proposed a revolutionary idea that would forever change the way we snack. The solution? ü§î A uniquely shaped chip known as the Hyperbolic Paraboloid. üí° This design made the chips sturdier and less prone to breaking. üí°Ensured the chips could be packed neatly into cylindrical containers üí°Prevented them from flying off the production belt thanks to aerodynamic properties. With this ingenious shape, Procter & Gamble hit the jackpot, solving storage issues and reducing waste simultaneously. The result was the birth of Pringles, a brand that gave a whole new perspective to the chips market. The mastermind behind this innovation wasüë®üî¨Frederick John Baur. His dedication to his creation was so profound that, according to his will, he was buried in a can of Pringles after his death. From a packaging problem to a global snack sensation, Pringles! #Innovation #Pringles #EngineeringExcellence\n\nüöÄ Reflecting on our journey: A Throwback 2019 üåü In 2019, our team Barton Jones Packaging Ltd embarked on a remarkable journey, taking a bold leap into the world of manufacturing. It's incredible to see how far we've come since then. Back then, we faced uncertainties and challenges, but we embraced the opportunity to create something tangible, to bring our ideas to life in a whole new way. The decision to venture into manufacturing was a pivotal moment, one that has shaped our identity and propelled us forward. The kit we started with in 2019 in the below picture may look basic, but it served it's purpose and got us to where we are today. Allowing us to split the arms of the business, one unit solely for Manufacturing & one for distribution. üì¶ üöõ #Innovation #ManufacturingSuccess #BusinessGrowth\n\nVia Piper Sandler and Boardroom, Gen-Z is spending big on the following brands. Notice NOT ONE is purpose-driven. Several involve slavery in the supply chain. Several more still involve labor disputes. One is owned by the CCP. One is known for putting bible quotes on chicken sandwiches. Don't lose the plot. More than everyone else even, Gen-Z wants products that make their lives easier or signal status. Ideally both. Look at what your target customer spends on, not what they self-report as their \"values.\" You'll quickly learn the two don't align.\n\nAccording to Warren Buffet, a Company that will make us rich is a company with a durable competitive advantage. He figured out that these companies come in three basic business models. 1) Companies that sell a unique product- This includes companies like Pepsi, coca-cola, Budweiser, Wrigley, Hershey, Washington Post, etc. These companies sell products that have a story in the minds of the consumer. Want to chew some gum? you think of Wrigley, When you want to enjoy some beer, you think of Budweiser. When a company owns a piece of the consumer's mind, it never has to change its products. By not changing the product, a company gets a good opportunity to charge higher for their product. 2) Companies that sell a unique service- This is a world of American Express CO., Moody's Corporation, Moody's Corporation, etc. These companies sell services that people need and are willing to pay for. A company doesn't have to spend a lot of money on redesigning its products, nor does it have to spend a fortune building a production plant and warehousing its wares. 3) Being the low-cost buyer and seller of a product or service- This includes companies like Walmart, Nebraska Furniture Mart, etc. Here, big margins are traded for volume, with an increase in volume more than making up for the decrease in the margins. The company here is both a low-cost buyer and a low-cost seller, which allows them to beat the competition, the story of being best best-priced in the town eventually becomes a reason for the consumer to where to shop. Selling a unique product or service or being the low-cost buyer and seller of a product or a service no matter what you need to cash in."
