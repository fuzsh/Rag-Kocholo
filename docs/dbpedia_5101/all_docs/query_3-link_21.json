        "text": "On Friday night just two days ahead of the UK announcing that the whole country must stay home at all times, I had already been isolating for a week due to being in the high risk group and I wrote this - it is mostly positive and I hope helpful! Please read and feel free to share. To any kidney patients who may be reading – sorry to highlight some of the scarier aspects of this situation but I feel the need to say it, and we will survive as we are well adapted to cope with this. Also I find writing extremely cathartic.\n\nMost of my friends and colleagues know that I consistently and vehemently resist anything that tries to hold me back. After 21 years of living with this dialysis adventure so far – I have the most amazing, fun, fulfilling life but it has in fact been built on top of a pretty crumbly foundation that includes several near death experiences, loss, disappointment, heartbreak, cancelled plans, changing major life decisions etc. It also remains a battle of willpower and stubbornness every single day. But beneath it all I always had the utmost reliance on the fact that however sick I was, the NHS would throw everything in their power at me. They have done so already multiple times in my life. This time is different. The reality of what we are hearing from Italy is that not everybody can have access to ITU even if they desperately need it. Those poor drs and nurses are making horrific decisions which will haunt them forever. For people like me and my many, many friends on dialysis or transplanted, who are young, with families and lives still to live.... well we are classed as the highest risk of all should we catch COVID-19, the scenario we don’t even want to contemplate is that we could well fall on the wrong side of the ITU and ventilator lottery.\n\nAnd so we stay home – entirely. For at least 12 weeks is what we are expecting to be told by NHS England on Monday but it could be more, and we respect the fact that none of us has power over this particular evil. It is not “giving in” to abide by social distancing guidance – unlike our oft quoted Blitz spirit this is an enemy that can and in some cases will follow you home and could realistically kill people you love. Staying home right now apart from essential attendance at work or the supermarket, even if you think it won’t affect you personally, is the most humane, life saving, amazing thing that you can do. And this is coming from the person who spends life with kidney failure jumping out of planes, riding unpredictable horses, trying ridiculous challenges like marathon running, regularly travelling as far from a dialysis machine as possible in the space of 2 days and generally not giving a toss about my body’s disinclination to work properly.\n\nStaying home to me feels like a waste of the life I’ve fought tooth and claw for, but dead people don’t even get the choice. I accept that I need to suppress my burning desire to be out there living at 100mph right now. I sincerely hope that nobody I am connected to on social media is disregarding social distancing or the stay home advice anyway but from communities like mine who are deemed at the highest possible risk, THANK YOU for helping to save our lives. Please do feel free to share this if you have friends who are still not taking it seriously.\n\nA few thoughts on how we all can try and cope with this time and be as resilient as possible. Frankly, kidney patients are used to living like this – in my day to day life I face health uncertainty all the time. Every single day my vascular access for dialysis could fail, I could develop common, serious complications, I could face the inconvenience of cancelled work or social plans because I’m suddenly unwell or my dialysis machine has broken down. When I started dialysis aged 14 I read books that told me I had a life expectancy of about 10 years according to data at the time so all these extra years are just an amazing bonus. My transplanted friends routinely face the reality of their organ suddenly rejecting or failing, or major, serious side effects from their anti rejection drugs (the same drugs which put them at very high risk from COVID-19 in the current environment). Those waiting for transplants often have to put their whole lives on hold (jobs, education, family, social life) for some unknown amount of time until they might get lucky through somebody else’s tragedy. NONE of this is easy – and the associated financial, social and emotional impact of living like that every single day of your life is huge. We try not to dwell on it though.\n\nYet now our whole country and indeed the world faces just that very same impossible scenario – loss of jobs, livelihoods, financial security, our social network and community (at least in person) and potentially serious health issues are suddenly a reality for everybody. But it will only be for a period of time until we can sort this out... not forever. What I want to say is – we can and will get through this. I have had many years to adapt to a life limiting condition being my “normal” and I promise not only have I adapted I learned to thrive, and some of the most positive things in my life came out of the most unimaginably awful circumstances. There are situations I have never written about online or talked about much anywhere because they really are a bit too traumatic and thankfully for now they are safely in my past and I am a relentless optimist, only ever looking for the next good happy thing in the world. So even if this has been the first of many weeks from hell for many of us, with lost jobs, closed businesses, families separated and the fearful anticipation of what is to come… there will be a time when we do look back and wonder with gratitude how we got through it. I am not being naïve that it will be an awful struggle for some – I am self-employed myself which is scary although thankfully I can tighten purse strings as much as possible and I have no kids depending on me to take care of them.\n\nBut for kidney patients specifically we also now face months of rigorous absolute social isolation, as much as possible separated from family who could infect us; most or all transplants won’t be able to go ahead during this crisis including those that were already scheduled as live donor transplants, so for people who have already waited months or years on the transplant list, their wait continues, relying on a life support machine. Apart from the tiny % of us dialysing at home, 95% of dialysis patients have to face the challenge of being told that it’s incredibly risky to go anywhere right now, yet they have no choice but to continue going to hospital three times every single week for their life saving treatment. This is yet another occasion that highlights why home dialysis, which I am lucky enough to do, is the most incredible solution to many of the challenges faced by people living on dialysis. A huge amount of courage, fortitude and patience will be required from those on dialysis right now and from all of us. I know that people with kidney disease will face this period with humour (especially totally inappropriate morbid humour), constant perseverance, a flexible problem solving attitude, an eye on how they can help others out and a bottomless gratitude to the healthcare professionals who are literally saving the world right now.\n\nThe biggest thing that has got me through every single unimaginably awful situation is love and support from family and friends. It sounds so cheesy but it’s true. But also – giving something back to the kidney community which is a principle I try to now fully embed into my everyday life, it brings me more pleasure and a feeling of life being worth living than almost anything else. Peer support, mentoring, offering advice and practical help, trying to raise awareness etc. Now is the chance for us all to do that for our family, friends and neighbours and I honestly believe it will help to save us. Acts of kindness cost nothing but have such a great impact. Trying to stay positive for each other, not catastrophising or constantly sharing all the doom and gloom in the media, helping each other to make positive plans for when this is over and also helping ourselves to just live in the moment as much as possible and take each day as it comes, are critical right now. As is a good angry cry or scream from time to time. And gin of course.\n\nStay safe everyone and find the things that make you feel calm and happy. For me that's video calls with my family and friends, keeping fit, the spring sunshine, my cat (who is unsure that he wants me home 24/7 for 12 weeks), having the privilege to be able to work from home, volunteering to support others over the phone and finding the most random online activities to do (joining a virtual rave on Sunday!) Hugs to all who need them too."
