        "text": "In January 2023, Constantine, the former and last king of Greece, passed away at age 82. Though he fled Greece when the monarchy was abolished in 1974, he would return in his final years. As he told T&C, \"Look at ancient Greek history. All Greeks who live in exile, they want to go back. It's in the blood. Funnily enough, the one pushing hardest was my wife. I think she realized I would be happy only when I came back home.\" A funeral was held in Athens, attended by royals from around the world, and he was buried as a private citizen at Tatoi cemetery.\n\nToday, a Service of Thanksgiving was held in Windsor at St George's Chapel. The British royals were out in full force to attend the service today, with the exception of King Charles and Kate Middleton, who are still absent from public duties, and Prince William—who bowed out at the last minute, citing personal matters. (He was scheduled to attend, and do a reading at the service; Constantine was his godfather.) However, Queen Camilla was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and many royals from around the world, including King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain, Princess Benedikte of Denmark, and Queen Noor of Jordan. Also in attendance were the Greek royal family—Constantine was survived by his wife, former Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, five children, and nine grandchildren. After the service, Queen Camilla hosted a reception at Windsor Castle for all the guests.\n\nHere, see all the best photos of the royals who attended the service of Thanksgiving for Constantine:"
