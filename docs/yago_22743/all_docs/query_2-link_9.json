        "text": "Like so many royals, King Constantine II of Greece, who died this week aged 82, was closely related to the other kings and queens of Europe. Both through birth and through marriage, Constantine had familial ties to the monarchies of Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Norway and Britain. News of his death will no doubt have come as a blow to his European relatives, including his second cousin King Charles III.\n\nConstantine II of Greece’s funeral date is set: King Charles’s much-loved second cousin will be buried in Athens next week\n\nRead More\n\nThe former king’s private office announced the death in a statement released on Wednesday, which read: ‘It is with deep sadness that the Royal Family announces that HM King Constantine, beloved husband, father, and brother, passed away yesterday, January 10, 2023, while being treated at HYGEIA hospital in Greece.’\n\nKing Constantine II of Greece, who ascended to the throne in 1964 before eventually fleeing following a military coup, will be buried following a funeral on Monday 16 January, in Athens. It will be a private ceremony and it remains to be seen if any foreign royals will be in attendance.\n\nAhead of the funeral, Tatler delves into the family ties between Constantine and his Euro royal relatives…\n\nKing Charles III\n\nConstantine II was a second cousin of King Charles III, through their fathers. Constantine’s father, King Paul of Greece, and the Duke of Edinburgh were first cousins. They shared a grandfather, George I of Greece.\n\nPrince William\n\nNot only was Constantine a second cousin, once removed, to Prince William but he was also one of the future king’s godfathers. William was given six godparents: King Constantine, Princess Alexandra of Kent, the Duchess of Westminster, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Lady Susan Hussey and Sir Laurens van der Post.\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nConstantine’s wife, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, is the youngest sister of the reigning Queen Margrethe II of Denmark (who recently made headlines with her decision to strip four of her grandchildren of their royal titles), making the former Greek king a brother-in-law to the Danish queen.\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden\n\nPrincess Anne-Marie is a first cousin of the reigning King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, meaning Constantine is related to the Swedish monarch through marriage. Anne-Marie and Carl XVI Gustaf are both grandchildren of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden.\n\nKing Harald V of Norway\n\nThrough marriage into the heart of one of Euro royalty's most sprawling dynasties, Constantine was also related to the reigning King Harald V of Norway. Harald is a second cousin of Anne-Marie through her mother, Princess Ingrid of Sweden, who married King Frederick IX of Denmark.\n\nQueen Anne-Marie of Greece\n\nAs well as being married and parents to five children – Princess Alexia, Crown Prince Pavlos, Prince Nikolaos, Princess Theodora, and Prince Philippos – Constantine and his wife, Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, were also third cousins: they shared King Christian IX of Denmark as patrilineal great-great-grandfather. They also shared Queen Victoria as a great-great-grandmother.\n\nKing Juan Carlos I of Spain\n\nFormer King Juan Carlos I of Spain and the former King of Greece are related through marriage. King Juan Carlos, father of the reigning King Felipe VI of Spain, is married to Constantine’s sister, Sofia. Born Princess Sofia of Greece and Denmark, Sofia is now titled Queen Sofia of Spain."
