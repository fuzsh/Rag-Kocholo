        "text": "Constantine I (born Aug. 2, 1868, Athens, Greece—died Jan. 11, 1923, Palermo, Italy) was the king of Greece from 1913 to 1917 and from 1920 to 1922. His neutralist, but essentially pro-German, attitude during World War I caused the Western Allies and his Greek opponents to depose him in 1917, and, having lent himself to Greece’s disastrous policy of territorial expansion into Anatolia after his restoration, he again lost his throne in 1922.\n\nConstantine, the eldest son of King George I of the Hellenes, received his higher education in Germany. Although the troops under his command were defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, and he, as commander in chief of the army (after 1900), failed to unite Crete (Modern Greek: Kríti) with Greece in 1909, Constantine restored his reputation during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 and succeeded his father to the throne on March 6, 1913. The brother-in-law of the German emperor William II, he was determined to keep Greece neutral after the outbreak of World War I, whereas Prime Minister Eleuthérios Venizélos backed the Allied cause. The Allied occupation of Thessaloníki (October 1915), Venizélos’s formation of a separate pro-Allied government (October 1916), and an Allied demand for his abdication finally forced Constantine to turn power over to his second son, Alexander, on June 12, 1917, without, however, renouncing his titular right. On Alexander’s death and Venizélos’s fall from power (1920), Constantine was recalled from exile by a plebiscite. He had to pursue Venizélos’s anti-Turkish policies, which led to catastrophic war in Anatolia in 1922. A military revolt cost him his throne for the second time, and he abdicated on Sept. 27, 1922, in favour of his eldest son, who became King George II."
