        "text": "Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark and his wife, Nina Flohr—now Princess Nina of Greece and Denmark—married in a religious ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens on Saturday. The wedding featured all of the pomp and circumstance that typically accompanies a royal wedding, even though the family is now no longer reigning. The ceremony marked the first time a Greek royal has married at the cathedral since Prince Philippos’s parents, King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie, said their vows there in 1964. It was also the first religious event held there for a member of the family since the christening of Prince Philippos’s older brother Prince Pavlos in 1967, just before the fall of the Greek monarchy.\n\nIn a “Royals, They’re Just Like Us” moment, Prince Philippos and Princess Nina had a micro-wedding in December 2020, like so many other couples impacted by the pandemic. Only their fathers served as the witnesses for their intimate ceremony in St. Moritz. In June of 2021, they had a wedding party at Stibbington House, the Cambridge home of Thomas Philip Naylor-Leland and Alice Naylor-Leland.\n\nPrincess Nina, who previously worked as the creative director of VistaJet, a private jet company started by her father Thomas Flohr, is no stranger to fashion (one of her most notable initiatives was collaborating with Moncler on cabin crew uniforms). For this third celebration, the bride—who is now the founder and creative director of the luxury hotel Kisawa Sanctuary and the founder of the environmental conservation center Bazaruto Center for Scientific Studies, wore a Chanel gown with her mother-in-law’s antique Corsage Tiara, featuring diamonds and pearls. The tiara was a gift to Queen Anne-Marie on her 18th birthday from her mother. Princess Marie-Chantal also wore it when she married Prince Pavlos in 1995.\n\nThe nuptials brought out royals from across Europe. Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank were in attendance, representing Great Britain. (Prince Philippos is a godson of Princess Diana.) Queen Sofia of Spain, Prince Ernst August and Princess Ekaterina of Hanover, Prince Christian and Princess Alessandra of Hanover, and Princess Tatiana Radziwill were all also in attendance. After the ceremony, the reception was held at the National Gymnastics Association."
