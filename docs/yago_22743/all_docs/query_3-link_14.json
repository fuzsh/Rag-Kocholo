        "text": "An important chapter of Greek history ended on Wednesday, January 11, in Athens, with a deafening silence. The former king Constantine II died at the age of 82 in Athens. Some Greek media outlets refer to him as Constantine Glücksburg, not wishing to mention the royal title of the former monarch who was deposed in 1974.\n\nThe last member of the Danish dynasty to rule from 1863 until the return of the Parliamentary Republic was the cousin of the British monarch Charles III and one of the godparents of his son, Prince William, and the brother of Queen Sofia of Spain. But his death caused barely a rustle in Greece, a country that has been riven by divisions between royalists and democrats since its creation.\n\nHe will not be given the state funeral he had so much desired. Neither the Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, nor the President of the Republic, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, will be present at his funeral on Monday, January 16. His death \"marks the formal epilogue (...) of a chapter that was definitively closed with the 1974 referendum,\" when Greeks voted by 70% to abolish the monarchy, said the prime minister in a terse message of condolence. The conservative leader also recalled \"the eventful journey of former King Constantine, marked and punctuated by turbulent moments in the contemporary history of Greece.\" \"History now has the floor. It will judge fairly and severely the Constantine of public life,\" he concluded.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Vangelis, sorcerer of the synthesizer, dies at 79\n\nPeriod of instability\n\nBorn in Athens on June 2, 1940, Constantine went into exile with his family when he was just one year old, first to Egypt and then to South Africa, after the invasion of Greece by Germany in 1941. In 1960, the young man, an elite sportsman, won a gold medal in sailing at the Olympic Games in Rome. Four years later, he married his young cousin, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, sister of the current Queen Margrethe II, and acceded to the Greek throne at the age of 23. Unprepared, he took the reins of a country troubled by deep political divisions. His disagreement with George Papandreou, the prime minister of the time, led to the latter's resignation in 1965 and to a period of instability that favored the seizure of power by the military junta on April 21, 1967.\n\n\"I was forced to accept it as a fait accompli in order to avoid pointless bloodshed,\" he said several years later to justify himself. Eight months after the colonels came to power, Constantine led a military countercoup that failed. \"That was the worst day of my life. It was the day I saw my first white hair appear,\" he confessed to Greek newspaper To Vima in 2015. After this aborted attempt, he was forced to go into exile, with his family, first to Rome, then to London. Many Greeks would never forgive his role in the colonels' rise to power.\n\nNever voted in an election\n\nAfter the fall of the dictatorship and the establishment of the Greek Republic in 1974, Constantine lost his royal title by referendum. Deprived of his nationality and property in 1994, Constantin Glücksburg filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights to recover them. In 2002, Greece was ordered to pay more than €13 million to the royal family. In 2013, in the midst of the economic crisis, Constantine and Anne-Marie returned permanently to Greece after four decades of exile. \"All Greeks who live in exile want to return. It's in their blood,\" he said at the time to the American magazine Town & Country.\n\nHe kept his distance from politics and said he never voted in any elections. According to the Greek media outlet Protagon, Constantine never accepted his deposition. His Danish diplomatic passport still read \"Constantine, King of Greece.\" In an interview with the television channel Skai in 2016, he even said: \"I am not the former King Constantine, I am King Constantine, period.\"\n\nOn Monday, January 16, Constantine will be buried in private in the presence of his wife and five children, and \"near his ancestors\" in the former royal residence in Tatoi, north of Athens.\n\nMarina Rafenberg (Athens (Greece) correspondent)\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
