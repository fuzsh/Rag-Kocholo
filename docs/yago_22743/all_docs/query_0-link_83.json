        "text": "we did not give him any money at all????\n\ndo you live in greece vangeliskirialanis??\n\ni have nothing against constantine i don't mind if he comes to live in greece as a common.he was born in greece i agree that he is greek maybe not 100%. anyway he did a lot of mistakes you have to admite that this is why he was exciled as a king.\n\nthe fact that marie chantal don't speak greek or her children what do you think of that? all i see is that she had money not a tittle, so she married an exciled prince for the tittle only. constantain raised his children as greeks they went to a greek school in london.pavlos is not doing the same.even if we wanted them back with that additue i don't think so...and V i am not the only one to say that.\n\nTotally agree with you Daphni! I am Greek, and I live in Greece!\n\nWe gave him a whole bunch of money! And whether some don't like it, he is EX-King Constantine of Greece! Greece is a republic and not a constitutional monarchy any more! People voted that they wanted a republic! A President of Greece and not a king!\n\nAnd yes the kids of Constantine and Anne Marie visited Greek schools! But how much do they use the language! They live either in Great Britain or the USA! I highly doubt that the speak the greek language nowadays!\n\nAnd Constantine is not 100% Greek! He was brought up Greek, but his mother was German and as all here in Greece know, from the older generations, she was very snob and never managed to speak greek! She was speaking German with her children and not at all Greek! And of course not to mention the extravagant costs she made, and her love for the then Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis!\n\nYou do surprise me a lot,Odette!\n\nI'm gonna stay in this forum forever....\n\nI've read everything about Aliki's life,but I've never thought that Frideriki was involved in that story.Now it seems logical to me...Everything would be different if they could get married and still remain King and Queen.\n\nMaybe all the Greeks would support the royal family until now.\n\nRumor has it that she was pregnant with Constantine's child, but she had an abortion! They had an affair, and a pregnancy would really destroy both Constantine as well as her career!\n\nThe fact was also confirmed in one of the books about her life!\n\nAs to them having been in love and he having wanted her I think it would have assisted the monarchy in many ways because Aliki was Greek and not foreign.Queen Anne Marie has been brilliant in her calling but she is not Greek is she?\n\nI really doubt that their relationship (if one ever occured) was more than a fling. Let's not forget that Aliki was after all 5 years at least older that Constantine and he met her in his very early 20s. Aliki always wanted to be self sufficient and provide for herself and she even said once I think :\" if someone ever told me that he was willing to offer me his love and the world I would aswer.Yes, for the love. But for the world , thanks but no thanks. I'll win it by myself\" She moreover enjoyed being in the stage in more than one ways and she would be willing to stop that for anything. I don't think she ever considered marrying him in any way . Constantine marrying a Greek would have indeed changed many things but that's a different story I think\n\nAnd Aliki dear heart died as far as I am concerned of a broken heart because she did not marry her true love the King.\n\nAliki died of cancer I think and in more than one ways the relationship that defined her the most was that with her first husband Papamichail.\n\nFrederika was looking for a teutonic Bride of royal ancestry.\n\nI read a translation of a recent Billet Bladet and there was a mention about it. It said how in Sofia's wedding all those German princesses who were invited were being \"paraded\"by their parents and they were looking their best in elaborate dresses and tiaras in order to impress Constantine and Frederika because it was known that she was an \" old school\" royal when it came to marriage and nevertheless the teenage and simple Anne Marie won him over the rest\n\nYou are right that Anne Marie was not viewed as \"greek\" enough and it would have been a lot better if Constantine married a Greek woman ( even in exile - his children could claim more easily a Greek nationality because no one could question a matrilineal Greek descent). But I highly doubt that Aliki had such a promising relationship with Constantine or that she could live as a Queen was supposed to live those days. Yes she was descended from her mother through a notable family (Koumoundourou) , but she didn't present much advantage for a royal bride. I mean , she was neither a rich woman nor a person of advantaged formal education and she didn't have the \"virginal\" profile ( mainly because she was an actress) that would be a sine qua non for Constantine's bride. Also we must not forget that she was his senior - he was born in 1940 and she was most often reported to be born in 1935 I think. That kind of things mattered those days, even for those involved in the relationship . Most important of all , I doubt that Aliki herself ever viewed him in a serious way - when they met he was the extremely young well groomed and born in the privilege Crown Prince and she a self made woman in her 25s who had face war, poverty and all kinds of struggle from an early age. It doesn't strike me as if they could form a substancial relationship. I don't think that Aliki had anything to gain from marrying Constantine other than money( and from what I gather about her , she would prefer to make her own money than marry into money) - she was a very popular figure, \" the national star\" of Greece, so why should she consider it? Instead she would even a bigger part of her privacy, she would be forced to act and behave and a very specific way and she would most likely face mockery from the rest of Europe's royalty. That's only my personal opinion of course.\n\nThanks Curryong and Duc et Pair - I was asking because the question came up on the forum a while ago and there was never a clear debate on it. It's an interesting 'what if' that I feel is worth exploring as some forum users thought it would have improved C's standing with the greeks at large.\n\nHowever given the fact that Greece had virtually no middle class at that time, was and is still very socially stratified, barring a miracle its a given that the would be lady in question would have come from one of these families, and given the ambiguous relationship many greeks have with them this could have either have acted as a bridge between Greece's elites and the RF (which in fact were often strained as many of greeces wealthy and political grandees found them too disapproving of their behaviour and of the RF's habit of marrying foreigners) Boosting the dynasty's claims to having 'gone native' as is the case for Norway or it could have left them even further tainted.\n\nI can't use C's cousin Michael and his wife Marina Karella as examples as they have been very discreet about their actions and about greek politics so they are not an analogue. However Marina's family are not one of the 'old' families but were recently wealthy as is the family of CPss Katherine of Serbia, something which makes them less politically comprimised. I only mentioned Queen Sonja as an example as her family were well off but were not a 'upper class' family by Norwegian standards - haute bourgeois basically was the background I was thinking of.\n\nIts also interesting as it helps look at some of the assumptions of what to do for a modern monarchy and why some things can work in one place (Norway) and may not work in another (Greece).\n\nI do think you're correct about Pavlos D et P - marrying the narcissistic money grubber was a very bad idea.\n\nYou must forgive me - it's Saturday night, I've been binge watching Blackadder again and I've got nothing else to do - It's intrigue on the brain.\n\nthe autobiography of King Constantine I imagine will be translated soon. he speaks about rumors that created the Greek press about him.\n\nConstantino speaks of the Greek tabloids and rumors that they created. This part of his autobiography, I liked a lot me .\n\nConstantine was very shy and little daring with women. I have a friend who knew constantine in person, at this time, he was related to sports and Greek Olympic Committee and he always said that the characteristic of Constantine is that he was very polite, and very shy, he always says that the Constantine that defined the press was not the real constantine, the Greek press had created a character that really did not corresponded to Constantine real.\n\nWhen I read the autobiography of King Constantine, I liked that he spoke about this rumors of greek tabloids about Alice and others..\n\nConstantine says that he was never boyfriend and he had not a relationship with the Alice, everything started because at an event in Athens in 1960 , he greeted to the actress, and the press began to create one gossip....\n\nhe account in his biography many anecdotes of this gossip,rumor... one affects a Minister, the Minister (not now remember the name) asked audience to King Pavlos, and King Pavlos thought he was coming to talk about the Cyprus problem , and he was very worried , when the minister came to Real palace, he asked to king Pavlos(King pavlos thought that it was by cyprus problems), \" When will the wedding be held?\" and King Pavlos said, \"what?\", the Minister said \"constantine and Alice\" he had read it in press, to King Pavlos gave a fit of laughter , and had to apologize and leave the office, because it was impolite, when it spent the giggles, he returned to the office and had to explain to minister that it were not true, that it was gossip of tabloid , it was what people wanted to hear .... King Pavlos said to Constantine that the minister was embarrassed, but disappointed.\n\nit was normal that taboides created this rumors with all the famous woman with who he spoke , i remember Liz Taylor, she was received by the Prince of Greece, was born gossip of photo, but then gossip is lost in time and the taboides turned not talk about it. Constantine was amused by some rumors that were very entertaining story that was created by the press, was like a movie script, however, after the minister's visit I think that he stopped liking that created those stories.\n\nIt's funny, when the European press, such as the Swedish or Norwegian publishing that Prince Constantine could be the boyfriend of one of the sisters of Carl Gustaf , I think it was Desiree, constantino traveled a lot to Sweden, the Swedish press published even the hotel he went to many dances with her, and in Europe the press spoke about this, the Greek tabloids, avoided speaking of European princesses, and especially Swedish.\n\nThere is a thought of Constantine that he has the feeling of the Greek tabloids of the time created these rumors to try to create the impression that the prince was an idle man, who did not worked .... he laments, it is sad to read and hear Constantine to say that he did not had adolescence, he did not enjoyed of his teens because he did not have it. and when friends came over the weekend or going to parties, yet, he always had been granted a function, a duty, his friends had a free weekend, but he still had to go to military practice or a trip, or receive someone. This is quite sad when you read these affirmations of king , because it's like he's trying to tell you, that to be Prince is not lucky, it's like you're losing your life for others people than ever you will recognize your effort and sacrifice.\n\nPrince Michael said in an article this very thing, that he never wanted to be the prince of Greece, his renounced wing sucesion made to him happy , because according Michael, he admired the Prince Constantine, his cousin had no private life, was always subject to one schedule, always from dawn until dusk they were led by an schedule, they were not free and adds Michael, the Greek press never recognized the King and Prince their work and effort , they only knew insulting, and represent them as privileged.... He admires King Constantine but he preferred to be free. Michael admires them because he says they were born in a sense of duty, which does not allow them to give it up. He admires to them, he doesn ´t like to be Prince.\n\nMemories of King Constantine should be published in all countries with monarchy, so that people know how hard it is to dedicate your life to others, and how hard it is that the press wants to represent you as if you were an famous...\n\nIf King Constantine would be reborn, he would choose to be an actor and he would return to marry Ana Maria , because she is the woman of his life since he saw to her in a magazine and his father told him, \"you're crazy ...\" (he was ahead of his time ,) he went to see her, but she ignored him, took time to convince to her ...\n\nHe says very nice things about Ana Maria , he will marry with his wife , which is the best of his life , and when he saw in that magazine her he thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world and he still thinks she is the most beautiful woman in the world .\n\nAfter reading the autobiography of King, and see everything he says of his youth, and read interviews in which he claims, If he were born again he would return to marry with his wife Ana Maria .\n\nand read in article of michael, he married with one woman greek(rich), he says that the best thing he did was give up the succession because he preferred his freedom to be prince of Greece.\n\nI think it can be said that if the throne of Greece had been saved by a marriage with a Greek woman selected by the Greek tabloids, then the answer to all these people that think it, is in the King's autobiography and Michael of geece, and IS:\n\nENJOY YOUR Republic.\n\nForgive all errors of translation, today had no desire to be translating,.... I do not speak English well."
