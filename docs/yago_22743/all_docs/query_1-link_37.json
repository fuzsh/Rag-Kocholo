        "text": "ATHENS — Constantine II, the last king of Greece, who ruled for just three years during a turbulent period in the country’s modern history that culminated in the abolition of the monarchy, died on Tuesday in a hospital here. He was 82.\n\nHe had been in intensive care for several days after a respiratory infection, a family spokeswoman said.\n\nConstantine was a popular figure when, at 23, he ascended the throne after the death of his father, King Paul, in 1964. Just years earlier he won Greece’s first Olympic gold medal in sailing in decades, at the 1960 Games in Rome."
