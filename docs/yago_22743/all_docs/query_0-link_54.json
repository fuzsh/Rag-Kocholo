        "text": "Greece's final king, Constantine II, has been laid to rest in a private funeral after he died at the age of 82.\n\nEuropean royals - including Princess Anne - gathered to pay their respects at the service in Athens on Monday.\n\nConstantine, who reigned from 1964-73, had been suffering with heart and mobility problems before he died.\n\nThe Greek government was criticised after it decided not to grant him a state funeral - as the monarchy was abolished in the 1970s.\n\nDuring his eulogy at Athens Metropolitan Cathedral, Constantine's eldest son Pavlos said his father ascended to the throne during a difficult period.\n\nHe said: \"This is not the end, father. You will live forever in our thoughts and hearts.\"\n\nDenmark's Queen Margrethe II was among the European royals who attended the service. She is the sister of Constantine's wife, Anne-Marie - whom he had five children with.\n\nConstantine's sister Sophia, who was also in attendance, is the wife of Spain's former King Juan Carlos and mother of Spain's current monarch, King Felipe VI. Felipe attended the funeral together with his wife, Queen Letizia.\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and his wife Queen Silvia were among the mourners too, as well as Prince Albert of Monaco.\n\nThe British Crown was represented by Princess Anne. Her brother King Charles III was unable to attend due to diary commitments including meeting the president of Cyprus on Monday.\n\nConstantine was distantly related to the British royal family and was a godfather of the Prince of Wales and Lady Gabriella Windsor, the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent.\n\nThe private service was officiated by Archbishop Ieronymos, head of the Orthodox church of Greece.\n\nConstantine's coffin, which was draped with the Greek flag, was taken to Tatoi, the former royal estate north of Athens where he was to be buried.\n\nAt least 2,000 mourners queued outside to pay their respects, according to state television ERT.\n\nSome were seen holding flags of the royal era, along with flowers and portraits of the ex-king and his wife.\n\nConstantine had reigned for just three years before an army dictatorship seized control of Greece in 1967.\n\nHe tried to organise a military counter-coup but it failed and he fled to Rome with the rest of the royal family, and later to London."
