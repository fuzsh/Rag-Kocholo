        "text": "“Your Majesties, the King and the Queen are extremely happy to announce the happy engagement of their beloved son, A.V.Y. of Crown Prince Constantine, after A.V.Y. of Princess Anne-Maria, daughter of A.A.M.M. of the King and Queen of Denmark”.\n\nThe Grand Courtier, Mr. Dimitrios Levidis, on January 24, 1963, read to the journalists who had been invited to the Palace this little extraordinary announcement of the Court with which the official announcement of the engagements was made. At the same time the artillery of Lycabettus saluted this joyous event with 21 shots.\n\nFour days later, on January 28, Crown Prince Konstantinos and Princess Anna-Maria, accompanied by King Frederik, Queen Ingrid and Crown Princess Margarita of Denmark, depart from Copenhagen’s Kastrup Airport bound for Ellinikos Airport in Athena. The Danish royals were the first to appear on the staircase and began to descend. Then Anna-Maria appeared and next to her the successor Konstantinos.\n\nWith the end of the official events of their engagement, Anna-Maria returned to her duties as a student at her school and Konstantinos to his duties as successor. The learning of the Greek language and ancient and modern Greek Culture was added to her courses. Konstantinos went as often as he could to meet her in her country because she herself could not come to Greece because of her studies. They appeared together at King Frederik’s birthday where once again the Danish people showed their love wholeheartedly."
