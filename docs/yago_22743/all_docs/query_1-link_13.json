        "text": "The Greek Ruby Tiara and Parure\n\nThe Greek Ruby Tiara and Parure have a remarkably romantic story. The pigeon blood rubies in the pieces originate from Olga Constantinovna of Russia (1851-1926, also the queen consort of Greece), who received one ruby annually from her husband, King George I of Greece, to celebrate their wedding anniversary.\n\nEventually the rubies were mounted onto a tiara with a distinctive laurel wreath design emblematic of ancient Greece, a necklace of ruby and diamond clusters of flexible length with detachable pendants, earrings and brooches. As a symbol of the continuation of royal romance, Queen Anne-Marie received the Greek Ruby Tiara and jewellery set as wedding gifts from her mother-in-law, Queen Frederika of Greece, in 1964.\n\nThe Greek Emerald Parure Tiara\n\nConsidered by many as the grandest of Greek royal jewellery, the Greek Emerald Parure Tiara is a favourite of Queen Anne-Marie, who often wears it to important royal engagements.\n\nAll the cabochon emeralds used to belong to Olga Constantinovna of Russia. The magnificent tiara features a unique mirrored “E” design in a diamond-encrusted scroll frame and is set with seven round cabochon emeralds.\n\nAlong with the tiara, the parure consists of pearl-drop emerald earrings and a corsage brooch with detachable pearl-drop emeralds, among other pieces. It can be worn in many variations and combinations.\n\nThe Khedive of Egypt Tiara\n\nThe Khedive of Egypt Tiara, a diamond wreath scroll tiara crafted by Cartier, was worn by Queen Anne-Marie on her wedding day in 1964. It was originally a wedding gift for Princess Margaret of Connaught (1882-1920, granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the UK) when she married Crown Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden in 1905.\n\nIt’s said that the couple first met in Egypt where their romance blossomed. For their wedding, the Khedive of Egypt (the governor of the country when it was ruled by the UK) commissioned Cartier to make this tiara, according to The Court Jeweller.\n\nThe Antique Corsage Tiara\n\nThe Antique Corsage Tiara is of a dainty design mounted with diamonds and pearls. Queen Anne-Marie received this tiara for her 18th birthday from her mother, Queen Ingrid of Denmark.\n\nOriginally a jewel-encrusted corsage brooch that can be traced back to Queen Victoria of Sweden (1862-1930), Queen Ingrid inherited it and transformed it into a tiara.\n\nQueen Alexandrine’s Diamond Sautoir\n\nA rather versatile piece of jewellery, Queen Alexandrine’s Diamond Sautoir, belonging to Queen Anne-Marie, is actually one half of a long diamond-set necklace. The owner of the original sautoir, or long necklace was Queen Alexandrine of Denmark (1879-1952), the grandmother of Queen Anne-Marie.\n\nIt was divided into two necklaces, which were eventually inherited by Queen Anne-Marie and her other sister Princess Benedikte of Denmark. Queen Anne-Marie has been seen pairing the sautoir with diamond and pearl drop earrings and an elegant diamond brooch."
