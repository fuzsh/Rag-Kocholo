        "text": "In 2013, after almost a half-century in exile in London, Constantine II, the deposed king of Greece, quietly moved back to Athens to live “as a commoner” while his former kingdom teetered on the brink of economic catastrophe. Despite the awkward timing, Prince Nikolaos, his devoted second son, relished the moment. He was raised in Britain but, fiercely proud of his family and heritage, had always dreamed of living in Greece. It was a dream that his new wife, Princess Tatiana, was still getting used to.\n\nA fashionable European aristocrat of Venezuelan extraction, Tatiana spoke no Greek and arrived in a country hollowed out by austerity and massive unemployment. “I remember when we drove in, it felt like everyone was traveling in the opposite direction,” she told me in her gently accented English. “People thought, and some still think, that there is no future here.”\n\nTatiana, 35, has all the charms of your prototypical princess: flaxen hair, perfect teeth, arresting green eyes, enviable posture. She can rock a tiara and sash, although she prefers jeans and sneakers. At her wedding on the island of Spetses in 2010, which one magazine described as “Mamma Mia, with aristocrats,” she asked an assortment of English nobles and Scandinavian princes to trade their formal finery for caftans and sandals.\n\nBorn in Caracas to parents of Slovenian and German origin, Tatiana (née Blatnik) went to boarding school in Switzerland and studied sociology at Georgetown. Before being swept up in the Greek royal family’s unceremonious return to Athens, she worked as an event planner and publicity consultant for Diane von Furstenberg and lived a posh yet discreet life in London’s Chelsea neighborhood. In interviews, she comes off as self-effacing about the whole royalty thing.\n\n“I do not feel like a princess,” she said shortly after her wedding. “I do not feel that I married a prince, with a title. Well actually, yes, he is my prince, but nothing more.” It’s not clear whether she takes this position because there’s an implied asterisk over her title (more on that later) or because there’s something about being a royal in the 21st century—the elitism, the anachronistic pageantry—that doesn’t sit well with her. With me, she is politic about her royal connection. “It’s a privilege, and an honor, to be part of the family,” she says, while insisting that her title has little impact on her daily existence. “I live a very simple life here. I work, I go to the supermarket, I cook, I walk my dog, and the Greek people have welcomed me like they would anyone else,” Tatiana says. “There’s a word here, philoxenia, a love of strangers, and I’ve really felt that very strongly here.”\n\nPlenty of women in Tatiana’s place would, after arriving in Greece, follow the example set by the ex­–King Constantine and steer clear of the public square—especially given the royal family’s calamitous history and complicated reputation. But Tatiana has taken a bolder path, devoting herself very publicly to helping her adopted country in its moment of need. She has recently partnered with Boroume, an innovative charity that, despite its shoestring budget, has provided 6 million meals for food-insecure Greeks during the crisis. She’s published this month, A Taste of Greece (teNeues), a cookbook to benefit that charity (with contributions by Greece-loving luminaries like Tatiana Casiraghi, Margaret Atwood, Arianna Huffington, and Valentino Garavani). And she just unveiled an accessories and houseware platform, Tria Etc, to help Greek artisans retool their traditional handicrafts and reach international markets. For her, that’s a lot. For the country, saddled with grinding poverty and a mountain of debt, it’s a drop in the bucket.\n\n“I always want to do more. I’m never satisfied. There are so many problems here that it can sometimes feel overwhelming. If I start to think that I’ve only helped three or 30 or 300 people, then there’s a real sense of helplessness—it’s just not enough,” she says. “But I really believe in the ripple effect. You do as much as you can and you hope that it spreads.”\n\nI meet Princess Tatiana outside a soup kitchen in the working-class neighborhood of Ilioupoli. It’s a gorgeous late spring day, and I’m relieved to discover after a few years away from Athens—some very traumatic years for the city—it’s still its usual self: sun-stroked, sexy, fueled by strong cigarettes and iced Nescafé. The soup kitchen, housed in a basement annex of a Greek Orthodox Church, provides meals to many local parishioners who have fallen on hard times. Great big pots of stewed meats and roasted vegetables are being fussed over by a team of old ladies, all pensioners in flowery prints. Portly Orthodox priests in long black robes with velvety beards pass out thin candles. There is a blessing—it’s rather beautiful and takes a rather long time (which characterizes most experiences I’ve had with the Eastern Orthodox Church).\n\nA group of sallow-faced Athenians gathers in front of the kitchen, holding plastic bags filled with Tupperware, waiting to collect their meals. Many of the soup kitchen’s patrons wish to bring their meals home; some have children to feed, others are just ashamed to be seen accepting charity. Neighbors sometimes whisper to the priests about who could use help but is too proud to ask for it. “Poverty is not only about lack of food or resources. It’s also about social exclusion,” says Tatiana. “And a place like this, and an organization like Boroume, fights both things at once.”\n\nWhat drew Tatiana to Boroume—which supplies this soup kitchen with food—is not just its laudable mission but how effective it is at carrying out that mission. Unlike most food banks and similar nonprofits, which spend most of their resources on logistics—picking up unwanted food, storing it, and then distributing it to the needy—Boroume coordinates so that the recipients pick up food themselves directly from donors, cutting out the need for warehouses or delivery trucks. Boroume launched in 2011 by organizing the donation of 12 leftover cheese pies from an Athens bakery to a soup kitchen. Today Boroume provides 15,000 meals every day across Greece, paying just 1 euro in operational costs for every 22 portions of food served.\n\nBefore we leave, one of the elderly kitchen workers approaches with a yellowed photograph of Tatiana’s father- and mother-in-law, Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie, sitting in a carriage. She wants to tell Tatiana how much her family—which is to say, the Greek royal family—still means to her. Tatiana’s Greek is coming along, so she conveys her appreciation and they embrace warmly. No one else in the soup kitchen seems to pay the princess much attention. It’s quite possible they don’t even know who she is.\n\nTatiana calls herself a “princess of Greece”—her publicist likes to append the honorific HRH—but the Greek government would beg to differ. The particularities of her situation require a bit of explaining. Long before the country’s present turmoil—that is, before the specter of Grexit, before desperate refugees started arriving from the Middle East, before youth unemployment hit 50 percent, and before half a million (mostly young and well-educated) citizens abandoned the country—Greece had a monarchy. Which is not to say the royals had an easy time of it.\n\nModern Greek political history is all chaos: coups and countercoups, civil war, assassinations, strikes, juntas. Greece’s royal family has been routinely tossed about in these historical squalls, and for them, exile was always around the corner. George II, who reigned briefly in the 1920s and then again from 1935 to 1947, once said that “the most important tool for a Greek king is a suitcase.”\n\nIn 1974, the monarchy was formally abolished by referendum. Constantine had fled the country seven years earlier, after engineering a countercoup against a far-right dictatorship only to demur for fear of bloodshed. He escaped to Italy—piloting the plane himself—and found himself in dire straits. “We had less than three minutes of fuel when we touched down,” he told Town & Country last year. “I had to borrow $300 from my valet to refuel the plane, and my brother-in-law [King Juan Carlos of Spain] had to send me clothes.”\n\nHe settled in London, opened a school to educate Greeks abroad—which Nikolaos attended—and hobnobbed with other European royals, most of whom are his relatives, including his cousin (Queen Elizabeth) and his sister (Spain’s Queen Sofia). But his heart always ached for home. In many ways, Nikolaos, who arrived in Athens in 2013 a few months before his father, felt as passionate about returning to Greece as Constantine. If anything, his yearning was intensified by the fact that he never had the chance to live in the country that is so inextricably and calamitously linked to his family’s story.\n\nNikolaos, 46, has worked in television and banking but now spends his days as a landscape photographer. He first came to Greece at age 11, when the government permitted the royal family to return for just eight hours to bury Nikolaos’s grandmother Queen Frederika, who had died in Spain after complications from surgery.\n\nNikolaos brought Tatiana to Greece for the first time in 2004, around the Olympics, and she recalls the deep impact the journey had on both of them.\n\n“Coming here was really emotional, overwhelmingly so, because Nikolaos was so attached to the idea of Greece and couldn’t get enough of it,” she says. “One night, I was exhausted and wanted to go to bed but he pleaded with me, ‘No, please, I must watch every sunset and every sunrise. I’ve been longing for this my whole life.’ ”\n\nBefore meeting Tatiana, I asked an array of Athenians about the royal family, and many of their reactions surprised me. I thought everyone here would be so touched that Constantine & Co decided to throw their lot in with the Greeks in the midst of the crisis, showing solidarity with the country that had once spurned them at the very moment when so many other wealthy Greeks were fleeing.\n\nBut everyone dismissed my hypothesis as sentimental, American nonsense. “Of course they came back,” a taxi driver, Eleftherios, told me. “Anyone who has lived in Greece, who has seen this beautiful country, will always want to come back.” Others I met confessed to reading about the royal family in gossip magazines and seemed impressed at how well the princes have married (Pavlos, the crown prince, wed the duty-free–shopping heiress Marie-Chantal Miller). The closest thing to monarchist nostalgia I encountered came from an art gallerist who spoke with sadness about how the royal family’s once-magnificent palace and gardens at Tatoi have fallen into disrepair since their seizure by the state. Mostly, though, people regarded the royal family as a vestige of an older time, a nonissue, and, for a country that already has so many issues, maybe that’s okay.\n\nAfter dark, I meet up with Tatiana and her husband for dinner on the roof of an old restaurant in Monastiraki with a heart-stopping view of the Acropolis. Downstairs, just in earshot, a cabaret singer is crooning Greek standards. Tatiana is dressed in a beaded black blouse, an elegant matching black shawl wrapped around her shoulders. I’m surprised that no one seems to notice her or her husband, but then a carafe of chilled raki shows up at their table, compliments of one of the restaurant’s patrons. We eat grilled octopus, mashed fava beans, taramasalata, beef stewed in tomato sauce—the kind of simple Greek soul food Tatiana lovingly catalogs in her new cookbook.\n\nNikolaos makes a sweet toast. He talks passionately about how much he loves Greece, how he would have moved here even if the country were “sinking,” how the only thing that could have stopped him was the possibility that Tatiana wouldn’t come with him. She smiles widely, acknowledging that the decision maybe wasn’t as simple for her as it was for him. But a few years in Greece has transformed Tatiana from a rootless aristo, a woman of privilege searching for purpose, into a progressive princess on a mission.\n\n“Today I’ve never been happier, more excited, more at home,” she says. “But when I first told my friends I was moving here, they were like, ‘Are you crazy? Everyone’s leaving Greece.’ But my whole experience has been the opposite of what people have expected. Of course, I see the hardships that people are going through—it’s not that I live in the clouds—but I also see people who are creative, who are strong, who want to move on, who want to stay and build their lives here. Many of my Greek friends could be living in New York or London or Los Angeles but have chosen to stay.”"
