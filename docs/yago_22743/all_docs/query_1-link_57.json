        "text": "A Byzantine Greek Orthodox 40 day memorial service for the late former King Constantine of Greece was held Saturday, February 18th at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens. The 40 day mourning period with a memorial service is an Eastern Orthodox tradition.\n\nMemories of former King Constantine’s 2nd international press conference with the Greek press in 1991 came to mind. Queen Anna Maria was present. It was 18 years after the abolition of Greek monarchy by a national referendum. “This time you will be able to meet the Queen,” said my late publisher Ann Agris of the former newspaper, “The Hellenic Chronicle”, based in Boston Massachusetts. The article was printed on May 23, 1990. Enclosed is a copy.\n\n“This press conference included three generations of journalists that have experienced life in World War II, Civil War, Junta and Democratic Greece. One thought Lou constantly in everyone’s mind. What was the purpose of the deposed monarchs, we wanted him meeting with the Greek press after two decades of silence? Was the exiled monarch planning to turn to Greece marking the end of democracy?\n\nOne journalist asked former King if he was planning to become a member of the Greek Congress or become president of Greece. “I have no interest in politics. I am expressing my views as a Greek who watches from far away and wants to help my country that is having problems. I will return to Greece when decided by the Greek government. It is a hypothetical question whether I will return as a king or a private citizen. When that day comes, I will deal with the situation?\n\nThe Olympic Gold Medalist, who was one of three Greeks to achieve this distinction in modern times, expressed the wish “to return. I do not know when, or in what manner I shall return. In international politics, he believes “most of the world’s nations want to free Kuwait. What about freeing Cyprus? Nobody cares about freeing Cyprus. This is a perfect time for the United Nations to play a role in freeing occupied Cyprus. In the Balkans, Greece must support Greek minorities who are trying to set up democracy.”\n\nFormer King Constantine alluded to a forgotten historical fact about modern Greece in his April 30 in Atlanta. The deep rooted friendship of Greece with the US has been strengthened into world wars. We fought side-by-side. As many of you will remember, in 1940, Greece was the first country to win a major victory against the Axis forces. Greece has been, is and will always be one of the most faithful members of the Democratic alliance.\n\nThe question was raised about his family’s recent donation to the Greek government of their family lands. “We donate our lands and just took some personal possessions. Our personal property left legally with the stamp of the Greek nation. The royal family holds a Greek passport of the Common Market and has the same rights as any Greek citizen under the Greek Constitution.” The former head of state maintained steady eye contact throughout the intense questioning. He did not dodge any question. He tried to give each journalist a complete answer.\n\n“This past year I tried to get the Olympiads for Greece. I was forced in a position to go and take an active role. My wife and I tried to get the 1996 Olympiads for our country. Life goes on. I will attend the 1996 Olympiads in Atlanta.”\n\nFormer King stated “for the past few years, political events within my country and within the area caused a serious decline in tourism. The timing is right for a reversal. Whatever negatives exist, are insignificant compared to the historical sites, the climate, and the low cost that Greece provides. I am more interested in helping to find solutions.”\n\n“It is important to create a unity of purpose among the Greeks, regardless of where they live or their individual political beliefs. Many of my countrymen and women believe that if Greece were named as host to the 1996 Olympic Games, this would have given a focal point for unity. Preparing the presentation to the international Olympic Committee was a perfect example of all political parties working together for the common good…the result was a Disappointment, because we believed we could have run the perfect games… The 100th anniversary of the modern Olympiads, 1996, should be the year of the Olympic Spirit in Greece.. Increase. A cultural Olympiads of celebrations should be held throughout the country for the entire year, except those periods when the summer Olympiads are to be held Atlanta… Once again the Greek spirit will influence the lives and spiritual growth of millions all over the world. An economic, social, political and moral Renaissance will help Greece become one of the stars of the 1990”s.”\n\nQueen Anna Maria is a tall, slim woman with the same imposing elegance as her husband. Her fine features remind of her cousin, Princess Diana. She speaks English with a native British accent. Her Greek is flawless. Her composure in support of her husband’s viewpoint was impressive in the light of the intense questioning by the press. “Our two oldest sons spent Easter in New York City this year. They enjoyed themselves spending this holiday in the United States. Former Queen Anna Maria has a sincerity and speak comes from the heart. “Our two oldest sons (Prince Paul and Prince Nicholas) are studying universities here in the United States. They are very happy here.. I am looking forward to seeing my two youngest children follow their older brothers and sister at studying in the United States.”\n\nAs the former monarch spoke of her children, one could envision her as mother devoted to our children. Her excellent impression of education, social and religious life in America was clear. When asked about the problems she faced in raising a family in exile, the former Queen replied “him it was not easy. My husband and I instilled in our children pride in their Greek heritage. Our children speak fluent Greek and attend the Greek school in London. “Having my two younger children (under the ages of 12) has made me very happy I devote my time to caring for them.” She mentioned her youngsters like the same type of social entertainment as elementary school children hear (McDonald’s). “Our children matured into fine persons because of my husband who was an excellent father.”\n\nQueen and Maria admitted not being influenced by the movement initiated in the 1960s concerning more social, economic and political opportunities for women. “I am old-fashioned. I listen and agree mostly with my husband. A wife should help her husband and follow from behind.” Former Queen Anna Maria views her role as a mother and wife in the traditional Europeans style. “I enjoy going to museums and concerts. I help the Greek school in London, primarily in a fundraising capacity.” The exiled monarchs established the Greek school in London with the support of the Greek community. All five of their children attended.\n\nThe spring 1991 press conference of exiled King Constantine highlighted his continued interest and genuine concern for the well-being of his country Greece. He presented his views on reviving Greece’s economy through a cultural Olympiads. Formal Queen Anna Maria’s warmth and charm radiated throughout the press conference. In former King Constantine’s words “the onlooker…sometimes sees points that even the players can miss.”\n\nWhat is the late King Constantine of Greece’s legacy? Dimitri Filippidis, radio anchor/international Greek American journalist said “Eternal His Memory. He gave Greece a gold Olympic medal. He went into exile to avoid a civil war. I have no interest in monarchy or kings. I know this: he did not steal or destroy Greece. The late former King Constantine II is a part of Greek history. Our politicians will not be present at his funeral, possibly because national elections are coming. His tomb is in burnt out, barren ground. Many, who are not monarchists, have sympathy for his family. The community is divided over honors for the late King Constantine II.”\n\nJournalist Filippidis believe “Politicians destroyed our country, Greece. They gave away Macedonia. We are not honoring this man? The winner of the TV series of ‘Survivor’ will be honored, but not the former King of Greece. History will be the judge of the Late former King Constantine II’s honors. He was a leader, general and member of the Greek armed forces. He accepted the people’s will and left Greece. We gave up the monarchy, but that does not mean we can erase history.” As Napoleon Bonaparte, popular French General said “History is written by the winners.”\n\nFormer King Constantine of Greece and his queen Anna Maria in personal correspondence with Catherine Tsounis"
