The two made a truce, and Constantine appointed a government to hold an election in 1967.\n\nKeystone-FranceGamma-Rapho via\n\nThe election favored Papandreou's left-leaning son, and so Constantine and his supported prepared an unsuccessful coup, the AP reported.\n\nHis coup having failed, he fled to Rome.
