        "text": "Though they are no longer legally recognized, the members of the Greek royal family remain prominent figures in society.\n\nBeginning with King George I in 1863, the monarchy ruled in Greece until 1924, and again from 1935 to 1973. The last king of Greece, Constantine II, took the throne at age 23 after the death of his father, Paul I, in 1964. After only a few years in power, however, King Constantine was forced to flee the country after a right-wing military dictatorship staged a coup in 1967.\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful counter-coup from the king and his supporters, Constantine left for Rome and eventually relocated to London, living in exile for many years with his wife, Queen Anne-Marie, and their children. The monarchy was officially abolished in 1973, but Constantine did not return to Greece permanently until 2013. Instead, he and his family lived for many years in Hampstead Garden Suburb in London, where he was said to have close ties to now King Charles III.\n\nEven after the king's death in 2023, his surviving wife goes by the title of Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, and other members of the family still stylize themselves with royal titles.\n\nConstantine and Anne-Marie's five children — Alexia, Pavlos, Nikolaos, Theodora and Philippos — and nine grandchildren continue to represent the now-defunct Greek monarchy. As the first son, Pavlos is his father's heir and holds the symbolic title of the crown prince.\n\nWhile many of the royal family members still live in Europe, others have moved to the U.S. to pursue their education and careers like acting, modeling and entrepreneurship.\n\nKeep reading for everything to know about Greece's royal family.\n\nKing Constantine II\n\nConstantine II, the last king of Greece, was born in Athens, Greece, on June 2, 1940, to King Paul and Frederica of Hanover. Paul was the late Prince Philip's first cousin and Constantine was reportedly close with his second cousin King Charles. He also became godfather to Prince William.\n\nConstantine went to boarding school and attended the three branches of military academies before studying law at the University of Athens. In 1960, he won a gold medal in sailing at the Rome Olympics and later became a member of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nFollowing the death of his father in March 1964, Constantine succeeded the throne at age 23. He married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark on Sept. 18, 1964, and the couple went on to welcome five children: Alexia, Pavlos, Nikolaos, Theodora and Philippos.\n\nKing Constantine and Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou came into power around the same time, and the two men clashed often. In April 1967, a military regime known as the Greek junta (or Regime of the Colonels) led a coup; the junta arrested Papandreou, and the king bartered an agreement with the group by recognizing their government. But Constantine had a tenuous relationship with the junta, and in December 1967, he attempted to overthrow their military forces.\n\nWhen it became clear that the king's coup was failing, Constantine and his family flew to Rome. The Greek monarchy was eventually abolished in 1973, and the junta collapsed just over a year later. Constantine lived in exile in the Hampstead Garden Suburb of London with his family for many years. He returned to Greece in 2013.\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2023, Constantine died of a stroke at age 82 in Athens.\n\nA memorial service of Thanksgiving was held at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on Feb. 27, 2024. While members of the British royal family did attend, led by Queen Camilla, Prince William wasn't one of them, despite being scheduled to read at the ceremony. Before the service began, William pulled out due to a personal matter, according to Kensington Palace.\n\nQueen Anne-Marie\n\nQueen Anne-Marie was born Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark on Aug. 30, 1946, in Copenhagen to King Frederick IX of Denmark and Queen Consort Ingrid of Sweden.\n\n18-year-old Anne-Marie married Constantine in Athens in September 1964, making her the first Danish princess to marry a reigning monarch since 1680, according to the New York Times.\n\nJust three years after she and Constantine were wed, they were forced into exile, and her wedding dress was lost in the Tatoi Palace archives. But in November 2023, Town & Country reported that the dress was found again, per a Greek journalist.\n\n\"Here is the wedding dress of Queen Anne-Marie located in Tatoi, where a few days ago it was revealed among the personal belongings of the royal family preserved and kept there,\" Megos wrote on Instagram in the caption in Greek.\n\nThe couple welcomed five children: Alexia, Pavlos, Nikolaos, Theodora and Philippos, all of whom are princes and princesses of both Greece and Denmark, though they don't appear in Denmark's line of succession.\n\nAt her husband's funeral in January 2023, Anne-Marie wore the same diamond cross necklace she debuted on their wedding day.\n\nCrown Prince Pavlos\n\nCrown Prince Pavlos was born on May 20, 1967, at the Tatoi Palace north of Athens. He is the first son and second child of Constantine and Anne-Marie, making him his father's heir. Following Constantine's death in 2023, Pavlos became the head of the Royal House of Greece.\n\nIn 1995, he married American heiress Marie-Chantal Miller. The couple share five children: Maria-Olympia, Constantine-Alexios, Achileas-Andreas, Odysseas-Kimon and Aristides-Stavros. The family has lived in New York City, London and Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nPavlos is a co-founder and managing member of the hedge fund Ortelius Advisors.\n\nCrown Princess Marie-Chantal\n\nCrown Princess Marie-Chantal, née Miller, was born on Sept. 17, 1968, in London to American billionaire Robert Warren Miller and María Clara \"Chantal\" Pesantes Becerra.\n\nShe grew up in London, Hong Kong and N.Y.C. and studied for one year at New York University, but she dropped out when she became engaged to Pavlos.\n\nIn 2000, Marie-Chantal began her eponymous children's clothing line, and in 2019, she released an etiquette book, ​​Manners Begin at Breakfast.\n\nPrincess Maria-Olympia\n\nPrincess Maria-Olympia, who goes by Olympia, was born on July 25, 1996, in N.Y.C. and is the oldest child of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal.\n\nOlympia attended boarding school in Switzerland and graduated from NYU in 2019 after studying fashion and business. Post-graduation, Olympia became a model and a fashion \"it\" girl, working with brands like Michael Kors and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nAccording to an interview with the Telegraph, Olympia began dating publishing heir Peregrine Pearson in 2020.

He then enrolled at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and graduated in May 2022.\n\nIn 2019, Constantine and his father modeled for photographer Nikolai von Bismarck's book The Dior Sessions, but he doesn't appear to have done any modeling since. The young prince has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, where he shares his photography.\n\nPrince Achileas-Andreas\n\nPrince Achileas-Andreas was born in N.Y.C. on Aug. 12, 2000, and is the third child of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal.\n\nFollowing in his older sister's footsteps, Achileas enrolled as a student at NYU. In addition to his studies, the prince is also an actor, having made his TV debut in 2018 on The Bold and the Beautiful.

He is the fourth child of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal and shares a birthday with his mother.\n\nIn a December 2022 Instagram post, Marie-Chantal shared that Odysseas solidified an early decision acceptance at his \"dream University,\" though she did not specify which school.\n\nThe teenager also runs a streetwear apparel line called Gallows Humour.\n\nPrince Aristides-Stavros\n\nPrince Aristides-Stavros was born on June 28, 2008, in Los Angeles and is the youngest child of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal.\n\nIn April 2021, Marie-Chantal shared an Instagram photo of her youngest son and wrote, \"My littlest is growing up!\"\n\nPrincess Alexia\n\nPavlos' older sister, Princess Alexia, was born on July 10, 1965, in Greece and is the first child of Constantine and Anne-Marie.\n\nAlong with her siblings, Alexia grew up in exile and lived in Rome and London.
