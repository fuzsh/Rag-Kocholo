        "text": "A member of the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), as a Donald Amer was a Lieutenant involved with Party Koodoo–Inhuman, for which he was mentioned in despatches.\n\nAfter COPP was officially constituted, he was S/COPP of COPP 6 (Naval Party 725) during its time in Sicily — for which he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), gazetted on 7 December 1943.\n\nIn December 1943, when he attended a meeting at Combined Operations Headquarters in London to discuss the methods that COPP would use to survey the Operation Overlord beaches (DEFE 2/1059), he was listed as a Lieutenant.\n\nHe is known to have taken part in:\n\nreconnaissance near Marina di Ragusa, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 27 May–1 June 1943 (with a ‘chariot’ human torpedo crew)\n\nreconnaissance near Marina di Ragusa, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 1–7 June 1943 (with a ‘chariot’ human torpedo crew)\n\nreconnaissance near Licata, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 24 June–1 July 1943\n\npilotage to Bark East sector during Operation Husky on 9–10 July 1943\n\nreconnaissance near Capo Colonna, Italy, from 24 July–7 August 1943 from HMS Unseen.\n\nAfter COPP 6 returned from the Mediterranean, he took part in Operation Bellpush Able and Operation Bellpush Baker in December 1943.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as S/COPP of COPP 6. During Operation Nepture, the D-Day invasion, he was with Peter Wild providing pilotage for the British 2nd Army’s 30th Corps towards La Riviere (Strutton & Pearson, 1958, p. 161). He was mentioned in despatches for a second time.\n\nA Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), Hugh Baird joined COPP towards the end of the war and became S/COPP of COPP 1 in south-east Asia, replacing Peter Wild who had stepped up to become COPP’s senior officer in that theatre (Galwey, 1992, p. 126).\n\nBorn in Esher, Surrey, on 7 August 1915, he served on the cruiser HMS Danae before specialising in navigation, attending the navy’s school of navigation at HMS Dryad, a ‘stone frigate’ shore establishment. He was “an excellent navigator” and “a born COPPist, utterly undismayed by canoeing in foul weather” (Galwey, 1992, p. 126–128).\n\nHis COPP training was being completed at the time that the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Galwey, 1992, p. 130), but Baird’s appearance in Jack Crane’s personal diary suggests that he did complete the move to south-east Asia to take charge of COPP 1.\n\nBefore the war he was “a scientific instrument maker, a director of Baird & Tatlock and a chap who had built his own boat” (Galwey, 1992, p. 126–127).\n\nHe married Madeleine Katharen Rose, of the Scottish Clan Rose, on 19 May 1945. After the war the family moved to Booker Bay, New South Wales, Australia, where he started a boat-building business in Woy-Woy.\n\nBaird became ill and died on 25 August 1983, after which his widow and family moved back to Inverness (Galwey, 1992, p. 129–130). He is buried at Kincraig Cemetery in Scotland. His son, David Hugh Heriot Baird Rose, is the 26th Laird of Kilvarock, chief of the Clan Rose.\n\nAs a Lieutenant, Stealthily by Night says that Frank Berncastle was the inaugural COPP 2’s senior officer.\n\nCOPP 2 was a ‘semi autonomous’ team that carried out more traditional hydrographic surveys from converted landing craft. At some point he was joined by Ken Scott who “helped procure craft and equipment” (Trenowden, 1995, p. 90).\n\nIn October 1943 his team was ‘spun off’ from COPP and reconstituted as the 712th Landing Craft Personnel (Survey) Flotilla, as part of Force J reporting to John Hughes-Hallett at HMS Victis on the Isle of Wight.\n\nMuch of the following information is from Charts and Surveys in Peace and War (Morris, 1995, p. 179).\n\nBefore the war, Berncastle had been in the Merchant Navy before joining the Royal Navy. In 1938 he joined the survey ship Endeavour in New Zealand.\n\nOn the outbreak of hostilities, he returned to the UK and carried out minesweeping on board , based out of Sheerness, being awarded a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). In 1941 he joined Franklin on the east coast of the UK. In 1942 he:\n\n[…] joined the staff of the Chief of Combined Operations, serving in landing craft specially adapted for measuring beach gradients at night on enemy-occupied coasts. His first operations were based on Dover, but then in 1943 he assisted at both the Sicily and Salerno landings, and then on the Normandy beaches both before and after the landings.\n\nHis work was rewarded with a bar to his DSC and 18 months accelerated promotion to Lieutenant Commander.\n\n(Morris, 1995, p. 179)\n\nIn December 1943, when he attended a meeting at Combined Operations Headquarters in London to discuss the methods that COPP would use to survey the Operation Overlord beaches (DEFE 2/1059), he was listed as part of ANCXF (Allied Naval Commander, Expeditionary Force) staff. He was a Lieutenant at that time.\n\nIn autumn 1944 he rejoined HMS Franklin for two months, carrying out clearance surveys in European ports, before in October that year heading out to Australia to join Challenger working in the Torres Strait.\n\nAccording to Wilson & Callo (2004, p. 24), he was twice mentioned in despatches “for his activities off the Burma coast”.\n\nEarly in 1945 he fell sick and was posted ashore to join Louis Mountbatten’s staff at South East Asia Command (SEAC) in Kandy, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), where he “assisted in the planning of the invasion of Malaya.”\n\nAfter the war he served in HMS Seagull, where one of his fellow officers was former COPPist Geoffrey Hall (Hall, 1999, p. 106). After a brief stint standing by Dalrymple while it was converted at Devonport, he returned to Seagull.\n\nIn January 1949 he was appointed commanding officer of survey motor launches working independently along the east coast of the UK, before in August the same year being given command of HMS Sharpshooter, which also worked on the east coast, carrying out wreck sweeping.\n\nHe then served ashore:\n\nas Equipment Officer in the Hydrographic Department (March 1951 to 1953)\n\n‘on loan’ to the Joint Intelligence Board (1953–1955)\n\nin the Flood Warning Service (1955 until his retirement in July 1957).\n\nIn civilian life, he became an assistant hydrographic surveyor with the Port of Bristol Authority before in 1964 transferring to be Conservator and Engineer to the Humber Conservancy Board.\n\nAfter retiring, he lived in Shoreham-by-Sea.\n\nWilliam Blenkinsop was part of the COPP 7 team that at short notice conducted reconnaissance of the river Elba in April 1945. He was later earmarked to go to south-east Asia with COPP 5 but, with the situation in that theatre improving, reportedly didn’t leave the UK before being released from COPP in mid-August 1945.\n\nBlenkinsop was called up as an ordinary seaman on 15 July 1942 and did his initial training at shore base HMS Collingwood. He was living at an address in Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham when called up.\n\nTraining at HMS Vernon, HMS Royal Arthur in Skegness and HMS Shrapnel in Letchworth followed — while at Shrapnel Blenkinsop qualified as a specialist Wireman (Electrical Gear) on 20 November 1942.\n\nHe finished his training on 18 January 1943 and was posted to the HMS Drake barracks in Plymouth for a brief holding period before joining Combined Operations on 6 February 1943.\n\nHe spent a brief period at HMS Northney, the landing craft base on Hayling Island not far from COPP Depot, then was at the Combined Training Centre (CTC) at HMS Quebec in Inveraray, Scotland, and HMS Dartmouth, a boat-training school.\n\nPosted to HMS Copra (Combined Operations Pay, Records and Accounts) on 5 July 1943, he subsequently served in a number of landing craft assault flotillas.\n\nHowever, from 1 January 1944 he was posted to SS Mecklenburg, a peace-time ferry that had been converted to become an LSI(H) — Landing Ship Infantry (Hand Hoisted) — that could transport landing craft to the assault area before lowering them into the water. On D-Day, Mecklenburg and Blenkinsop were off Juno Beach, having carried across six LCAs from 511 Assault Flotilla.\n\nBlenkinsop returned to landing craft flotillas on 1 July 1944 and stayed in that capacity until 9 March 1945.\n\nAfter what is likely to have been a period of extended leave, he joined COPP 7 on 3 April 1945 and was one of the men involved in a last-minute ‘rush job’ recce ahead of the Elbe river crossing.\n\nOn 1 July 1945 he was reallocated to COPP 5, which was earmarked for service in south-east Asia, but then released on 14 August without, according to family members, leaving the UK.\n\nFrom 26 August to 26 September he was on the roll of HMS Dragonfly, a landing craft ‘suspense base’ on Hayling Island that COPP Depot was by then administered through. Although possibly released from service on 26 September, he remained ‘on the books’ of HMS Copra until 3 April 1946.\n\nJohn Bowden served in the Royal Navy with service number P/JX 153781. As an Able Seaman, he was part of the first iteration of COPP 6 for Sicily. He is known to have taken part in:\n\nreconnaissance near Gela, Sicily, aboard HMS Unison from 1–7 June 1943\n\nreconnaissance near Licata, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 24 June–1 July 1943\n\nbeach marking of Bark West sector during Operation Husky on 9–10 July 1943, operating from HMS Unrivalled — for which he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal (DSM), gazetted on 7 December 1943\n\nreconnaissance near Capo Colonna, Italy, from 24 July–7 August 1943 from HMS Unseen.\n\nHe was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) “for great bravery and enterprise” during Sicilian operations.\n\nHe remained with COPP 6 after it returned to Europe, and is listed in the nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being a Leading Seaman.\n\nHe played an active part in D-Day pilotage, and afterwards remained with COPP 6 for its second Mediterranean iteration.\n\nIn April 1945 he was recalled from leave and assigned to the hastily assembled COPP 7 team for the Elbe River crossing because “he was the only rating available with operational experience” (Trenowden, 1995, p. 147).\n\nHe attended the COPP memorial dedication in September 2012. The COPP memorial lists him as having been mentioned in despatches, although this is not mentioned in Stealthily by Night.\n\nNigel Clogstoun-Willmott was the ‘father’ of COPP. An officer in the Royal Navy, he was a Lieutenant in 1941 when he initiated covert reconnaissance of beaches proposed for a British invasion of Rhodes. He was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his work.\n\nIn 1942, ahead of Operation Torch — the British and American invasion of French-held territories in North Africa — he was at short-notice asked to throw together a team to carry out limited reconnaissance and pilotage, known as Party Koodoo–Inhuman. By this time he was a Lieutenant Commander, and he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for his work, which included reconnaissance of the ‘Hamble’ area near Algiers.\n\nAfter Operation Torch, he was asked to establish COPP on a formal footing. He didn’t take a personal role in the surveys and pilotage for the invasion of Sicily soon afterwards, but was involved in operations with COPP 1 ahead of the D-Day landings in Normandy:\n\nHe took part in Operation KJH (for which he was mentioned in despatches) on 31 December 1943–1 January 1944.\n\nHe took part in Operation Postage Able on 17–21 January 1944.\n\nHis desire to play a role on D-Day itself was thwarted after he was hospitalised by a duodenal ulcer (Galwey, 1992, p. 113). He was awarded a second DSC for his work in the D-Day preparations.\n\nHe is listed as having attended the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nRead Nigel Clogstoun-Willmott’s in-depth profile\n\nAlec Colson was born in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) in India, in 1921. His son, artist Richard Colson, has produced a website about him with some fantastic photos. You can find out more about:\n\nhis early life including his time at university (external link)\n\nhis initial period in the Royal Engineers (external link)\n\nhis time in COPP (external link).\n\nHe completed his officer training and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a 2nd Lieutenant in February 1942 with the service number 226289.\n\nHe later became an instructor at 140 OCTU (Officer Cadet Training Unit) in Newark, Nottinghamshire.\n\nAs an instructor in the miltary duties wing, he would take each class of cadets through its first six weeks: drill, mathematics, fieldcraft, tactics. The last of the seven weeks he’d spend with the course at the Battle Camp, at Penmaenmawr. Each class then went on with its Sapper training programme: demolitions, mine-warfare, bridging etc. [But] once the Battle Camp was over Alec went back to start a new class on its seven weeks.\n\n(Trenowden, 1995, p. 103)\n\nHe decided to volunteer for special duties after reading an account of the Dieppe raid (external link) (Trenowden, 1995, p. 103). He joined COPP in May 1943 at the same time as Logan Scott-Bowden. Details of how he joined are given in his recruitment case study elsewhere on this site.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as E/COPP in COPP 8 which saw operations in south-east Asia (Arakan, Sumatra and abortively in the Andamans).\n\nOperations he was known to be involved in are:\n\nreconnaissance of Akyab in October 1943 — replacing COPP 7’s E/COPP, Bill Lucas, who was in India recovering from malaria\n\nOperation Frippery, reconnaissance of Sumatra (in modern-day Indonesia) — August 1944 — carried out with COPP 7, he seems to have acted as an additional Royal Engineers officer alongside Lucas\n\nOperation David — reconnaissance of Elizabeth Island (known as Kyunthaya Island) in October 1944\n\nOperation Deputy — a follow-up operation on Elizabeth Island carried out in November 1944.\n\nHe named his canoe Jenny Wren (Colson, 2006, p. 6). He was awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire).\n\nColson remained in the army until 1960, including a spell at the Staff College, Camberley. Then, after two years at Tundale Hall Theological College in Bristol, he was ordained in 1962 and spent 24 years in parish ministry before retiring in 1986 (Colson, 2006, p. 38–39).\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nWhen he joined the Burma Star Association in 1991 (external link), he was living in Lyng, Norfolk.\n\nHe passed away in 2007.\n\nGodfrey Courtney — nicknamed ‘Gruff’ — was a Captain in the Queen’s Own Royal West Kent Regiment with service number 58298.\n\nIn September 1942 he was one of the SBS members attached to Party Koodoo–Inhuman, operations conducted by the embryonic COPP surrounding Operation Torch, the amphibious assault on Vichy French territories in North Africa.\n\nAfter arriving in Gibraltar for training, he was detached from Party Koodoo–Inhuman for a top-secret mission that US General Mark Clark undertook ahead of Operation Torch, landing in Algiers on a highly political mission (external link) to try and elicit French support for the forthcoming invasion. Clark’s party included as escort three men from 2 SBS who were part of Party Koodoo–Inhuman — Courtney, James Foot and Richard Livingstone. All three were awarded the MBE (external link) in recognition of their role. It’s unclear whether he was able to return to Party Koodoo–Inhuman in time to take part in beach marking for Operation Torch.\n\nIn May–June 1943 he took part in Operation Marigold, ‘fake’ beach reconnaissance of Sardinia carried out as an attempted diversion from Sicily ahead of Operation Husky.\n\nHe had joined 2 SBS in an administrative capacity before moving to the operational side. He later formed Z SBS and went with them as a Major and their commander to South East Asia. Awarded an MBE and the Military Cross (Quigley, 1944, p. 2).\n\nNot listed in Stealthily by Night, Christopher Dalgety is elsewhere listed as M/COPP of COPP 9 in April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b). At that point he was a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\nBorn in 1907, he was “an Antarctic explorer and director of the New Zealand Dalgety Company” (Galwey, 1992, p. 114). The expeditions referred to by Geoff Galwey included Lapland (1926, 1930 and 1932), Edgeøya/Edge Island in the Barents Sea (1927), Vadsø, Norway (1928), Spitsbergen, which is located not far from Edgeøya/Edge Island (1930 and 1931), and Greenland and Baffin Land, now known as Baffin Island, in Canada (1934).\n\nBefore the war he also wrote a number of ornithology books.\n\nOn 2 March 1940 he was a 2nd Lieutenant with 148 Company, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC). He was promoted to Lieutenant on 2 September 1941 and became Acting Captain on 1 March 1942.\n\nOn 7 October 1942 he switche to become a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) — a lieutenant in the navy was equivalent in rank to a captain the army. He relinquished his army commission on 6 December 1942 and was confirmed in the RNVR the following day.\n\nFrom 6 December 1942 to 30 March 1943 he was connected with 14 Commando, then from 19 July 1943 to 16 April 1945 was attached to HMS Quebec, a ‘stone frigate’ shore establishment that was a Combined Operations Training Centre in Inveraray, on the banks of Loch Fyne, during which his service with COPP occurred.\n\nAhead of the Normandy D-Day operations, when it was planned to use a dinghy launched from the X-craft midget submarines to help mark the beaches, Dalgety worked with the diving bosun at HMS Dolphin to help devise a special valve and oxygen bottle that would allow the dinghies to be blown up, it having been decided that CO2 cylinders wouldn’t be taken on board (Galwey, 1992, p. 114).\n\nHe also worked with Galwey to devise ‘taut string gear’ that would help accurately place the dinghies (Galwey, 1992, p. 115).\n\nIn 1963 he was living in Ringwood, Hampshire. He is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nHe passed away in 1980.\n\nMuch of the information in this profile has been taken from a family history website (external link) created by his son.\n\nGeoffrey Danne was a Lieutenant in the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RANVR).\n\nBorn on 4 July 1920 in Kew, Victoria in Australia, he was confirmed in the rank of Sub-Lieutenant on 22 January 1942 (White, 2015, p. 1210).\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as M/COPP of a COPP 5 team that seems to have never become operational. He was Sub-Lieutenant at that time, promoted to Lieutenant on 22 July 1944 (White, 2015, p. 1210).\n\nSome of the personnel from this ‘non-operational’ COPP 5 team seem to have shifted to COPP 9 in the Mediterranean and Far East. Danne doesn’t seem to have been among them, judging by sources I have seen. However, he was apparently posted to HMS Lanka, the ‘stone frigate’ shore establishment for Combined Operations personnel in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), on 10 November 1944 (White, 2015, p. 1210).\n\nThere’s therefore a bit of uncertainty over whether he ever saw active service with COPP.\n\nHe continued with the RANVR after the war and is reported to have died on 20 October 1986 (White, 2015, p. 1210).\n\nBasil Eckhard was a Captain in The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) who volunteered for special service with 2 SBS.\n\nHe joined 2 SBS on 21 May 1942, transferring from the Special Operations Executive (SOE)’s Inter Services Research Bureau (ISRB) (external link), where they developed radios, weapons, explosive devices and booby traps.\n\nIn September 1942, when he was a Lieutenant, he was one of the SBS members attached to Party Koodoo–Inhuman, operations conducted by the embryonic COPP surrounding Operation Torch, the amphibious assault on Vichy French territories in North Africa. He was mentioned in despatches for his work on this operation.\n\nStealthily by Night says he was given a King’s Commendation but doesn’t make it explicitly clear what for.\n\nHe was training officer upon COPP’s formation in late 1942:\n\n[…] the first arrivals at the depot […] were SBS, part trained by Roger Courtney and his younger brother Jumbo (alias Gruff), and were not in intensive COPP training under Basil Eckhard.\n\n(Galwey, 1992, p. 99)\n\nIn December 1943, when he attended a meeting at Combined Operations Headquarters in London to discuss the methods that COPP would use to survey the Operation Overlord beaches (DEFE 2/1059), he was listed as part of COPP Depot staff. He was a Captain at that time.\n\nHe was later chief instructor to 2 SBS (Quigley, 1944, p. 2), a position he retained until at least February 1944 (Quigley, 1944, p. 6).\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977. Passed away in February 2011 (CVA, 2011).\n\nA Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, Eric Folder was part of COPP/ME 1. He took part in Sicily reconnaissance in February–March 1943. He and Archie Hart launched a survey operation on the night of 8–9 March 1943 but failed to return to HMS United.\n\nStealthily by Night says that they were “never seen again” (Trenowden, 1995, p. 58). However, Commandos and Rangers of World War II suggests they were captured. It describes how Hart and Folder:\n\n[…] had made a rough-and tumble landing in heavy surf near Gela. Archie Hart’s suit filled and perhaps incautiously he made a dash for the shelter of some dunes, where he hoped to drain it out. Unfortunately he ran into barbed wire that twanged a warning which brought a sentry along the beach, and Archie Hart was captured.\n\nEric Folder was caught next day by two German guards in a fishing smack.\n\n(Ladd, 1978, p. 66)\n\nAccording to Hart (The National Archives, KV 2/77), Folder managed to sink their canoe before being captured.\n\nBoth were taken to an interrogation camp (RG 50) in Rome where they shared a room with G. H. Davies and Theodore Schürch, a ‘stool pigeon’ who was feeding information to the Italians and Germans (The National Archives, KV 2/76 and KV 2/77).\n\nAlthough Hart managed to escape and return to Britain following the surrender of the Italians in September 1943, it’s unknown whether Folder managed to do the same.\n\nJames Foot — normally called ‘Jimmy’ — was born on 14 August 1921. He was in regular service with the Dorsetshire Regiment with the service number 189391 before joining 2 SBS as a 2nd Lieutenant on 29 April 1943 (Quigley, 1944, p. 1). That year is almost certainly incorrect as in September 1942 he was one of the SBS members attached to Party Koodoo–Inhuman, operations conducted by the embryonic COPP surrounding Operation Torch, the amphibious assault on Vichy French territories in North Africa.\n\nAfter arriving in Gibraltar for training, he was detached from Party Koodoo–Inhuman for a top-secret mission that US General Mark Clark undertook in 1942 ahead of Operation Torch, landing in Algiers on a highly political mission (external link) to try and elicit French support for the forthcoming invasion. Clark’s party included as escort three men from 2 SBS who were with Party Koodoo–Inhuman — Foot, Godfrey ‘Gruff’ Courtney and Richard Livingstone. All three were awarded the MBE (external link) in recognition of their role.\n\nWith Livingstone, he was also involved in the follow-up mission (external link) just a few days later that facilitated General Giraud’s escape from house arrest by the Vichy French authorities (Seymour, 2006, p. 99). They didn’t return to port until 10 November 1942 (Courtney, 2017, p. 71) so would have been unable to return to Party Koodoo–Inhuman and take part in beach marking for Operation Torch.\n\nStealthily by Night suggests he was already a Lieutenant by the time of Party Koodoo–Inhuman.\n\nBy February 1944 he was on the headquarters staff of 2 SBS as an operational officer (Quigley, 1944, p. 6).\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nA Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), Geoff Galwey was M/COPP in the inaugural COPP 1 and took part in Operation KJH, reconnaissance of one of the Normandy landing beaches, on 31 December 1943–1 January 1944.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him with the rank of Lieutenant and still as M/COPP in COPP 1.\n\nOn D-Day, 6 June 1944, accompanied by Arthur Briggs and Cecil Fish, he carried out assault pilotage for Juno Beach from a motor launch (Trenowden, 1995, p. 143). After their pilotage work was completed, they rendezvoused with midget sub X-20 — which had been carrying out beach marking — before risking reprimand by landing on one of the beaches (Galwey, 1992, p. 118—121).\n\nGalwey had been invalided out of the Royal Navy as a midshipman after developing rheumatic fever following an airplane crash. He joined the RNVR after the outbreak of hostilities and was theoretically restricted to ‘home, shore and harbour service’ only — but that didn’t stop him from being involved in COPP operations.\n\nHe was at a Combined Operations training base in Largs, Scotland — where he met and became friends with Nick Hastings, who later introduced him to Nigel Clogstoun-Willmott (Galwey, 1992, p. 92–93) — before playing a key role in setting up and maintaining COPP Depot at Hayling Island Sailing Club from January 1943.\n\nAfter D-Day, he accepted Nick Hastings’ offer to become training officer at Hayling Island (Galwey, 1992, p. 121).\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nRead Geoff Galwey’s in-depth profile\n\nNot mentioned in Stealthily by Night, in September 1942 John Gilmour was a Corporal and one of the SBS members attached to Party Koodoo–Inhuman, operations conducted by the embryonic COPP surrounding Operation Torch, the amphibious assault on Vichy French territories in North Africa (Courtney, 2017, p. 71).\n\nThe Herald, a Scottish newspaper, carried an obituary following his death, at the age of 94, on 5 March 2010. The following details are from there.\n\nHe was born on 29 September 1915 and served in the 79th (Scottish Horse) Regiment, Royal Artillery, from May 1940. He volunteered for special service and in November 1940 joined the 5th Special Services Battalion.\n\nIn early 1941 he was posted to 101 Troop, 6 Commando, which in April 1942 was absorbed into 2 SBS.\n\nAfter Operation Torch, from March 1943 he served in ‘Z’ SBS, consisting of only five canoe pairs, attached to the 8th Submarine Flotilla based in Algiers. His acting promotion to Sergeant was confirmed in May 1943.\n\nHis activities in the Mediterranean earned him the Military Medal. They included May 1943 when he was involved in Operation Marigold, a ‘deception and snatch’ raid on the east coast of Sardinia, and beach reconnaissance and marking for the landings at Salerno, south of Naples, in September 1943 (Operation Avalanche).\n\nHe stayed with ‘Z’ SBS when they moved to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) but was then rushed back to the Mediterranean as part of a team “to carry out simulated beach reconnaissance for strategic deception purposes in the Greek Peloponnese”.\n\nHe and his team leader Captain Eric ‘Sally’ Lunn landed by canoe from HMS Sybil on the south coast of Cephalonia on the night of 23 March, 1944. Having deliberately left traces of a recce, they attempted to launch their canoe, but it foundered in worsening weather and heavy surf.\n\nThey decided to make for the hills and attempt to get in touch with a partisan organisation. Cold and drenched by the sea, the pair soon encountered a German sentry. He was quickly overpowered, but not before his shouts raised the alarm. Under fire, they escaped in the dark but were separated, meeting up three days later at the HQ of the local Resistance group. Gilmour in particular, with his sandy-coloured hair and Scottish accent, had a hard time proving his identity and initially received a hostile reception.\n\nIn spite of enemy vigilance, cold, lack of food and the need to travel on foot over about 250 miles of mountainous territory, he and Captain Lunn, aided by the Resistance, managed to get to Ithaca, and then to the Greek mainland, undetected. They eventually made their way to the British Military Mission where transport to Italy was arranged and they returned to Malta 37 days after their departure.\n\nGilmour was awarded a second Military Medal and returned to Ceylon for further operations.\n\nAfter the war he resumed his occupation as a shoe repairer before retiring at the age of 80.\n\nKnown during the war by his middle name as Basil Griffith, afterwards he preferred to be called John Griffith. He had commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a 2nd Lieutenant with the service number 193215 in August 1941.\n\nAs a Captain, he was with COPP 4 in south-east Asia as E/COPP, later being replaced by Bill Kingston. He is shown as being with COPP 4 in the nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b).\n\nAfter returning to the UK as a Major, he ‘filled in’ as E/COPP for COPP 7 as their designated E/COPP, John Ashford, had been sent to south-east Asia. He was involved in Elbe river reconnaissance in April 1945.\n\nHe became managing director of the shipbuilding firm Dunstons, which built the schooner Sir Winston Churchill (external link).\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977. In October 1987 he wrote to Alec Colson:\n\n[…] my time with COPP was by no means a high-spot of my life and my recollections of some of my military experiences before and after are more vivid. This is not [to] say that the COPP period was devoid of things I would hate to have missed.\n\n(quoted in Colson, no date)\n\nA Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve who was a member of COPP/ME 1. Archie Hart took part in Sicily reconnaissance in February–March 1943. He and Eric Folder launched a survey operation on the night of 8–9 March 1943 but failed to return to HMS United.\n\nStealthily by Night says that they were “never seen again” (Trenowden, 1995, p. 58). However, both were taken prisoner. Commandos and Rangers of World War II describes how Hart and Folder:\n\n[…] had made a rough-and tumble landing in heavy surf near Gela. Archie Hart’s suit filled and perhaps incautiously he made a dash for the shelter of some dunes, where he hoped to drain it out. Unfortunately he ran into barbed wire that twanged a warning which brought a sentry along the beach, and Archie Hart was captured.\n\nEric Folder was caught next day by two German guards in a fishing smack.\n\n(Ladd, 1978, p. 66)\n\nAccording to Hart (The National Archives, KV 2/77), Folder managed to sink their canoe before being captured.\n\nBoth were taken to an interrogation camp (RG 50) in Rome where they shared a room with G. H. Davies and Theodore Schürch, a ‘stool pigeon’ who was feeding information to the Italians and Germans (The National Archives, KV 2/76 and KV 2/77). In late 1945 Hart gave evidence at Schürch’s court martial, which resulted in Schürch’s execution.\n\nBefore the war, Hart played football for Scottish side Third Lanark (external link) in Glasgow. He players 60 matches for them as an outside right. They were one of the leading sides in Scotland but folded in the mid-1960s. It’s possible that he lived in Glasgow, too — in August 1945, when authorities were attempting to talk to him about Schürch, he was on leave in the city.\n\nA Royal Engineer with service number 2162287, Jack Hinkley was in the first iteration of COPP 4. He may have supported both COPP 3 and COPP 4 until COPP 3 relocated to Malta in February 1943, at which point he remained with COPP 4 in Algeria (IWM 20636 66-340-1).\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 shows him as being a sapper draughtsman attached to COPP 9 (COPP Heroes, no date, b).\n\nAlthough he’s not listed in the main Stealthily by Night personnel list as part of it, there is also a suggestion that he was part of the second-iteration COPP 5 team that carried out reconnaissance of the Rhine (Trenowden, 1995, p. 146). At that time, he was a Lance Corporal.\n\nGiven that the composition of COPP 5 was largely unchanged between its second and third iterations, it’s possible that he also went with them to south-east Asia, albeit arriving too late for active operations.\n\nHowever, on 11 April 1945, Jack Crane (Crane, 1945, p. 109) noted that COPP 5 was at COPP Depot and listed Eric Page, a Royal Engineers sergeant. He didn’t list Hinkley.\n\nFrom Pittenweem near Fife in Scotland, before the war he was in the Merchant Navy, sailing with the Clan Line. He volunteered for the Royal Naval Reserve before the outbreak of the war and, presumably because of his experience, was appointed probationary Sub-Lieutenant on 29 March 1939 at the age of 24 (Trenowden, 1995, p. 155—156).\n\nAfter training at HMS St Vincent and a spell at Combined Operations base HMS Appledore — both ‘stone frigate’ shore establishments — he joined the escort carrier HMS Slinger upon its commissioning in August 1943 (Trenowden, 1995, p. 156).\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as being with that team undergoing training at COPP Depot.\n\nOperations he is known to have been involved with were:\n\nAkyab (Sittwe) reconnaissance on 31 December 1944 and 1 January 1945\n\nAkyab (Sittwe) assault pilotage on 3 January 1945\n\ndemolition of stakes and assault pilotage for Operation Pungent, landings in Myebon, on 11–12 January 1945\n\nOperation Baboon — reconnaissance in Phuket, Siam (now Thailand) from 8–11 March 1945.\n\nHe was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).\n\nFellow COPP 3 member Arthur Ruberry — who was Hughes’ regular paddler — commented: “Alex was a very experienced navigator, and being Royal Naval Reserve, he was very enthusiastic” (quoted in Trenowden, 1995, p. 157).\n\nWhen he joined the Burma Star Association in 1972 (external link), he gave his final rank as Lieutenant Commander. He was living at the time in Wimpstone in Stratford-on-Avon.\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nClifford Irvine was a Leading Seaman with the service number P/SSX 19199 (COPP Heroes, no date, b; The National Archives, KV 2/76) who was part of the inaugural COPP 4. He took part in Sicily reconnaissance in February–March 1943 but was captured on 3 March while paddling along the coast after his surveyor, Ted Parsons, failed to return to the canoe (Ladd, 1978, p. 66).\n\nFollowing the Italians’ surrender in September 1943, Irvine presumably managed to escape and returned to Britain. He spoke with investigators about Theodore Schürch, a ‘stool pigeon’ who was feeding information to the Italians and Germans (The National Archives, KV 2/76 and KV 2/77). This hints that he may have at least initially been held in the same camp as Hart, Folder and Davies.\n\nIrvine rejoined COPP. A note in December 1943 stated that he was “now borne on the books of Victory and is in Portsmouth barracks” — cryptically adding that “his duties will call for his being absent from barracks from time to time” (The National Archives, KV 2/76).\n\nHe became part of COPP 2. Operations he is known to have taken part in are:\n\nOperation Brassard — beach marking for the invasion of Elba — June 1944\n\nreconnaissance near Sarandë in Albania — September 1944\n\nDubrovnik reconnaissance in Yugoslavia — October 1944\n\npre-Operation Roast reconnaissance on Lake Comacchio — March 1945\n\nfurther Lake Comacchio reconnaissance — April 1945.\n\nA Captain in the Royal Engineers who had been awarded the Military Cross, William Johns better know as ‘Johnnie’ Johns. He was E/COPP in COPP 3 during its Far East recommission.\n\nFrom Eltham in London and an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA), he was attached to 2 Special Boat Section (SBS) before joining COPP.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as undergoing training with COPP 3 at COPP Depot.\n\nOperations he is known to have been involved with were:\n\nAkyab (Sittwe) reconnaissance on 31 December 1944 and 1 January 1945\n\ndemolition of stakes for Operation Pungent, landings in Myebon, on 11–12 January 1945\n\nOperation Baboon — reconnaissance in Phuket, Siam (now Thailand) from 8–11 March 1945.\n\nHe was killed in action in Phuket on 9 March 1945. He was 31 years old at the time. He is commemorated at Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore (CWGC — external link).\n\nIn his autobiography, Lawrence Hornby — who was the supply officer at Hammenhiel Camp where COPP in south-east Asia was based — recalled a “Captain Johns, an army officer in the Special Boat Section”. Hornby wrote that Johns:\n\nwas one of the most charming and kindly men I have ever met. His whole demeanour and personality were inspiring. He had a beautiful speaking voice, a twinkling smile, and brown curly hair. I spent one evening gossiping with him in his tent — an evening of enormous fun and good talk. The next day he was off on an operation, three days later he was dead. I mourn for Captain Johns to this day.\n\n(Hornby, 1984, p. 14—15)\n\nRoyal Naval Volunteer Reserve. As a Lieutenant, Douglas Kent was with COPP 5 as A/COPP for their commission in Sicily, Italy and Salerno. He earned a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for his work with them.\n\nOperations he is known to have taken part in are:\n\nreconnaissance near Avola, Sicily, aboard HMS Unruffled from 24–29 June 1943\n\npilotage during the Operation Husky landings, 9–10 July 1943\n\nreconnaissance in the Gulf of Goia, Italy, aboard HMS Shakespeare from 25 July–9 August 1943.\n\nHis senior officer in COPP 5, Ralph Stanbury, described him as:\n\n[…] my assistant on the naval side of things. A volunteer in the RNVR, expert on Combined Operations, he could never quite overcome his impetuosity or his resentment at any apparent delay. He was at time embarrassingly frank and outspoken. Although 23 years old […] he looked no more than 18, with his boyish face, rosy cheeks, and round blue eyes.\n\nHe was as courageous as a lion and was miserable unless his was in the thick of the fray.\n\n(Stanbury, 1949, p. 22)\n\nIn the nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b), he is shown as being COPP Depot’s training officer. Richard Fyson recalls that Kent supported Nick Hastings providing training to the second iteration of COPP 2 during the winter of 1943–44 (IWM Documents.16381).\n\nKent had already earned an initial DSC in 1942 when, according to the Commando Veterans website (external link) he was part of Royal Naval Beach Commandos ‘Charlie’ during Operation Abercrombie (external link), a 4 Commando raid on Hardelot, near Boulogne in France, to gather prisoners and destroy enemy equipment including a searchlight battery. He was a Sub-Lieutenant at that time and acted as a beachmaster (Trenowden, 1995, p. 17). The Commando Veterans website also reports (external link) that he had taken part in Commando raids on Lofoten (4 March 1941) and Vaagso (27 December 1941), both in Norway.\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nAn officer in the Royal Ulster Rifles with the service number 149081, Richard Livingstone joined 2 SBS on 5 May 1942, transferring from 6 Commando.\n\nIn September 1942, when he was a Captain, he was one of the 2 SBS members attached to Party Koodoo–Inhuman, operations conducted by the embryonic COPP surrounding Operation Torch, the amphibious assault on Vichy French territories in North Africa.\n\nAfter arriving in Gibraltar for training, he was detached from Party Koodoo–Inhuman for a top-secret mission that US General Mark Clark undertook ahead of Operation Torch, landing in Algiers on a highly political mission (external link) to try and elicit French support for the forthcoming invasion. Clark’s party included as escort three men from 2 SBS who were with Party Koodoo–Inhuman — Livingstone, James Foot and Godfrey ‘Gruff’ Courtney. All three were awarded the MBE (external link) in recognition of their role.\n\nWith Foot, he was also involved in the follow-up mission (external link) just a few days later that facilitated General Giraud’s escape from house arrest by the Vichy French authorities (Seymour, 2006, p. 99). He was reportedly mentioned in despatches at around this time, too — presumably for his role in this follow-up (Quigley, 1944, p. 1). They didn’t return to port until 10 November 1942 (Courtney, 2017, p. 71) so would have been unable to return to Party Koodoo–Inhuman and take part in beach marking for Operation Torch.\n\nWas later “chief instructor of the SBS” (Quigley, 1944, p. 1) and second in command of 2 SBS as at February 1944 (Quigley, 1944, p. 6).\n\nBy September/October 1944 he was a Major and his SBS unit was part of the Small Operations Group (SOG) that included the COPP teams in south-east Asia, stationed at Hammenhiel Camp in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) (Trenowden, 1995, p. 158—160).\n\nIn his autobiography, Lawrence Hornby — who was the supply officer at Hammenhiel Camp — recalled Livingstone as “the most outstanding and distinguished personality in SOG”. He was:\n\nthe son of Sir Richard Livingstone, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and he was the grandson of the great missionary [David Livingstone, presumably]. I have never, in my entire life, met a man of such towering talents. To start with, he was six foot seven inches tall [200 cm].\n\nHe had a first class honours degree in philosophy and one of my greatest pleasures — in all my life — was to be invited to Dicky’s tent for a ‘Plato’ session. He used to declaim parts of The Republic and get us to answer him, as Socrares, or Archibiades, and so on. This would last for three to four hours, and my contact with Livingstone over the two years of my stay in Ceylon greatly enriched the intellectual side of my life, and inspired me, at a later date to reach successfully for an Honours Degree. […]\n\nDicky Livingstone fired me with his high standards and his friendship.\n\n(Hornby, 1984, p. 15)\n\nA Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, Lionel Lyne was more often known by his middle name as Geoffrey Lyne. He was captured by the Vichy French while carrying out pre-Operation Torch reconnaissance (Trenowden, 1995, p. 201) with Party Koodoo–Inhuman.\n\nWhen COPP was officially constituted, he was S/COPP in COPP 9.\n\nIn December 1943, when he attended a meeting at Combined Operations Headquarters in London to discuss the methods that COPP would use to survey the Operation Overlord beaches (DEFE 2/1059), he was listed as a Lieutenant.\n\nOn D-Day, June 1944, he was with Jim Booth in X-23 carrying out beach marking on Sword Beach as part of Operation Gambit.\n\nStealthily by Night says that he returned to the Normandy beaches with Bill Tebb as bodyguard (Trenowden, 1995, p. 142). However, details about the loan of three COPP 9 ratings to Force ‘S’ make me wonder about the accuracy of this.\n\nAfter leaving COPP, he was mentioned in despatches for his work on board HMS Courier, minesweeping in the Elbe and Weser river areas in March—June 1945.\n\nLater as an acting Commander he was awarded an OBE as Queen’s Harbour Master, Port Said, for his actions during the Suez crisis.\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nAs an Able Seaman, James McGuire served in the Mediterranean.\n\nStealthily by Night suggests he was part of the first iteration of COPP/ME 2, and he certainly went on an operation with that team.\n\nHowever, Rollo Mangnall suggests that he was part of the main COPP unit, relocating from Algeria to Malta with COPP 3 in February 1943 (IWM Documents.20636). Before that move, he may have been available to both COPP 3 and COPP 4 while in Algeria.\n\nHe was captured by an armed fishing vessel during Sicily reconnaissance on the night of 8–9 March 1943 but subsequently escaped, for which he was awarded a British Empire Medal (Trenowden, 1995, p. 61).\n\nOnce back in the UK, he spoke with investigators about Theodore Schürch, a ‘stool pigeon’ who was feeding information to the Italians and Germans (The National Archives, KV 2/76 and KV 2/77). This hints that he may have at least initially been held in the same camp as Hart, Folder and Davies.\n\nHe subsequently returned to COPP action. The nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as a Leading Seaman with the service number P/JX 162354 who was “at COPP Depot undergoing training prior to being allocated” to a COPP team or “held at the Depot” as a replacement.\n\nHe later became a Petty Officer and served with COPP 9 in the Mediterranean and Far East.\n\nPossibly originally from Paisley in the suburbs of Glasgow (The National Archives, KV 2/76).\n\nA Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Navy, Denis Mackay was S/COPP of COPP 4 for its recommission in the Arakan.\n\nHe was born in Nelson in New Zealand (White, 2015, p. 1211).\n\nBefore joining COPP, he had been mentioned in despatches for “courage, skill and endurance while minesweeping in dangerous waters” in the North Sea aboard HMS Sidmouth in December 1941 and January 1942 (gazetted on 31 March 1942 — external source).\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being with COPP 4 on that date.\n\nFor his work with COPP, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) (gazetted on 10 July 1945).\n\nOperations he is known to have been involved in are:\n\nRuywa reconnaissance on 9–10 February 1945\n\nIn his autobiography, Lawrence Hornby — who was the supply officer at Hammenhiel Camp where COPP in south-east Asia was based — recalled a “young normal Dartmouth entry naval officer” called Lieutenant McKay who “commanded one of the COPP parties”. Hornby goes on to say that ‘Lieutenant McKay’ was killed in action — could he have meant Denis Mackay but got confused about the name and the death? Hornby described him as “light hearted, amusing and friendly man with considerable good looks” (Hornby, 1984, p. 14).\n\nMackay is listed among those who were unable to attend the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nA local newspaper report (external link) suggests that he died in April 2001 in a fire at his retirement flat in Hastings, New Zealand, aged 85.\n\nA New Zealander, Ian Mackenzie was a Major in the Royal Engineers who reportedly initially served in the Royal Artillery after commissioning as a 2nd Lieutenant. He is not listed within the main Stealthily by Night list of COPP personnel. His service nunber was 109400.\n\nHe is listed in the nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being E/COPP in COPP 6 with the rank Captain. He was involved on D-Day when he provided pilotage towards Sword Beach for the Royal Engineers’ ‘Hobart’s Funnies’ tanks (external link) on LCT 947 (Burn, 1947, p. 213).\n\nPeter Palmer says that he was E/COPP within the third iteration of COPP 6 which went to Italy and the South of France.\n\nLater he was COPP’s senior military officer within the Small Operations Group (SOG) in south-east Asia.\n\nDuring reconnaissance of the Pyunshe chaung on 25–26 January 1945, carried out by COPP 1, he led a platoon of Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry that landed on the opposite bank to provide support (DEFE 2/1116).\n\nHe was mentioned in despatches for his role in Operation Copyright in March 1945, but the operation ended with him being taken prisoner and held for the remainder of the war in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nRead Ian Mackenzie’s in-depth profile\n\nUsually known as Charlie Main, he served in the Royal Navy with the service number P/JX 131567.\n\nHe was one of the first group of ratings to join COPP following its formation in November 1942. As a Leading Seaman, he and other ratings may have initially been ‘shared’ between COPP 3 and COPP 4 until COPP 3 relocated to Malta in February 1943 and he went with them (IWM Documents.20636). Operations he is known to have taken part in are:\n\nreconnaissance of Sicily aboard HMS Unbending in February–March 1943 (IWM Documents.2222)\n\nreconnaissance near Scoglitti, Sicily, aboard HMS Unrivalled from 31 May–6 June 1943.\n\nHe was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) “for great bravery and enterprise” for his work relating to Operation Husky.\n\nIn April 1944 he was a Petty Officer with COPP 9 (COPP Heroes, no date, b).\n\nWhile ‘on loan’ to Force ‘S’ for the Normandy D-Day landings, he was killed on 25 June 1944 when the landing craft he was on board, LCH 185, triggered a mine and sank. He is commemorated on panel 81, column 2 of the Portsmouth Naval Memorial (CWGC — external link) as well as on his local war memorial.\n\nA Captain in the Royal Engineers, Peter Matterson was E/COPP in COPP 5 for the Sicily and Salerno operations, and was awarded a Military Cross (MC) for the latter. Operations he is known to have taken part in are:\n\nreconnaissance near Avola, Sicily, aboard HMS Unruffled from 24–29 June 1943\n\nbeach marking during the Operation Husky landings, 9–10 July 1943\n\nreconnaissance in the Gulf of Goia, Italy, aboard HMS Shakespeare from 25 July–9 August 1943.\n\nIn the nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b), he is shown as being COPP Depot’s senior military officer (the senior Royal Engineer within COPP).\n\nIn one place, Stealthily by Night gives his rank as Lieutenant, which seems very low for an E/COPP officer and was presumably an error.\n\nRalph Stanbury described him in Survey by Starlight (Stanbury, 1949, p. 21):\n\n[…] a captain in the Royal Engineers and my guide on all military matters. He was nicknamed ‘Mat’ almost as soon as he joined the party for training.\n\nI don’t think I have ever known anyone so completely painstaking or conscientious as Mat, or anyone whose judgement was so sound.\n\nHe was always immaculately dressed, from the forage-cap perched on his rather round head with its shrewd brown eyes and clipped brown moustache, to his army boots, which he personally polished for at least an hour each night.\n\nHe was also the eldest of the party, and far the most patient.\n\nIt is possible that after the war he rose to become a Colonel — a letter written in 1983 by the author Eric Morris (who wrote the book Churchill’s Private Armies) to COPP veteran Ernest Cooke mentions a ‘Colonel Peter Matterson’ who had helped him on a previous book about Salerno.\n\nHe is listed among those who were unable to attend the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nUsually called Michael Peacock rather than John Peacock, he was a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as A/COPP of COPP 8 which saw operations in south-east Asia (Arakan, Sumatra and abortively in the Andamans). However, he was captured by the Japanese and replaced by Sub-Lieutenant Gambrill. Initially he was “missing believed drowned” (Trenowden, 1995, p. 161).\n\nHe named his canoe Putnoe after the area of Bedford where he lived (Colson, 2006, p. 6). Operations he is known to have taken part in are:\n\nan operation in December 1943\n\nreconnaissance of north-west Sumatra in April 1944 — for which in conjunction with his work in December 1943 he was mentioned in despatches\n\nOperation David — reconnaissance of Elizabeth Island (now known as Kyunthaya Island) in October 1944 — for which he was mentioned in despatches.\n\nHe failed to make the rendezvous at the end of Operation David and was taken prisoner by the Japanese. According to one obituary (Mantell, 2012), the Japanese:\n\n[…] could not understand why a naval officer should be in the jungle. Kept away from other allied prisoners in Rangoon jail and unable to communicate with them, he was nicknamed the Admiral by the British soldiers.\n\nWeakened by recurring tropical disease, he was unable to stand upright for long periods but kept his mental agility by scratching long division sums on his cell wall.\n\n[…] he was eventually repatriated to England and discharged from the navy while still suffering from malaria, beriberi and dysentery.\n\nHe graduated from the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh in 1950 and went into practice, first in King’s Lynn before setting up his own practice in Bedford.\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977. He passed away on 17 June 2012, a day before his 90th birthday (COPP Heroes newsletter, August 2012).\n\nSeems to have been with COPP 6 throughout its existence. Initially Frederick Phillips was a Leading Seaman (service number P/JX 216631) and was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) “for great bravery and enterprise” during the Sicily operations (gazetted on 7 December 1943).\n\nHe is known to have taken part in:\n\nreconnaissance near Marina di Ragusa, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 27 May–1 June 1943\n\nan immediate follow-up recce near Marina di Ragusa, again aboard HMS Unseen, from 1–7 June 1943\n\nreconnaissance near Licata, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 24 June–1 July 1943\n\npilotage to Bark East sector during Operation Husky on 9–10 July 1943\n\nreconnaissance near Capo Colonna, Italy, from 24 July–7 August 1943 from aboard HMS Unseen.\n\nHe is listed in the nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being an Acting Leading Seaman in COPP 6. He played an active part in Sword Beach pilotage on D-Day.\n\nBy the time COPP 6 went to south-east Asia, he had been promoted to Petty Officer.\n\nAccording to fellow COPP 6 member John Francis, Phillips’ nickname was ‘Tubby’:\n\nI often had a go at Tubby and called him a big fat slob whereupon he would adopt a menacing stance and feign an attack. On one occasion I referred to his rank of Petty Officer as confusing. I told him that ‘petty’ meant small or insignificant and in no way could be be described as small but ‘insignificant’ suited him perfectly. He got hold of me round the neck and pretended to throttle me. […] it was no secret that we held Tubby in high regard.\n\n(Francis, 2001, p. 6)\n\nWith the service number P/JX 159324, Arthur Prior was initially an Able Seaman attached to COPP Depot. The nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as attached to COPP 1 as a Leading Seaman.\n\nHe later served as a Petty Officer with COPP 1 in south-east Asia from December 1944 (Crane, 1945).\n\nOperations he is known to have been involved in are:\n\nDalet chaung reconnaissance on 2–3 February 1945\n\nLetpan reconnaissance on 26–27 February 1945\n\nLetpan pilotage on 12–13 March 1945.\n\nWhen he joined the Burma Star Association in 1978 (external link), he was living in Totton, Southampton.\n\nYou can get a sense of his non-COPP Second World War service from the fact that he was awarded the Atlantic Star with France & Germany clasp and the Africa Star, as well as his Burma Star.\n\nHis medals were put up for auction (external link) in 2008 but remained unsold. The information accompanying the sale suggests that he earned the UN Korea Medal while serving in the Fleet Air Arm on board the carrier HMS Triumph (external link) and was again mentioned in despatches. His service number was L/FX 670436. His final rank was Chief Petty Officer.\n\nAn officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and from Windlesham in Surrey, Geoff Richards was “a colourful and fearless character” (Colson, 2006, p. 8) with a “flaming-red beard”.\n\nAs a Lieutenant, the nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as M/COPP of COPP 8 which saw operations in south-east Asia (Arakan, Sumatra and abortively in the Andamans). He was mentioned in despatches for his part in Operation David — reconnaissance of Elizabeth Island (now known as Kyunthaya Island) in October 1944 — and later promoted to Lieutenant Commander.\n\nAlec Colson recalled:\n\nGeoff had had all sorts of experience in his life. He became an interservices swimming champion at the age of 18, while he was in the Royal Marines. Some trouble in the barrack room had led to his being stabbed in the back with a bayonet. The responsibility for the wound did not rest entirely with the man who had struck the blow, and to avoid unpleasantness Geoff had bought himself out of the service.\n\nFor the next 10 years he tried one job after another; he had been a fisherman, waiter, chauffeur and half a dozen other things besides before he joined the Metropolitan Police force.\n\nWhen the war came he decided to join the Royal Navy. He realised that the examining medical officers would be interested in the scar of the bayonet wound and he anticipated their curiosity by preparing a story about an operation for pleurisy.\n\nWhile serving in the besieged port of Tobruk, he had volunteered for a parachute course. As a qualified parachutist he was sent to England to join our unit, which used canoes but no parachutes.\n\n(Colson, 2006, p. 8–9)\n\nHe was also a “superb swimmer. When he swam in Colombo swimming pool, people would sit by the side just to watch the symphony in motion” (Colson, 2006, p. 40).\n\nHe died as COPP 8 was travelling back from Reju Khal to Hammenhiel Camp when he fell from a train in Madras (Chennai) (Trenowden, 1995, p. 164). He was 34 at the time and married. Colson wrote:\n\nHe liked to drive railway engines. He would climb out of the window and along the tops of carriages and persuade the engine driver to have a go.\n\nUnfortunately, in December 1944, he was killed on the return trip to Ceylon as the train went under a bridge.\n\n(Colson, 2006, p. 40)\n\nHe is buried at plot 19, grave 101 in the Madras (St Mary’s) Cemetery in Chennai (CWGC — external link).\n\nNot to be confused with the ‘Richards’ who took part in Operation KJH on 31 December 1943, off La Riviere in Normandy — that Richards was a landing craft crewman.\n\nNot listed in Stealthily by Night, Daniel Riches was seemingly part of COPP 7 for the Elbe river reconnaissance in April 1945.\n\nBorn in Kessingland in Norfolk on 9 January 1924, he was a bricklayer’s labourer before volunteering to join the Royal Navy in October 1942. He had the service number JX 377244.\n\nHe completed his training at HMS Ganges, a ‘stone frigate’ shore establishment, on 8 January 1943. He was then at HMS Dinosaur, a Combined Operations training establishment in Troon, Scotland, that specialised in training for larger landing craft, from 24 January until 15 March 1943, and followed that up by spending a number of days at HMS Lizard, another landing craft base, in Shoreham.\n\nFrom April 1943 for a year he was part of the crew of Landing Craft Infantry (Small) 508, also known as LCI(S) 508.\n\nFrom April to September 1944 he was allocated to HMS Tormentor, one of the major landing craft bases during the D-Day period. Intriguingly, some family history research shared with me by Riches’ family includes mention that this was ‘based at Hayling Island’. Tormentor was actually based nearby, at Warsash on the River Hamble, not on Hayling Island. Given that COPP was based on Hayling Island, could this be an early link that has been mis-recorded on the service record or misinterpreted from it by the researcher? However, there were a number of different landing craft bases on Hayling Island, so it could equally be a misunderstanding connected to one of those.\n\nHe was allocated to HMS Westcliff, in Southend on Sea, from October 1944, and it was during this period that he was definitely connected with COPP in some form. Photographs show him at COPP Depot on Hayling Island in March and May 1945 and with COPP 7 for the Elbe river reconnaissance in April 1945.\n\nHe left HMS Westcliff on 30 September 1945 and, after a brief period attached to HMS Dragonfly on Hayling Island, left Combined Operations. He finished his Second World War service with a spell from December 1945 until June 1946 at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Ford, near Littlehampton in West Sussex.\n\nIn August 1949 he volunteered for the Royal Fleet Reserve in August 1949 and was mobilised on 30 December 1952. From January to November 1953 he served on board HMS Bramble, a minesweeper based in Harwich, Essex. In November and December 1953 he was on board HMS Obedient, a destroyer, until it was placed in reserve.\n\nAfter a spell from January to February 1954 with HMS Mull of Galloway, a depot ship for a minesweeping squadron that was based in Harwich, he was discharged on 20 March 1954.\n\nMany thanks to Pauline Utteridge for sharing this information about her father.\n\nAfter being called up, Arthur Ruberry was immediately posted to Combined Operations as an Able Seaman, training as a coxswain on landing craft (Trenowden, 1995, p. 103). He was subsequently promoted to Leading Seaman.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) lists him as an Acting Leading Seaman, service number P/JX 346643, attached to COPP 3 which was then undergoing training at COPP Depot.\n\nHe was part of COPP 3 for their Far East recommission, acting as coxswain to the team of seamen as well as regular paddler for S/COPP Alex Hughes.\n\nHe was twice mentioned in despatches — once for his work along the Arakan coast, and the second time specifically for his contribution during Operation Confidence.\n\nOperations he is known to have been involved with were:\n\nAkyab (Sittwe) reconnaissance on 31 December 1944 and 1 January 1945\n\ndemolition of stakes and assault pilotage for Operation Pungent, landings in Myebon, on 11–12 January 1945\n\nWhen he joined the Burma Star Association in 1968 (external link), he was living in St Ives in Cornwall. In 1973 — when he posted a message in Dekho!, the association’s newsletter — he was secretary of the West Cornwall Branch.\n\nHe is listed among those who were unable to attend the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nBack to top of page\n\nOne of the inaugural members of Roger Courtney’s ‘folboat troop’ attached to Layforce, Jimmy Sherwood was involved in the reconnaissance of Rhodes, maintaining the canoes and other equipment aboard HMS Triumph while Nigel Clogstoun-Willmott and Roger Courtney carried out the surveys.\n\nThe following information is taken mostly from an Imperial War Museum interview (external link) that was recorded in May 1987 (IWM 9783).\n\nBorn in Southport, Lancashire, in 1918, Sherwood’s father worked for an insurance company. When he was one year old, the family moved to Dublin. He was educated first at a school near Dublin and then in Cheshire, then left education at 16 to become a junior at a flour-milling company.\n\nIn mid-September 1939 he volunteered for service and joined the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) as a lorry driver and motorcycle despatch rider based in Kent.\n\nFeeling bored with his duties, he volunteered for the commandos after a recruiting visit by Roger Courtney and passing an interview that focused on swimming ability, demolition knowledge and boat-handling experience, as well as character assessment.\n\nIn September 1940 he was stationed at Windsor where 8 Troop, 8 Commando was being formed before transferring to Scotland for training at Inveraray, then Largs and then the Isle of Arran.\n\nWhen his troop was judged failing in training and threatened with being disbanded, faced with the prospect of returning to the RASC he volunteered for the folboat section being formed within 8 Commando by Roger Courtney — Sherwood had previous experience having owned a folboat during his time in Dublin. He was by this time a Lance Corporal.\n\nIn early 1941, 8 Commando relocated to Egypt as part of Layforce (external link), as a prelude to taking part in a planned invasion of Rhodes. It was at this point that Nigel Clogstoun-Willmott approached Roger Courtney for his help with a reconnaissance of Rhodes’ planned landing beaches, and Sherwood was selected to go with them on the operation in March and April 1941.\n\nThe Folboat Troop was subsequently renamed the Special Boat Section and carried out operations around the Mediterranean before being absorbed into the Special Air Service (SAS). Sherwood was involved in a notable raid on Benghazi in Libya in September 1942.\n\nSherwood subsequently returned to the UK where 2 SBS was being formed by Courtney, joining the unit as a non-commissioned officer (NCO). By December 1943 he had completed officer training and was with 2 SBS as a 2nd Lieutenant. By February 1944, as a Lieutenant, he was on their headquarters staff as an operational officer (Quigley, 1944, p. 3 and 6).\n\nSubsequently he was involved with 2 SBS on active operations in south-east Asia as part of ‘C’ and ‘A’ Groups within the Small Operations Group (SOG), which COPP was also part of.\n\nHe stayed in the military after the war and was promoted to Captain in January 1952 (external link), when he had the service number 305079 and was with the Royal Ulster Rifles.\n\nA Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, Donald Slater isn’t listed in Stealthily by Night but is mentioned in that book as having joined COPP 6 as a replacement for Sub-Lieutenant Sayce.\n\nHe is listed in the nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being M/COPP in COPP 6. He played an active role in Sword Beach pilotage during the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 (Trenowden, 1995, p. 139—140).\n\nHe stayed with COPP 6 for its South of France and Far East iterations.\n\nBefore joining COPP, he had been called up on 23 December 1939 at the age of 21 and trained as a signalman. He served on board the trawler minesweeper HMT Ash along the east coast of Britain.\n\nIn late 1940 he commissioned as an officer and served at the ‘stone frigate’ shore landing-craft bases HMS Tormentor, on the River Hamble near Warsash, and HMS Northney, on Hayling Island.\n\nHe then moved to Inverary where he acted as a landing craft instructor. This is likely to have been HMS Quebec (external link), which was 1 Combined Training Centre or CTC.\n\nIn mid 1943 he was posted to Plymouth and found himself with “no boat and no facilities”. He volunteered for special duties and was posted to COPP.\n\nAfter the war, he ran a farm at Button’s Green near Cockfield, in Suffolk. He is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nA Royal Engineers draughtsman with the service number 1953343.\n\nAs a Sapper, he was with COPP 5 for Sicily, Italy and Salerno reconnaissance missions.\n\nThe nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as a Lance Corporal in a COPP 5 team that never seems to have become operational. Some of the personnel from this COPP 5 team seem to have shifted to COPP 9 in the Mediterranean and Far East. However, Smith doesn’t seem to have been among them. It’s therefore unknown whether he ever saw active service with COPP.\n\nStealthily by Night says that, as a Corporal, he was part of the COPP 2 team that also served in the Mediterranean. This team had already left the UK by the time Smith was shown in the nominal roll as being part of COPP 5, so if he did join them it would have been as a replacement or addition after the team had left the UK. This dovetails with Richard Fyson’s account of Corporal Smith joining COPP 2 as replacement for Sergeant Blackmore on 30 October 1944 (IWM Documents.16381).\n\nFrom Lerwick, Shetlands, Philip Smith was widely known as Bob Smith. He was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy.\n\nHe was mentioned in despatches (gazetted 26 May 1942), apparently while serving on board the destroyer HMS Sikh.\n\nAs the senior officer in COPP/ME 1, he took part in Sicily reconnaissance in February–March 1943. After missing their rendezvous, he and fellow paddler Brand paddled all the way back to Malta, covering 75 miles (120 km), a feat that earned him a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) (gazetted 4 May 1943).\n\nAccording to COPP/ME member Robin Fletcher, Smith then returned to HMS Saunders where he trained further COPP/ME men. Fletcher recalled that he was “apparently unaffected by his ordeal” during Sicily reconnaissance:\n\nHe had learnt much from his time with the UK group of COPPists, including better equipment for the canoes and better waterproof suits from the swimmers.\n\nIf he had become a COPPist out of a spirit of adventure, he had certainly not been disappointed and this seemed to be the motive of most of the regular officers who joined [COPP], though not always to their career advantage.\n\nMaybe he simply wanted a change from the routine and restriction of big ship life, but he did not give the impression that he was unhappy with the naval life and the only grudge to which he would refer was that he had been beaten as a midshipman for some crime which he claimed he had not committed.\n\nHe was a rather quiet man, resolute as proven and not lacking authority, but he lacked the drive of Willmott who was evidently a hard taskmaster. Anyway, he knew what was required.\n\n(Fletcher, 2007, p. 46)\n\nSome sources have his middle name as ‘Roger’ rather than Robert — even his London Gazette entry for the DSC does this.\n\nA Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, Ralph Stanbury was S/COPP for COPP 5 in the Mediterranean (Sicily and Italy), during which time he earned a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).\n\nSoon after the war, Stanbury wrote Survey by Starlight under the pen name Ralph Neville — the first edition published in 1949. Some of the following information is taken from that book.\n\nBefore joining COPP, he had served on a destroyer during the Norwegian campaign, helping to evacuate troops. He broke his leg and spent six months recovering before joining COPP in February 1943.\n\nOperations he is known to have been part of are:\n\nperiscope reconnaissance near Capo Murro di Porco, Sicily, from 7 June 1943 — aboard HMS Unrivalled\n\nreconnaissance near Avola, Sicily, aboard HMS Unruffled from 24–29 June 1943\n\nbeach marking and pilotage during the Operation Husky landings, 9–10 July 1943\n\nreconnaissance in the Gulf of Goia, Italy, aboard HMS Shakespeare from 25 July–9 August 1943.\n\nFrom November 1943, after Nigel Willmott had moved first to Scotland for X-craft training and then to Fort Blockhouse ahead of the Normandy D-Day reconnaissance operations, he was Acting Officer in Charge of the COPP Depot on Hayling Island.\n\nHe was first instructor to the second iteration of COPP 2 during the winter of 1943–44 (IWM Documents.16381).\n\nAfter COPP, he acted as a Staff Officer (Navigation) for Juno Beach on D-Day (Trenowden, 1995, p. 139). Ahead of the invasion, he reportedly laid special sonic navigation buoys from an HDML motor boat. This may have been Operation Enthrone, when motor launches ML 147, ML 151 and ML 198 laid 10 FH 830 marker buoys to ‘map out’ the approach lanes to be used on D-Day by the various amphibious task forces. These buoys were fitted with a special timing device that would keep them submerged until 5 June, at which point they would rise to the surface and start transmitting to help the invasion force navigate its way across the channel.\n\nImmediately after D-Day, Stanbury stayed in Normandy for six weeks as Staff Officer (Movements) for an unspecified beach (Trenowden, 1995, p. 142).\n\nHe stayed in the Royal Navy and rose to be a Commander and navigated a cruiser during the Korean War.\n\nLater he was personal assistant to physicist and radio astronomer Sir Bernard Lovell at the time of the 1961 Apollo Moon mission (Trenowden, 1995, p. 202).\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977.\n\nService number: D/JX 145150\n\nWilliam Tebb — more usually called Bill Tebb — had a naval career before joining COPP that if anything was even more impressive — he was a volunteer with the navy’s Experimental Submarine Flotilla which was cover for ‘human torpedo’ chariots. In late 1942 he was involved in a thwarted attack on the German battleship Tirpitz that resulted in having to walk through occupied Norway to neutral Sweden. A short distance from the border, Tebb was involved in a shootout with German police.\n\nHe joined COPP as an Able Seaman and is listed in Stealthily by Night under COPP Depot personnel. As a Leading Seaman, he was part of the inaugural COPP 9. He was ‘on loan’ to Force ‘S’ for the Normandy D-Day landings, carrying out tasks from headquarters landing ship LCH 185. He was ashore when it triggered a mine and sank, although fellow COPPists Caruth Main and Eric Fletcher were killed.\n\nLater, he remained with COPP 9 in the Mediterranean and Far East.\n\nRead Bill Tebb’s in-depth profile.\n\nBefore joining COPP Alfred Thomas was a steward aboard HMS Salvia and was mentioned in despatches during the withdrawal from Greece (April 1941) and awarded a Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) during the withdrawal from Crete.\n\nAs a Leading Seaman (service number P/SR 38974 or 58974) he was part of COPP 5 for Sicily and Salerno. Operations during this period he is known to have taken part in are:\n\nreconnaissance near Avola, Sicily, aboard HMS Unruffled from 24–29 June 1943\n\nbeach marking during the Operation Husky landings, 9–10 July 1943\n\nreconnaissance in the Gulf of Goia, Italy, aboard HMS Shakespeare from 25 July–9 August 1943.\n\nHe was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for “great bravery and enterprise” before and during Operation Husky, the Sicily landings.\n\nHis senior officer in COPP 5, Ralph Stanbury (1949, p. 41), wrote that Thomas was “always a pillar of strength and a fund of humour. He had passed up a commission so as to be with me in this job, and I was extremely lucky to have him.”\n\nAfter returning from the Mediterranean he did undergo officer training but remained with COPP. The nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) shows him as as a handwritten addition as a Sub-Lieutenant to the inaugural COPP 3, then undergoing training, as AM/COPP. The typed entry as AM/COPP, who Thomas replaced, was David White, who transferred to COPP 1.\n\nHe was AM/COPP with COPP 3 in south-east Asia and was regarded as their “all-round first-reserve substitute” paddler (Trenowden, 1995, p. 159). He was mentioned in despatches for a second time for Operation Confidence (Morib, Malaya) in June 1945.\n\nIn his autobiography, Lawrence Hornby — who was the supply officer at Hammenhiel Camp where COPP in south-east Asia was based — recalled a COPP RNVR Sub-Lieutenant called Thomas who he claimed was killed in action — could he have meant this Thomas but got confused about the death? He described him as “pure Cockney […] innocent and kind, rather out of his depth with a commission and glad for guidance” (Hornby, 1984, p. 14).\n\nHis medals were sold at auction in April 2005 (external link).\n\nAn Able Seaman with the service number P/JX 387575, Thomas Turner was more often known as Harry Turner — presumably his middle name was Harold. (The operation report for Operation Baboon gives his service number as P/JX 383841.)\n\nHe is included in the nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being part of COPP 3 which was then undergoing training at COPP Depot.\n\nHe was later with COPP 3 in south-east Asia, often as paddler to Ian Alcock. He was mentioned in despatches and awarded a Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for his part in Operation Baboon (in Phuket, Siam, in March 1945).\n\nOperations he is known to have taken part in are:\n\ndemolition of stakes and assault pilotage for Operation Pungent, landings in Myebon, on 11–12 January 1945\n\nOperation Baboon — reconnaissance in Phuket, Siam (now Thailand) from 8–11 March 1945.\n\nPassed away on 11 May 2012 (COPP Heroes newsletter, August 2012).\n\nBack to top of page\n\nAlbert White was in the Mediterranean in early 1943.\n\nRollo Mangnall’s papers at the Imperial War Museum suggest Albert White was a Leading Electrical Mechanic who supported both COPP 3 and COPP 4 in Algeria in early 1943 and went with COPP 3 to Malta (IWM Documents.20636). However, Mangnall also gives his rank as Petty Officer (service number P/MX 89058).\n\nAlex Hughes’ papers, also with the Imperial War Museum (IWM Documents.2222), contradict Mangnall’s. Hughes’s papers suggest he was an Electrical Mechanic, 4th Class and stayed with COPP 4.\n\nAs all the support personnel seem to have stayed in Algiers with COPP 4, it’s my current assumption that Mangnall was incorrect to suggest White went to Malta with COPP 3.\n\nAccording to Stealthily by Night, he was later with COPP 3 in south-east Asia. However, Alex Hughes’s papers (IWM Documents.2222) suggest he left COPP in or before February 1943, being absorbed into the crew of submarine depot ship HMS Maidstone “at N.C.X.F.’s direction” (Naval Commander, Expeditionary Force).\n\nRoyal Naval Volunteer Reserve, Peter Wild became one of the longest serving and most experienced COPP members.\n\nAs a Lieutenant, initially he was A/COPP in COPP 6. He was with them in the Mediterranean, taking part in:\n\nreconnaissance near Gela, Sicily, aboard HMS Unison from 1–7 June 1943 (with Sinclair from COPP 6 and a ‘chariot’ human torpedo crew)\n\nreconnaissance near Licata, Sicily, aboard HMS Unseen from 24 June–1 July 1943\n\nbeach marking of Bark West sector during Operation Husky on 9–10 July 1943, operating from HMS Unrivalled\n\nreconnaissance near Capo Colonna, Italy, from 24 July–7 August 1943 from HMS Unseen.\n\nHe earned a Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) which was gazetted on 7 December 1943.\n\nHe is listed in the nominal roll of COPP personnel as at 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as being A/COPP in COPP 6.\n\nHe took part in Operation Bellpush Able and Operation Bellpush Baker in December 1943.\n\nHe took part in Operation KJH on 31 December 1943–1 January 1944.\n\nHe was regarded by Geoff Galwey as “a dab hand at operating Mickey Mouse and our own infra-red transmitter/receiver” (Galwey, 1992, p. 109).\n\nOn D-Day, he provided pilotage for the British Army’s 30th Corps towards La Riviere (Strutton & Pearson, 1958, p. 161). However, Stealthily by Night says he was mentioned in despatches for his role in X-23 on D-Day.\n\nStealthily by Night suggests he remained with COPP 6 for their abortive trip to the South of France. If he was and remained with them until they returned to Britain, there would have been little time before he departed Britain again as a Lieutenant Commander with COPP 1, who he led as S/COPP in south-east Asia from December 1944 (Crane, 1945). He was mentioned in despatches for his work with them between November 1944 and March 1945 (gazetted 10 July 1945).\n\nOperations he is known to have been involved with were:\n\nreconnaissance north of Myebon on 24–25 January 1945\n\nreconnaissance of the Pyunshe chaung on 25–26 January 1945\n\npilotage somewhere on or near the Myebon River on 26 January 1945\n\nDalet chaung reconnaissance on 2–3 February 1945\n\nfollow-up Ruywa reconnaissance on 11–12 February 1945\n\nRuywa assault pilotage on 16 February 1945\n\nLetpan reconnaissance on 26–27 February 1945\n\nfurther Letpan reconnaissance on 2–3 March 1945\n\nLetpan pilotage on 12–13 March 1945\n\nTook part in the ‘Final fling’ variety show at the end of the war in September 1945 as a ‘guest artist’, playing himself, as the Small Operations Group was disbanded.\n\nHe was discharged in December 1945 and returned to his family factory, living in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nHe is listed as attending the COPP reunion on Hayling Island in March 1977. He passed away in February 1995 (Trenowden, 1995, p. 201).\n\nNot listed in Stealthily by Night, David Wood was included in the nominal roll of COPP personnel dated 1 April 1944 (COPP Heroes, no date, b) as part of COPP 9. His position within COPP 9 has by hand note indicating a switch from A/COPP to AM/COPP. However, these amends may have been made to reflect subsequent changes, rather than to reflect his status at that time.\n\n(The remaining information in this profile is from White, 2015, p. 1210.)\n\nHe was born on 22 September 1919 in Caulfield, Victoria, Australia. After a spell in the 20th Light Horse Regiment (Citizen’s Military Forces), he joined the Royal Ausralian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RANVR) on 18 December 1940.\n\nHe was demobilised on 7 May 1941 but then re-entered the RANVR as a Sub-Lieutenant on 20 November 1942. He joined Combined Operations in December 1942, being sent to the Combined Operations Training Centre HMS Quebec in Inveraray in Scotland. He was also reportedly attached to HMS Holder for landing craft training — I’ve not yet been able to identify Holder. In November 1943 he was attached to HMS Asbury, navy transit accommodation in Asbury Park, New Jersey, USA.\n\nIt is possible that he never saw active service with COPP as on 25 October 1944 he had been awarded a restricted Bridge Watchkeeping Certificate for landing craft only.\n\nHe was promoted to Lieutenant on 22 September 1944 and was later demobilised in Melbourne, Australia, on 26 June 1945."
