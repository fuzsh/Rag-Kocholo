        "text": "Why Thames Water is Top of Sue Gray’s Risk Register\n\nThe pollution of the Thames is not a new phenomenon. For much of the twenieth century it was tolerated so long as London's tap water was adequate. Privatisation clearly did not provide the solution. But John Davis argues that Thames Water's current financial difficulties may offer an opportunity for the government to take decisive action.\n\nRead More\n\nPlanning for the Bicentenary of the Abolition of Slavery and African Emancipation in 2033-38\n\nAs we approach the bicentenary of slavery’s abolition and African emancipation (2033-2038), crucial questions are surfacing concerning how the emergence of archival evidence and new research findings can be incorporated effectively into national and local memorialisation. Dr Michael D. Bennet and Dr James S. Dawkins argue for the creation of an independent historical advisory panel to help ensure that memorialisation across Britain avoids repeating the shortfalls of previous efforts at remembrance and facilitates a more linked-up programme of memorialisation between Britain and Caribbean nations.\n\nRead More\n\nPolicy and attitudes: historical roots of the stigmatisation of children in care today\n\nThe government's new Children's Wellbeing Bill, announced in the King's Speech, represents a welcome move to improve child protection. But Annie Skinner argues that the measures proposed do not address the long-standing issue of the stigmitisation of children in care.\n\nRead More\n\nMobilising the Environmental Humanities\n\nIn March 2024, History and Policy hosted a workshop on Environmental Humanities which brought together academics, policymakers and practitioners and was organised as part of a British Academy funded project led by Henry Irving of Leeds Beckett University. Reporting on the findings of the workshop, Andrew McTominey argues that at a time when the political world seems unwilling or unable to respond sufficiently rapidly to the climate crisis, Environmental History can help to open up some urgent and difficult conversations.\n\nRead More\n\nColloquium in Honour of Simon Szreter\n\nOn Friday 7 June, St John’s College, Cambridge hosted a special colloquium entitled ‘Health and Wealth: debating demography, gender, politics, welfare and policy’ to mark the retirement of one of History & Policy’s co-founders, Professor Simon Szreter.\n\nRead More\n\nSewerage: Trouble downstream\n\nMidway through the 2024 general election campaign, the BBC has released the results of an investigation suggesting that the water companies may have illegally discharged sewerage into rivers and the sea on 6000 occasions in 2022. Whoever wins the election, this is likely to remain a significant focus of public concern. Might Joseph Chamerlain's record as Mayor of Birmingham in the 1870s provide clues as to how to address the problem of Britain's crumbling infrastructure?\n\nRead More\n\nMore News Stories\n\nNo. 10 Guest Historian Series\n\nH&P is working in partnership with the Prime Minister's Office and the National Archives to help revitalise the history content of the new History of Government Blog website.\n\nH&P commissions and edits the No. 10 Guest Historian series, written by expert historians from the H&P network, as well as creating lively new biographies of previous Prime Ministers.\n\nRead More\n\nAbout Us\n\nH&P is based at the Institute of Historical Research, Senate House, University of London.\n\nWe are the only project in the UK providing access to an international network of more than 500 historians with a broad range of expertise.
