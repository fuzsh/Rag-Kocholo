        "text": "This paper builds on John Hattendorf's observation that British sea power was undermined in the 1930s by the strategic need to prioritise first the air force and then the army. In 1937 expenditure on the navy exceeded expenditure on either the air force or the army, and the Admiralty was successful in a defence review that year in having protection of trade routes given joint first priority along with the air defence of the United Kingdom, and the defence of Britain's overseas territories and interests was given a higher priority than support on land for any European allies Britain might have in war. However, contrary to the Admiralty's hopes, the Air Ministry continued to place large orders for bombers as well as fighters, and expenditure on the air force overtook expenditure ion the navy in 1938, while the need to support France resulted in expenditure on the army overtaking expenditure on the navy in 1939. The Admiralty's plans to build a fleet large enough to defend the Empire were frustrated by lack of industrial capacity. It is argued that scarce resources would have been better employed building ships than bombers, and that air power would have been better used in supporting the navy and the army than in strategic bombing of Germany.\n\nis is the first study to show how the Royal Navy’s ideas about the meaning and application of seapower shaped its policies in the interwar period. Drawing on a wide range of unpublished sources, the author challenges the accepted view that the intellectual shortcomings of Britain’s naval leaders resulted in poor strategic planning and an inability to meet the challenges of the Second World War. This book provides the first comprehensive survey of the navy’s strategies for dealing with possible wars with Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, and even the United States. It argues that the “Singapore Strategy” has been widely misunderstood, that there was in fact more than one strategy developed for war with Japan, that the navy’s war plans placed greater emphasis on maritime economic pressure than decisive sea battles, and that the influence of Alfred Thayer Mahan on the interwar navy has been greatly exaggerated. The author also reveals how the “One Power Standard” did not fundamentally affect the outcome of the navy’s ongoing struggle with the Treasury for funds, how the service’s interest in “showing the flag” abroad was linked to its concerns over the health of the naval armaments industry at home, and how the navy reluctantly employed propaganda between the wars to revive its popularity with the British public. The book argues that naval leaders possessed a more sophisticated and flexible understanding of the strengths and limitations of sea power than previous studies have recognized, and that Britain’s strategic position during the 1930s would have been stronger if their advice had been followed. The author concludes that the navy’s efforts to shape British grand strategy were largely unsuccessful, however, because civilian decision-makers often had different views about the role of sea power in the modern world.\n\nThis article examines the performance of the Admiralty in assessing the German navy's intentions and capabilities in the nineteen-thirties. It demonstrates that the British Naval Staff developed through a methodical war planning process a distinct image of Germany's sea strategy. As the planning process advanced, the Naval Staff became convinced by a steady influx of reliable intelligence that German strategists intended in a future war to launch an aggressive air-sea offensive against British sea lines of communication. British naval planners maintained that the only way in which German surface and subsurface forces could be made deadly was to combine them with a rapid all-out air strike on the British import system. Germany did not launch this `knockout blow' in 1939, but its elaboration by the Admiralty illustrates that the Royal Navy's appreciation of German strategy at sea was far more sophisticated, prudent and informed than historians have previously acknowledged.\n\nIt is almost an impossible challenge for the military professional to predict how a hypothetical future conflict will run and end. When advising politicians, professional leaders will seek to present options that they estimate can bring the relatively cheap, early, and acceptable conclusion that both they and their Government hope for. However, the opponent is an independent actor, and he will do everything possible to avoid or at least delay an unfavourable outcome, and all action and interaction in war is influenced by friction and chance. Another reason why prediction is exceedingly difficult is that even known technologies have not been tested under realistic conditions. If the conflict lasts longer than a few months, latent or immature technologies will be developed to a level where they can influence the outcome of the conflict in a decisive way. It is not only the opponent that is an independent actor, so are allies and formally neutral states, and it is very hard to predict ...\n\nA paper by Prof, Jeremy Black, for Quaderno Sism 2016 Future Wars. This paper focuses on speculations in the 1920s and 1930s about the next war centring on the problems created for Britain by uncertainty over which power would be their leading opponent. Much of the discussion on the British military in this period focuses on the question of whether the correct responses were made to the possibilities of new technology, notably in the shape of aircraft and tanks. This question looks toward the issue of the British responses to the German and Japanese offensives in 1940-2, and, notably, the problem of the ability to adapt to the challenges of blitzkrieg."
