        "text": "Here we report on serious issues hampering the flow of new sailors into the fleet.\n\nBackground\n\nBetween July 2022 and July 2023, the already under-strength RN workforce shrank by 4.1% (1,640 more people left than were recruited). The high level of outflow of experienced people continues to be a major concern, although the number of resignations has slowed slightly from its post-pandemic peak. The gap between the number of resignations and the intake of new sailors continues to grow and if numbers are allowed to decline at 4% or more per year, the RN will quickly be unable to meet even its core commitments. Tackling the complex issues underlying the high outflow of people has always been seen as the more difficult aspect of the personnel challenge but in the last couple of years, changes to recruitment systems have had a very negative effect on the number of new sailors joining (and is the focus of this article).\n\nApplicants not becoming recruits\n\nDespite the tight jobs market, an average of 80 applications were made to join the RN/RM as regulars every day (March 2022-23) and numbers are rising according to official figures. There is not an attraction problem, rather it’s a processing failure resulting in basic training courses at HMS Raleigh not being filled. At the time of writing, defence sources day there are just 108 recruits allocated to the last 7 entries of 2023. That means 354 training places for this quarter will go unfilled. If this trend has been repeated across the year the RN could be around 1,200 short of its target this year just for ratings alone. Assuming a place at Raleigh for a naval recruit costs about the same as that of an Army recruit, there are around Â£27,000 in sunk costs per place. This suggests in Q4 2023 the RN will see approximately Â£9.5 million wasted with no benefit to the frontline.\n\nThis crisis has been unfolding over the last 18 months. Sky News reported in July that RN intake for the year up to March 2023 had plunged 22.1% with HMS Raleigh training just 109 recruits out of a capacity of 375, with only 10 recruits showing up one week. A year earlier, the weekly average intake at Raleigh had been about 60.\n\nThe RN says: âRecruitment is one of our top priorities and we are working to continue to deliver success in a competitive market. All training programmes at HMS Raleigh have continued as scheduled to ensure the correct output of trained personnel to the Fleet.â While courses may have officially been ‘run’, navy insiders are concerned that some courses have just single-figure numbers or even zero recruits.\n\nThe situation at Britannia Royal Navy College where officers are trained is slightly better, although there is a lack of engineer and warfare candidates so numbers are made up by creating an over-supply in other branches.\n\nThe Armed Forces Recruitment Program\n\nAFRP has been set up to replace the Recruitment Partnership Program (RPP). The Â£1.3bn RPP contract signed by the MoD with Capita in 2012 was supposed to provide end-to-end recruitment for the British Army but was a total disaster, described by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee as a litany of failures. RPP was due to be replaced in 2022 but MoD mismanagement resulted in Capita being given an extension until 2024. AFRP was supposed to achieve Initial Operating Capability in April 2024 but has been delayed again and another extension given to Capita to maintain services until 2027.\n\nAt present, the three armed forces have their own recruitment systems with a mixture of private and in-house services. The RN currently relies on Capita and other providers for some aspects of the process. However, this is set to change under AFRP which is lauded by government as: “bringing the 3 single-service recruiting mechanisms under a single prime contract, delivering an end-to-end fully converged, tri-service future recruiting solution underpinned by a single digital platform”. The bidders left in contention for this project (valued at Â£1.6Bn in 2019) are Capita, Randstad, Serco, and Shared Services Connected. The competition is now in the final competitive phase but Defence is still trying to add in new requirements. Many of those still serving who have forces recruitment-related experience predict it will be another catastrophe, only this time not just messing up inflow to the Army, but all three services.\n\nIn-house or outsource?\n\nAlthough private outsourcing companies providing services to the MoD have a very mixed track record and are broadly disliked, there are examples where they have the capacity and expertise that is lacking in-house. Ideally, the RN would have the freedom to develop its own recruitment strategy, respond quickly and buy in private support where it is needed. Instead, the ‘one-size fits all’ AFRP approach is stifling innovation and flexibility, especially at present while the tender process is running.\n\nPreviously Capita could conduct 200 medical assessments a week (over a 46-week period). About 120 medically fit candidates would be ready each week to begin phase 1 training and a 40% failure rate was sustainable when there was decent capacity to conduct assessment and appeals. The Navy has recently moved away from this delivery model to an in-house solution. This has combined parts of the medical assessments into a Candidate Preparation Course (CPC) held at HMS Sultan, which also includes the fitness test and swimming test. The results of this change have been disappointing because it combines multiple failure points into a single event, placing more stress on an already stretched recruitment process.\n\nBringing medical assessments in-house adds to pressure on Navy medics and since August 2023, only around 40 candidates have been declared medically fit for service through the new process.\n\nA contract for data analytics used to drive business decisions, manage the recruitment process and help with directing recruitment was provided by a private consultancy but was allowed to expire in 2022. An in-house replacement for this has delivered nothing, leaving recruiters without a key decision-making tool.\n\nGutting the Naval Careers Service\n\nRecruitment for the RN is run by the Naval Careers Service (NCS), a small but distinct and specialist organisation within the wider Naval Service. It is mostly staffed by experienced ex-naval personnel serving as Full Time Reserves (FTRS) who provide career advice, guidance and assist with the selection process. Based in the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) around the country, they form an important first point of contact for many considering a career in the Navy.\n\nAlthough many potential recruits apply initially online or by phone through a Bristol-based call centre, they are passed to the NCS for processing. As recently as 2021, the NCS had 220 recruiters but this has rapidly declined to less than 100. Most have left due to lack of job security and poor morale due to the increasing outsourcing of recruitment which will become total under AFRP. The mismanagement that has allowed the NCS to halve in strength is a major contributing factor to the inability to process applications fast enough.\n\nNo sailors, no navy\n\nAn ill-advised naval recruitment freeze in the 1990s led to a 7% workforce ‘black hole’ that badly impacted the RN for years. The reasons may be different, but another personnel black hole is being created and without very rapid corrective action, the RN will be hamstrung for years to come, lacking the right sailors to fill billets. There is no equipment programme, no deployment or effect that can be delivered by the navy without trained and experienced people. Even the more automated fleet of the future will still be reliant on the number and quality of its sailors and marines.\n\nThe previous Second Sea Lord (and his equivalent in the RAF) wanted to abandon AFRP, concluding it would be neither more efficient or effective than existing arrangements but they were overruled. The personnel challenge is big enough for the Navy already (and many militaries worldwide), it cannot afford to exacerbate problems further by poor internal processes. Arguably the Navy Board now needs to treat recruitment systems as its highest priority, challenge ministers and take other drastic steps if necessary."
