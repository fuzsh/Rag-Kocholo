        "text": "The events of the night of the 7th - 8th June 1940 are key to this story. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were by now closing in on the evacuating forces off Northern Norway, warnings from Bletchley Park and the Norwegians had gone awry. The Navy kept a tight lid on its plans for the evacuation. Admirals were not fully in synch with each other’s plans. RAF Coastal Command, who could have provided air cover for the evacuation, had been sidelined and rumour of a German break-out into the Atlantic had sent big-gunned British battleships, more than a match for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, scurrying northwards towards the Iceland/Faroes gap, in the wrong direction and under the command of the aptly, in this case, but somewhat cruelly nicknamed, Commander in Chief Home Fleet; Sir Charles “Wrong Way” Forbes.\n\nMeanwhile, in London, Churchill was pushing his First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, to make Operation Paul happen. The timing and the wording the next signal from London is telling, it comes at quarter to one in the morning.\n\n8th June 1940\n\nAt 0043 on Saturday 8th June 1940 the following signal was sent by the Admiralty to Charles Forbes, C-in-C Home Fleet and Lionel Wells Vice Admiral Air (In Ark Royal), it read:\n\nFrom: Admiralty***0043 Part 1. The greatest importance is attached to operation PAUL\n\nbut as –\n\n(i)No (repetition No) aerodrome will be available in Norway,\n\n(ii) The radius of action when working from a Carrier of Swordfish with extra tanks has proved to be 250 miles\n\n(iii) There is a great risk to carriers if they remain for several hours off Norwegian Coast. It has been decided that it must be carried out on a reduced scale as follows:-\n\nPart 2 follows 0013/8\n\nMy 0043 part 2\n\n(a) 18 aircraft equipped with mines to fly off ARK ROYAL in vicinity of VEST FIJORD.\n\n(b) ARK ROYAL then to retire to westward at full speed\n\n(c) Aircraft, after laying mines to land in sea at various points off coast of Norway where small craft would be in attendance. This operation should be carried out as soon as possible after completion of ALPHABET (The evacuation of Norway).\n\nIf VAA (Wells) after recent experience in Norway considers ARK ROYAL can maintain a position which would enable returning aircraft to land on the ship, request you amend paragraphs 3(b) and (c) accordingly.\n\nWells’ Decision\n\nThe 0043 signal to Admiral Wells in Ark Royal gave him a real dilemma. He now had two operations to deal with; Operation Alphabet (The evacuation of allied forces from Norway) and Operation Paul . The window of opportunity for Operation Paul was tiny. Once the British evacuation was discovered, German forces, in particular the Luftwaffe, would quickly move further north in Norway filling the vacuum left by the allies. It was now or never for Operation Paul.\n\nWells had two aircraft carriers at his disposal. One had to remain with and protect the returning convoy, the other could be dispatched for Paul, both would have to return to the UK first. Why? Because neither ship had the trained Operation Paul aircrews, aerial mines or required 18 long-range fuel tanks onboard.\n\nGlorious in use as transport for RAF aircraft was no good to Wells, she could not fulfil the convoy protection role because she had only a fraction of her own aircraft onboard. The RAF aeroplanes could not operate from the carrier. Ark Royal with a near full complement of her own aircraft but without the trained pilots, long range fuel tanks or mines was the obvious choice to remain with and protect the returning convoy.\n\nGlorious was also a twenty three year old ship, Ark Royal was brand new having only been in service for eighteen months. Let’s put ourselves in Wells’ shoes and recap the evidence;\n\nGlorious’ Captain: On 7th May 1940 D’Oyly-Hughes, the captain of Glorious, is summoned from Scotland to a conference with Churchill. Neither Admiral Wells or the Captain of Ark Royal were invited. They were at sea, off the coast of Norway.\n\nGlorious’ signal: On 8th May, the day after the conference, Glorious signaled the Admiralty confirming she had 12 sets of long range fuel tanks onboard and a further 6 of her aircraft from 823 Squadron, based in the Orkneys, would be fitted with the tanks. Giving the total, so important to this story, of 18. Wells, himself, ordered the fuel tanks “only to Glorious”.\n\nGlorious’ aircraft: On the night of the 17th May those 6 aircraft from Glorious’ 823 Squadron carry out the test run for Operation Paul, codenamed Operation Bottle.\n\nGlorious’ dry run: On the 26th May D’Oyly-Hughes attempts a dry run for Operation Paul by fitting long range tanks to aircraft and bringing Glorious into within 30 miles of the Norwegian coast but the mission is blocked by the Commander Flying in the ship; JB Heath. D’Oyly-Hughes puts Heath ashore, under house arrest, pending court martial for cowardice in the face of the enemy.\n\nAs I’ve already said, Glorious was on old ship, if you had to risk losing one, which would you choose? Despite the Admiralty naming Ark Royal in their signal as the designated carrier for Operation Paul Wells knew what he needed to protect the troop convoy and what he could make available. He was the one being asked to make the decision. Churchill and Pound wanted a carrier they didn’t care which one. Naming Ark Royal and not Glorious in their 0043 signal has actually always been a stroke of luck for the Admiralty in covering up the truth. Or was it luck? Captain Peter Hore RN says in his own Operation Paul paper:\n\nSignal logs of that time have not, generally, been kept, but the preparatory, the executive signal and an amending signal are rare survivals to be found spread between papers in the collection of the Admiralty Library and a file at Kew which belonged to the War Office.\n\nI am going to go out on a limb and ask the question, can we trust the authenticity of these signals when all the evidence points to Glorious and not Ark Royal.\n\nIt’s the immediate movements of the two ships following the signal which makes it quite clear the choice Wells made. HMS Glorious immediately left the protection of the convoy because Wells chose and ordered her to carry out Operation Paul.\n\nDick Leggott, a fighter pilot in Glorious and not, by his own admission, a huge fan of JB Heath, put the court martial signal down to D’Oyly-Hughes’ dark sense of humour. Maybe he had a point. We know D’Oyly-Hughes was a signposter; the loaded revolver he kept on the bridge for any man who failed in his duty being one of them. What better way (Having made an example of Heath) to put down a marker to the rest of his ship’s company was there than the threat of court martial? D’Oyly-Hughes certainly couldn’t afford a repeat of Heath’s doubts when it came to Operation Paul. Did it serve D’Oyly-Hughes’ purposes to use the court martial as code between himself and Admiral Wells for Operation Paul?\n\nCdr. Le Geyt, in fact, refers to the signal reading “courts martial” plural. The only other officer in line for court martial was Heath’s number two - Lt. Cdr. Paul Slessor. Was D’Oyly-Hughes playing a psychological game with names and codes?\n\nIn Ark Royal’s decklog there are two entries for single Swordfish landings from Glorious in the run up to the 8th June 1940.\n\nFirstly, at 16.55 on the 5th June 1940 (leaving 43mins later). This coincides with the preparatory order signal for Operation Paul sent on the same day from the Admiralty at 15.28 to Admiral Wells in Ark Royal.\n\nThe second on the 7th June 1940. The Swordfish from Glorious landed on at 14.40 and flew off 54mins later, at 15.34. Were these visits for meetings between D’Olyly- Hughes and Wells to discuss the evacuation and preparations for Operation Paul?\n\nI don’t think for a moment Wells would have indulged D’Oyly- Hughes, in a personality clash with one of his officers, and allowed him to put a capital ship, two destroyers, desperately needed aircraft and over 1,500 men at risk because of it. Neither do I think D’Oyly-Hughes was that vindictive, unless he was suffering from some kind of mental health problem. There was a war on, a war that was going very badly for the British. D’Oyly-Hughes had already removed Heath and I can’t think he was very high up on D’Oyly-Hughes or Wells’ list of priorities. A court martial would have been a massive distraction for D’Oyly-Hughes and his ship. Understandably, far more pressing in the minds of those making the decisions, was the task of protecting Britain from invasion and cutting off Germany’s iron ore supply.\n\n8th June 1940\n\nJust after lunch on the 8th June 1940 the War Cabinet met in London and Operation Paul was again on their agenda. The minutes record:\n\nA preparatory order to carry out the operation had already been issued to C-in-C Home Fleet (Admiralty signal 0043/8)\n\nThe committee took note that the 1st Sea Lord intended to seek the authority of the War Cabinet at their meeting on the evening of the 9th June to give the final order for carrying out the operation since certain political considerations were involved.\n\nIt was agreed to instruct the secretary to draft a short memorandum setting out the nature of the orders which had been prepared for the execution of Operation Paul in order that the Foreign Office might have an opportunity of considering the political repercussions of the decision to carry out this operation.\n\nDudley Pound said the report had already been overtaken by events. A preparatory order to carry out the Operation Paul had already been issued by C-in-C Home Fleet.\n\nAgain, this is not entirely accurate. The preparatory order was not issued by C-in-C Home Fleet but by Pound and Churchill to the C-in-C Home Fleet. The order was also sent to the Vice Admiral Air (VAA) Lionel Wells. The War Cabinet discussion illustrates the extremely tight time-frames involved. They were also nervous about infringing Swedish neutrality and the possibility of Russia siding with Germany.\n\nBehind the scenes, Churchill via Pound was pushing ahead. Glorious was due to reach the UK in the early hours of the 9th June 1940. Having given the preparatory order on the 8th June, Pound intended to follow this up with the final order on the 9th June. There was no time to waste.\n\nThe Sinkings\n\nAt tea time on the afternoon of Saturday 8th June1940, Glorious was spotted by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The destroyer Ardent was dispatched by Glorious to investigate. Her flashed challenge was met by German gunfire.\n\nWith the Admiralty, as yet, unaware Glorious had been sunk, Churchill, agitated at the perceived lack of action, wrote on the 9th June 1940:\n\n“I understood from the First Sea Lord that this operation (Paul) would be carried out at once. What is the position of this? The sooner it is over the better”.\n\nAnd again, on the same day (9th June 1940) Churchill wrote to General Pug Ismay:\n\nWe have been ill served over this (Operation Paul) and the operation needlessly delayed. I am very much grieved that the Admiralty have not taken care of this most important operation and tried to fit it in earlier. Now at last the moment has come when the complete evacuation of Narvik is in sight, if not already achieved and when the situation at home is improved by the rescue of the British Expeditionary Force (Dunkirk). I understood from the First Sea Lord that the operation would be carried out at once. What is the position about this? The sooner it is over the better. Thereafter the carriers can go to America to pick up aeroplanes.\n\nThe War Cabinet met at 7pm that evening (9th June 1940). The minutes record:\n\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty ( A.V. Alexander who succeeded Churchill in the role) said it was proposed to carry out the Operation Paul in the near future. He added it is normal procedure to give prior notice of the intention to mine an area.\n\nChurchill: No prior notice should be given to our intentions to lay mines outside Lulea. If attacks resulted in sinking of neutral shipping, we should express our regrets in suitable terms.\n\nWar Cabinet agreed: No prior notice should be given of our intention to carry out Operation Paul.\n\n10th June 1940\n\nThe War Cabinet met again on the 10th June1940 by which time news of Glorious was not good;\n\nChurchill spoke of a \"grievous loss\" and \"consideration was given to the question whether a certain operation (Paul) should be carried out\".\n\nThe Chief of the Naval Staff said that no further news had been received about the German claim to have sunk H.M.S. Glorious. He feared, however, that the report was almost certainly true.\n\nConclusions, H.M.S. Glorious had been accompanied by two destroyers, and it was possible that one of these had escaped. The uncertainty on this point was an argument in favour of awaiting confirmation before issuing any statement.\n\nIn discussion it was pointed out that the Germans were broadcasting that they had sunk H.M.S. Glorious and that this claim was known throughout the Fleet. In these circumstances it was felt impossible to delay further the issue of an announcement, which should be on the lines that, in the absence of any further reports, it must be presumed that H.M.S. Glorious had been sunk.\n\nThe Chief of the Naval Staff reported the results of an air reconnaissance, and consideration was given to the question whether a certain operation (Paul) should be carried out.\n\nThe “certain operation” mentioned above can only be Operation Paul. We will never know what options were discussed but having lost Glorious, it would appear Operation Paul was cancelled. It was never discussed at War Cabinet level again. Paris fell a week later, giving the Germans access to high-grade French iron ore.\n\n17th June 1940\n\nOn the 17th June 1940 Churchill wrote to First Lord of The Admiralty, A. V. Alexander. What is interesting about his letter is he can’t even bring himself to name Glorious and instead refers to a “certain ship”. He writes:\n\nThere are several points about fleet distribution leading up to the loss of a certain ship which require examination. First, the Narvik exodus was known to be in progress by the enemy and therefore its protection against surface ships was the first charge of the Home Fleet.\n\nHow was it at this juncture that two battle cruisers, Renown and Repulse were sent off to the Faroes, entirely out of the important business that the Admiralty were carrying out from Narvik?\n\nPerhaps you should ask the naval staff to report on this matter on which Parliament will certainly concern itself. The loss was very grievous and even more vexing is that the enemy retired without injury or interception. I am afraid it will be felt that the Navy has bungled this and certainly the Germans have had a remarkable success. Considering the very few ships they had and the enormous forces which we dispose, it is astonishing how we are bedeviled by them. I am quite sure this story will require very severe scrutiny.\n\nChurchill was clearly very angry at having been caught out by the Germans and worried about the possible repercussions the loss of Glorious would bring and questions that would be asked. He also accuses the Navy of bungling an operation he interfered with.\n\nChurchill also asks AV Alexander for a report from naval staff. There was surely only one man to go to for that report; Vice Admiral Wells the man who ordered HMS Glorious, Ardent & Acasta home. So where is his report? Was Churchill asking for a report he could then suppress?\n\nMeanwhile a more palatable public explanation had to be found. The Admiralty settled on the explanation that is still given out today: Glorious left the safety of the convoy because she was an old ship and short of fuel. A story that convinced no one and further undermined the credibility of the Admiralty.\n\n26th June 1940\n\nThe Board of Enquiry\n\nThe Board of Enquiry into the loss of HMS Glorious, Ardent and Acasta signed off its findings just eighteen days later on 26th June 1940 but oddly was confined to accounts from survivors only and not the external circumstances surrounding the loss of the ships. What happened to the “very severe scrutiny” Churchill had suggested?\n\nThe Admiralty had just lost a capital ship, two destroyers, numerous aeroplanes and over 1,500 men. You might think they would want to get to the bottom of what happened and learn the lessons from it. On the contrary, the Admiralty marked the file “Closed until 2041” (Glorious is the only aircraft carrier to have had an enquiry closed for 100 years).\n\nWhat is truly bewildering is that no one appears to have asked the one man who can have shed some light on the matter, Admiral Wells, why he allowed or ordered, depending on your view, Glorious to part company with Ark Royal and the convoy.\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet Lord Cork, the Commander of Allied Forces in Norway, affectionately known as “Baron Bung”, attached a note to the Board of Enquiry report dated 4th July 1940. The note is telling, as Glorious was ostensibly under his command at the time she was sunk. He says:\n\nI do not propose to comment on this report. Ship was working directly under VAA (Vice Admiral Air Lionel Wells) and received her orders from him.\n\nIn other words, Cork was saying, if you’re looking for someone to blame don’t blame me. No mention of Glorious requesting permission to return to the UK for pending Courts Martial. Quite the opposite, he says Glorious received her “orders” from Wells. Wells in return had received his orders from Churchill and Pound only an hour or so before Glorious set a course for the UK. That order, sent at 0043 on the 8th June 1940, was to begin Operation Paul.\n\nThe fact that Wells did not give evidence to the Board of Enquiry or provide a Report of Proceedings into the loss of Glorious, when he held overall responsibility, is quite simply unbelievable and would suggest he was either gagged by Churchill, Pound and the Admiralty or his report was suppressed. His previous report relating to operations from April 1940 to the beginning of May 1940 runs to 100 pages and he hadn’t lost, 1,519 men, a carrier and two destroyers then. (National Archive Ref: ADM 199/479 MO 011871/40).\n\nThe only report Wells ever appears to have written (ADM 199/479 M010801/40) only confirms which radio frequencies Glorious, Ark Royal and the other ships in the convoy had been using. It runs to a grand total of 1 page. That’s it! Astonishing.\n\nAdmiral Sir William Davis (Commander of HMS Hood in 1940) wrote to Capt. Stephen Roskill on 30th July 1980 having read his Sunday Times article and asked the one question which no official report into the loss of Glorious has ever addressed;\n\n“What on earth was Nutty Wells thinking of letting Glorious go? Surely he ought to have been brought to trial by Court Martial?”\n\nVice Chief of Naval Staff (VCNS) Rear Admiral Tom Phillips was even more perplexed. His notes of the 20th June 1940;\n\n“Why did she part company with Ark Royal? Aircraft at 10 minutes notice at 1620. No aircraft up and ship intact at 1640. I estimate Ark Royal must have been within aircraft striking distance when all this happened”\n\nSurely these are all questions Nutty Wells could easily have dealt with? So why don’t we know the answers? Did he write a report that’s been suppressed and never published? Was Wells ever interviewed by senior officers? Was the Board of Enquiry warned off and told they could not interview him?\n\nThe Findings\n\nWithout the benefit of Wells’ evidence, the board of enquiry reached four major conclusions:\n\n(a.) There were five Swordfish Torpedo Bombers on board (Glorious) which might have been used for reconnaissance; none had been in the air 12 hours prior to, or during the action.\n\n(b). There was a lack of a proper look out on board and of precautions generally against a possible surface attack.\n\n(c). Before the action began, the only shell at the guns was for anti-aircraft attack.\n\n(d) All the boilers were not connected up.\n\nThe board also pointed to one external aspect;\n\nThe apparent lack any surface cover to protect the ship from the attack which she met.\n\n(After the sinking of HMS Courageous, sister ship to Glorious, in September 1939 The Admiralty ordered a minimum of 4 escort destroyers for carrier protection, Glorious had only 2)\n\nResponses to the findings\n\nIn response to point (a.) Sub-Lieutenant McLachlan, a survivor from Glorious, told the Board of Enquiry,\n\nIt was not usual to fly patrols once past the Faroe Islands.\n\nAlso in response to point (a.) Lieutenant Commander Hill told the Board of Enquiry,\n\nSwordfish were ranged on the flying off deck. These had no torpedo racks fitted nor were there any bombs up or fused – they were no good.\n\nOn page 165 of his book “Carrier Glorious” John Winton refers to events on board Glorious on the 8th June;\n\n“Everyone being out on their feet after the exertions of the past few days” but there were Squadron meetings on board Glorious at 9am on the 8th June. One pilot noticed warheads being removed from torpedoes and other armaments being struck down or stowed away. The Chief Torpedo Instructor in the ship said that they were getting a “lap ahead”.\n\nBut for what?\n\nJohn Winton, unaware of Operation Paul, assumed this was being done to be ready for crew leave when the ship reached the UK. The more likely explanation is the aircrews had begun preparing the aircraft to carry the mines and long range fuel tanks for Operation Paul, itself a 24-36 hour job per aircraft.\n\nWe know from the signal sent on the 8th May 1940 (The day after D’Oyly-Hughes met with Churchill) to the Admiralty from Glorious that the ship had 12 sets of long range fuel tanks on board. The tanks had been ordered “only to Glorious” by Vice Admiral Wells.\n\nIn response to point (b.) survivors told the Board of Enquiry there was a lookout but he was not at the very top of the mast.\n\nPoint (c.) is misleading in that the only time ships had come under attack out at sea during the whole Norwegian campaign had been by air. All ships, including Glorious, therefore primarily expected enemy attack to come from the air or from submarines. Had the warnings from Bletchley Park and or the Norwegian coastal watchers been passed on to Glorious and other allied ships in the area, they may have been better prepared for a surface threat.\n\nIn answer to point (d.). Glorious was zigzagging and steaming at 17 knots, the correct speed at which to keep her safe from U-boat attack, the only threat she thought likely at this point. Her boilers had all been connected up just a few hours previously when she was steaming at full speed to land on the Hurricanes.\n\nIn conclusion, the ship was not flying patrols because it appears to have become standard practice not to do so in the area she was sailing through at the time of the attack. There was a lookout, admittedly, had the lookout been at the highest point of the mast, Glorious might have sighted the enemy sooner. The ship was prepared for air attack and was sailing at the correct speed, with enough boilers connected, to prevent submarine attack. D’Oyly-Hughes, it appears, was acting no differently to the captain of Ark Royal, had he been in the same situation.\n\nHaving said that, captains are usually blamed if they lose their ship and in considering whether D’Oyly-Hughes should be posthumously court martialed, the Admiralty was not speaking out of turn. The irony though is the suggestion of court martial came from Dudley Pound the very man, along with Churchill, who put the ships in harm’s way in the first place.\n\nPounds’ hand written note on the Board of Enquiry reads “Glorious seems to have forgotten she was a Man o’ War” laying the blame squarely at D’Oyly-Hughes’s door.\n\nIt is also worth returning here to Churchill’s words in “The Gathering Storm” and the explanation for the sinkings;\n\nThe Glorious had been detached earlier that morning to proceed home independently owing to shortage of fuel, and by now was nearly 200 miles ahead of the main convoy. This explanation is not convincing. The Glorious presumably had enough fuel to steam at the speed of the convoy. All should have kept together."
