        "text": "Tribute to my Great-great-great-great-great uncle, Ezekiel Chase:\n\nI vote in honor of my old uncle Ezekiel who at the age of 16 began his service in the Continental Army. He served in Rhode Island and at the 1780 Battle of Springfield NJ. In 1780 he was captured by the British and imprisoned in the prison ship \"Jersey\" in New York harbor for 2 years. After the peace was signed, he struggled to get back to Maine, traveling in a cart because he could not walk. He was the 2nd white settler in what was to become Piscataquis County. His two brothers died in the war, one at sea, and Jonathan Chase at the siege of Yorktown in 1781.\n\nTribute to my Great-Great-Great-Great Grandfather, John Hodge:\n\nJohn Hodge of Minot, ME served two tours of duty during the Revolutionary War, once as a private in George Rogers Co. at Fort Falmouth in 1775 (now Portland) as part of the Massachusetts militia (Province of Maine) and second as a Corporal in Nathaniel Merrill's Co. in 1779 in the campaign to the Penobscot (Bagaduce Expedition) to remove the British from Fort George (now Castine ME). He joined his neighbors in the fight for their farms and lands that future generations should prosper on it and together build an independent free nation where hard work and ingenuity would equally reward any and all free thinkers who should come after him with shared dreams of building a better life in a free society. Thus, upon the foundations of his struggles, I will carry this torch, that I shall not let this light darken upon these lands but add to its glow that future generations may also share the dream of my fore fathers.\n\n\"go out and find the place where I am lying and kneel and say an Ave there for me. And I will hear though soft your tread above me and then my grave will warm and sweeter be\"\n\nTribute to my great-great grandfather, Samuel Davis, Jr.:\n\nSamuel Davis is remembered as the last living Revolutionary War veteran in Standish, as is noted on his grave.\n\nMore importantly, Samuel was born on the 4th of July in 1862, making him only a young teenager when he fought to give us freedom.\n\nI am proud to be a descendant of this real Yankee Doodle Dandy!"
