        "meta_description": "Compiled and organized by Andrew Lavoie, MLitt University of St Andrews, Intern Jan. 2015 Introduction: The Royal Navy. Perhaps the greatest navy in world history, the Royal Navy has been a symbol of the might of Great Britain for over two hundred years. The Royal Navy itself has a history and naval tradition that stretches back over six centuries, making it one of the oldest institutions currently in existence. It has been the inspiration for countless novels and the image of the Royal Navy is virtually synonymous with the Age of Sail. This document contains a selection of both primary and secondary source available for both the casual and serious researcher on the history of the Royal Navy from its medieval roots to the start of the First World War. The guide can also provide an idea of where new research into the Royal Navy can be done, information particularly useful to masters and doctoral candidates amongst others. It has been divided primarily by chronological period but also includes sections on various special topics that the discerning researcher might find useful regarding the Royal Navy.  General Works: These cover multiple chronological periods, providing an overview of the Royal Navy across time.

Beyond the list of material listed above, there is a host of sources, particularly primary, available for the researcher. Some of this material will be listed in the bibliographies of the sources listed above. Other material, especially primary sources can be harder to find. So where does one begin when considering research topics and further lines of inquiry into Royal Navy sources, beyond the material available in the Navy Department Library?\n\nRoger Morriss’ Guide to British Naval Papers in North America is an excellent source in locating various primary source material located within the United States and Canada. This guide will give the researcher a better sense of the material available and where such material might be located. For any researcher here are some tips. Before contacting a particular library, private collection, society, etc. do some preliminary research on whether the material you are hoping to find will potentially be there. Most repositories have their collections listed online at their websites; these are excellent locations to start determining whether the repository has the material you are seeking. Furthermore, be nice to your reference librarian. They frequently have near intimate knowledge of the resources of their institution and can seriously shorten your research time in finding the material you are looking for.\n\nTo most effectively delve into the primary sources connected with the Royal Navy, a researcher would have to travel to the United Kingdom. There are three places where one should start any deeper investigation into primary source material connected to the Royal Navy, all of them located within London. The British Library (http://www.bl.uk/ ) has thousands of documents ranging from early edition books, pamphlets, letter collections, and manuscripts. The British Library is an excellent starting location into further investigating the Royal Navy. Further study can be made in the shelves and reading rooms of the National Archives (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ ). Not only does the National Archives have a host of its own material (including the Service records of Navy Seamen from 1853-1923) but the National Archives system is connected to over 2,500 other archives across the UK. If the National Archives does not have what you are seeking, it will probably be able to track it down for you. Finally, the National Maritime Museum, part of the Royal Museums Greenwich, (http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum ) maintains a vast collection of manuscripts related to maritime affairs as well as physical objects from charts and maps, to uniforms and navigation equipment that can help boost the intellectual content of any work.\n\nThere is a fourth starting location for researchers of the Royal Navy and that is the Royal Naval Museum Library at Portsmouth (http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/research_library.htm ). Much like the Navy Department Library here relating to the US Navy, the Royal Naval Museum Library has a vast amount of primary source material related to the Royal Navy. These records stretch from navigation and naval science to ship movement records from 1856-1914. In conjunction with the Admiralty Library, also at Portsmouth, the Library has over 20,000 manuscripts available for perusal. They even have a helpful guide, M. Sheldon, Guide to the Manuscript Collections of the Royal Naval Museum, 1997, available for purchase, providing you the researcher with a starting point for any inquiries you wish to make. In addition, the US Navy Department Library has guides for the National Maritime Museum (Knight, R. J. B. ed. Guide to the manuscripts in the National Maritime Museum) and the National Archives (Cock, Randolph and N.A.M. Rodger, eds. A guide to the Naval Records in the National Archives of the UK) that the researcher can use to help guide his inquiries with these institutions.\n\nThe material that exists on the Royal Navy is both vast and can appear at times to be quite daunting, especially in regards to primary source material. The above musings will hopefully provide you with some guidance as to where exactly to go in order to delve deeper into the Royal Navy of Great Britain. For a starting point, the material available in the US Navy Department Library is an excellent and wise choice to begin one’s research journey.\n\n[END]"
