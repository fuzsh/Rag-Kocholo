        "text": "BOB ANSLEY\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nWhat would happen if we could look into the future? If Bob Ansley had told his grade-school classmates that someday he would have a hand in helping a man named Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon's surface and return safely to Earth, they probably would have laughed him off the playground.\n\nAnsley, who is 81, can look back at his 32-year career as an engineer with AEDC and have the last laugh, but that's getting ahead of the story.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 1962, a bad case of the flu had Ansley at home, recuperating on the couch with the TV on for a special live broadcast. He watched, as millions around the world did that day, as John Glenn lifted off of the launch pad, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth.\n\nAnsley had been working for a telephone company in North Carolina for 10 years as a lead plant engineer. He was responsible for bringing the company's sizeable headquarters and substations up to date with modern heating and air conditioning systems.\n\nInitially, he had enjoyed the job - designing systems, monitoring the installation, doing the training on them and signing off on the work. It paid well, enough to raise a family and it even enabled him to fulfill a childhood dream of learning to fly an airplane in 1952.\n\nHowever, once his work was successfully completed, he had been reassigned to be a service manager.\n\nThe new assignment was not a good fit for a man who enjoyed the complex problem solving engineering demanded.\n\n\"My responsibility was hiring, firing, disciplining and doing technical telephone business which I did not like,\" he said.\n\nHis brother, Sterling, had started working at AEDC in the early days before the center had evolved into the world-class array of complex flight simulation test facilities with its impressive infrastructure.\n\n\"I had always wanted to be in the aeronautical industry and I already had been talking to my brother at Arnold about a job,\" he said. \"Sterling replied, 'Well if you want to get into the aeronautical business, the best place to come is to AEDC.'\"\n\nSomething about being sick at home and watching the coverage of Glenn's flight was the final straw for Ansely. Before the year was out, he was working as a plant engineer in one of Arnold's flight simulation test facilities.\n\nAnsley said he recalls a lot of excitement as AEDC geared up to enter the space race.\n\n\"When John Kennedy said we're going to the moon within a decade, it quickly became clear there weren't enough test facilities,\" he said.\n\nBefore Ansley arrived at AEDC, his older brother had been working as a design engineer under the direction of AEDC Fellow Dr. Bernard Goethert on a special project supporting what would become the Apollo program.\n\n\"Sterling was in charge of designing a complex test cell for the rocket engines that would power NASA's Lunar Module,\" Ansley recalled. \"Known as the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM), it was the portion of the Apollo spacecraft to take two crew members to the surface of the moon and back to the parent spacecraft.\"\n\nThe test cell was called J-2A and it was designed to fit inside the J-2 test cell, which had originally been designed to test ram jet engines. The new test cell was designed and built specifically for the Apollo program.\n\n\"It was Dr. Goethert's idea to try and simulate space, which is 350,000 feet, where by all definitions, is the threshold of space,\" Ansley said. \"This facility, J2-A, was a very complex test cell. It was designed to simulate that pressure level and as close to absolute zero as possible.\"\n\nAnsley had only been on the job for a day or two when he got an unexpected surprise.\n\n\"I went to work one day and that same day I was assigned as plant engineer for this test at J2-A, in October of 1962,\" he said. \"I walked in and they said you've got a test the next day. We were going to test the lunar vehicle's reaction control system. It had these little engines all over it to maneuver it - in quads of four, pointing in all four directions.\n\nSix months later, Ansley was working as a project engineer with the team to conduct testing on all of the Lunar Lander's propulsion systems, including the ascent engine that would ultimately bring Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin off the moon and back home.\n\n\"Within less than two years I had come from a telephone company to the space business,\" he said.\n\n\"Here I was doing a performance test on the engine that would get the men back off of the moon's surface, but all of the engineers here had been assembled from all over the country - it was a new industry.\"\n\nHe is also still amazed at the ingenuity it took to build the test cell dedicated to the Apollo project.\n\n\"They took J-2 test cell and made two test cells out of it,\" he explained. \"A rocket engine doesn't require any air. So, they built a big bulkhead dividing the J-2 test cell and actually put the J-2A test cell inside that ducting and then they turned around and made J rocket test cell, J-2SP, which fired upstream and out through a nozzle.\"\n\n\"So, we had J-2SP which was used for special projects and J-2A which was for ultra-high altitude testing. With J-2 they had to cut the large ducting in half with torches and lift it off and put the J-2A test cell inside it and then weld that ducting back on.\"\n\nAnsley vividly recalls the high tempo of testing and the pressure, both literally and figuratively, being exerted on everyone to get it right. When Ansley worked as a plant engineer supporting testing and then as a test project engineer, he shouldered significant responsibilities. He also had to tackle some serious challenges.\n\n\"As a plant engineer, it was my job to see that the tests were running properly,\" he said. \"When you cool something from atmospheric temperatures to minus 320 degrees, cracks form as the material shrinks and expands. So, after about two cycles after I came on board for this test, they were trying to pump J-2A down for the next test and it wouldn't because the test cell's walls had developed so many small cracks.\"\n\nThe team managed to do one test and when they tried to run the next entry, J-2A wouldn't go past 200,000 feet.\n\n\"NASA wanted to bring in the ascent and the descent engine and then a series of small RCS control engines, but we had to fix the test cell first,\" Ansley said. \"We had absolute top priority at AEDC to make it work. We were told to work around the clock until we fixed J-2A. It took us three weeks of practically non-stop work to get it repaired.\"\n\nThe engineering science of the facility and the challenge of keeping it working properly intrigued Ansley.\n\n\"When you go to 350,000 feet there are so few molecules in the test cell that you can almost count them,\" he said \"And you can't pump them out in the traditional manner - the pumps quit working and you actually have to freeze the molecules. To do that, you use a helium refrigeration system that followed the same basic cycle as an air conditioning system.\n\n\"That's why my experience was applicable, except this was at much lower temperatures. I worked for six months in plant operations and we got the cell back into service where it would attain 350,000 feet on a regular basis.\"\n\nWith each test, they were exploring new territory in another area as well.\n\n\"In those days no one knew much about the effects such a low temperature and pressure would have on materials going up in space,\" Ansley explained. \"We were finding out the materials we used at that specific temperature and pressure wouldn't work up in space. J-2A was one of the most exotic test units in the world at the time.\"\n\nIn 1969, the success of the Apollo 11 mission, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's famous lunar landing, brought both a sense of relief and satisfaction to engineers with NASA, AEDC and elsewhere, who had all contributed their time and expertise to the program. However, before long, the space race seemed to end almost as quickly as it had begun, but Ansley still had a role to play in it.\n\n\"There were several other missions to the moon, including Apollo 13, where they had an explosion on board the spacecraft,\" he said. \"It took some on-the-spot engineering here and in the air, in order to figure out how to get those men back alive. They had lost their main engine. So, they had to improvise and use the descent engine which we had tested -as the way to slow down, orbit the Earth and return.\"\n\nAs emphasis on the space program faded, other concerns took priority. Ansley said challenges arising during the Vietnam War and the continuing threat from the nation's Cold War adversaries on the world stage were forcing the U.S. military to take notice.\n\nAs a U.S. Navy veteran serving in the Pacific Theater during World War II, Ansley knew first hand about the consequences of a nation playing catch up after being attacked without warning by an aggressive and determined adversary, Japan.\n\n\"The Kamikazes were killing so many people on our ships,\" he recalled. \"I was on a troop transport; we were the replacements. I was also stationed for awhile on the West coast at a naval shipyard, and every dock and every slip on the Pacific coast was filled with ships damaged by the Kamikazes.\"\n\nThe first wake-up call to develop a new class of jet fighters occurred during the mid-1960s when U.S. Air Force intelligence got an unpleasant surprise. The Soviet Union was busy building a large fighter aircraft, the MiG-25 Foxbat.\n\nLimitations with armaments carried by the F-4 Phantom II and U.S. Navy's fighters translated to an imbalance in air combat capability between the two Cold War adversaries.\n\nThe Air Force came up with the first version of the F-15 Eagle as the U.S. space race was ending, and Ansley, whether he knew it or not, was waiting to begin ground testing of the Air Force's new warfighter.\n\nDICK AUSTIN\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\n\"I am not being humble when I say I've literally stood on the shoulders of giants at AEDC, people who were the very best in their fields,\" said AEDC Fellow Dick Austin, looking back on the long and sometimes difficult road he has traveled to a successful career.\n\nMr. Austin's 35 years at AEDC were marked by a number of outstanding accomplishments, highlighted by his visionary leadership of the center's Propulsion Test and Evaluation Directorate.\n\nHe was the deputy director from 1980 until 1992, serving as the director until his retirement. He played a crucial role in forging government-industry alliances for testing and evaluation of large commercial turbofan engines. Mr. Austin's efforts led to a 20-year alliance with United Technologies Pratt & Whitney, signing an agreement in December 1992 which provided for development testing and certification of the P&W 4000 series engines in ASTF.\n\nThis agreement supported development and certification of the Boeing 777 aircraft; and also led to other alliances and agreements with General Electric, Rolls-Royce and the United Kingdom's Defense Research Agency. These alliance agreements continue to support both military and commercial testing.\n\nMr. Austin began his career at AEDC working for ARO Inc., the operating contractor from 1950-1980. He was assigned to the Propulsion Wind Tunnel (PWT) facility after having completed the engineering training program. In PWT he was assigned as a project engineer and was involved in test programs for the Polaris and Titan missiles, the F-111, XB-70 and F-15 aircraft.\n\nLater he was assigned to the Lorho/Tripltee Facility group where he led the design and development of pilot tunnel facilities used for developing design criteria for large full-scale magneto-hydroynamic hypersonic facilities.\n\nMr. Austin accepted an engineering position with the Air Force at AEDC in 1969 and continued his work for the center in that position.\n\nIn his work with the Air Force, Mr. Austin managed a broad range of ground test programs for the Aeronautical Systems Division, headquarterd at Wright-Patterson AFB. These included the F-4E, F-15, B-1B, F-5E, A-10, F-16/17 Light Weight Fighters, Advanced Tactical Fighter (F-22) F119 Joint Fighter Engine program and the Air Launched Cruise Missile. As part of this work, he led AEDC teams in development of independent government ground test plans for these systems. He also represented AEDC in the Air Force Source Selection Evaluations for all of these systems.\n\nIn 1975, Mr. Austin was assigned to the AEDC Plans and Programs Directorate. In his role there he developed AEDC's first Corporate Strategy Plan, formulated a new AEDC mission statement and conceptualized engineering analysis and technical evaluations (analysis & evaluations) as an added dimension of AEDC's mission in support of Air Force weapons development.\n\nIn addition, he established a Flight Test/Ground Test Coordination Activity between AEDC and the Edwards AFB Flight Test Center. In 1980, he was assigned as the Deputy Director of the Engine Test Facility (ETF). In this role, he was responsible for managing the propulsion test contract and protection of the engine test facilities.\n\nHe was also assigned as the U.S. Data Exchange Officer for air breathing and rocket engines with the British, French and German governments. He established a Data Exchange Agreement with the Canadian Government for turbine engines and rockets for which he was awarded a Canadian Medal upon his retirement.\n\nMr. Austin's major roles as director of the Propulsion Test activity was the creation of the commercial engine test alliances which continue today and the establishment of the critical need for the J-6 remote rocket test facility. He authored 20 AEDC technical reports and research papers. He was also responsible for critical review for all technical reports created in ETF.\n\nMr. Austin, a registered professional engineer, is a graduate of the University of Florida, National Defense University, National War College and George Washington University. He is a U.S. Navy veteran of the Korean War.\n\nHe serves the Salvation Army as a volunteer by sailing medical and school supplies to Cuba, Guatemala and Honduras. He also has a small business involved in inventing devices that are being produced in China where he has a Chinese partner.\n\nMaintaining a very active life long after retirement is a choice Mr. Austin has made without any reservations.\n\n\"I'd rather burn out because I can't stand the thought of rusting out,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked what he considered the most meaningful accomplishment of his career at AEDC, Mr. Austin did not hesitate with his answer.\n\n\"I think it is knowing that I had a direct involvement in developing the weapon systems that broke the back of communism so that our children and grandchildren do not have to live with that threat,\" he said.\n\nOf all the prestigious awards, kudos, plaques, letters of appreciation and accolades, including those from England and Canada, Mr. Austin is particularly proud of the acknowledgement he got from the Air Engineering Metal Trades Union Council (AEMTC) leadership at the end of his AEDC career.\n\n\"When I announced I was going to retire, I got a letter from the AEMTC union thanking me for the leadership I brought to that operation,\" he said. \"There is no accolade I am more proud of than that letter.\"\n\nMr. Austin knew from a very early age what the future held in store for him professionally, or as he often said, \"what I would do for an avocation as opposed to a vocation.\"\n\nHowever, the path to a successful career was neither straight nor a certainty.\n\nAfter a four-year enlistment in the Navy was up, he disembarked from his ship, the USS Saipan, an aircraft carrier, in Mayport, Fla., after an around-the-world cruise. He hitchhiked, in uniform, down to Gainesville, getting to the University of Florida's campus around midnight.\n\nWhen Mr. Austin went to apply for classes and told the admissions secretary he had no school transcripts, she told him he would not be accepted without the paperwork. He was determined to enroll in classes and ended up in front of Dr. Lester Hale's desk.\n\nDr. Hale, who was the dean of men at the school, sent Mr. Austin to the local VA for a battery of academic screening tests. To say he did not fare well on the tests was an understatement, but he repeatedly asked to be given a chance to attend the college.\n\nThe dean took the young man under his wing, helping to enroll Mr. Austin into remedial reading and math courses as well as a class on how to study. Once he began his engineering courses, Mr. Austin had found his niche, ultimately making the dean's list each semester.\n\nWhen he graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering from the university, Mr. Austin considered it a minor miracle.\n\nOn graduation day, upon hearing his mentor, Dr. Hale, describe the young man's early struggles and the subsequent applause of close to 4,000 in attendance, the Navy veteran of the Korean War broke into tears - grateful to put his hand around his diploma, proof of his hard-earned degree.\n\n\"Most of us know that nobody is ever any more than what somebody expects of them,\" he said. It was his mentors in the military, during college and ultimately at AEDC, whose expectations pushed him to go beyond his own expectations during his life and career.\n\nOTTO BOCK\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nOtto Bock of Brentwood, Tenn., is one of the few surviving engineers, scientists and technical specialists the U.S. military brought to Wright Field, Ohio from Germany after World War II as part of Operation Paperclip.\n\nOperation Paperclip was the code name given to the program under which military and U.S. intelligence services extracted German scientists from Nazi German during and after the final phases of World War II.\n\nBock came to Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) in 1953, as the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was gaining momentum after the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nIt was a period characterized by an ongoing threat of nuclear conflict and high-stakes technical competition between the two superpowers and their respective allies that lasted until the early 1990s.\n\nBock said there wasn't much to AEDC other than a few buildings, blueprints and dirt when he first came to work.\n\n\"AEDC was on paper mainly and some brickwork - that was the extent of it,\" recalled the 94-year-old research engineer. \"Eventually, I was assigned to the von Kármán facility, which was the Gas Dynamics facility at that time.\"\n\nThe von Kármán facility includes high speed supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels with speeds up to Mach 12.\n\nBorn in 1914 at Waltringhausen, Germany, it wasn't long before Bock had joined his brother and father working on a farm. After turning 14, he attended a school in Hanover, Germany specializing in agricultural science that included classes in chemistry, lab methods and photography.\n\nUnhappy about the prospect of going into the agricultural field, Bock found his professional calling shortly after he learned about an aerodynamic wind tunnel complex called the Luftfahrt Forschungs Anstalt (LFA) near Braunschweig, Germany.\n\nBock said he was literally hired on the spot at the LFA, an aerodynamic research and development installation similar to Arnold, with subsonic and supersonic wind tunnels and gun ranges. His job at the LFA was designing and operating optical hardware for wind tunnels.\n\nThe young man soon honed his technical skills to such a degree at the LFA he was able to convince his boss, Dr. Theodor Zobel, to incorporate his suggested system improvements to finally obtain optical measurements required for testing on military aircraft models and other test articles.\n\nDuring the eight years Bock spent at Wright Field he designed and operated various interferometer and schlieren systems and did pioneer work in color schlieren photography, an effort he continued at Arnold.\n\nSchlieren photography is an optical process used to photograph the flow of fluids, including air, water or glass, of varying density. The German physicist August Toepler invented the process in 1864 to study supersonic motion. Since that time, schlieren photography has been widely used in aeronautical engineering to photograph the flow of air around objects.\n\nAt AEDC, Bock became a key figure in the development of major optical systems for the wind tunnels and aeroballistic ranges of the center's von Kármán Gas Dynamics Facility.\n\nHe combined optical, photographic, electronic and mechanical systems to provide data quality \"stop action\" photographs of projectiles moving at speeds of up to 14,000 miles an hour at AEDC's 1,000-foot underground hyperballistic range. He was involved in the design and implementation of shadowgraph, schlieren and photopyrometry systems for AEDC's aeroballistic ranges.\n\n\"All of his major designs, and the successes achieved as a result of them, reflect Otto Bock's unusual scientific skill and diligence,\" said Dr. J. Leith Potter, former deputy director of the facility.\n\nBock's knowledge of optics and high-speed photographic instrumentation has been shared widely in the U.S. and abroad, through consultation work with industry and with other Air Force and government installations. His work also has been cited in a government textbook on high-speed photography.\n\nBock was also a consultant with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development at L'Institut de Saint Louis in France and at the National Physical Laboratory and Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment in England. He did consultant work in his native Germany as well and has participated in several international congresses on high-speed photography.\n\nARTHUR 'JOHN' CABLE\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nArthur \"John\" Cable was inducted as an AEDC Fellow in 1992, receiving the honor for his significant, outstanding technical and leadership contributions in development of world-class ballistic test facilities at AEDC. With 43 years of noteworthy achievements, Mr. Cable was widely recognized as one of the worlds leading authorities in aeroballistic range design and development.\n\nA native of Salisbury, England, Mr. Cable received his bachelor's and master's degrees in aeronautical engineering from the University of Bristol in England. Before beginning a 30-year career at AEDC, Mr. Cable worked at the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment in the United Kingdom before immigrating to the U.S.\n\nMr. Cable's technical and leadership contributions in the development and upgrade of AEDC's ballistic ranges played a significant role in enhancing AEDC's test capabilities. He joined AEDC in December of 1963, serving as a supervisor of range operations launch systems and in 1970 he was appointed supervisor of range operations for Sverdrup Technologies, Inc.\n\nIn 1976, Mr. Cable earned a master's degree in engineering administration from the University of Tennessee Space Institute and two years later he became a state-registered engineer. During his career, he authored or co-authored more than 50 published papers, journal articles and AEDC technical reports.\n\nInstrumental in organizing the world-renowned Aeroballistics Range Association (ARA), Mr. Cable served as chairman of the association from 1977 to 1979. By 1992, the organization had grown from three U.S. charter members in 1961 to 63 organizations from 20 countries. In 1985, ARA awarded Mr. Cable its initial Ballistic Award for technical achievements and advancement of ballistic range technologies worldwide.\n\nThrough Mr. Cable's technical leadership, techniques have been developed to allow separate measurements of quantities of material ablated by chemical effects and by mechanical erosion from clear air or ice crystal/cloud/dust-particle environments. These data sets have provided the basis for major advancements in development and validation of today's reentry vehicle ablation and erosion codes.\n\nMr. Cable's leadership and technical expertise also led to a major breakthrough for the range/track system, the measurement of boundary layer transition distances on the nosetips of reentry materials that were then tested in actual reentry conditions. Another success for Mr. Cable was validation of transpiration cooled nosetip designs, including repeat flights and recoveries\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, Mr. Cable was a range operations supervisor and in 1989 he began leading a team in a $13.3 million upgrade of the Range G launcher, track and recovery systems, designed to further advance AEDC in \"soft\" impact launch and wake physics capabilities.\n\nMr. Cable was actively involved in the community and worked with the Boy Scouts for 15 years. In 1979, Cable and his wife, Julie Maxfield Cable, received the Lamb Award by the Department of National Youth Agency Relationships of the Lutheran Council in the U.S. Cable and his wife were also instrumental in the formation of the Tullahoma branch of Habitat for Humanity in 1988, for which he acted as treasurer until 1993.\n\nMr. Cable passed away in November 2001.\n\nDR. E. EUGENE CALLENS\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nIn the last 40 years, the U.S. has worked to develop hypersonic technologies which would permit sustained atmospheric flight. At AEDC, engineers like Dr. E. Eugene Callens have played a key role in the development of state-of-the-art test techniques and facilities for ground hypervelocity testing under extreme aerothermal conditions.\n\nVirtually every high-speed flight vehicle has required testing in AEDC's Tunnels A, B and C, from reentry and tactical vehicles and space capsules, to the X-planes and winged vehicles. Dr. Callens, who was a key player in integrating advanced technologies into operational test capabilities, had early involvement in specific projects ranging from the unique AEDC's Hypervelocity Track G Guided Rail Facility to the design of Electromagnetic Launchers (EML).\n\nWhile at the center, he was responsible for all research and development and test programs in the Aeroballistics Branch of the von Karman Gas Dynamics Facility. He managed engineering and support personnel for approximately 150 test and technology projects during 1978-83. He worked on test programs that include work for MX Impactor Technology Program (ITP) and Miniature Vehicle (MV) for the Air Force; Homing Overlay Experiment (HOE) and Hypervelocity Penetrator for the Army; Improved Accuracy Program (IAP) and Materials Spallation Study for the Navy; Galileo Probe for NASA; and Advanced Materials Screening for the Defense Nuclear Agency.\n\nDr. Callens worked in aerothermodynamics, hypersonic flow, wake phenomenology and hypervelocity erosion. He was recognized for his ability to design and implement research programs with the goal of providing new technology, including mathematical and experimental modeling of physical processes as well as development of test procedures and methods of data acquisition, reduction and analysis. He was responsible for accurately forecasting future technology needs, obtaining support for proposed research programs to satisfy these needs and managing developmental program to an operational capability.\n\nDr. Callens has more than 35 years experience in aerospace test and technology project management, 17 of those years at AEDC. He was an engineering manager with Calspan Field Services, Inc. (1981-83) and ARO, Inc. (1968-81) at AEDC.\n\nHe earned Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in aeronautical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1962 and 1964, respectively. He earned a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the University of Tennessee Space Institute in 1976 and a diploma with honors from the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Rhode-Saint-Genese, Belgium, in 1967.\n\nHe was awarded the von Karman Prize for outstanding research in hypersonic, separated flow phenomena by the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Rhode-Saint-Genese, Belgium in 1967. He was recognized for his outstanding research achievements when he won the General H. H. Arnold Award from the Tennessee Section of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) in 1974 for outstanding contributions to aerospace sciences and development of snow erosion testing techniques.\n\nAdditionally, as chairman of the Tennessee Section of AIAA, he received the Outstanding Section Award in 1984.\n\nHe left AEDC in 1983 for Louisiana Tech University where he taught courses that included fluid mechanics, gas dynamics, heat transfer, aerothermodynamics and many other engineering courses for the last 23 years. In 1983, his first position at Tech was an associate professor of mechanical engineering. In 1994, he was appointed the interim department head of mechanical and Industrial Engineering. He became the Academic Director for Mechanical Engineering, industrial engineering and biomedical engineering programs in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, he obtained the position as the academic director for mathematics and statistics and was appointed to be the associate director of the Institute for Micromanufacturing from 1998-2001.\n\nFrom 2004-2006, he was the James F. Naylor Jr. Professor of Mechanical Engineering. During this time in academia, he continued his association with the Department of Defense and NASA, conducting research at the NASA Stennis Space Center in the area of gas sampling and particle characterization techniques for rocket engine exhaust plume measurements and conducting research at the Air Force Armament Directorate at Eglin AFB, Fla., in the area of terminal ballistics phenomenology.\n\nHe served as the principal investigator for an Air Force Office of Scientific Research-sponsored research project to investigate the effects of penetrator and target material properties on impact crater characteristics and as project director and principal investigator in the development of an automated, internal thread gaging system for Morton Thiokol, Inc. during 1984-1991. This state-of-the-art system satisfies a critical need in industry for on-line, real-time internal thread gaging. For this work, he received U.S. and Canadian patents for this system as first inventor.\n\nFurthermore, he served as the project director and principal investigator in the design of an overpressure and ballistic impact protection system for the NASA Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) during 1986 to 1990. This design incorporates state-of-the-art lightweight, high performance ceramic/composite armor in the protection of the nuclear power generators used on deep space probes.\n\nHe is the author or co-author of 44 technical reports.\n\nUpon his retirement from the university in June 2006, Dr. Callens was appointed Professor Emeritus.\n\nRET. MAJ. GEN. FRANKLIN OTIS CARROLL\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nMaj. Gen. Franklin Otis Carroll is widely known for being the first AEDC commander, but his contributions to the center are far greater.\n\n\"General Carroll personified the vision and tenacity it took to make technology and testing a central focus within the Air Force,\" said Gen. Ronald Yates, former commander for Air Force Systems Command and Air Force Materiel Command at the Carroll Building renaming dedication in 1991. \"Without his foresight and commitment, we might not be standing here today. We're here today only because he fought for AEDC in the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and in every other corner of government that he thought could make this become a reality.\"\n\nBorn Feb. 10, 1893 in Washington, Ind., he attended the University of Illinois at Champaign, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1915.\n\nHe was quickly called to active duty after graduation with the 101st Illinois Volunteer Calvary, Illinois Guard and served with General Pershing's Expeditionary Force searching for Poncho Villa.\n\nAfter returning home for a short three weeks, he was recalled to active duty when his State Guard Unit reactivated and was assigned to Officer's Training School at Fort Sheridan, Ill. There he volunteered for the Signal Corps, Aviation Section and in late 1916 was sent to Kelly Field in San Antonio, for flight training. He became a pilot instructor in his remaining time at Kelly Field in 1918. General Carroll attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1920 where he earned an advanced engineering degree in aeronautical engineering.\n\nExcept for occasional assignments elsewhere, General Carroll spent a significant part of his career at Wright Field. These were exciting times at Wright Field witnessing a revolution in aircraft design, materials, manufacturing and performance. Many may not realize it but General Carroll summoned a world-renowned aerodynamicist by the name of Dr. Theodore von Kármán to Wright Field to explain to senior officers whether it was possible to design and build a plane that could fly 1,000 miles per hour.\n\nAt Wright Field, General Carroll was chief of the engineering division, a position that gave him a say on every major experimental and engineering project during World War II. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, General Carroll approved the creation of new laboratories for aero medical research, communications and navigation and radar. He oversaw plans that expanded Wright Field's experimental facilities, including the world's most powerful wind tunnel and other tunnels for vertical, transonic and supersonic testing of aircraft and associated equipment and components.\n\nIn 1949, he became the first commanding general of the Air Engineering Development Division, established to oversee the creation of AEDC, which in 1951 was rededicated as AEDC. While here, General Carroll oversaw the center during its construction and early operation.\n\nHe retired from the Air Force in 1953 after 41 years of service. General Carroll passed away in 1988 at the age of 95.\n\nAmong his many medals, General Carroll held the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the World War I Victory Medal, the Mexican Border Service Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Asian-Pacific Theater Medal and the Occupational Medal (Japan).\n\nThe Engineering Analysis Facility (EAF) was dedicated June 21, 1991 in honor of General Carroll. The $14.7 million, 126,000 square foot facility has office space to approximately 600 operating contractor personnel. The Carroll Building provides AEDC with centralized engineering analysis and computer operations. These operations were spread across the base before the establishment of the building.\n\nMILT DAVIS, SR.\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nShortly after 16-year-old Milt Davis, Sr. graduated from high school in 1942 and started working at his first \"real\" job; he knew the career he wanted to pursue. That first job, an under-aircraft model maker at National Advisor Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor to NASA, lasted only six months, but it set the stage for a 40-year career in wind tunnel testing, design and development at the U.S. Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) and other places in the U.S. and abroad where cutting-edge aeronautical and aerodynamic research and ground testing was conducted.\n\nDavis was one of eight children born to a father who was a Colorado rancher and a mother who took her children's education very seriously. His mother ensured her children had the best education, wherever it was locally available. Davis vividly recalled attending one school in rural Colorado that he jokingly referred to as the \"smallest school in the United States.\"\n\nWhen he turned 16, he sold his horse, borrowed $50 from his father and headed across the country to Langley, Va., to begin that first job as a wind tunnel technician at NACA. The trip took him a long way from home, and it also introduced him to a new world he was soon to enter in earnest.\n\n\"I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer and work in wind tunnels,\" he said, recalling how he had learned of that first job at NACA, which had included Orville Wright as one of the organization's original founders. \"It was advertised in the Model Airplane News. I applied for a job; they sent me a wire that said 'You're hired.'\"\n\nSix months later, Davis returned home to attend college. World War II had begun less than two years before, and, shortly after turning 18, he joined the Navy.\n\n\"I served in the V5 and V12 programs, Navy ROTC and I graduated from Georgia Tech as an ensign in 1946,\" he recalled. He started out training to become a pilot, but later the Navy transferred him to a curriculum geared for officers who would serve in the surface Navy. He ended up with two bachelor's degrees from Georgia Tech, one in basic engineering and the other in aeronautical engineering.\n\nPrior to attending Georgia Tech, he had taken calculus courses at a couple of what were then referred to as teacher's colleges, one in Kansas and another in Colorado. Although he had high scores, Georgia Tech officials strongly advised him to retake the same math courses. They knew Georgia Tech's math curriculum was more demanding than what he had experienced in the other schools. But Davis didn't want to waste time.\n\n\"I insisted on going on, and, as a consequence, I got a bachelor's degree in basic engineering in '46 and another bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering in '48,\" he said.\n\nAt age 21 he married his wife Valerie and they were soon raising a family. He went to work for United Aircraft Corp, in East Hartford, Conn. Jets had just begun to revolutionize the aircraft industry and it was his job to help conduct wind tunnel testing on propellers in an effort to compete with the emerging threat of jet engines.\n\nThree years later, despite all the company's efforts, physics proved the futility of trying to get propellers to keep up with the speeds jets provided. Davis then went to work for the Sandia Corp., in what he described as the engineering arm of the nuclear weapon triad.\n\n\"I was in the wind tunnel group that was responsible for the aerodynamics of nuclear weapons. We were in the early throes of developing a thermonuclear, two-stage weapon - a hydrogen bomb.\"\n\nIn 1957 he came to AEDC, initially working for Heinrich Ramm, one of a core of scientists originally from Peenemunde, Germany's premiere scientific wind tunnel complex during World War II that conducted testing on the V2 rocket.\n\nHe went to work at the 16S wind tunnel, which was in the midst of being built.\n\n\"It had all been designed by Sverdrup and Parcel,\" he said. \"We were working with the (Army) Corps of Engineers to construct it. We eventually, through the leadership of Dick Rebmann, AEDC fellow Rudy Hensel and Herman Collier and others, brought the tunnel into calibration.\"\n\nDavis bluntly explained the challenge of working at PWT, saying, \"The biggest supersonic wind tunnel, until they built the 16-foot supersonic wind tunnel, was about 24 inches. They would have been better off if they had built some intermediate sized ones before they went full scale. Heinrich Ramm had built the 20-inch or so tunnel at Peenemunde (Germany) where they developed the V2 rocket. He jumped from that to the head of the supersonic branch under Rudy Hensel, who had worked with Dr. Theodore von Kármán.\"\n\nTo prove he was up to the challenge of working at 16S, he was tasked to conduct an aerodynamic test on the T-38 (Talon jet trainer) in the center's 16-foot transonic tunnel. \"They thought I had to at least do that in order to get educated on how to run tests in large wind tunnels.\"\n\nA sense of pride, tempered by a desire to properly credit his co-workers and those who worked for him at AEDC, is evident when Davis is asked what he considers his greatest accomplishments. Bringing 16S into operation was one highlight of his career. He described the design of 16SÕs nozzle as an \"engineering miracle.\" He is particularly proud of being \"the father\" of 4T, but he also listed a long list of former and current AEDCers who all played an important role in the development and success of 4T and the other facilities he worked on.\n\nAEDC Fellow Dr. Edward Kraft considers Davis the center's premiere expert on the design and operation of wind tunnels. \"Mr. Davis has been involved in more wind tunnel design studies than perhaps anyone in the country,\" he said.\n\nIn 1988, Davis retired from AEDC and went to South Africa to teach a Sverdrup-sponsored course on basic wind tunnel aerodynamics to young engineers with the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.\n\nHe remained in South Africa for a year and a half, as a consultant to CSIR for Davis Engineering, his own company.\n\n\"I've been working for Davis Engineering ever since, whenever I can get a job,\" he said, adding, \"I've been back to AEDC on several consulting contracts, as Davis Engineering.\"\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, his most recent work for AEDC involved researching, documenting and publishing all of his colleague's corporate knowledge of the 16S wind tunnel.\n\n\"All of that corporate knowledge has been almost lost because the people have retired, died or moved away,\" he said.\n\nMilt Davis Sr.'s legacy goes beyond his accomplishments with advances in wind tunnel design, development and research. His son, Milt Davis, Jr. and grandson, Chris Davis, both work for Aerospace Testing Alliance at AEDC.\n\nMilt Davis, Jr., who has a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech, is a gas turbine propulsion analyst and project manager working in the computational modeling and simulation section of the Applied Technology Branch of the Integrated Testing and Evaluation Department. Chris Davis is a computer scientist also working in the Applied Technology Branch supporting data acquisition and aiding in developing new test acquisition techniques.\n\nROBERT 'BOB' DIETZ\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nWhen Robert Dietz came to AEDC in 1952 much of the center's 4,000 acres looked more like a massive construction site than a flight simulation testing complex.\n\nLooking back, he acknowledges AEDC's transformation has been dramatic, and he is proud to have been a part of that process.\n\nFor more than 28 years, he played a major role in the planning, growth, operation and accomplishments of the center.\n\nNow at 83, Mr. Dietz is still amazed at how the road he traveled has led to a life full of memorable experiences and marked by significant professional and personal achievements.\n\nSome people might attribute such successes in life to good fortune - being the right person in the right place at the right time. He sees things a little differently. He credits it to a higher power.\n\nBorn at home and raised in St. Louis during the height of the Great Depression, Mr. Dietz was eager to learn from a young age and blessed with the potential to make the best of superb schools and excellent teachers. It wasn't long before he realized engineering lay in his future.\n\n\"I remember one teacher in particular, her name was Mrs. Shapiro,\" he said. \"She didn't put up with any nonsense, she expected you to do your work.\"\n\nAn aptitude for drafting and mathematics during high school provided skills that would serve him well throughout his college years and professional life. His engineering expertise and an instinctive sense of knowing when to be \"a meddler\" enabled him to make lasting contributions during a career that began with some unexpected twists and turns.\n\nUpon graduating near the top of his class at the University of Missouri-Rolla, Mr. Dietz initially accepted a job with an oil firm, but he found it impossible to resist a better offer when it came along. He interviewed for a coveted research engineering position at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and was shocked he was hired. He soon found himself burning the midnight oil in a control room at the agency's Lewis Propulsion Lab in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nDuring the final months of World War II, Mr. Dietz and other young engineers at Lewis had been working late into the night and early morning to solve a frustrating problem, which was hampering the mission to force Japan to submit to an unconditional surrender. They were in the midst of trying to figure out why the engine powering the B-29 Superfortress was coming apart during takeoffs with a full load of ordnance. Pilots had been forced to ditch some of the planes at sea with the loss of all on board - events which haunted the young engineer's dreams.\n\nIt was at this time when Mr. Dietz learned a lot about taking a hands-on, but diplomatic, approach to a challenge from a man who had a reputation for getting things done. That individual was General of the Air Force Henry H. Hap Arnold. At 2 a.m., General Arnold walked into where the team was working the problem and after a brief introduction, addressed the men, saying, \"Boys, we need this airplane in the Pacific. Let's make it work.\"\n\nThose words had a profound effect on the team. They succeeded in solving the problem with the plane's engines. The planes were able to make their bombing runs, completing the flight from the Marianas Islands to Tokyo and back. The dreaded invasion of the Japanese mainland never materialized, and the war soon ended.\n\nHis experience at Lewis left a powerful impression on the young college graduate. Mr. Dietz acknowledged the excellent mentoring he received throughout his career from his peers and the vital role played by competent supervisors.\n\n\"Even as a junior engineer when I took the first job at NACA, I was working with geniuses,\" he said. \"They were teaching me all the time.\"\n\nIn 1950, AEDC and the Engine Test Facility (ETF) were no more than preliminary blueprints and an idea in the heads of scientists, engineers and senior planners. Mr. Dietz was in St. Louis and working for Arnold Research Organization (ARO), the first support contractor for AEDC. He was already busy tackling the challenge of taking ETF from a concept to a fully functional facility for testing propulsion systems, including turbojet and turbofan air breathing engines and ramjets.\n\nFrom the beginning, serious challenges kept the team working on ETF very busy. He took the lead in helping the team to overcome a major problem early on with airflow instability in the facility.\n\n\"I assigned a junior-level engineer and suggested to him that by applying the Reynolds number at sea level to a model built from quarter-inch plastic would be just right for studying the air flow in those chambers that the designer had put in ETF,\" he said.\n\nMr. Dietz moved up to become a manager on the chief engineer's staff. He was responsible for the technical direction of approximately 400 engineers and support personnel. He also managed the team's administrative, labor and grievance issues.\n\nIn 1957, he moved from ARO to become AEDC's government chief of the advanced study group. That same year Dr. Theodore von Kármán spent a few weeks at AEDC and personally delivered a series of lectures on gas dynamics. Mr. Dietz attended every class, and he encouraged every one of his team's subordinates and peers to attend as well.\n\n\"He was able to teach in a way that was interesting as hell,\" he said. \"And you didn't need to ask him many questions, you just needed to listen carefully. He was really a good teacher, no question about it.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, Mr. Dietz made significant contributions to the future of aeronautical and aerospace engineering during his five years as director of the von Kármán Institute (VKI) for Fluid Dynamics in Belgium. His work at VKI earned him the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service.\n\nMr. Dietz returned to AEDC in 1970 and became the director of technology. His efforts resulted in improved management of research within the operating contract, and they significantly upgraded the response to Air Force requirements.\n\nThen, as the center's deputy of planning, he participated in the successful drive to plan, design, develop, promote and help find funding for what became the Aeropropulsion Systems Test Facility (ASTF).\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Dietz made a significant impact both nationally and internationally as a participant in a number of important organizations. From 1971 to 1980, he was a U.S. representative to the NATO Advisory Group on Aeronautical Research and Development's Fluid Dynamics Panel and later served as chairman for the organization's wind tunnel working group.\n\nHe also served as the U.S. project officer for the DoD data exchange agreements with West Germany and France. Mr. Dietz has authored more than 34 technical reports on a wide variety of topics, including one on the performance requirements for the basic design of the Mark I Space Chamber.\n\nHe played a key role in developing and advocating the country's needs for an advanced transonic aerodynamics testing capability. This effort culminated in construction of the National Transonic Facility at NASA's Langley Research Center.\n\nMr. Dietz was among the first of those inducted as AEDC Fellows in June 1989.\n\nWILLIAM THAXTON EARHEART, JR.\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nBill Earheart passed away on July 27 after a battle with cancer. I only really got to know him after he retired from the U.S. Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC).\n\nHe was the saxophone player in a music group at Trinity Lutheran Church in Tullahoma with my wife, who was the keyboardist for the group. I soon found out that he made wonderful music with his sax. I also knew that he had wired much of the church's sound system and was an avid ham radio operator.\n\nIt wasn't until I talked to his lifelong friend, AEDC Fellow Robert \"Bob\" E. Smith Jr., at his funeral visitation that the full scope of the important role he quietly played at AEDC came into view.\n\nBill Earheart and Bob Smith grew up in Pulaski, Tenn. They attended public school together, attended Vanderbilt University together, were both married the same week (served as each other's Best Man) and started work for ARO (Arnold Research Organization) at AEDC the same day. They were the second and third AEDC employees to celebrate 40 years of employment at the center in 1991.\n\nDuring their professional careers both became recognized experts at what they did but in different fields. Smith's was testing jet engines, Bill's was electronics.\n\nBob even told me a story about how, as kids, Bill had built an instrument to measure how much electric voltage they could hold on to. The instrument was the size of a cigar box with two electrodes and a variable power supply. One boy held on to the electrodes with pliers while the other slowly increased the voltage until the shockee had to turn loose. After lots of highly competitive practice, either could hold up to 90 volts. Something our safety folks would have a coronary about today.\n\nEarly on at AEDC, Bill was tasked to redesign the control system for the variable geometry flex plate nozzle for the von K‡rm‡n Gas Dynamics Facility's supersonic tunnel A. The original control system did not provide the required positioning accuracy and caused failure of one of the critical flex plates.\n\nHe completely redesigned the original system and incorporated the most advanced, state-of-the-art, electronic components to achieve the required control accuracy. The dozens of modules required for the Tunnel A nozzle were constructed by AEDC technicians under Bill's direction. The accuracy of this control system was better than that of then available commercial systems. Bill's design stood the test of time for four decades according to AEDC Fellow Jerry Jones who worked with Bill in Tunnel A in the early years.\n\nAEDC had the first of the second-generation computers installed anywhere in the country -- the ERA 1102s. Each major test facility had one. The memory module in VKF failed, and the manufacturer determined that it was not repairable. Bill rose to the challenge once again and conceived a new memory module that restored this critical computer to operational service.\n\nChuck Schuler, a retired AEDC engineer, recalls that the big Schlieren system in Tunnel A, that allowed engineers to look at the shock waves coming off the model being tested, vibrated causing a fuzzy image. The mirrors were so big and heavy that it proved impossible, despite several efforts, to reduce the vibration to an acceptable level.\n\nBill once again accepted the challenge. His solution was to let them vibrate and to add an electronic shaker to the beam splitter (knife edge) in the optics so that the splitter moved exactly in phase with the mirrors. This synchronized movement produced a sharp image critical to understanding the flight characteristics of the model in the wind tunnel.\n\nBill's solution predated image stabilization in today's digital cameras and camcorders that operate on a similar principle by almost 50 years.\n\nAccording to retired AEDC engineer Jim Thompson, after Bill moved to ETF as a manager he continued to play a significant role and was the key player in getting the first PC workstations installed throughout ETF. \"He was a systems guy all the way,\" Mr. Thompson said.\n\nThroughout his life Bill had a love of music. He was a very good musician and could have had a career in music had he chosen to. Bill was a perfectionist in all he did, including his music. He told my wife that all he expected from anyone was their very best, and if it wasn't good enough, don't bother. He had the praise team band striving for the same perfection.\n\nHe would often give other musicians a distinctive Bill Earheart look if they played a wrong note or were out of sync. He was famous for that look.\n\nHis daughter Janice of Memphis, Tenn. told me that her dad never spanked her, but with that look he made her feel bad that she had not behaved. She said that he would never ask anyone to do something that he could not do himself.\n\nHis son, William Thaxton Earheart III, who plays keyboard for Hank Williams Jr., said his real regret is that he never got his dad into a recording studio to record any of his music.\n\nBill played his sax from elementary school on. He and Bob Smith wound up playing in the same band all the way through college and beyond. Smith played the trumpet. Even at AEDC Earheart played with Opal Wieners Band and the South Jackson Street Band. And he often played at the then AEDC Officers' Club. For the last 10 years he played with Tullahoma's Trinity Lutheran Church Praise Team Band.\n\nI remarked to Bob Smith that I had really enjoyed hearing Bill play sax even when the Trinity Praise Band was just practicing. Bob said, \"That was nothing new; students used to bring their books and just listen to the small band that he and Bill were in at Vanderbilt University when they practiced, just to hear Bill play the sax.\"\n\nFor 40 years he quietly, with little fanfare, played a key role behind the scenes at AEDC, insisting on perfection from himself and those around him.\n\nThe work he did at AEDC played a key role in establishing AEDC's role and worldwide reputation. He was an AEDC hero who would have made General of the Air Force Hap Arnold proud.\n\nDONALD EASTMAN\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nAEDC Fellow Donald Eastman's AEDC career started in 1951 as the assistant chief of the project office when he began working on design and construction of wind tunnand engine altitude test facilities.\n\nBy the time he retired in 1975 as AEDC's chief scientist, his technical involvement successfully contributed to the establishment of the Propulsion Wind Tunnel (PWT) complex, the Engine Test Facility (ETF) and the von Kármán Gas Dynamics facility. During his career, he was involved in technical management, research and development programs and development testing activities in wind tunnels, altitude engine testing facilitiesand space environment facilities for aircraft missiles, spacecraft and their propulsion systems. Specifically, he was responsible for the Air Force decision to build the PWT transonic and supersonic wind tunnels with16-foot rather than eight-foot sections.\n\nMr. Eastman, who earned a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering at Georgia Tech, contributed firsthand to the conceptual planning of AEDC while assigned to the Office of Secretary of Defense, serving from 1947 to 1951, as the director of committee on Aeronautics, Research and Development Board.\n\nHe also participated in the design, construction, operations, and future planning of the center while in several key positions. From 1951-53, he was the assistant chief of the Projects Office. In 1954, he was promoted to the director of test operations and held that position until 1957 when we was assigned as AEDC's technical director. In 1961, he became AEDC's director of research and in 1964, he was named the center's chief scientist.\n\nHe was at the forefront of critical decisions during the construction phase and initial operations of AEDC. For example, just after the ETF basic plant became operational in 1954, the DoD reviewed the process and was not complimentary in their evaluation. Mr.Eastman spearheaded a successful effort for funds and approval by the Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Develop for the Air Force to construct an ETF addition - test cells J-1 and J-2.\n\nWhile many people contributed to the building of the Aeropropulsion Systems Test Facility (ASTF), Mr. Eastman played a major role. As the AEDC chief scientist. He presented, advocated and defended ASTF at more than 30 high level meetings. At one particular Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) meeting attended by the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff, SAF members and others, the conclusion was reached that ASTF should not be built and the NASA Lewis Research Center should be augmented for additional test capability.\n\nMr. Eastman strongly objected to this conclusion pointing out the fallacies of such a decision. As a result, the \"Kerrebrock\" committee was formed and after a thorough review of the requirements, the committee concluded that the ASTF should indeed be built and should be built at AEDC.\n\nMr. Eastman was exceptionally well-known for his management capability. He was well-respected by his superiors, peers and subordinates alike and was responsible for making many top-level management decisions. While he was deputy chief of staff for operations,Mr. Eastman was responsible for the concept of the Air Force representatives being assigned to the major test complexes at the center, a system which continues today.\n\nMr. Eastman was instrumental in the establishment of data exchange agreements with European allies - leading the effort to establish five agreements - one with England, two with France, one with Germany, and one joint agreement with France and Germany.\n\nHe was a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the University of Tennessee Space Institute Advisory Council. In addition, he was a member of the Technical Advisory Group to former Tennessee Congressman Jim Cooper.\n\nHe was inducted as an AEDC Fellow in June 1989.\n\nROBERT 'BOB' HAYNES\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nWhen Robert \"Bob\" Haynes graduated from the University of Maine in 1952, he had no idea what he wanted to do with his future. One thing he knew for sure was that he was going to be drafted into the United States Army because of the Korean War, so everything else was put on hold.\n\nInstead of going to Korea, in January 1953, he found himself at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Ala., training at the U.S. Army Ordinance Guidance Missile School as an instructor. From this point on he was intrigued by missiles and rockets.\n\n\"At this point I knew I was hooked,\" he commented as he explains his excitement about his future career. \"I had become a rocket engine guy.\"\n\nAfter a couple years of instructing students, Mr. Haynes left Redstone Arsenal and moved to Los Angeles in 1956 where he worked with the Corporal missile system at the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, guided missile division. From there he was assigned, as field engineer, to White Sands Missile Range and Fort Bliss where he performed launch operations for the Corporal missile and static testing of the Corporal motor.\n\n\"At the time, the Corporal was the nation's longest range ballistic missile with a maximum range of 90 miles,\" he explained. \"I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and still do to this day.\"\n\nWhen the Corporal missile system began to phase out he began to seek other employment. His mother-in-law sent him a picture from AEDC of a man in an asbestos uniform working in the propulsion wind tunnel and as the word \"rocket\" was used, Mr. Haynes quickly sent in an application and was hired.\n\n\"ARO (Arnold Research Organization), the prime contractor for AEDC at the time, had just started working with rocket motors,\" he said,\" and there were very few people in the industry who were experienced in rocket engines so I took the job.\" Mr. Haynes only expected to be at AEDC for a few years, but when he retired from AEDC in 1985 and finally, last month from work in his field, he could not have imagined all the wonderful years he would spend working with rocket engines and living in Tennessee.\n\n\"I only expected to be at AEDC for five or six years and then I would move on to something else and that was in 1959,\" he explained. \"Here it is 2006 and I haven't left the field yet and don't plan on it.\"\n\nWhen he was hired in August 1959, AEDC was just beginning to conduct, in T-1 cell, base recirculation studies on scale models of the Atlas and Titan missiles, with test conditions from subsonic to Mach 3, at altitudes from near sea level to 45,000 feet. He moved from there to J-3, which was just shaking down.\n\nWork in J-3 involved testing of the Titan I and Titan II second stage engines and development and acceptance testing of the Service Propulsion Engine for the Apollo Service Module (see pages 8-9). Work on J-2 test cell, which was a rocket cell at this time, included test of the second and third stages of the Minuteman ICBM and various other research solids.\n\n\"Boy, were we learning,\" he reminisced. \"None of us really knew the intricacies of liquid propellant rocket engines, but we learned. We had many engines malfunction, sometimes caused by engine operating error sometimes by plant operational problems, and sometimes by personnel errors. It was a totally different environment. Everyone was trying to figure out how both the engines worked and how to operate a plant designed for turbine type engine testing. Now, Arnold is leaning more toward a totally success-oriented operation with an available wealth of knowledge accumulated over the years and success is both expected and achieved.\"\n\nHe agrees it is a good approach to have now, but during the 1960s and 70s this knowledge was not available resulting in the necessity to learn from their mistakes and the advice of the engine manufacturers.\n\n\"It was wonderful at the time because few had ever done this type of testing before so no one could seriously find fault if we did something wrong,\" He further commented. \"It was a totally different world and probably the most fun I have ever had.\"\n\nMr. Haynes made it clear he is not criticizing how AEDC functions today, but he wants people to understand that there is a tremendous amount of history and knowledge related to altitude testing now leading to a higher test success rate.\n\nMoving onto J-4, Mr. Haynes worked on upgrading tests for the Pratt & Whitney RL10, LH2/LO2 rocket engine and initial testing of the solid propellant second stage Peacekeeper ICBM motor and others.\n\n\"Those were great years,\" he remembered. \"We were young and anxious. We were anxious to win the national effort to beat the Russians to space and we were really all gung-ho about it.\"\n\nHe expresses his opinion saying \"Although it was a good thing when we went to the moon and beat the Russians, but when Neil Armstrong stepped his foot on the moon he pretty well ended the space program at that time because after that, Congress said 'okay we did it,' and cut funding and further rocket testing in the 70s was very meager.\"\n\n\"Even though work had died down significantly, a few of us were able to stay in the rocket business by switching to solid propellant work,\" he said. \"AEDC was still going strong because turbine engine testing was starting up and there was some rocket testing, but not with the emphasis like there was in the 60s.\"\n\nDuring the 80s, the pace had picked up some, but a tragic accident involving four deaths in the J-4 test cell convinced Mr. Haynes to re-evaluate his hands-on involvement with rocket engines.\n\n\"I was the lead mechanical engineer on that project,\" he reflected. \"Those were bad days. Those were hard days.\"\n\nIn 1985, he went to work for Sverdrup downtown Tullahoma designing test facilities for Pratt & Whitney, NASA and other rocket test organizations until his first retirement in 1991. He continued working for Sverdrup at Stennis Space Center in Southern Mississippi until his second retirement in 1993. He has continued part-time work for Sverdrup and Ares Corp. until last year.\n\nIn his retirement, Mr. Haynes still enjoys hearing the latest news about rocket engines and space exploration, and often remembers the great times he had helping defend the nation and making the U.S. the best in the world by working at AEDC.\n\nRUDOLPH 'RUDY' W. HENSEL\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nToday, at 86, AEDC Fellow Rudolph \"Rudy\" W. Hensel is an investments adviser. The business owner, whose office walls are filled with memorabilia of his previous career, is eager to tell his story of AEDC beginnings.\n\nMr. Hensel was the facility chief for the center's Propulsion Wind Tunnel (PWT) before retiring in 1980 with 27 years at AEDC working for only one contractor, Arnold Research Organization (ARO).\n\nHe has an aeronautical engineering degree (first study program offered in the United States in fields of compressible fluids and jet propulsion) from the California Institute of Technology, as well as a Bachelor and Master of Science in aeronautical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBefore coming to AEDC, Mr. Hensel was stationed, during World War II, at Wright Field Aircraft Lab, Wind Tunnel Branch, Ohio. His two bosses, Dr. Frank Wattendorf and Col. Frank Warburton, were instrumental in the beginnings of AEDC. As history would have it, Dr. Wattendorf wrote the visionary statement for what was to become an engineering and development center.\n\n\"With these two guys as my bosses, naturally I got involved in the process,\" he explained. \"I had a little to do in the early planning days.\"\n\nIn 1945-47, Mr. Hensel participated in the initial design concepts of AEDC's PWT and served as the liaison officer in transfer of German engine test facility components to AEDC.\n\n\"The Germans were actually building and had well under construction, a large wind tunnel eight meters in diameter, when we captured it. It was a rather unique piece of equipment; what we built at PWT was in some sense a version of that, but not exactly.\"\n\nHis job during active duty was being in charge of a 10-foot wind tunnel, a smaller version of 16T, but was a little behind the times comparable to a few wind tunnels in Germany and one that was being built at CALTECH, known as the cooperative wind tunnel.\n\n\"When the war was over, we gathered a lot of the German scientists who were working in the aeronautics part of the Nazi operation and brought them to Wright Field,\" he explained. \"One of them included Dr. Bernhard Goethert, who hand a significant hand in designing the PWT tunnels when he came to AEDC in 1952.\"\n\nFrom the mid-1950-60s at AEDC, he provided the technical and management leadership to bring the transonic and large supersonic wind tunnels from construction into routine operation. At that time, these were the largest most technically advanced units in the world.\n\nHe provided leadership for all phases of the activation of PWT's transonic and supersonic 16-foot wind tunnels (16T and 16S), ranging from the training of engineering and operational personnel to the identification and implementation of a number of design and hardware changes to improve performance. He developed a solution to problems related to tunnel starting and stopping loads, exhaust gas scavenging scoop performance, scavenging scoop aerodynamic interference, tunnel flow quality and on-line data system operation.\n\nAfter PWT became operational, he focused most of his attention on optimizing productivity and data quality from this large, high-powered facility. From 1959 to 1969, he led the evolution of 16T into a high-output workhorse tunnel, which attracted a large and continuous backlog of work. At the same time he was boosting productivity in the tunnel, Mr. Hensel was placing an emphasis on improving the quality of test results. His quality initiatives included improved understanding of wall interference, calibration of tunnel flow, definition of measurement uncertainty and enhancements to on-line data processing systems.\n\nHe also directed the restoration of the 16T compressor following catastrophic failure of original steel compressor blades in the early 1960s. It was quickly restored to service with new high technology fiberglass composite blades. In the late 1960s, he spearheaded an advocacy campaign that resulted in $1.25 million funding for the design and construction of the PWT 4-foot transonic tunnel.\n\nEarlier in his career, Mr. Hensel organized and led the contractor's support to the research and development program for AEDC's advanced low density and true temperature wind tunnels. Although never built, these efforts directly supported the acquisition of two AEDC arc heater test units.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to AEDC, Mr. Hensel was inducted as an AEDC Fellow in June 1990.\n\nDENNIS HORN\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a master's in theoretical and applied mechanics from the University of Illinois, Dennis Horn began a remarkable engineering career.\n\nHe began his work at the U.S. Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center's (AEDC) in 1958, after working for a short time as a mechanical engineer for General Electric. He started his career at AEDC by testing ramjets in the Engine Test Facility (ETF), but he quickly became associated with arc heaters.\n\nArc heaters provide unique aerothermal test capabilities for evaluation of thermal protection materials, airframe components, and integrated systems designed for reentry and hypersonic flight.\n\nThe AEDC arc-heated test facilities utilize ahigh voltage, electric arc discharge to heat air to total temperatures up to 13,000 degrees High pressure test flows are achieved by confining the electrical arc discharge in a water-cooled channel capable of withstanding high chamber pressures. The combination of high-enthalpy test gas and high plenum pressure makes possible heat flux simulation representative of flight at speeds in excess of Mach 20 at high dynamic pressures.\n\nHorn started his work on arc heaters when he became part of a special projects group that first looked at using electric arc heaters to provide higher temperatures for turbine engine testing in ETF. Then another group was formed to study the feasibility of developing a high velocity low density wind tunnel.\n\n\"The part that I was involved with was looking at electric arcs as the driver to investigate throat cooling for this low density tunnel,\" Horn said.\n\nSoon AEDC was approached with the idea that the arc heaters could be used for material testing on both nose tips and heat shields. With Horn's help, the AEDC 5 Megawatt (MW) Arc Heater Test Unit became one of the primary arc testing units in the U.S. and achieved a standardized design, which functioned successfully for 20 years.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, he played a similar role in the operational testing of the AEDC Dust Erosion Tunnel, beginning with the initial feasibility study using arc drivers and continuing through the design, construction, shake-down, and a long period of intensive user testing. He developed special test techniques, concentrating on methods of improving dust cloud characterization.\n\nHorn then began the development of a high pressure segmented arc heater, a new type of arc heater introduced at AEDC in the early 1970s. The initial design for the heater was provided through an outside contractor and was sent to AEDC for evaluation. Horn and his team started development of the segmented arc heater by redesigning critical components of the heater, and in its reformation it became known as the AEDC 5 MW segmented arc heater.\n\nAfter 15 years of technical involvement with arc heated test units, he became widely known for his development and troubleshooting of arc heater facilities and improving testing techniques. He became the primary cultivator and technical expert for developing and advancing the segmented arc heater from a two MW laboratory research device to the premier high-performance test facilities used today.\n\nReentry and erosion testing continued in the 5 MW arc heater test units until the mid 1970s, when Horn designed a new high pressure segmented arc heater called H1, were the power levels were increased to 25 MW.\n\n\"It was the first large high pressure segmented arc heater in the country and possibly in the world,\" Horn said.\n\nDuring the early shakedown of the new H1 arc heater, the improved performance and flow cleanliness attracted users to the facility well before development was completed. Horn provided continuous and intensive surveillance of the heater operation, fine-tuning and modifying heater components and operating techniques.\n\n\"We continued to develop that arc heater over the next 10 to 15 years and we were able to test reentry materials, both nose tips and heat shields, using much larger test samples,\" he said. \"We had gone from five megawatts to 25 megawatts, and we continue to operate H1 today. It is still our [AEDC's] primary bread and butter facility for high temperature materials testing.\"\n\nAfter the development of H1, Horn began directing his energies and capabilities to further advance the state of the art in arc technology.\n\n\"My focus has always been on technology and heater development, as opposed to testing,\" he said. \"During the period from 1981 to 1988, I was a supervisor of both testing and technology for the arc heaters. After that I focused primarily on arc heater development and technology.\"\n\n\"In 1990 we got the go ahead to design and develop the H3 segmented arc heater. We were able to operate that heater [H3] to 120 atmospheres pressure and power levels up to 68 MW after only two years of development.\"\n\nHorn also said that AEDC has now installed a new model positioning system in the H3 arc heater facility.\n\n\"H3 will provide still larger flow fields,\" he said. \"Hopefully during this fiscal year we'll be able to begin customer testing there.\"\n\nHorn said the arc heater research and testing that is done here at AEDC is unique.\n\n\"It is basically the only place where this type of high pressure research and development is going on,\" he said. \"NASA has some lower pressure arc facilities and there are one or two private companies that still operate electric arc heaters, but within the Air Force this is the only location.\"\n\nNearly all the design and large arc heater development at AEDC has been centered around Horn's initiative and although he officially retired in 1997, he still works on the base as a part-time employee.\n\n\"I've been out here in some small way every year since 1997,\" he said. \"Now I work just a couple days a month, mostly consulting and also doing some component design.\"\n\nHorn attributed much of his success in arc heater technology to the tremendous support from the Air Force and fellow employee's at AEDC. He has made substantial contributions to the nation's aerospace ground testing capability and was one of the first six scientists honored as an AEDC Fellow in June 1989.\n\nIn his spare time he enjoys studying and photographing wildflowers. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee for Rare Plants in Tennessee and the vice president of the Tennessee Native Plant Society. He was awarded a Certificate of Merit by the State of Tennessee in 2003 for his conservation efforts.\n\nDR. JAMES JACOCKS\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nDr. James Jacocks' contributions to enhance AEDC's flight simulation capabilities brought national recognition to the center in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and earned him recognition as an AEDC Fellow in 1996.\n\nDr. Jacocks, a Sverdrup engineering specialist and 37-year AEDC veteran, made a name for himself early in his AEDC career as an engineering analyst in the transonic wind tunnel arena. He helped develop innovative wind tunnel designs, particularly with the 16-foot transonic tunnel and 4-foot aerodynamic tunnel, which brought him two United States patents.\n\nThe first was for his Swing Link Flexible Wind Tunnel Nozzle. Partnered with Karl Kneile, Dr. Jacocks developed a novel analysis tool for understanding jet engine inlet distortion data.\n\nThey analyzed time-varying inlet pressure data from several aircraft designs and, using statistical methods, proposed a model of distortion with three parameters that were evaluated by fitting inlet data using the method of maximum likelihood. This approach was widely adopted by the engine/airframe integration community.\n\nThe second patent was for his Adaptive Automatic Wall Wind Tunnel. He launched a comprehensive program of wind tunnel experiments and theoretical development, succeeding in proving the validity of local pressure and flow angle as a boundary condition for wall-interference estimates. He also showed that boundary-layer thickness was a dominant parameter for predicting perforated-wall characteristics. From this, he developed a semi-empirical mathematical relation that has been adopted world-wide as the boundary condition for perforated-wall test sections.\n\nWorking with Mr. Kneile again, Dr. Jacocks produced from scratch the world's first production-ready, boundary conforming, finite-volume, three-dimensional, inviscid, non-isentropic flow solver. With this tool, he began routine computational predictions of perforated-wall interference effects.\n\nThe tunnel user could now have a numerical prediction of the interaction of his model and the wind tunnel walls. If he chose, the tunnel user could correct his data and make it more interference-free.\n\nNot only was Dr. Jacocks recognized for extraordinary, fundamental contributions to AEDC's ground simulation capabilities, including outstanding contributions to perforated-wall wind tunnel design and operation, but for leadership in bringing national recognition in the field of CFD.\n\nHis work with computational fluid dynamics earned him the nickname of \"the Father of CFD at AEDC.\" When he started using computers to help predict the interference effects of perforated wind tunnel walls on models, the computer codes of the time were inadequate and he became convinced AEDC had to move more aggressively into the area of computational fluid dynamics.\n\nBecause of his motivation, Dr. Jacocks quickly became the section supervisor of the CFD section located in the center's PWT office. There he established the leading edge of world-class CFD installations. Engineers in his group abandoned the common practice of CFD engineers in the early 1980s of using a proliferation of codes, and, instead, focused on one solver. This gave his group tremendous power in solving routine wind tunnel problems.\n\nDr. Jacocks earned his bachelor's degree at Georgia Tech in 1959. He earned his master's and doctorate degrees at the University of Tennessee Space Institute in 1965 and 1976.\n\nDr. Jacocks passed away in 2001.\n\nROBERT W. 'BOB' KAMM\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nAs the recording secretary and a member of the Scientific Advisory Board, Robert W. \"Bob\" Kamm was involved in coordinating specifications and early plans for AEDC.\n\nFollowing a lengthy coordination process in 1946, the Army Air Forces hoped for the Joint Research and Development Board's early endorsement that would lead to passage of legislation for both the Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan and theAir Engineering Development Center.\n\nDuring 1947, the review of the proposed center became cumbersome, in part because the wind tunnel facilities of the proposed Air Engineering Development Center were treated under the Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan apart from the rest of the Center. The Joint Research and Develpment Boards assigned a screening process for both the Wind Tunnel Plan and the Air Engineering DevelopmenCenter to its Committee on Aeronautics.\n\nWith his appointment as Executive Director of that committee's Facilities Panel in 1948, Mr. Kamm began his distinguished associationwith what would become Arnold Engineering Development Center.\n\nMr. Kamm graduated from New York University in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering and joined the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, where he investigated spin characteristics of various military aircraft in wind tunnels.\n\nIn 1946 he left the NACA to become senior aerodynamicist with the Glenn L. Martin Company.\n\nIn 1948, Mr. Kamm began working in the Pentagon as director of the panel on facilities committee on aeronautics of the Department of Defense's Research and Development Board. In the capacity of Executive Director, Mr. Kamm reviewed, coordinated and recommended action to the panel on all military departments' proposals for new aeronautical research and development facilities, including their relative priorities.\n\nOwing to his monumental efforts to overcome significant interservice conflicts over the scope and breadth of the initial Air Force proposals for the center, in early 1950, Mr. Kamm was appointed staff assistant to Dr. Theodore von Karman, chairman of the USAF Scientific Advisory Board, in his new capacity of chief, scientific advisor to the AirEngineering Development Division.\n\nMr. Kamm, executive secretary of the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser, worked closely with Dr. von Karman, Dr. Frank Wattendorf and Col. H. F. Gregory to handle day-to-day coordination in the Pentagon and to develop plans and requirements for the technical facilities to be provided by AEDC. He also maintained action liaison not only with the Research and Development Board but also with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the aeronautical industry.\n\nIn October 1951, Mr. Kamm organized the Industry and Educational Advisory Board. This board, chaired by Professor John Markham of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, consisted of representatives of universities and the aeronautical industry. It met frequently to give advice to the USAF Chief of Staff of the adequacy of planning forAEDC and simultaneously created a spirit of cooperation with educational institutions\n\nand with the aeronautical industry. The later close working relation between the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) and AEDC was in no small measure due to the significant role that Mr. Kamm played in both the Industry and Educational Advisory Boards and during the 1960s through the 1980s at UTSI.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Industry and Educational AdvisoryBoards, Mr. Kamm was appointed Chief of AEDC's Operations Analysis Office, a position in which he remained until 1955, when he was assigned Assistant Chief, Research and Development Division.\n\nIn December 1956, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, and in May 1957, he became the Center's first Chief, Plans and Policy Office.\n\nIn 1959 he left AEDC after he accepted an appointment as director of NASA's western operations office in Santa Monica, Calif., responsible for contract negotiations and administration, public information, technical representation, financial management, security, legal and patent administration.\n\nIn 1968 he retired from that position and NASA to become assistant to the director of UTSI. He was assistant dean and director of administrative serves until his retirement in 1988. The following year, he was backUTSI to direct the year-long Silver Anniversary Celebration.\n\nIn May 1995, during the kick off of the AEDC Heritage Foundation, Carey Waldrip, then Heritage Foundation chairman, presented Mr. Kamm with a proclamation signed of the AEDC community for this dedication to the improvement of the aerospace industry.\n\n\"Mr. Kamm was instrumental in both the early legislative and planning phase of AEDC,\" said Mr. Waldrip. \"In Dr. Theodore von Karman's 1959 dedication speech, he named Bob Kamm as an instrumental force in the founding of AEDC.\"\n\nLater that same year, a portion of the UTSI Road from Estill Springs to the B.H. Goethert Parkway as renamed in honor of Kamm, who was largely responsible for the road's construction.\n\n\"Mr. Kamm played a major role in negotiating with the University of Tennessee to establish a master's level program at AEDC which led to the establishment of the Space Institute,\" said then UTSI vice president Dr. T. Dwayne McCay. \"Years later he came to UTSI as assistant to the director, Dr. B.H. Goethert. He has been incredibly important to the institute, but he always avoids the spotlight. We are pleased to have this opportunity to honor him as he so richly deserves.\"\n\nMr. Kamm passed away June 13, 2001.\n\nDICK MATTHEWS\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nDuring his 32-year AEDC career, AEDC Fellow Richard \"Dick\" Matthews was instrumental in developing concepts and implementing new wind tunnel test capabilities. Gaining a reputation as a world-wide leader in wind tunnel and experimental aerothermodynamics, Mr. Matthews' contributions to AEDC included the true temperature Mach 4 wind tunnel; rain/ice test capability; Tunnel C radiant heater; and 25-inch-diameter Mach 8 tunnel.\n\nAs a lead contractor engineer, Mr. Matthews developed innovative test techniques, such as thermo mapping, materials testing, magnetic suspension testing and environmental testing. He provided leadership and supervision of the engineering staff responsible for conducting tests, analyzing data and developing new technology. He was also responsible for recruiting and training young engineers and assisting government and industry representatives in planning, conducting, analyzing and reporting test results.\n\nHe worked on special projects including the independent review team for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) and marketed AEDC capabilities nationally and internationally.\n\nHe helped organize and host \"Hypersonic Test and Evaluation Workshop,\" which provided the opportunity for the nation's most experienced hypersonic experts to pass some of their knowledge on to the next generation of engineers.\n\nHis contributions to experimental aerothermodynamics led to his selection as an AEDC Fellow in 1995.\n\nMr. Matthews was an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), a member of the AIAA Flight Test Technical Committee, AIAA Thermophysics Technical Committee and was the Chairman/Co-Originator of the Aerothermal Workshop. He served as an AIAA section chairman He received a bachelor of science in aerospace engineering from the University of St. Louis in 1959 and, in 1967, earned a master of science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Tennessee.\n\nMr. Matthews served as an Air Force aircraft maintenance officer until 1962, when he came to work for AEDC. He started his career at AEDC as a project engineer and worked his way to lead engineer. Mr. Matthews served as a member of the Heat Transfer Panel for the Navy Aeroballistic Committee. In 1993, he was co-originator and a principal speaker at the Von Karman Institute, Brussels, for short course titled, \"Methodology of Hypersonic Testing.\"\n\nMr. Matthews presented technical papers at many aerospace conferences.\n\nWhile working at AEDC, he served as a representative for the Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development (AGARD) Working Group 18, and served as one of five technical panel members for the Department of Defense Windows Symposium and for NASA Orbiter Experiments Symposium.\n\nDuring Mr. Matthews' career at AEDC, he also worked part-time at the University of Texas, Air Force Academy, University of Tennessee, Naval Surface Warfare Center, General Dynamics Corp., and Motlow State Community College developing and teaching short courses. He was also a founding member of the AEDC Heritage Foundation, Inc.\n\nHe passed away in 1997.\n\nDR. JAMES G. MITCHELL\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nGrowing up in Luverne, Ala., James Mitchell could not have imagined the opportunities he would later have working in the world's most dynamic test and evaluation complex.\n\nIn 1953, before graduating from Auburn University and before becoming married to his childhood sweetheart, Dr. Mitchell came to AEDC as an engineering aide who worked in the Engine Test Facility. Dr. Mitchell came back to AEDC as an Air Force lieutenant after graduating from the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. He quickly realized the Air Force was not a career path he wanted to pursue but knew he wanted to stay at AEDC.\n\nIn 1957 he took off his uniform and joined the center's contractor, ARO, as a project engineer working in von Kármán Gas Dynamics Facility (VKF) Tunnel B. He later moved from the contractor work force to the Air Force civil service where he worked until 1988. During this time, he continued his education with degrees from the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) and Vanderbilt.\n\nAdvocacy for ASTF\n\nDr. Mitchell said he describes himself as a risk taker and taking risks is exactly what he did. If it wasn't for his boldness and belief in aerospace technology, some of the facilities in which we work may not have come into existence.\n\n\"The most productive part of my life was when I was heading up facility planning,\" he explained specifically talking about his involvement with the Aeropropulsion Systems Test Facility (ASTF). \"Some very good engineers with both the Air Force and contractor joined to plan a number of the facilities seen out there today: ASTF, APTU, Mark 1 and J-6; basically anything that was not part of the original plan.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Mitchell, from the beginning ASTF was not supported by many in Washington because it was considered too big and too expensive.\n\n\"I ended up being the guy who was given the job to go to Washington and convince the Air Force, DoD and Congress to find the funding for this facility,\" he said. \"No one thought we would succeed, and I wasn't sure myself, but with the support of some key individuals, it all came together. At that time ASTF was the most expensive military construction program (MCP) project ever attempted. It took all of the Air Force MCP for the year and a large part of MCP from both Army and Navy.\"\n\nAs most engineers can attest, it takes longer to design and build a major test facility than it does to design and build the weapon system that will be tested in it. Dr. Mitchell demonstrated exceptional foresight in planning and acquiring advanced test facilities needed to keep pace with rapidly advancing aircraft, missile and space programs of the late 20th century.\n\nEra as Chief Scientist\n\n\"I finally got the job I wanted,\" Dr. Mitchell said about his promotion to chief scientist in 1984. \"Back then, the chief scientist was the technical job at the center and provided opportunity to get involved in all aspects of AEDC operations.\"\n\nHis primary function as chief scientist was to advise and assist the commander on scientific and technical matters relating to AEDC, ranging from testing to research programs. He also served as a liaison in technical matters with officials at all levels of government, industry, scientific and educational organizations, as well as with other countries.\n\nIn a quote from a 1984 article, Dr. Mitchell said, \"I consider the chief scientist as having a kind of leavening effect. I look at the job from the view point of both the short-term and long-term technical interests of the center. A lot of technology and facility programs take a long time to mature and pay off, and it takes top level support during these programs to make sure things keep moving.\"\n\nDr. Mitchell is an internationally recognized expert in aerospace ground testing, and his advice is sought through many channels. He was a U.S. member on the propulsion and energetics panel of the NATO Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development (AGARD). He has chaired a NATO group through technical and political turmoil to calibrate engine test facilities in five countries. He is routinely invited to serve on and chair joint service, DoD and NASA committees to determine national test facility needs.\n\nYears after AEDC\n\nAfter leaving AEDC, Dr. Mitchell went to work for Micro Craft Inc. from 1988 to 1998 where he served as executive vice president-chief operating officer, and came back to AEDC as president of Micro Craft Technology to operate aeronautical and space test facilities.\n\nIn 1998, he started a small business, Surface Treatment Technologies Inc., which was located in the UTSI research park. The business is now located in Baltimore, Md. During the early 1990s, he served for four years on the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, chairing a major study of the Air Force Test & Evaluation infrastructure.\n\nDuring his 33-year career as an Air Force officer and a civilian employee, Dr. Mitchell received several awards, including two exceptional civilian service decorations and the French government's Medaille de Aeronautique.\n\nHe is a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and in 1983 received its ground testing award for the year's most significant contribution to aeronautical testing. He had earlier received two special awards from the Tennessee Section for outstanding accomplishments in 1969 and 1977.\n\nIn 1989, he was included in the first group to be selected as AEDC Fellows for his long-term contributions to the center and aerospace testing.\n\nDr. Mitchell currently works as a consultant to the Department of Defense through the Institute for Defense Analysis in Washington.\n\nIn this capacity, he is presently assisting AEDC in their hypersonic research and facility programs.\n\nTHOMAS PERKINS\n\nPROJECT PIONEER\n\nWhen his teacher asked Tom Perkins what he wanted to be when he grew up, the seventh grader shot up his hand and confidently replied, \"Either an aeronautical engineer or an Army Air Corps officer.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old retired Arnold Engineering Development Center engineer said one of his young classmates' questioned the likelihood of such ambitious aspirations.\n\n\"My friend called out to me and said, 'Hey Tom, you don't have the \"smarts\" for that,' \" Perkins recalled with a laugh. \"But I really knew what I wanted, even then.\"\n\nPerkins was born in 1929; two years after American pilot Charles Lindbergh made his historic solo trans-Atlantic crossing - an event that brought aviation fever to millions the world over. Growing up in the shadow of such a landmark event had a powerful influence on the young boy from Bowling Green, Ky.\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Perkins originally set his sights on attending the Georgia Institute of Technology, better known as Georgia Tech, in Atlanta. Due to the flood of ex-servicemen applying to the school's engineering program following the end of World War II, his older friends advised him to start college somewhere more accessible.\n\nTaking their advice, he enrolled at Western Kentucky University in his hometown. Two years later, Perkins transferred to Georgia Tech and during a break got his first introduction to AEDC.\n\n\"I was a junior at Georgia Tech and I had a friend who needed a ride up to Arnold because he had taken a job here,\" Perkins recalled. \"This was in 1951 and I didn't even know this place existed. My friend said, 'Not many people know about it, we're just getting started.'\"\n\nPerkins dropped his friend off at the center's main gate and drove on.\n\nUpon graduating with a degree in aeronautical engineering from Georgia Tech, Perkins worked at the 20-foot wind tunnel at Wright Field, Ohio.\n\n\"I was working for Dr. Bernard Goethert, who was the head of the whole wind tunnel facility up there,\" he recalled. \"I could hardly understand him - with his broken German. He probably couldn't understand me, but anyhow we worked it out. Doc was a great guy. He later did a lot for both AEDC and UTSI.\"\n\nTwo months later, Perkins was ordered to active duty in the Air Force, having obtained his commission through the Reserve Officers Training Corps program at Georgia Tech. After going to Lackland Air Force Base, Texas for indoctrination training, he reported to Keesler AFB in Biloxi, Miss. for airborne radar training.\n\n\"I took airborne electronics and after graduating from that school I went to Korea in 1953 for a year with a fighter interceptor squadron,\" Perkins said. \"They didn't have much in the way of electronics on a fighter plane so they made me an armament and communication officer.\"\n\nIn that position, one of his responsibilities included bore sighting and ensuring the accuracy of the F-86's six machine guns. He vividly remembers when he and his crew went out to shoot the plane's machine guns and watched as tracer rounds illuminated the cold night sky. This allowed them to adjust the line of fire so that 90 percent of the bullets hit inside a three-foot diameter bull's-eye at 1,000 feet.\n\n\"Our fighter interceptor squadron had the best record in June 1953- they shot down more MIGs that month than anybody else,\" he said.\n\nIn March 1954, he was honorably discharged and returned to his family's home in Bowling Green to help his father put in a gas pipeline. He then went to work at Redstone Arsenal in the Army's Ballistic Missile Command at Huntsville, Ala.\n\n\"They put me to work on a drawing board - I wasn't too happy about that,\" he recalled. \"I worked nine months there and then I decided to use my GI Bill to go to graduate school at the University of Michigan. I didn't realize how cold it got there. I think it was as cold as Korea. I arrived there in January, and I didn't see green grass until May.\"\n\nDespite the inhospitable weather, Perkins enjoyed his time at the school.\n\n\"The University of Michigan is a very good school for aerospace (engineering),\" he said. However, after a year and a half, he was running out of money and realized he would have to go back to work. He went to work for Glenn L. Martin in Baltimore.\n\n\"That is where I got into flutter work,\" he recalled.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Perkins said aviation pioneer Glenn L. Martin had founded the U.S. aircraft company, the predecessor to Lockheed Martin, in 1912.\n\nPerkins explained that flutter is a self-starting vibration that occurs when a lifting surface, like a wing or a tail surface, bends under aerodynamic loads because the aerodynamic loads overcome the structural damping of the surface.\n\n\"In extreme cases the elasticity of the structure, when the load on it is reduced, causes it to spring back so far that it overshoots and causes a new aerodynamic load in the opposite direction to the original,\" he continued. \"If this continues with enough force and long enough the structure can be seriously damaged or destroyed.\"\n\nThe company put Perkins to work in the dynamics section and assigned him to evaluate the P-6M SeaMaster. The experience would help to lay the groundwork for his future at AEDC. The SeaMaster was a swept-wing seaplane powered by four jet engines with the body incorporating a new hull design. Some aviation experts claimed the aircraft was the most sophisticated flying boat constructed at the time.\n\nHowever, Perkins said design flaws with the aircraft's tail proved disastrous, resulting in two crashes, one of which was fatal for the crew.\n\n\"The second time it crashed was when I was there,\" he recalled. \"We built a flutter model and tested it in the wind tunnel at the University of Maryland. We kept telling the Design Team that they needed to change the design, take the dihedral "
