I've not always had the revised scales of pay following these changes, so, when announced, I've usually included the announcement, when possible, and linked the headline from this page to the article concerned in order to avoid creating a whole new table for everyone.\n\nb. Good Conduct Badges created in 1849 for those with V.G. Conduct at a 1d. per diem per badge to a maximum of 3 badges.\n\nc. Increased rates of pay paid to Surgeons when there was a shortage, in addition to the creation of new ranks such as the Staff Surgeon and the Fleet Surgeon, with increased pay, in subsequent years with a view to retaining experienced surgeons. Similar things were done for Engineer Officers, but whilst they helped a little, foreign navies and merchant service companies often paid better wages, although some engineers who went abroad, especially to South America, reported difficulties getting paid......so not always a good idea. For an example of this see Thomas Cochrane and his return from South America, having borrowed their ship to return home penniless, with, ISTR, seamen from that vessel walking the streets of Portsmouth in rags and almost having to beg for food, although I gather a lot of the good citizens of Portsmouth helped feed these men, probably having followed their exploits in the Hampshire Telegraph.\n\nAdmiralty may place an Officer Retired by Reason of Misconduct, &c., on the lowest or any other intermediate Half-Pay of his Rank - 1860.\n\nAdmiralty may place an officer who by intemperate habits may have rendered himself Unfit for Further Service on a lower scale of Half-Pay than the minimum rate of Half-Pay of his Rank - 1864\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nIndex to Extracts from Various Navy Lists 1844-1879 detailing the officers mentioned\n\nConsolidated extracts from the Navy Lists for Dec 1843, Jun 1844, Dec 1848, Jun 1870 and Jun 1879 - with details of officers appointments.\n\nAdmiralty Memoranda etc. from the newspapers for 1840s :\n\nSurvey of Ships Taken Up by Government\n\nPacket Service\n\nAug 1841 - Packet Service / Schedule\n\nThe Navy List 1844 - Items as dated\n\nBlane - Sir Gilbert Blane's Medal\n\nChaplains\n\nCharts, Admiralty - Appointment of Agent to Sell\n\nClothing - Allowances for the Loss of Clothing, Instruments &c. - 1842.\n\nComparable Ranks\n\nDeaths of Officers reported quarter ended 20th March, 1844\n\nDocuments\n\nEmigration of Officers - Grants etc.\n\nGreenwich School\n\nHalf Pay\n\nInstructors\n\nLosses - Allowance for loss of Clothing & Instruments Etc.\n\nMarine Cadets - Rules for Entry - Examinations etc.\n\nMasters' Assistants\n\nMates - Rules and Regulations\n\nMedals - Award of Turkish Medals\n\nRegulations for the Entry and Rating of Young Gentlemen and Captains' Clerks, on board H.M.
