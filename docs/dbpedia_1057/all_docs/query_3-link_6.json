        "text": "Died: 15 October 1914\n\nThis name on the Mosman War Memorial is probably Reginald William Davis of the Royal Navy, who grew up in Mosman and whose parents were living in Heydon Street, Mosman at the time of his death.\n\nReginald William Davis died when his ship, HMS Aboukir, was sunk by a German submarine in the North Sea on 22 September 1914. His death was reported in The Sydney Morning Herald on 6 October 1914 and The Catholic Press on 15 October 1914. The articles give biographical details including his connection to Mosman.\n\nThe other Australian in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database named R Davis, is Roy Henry Davis who was serving at the time of his death with HMAS Penguin (a submarine depot ship, not the Balmoral base which was established in the 1940s). His home address was Hornsby and therefore unlikely to be the R. Davis on the Mosman War Memorial. [JSB]"
