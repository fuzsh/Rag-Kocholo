        "text": "Brought together by retired naval officer turned deep sea explorer Victor Vescovo, the team included deep sea specialists, but also former astronaut Kathy Sullivan and renowned mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien.\n\nInvited along was Durdana Ansari, a former journalist who now works to improve the diversity and representation in her role as an Honorary Commander of the Royal Navy.\n\n'It was an opportunity to show the expedition through my eyes, as the first ever Muslim Honorary Commander for the Royal Navy,' explains Durdana. 'I wanted to tell the story in my own way, whatever I saw and whatever I did.'\n\nBut the expedition was also used as a way to secure an incredibly rare sample of water for the Museum from the deepest part of the ocean.Â\n\nGoing half way across the planet during a pandemic is not how it was meant to happen, but after three days of travelling, multiple tests and time spent in quarantine, Durdana made it Guam and onto the DSSV Pressure Drop, the boat that would whisk her off to the Mariana Trench. Â\n\n'Getting on the Pressure Drop was the most amazing welcome,' recounts Durdana. 'My heart had a different heartbeat, all along it changed.\n\n'I had no idea if this kind of experience would ever happen again, so I cherished every second of it.'\n\nThe boat carried around 30 people out into the ocean, with the journey out taking around 24 hours. During this time the boat would roll and turn with the power of the vast ocean, the waves breaking against the boat and coming halfway up the porthole in Durdana's cabin.\n\n'We stayed on the trench for ten days, during which the crew conducted six dives in the submersible,' explains Durdana. 'The sub can fit two people, with Victor as the diver and then another a passenger. The first dive included Kathy.\n\n'So Kathy became the first American woman to walk in space, and then the first woman to go down to the deepest part of the ocean. It felt like such a special day.'\n\nEach complete dive takes 12 hours. The submersible takes about four hours to go down, spends another two and a half hours going along the bottom, before spending another four hours to come back up.\n\nGoing that deep underwater is a truly astonishing feat of engineering and endurance.\n\nA dive into the unknown\n\nAt the surface of the ocean sunlight breaks through the water, feeding blooms of tiny plankton, powering vast coral reefs and warming the top layer of water.\n\nMost species in the oceans live within just a few hundred metres of the surface, taking advantage of these warmer waters and the energy that the sun provides.\n\nBy the time you reach just 200 metres beneath the surface, you enter the twilight zone. All light visible to the human eye has been filtered out and the inky black water has dropped to just four degrees.\n\nSo little light penetrates down to this layer that primary production, that is the production of energy using carbon dioxide dissolved in the water, becomes impossible.\n\nIt is in this dark region that species start to have to create their own light, with many fish and invertebrates becoming bioluminescent. They flash brilliant yellows, reds and blues for a variety of reasons, such as to attract prey, mates or even to confuse predators.\n\nGoing deeper still and the things start to get even more extreme. The deepest diving mammal, the Cuvier's beaked whale, taps out at around 2,964 metres, and by 4,267 metres you reach the average depth of the world's oceans.\n\nThe temperature here hovers just above freezing, while the enormous weight of water above exerts an astonishing amount of pressure. This has a dramatic influence of the species of animals that, despite all the odds, still manage to thrive at these depths.Â\n\nThe muddy, empty plains that stretches for thousands of kilometres in all directions at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean are home to a huge diversity of marine invertebrates that live in the sediment feeding on the bits of food that steadily fall as marine snow. Enormous towering seamounts that rise from these open seafloors support a plethora of crustaceans such as shrimps and crabs. Even some species of fish, like the abyssal grenadier, manage to live down here.\n\nBut there is still further to go.\n\nSome parts of the seafloor are ripped open, huge tears plunging ever deeper into the Earth. One of these canyons, stretching north to south for 2,500 kilometres in the western Pacific, is the Mariana Trench.\n\nThe deepest point of the Trench is the Challenger Deep, so called as it was first measured during the Challenger expedition in 1875. Using nothing but a weighted rope, they recorded a depth of 8,184 metres, which is incidentally almost exactly the same depth that the deepest known vertebrate has been recorded after a snailfish was filmed at 8,178 metres in 2017.\n\nThese extraordinary creatures can be found in many of the deep oceanic trenches and are highly adapted to these extreme conditions. Looking not unlike giant pinkish-white tadpoles, they have large heads and small eyes, are covered in thin gelatinous skin dotted with a well-developed sensory system and even produce pressure-tolerant cartilage and pressure-stable proteins.Â\n\nOn a day when the rest of the world was coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, Victor and Kathy descended down to 10,927 metres making history in more ways than one.\n\nNot only is this the deepest anyone has ever gone, but Kathy became the first woman ever to go down into the Challenger Deep. In the process of this, she is now the only person ever to have walked in space and descended to the deepest point in the oceans.\n\nVanessa, who also accompanied Victor down into the depths, was keen to collect a sample of water from the bottom of the trench, one of which the Museum was lucky enough to receive.Â\n\nWhile during the dive to the bottom the crew saw little in terms of life (although they did spot some ever-present plastic), it is hoped that these water samples can reveal otherwise.\n\nIt is known that some invertebrates can survive the freezing temperatures and crushing pressure, such as some of the largest single-celled organisms. Known as Monothalamea, these giant amoebae can reach over 20 centimetres in size.\n\nIt is hoped that suspended within the water sample are microorganisms and fragments of DNA that could reveal some of the extraordinary creatures which live in the Challenger Deep. Â\n\nDr Anne Jungblut is a researcher at the Museum who focuses on microorganisms that live in extreme environments.\n\n'We know less about the bottom of the ocean than the surface of the moon,' explains Anne. 'Very few people have been to the deep sea, and so it is a really exciting place.'\n\nThe water sample doesn't look like much, to the degree that after transporting the sample back to the UK and storing it in her fridge Durdana was slightly worried she might accidentally use it to cook with. But what it represents and the secrets it could hold are invaluable.\n\n'It looks very unsuspecting,' says Anne. 'It just looks like a drinking water bottle filled with murky water, but it is really special. It is still quite rare to have samples from down there, as it takes a lot of time, effort and logistics to get them.'\n\nIn addition to the water sample being tested for DNA to see what may be living down there, it also offers another astonishingly rare opportunity. When the Challenger expedition plunged the depths of the Trench over 100 years ago, it too collected samples of water from the deep which are still held by the Museum. This means that researchers may now be able to compare this modern sample with those collected in 1875, giving us an insight into how things may have changed. Â"
