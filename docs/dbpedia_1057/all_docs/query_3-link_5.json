        "text": "The Airmen's Stories - Sgt. W L Davis\n\nWilliam Lance Davis was born on 19th March 1919 in Spondon, Derby, the son of Lancelot Samuel Davis (1891-1939) and Phyllis Emily Davis (nee Meakin 1897-1986).\n\nLS Davis was commissioned in the Royal Fusiliers in March 1915 and served until March 1918 when he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps.\n\nAfter training as a pilot he was posted to 155 Squadron which was preparing for service with the DH9A. Davis was aboard a DH9A that crashed at Tidworth on 28th October 1918 and he was unconscious for several days. The war ended before the squadron was operational.\n\n***************************\n\nAbove image courtesy of Hinckley Museum.\n\nHis brother, William Rhys Lancelot Davis (above), served as a Captain with the Sherwood Foresters (Notts and Derby Regiment) and was killed in action on 23rd April 1917. He is commemorated on the Arras Memorial.\n\n***************************\n\nIn April 1939 Lancelot Samuel Davis, weakened by influenza and deeply worried about how the coming war would affect his three sons, took his own life.\n\n***************************\n\nWilliam Lance Davis joined the RAFVR about October 1938 as an Airman u/t Pilot.\n\nCalled up on 1st September 1939, he completed his training at 5 FTS Sealand and arrived at 6 OTU Sutton Bridge on 6th July 1940 to convert to Hurricanes.\n\nHe joined 249 Squadron on 5th August. He served with the squadron throughout the rest of the Battle of Britain.\n\nAbove: 249 Squadron - P/O Crossey, P/O WL Davis and P/O HJJ Beazley.\n\nCommissioned in February 1941, Davis was shot down on the 10th of that month in Hurricane I V7171 on Circus 4 (escorting Blenheims to Dunkirk) by Me109s.\n\nHe was captured, with a badly injured leg, and spent the rest of the war as a PoW.\n\nPostwar he was a director of the Hinckley Building Society.\n\nDavis died in March 1984 in Leicestershire.\n\n***************************\n\nHis brother, Richard James Lance Davis, was commissioned in the Royal Marines on 1st September 1939 and later posted to HMS Repulse.\n\nHe was one of those rescued when the ship was sunk by Japanese bombers on 10th December 1941. Taken to Singapore, he was captured when it fell to the Japanese in February 1942.\n\nDavis was sent to work on the Burma-Thailand railway and assisted in treating the sick. This led to him studying medicine at St Johnâ€™s, Cambridge in 1946-49 and a distinguished career.\n\nA third son served in the Royal Navy and survived the war."
