HMS Albion

Albion joined the 8th Battle Squadron, of the Channel Fleet in August 1914, and sailed to Cape of Good Hope and East Africa.

In February 1915, she was sent to The Dardenelles .

She was damaged by Turkish shellfire during bombardments on 28 April and 2 May 1915, including grounding off Gaba Tepe.

In October 1915 she transported troops to Salonika.

She returned to England and was stationed on the East Coast as guardship.

HMS Vivid

During the First World War HMS Vivid was a Royal Navy base at Devonport, a district of Plymouth.

A number of ships were renamed HMS Vivid whilst serving as depot ships for the base, HMS Cuckoo (launched in 1873), was a torpedo gunboat that was HMS Vivid between 1912 and 1920.

Some men served at the base for the duration of the war, others could be recorded as serving on HMS Vivid when between ships, on leave or on route to hospital etc.

The Stonehouse Naval Hospital was a mile from the Devonport base. For casualities coming to the UK from ships in the Atlantic, Stonehouse was the first large UK Naval hospital that they would reach.

There were a lot of casualties. Over 5000 British ships were lost in the First World War.

The Royal Navy Devonport dockyard was a part of the base. During WW1 the yard built battle cruisers, cruisers, dreadnoughts and submarines.

These all used the cutting-edge technology of the time as did the battle ship HMS Warspite and the steam-driven J5 submarine shown here.

Experts in every related field were gathered to help develop and test new designs for the best possible vessels and weapons to equip them.

The most capable people available would have trained those responsible for training others in using these newly developed technologies.

Naval Trawlers

Vivid III was the part of the Devonport base relating to the Trawler Division.

At the outbreak of the First World War about 3000 civilian steam fishing trawlers were put into military service and more than 39,000 fishermen joined the Trawler Section of the Royal Naval Reserve to crew the ships they knew so well.

They cleared mines from sea routes, and attacked enemy submarines.

This was vitally important work, the Maritime Archeology Trust estimate that in 1918 alone, enemy U-boats sank 5896 British vessels.

Fishing vessels on Admiralty service played a role in something in the region of 20 per cent of all allied U-boat sinkings during 1918.
