Sonex Aircraft LLC is VERY sensitive to engine installations that are not authorized by or supported from the factory. The only authorized engines are the AeroVee, the Jabiru 2200, and the Jabiru 3300.\n\nThese links are posted for builders or prospective builders to perform their own research if they are interested in engine alternatives. The nature of experimental aviation is that builders can and will try different combinations of engines and propellers on their aircraft.\n\nThis list is not comprehensive or complete, and does not show all available engine alternatives for the Sonex line of aircraft."
