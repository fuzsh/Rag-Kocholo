        "text": "As of 10-26-03\n\nThe prop is an Ed Sterba 60 x 72. Ed says that there is a 50-50 chance that it will need to be re-pitched to about 70. I have more wing span than most KR's so the climb performance may be adequate with this much prop but I will not know until flight testing begins.\n\n(Click the image for a\n\nlarger version) There is an access hatch on each side of the fuselage header tank. Three clevis pins are on each side of the hatch, bedded in flox, and they protrude through a molded flange inside the top of the fuselage. Two pieces of piano wire goes through the clevis pins, one on each side. There is a circle bent in the end of the piano wire. This is the mounting location for a piece of safety wire that will keep the piano wire in place. Pull out the two piece of piano wire and then the hatch can be removed. There is access to all of the header tank instrumentation, the rudder pedals, battery, and the top of the engine mount bolts."
