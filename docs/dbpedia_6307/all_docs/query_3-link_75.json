On my IIL I have a Sterba 52 x 46. A lot of guys run 52x48. What are you looking for?\n\nPost by daddo2 on\n\nI have a S-II with an Aerovee 2180. Using a Sterba 54X46 that seems to work well. My buddy has a KR2 with a Revmaster 2.1, same prop.\n\nPost by shanenothdurft on\n\nthanks for the info on the prop size i talked with ed sterba and he told me the same my prop looks old and unsafe im looking for the best prop for my aerovee 2180 also does anyone know anything about the aerovee injector carb my engine also has this carb and im just needing some info\n\nPost by shanenothdurft on\n\nmy 2180 has a 2 inch wooden prop extension does anyone know where i can get a aluminum one or some kind of fix for this situation the prop has to be extended because of the cowling\n\nPost by hans on\n\nThese have SAE-1 bolt patterns, which might not be suitable for a retrofit without also replacing the flange.\n\nPost by smoothmat on\n\nWhen i got mine hub spacer made i just went down to local machine shop and got them to spin one up. I took them the crush plate for a template and told them how thick i need the spacer. Once they had the hub made with the bolt pattern i got them to drill 1\" hole in between the bolt pattern to lighten it up a bit. Works good and only cost 200.00\n\nI have a picture of it before i installed it, although i am not sure how to post it on here.\n\nPost by hans on\n\ndoes anyone know if revmaster and the aerovee have the same bolt patteren\n\nsee revmasterautomotive.com/revmasteraviation/?p=308\n\nand www.aeroconversions.com/products/aerovee/index.html\n\nit's all there..."
