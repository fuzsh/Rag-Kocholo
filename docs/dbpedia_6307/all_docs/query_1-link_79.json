But on an alumni trip\n\nto Italy back in August, I experienced something extra cool.\n\nAbout a month before the trip,\n\nI got an email from one of the\n\nparticipants, Tom Rowan â75 Bus\n\nCap. He said heâd be traveling with\n\nhis girlfriend, Christine Thrashâ\n\nand was planning to propose to\n\nher during the trip. Did I have any\n\nthoughts, he wondered, on where\n\nand when?\n\nI knew that the 16-day tour\n\nwould include some pretty romantic sitesâVenice, for example. But\n\nwe wouldnât be in Venice until the\n\nvery end, and I told Tom, âI canât\n\nimagine youâd be able to stand waiting that long.â His reply: âYouâre\n\nprobably rightâI donât think I can\n\nwait until Venice. I just hope I can\n\nwait until we get to Italy.â\n\nSo I helped put him in touch\n\nwith some people from the tour\n\ncompany, Odysseys Unlimited, who\n\nsuggested a romantic restaurant\n\nwith a seaside view in Amalfi, the\n\ntown weâd visit on the first full day.\n\nTom went online and made reservations, and from then until the time\n\nof the trip, my only responsibilityâ\n\nand my toughest challengeâwas to keep my mouth shut. It\n\nwas all I could do to not post to Facebook: âIâm hosting a trip\n\nto Italy, where one of the passengers is going to ask his girlfriend to marry him!ââor, when meeting the 24 Penn State\n\ntravelers at the Naples airport, not blurt out to Christine, âI\n\nknow youâyouâre the one getting engaged tomorrow!â\n\nOn the appointed day, the trip director led us on a walking tour of Amalfi, then turned us loose for some free time.\n\nTom and Chris headed off on their\n\nown, and we didnât see them again\n\nuntil we all met up back at the bus\n\na few hours later. As Tom and Chris\n\nwalked down the hill toward the\n\nbus, I couldnât contain my excitement any longer, and asked the\n\nothers, âCan anyone tell if sheâs got\n\na ring?â Indeed she did, and as the\n\nnewly engaged couple stepped up\n\nonto the bus, everyone broke out in\n\napplause.\n\nAt dinner that night, Tom and\n\nChris took turns telling us all the\n\ntale: Chris recalled how Tom acted\n\nstrangely antsy about getting to the\n\nrestaurant on time; Tom told us how\n\nhe stood up from the table, gazed\n\nout at the view, and said to Chris:\n\nâThis is all so perfect. Thereâs only\n\nthing that would make it more perfectââat which point he got out the\n\nring box and dropped to one kneeâ\n\nâand thatâs if youâd be my wife.â\n\nWe went on to have a spectacular tripâwe toured the Coliseum\n\nand the Vatican Museum in Rome,\n\nadmired the opulent cathedrals in\n\nOrvieto and Florence, spent four\n\nglorious days in Tuscany, savored\n\ngondola rides in Venice. But itâs\n\nhard to top that first day on the\n\nAmalfi Coast, when we all had the\n\nprivilege of sharing in one coupleâs\n\nspecial milestone.\n\nNo word yet on where the wedding will be. Last I heard,\n\nTom and Chris were undecided. But the rest of us are unanimous: A destination wedding in Italy would be perfect.\n\nFROM THE EDITOR\n\nNovember/December 2015 THE PENN STATER 5\n\nShe Said âYes!â\n\nOn an Alumni Association trip to Italy, a Penn Stater pops the question.\n\nTINA HAY â83 BUS (2)\n\nTina Hay â83 Bus, Editor\n\n[email protected] | Twitter: @tinahay\n\nmous: A destination w\n\nTi H â83 B Edit\n\nHAPPY COUPLE: Tom and Christine on the\n\nAmalfi Coast above Positano, a day after getting\n\nengaged.

This article was\n\nso informative, colorful, and\n\nfun. With a degree in elementary education I think\n\nthe âFrom Cow to Coneâ\n\nillustration [p. 31] is âclassroom perfect.â While academics often dwell on pages\n\nand pages of words, this one\n\nillustration confirms that,\n\nno matter the age group, a\n\npicture is worth a thousand\n\nwords. It characterizes one\n\nof the main goals of visualization: making it possible\n\nto absorb data quickly. This\n\nmagazine is now on its\n\nway to relatives in California. Congrats to the magazine staff and the Creameryâs 150 years of yummy\n\nsuccess!\n\nMary Lynne Spazok\n\nUpper St. Clair, Pa.\n\nThanks for the article on\n\nthe Berkey Creamery.\n\nAmong lots of other facts\n\nthat I didnât know, I\n\nlearned that if I make âthe\n\nperfect order,â I will get\n\nâtwo scoops to a coneâno\n\nmixing allowed.â Then, two\n\npages later, I saw a single\n\ncone mounted with what\n\nappears to be two different\n\nflavors. Although no mixing\n\nis allowed, there must be an\n\nexception to the rule. How\n\ndo I go about obtaining a\n\ndual-flavored cone when I\n\nvisit next?\n\nTerry Miner â63 Edu\n\nLas Vegas\n\nThat illustration featuring\n\nBill Clinton [âCelebrity\n\nSightings,â p. 33] was referencing the only occasion\n\nthat mixing flavors was\n\nallowed: The former president was served scoops of\n\nboth Peachy Paterno and\n\nCherry Quist in 1996.\n\nTAKING NOTES\n\nI am delighted Brockway\n\nBorough honored George\n\nMiller as âCitizen Man of\n\nthe Yearâ [Class Notes, p.\n\n57, July/Aug.]. I was coeditor of the 1959 Brockway\n\nHigh School yearbook,\n\nwhich was dedicated to Mr.\n\nMiller. I donât know how\n\nmany of us knew then that\n\nhe was only six years out of\n\ncollege. Perhaps, however,\n\nit was his youth as well as\n\nhis teaching skills and concern for his students that\n\nled our class to honor him.\n\nA shout-out over the miles\n\nand decades, Mr. Miller!\n\nSara Peterson Anderson\n\nâ63 Edu\n\nArlington, Va.\n\nWe just received our first\n\nedition of The Penn Stater\n\nsince our daughter, Shannon Trozzo, graduated in\n\nMay. We are proud to have\n\na Penn State graduate in\n\nour family and proud to be\n\npart of the alumni association. The article âNo More\n\nWasted Timeâ was especially interesting and heartwarming. I was also\n\nimpressed with the number\n\nof individuals noted in the\n\nâIn Memoriamâ section of\n\nthe magazine. However, it\n\nwould be so easy to spot\n\nnames if they were\n\narranged alphabetically\n\ninstead of chronologically.\n\nWe look forward to future\n\neditions of the magazine.\n\nBill Trozzo\n\nBethel Park, Pa.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\nIt was uplifting to hear of Tim Shawâs spirit and how he is dealing\n\nwith ALS in âNo More Wasted Timeâ [Sept./Oct., p. 40]. He truly is\n\nan inspiration. I flashed back to the Blue-White Game in 2002: At that\n\ntime, the incoming class of football players would attend and wear\n\nname tags. When it was over, my friends and Iâand many of the other\n\nthousands of fansâpoured onto the field. I encountered several recruits\n\nthat day, but Tim stuck with me. Perhaps the kindness of his heart\n\nand the strength of his spirit cast an indelible impression.\n\nGene Cyprych â74 Sci, Woodstock, Md.\n\nSeptember/October 2015 THE PENN STATER 4 1\n\nDiagnosed last year with ALS, Tim Shaw is focused on making\n\nthe most of his remaining time and health, and of challenging the\n\nrest of us to do the same.\n\nBY DAVE BIRKETT\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY\n\nMARK ZALESKI\n\nNO MORE\n\nWASTED TIME FACING UP TO ALS\n\nIn the face of a terminal diagnosis, Shaw\n\nhas maintained the determination that\n\nmade him a standout linebacker at Penn\n\nState. âI donât want someone to feel\n\nbad for me.

No\n\ndoubt it was perceived as\n\nsuch by at least a few of his\n\n700+ criminology undergraduates, making them\n\nfeel vulnerable. No matter\n\nhow well-intentioned, and\n\ndespite his subsequent\n\nmeeting with the State\n\nTroopers Association, there\n\ncan be no justification for\n\nbolstering the confidence\n\nof one group of students at\n\nthe expense of another.\n\nCharles H. Lutz â67 Lib\n\nSalem, S.C.\n\nMAKING A SPLASH\n\nDespite never being good\n\nenough to compete on a\n\nvarsity team, I loved diving. So I got really excited\n\nwhen I found that the new\n\noutdoor pool would have\n\ndiving platforms and\n\nvowed to be the first person to dive off the 10-meter\n\nplatform [July./Aug., p.\n\n51]. I got to the pool an\n\nhour early on opening day\n\nand was first in line. (Actually, I was the only one in\n\nline because the temperature was about 55 degrees.)\n\nWhen a lifeguard arrived\n\nto open the pool, I asked\n\nhim if anyone had yet been\n\noff the 10-meter plat8 THE PENN STATER November/December 2015\n\nI had a friend request\n\nthrough Facebook from\n\nsomeone this morning. I\n\nlooked at the personâs\n\nfriends and there was a surname among them that was\n\nfamiliar. I looked at the\n\npersonâs profile picture\n\nagain. OMG! It was my\n\nroommate from Haller Hall\n\nfrom 1970âshe had seen\n\nthe Class Notes item about\n\nmy husband, Jerry Gorelick\n\n[Sept./Oct., p. 62], and\n\nfound me on Facebook. I\n\nhavenât been in touch with\n\nLil since 1972. I never\n\nwould have found her, as I\n\ndidnât know her married\n\nname. We now have about\n\n40 years to catch up on.\n\nThank you!\n\nJoady Knoebel Gorelick\n\nâ72 H&HD\n\nLos Angeles\n\nCRITICISMS\n\nI do not understand why\n\nThe Penn Stater would\n\npraise the work of [First\n\nAmendment lawyer] Herald Price Fahringer defending pornography and pornographers [In Memoriam,\n\nSept./Oct., p. 71]. Pornography depicts actual sexual\n\nand physical abuse of\n\nwomen and dehumanizes\n\nwomen. Why would Penn\n\nState praise that?\n\nKathy Irey â78 Lib\n\nWhite Oak, Pa.\n\nI just noticed the brief obit\n\nnotice for Arthur Pollard in\n\nthe Sept./Oct. issue [In\n\nMemoriam, p. 75]. Assuming this is the Art Pollard\n\nwho was one of the nationâs\n\ntop sprinters for Penn State\n\nin the mid-â50s, I think he\n\ndeserves more of a memorial-type obituary than just\n\nthe few basic lines. Pollard\n\nwasnât just another college\n\nathleteâhe was one of the\n\nelite track and field men of\n\nhis era, in the same category with Penn State\n\nnames like Rod Perry, the\n\nAshenfelters, Rosey Grier,\n\nCharles Blockson, et al.\n\nHarris Factor â58 Lib\n\nColumbia, Md.\n\nIn my response to the\n\ninterview of President Barron [âTrending Up,â July/\n\nAug., p. 38], my key points\n\nwere lost in the editing\n\n[âYour Letters,â Sept./Oct.,\n\np. 10]. The Penn Stater has\n\nallowed me to restate them\n\nhere.\n\nIn his interview, Dr. Barron was asked about the\n\nfallout from the Sandusky\n\nscandalâspecifically concerning Joe Paternoâs legacy. He ducked the question, instead speaking to\n\nprogress at Penn State\n\nsince the scandal. He didnât\n\neven mention Joeâs name.\n\nJoeâs legacy is intertwined\n\nwith that of Penn Stateâs,\n\nand when the Board of\n\nTrustees forced Joe to step\n\ndown, the scandal became\n\ninseparable from both.\n\nExcoriated by the Freeh\n\nReport, Joe was then exonerated by Thornburgh and\n\nthe NCAA. But Barron has\n\nleft him twisting in the\n\nwind. Ignoring Joe continues to taint the university\n\nin the eyes of many, and\n\nbrings closure to no one.\n\nDr. Barron was also\n\nasked about his participation in a âhands up, donât\n\nshootâ demonstration last\n\nDecember. He spoke of his\n\nobligation to listen to vulnerable students. This gesformâhe said no. I\n\nstripped down to my bathing suit and sprinted up\n\nthe steps.

But we set a good plan and\n\nare really confident. The students have really stepped up.â\n\nOFF THE FIELD One of Draneâs biggest goals is to grow the Blue Band familyâ\n\nboth in qualitative and quantitative measures. Over the last decade, heâs\n\ndeveloped special pep bands for sports like basketball and hockey, which have\n\nadded approximately 125 musicians to the organization, and heâs increased\n\nstudent leadership roles within the program. âWeâre utilizing student strengths\n\nbeyond playing their instrument,â he says.\n\nPRESTO TEMPO âEnergeticâ has been used to describe the Miami, Fla., native.\n\nâI know I have a motor,â says the trained saxophonist. âWhen I was a musician,\n\nI had no problem sitting and practicing for a few hours. Thatâs what keeps\n\nme going.â\n\nONE LOVE An artist with whom Drane finds inspiration is Bob Marley: âI think\n\nhe recognized the ability of music to just bring joy.â\n\nTHE RIGHT MIX How exactly do you manage the largest student group on\n\ncampus? For Drane, itâs by celebrating the differences among its 450 student\n\nvolunteers. âI think of diversity in a broader senseâhow do students learn, what\n\nare their backgrounds, and what do they bring to the table,â he says. âMy job is\n\nto pull all of these individuals together and create something.â âAD\n\nGregory Drane\n\nThe new director of the Blue Band is already in full swing.\n\nND_EDP_Final.indd 11 9/24/15 12:19 PM\n\nP:14\n\nPenn State Alumni\n\nWhen Iâm not in Happy Valley following my passion - cheering\n\non our Nittany Lions or performing philanthropic work to help\n\nensure Penn State students receive a first-rate education, with\n\nfinancial support when needed, then Iâm in Naples, Florida\n\nfollowing my main passion â selling real estate in Naples and\n\nin other areas of Florida.\n\nMy passion for Penn State and Naples has no limits.

First displayed at the 1893 Worldâs Fair in\n\nChicago, for which it was presumably built, the map came\n\nto University Park in 1897; once on campus, it was displayed\n\nfi rst in Old Main, then in the old Mining Building, and fi -\n\nnally in Steidle Building, home to the College of Earth and\n\nMineral Sciences. And then it was largely forgotten.\n\nJust last year, when renovations began on Steidle, the map\n\nwas rediscovered leaning against an offi ce wall and deemed\n\nworth savingââan extremely signifi cant artifact of the history of science at Penn State,â as EMS Museum director Russ\n\nGraham put it. The map was sent off to Materials Conservation Co., a Philadelphia-based conservation fi rm, and after\n\na months-long renovation process that included extensive\n\nrepair of the paint and plaster, the map was returned to the\n\nuniversity, looking good as new. In August, it was offi cially\n\nunveiled at its new home, the EMS Museum and Art Gallery\n\non the ground fl oor of Deike Building. Says Julianne Snider,\n\nthe museumâs assistant director, âItâs a phenomenal work of\n\nart.

Whatâs\n\nundeniable is that, as a 19-year-old\n\njunior in 1972, Tate â73 Eng was the\n\nonly woman licensed to work at Penn\n\nStateâs Breazeale Reactor. With the\n\non-campus reactor celebrating its\n\n60th birthday this year, it seemed\n\na good time\n\nto jog Tateâs\n\nmemory.\n\nGrowing\n\nup in Lavelle,\n\nPa., a tiny\n\nmining town\n\nin Schuylkill\n\nCounty, young\n\nJacquelyn\n\nScheuren saw\n\nthe toll that\n\ncoal took on\n\nthe people who\n\nmined it, and on the surrounding environment. A pilot program in nuclear\n\nscience, offered at her high school,\n\nopened her eyes to what seemed a better option. âNuclear power just seemed\n\nso much more reasonable,â she says.\n\nShe came to Penn State planning to\n\nwork her way through school and fi nish in three years. âIf I could get a job,â\n\nshe says, âI could pay my own tuition.â\n\nAn adviser directed her to Breazeale,\n\nwhere she got a\n\ngig as a health\n\nphysics techâa\n\nâminimum-wage\n\ntype of thingâ\n\nthat required\n\nher to swab surfaces and test them for\n\nradiation. It wasnât glamorous, but it\n\npaid, and it left her time to study for\n\nher licensing exam. She passed, eventually moving into a better-paying job\n\nat the reactor, and says she couldnât\n\nhave quietly blazed that trail without\n\nthe support of her co-workers. âIt was\n\na bit of a novelty at fi rst, but they were\n\nwonderful to me,â Tate says. âI was just\n\na know-nothing kid, and they would\n\nvery patiently answer my questions,\n\nhelp me with the licensing process.â\n\nAfter marrying Tom Tate â71, â73\n\nMS Eng and graduating, she began\n\na career in nuclear safety, and was on\n\nsite at Three Mile Island after the 1979\n\nreactor meltdown. The Tates eventually sent two sons, Bill â07 Agr and Sam\n\nâ11 A&A, to Penn State as well. Now\n\nretired and living in Berks County, Tate\n\nlooks back on her college days fondly.\n\nâIt was a very intense time,â she says,\n\nâbut it made a lot of the rest of my life\n\npossible.â\n\nRadiant Memories\n\nAs the Breazeale Reactor turns 60, we catch up with Jackie Scheuren Tate,\n\nwho broke the nuclear ceiling.

A roundup of\n\nrecent rankings shows that\n\nno matter the subject, the\n\nuniversity tends to stack\n\nup well. âRJ\n\nPenn Stateâs rank, out\n\n35\n\nof 153 universities, on\n\nthe Sierra Clubâs âCool\n\nSchoolsâ list of most\n\nsustainable campuses.\n\nThe Association of\n\n8\n\nResearch Libraries declared\n\nPenn State the eighth-best\n\nuniversity research library\n\nsystem in the nation.\n\nThe university earned a\n\n25\n\nplace among the nationâs\n\ntop 25 LGBTQ-friendly\n\ncolleges, according to the\n\nnonprofit Campus Pride.\n\n1\n\nA homeinsurance.com list,\n\ncompiled from FBI crime\n\ndata, ranks Penn State\n\nHarrisburg as the safest\n\ncampus in the country.\n\nTHE CANOPY APPEARS each September,\n\nset up on a grassy patch of the Pattee\n\nMall in the shadow of the libraryâs main\n\nentrance. Depending on when you happen byâsay, on an early-fall afternoon,\n\nwhen Sue Pohland Paterno â62 Lib\n\ntakes the podium to open Penn Stateâs\n\nannual Marathon Readingâthere might\n\nbe 50 people crammed under the canopy,\n\nand 100 more collected around its edges,\n\nall listening intently. Or it might be 3\n\na.m., and the single-digit crowd might be\n\nbundled up in sleeping bags, sipping coffee to the sound of someone reading in\n\nSpanish, German, or Mandarin.\n\nWhenever youâre there, thereâs one\n\nguarantee: Someone will be reading.\n\nStarted in 2012, the annual 24-hour\n\nreading has quickly evolved into a very\n\ncool Penn State tradition. For bibliophiles, the appeal is obvious: From the\n\nfi rst selection (the anti-war classic\n\nCatch-22, written by one-time Penn State\n\nfaculty member Joseph Heller) to this\n\nyearâs 10-book âmadnessâ-themed collection (featuring Kafkaâs The Metamorphosis and Camusâ The Stranger), the chance\n\nto read briefl y from a classic novel and be\n\npart of a communal celebration of great\n\nliterature is a treat. Students especially\n\nare drawn by the low-key party vibeâ\n\nfree T-shirts for readers, pizza for the\n\nlate-night crowd, coffee and donuts for\n\nthe hearty early-morning readersâand of\n\ncourse, the celebrities: Russ Rose and\n\nEric Barron were among this yearâs readers, while SuePa has served as honorary\n\nâfi rst readerâ each year. This year, she\n\nopened with memories of reading Kafka\n\nas a student â50-some years ago.â Hereâs\n\nto more of Sue, and more great stories,\n\nnext fall.\n\nReading Together\n\nThanks to SuePa, free pizza, and great books, the Marathon\n\nReading is a new campus tradition.

OK, make that\n\nliterally unbelievable: The story\n\nappeared in The Onion, the satirical news site. As far as we can tell,\n\nthere is no Penn State researcher\n\nnamed âGary Albright,â and this\n\nriff on the idea of the Pangaea\n\nsupercontinent is, of course, a joke.\n\nPhew. âRJ\n\nBuilding a\n\nDigital Wall\n\nITâS NOT SURPRISING that a major research university would be\n\nthe target of hackers. What is surprisingâshocking, reallyâis hearing that Penn State repels millions\n\nof âovertly hostile cyberattacksâ\n\ndaily. Motivated by that knowledge, and by high-profi le hacks\n\nof the College of Engineering and\n\nLiberal Arts networks earlier this\n\nyear, the university in September\n\nestablished the Offi ce of Information Security. In announcing the\n\nnew offi ce, Nicholas Jones, Penn\n\nStateâs executive vice president\n\nand provost, said, âThis is the reality of the world we live in today.\n\nWe believe the establishment of\n\nthis offi ce will better serve Penn\n\nStateâs security needs in the years\n\nahead.â Andrew Sears, dean of\n\nthe College of Information Sciences and Technology, will serve\n\nas the universityâs chief information security offi cer while a national search is conducted for a\n\npermanent CISO. âRJ\n\nâKEN LEHRMAN, vice provost for affirmative action, at Septemberâs\n\nPenn State Call to Action: Stopping Sexual Misconduct.\n\nHEARD on CAMPUS\n\nâFor the first time in many years,\n\nI see a new sense of urgency\n\nand dedication in taking on this\n\ncrisis.

His next stop was back home,\n\nwhere he launched a youth basketball\n\nacademy and AAU program.\n\nWest takes over a team that went\n\n5-20 last season, but he isnât promising instant success. âSuccess for us\n\nthis year, I think, is being respected,â\n\nhe says. âI think you have to take\n\nthose baby steps, and once the respect\n\ncomesâonce you learn how to play togetherâeverything else falls in place.â\n\nBEING THE COACH at Division III\n\nPenn State Altoona may seem like an\n\nunlikely fit for a retired NBA player,\n\nbut former Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nforward Doug West feels right at\n\nhome. Hired in July, Westâa star during his days at Altoona Area Highâis\n\nmore than happy to be coaching back\n\nin his hometown.\n\nâWhat better way to give back than\n\nto be able to be in a university with\n\nsuch a prestigious nameâthatâs Penn\n\nState,â says West, who was a standout\n\nat Villanova from 1985â89. âWhat a\n\ngreat way to give back to the kids who\n\ncome through here. â¦ Being involved\n\nin the community is something you\n\nwant to be part of, especially in your\n\nhometown.â\n\nAdler Athletic Complex becomes\n\nthe latest stop for West.

Itâs late August, and Richard â87 H&HD,\n\ninterim director of Penn Stateâs residential dining, is sitting\n\nwith me in Redifer Commons, in whatâs now known as the\n\nSouth Food District, as I finish my second serving of honeyglazed parsnips. Certainly, when I ate regularly in Penn State\n\ndining halls 20 (or so â¦) years ago, I would not have thought\n\nIâd ever see parsnips on the menu. Back then, Iâm not sure I\n\ncouldâve picked a parsnip out of a root vegetable lineup.\n\nBut now here I am, digging into heaping helpings of parsnips and steamed broccoli and farro\n\npilaf, all of it quite tasty. Itâs the first week\n\nof a month-long quest to eat my way across\n\nUniversity Park, where the optionsâboth in\n\nnumber and varietyâbear little resemblance\n\nto what most alumni will remember. Armed\n\nwith a notebook, a healthy appetite, and the\n\noccasional curious companion, Iâve committed to\n\nspending the next four weeks eating a meal at every\n\nconceivable spot on campus.\n\nDAY 1. A BEAUTIFUL MONDAY MORNING, first\n\nday of fall classes, and Iâm up early for a walk up\n\nto the Kern Building, home to Penn Stateâs graduate schoolâand, more recently, to one of four Au\n\nBon Pain locations on campus. Most alums probably remember this as Ottoâs CafÃ©, named for Otto\n\nMueller, the former longtime head of housing and\n\nfood services. The switch to Au Bon Pain came in\n\n2013, and itâs emblematic of a trend on campuses\n\nacross the country toward more national chains. I\n\nskip the calorie-bomb pastries and instead grab a\n\ngranola bar and an unsweetened iced teaânot an\n\nadventurous start, but pretty much what Iâd have\n\nfor breakfast any weekday morning.\n\nFor lunch, I make the first of a handful of trips\n\nto the HUB. Spots you might remember, like The Cellar,\n\nJoegies, or Coalyâs CafÃ©, have been replaced by the likes of\n\nBurger King, Jamba Juice, Sbarro, and Panda Express. Covering much of the ground floor in the newly renovated HUB,\n\nthe expansive dining area gives the impression of a really nice\n\nairport food court, with a variety of snack options and a huge\n\nsalad bar to boot. But Iâm not feeling like salad on this particular Monday, opting instead for chicken nuggets and fries\n\nfrom Chick-fil-A.\n\nThe folks in food services (who oversee everything\n\nsold in the residential commons) and the folks in\n\nretail campus dining (who oversee the HUB,\n\nâWhoâd have thought youâd\n\nsee honey-glazed parsnips on a college dining menu?â\n\nâW\n\ns\n\nWEST HALLS\n\nCOOKIES\n\nAlways fresh-fromthe-oven gooey, the\n\nWest cookies are a\n\ncampus favorite.\n\nND_Gluttony_Final.indd 26 10/15/15 1:34 PM\n\nP:29\n\nNovember/December 2015 THE PENN STATER 2 7\n\nthose Au Bon Pains, and pretty much everything else) have put together a rough schedule\n\nthat has me eating at retail spots one day, residential locations the next. That makes Tuesday my first day at\n\nthe dining halls, where Iâm quick to learn that both the term\n\nâdining hallâ and my own campus dining memories are largely outdated. It also means a long-awaited return to Findlay\n\nCommons in East Halls, where I consumed some ungodly\n\nnumber of calories in my first year on campus.\n\nBreakfast is at Roxyâs, a sort of stripped-down, comfortfood-focused version of the dining hall I remember, and\n\nit is wonderful: I inhale a breakfast burrito and a bundle\n\nof French toast sticks, washing it all down with a glass of\n\nCreamery chocolate milk. (This rekindles a long-held dream:\n\nIf I ever hit the lottery, Iâm getting one of those big stainlesssteel milk dispensers installed in my house. Chocolate only.)\n\nIâm joined by Jim Hopey â82 H&HD, associate director of\n\nresidential dining, who endures my reminiscing about how\n\nlittle Findlay has changed physically since my undergraduate\n\ndaysâand in truth, since the commons were built in 1965.\n\nItâs a perfect segue to a behind-the-scenes tour of the kitchen and food prep areas, where Hopey shows me a\n\nwall covered with color-coded mapsâplans for the\n\nFindlay Commons renovation, a complete overhaul\n\nthat is set to begin in February.\n\nFor lunch, itâs on to Southside Buffet at Redifer\n\nCommons, where the future of campus dining is\n\nhere and now. Redifer was renovated in 2004, and\n\nSouthside is what I wouldâve called its dining hall.\n\nThe food services folks now refer to it as an âall-youcare-to-eatâ venue; youâll never hear them utter the\n\nword âcafeteria,â and even âall you can eat,â with its\n\nimplication of gluttony, is discouraged. Of course,\n\nin the traditional dining-hall setting, I can gorge\n\nmyself if I choose, which is both a bad idea andâ\n\nyou remember theyâve got Creamery ice cream in\n\nhere, right?âreally, really tempting. But it occurs\n\nto me that unless I plan on buying bigger pants, my\n\ncurrent pace of caloric consumptionâChick-fil-A\n\nyesterday, French toast sticks this morningâis\n\nunsustainable. So it is that I end up with a plate\n\nfull of broccoli, farro, and parsnips.\n\nAnd hereâs the thing: Itâs all really good. So\n\ngood that I get seconds, of everything. I say as\n\nmuch to Richard, the interim food services director, whose smile registers satisfaction, but not\n\nsurprise. Richard and his colleagues are proud of\n\ntheir work, proud of the food and the people who cook and\n\nserve it, and they want more people to know about it. And\n\nnot just students: Every dining hall and retail establishment\n\non campus is open to the public, and theyâre eager to get the\n\nword outâespecially to alumni, those of us for whom nostalgia and curiosity might provide a powerful pull. They want\n\nus to come back, give them a try, be surprised. Be impressed.\n\nAt Redifer, itâs easy to see why. In addition to the more\n\ntraditional setup at Southside Buffet, Rediferâs South Food\n\nDistrict offers no fewer than eight other walk-up optionsâ\n\nburgers, pizza, Mexican, Asian, soups and saladsâfor a la\n\ncarte buyers. Itâs a similar vibe to the HUB food court, only\n\nsmaller and without the restaurant chains. Hopey refers to\n\nthe âliving roomâ appeal of the commons, where itâs not unusual to see bleary-eyed students stumble in for breakfast\n\nin their pajamas. Combine that level of convenience with a\n\nlineup of options that mirrors the likes of the Chipotle or Five\n\nGuys across College Avenue, and you (continued on p. 30)\n\nonly\n\nrefers to\n\ntâs not unr breakfast\n\nence with a\n\notle or Five\n\non p. 30)\n\nSUSHI ROLLS\n\nRegulars at Pollock\n\nCommons line up\n\nfor Masa Matsuiâs\n\nexpertly prepared\n\nsushi.\n\nFeast A Moveable\n\nND_Gluttony_Final.indd 27 10/15/15 1:34 PM\n\nP:30\n\n28 THE PENN STATER November/December 2015\n\nA Lot\n\nDigest\n\nALot\n\nDigest\n\nYour guide toCAMPUS DINING\n\nND_Gluttony_Final.indd 28 10/14/15 12:48 PM\n\nP:31\n\nNovember/December 2015 THE PENN STATER 2 9\n\nResidential\n\nDining\n\nFINDLAY\n\n> Findlay Dining\n\nCommons\n\n> Roxyâs\n\n> Sol de Cobre\n\n> Fresh Express\n\n> Asian Grill\n\n> Good-2-Go\n\n> The Big Onion\n\nSIGNATURE DISH\n\nBreakfast sandwiches at\n\nThe Big Onion; French\n\ntoast sticks at Roxyâs.\n\nPOLLOCK\n\n> Pollock Dining\n\nCommons\n\n> The Mix\n\nSIGNATURE DISH\n\nHand-rolled sushi at\n\nPollock Dining Commons.\n\nWEST FOOD\n\nDISTRICT\n\n> Waring Square\n\n> The West Wing\n\n> Sisu Coffee Bar & Store\n\nSIGNATURE DISH\n\nWest Halls cookies.\n\nSOUTH FOOD\n\nDISTRICT\n\n> South Side Buffet\n\n> Hot Steel & Noodles\n\n> Off the Ground\n\n> In A Pickle\n\n> Piatto Felice\n\n> Redifer City Grill\n\n> Urban Garden\n\n> Louieâs\n\n> Fresco y Caliente\n\n> Edomae\n\nSIGNATURE DISH\n\nSalmon burgers at\n\nRedifer City Grill.\n\nNORTH FOOD\n\nDISTRICT\n\n> North Side\n\n> Bluespoon Market\n\n> rigaTonyâs\n\n> Halal\n\nSIGNATURE DISH\n\nHand-carved gyros at Halal.\n\nHUB Dining\n\n> Blue Burrito\n\n> Burger King\n\n> Chick-fil-A\n\n> Diversions\n\n> Jamba Juice\n\n> Starbucks\n\n> Higher Grounds\n\n> McAlisterâs Deli\n\n> Mixed Greens\n\n> Panda Express\n\n> Sbarro\n\n> Soup & Garden\n\n> Sushi by Panda Express\n\nCampus\n\nCatering\n\n& retail\n\nlocations\n\n> Gateway CafÃ©\n\nShortlidge Mall\n\n> KC CafÃ©\n\nBank of America Career\n\nServices Building\n\n> MacKinnonâs CafÃ©\n\nWest Pattee Library\n\n> Blue Chip Bistro\n\nBusiness Building\n\n> Au Bon Bain\n\nLocations in Katz Law\n\nBuilding, Kern Building,\n\nIST Building & Zoller\n\nGallery\n\nCAFÃ LAURA\n\nBreakfast and lunch, as\n\nwell as theme dinners, at\n\nstudent-run restaurant\n\noperated by the School of\n\nHospitality Management.\n\nFOR MENUS, operating hours, and special\n\ndining events, go to\n\nfoodservices.psu.edu.\n\nND_Gluttony_Final.indd 29 10/14/15 12:49 PM\n\nP:32\n\n30 THE PENN STATER November/December 2015\n\nwouldnât blame the students living on campus if they never felt\n\ncompelled to leave.\n\nAs for quality? More than ever,\n\nhow the food tastes matters, too.\n\nâStudents today are so much\n\nmore educated about food,â says\n\nBill Laychur, the universityâs corporate executive chef. Though\n\nhis title doesnât quite make it\n\nclearâhe says he prefers âChef\n\nBill,â anywayâLaychur oversees\n\nthe preparation, recipe development, safety, and training for the\n\nfood services operations at the 11\n\nPenn State locations throughout\n\nthe commonwealth that offer oncampus diningâmeaning heâs\n\nultimately the guy in charge of\n\nserving 65,000 meals a day. He\n\ncame to Penn State food services\n\n18 years ago after a stint at the\n\nNittany Lion Inn, and heâs substantially expanded the operation, adding an executive chef in\n\nMark Kowalski, a registered dietitianâMelissa Filchner Hendricks â07 H&HD, who originated the position in 2013âand\n\nmanaging chefs at the individual commons. In every way,\n\nthe expansion is motivated by quality control, which Laychur\n\nmakes clear isnât a mere luxury; the shift in student awareness, and therefore expectations, makes it mandatory.\n\nâWhen I started, we could have something a little bit more\n\nupscale once or twice a week, and it would keep everyone\n\nhappy,â he says. âNow our menus are much more diverse. Itâs\n\nno longer just Chinese foodâwe do Korean, we do Vietnamese. American is no longer just burgers and friesâwe might\n\ndo Cajun food, low-country Southern. Fish is extremely\n\npopular. We constantly see whatâs out there thatâs within the\n\nrealm of affordability and get those items on the menu.â\n\nEvidence of studentsâ sophisticated palates is on display\n\nall over campus. Each semester at South, chef Stephane Gawlowiczâwho is not only French-trained but actually French\n\n(see sidebar, left)âoversees\n\na âsustainable dinnerâ made\n\nentirely with locally sourced\n\ningredients. That one comes\n\ntoo late for my deadline, but\n\nI do make it to North Food\n\nDistrict in Warnock Commons for the authentic, halalcertified gyro, and to Pollock\n\nCommons for the sushi.\n\nAnd about the sushi: I\n\ndonât eat sushi. Not normally,\n\nanyway. But Pollock is home\n\nto Masa Matsui, a master\n\nsushi chef from Japan, who\n\nprepares fresh sushi rolls\n\nwhile diners watch. I canât\n\nnot try them, and so I do:\n\nCalifornia rolls with tuna\n\nand avocado and thin slices\n\nof tempura shrimp. Not that\n\nmy opinion should carry\n\nmuch weight on this one, but\n\nI quite enjoy them.\n\nThe rest of my residential\n\ndining visits are less adventurous, but no less enlightening. At The Mix in Pollock and The West Wing in\n\nWaring, I grab made-to-order cheesesteaks, custom-building\n\na sandwich from options on a touch-screen kiosk. Itâs the\n\non-campus version of the Sheetz and Wawa counters with\n\nwhich so many students are familiar, and itâs a hugely popular choice. (Along those lines, each residential commons also\n\nhas a fully stocked convenience store.) I make the trek back\n\nto Findlay Commons on another day for a toasted turkey and\n\nSwiss sandwich at Fresh Express, and later again for a couple\n\nof slices of pizza at The Big Onion. For breakfast one day, I\n\ngo healthy (oatmeal with almond slivers and dried cranberries) at Southâand less so a few days later at Pollock, where\n\nmy egg, sausage, and cheese on a biscuit is a near-flawless\n\nreproduction of the one youâll find under the golden arches.\n\nMy plan all along is to stick to breakfast and lunch on\n\nweekdays, but a classic lazy-Sunday brunch seems to be the\n\nStephane Gawlowicz\n\nand Masa Matsui\n\ntook different paths\n\nto Penn State, but\n\ntheyâve got at least\n\none thing in common:\n\na shared joy in challenging the palates of\n\ntheir customers.\n\nBorn in Paris,\n\nGawlowicz owned a\n\nrestaurant in Nantes,\n\nin western France,\n\nbefore coming to the\n\nU.S., where he worked\n\non tall ships that sailed\n\nEast Coast harbors, and\n\na hotel in Baltimore.\n\nHe came to State College in 2013, drawn by\n\nthe challenge of cooking for âhigh-volumeâ\n\ncrowds. âIt could have\n\nbeen a cruise ship, but\n\nit ended up being a\n\ncollege,â says Gawlowicz, the managing chef\n\nat South Food Distrct.\n\nFrom farm-raised\n\nsalmon burgers to the\n\nlocally sourced dinners\n\nhe hosts each semester, Gawlowicz enjoys\n\ntesting studentsâ\n\nwillingness to branch\n\nout.

Theyâre 10 and 7, and theyâre\n\na little self-conscious thanks to the curious looks of all those\n\nfreshmen and sophomores, but they get over it when they\n\ntaste the French toast sticks and spot the wall-mounted dispensers full of Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops. My daughter,\n\nthe younger one, recoils when a bowl of the latter makes her\n\nmilk turn an artificial pink, but otherwise we have a blast.\n\nThe fish-out-of-water aspect is part of the joy of this whole\n\nthing; being a 40-something in a room full of âkidsâ roughly\n\nhalf my age is awkward but undeniably fun, like Iâm getting\n\naway with something. A few days later, I get to share that\n\nfeeling with the rest of the magazine staff when we head to\n\nWaring Square for an extended lunch meeting. Actual lunch\n\nchoices vary among the group, but for dessert, we all agree on\n\na plate full of famous, fresh-out-of-the-oven West Hall cookies. Or was it two plates? It might have been three.\n\nI have a feeling that the âfreshman 15â is going to\n\nbe harder to lose this time around.\n\nFROM THE NOSTALGIC APPEAL TO THE unexpected variety of good food, my dining commons visits are everything\n\nIâd hoped theyâd be. Iâve got no such nostalgia for the retail\n\noptions, so many of which didnât exist when I was an undergrad. But for a quick andâif you chooseâhealthy breakfast or\n\nlunch, the options are plentiful: those Au Bon Pain locations,\n\ntwo coffee shops (including an insanely busy Starbucks) in\n\nthe HUB, and an array of other cafÃ©-style spots ranging from\n\nMacKinnonâs in Pattee Library (a personal favorite given its\n\nproximity to the Hintz Family Alumni Center) to the popular\n\nBlue Chip Bistro in the Business Building.\n\nIâd need another week or so to hit every spot on campus,\n\nand so the final few days of this cross-campus culinary quest\n\nrequire some tough decisionsâdespite multiple trips back\n\nto the HUB, I never do make it to Jamba Juice or Burger\n\nKing, nor to Findlayâs Asian Grill. Among my priorities as\n\nI wrap things up is CafÃ© Laura, the student-run restaurant near the Nittany Lion Inn. Staffed by hospitality management majors and best known for\n\nits popular theme dinners, itâs open daily for\n\nlunch, and thatâs where I head on my secondto-last day. The CafÃ© was renovated in 2014,\n\nand from the spacious kitchen and prep spaces\n\nto the curved, window-lined dining room, itâs\n\nimmediately one of my favorite places on campus.\n\nMy lunchâpecan chicken with green beans and\n\nasparagus, and a decadent chocolate pudding for\n\ndessertâis delicious.\n\nFor my last meal, I head back to South for a\n\nlunch date with my wife, a fellow mid-â90s alum\n\nwhoâs also a pretty serious foodie. Among the musthave dishes Iâd been told about before I started\n\nwere the handmade salmon burgers at Redifer\n\nCity Grill; Iâm eager to try one, and also to see if itâs\n\nup to my wifeâs discerning taste. Weâre joined for\n\nlunch by Chef Stephane, who talks about adapting his French culinary training to the appetites of\n\nAmerican college students, and about the bounty of\n\ncentral Pennsylvania produce. Itâs great conversation, one neither my wife nor I can imagine having\n\nwhen we were students. And the salmon burger?\n\nYes, even she is impressed.\n\nIâm impressed, tooâby the burger, yes, but mostly that I can, just barely, still fit into my pants.\n\nFeast A Moveable\n\nSALMON\n\nBURGER\n\nFreshly made and\n\navailable every Friday\n\nat Redifer City Grill in\n\nSouth Food District.\n\nND_Gluttony_Final.indd 31 10/15/15 1:35 PM\n\nP:34\n\nFIFTEEN PENN STATERS ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER\n\nUSS THEODORE ROOSEVELT JUST WRAPPED UP\n\nDEPLOYMENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF AS PART OF\n\nOPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE.

We go through\n\nmore cowbells than\n\nthe Blue Band.â\n\nBetter pack a few\n\nextra drumsticks,\n\ntoo: The current Lion\n\nsays they broke on\n\nhim during the rainy\n\nhome opener against\n\nBuffalo.\n\nThe cowbell thatâs\n\nbeat-up and rusty\n\n(pictured) is one of\n\nthe originals. Typically,\n\nitâs reserved for special\n\ncameos at tailgates or\n\nacademic events.\n\nâBecause you canât\n\ntalk, you need to get\n\nthem excited in another way, and usually\n\nwith a prop like this,â\n\nsays Sheep.\n\nThe mascot even\n\nhas a pint-sized cowbell that fits perfectly\n\ninto a carry-on for\n\nthose out-of-town\n\npep rallies.\n\nPAWS\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nEach Lion receives two\n\npairs of paws every\n\nyearââThe gloves\n\nreally get beat up,â\n\nsays Valaniaâand the\n\ngloves today are much\n\ndifferent from the real\n\nrabbit fur used in the\n\nâ50s. In fact, the Lion\n\nis issued synthetic\n\nreceiver glovesâthe\n\nsame ones used by the\n\nfootball team.\n\nâI almost exclusively\n\npreferred the [previous] leather version,â\n\nsays Nellis. âYou get\n\nvery sweaty in the\n\nsuit, and the synthetic\n\nmaterial and smooth\n\nplastic on the newer\n\nreceiver gloves is very\n\nslippery. I almost fell\n\nout doing the onearmed push-ups.â\n\nThe Lion is allowed\n\nto keep his first suitâ\n\nitâs tailored to his\n\nmeasurements, after\n\nallâand, although it\n\nmust always be worn\n\nin its entirety, there is\n\none special circumstance: He may receive\n\nhis Penn State diploma\n\nwearing just the paws.\n\nSANTA HAT\n\nValania wore the\n\nSanta hat right before\n\nfinals week, passing\n\nout candy canes to\n\nstudents studying in\n\nthe HUB.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nGEAR\n\nThe 2012â13 season\n\nat Greenberg Ice\n\nPavilion was a first for\n\nthe varsity hockey\n\nprogramâand also\n\nfor Nellis: âI didnât\n\nknow how to ice skate\n\neven as a normal\n\nperson, let alone in a\n\nlion suit and football\n\nhelmet,â he says.\n\nâI didnât make a\n\ncomplete fool out of\n\nmyself, but I wasnât the\n\nmost graceful either.â\n\nThe following year\n\nat Pegula Ice Arena,\n\nValania wore a jersey\n\nfor the first two\n\ngames, and later added\n\nhockey pants and\n\ngloves to look more\n\nthe part. The program\n\nalso fits the lion for\n\nskates and provides\n\nskating lessons, but\n\nthe current Lion wonât\n\nneed the latter: âIâm\n\nnot going to be doing\n\n360-degree turns, but I\n\ndo know how to\n\nskate,â he says.\n\nFORMER\n\nFUR\n\nSince a new suit is\n\nmade every yearâ\n\nâYou always have to be\n\nlooking fresh to\n\nrepresent the\n\nuniversity,â says\n\nNellisâplenty of old\n\nsuits have accumulated\n\nover the years.\n\nâEverything stays in\n\nthe family,â says\n\nValania, adding that\n\nonly the Nittany Lion\n\nis ever allowed to wear\n\nthe suit, with one\n\nexception: The suits\n\ncan be used for the\n\nLion mascot tryouts.\n\nLION\n\nPROPS\n\nSUNGLASSES\n\nThe sunglasses have to be\n\noversized to fit the head\n\nof a mascotâSheep made\n\nthis pair for a Blues Brothers skit with some cardboard and electrical tape.\n\nND_Lion_Final.indd 42 10/14/15 11:41 AM\n\nP:45\n\nNovember/December 2015 THE PENN STATER 4 3\n\nTUXEDO\n\nJACKET\n\nNellis wore this powderblue tuxedo jacketâ\n\na bargain from the\n\nlocal Goodwillâfor\n\na âGangnam Styleâ\n\nskit during the Temple\n\ngame in 2012.\n\nND_Lion_Final.indd 43 10/15/15 1:38 PM\n\nP:46\n\n44 T H E P E N N\n\nSTATER November/\n\nNUTCRACKER\n\nA four-foot buckeye\n\nnutcracker, created\n\nby Sheep, is always\n\nat the ready for the\n\nOhio State matchups.\n\nItâs made out of two\n\nrakes, cardboard, silver\n\nspray paint, and âa\n\nlot of duct tape.â The\n\nNCAA has restrictions\n\non how mascots can\n\nphysically interact with\n\neach other.

Weâd tried\n\ndoing it a few years ago, but the\n\nturnout was low. Now that weâre\n\ngrowing as a chapter, more people are\n\nshowing up.\n\nHow did you guys come up with the\n\nteam name?\n\nWe were just talking about Penn State\n\nmemories, and I donât remember\n\nwho mentioned it, but someone said,\n\nâWhat about the Willard preacher?â\n\nEveryone was like, âOh yeah, the\n\nWillard preacher!â Of course, in\n\nMadison, no one knows the reference\n\nexcept us.\n\nHow is the team doing?\n\nWeâve got five first-place wins. Most\n\nplaces give gift cards to the winners,\n\nso we have all these gift cards now.\n\nWeâre planning to auction them off\n\nfor our fundraiserâwe do a joint\n\nscholarship fund with the Milwaukee\n\nchapter.\n\nIs there a particular topic you guys like?\n\nOur best category tends to be\n\nscienceâthere are a lot of scientists in\n\nour group. Many of the Penn Staters\n\nin Madison are in grad school, like I\n\nwas, so we get a lot of young alumni.\n\nAs everyone knows, the Willard\n\npreacherâs signature look is a red\n\nhooded sweatshirt. As Nittany Lions\n\nin Badger country, do you dare wear\n\nred at the bar?\n\nNo!
