        "text": "Screw-In\n\nDo I need another Prop?\n\nI'm running a Tenn. Wood prop 52x28. My engine is an 1835cc VW @ 65hp peak @ 60hp continious.\n\nI'm flying around at what I think is 80-90% throttle. Iether way, my Tach is burried at 3500 RPM during all phases of flight. I don't know what my takeoff RPM is or my minimum RPM is for flight because of this.\n\nThe Engine Manufacturer (Great Plains) says it's ok to max out @ 3500 or more for takeoff, but I should be cruising at about 3100-3200. They also said I'm wotrking the engine too hard if I'm constant 3500 RPM or more.\n\nDo I need a 52x30? My engine isn't overheating anymore.\n\nScrew-Out\n\nScrew-In\n\nThanks Chuck, but I'm not sure a 50x30 will perform any differantly than my 52x28.\n\nBrent- The tiny Tach isn't working, so I can't tell what RPMs I'm running. Right now all of my temps are in order. I just don't know if I'm running the engine too hard or not. I know if I go to a 52x30, that'll run my engine harder and probably hotter, but I'll have a reduced RPM.\n\nScrew-Out"
