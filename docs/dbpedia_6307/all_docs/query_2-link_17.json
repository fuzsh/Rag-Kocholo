The military commanders of the region controlled all the airspace in their area and would open and close airspace at their will. Once in BJ the controllers off-set us and launched a turbo-prop at us then gave us a turn on the LOC when he started a turn off the loc .at that point I was wondering what would happen if one was to go- around. Made Kennedy seem orderly,lol.\n\nNo problem flying in China.General aviation develop very fast in China in recent years.\n\nI am busy on my business in past one year，so I havn't update the post.sorry for that.Recently, I gradually started my construction project.In those days,I find the trade war between America&China would slow down my PA18 project，it's said there would be harder to import aircraft parts from America.So，I have to make turnbuckles by myself.I purchased 304 stainless steel turn buckles in China and modified them for my elevator cable assembles.But I'm not sure if the intensity is enough.Please give me your advice.\n\nTurnbuckle barrels are made of 304 stainless steel,havn't slot inside.Cable eye is eye bearing purchased,that's froged steel.fork ends machined from a round bar that is 4130 alloy steel.Welding screw and turnbuckle after adjustment，if need readjust cable tension I would change a new one.304 turnbuckles for 2 USD,bearing for 1USD,total in 4USD,it's cheap.\n\nView attachment 38868\n\n​\n\nWell, that is certainly one way to do it! You could ditch/lose the nut if you are welding the ends. Epoxy, that you could heat up to soften/release, would be another way to lock ends, without having to replace every time you need to adjust.\n\nWell, that is certainly one way to do it!

I admire your skills. It saddens me to think such good work must be thrown away if an adjustment becomes necessary. Of course the internal groove in the barrel is for safety springs which would need a matching groove in your rod ends to work. Also with some imagination safety wire would work. Perhaps a 1.5 mm hole drilled through the meaty area of the rod end and safety wire would make your beautiful turnbuckles reusable. I am sorry world politics is affecting your access to parts. Joe\n\njohnson, google translate is your friend.:lol: nited States, China now has a manufacturer of bear aircraft in Dalian. It is said that the company has acquired the American Bear Company. I am not sure, it should be a very old model. How old is the old iron of the ox, isn’t it suitable for 666? It is really courageous to build cub in China. It should be difficult. Basic 90% of the accessories must be imported in China. It is unimaginable. This is the same as the Chinese Peking Opera in China. Is it difficult? Don't worry about my Chinese level eight. Do you think that the drawings of the bear plane will buy the processing level? The key parts that will have problems will not have drawings or incomplete drawings, and a large number of finished parts and technology manufacturing in the United States.\n\nSagelite, If you're around, I'm flying the A-1 Cubsky towing banners and Skywriting at the Alxa Air Show And Dune Buggy Rally, Inner Mongolia until the 6th. Flying here next to the Gobi Desert is pretty amazing. Can you come visit?\n\nI am so sorry see your post just now,1th-7th October is National Day of China,I am in xi‘an city that about 300 miles to Hohhot City，Inner Mongolia.It is a pity that I missed the wonderful show.Wish next time I could have see your fly with my eyes and meet you in china,appreciate to you help me a lot on my cub project.\n\nJustright135,please do not doubt the level of China's manufacturing industry,China make everything,The following photos is product of a manufacturing company I visited recently,maybe that could show the level of China's manufacturing industry.One of the parameters I know is steel structure of this 3D printer permissible error is +/-0.01mm,equal to +/-0.000394inch,that's very hard to control shrinkage and buckling distortion for a 10 feet hight and 20 feet width welding parts.\n\nThe casting part's surface.\n\nAttachments\n\n3Dprinter2.jpg\n\n3Dprinter3.jpg\n\nHere is some advice from 50+ years in aviation. New/ experimental parts that won't kill you if they don't work , carefully try one at a time, never a bunch of new stuff at one time. Parts that can kill you , like a prop, use proven parts. I.e. Cato propeller, whirlwind propeller are two good choices. You will have plenty to deal with learning to fly the new airplane that's working correctly, leave the test flying new equipment to someone else."
