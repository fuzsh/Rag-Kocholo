TL3.12 Issue date: 29 November 2007 ENGINES AND PROPELLERS FITTED TO LAA AIRCRAFT This Technical Leaflet lists all of <strong>the</strong> propeller/engine combinations that have been approved by LAA Engineering, for information purposes only. This list may be useful when trying <strong>to</strong> decide which propeller <strong>to</strong> fit <strong>to</strong> your <strong>aircraft</strong>. This list should be treated with caution, as <strong>the</strong>re is no guarantee that if a combination has been approved in <strong>the</strong> past it will be approved again <strong>to</strong>day. It follows that none of <strong>the</strong>se combinations can be considered “LAA recommended”. Indeed many of <strong>the</strong>m may be far from optimum <strong>and</strong> may have been approved for a special purpose such as a ferry flight. Those which have been approved on one <strong>aircraft</strong> only should be treated with particular suspicion. Propellers are expensive items so if <strong>the</strong>re is any doubt regarding <strong>the</strong> suitability of any propeller <strong>to</strong> a particular airframe/engine, LAA Engineering should be contacted for advice. Unless a particular propeller is specified on <strong>the</strong> Operating Limitations Sheet of <strong>the</strong> Permit <strong>to</strong> Fly of an <strong>aircraft</strong>, or on <strong>the</strong> Propeller List PTL/1 for <strong>the</strong> specific type, it may not be <strong>fitted</strong> without authorisation from LAA Engineering. 200 ACRO ADVANCED ACRO ADVANCED Type Engine Manufacturer Engine Model Prop Manufacturer Prop Model Prop Pitch No. Approved Regn ACRO ADVANCED VW (ACRO) 2100 LODGE CJL 126 54" X 42" 1 BPAA ACRO ADVANCED VW (ACRO) 2100 LODGE CJL 126 54" X 44" 1 BPAA 327 AERO AT-3 Type Engine Manufacturer Engine Model Prop Manufacturer Prop Model Prop Pitch No. Approved Regn AERO AT-3 ROTAX 912-ULS GT -2/173/VRR FW101 SRTC 1 UKAT AERO AT-3 ROTAX 912-ULS NEUFORM AS/1730/1950 1 UKAT 332 AERO C-104 Type Engine Manufacturer Engine Model Prop Manufacturer Prop Model Prop Pitch No. Approved Regn AERO C-104 WALTER MINOR 4-111 HOFFMAN HO40-200-102L 1 CCOB 202 AERO DESIGNS PULSAR Type Engine Manufacturer Engine Model Prop Manufacturer Prop Model Prop Pitch No. Approved Regn PULSAR JABIRU 2200A GT 2/151/105 1 BXDU PULSAR JABIRU 2200A SENSENICH WC56FJ-54 56" DIA 54" 1 BXDU PULSAR ROTAX 582 GSC TECH-II 56" DIA 7 PULS PULSAR ROTAX 582 GSC TECH-II 56" X 44" 1 BSFA PULSAR ROTAX 582 PEERY 54" X 44" 3 BULM PULSAR ROTAX 582 PEERY 56" X 44" 9 BUYB PULSAR ROTAX 582 WARP DRIVE 2 BLADED 56" DIA 1 BVJH PULSAR ROTAX 582 WARP DRIVE RPM 2 BLADED 54" DIA 1 BTRF PULSAR ROTAX 582 WARP DRIVE RPM 2 BLADED 56" DIA 3 BVTW PULSAR ROTAX 912 GSC TECH-II 60" DIA 1 EPOX PULSAR XP ROTAX 912 GSC TECH-II 60" DIA 1 LEEN PULSAR 3 ROTAX 912 UL GSC TECH-11 60" DIAMETER 1 CDNF PULSAR XP ROTAX 912 UL GSC TECH-111 60" DIAMETER 1 PLSA PULSAR 3 ROTAX 912-ULS ARPLAST PV50 3 BLADED 66" DIA 1 BYJL 202A AERO DESIGNS PULSAR XP Type Engine Manufacturer Engine Model Prop Manufacturer Prop Model Prop Pitch No. Approved Regn PULSAR XP ROTAX 912 ARPLAST PV50 3 BLADED 62" DIA 1 XPXP PULSAR XP ROTAX 912 GSC TECH-II 60" DIA 2 BUZB PULSAR XP ROTAX 912 GSC TECH-II 60" DIAMETER 3 WYNS AERO DESIGNS PULSAR 812-XP ROTAX 912 UL GSC GTA 2 BLADED 64" DIAMETER 1 CBLA AERO DESIGNS PULSAR XP ROTAX 912 UL IVOPROP IFA 3 BLADED 60" DIAMETER 1 CEDJ 175 AERO DESIGNS STARLITE Type Engine Manufacturer Engine Model Prop Manufacturer Prop Model Prop Pitch No. Approved Regn STAR-LITE SL-1 ROTAX 447 ECOPROP 1 SOLA STAR-LITE SL-1 ROTAX 447 GSC TECH-II 50" DIA 1 UIDA 29 November 2007 Page 1 of 62
