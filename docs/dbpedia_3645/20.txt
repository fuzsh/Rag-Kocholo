History

A post office called Enterprise has been in operation since 1899. It was settled largely by residents of the town of Hebron, later abandoned. The town was so named for the settlers' enterprising plan to find a water supply. Cattle ranchers thrived in the area, but the town needed a consistent water supply to sustain themselves and for agriculture to spread. The settlers decided to take on the ambitious project of constructing a dam. Many thought that the dam would be impossible to accomplish and left the area. The rest of the settlers began work on the dam. With a lot of work and little return, the dam was completed, and the reservoir has supported the town ever since.
