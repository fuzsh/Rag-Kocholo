        "text": "Section 51.207 of the Texas Education Code allows the University of Texas at Dallas to restrict parking on our campus to vehicles with a parking permit or pass from the University, and to issue citations to vehicles that do not have a current parking permit or pass. It also requires UT Dallas to enforce Texas vehicle inspection laws.\n\nGeneral Parking Permit Information\n\nBuying a Permit\n\nParking permits are available to all current UT Dallas visitors, students, faculty, and staff. You can buy a permit in-person from the Parking Office or you can buy your permit online. Please note, the Parking Office accepts credit and debit cards, but not cash or checks.\n\nPurchasing a permit allows you to park according to the privileges of the permit you purchased. However, purchasing a permit does not guarantee parking in a specific space, lot, or garage.\n\nA permit can be purchased as soon as a customer has access to their Parking Account. Commuter students, faculty, and staff may park in Green parking without a permit from the first day of class until Census Day. This grace period only applies to the Fall and Spring semesters. The Summer semester requires a permit at all times. On-campus residents may park in their respective housing lot without a permit from the scheduled University Housing move-in dates until Census Day. With the exception of the Grace period for Green and housing areas, all other parking areas will be enforced throughout the year.\n\nYou must purchase a parking permit before the Spring or Fall Census Day to avoid citations.\n\nYou can register your vehicles to your Virtual Permit through the online Parking Portal. To register a vehicle online, log in to your MyParking account and select the vehicles tab. You will then be able to add a vehicle by entering the license plate and other vehicle details. Students may register two (2) vehicles to their virtual permit and employees may register five (5) vehicles to their virtual permit; however, only one vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one vehicle on campus at one time may lead to citations.\n\nA permit must be purchased and linked to your vehicle before parking on campus to avoid citations. You may add vehicles to your permit at anytime online via the MyParking portal, but you must contact our office at park@utdallas.edu to remove vehicles. Vehicles may only be registered to one customer. If your vehicle is already in the system due to citations or because it has been registered to another customer, you will not be able to add the vehicle to your account. You must contact our office at park@utdallas.edu to have the license plate verified for registration. Please note vehicles can be requested to be updated up to three times per semester. Exchanging vehicles on your permit more frequently may be denied.\n\nIt is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving a citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information immediately after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you drive a different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently registered to your permit before parking on campus.\n\nParking permits may not be purchased, transferred or obtained from any source or party other than the UT Dallas Parking and Transportation Office. Displaying or registering a parking permit that belongs to another customer is strictly prohibited and may lead to vehicle immobilization and additional fees and penalties.\n\nStudents, faculty, or staff from other UT System institutions may submit their University parking permit receipt to the Parking & Transportation Office via email to be issued a comparable reciprocal UTD permit. The email request must be sent from your UT institution email address, and the receipt must display your name, date of purchase, and the amount paid for your permit.\n\nReturning a Permit\n\nParking Enforcement\n\nParking regulations are continuously enforced for:\n\nFire lanes.\n\nLoading docks.\n\nService Vehicle spaces.\n\nGrass and all other areas where parking is prohibited.\n\nReserved parking spaces.\n\nPurple parking.\n\nOrange parking.\n\nEvening Orange parking.\n\nGold parking.\n\nAccessible parking.\n\nPay-by-Space metered parking.\n\nParking regulations are enforced Monday-Thursday 9:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m., and Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., for:\n\nGreen parking.\n\nUniversity Village Apartments parking.\n\nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking.\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking.\n\nViolating parking regulations will result in a citation.\n\nNo overnight campus parking is allowed without prior authorization from both Parking & Transportation and the University Police Department.\n\nTwo vehicles cannot share the same parking space. If you drive a motorcycle, you cannot park it in a space that is already being used by another vehicle, even if there is room leftover in that parking space.\n\nParking Options\n\nParking Options Option Available Parking Spaces Green Permit\n\nGreen parking\n\nMore Information…\n\nGold Permit\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nMore Information…\n\nEvening Orange Permit\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nOrange parking after 5:00 p.m.\n\nMore Information…\n\nOrange Permit\n\nOrange parking\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nMore Information…\n\nPurple Permit\n\nPurple parking\n\nOrange parking\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nMore Information…\n\nUniversity Village & Canyon Creek Heights Apartments Permit\n\nUniversity Village Apartments parking\n\nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking\n\nGreen parking at Lot W at the Waterview Science and Technology Center (WSTC)\n\nGreen parking at Lot V at the Research Operations Center (ROC)\n\nGreen parking at Lot U\n\nGreen parking at Lot T\n\nGreen parking at Synergy Park North (SPN)\n\nGreen parking at Callier Center Dallas (CD)\n\nOvernight parking is strictly prohibited in commuter lots or garages.\n\nMore Information…\n\nUniversity Village & Canyon Creek Heights Apartments + Gold Combo Permit\n\nUniversity Village Apartments parking\n\nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nOvernight parking is strictly prohibited in commuter lots or garages.\n\nMore Information…\n\nUniversity Village & Canyon Creek Heights Apartments + Orange Combo Permit\n\nUniversity Village Apartments parking\n\nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking\n\nOrange parking\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nOvernight parking is strictly prohibited in commuter lots or garages.\n\nMore Information…\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls Permit\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking\n\nGreen parking at Lot W at the Waterview Science and Technology Center (WSTC)\n\nGreen parking at Lot V at the Research Operations Center (ROC)\n\nGreen parking at Lot U\n\nGreen parking at Lot T\n\nGreen parking at Synergy Park North (SPN)\n\nGreen parking at Callier Center Dallas (CD)\n\nOvernight parking is strictly prohibited in commuter lots or garages.\n\nMore Information…\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls + Gold Combo Permit\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nOvernight parking is strictly prohibited in commuter lots or garages.\n\nMore Information…\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls + Orange Combo Permit\n\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking\n\nOrange parking\n\nGold parking\n\nGreen parking\n\nOvernight parking is strictly prohibited in commuter lots or garages.\n\nMore Information…\n\nAccessible Parking Permit\n\nAccessible parking\n\nMore Information…\n\nPay-By-Space\n\nPay-by-Space metered parking\n\n$2/hour\n\nMore Information…\n\nDepartment Coupon Code\n\nPay-by-Space metered parking\n\nFree for the guest of a department.

This system utilizes License Plate Recognition (LPR [License Plate Recognition] ) and will identify your vehicle by its license plate. This system removes the need for physical stickers and allows all permit holders to easily add and maintain vehicles on their accounts.\n\nLicense Plate Recognition (LPR [License Plate Recognition] ) is camera-based technology that quickly scans multiple vehicle license plates. This technology allows us to transition to virtual permits by allowing a vehicle’s license plate to serve in place of a sticker or decal permit. LPR cameras can scan your license plate to check if you have appropriate parking permissions, which eliminates the need to place a physical permit on your windshield. LPR is a mobile system that uses vehicle-mounted cameras to scan license plates and verify virtual permits in all lots and garages on campus.\n\nVirtual Permits will be beneficial to our campus as they eliminate the need to move your permit between multiple vehicles. They also support sustainability by reducing paper usage, ink, and plastic used for permit distribution and postage.\n\nYou can register your vehicles to your Virtual Permit through the online Parking Portal. To register a vehicle online, log in to your MyParking account and select the vehicles tab. You will then be able to add a vehicle by entering the license plate and other vehicle details. Students may register two (2) vehicles to their virtual permit and employees may register five (5) vehicles to their virtual permit; however, only one vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one vehicle on campus at one time may lead to citations.\n\nYou may add vehicles to your permit at anytime online via the MyParking portal, but you must contact our office at park@utdallas.edu to remove vehicles. Please note vehicles can be requested to be updated up to three times per semester. Exchanging vehicles on your permit more frequently may be denied.\n\nAll virtual permits are non-transferable and can only be used by the individual to whom it is assigned. Permit sharing is prohibited and may lead to parking citations and/or vehicle immobilization.\n\nIt is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving an unnecessary citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information immediately after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you drive a different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently registered to your permit before parking on campus.\n\nUT Dallas Parking & Transportation Services utilizes vehicle state registration from the Texas Department of Transportation to determine relationships between vehicles and drivers. Vehicles not registered with UT Dallas Parking & Transportation may be linked to a customer’s account based on state registration records.\n\nIf you no longer own a vehicle, it is imperative that you properly transfer the vehicle to the new owner. Failing to properly transfer a vehicle into the buyer’s name could result in the seller being held responsible for tickets, toll violations, or even crimes committed with the vehicle. To ensure this doesn’t happen to you, accompany the buyer to your county tax office to ensure a vehicle title application is filed.\n\nA dealer is not required to title in the dealership’s name if you sell or trade-in your vehicle to a licensed motor vehicle dealer. The vehicle stays in your name until it is sold to an individual, which may take months or in some cases, years. To protect yourself, file a Vehicle Transfer Notification. When a vehicle transfer notification is received, TxDMV [Texas Department of Motor Vehicles] updates the motor vehicle record to show the vehicle as sold. When you file the notification within 30 days from the date of sale, you cannot be held responsible for parking tickets that have been committed by the person who purchased the vehicle.\n\nAccessible Parking\n\nTo use one of the Accessible parking spaces on campus, you must already own a State of Texas Accessible license plate/placard, and you must purchase a UT Dallas Accessible permit. When purchasing your permit:\n\nIf you use a state-issued placard, please present either the original, a photocopy, or picture of your placard via email to park@utdallas.edu for validation.\n\nIf you use an state-issued license plate or a Disabled Veterans plate that features the International Symbol of Access (ISA [International Symbol of Access] ), please submit documentation either in person or via email to park@utdallas.edu for validation. Documentation can be the tax receipt for your plate, a photo of your license plate, or any certified government document in your name with your plate number listed.\n\nOnce your Accessible parking credentials are validated, you will be able to see the Accessible parking permit option available for purchase online.\n\nAccessible Parking Spaces (PDF [Portable Document Format File] )\n\nIf Accessible spaces are not available, those with a state-issued license plate that features the International Symbol of Access (ISA [International Symbol of Access] ), or a state-issued Accessible placard, and displaying a UTD permit (either an Accessible parking permit or visitor pass), may park in any available non-reserved parking space or metered parking space at no additional cost.\n\nVeteran Parking\n\nDisabled Veteran Parking\n\nPer SB 792 (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ), as of January 1, 2022, anyone parking in an Accessible parking space must have an Accessible license plate or an Accessible parking placard that features the International Symbol of Access (ISA [International Symbol of Access] ). Currently, disabled veteran license plates do not feature the ISA. Texans with disabled veteran license plates wishing to use Accessible parking spaces in 2022 may apply for an Accessible parking placard or for a new disabled veteran license plate featuring the ISA. The veteran must meet the eligibility requirements for an Accessible parking placard or Accessible person license plate featuring the ISA. Not all disabilities that qualify a veteran for disabled veteran license plates will qualify a veteran for a disabled veteran license plate featuring the ISA. More information can be found at the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles website.\n\nYou may apply for an accessible parking placard and/or disabled veteran license plate at the office of your local county tax assessor-collector:\n\nFor an accessible parking placard, download the Application for Persons with Disabilities Parking Placard and/or License Plate - Form VTR-214 (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ).\n\nFor a disabled veteran license plate with or without the ISA, download the Application for Disabled Veteran License Plates and/or Parking Placards - Form VTR-615 (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ).\n\nHave your doctor or health care provider complete the Disability Statement section of the application or provide an original prescription.\n\nSubmit the completed application(s) and payment (if applicable) to your county tax office.\n\nDecorated Veteran Parking\n\nVehicles with certain veteran license plates may qualify for a Green, University Commons Residence Halls, University Village Apartments or Canyon Creek Heights Apartments permit at no cost, if they do not qualify for an Accessible parking permit.\n\nPlease note the following designations that are allowed a complimentary UT Dallas parking permit:\n\nAir and Air with Valor Medals\n\nAirman’s Medal\n\nBronze Star and Bronze Star with Valor Medals\n\nCoast Guard Medal\n\nCommendation Medal with Valor\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor\n\nDefense Meritorious Service Medal\n\nDefense Superior Service Medal\n\nDisabled Veteran\n\nDistinguished Flying Cross Medal\n\nDistinguished Service Medal\n\nLegion of Merit Medal\n\nLegion of Valor\n\nAir Force Cross Medal\n\nArmy Distinguished Service Cross\n\nMedal of Honor\n\nNavy Cross Medal\n\nMeritorious Service Medal\n\nMilitary Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal\n\nNavy and Marine Corps Medal\n\nPearl Harbor Survivor\n\nPrisoner of War Medal\n\nPurple Heart Medal\n\nSilver Star Medal\n\nSoldier’s Medal\n\nWorld War II\n\nThese vehicles are only exempt from the parking fees if they are being operated by or for the transportation of the person who registered the vehicle with the above mentioned license plates.\n\nPay-By-Space\n\nThere are over 360 Pay-by-Space cashless metered parking spaces on campus.\n\nLocations:\n\nParking Lot F, Visitor Center Lot (3-Hour Limit, 25 Spaces)\n\nParking Structure 1, Level 1 (85 Spaces) and Level 2 (12 Spaces)\n\nParking Structure 3, Level 1 (37 Spaces)\n\nParking Structure 4, Level 1 (137 Spaces)\n\nParking Lot B1 (PayByPhone only, 5 Spaces)\n\nParking Lot M East (PayByPhone only, 66 Spaces)\n\nTo use a Pay-by-Space metered parking space, note your parking space number and go up to the nearest payment kiosk (“LUKE Machine”), tap any key to wake it up, then follow its instructions. Please note some locations are PayByPhone only and cannot be paid via central meter or coupon code. You have two ways to pay at the LUKE machines:\n\nSwipe your credit card or debit card through the kiosk\n\nEnter a Department Coupon Code\n\nPlease remember to keep your receipt; It shows the time when your meter expires. If your time has not yet expired, and you paid via credit/debit card or Department Coupon Code, you can return to the kiosk and add more time.\n\nPayByPhone: Metered parking is also payable via PayByPhone in all metered parking locations. Some locations are PayByPhone only and cannot be paid via central meter or coupon code. To use PayByPhone for your metered parking, note your parking space number and parking lot location. Each location has a specific location code to ensure you purchase time for the correct area. The location codes are:\n\nParking Lot F, Visitor Center Lot (3-Hour Limit): 3005\n\nParking Structure 1: 3010\n\nParking Structure 3: 3014\n\nParking Structure 4: 3015\n\nParking Lot B1: 27760\n\nParking Lot M East: 27761\n\nIf you already have an account with the PayByPhone service, you can pay through their website; through their Android™ or iPhone® app; or by calling 888.450.7275. Vendor service fees will apply. The current transaction fee for PayByPhone use is $0.40. If you used PayByPhone, you can add more time remotely, and even set up the service to send you an SMS [Short Message Service] five minutes before your time expires.\n\nMeter Parking Rate: $2/hour.\n\nMetered parking is enforced 24/7 and time can be purchased up until midnight of each day. A new transaction must be entered if parking past midnight.\n\nDepartment Coupon Code\n\nPlease contact us if your department would like us to create a coupon code that you can hand out to your guests for use at Pay-By-Space metered parking spaces. We can create:\n\nA single code.\n\nA new code every month, which expires at the end of each month.\n\nA code just for a special event, which lasts only for the duration of the event, or only for a limited number of transactions.\n\nOnce a month, we’ll send you a report of how often your code was used, and charge your department. Charges go directly to your cost center.\n\nVisitor Pass\n\nVisitors to campus include any person who is not affiliated with the University as a student, faculty, or staff member. Currently enrolled students, or currently employed faculty or staff, do not qualify for visitor permits.\n\nCurrent UT Dallas students, faculty, or staff that require access to a restricted parking area may be eligible for a short-term permit. To be eligible for this permit, the student, faculty, or staff member must already own a current UT Dallas parking permit, and the request must be for legitimate business or academic purposes.\n\nVisitor parking can be issued to those visiting UTD for legitimate business or academic purposes if requested by the sponsoring department. Departments may use our online permit request tool or visit one of our offices during our normal business hours to obtain a permit for a University approved guest. Please reach out to the department you are visiting to have them arrange parking for you.\n\nIf you are a faculty or staff member and you need to arrange parking for a guest visiting the campus, permits can also be requested online in advance and emailed to you as a PDF [Portable Document Format File] document that you may email to your guest to be printed. To request an emailed permit, complete a permit request form online two business days in advance of the guest arrival.\n\nIf you are resident living in University Village Apartments, Canyon Creek Heights Apartments, or University Commons Residence Halls and you need to arrange parking for a guest visiting your residence, permits can also be requested online in advance and emailed to you as a PDF [Portable Document File Format] document that you may email to your guest to be printed. To request an emailed permit, complete a permit request form online two business days in advance of the guest arrival. A visitor parking pass is required Monday-Thursday from 9:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. and Friday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. in the housing parking areas.\n\nNon-sponsored visitors to campus may utilize our metered parking available throughout different areas of our campus, or contact park@utdallas.edu for more options.\n\nPlease contact park@utdallas.edu for any questions or concerns about visitor parking.\n\nPlease note that a visitor permit is not required for Green, University Village Apartments, Canyon Creek Heights Apartments, or University Commons Residence Halls parking areas outside of enforcement hours:\n\nMonday-Thursday from 9:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m.\n\nFriday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nA VISITOR PERMIT IS ALWAYS NEEDED DURING THE ABOVE TIMES TO AVOID PARKING CITATIONS\n\nElectric Vehicle Charging\n\nParking & Transportation services currently has seventeen electric vehicle (EV [Electric Vehicle] ) charging stations on campus:\n\nSix in PS1, Level 1: Smart EV Chargers\n\nFour in PS3, Level 2: Smart EV Chargers\n\nTwo in PS4, Level 1\n\nTwo in Lot J\n\nOne in Lot T\n\nTwo in Lot V\n\nThese spaces have signage reserving these spaces for electric vehicles only.. Non-electric vehicles parked in EV [Electric Vehicle] spaces are subject to immediate vehicle immobilization or towing. To utilize electric vehicle parking, your vehicle must be charging at all times. If your vehicle is in an EV space and is not charging, you are subject to a parking citation.\n\nSmart EV Dual-Port Chargers\n\nPS1 and PS3 locations have new dual-port, Level 2 smart EV [Electric Vehicle] chargers. The PS1 EV spaces are located on the first level, and the PS3 EV spaces are located on the second level. These chargers are available at a fee of $0.03/minute. No parking permit nor meter payment is required in these spaces, but your vehicle must be connected and charging the entire time the vehicle is parked. There is no minimum or maximum occupancy time in these spaces. The $0.03/minute fee will continue the entire time your vehicle is connected, even if your vehicle is fully charged. Payment for these spaces is available via the GRAVITI EV CHARGING phone app, available at Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.\n\nSingle-Port Chargers\n\nPS4, Lot J, Lot T, and Lot V are single-port chargers with no smart features. There is no cost to charge your vehicle at these stations, but you must abide by parking rules and regulations by either paying the LUKE parking meter, if in a metered space in PS4, or utilizing a Gold or higher-level parking permit in Lot J or Lot V, or a University Village Apartments, Canyon Creek Heights Apartments, or University Commons Residence Halls permit in Lot T. Visitor permits are also eligible to utilize EV spaces in these locations. To ensure that all electric vehicle owners have the opportunity to utilize this service, there is a 4-hour maximum time limit for charging and parking in reserved electric vehicle spaces in Lot J, PS4, Lot T, and Lot V.\n\nMotorcycle Parking\n\nThere are convenient spaces specifically reserved for motorcycles located in Lot J, Lot T, PS1, and PS4. To park in a motorcycle space, you must have a Green, Gold, Orange, or Purple permit. Motorcycles may also park in standard vehicle spaces as long as the motorcycle is registered to the appropriate permit type, or has paid the meter, if in metered parking.\n\nFor those that own a University Village Apartments, Canyon Creek Heights Apartments or University Commons Residence Halls permit, you may park your motorcycle in your respective housing parking area. To utilize the reserved motorcycle spaces on campus, or any other commuter parking, you must own a Housing-Combo permit.\n\nMotorcycles must be parked properly within designated space lines, and cannot park on sidewalks, medians, accessways, or other non-parking areas. Two vehicles cannot share the same parking space. If you drive a motorcycle, you cannot park it in a space that is already being used by another vehicle, even if there is room leftover in that parking space.\n\nCitations\n\nYou can pay citations online, or in-person at the Parking Office. The Parking Office accepts credit/debit cards but not cash or checks.\n\nPlease note that if you pay for a citation on a vehicle, that vehicle will then be registered to you, and you may be responsible for future citations on that vehicle.\n\nCitation payments are NOT refundable.\n\nIf you receive a citation, you will have 14 days to pay it. On the 14th day, a $10 penalty will be added, and another $10 penalty will be added every month until it is paid, adding up to $40 in late fees per citation. Students with unpaid citations will not be able to register for classes and their transcripts will not be released. Faculty and staff with unpaid citations will have their records marked and their parking permit revoked; any renumerations owed them when they separate from the University will be blocked.\n\nVehicles may receive a parking citation each calendar day, even if the vehicle has not moved since the previous day. Additionally, vehicles may be cited more than once, even in the same day, if they are committing multiple violations, or if the vehicle moves locations.\n\nReceiving parking citations will result in a negative account hold, which prevents students from receiving certain services. Parking citations will place a B35 “Parking Fine” hold on student accounts. A B35 hold will not prevent students from registering for classes, but it will prevent the ability to receive a transcript.\n\nIf a student owes more than $500 to the University and their balance is more than 45 days past due, a B98 “Past Due Balance” hold will apply. A B98 hold will prevent class registration, loan activity, and refund distributions.\n\nTo release a parking hold, you must pay your parking balance via the MyParking portal. Once citations have been paid, the hold will be released the following business day. To check student account hold information, log in to the Galaxy portal, select Orion Self-Service, then select Student Center.\n\nAppealing Citations\n\nIf you feel you have received a citation in error, you may file an appeal using the following guidelines:\n\nAppeals can be accepted only through the online appeal portal through MyParking. Please have your citation or license plate available.\n\nAppeals must be filed before the 14th calendar day from the date of citation issuance. On the 14th day, your ability to appeal is forfeited.\n\nLate fees will not accumulate while a citation is under appeal.\n\nIf your appeal is rejected, you must pay your citation promptly. Late fees will begin accumulating monthly after an appeal is denied.\n\nAn appeal cannot be filed for a citation that has already been paid. Once a citation has been paid, the ability to appeal is forfeited. If a citation is paid while under appeal, the appeal will be cancelled.\n\nA vehicle may continue to be cited, even while under the appeal process if the vehicle is still found in violation.

The University of Texas at Dallas is not responsible for any damage to a vehicle during impoundment, relocation or storage.\n\nBooting: The owner or driver of a booted vehicle may recover the vehicle after paying a $75 booting fee. The booting fee can be paid at the Parking Office during regular business hours or any time through the online parking portal. Students, faculty and staff may log into the parking portal by using their UTD NetID and password. Non-affiliates may log into the parking portal by creating a guest account. The owner or driver of a booted vehicle must also complete a boot release form at the Parking Office. A valid driver’s license is required to complete a boot release form and have a vehicle released. If the Parking Office is closed, the owner or driver can call UTD Police at 972.883.2222 and an officer will meet you at the vehicle. A valid driver’s license is required to complete a boot release form and have a vehicle released. The owner or driver of a booted vehicle has 24 hours from the time the vehicle is booted to pay the booting fee and claim a booted vehicle. Booted vehicles will be towed off campus at the owner’s expense if the booting fee is not paid and the vehicle claimed within 24 hours from the time the vehicle is booted.\n\nBooted vehicles are not allowed to park on UT Dallas property (this includes metered parking areas) after the boot is released until all citations are paid or a payment plan is established with Parking and Transportation Services. Previously booted vehicles are subject to towing if parked on UT Dallas property without paying all outstanding citations, or if the owner or driver defaults on a previously established payment plan or does not make payments on time.\n\nTowing: A vehicle’s owner may recover an impounded vehicle after paying all impound fees due. For additional information about impound fees and documentation needed to recover an impounded vehicle, please contact Signature Towing (972.423.4010 / www.signaturetowing.com).\n\nSuspension of Parking Privileges: Immobilized or impounded vehicles are not allowed to park on UT Dallas property (this includes metered parking areas) until all outstanding citations have been paid or a payment plan has been established. Failure to comply may result in additional vehicle immobilization or impoundment at the vehicle owner’s expense.\n\nParking at Northside"
