This value is calculated by a qualified appraiser and is generally related to the value of the development potential of the land which the building occupies. An easement is a legal agreement between a property owner and the easement holding organization and will govern the future treatment of the property to insure it will be appropriate to the historic building.\n\nContact the Historic Properties Program Manager at (801) 533-0858.\n\nUtah State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)\n\nVisit website: https://history.utah.gov/preservation/\n\nFederal Tax Credits for Commercial Properties\n\nThe Utah State Historic Preservation Office administers the federal investment tax credit program.

Consult your local planning officials or city manager about the process to approve conditional uses which may involve a Historic Landmarks Commission, Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment or Hearing Officer, and elected Council or Commission.\n\nNon-conforming Rights\n\nA non-conforming right relates to zoning allowances or situations that are permitted to remain in use as they are even though they do not meet current zoning codes because the were legally existing at a prior time before the current zoning regulations become effective. These buildings and/or uses can be considered to be \"grandfathered\" under previous legal conditions. Many historic buildings have non-conforming rights with respect to site location, density, and parking. Thus, the value of an historic building's non-conforming rights can have a positive economic impact on a project's feasibility."
