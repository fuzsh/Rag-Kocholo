In order to get an FSA loan, a guarantee on a loan made by a commercial lender, or a land contract, you need to create a detailed business plan. Lenders look closely at business plans to determine if you can afford to repay the loan.\n\nHow USDA Can Help\n\nWhether you need a good get-started guide, have a plan that you would like to verify, or have a plan you’re looking to update for your next growth phase, USDA can help connect you to resources to help your decisions.\n\nYour state's beginning farmer and rancher coordinator can connect you to local resources in your community to help you establish a successful business plan. Reach out to your state's coordinator for one-on-one technical assistance and guidance. They can also connect you with organizations that specifically serve beginning farmers and ranchers.\n\nIt is important to know that no single solution fits everyone, and you should research, seek guidance, and make the best decision for your operation according to your own individual priorities.\n\nBuild a Farm Business Plan\n\nThere are many different styles of business plans. Some are written documents; others may be a set of worksheets that you complete. No matter what format you choose, several key aspects of your operation are important to consider.\n\nUse the guidelines below to draft your business plan. Answering these kinds of questions in detail will help you create and develop your final business plan. Once you have a business plan for your operation, prepare for your visit to a USDA service center. During your visit, we can help you with the necessary steps to register your business and get access to key USDA programs.\n\nAre you starting a new farm or ranch, or are you already in business? If you are already in business:\n\nWhat products do you produce?\n\nWhat is the size of your operation?\n\nWhat agricultural production and financial management training or experience do you, your family members, or your business partners have?\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\nThis is your business. Defining your mission, vision and goals is crucial to the success of your business. These questions will help provide a basis for developing other aspects of your business plan.\n\nWhat values are important to you and the operation as a whole?\n\nWhat short- and long-term goals do you have for your operation?\n\nHow do you plan to start, expand, or change your operation?\n\nWhat plans do you have to make your operation efficient or more profitable?\n\nWhat type of farm or ranch model (conventional, sustainable, organic, or alternative agricultural practices) do you plan to use?\n\nStarting your own business is no small feat. You will need to determine how your business will be structured and organized, and who will manage (or help manage) your business. You will need to be able to convey this to others who are involved as well.\n\nWhat is the legal structure of your business? Will it be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, trust, limited liability company, or other type of entity?\n\nWhat help will you need in operating and managing your farm or ranch?\n\nWhat other resources, such as a mentor or community-based organization, do you plan to use?\n\nMarketing is a valuable tool for businesses. It can help your businesses increase brand awareness, engagement and sales. It is important to narrow down your target audience and think about what you are providing that others cannot.\n\nWhat are you going to produce?\n\nWho is your target consumer?\n\nIs there demand for what you are planning to produce?\n\nWhat is the cost of production?\n\nHow much will you sell it for and when do you expect to see profit?\n\nHow will you get your product to consumers? What are the transportation costs and requirements?\n\nHow will you market your products?\n\nDo you know the relevant federal, state, and local food safety regulations? What licensing do you need for your operation?\n\nToday there are many types of land, tools, and resources to choose from. You will need to think about what you currently have and what you will need to obtain to achieve your goals.\n\nWhat resources do you have or will you need for your business?\n\nDo you already have access to farmland? If not, do you plan to lease, rent, or purchase land?\n\nWhat equipment do you need?\n\nIs the equipment and real estate that you own or rent adequate to conduct your operation? If not, how do you plan to address those needs?\n\nWill you be implementing any conservation practices to sustain your operation?\n\nWhat types of workers will you need to operate the farm?\n\nWhat additional resources do you need?\n\nNow that you have an idea of what you are going to provide and what you will need to run your operation you will need to consider the finances of your operation.\n\nHow will you finance the business?\n\nWhat are your current assets (property or investments you own) and liabilities (debts, loans, or payments you owe)?\n\nWill the income you generate be sufficient to pay your operating expenses, living expenses, and loan payments?\n\nWhat other sources of income are available to supplement your business income?\n\nWhat business expenses will you incur?\n\nWhat family living expenses do you pay?\n\nWhat are some potential risks or challenges you foresee for your operation? How will you manage those risks?\n\nHow will you measure the success of your business?\n\nFarm Business Plan Worksheets\n\nThe Farm Business Plan Balance Sheet can help gather information for the financial and operational aspects of your plan.\n\nForm FSA-2037 is a template that gathers information on your assets and liabilities like farm equipment, vehicles and existing loans.\n\nFSA-2037 - Farm Business Plan - Balance Sheet\n\nFSA-2037 Instructions\n\nPlanning for Conservation and Risk Management\n\nAnother key tool is a conservation plan, which determines how you want to improve the health of your land. A conservation plan can help you lay out your plan to address resource needs, costs and schedules.\n\nUSDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) staff are available at your local USDA Service Center to help you develop a conservation plan for your land based on your goals.
