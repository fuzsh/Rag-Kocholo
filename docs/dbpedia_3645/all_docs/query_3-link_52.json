The University also ranks among the best employers for New Graduates, Women, and Diversity. UT Southwestern is a 2023 Digital Health Most Wired organization.\n\nMission\n\nUT Southwestern’s mission is promoting health and a healthy society that enables achievement of full human potential. We:\n\nEDUCATE\n\nPhysicians, scientists, and caregivers optimally prepared to serve the needs of patients and society\n\nDISCOVER\n\nResearch that solves for unmet needs by finding better treatments, cures, and prevention with a commitment to ensuring real world application\n\nHEAL\n\nBest care possible today, with continuous improvement and innovation for better care tomorrow\n\nUT Southwestern Medical School\n\nIn 2023, UT Southwestern Medical School ranked among the top 25 (#24) for research and in the top 30 (#26) for primary care, and among the top 50 (#46) for Most Diverse Medical Schools, according to U.S. News & World Report’s 2022-23 Best Graduate Schools rankings.\n\nOne of the largest medical schools in the country, UT Southwestern Medical School graduates about 230 students each year, accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). Educating and training the next generation of physicians and biomedical scientists is a core mission. To ensure that UTSW students are fully prepared for the future they will encounter in the rapidly changing landscape of medicine, science, and health care delivery, the curriculum is characterized by a focus on team-based learning, close contact with faculty, meaningful mentorship opportunities, and the integration of basic science education with patient care training and experience.\n\nThe four years of medical school are divided into three distinct periods for students – pre-clerkship, clerkship, and post-clerkship. The first 18 months in the pre-clerkship phase are focused on building knowledge in basic and clinical sciences through rich, team-based learning experiences. The ensuing 18-month clerkship phase is designed to provide the opportunity to explore clinical fields and includes 42 weeks of rotations in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, neurology, and outpatient care; a 12-week period for students to complete a Scholarly Activity in an area of their choice, including basic research, clinical and translational research, community health, global health, medical education, and quality improvement; six weeks of electives; and six weeks of Step 1 preparation time. Students also complete two required courses besides residency essentials – Frontiers in Medicine and Physicians in Society.\n\nThe post-clerkship fourth year includes sub-internships and acute care rotations, electives designed to build strengths in the student’s chosen field, as well as courses tailored to ensure each graduate is prepared for the transition to residency training and future practice as a physician.\n\nPerot Family Scholars Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) prepares exceptionally talented individuals to become physician-scientists who will conduct biomedical research and translate discoveries bidirectionally between the bench and the bedside. Graduates receive both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. With major financial support from the National Institutes of Health, Perot Foundation, and other sources, the MSTP supports about 90-100 students annually.\n\nFaculty members continue to educate physicians beyond medical school. UTSW has the largest graduate training program in Texas, with more than 1,400 clinical residents who are completing their medical education with postgraduate specialty and subspecialty training. Faculty members also provide Continuing Medical Education (CME) to practicing physicians. In the most recent reportable cycle, more than 44,000 learning encounters were provided in 149 CME activities certified by UTSW.\n\nAs one of the largest state-of-the-art simulation facilities in the nation, UT Southwestern Medical Center’s Simulation Center creates real-life environments through innovative technologies, such as virtual reality, for health care learners to develop in to becoming effective, compassionate, and competent clinicians. Our enhanced simulation program integrates best practice educational theories, high fidelity environments, and innovative teaching modalities. We provide learning opportunities to all disciplines and practitioner populations including medical students, residents and fellows, UT Southwestern faculty, and other clinicians. UT Southwestern also includes 20 core facilities labs that utilize state-of-the-art equipment to provide the support services necessary to help scientists effectively and efficiently conduct research.\n\nUT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences\n\nThe Graduate School, with an enrollment of nearly 1,300 predoctoral and postdoctoral students, educates biomedical scientists, engineers, and counselors. Programs lead to the Doctor of Philosophy degree and some nondegree certificates.\n\nMost students train to become scientists who will investigate life processes from basic molecules to whole animals. Students pursue their chosen fields under the mentorship of outstanding faculty that include some of the world's most distinguished researchers.\n\nThe Graduate School has two Divisions: Basic Science and Clinical Science. These Divisions include 11 programs leading to the Ph.D. degree – Biological Chemistry; Biomedical Engineering; Cancer Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Clinical Psychology; Genetics, Development and Disease; Immunology; Molecular Biophysics; Molecular Microbiology; Neuroscience; and Organic Chemistry. UT Southwestern is highly ranked in Biochemistry, Biology, and Chemistry by U.S. News & World Report’s Best Graduate School rankings.\n\nUT Southwestern’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, launched in 2021 and is housed in the Texas Instruments Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building. UTSW’s longstanding Biomedical Engineering Graduate Program is ranked 50th in the nation (tie) among engineering school specialty rankings for biomedical engineering/bioengineering programs and listed fourth among Texas biomedical engineering programs by U.S. News & World Report Best Graduate School report.\n\nUT Southwestern School of Health Professions\n\nMore than 400 students are enrolled in UT Southwestern’s School of Health Professions.\n\nThe school currently offers seven nationally accredited degree programs: Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Clinical Research, professional doctoral degree in Physical Therapy, and master's degrees in Clinical Nutrition, Clinical Science, Health Informatics, Physician Assistant Studies, and Prosthetics–Orthotics. Most of these master’s programs are two years in length, while the Ph.D. program can last three to four years. The school has opened the first Genetic Counseling program in north Texas; this program will enroll students in the Fall of 2024. All clinical programs effectively blend classroom instruction with patient care experience or research resulting in high licensure pass rates and job placement. The school also offers four residency programs in physical therapy and one in prosthetics and orthotics. The school’s Physician Assistant Studies program is recognized among the nation’s top 10 programs in the country by U.S. News & World Report’s Best Graduate School rankings.\n\nUT Southwestern Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health\n\nThe UT Southwestern Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health is the fourth school to be created in the UT Southwestern Medical Center, and the first in the past half-century. The O'Donnell School of Public Health is located within the 13-county Dallas-Fort Worth area that has a census of 7.8 million and is the fastest-growing region in the country, with a projected population of 9.3 million by 2030. The O'Donnell School of Public Health has access to several very large health care systems across North Texas, including William P.
