The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day.\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in May in Enterprise\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in May in EnterpriseMay112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMAprJunvery coldcoldcoldcoolcomfortablecomfortablewarmhot\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nSredno Konjare, Macedonia (6,274 miles away); KÄ±rÄ±kkale, Turkey (6,706 miles); and Abhar, Iran (7,235 miles) are the far-away foreign places with temperatures most similar to Enterprise (view comparison).\n\n© OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nCompare Enterprise to another city:\n\nClouds\n\nThe month of May in Enterprise experiences decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 35% to 27%.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is May 31, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 73% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on March 1, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 48%, while on September 17, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 84%.\n\nCloud Cover Categories in May in Enterprise\n\n0% clear 20% mostly clear 40% partly cloudy 60% mostly cloudy 80% overcast 100%\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Enterprise, the chance of a wet day over the course of May is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 11% and ending it at 8%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 19% on February 27, and its lowest chance is 5% on June 18.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during May in Enterprise is essentially constant, remaining about 0.5 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 1.1 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of May in Enterprise, the length of the day is increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 48 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 1 minute, 37 seconds, and weekly increase of 11 minutes, 16 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is May 1, with 13 hours, 47 minutes of daylight and the longest day is May 31, with 14 hours, 35 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Enterprise is 6:38 AM on May 1 and the earliest sunrise is 23 minutes earlier at 6:15 AM on May 31.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 8:25 PM on May 1 and the latest sunset is 25 minutes later at 8:50 PM on May 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Enterprise during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during May, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 6:13 AM and sets 14 hours, 46 minutes later, at 8:59 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:46 AM and sets 9 hours, 34 minutes later, at 5:20 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in May in Enterprise\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in May in EnterpriseMay112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMAprJun001010202020303040405050506060700001010202030303040405050606070\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for May 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in May in Enterprise\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in May in EnterpriseMay112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMAprJunApr 812:22 PMApr 812:22 PMApr 235:50 PMApr 235:50 PMMay 79:23 PMMay 79:23 PMMay 237:54 AMMay 237:54 AMJun 66:38 AMJun 66:38 AMJun 217:09 PMJun 217:09 PM7:05 AM7:05 AM8:24 PM8:24 PM8:23 PM8:23 PM6:58 AM6:58 AM6:01 AM6:01 AM8:30 PM8:30 PM8:19 PM8:19 PM6:03 AM6:03 AM5:57 AM5:57 AM9:44 PM9:44 PM9:20 PM9:20 PM6:26 AM6:26 AM\n\nMay 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 50%3:05 AMESE1:07 PMWSW-8:06 AMS231,903 mi 2 37%3:39 AMESE2:20 PMWSW-8:59 AMS229,601 mi 3 26%4:09 AMESE3:33 PMW-9:50 AMS227,661 mi 4 16%4:37 AME4:46 PMW-10:39 AMS226,287 mi 5 8%5:03 AME5:59 PMW-11:28 AMS225,676 mi 6 3%5:31 AMENE7:14 PMWNW-12:18 PMS225,978 mi 7 0%6:01 AMENE8:30 PMWNW-1:11 PMS227,254 mi 8 1%6:37 AMENE9:45 PMWNW-2:07 PMS229,452 mi 9 4%7:19 AMENE10:57 PMNW-3:05 PMS232,408 mi 10 10%8:09 AMNE--4:05 PMS235,860 mi 11 18%-12:02 AMNW9:06 AMNE5:03 PMS239,497 mi 12 26%-12:57 AMNW10:09 AMNE5:58 PMS243,004 mi 13 36%-1:41 AMWNW11:14 AMENE6:49 PMS246,107 mi 14 46%-2:16 AMWNW12:18 PMENE7:35 PMS248,597 mi 15 50%-2:45 AMWNW1:19 PMENE8:18 PMS250,337 mi 16 65%-3:10 AMWNW2:18 PMENE8:58 PMS251,264 mi 17 74%-3:33 AMW3:16 PME9:37 PMS251,384 mi 18 82%-3:53 AMW4:14 PME10:15 PMS250,759 mi 19 89%-4:14 AMW5:12 PME10:55 PMS249,499 mi 20 95%-4:36 AMWSW6:12 PMESE11:37 PMS247,743 mi 21 97%-5:01 AMWSW7:14 PMESE-- 22 98%-5:29 AMWSW8:19 PMESE12:22 AMS245,647 mi 23 100%-6:03 AMWSW9:26 PMSE1:11 AMS243,365 mi 24 99%-6:45 AMSW10:31 PMSE2:05 AMS241,038 mi 25 96%-7:37 AMSW11:30 PMSE3:04 AMS238,779 mi 26 91%-8:38 AMSW-4:04 AMS236,667 mi 27 84%12:22 AMSE9:46 AMWSW-5:04 AMS234,746 mi 28 74%1:05 AMESE10:58 AMWSW-6:02 AMS233,036 mi 29 64%1:41 AMESE12:11 PMWSW-6:56 AMS231,552 mi 30 50%2:12 AMESE1:22 PMWSW-7:46 AMS230,319 mi 31 40%2:39 AME2:33 PMW-8:35 AMS229,387 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Enterprise is essentially constant during May, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 7, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Enterprise is essentially constant during May, remaining within 0.3 miles per hour of 9.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 10, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.5 miles per hour, while on August 5, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.6 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Enterprise throughout May is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 53% on May 31.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Enterprise typically lasts for 5.6 months (171 days), from around April 29 to around October 17, rarely starting before April 9 or after May 17, and rarely ending before September 28 or after November 6.\n\nThe month of May in Enterprise is more likely than not fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season rapidly increasing from 57% to 98% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in May in Enterprise\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Enterprise are increasing during May, increasing by 345Â°F, from 249Â°F to 594Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Enterprise is gradually increasing during May, rising by 0.9 kWh, from 7.3 kWh to 8.3 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Enterprise are 37.574 deg latitude, -113.719 deg longitude, and 5,315 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Enterprise contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 545 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 5,415 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,615 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (9,544 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Enterprise is covered by shrubs (74%) and cropland (23%), within 10 miles by shrubs (75%) and trees (12%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (77%) and trees (18%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Enterprise, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Enterprise.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Enterprise according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Enterprise is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Enterprise and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSaint George Municipal Airport (KSGU, 34%, 33 mi, south, -2,382 ft elevation change)\n\nCedar City Regional Airport (KCDC, 66%, 35 mi, east, 269 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Enterprise and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
