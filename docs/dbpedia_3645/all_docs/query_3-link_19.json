        "text": "Air Quality Awareness Week 2019 is this week, April 29 – May 3. The following blog takes a look at the many pollutants that affect Utah’s air and is a re-post from May 2018.\n\nBy Bo Call\n\nUtah’s Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Air Quality often hears from residents who want to know more about Utah’s air quality, the pollutants, the causes, and what they can do to help reduce their emissions. Our scientists and engineers, through legislative funded air quality research and partnerships with state and federal agencies are learning more every day about the complex chemistry that creates our state’s unique air quality challenges. Here is a quick overview of the chemicals we look for when monitoring the air and the sources of these pollutants.\n\nWhat is Utah doing?\n\nUtah has taken extraordinary steps to improve air quality. Below is a listing of just a few of the recent steps taken to clear up Utah’s air.\n\nLarge industry in Utah has reduced emissions by 47 percent since 1995 as a result of state and federal requirements.\n\nThe State has enacted 30 new rules that reduce emissions from the area sources. As an example, one of those regulations requires that consumer products sold in Utah be formulated to reduce VOCs. This step will remove 2,000 tons of pollutants from our air annually.\n\nUtah is experiencing a solar energy boom, adding approximately 800 MW of utility-scale solar capacity since 2014. Demand for residential rooftop solar is also growing rapidly. State incentives—the Renewable Energy Systems Tax Credit and the Alternative Energy Development Incentive—have spurred this growth.\n\nDEQ’s Division of Air Quality scientists have conducted or overseen many research projects to understand the Utah-specific chemical reactions that form pollution and identify effective control technologies to reduce that pollution.\n\nIn 2016, the Legislature passed a bill requiring that, starting in 2018, new water heaters sold in the state must include the latest technology (Ultra-low NOx), reducing NOx emissions by 75 percent compared to conventional water heaters.\n\nGovernor Herbert is using all available tools to encourage Utah refineries to produce the cleaner Tier 3 fuel. Federal Tier 3 fuel and vehicle standards are projected to cut emissions from cars and trucks in half. Model 2017 vehicles meet the Tier 3 vehicle standards.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nConserve energy – remember to turn off lights, computers, and other appliances.\n\nGet in the habit of setting your thermostat a few degrees warmer in the summer and a few degrees cooler in the winter.\n\nUse energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.\n\nLimit driving and practice TravelWise strategies like carpooling, public transit, biking and walking.\n\nCombine errands for fewer trips.\n\nKeep your automobile well maintained. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations on routine maintenance and check tire pressure and wheel alignment.\n\nAvoid idling your automobile.\n\nUse electric or hand-powered lawn tools.\n\nUse a modern gas can to limit emitting fumes and spilling gasoline.\n\nRun dishwashers and clothes washers only when full.\n\nChoose environmentally responsible home cleaners.\n\nTo learn more about the ways you can reduce emissions and help improve Utah’s air quality, visit www.ucair.org.\n\nI have been with the Division of Air Quality (DAQ) for 25 years, managing the air monitoring section since 2009. Prior to that I worked in DAQ’s compliance branch and conducted source inspections, specializing in asbestos rules and enforcement.I have a BA in Biology from Utah State University. I am a retired member of the Air Force Reserve as a Transportation Specialist. On my own time, I have a hobby farm and recently entered into the realm of beekeeping."
