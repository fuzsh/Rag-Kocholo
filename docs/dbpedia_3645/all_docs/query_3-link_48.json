        "text": "Utah Property Taxes\n\nResidential properties that are the primary residence of the homeowner in Utah receive a property tax exemption of 45%. That means only 55% of a home’s value is subject to taxation. That exemption keeps property taxes for most homeowners quite low. In turn, Utah’s average effective property tax rate is 0.5 8%, eventh11th-lowest in the U.S.\n\nIf low property taxes sound enticing, or you're considering refinancing a property in Utah, our Utah mortgage guide provides homebuying information specific to the Utah housing market.\n\nA financial advisor can help you understand how homeownership fits into your overall financial goals. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nHow the Utah Property Tax Works\n\nProperty taxes in Utah are largely handled at the county level. The state sets certain guidelines and assists counties with administering the property tax, but counties are responsible for the appraisal of property and the calculation of tax rates.\n\nThe first step in Utah’s property tax system is the valuation of property. By state law, county assessors are required to physical inspect and appraise all property within their county at least once every five years. The purpose of this appraisal is to calculate full market value. Between appraisals, that market value is adjusted based on sales data and other factors.\n\nResidential property in Utah receives a 45% property tax exemption. Thus, if the market value of your home is $100,000, the taxable value is just $55,000. Your local tax rates apply to that taxable value.\n\nUtah Property Tax Rates\n\nThere are more than 1,000 different property tax areas in Utah, each with a separate rate. These areas are a product of the fact that counties, cities, school districts and water districts can all levy property taxes.\n\nThe total of the rate between all the applicable tax authorities is the rate that homeowners pay. Utah expresses tax rates as a percentage of taxable value.\n\nWhen comparing between counties or states, it's useful to look at the effective property tax rate. This is the median amount paid annually as a percentage of median home value. The table below shows median home value, median annual property taxes and the average effective tax rate for every county in Utah.\n\nLooking to calculate your potential monthly mortgage payment?

It also contains the state’s largest city, Salt Lake City, which it's also named after. The county’s average effective tax rate is 0.75%, third-highest in the state.\n\nAccording to the Salt Lake County website, there are more than 360 separate tax districts in Salt Lake County. Total tax rates in those districts range from about 1.01% to 1.73%. For residential property, assessed value is equal to 55% of market value.\n\nIf you have questions about how property taxes can affect your overall financial plans, a financial advisor in Salt Lake City can help you out.\n\nUtah County\n\nUtah County is located directly south of Salt Lake County in central Utah and is the state’s second-largest county by population. Its largest city is Provo. The median annual property tax paid by homeowners in Utah County is $1,991. That is the sixth-highest figure among Utah counties, and it's almost $1,000 less than the national median.\n\nDavis County\n\nSituated along the eastern bank of the Great Salt Lake, Davis County has property tax rates somewhat higher than the state average, but lower than the rates in nearby Salt Lake County. The average effective tax rate in Davis County is 0.72%. At that rate, the taxes on a home worth $200,000 would be about $1,500 annually.\n\nWeber County\n\nWeber County is the fourth-largest county in Utah, with a population of about 267,000. The largest city in the county is Ogden. On average, Weber County has the second-highest property tax rates in Utah. The county’s average effective rate is 0.87%, second only to San Juan County, which has a rate of 1.02%.\n\nWashington County\n\nWashington County is located in the southwest corner of Utah, along the state borders with Nevada and Arizona. It is named after the first U.S. president, George Washington. It also contains large portions of Zion National Park and the Red Cliffs Conservation Area. The median annual property tax paid by homeowners in Washington County is $1,878, eighth-highest in the state.\n\nCache County\n\nThis northeast Utah county has property tax rates somewhat higher than the state average. The county’s average effective rate is 0.67%, which is above the state average of 0.52%. In Logan, which is the county’s largest city, the total rate is 1.1728%.\n\nTooele County\n\nTooele County stretches from the Nevada border to the southeast corner of the Great Salt Lake. There are around 40 different tax districts in Tooele County. The county's average effective rate is 0.87%, which is well above the state rate.\n\nBox Elder County\n\nThe ninth-most populous county in Utah, Box Elder County is named for the tree species that is so common in the county. The average effective property tax rate in Box Elder County is 0.59%, 10th-highest in the state. A homeowner paying that rate on a home worth $150,000 would pay about $885 annually.\n\nIron County\n\nIron County is located in southwest Utah, along the border with Nevada. The largest city in Iron County is Cedar City. The county contains about 30 tax districts, but much of the county is unincorporated. Iron County’s average effective property tax rate is 0.53%, which ranks slightly above the state average.\n\nSummit County\n\nSummit County is in northeast Utah. Its largest city is Park City, which houses thousands of tourists during ski season, thanks to its proximity to Salt Lake City. The median annual property tax payment in the county is $2,696, highest in the state.\n\nThe main reason taxes are so high in Summit County is that home values are also the highest in the state. The median home value in Summit County is $678,500. Another factor in regards to these high taxes is that a significant share of the residential property in Summit County, which is home to several of the nation’s top ski resorts, is not owner-occupied and does not qualify for the homeowner’s exemption."
