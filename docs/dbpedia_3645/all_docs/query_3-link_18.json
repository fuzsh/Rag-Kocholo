        "text": "Reasons to move to Utah\n\nMany people will only consider the benefits when deciding whether to move or not. This is a mistake. Always weight both the pros & cons. Yes, there are reasons to move to Utah so many California residents believe Utah to be one of the best places to relocate, such as great weather and climate, low monthly rent, and low cost of living. But like any other place, there are some disadvantages as well. The reason Americans move from california to utah is mostly high prices for services and taxes, while in Utah the standard of living is no less high, but its cost is an order of magnitude lower.\n\n1. Cost of living\n\nThe main positive feature of Utah state is a lower cost of living. It is one of the most affordable states in the US that guarantees a high standard of living to everyone. This is achieved by comparatively low prices and high income, so every person living here can use the best amenities characteristic of the largest cities but for half of their price.\n\nIt is natural that homes in Salt Lake City metropolitan area are more expensive than around the state in general, but still, utilities, groceries, rental prices are even lower than around the country.\n\n2. Home prices\n\nNaturally, the median home price in Utah is higher than around the US: compare $302,000 and $216,200. However, a huge role in this price is played by homes located in Salt Lake City (homes are 90% more expensive there than in average around the US). It means, that living in the residential area is very affordable and almost every working family can obtain a home there.\n\nRental prices are similar to the national average ones. You need about $1,000 to live in the 1-bedroom apartment and double this amount to rent a 4-bedroom flat in the metro area. In other counties, rental prices are twice lower.\n\n3. Climate\n\nUtah living is a perfect choice in regard to climate, as local residents can feel all the features of the dry continental climate. They enjoy summer warmth and reasonably cold winters. There is rather low precipitation and the temperature rarely goes in its extremes. Any cold winds and waves are blocked by the mountains, so the average yearly temperature is about 52Â° F. Considering the conditions for living in Utah, anyone who is at the stage of choosing a state for moving should decide for themselves which climate is most suitable for living, because in Utah it is deserted, which means it may not be suitable for people with respiratory diseases and unstable pressure.\n\n4. Safety\n\nYou can hardly find another state in the US that can boast such a high level of safety as Utah does. The biggest number of crimes takes place in Salt Lake City, and it makes the average crime rate in Utah be a bit higher than the national one. These are mainly property crimes, while violent crimes are 36% lower than on average around the country. However, the biggest part smaller cities and towns in Utah can boast 80% lower crime rate than the average one around the state and it is a decent proof of the high level of safety there. One more fact that speaks louder than words is a strong religious background that minimizes the possibility to become a victim of any crime. In 2016, Utah was ranked the 9th safest state in the US too.\n\n5. Excellent education\n\nUtah can be proud of schools located there, as they attract thousands of students to this state. You can find many decent higher-learning institutions there, but it's impossible not to mention Salt Lake Community College (the second best community college in the country), Westminster University (22nd place in the national rating), and two more institutions from top 50 of the best national ones - Brigham Young University and University of Utah.\n\n6. Entertainment and recreation\n\nMost of the state area is covered with mountains and it opens a diversity of opportunities to enjoy outdoor activities. Unbelievable scenery, beautiful rivers, and lakes with crystal water, fresh air contribute to such great activities as cycling, hiking, climbing, scuba diving, backpacking, horse riding, and even skiing etc. There are 5 National Parks popular with tourists as well as multiple annual festivals that guarantee unforgettable nightlife.\n\n7. Stable economic growth and employment opportunities\n\nUtah can be a perfect place to look for a job or start your own business. There is a very low unemployment rate - about 2.9%. Moreover, there has been a 70% increase in the number of high-technology jobs for a couple of previous years. Salt Lake City is regarded to be one of the best city to start a career and build your own small business. Utah has also had the fastest-growing labor force since 2010 and it is a key element in the overall state economic growth. In 2014, for example, it was the best overall performing state in economic growth and it does not leave its leading positions now too.\n\n8. Young and smart local residents\n\nUtah attracts many people by the possibility to live among the young population. It is the state with the youngest population in the US - the median age is 30.5 years only. Moreover, most of the people living here are educated. Over 90% of students successfully graduate from high school. 30% of graduates enter higher educational institutions to get degrees.\n\n9. Good traffic and transportation\n\nUtah is one of few states that can offer its residents an upgraded highway system. The state is interconnected and can be easily traversed. Salt Lake International Airport is the largest Delta Hub in the west, while a constantly growing light rail system can take you in any direction. You will appreciate an award-winning bus system and FrontRunner commuter rail too.\n\n10. Equality\n\nPeople living in Utah have a very high level of well being and it is more than in all the US cities. Salt Lake City has been ranked the second friendly list city in the country, while all people feel equal in this state. No wonder there is the largest LGBT community here too. Moreover, Utahns are the most generous people in the country. Most of them admitted donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers.\n\nAlso, the best of Utah is religiosity and freedom of religion. The fact is that this state is the most religious in the United States. To be more precise, 60 percent of the inhabitants are Mormons (members of the Church of Jesus Christ). Everyone who lives in or just moved has in Utah the right to know that he has the right to remain in Christianity or other religion or change it (purely by will). By law, each person can profess the faith he wants, the same principle applies to moving, for example, any citizen of the country can safely move from Utah to California and start a new life.\n\n11. Very experienced movers\n\nIf necessary, local movers will do an excellent job with the delivery of goods, they will bring everything at the time agreed with the client, without delay. At the same time, they know the map of the Utah area and will deliver the goods in integrity and safety. Even if you plan on moving to Utah from California, you can contact local movers. After all, they will make your moving to Utah as convenient and comfortable as possible.\n\nTo eliminate any doubt, the question of whether is utah a good place to live can be answered positively with confidence, because this state offers good conditions for life and professional development.\n\nMoving to Utah\n\nSince Utah is located near the rain shadow region of one of the famous ridges called the Sierra Nevada, absolutely everyone should consider before moving whether the desert, semi-arid climate that reigns in absolutely the entire part of the state is suitable for him. After all, Utah weather year round is not constant, it changes in winter and summer periods, in winter the temperature reaches minus 10 degrees Celsius, and in summer the thermometer value rises to plus 24 degrees Celsius, precipitation is observed from time to time.\n\nAre you thinking of moving from California to Utah? Or do you know anyone who is planning to relocate to Utah? In fact, there are several ways to do that depending on the volume of belongings you have and the number of people moving.\n\nNaturally, the most comfortable way is to turn to the professional moving company such as California Movers and deliver everything in the perfect state to your new home. We are a full-service company, we carry out long-distance or local moving and deal with all the challenges connected with relocation, so our trained and careful movers are worth your trust.\n\nHowever, if you are going to move alone, there are several ways to arrive in Utah from any neighboring state. It goes without saying, the fastest but the most expensive way is a plane. If you own a car or like going by bus, there are excellent highways to take you to the new place of living, while people who prefer railroad can catch a train too.\n\nMoving out of state with your employerâs support can help you cover some of the costs of moving. Large corporations and other employers with financial resources are more likely to help prospective and new employees move across state lines.\n\nMoving to Utah without a job lined up is not ideal, but donât let not having a job stop you from moving to Utah. Obtaining employment as soon as you arrive in Utah is the best way to begin paying off expenses associated with moving. It is advisable to save enough money to cover at least three months of moving expenses. The expenses you accrue from moving should be saved should be paid for out of a separate moving fund. Budgeting your moving expenses will help you reduce some of the stress caused by moving to another state. If you have to live in a smaller apartment before moving into a larger space then consider spending less on housing until you can get established in your new state.\n\nOne of the best things you can do before moving to Utah is create a moving binder that contains a moving checklist, any important records, and a moving budget. These items will be important during your move and you will need to have easy access to medical records and school records when you arrive in Utah. If you have children you will need to make sure you have their immunization records updated before they can enroll in public or private schools.\n\nTherefore, one thing should be remembered that when asking what to do in Utah, you should carefully read the information about what the state generally offers for new immigrants, companies, and tourists."
