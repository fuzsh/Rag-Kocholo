        "text": "There are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas (AIANNHAs) for which the Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state-recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations, and Hawaiian home lands. The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas, Oklahoma tribal statistical areas, tribal designated statistical areas, and state designated tribal statistical areas. Statistical tribal subdivisions can exist within Oklahoma tribal statistical areas. In all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no AIANNHA can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which by definition subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas, which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations. In cases where more than one tribe claims jurisdiction over an area, the Census Bureau creates a joint-use area as a separate entity to define this area of dual claims. The following provides more detail about each of the various AIANNHAs.\n\nLegal Entities\n\nAlaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) were created pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (Pub. L. 92–203, 85 Stat. 688 [1971]; 43 U.S.C. 1602 et seq. [2000]), enacted in 1971 as a ‘‘Regional Corporation’’ and organized under the laws of the State of Alaska to conduct both the for-profit and nonprofit affairs of Alaska Natives within a defined region of Alaska. For the Census Bureau, ANRCs are considered legal geographic entities. Twelve ANRCs cover the entire State of Alaska except for the area within the Annette Island Reserve (a federally recognized American Indian reservation under the governmental authority of the Metlakatla Indian Community). The Census Bureau offers representatives of the 12 nonprofit ANRCs (also known as Alaska Native Regional Associations [ANRAs]) in Alaska the opportunity to review and update the ANRC boundaries before each decennial census. Each ANRC is assigned a five-digit numeric Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nAmerican Indian reservations—Federal (federal AIRs) are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains a list of all federally recognized tribal governments and makes final determination of the inventory of federal AIRs. Federal reservations (and associated off-reservation trust lands) are territory over which American Indian tribes have governmental authority. American Indian reservations can be legally described as colonies, communities, Indian colonies, Indian communities, Indian rancherias, Indian reservations, Indian villages, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, settlements, or villages. The Census Bureau contacts representatives of federally recognized American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations through its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). Federal reservations may cross state and all other area boundaries within the United States.\n\nEach federal AIR is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 0001 through 4799 in alphabetical order of AIR names nationwide. This nation-based census code is the primary unique identifier for the AIR. Each federal AIR also is assigned five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. Because FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence within each state, the FIPS codes are different in each state for reservations that include territory in more than one state.\n\nAmerican Indian reservations—State (state AIRs) are reservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations to the Census Bureau. State reservations must be defined within a single state, but may cross county and other types of boundaries. Each state AIR is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 9000 through 9499. Each state AIR also is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. To further identify and differentiate state-recognized American Indian areas from those that are federally recognized, the text “(state)” is appended to the AIR name.\n\nAmerican Indian tribal subdivisions, described as additions, administrative areas, areas, chapters, county districts, communities, districts, or segments, are legal administrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands or are statistical subdivisions of Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. Each American Indian tribal subdivision is assigned a three-digit census code that is alphabetically in order and unique within each American Indian area, a five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code assigned alphabetically within state, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. Because FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence within each state, the FIPS codes are different in each state for tribal subdivisions that include territory in more than one state. Not all reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and OTSAs have tribal subdivisions. All summary levels that include tribal subdivisions in the presentation hierarchy only have records for the American Indian areas and OTSAs that actually have tribal subdivisions.\n\nHawaiian home lands (HHLs) are areas held in trust for Native Hawaiians by the State of Hawaii, pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended. The Census Bureau obtains the names and boundaries for HHLs from state officials. The names of the home lands are based on the traditional ahupua‘a names of the Crown and government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii from which the lands were designated or from the local name for an area. Being lands held in trust, HHLs are treated as equivalent to off-reservation trust land areas with the American Indian Trust Land/Hawaiian Home Land Indicator coded as “T.” Each HHL is assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 5000 through 5499 based on the alphabetical sequence of each HHL name, a five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within the State of Hawaii, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nJoint-use areas, as applied to any American Indian area by the Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates legal joint-use areas as unique geographic entities equivalent to a reservation for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Each is assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 4800 through 4999 based on the alphabetical sequence of each joint-use area name, a five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within state, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. No joint-use areas exist in multiple states.\n\nOff-reservation trust lands are areas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual American Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation; however, the Census Bureau tabulates data only for off-reservation trust lands, with the off-reservation trust lands always associated with a specific federally recognized reservation or tribal government. The Census Bureau also does not distinguish between tribal and individual trust lands. As for federally recognized reservations, the Census Bureau obtains the boundaries of off-reservation trust lands from American Indian tribal governments through its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have governmental authority over these lands. The Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic areas.\n\nOff-reservation trust lands are assigned a four-digit census code, a five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code that is the same as that for the reservation, if any, with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned unique codes. The census code is assigned by tribal name within the range 0001 through 4799, interspersed alphabetically among the reservation names. Because FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence within each state, the FIPS codes are different in each state for off-reservation trust lands that include territory in more than one state. In decennial census data tabulations, the American Indian Trust Land/Hawaiian home land Indicator uniquely identifies off-reservation trust lands, as well as reservation or statistical area only portions, Hawaiian home lands, and records that consist of the combination of reservation and off-reservation trust land.\n\nStatistical Entities\n\nAlaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) represent the more densely settled portion of Alaska Native villages (ANVs). The ANVs constitute associations, bands, clans, communities, groups, tribes, or villages recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-203). Because ANVs do not always have clear, legally defined boundaries or boundaries that include most of the population and housing associated with the ANV, the Census Bureau does not delimit ANVs. Instead, the Census Bureau presents statistical data for ANVSAs that represent the settled portion of ANVs. In addition, each ANVSA should include only an area where Alaska Natives, especially members of the defining ANV, represent a substantial proportion of the population during at least one season of the year. ANVSAs are delineated or reviewed by officials of the ANV or, if no ANV official chose to participate in the delineation process, officials of the Alaska Native Regional Corporation (ANRC) in which the ANV is located. An ANVSA may not overlap the boundary of another ANVSA or an American Indian reservation. Each ANVSA is alphabetically assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 6000 through 7999, an alphabetically assigned state-based five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nOklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) are statistical entities identified and delineated by the Census Bureau in consultation with federally recognized American Indian tribes that had a former reservation in Oklahoma. The boundary of an OTSA is intended to be that of the former reservation in Oklahoma, except where modified by agreements with neighboring tribes only for statistical data presentation purposes. Each OTSA is alphabetically assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 5500 through 5899, an alphabetically assigned state-based five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code. Tribal subdivisions are allowed within OTSAs.\n\nOklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA) Joint-Use Areas, as applied to OTSAs by the Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes that have a delineated OTSA. The Census Bureau designates statistical joint-use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Only OTSAs have statistical joint-use areas. Each Oklahoma tribal joint-use area is alphabetically assigned a national four-digit census code ranging from 5900 through 5999, an alphabetically assigned state-based five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nState designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs) are statistical entities for state-recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a state-recognized land base (reservation). SDTSAs are identified and delineated for the Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the governor’s office in each state. SDTSAs generally encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a state-recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A SDTSA may not be located in more than one state and it may not include area within any other American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian area. Each SDTSA is alphabetically assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 9500 through 9998, an alphabetically assigned state-based five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nTribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs) are statistical entities identified and delineated for the Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within any other American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian area. Each TDSA is alphabetically assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 8000 through 8999, an alphabetically assigned state-based five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nAmerican Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Area (AIANNHA) Codes—AIANNHAs are represented in Census Bureau products using a national four-character numeric census code field and a single alphabetic character American Indian Trust Land/Hawaiian Home Land Indicator field. The census codes are assigned in alphabetical order in assigned ranges by AIANNHA type nationwide, except that joint-use areas appear at the end of the code range. Off-reservation trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) codes for all AIANNHAs range from 00001 through 89999, without differentiation among the many types of areas.\n\nThe type of AIANNHA can be identified either by the census code or by the FIPS class code. The range of census codes allocated to each AIANNHA and the valid FIPS class code(s) associated with each are as follows:\n\nAIANNHA type Census Code Range Valid FIPS class code(s)* Federal American Indian Reservation (AIR)/Off-Reservation Trust Land 0001 to 4799 D1, D2, D3, D5, D8 Joint-Use Federal AIR 4800 to 4999 D0 Hawaiian Home Land 5000 to 5499 F1 Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA) 5500 to 5899 D6 Joint-use OTSA 5900 to 5999 D0 Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA) 6000 to 7999 E1 Tribal designated statistical area (TDSA) 8000 to 8999 D6 State AIR 9000 to 9499 D4 State designated tribal statistical area (SDTSA) 9500 to 9998 D9\n\n* Refer to the Data Dictionary for specific value descriptions.\n\nAIANNHA Type American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian Area Indicator American Indian Reservation including associated Off-Reservation Trust Land M American Indian Reservation or Statistical Entity only R Off-reservation trust land only T Hawaiian home land T\n\nCore Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) consist of the county or counties or equivalent entities associated with at least one core (Census Bureau-defined Urban Area) of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured through commuting ties with the counties associated with the core. The general concept of a CBSA is that of a core area containing a substantial population nucleus, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. The term “core based statistical area” refers collectively to metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines CBSAs to provide a nationally consistent, standard set of geographic entities for the United States and Puerto Rico for use in tabulating and presenting statistical data. Statistical areas related to CBSAs include metropolitan divisions, combined statistical areas (CSAs), New England city and town areas (NECTAs), NECTA divisions, and combined NECTAs.\n\nCombined New England City and Town Areas (Combined NECTAs) consist of two or more adjacent New England city and town areas (NECTAs) that have substantial employment interchange. The NECTAs that combine to create a combined NECTA retain separate identities within the larger combined NECTA. Because combined NECTAs represent groupings of NECTAs, they should not be ranked or compared with individual NECTAs.\n\nCombined Statistical Areas (CSAs) consist of two or more adjacent core based statistical areas (CBSAs) that have substantial employment interchange. The CBSAs that combine to create a CSA retain separate identities within the larger CSA. Because CSAs represent groupings of metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas, they should not be ranked or compared with individual metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.\n\nMetropolitan Divisions are smaller groupings of counties or equivalent entities defined within a metropolitan statistical area containing a single core with a population of at least 2.5 million. Not all metropolitan statistical areas with Urban Areas of this size contain metropolitan divisions. A metropolitan division consists of one or more main/secondary counties that represent an employment center or centers, plus adjacent counties associated with the main/secondary county or counties through commuting ties. Because metropolitan divisions represent subdivisions of larger metropolitan statistical areas, it is not appropriate to rank or compare metropolitan divisions with metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. It would be appropriate to rank and compare metropolitan divisions.\n\nMetropolitan Statistical Areas are core based statistical areas (CBSAs) associated with at least one Urban Area that has a population of at least 50,000. The metropolitan statistical area comprises the central county or counties or equivalent entities containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county or counties as measured through commuting.\n\nMicropolitan Statistical Areas are core based statistical areas (CBSAs) associated with at least one Urban Area that has a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000. The micropolitan statistical area comprises the central county or counties or equivalent entities containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county or counties as measured through commuting.\n\nNew England City and Town Areas (NECTAs) are an alternative set of geographic entities, similar in concept to the county-based core based statistical areas (CBSAs) defined nationwide, that U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines in New England based on county subdivisions—usually cities and towns. NECTAs are defined using the same criteria as county-based CBSAs, and, similar to CBSAs, NECTAs are categorized as metropolitan or micropolitan.\n\nNew England City and Town Area (NECTA) Divisions are smaller groupings of cities and towns defined within a NECTA containing a single core with a population of at least 2.5 million. A NECTA division consists of a main city or town that represents an employment center, plus adjacent cities and towns associated with the main city or town through commuting ties. Each NECTA division must contain a total population of 100,000 or more. Because NECTA divisions represent subdivisions of larger NECTAs, it is not appropriate to rank or compare NECTA divisions with NECTAs. It would be appropriate to rank and compare NECTA divisions.\n\nPrincipal Cities of a core based statistical area (CBSA) or New England City and Town Area (NECTA) include the largest incorporated place with a population of at least 10,000 in the CBSA, or if no incorporated place of at least 10,000 population is present in the CBSA, the largest incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) in the CBSA. Principal cities also include any additional incorporated place or CDP with a population of at least 250,000 or in which 100,000 or more persons work; any additional incorporated place or CDP with a population of at least 50,000 and in which the number of jobs meets or exceeds the number of employed residents; and any additional incorporated place or CDP with a population of at least 10,000, but less than 50,000 and at least one-third the population size of the largest place and in which the number of jobs meets or exceeds the number of employed residents. Note that there are some places designated as principal cities of NECTAs that are not principal cities of a CBSA.\n\nCore Based Statistical Area Codes—Metropolitan statistical areas, micropolitan statistical areas, New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs), metropolitan divisions, and NECTA divisions are identified using a five-digit numeric code that is assigned alphabetically based on title and is unique within the nation. The combined statistical areas and combined NECTAs are identified using a three-digit numeric code, also assigned alphabetically based on title and unique within the nation. Codes, length, and ranges are:\n\nCBSA entity Length Range* Metropolitan statistical area Five digits 10000–49999 Micropolitan statistical area Five digits 10000–49999 Metropolitan division Five digits 10004–49994 New England city and town area (NECTA) Five digits 70000–79999 NECTA division Five digits 70004–79994 Combined statistical area Three digits 100–599 Combined NECTA Three digits 700–799\n\n* Metropolitan divisions and NECTA divisions are distinguished from metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas and NECTAs by codes that end in \"4.\" Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas and NECTAs cannot end in \"4.\"\n\nThe Island Areas of the United States are the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern Mariana Islands), and the United States Virgin Islands. The Census Bureau treats the Island Areas as entities that are statistically equivalent to states for data presentation purposes; data for the Island Areas, however, are presented separately from data for the United States and Puerto Rico. Geographic definitions specific to the Island Areas are shown in the appropriate publications and documentation that accompany the data products for the Island Areas. Sometimes the Island Areas are referred to as “Island Territories” or “Insular Areas.” Separate from the Island Areas is the term “United States Minor Outlying Islands.” The U.S. Minor Outlying Islands refers to certain small islands that are U.S. Territories under U.S. jurisdiction in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island. These areas usually are not part of standard data products, because they generally do not include population year-round.\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\nThe Census Bureau treats American Samoa as the statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes.\n\nDistricts and Islands (county equivalents)—The primary legal subdivisions of American Samoa are districts and islands. For data presentation purposes, the Census Bureau treats districts and islands as the equivalent of counties in the United States. American Samoa contains three districts (Eastern, Western, and Manu’a) and two islands that are not within districts (Swains and Rose).\n\nEastern District includes the eastern half of Tutuila Island, Aunuu (Aunu’u) Island, Nuusetoga Island, Pola Island, Avagatatau Rock, Fatutoaga Rock, Tauga Rock, Manofa Rock, and Nuuosina Rock.\n\nWestern District includes the western half of Tutuila Island, Taputapu Island, Toatai Rock, Niuolepava Rock, Utumatuu Rock, Liuvaatoga Rock, Luania Rocks, Manuelo Rock, and Nuutavana Rock.\n\nManu’a District includes Ofu Island, Nuutele Island, Nuusilaelae Island, Nuupule Rock, Olosega Island, and Ta’ū (Ta’u or Tau) Island. “Rose Island” also includes Sand Island. Counties (county subdivisions)—The Census Bureau recognizes counties as the legal subdivisions of the districts and islands in American Samoa. These entities are minor civil divisions (MCDs). Counties and two unnamed county subdivisions, one each covering Swains Island and Rose Island, cover the entire area of American Samoa. Villages (places)—The Census Bureau treats villages in American Samoa as incorporated places. Village boundaries are determined by land usership and land ownership rather than by fixed legal descriptions. Villages cover the entire area of American Samoa except for Rose Island.\n\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\n\nThe Census Bureau treats the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) as the statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes.\n\nMunicipalities (county equivalents)—The primary legal subdivisions of the CNMI are municipalities. For data presentation purposes, the Census Bureau treats municipalities as the equivalent of counties in the United States. The CNMI contains four municipalities: Northern Islands, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian.\n\nRota Municipality includes Rota Island and Angyuta Island.\n\nSaipan Municipality includes Saipan Island, Isleta Managaha, Isleta Maigo Luao (Forbidden Island), and Isleta Maigo Fahang (Bird Island).\n\nTinian Municipality includes Tinian Island, Aguijan Island, and Naftan Rock.\n\nNorthern Islands Municipality includes Farallon de Medinilla, Anatahan Island, Sarigan Island, Guguan Island, Alamagan Island, Pagan Island, Hira Rock, Togari Rock, Agrihan Island, Asuncion Island, Maug Islands (East Island (Higashi), North Island (Kita), and West Island (Nishi)), and Farallon de Pajaros (Uracus Island).\n\nElection Districts (county subdivisions)—The Census Bureau recognizes election districts as the legal subdivisions of the municipalities in the CNMI. These entities are minor civil divisions (MCDs). Election districts cover the land area of the CNMI, and four other county subdivisions (one for each municipality) are coded 00000 and cover the territorial water area of the CNMI where no legal MCDs exist.\n\nVillages (places)—The Census Bureau treats villages in the CNMI as incorporated places for the 2020 Census. The villages reflect boundaries and names provided by the CNMI Central Statistics Division and used in their own surveys and products.\n\nGuam\n\nThe Census Bureau treats Guam as the statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes. The entire area of Guam also serves as a single county equivalent for decennial census data presentation purposes. Guam also includes Cocos Island, Babe Island, Tangon Rock, Fofos Island, Asgadao Island, Agrigan Island, Guijen Rock, Asgon Rock, Alupat Island, Camel Rock, Cabras Island, Dry Dock Island, Orote Island, Neye Island, Pelagi Islets, Alutom Island, Yona Island, Bangi Island, Anae Island, Facpi Island, and Lalas Rock.\n\nMunicipalities (county subdivisions)—The Census Bureau recognizes municipalities as the legal subdivisions of Guam. These entities are minor civil divisions (MCDs). Municipalities cover the entire land area of Guam. There is one county subdivision coded 00000 that covers the territorial water area of Guam where no legal MCDs exist.\n\nCensus Designated Places (CDPs) (places)—The Census Bureau treats traditional villages and other types of locally recognized communities in Guam as CDPs. CDPs do not cover the entire land area of Guam.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\nThe Census Bureau treats the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) as the statistical equivalent of a state for data presentation purposes.\n\nIslands (county equivalents)—The primary legal subdivisions of the USVI are islands. For data presentation purposes, the Census Bureau treats islands as the equivalent of counties in the United States. The USVI contains three islands: St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas.\n\nSt. Croix Island also includes Protestant Cay, Green Cay, Buck Island, Ruth Island, and Whitehorse Rock.\n\nSt. John Island also includes Grass Cay, Mingo Cay, Lovango Cay, Congo Cay, Carval Rock, Blunder Rocks, Murder Rock, Durloe Cays (Henley Cay, Ramgoat Cay, and Rata Cay), Hawksnest Rock, Perkins Cay, Trunk Cay, Cinnamon Cay, Whistling Cay, Waterlemon Cay, Flanagan Island, Pelican Rock, Blinders Rock, Leduck Island, Booby Rock, Cocoloba Cay, Mingo Rock, Skipper Jacob Rock, Steven Cay, and Two Brothers.\n\nSt. Thomas Island also includes Water Island, Hassel Island, Elephant Rock, Limestone Rock, Sprat Rock, Flamingo Rock, Porpoise Rocks, Flat Cays (Flat Cay and Little Flat Cay), Turtledove Cay, Saba Island, Dry Rock, Sail Rock, Saltwater Money Rock, Mermaids Chair, Kalkun Cay, Chacha Rocks, Savana Island, Domkirk Rock, Tip Rock, Drum Rock, West Cay, Salt Cay, Dutchcap Cay, Gorret Rock, Cockroach Island, Sula Cay, Cricket Rock, Lizard Rocks, Brass Islands (Inner Brass Island, Outer Brass Island, and Grasklip Point Island), Hans Lollik Island, Hans Lollik Rock, Little Hans Lollik Island, Pelican Cay, Steep Rock, Thatch Cay, Lee Rock, Turtleback Rock, Shark Island, Great Saint James Island, Current Rocks, Welk Rocks, Little Saint James Island, Dog Island, Dog Rocks, Fish Cay, The Stragglers, Calf Rock, Cow Rock, Coculus Rock, Grassy Cay, Rotto Cay, Bovoni Cay, Patricia Cay, Frenchcap Cay, Capella Islands (Buck Island, Broken Island, and Kid Rock), Green Cay, and Triangle Island.\n\nCensus Subdistricts (county subdivisions)—The Census Bureau recognizes census subdistricts as the legal subdivisions of the islands in the USVI. These entities are minor civil divisions (MCDs). Census subdistricts cover the entire land area of the USVI. There are three county subdivisions (one for each island) coded 00000 that cover the territorial water area of the USVI where no legal MCDs exist.\n\nEstates—The Census Bureau recognizes estates as another type of legal subdivision in the USVI. The estates reflect boundaries provided by the USVI Office of Lieutenant Governor. The boundaries of the estates are primarily those of the former agricultural plantations that existed at the time Denmark transferred the islands to the United States in 1917. Estates nest within islands, but do not always nest within the census subdistricts in the USVI. Estates also overlap with the places in the USVI. Estates cover most, but not all, of the land area of the USVI.\n\nTowns and Census Designated Places (places)—The Census Bureau treats towns in the USVI as incorporated places and treats other types of locally recognized communities without legally defined boundaries in the USVI as census designated places (CDPs). For the 2020 Census, three towns (Charlotte Amalie, Christiansted, and Frederiksted) and several CDPs exist in the USVI, but do not cover the entire land area.\n\nIncorporated Places are those reported to the Census Bureau as legally in existence as of January 1, as reported in the latest Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS), under the laws of their respective states. An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always are within a single state or equivalent entity, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. For Census Bureau data tabulation and presentation purposes, incorporated places exclude:\n\nBoroughs in Alaska (treated as statistical equivalents of counties).\n\nTowns in the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin (treated as MCDs).\n\nBoroughs in New York (treated as MCDs).\n\nCensus Designated Places (CDPs) are the statistical counterparts of incorporated places, and are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials and generally updated prior to each decennial census. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs, but they must include some residential population or housing.\n\nHawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam are the only states or state-equivalent entities that have no incorporated places recognized by the Census Bureau. All places shown in decennial census data products for Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam are CDPs. By agreement with the State of Hawaii, the Census Bureau does not show data separately for the city of Honolulu, which is coextensive with Honolulu County. In Puerto Rico, CDPs are described as comunidades or zonas urbanas. Hamlets, primarily in the State of New York, are usually represented as CDPs in Census Bureau products.\n\nPlace Codes are of two types. The five-digit Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) place code is assigned based on alphabetical sequence within a state. If place names are duplicated within a state and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by the primary county in which each place is located, or if both places are in the same county, they are assigned alphabetically by their legal descriptions (for example, “city” before “village”). Places also are assigned an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.\n\nDependent and Independent Places refer to the relationship of places to the county subdivisions. Depending on the state, incorporated places are either dependent within, or independent of, county subdivisions, or there is a mixture of dependent and independent places in the state and in a county. Dependent places are part of the county subdivision; the county subdivision code of the place is the same as that of the underlying county subdivision(s), but is different from the place code. Independent places are not part of any minor civil division (MCD) and serve as primary county subdivisions. The independent place Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code usually is the same as that used for the MCD for that place. The only exception is if the place is independent of the MCDs in a state (Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Virginia) in which the FIPS MCD codes are in the 90000 range. Then, the FIPS MCD and FIPS place codes do differ. Census designated places (CDPs) always are dependent within county subdivisions and all places are dependent within statistical county subdivisions.\n\nConsolidated City (Balance) Portions refer to the areas of a consolidated city not included in another separately incorporated place. For example, Butte-Silver Bow, MT, is a consolidated city (former Butte city and Silver Bow County) that includes the separately incorporated municipality of Walkerville city. The area of the consolidated city that is not in Walkerville city is assigned to Butte-Silver Bow (balance). The name of the area of a consolidated city not specifically within a separately incorporated place always includes the “(balance)” identifier. Balance portions of consolidated cities are included with other places in Census Bureau products."
