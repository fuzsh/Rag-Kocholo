Commercial nurseries, forestry, and aquaculture operations are eligible without these restrictions.\n\n(2) The annual renewal fee is currently 0.55% of the outstanding principal loan balance as of December 31. The renewal fee rate is set annually by Rural Development in a notice published in the Federal Register. The rate, in effect at the time the loan is made, will remain in effect for the life of the loan. Annual renewal fees are paid by the lender and due on January 31. Payments not received by April 1 are considered delinquent and, at the Agency’s discretion, may result in cancellation of the guarantee to the lender.\n\nHolders’ rights will continue in effect as specified in the loan note guarantee and assignment guarantee agreement. Any delinquent annual renewal fees will bear interest at the note rate and will be deducted from any loss payment due the lender. For loans where the loan note guarantee is issued between October 1 and December 31, the first annual renewal fee payment will be due January 31 of the second year following the date the loan note guarantee was issued.\n\nRural Development has implemented the OneRD Guarantee Loan Initiative program.
