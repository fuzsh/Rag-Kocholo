        "text": "Solar Energy Data for 84725\n\nSee the chart below to see how different types of solar panel installations compare in 84725.\n\n* Amounts listed in kWh/m2/day (kilowatt hours per square meter per day).\n\n* See glossary & definitions below.\n\nSolar Energy Analysis for 84725\n\nBased on historical 84725 data, solar panels that always track the sun throughout the day will produce the maximum solar energy output in 84725. [1]\n\nThe region associated with 84725 has an average monthly Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) of 5.44 kilowatt hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day), which is approximately 28% less than the average monthly Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) of 7.59 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nSolar installations in 84725 that are always titled at the latitude of Enterprise (Average Tilt at Latitude or ATaL) average 6.41 kWh/m2/day, or about 18% greater than the average monthly GHI of 5.44 kWh/m2/day and approximately 16% less than the average monthly DNI of 7.59 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nDirect Normal Irradiance (DNI)\n\nDirect Normal Irradiance: The total amount of solar radiation received per unit area by a surface that is always perpendicular to the sun rays that come in a straight line from the direction of the sun at its current position in the sky.\n\nSolar Radiation Analysis for 84725\n\nThe region associated with 84725 has a average annual solar radiation value of 6.31 kilowatt hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day). [1]\n\nThe month with the highest historical solar radition values in 84725 is September with an average of 7.28 kWh/m2/day, followed by August at 7.27 kWh/m2/day and June at 7.08 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nThe three months that historically average the lowest average solar radiation levels in 84725 are December with an average of 4.63 kWh/m2/day, followed by January with an average of 4.84 kWh/m2/day and February at 5.18 kWh/m2/day. [1]\n\nSolar Power Levels in 84725\n\nThe average monthly solar radiation level in 84725, of 6.31 kilowatt hours per square meter per day (kWh/m2/day) is approximately 61% greater than the average level of 3.93 kWh/m2/day in a city with historically low levels (WA) and is approximately 5% less than the average level of 6.61 kWh/m2/day in a city with historically high levels (NV). [1]\n\n→ Values listed as 0 (zero) are not available (N/A).\n\nSolar Power: 84725 vs. the U.S.\n\nBelow is a month-by-month comparison of how average 84725 solar radiation levels compare to average levels in a city with historcially high levels (NV) and a city with historically low levels (WA). [1]\n\n→ k/m/d = kWh/m2/day = kilowatt hours per square meter per day.\n\n→ Values listed as 0 (zero) are not available (N/A).\n\nSolar Output Analysis for 84725\n\n84725 has a average annual solar AC output value of 7106.97 kilowatt hours (AC). [2]\n\nThe month with the highest historical solar power output in 84725 is May with an average of 667.75 kWhac, followed by August at 661.56 kWhac and September at 653.95 kWhac. [2]\n\nThe three months that historically average the lowest average solar output levels in 84725 are February with an average of 464.88 kWhac, followed by December with an average of 466.81 kWhac and January at 482.92 kWhac.
