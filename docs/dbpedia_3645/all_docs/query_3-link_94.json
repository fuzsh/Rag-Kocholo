        "text": "Decoding the Income Tax Earmark: Proposed Changes to Utah’s Constitution\n\nOn the November 2024 ballot, voters will decide whether or not to amend the Utah Constitution to allow the use of income tax revenue for any public function, contingent on maintaining certain school funding provisions.\n\nDemographic Insight: Demographic Characteristics of Salt Lake City In-Migrants\n\nIn 2022, Salt Lake City attracted approximately 44,000 in-migrants. These new residents represent 21% of the city’s total population (204,653). This is much larger than the 3% statewide share of in-migrants.\n\nDemographic Insight: Utah’s California In-Migrants\n\nUtah’s largest source of domestic in-migrants come from California, surpassed only by international migrants. One of every five Utah in-migrants moved from California in the most recent data. California is currently the largest source of domestic migrants for many states besides Utah, but Utah and California have a lengthy migration relationship due to geographic and religious ties.\n\nHealth Insight: Medical Inflation – Where Are We Now?\n\nGiven concerns about overall economic inflation, it may be surprising to learn that medical inflation is slowing and is currently approaching some of the lowest levels in history. A look at medical inflation over the last 20 years highlights this slowed growth (Figure 2). Except for a significant increase from 2019-2020 (4.7%), medical inflation growth continued to slow over the past three years.\n\nDemographic Insight: New 2018-2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates Released\n\nLast week, the Census Bureau released the newest 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS). The American Community Survey explores more than 40 different topics and a few findings from the newest data include: 8 in 10 Utahns speak English at home, Utah boasts the 2nd lowest poverty level in the nation, and Utah’s foreign-born population did not grow."
