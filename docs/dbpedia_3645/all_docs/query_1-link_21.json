The county covers an area of approximately 2,430 square miles and is part of the St. George metropolitan area. Its county seat and largest city is St. George. The region is known for its stunning red rock landscapes, making it a popular destination for tourists, outdoor enthusiasts, and retirees.\n\nInhabited initially by Native American tribes such as the Anasazi and the Paiute, European settlement began in Washington County in the 1850s when Mormon pioneers, led by Brigham Young, arrived in the area. The pioneers were tasked with establishing cotton farms, which led to the nickname \"Dixie\" for the region, referencing the Southern states that were also known for cotton production.\n\nWashington County played a significant role in Utah's mining history during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with silver, lead, and copper mines dotting the area. However, the mining industry eventually declined, and the county shifted its focus towards tourism and outdoor recreation.\n\nOne fun fact about Washington County is the presence of Zion National Park, one of the nation's most popular and scenic national parks.
