        "text": "What Physical Therapists Do About this section\n\nPhysical therapists help injured or ill people improve movement and manage pain. They are often an important part of preventive care, rehabilitation, and treatment for patients with chronic conditions, illnesses, or injuries.\n\nDuties\n\nPhysical therapists typically do the following:\n\nReview patients’ medical history and referrals or notes from doctors, surgeons, or other healthcare workers\n\nDiagnose patients’ functions and movements by observing them stand or walk and by listening to their concerns\n\nDevelop individualized plans of care for patients, outlining the patients’ goals and the expected outcomes of the plans\n\nUse exercises, stretching maneuvers, hands-on therapy, and equipment to ease patients’ pain, help them increase their mobility, prevent further pain or injury, and facilitate health and wellness\n\nEvaluate and record a patients’ progress, modifying the plan of care and trying new treatments as needed\n\nEducate patients and their families about what to expect from the recovery process and how to cope with challenges throughout the process\n\nPhysical therapists, sometimes called PTs, care for people of all ages who have functional problems resulting from back and neck injuries; sprains, strains, and fractures; arthritis; amputations; neurological disorders, such as stroke or cerebral palsy; injuries related to work and sports; and other conditions.\n\nPhysical therapists use a variety of techniques to care for their patients. These techniques include exercises; training in functional movement, which may include the use of equipment such as canes, crutches, wheelchairs, and walkers; and special movements of joints, muscles, and other soft tissue to improve mobility and decrease pain.\n\nThe work of physical therapists varies by type of patient. For example, a patient working to recover mobility lost after a stroke needs care different from that of a patient recovering from a sports injury. Some physical therapists specialize in one type of care, such as orthopedics or geriatrics. Many physical therapists also help patients maintain or improve mobility by developing fitness and wellness programs that encourage healthy, active lifestyles.\n\nPhysical therapists work as part of a healthcare team, overseeing the work of physical therapist assistants and aides and consulting with physicians and surgeons and other specialists.\n\nHow to Become a Physical Therapist About this section\n\nPhysical therapists entering the occupation need a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree. All states require physical therapists to be licensed.\n\nEducation\n\nPhysical therapists need a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree from a program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE).\n\nDPT programs typically last 3 years. Physical therapy programs typically require a bachelor's degree, which may be in recreation and fitness or healthcare and related fields, and prerequisite courses such as anatomy, chemistry, and physics.\n\nMost DPT programs require candidates to apply through the Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service (PTCAS).\n\nPhysical therapist programs often include courses in biomechanics, neuroscience, and pharmacology. Physical therapist students also complete clinical work, during which they gain supervised experience in areas such as acute care and orthopedic care.\n\nPhysical therapists may apply to a clinical residency program after graduation. Residencies typically last about 1 year and provide additional training and experience in specialty areas of care. Physical therapists who have completed a residency program may choose to specialize further by participating in a fellowship in an advanced clinical area. The American Board of Physical Therapy Residency and Fellowship Education has directories of physical therapist residency and fellowship programs.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nAll states require physical therapists to be licensed, which includes passing the National Physical Therapy Examination administered by the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy. Other requirements vary by state. For example, some states also require a law exam and a criminal background check. Continuing education is typically required for physical therapists to keep their license. Check with your state board for specific licensing requirements.\n\nAfter gaining work experience, some physical therapists choose to become a board-certified specialist. The American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties offers certification in clinical specialty areas of physical therapy, such as orthopedics, sports, and geriatrics. Board specialist certification requires passing an exam and completing clinical work in the specialty area.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. Physical therapists must clearly explain treatment programs, motivate patients, and listen to patients’ concerns in order to provide effective therapy.\n\nCompassion. Physical therapists spend a lot of time interacting with patients, so they should have a desire to help people. They work with people who are in pain and must have empathy for their patients.\n\nDetail oriented. Like other healthcare providers, physical therapists should have strong analytic and observational skills to diagnose a patient’s problem, evaluate treatments, and provide safe, effective care.\n\nDexterity. Physical therapists must use their hands to provide manual therapy and therapeutic exercises. They should feel comfortable massaging and otherwise physically assisting patients.\n\nPhysical stamina. Physical therapists spend much of their time on their feet, moving to demonstrate proper techniques and to help patients perform exercises. They should enjoy physical activity.\n\nResourcefulness. Physical therapists customize treatment plans for patients. They must be flexible and adapt plans of care to meet the needs of each patient.\n\nTime-management skills. Physical therapists typically treat several patients each day. They must be able to provide appropriate care to patients as well as complete administrative tasks, such as documenting patient progress.\n\nJob Outlook About this section\n\nPhysical Therapists\n\nPercent change in employment, projected 2022-32\n\nPhysical therapists\n\n15%\n\nHealthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners\n\n9%\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n3%\n\nEmployment of physical therapists is projected to grow 15 percent from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 13,900 openings for physical therapists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nDemand for physical therapy will come, in part, from the large number of aging baby boomers, who are staying more active later in life than their counterparts of previous generations. Older people are more likely to experience heart attacks, strokes, and mobility-related injuries that require physical therapy for rehabilitation.\n\nIn addition, a number of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, have become prevalent. More physical therapists will be needed to help people with these conditions maintain their mobility and manage their disease or illness.\n\nA greater emphasis on non-opioid approaches to manage pain also is expected to support employment growth.\n\nEmployment projections data for physical therapists, 2022-32 Occupational Title SOC Code Employment, 2022 Projected Employment, 2032 Change, 2022-32 Employment by Industry Percent Numeric\n\nPhysical therapists\n\n29-1123 246,800 284,100 15 37,300 Get data\n\nState & Area Data About this section\n\nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.
