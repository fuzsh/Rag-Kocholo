        "text": "Spatial Facts\n\nArea Size: Utah is 84,900 square miles and ranked the 11th largest state (in terms of square miles) in the U.S.\n\nLength: 350 miles\n\nWidth: 270 miles\n\nHighest and Lowest Points: Kings Peak reaches an unbelievable 13,528 ft in the Uinta Mountains while the Beaver Dam Wash holds strong at a modest 2,350 ft. Kings Peak is located in Duchesne County in the Northeast part of the state, and Beaver Dam Wash is near St. George in Washington County in the state's southwest quadrant.\n\nUtah's peaks, on average, are the tallest in the country. That is, if you average the elevations of the tallest peaks in each of Utah's counties and compare that number with the average elevations of the tallest peaks in each county of every other state, you will find that Utah's peaks will be an average of 11,222 feet taller. Now that's tall!"
