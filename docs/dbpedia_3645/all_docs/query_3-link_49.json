        "text": "The United States has a long tradition of sheltering those fleeing conflict and persecution. Once refugees have been identified by the United Nations refugee agency and cleared for resettlement, the U.S. government works with the IRC and eight other national resettlement agencies to help them restart their lives in America. Out of the nearly 20 million refugees in the world, fewer than 1 percent are considered for resettlement worldwide.\n\nRefugees may be placed in a city where they have relatives or friends, or where there’s an established community that shares their language or culture. Other considerations include the cost of living and a community’s ability to provide medical services. However, as legal U.S. residents, refugees may live in any city and state they choose.\n\nUtah continues to stand for welcome with leaders willing to speak out in support of refugees and refugee resettlement. The IRC in Salt Lake City is honored to work in a state that chooses to welcome refugees and other New Americans with open arms and provide safety to the most vulnerable people arriving in the U.S.\n\nLearn more about how refugee resettlement really works.\n\nOur programs are designed to ensure refugees thrive in America--whether ensuring children are enrolled in school, adults become self-reliant through employment or starting businesses, or families receive the acute medical care they need to recover from trauma or illness. The IRC helps those in need to rebuild their lives and regain control of their future in their new home community.\n\nRefugees are greeted and welcomed at the airport by IRC caseworkers and volunteers to ensure their transition is as comfortable as possible. The IRC also makes sure newly arrived refugees receive:\n\nA furnished and supplied home\n\nTemporary help with rent\n\nAccess to healthcare\n\nNutritious, affordable food\n\nEnglish language classes\n\nHelp building job, computer, and financial literacy skills\n\nEducation for their children\n\nSocial services and community support\n\nLegal services towards residency and citizenship\n\nSmall business development\n\nOur programs in Salt Lake City:\n\nResettlement: Meeting the basic needs for food, shelter and legal rights in the early, critical stages of resettlement.\n\nCommunity Sponsorship: Under the resettlement program, community sponsorship allows community members to get involved through gathering a welcome team of 6-10 people!\n\nEconomic Empowerment: Protecting, supporting and improving household livelihoods and financial security, including small business supports.\n\nCommunity Integration and Development: Strengthening communities and preparing individuals to participate fully in American society.\n\nHealth and Wellness: Promoting wellness and ensuring access to healthcare services that address physical and psychological needs.\n\nChildren, Youth and Education: Providing educational and developmental opportunities that build the essential academic, personal and social skills needed to succeed.\n\nThe IRC welcomes the opportunity to share our work and the refugee resettlement process through presentations to corporations, civic or religious groups.
