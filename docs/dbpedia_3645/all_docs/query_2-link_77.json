Located near the park's south entrance, the campground is just a short walk from the main visitor center, the Zion Canyon Shuttle System and the adjacent town of Springdale. The canyon and most of the park's trails are only accessible by shuttle bus from approximately March through November each year. Season Dates: Watchman Campground is open year-round. Reservations are available 6 months in advance.__\n\nRecreation\n\nHikers can access three trails directly from the facility: the Watchman Trail, a moderate trail that ascends the peak behind the campground; the Archeology Trail, which offers a light hike to an archeological site nearby; and the Pa'rus Trail, a paved walking and biking trail that runs alongside the river, and the only trail in the park that allows dogs. Although there are no rock climbing routes in the campground, many popular climbs are within a short shuttle bus ride into the main canyon. Use of OHVs and ATVs is prohibited in Zion National Park.\n\nFacilities\n\nHikers can access three trails directly from the facility: the Watchman Trail, a moderate trail that ascends the peak behind the campground; the Archeology Trail, which offers a light hike to an archeological site nearby; and the Pa'rus Trail, a paved walking and biking trail that runs alongside the river, and the only trail in the park that allows dogs. Although there are no rock climbing routes in the campground, many popular climbs are within a short shuttle bus ride into the main canyon. Use of OHVs and ATVs is prohibited in Zion National Park.\n\nNatural Features\n\nZion is known for it's dynamic geologic history and Watchman Campground is no exception. Named for the rocky peak that rises above it, the campground is surrounded by tall sandstone cliffs that glow red and orange during sunrise and sunset. The Virgin River, a narrow but powerful river that has carved out the canyon over time, runs adjacent to the campground. Cottonwood trees surrounding the campsite turn golden in the fall. Most of the campsites are in partial to full sun, however in the Group sites (E-Loop) and the Walk-To sites (F-Loop) visitors may receive some shade under pergulas that are constructed over the picnic tables. Visitors can also cool off in the cold river when temperatures peak during summer. Be Advised: The months of April and May bring an unusual infestation of Tent Caterpillars, which fall from trees onto tents, tables, and unsuspecting campers and can make it quite uncomfortable to sit outside. The months of July and August in particular bring a higher concentration of ants in the campsites, which seem to come out especially after the monsoons, but are present all summer long. Insecticidal treatment by visitors is not permitted.\n\nNearby Attractions\n\nThe town of Springdale has shopping, art galleries, restaurants, and a public library. Throughout the year, concerts, festivals, and parades are held in the town.\n\ncontact_info\n\nFor facility specific information, please call (877) 444-6777.\n\nCharges & Cancellations\n\nIndividual Site: A $10.00 service fee will apply if you modify your reservation or change your stay dates. Cancelling your reservation prior to 11:59 pm Eastern Time two nights before your stay will incur a $10 cancellation fee. Camping reservations cancelled the day before and day of arrival incur a $10 cancellation fee and forfeit the first night's use fee If you need to cancel or modify your reservation after 12:00 am Eastern Time on the day of arrival you must contact campground staff at zion_watchman_campground@nps.gov. Group campsite: Customers who cancel a group site reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.\n\nWelcome to Snow Canyon State Park Campground, nestled near St. George, Utah. This place is a gem for anyone looking to immerse themselves in stunning red rock scenery and enjoy a variety of outdoor activities. The campground is open all year, so you can plan your visit whenever it suits you.\n\nThe campground offers a mix of tent, RV, and glamping accommodations. Some of the standout features include electric hookups, drinking water, and showers. Pets are welcome, and you can even bring your own firewood for a cozy campfire under the stars. The RV sites are paved, making it easy for big rigs to settle in, though they are a bit close together. If you're looking for more space, the non-electric sites offer a bit more breathing room.\n\nVisitors have raved about the incredible views and the easy access to hiking trails. The campground is surrounded by high red rocks, creating a picturesque setting that's perfect for photography or just soaking in the natural beauty. There are 14 miles of trails accessible from the campground, including the highly recommended Petrified Dunes trail and the short trail to Jenny Cave.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this campground is its proximity to lava tunnels and petrified sand dunes, adding an extra layer of adventure to your stay. The campground is also home to the ranger station, so you'll see some traffic during the day, but it quiets down nicely at night.\n\nIf you're planning a group trip, sites like 16A and 16B are perfect for larger gatherings, offering plenty of space and privacy. For those seeking seclusion, site 22 is highly recommended for its privacy and proximity to the bathhouse.\n\nOverall, Snow Canyon State Park Campground is a fantastic spot for a weekend getaway or an extended stay.
