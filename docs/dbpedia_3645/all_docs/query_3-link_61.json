        "text": "The mission of the Salt Lake County Assessor’s Office is to consistently provide the public with the Fair Market Value of real and personal property through professionalism, efficiency and courtesy in compliance with the laws and statutes of the State of Utah and other applicable standards of assessment.\n\nWe will accomplish these objectives on behalf of the people of Salt Lake County in the following ways:\n\nBy administering our duties as public servants in partnership with those we serve\n\nBy demonstrating fairness and equity\n\nBy utilizing effective communication\n\nBy incorporating technology to ensure accuracy and timeliness\n\nBy educating ourselves and the public about our respective duties and responsibilities\n\nBy planning for the future\n\nThe Utah Constitution, Article XIII, Section 2, requires \"All tangible property in the State, not exempt under the laws of the United States, or under this Constitution, shall be taxed at a uniform and equal rate in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as provided by law.\"\n\nTitle 59, Chapter 2 of the Utah Code is the Property Tax Act, which contains provisions for levying and collecting taxes on both personal and real property. Provisions of 59-2 also cover appeals (59-2-1001 et seq), exemptions, deferrals and abatements (59- 2-1101 through 59-2-1220), tax liens (59-2-1301 et seq), delinquencies (59-2- 1331 through 59-2-1334), and sales of property for delinquent taxes (59-2-1302, 59-2-1303 and 59-2-1343 through 59-2-1364). In addition, Tax Commission Rules R884 pertains to property tax as well as the Uniform School Fund\n\nTax Rate Calculation: Approved Budget ÷ Total Tax Base = Tax Rate\n\nNote: The tax rate is fine-tuned through other factors such as the five-year collection rate and the historical level of the board of equalization adjustments.\n\nTotal Tax Base Includes The Following:\n\nLocally assessed Residential\n\nLocally assessed Commercial\n\nLocally assessed Personal Property\n\nSome Fee in Lieu (Motor Vehicle – boats, trailers, motor homes, motorcycles)\n\nState Assessed by Tax Commission (such as mines, utility companies, airlines, etc.)\n\nNote: Each taxing entity has a distinct tax base\n\nFor Example: The tax base for the County includes the entire county while the tax base for the Un-incorporated Salt Lake County includes only the Unincorporated County. (Which includes Kearns, Magna, Millcreek, White City, as well as the other unincorporated areas.)\n\nProperty taxes are an important source of revenue for public (K-12) schools, libraries, city and county governments. As in most states in the United States, property taxes are the backbone of funding of local government and schools. Salt Lake County's property tax with some changes has fulfilled this basic function since statehood.\n\nGenerally, public (K-12) schools receive the largest share of the property tax, as well as city government, county government, libraries, water districts, mosquito abatement districts, etc.\n\nIf you have any questions concerning your real or personal property, please contact our office. It is important to our office to correct any factual or valuation errors. Property Owners are always welcomed year round to meet informally with staff, to correct errors in property characteristics and to discuss valuation issues.\n\nFor Questions concerning the Board of Equalization, please go to Salt Lake County Property Tax Division\n\nThere are numerous types of sales occurring throughout the county. Some of which are less than market as well as some more than market. Market value must be viewed as a willing buyer and willing seller without any undue pressure to buy or sell. For example if an individual is transferred from the county or inherits property, they may choose to sell below the market to rid themselves of the burden of trying to maintain two households. On the other hand one might choose to purchase a home above the indicated market value for reasons such as location to one's employment, relatives, schools and fondness of the overall structure and layout of the property. These, along with other sales that have occurred in the neighborhood, must be considered. We determine what the majority of similar properties are selling for, in that neighborhood, and apply those findings in terms of market value for each property.\n\nIt is not a penalty. Although it does occur, few people will pay more for something than it is worth. Therefore if a number of homes similar to yours are selling for more based on the price paid by newcomers to your neighborhood, it increases the marketability and market value of your property should you decide to sell.\n\nThe newer homes will not have a direct affect on your value. We will compare your home to similar properties in terms of age, condition and size as well as a number of other variables. However, as the desirability of a neighborhood increases, even older homes may increase in value.\n\nThe County Assessor does not establish the amount of taxes you pay. If the market value placed on your property by the assessor remained the same as the previous year, the increase in your taxes can be attributed to an increase in tax rates within your particular tax district and tax rates can increase due to the public voting for bond issues; such as, school bonds, jail, etc., or an increase in the budget of a taxing entity."
