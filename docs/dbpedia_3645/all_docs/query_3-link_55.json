        "text": "Publication 526 - Introductory Material\n\nFuture Developments\n\nFor the latest information about developments related to Pub. 526 (such as legislation enacted after we release it), go to IRS.gov/Pub526.\n\nWhat's New\n\nDisallowance of deduction for certain conservation contributions by pass-through entities. Subject to some exceptions, if you are a member of a pass-through entity (such as a partner in a partnership or a shareholder in an S corporation), and the amount of the pass-through entity’s qualified conservation contribution exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each member’s relevant basis, the contribution is not treated as a qualified conservation contribution and no one may claim a deduction for the contribution. Thus, your charitable conservation contribution deduction is disallowed. See Disallowance of deductions for certain conservation contributions by pass-through entities later.\n\nQualified charitable distribution one-time election. Beginning in 2023, you can elect to make a one-time distribution up to $50,000 from an individual retirement account to charities through a charitable remainder annuity trust, a charitable remainder unitrust, or a charitable gift annuity each of which is funded only by qualified charitable distributions. See Pub. 590-B for more information.\n\nCharitable contributions for non-itemizers. The temporary deduction for charitable cash contributions for taxpayers who do not itemize their tax returns has expired and is no longer available.\n\nDeduction over $5,000. You must complete Section B of Form 8283 for each item—or group of similar non-cash items— for which you claim a deduction of over $5,000 except as provided in Deductions Over $5,000, later. The organization that received the property must complete and sign Part V of Section B, Form 8283.\n\nReduced deductibility of state and local tax credits. If you make a payment or transfer property to or for the use of a qualified organization and you receive or expect to receive a state or local tax credit or a state or local tax deduction in return, your charitable contribution deduction may be reduced. See State or local tax credit, later.\n\nPhotographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) or visiting www.missingkids.org if you recognize a child.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis publication explains how individuals claim a deduction for charitable contributions. It discusses the types of organizations to which you can make deductible charitable contributions and the types of contributions you can deduct. It also discusses how much you can deduct, what records you must keep, and how to report charitable contributions.\n\nA charitable contribution is a donation or gift to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. It is voluntary and is made without getting, or expecting to get, anything of equal value.\n\nQualified organizations.\n\nQualified organizations include nonprofit groups that are religious, charitable, educational, scientific, or literary in purpose, or that work to prevent cruelty to children or animals. You will find descriptions of these organizations under Organizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions.\n\nSchedule A (Form 1040) required.\n\nGenerally, to deduct a charitable contribution, you must itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). The amount of your deduction may be limited if certain rules and limits explained in this publication apply to you.\n\nComments and suggestions.\n\nWe welcome your comments about this publication and suggestions for future editions.\n\nYou can send us comments through IRS.gov/FormComments. Or, you can write to the Internal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Publications, 1111 Constitution Ave. NW, IR-6526, Washington, DC 20224.\n\nAlthough we can’t respond individually to each comment received, we do appreciate your feedback and will consider your comments and suggestions as we revise our tax forms, instructions, and publications. Don’t send tax questions, tax returns, or payments to the above address.\n\nGetting answers to your tax questions.\n\nIf you have a tax question not answered by this publication or the How To Get Tax Help section at the end of this publication, go to the IRS Interactive Tax Assistant page at IRS.gov/Help/ITA where you can find topics by using the search feature or viewing the categories listed.\n\nGetting tax forms, instructions, and publications.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Forms to download current and prior-year forms, instructions, and publications.\n\nOrdering tax forms, instructions, and publications.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Forms to order current forms, instructions, and publications; call 800–829–3676 to order prior-year forms and instructions. The IRS will process your order for forms and publications as soon as possible. Don’t resubmit requests you’ve already sent us. You can get forms and publications faster online.\n\nUseful Items\n\nYou may want to see:\n\nPublication\n\n561 Determining the Value of Donated Property\n\n976 Disaster Relief\n\nForms (and Instructions)\n\nSchedule A (Form 1040) Itemized Deductions\n\n8283 Noncash Charitable Contributions\n\nSee How To Get Tax Help near the end of this publication for information about getting these publications and forms.\n\nPublication 526 - Main Contents\n\nOrganizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions\n\nYou can deduct your contributions only if you make them to a qualified organization.\n\nHow to check whether an organization can receive deductible charitable contributions.\n\nYou can ask any organization whether it is a qualified organization, and most will be able to tell you. You can also check by going to IRS.gov/TEOS. This online tool will enable you to search for qualified organizations.\n\nTypes of Qualified Organizations\n\nGenerally, only the following types of organizations can be qualified organizations.\n\nA community chest, corporation, trust, fund, or foundation organized or created in or under the laws of the United States, any state, the District of Columbia, or any possession of the United States (including Puerto Rico). It must, however, be organized and operated only for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals. Certain organizations that foster national or international amateur sports competition also qualify.\n\nWar veterans' organizations, including posts, auxiliaries, trusts, or foundations organized in the United States or any of its possessions (including Puerto Rico).\n\nDomestic fraternal societies, orders, and associations operating under the lodge system. (Your contribution to this type of organization is deductible only if it is to be used solely for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals.)\n\nCertain nonprofit cemetery companies or corporations. (Your contribution to this type of organization isn't deductible if it can be used for the care of a specific lot or mausoleum crypt.)\n\nThe United States or any state, the District of Columbia, a U.S. possession (including Puerto Rico), a political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession, or an Indian tribal government or any of its subdivisions that perform substantial government functions. (Your contribution to this type of organization is deductible only if it is to be used solely for public purposes.)\n\nExample 1. You contribute cash to your city's police department to be used as a reward for information about a crime. The city police department is a qualified organization, and your contribution is for a public purpose. You can deduct your contribution.\n\nExample 2. You make a voluntary contribution to the social security trust fund, not earmarked for a specific account. Because the trust fund is part of the U.S. Government, you contributed to a qualified organization. You can deduct your contribution.\n\nExamples.\n\nThe following list gives some examples of qualified organizations.\n\nChurches, a convention or association of churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other religious organizations.\n\nMost nonprofit charitable organizations such as the American Red Cross and the United Way.\n\nMost nonprofit educational organizations, including the Scouts BSA, Girl Scouts of America, colleges, and museums. This also includes nonprofit daycare centers that provide childcare to the general public if substantially all the childcare is provided to enable parents and guardians to be gainfully employed. However, if your contribution is a substitute for tuition or other enrollment fee, it isn't deductible as a charitable contribution, as explained later under Contributions You Can't Deduct.\n\nNonprofit hospitals and medical research organizations.\n\nUtility company emergency energy programs, if the utility company is an agent for a charitable organization that assists individuals with emergency energy needs.\n\nNonprofit volunteer fire companies.\n\nNonprofit organizations that develop and maintain public parks and recreation facilities.\n\nCivil defense organizations.\n\nCanadian charities.\n\nYou may be able to deduct contributions to certain Canadian charitable organizations covered under an income tax treaty with Canada. To deduct your contribution to a Canadian charity, you must generally have income from sources in Canada. See Pub. 597, Information on the United States–Canada Income Tax Treaty, for information on how to figure your deduction.\n\nMexican charities.\n\nUnder the United States–Mexico income tax treaty, a contribution to a Mexican charitable organization may be deductible, but only if and to the extent the contribution would have been treated as a charitable contribution to a public charity created or organized under U.S. law. To deduct your contribution to a Mexican charity, you must have income from sources in Mexico. The limits described in Limits on Deductions, later, apply and are figured using your income from Mexican sources.\n\nIsraeli charities.\n\nUnder the United States–Israel income tax treaty, a contribution to an Israeli charitable organization is deductible if and to the extent the contribution would have been treated as a charitable contribution if the organization had been created or organized under U.S. law. To deduct your contribution to an Israeli charity, you must have income from sources in Israel. The limits described in Limits on Deductions, later, apply. The deduction is also limited to 25% of your AGI from Israeli sources.\n\nContributions You Can Deduct\n\nGenerally, you can deduct contributions of money or property you make to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. A contribution is “for the use of” a qualified organization when it is held in a legally enforceable trust for the qualified organization or in a similar legal arrangement.\n\nThe contributions must be made to a qualified organization and not set aside for use by a specific person.\n\nIf you give property to a qualified organization, you can generally deduct the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time of the contribution. See Contributions of Property, later.\n\nYour deduction for charitable contributions generally can't be more than 60% of your AGI, but in some cases 20%, 30%, or 50% limits may apply.\n\nTable 1 gives examples of contributions you can and can't deduct.\n\nTable 1. Examples of Charitable Contributions—A Quick Check\n\nUse the following lists for a quick check of whether you can deduct a contribution. See the rest of this publication for more information and additional rules and limits that may apply.\n\nDeductible As\n\nCharitable Contributions Not Deductible As\n\nCharitable Contributions Money or property you give to: Money or property you give to:\n\nChurches, synagogues, temples,\n\nmosques, and other religious\n\norganizations\n\nFederal, state, and local\n\ngovernments, if your contribution is\n\nsolely for public purposes (for\n\nexample, a gift to reduce the public\n\ndebt or maintain a public park)\n\nNonprofit schools and hospitals\n\nThe Salvation Army, American Red Cross, CARE, Goodwill Industries, United Way, Scouts BSA, Girl Scouts of America, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, etc.\n\nWar veterans' groups\n\nExpenses paid for a student living with you, sponsored by a qualified organization\n\nOut-of-pocket expenses when you serve a qualified organization as a volunteer\n\nCivic leagues, social and sports\n\nclubs, labor unions, and chambers of\n\ncommerce\n\nForeign organizations (except certain\n\nCanadian, Israeli, and Mexican\n\ncharities)\n\nGroups that are run for personal\n\nprofit\n\nGroups whose purpose is to lobby for\n\nlaw changes\n\nHomeowners' associations\n\nIndividuals\n\nPolitical groups or candidates for\n\npublic office\n\nCost of raffle, bingo, or lottery tickets\n\nDues, fees, or bills paid to country clubs, lodges, fraternal orders, or similar groups\n\nTuition\n\nValue of your time or services\n\nValue of blood given to a blood bank\n\nContributions From Which You Benefit\n\nIf you receive a benefit as a result of making a contribution to a qualified organization, you can deduct only the amount of your contribution that is more than the value of the benefit you receive. Also see Contributions From Which You Benefit under Contributions You Can't Deduct, later.\n\nIf you pay more than FMV to a qualified organization for goods or services, the excess may be a charitable contribution. For the excess amount to qualify, you must pay it with the intent to make a charitable contribution.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou pay $65 for a ticket to a dinner dance at a church. Your entire $65 payment goes to the church. The ticket to the dinner dance has an FMV of $25. When you buy your ticket, you know its value is less than your payment. To figure the amount of your charitable contribution, subtract the value of the benefit you receive ($25) from your total payment ($65). You can deduct $40 as a charitable contribution to the church.\n\nExample 2.\n\nAt a fundraising auction conducted by a charity, you pay $600 for a week's stay at a beach house. The amount you pay is no more than the fair rental value. You haven't made a deductible charitable contribution.\n\nCharity benefit events.\n\nIf you pay a qualified organization more than FMV for the right to attend a charity ball, banquet, show, sporting event, or other benefit event, you can deduct only the amount that is more than the value of the privileges or other benefits you receive.\n\nIf there is an established charge for the event, that charge is the value of your benefit. If there is no established charge, the reasonable value of the right to attend the event is the value of your benefit. Whether you use the tickets or other privileges has no effect on the amount you can deduct. However, if you return the ticket to the qualified organization for resale, you can deduct the entire amount you paid for the ticket.\n\n. Even if the ticket or other evidence of payment indicates that the payment is a “contribution,” this doesn't mean you can deduct the entire amount. If the ticket shows the price of admission and the amount of the contribution, you can deduct the contribution amount. .\n\nExample.\n\nYou pay $40 to see a special showing of a movie for the benefit of a qualified organization. Printed on the ticket is “Contribution—$40.” If the regular price for the movie is $8, your contribution is $32 ($40 payment − $8 regular price).\n\nState or local tax credit.\n\nIf you make a payment or transfer property to or for the use of a qualified organization and receive or expect to receive a state or local tax credit in return, then the amount treated as a charitable contribution deduction is reduced by the amount of the state or local tax credit you receive or expect to receive in consideration for your payment or transfer, but an exception may apply. If an exception doesn’t apply, you must reduce your charitable contribution deduction even if you can’t claim the state tax credit in the year.\n\nException.\n\nIf the state or local tax credit you receive or expect to receive doesn’t exceed 15% of your payment amount or 15% of the FMV of the transferred property, then your charitable contribution deduction isn’t reduced.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou make a cash contribution of $1,000 to charity X, a qualified organization. In return for your payment you receive or expect to receive a state tax credit of 70% of your $1,000 contribution. The amount of your charitable contribution to charity X is reduced by $700 (70% of $1,000). The result is your charitable contribution deduction to charity X can’t exceed $300 ($1,000 donation−$700 state tax credit). The reduction applies even if you can’t claim the state tax credit for that year. Your deductible charitable contribution to charity X is $300. Your total contributions may still be subject to limitations. See Limits on Deductions, later.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou donate a painting to charity Y, a qualified organization. At the time of the donation, the painting has an FMV of $100,000. In return for the painting, you receive or expect to receive a state tax credit of 10% of the FMV of the painting. The state tax credit is $10,000 (10% of $100,000). The amount of your state tax credit does not exceed 15% of the FMV of the painting. As a result, your charitable contribution deduction to charity Y is not reduced. Your deductible charitable contribution for your noncash contribution to charity Y is $100,000. However, your total contributions may still be subject to limitations. See Limits on Deductions, later.\n\nState or local tax deduction.\n\nIf you make a payment or transfer property to a qualified organization and receive or expect to receive a state or local tax deduction in return, then the amount of your charitable contribution deduction to the organization may be reduced in some circumstances. If the amount of the state or local tax deduction exceeds the amount of your cash contribution or the FMV of the transferred property, then your charitable contribution deduction is reduced. However, if the amount of the state or local tax deduction doesn’t exceed the amount of your payment or the FMV of the transferred property, then no reduction is necessary.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou make a cash contribution of $1,000 to charity Z, a qualified organization. Under state law, you are entitled to receive a state tax deduction of $1,000 in return for your payment. The amount of your charitable contribution deduction to charity Z isn’t reduced. Your charitable contribution deduction to charity Z is $1,000. However, your total contributions may still be subject to limitations. See Limits on Deductions, later.\n\nMembership fees or dues.\n\nYou may be able to deduct membership fees or dues you pay to a qualified organization. However, you can deduct only the amount that is more than the value of the benefits you receive.\n\nYou can't deduct dues, fees, or assessments paid to country clubs and other social organizations. They aren't qualified organizations.\n\nCertain membership benefits can be disregarded.\n\nBoth you and the organization can disregard the following membership benefits if you get them in return for an annual payment of $75 or less.\n\nAny rights or privileges that you can use frequently while you are a member, such as:\n\nFree or discounted admission to the organization's facilities or events,\n\nFree or discounted parking,\n\nPreferred access to goods or services, and\n\nDiscounts on the purchase of goods and services.\n\nBut, item (1) doesn’t include rights to purchase tickets for seating at an athletic event in an athletic stadium of a college or university as a result of a contribution to such institution.\n\nAdmission, while you are a member, to events open only to members of the organization if the organization reasonably projects that the cost per person (excluding any allocated overhead) isn't more than $12.50.\n\nToken items.\n\nYou don't have to reduce your contribution by the value of any benefit you receive if both of the following are true.\n\nYou receive only a small item or other benefit of token value.\n\nThe qualified organization correctly determines that the value of the item or benefit you received isn't substantial and informs you that you can deduct your payment in full.\n\nThe organization determines whether the value of an item or benefit is substantial by using Revenue Procedures 90-12 and 92-49 and the inflation adjustment in Revenue Procedure 2022-38.\n\nWritten statement.\n\nA qualified organization must give you a written statement if you make a payment of more than $75 that is partly a contribution and partly for goods or services. The statement must say you can deduct only the amount of your payment that is more than the value of the goods or services you received. It must also give you a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services.\n\nThe organization can give you the statement either when it solicits or when it receives the payment from you.\n\nException.\n\nAn organization won't have to give you this statement if one of the following is true.\n\nThe organization is:\n\nA governmental organization described in (5) under Types of Qualified Organizations, earlier, or\n\nAn organization formed only for religious purposes, and the only benefit you receive is an intangible religious benefit (such as admission to a religious ceremony) that generally isn't sold in commercial transactions outside the donative context.\n\nYou receive only items whose value isn't substantial, as described under Token items, earlier.\n\nYou receive only membership benefits that can be disregarded, as described under Membership fees or dues, earlier.\n\nExpenses Paid for Student Living With You\n\nYou may be able to deduct some expenses of having a student live with you. You can deduct qualifying expenses for a foreign or American student who:\n\nLives in your home under a written agreement between you and a qualified organization (defined later) as part of a program of the organization to provide educational opportunities for the student,\n\nIsn't your relative (defined later) or dependent (also defined later), and\n\nIs a full-time student in the 12th or any lower grade at a school in the United States.\n\n. You can deduct up to $50 a month for each full calendar month the student lives with you. Any month when conditions (1) through (3) are met for 15 or more days counts as a full month. .\n\nQualified organization.\n\nFor these purposes, a qualified organization can be any of the organizations described earlier under Types of Qualified Organizations, except those in (4) and (5). For example, if you are providing a home for a student as part of a state or local government program, you can't deduct your expenses as charitable contributions. But see Foster parents under Out-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services, later, if you provide the home as a foster parent.\n\nRelative.\n\nThe term “relative” means any of the following persons.\n\nYour child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild). A legally adopted child is considered your child.\n\nYour sibling(s), half sibling(s), or step-sibling(s).\n\nYour parent(s), grandparent(s), or other direct ancestor(s).\n\nYour step-parent(s).\n\nA child of your sibling(s).\n\nA sibling of your parent(s).\n\nThe spouse of your child, the parent(s) of your spouse, the sibling(s) of your spouse.\n\nDependent.\n\nFor this purpose, the term “dependent” means:\n\nA person you can claim as a dependent, or\n\nA person you could have claimed as a dependent except that:\n\nThe person received gross income of $4,700 or more;\n\nThe person filed a joint return; or\n\nYou, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2023 return.\n\n. Foreign students brought to this country under a qualified international education exchange program and placed in American homes for a temporary period generally aren't U.S. residents and can't be claimed as dependents..\n\nQualifying expenses.\n\nYou may be able to deduct the cost of books, tuition, food, clothing, transportation, medical and dental care, entertainment, and other amounts you actually spend for the well-being of the student.\n\nExpenses that don't qualify.\n\nYou can't deduct depreciation on your home, the FMV of lodging, and similar items not considered amounts actually spent by you. Nor can you deduct general household expenses, such as taxes, insurance, and repairs.\n\nReimbursed expenses.\n\nIn most cases, you can't claim a charitable contribution deduction if you are compensated or reimbursed for any part of the costs of having a student live with you. However, you may be able to claim a charitable contribution deduction for the unreimbursed portion of your expenses if you are reimbursed only for an extraordinary or one-time item, such as a hospital bill or vacation trip, you paid in advance at the request of the student's parents or the sponsoring organization.\n\nMutual exchange program.\n\nYou can't deduct the costs of a foreign student living in your home under a mutual exchange program through which your child will live with a family in a foreign country.\n\nReporting expenses.\n\nFor a list of what you must file with your return if you deduct expenses for a student living with you, see Reporting expenses for student living with you under How To Report, later.\n\nOut-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services\n\nTable 2. Volunteers' Questions and Answers\n\nIf you volunteer for a qualified organization, the following questions and answers may apply to you. All of the rules explained in this publication also apply. See, in particular, Out-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services.\n\nQuestion Answer I volunteer 6 hours a week in the office of a qualified organization. The receptionist is paid $10 an hour for the same work. Can I deduct $60 a week for my time? No, you can't deduct the value of your time or services.\n\nThe office is 30 miles from my home. Can I deduct any of my car expenses for these trips? Yes, you can deduct the costs of gas and oil that are directly related to\n\ngetting to and from the place where you volunteer. If you don't\n\nwant to figure your actual costs, you can deduct 14 cents for each\n\nmile. I volunteer as a Red Cross nurse's aide at a hospital. Can I deduct the cost of the uniforms I must wear? Yes, you can deduct the cost of buying and cleaning your uniforms if\n\nthe hospital is a qualified organization, the uniforms aren't suitable for\n\neveryday use, and you must wear them when volunteering. I pay a babysitter to watch my children while I volunteer for a qualified organization. Can I deduct these costs? No, you can't deduct payments for childcare expenses as a\n\ncharitable contribution, even if you would be unable to volunteer without childcare. (If you have childcare expenses so you can work for pay, see Pub. 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses.)\n\nAlthough you can't deduct the value of your services given to a qualified organization, you may be able to deduct some amounts you pay in giving services to a qualified organization. The amounts must be:\n\nUnreimbursed;\n\nDirectly connected with the services;\n\nExpenses you had only because of the services you gave; and\n\nNot personal, living, or family expenses.\n\nTable 2 contains questions and answers that apply to some individuals who volunteer their services.\n\nUnderprivileged youths selected by charity.\n\nYou can deduct reasonable unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses you pay to allow underprivileged youths to attend athletic events, movies, or dinners. The youths must be selected by a charitable organization whose goal is to reduce juvenile delinquency. Your own similar expenses in accompanying the youths aren't deductible.\n\nConventions.\n\nIf a qualified organization selects you to attend a convention as its representative, you can deduct your unreimbursed expenses for travel, including reasonable amounts for meals and lodging, while away from home overnight for the convention. However, see Travel, later.\n\nYou can't deduct personal expenses for sightseeing, fishing parties, theater tickets, or nightclubs. You also can't deduct travel, meals and lodging, and other expenses for your spouse or children.\n\nYou can't deduct your travel expenses in attending a church convention if you go only as a member of your church rather than as a chosen representative. You can, however, deduct unreimbursed expenses that are directly connected with giving services for your church during the convention.\n\nUniforms.\n\nYou can deduct the cost and upkeep of uniforms that aren't suitable for everyday use and that you must wear while performing donated services for a qualified organization.\n\nFoster parents.\n\nYou may be able to deduct as a charitable contribution some of the costs of being a foster parent (foster care provider) if you have no profit motive in providing the foster care and aren't, in fact, making a profit. A qualified organization must select the individuals you take into your home for foster care.\n\nYou can deduct expenses that meet both of the following requirements.\n\nThey are unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses to feed, clothe, and care for the foster child.\n\nThey are incurred primarily to benefit the qualified organization.\n\nUnreimbursed expenses that you can't deduct as charitable contributions may be considered support provided by you in determining whether you can claim the foster child as a dependent. For details, see Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.\n\nExample.\n\nYou cared for a foster child because you wanted to adopt her, not to benefit the agency that placed her in your home. Your unreimbursed expenses aren't deductible as charitable contributions.\n\nChurch deacon.\n\nYou can deduct as a charitable contribution any unreimbursed expenses you have while in a permanent diaconate program established by your church. These expenses include the cost of vestments, books, and transportation required in order to serve in the program as either a deacon candidate or an ordained deacon.\n\nCar expenses.\n\nYou can deduct as a charitable contribution any unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses, such as the cost of gas and oil, directly related to the use of your car in giving services to a charitable organization. You can't deduct general repair and maintenance expenses, depreciation, registration fees, or the costs of tires or insurance.\n\nIf you don't want to deduct your actual expenses, you can use a standard mileage rate of 14 cents a mile to figure your contribution.\n\nYou can deduct parking fees and tolls whether you use your actual expenses or the standard mileage rate.\n\nYou must keep reliable written records of your car expenses. For more information, see Car expenses under Substantiation Requirements, later.\n\nTravel.\n\nGenerally, you can claim a charitable contribution deduction for travel expenses necessarily incurred while you are away from home performing services for a qualified organization only if there is no significant element of personal pleasure, recreation, or vacation in the travel. This applies whether you pay the expenses directly or indirectly. You are paying the expenses indirectly if you make a payment to the qualified organization and the organization pays for your travel expenses.\n\nThe deduction for travel expenses won't be denied simply because you enjoy providing services to the qualified organization. Even if you enjoy the trip, you can take a charitable contribution deduction for your travel expenses if you are on duty in a genuine and substantial sense throughout the trip. However, if you have only nominal duties, or if for significant parts of the trip you don't have any duties, you can't deduct your travel expenses.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou are a troop leader for a tax-exempt youth group and you take the group on a camping trip. You are responsible for overseeing the setup of the camp and for providing adult supervision for other activities during the entire trip. You participate in the activities of the group and enjoy your time with them. You oversee the breaking of camp and you transport the group home. You can deduct your travel expenses.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou sail from one island to another and spend 8 hours a day counting whales and other forms of marine life. The project is sponsored by a qualified organization. In most circumstances, you can't deduct your expenses.\n\nExample 3.\n\nYou work for several hours each morning on an archeological dig sponsored by a qualified organization. The rest of the day is free for recreation and sightseeing. You can't take a charitable contribution deduction even though you work very hard during those few hours.\n\nExample 4.\n\nYou spend the entire day attending a qualified organization's regional meeting as a chosen representative. In the evening you go to the theater. You can claim your travel expenses as charitable contributions, but you can't claim the cost of your evening at the theater.\n\nDaily allowance (per diem).\n\nIf you provide services for a qualified organization and receive a daily allowance to cover reasonable travel expenses, including meals and lodging while away from home overnight, you must include in income any part of the allowance that is more than your deductible travel expenses. You may be able to deduct any necessary travel expenses that are more than the allowance.\n\nDeductible travel expenses.\n\nThese include:\n\nAir, rail, and bus transportation;\n\nOut-of-pocket expenses for your car;\n\nTaxi fares or other costs of transportation between the airport or station and your hotel;\n\nLodging costs; and\n\nThe cost of meals.\n\nBecause these travel expenses aren't business-related, they aren't subject to the same limits as business-related expenses. For information on business travel expenses, see Travel in Pub. 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses.\n\nExpenses of Whaling Captains\n\nYou may be able to deduct as a charitable contribution any reasonable and necessary whaling expenses you pay during the year to carry out sanctioned whaling activities. The deduction is limited to $10,000 a year. To claim the deduction, you must be recognized by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission as a whaling captain charged with the responsibility of maintaining and carrying out sanctioned whaling activities.\n\nSanctioned whaling activities are subsistence bowhead whale hunting activities conducted under the management plan of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.\n\nWhaling expenses include expenses for:\n\nAcquiring and maintaining whaling boats, weapons, and gear used in sanctioned whaling activities;\n\nSupplying food for the crew and other provisions for carrying out these activities; and\n\nStoring and distributing the catch from these activities.\n\n. You must keep records showing the time, place, date, amount, and nature of the expenses. For details, see Revenue Procedure 2006-50, 2006-47 I.R.B. 944, available at IRS.gov/irb/2006-47_IRB#RP-2006-50..\n\nContributions You Can't Deduct\n\nThere are some contributions you can't deduct and others you can deduct only in part.\n\nYou can't deduct as a charitable contribution:\n\nA contribution to a specific individual,\n\nA contribution to a nonqualified organization,\n\nThe part of a contribution from which you receive or expect to receive a benefit,\n\nThe value of your time or services,\n\nYour personal expenses,\n\nA qualified charitable distribution from an individual retirement arrangement (IRA),\n\nAppraisal fees,\n\nCertain contributions to donor-advised funds,\n\nCertain contributions of partial interests in property, or\n\nCertain conservation contributions by pass-through entities.\n\nDetailed discussions of these items follow.\n\nContributions to Individuals\n\nYou can't deduct contributions to specific individuals, including the following.\n\nContributions to fraternal societies made for the purpose of paying medical or burial expenses of members.\n\nContributions to individuals who are needy or worthy. You can't deduct these contributions even if you make them to a qualified organization for the benefit of a specific person. But you can deduct a contribution to a qualified organization that helps needy or worthy individuals if you don't indicate that your contribution is for a specific person.\n\nExample. You can deduct contributions to a qualified organization for flood relief, hurricane relief, or other disaster relief. However, you can’t deduct contributions earmarked for relief of a particular individual or family.\n\nPayments to a member of the clergy that can be spent as they wish, such as for personal expenses.\n\nExpenses you paid for another person who provided services to a qualified organization.\n\nExample. Your child does missionary work. You pay their expenses. You can’t claim a deduction for the expenses you paid related to their contribution of services.\n\nPayments to a hospital that are for a specific patient's care or for services for a specific patient. You can’t deduct these payments even if the hospital is operated by a city, state, or other qualified organization.\n\nContributions to Nonqualified Organizations\n\nYou can't deduct contributions to organizations that aren't qualified to receive tax-deductible contributions, including the following.\n\nCertain state bar associations if:\n\nThe bar isn't a political subdivision of a state;\n\nThe bar has private, as well as public, purposes, such as promoting the professional interests of members; and\n\nYour contribution is unrestricted and can be used for private purposes.\n\nChambers of commerce and other business leagues or organizations.\n\nCivic leagues and associations.\n\nCountry clubs and other social clubs.\n\nForeign organizations other than certain Canadian, Israeli, or Mexican charitable organizations. (See Canadian charities, Mexican charities, and Israeli charities under Organizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions, earlier.) Also, you can't deduct a contribution you made to any qualifying organization if the contribution is earmarked to go to a foreign organization. However, certain contributions to a qualified organization for use in a program conducted by a foreign charity may be deductible as long as they aren't earmarked to go to the foreign charity. For the contribution to be deductible, the qualified organization must approve the program as furthering its own exempt purposes and must keep control over the use of the contributed funds. The contribution is also deductible if the foreign charity is only an administrative arm of the qualified organization.\n\nHomeowners' associations.\n\nLabor unions.\n\nPolitical organizations and candidates.\n\nContributions From Which You Benefit\n\nIf you receive or expect to receive a financial or economic benefit as a result of making a contribution to a qualified organization, you can't deduct the part of the contribution that represents the value of the benefit you receive. See Contributions From Which You Benefit under Contributions You Can Deduct, earlier. These contributions include the following.\n\nContributions to a college or university if the amount paid is to (or for the benefit of) a college or university in exchange for tickets (or the right to buy tickets) to an athletic event in an athletic stadium of the college or university.\n\nContributions from which you receive or expect to receive a credit or deduction against state or local taxes unless an exception applies. See State or local tax credit and State or local tax deduction, earlier.\n\nContributions for lobbying. This includes amounts you earmark for use in, or in connection with, influencing specific legislation.\n\nContributions to a retirement home for room, board, maintenance, or admittance. Also, if the amount of your contribution depends on the type or size of apartment you will occupy, it isn't a charitable contribution.\n\nCosts of raffles, bingo, lottery, etc. You can't deduct as a charitable contribution amounts you pay to buy raffle or lottery tickets or to play bingo or other games of chance. For information on how to report gambling winnings and losses, see Expenses You Can Deduct in Pub. 529.\n\nDues to fraternal orders and similar groups. However, see Membership fees or dues under Contributions From Which You Benefit, earlier.\n\nTuition, or amounts you pay instead of tuition. You can't deduct as a charitable contribution amounts you pay as tuition even if you pay them for children to attend parochial schools or qualifying nonprofit daycare centers. You also can't deduct any fixed amount you must pay in addition to, or instead of, tuition to enroll in a private school, even if it is designated as a “donation.”\n\nContributions connected with split-dollar insurance arrangements. You can't deduct any part of a contribution to a qualified organization if, in connection with the contribution, the organization directly or indirectly pays, has paid, or is expected to pay any premium on any life insurance, annuity, or endowment contract for which you, any member of your family, or any other person chosen by you (other than a qualified charitable organization) is a beneficiary.\n\nExample. You donate money to a qualified organization. The charity uses the money to purchase a cash value life insurance policy. The beneficiaries under the insurance policy include members of your family. Even though the charity may eventually get some benefit out of the insurance policy, you can't deduct any part of the donation.\n\nQualified Charitable Distributions\n\nA qualified charitable distribution (QCD) is a distribution made directly by the trustee of your individual retirement arrangement (IRA), other than an SEP or SIMPLE IRA, to certain qualified organizations. You must have been at least age 70½ when the distribution was made. Your total QCDs for the year can't be more than $100,000. If all the requirements are met, a QCD may be nontaxable; however, if the QCD is nontaxable, you may not be able to claim it as a charitable contribution deduction. You may be able to claim a charitable contribution deduction if you claim the income you are deducting as a qualified contribution. See Pub. 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), for more information about QCDs.\n\nQualified charitable distribution one-time election.\n\nFor tax years beginning after 2022, you can elect to make a one-time distribution of up to $50,000 from an individual retirement account. This one-time distribution may be made through a charitable remainder trust, a charitable remainder unitrust, or a charitable gift annuity funded only by qualified charitable distributions.\n\nValue of Time or Services\n\nYou can't deduct the value of your time or services, including:\n\nBlood donations to the American Red Cross or to blood banks, and\n\nThe value of income lost while you work as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization.\n\nPersonal Expenses\n\nYou can't deduct personal, living, or family expenses, such as the following items.\n\nThe cost of meals you eat while you perform services for a qualified organization, unless it is necessary for you to be away from home overnight while performing the services.\n\nAdoption expenses, including fees paid to an adoption agency and the costs of keeping a child in your home before the adoption is final. However, you may be able to claim a tax credit for these expenses. Also, you may be able to exclude from your gross income amounts paid or reimbursed by your employer for your adoption expenses. See Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses, and its instructions, for more information.\n\nAppraisal Fees\n\nYou can't deduct as a charitable contribution any fees you pay to find the FMV of donated property.\n\nContributions to Donor-Advised Funds\n\nYou can't deduct a contribution to a donor-advised fund if:\n\nThe qualified organization that sponsors the fund is a war veterans' organization, a fraternal society, or a nonprofit cemetery company; or\n\nYou don't have an acknowledgment from that sponsoring organization that it has exclusive legal control over the assets contributed.\n\nThere are also other circumstances in which you can't deduct your contribution to a donor-advised fund.\n\nGenerally, a donor-advised fund is a fund or account in which a donor can, because of being a donor, advise the fund how to distribute or invest amounts held in the fund. For details, see Internal Revenue Code section 170(f)(18).\n\nPartial Interest in Property\n\nGenerally, you can't deduct a contribution of less than your entire interest in property. For details, see Partial Interest in Property under Contributions of Property, later.\n\nContributions of Property\n\nIf you contribute property to a qualified organization, the amount of your charitable contribution is generally the FMV of the property at the time of the contribution. However, if the property has increased in value, you may have to make some adjustments to the amount of your deduction. See Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later.\n\nFor information about the records you must keep and the information you must furnish with your return if you donate property, see Substantiation Requirements and How To Report, later.\n\nContributions Subject to Special Rules\n\nSpecial rules apply if you contribute:\n\nClothing or household items;\n\nA car, boat, or airplane;\n\nTaxidermy property;\n\nProperty subject to a debt;\n\nA partial interest in property;\n\nA fractional interest in tangible personal property;\n\nA qualified conservation contribution;\n\nA future interest in tangible personal property;\n\nInventory from your business; or\n\nA patent or other intellectual property.\n\nThese special rules are described next.\n\nClothing and Household Items\n\nYou can't take a deduction for clothing or household items you donate unless the clothing or household items are in good used condition or better.\n\nException.\n\nYou can take a deduction for a contribution of an item of clothing or a household item that isn't in good used condition or better if you deduct more than $500 for it, and include a qualified appraisal prepared by a qualified appraiser and a completed Form 8283, Section B.\n\nHousehold items.\n\nHousehold items include:\n\nFurniture and furnishings,\n\nElectronics,\n\nAppliances,\n\nLinens, and\n\nOther similar items.\n\nHousehold items don't include:\n\nFood;\n\nPaintings, antiques, and other objects of art;\n\nJewelry and gems; and\n\nCollections.\n\nFMV.\n\nTo determine the FMV of these items, use the rules under Determining FMV, later.\n\nCars, Boats, and Airplanes\n\nThe following rules apply to any donation of a qualified vehicle.\n\nA qualified vehicle is:\n\nA car or any motor vehicle manufactured mainly for use on public streets, roads, and highways;\n\nA boat; or\n\nAn airplane.\n\nDeduction more than $500.\n\nIf you donate a qualified vehicle with a claimed FMV of more than $500, you can deduct the smaller of:\n\nThe gross proceeds from the sale of the vehicle by the organization, or\n\nThe vehicle's FMV on the date of the contribution. If the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to figure the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later.\n\nForm 1098-C.\n\nYou must attach to your return Copy B of the Form 1098-C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes, (or other statement containing the same information as Form 1098-C) you received from the organization. The Form 1098-C (or other statement) will show the gross proceeds from the sale of the vehicle.\n\nIf you e-file your return, you must:\n\nAttach Copy B of Form 1098-C to Form 8453, U.S. Individual Income Tax Transmittal for an IRS e-file Return, and mail the forms to the IRS; or\n\nInclude Copy B of Form 1098-C as a pdf attachment if your software program allows it.\n\nIf you don't attach Form 1098-C (or other statement), you can't deduct your contribution.\n\nYou must get Form 1098-C (or other statement) within 30 days of the sale of the vehicle. But if Exception 1 or 2 (described later) applies, you must get Form 1098-C (or other statement) within 30 days of your donation.\n\nFiling deadline approaching and still no Form 1098-C.\n\nIf the filing deadline is approaching and you still don't have a Form 1098-C, you have two choices.\n\nRequest an automatic 6-month extension of time to file your return. You can get this extension by filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 4868.\n\nFile the return on time without claiming the deduction for the qualified vehicle. After receiving the Form 1098-C, file an amended return, Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, claiming the deduction. Attach Copy B of Form 1098-C (or other statement) to the amended return.\n\nExceptions.\n\nThere are two exceptions to the rules just described for deductions of more than $500.\n\nException 1—Vehicle used or improved by organization.\n\nIf the qualified organization makes a significant intervening use of, or material improvement to, the vehicle before transferring it, you can generally deduct the vehicle's FMV at the time of the contribution. But if the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to get the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later. The Form 1098-C (or other statement) will show whether this exception applies.\n\nException 2—Vehicle given or sold to needy individual.\n\nIf the qualified organization will give the vehicle, or sell it for a price well below FMV, to a needy individual to further the organization's charitable purpose, you can generally deduct the vehicle's FMV at the time of the contribution. But if the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to get the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later. The Form 1098-C (or other statement) will show whether this exception applies.\n\nThis exception doesn't apply if the organization sells the vehicle at auction. In that case, you can't deduct the vehicle's FMV.\n\nExample.\n\nYou donate a used car to a qualified organization. You bought it 3 years ago for $9,000. A used car guide shows the FMV for this type of car is $6,000. However, you get a Form 1098-C from the organization showing the car was sold for $2,900. Neither Exception 1 nor Exception 2 applies. If you itemize your deductions, you can deduct $2,900 for the donation. You must attach Form 1098-C and Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions, to your tax return.\n\nDeduction $500 or less.\n\nIf the qualified organization sells the vehicle for $500 or less and Exceptions 1 and 2 don't apply, you can deduct the smaller of:\n\n$500, or\n\nThe vehicle's FMV on the date of the contribution. But if the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to get the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later.\n\nIf the vehicle's FMV is at least $250 but not more than $500, you must have a written statement from the qualified organization acknowledging your donation. The statement must contain the information and meet the tests for an acknowledgment described under Deductions of at Least $250 but Not More Than $500 under Substantiation Requirements, later.\n\nFMV.\n\nTo determine a vehicle's FMV, use the rules described under Determining FMV, later.\n\nDonations of inventory.\n\nThe vehicle donation rules just described don't apply to donations of inventory. For example, these rules don't apply if you are a car dealer who donates a car you had been holding for sale to customers. See Inventory, later.\n\nTaxidermy Property\n\nIf you donate taxidermy property to a qualified organization, your deduction is limited to your basis in the property or its FMV, whichever is less. This applies if you prepared, stuffed, or mounted the property or paid or incurred the cost of preparing, stuffing, or mounting the property.\n\nYour basis for this purpose includes only the cost of preparing, stuffing, and mounting the property. Your basis doesn't include transportation or travel costs. It also doesn't include the direct or indirect costs for hunting or killing an animal, such as equipment costs. In addition, it doesn't include the value of your time.\n\nTaxidermy property means any work of art that:\n\nIs the reproduction or preservation of an animal, in whole or in part;\n\nIs prepared, stuffed, or mounted to recreate one or more characteristics of the animal; and\n\nContains a part of the body of the dead animal.\n\nProperty Subject to a Debt\n\nIf you contribute property subject to a debt (such as a mortgage), you must reduce the FMV of the property by:\n\nAny allowable deduction for interest you paid (or will pay) that is attributable to any period after the contribution, and\n\nIf the property is a bond, the lesser of:\n\nAny allowable deduction for interest you paid (or will pay) to buy or carry the bond that is attributable to any period before the contribution; or\n\nThe interest, including bond discount, receivable on the bond that is attributable to any period before the contribution, and that isn't includible in your income due to your accounting method.\n\nThis prevents you from deducting the same amount as both investment interest and a charitable contribution.\n\nIf the recipient (or another person) assumes the debt, you must also reduce the FMV of the property by the amount of the outstanding debt assumed.\n\nThe amount of the debt is also treated as an amount realized on the sale or exchange of property for purposes of figuring your taxable gain (if any). For more information, see Bargain Sales under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value, later.\n\nPartial Interest in Property\n\nGenerally, you can't deduct a charitable contribution of less than your entire interest in property.\n\nRight to use property.\n\nA contribution of the right to use property is a contribution of less than your entire interest in that property and isn't deductible.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou own a 10-story office building and donate rent-free use of the top floor to a qualified organization. Because you still own the building, you have contributed a partial interest in the property and can't take a deduction for the contribution.\n\nExample 2.\n\nYou own a vacation home at the beach and sometimes rent it to others. For a fundraising auction at church, you donated the right to use the vacation home for 1 week. At the auction, the church received and accepted a bid equal to the fair rental value of the home for 1 week. You can't claim a deduction because of the partial interest rule. The auction winner can't claim a deduction either, because of the received benefit equal to the amount of the auction winner’s payment. See Contributions From Which You Benefit, earlier.\n\nExceptions.\n\nYou can deduct a charitable contribution of a partial interest in property only if that interest represents one of the following items.\n\nA remainder interest in your personal home or farm. A remainder interest is one that passes to a beneficiary after the end of an earlier interest in the property.\n\nExample. You keep the right to live in your home during your lifetime and give your church a remainder interest that begins upon your death. You can deduct the value of the remainder interest.\n\nAn undivided part of your entire interest. This must consist of a part of every substantial interest or right you own in the property and must last as long as your interest in the property lasts. But see Fractional Interest in Tangible Personal Property, later.\n\nExample. You contribute voting stock to a qualified organization but keep the right to vote the stock. The right to vote is a substantial right in the stock. You haven't contributed an undivided part of your entire interest and can't deduct your contribution.\n\nA partial interest that would be deductible if transferred to certain types of trusts.\n\nA qualified conservation contribution (defined later).\n\nFor information about how to figure the value of a contribution of a partial interest in property, see Partial Interest in Property Not in Trust in Pub. 561.\n\nFractional Interest in Tangible Personal Property\n\nYou can't deduct a charitable contribution of a fractional interest in tangible personal property unless all interests in the property are held immediately before the contribution by:\n\nYou, or\n\nYou and the qualifying organization receiving the contribution.\n\nIf you make an additional contribution later, the FMV of that contribution will be determined by using the smaller of:\n\nThe FMV of the property at the time of the initial contribution, or\n\nThe FMV of the property at the time of the additional contribution.\n\nTangible personal property is defined later under Future Interest in Tangible Personal Property. A fractional interest in property is an undivided portion of your entire interest in the property.\n\nExample.\n\nAn undivided one-quarter interest in a painting that entitles an art museum to possession of the painting for 3 months of each year is a fractional interest in the property.\n\nRecapture of deduction.\n\nYou must recapture your charitable contribution deduction by including it in your income if both of the following statements are true.\n\nYou contributed a fractional interest in tangible personal property after August 17, 2006.\n\nYou don't contribute the rest of your interests in the property to the original recipient or, if it no longer exists, another qualified organization on or before the earlier of:\n\nThe date that is 10 years after the date of the initial contribution, or\n\nThe date of your death.\n\nRecapture is also required if the qualified organization hasn't taken substantial physical possession of the property and used it in a way related to the organization's purpose during the period beginning on the date of the initial contribution and ending on the earlier of:\n\nThe date that is 10 years after the date of the initial contribution, or\n\nThe date of your death.\n\nAdditional tax.\n\nIf you must recapture your deduction, you must also pay interest and an additional tax equal to 10% of the amount recaptured.\n\nQualified Conservation Contribution\n\nA qualified conservation contribution is a contribution of a qualified real property interest to a qualified organization to be used only for conservation purposes.\n\nQualified organization.\n\nFor purposes of a qualified conservation contribution, a qualified organization is:\n\nA governmental unit;\n\nA publicly supported charity; or\n\nAn organization controlled by, and operated for the exclusive benefit of, a governmental unit or a publicly supported charity.\n\nThe organization must also have the resources to monitor and enforce the conservation easement or other conservation restrictions. To enable the organization to do this, it must have documents such as maps and photographs that establish the condition of the property at the time of donation.\n\nA publicly supported charity is an organization of the type described in (1) under Types of Qualified Organizations, earlier, that normally receives a substantial part of its support, other than income from its exempt activities, from direct or indirect contributions from the general public or from governmental units.\n\nQualified real property interest.\n\nThis is any of the following interests in real property.\n\nYour entire interest in real estate other than a mineral interest (subsurface oil, gas, or other minerals, and the right of access to these minerals).\n\nA remainder interest.\n\nA restriction (granted in perpetuity) on the use that may be made of the real property, such as a conservation easement.\n\nConservation purposes.\n\nYour contribution must be made only for one of the following conservation purposes.\n\nPreserving land areas for outdoor recreation by, or for the education of, the general public.\n\nProtecting a relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or a similar ecosystem.\n\nPreserving open space, including farmland and forest land, if it yields a significant public benefit. The open space must be preserved either for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or under a clearly defined federal, state, or local governmental conservation policy.\n\nPreserving a historically important land area or a certified historic structure.\n\nCertified historic structures.\n\nA certified historic structure is a building that is listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (National Register building) or a building that is located in a registered historic district and has been certified by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historic significance of that district (historically significant building). If the individual listing in the National Register of Historic Places consists of a more than one building (e.g., a house, a garage, a mill complex, etc.), the Secretary of the Interior may have to certify which of the multiple buildings qualify as certified historic structures.\n\nA registered historic district is any district listed in the National Register of Historic Places. A state or local historic district may also qualify as a registered historic district if the district and the enabling structures are certified by the Secretary of the Interior. You can claim a deduction for a qualified conservation contribution of a historically significant building. This contribution can take the form of a qualified real property interest that is an easement or other restriction on all or part of the exterior or interior of the building. You can claim a deduction for a qualified conservation contribution of a historically significant building. This contribution can take the form of a contribution of a qualified real property interest that is an easement or other restriction on all or part of the interior of the building. However, you cannot claim a deduction for a contribution of a qualified real property interest that is an easement or other restriction on the exterior of the building unless the easement or other restriction meets all of the following conditions:\n\nThe restriction must preserve the entire exterior of the building (including its front, sides, rear, and height) and must prohibit any change to the exterior of the building that is inconsistent with its historical character.\n\nYou and the organization receiving the contribution must enter into a written agreement certifying, under penalty of perjury, that the organization:\n\nIs a qualified organization with a purpose of environmental protection, land conservation, open space preservation, or historic preservation; and\n\nHas the resources to manage and enforce the restriction and a commitment to do so.\n\nYou must include with your return:\n\nForm 8283, completed as specified in the instructions to Form 8283;\n\nA signed Qualified appraisal, performed by a Qualified appraiser;\n\nPhotographs of the building's entire exterior;\n\nA description of all restrictions on development of the building, such as zoning laws and restrictive covenants; and\n\nThe National Park Service project number (NPS #), if applicable. See the Form 8283 instructions for more information.\n\nIf you claim a deduction of more than $10,000 and donated an exterior restriction on a National Register building or historic district building, your deduction won’t be allowed unless you pay a $500 filing fee. See Form 8283-V, Payment Voucher for Filing Fee Under Section 170(f)(13), and its instructions.\n\nIf you claimed the rehabilitation credit for a National Register building or historically significant building for any of the 5 years before the year of the qualified conservation contribution, your charitable deduction is reduced. For more information, see Form 3468, Investment Credit, and Internal Revenue Code section 170(f)(14). For more information on how an NPS # applies to a certified historic structure, see Easements on certified historic structures, in the instructions for Form 8283.\n\nDisallowance of deductions for certain conservation contributions by pass-through entities.\n\nSubject to three exceptions, if you are a member of a pass-through entity (such as a partner in a partnership or a shareholder in an S corporation) and the amount of a qualified conservation contribution by the pass-through entity exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each member’s relevant basis, the contribution is not treated as a qualified conservation contribution and no one may claim a deduction for the contribution. Thus, your charitable conservation contribution deduction is disallowed.\n\nThe pass-through entity must determine each member’s relevant basis. Relevant basis is, with respect to any member, the portion of the member’s modified basis in its interest in the pass-through entity which is allocable to the portion of the real property with respect to which the qualified conservation contribution is made. Modified basis is, with respect to any member, the adjusted basis in the member’s interest in the pass-through entity as determined:\n\nimmediately before the qualified conservation contribution;\n\nwithout regard to the member’s share of any liabilities of the pass-through entity; and\n\nby the pass-through entity after taking into account the adjustments described in items (1) and (2).\n\nExceptions.\n\nAs before mentioned, there are three exceptions to this disallowance.\n\nException 1—Contribution outside three-year period. This disallowance does not apply if the qualified conservation contribution is made at least three years after the latest of:\n\nthe last date on which the pass-through entity acquired any portion of the real property;\n\nthe last date any members of the pass-through entity acquired any interest in the pass-through entity; and\n\nif the interest in the donating pass-through entity is held through one or more pass-through entities:\n\nthe last date any such pass-through entity acquired any interest in any other such pass-through entity, and\n\nthe last date on which any member in any such pass-through entity acquired any interest in such pass-through entity.\n\nException 2—Family partnership. This disallowance does not apply to a qualified conservation contribution made by a family pass-through entity. Family pass-through entities are pass-through entities in which substantially all of the interests are held, directly or indirectly, by an individual and members of the family of such individual. For these purposes, members of the family are defined as the spouse of such individual and any individual described in Internal Revenue Code section 152(d)(2)(A)–(G).\n\nException 3—Historic structure. This disallowance does not apply if the purpose of the qualified conservation contribution is the preservation of a certified historic structure. See Certified historic structures, earlier.\n\nMore information.\n\nFor information about determining the FMV of qualified conservation contributions, see Pub. 561 and the instructions for Form 8283. For information about the limits that apply to deductions for this type of contribution, see Limits on Deductions, later. For more information about qualified conservation contributions, see Regulations section 1.170A-14.\n\nFuture Interest in Tangible Personal Property\n\nYou can't deduct the value of a charitable contribution of a future interest in tangible personal property until all intervening interests in and rights to the actual possession or enjoyment of the property have either expired or been turned over to someone other than yourself, a related person, or a related organization. But see Fractional Interest in Tangible Personal Property, earlier, and Tangible personal property put to unrelated use, later.\n\nRelated persons include your spouse, children, grandchildren, sibling(s), and parents. Related organizations may include a partnership or corporation in which you have an interest, or an estate or trust with which you have a connection.\n\nTangible personal property.\n\nThis is any property, other than land or buildings, that can be seen or touched. It includes furniture, books, jewelry, paintings, and cars.\n\nFuture interest.\n\nThis is any interest that is to begin at some future time, regardless of whether it is designated as a future interest under state law.\n\nExample.\n\nYou own an antique car that you contribute to a museum. You give up ownership, but retain the right to keep the car in your garage with your personal collection. Because you keep an interest in the property, you can't deduct the contribution. If you turn the car over to the museum in a later year, giving up all rights to its use, possession, and enjoyment, you can take a deduction for the contribution in that later year.\n\nIf you contribute inventory (property you sell in the course of your business), the amount you can deduct is the smaller of its FMV on the day you contributed it or its basis. The basis of contributed inventory is any cost incurred for the inventory in an earlier year that you would otherwise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your charitable contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It isn't part of the cost of goods sold.\n\nIf the cost of donated inventory isn't included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you can't claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the purchase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year.\n\nA special rule applies to certain donations of food inventory. See Food Inventory, later.\n\nPatents and Other Intellectual Property\n\nIf you donate intellectual property to a qualified organization, your deduction is limited to the basis of the property or the FMV of the property, whichever is smaller. Intellectual property means any of the following.\n\nPatents.\n\nCopyrights (other than a copyright described in Internal Revenue Code sections 1221(a)(3) or 1231(b)(1)(C)).\n\nTrademarks.\n\nTrade names.\n\nTrade secrets.\n\nKnow-how.\n\nSoftware (other than software described in Internal Revenue Code section 197(e)(3)(A)(i)).\n\nOther similar property or applications or registrations of such property.\n\nAdditional deduction based on income.\n\nYou may be able to claim additional charitable contribution deductions in the year of the contribution and years following, based on the income, if any, from the donated property.\n\nThe following table shows the percentage of income from the property that you can deduct for each of your tax years ending on or after the date of the contribution. In the table, “tax year 1,” for example, means your first tax year ending on or after the date of the contribution. However, you can take the additional deduction only to the extent the total of the amounts figured using this table is more than the amount of the deduction claimed for the original donation of the property.\n\nAfter the legal life of the intellectual property ends, or after the 10th anniversary of the donation, whichever is earlier, no additional deduction is allowed.\n\nThe additional deductions can't be taken for intellectual property donated to certain private foundations.\n\nTax year Deductible percentage 1 100% 2 100% 3 90% 4 80% 5 70% 6 60% 7 50% 8 40% 9 30% 10 20% 11 10% 12 10%\n\nReporting requirements.\n\nYou must inform the organization at the time of the donation that you intend to treat the donation as a contribution subject to the provisions just discussed.\n\nThe organization is required to file an information return showing the income from the property, with a copy to you. This is done on Form 8899, Notice of Income From Donated Intellectual Property.\n\nDetermining FMV\n\nThis section discusses general guidelines for determining the FMV of various types of donated property. Pub. 561 contains a more complete discussion.\n\nFMV is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of all the relevant facts.\n\nUsed clothing.\n\nThe FMV of used clothing and other personal items is usually far less than the price you paid for them. There are no fixed formulas or methods for finding the value of items of clothing.\n\nYou should claim as the value the price that buyers of used items actually pay in used clothing stores, such as consignment or thrift shops.\n\nAlso see Clothing and Household Items, earlier.\n\nExample.\n\nYou donated a coat to a thrift store operated by a place of worship. You paid $300 for the coat 3 years ago. Similar coats in the thrift store sell for $50. The FMV of the coat is $50. Your donation is limited to $50.\n\nHousehold items.\n\nThe FMV of used household items, such as furniture, appliances, and linens, is usually much lower than the price paid when new. These items may have little or no market value because they are in a worn condition, out of style, or no longer useful. For these reasons, formulas (such as using a percentage of the cost to buy a new replacement item) aren't acceptable in determining value.\n\nYou should support your valuation with photographs, canceled checks, receipts from your purchase of the items, or other evidence. Magazine or newspaper articles and photographs that describe the items and statements by the recipients of the items are also useful. Don't include any of this evidence with your tax return.\n\nIf the property is valuable because it is old or unique, see the discussion under Paintings, Antiques, and Other Objects of Art in Pub. 561.\n\nAlso see Clothing and Household Items, earlier.\n\nArticle of clothing or household item over $500 not in good used condition.\n\nForm 8283, Section B, must be completed and the Form 8283 attached to the tax return if you are contributing a single article of clothing or household item over $500 that is not in good used condition. See the Form 8283 instructions for more information.\n\nCars, boats, and airplanes.\n\nIf you contribute a car, boat, or airplane to a qualified organization, you must determine its FMV.\n\nQualified vehicle donation.\n\nYou don’t need a written appraisal for a qualified vehicle — such as a car, boat, or airplane — if your deduction for the qualified vehicle is limited to the gross proceeds from its sale and you obtained a contemporaneous written acknowledgment (CWA), defined later. If you donate a qualified vehicle with a claimed value of more than $500, you can’t claim a deduction unless you attach to Form 8283 a copy of the CWA you received from the donee organization. See Qualified Vehicle Donations in the Instructions for Form 8283.\n\nBoats.\n\nExcept for small, inexpensive boats, the valuation of boats should be based on an appraisal by a marine surveyor or appraiser because the physical condition is critical to the value.\n\nCars.\n\nCertain commercial firms and trade organizations publish used car pricing guides, commonly called “blue books,” containing complete dealer sale prices or dealer average prices for recent model years. The guides may be published monthly or seasonally, and for different regions of the country. These guides also provide estimates for adjusting for unusual equipment, unusual mileage, and physical condition. The prices aren't “official” and these publications aren't considered an appraisal of any specific donated property. But they do provide clues for making an appraisal and suggest relative prices for comparison with current sales and offerings in your area.\n\nThese publications are sometimes available from public libraries, or from the loan officer at a bank, credit union, or finance company. You can also find used car pricing information on the Internet.\n\nTo find the FMV of a donated car, use the price listed in a used car guide for a private party sale, not the dealer retail value. However, the FMV may be less if the car has engine trouble, body damage, high mileage, or any type of excessive wear. The FMV of a donated car is the same as the price listed in a used car guide for a private party sale only if the guide lists a sales price for a car that is the same make, model, and year, sold in the same area, in the same condition, with the same or similar options or accessories, and with the same or similar warranties as the donated car.\n\nExample.\n\nYou donate a used car in poor condition to a local high school for use by students studying car repair. A used car guide shows the dealer retail value for this type of car in poor condition is $1,600. However, the guide shows the price for a private party sale of the car is only $750. The FMV of the car is considered to be $750.\n\nLarge quantities.\n\nIf you contribute a large number of the same item, FMV is the price at which comparable numbers of the item are being sold.\n\nExample.\n\nYou purchase 500 copies of a religious book for $1,000. The person who sells them to you says the retail value of these books is $3,000. If you contribute the books to a qualified organization, you can claim a deduction only for the price at which similar numbers of the same books are currently being sold. Your charitable contribution is $1,000, unless you can show that similar numbers of that book were selling at a different price at the time of the contribution.\n\nGiving Property That Has Decreased in Value\n\nIf you contribute property with an FMV that is less than your basis in it, your deduction is limited to its FMV. You can't claim a deduction for the difference between the property's basis and its FMV.\n\nYour basis in property is generally what you paid for it. If you need more information about basis, see Pub. 551, Basis of Assets. You may want to see Pub. 551 if you contribute property that you:\n\nReceived as a gift or inheritance;\n\nUsed in a trade, business, or activity conducted for profit; or\n\nClaimed a casualty loss deduction for.\n\nCommon examples of property that decrease in value include clothing, furniture, appliances, and cars.\n\nGiving Property That Has Increased in Value\n\nIf you contribute property with an FMV that is more than your basis in it, you may have to reduce the FMV by the amount of appreciation (increase in value) when you figure your deduction.\n\nYour basis in property is generally what you paid for it. If you need more information about basis, see Pub. 551.\n\nDifferent rules apply to figuring your deduction, depending on whether the property is:\n\nOrdinary income property, or\n\nCapital gain property.\n\nOrdinary Income Property\n\nProperty is ordinary income property if you would have recognized ordinary income or short-term capital gain had you sold it at FMV on the date it was contributed. Examples of ordinary income property are inventory, works of art created by the donor, manuscripts prepared by the donor, and capital assets (defined later, under Capital Gain Property) held 1 year or less.\n\nProperty used in a trade or business.\n\nProperty used in a trade or business is considered ordinary income property to the extent of any gain that would have been treated as ordinary income because of depreciation had the property been sold at its FMV at the time of contribution. See chapter 3 of Pub. 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for the kinds of property to which this rule applies.\n\nAmount of deduction.\n\nThe amount you can deduct for a contribution of ordinary income property is its FMV minus the amount that would be ordinary income or short-term capital gain if you sold the property for its FMV. Generally, this rule limits the deduction to your basis in the property.\n\nExample.\n\nYou donate stock you held for 5 months to your synagogue. The FMV of the stock on the day you donate it is $1,000, but you paid only $800 (your basis). Because the $200 of appreciation would be short-term capital gain if you sold the stock, your deduction is limited to $800 (FMV minus the appreciation).\n\nException.\n\nDon't reduce your charitable contribution if you include the ordinary or capital gain income in your gross income in the same year as the contribution. See Ordinary or capital gain income included in gross income under Capital Gain Property next, if you need more information.\n\nCapital Gain Property\n\nProperty is capital gain property if you would have recognized long-term capital gain had you sold it at FMV on the date of the contribution. Capital gain property includes capital assets held more than 1 year.\n\nCapital assets.\n\nCapital assets include most items of property you own and use for personal purposes or investment. Examples of capital assets are stocks, bonds, jewelry, coin or stamp collections, and cars or furniture used for personal purposes.\n\nFor purposes of figuring your charitable contribution, capital assets also include certain real property and depreciable property used in your trade or business and, generally, held more than 1 year. You may, however, have to treat this property as partly ordinary income property and partly capital gain property. See Property used in a trade or business under Ordinary Income Property, earlier.\n\nReal property.\n\nReal property is land and generally anything built on, growing on, or attached to land.\n\nDepreciable property.\n\nDepreciable property is property used in business or held for the production of income and for which a depreciation deduction is allowed.\n\nFor more information about what is a capital asset, see chapter 2 of Pub. 544.\n\nAmount of deduction—General rule.\n\nWhen figuring your deduction for a contribution of capital gain property, you can generally use the FMV of the property.\n\nExceptions.\n\nHowever, in certain situations, you must reduce the FMV by any amount that would have been long-term capital gain if you had sold the property for its FMV. Generally, this means reducing the FMV to the property's cost or other basis. You must do this if:\n\nThe property (other than qualified appreciated stock) is contributed to certain private nonoperating foundations,\n\nYou choose the 50% limit instead of the 30% limit for capital gain property given to 50% limit organizations, discussed later,\n\nThe contributed property is intellectual property (as defined earlier under Patents and Other Intellectual Property),\n\nThe contributed property is certain taxidermy property, as explained earlier, or\n\nThe contributed property is tangible personal property (defined earlier) that:\n\nIs put to an unrelated use (defined later) by the charity, or\n\nHas a claimed value of more than $5,000 and is sold, traded, or otherwise disposed of by the qualified organization during the year in which you made the contribution, and the qualified organization hasn't made the required certification of exempt use (such as on Form 8282, Donee Information Return, Part IV). See also Recapture if no exempt use, later.\n\nContributions to private nonoperating foundations.\n\nThe reduced deduction applies to contributions to all private nonoperating foundations other than those qualifying for the 50% limit, discussed later.\n\nHowever, the reduced deduction doesn't apply to contributions of qualified appreciated stock. Qualified appreciated stock is any stock in a corporation that is capital gain property and for which market quotations are readily available on an established securities market on the day of the contribution. But stock in a corporation doesn't count as qualified appreciated stock to the extent you and your family contributed more than 10% of the value of all the outstanding stock in the corporation.\n\nTangible personal property put to unrelated use.\n\nTangible personal property is defined earlier under Future Interest in Tangible Personal Property.\n\nUnrelated use.\n\nThe term “unrelated use” means a use unrelated to the exempt purpose or function of the qualified organization. For a governmental unit, it means the use of the contributed property for other than exclusively public purposes.\n\nExample.\n\nIf a painting contributed to an educational institution is used by that organization for educational purposes by being placed in its library for display and study by art students, the use isn't an unrelated use. But if the painting is sold and the proceeds are used by the organization for educational purposes, the use is an unrelated use.\n\nDeduction limited.\n\nYour deduction for a contribution of tangible personal property may be limited. See (5) under Exceptions, earlier.\n\nRecapture if no exempt use.\n\nYou must recapture part of your charitable contribution deduction by including it in your income if all the following statements are true.\n\nYou donate tangible personal property with a claimed value of more than $5,000, and your deduction is more than your basis in the property.\n\nThe organization sells, trades, or otherwise disposes of the property after the year it was contributed but within 3 years of the contribution.\n\nThe organization doesn't provide a written statement (such as on Form 8282, Part IV), signed by an officer of the organization under penalty of perjury, that either:\n\nCertifies its use of the property was substantial and related to the organization's purpose, or\n\nCertifies its intended use of the property became impossible.\n\nIf all the preceding statements are true, include in your income:\n\nThe deduction you claimed for the property, minus\n\nYour basis in the property when you made the contribution.\n\nInclude this amount in your income for the year the qualified organization disposes of the property. Report the recaptured amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.\n\nOrdinary or capital gain income included in gross income.\n\nYou don't reduce your charitable contribution if you include the ordinary or capital gain income in your gross income in the same year as the contribution. This may happen when you transfer installment or discount obligations or when you assign income to a qualified organization. If you contribute an obligation received in a sale of property that is reported under the installment method, see Pub. 537, Installment Sales.\n\nExample.\n\nYou donate an installment note to a qualified organization. The note has an FMV of $10,000 and a basis to you of $7,000. As a result of the donation, you have a short-term capital gain of $3,000 ($10,000 − $7,000), which you include in your income for the year. Your charitable contribution is $10,000.\n\nFood Inventory\n\nSpecial rules apply to certain donations of food inventory to a qualified organization. These rules apply if all the following conditions are met.\n\nYou made a contribution of apparently wholesome food from your trade or business. Apparently wholesome food is food intended for human consumption that meets all quality and labeling standards imposed by federal, state, and local laws and regulations even though the food may not be readily marketable due to appearance, age, freshness, grade, size, surplus, or other conditions.\n\nThe food is to be used only for the care of the ill, the needy, or infants.\n\nThe use of the food is related to the organization's exempt purpose or function.\n\nThe organization doesn't transfer the food for money, other property, or services.\n\nYou receive a written statement from the organization stating it will comply with requirements (2), (3), and (4).\n\nThe organization isn't a private nonoperating foundation.\n\nThe food satisfies any applicable requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations on the date of transfer and for the previous 180 days.\n\nIf all the conditions just described are met, use the following worksheet to figure your deduction.\n\nWorksheet 1. Donations of Food Inventory See separate Worksheet instructions. (Keep for your records) 1. Enter FMV of the\n\ndonated food _____ 2. Enter basis of the donated\n\nfood _____ 3. Subtract line 2 from line 1.\n\nIf the result is zero or less, stop here. Don't complete the rest of this worksheet. Your charitable contribution deduction for food is the amount on line 1 _____ 4. Enter one-half of line 3 _____ 5. Subtract line 4 from line 1 _____ 6. Multiply line 2 by 2.0 _____ 7. Subtract line 6 from line 5. If the result is less than zero, enter -0- _____ 8. Add lines 4 and 7 _____ 9. Compare line 3 and line 8. Enter the smaller amount _____ 10. Subtract line 9 from line 1 _____ 11. Enter 15% of your total net\n\nincome for the year from\n\nall trades or businesses\n\nfrom which food\n\ninventory was donated _____ 12. Compare line 10 and line 11.\n\nEnter the smaller amount.\n\nThis is your charitable\n\ncontribution deduction\n\nfor the food _____\n\nWorksheet instructions.\n\nWhen determining the FMV to enter on line 1 of the worksheet, take into account the price at which the same or substantially the same food items (as to both type and quality) were sold by you at the time of the contribution. Don’t reduce this amount because the food wasn’t or couldn’t be sold by reason of your internal standards, lack of market, or similar circumstances. Also, don’t reduce this amount even though you produced the food exclusively for the purpose of transferring the food to a qualified organization.\n\nIf you don’t account for inventories under section 471 and you aren’t required to capitalize indirect costs under section 263A, you may elect, solely for the purpose of line 2 of the worksheet, to treat the basis of any apparently wholesome food as being equal to 25% of the FMV of such food.\n\nEnter on line 11 of the worksheet, 15% of your net income for the year from all sole proprietorships, S corporations, or partnerships (or other entity that isn't a C corporation) from which contributions of food inventory were made. Figure net income before any deduction for a charitable contribution of food inventory.\n\nIf you made more than one contribution of food inventory, complete a separate worksheet for each contribution. Complete lines 11 and 12 on only one worksheet. On that worksheet, complete line 11. Then compare line 11 and the total of the line 10 amounts on all worksheets and enter the smaller of those amounts on line 12.\n\nIf line 11 is smaller than line 10, you can carry over the excess as a qualifying food inventory contribution to the following year. You may be able to include the excess in your charitable contribution deduction for the food in each of the next 5 years in order of time until it is used up, but not beyond that time.\n\nMore information.\n\nSee Inventory, earlier, for information about determining the basis of donated inventory and the effect on cost of goods sold. For additional details, see section 170(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nBargain Sales\n\nA bargain sale of property is a sale or exchange for less than the property's FMV. A bargain sale to a qualified organization is partly a charitable contribution and partly a sale or exchange.\n\nPart that is a sale or exchange.\n\nThe part of the bargain sale that is a sale or exchange may result in a taxable gain. For more information on figuring the amount of any taxable gain, see Bargain sales to charity in chapter 1 of Pub. 544.\n\nPart that is a charitable contribution.\n\nFigure the amount of your charitable contribution in three steps.\n\nStep 1.\n\nSubtract the amount you received for the property from the property's FMV at the time of sale. This gives you the FMV of the contributed part.\n\nStep 2.\n\nFind the adjusted basis of the contributed part. It equals:\n\nCalculation\n\nCalculation\n\nSummary: This is the calculation used to figure the adjusted basis of the contributable amount of property. To calculate: Multiply the Adjusted basis of entire property by (the FMV of contributed part divided by the FMV of entire property).\n\nPlease click here for the text description of the image.\n\nStep 3.\n\nDetermine whether the amount of your charitable contribution is the FMV of the contributed part (which you found in Step 1) or the adjusted basis of the contributed part (which you found in Step 2). Generally, if the property sold was capital gain property, your charitable contribution is the FMV of the contributed part. If it was ordinary income property, your charitable contribution is the adjusted basis of the contributed part. See Ordinary Income Property and Capital Gain Property, both earlier, for more information.\n\nExample.\n\nYou sell ordinary income property with an FMV of $10,000 to a mosque for $2,000. Your basis is $4,000 and your AGI is $20,000. You make no other contributions during the year. The FMV of the contributed part of the property is $8,000 ($10,000 − $2,000). The adjusted basis of the contributed part is $3,200 ($4,000 × ($8,000 ÷ $10,000)). Because the property is ordinary income property, your charitable deduction is limited to the adjusted basis of the contributed part. You can deduct $3,200.\n\nPenalty\n\nYou may be liable for a penalty if you overstate the value or adjusted basis of contributed property.\n\n20% penalty.\n\nThe penalty is 20% of the amount by which you underpaid your tax because of the overstatement, if:\n\nThe value or adjusted basis claimed on your return is 150% or more of the correct amount, and\n\nYou underpaid your tax by more than $5,000 because of the overstatement.\n\nWhen To Deduct\n\nYou can deduct your contributions only in the year you actually make them in cash or other property (or in a later carryover year, as explained under How To Figure Your Deduction When Limits Apply, later). This applies whether you use the cash or an accrual method of accounting.\n\nTime of making contribution.\n\nUsually, you make a contribution at the time of its unconditional delivery.\n\nChecks.\n\nA check you mail to a charity is considered delivered on the date you mail it.\n\nText message.\n\nContributions made by text message are deductible in the year you send the text message if the contribution is charged to your telephone or wireless account.\n\nCredit card.\n\nContributions charged on your bank credit card are deductible in the year you make the charge.\n\nPay-by-phone account.\n\nContributions made through a pay-by-phone account are considered delivered on the date the financial institution pays the amount. This date should be shown on the statement the financial institution sends you.\n\nStock certificate.\n\nA properly endorsed stock certificate is considered delivered on the date of mailing or other delivery to the charity or to the charity's agent. However, if you give a stock certificate to your agent or to the issuing corporation for transfer to the name of the charity, your contribution isn't delivered until the date the stock is transferred on the books of the corporation.\n\nPromissory note.\n\nIf you issue and deliver a promissory note to a charity as a contribution, it isn't a contribution until you make the note payments.\n\nOption.\n\nIf you grant a charity an option to buy real property at a bargain price, it isn't a contribution until the charity exercises the option.\n\nBorrowed funds.\n\nIf you contribute borrowed funds, you can deduct the contribution in the year you deliver the funds to the charity, regardless of when you repay the loan.\n\nConditional gift.\n\nIf your contribution depends on a future act or event to become effective, you can't take a deduction unless there is only a negligible chance the act or event won't take place.\n\nIf your contribution would be undone by a later act or event, you can't take a deduction unless there is only a negligible chance the act or event will take place.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou contribute cash to a local school board, which is a political subdivision of a state, to help build a school gym. The school board will refund the money to you if it doesn't collect enough to build the gym. You can't deduct your contribution until there is no chance (or only a negligible chance) of a refund.\n\nLimits on Deductions\n\n. If your total contributions for the year are 20% or less of your AGI, you don't need to read the rest of this section. The remaining limits discussed in this section don't apply to you..\n\nThe amount you can deduct for charitable contributions is generally limited to no more than 60% of your AGI. Your deduction may be further limited to 50%, 30%, or 20% of your AGI, depending on the type of property you give and the type of organization you give it to. Starting with tax year 2022, your deduction for cash contributions is limited to 60% of your AGI minus your deductions for all other contributions. These limits are described in detail in this section.\n\nYour AGI is the amount on Form 1040, line 11.\n\nIf your contributions are more than any of the limits that apply, see Carryovers under How To Figure Your Deduction When Limits Apply, later.\n\nOut-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAmounts you spend performing services for a charitable organization may be deductible as a contribution to a qualified organization. If so, your deduction is subject to the limit applicable to donations to that organization. For example, the 30% limit applies to amounts you spend on behalf of a private nonoperating foundation.\n\nTypes of Qualified Organizations\n\nFor the purpose of applying the deduction limits to your charitable contributions, qualified organizations can be divided into two categories.\n\nFirst category of qualified organizations (50% limit organizations).\n\nThe first category includes only the following types of qualified organizations. (These organizations are also sometimes referred to as “50% limit organizations.”)\n\nChurches and conventions or associations of churches.\n\nEducational organizations with a regular faculty and curriculum that normally have a regularly enrolled student body attending classes on site.\n\nHospitals and certain medical research organizations associated with these hospitals.\n\nOrganizations that are operated only to receive, hold, invest, and administer property and to make expenditures to or for the benefit of state and municipal colleges and universities and that normally receive substantial support from the United States or any state or their political subdivisions, or from the general public.\n\nThe United States or any state, the District of Columbia, a U.S. possession (including Puerto Rico), a political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession, or an Indian tribal government or any of its subdivisions that perform substantial government functions.\n\nPublicly supported charities, defined earlier under Qualified Conservation Contribution.\n\nOrganizations that may not qualify as “publicly supported” but that meet other tests showing they respond to the needs of the general public, not a limited number of donors or other persons.
