In Enterprise, the chance of a wet day over the course of August is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 17% and ending it at 15%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 19% on February 27, and its lowest chance is 5% on June 18.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during August in Enterprise is essentially constant, remaining about 0.9 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.0 inches or falling below 0.1 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 0.9 inches on August 13.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of August in Enterprise, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 3 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 2 minutes, 7 seconds, and weekly decrease of 14 minutes, 49 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is August 31, with 13 hours, 0 minutes of daylight and the longest day is August 1, with 14 hours, 3 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Enterprise is 6:39 AM on August 1 and the latest sunrise is 25 minutes later at 7:04 AM on August 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 8:42 PM on August 1 and the earliest sunset is 38 minutes earlier at 8:04 PM on August 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Enterprise during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during August, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 6:13 AM and sets 14 hours, 46 minutes later, at 8:59 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:46 AM and sets 9 hours, 34 minutes later, at 5:20 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in August in Enterprise\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in August in EnterpriseAug112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJulSep0010102020203030404050505060700001010202030303040405050606070NowNow\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for August 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in August in Enterprise\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in August in EnterpriseAug112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMJulSepJul 54:58 PMJul 54:58 PMJul 214:18 AMJul 214:18 AMAug 45:14 AMAug 45:14 AMAug 1912:26 PMAug 1912:26 PMSep 27:56 PMSep 27:56 PMSep 178:35 PMSep 178:35 PM5:38 AM5:38 AM9:25 PM9:25 PM8:55 PM8:55 PM6:28 AM6:28 AM6:40 AM6:40 AM9:14 PM9:14 PM8:09 PM8:09 PM6:35 AM6:35 AM6:36 AM6:36 AM8:07 PM8:07 PM7:37 PM7:37 PM7:56 AM7:56 AM\n\nAug 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 8%3:29 AMNE7:20 PMNW-11:26 AMS240,936 mi 2 3%4:31 AMNE8:06 PMWNW-12:21 PMS243,149 mi 3 0%5:35 AMENE8:43 PMWNW-1:13 PMS245,281 mi 4 0%6:40 AMENE9:14 PMWNW-2:01 PMS247,270 mi 5 2%7:43 AMENE9:40 PMWNW-2:45 PMS249,031 mi 6 6%8:44 AMENE10:02 PMW-3:26 PMS250,458 mi 7 11%9:43 AME10:24 PMW-4:05 PMS251,432 mi 8 18%10:40 AME10:44 PMW-4:44 PMS251,835 mi 9 26%11:38 AME11:05 PMWSW-5:22 PMS251,559 mi 10 35%12:36 PMESE11:28 PMWSW-6:03 PMS250,530 mi 11 44%1:36 PMESE11:55 PMWSW-6:46 PMS248,717 mi 12 50%2:39 PMESE--7:33 PMS246,151 mi 13 64%-12:27 AMWSW3:43 PMESE8:24 PMS242,934 mi 14 74%-1:06 AMSW4:48 PMSE9:21 PMS239,247 mi 15 83%-1:54 AMSW5:49 PMSE10:21 PMS235,351 mi 16 91%-2:54 AMSW6:44 PMSE11:23 PMS231,571 mi 17 94%-4:03 AMSW7:30 PMESE-- 18 97%-5:18 AMWSW8:09 PMESE12:24 AMS228,256 mi 19 100%-6:35 AMWSW8:43 PMESE1:22 AMS225,725 mi 20 100%-7:52 AMWSW9:12 PME2:17 AMS224,212 mi 21 96%-9:07 AMW9:39 PME3:08 AMS223,828 mi 22 90%-10:21 AMW10:07 PME3:58 AMS224,548 mi 23 81%-11:35 AMWNW10:35 PMENE4:47 AMS226,224 mi 24 71%-12:49 PMWNW11:08 PMENE5:38 AMS228,627 mi 25 60%-2:03 PMWNW11:46 PMENE6:31 AMS231,493 mi 26 50%-3:14 PMNW-7:26 AMS234,568 mi 27 37%12:31 AMNE4:20 PMNW-8:24 AMS237,639 mi 28 27%1:24 AMNE5:18 PMNW-9:21 AMS240,551 mi 29 18%2:23 AMNE6:06 PMNW-10:17 AMS243,207 mi 30 11%3:27 AMENE6:45 PMWNW-11:09 AMS245,559 mi 31 5%4:31 AMENE7:17 PMWNW-11:58 AMS247,592 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Enterprise is essentially constant during August, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 7, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Enterprise is essentially constant during August, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 7.7 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 10, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.5 miles per hour, while on August 5, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.6 miles per hour.\n\nThe lowest daily average wind speed during August is 7.6 miles per hour on August 5.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Enterprise throughout August is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 64% on August 15.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Enterprise typically lasts for 5.6 months (171 days), from around April 29 to around October 17, rarely starting before April 9 or after May 17, and rarely ending before September 28 or after November 6.\n\nThe month of August in Enterprise is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in August in Enterprise\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Enterprise are rapidly increasing during August, increasing by 706Â°F, from 2,009Â°F to 2,714Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Enterprise is gradually decreasing during August, falling by 0.8 kWh, from 7.4 kWh to 6.6 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Enterprise are 37.574 deg latitude, -113.719 deg longitude, and 5,315 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Enterprise contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 545 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 5,415 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (2,615 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (9,544 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Enterprise is covered by shrubs (74%) and cropland (23%), within 10 miles by shrubs (75%) and trees (12%), and within 50 miles by shrubs (77%) and trees (18%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Enterprise, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Enterprise.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Enterprise according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Enterprise is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Enterprise and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSaint George Municipal Airport (KSGU, 34%, 33 mi, south, -2,382 ft elevation change)\n\nCedar City Regional Airport (KCDC, 66%, 35 mi, east, 269 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Enterprise and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
