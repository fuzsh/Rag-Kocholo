        "text": "Call me an optimist, but I walk into every M. Night Shyamalan film with an open mind.\n\nIt's an essential state to be in if you are going to give anything the filmmaker creates a chance to survive outside his twisted brain. His last several outputs did not do it for me; you can read my unenthusiastic reports of and for yourself. But I'm not here to adore every one of his creations.\n\nThere are bound to be a few misses in a career this long and prolific, and perfection is not why Shyamalan is such an interesting filmmaker. He's stood the test of Hollywood time by being original. His 15th time in the director's chair, does exactly what we expect for the ticket: it takes a simple premise and keeps us guessing.\n\nNo, there is no big shocking reveal like you might come to expect based on his previous works. There isn't a clairvoyant child or an off-the-grid community. But \"Trap\" does something almost better. It takes its time doing one thing and doing that one thing with edge-of-your-seat precision.\n\nThe preview gives away that Cooper (Josh Hartnett) is a notorious serial killer known as The Butcher. He's also a \"regular\" family man, a firefighter who loves his kids so much that he agrees to take his daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to see her all-time favorite singer Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan).\n\nThe name is distinct and hard to miss. Shyamalan is the daughter of the film's writer-director. She's a singer in her own right and has to do a fair bit of acting here as well. Nepotism, sure, but she's believable as a Gen Z pop star. Her Billie Eilish-Lana Del Rey vibes make the concert portion at least somewhat interesting, and the layout of the production smells a lot like Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, creating further deep-vein channels and winding avenues for the cat-and-mouse chase.\n\nThe FBI learns that The Butcher will be attending the Lady Raven concert and decides to set a trap. Overseen by psychological profiler Dr. Josephine Grant (Hayley Mills), the coup fills the venue with cops, interviewing any male who fits the general profile of the murderer.\n\nHartnett has stayed relatively low profile since his early 2000s heartthrob days, and it almost feels like maybe taking this role as a charming but deranged psychopath was a way for him to further distance himself from that persona. He's older now, though he still knows how to woo with a wink and a smile.\n\nAs Cooper, however, the wink turns into a convulsive eye twitch, and the smile hangs on a little too long and a little too wide. Hartnett is confident and assured in this performance. He has to be to convince audiences that he could, in this day and age of technology and security cameras, evade police long enough to chop up 13 victims.\n\nThe 14th is in the basement of a vacant house somewhere, adding to the pressure cooker that reaches a near boil. As the increasingly obvious entrapment operation rears its head, Cooper does everything in his power to escape the venue without question. And there are, it turns out, quite a few ways to incite chaos and avoid entanglement with the authorities.\n\nWhat starts out slow ramps up by the third act. In fact, it seems at first like there won't be much of a story to tell, but Shyamalan knows his way around a puzzle, placing new loopholes or impediments in front of his characters like a master chess player.\n\nAs the film progresses into a deeper hunt for the killer, Hartnett's Cooper becomes more and more derailed, unveiling his unhinged hidden personality with compelling conviction. The character is juicy enough on its own, but in Hartnett's hands, he's a well-rounded, enigmatic specimen.\n\nViewers may feel anxious; it's a stressful game being played. But at no point do we feel trapped in a mishandled mystery or caught up in a third-rate thriller.\n\n\"Trap\" is in theaters now."
