        "text": "5 screens. Founded by Ramon L. Posel as a three screen theatre in 1976, then converted to five screen in 1985, this classic theatre was one of the first to bring arthouse films to Philadelphia. On the back of each ticket was an uncredited quote — “People used to go to the movies as they now watch television — not to see something but to see anything. We’re trying to select... features for those who want to see something.” In 1992, the Ritz Five premiered Philadelphia-area native M. Night Shyamalan debut feature-length film Praying with Anger. Ownership transferred to Landmark Theatres in March 2007. After over 30 years of operation, the theatre is still going strong, never wavering from its founder’s original mission to give Philadelphia residents an opportunity to see the best in independent, foreign, and documentary film.\n\nADMISSION: Children under the age of six are not admitted and those from six to sixteen must be accompanied by a parent. No one is to be seated after a film has been showing for 15 minutes.\n\nPARKING: Discount parking at Auto Park at 2nd & Sansom Street (the parking garage at the Ritz East with entrances on 2nd Street and Front Street between Chestnut and Walnut). Price is $11.00 with validation when parking after 12:00pm."
