Night Shyamalan, who made his directorial debut. Shyamalan also wrote, produced, and starred in the film.[1]\n\nIt is about a young Indian American's return to India and explores the clash of Western values with those of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIndian American Dev Raman returns to his native country to spend a year as part of a college exchange program. He is initially reluctant, but his mother insists, and he respects her wishes. While there, he discovers that his cold and distant father, now deceased, carried a quiet and profound affection towards him.\n\nWhile he is in India, he receives guidance from his friend Sanjay. As the visit progresses, Dev ignores Sanjay's suggestions, and the interaction between Indian and Western cultures quickly precipitates into misunderstanding and violence.[2]\n\nDev realizes that one may pray to the deities of the Hindu pantheon in almost any emotional state except indifference. As he explores his past and sees the miscommunication between the two cultures, Dev is overwhelmed and finds himself only able to pray with anger.\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film never received a wide release for mainstream distribution and has been shown primarily at film festivals. Praying with Anger screened at the 1993 AFI Fest, where it won the \"First Film Competition\" for American independent filmmakers.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nM.
