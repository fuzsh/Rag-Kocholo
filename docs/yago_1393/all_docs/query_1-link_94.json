        "text": "A man enters a dark room and faces a suspicious audience. Within these four walls, he explains, he’s going to tell captive strangers a tale with life-or-death stakes. But first, he needs something crucial from them: their trust.\n\nGaining trust isn’t easy for Leonard (Dave Bautista), a heavily tattooed muscleman wielding a pitchfork fused to a scythe in “Knock at the Cabin.” It’s even harder for the film’s director, M. Night Shyamalan, a yarn-spinner who’s become more associated with the twist than Chubby Checker.\n\n“I don’t look at it as a kind of fancy dance move,” Shyamalan said of his trickster reputation in a 2021 NPR interview. “Now I’m going to do the moonwalk, everybody! Here we go!” Shyamalan insists he’s not after gotchas. He’s a spiritualist chasing moments of epiphany, that exhalation when the reveal of one piece of information makes the world make sense.\n\nEarly on in “Knock at the Cabin,” Leonard and his three fellow kidnappers tie up a family — the parents Eric and Andrew (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) and their young daughter, Wen (Kristen Cui) — and attempt to persuade their prisoners that one of them must die or humanity will suffer fires, floods and plagues. The film, an adaptation of Paul Tremblay’s novel “The Cabin at the End of the World,” is, quite literally, announcing a Revelation. The hostages, and the audience, must make a choice. Will they believe Leonard or not? One of the two outcomes laid out at the beginning will turn out to be true. Regardless, Shyamalan’s name in the credits means some people will still call the ending a twist.\n\nIt wasn’t always this way. As a boy growing up in the Philadelphia suburbs, Shyamalan spent his weekends shooting straightforward 8 mm remakes of Steven Spielberg movies. He wore the Indiana Jones fedora; his German ‌shepherd played the giant boulder. His parents assumed he’d become a doctor. The ur-Shyamalan surprise came when he applied only to New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
