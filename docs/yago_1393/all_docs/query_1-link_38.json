        "text": "During a recent appearance on The Graham Norton Show, director M. Night Shyamalan spoke about his frequent cameos and his first indie movie.\n\nWhen asked about his various cameos, Shyamalan mentioned that both his parents were doctors and that it was “a sad moment” when he told his parents he wanted to make films instead of following in their footsteps. He then said joked that he at least “got to play a doctor” for his cameo in his 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense.\n\nThe director then discussed his very first film, Praying with Anger, stating that “no one saw it except my family,” and that after watching it, his dad told him to “put white people in your movies.”\n\nYou can watch M. Night Shyamalan’s appearance on The Graham Norton Show below:"
