        "text": "Set in the 1990s, Praying with Anger is the debut directorial feature of M. Night Shyamalan, who also co-wrote and starred in the film. The story revolves around an Indian-American student named Dev Raman (played by Shyamalan), who travels to India to study at an ashram after completing his undergraduate degree in the United States. Despite being of Indian origin, Dev is culturally disconnected from his heritage and struggles to adapt to the intense religious and cultural atmosphere of the ashram.\n\nDev experiences a range of emotions during his stay in India, including frustration, anger, and confusion, as he grapples with his identity, his past, and his present. He clashes with the ashram authorities, including the revered Swamiji (played by K. Subramanian), who perceives Dev as being too Westernized and impious. Dev also struggles to reconcile with his estranged father, who lives in India and has abandoned his family in the United States.\n\nAs Dev navigates his spiritual journey, he encounters a diverse group of people, including his jovial roommate Sanjay (played by Mike Muthu), a philosophical beggar, and a young woman named Anu (played by Anjali Bhushan), whom he develops feelings for. These characters challenge Dev's preconceived notions and biases, forcing him to confront his own shortcomings and flaws.\n\nThe film is shot entirely in India and features stunning visuals of the country's landscapes, architecture, and cultural traditions. Shyamalan infuses the film with his signature style, incorporating elements of mysticism, spirituality, and visual symbolism into the narrative. The film's soundtrack, composed by Shyamalan himself, features traditional Indian music blended with contemporary beats.\n\nPraying with Anger is a deeply personal film for Shyamalan, who drew inspiration from his own experiences as an Indian-American in the United States. The film examines themes of identity, belonging, and cultural assimilation, and offers a nuanced portrayal of the complexities of the Indian diaspora. Despite its low budget and amateurish acting, Praying with Anger showcases Shyamalan's raw talent as a filmmaker, and foreshadows the success he would later achieve with films such as The Sixth Sense and Split.\n\nOverall, Praying with Anger is a thought-provoking and introspective film that offers a unique perspective on the Indian-American experience. It is a poignant exploration of the struggles faced by those who straddle multiple cultures, and a testament to the power of forgiveness, self-discovery, and spiritual growth. Fans of Shyamalan's later works will appreciate the film's thematic richness and visual flair, while newcomers to his oeuvre will be captivated by its raw emotional power."
