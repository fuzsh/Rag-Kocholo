        "text": "August is usually a slow month at the movies. But that does not mean there are no good films hitting theaters. This month's new releases are a contrasting blend of fear and romance: Call it fromance. Pairs well with froyo, perfect for those scorching summer days.\n\n'Trap' (August 2)\n\nEver wonder what a family outing might be like for a serial killer? M. Night Shyamlan's \"Trap\" stars Josh Hartnett as Cooper, who takes his daughter to see pop star Lady Raven \"only to realize that the concert is an elaborate trap that the authorities have put in place to catch him,\" said Screen Rant. Here, a signature Shyamalan twist is already evident from the trailers: Cooper is the serial killer, and he must try to evade the police without harming his daughter. The movie marks a \"return of sorts for Josh Hartnett, an actor whose stiff onscreen presence is engineered toward sociopathy, whose genial good looks play as a hard mask,\" IndieWire said.\n\n'Cuckoo' (August 2)\n\nKeep the fear alive with \"Cuckoo,\" the second film from German director Tilman Singer, which promises to be \"incredibly strange and deviously fun,\" said Mashable. \"Euphoria\" fan favorite Hunter Schafer stars as the horror flick's Final Girl, part of a family visiting a remote and snowy corner of the German Alps. Singer \"jettisons logic to make room for more horror tropes than you can shiv with a butterfly knife in his deliriously entertaining, very bonkers second feature,\" said Variety.\n\n'It Ends With Us' (August 9)\n\nA hugely popular romance novel of the same name by Colleen Hoover rose to fame on the sub-community of TikTok known as BookTok. Directed by Justin Baldoni, who also stars opposite Blake Lively, this big-screen adaptation will similarly follow heroine Lily as she meets and falls in love with a handsome neurosurgeon named Ryle. Unfortunately, their dynamic begins to remind Lily of her parents' abusive relationship. Hoover's story was the top-selling print book in 2022 and stayed on the The New York Times Best Seller List for more than 90 weeks, said People — so the film is bound to draw an audience.\n\n'Close to You' (August 16)\n\nThis marks the first male film role for actor Elliot Page (\"Juno\"), who came out as trans in 2020. Page shares a writing credit with director Dominic Savage on \"Close to You,\" and \"the actor has evidently brought much of his own identity and experience to this sensitively observed story of a trans man cagily reunited with his family after a five-year period of estrangement,\" said Variety. Page plays Sam, who pays a visit to his hometown and must reckon with his family's discomfort over his transition despite their purportedly progressive values.\n\n'The Crow' (August 23)"
