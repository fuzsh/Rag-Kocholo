        "text": "She added, “I think that idea was really powerful. The effect that an artist, that a musician, can have on kids, especially and young girls – I think is a beautiful thing. And Taylor Swift is an amazing example of that.”\n\nHere’s what we know about M. Night Shyamalan’s budding actress daughter, Saleka:\n\nSaleka Shyamalan grew up in Bryn Mawr\n\nAccording to Saleka’s interview with Philly Mag, she grew up in Bryn Mawr, which is located just west of Philadelphia along Lancaster Avenue. While we know her father is the legendary filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan, her mother also has an impressive background, having worked as a therapist in various counselling centres.\n\nShe’s from a “classic Asian Indian family”\n\nAs per The New York Times, M. Night previously talked about how his family is traditional in many ways. “We’re a classic Asian Indian family, but maybe the difference slightly that’s interesting is rather than aiming it toward medicine, or engineering, or law – your only three options – we aimed toward the arts,” he said, per the source.\n\nIn Saleka’s interview with Philly Mag, she said that her parents helped create a “very normal life for me and my two sisters”. She added, “I got straight As, came home and studied, had a small group of friends who would all hang out at my house.”\n\nHer name holds a special meaning\n\nAs revealed in Saleka’s interview with Philly Mag, her last name is based on her grandfather’s first name and where he comes from in Kerala, India, and the “y” is silent.\n\nAs for her first name, “All I know is that my family has always called me ‘Suh-lee-kuh.’ But there’s probably some traditional Indian pronunciation I don’t know about,” she noted.\n\nShe is an American R&B singer-songwriter\n\nBefore making her acting debut, Saleka was already exploring a career in the music world – and still is, with 14 of her songs being featured on Trap’s soundtrack.\n\n“I studied classical piano very seriously and was prepping to be a concert pianist and study at a conservatory,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “But then, when I was 16, I started feeling a desire to write and compose for myself and to use a different type of creativity, so I shifted my path.” In 2022, she released her debut album, Séance, adds the source."
