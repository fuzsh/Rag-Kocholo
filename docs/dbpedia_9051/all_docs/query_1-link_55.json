        "text": "Paula's second LP, This Fire, was released, with herself as the producer. Within a year, the track \"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\" was heard all over the radio and became a #1 pop hit.\n\nPaula reflected on her growing popularity with Scene Magazine: On the comparisons of her music to other female artists such as Kate Bush and Tori Amos: \"Maybe it's just because we're women, we're passionate about what we do and we're all strong singers who sing about personal issues...\" On her LP, This Fire: \"I really wanted to make a stark and risky statement, more about performance and 'in the moment' passion and emotion. It's not as naive and much more brazen. I felt more comfortable with myself, under my own skin, and I was able to take those risks because I believed in myself more.\" Entertainment Weekly called Paula \"...a feisty poet with a soaring voice and a funky groove...\"\n\nPaula performed for U.S. troops in the Middle East right before the Christmas holiday.\n\nPaula hit the Top 40 with \"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\"\n\nPaula hit the Top 10 with \"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\"\n\nThis Fire was certified gold.\n\nPaula hit #1 with \"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\" for 3 weeks.\n\nPaula continued to promote her LP throughout 1997 with live performances on VH-1's Hard Rock Live and PBS's Sessions At West 54th.\n\nHer participation in the highly successful Lilith Fair tour also increased her popularity and help record sales.\n\nPaula hit the Top 40 with \"I Don't Want To Wait.\"\n\nPaula was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video (\"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\").\n\nThis Fire was certified platinum.\n\nPaula hit the Top 10 with \"I Don't Want To Wait.\"\n\nPaula won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist and was also nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Album (This Fire), Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (\"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\"), and Producer of the Year (the first woman ever nominated in this category). Although she might be remembered for her win as Best New Artist, Paula also might be remembered for \"giving the finger\" during her performance of \"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\" But the offending gesture was actually part of the act and a spokesperson for Cole's record label said the gesture was \"part of the satire (of the song) where the woman is at home while the guy's out having a beer.\" She also hit the Top 40 with \"Me.\"\n\nThis Fire was certified 2x platinum.\n\nPaula hit the Top 10 with \"Me.\"\n\nPaula told Rolling Stone: \"My life has changed so dramatically. It's really bizarre and abnormal. I miss my parents. And there's no time. I mean, I had to pee in a cup the other day.\"\n\nCole talked with CNN about Lilith Fair: \"There was a vacancy an a need for women to support each other in music, in business, in life... It's a musical tour, first and foremost, but at the same time, there are amazing benefits that are coming out of this that are very feminist-inspired. Just the fact that we have proven to the industry... to a very male-dominated industry, that women are and can be very successful and are doing very well on their own, thank you very much, and we don't have to have men backing us up or men opening for us.\" Cole spent part of the summer travelling with the Horde Tour and will be playing again with the Lilith Fair when the tour hits Canada.\n\nPaula won 4 Boston Music Awards for Act of the Year, Outstanding Female Vocalist, Outstanding Song/Songwriter (\"I Don't Want To Wait\"), and Single of the Year (\"Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?\")."
