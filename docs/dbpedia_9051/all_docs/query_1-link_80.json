        "text": "A little bit of star power is coming to Hingham. Grammy-winner Paula Cole will serenade guests, residents and families on June 19 at The 12 - An Evening to Support the Pat Roche Hospice Home. Rolling Stone called Cole “An extraordinary songwriter with a gorgeous voice.” As the first woman in history to solely produce and receive the Best Producer Grammy nomination for her work, “This Fire,” Cole broke boundaries. Paula Cole is the voice behind Peter Gabriel’s “Secret World Live”, hits “Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?” and “I Don’t Want To Wait.” The singer also won a Grammy for Best New Artist and led thepack at Lilith Fair’s opening. She is now a professor at her alma mater, Berklee College of Music, between tours and albums. Cole brings a new level of entertainment to Turkey Hill’s premier annual charitable event and garden party.\n\nThe evening is made possible by philanthropic volunteers and community members. The 12 Committee is led by Co-Chairs and Hingham residents Sara Abbott and Molly Smith. More than 450 guests are expected to enjoy cocktails and dinner on the grounds of the historic former summer home of Harvard Law School Dean Ezra Thayer.\n\nCo-Chairs Molly Smith and Sara Abbott\n\nSpecial thanks to Premier Sponsors: Roche Brothers; Quincy Mutual Group; Sandy Cove Advisors; Hollywood Agency and Comprehensive Benefit Administrators.
