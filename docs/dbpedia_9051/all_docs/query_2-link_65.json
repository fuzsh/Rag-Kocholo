        "text": "Singer/songwriter and Grammy winner Paula Cole lives the good life on MassachusettsÂ’s North Shore.\n\nPaula Cole is an internationally known recording artist with a schedule that often requires being on the road, but when it comes to her personal life, the Grammy winner calls the sleepy North Shore of Massachusetts home. There, Cole lives with her family in a more than 100-year-old carriage houseÂ—Â“formerly for horses and cows, with an old root cellar, too,Â” she says. Here, Cole talks to Ocean Home about the simple things she loves most about oceanfront living. By, Lindsay Lambert\n\nWhat drew you to this location when it came to buying a home? The land is so beautiful. We instantly fell in love with the peace and wildlife. Also, weÂ’re close to my family here.\n\nWhatÂ’s your favorite beach pasttime? The annual New YearÂ’s Day morning dip in the cold Atlantic with my family.\n\nWhat features of the home allow you to best enjoy its beach setting? We are such a short jaunt from the beach. I take great pleasure in seeing the kidsÂ’ joy in bounding down the trail to the shore. One day, I know they will reflect upon how lucky weÂ’ve been to live by the sea.\n\nHow would you describe the homeÂ’s dÃ©cor style? [ItÂ’s] a mix of rustic and modern with a few traditional dashes. This is a strong-boned carriage house with history. I love wood, so IÂ’ve wrapped two roomsÂ’ walls in local white pine. I seek calming, natural environs, keeping an eye on green living, feng shui, and a generous sense of space. Often I find IÂ’m bringing a little bit of a NYC loft feel to this house. ItÂ’s eclectic. But mostly, itÂ’s unfinished. This one will take years.\n\nWhatÂ’s your favorite decorating element when it comes to your oceanfront home? Truly, my favorite aspect of this home is the land, the wildlife. From my back windows, I can see the pond; from my front windows I see land and ocean and the occasional gray fox.Â So, my Â“decoratingÂ” is more about comforting the soul and honoring our outside environment. It is rewarding when people come to my home and visibly relax. Open space de-stresses. Then, I find peopleÂ’s eyes moving to the windows and the outside. The scenery is mesmerizing (much better than TV). We are replacing all the windows here, so I certainly know the value of that. Windows are the eyes to the soul outside, and a practical necessity for energy conservation."
