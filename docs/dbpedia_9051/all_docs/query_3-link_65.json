This performance will take place rain or shine at open-air amphitheaters with no covered seating.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nCole has been a truth-teller, provocateur, feminist, rebel, and autobiographical writer who has pushed for personal honesty and social justice. An artful weaver of genre, she is difficult to categorize. She is singular.\n\nPaula Cole rose to prominence in the mid-'90s’ with her critically acclaimed debut, Harbinger, and her work with Peter Gabriel. She became the first woman in history to be GRAMMY® nominated for “Best Producer” in her own right, for her follow-up success, This Fire. In 1997, both singles I Don’t Want to Wait and Where Have All the Cowboys Gone cracked the Top 20. Cole has received 7 GRAMMY® nominations, winning for “Best New Artist” in 1998. Cole has a loyal audience, drawn to her live performances. Cole was an instrumental force behind the historic Lilith Fair. Her songs have been covered by artists from Herbie Hancock and Annie Lennox, to Lissie, to HAIM, sampled by hip hop artists, and performed by choirs.\n\nPaula Cole has pushed buttons and boundaries, declared truths and followed her own path of iconic vision.\n\nVisit the artist's website\n\nWhen\n\nLocation"
