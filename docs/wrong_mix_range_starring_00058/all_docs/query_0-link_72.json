        "text": "Jewish congregants at a synagogue in Mineola, NY attempt to obtain a minyan (quorum of 10) in order to proceed with morning services. One of the congregants arrives with his granddaughter whom he declares is possessed by a dybbuk. This sets in motion a story about the personal demons held within us. This is The Tenth Man and it is currently playing at B’Nai Israel Living History Synagogue under the auspices of the Brigit St Brigit Theatre Company.\n\nI’m not super familiar with the works of Paddy Chayefsky, but based off this play and his script for Altered States, I can conclude that he does have a gift for human weaknesses and seems to enjoy wrapping it up in a bit of the supernatural to hammer home the point that we are frail, but that fixing those frailties is possible. Once the story really launches with the arrival of David Foreman and his granddaughter, Evelyn, we begin to dip into the weaknesses of these characters.\n\nMany of them have a dybbuk of their own. One’s dybukk is his atheism. Another is the guilt of being on the outs with his father for leaving the rabbinical life. Another is a suicidal alcoholic. Still another is holding on to the old ways. The story’s power is how these individuals come together to deal with or even ignore/overlook these dybbuks.\n\nMurphy Scott Wulfgar provides some truly excellent direction with the piece and his blocking and staging were of abnormally high quality, possibly some of the best I’ve ever seen. Wulfgar uses two performance sites: the synagogue’s basement and its sanctuary. He and his actors make full use of the space with a truly immersive performance as his actors use every nook and cranny, forcing the audience to constantly shift focus to follow the entire story. The blocking is so natural and extemporaneous that it feels like actors chose their movements in the moment as opposed to prearranging it. Wulfgar also coached his thespians to performances ranging from solid to superlative.\n\nThis is a true ensemble piece where everyone gets a moment to shine. Some of the sterling performances come from Jack Zerbe whose extreme piousness reflects his crushing guilt at being on the outs with his father when he died. David Sindelar shows some subtle symptoms of suffering from the same schizophrenia with which his granddaughter has been diagnosed. Murphy Scott Wulfgar provides humor as the faithless atheist who goes through the motions of the faith out of habit and not having anything better to do. Jason Levering shines as the traditionalist lamenting the loss of the old ways and the increasing faithlessness of this generation.\n\nBut this show’s core story lies on the shoulders of Katt Walsh and Christopher Scott who provide a pair of masterful performances.\n\nKatt Walsh is extraordinary as Evelyn Foreman. Walsh’s Foreman is a deeply disturbed individual. Whether from possession or illness will be for you to decide. Walsh has some of the most beautiful body language and facial expressions that I’ve seen in a performer and says more with a look or gesture than some can with multi-page monologues. On the turn of a dime they can transition from complete catatonia to shocking violence and then flip to gentleness such as lovingly removing the coat of Evelyn’s grandfather. Walsh has a firm grip on dialects and easily transitions from the Russian dialect of Evelyn’s dybbuk to Evelyn’s own New Yorker voice.\n\nChristopher Scott gives his best performance to date with a highly nuanced, multilayered take on Arthur Brooks. Scott’s Brooks is an extremely despondent person. This is a man battling real demons. He feels abandoned by everyone, driving him to the bottle and the brink of suicide. When he encounters the plight of Evelyn, Scott just bleeds compassion and finally takes that sincere and deep dive into himself where he finds a strength thought long lost.\n\nThomas Rowe has provided some accurate costumes reflecting the faith and practices of Hasidic Judaism with suits, scarves, and yarmulkes. Murphy Scott Wulfgar supplied some eerie sounds for the more supernatural moments of the show.\n\nAct I was hampered a bit by the basement’s black box nature. Those walls and bodies really suck up sound so the actors have to really project so all of the dialogue can be heard. The sanctuary is a perfect performance venue and voices rang out clear as bells in Act II.\n\nThis is an incredibly reflective tale and nearly all of these characters have something to exorcise. It’s just a matter of deciding what and who gets left behind.\n\nThe Tenth Man runs at B’Nai Israel Livng History Synagogue through May 7. Showtimes are Thursdays and Saturdays at 7:30pm and Sundays at 2pm and 7:30pm. There are no Friday night shows. Tickets cost $35 and can be obtained by calling 402-502-4910. B’Nai Israel Living History Synagogue is located at 618 Mynster St in Council Bluffs, IA.\n\nA sad sack floral assistant’s discovery of an unusual plant opens the door to fame, fortune, and the girl he loves. All he has to do to keep the gravy train going is to make sure his plant gets plenty of a most unique diet. This is Little Shop of Horrors and it is currently playing at the Omaha Community Playhouse.\n\nBasing a musical on a cult film would seem like a risky proposition, but it ended up being a monster success for the creators of Little Shop of Horrors. The keys to its success are that it never takes itself very seriously. In fact, the campy nature disguises the reality that this is a dark show, even a little darker than the source material. It also has a vibrant score which will get you rockin’ and rollin’ and maybe even dabbing your eyes a bit at some points.\n\nStephen Santa opted for a minimalist approach with the casting which really worked. Instead of a larger cast of supernumeraries, he opts for a very small cast where some of the featured performers end up playing all of the smaller roles. This allowed for some very entertaining character work. Santa also lays into the camp of the piece as nearly all of his performers go over the top, but never to an absurd degree where it would become caricature. Santa keeps the pace brisk and culls some effective performances out of his thespians.\n\nRenzellous Brown, Keiria Marsha, and Ejanae Hume are dynamite as a do-wop Greek chorus that helps propel the story along. Seth Maisel slays as the greedy, cranky, and opportunistic floral shop owner, Mr. Mushnik. Maisel adds some depth to the character with his sympathy towards Audrey’s treatment at the hands of her abusive boyfriend. Kerri Forrester has an angelic singing voice and her Audrey scorches in her solo turns in “Somewhere That’s Green” and “Suddenly Seymour”. Josh Peyton clearly has a high old time in multiple character roles and his featured performance as the abusive and off kilter dentist, Orin Scrivello. Peyton brought an intensity to “Be a Dentist” that I’d never heard before and it truly made Orin seem like a dangerous and scary man. Dave Wingert has a nice pre-recorded intro as the voice of doom setting the stage of the story.\n\nPaul T. Hanson is an ideal Seymour Krelborn. From head to toe, he is the beaten down nerd from the poor dress sense to his slumped shoulders to the perpetually glum expression on his face. Hanson makes you feel for Seymour as he is a genuinely nice guy who deserves a break who ends up succumbing to temptation to enjoy the nicer things in life. Hanson has a real flair for comedy and timing with an extended routine with a cut thumb that reveals his plant’s bloodlust and a bit of puppetry magic where a smaller version of Audrey II keeps trying to take a chomp out of the Greek chorus. Hanson has a splendid tenor which has a plaintive, desperate quality as he begs to get out of “Skid Row” and a real gentleness in “Suddenly Seymour”.\n\nThey say it takes a village, but I say it takes a trio to bring Audrey II to life and the synergy of Cullen Wiley, Tabor Cross, and Tyler Marshall fuse into one dynamic character. Wiley and Cross provide the animation of II’s mouths and vines and Marshall provides the vocal animation. Marshall adds just the right blend of snark and meanness to Audrey II who acts as a modern day serpent in the Garden of Eden to tempt Seymour while achieving its own devious ends. Marshall also has some killer vocal chops as he pushes Seymour towards murder in “Git It” and hungers in “Suppertime”.\n\nMatthew Hamel has designed a suitable set for Skid Row with the rundown flower shop whose visage improves with renovations, a graffiti filled wall, and a billboard in the corner. Andrew Morgan’s properties help add to the derelict nature with garbage cans and less than pristine flowers for the shop (at first). Janet Morr paints a beautiful home on the billboard which serves as a bit of foreshadowing when the Greek chorus bursts through it to kick off the show. Tim Burkhart & John Gibilisco add the right ambient sounds with ringing phones, the mechanical whine of a dentist’s drill, and gunshots. Bradley Pesarchick’s costumes are right on the mark for the characters with Seymour’s sweater and plaid pants, Audrey’s tight dresses, the gorgeous sequined gowns of the chorus, and Orin’s starched white dental coat. This show isn’t known for big, flashy dance numbers, but DJ Tyree makes his punches count where he can with the choreography for the chorus which suits their do wop numbers and the Jewish dancing of Mushnik in “Mushnik & Son”. Darrin Golden’s technical work combined with Jim Othuse’s lights make for some pretty good neon signs in Skid Row. Jim Boggess and his orchestra worked this score with the energy of a fiery comet.\n\nThis show doesn’t try to pretend to be anything other than what it is and what it is is a fun-filled dark comedy rocker. You’ll dance. You’ll laugh. You’ll have a good time. Take a visit to this little shop and see what I mean.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors plays at the Omaha Community Playhouse through May 7. Showtimes are Wed-Sat at 7:30pm and Sundays at 2pm. Tickets are on sale now, starting at $25 and may be purchased at the Box Office, by phone at (402) 553-0800, or online at OmahaPlayhouse.com.

This bubbly fusion of rap, salsa, Latin pop and soul music boasts an infectious enthusiasm from beginning to end.\n\nLook! Up on the stage! It’s a chord! It’s a bard! No, it’s Don’t Stop Me Now! A Celebration of Rock Musicals. This joint production between Rave On Productions and the Omaha Community Playhouse is currently playing in the Storz Parking Lot at OCP.\n\nThis rollicking revue of rock musicals is a rather ambitious production and hits the right notes (pun intended) for the most part. Rave On and OCP give the audience a potpourri of tunes ranging from hard rockers to soft ballads to some pretty emotional works. I especially enjoyed the fact that not only were classic well-known numbers and shows utilized, but they also selected songs from lesser known productions which really spiced up the evening.\n\nKimberly Faith Hickman’s direction brought some fun theatricality to the night while Matthew McGuigan’s musical direction was utterly flawless. He and his band were in fine fettle as they played with a rich gusto and energy that gave the songs a familiar feel, but imbued them with a unique vibrancy.\n\nThe show is blessed with a talented troupe of troubadours who each get their moments in the sun and occasionally blend in glorious harmony. Some shining moments were Brittney Thompson’s rendition of the power ballad “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” from Dreamgirls and Ejanae Hume’s killer take on “Take Me or Leave Me” from Rent. Eric Perlstein kicked things off with the sonorous “Heaven On Their Minds” from Jesus Christ Superstar, gave us a little Four Seasons with “December, 1963 (Oh What a Night), but his shining moment was his interpretation of “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” from American Idiot with his sensational, soulful emoting. Jonathan Berger’s lower tenor got to glow with Billy Joel’s “Movin’ Out” and “Tear Me Down” from Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\n\nBut in a group of standout performers, Evelyn Hill and Jesse White really stole the show. Hill is a worthy successor to Brenda Lee’s moniker of Little Miss Dynamite as her talent is explosive. Hill threw herself into her numbers and stunned with performances including a high powered rendition of ABBA’s “Mamma Mia” and her half of “Suddenly, Seymour” from Little Shop of Horrors.\n\nWhite is a performer’s performer with his own animated performances. His tenor is both soaring and searing as he tore through the night outdoing Frankie Valli’s falsetto in “Sherry”, was shyly comforting in his half of “Suddenly, Seymour”, nailed David Bowie’s “Changes” from Lazarus to the floor, and capped the night with Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now”.\n\nBut the night’s capstone number came from Ryan McGuigan with his tragically haunting version of “Gethsemane” from Jesus Christ Superstar. Aside from his formidable musical chops, McGuigan brought a little top notch acting as he was shedding real tears by the end of the song and if you can listen to it without your soul stirring, then you probably don’t have one.\n\nBut I can’t end this review without mentioning the splendid work of Jim Boggess who hosted the festivities. His wit, warmth, and humor really enhanced the night and his introduction of each number was a real aid for those who may not be familiar with each song and show.\n\nThere were some moments of singers not having enough breath for certain notes and numbers that were fine technically, but needed a bit more commitment to bring them to that next level, but these were minor quibbles in a thoroughly entertaining night.\n\nIt’s a rocking good time and a pleasant, and socially distant, way to get out and have some fun. Take a break from these strange times and get a ticket to see this one before it’s too late.\n\nDon’t Stop Me Now! A Celebration of Rock Musicals plays at the Omaha Community Playhouse through Sept 20. Showtimes are Wed-Sat at 7pm and Sundays at 6pm. Tickets cost $35 and can be purchased online at www.omahaplayhouse.com or by phone at 402-553-0800. This is a cashless event and reservations are required. CDC guidelines are being followed and parking spaces will be assigned upon arrival. Please do not arrive earlier than 60 minutes before showtime. The Omaha Community Playhouse is located at 6915 Cass Street in Omaha, NE.\n\nPhoto provided by Zach Wagner Photography\n\nSeymour Krelborn has one dream: to get out of Skid Row. One day fate seems to offer him a shot at that dream when he buys a strange, exotic plant which he exhibits in the window of the florist shop where he works. Suddenly Seymour has fame, money, and the girl. And all it took was a little blood. Find out the rest of Seymour’s story in Little Shop of Horrors by Howard Ashman with music and lyrics by Alan Menken. It is currently playing at Bellevue Little Theatre.\n\nAshman’s script is a bit of genius. He took a cult horror film and managed to turn it into a hit musical due largely to his tongue in cheek approach to the material and the snappy score of Alan Menken. The tongue in cheek approach was certainly the way to go as it helps disguise the fact that this is a pretty bleak tale. Nearly all of the characters are unlikable and it does not have a happy arc. In spite of that, you can’t help but have a great time due to the comedy and memorable songs.\n\nD Laureen Pickle’s direction is a strong bit of work as she has led her cast to some fine characterizations and knows how to balance the serious moments with the over the top moments.\n\nThe cast was quite clearly enjoying themselves which really adds to the fun of the show. Some notable supporting performances were supplied by Carrie Beth Stickrod, Samantha Shatley, and Brenda Smrdel as a trio of chiseling Skid Row do woppers who also serve as the play’s musical narrators; James Verderamo as a sadistic dentist; and Christopher Scott as Mr. Mushnik, the greedy and abrasive owner of the florist shop.\n\nWhen I envision Seymour Krelborn, Kyle Avery is the image that springs to mind. Avery was a pitch perfect Seymour as his lean and lanky physique were well suited to the nebbish Seymour. Rest assured that Avery’s acting and singing chops were also more than up to the challenge of the role. Adopting an adenoidal, Brooklyn tinged voice, Avery well presented Seymour as a shy, nerdy man who merely wants a few nice things out of life, but whose innocence leave him susceptible to manipulation by others. Avery gives Seymour an inherent decency that makes his struggles with his conscience quite believable when he starts to go down a darker path due to the machinations of his plant, Audrey II.\n\nAvery possesses a strong and sweet tenor voice that he modulates well emotionally with heartbreaking numbers such as “Skid Row” and “Suddenly, Seymour”.\n\nJen Dillon is delightful as Audrey. Ms Dillon utilizes a breathy, Brooklyn voice to communicate the uneducated nature of Audrey, but, boy, does she have a heart of gold. She is a really nice girl who just happened to be born on the wrong side of the tracks and you really pity her as she seems resigned to being poor and being involved with rotten men. She also has a lovely soprano with which she can either belt out a tune such as her sequences in “Skid Row” or melt your heart like butter in “Somewhere That’s Green”.\n\nAndrew Miner gives an incredibly animated performance as Audrey II. What makes it even more amazing is that it’s all done by the power of his voice as Audrey II is nothing more than a series of puppets (kudos to the puppet designer by the way). Miner gives Audrey II a delicious aura of evil and a malicious mean streak. His powerful upper baritone singing voice also aid in communicating Audrey II’s nastiness with tunes such as “Feed Me (Git It)” and “Suppertime”.\n\nD Laureen Pickle’s set design really looks like a skid row with its dilapidated, abandoned buildings and garbage strewn streets. Lindsey Pape has designed a series of pluperfect costumes from Seymour’s nerdy outfit of baseball cap, sweater, and glasses to the disheveled clothes of the Skid Row inhabitants to the do wop outfits of the Skid Row trio. Chris Ebke and his band provided a wonderful afternoon’s entertainment performing the catchy tunes. I also want to note the puppetry of Brian Henning which made Audrey II seem like a living entity.\n\nEnergy seemed to lag a bit in today’s production and projection was all over the map. I also thought there was room to go a bit bigger in some of the show’s more over the top moments. But these are easily remedied items which will make a hot show scalding.\n\nIt may not be a happy tale, but, by golly, it’s a fun time. Take a visit to this shop. Just remember, don’t feed the plants.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors plays at Bellevue Little Theatre through Oct 1. Showtimes are Fri-Sat at 7:30pm and Sundays at 2pm. Tickets cost $20 for adults, $18 for seniors, and $10 for students. For tickets contact the theatre at 402-291-1554 Mon-Sat from 10am to 3pm.
