        "text": "Fans are asking if Rick Moranis cameos in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and reprises his role of Louis Tully from the original Ghostbusters films. Here is your answer, but beware of spoilers.\n\nIs Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire?\n\nNo, Rick Moranis is not in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\nUnfortunately, fans who were expecting to see Rick Moranis’ Louis Tully appear in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire should throw them aside.\n\nWith his absence, Rick Moranis is one of the three members of the original Ghostbusters cast to not return in the new film. The other two are Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett and the late Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler, who passed away ten years ago in 2014.\n\nWill Rick Moranis ever return to Ghostbusters?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Rick Moranis will ever return to the Ghostbusters franchise.\n\nRick Moranis previously declined an offer to cameo in the Ghostbusters 2016 reboot with an all-female star cast. He claimed it did not make any sense to him in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter:\n\n“I wish them well. I hope it’s terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago? I took a break, which turned into a longer break. But I’m interested in anything that I would find interesting. I still get the occasional query about a film or television role, and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest, I’ll probably do it. [But Ghostbusters ] didn’t appeal to me.”\n\nAs the last words of the aforementioned quote indicate, Moranis has since become selective about choosing projects. As such, it would likely take some strong convincing and a great script from the creators to ensure his return to the franchise."
