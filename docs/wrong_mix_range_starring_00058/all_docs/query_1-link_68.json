        "text": "&#151; -- It's no secret that a few stars from the original \"Ghostbusters\" will make an appearance in the upcoming reboot.\n\nRick Moranis, however, won't be one of them.\n\n\"I hope it's terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?\" he said in a new interview with the Hollywood Reporter. \"[But] I wish them well.\"\n\nMoranis, now 62, hasn't appeared in many movies in the past two decades, though he told the publication that contrary to popular belief, he's not retired. Instead, he \"took a break which turned into a longer break\" after his wife died from breast cancer in 1997. At that point, Moranis decided to focus on raising his three children.\n\n\"I was working with really interesting people, wonderful people,\" Moranis recalled of that time. \"I went from that to being at home with a couple of little kids, which is a very different lifestyle. But it was important to me. I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever. My life is wonderful.\"\n\nNow that his children are grown up, Moranis, who has been busy doing voice work and completing writing projects in his adopted hometown of New York, is considering appearing on screen again.\n\n\"I'm interested in anything that I would find interesting,\" he said. \"I still get the occasional query about a film or television role... and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest, I'll probably do it. [But 'Ghostbusters'] didn't appeal to me.\"\n\n\"I'm happy with the things I said yes to, and I'm very happy with the many things I've said no to,\" he continued. \"Yes, I am picky, and I'll continue to be picky. Picky has worked for me.\""
