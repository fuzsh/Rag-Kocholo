        "text": "\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" is officially celebrating its 35th anniversary.\n\nIt's been over three decades since Rick Moranis accidentally made the Szalinski and Thompson kids smaller than ants when the shrinking machine he was tinkering with suddenly began working while the kids were in the room.\n\nAfter a series of events, the kids end up outside in their front yard and have to deal with obstacles like stray Legos, sprinklers and bugs, all while trying to avoid getting stepped on by their parents.\n\nHere is what the film's cast has been up to for the past 35 years.\n\nWHY 'HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS' STAR RICK MORANIS LEFT HOLLYWOOD\n\nRick Moranis\n\nRick Moranis played the lovable father, Wayne Szalinski, who accidentally shrunk, not only his kids, but also the neighbors' kids, in \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.\" Before this movie, Moranis had already won an Emmy for his work on \"The SCTV Network,\" and was known for starring in \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Spaceballs.\"\n\nHe went on to star in \"Parenthood,\" \"My Blue Heaven,\" \"Gravedale High,\" \"Little Giants\" and \"The Flintstones,\" as well as the two sequels to \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.\"\n\nFollowing the second sequel in 1997, Moranis took a break from Hollywood to care for his kids after the death of his wife. She passed away in 1991 from breast cancer. Moranis told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015 that even though he didn't take on new projects, he didn't officially retire either.\n\n\"I took a break, which turned into a longer break,\" he told the outlet. \"But Iâ€™m interested in anything that I would find interesting. I still get the occasional query about a film or television role and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest.\"\n\nMoranis has primarily been working as a voice actor. He first dipped his toe back into the movie business in 2001, voicing two characters in \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer & the Island of Misfit Toys.\" Some of his other voice-acting gigs include \"Brother Bear,\" \"The Animated Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie,\" and the voice of Dark Helmet in \"The Goldbergs.\"\n\nMoranis was married to Anne Moranis from 1986 until her death in 1991.
