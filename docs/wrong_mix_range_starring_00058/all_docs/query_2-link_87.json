        "text": "There is a good chance Ace Ventura: Pet Detective will come up in conversation if you ask someone who is strolling their dog on the street about their favorite Jim Carrey flick. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective earned mixed reviews upon its initial release, so it is almost funny to see how beloved it has become among fans despite this fact. Nevertheless, the film remains a hilarious detective satire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviewers and viewers alike had a major effect because of Carrey’s performance. Not only did it initiate the actor’s cinematic career (no, it was not The Mask), but it also initiated a franchise. Having said that, what if we told you that Carrey was not the first choice to play such an iconic character?\n\nThe original contender for the role is also a legendary figure in the comedy film industry, but his comedic sensibility is nothing like Carrey’s outrageous and wild improvisation. Rick Moranis (Ghostbusters, Streets of Fire, and Ghostbusters II) did, in fact, miss this incredible opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRick Moranis’ Role Refusal and Jim Carrey’s Win as Ace Ventura\n\nIt is difficult to imagine another actor playing the completely bizarre Miami pet detective Ace Ventura, played by Jim Carrey. Surprisingly, The Mask star was not the first actor approached to play the part. We learned from Vulture that Rick Moranis, who is well-known for his roles in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and Spaceballs, was approached for the lead role but turned it down.\n\nIn the 1980s, Moranis had already made a name for himself as an actor, starring in films such as Parenthood, Ghostbusters, and the beloved Little Shop of Horrors. According to People, he was purposefully declining roles by the time he was approached to play Ace Ventura because his wife had passed away from breast cancer in 1991.\n\nAlthough he continued to work on creative projects and do voice acting occasionally, Moranis had virtually given up on his career in film by 1997 in order to raise his two children. According to USA Today, Moranis’ album, The Agoraphobic Cowboy, was released in 2005.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking a break from acting was never something Moranis regretted. In 2015, he shared with The Hollywood Reporter how much he enjoyed working with the fascinating people he met:\n\n“I went from that to being at home with a couple of little kids, which is a very different lifestyle. But it was important to me. I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever. My life is wonderful.”\n\nFor Carrey, whose estimated net worth is 180 million according to Celebrity Net Worth, this choice changed everything because Ace Ventura: Pet Detective became a huge hit and catapulted him into superstardom.\n\nThe Impact of Jim Carrey’s Iconic Role as Ace Ventura\n\nThe role of Stanley Ipkiss in The Mask was destined for Jim Carrey, and the movie would be difficult to imagine without him. The role was actually written for him, according to Forbes, even though he was not always the front-runner for his other acclaimed Ace Ventura role in Tom Shadyac’s 1994 comedy flick. Note that The Mask came after Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with almost every feature film, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective underwent numerous changes during development, but as Collider points out, Moranis’ acting style is not a good fit for the way the character is portrayed in the finished product. Carrey’s portrayal of the character, who was extroverted and outspoken, is likely very different from the roles portrayed by Moranis.\n\nThe critics were taken aback by his performance. As provided by The New York Times:\n\n“The comic actor Jim Carrey gives one of the most hyperactive performances ever brought to the screen… Only a child could love Mr. Carrey’s character, but that may be the point.”\n\nRegarding Carrey, the renowned comedian and actor owes a great deal of his career to the success of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. The actor starred in a string of successful films after its release, which was one of his first leading roles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mask, Dumb and Dumber, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective all made their theatrical debuts in the same year, 1994. All things considered, it seems like Jim Carrey and Rick Moranis made the right decisions for their lives and careers.\n\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective can be rented on Apple TV, while The Mask is streaming on FuboTV."
