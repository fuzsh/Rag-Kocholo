        "text": "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire was originally set to feature a cameo from actor Rick Moranis, but the star turned down the chance to appear in the film.\n\nSpeaking to ScreenRant, actor Ernie Hudson — who reprises his role as Winston Zeddemore in the film — revealed that the folks behind the movie were unable to convince Moranis to return to the movie as Louis Tully, who he played in the first two movies.\n\n“I don’t know why. I haven’t had a personal conversation,” said Hudson. “I talked to Ivan Reitman before he transitioned, who I know had spent a lot of time trying to convince Rick. I know that the other guys have talked to him, and I’m not sure why, he just said no.”\n\nHudson even went on to mention that he knows Moranis got offered more money to appear than he did, and that if he had been asked to help recruit him, he would have.\n\n“I know they offered him more money than they offered me. And if I thought going to his house would make a difference, I’d be there,” Hudson said. “Because I’d love to see [him]. And not just in Ghostbusters, but I just think he’s an amazing talent . . . I’d love to see him back if there was any possible way, you know?”\n\nMoranis retired from acting in 1997 so that he could dedicate more time to raising his two children as a widower. He has not appeared in a live-action movie since 1997’s Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, although he is signed on to appear in Disney’s upcoming movie, Shrunk, opposite Josh Gad.\n\nWhat will Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire be about?\n\n“In Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, the Spengler family returns to where it all started — the iconic New York City firehouse — to team up with the original Ghostbusters, who’ve developed a top-secret research lab to take busting ghosts to the next level,” reads the official synopsis. “But when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force, Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.”\n\nThe latest installment to the horror comedy franchise is directed by Gil Kenan (Monster House, City of Ember) from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jason Reitman. The sequel stars Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Mckenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, Celeste O’Connor, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Patton Oswalt, Kumail Nanjiani, and more."
