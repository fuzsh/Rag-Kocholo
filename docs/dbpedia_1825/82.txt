John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall was born 15 August 1316 in Eltham Palace, Kent, England, United Kingdom to Edward II of England (1284-1327) and Isabella Capet (c1295-1358) and died 13 September 1336 Perth, Scotland, United Kingdom of unspecified causes.

Biography

He gained the title of Earl of Cornwall on 6 October 1328.1

He was due to marry Maria, daughter of Ferdinand IV, King of Castile and Leon but the marriage did not take place.

John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336) was the second son of King Edward II of England and Isabella of France. He was born in Eltham Palace, Kent, England and was named after his father's father, King John of England.

In 1321, John was created Earl of Cornwall, a title which had traditionally been held by the king's eldest son. However, because John's older brother, Edward III, had already been created Earl of Chester, John was given the lesser title of Earl of Cornwall instead.

Despite his young age, John was involved in politics and military affairs. In 1330, when his brother Edward III overthrew their mother's lover and regent, Roger Mortimer, John was one of the earls who supported Edward in his coup. After Mortimer's execution, John was appointed as the Chief Guardian of Scotland, a position he held until his death.

He died in Perth, Scotland, in 1336, at the age of 20. John's death was a great loss to his family and to the English nobility, as he was considered to be a promising and talented young man.

Betrothals

As the younger brother of the English monarch, since early childhood marital negotiations were made for John: in March 1328 Edward III entered into negotiations for a marriage between his brother and María Díaz de Haro, heiress of the Lordship of Biscay.[lower-alpha 1]

By contract signed on 28 September 1334, John was then betrothed with Maria de La Cerda, Lady of Lunel and daughter of Ferdinand de la Cerda (grandson of King Alfonso X of Castile) by his wife Juana Núñez de Lara, Lady of Lara.[2] A dispensation was sought, but the contract was abandoned when relations between Edward III and King Philip VI of France worsened in late 1334. Marie married Charles d'Évreux at Poissy in April 1335.[3]

In December 1335 were made negotiations for a marriage with Joan, Countess of Penthièvre and heiress of the Duchy of Brittany;[lower-alpha 2] however, it doesn't seem that these arrangement resulted in an official betrothal.
