He requests aid and compensation for his losses and costs. Nature of endorsement: This petition is to be sent to Chancery and from there he is to have a writ to the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer that they, having called John le Smale before them, and heard the complaint and the account of Nicholas Pyk, who complains of the things contained in this petition, are to inform the Chancellor of what they find that he has spent and lost in this arrest; and on this certification the said Treasurer and Chamberlains are to be ordered to give the said Nicholas payment for his losses and damages."
