        "text": "I'm interested in knowing if any descendants have been traced\n\nfor Walter de Cornwall, the illegitimate son of Richard\n\nPlantagenet, Earl of Cornwall. My research that Walter received\n\nland in Brannel, Cornwall in 1300 by gift of his half brother,\n\nEdmund, Earl of Cornwall, and that Walter died in 1313, leaving\n\nas his heir, a son William, aged 26.\n\nDoes anyone know if Walter de Cornwall's son, William, left\n\ndescendants or if Walter had any other children? I say that\n\nbecause I show that sometime prior to 1314, Walter enfeoffed\n\nJames Peverel and his wife, Margaret, with lands in Nansbighen,\n\nCornwall. Is it possible that Margaret was Walter's daughter?\n\nJames Peverel and Margaret, his wife, mentioned here appear to\n\nhave been the great-grandparents of Katherine Peverel (born say\n\n1380), wife of Walter Hungerford (died 1449), lst Lord\n\nHungerford, Lord High Treasurer of England. Among the manors\n\nof Katherine's Peverel inheritance appears to have been the\n\nmanor of Nansyrgh, Cornwall [Reference: Calendar of Close Rolls,\n\n1435-1441 (published 1937), pp. 217-9, 227-8]. One source\n\nidentifies Nansyrgh as Nanjeth in the parish of St. Stephen in\n\nBrannel. By any chance, is Nansyrgh/Nanjeth identical with the\n\nlands in Brannel conveyed to Walter de Cornwall in 1295, by\n\nEdmund, Earl of Cornwall? If so, then I presume that Katherine\n\nPeveral might be a descendant and perhaps lineal heir of Walter\n\nde Cornwall. If so, then Katherine (Peverel) Hungerford might\n\npossibly have a valid descent from King John of England, via his\n\nson, Richard, Earl of Cornwall.\n\nFor interest's sake, the following eleven immigrants descend\n\nfrom Katherine (Peverel) Hungerford:\n\n1. Humphrey Davie of Mass.\n\n2. Mary (Launce) Sherman of Mass.\n\n3. John Nelson\n\n4. Thomas Owsley\n\n5. Elizabeth Pelham, wife of Col. John Humphrey, of Mass. (she\n\ndied in England).\n\n6. Herbert Pelham of Mass.\n\n7. Edward Raynsford of Mass.\n\n8. Maria Johanna Somerset of Md.\n\n9. John Stockman\n\n10. John West of Va.\n\n11. George Yate of Md.\n\nPlease contact me if anyone has any helpful particulars.

CFF244 of 1270 also carries a note that Earl Richard was\n\nthe father of Richard and Joan by Joan de Oxtone. The Lysons also say that\n\nGeoffrey de Cornwall, a Carmelite friar and writer who flourished about\n\n1300, was born at Court, the manor house of Brannel. Richard and Walter\n\nwere probaly born c.1250 so Geoffrey could have been either's son. Vivian\n\nalso has a Geoffrey de Cornwall of the same period as the father of\n\nElizabeth who married William de Champernon (1314 - 1353). (Perhaps\n\nGeoffrey had opted for the mendicant austerities of the White Friars after\n\nhaving first tasted the joys of married life.)\n\nCFF567 of 1343 has John, son of William de Cornwall, and Margery his wife\n\ngiving the manor of Brannel and the advowson of the church (St. Stephen's)\n\nto Ralph de Treiagu and, after his death, to David Hendour and Isabella [de\n\nCornwall?]. The Lysons also say that the elder de Cornwall branch died out\n\nin the 14th century, the heiress marrying into Hendower (see also CFF 566)\n\nand their heiress into Tanner. The younger branches of de Cornwall became\n\nCornwall of Burford, Shropshire, Hereford and Kings Nymet in Devon. If the\n\nelder branch is thought to be Walter - William - John - Isabella, it seems a\n\nbit tight with William born 1287 and Isabella married in 1343. Of course,\n\nRalph de Treiagu could have been a brother of John, Isabel being Ralph's\n\ndaughter. Margaret could still have been enfeoffed by Walter with\n\nNansbighen as a marriage portion but it doesn't sound like Brannel (unless\n\nonly a small piece of it) if Treiagu and Hendower were given it by CFF567.\n\nCourt is about a mile outside the village of St. Stephen-in-Brannel. The\n\nfarmhouse called Brannel is a further half mile south. Nanjeth,or Lanjeth\n\nas it is known today, (the Cornish place-name elements Nan- and Lan- are\n\nsometimes interchangeable, Nan- > Lan-, which is confusing, as one means\n\nvalley and the other means enclosure), lies further out to the east of St.\n\nStephen. As Court is an English word, it is possible that it might have\n\ncarried an earlier Cornish name, like Nansyrgh or Nansbighen, which has\n\nsince been lost. Nan- ( Nans-) means valley, -sergh > -serth means steep,\n\nand -byghan means small. So, on the face of it, even if they are the same\n\nplace, a small steep valley doesn't seem to take us much further, although\n\nCourt does lie at the top of the valley of St. Stephen's Coombe, now\n\nshortened to Coombe, and the farmhouse Brannel is on the edge of Coombe.\n\nHowever coincidental that may be, Court seems a little more likely than\n\nLanjeth as the traditional capital farm of the manor but these places are so\n\nclose together they could be all one and the same. The EPNS for Cornish\n\nPlace-name Elements suggests that Nan > Lan + byghan = Lanvean or Laddenvean\n\n(byghan > bean > pean > vean). There is a village of Nanpean a couple of\n\nmiles north of St. Stephen but there could be quite a few permutations of\n\nthe elements.\n\nNo mention of the Peverels though.\n\nIvor West\n\nDouglas Richardson <royalances...@msn.com.invalid> wrote in message\n\nnews:2af090cc...@usw-ex0102-013.remarq.com...\n\n> I'm interested in knowing if any descendants have been traced\n\n> for Walter de Cornwall, the illegitimate son of Richard\n\n> Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall.

I am not familiar with \"Lysons' Cornwall\" and\n\ndon't see a title that could be referred to as this in the Harvard\n\nUniversity Library on-line catalogue (telnet://hollis.harvard.edu). Can\n\nyou forward a fuller citation? Or did I miss this cited more fully in one\n\nof the recent postings?\n\nFurther, is there an explicit instrument referred to for the grant which\n\nnames Richard as the Earl's son by Joan de Valletort (other than the 1270\n\nfine)? If the maternity of Richard is so clear, is there some reason that\n\nJoan de Valletort [or de Oxton] seems not to have been named by Foljambe\n\nand Reade in their 1908 genealogy of the Cornwalls (at least to go by the\n\npostings based on Reade to s.g.m. last year?\n\nNat Taylor"
