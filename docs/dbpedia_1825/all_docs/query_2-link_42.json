        "text": "Stant ibi regifico constructa palatia luxu.--Ovid.\n\nEltham is situated on the high road leading from London to the Crays, and thence to Maidstone, at a distance of about miles south-eastward from Greenwich. The place was anciently called Eald-ham (the old home or dwelling-place), and was formerly a market town of considerable importance; the markets, however, were discontinued . James I., shortly after the palace ceased to\n\n237\n\nbe used as a royal residence. The manor, in the time of Edward the Confessor, belonged to the Crown, of whom it was held by Alwold. William the Conqueror granted it, together with many other estates in the county of Kent, to his half-brother, Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Earl of Kent; and at the time of the Domesday survey it was held of him by Hamo, Sheriff of Kent. On the confiscation of Odo's estates, however, some years later, this manor reverted to the Crown, and, becoming divided, part of it was retained by the sovereign, and the other part was given to the family of De Mandeville, whence the place obtained the name of Eltham Mandeville. The part held by the Crown was afterwards granted by Edward I. to John de Vesci, Lord of Eltham, who subsequently obtained the whole by exchange with Walter de Mandeville.\n\nThe manor was afterwards granted to Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem, to hold in trust for his natural son, who was called William de Vesci, of Kildare. Through a betrayal of the trust reposed in him, however, the bishop, on the death of the last Lord de Vesci, appears to have obtained possession of the estates, and to have bestowed great cost on the buildings at Eltham. He died here in the year , having bestowed the estate on Queen Eleanor, the consort of Edward I. The manor was next granted to Sir Gilbert de Aton, and afterwards to Geoffrey le Scrope, to hold by the accustomed services. It subsequently again reverted to the Crown, having, it is said, been given to Queen Isabella, consort of Edward II. It has remained in the possession of the Crown since that period, having been occasionally granted for terms of years on lease to various persons. It may be mentioned that the title of Lord Eltham has been, more than once refused to individuals who were anxious to assume it on being raised to the peerage, on the express ground that the Barony of Eltham belongs to the sovereign. The precise date of the erection of a palace here is quite a matter of uncertainty; the earliest mention of it by our old historians as a royal residence is in the continuation of the\n\nHistoria Major\n\nof Matthew of Paris, ascribed to William Rishanger, a monk of St. Albans, who brought it from the year down to the close of the reign of [extra_illustrations.6.237.1] Lambarde's allusion to this work runs as follows:--\n\nKing Henrie the\n\nThird\n\n(saith Mat. Parise), toward the latter ende of his reigne (\n\n1270\n\n), kept a Royall Christmas (as the manner then was) at Eltham, being accompanied with his Queene and Nobilitie: and this (belike) was the\n\nfirst\n\nwarming of the house (as I may call it) after that the Bishop had finished his worke. For I doe not hereby gather that hitherto the king had any propertie in it, for as much as the Princes in those daies used commonly both to soiourne for their pleasures, and to passe their set solemnities also, in Abbaies and in Bishops' houses.\n\nIn , the queen having taken up her residence at [extra_illustrations.6.237.2] , there gave birth to a son, who was called, from the place of his nativity, John of Eltham, and who was afterwards created Earl of Cornwall. Edward II. frequently resided at Eltham, and in and Edward III. held his parliament here; and it was at the lastmen- tioned period that a petition was presented by the Commons, requesting the king to make his grandson, Richard, Prince of Wales. In the Duke of Clarence, the king's son, in the absence of his father, kept a public Christmas here.\n\nIn , John, King of France, Edward III.'s prisoner by conquest, came as an unwilling guest to England, and was entertained by the king and queen at Eltham. Froissart mentions how that on a Sunday afternoon King Edward and Queen Philippa waited at the gates of the palace to receive the fallen monarch, and how,\n\nbetween that time and supper, in his honour were many grand dances and carols, at which the young Lord de Courcy distinguished himself by singing and dancing.\n\nThis entertainment must have appeared strange indeed to the feelings of the captive prince, who, when asked to join in the conviviality, pathetically replied,\n\nHow can I sing in a strange land?\n\nCaptive as he was, he seems to have had but little cause for regret on his own account, for, becoming enamoured of the Princess Royal, he urged his suit, and was fortunate enough to succeed in obtaining her as his bride.\n\nEltham Palace was of the favourite residences of Richard II. and Anne of Bohemia. In Holinshed's\n\nChronicles,\n\nunder date of , it is recorded that\n\nKing Richard II. holding his Christmasse at Eltham, thither came to him Leo, King of Armenia, whose countrie and realme being in danger to be conquered of the Turks, he was come into these west parts of Christendome for aid and succour at the hands of the Christian princes here. The king honourablie received him, and after he had taken counsell touching his request, he gave him great summes of money and other rich gifts, with a stipend, as some write, of a\n\nthousand pounds\n\nyearly, to be paid to him during his life.\n\nFroissart, the famous poet and historian, in his , makes several allusions to the royal palace of Eltham; in he came to England for the purpose of presenting to Richard II. a\n\n238\n\nvolume of his writings. The details of this visit are thus given by Froissart himself:--\n\nThe king arrived at Eltham on a Tuesday; on the Wednesday the lords came from all parts. There were the Duke of Gloucester, the Earls of Derby, Arundel, Northumberland, Kent, Rutland, the Earl Marshal, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London and Winchester, in short, all who had been summoned arrived at Eltham on the Thursday by eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nThe Parliament was holden in the king's apartment, in the presence of the king, his uncles, and the council. The matter in deliberation was the solicitation of the chieftains in Aquitaine that they might remain attached to the crown of England. Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, the king's brother, opposed their petition, with a view to keep his brother, the Duke of Lancaster, abroad; and to show that he was the man who governed the king, and was the greatest in the council, as soon as he had delivered his opinion, and saw that many were murmuring at it, and that the prelates and lords were discussing it in small parties, he quitted the king's chamber, followed by the Earl of Derby, and entered the Hall at Eltham, where he ordered a table to be spread, and they both sat down to dinner, while others were debating the business.\n\nOn the Sunday the whole council were gone to London, excepting the king and Sir Richard Sturry; these two, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Percy, mentioned me [Froissart] again to the king, who desired to see the book I had brought for him. I presented it to him in his chamber, for I had it with me, and laid it on his bed. He opened it and looked into it with much pleasure. He ought to have been pleased, for it was handsomely written and illuminated, and bound in crimson velvet, with ten silver-gilt studs, and roses of the same in the middle, with two large clasps of silver-gilt, richly worked with roses in the centre. The king asked me what the book treated of; I replied, Of Love! He was pleased with the answer, and dipped into several places, reading aloud, for he read and spoke French perfectly well, and then gave it to one of his knights, Sir Richard Credon, to carry it to his oratory, and made me acknowledgments for it.\n\nParliament met here to arrange King Richard's marriage with Isabella of Valois; she was brought hither after her bridal, and from the gates of Eltham Palace she departed in state to her coronation. [extra_illustrations.6.238.1] was frequently at Eltham with his Court. Here he was espoused to Joan of Navarre, in the presence of the primate and the chief officers of state, Antonio Riezi acting as the lady's proxy, and actually having the ring placed upon his finger. In , according to Stow, Henry kept his Christmas here with his queen, and Lambarde tells us that in he kept his last Christmas at Eltham. His son and successor, Henry V., also resided here, and in ,\n\nthe king keeping his Christmasse at the manor of Eltham, was advertised that Sir Roger Acton, a man of great wit and possessions, John Browne, Esquire, John Beverlie, priest, and a great number of others, were assembled in armour against the king.\n\nThis report, it seems, had some effect on the king, for, as Lambarde states,\n\nhe was faine to depart suddenly, for feare of some that had conspired to murder him.\n\nThe meeting, which took place in Fields, under the instigation of Sir John Oldcastle, notwithstanding the treasonable character that was given it by most writers of the period, appears to have been nothing more than a convention of the inoffensive people styled Lollards, to hear the preaching of of their pastors.\n\nHenry VI. once kept his Christmas festivities at Eltham; and here, unconscious of his critical position, this unhappy prince forsook his studies to hunt and join in the sports of the field under the watchful eye of his keeper, the Earl of March, while his wife and son, for whom he had restored the palace, were sheltering in Harlech Castle.\n\nEdward IV. resided much at Eltham Palace, and on the , his daughter, Bridget, was born here. She was christened in the chapel in the palace, by the Bishop of Chichester, and subsequently assumed the garb of a nun at Dartford. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, Edward IV. kept his Christmas here in great state in the year -, on which occasion, it is stated, more than persons were there daily entertained. This king is recorded to have laid out large sums on the buildings here, and, as will be presently shown, is supposed to have entirely rebuilt the great hall as it now stands.\n\nLambarde, in his\n\nPerambulation of Kent,\n\npublished in , states that\n\nit is not yet fully out of memorie that King Henry VII. set up the faire front over the mote there; since whose reigne, this house, by reason of the neerenesse to Greenewiche (which also was much amended by him, and is, through the benefite of the river, a seate of more commoditie), hath not beene so greatly esteemed: the rather also that for the pleasures of the emparked groundes here, may be in manner as well enjoyed, the Court lying at Greenwiche, as if it were at this house it selfe.\n\n239\n\nHenry VII., like his predecessors, generally resided here, and was wont to dine every day in the hall surrounded by his barons. The\n\nfaire front,\n\nalluded to by Lambarde, was, no doubt, the north face of the moated square, approached by the Gothic bridge of arches.\n\nAlthough Henry VIII. preferred the palace at Greenwich, he appears sometimes to have resided at Eltham, and in he kept his Christmas here. Holinshed thus records the entertainment on this occasion:--\n\nIn the year\n\n1515\n\nthe king kept a solemn Christmas at his manor of Eltham, and on the Twelfe Night, in the hall, was made a goodlie castle, wonderouslie set out, and in it certaine ladies and knights, and when the kinge and queene were set, in came other knights, and assailed the castle, where many a good stripe was given, and at last the assailants were beaten away, and then issued knights and ladies out of the castle, which ladies were strangelie disguised, for all their apparel was in braids of gold, fret with moving spangles of silver-gilt set on crimson satin, loose and not fastened; the men's apparell of the same suite made like julis\n\n[sic\n\n] of Hungary, and the ladies' heads and bodies were after the fashion of Amsterdam; and when the dancing was done the banket [banquet] was served in of\n\ntwo hundred\n\ndishes.\n\nTowards the close of the year the plague raged so fiercely in London that the king and his Court removed to Eltham. Henry VIII. again kept his Christmas here in that year, and in Queen Mary paid a visit to the palace, attended by Cardinal Pole and the Lord Montagu. In the year of Queen Elizabeth's reign Eltham Palace was for a few days the royal abode; but an idea having arisen that the stagnant waters of the moat rendered the palace unhealthy, it was thenceforth but little frequented by royalty. Sir Christopher Hatton was keeper of Eltham Palace in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In James I. was visited at Greenwich by his brother-in-law, the King of Denmark, and the kings went together to Eltham, where they hunted with\n\ngreate pleasure, and killed\n\nthree\n\nbuckes on horsebacke.\n\nDuring the Civil Wars, Eltham Palace was occupied by the Parliamentary General, Robert, Earl of Essex, who died there in .\n\nAfter the death of Charles I. the royal residence was seized by the Parliament, and in a survey made by the commissioners in the above year it is stated that the palace was built of brick, wood, stone, and timber, and consisted of fail chapel, great hall, rooms and offices below stairs, large cellars, lodging-rooms on the king's side, on the queen's, on the princes', rooms in the offices round the court-yard, which contained acre o ground.\n\nThere were parks attached to this mansion, covering a very extensive tract of ground. The Great Park contained acres; the Little, or Middle Park, acres; and Home, or Lee Park, acres; the whole of which were well stocked with deer. The deer, as may easily be imagined, were well hunted and destroyed by the soldiery and others during the time of the Commonwealth; besides which most of the trees were cut down.\n\nIn , the parks having already been partly broken up and the deer destroyed, Nathaniel Rich purchased the house and a great part of the lands attached to it. Evelyn describes its condition a few years later; under date of , he writes in his\n\nDiary,\n\nWent to see his Majesty's house at Eltham; both the palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble wood and park destroyed by Rich the rebel.\n\nAfter the Restoration, the manor of Eltham was bestowed by Charles II. on Sir John Shaw, in recognition of his friendship to him when in exile at Brussels and Antwerp; and, with the exception of certain portions of land originally in the royal park which are still vested in the Crown, it continues in the possession of his descendants.\n\nLike most of the moated manor-houses of the Middle Ages, the palace of Eltham was nearly square in plan, and embraced courts or quadrangles enclosed by a high wall. The moat which surrounded it was of great width; the principal entry was over a stone bridge and through a gateway in the north wall. There was also another gateway and bridge on the opposite side of the enclosure. The most important part of the buildings consisted of a high range which crossed the court from east to west, and included the hall, the chapel, and the state apartments. The principal courts were spacious and befitting the abode of royalty, and lodging-rooms and offices, as notified in the above survey, were very numerous; of these, however, not a vestige now remains, save the foundations, some of which are traceable round the sides of the area enclosed by the moat. Of the chapel, not even the site can now be ascertained. In fact, the only parts now remaining are the banqueting-hall; an ivy-covered bridge of ribbed arches which spans the moat on the north side, and still forms the entrance to the building; part of the embattled wall, flanked with loopholed turrets; some curious drains, supposed formerly to have been used as sallyports on occasions of\n\n240\n\nemergency; and a building at the east end of the hall, with fine corbelled attics and ancient gables, formerly the buttery, but now a private residence, called the Court House. This latter building was thoroughly restored, and a new wing added to it in , at which time the great hall, which had been for many years used as a barn, was cleared out, and the eastern end of it considerably altered, being made to serve as the entrance to the house. By far the most interesting of these remains is the magnificent banqueting-hall, with its beautiful high-pitched roof, entirely constructed of oak, in tolerable preservation, with hammer-beams, carved pendants, and braces supported on corbels of hewn stone. Its dimensions are feet in length, in height, and in breadth.\n\nThe hall,\n\nwrites Mr. Buckler, in his (),\n\nwas the master feature of the palace. With a suite of rooms at either extremity, it rose in the centre of the surrounding buildings, as superior in the grandeur of its architecture, as in the magnificence of its proportions and the amplitude of its dimensions. This fair edifice has survived the shocks which, at different Eltham Palace In 1790. periods, laid the palace low. Desolation has reached its very walls, and the hand of wanton mischief has dared to injure where it could not destroy; but still the hall of Eltham Palace has not, with the exception of the louvre, been entirely deprived of its smallest constituent feature.\n\nIts north and south sides were both open to quadrangles. Their architecture corresponded precisely, excepting that the south parapet was plain, while that on the other side, facing the principal gate of entrance, was embattled, and the cornice enriched with sculptured corbels.\n\nIn this majestic structure the architect scrupulously avoided the frequent use of carvings, which, it is evident, would have destroyed the elegant simplicity of his design; and, besides its intrinsic excellence, this specimen of the palace will abundantly prove how well the ancients could apply the style to domestic purposes, how far removed from gloom were their habitations where defensive precautions could be dispensed with, and how skilfully they prosecuted whatever they undertook in archi. tecture.\n\nThe proportions of Eltham Hall, and the harmony of its design, attest the care and skill which were exerted in its production. Other halls may surpass it in extent, but this is perfect in every useful and elegant feature belonging to a banqueting-room. It was splendidly lighted, and perhaps required painted glass to subdue the glare admitted by two-and-twenty windows. There are no windows over the high pace or the screen, and there were none in the majority of examples, though, from unavoidable circumstances, Westminster and Guildhall receive their light in these directions.\n\nThe windows of the hall are ranged in couples, in spaces on both sides, occupying the length of the building, from the east wall to the angle of the bays; every window is cinquefoil-headed and divided by a mullion without a transom, around\n\nwhich in some instances the thick trails of ivy impart a highly picturesque effect, which is heightened by the broad streams of cheerful sunlight that fall through the empty panels; and every space is divided by a buttress, which terminates below the cornice, and at the foot of the windows has twice the projection of the upper half. Altogether, however, these supports are slender, and partake of the same light and elegant proportions which characterise the whole building. The walls alone are adequate to the weight which presses on them, but their strength is increased by the buttresses --features which are almost inseparable from the ancient style of architecture, and were frequently used for ornament even when their strength was\n\n242\n\nsuperfluous. The buttresses at Eltham are, however, both useful and ornamental; and, as if to determine for which purpose they were most required, several of those facing the south are mangled or destroyed.\n\nAt the eastern end of the hall were doorways communicating with the buttery above mentioned, and also other arched doorways leading into the court-yards. These entrances were concealed by a wooden screen ornamented with carved work, over which was the minstrels' gallery, the framework of which remains to this day. At the western or upper end, where the was placed, is on either side a bay, or recess, the ceilings of which are composed of very elegant groining and minute tracery, and which were illuminated by windows of the lightest order of Gothic. In these recesses it was customary, on state occasions, to display the rich and costly vessels then in use. The recesses are now in a sadly mutilated condition, but the main body of the hall was rescued from speedy decay by order of Government in , when were expended on it. When it was used as a barn, now more than a century ago, most of the windows were bricked up, and pairs on the north side remain in that condition at the present time. The holes for the timber supports of the elevated platform, or are still visible in the western wall; and above the same spot, at a considerable elevation, was a window whence the king might look from his own private apartments on the revellers in the hall, an arrangement commonly in use in old houses of this description.\n\nThe date of the erection of the banqueting-hall unquestionably corresponds with the time of King Edward IV. Not only is this opinion borne out by the depressed Gothic arch of the roof and the double ranges of windows, which much resemble those in the hall at Crosby Place, Bishopsgate, and in a building at Nettlested, now used as a malt-house, both known to have been erected . Edward IV., but there is also in the northeast doorway the device or badge of Edward IV., in very good preservation, namely, the or blazing sun in conjunction with the rose. This doorway, headed by a label moulding (characteristic of the architecture of the latter end of the century), was formerly for many years protected from the weather by a shed, to which is to be attributed its excellent preservation. The badge appears on of the spandrils, between the label and the arch. Besides this, the falcon and fetterlock, another device of Edward IV., may be observed among the carvings of the oriel windows.\n\nThe great hall has for ages gone by the name of\n\nKing John's Barn,\n\nprobably from some confusion between King John and a son of Edward II., who was born here, and who, as already stated, was called\n\nJohn of Eltham.\n\nSubterranean passages have been traced for some distance in a south-easterly direction, but these are now converted into drains. It appears to have been about the year that the discovery of these passages was made; and from a pamphlet published a few years ago we learn that a trap-door under the ground-floor of of the apartments led into a room below, feet by in dimensions, from which a narrow passage about feet in length led to a series of passages, with decoys, stairs, and shafts, some of which were vertical and others on an inclined plane : these were once used for admitting air, and for hurling down missiles and pitch-balls upon the heads of those below. These passages were explored to a distance of nearly feet, of which lay under the moat. In a field between Eltham and Mottingham the arch had been broken into, but still the passage could be traced further, proceeding in the same direction. In that part immediately under the moat iron gates were found, completely carbonised, whilst large stalactites, formed of super-carbonate of lime, which hung down from the roof of the arch, sufficiently indicated the lapse of time since these passages had been previously entered. The passages now serve as drains in connection with the dwelling-house which now stands upon the site of the ancient buttery at the eastern end of the great hall.\n\nThe moat, which still surrounds the entire building, has been partially drained and turfed, and that part lying on the north side, which is spanned by the ancient bridge, is exceedingly picturesque, the effect being heightened by the herons and other species of water-fowl that adorn its banks. The old tilt-yard or tilting-court in the palace\n\npleasaunce\n\nwas for many years converted-alas! for this prosaic age-into a market garden; its high wall and archway of ruddy brick, which alone remain to mark its site, are well worthy of notice.\n\nWe have already spoken of the parks which formerly belonged to Eltham Palace, and of the havoc made in them by the Parliament during the Civil Wars. The Middle Park, however, has remained to this day, and has gained some notoriety --at least, in the racing world--as the home of the famous stud of racehorses belonging to the late Mr. William Blenkiron. After the death of this gentleman, the\n\nstud,\n\nwhich included the celebrated horses Gladiateur and Blair Athol, was sold by\n\n243\n\nauction in , realising a sum of . The Middle Park establishment is kept in remembrance by the\n\nMiddle Park Plate,\n\nfounded in , and which is of the chief races at the Newmarket Meeting. The memory of the Horn Park is still preserved in Horn Park Farm, at some little distance to the west of the palace.\n\nOn the east side of Eltham Palace a broad thoroughfare, called the Court Road, in which are numerous neat-built villas, leads to the Eltham Station of the South-Eastern Railway (North Kent line), which is situated at Mottingham, about a mile from the village. The latter lies at a short distance northward of the palace, and has a quiet, old-fashioned air. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a large Gothic edifice of stone, comprising nave, aisles, transepts, and chancel. It was erected in --, to supersede an old parish church which stood on the same spot. The latter building was a singular brick-built structure, which had been patched up at different times and in so many ways that in the end it had a somewhat unsightly appearance. On a tablet over the doorway on the north side was the date . The wooden tower and shingle spire of the old church have been left standing at the south-west corner of the new church. In the churchyard is the monument, surmounted by an urn, of George Home, Bishop of Norwich, author of the\n\nCommentary on the Book of Psalms.\n\nHe was a native of Kent, and died in . He was buried in the vault of the Burtons, into whose family he had married. Thomas Dogget, the comedian, and founder of the\n\ncoat and silver badge\n\nwhich bears his name, and which is rowed for on the Thames by London watermen's apprentices annually on the , was buried here . We have already in a previous volume spoken at some length of Tom Dogget as an actor, and also of the aquatic contest which he instituted. We may add here that the only portrait of him that is known to exist is a small print representing him in the act of dancing\n\nThe Cheshire Round,\n\nwith the motto\n\nNe sutor ultra crepidam\n\n. Here, likewise, lies buried, among many others, Sir William James, the captor of Severndroog, on the coast of Malabar, in , of whom we have spoken in the preceding chapter.\n\nIn the hollow, on the north side of the church, by the side of the road leading to Woolwich, and near the footpath across the fields of Kidbrook, stands a long red-brick farmhouse, of Elizabethan architecture; it is known as Well Hall, and is said at time to have been the residence of Sir Thomas More's favourite daughter, Margaret Roper.\n\nAmong other notables who have dwelt in Eltham,\n\nwrites Mr. James Thorne, in his\n\nEnvirons of London,\n\nwas Vandyck, the painter, who lived here in the summer, tempted, it may be, by the residence in the Park Lodge of his friend, Sir Theodore de Mayerne, the king's physician, who was chief ranger of the park before it was seized by the Parliament.\n\nAccording to a statement of Walpole, in his\n\nAnecdotes of Painting in England,\n\nin an old house at Eltham, said to have been Vandyck's, Vertue saw several sketches of stories from Ovid in\n\ntwo\n\ncolours, ascribed to that great painter; but if they were his, all trace of them has long been lost, and of the house also. The quarrelsome Commonwealth major, John Lilburney-\n\nFreeborn John,\n\nas he was styled-Cromwell's opponent in the army and in the\n\nHouse of Commons\n\n, here spent his last years\n\nin perfect tranquillity.\n\nHaving joined the Quakers,\n\nhe preached among that sect in and about Eltham till his death\n\nthere,\n\nAugust 29th, 1657\n\n.\n\nHere Dr. James Sherard formed his famous botanic gardens, of which he published an account under the title of\n\nHortus Elthamensis.\n\nIn the preparation of this work he was assisted by Dillenius, who came to England in specially to superintend Dr. Sherard's garden, an event which, Dr. Lindley says,\n\nforms an important point in the history of botany in this country.\n\nLysons speaks of Dr. James Sherard as the founder of the botanical professorship at Oxford; and in this he is followed by most subsequent writers on Eltham.\n\nThe founder of the professorship,\n\nwrites Mr. Thorne,\n\nwas William Sherard, the Oriental traveller, the brother of James, who, however, was a zealous promoter of the science and patron of botanists.\n\nPassing on our way along the high road towards London, a short walk brings us to the rapidlyincreasing village of Lee, the principal part of which is built on the rising ground sloping up towards Blackheath. Since the formation of the branch line of the North Kent Railway through the parish, a considerable increase has been made in the number of dwellings, which are now springing up in every direction, in consequence of the easy facility of reaching town afforded by the railway. A small rivulet takes its rise in this parish, and, after watering the village, flows into the river Ravensbourne, in the adjoining parish of Lewisham. The church, dedicated to St. Margaret, dates its erection from the year , and stands on an eminence near Blackheath, on the opposite\n\n244\n\nside of the road to the old church, which has been demolished, with the exception of a small portion of the tower. The new church is a florid Gothic structure, consisting of nave, chancel, side aisles, with tower and spire; it is built of brick, and cemented, and ornamented with stone facings. The graveyard is crowded with monuments and tombs, among which is a plain tomb for Dr. Halley, the celebrated astronomer, who lies buried under it. Nathaniel Bliss, who succeeded Dr. Bradley in the post of Astronomer-Royal, also lies buried here.\n\nAt Lee lived Mr. Bohun (or Boone), the friend of John Evelyn and tutor to his sons; and here he was often visited by the genial old gossip. His house was a cabinet of curiosities, mostly Indian, Japanese, and Chinese, and adorned with carving by Grinling Gibbons. Mr. Bohun must have been more fortunate than most tutors, if he was able, as recorded by Evelyn, to build here and endow a hospital for poor persons, with a chapel attached. The almshouses, which are situated at the west end of the village, by the side of the high road, were rebuilt in . At the back of these are comfortable-looking houses, erected by the Merchant Taylors' Company, in which a number of widows of freemen belonging to that company are supported. At the south end of the parish, down to a comparatively recent date, were the remains of an ancient moated mansion, said to have been contemporary with the palace at Eltham; a fine avenue of lime-trees, some of which still remain, formed the approach to the entrance, and over the moat a strong brick arch is thrown. Dacre House is described in Hasted's\n\nKent\n\nas\n\nan elegant modern-built seat, late belonging to Sir Thomas Fludyer;\n\nit was long the seat of the Dacre family, whose name is perpetuated by of the streets in the village being named after them. John Timbs, in his , in describing a visit he once paid in his younger days to the then rural village of Lee, says :--\n\nHere I often saw the devout Lady Dacre crossing Lee Green in her daily pilgrimage to her dear lord's tomb in Lee churchyard. She usually rode there from Lee Place on a favourite pony, and wore a large drab beaver hat, and a woollen habit nearly trailing on the ground. At the foot of her lord's grave she was accustomed to kneel and pour forth a fervent prayer, beseeching the Creator again to join her in blissful union with her beloved husband in the realms above. At home she cherished her affection by placing his chair at the dinner-table as during his lifetime. After\n\nfourteen\n\nyears' widowhood, Lady Dacre died, in\n\n1808\n\n, and was buried with her husband,\n\nDuring our stay at Lee,\n\nadds Mr. Timbs,\n\nthe Green\n\nwas my favourite resort: here the village stocks excited my curiosity, and I soon understood the wooden machine to be used for the punishment of disorderly persons by securing their legs.\n\nMr. Timbs tells how that he rememlbered the stocks in many an English village, and also in many parts of London, that in , , being the last to disappear. He then reminds us how that\n\nthe rustic beauty of Lee has been sacrificed to the railway, and its rural sounds and songs to the noisy steam-horse; though the village possesses attractions for riper years, in its beautiful pointed church, rebuilt upon much older foundations; it is famed, too, for its brasses, and tombs of marble and alabaster; and for the resting-place of Halley, the Astronomer-Royal, who wrote a treatise on comets when he was\n\nnineteen\n\nyears old.\n\nFrom its proximity to Blackheath, and its easy distance from London, Lee has of late years become a favourite place of residence for City merchants and men of business, and every available plot of ground has been covered with terraces of detached and semi-detached villas and genteel cottages for their accommodation; and such names as Belmont Park, Manor Park, Dacre Park, , &c., in which the more respectable class of houses are built, imparts a somewhat pretentious air to the locality. New churches, too, have also sprung up, consequent upon the increased growth of the place. of these is , in Lee Park, a building in the Early English style of architecture, erected in ; another, and still more handsome edifice of similar architecture, is the Church of the Holy Trinity; this was built in .\n\nContinuing our course westward along the main road, we soon arrive at Lewisham, a parish and pleasant village situated on the Ravensbourne, a stream which, as we have already seen, flows through Deptford into the Thames. With regard to this stream, the\n\nKentish Traveller's Companion\n\n() says:\n\nThe river Ravensbourne directs its course through this parish; at the hamlet of Southend it moves the engine by which the late Mr. How made those knife-blades now so famous throughout England.\n\nThe name of this place is supposed to be derived from the Saxon a meadow, and , a dwelling. In the village and its vicinity are many handsome houses and detached villas, inhabited by opulent merchants and retired citizens, attracted hither by the salubrity of the air and the beauties of the surrounding country.\n\n245\n\nLying along the valley of the Ravensbourne, with the land rising gently on either side, Lewisham, down to a very recent date, was a pleasant rural district; but, like all the other outlying districts of London, the green fields which hemmed it in are fast giving place to bricks and mortar. Granville Park occupies the sloping ground on the north, between Lewisham and Blackheath.\n\nThe old parish church, dedicated to St. Mary, was taken down in , when the present edifice was erected on its site. The church is a plain oblong structure of stone, with a shallow, semicircular recess instead of a chancel at the east end, a square tower at the west end (the lower part of which is ancient), and a portico on the south side supported by Corinthian columns. This church, which was heated by means of a large stove and flues, having been opened for divine service on Christmas Day, , it is supposed that the flues becoming overheated, set fire to some portion of the woodwork of the interior, as at a very early hour on the following morning the building was discovered to be in flames, and notwithstanding every exertion, the conflagration continued till the interior of the church was almost entirely destroyed, leaving only the walls and roof standing. The inhabitants of the parish shortly after raised a handsome subscription to repair the injury thus occasioned. The church contains a few interesting monuments, particularly by Banks and another by Flaxman; the former, which has a poetical epitaph by Hayley, is in memory of a daughter of Mr. William Lushington; it represents an angel directing the mourning mother to the text inscribed above the tablet,\n\nBlessed are they that mourn,\n\n&c. In the churchyard is a monument, inscribed with some verses from his own\n\nFate of Genius,\n\nto the unfortunate young poet, Thomas Dermody, who was buried in , at the age of . Dermody, whose early death reminds us, in a certain sense, of the fate of Chatterton and Keats, was a native of Ennis, in Ireland, and was born in . He displayed poetical powers at an early age. In he published a volume of poems written in his year. In the following year appeared\n\nThe Rights of Justice,\n\na political pamphlet. In and he published\n\nPeace,\n\nThe Battle of the Bards,\n\nand other poems. Soon afterwards he became a soldier, but disgraced himself by intemperance, and died in poverty in the adjoining parish of Sydenham. In Mr. G. Raymond published his life, &c., in volumes, and subsequently his poetical works, under the title of\n\nThe Harp of Erin.\n\nThe parish of Lewisham contains several other churches, but only of these come under our notice here, namely, and St. Mark's. The former was built and endowed in by the Rev. S. Russell Davis; it was erected from the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott, and is in the Early English style of architecture. The church of St. Mark the Evangelist, in College Park, a rapidly rising district on the east side of the Road, is a handsome Decorated edifice, built in , from the designs of Mr. W. C. Banks.\n\nDown to a very recent date Lewisham consisted chiefly of principal street, and the road for the most part was bordered with lofty elms, many of which still remain in all their freshness. The salubrity of the air made the locality, at time, a favourite place of abode for London merchants and wealthy families, and it still retains a few good old houses. We learn from Hasted and other historians that the manor of Lewisham, with its appendages of Greenwich and Coombe, was given by Elthruda, King Alfred's niece, to the Abbey of St. Peter, at Ghent, to which Lewisham then became a cell, or\n\nalien\n\npriory; this grant is said to have been confirmed by King Edgar, and by Edward the Confessor. Kilburne tells us that Lewisham Priory was founded during the reign of Henry III., by Sir John Merbury; but it is more probable that he added to its endowments, and thus became its founder. Priory Farm, at the south end of Rushey Green, on the Road --now, in effect, a southern extension of Lewisham village-marks the site of the Benedictine priory.\n\nOn the suppression of alien priories by Henry V., this priory was transferred, together with the manor of Lewisham, to the monastery of Sheen, or Richmond. In it reverted to the Crown, with the other conventual property throughout the country; and years later it was granted for life to Thomas, Lord Seymour. John, Earl of Warwick, eldest son of the Duke of Northumberland, next possessed the manor, but on his attainder, in the year , it again reverted to the Crown. Queen Elizabeth, however, re-granted it to the earl's brother, Sir Ambrose Dudley, who had been restored in blood, and created Baron L'Isle and Earl of Warwick. James I. granted the manor to John Ramsay, Earl of Holderness. In it was sold to Reginald Grahame, who in turn conveyed it to [extra_illustrations.6.246.1] . His son William was, in , created Viscount Lewisham and Earl of Dartmouth, and with his descendants the property has since continued. Lord Dartmouth resided at his seat on Blackheath, in this parish, for which place, as we\n\n246\n\nhave already seen, he procured the grant of a market. [extra_illustrations.6.246.2]\n\ncharity-schools in Lewisham, of which is a free grammar-school, were founded by the Rev. Abraham Colfe, vicar of this parish, in the latter part of the century, and are under the patronage of the Leathersellers' Company. The intentions of the founder were extended by a scheme settled by the Court of Chancery in . There are also almshouses for poor women that owe their foundation to the same benevolent individual. Other almshouses have lately been erected in the village, under the will of Mr. John Thackeray, for poor females.\n\nHalf a mile to the south-east of the village is Hither Green, which, together with Catford and Catford Bridge, on the Ravensbourne, and also Rushey Green (mentioned above), are hamlets belonging to Lewisham.\n\nA narrow lane turning out of the main road by the side of the parish church, leads our steps to Ladywell, a spot doubtless so called from a well or spring whose waters were at time held in\n\nveneration by the\n\nfaithful.\n\nHere there is a station on the Mid-Kent Railway. Close by is Brockle) Hill, across which are pleasant walks to Dulwich, Peckham, and other outlying places which we shall presently visit. Between Ladywell Station and Brockley Lane is the cemetery belonging to the parishes of Deptford and Lewisham; it covers a large space of ground, and is tastefully laid out.\n\nRetracing our steps through the village, and leaving on our right the station on the North Kent Railway, we make our way up Loam Pit Hill, passing the church of , lately built, and soon find ourselves at New Cross, an outlying district belonging to the parish of Deptford. This noted locality, which takes its name from the old coaching-house and hostelry bearing the sign of the\n\nGolden Cross,\n\nhas been famous for at least a couple of centuries; for John Evelyn tells us in his\n\nDiary,\n\nunder date of , how he went to\n\nNew Crosse\n\nfrom Saye's Court, in his coach, to accompany his friend, Lord Berkeley, as far as Dover, on his way to Paris as ambassador. It may amuse the reader to learn that his lordship's retinue consisted of coaches (exclusive of Evelyn's), as many wagons, and\n\nabout\n\nforty\n\nhorses.\n\nOur diplomatists move about now-a-days with less state and less incumbrance.\n\nOn Counter Hill, Upper Lewisham Road, the rising ground in the rear of the tavern, stands the Royal Naval School, a good substantial-looking brick building, with white stone dressings, the\n\nfirst\n\nstone\n\nof which was laid by Prince Albert, in , on the\n\nGlorious\n\nFirst of June\n\n,\n\nthe anniversary of Lord Howe's victory. To the traveller who steps from the New Cross station to the main road, it presents an imposing appearance, with its long line of red-brick frontage, its numerous windows, its sweep of green turf before the house, its iron outer gates, and its great gates of oak, which, when open, disclose the quadrangle and the arcades under which the boys wander after school-hours when not disposed for play in the spacious grounds beyond. The school, which was founded and provisionally opened at Camberwell in , has an average of pupils, mostly the sons of naval and military officers in necessitous circumstances; and the object of the school is to qualify them, at the least possible expense, for any pursuit, giving a preference to the orphans of those who may have fallen in their country's service. Since the opening of the school, in , upwards of boys have partaken of its advantages, many of whom had distinguished themselves, and several had lost their lives in the service of their country. During the years previous to more than pupils had become naval officers, many of them distinguished men. During the same period pupils had entered as officers in the Royal Marines, - of that number having gained the Artillery, and having passed in their entrance examinations. Captain Sir George Nares, who lately commanded the Arctic Expedition, won his way into the Royal Navy by gaining in this school the Admiralty Prize Naval Cadetship in . Colonel Sir F. W. Festing, who so gallantly distinguished himself in the Ashantee campaign, also passed direct from this school into the Royal Marine Artillery. These are but out of the many pupils who have distinguished themselves in the service of their country.\n\nAt New Cross are important stations and works on the South-Eastern, and also on the London, Brighton, and South-coast Railways.\n\nThe manor of Hatcham, in the immediate\n\n248\n\nneighbourhood of the above-mentioned station, was at time part and parcel of the parish of St. Paul, Deptford; but, pursuant to an Act of Parliament, it has been created a distinct parish, called Hatcham New Town. The church, dedicated tc St. James, is a large and lofty Gothic edifice; it was consecrated in , but was only recently completed. In this church acquired considerable notoriety from the ritualistic practices of its incumbent, who was suspended on that account from his spiritual functions by order of Court of Canterbury, under Lord Penzance."
