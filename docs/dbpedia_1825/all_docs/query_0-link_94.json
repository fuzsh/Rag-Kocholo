        "text": "Scotland's medieval history was dominated by its experience during the Wars of Independence which ran from 1296 to around 1357. During this conflict, Scotland suffered periods of prolonged occupation, with its towns the key points of defence and supply as English kings sought to conquer the kingdom to the north. The period of the Second Scottish War of Independence (1332-1357) has not been studied as consistently or in as much detail as its more famous forebear. And yet this was a period, again, when English armies marched north to conquer parts of Scotland and occupied Scottish urban centres. This time, however, the English did so in alliance with a Scottish ally-Edward Balliol, claimant to the Scottish throne. This altered the political and military situation and resulted in Scottish towns being controlled either by English or pro-Balliol forces. Of particular interest is the reaction of these towns to these periods of occupation, and the impact war and occupation had on these urban communities. Even in those towns controlled by English forces, record evidence suggests that the picture was complex. Scots, for example, served as soldiers in English garrisons at Stirling, Edinburgh and Roxburgh. Traders continued to load and export goods from English-held Leith and Berwick. And the people of Perth appear to have had a very interesting relationship with their English captain, who worked hard to ensure that the town and its people were supplied with food from the English crown. Of course, not all people acquiesced so readily with English forces, and other examples demonstrate the extent to which opposition to English/Balliol control remained a factor during the principal years of occupation. This paper will, therefore, consider the Scottish urban experience during this period and analyse the extent to which Scottish towns were affected by war and occupation, and the involvement of townsmen in these events. I\n\nAlmost a century ago, Evan Macleod Barron wrote his book The Scottish war of independence: a critical study (1914). In amongst the literary flourishes that informed his style of writing, Barron revealed an area of study that had been largely ignored in previous works – the history of the Scottish War of Independence as it related to northern Scotland. In particular, he brought to light the understudied figure of Andrew Moray of Bothwell. Rescuing him from his previous position in the shadow of William Wallace, Barron created a new area of interest within studies of this crucial period in Scottish medieval history. In spite of this, however, Moray remains a figure on the periphery of Scottish History. Moreover, modern historiography has extended the period of the Scottish Wars of Independence beyond the endpoint adopted by Barron, that of 1328. As we enter the period of the Second War of Independence, another Andrew Moray appears as a figure fighting for Scotland’s freedom from England, but remains a figure few people know much about. This talk will, therefore, consider the place of these two men – father and son – within the history of this period and attempt to fully examine their importance as leaders of Scottish resistance to English conquest.\n\nI would argue that most people's understanding of the Scottish wars of Independence lies with the figures of Wallace and Bruce, with the battles at Stirling Bridge and here at Bannockburn, and that less is known about what happened afterwards. In part this is understandable. The first war was written about far more in medieval sources than the events that followed. As a consequence it attracted greater focus by historians as there was more to write about. Secondly, the first war has a good number of heroes. It has Scottish battlefield victories. And it has exciting material like John Barbour's Bruce to act as the basic narrative for what historians have come to write. For those looking to construct a heroic history of little-old Scotland's fight against its larger and more powerful neighbour to the south, a fight it ultimately \"won\", there is little better opportunity. And such has been perpetuated and represented in modern sources, including those starring either an Australian or an American. And, to be perfectly honest, at first glance the war that commenced in 1332 appears to lack all of these things. Instead of a unified Scotland acting against the English invader, we instead have a resumption of civil war in the kingdom. Figures such as Wallace and Bruce, Randolph and Douglas, appear lacking in amongst a cast of Scottish nobles who fought for themselves, and whose loyalty was a fluid thing. Battlefield defeats are the order of the day, with the large-scale and less-known failures at Dupplin Moor, Halidon Hill and Neville's Cross creating a catalogue of disaster that has seen many historians struggle to understand why Scottish commanders apparently forgot the lessons of Robert I. And there is no doubt that such events happened. But at the same time we have to remember that the context in which they occurred was also different. Robert I gained immeasurably from fighting against the weak and militarily incapable Edward II, a king with little interest in Scotland, and who showed little ability to affect change when he did cross the border. Scotland's leaders in the second conflict faced a very different enemy and a more"
