        "text": "Maidstone Athletic Ground, ca 1900\n\nAethelberht I, King of Kent (ca 550-616)\n\nAethelberht I was the greatest of the kings who ruled Kent for nearly 400 years before Wessex imposed national rule from Winchester. Unusually for the age, he was not a warrior king, but is famed for his role in replacing Germanic paganism with Christianity. Probably at the behest of his Frankish wife Bertha, he agreed to St Augustine’s visit from Rome that led directly to the establishment of the Catholic Church in England. The great influence this lent him led to his being recognised as Bretwalda – overlord of the various Anglo-Saxon kings who had settled in Britain. Under his peaceful 27-year rule from Canterbury, the first English law code and coinage were introduced. He also ordered the construction of the first St Paul’s Cathedral. For his piety, he was honoured as a saint, and is commemorated by a statue in Rochester Cathedral.\n\nEadgifu of Kent, Queen of England (d post-966)\n\nAlthough she was Queen of England, only some bare facts are known of Eadgifu’s Dark Age life. She was the daughter of Sigehelm, a Kentish ealdorman who died at the Battle of the Holme when she was small. Around 919, she became the third wife of Alfred the Great’s elder son, King Edward the Elder, one of the doughtiest military leaders of the era. After his death in 924, she had trouble with property dealings, most notably concerning Cooling, which she inherited from her father. A certain Goda had loaned him money, accepting the estate as security, and later denied having been reimbursed, which provoked a protracted dispute. She was on the wrong end of her stepson King Athelstan’s ruling concerning Goda’s charters, suggesting that they didn’t get on. However, she did prove influential in the reigns of her sons Edmund and Eadred, both of whom were crowned kings of the English.\n\nStrongbow (1130-76)\n\nRichard FitzGilbert was one of William of Normandy’s closest allies in the conquest of Anglo-Saxon England. His loyalty was rewarded with estates at Tonbridge and at Clare in Suffolk; his powerful clan became known as the de Clares. His Tonbridge-born great-grandson Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke – who inherited his father’s nickname, ‘Strongbow’ – entered history in 1167 when Diarmait MacMurchada, King of Leinster, appealed for Norman help after being deposed. Strongbow agreed to join an invasion plan in return for the hand of MacMurchada’s daughter Aoife. The reconquest of Leinster was carried out successfully, albeit against the instructions of King Henry II of England. Henry used his interdiction as a reason to relieve de Clare of most of his estates in Ireland and elsewhere, and imposed his overlordship on Leinster – a crucial springboard for further Norman imperialism. Strongbow, who died of an infection and was buried at Dublin, is commemorated in the name of Bulmer’s famous cider.\n\nSir Bartholomew de Badlesmere (1275-1322)\n\nBadlesmere’s life was a tale of courtly intrigue gone wrong. Born at Chilham Castle, he fought for King Edward I as a young man in France and Scotland. Initially he got on with the King’s successor Edward II, being appointed custodian of Leeds Castle in 1317 after already inheriting land at Badlesmere. From this position of strength, he formed an alliance with other nobles to seek influence, and helped make peace between the King and the hostile Earl of Lancaster in 1318. As late as 1320 he entertained Edward lavishly at Chilham. However, the King’s dubious affiliation with the Despensers led to a rift. In 1321, Badlesmere joined Lancaster’s faction, causing the king to bar him from Kent and provoke the Siege of Leeds Castle in his absence. The rebels fled north, but were defeated at Boroughbridge in 1322. Badlesmere was shown no mercy, being horse-drawn from Canterbury to Blean, hanged, beheaded, and ignominiously displayed for years.\n\nJohn of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-36)\n\nFor three years, John – who rather obviously was born at Eltham Palace – was heir to the English throne, until the birth of his brother Edward III’s son, the Black Prince. Although he was the child of Edward II and Isabella of France, neither of whom had much to recommend them, John rather took after his grandfather Edward I in his martial spirit. Certainly his brother valued his ability, and made efforts to secure him a good marriage. The two accompanied each other on the 1333 invasion of Scotland, leading immediately to a battle against a Scots army that was attempting to relieve John de Balliol’s siege of Berwick. Their victory was total. John was subsequently accused of a massacre of Scottish sanctuary-seekers, although the truth of the story is disputed. The Scots enjoyed some schadenfreude three years later, when John fell sick at Perth and died. He was buried in a carved tomb at Westminster Abbey.\n\nJohn Gower (ca 1330-1408)\n\nIt is not known for sure that Gower was born in Kent, but he owned estates in Kent and East Anglia, and linguistic analysis has suggested a Kentish provenance. Few outside of literary circles know of him today; yet he was not only a friend of Geoffrey Chaucer, but also thought his equal in their lifetimes. In addition to his poetic talent, he was noteworthy for being equally able to write in Middle French, Latin, and Middle English, which he did respectively in ‘Mirour de l’Omme’, ‘Vox Clamantis’, and ‘Confessio Amantis’. The first contains one of his most dramatic passages, describing the Devil’s wedding to the seven sins’ daughters; while the last and best, a collection of love stories, inspired part of Shakespeare’s ‘Pericles, Prince of Tyre’ (ca 1608), in which Gower also appears repeatedly as the Chorus. Unfortunately, the didacticism of his writing later earned him a reputation as a bore that persisted unchallenged until the C20.\n\nJohn Kemp, Archbishop of Canterbury (ca 1380-1454)\n\nOxford-educated John Kemp from Olantigh, Wye, did so well as a church lawyer that he counted Bishop of Rochester, Archbishop of York, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal-Bishop of Santa Rufina among his ecclesiastical titles, yet also managed to be Keeper of the Privy Seal and Lord Chancellor. The key to his success was supporting the right side during the Wars of the Roses, which meant unwavering support for Henry IV’s half-brother Henry Beaufort, the powerful prelate behind the Lancastrian throne. Even during Henry V’s reign, Kemp officiated at the trial of the troublesome Sir John Oldcastle, and he assisted Henry VI both with his marriage to Margaret d’Anjou in 1445 and during Jack Cade’s Rebellion in 1450. When Henry VI had a mental breakdown in 1453, however, Richard of York stepped in. Kemp, branded “the curséd cardinal”, soon died, and was buried in the Cathedral choir. His most lasting legacy was Wye College, which survived until 2009.\n\nRichard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers (1405-69)\n\nFor a man born of relatively humble origins in Maidstone, Richard Woodville’s extraordinary story surely merits telling in a Hollywood movie. Like his father before him, he became chamberlain to the Duke of Bedford. His big break came when the duke died suddenly, and Woodville married his wealthy 21-year-old widow Jacquetta of Luxembourg before anyone could intervene. More luck came his way when Margaret of Anjou, a relative of Jacquetta by marriage, became queen, and Sir Richard became Baron Rivers. Further honours followed when he took up a military career. He switched sides in the Wars of the Roses, following which the Yorkist Edward IV married Woodville’s daughter Elizabeth. The aristocracy was horrified by the power enjoyed by these upstarts, and the powerful Earl of Warwick made it his business to do for them. After the Battle of Edgecote Moor, Woodville and his son John were taken prisoner and summarily beheaded.\n\nSir John Fogge (ca 1417-90)\n\nFogge, from the Canterbury area, inherited his adventurer father’s estates in 1438. In service with the Lancastrian Henry VI in 1450 when Jack Cade’s Rebellion was crushed, he was rewarded for his loyalty by being made Sheriff of Kent, Comptroller of the Household, and a knight. His second wife was related to the Yorkist Woodvilles, however, and became a lady-in-waiting of Queen Elizabeth. Knowing the undependable King, Fogge switched sides when Edward IV invaded in 1460, and again profited richly as MP for Kent and for Canterbury. Even the Lancastrian success at the 2nd Battle of St Albans in 1461 benefitted him: he inherited Westenhanger Castle when his late first wife’s father, Sir Thomas Kyriell, was executed there. Although Fogge backed Buckingham’s failed revolt against Richard III, Henry VII’s usurpation brought him salvation. Having built Ashford church’s tower and founded its college, Fogge was buried there in a capacious tomb, and is recalled by a local street name.\n\nWilliam Caxton (ca 1420-1491)\n\nThough Caxton’s date and place of birth are not precisely known, he reported that he’d been born and bred in the Weald of Kent. A successful merchant, he settled in Bruges while still in his twenties. There he learned of Gutenberg’s revolutionary new printing press, and set up his own. The first printed work in English, in 1473, was his own translation of a French work called ‘Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye’. After returning to England, the first book he published was an altogether more famous one: an edition of Chaucer’s ‘The Canterbury Tales’. Most of his output was in English, which helped put this relatively parochial language on the literary map. Since Caxton often had to decide between alternative dialect words, such as ‘egges’ (from Danish) or ‘eyren’ (from German), he also contributed to the standardisation of the language. A stained-glass window commemorates him in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThomas Linacre (ca 1460-1524)\n\nFive centuries after Anselm of Canterbury fathered Scholasticism – the dogma that dominated Europe throughout the Middle Ages – a man born in Canterbury would accelerate its demise and the birth of Western thought. Thomas Linacre was a pupil of first The King’s School and then William Tilly of Selling, the Prior of Christ Church, Canterbury. In 1485, they were sent by King Henry VII on a prolonged embassy to the Vatican. In Italy, Linacre studied at Padua, where he became imbued with the spirit of the Renaissance. He collected and translated Ancient Greek manuscripts that would significantly catalyse the new Humanist school in England. His legendary integrity earned him an international reputation, his pupils including the immensely influential Dutch philosopher Erasmus. Specialising in medicine, he founded the Royal College of Physicians, paving the way for William Harvey’s ground-breaking medical work via Francis Bacon’s scientific method. Linacre is commemorated in the names of a King’s School house and an Oxford College.\n\nThomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire (1477-1539)\n\nBest known as Anne Boleyn’s father, the 1st Earl of Wiltshire has been depicted in more than one dramatisation as an unscrupulous schemer. It’s debatable however whether the wealth of honours he acquired brought him much joy. He was born at Hever Castle, which his grandfather, a rich mercer, had purchased. It was inevitable that Henry VIII, another Kentishman, would get to know Boleyn’s two free and easy daughters, and that he would have relations with both. Even Boleyn’s wife Elizabeth was said to be the King’s lover, though he denied it. The obliging Boleyn’s power grew until he became Lord Privy Seal; but all turned sour when Henry had Anne and her brother George executed. Boleyn spent his last years in disgrace after the King took away his castle; both his wife and remaining child Mary died soon after him. No wonder his ghost is said to haunt his one-time home, Blickling Hall in Norfolk.\n\nCatherine of York (1479-1527)\n\nWhen Eltham Palace was still a premier royal residence, Catherine of York was born there, the ninth child of Edward IV and Queen Elizabeth. Like all her siblings, she was declared illegitimate by Richard III in 1483, and took refuge with her mother in Westminster Abbey. Richard’s successor Henry VII, her brother-in-law, hoped she might make a good marriage with some foreign king or prince, but instead she wed William Courtenay, heir to the Earl of Devon, at sixteen. This was a perfectly satisfactory arrangement until, having been implicated in 1504 in a plot to depose Henry, he was gaoled and deprived of his property and right to inherit. Although these were restored by Henry VIII in 1509, Courtenay died at 36. Uninterested in further political matches, the young widow vowed never to marry again, and retired from public life to Devon. She did however make a public appearance in 1516 as a godmother at Mary Tudor’s baptism.\n\nBridget of York (1480-1507)\n\nConsidering that she was a royal princess, surprisingly little is known of the life of Bridget, the youngest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. It began at Eltham Palace, his favourite country palace. He died when she was not yet three, and Elizabeth removed her daughters to Westminster Abbey as sanctuary from the clutches of Richard III; Bridget and all her siblings were declared illegitimate and lost their titles. Her name, highly unusual for an English royal, was probably suggested by the name of Sweden’s St Bridget, founder of the Order of Bridgettines. It was appropriate, since the princess eschewed royal celebrity in favour of spiritual celibacy. Around the age of nine, she was sent to Dartford Priory, and spent the rest of her short life there. It is not known why she died so young, but she was at least spared the dismal fate of her two older brothers, the Princes in the Tower.\n\nSir John Baker (1488-1558)\n\nBaker was born in Cranbrook, studied law, became Recorder of London in 1526, and a decade later was appointed Attorney General under Henry VIII, a post he retained for five years. In the meantime he was MP for London among other constituencies, and late in life represented Kent three times while serving for 13 years as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He earned his nickname ‘Bloody Baker’ for his vicious prosecution of Protestants during the reign of Mary I. He was supposedly on his way to mete out retribution when he heard that Mary had died, and turned back in the street leading east out of Cranbrook known today as Bakers Cross; he died the following month. He left a less unsavoury legacy: his estate was Sissinghurst Castle, which his grandfather had bought. Because his daughter Cicely married Thomas Sackville, the 1st Earl of Dorset, the Castle eventually fell into the hands of Vita Sackville-West, co-creator of its magnificent gardens.\n\nHenry VIII, King of England (1491-1547)\n\nHenry Tudor, born in Greenwich, boded well at first. Strapping, charming, and intelligent, he’d but one great vice: an appetite for lovers that continued even after his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Had she borne him a viable son, they might still have lived a quiet life; but their divorce in 1533 ushered in ten years of horror. Two of his next five wives were executed, another was divorced, one died after giving birth, and the last was lucky. Henry took his place in history by casting off the Catholic Church for the sake of his first divorce, ushering in the English Reformation and the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Asserting the Divine Right of Kings, he became increasingly tyrannical after a serious jousting accident in 1536. It’s curious that, had his elder brother Arthur not suddenly died at 15, we’d have been denied England’s most colourful monarch, and world history might have taken another course.\n\nWilliam Lambe (1495-1580)\n\nFrom a modest background in Sutton Valence, Lambe earned a fortune as a cloth manufacturer. An excellent proponent of the Protestant work ethic, he was as much a worshipper as he was a businessman, and became renowned for the amount of time he spent at prayer. His piety also extended to good works. He purchased a disused chapel in London Wall in 1542 and bequeathed it to the Worshipful Company of Clothmakers, of which he had been master. In 1577, he paid at great expense for a new conduit at Holborn to channel water to the London Charterhouse, and provided buckets so that poor women could sell water for a living. Known as Lamb’s Conduit, it was demolished in 1746, but its name survives in those of two thoroughfares. He also endowed Sutton Valence School in 1578. He is commemorated by a bust at St James’ church, Islington, whose maintenance is partly funded by the William Lambe Trust.\n\nGeorge Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham (~1497-1558)\n\nAs the lord of Cobham Manor during the Tudor era, Brooke inevitably lived in interesting times, being so close to the epicentre of the Tudor family’s turbulence. He was father to Elisabeth Brooke, who at length married Catherine Parr’s brother Lord Northampton, and like them supported the succession of Lady Jane Grey, the ‘Nine-Day Queen’. Consequently, he was lucky to survive the vengeful reign of Mary I. When Thomas Wyatt the Younger of Allington Castle revolted in 1554, the rebel army made a mysterious detour to Cooling Castle, where Lord Cobham was in residence. Barred admission, Wyatt wasted crucial hours laying waste to the castle before Brooke surrendered. Brooke was nevertheless suspected of collusion, and briefly jailed in the Tower. He did redeem himself by welcoming the papal legate Cardinal Pole to Cooling in 1555, and survived to die in his bed a month before his wife Anne. Their effigies can still be seen in Cobham church.\n\nThe Very Reverend Nicholas Wotton (ca 1497-1567)\n\nOne of the Wottons of Bocton (Boughton) Place in Boughton Malherbe, Nicholas studied law at Oxford and was ordained, being handed the livings of Ivychurch, Sutton Valence, and his local parish. Like his namesake the C15 Lord Mayor of London, however, he plainly had more worldly ambitions. After serving the Bishop of London, he was sent on a mission in 1539 to cement Henry VIII’s marriage to Anne of Cleves, and escorted her to Kent; unlike Thomas Cromwell, however, he survived the fiasco that followed. Indeed, he became dean of both Canterbury and York, and was sent to negotiate with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1543, performing so well that Henry appointed him his own executor. He went on to provide dependable ambassadorial service to three further monarchs, was briefly Minister of State, and in 1560 signed the Treaty of Edinburgh on Elizabeth I’s behalf. He was buried at Canterbury Cathedral in an elaborate tomb.\n\nSir Anthony Browne (~1500-48)\n\nHenry VII’s standard-bearer Sir Anthony Browne (1443-1506) was governor of Queenborough Castle, where his eldest son, also Anthony, was born. The lad won his first royal appointments in his late teens, and already by 1522 had become a diplomat, latterly in France. Having proved his worth by putting down a Catholic rising, he became Master of the Horse, and survived as a trusted confidant of Henry VIII until the latter’s death. Henry’s trust in him was demonstrated by a famous incident at Rochester in 1540, when Browne was sent to check out the newly arrived Anne of Cleves. Mortified to find that she was not the beauty they had been promised, he bravely broke the news, and the two debated the matter while travelling to Greenwich. Far from being indicted like Thomas Cromwell, Browne was knighted and awarded Battle Abbey. His second wife, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, was a direct descendant of Elizabeth Woodville.\n\nSir Thomas Wyatt the Elder (1503-42)\n\nThough best known for sharing his name with a prominent pub in Maidstone, Thomas Wyatt was well known in his day as a poet, a politician, and the father of an ill-starred revolutionary. He was born in Allington Castle, the son of one of Henry VII’s privy councillors. He became a diplomat and got embroiled in Henry VIII’s efforts to persuade the Pope to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Things turned sour when, like several others, he was accused of adultery with Anne Boleyn and thrown into the Tower; it took Thomas Cromwell’s intervention to get him off the hook. He also had literary ambitions, seeking to popularise the sonnet as a poetic form in the hope of raising the literary status of English to that of Italian. His poems, though technically precise, innovatively subjective and mercifully short, are little read today. He died young, though not as young as his eldest son Thomas Wyatt the Younger.\n\nThomas Tallis (ca 1505-85)\n\nNo one knows for sure where composer Thomas Tallis was born, but he is reasonably assumed to be Kentish because his first job was at Dover Priory, he progressed to a prestigious post at Canterbury Cathedral, and he was living in Greenwich when he died. The remarkable thing about him is the admirable way he kept his head through a singularly dangerous period in history. A staunch Catholic, he performed his compositions not only for Mary I but also the Protestant monarchs Henry VIII, Edward VI and Elizabeth I, adapting to their personal preferences. His body of work is therefore relatively versatile for that epoch. He is little known today to the general public, but is reckoned by music buffs to be one of the best-ever English composers, and still regularly features in choral concerts. One of Vaughan Williams’ most famous works is his ‘Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis’.\n\nElizabeth Barton (1506-34)\n\nWhether Barton merited the title ‘Holy Maid’ or ‘Mad Maid’ of Kent depends on one’s religious perspective. Of humble origins in Aldington, she became maidservant to a local farmer. After an illness, she turned into a visionary, making prophecies and generally extolling the Roman Catholic calling. Her miraculous work made her a celebrity, and she won a comfortable place as a nun at a Canterbury priory. When Cardinal Wolsey checked her out and gave his blessing, she had it made. Like so much in that era, however, all hinged on the monarch, Henry VIII. She’d vocally supported his resistance to Lutheranism, but his rebellion against Rome left her in a quandary. She decided to oppose his Reformation, claiming she had seen the place in hell reserved for Henry if he should remarry. It was a foolish choice. In no time at all, her head was being displayed on a spike on London Bridge. Given Henry’s reputation, ‘Mad Maid’ sounds right.\n\nJane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland (ca 1508-55)\n\nKentish maid Jane Guildford grew up with John Dudley, her father’s ward after Henry VIII executed his father. The two married in 1525 and had 13 children, including Guildford Dudley, who later married Lady Jane Grey. A lady-in-waiting under Henry, she became Catherine Parr’s good friend, while John, an able administrator, became the Duke of Northumberland in 1551 and chief counsellor to the boy king Edward VI. In 1553, it fell primarily to Northumberland to enforce his daughter-in-law’s succession in accordance with Edward’s will. Princess Mary usurped the throne in a Catholic putsch, however, and Northumberland was executed, even after desperately recanting his Protestantism. Although Lady Northumberland’s son and royal daughter-in-law were likewise decapitated months later, she connived with the retinue of Philip II of Spain, Mary’s husband, to save her other sons, who included Robert, the future Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth I’s favourite. Before dying, Jane even became Philip Sidney’s godmother; the godfather was Philip II.\n\nSir Nicholas Bacon (1510-79)\n\nNicholas Bacon was born in Chislehurst and studied law on his way to becoming a career politician. He ingratiated himself with Henry VIII so well that, after the English Reformation, the King gifted him four manors. His fortunes went sharply into reverse when the Catholic Mary I took the throne, but recovered under Elizabeth I to the extent that he was made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal – not a job at a zoo, but an honorific title indicating that he took charge of the wax seal used by the monarch to signal her consent to documents. He remained staunchly anti-Catholic, opposing the restoration of Mary, Queen of Scots as well as Elizabeth’s mooted marriage to a French duke. His greatest legacy was his youngest son Sir Francis Bacon, who in 1620 would publish the book that expounded a formal basis for empirical investigation, ushering in the age of science.\n\nThomas Culpeper (ca 1514-41)\n\nThomas Culpeper from Bedgebury enjoyed courtly connections that secured him work for the royal family, procuring luxury goods such as hawks for hunting. Culpeper did well for himself, buying Higham Court at Bridge when just 20. Responsible at length even for dressing and undressing the portly Henry, he ingratiated himself to the extent that he was rewarded with various gifts of property; and, when either he or his brother was responsible for a rape and a murder in 1539, the guilty party was pardoned. It all went wrong when the ageing King married Catherine Howard. The 17-year-old Queen took a shine to the handsome Culpeper, inviting him regularly to her bedchamber. His designs may have been purely political; but, with Archbishop Cranmer already investigating rumours of the Queen’s premarital indiscretions, an incriminating letter found in Culpeper’s chamber was decisive. After pointlessly protesting his innocence, Culpeper was executed, along with the Queen and her lady-in-waiting.\n\nMary I, Queen of England (1516-58)\n\nLike her father Henry VIII, Mary Tudor was born at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich. Unlike him, she had a Spanish Catholic mother, and took great exception when her father renounced the Catholic Church, divorced her mother, and had Mary declared illegitimate. Her brother, who succeeded in 1547 as Edward VI, feared what would happen if ever Mary wore the crown, and changed the law in favour of his first cousin once removed, Lady Jane Grey. On his early death in 1553, Mary usurped the throne and had the young Grey put to death. She then heaped savage retribution on Protestants, having around 300 burned at the stake. Worse, she married King Philip II of Spain, soon to be England’s mortal enemy. The nation was ruined economically, suffered famine, and significantly lost Calais, its last possession in France. Though Catholic historians have attempted to repair her reputation, any impartial observer might feel she’d earned her epithet, ‘Bloody Mary’.\n\nJohn Hales (ca 1516-72)\n\nLargely self-educated, John Hales from Hales Place in High Halden worked for Thomas Cromwell and then Sir Ralph Sadler, the Clerk of the Hanaper, who was responsible for sealing legal documents. Hales was jailed in 1649-50 for supporting the economic policies of the disgraced Duke of Somerset, and fled abroad when Mary I took the throne. After returning during Elizabeth I’s reign, he made himself deeply unpopular with his ‘A Declaration of the Succession of the Crown Imperial of England’, a tract in which he argued that the line of descent should pass through Henry VIII’s younger sister Mary Tudor, queen of France. This presumptuousness outraged Elizabeth so much that Hales spent years in jail and under house arrest. He died unmarried in London. He may have salvaged his reputation posthumously as the probable author of ‘The Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England’ (published 1581), arguably the first text on economics.\n\nSir James Wilsford (ca 1516-50)\n\nThe Rough Wooing was a war between England and Scotland occasioned by Henry VIII’s efforts to enforce the Treaty of Greenwich of 1543, whereby Prince Edward and Mary Stuart were contracted to marry. One prominent figure in it was James Wilsford from Cranbrook, a provost marshall in the Duke of Somerset’s army. Efficient and highly popular with the troops, he participated in the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh (1547), when the Scots unaccountably panicked and were butchered by the English cavalry. Having been knighted and assisted in manning a fort at Lauder, he was placed in charge of Haddington Castle near Edinburgh, which happened to be stricken by plague. He was captured early in 1549 while at the coast and imprisoned in Stirling Castle; he was described by the Scottish Queen consort as “a good catch“. A sick man, he was allowed home after nearly a year in captivity, and took up posts at Gravesend and Otford.\n\nSir Thomas Wyatt the Younger (1521-54)\n\nThe son of Sir Thomas, the poet-politician, Wyatt the Younger was born at Chatham, and inherited Allington Castle and Boxley Abbey in 1542. Although born a Catholic, his experience of the Inquisition while accompanying his father on a diplomatic mission made him hostile to Catholic Spain. Ever the rebellious sort, he joined forces with three Protestant lords violently opposed to Queen Mary’s plan to marry Philip II of Spain, who would thereby become king consort of England. Their plot to overthrow her was uncovered, and the others gave up. Wyatt alone persisted. In January 1554 at Allington, he drew up plans for the Revolt that bears his name. After marching on London, his army was finally repulsed at Ludgate. He was tortured extensively in the vain hope that he would incriminate Princess Elizabeth, Mary’s Protestant sister. Although cleared of attempted regicide, he was inevitably executed. Some wag added insult to injury by stealing his head as a trophy.\n\nSir Roger Manwood (1525-92)\n\nBest known from the name of the grammar school he co-funded, Manwood was a draper’s son who was born and attended school in his native Sandwich. Having trained to be a barrister, he became Recorder for Sandwich and an MP before ending up a legal bigwig. Possessed of an acute legal brain, he was a hardliner who took little pity on transgressors. Although appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1578, he had a great facility for corruption and other misdemeanours, and was repeatedly reprimanded. Having granted him a manor at Hackington in 1563, Elizabeth I herself eventually chastised him; ironically, he was a governor of the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School (now Colfe’s) in Lewisham. His wealth did enable him to save his soul by lavishly sponsoring philanthropic causes, including almshouses, church bells, and a gaol in Canterbury, where he was buried. Christopher Marlowe wrote a cryptic verse eulogy to him in Latin.\n\nElisabeth Brooke, Marchioness of Northampton (1526-65)\n\nThe eldest daughter of George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham of Kent, Elisabeth became a maid of honour to Catherine Howard, Henry VIII’s queen consort, at 14. She attracted the interest of Catherine Parr’s married brother William, the future Marquess of Northampton, who was prohibited by law from remarrying after divorce. After Queen Catherine’s execution, Elisabeth was sent to live at Chelsea, Middlesex with three future queens: Catherine Parr, Elizabeth Tudor, and Jane Grey. Under Edward VI, she witnessed at close quarters the forcible removal and execution of his Lord Protector, the Duke of Somerset, whose replacement by Northampton’s good friend, Lord Northumberland, enabled the couple finally to marry in 1551. They were inevitably jailed when Mary I succeeded Edward, but Elizabeth I freed them and restored their fortunes. Nevertheless, their happiness was cut short. Stricken by breast cancer, Elisabeth fruitlessly sought help in the Netherlands, only to suffer the unwanted attentions of a servant, who consequently was jailed.\n\nSir Francis Walsingham (ca 1532-90)\n\nProbably born at Foots Cray Place, Francis Walsingham was the devil incarnate to Roman Catholics, but to modern eyes rather resembles a C16 incarnation of James Bond’s ‘M’. After Cambridge, he became a lawyer, but exiled himself when Mary I commenced her persecution of Protestants. On returning after her death, he became a trusted adviser to Elizabeth I. In 1572, he was deeply affected by his experience as ambassador in France, when he witnessed the massacre of up to 30,000 Protestants ordered by Queen Catherine. Thereafter he showed extreme prejudice towards Catholics, opposing all rapprochements with France and Spain and ruthlessly crushing repeated plots against Elizabeth’s life. Chief among these was the Babington Plot, intended to put Mary Queen of Scots on the English throne. It was Walsingham’s spy ring that unearthed the fateful evidence, and he who pressed successfully for Mary’s execution. After serving unfailingly as the Queen’s personal secretary for 17 years, he died of cancer back at Foots Cray.\n\nElizabeth I, Queen of England (1533-1603)\n\nGood Queen Bess’s 44-year reign now seems brief compared with her modern namesake’s; but its length was a blessed relief after the turmoil of the last quarter century. Considering the adversity she faced, it’s only a wonder it lasted so long. She was born at Placentia Palace in Greenwich, three years before her mother was executed by her father. Her half-brother who succeeded him died at 15, following which their half-sister Queen Mary I imprisoned her in the Tower. At 25, however, Elizabeth was herself crowned. In addition to an attack of smallpox, she survived numerous plots and rebellions. Perhaps her most glorious achievement was presiding over the destruction of Philip II of Spain’s invasion fleet, the Armada, in 1588. The great disappointment of her reign, however, was the Virgin Queen’s failure to provide a direct heir. Instead, she left the English throne to the Stuarts, the Scottish dynasty who would provoke two revolutions.\n\nSir Henry Lee of Ditchley (1533-1611)\n\nIt’s not known exactly where Henry Lee was born in Kent, although a clue is provided by the fact that his mother Margaret was one of the Wyatts of Allington Castle, and his uncle the poet Sir Thomas. A strapping individual, he became a noted jouster, and in 1570 attained the rank of Queen’s Champion. During his 20-year tenure, he was responsible for organising Elizabeth I’s spectacular Accession Day tilts every year at Westminster, and featured in splendid decorative armour in the ‘Jacob Album’ collection of suits produced by the Royal Almain Armoury, of which he was appointed Master for life in 1580. His retirement as Queen’s Champion was fulsomely celebrated in verse and song. Despite being knighted in 1597, he boldly declined to host Her Majesty at his home at Ditchley, Oxfordshire for a second time because of the cost. He represented Buckinghamshire at four parliaments, and founded Aylesbury Grammar School.\n\nReginald Scott (ca 1538-99)\n\nOn the face of it, the Oxonian MP for New Romney, Reynolde Scot, was a country gentlemen who prospered by inheriting properties in Smeeth (his home village), Brabourne, and Aldington. More importantly, he wrote two books of lasting social value. One was an illustrated manual on hop cultivation, ’A Perfite Platforme of a Hoppe Garden’ (1574), the first in English. The other was ‘The discoverie of witchcraft’ (1584) which, contrary to what one might expect, condemned belief in witchcraft as a tool of oppression. He even demonstrated diagrammatically how ‘miracles’ were performed, making the book arguably the first manual of magic. His motives were largely religious, since he blamed Roman Catholicism for sustaining the belief that witches actually existed. This won support in the Tudor era, when Henry VIII and Elizabeth I liberalised witchcraft laws; but not under the Stuarts, after the zealous witch-hunter James I damned the late Scott and ordered his books burnt by the hangman.\n\nEdward Dering (ca 1540-76)\n\nThe third son of John Dering of Surrenden Dering, Pluckley, Edward provided a splendid example of the human capacity for frittering away one’s existence in pursuit of zealous causes. After studying at Cambridge, he kept his nose clean until in 1568 Archbishop Matthew Parker made him rector of Pluckley. Two years later, however, he excoriated the English clergy in front of Elizabeth I, holding her personally responsible for the current state of affairs – and this despite having dutifully presented her with a book of Greek verse six years earlier. It earned him a suspension. That same year, theologian Thomas Cartwright was expelled from Cambridge for championing Presbyterianism, a fundamentally Scottish doctrine embracing Church rule by assemblies of elders. Dering defended him vehemently, accusing English ministers of egregious ignorance. Though he talked his way out of a suspension of his lectureship at St Paul’s Cathedral, his erstwhile friend Parker blocked his further advancement, and he died young of tuberculosis.\n\nDr Robert Hovenden (1544-1614)\n\nAlthough he was born in Canterbury and became both chaplain to Archbishop Matthew Parker and a prebend at Canterbury Cathedral, it was in Oxford that Hovenden made his name. After being elected a fellow of All Souls College in 1565, he graduated the following year, and became warden in 1571 – a post he retained for 43 years until his death. He evidently managed it adeptly, mapping its estates, expanding its buildings, and putting its archives in order. He took a business-like stance, seeking always to maximise yields, and even standing up to Elizabeth I when asked to lease land unprofitably. He was briefly vice-chancellor of the University in 1582-3. Having left behind a short biography of the vindictive Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Chichele, he was buried in the College chapel, and commemorated with a monument that included a bust. His brother George, another prebend of Canterbury Cathedral, was rector of Harrietsham, whose living was under All Souls’ jurisdiction.\n\nThomas Digges (ca 1546-95)\n\nDigges was born in Wootton, near Dover, the mathematician son of a mathematician. Having studied the supernova observed by Tycho Brahe in 1572, he concluded that it was so far away as to contradict Aristotle’s cosmic model. He was among the first in Britain to pick up on Copernicus’s theory that the universe revolved not around the Earth but the Sun, and to publicise it. More than that, however, he challenged the Prusso-Pole’s belief that the stars were mounted on spheres that restricted their range. Instead, he proposed that stars extended to an extreme distance and in unlimited numbers, accurately anticipating modern cosmology. He even went so far as to query why, if there is an unlimited number of stars, the night sky is not uniformly filled with starlight. He thus first stated the ‘Dark Night Sky Paradox’ that would not be resolved until the C20. Copernicus is now celebrated, whereas Digges is forgotten.\n\nEdward Wotton, 1st Baron Wotton (1548-1626)\n\nWotton was the grandson of a Lord Mayor of London, and half-brother to poet Henry Wotton. Although not known to have studied in England, he spent years abroad acquiring considerable learning and several languages, making him an asset to Francis Walsingham in the dark arts of diplomacy; he was sent on numerous delicate missions overseas and in Scotland. In 1602, he became Comptroller of the Household, and having inherited Boughton Place from his father in 1587 was endorsed by the new king James I with the title Baron Wotton of Marley, Co. Kent. He became successively Sheriff and Lord Lieutenant of Kent, though he was denied ennoblement by his Catholicism. His cosmopolitan outlook brought him interesting literary connections: he befriended Sir Philip Sidney, who in ‘The Defence of Poesy’ mentioned learning to ride with him in Vienna, and escorted Isaac Casaubon to England in 1610. His widow Margaret boldly affirmed his Catholicism on their tomb in Boughton Malherbe church.\n\nThe Very Reverend Thomas Nevile (d 1615)\n\nAfter Richard Neville, a wealthy gentleman from Nottinghamshire, settled at Canterbury, he had two sons, one of whom was the politician and writer Alexander Neville, and the other Thomas Nevile (sic), who went into the Church. As well as becoming dean of Canterbury in 1597 until his death, having already been dean of Peterborough, he so commended himself to Elizabeth I during his time as master of Merton College, Cambridge and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University that she made him the new master of Trinity College, Cambridge. There he made a lasting difference to the fabric of the college, creating the enormous Great Court spotlighted in ‘Chariots of Fire’. Then, at his own expense, he had another court built, still known as Nevile’s Court. He was buried at Canterbury Cathedral in the former Brenchley Chantry Chapel, which he had appropriated in 1598, and is commemorated by an effigy of himself and his brother kneeling at prayer.\n\nJohn Lyly (ca 1553-1606)\n\nWriter John Lyly was most likely born in Kent: his younger brothers were recorded as contemporaries of Christopher Marlowe at the Kings School, Canterbury, and his father – who was registrar at the Cathedral – had previously worked as a notary in Rochester. This prompts the intriguing thought that, of the four dramatists cited by Ben Jonson as the greatest of that golden era – Shakespeare, Kyd, Marlowe, and Lyly – two hailed from Canterbury. Yet, though now best remembered for his plays, Lyly was celebrated in his lifetime for two romances, ‘Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit’ and ‘Euphues and His England’ (1578/80). Their delicate, elegant style inserted a new word into English dictionary, ‘euphuism’ – a style that was much admired, and widely imitated. Lyly is also generally credited with coining the maxim ‘All is fair in love and war’. Though he lived for most of his life (and died) in London, Lyly additionally served as MP for three far-flung constituencies.\n\nSir Philip Sidney (1554-86)\n\nFew have packed so much into a short life as Philip Sidney. Born into a prominent family at Penshurst Place, he was already an MP at 18. After three years travelling through Europe, he met Penelope Devereux, the Earl of Essex’s sister, who later inspired him to write 108 love sonnets; she however wed unhappily elsewhere. Instead he married Sir Francis Walsingham’s daughter Frances in 1583. He was also knighted that year, and became MP for Kent a year later. A militant Protestant, he befriended Italian radical Giordano Bruno. Posted to the Netherlands, he actively supported Dutch resistance to the Spanish army of occupation. At the Battle of Zutphen, Sidney was shot in the leg, and died weeks later of gangrene; his insistence on giving his water to another wounded man would prompt a classic thought experiment in evolutionary biology. His writings – which included literary criticism and a romance – were only published posthumously, but assured his lasting fame.\n\nSir Thomas Smythe (ca 1558-1625)\n\nThomas Smythe’s grandfather was Sir Andrew Judde, a merchant and Mayor of London, and his father Thomas ‘Customer’ Smythe, the Port of London customs official who owned Westenhanger Castle. After attending Merchant Taylor’s School, Smythe became prominent in both commerce and politics. As Sheriff of London, he was accused in 1600 of supporting Essex’s rebellion against Elizabeth I and imprisoned in the Tower, but was freed when she died, and even knighted by James I. Having served as the first governor of the East India Company for four months in 1600, he resumed the role for 18 years. In 1604, he travelled from Gravesend to Archangel, Russia to do business with Tsar Boris Godunov. He became treasurer to the tobacco-producing Virginia colony (1609-20), to which Sir Walter Raleigh had granted him settlement rights. He even sponsored efforts to find the Northwest Passage; William Baffin named Smith Sound off Greenland after him. A huge monument celebrates him in Sutton-at-Hone church.\n\nWilliam Adams (1564-1620)\n\nWilliam Adams of Gillingham has the distinction of becoming the first western samurai. In 1600, he was hired as chief pilot of a five-vessel Dutch trading fleet heading for South America’s west coast. After the fleet was scattered by storms, one ship turned back, another was captured, and two remaining captains were killed by natives. Desperate, the remaining crews opted to cross the Pacific. One made for Indonesia, where all were slaughtered, and the other two for Japan. After desertions and a shipwreck, only nine men survived the voyage to Usuki, where the ship with its cannons and cargo was seized by the authorities. Luckily, the future Shogun took to Adams, whose talents he employed to enhance the Japanese navy and develop trading links. Adams was eventually declared reborn as a samurai. Named Miura Anjin, he began a new life as an influential official, remarrying but continuing to provide for his wife back home. He never came back.\n\nChristopher Marlowe (1564-93)\n\nKit Marlowe, son of a Canterbury shoemaker, was such a precocious literary talent that it is no wonder he has been credited with secretly writing the early works of his exact contemporary, Shakespeare. After attending The King’s School and Cambridge, he began working for the government in some secret capacity, possibly spying for Sir Francis Walsingham. Meanwhile, he also turned his hand to drama, writing the innovative and hugely popular tragedies ‘Tamburlaine the Great’, ‘The Jew of Malta’, and ‘Doctor Faustus’. Both careers came to a sudden halt in Deptford on May 30th, 1593. After a day’s drinking with three dubious Walsingham agents, he got into a fight with one, Ingram Frizer, who mortally stabbed him in the head. Frizer was acquitted, but the coroner’s report still seems fishy, especially as Marlowe faced politically inspired criminal charges at the time. While his dramatic torch passed to Shakespeare thereafter, Marlowe’s murky death still provides rich material for conspiracy theorists.\n\nRichard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork (1566-1643)\n\nRichard Boyle was born at Canterbury into landed gentry from Hertfordshire who had settled near Faversham. A contemporary of Christopher Marlowe, he attended The King’s School and Cambridge before studying law and working for Sir Roger Manwood. At 21, however, he decided to seek his fortune elsewhere, and departed for Ireland with a stash of money and jewellery. A good marriage brought him a handsome income, and he applied his negotiating skills to buying property, most notably Sir Walter Raleigh‘s estates that included Lismore Castle in County Waterford. He was never without enemies in high places, however, whether because he was corrupt, or they just resented this upstart. Irish Catholic rebels were also an ongoing problem, and drove him off his land in both 1598 and 1641. His youngest son Robert, born when Lord Cork was past 60, would immortalise the family name with Boyle’s Law and become Ireland’s most famous scientist.\n\nFrances Burke, Countess of Clanricarde (1567-1633)\n\nFrances Walsingham was the daughter of the famous spymaster, with whom she witnessed at first hand the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572 and had to be smuggled out of France. She became an only child when her sister died at seven, her two half-brothers having already been killed in an accidental explosion. At 16, she married the poet Sir Philip Sidney, to the annoyance of the Queen, who feared a power nexus between these two powerful Kentish families; he was nursed by Frances after being fatally wounded in battle. She embarked next on an even riskier marriage to the 2nd Earl of Essex, the Queen’s favourite later executed for plotting a rebellion; their son the 3rd Earl would become the Roundheads’ Chief Commander. Frances’s final marriage was altogether more sedate. With Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde, she built Portumna Castle in Ireland and Somerhill House near Tudeley, where she died. She is buried at Tonbridge church.\n\nSir Henry Wotton (1568-1639)\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant of Kent’s half-brother, Henry Wotton was born at Boughton Place in Boughton Malherbe. At Oxford, he befriended John Donne, some of whose poetic ability he shared; but it was as a diplomatist that he played a small but fateful role in English history. Charged by the Earl of Essex with gathering information on various European states, he nearly came a cropper when his boss led a failed coup against Elizabeth I and was executed; Wotton fled abroad. While in Florence, he learned of a plot to kill the Catholic heir to the English throne, James VI of Scotland, and travelled incognito to warn him, taking antidotes to poisons. After succeeding Elizabeth, the grateful monarch rewarded him with a knighthood. Wotton blotted his copybook by famously defining a diplomat as “an honest man sent to lie abroad for the state’s benefit”, but survived to become MP for Sandwich and spend time fishing with Izaac Walton, no less.\n\nSir Richard Baker (ca 1568-1645)\n\nDescended from at least four substantial old Kent families, Baker was born at Sissinghurst, the grandson of the original Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Baker. He failed to complete his degree at Oxford, and studied in London before going on his travels and being elected an MP. His unremarkable life changed in 1635 when, having underwritten his in-laws’ debts, he found himself bankrupt, and spent his last nine years in Fleet gaol. He filled his time by writing eruditely. To begin with, his thoughts were on the everlasting, and he penned several tracts on religious themes, interspersed with some secular works. His signature piece however was his ‘Chronicle of the Kings of England from the Time of the Romans’ Government unto the Death of King James’ (1643) which, despite its great popularity, was sadly no more accurate than one might expect from a man without access to a good library.\n\nCaptain Phineas Pett (1570-1647)\n\nThe so-called Pett Dynasty of North-West Kent – whose timber plantation lent its name to the town of Petts Wood – was of unique importance in English shipbuilding for two centuries. One of its foremost scions, Phineas, was born in Deptford and attended schools in Rochester and Greenwich before going to Cambridge. He was left penniless when his father, shipwright Peter Pett, died in 1589, but quickly established himself as a shipbuilder at Chatham. By making a well-received miniature ship for the ill-fated Prince Henry in 1604, he won King James I’s favour, and an income to boot. His achievements included organising Princess Elizabeth’s nautically themed wedding celebration in 1613, being elected Master of the Corporation of Shipwrights in 1616, and building HMS Vanguard at Woolwich before becoming the first Resident Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard (both 1631). He designed the mighty Sovereign of the Seas built by his son Peter. His memoir of his career was published in 1918.\n\nThe Very Reverend John Boys (1571-1625)\n\nHaving been born at Eythorne, John Boys most likely attended The King’s School, Canterbury, since he went to Corpus Christi, Cambridge, which at Archbishop Matthew Parker’s behest offered scholarships to alumni of that school. Ever in need of a steady income, he ingratiated himself sufficiently with Church elders that he was given a succession of livings, including Betteshanger, Tilmanstone, and Hollingbourne, and made master of Eastbridge Hospital in Canterbury. For the last six years of his life, he was dean of Canterbury Cathedral, in which capacity he delivered a sermon, which still exists, on the occasion of the future queen Henrietta Maria’s arrival in England in 1625. Most notably, he became a respected author of ecclesiastical works, starting with ‘The Minister’s Invitatorie’ (1609), an invaluable account of the main scriptures of the Anglican liturgy; comparable lists of epistles and gospels followed by 1614, and psalms in 1616. His scholarship was commemorated with an evocative monument in the Cathedral.\n\nSir John Finet (1571-1641)\n\nWhen Cardinal Campeggio came to Kent in 1519, he brought with him John Finet of Siena, who decided to remain and marry an Englishwoman. Finet’s great-grandson, John Finet from Solton Manor near Dover, was a courtier who travelled to France, Spain, and Italy, where he was painted by Tintoretto. He had a particular gift for entertaining eminent personages. He wrote pieces for the court of James I that were said to be highly amusing, in spite or perhaps because of being very crude. He blotted his copybook in 1618, however, when he performed a piece alongside several other courtiers that proved rather too risqué, and the King, who was suffering from gout, was not amused. Nevertheless Finet, who had already been knighted in 1616, was promoted to Master of Ceremonies in 1626. In addition to ‘Finetti Philoxenis’, a guide to dealing with foreign ambassadors, he left behind a number of recipes.\n\nDr Robert Fludd (1574-1637)\n\nAt the very time when Galileo Galilei from Pisa was showing the world how science ought to work, Robert Fludd from Bearsted was doing the opposite. He was born at Milgate House, which was probably built by his father Sir Thomas, Queen Elizabeth I’s war treasurer. After studying Medicine at Oxford, he championed the theories of the Swiss physician Paracelsus, rooted in an occult belief in the harmony of microcosm and macrocosm; he also became known as an apologist for the esoteric Rosicrucian movement that swept Christendom in the early C17. Though his explanations for phenomena from blood to cosmology rested on mystical speculation rather than evidence, he was taken sufficiently seriously that his arguments had to be rebutted by such scientific giants as Kepler and Gassendi. His arcane beliefs seemed to have been buried with him at Bearsted church; but the antiscientific consensus now sweeping the West may feel he is due a comeback.\n\nSir Robert Heath (1575-1649)\n\nBorn in Edenbridge, Robert Heath attended Tonbridge School and Cambridge, and went into law. He was known as a quick-witted rather than insightful lawyer and, possibly because of the unpopular politics and personages he had to defend, earned an ambivalent reputation. Yet there was no doubting his success. As well as serving as MP for London, he became Attorney General in 1625, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1631, and, in 1642, Lord Chief Justice. He was loyal to Charles I up until the crucial Civil War year of 1646, after which he went into exile in France, and died there. He is perhaps best remembered as the man who effectively created the Carolinas in America. He secured a patent (i.e. land grant) in 1629 on a vast tract of land named in Charles’s honour; but, when his plan to settle it with French Huguenots was blocked, he assigned it, much to his heirs’ later frustration.\n\nSir William Harvey (1578-1657)\n\nWilliam Harvey was born into a wealthy family in Folkestone, where his father later became mayor. After leaving The King’s School, Canterbury, he went to Cambridge, where he gained his doctorate in medicine after a spell at the University of Padua. He took a career-long post at St Bartholomew’s, living in Ludgate. As well as lecturing, he won a plum job as personal physician to King James I in 1618. Another client was Sir Francis Bacon, deviser of the scientific method. Though Harvey disliked Bacon’s style, he published in 1628 a work that accorded well with Bacon’s eminently practical method: ‘De Motu Cordis’, his comprehensive account of the circulation of blood. In overturning Galen’s ancient theory, it naturally ruffled feathers, and was not accepted for decades. Nevertheless, it proved a turning-point in medical science, and Harvey is now honoured as a forerunner of the scientific revolution. He died in his seventieth year of, ironically, a cerebral haemorrhage.\n\nSir Heneage Finch (1580-1631)\n\nOne of the Finches of Eastwell Manor, Heneage Finch was born at The Moat in Canterbury. The son of Sir Moyle Finch, an MP and twice Sheriff of Kent, he owed his unusual first name to his mother Elizabeth, née Heneage, who was Viscountess Maidstone before being created Countess of Winchilsea. He went into law after studying at Cambridge, and became MP for Rye in 1610. After serving one term, he went into service with Prince Charles, whereupon the Duchy found him a seat in Cornwall. His legal career flourished in his forties. He was made Recorder of London in 1621, elected MP for the City of London in 1624, and selected as Speaker of the House in 1626. His eldest son, also called Heneage, became Lord Chancellor and was a key figure during the Popish Plot. A monument to Finch by Nicholas Stone, incorporating a bust, can be viewed in the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nSir Dudley Digges (1583-1639)\n\nTo modern ears, Dudley Digges sounds a good egg at a time of many rotten ones. He was probably born at Digges Court, Barham, the son of mathematician Thomas Digges. Noted for supporting voyages of discovery, he helped fund Henry Hudson in 1610, who named the Digges Islands and Digges Cape at the entrance to Hudson Bay after him, and William Baffin in 1615-6. His interest in overseas development led to his son, Edward, settling in Virginia and becoming governor. As MP for Kent, he led efforts to impeach James I’s corrupt toy-boy the Duke of Buckingham after a farcical raid on Cadiz in 1626. He wrote ‘The Compleat Diplomat’ (published 1655), a valuable account of efforts to find a spouse for Queen Elizabeth I, and built Chilham Castle as we now know it around 1616. With an eye to public health, he even left money to fund 200 years of annual races for Chilham villagers.\n\nSir Anthony Weldon (1583-1648)\n\nWeldon is attributed with the famous description of James I as “the wisest fool in Christendom” that appears in ‘The Court and Character of King James I’ (1650). It tallies with the unflattering sentiments expressed in another work attributed to him, ‘Perfect Description of the People and Country of Scotland’, although doubt has been cast on whether he actually wrote either work. He did indeed serve in James’s court, where both his father and uncle had held positions; and, despite being knighted in 1617, he may well have left under a cloud, because he became a committed Parliamentarian as civil war approached. Nevertheless, as chairman of the Kent County Committee, he stridently defended Kent’s interests against grasping London officials. When the Kentish revolt of 1648 threatened a Royalist backlash, Weldon confined himself to his manor, fearing the worst, but survived just long enough to be handsomely rewarded by Parliament for his loyalty. He was buried at his hometown, Swanscombe.\n\nJohn Finch, 1st Baron Finch of Fordwich (1584-1660)\n\nLike his father, Sir Henry Finch of Eastwell Manor, John Finch was repeatedly elected MP for Canterbury. At a turbulent time in English politics, he earned a reputation as a Royalist hardliner, especially when he was knighted in 1625 two days after welcoming Charles I to Canterbury for his first meeting with Henrietta Maria. He was Speaker of the Commons in 1628-9, and as Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas won few friends in Parliament with his tough line on political dissent. Though Charles made him Baron Finch of Fordwich and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in 1640, the Long Parliament that first sat that year immediately impeached him and confiscated his estates. After exile in Holland, he returned at some point to England, probably at the time of the Restoration. In 1660, he participated in the trials of the regicides, revolutionaries who no doubt relished his swift demise. He was buried at St Martin’s, Canterbury.\n\nLady Mary Wroth (1587-ca 1652)\n\nMary Sidney has enjoyed a recent resurgence of interest in feminist circles as the author of what is thought to be the first English romance by a woman. The niece of the great poet Sir Philip Sidney, she lived, and was probably born, at Penshurst Place. She was unhappily married to the dissolute and jealous Sir Robert Wroth of Loughton Hall, Essex, after whose death she had two illegitimate children by her cousin William Herbert, the 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Practically penniless, in 1621 she released a manuscript of ‘The Countess of Montgomery’s Urania’, the extremely long and elaborate tale of Pamphilia and Amphilanthus, thinly veiled idealisations of herself and Herbert. Indeed, this roman à clef seems to have been an appeal for acceptance by her aunt, the Countess of Pembroke, in the guise of the Queen of Naples. The book scandalised some depicted libellously in it, and was speedily withdrawn. Thereafter, Lady Wroth largely disappeared from public view.\n\nSir Francis Nethersole (1587-1659)\n\nFrancis Nethersole from Wingham had been working happily as a tutor at Cambridge for several years when he was asked in 1619 to accompany Viscount Doncaster on a diplomatic mission to the Palatinate, where James I‘s Protestant son-in-law was Elector. Their mission, to help secure peace with the Elector’s hostile Catholic neighbours, ultimately failed, but it initiated a long association between Nethersole and the Electress Elizabeth, James’s daughter. After returning to England and being knighted, he played a significant role in relations with the Elector, who subsequently won and lost the crown of Bohemia. Nethersole became an MP, in which capacity he opposed Charles I’s ambition to hold citizens under arrest without due cause; yet he remained loyal, even after being held in the Tower and barred from working further for Elizabeth. He became a vicar and, though he took no part in the Civil War, continued publishing pamphlets sympathetic to the Royalist cause. He died shortly before the Restoration.\n\nSir Robert Filmer (1588-1653)\n\nMany generations of the Kentish Filmers lie buried in East Sutton church; Robert was the one who lived through the accession of the Stuart monarchy and England’s descent into Civil War. Filmer studied law, and was knighted by King James I in 1619. As from the 1620s, he worked on his one book of note, ‘Patriarcha’. This was an intellectual justification of the Divine Right of Kings, the basis of his argument being the God-given right of a man to rule his family, as testified by the Old Testament. This ‘right’ was vigorously asserted by the headstrong new king in 1625, Charles I. The Long Parliament’s uncompromising response to Kentish efforts to conciliate between King and Commons was to spark civil war in 1642. The Roundheads soon looted Filmer’s manor house, taxed him heavily, imprisoned him in Leeds Castle, and took his estates. He survived, however, because luckily for him ‘Patriarcha’ wasn’t published till 1680.\n\nSir Henry Vane the Elder (1589-1655)\n\nHenry Vane was an Oxford-educated courtier from Hadlow who featured prominently in events leading to the Civil War. Despite serving Charles I loyally, he had a rebellious spirit, being a great-grandson of Thomas Wyatt the Younger. He made an enemy of the Earl of Strafford, a prominent Royalist, who in 1640 adopted the title Baron Raby: a studied insult, since Vane owned Castle Raby in County Durham. When Parliamentarians attempted to impeach Strafford soon afterwards, Vane, as Privy Council secretary, testified that Strafford had proposed deploying Irish troops against “this kingdom”, without saying whether this meant Scotland or England. His son Henry poured oil on the flames by producing a copy of his father’s notes, occasioning a public rift between father and son that was possibly feigned. Though acquitted, Strafford was executed soon afterwards. When Civil War broke out, Vane sided openly with Parliament, and luckily died before the Restoration. He was buried at his home village, Shipbourne.\n\nDr John Wilson (1595-1674)\n\nBorn in Faversham, musician and composer John Wilson moved to London in 1614 and three years later replaced Robert Johnson as the principal composer of the King’s Men, England’s leading troupe of players, from which Shakespeare had recently retired. Though less nuanced than Johnson, he could write a solid tune and was suitably accessible. Alongside Ben Jonson, he became one of a gaggle of entertainers who gathered around Charles I after his accession in 1625, and joined the King’s Musick as a lutenist in 1635. Such was Wilson’s loyalty that, during the Commonwealth that followed the King’s execution, he composed the ‘Psalterium Carolinum’, setting to music Thomas Stanley’s poetic version of Charles’s supposed autobiography ‘Eikon Basilike’ (‘Royal Portrait’). By then, he had become a Doctor of Music at Oxford in 1644, and twelve years later won a professorship there; he composed sacred music, and set classical writings. After the Restoration, he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.\n\nThomas Carew (1595-1640)\n\nA grandson of the Lord Mayor of the City of London, Thomas Carew from West Wickham was handed the opportunity to build a career in diplomacy, but after stays in Venice and The Hague he was fired for slander, and instead became a courtier. Possibly apocryphally, he won Queen Henrietta Maria’s favour when, while accompanying the King, he deliberately stumbled to make his candle gutter just as she was about to be spotted canoodling with Lord St Albans. A friend of both John Donne and Ben Jonson, Carew (pronounced Carey) was considered the first of the ‘Cavalier Poets’, who wrote to impress the King with poetic celebrations of the good things in life. In Carew’s case, this extended as far as a sensuousness that reached its zenith in the controversially erotic ‘A Rapture’. Although a loyal support to the King during his long struggle with Parliament, he died too young to participate in the Civil War.\n\nSir Roger Twysden, 2nd Baronet (1597-1672)\n\nThe great-grandson of the Allington rebel Thomas Wyatt the Younger, Twysden was born at the family home, Roydon Hall in East Peckham. After attending Cambridge and taking up law, he was elected to the Commons in his late twenties, and in 1640 represented Kent as an MP. Although dismayed by Charles I’s imperiousness, he was repelled by Parliament’s antipathy to the Church and the radicalism exemplified by the fate of Lord Strafford. On the grounds of his age, he took no active part in the Civil War, but agitated repeatedly for the King, and was repeatedly jailed and had his estates seized by Parliament. He finally bought his way out of the Tower of London in 1650, and returned to his antiquarian studies. Having already written ‘The Commoners’ Liberty’ in 1648, he published works on English history and the English church in the 1650s. He was buried at East Peckham.\n\nSir William Waller (ca 1597-1668)\n\nThe Civil War initially saw a succession of royalist victories due to the heroics of King Charles‘ nephew Prince Rupert. The prominent exceptions were provided in the West Country by Parliamentarian colonel Sir William Waller, a professional soldier and staunch Presbyterian born at Knole into Kentish gentry. Promoted to major-general, he complained bitterly after suffering a reverse in Oxfordshire in 1644 that his troops, mostly volunteers, wanted only to go home. The following spring, Parliament raised its New Model Army, and the Self-Denying Ordinance obliged both Waller and his ineffectual superior the Earl of Essex to resign their commands, opening the door to Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell. An inveterate critic of the radical Army, Waller was repeatedly jailed under Cromwell’s dictatorship, which spared him the usual reprisals after the Restoration. He bought Osterley Park, where he died; his self-exculpatory memoir was finally published 125 years after his death.\n\nWilliam Somner (1598-1669)\n\nSomner’s father was a court official at Canterbury, where the boy was born, went to school, and eventually died. His father having employed him as a clerk, he enjoyed advancement under the auspices of Archbishop Laud. He remained a Royalist even during the Commonwealth, being jailed in Deal Castle in 1659 for petitioning for a free Parliament. After the Restoration, he was appointed master of St John’s Hospital and auditor of Canterbury Cathedral. In the meantime, he acquired a reputation as a well-connected antiquarian, publishing ‘The Antiquities of Canterbury’ (1640), as well as works on Henry I’s laws (1644) and gavelkind (1647) among others. In 1657, at Archbishop Ussher’s behest, he was awarded a stipend at Cambridge that allowed him, having been urged by Meric Casaubon to study Old English, to complete his magnum opus: the first ever Anglo-Saxon dictionary, entitled ‘Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum’ (1659). He relaxed by indulging his passions for trout fishing and the longbow.\n\nThomas Case (1598-1682)\n\nThe son of the vicar of Boxley, Thomas Case was educated first at Canterbury and finally Christ Church, Oxford. After preaching in Kent, he moved to Norfolk and then the North-West. A Presbyterian, he sided with the Parliamentarians in the 1640s, having been prosecuted for nonconformism while preaching in Norwich and Chester. In London, he became noted as a vigorous preacher with no qualms about assailing High Church practices in his sermons. Nevertheless, after Charles I’s execution, he refused to pledge loyalty to the new regime, and in 1651 was charged with high treason for his association with Christopher Love’s plot to restore the monarchy. He secured a pardon, and at the Restoration was one of the Presbyterians who greeted Charles II on his return from exile. Ever the rebel, however, he refused in 1662 to sign up to the Act of Uniformity, and so died as much out of favour as he had lived.\n\nVice-Admiral Sir John Mennes (1599-1671)\n\nJohn Mennes, born in Sandwich, attended the local grammar school and went to Oxford before going to sea. His career was loyal though uninspiring until he transported Henrietta Maria to safety in the Low Countries in 1641 and was knighted by Charles I as a reward. When the Navy was lost to Parliament during the Civil War, he converted to an artillery general, but went into exile in 1650. After the Restoration, he became Comptroller of the Navy, which he remained for the rest of his life, despite distinguishing himself only by his incompetence. Moves to oust him were resisted by Charles II, who feared that his removal might precipitate an avalanche. Mennes was colourfully lampooned by Samuel Pepys, who nevertheless recognised in him a fine boon companion. Mennes’ conviviality was expressed in anthologies of satirical verse called ‘Musarum Deliciae: Or, The Muses Recreation’ (1656) and ‘Wit Restored’ (1658). Though he married, he left no offspring.\n\nWilliam Claiborne (1600-ca 1677)\n\nAmong the gaggle of Kent gentry who endeavoured under James I to get Virginia up and running as the Garden of America, William Claiborne was arguably the most significant. He came from Crayford, and settled in Virginia at 21. After surviving the Indian Massacre of 1622, he used his skill and influence as a trader and negotiator to garner considerable wealth. He aimed to set up a trading post on Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay, which he named after his home county, but Charles I granted it to Anglo-Irish Catholic Sir George Calvert as part of the land patent for Maryland in 1632. Like other Virginians, Claiborne resented Calvert’s refusal to pledge an oath of allegiance to the Church of England, and came into armed conflict with Calvert’s sons. In the republican spirit of the colony, he sided with Parliament during the Civil War, playing a role in suppressing Royalists. Following the Restoration, he retired from public life.\n\nHerbert Palmer (1601-47)\n\nThere could hardly have been a starker contrast between Palmer’s pitiable physical and his towering status as a theologian. The grandson of Sir Thomas Palmer the Travailer – so called because of his advocacy of foreign travel – Herbert was born at Wingham, and studied at Cambridge. In 1626, he was talent-spotted while preaching at Canterbury Cathedral and asked to speak at St George the Martyr. Despite his gentle nature, his Puritan principles hindered his progress in the Church. His forte, however, was catechesis, the indoctrination that ensured all sang from the same hymn sheet. In 1643, he led the Westminster Assembly’s efforts to create a catechism for the restructured Church of England. Although his outline for a ‘Larger Catechism’ for adults was rejected, he showed a particular talent for designing the child-directed ‘Shorter Catechism’. He was also known for vehemently opposing John Milton’s appeals for divorce to be permissible on the grounds of incompatibility. He died single.\n\nSir Thomas Twisden, 1st Baronet (1602-83)\n\nBorn at East Peckham, the son of Sir William Twysden (sic), 1st Baronet of Roydon, Thomas studied at Cambridge and took up law as a career. He bought Malling Place, Town Malling in 1642, and served as Recorder of Maidstone. He was elected the county town’s MP in 1645, but was one of the MPs deemed hostile to the New Model Army and ejected by Pride’s Purge in 1648. He was able to purchase Bradbourne House, East Malling in 1656, however, and was restored as Maidstone MP after the Restoration. He avenged himself by officiating at the trials not only of the regicides but also of the Quaker John Bunyan, who progressed to Bedford County Gaol in 1661, and Sir Henry Vane the Younger, who was executed for treason in 1662. Despite his appetite for counter-revolutionary justice, Twisden was nevertheless considered relatively restrained by the standards of the day. He was created Baronet Twisden of Bradbourne, Kent in 1666.\n\nMildmay Fane, 2nd Earl of Westmorland (1602-66)\n\nA son of Sir Francis Fane, MP for Maidstone and for Kent, Mildmay Fane from Mereworth got his first name from his mother Mary’s maiden name. He too went to Cambridge before entering politics and becoming MP for Kent; but, a Royalist, he fell foul of the Civil War. After being jailed in the Tower, he went to stay at the family’s other estate in Northamptonshire. There he was able to indulge his true love, literature. He published a collection of 137 poems called ‘Otia Sacra’ in 1648, but around 500 written throughout his adult life were collected and published in 2001, out of nearly a thousand in English and Latin attributed to him. On top of that, he wrote eight plays and masques, staging most at his estate and even designing sets and writing music. Ever keen on a ‘message’, he made one the personification of a revolt by the five senses against the mind.\n\nSir George Ent (1604-89)\n\nGeorge Ent got his unusual surname from his Protestant father Josias Ente, who was Flemish by birth but fled to Sandwich to escape religious persecution. Young Ent attended schools in Flanders before going to Cambridge and then Padua, where he qualified as a doctor. At 34, he was elected a fellow of Thomas Linacre’s Royal College of Physicians, whose president he became in 1670. He earned his reputation as an anatomist, particularly in his support of his friend and fellow Man of Kent Sir William Harvey, whose world-changing ‘De Motu Cordis’ (1628) he defended in the same way that Thomas Huxley later served as Darwin’s ‘bulldog’. His ‘Apologia pro Circulatione Sanguinis’ (1641) was his most renowned work, although he also published others, usually debunking pseudoscience. Ent became an original fellow of the Royal Society in 1663; and, after King Charles II attended a lecture he gave at the RCP two years later, he was knighted.\n\nSir John Boys (1607-64)\n\nA Civil War lieutenant colonel, John Boys was appointed governor of Donnington Castle in Berkshire, the Royalist stronghold commanding the London-Bristol road and the southern approach to the King’s headquarters, Oxford. The Parliamentarians first tried to take it without cannon in July 1644, and lost 300 men. Two more Roundhead commanders tried pounding the walls over the next month or two, but they too were repulsed, and Boys was knighted. Within a month, the normally dependable Parliamentarian general Sir William Waller tried his hand in vain, as did his commander the Earl of Essex immediately afterwards. The following year, Oliver Cromwell himself came to lay siege for four months, but even he could only force a truce under which the defenders were granted safe passage. Boys became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and, after being imprisoned in Dover Castle for pestering Parliament, was appointed Dover’s Receiver of Customs after the Restoration. He is buried at his birthplace, Goodnestone.\n\nJohn Tradescant the Younger (1608-62)\n\nJohn Tradescant the Elder was a naturalist who travelled extensively overseas gathering botanical samples and ethnographic objects. These he stored at his 3-acre estate in South Lambeth Road in a collection called ‘The Ark’, which developed into England’s first museum. He married Elizabeth Day at Meopham, where their son John was born. After attending The King’s School, Canterbury, where a house is now named after him, John the Younger expanded his father’s collection with his own samples gathered in North America. In doing so, he introduced some now standard species to England, including the magnolia and the tulip tree. He returned to become head gardener at the Queen’s House in Greenwich, executing Inigo Jones’s designs for Charles I’s Queen Henrietta Maria. Unfortunately, his neighbour in Lambeth was the unscrupulous Isaac Ashmole, who swindled the Tradescant collection out of him and gifted it to Oxford University, so providing the basis for the world-famous Ashmolean Museum.\n\nKatherine Wotton, Countess of Chesterfield (1609-67)\n\nBack in the days when Boughton Place in Boughton Malherbe was so grand that it was sometimes called Bocton Palace, Katherine Wotton was born there, the daughter of Thomas, the 2nd Baron Wotton. She was courted by Van Dyck, who painted her, but turned him down because he charged too much. Instead, she married Henry, Lord Stanhope, who died in 1634, and then the Dutch diplomat Johannes Polander, Lord van Kerckhoven, who lasted until 1660. She was much in demand as a lady in waiting, being the confidante respectively of Mary the Princess Royal, Anne Hyde the wife of the future James II, and Queen Catherine. Loyal to the Stuarts throughout the Civil War, she was rewarded after the Restoration with the title of Countess. Her third and final husband was Daniel O’Neill, whose roles included Postmaster General. When he died in 1664, she inherited the title from him – the first woman to hold it.\n\nPeter Pett (1610-ca 1670)\n\nAnother of the famous Kentish shipbuilding family, Deptford-born Peter Pett, fifth son of Phineas, was at first a seamless sequel to his father. After Phineas designed the mighty Sovereign of the Seas in 1635, Peter built her at Woolwich under his father’s supervision. In 1648 he succeeded Phineas as Second Resident Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard, where he proved a fervent nepotist. He shrewdly sided with the Parliamentarians during the Civil Wars, so retaining his posts, and even became MP for Rochester in 1659; but he adroitly prepared the fleet for Charles II’s return to England in 1660, thus regaining royal favour. In 1667, however, he became the focus of a national controversy when he was made a scapegoat for the catastrophic damage sustained during the Dutch Raid on the Medway, and even imprisoned briefly in the Tower. It prompted Andrew Marvell to write a poetic satire of the establishment’s hypocrisy in blaming its own failings on Pett.\n\nSir Henry Vane the Younger (1613-62)\n\nHenry Vane was born in Hadlow and educated at Westminster School and Oxford. He started out as a diplomat but, seeking freedom of worship, left for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635. He was soon elected governor, and secured the foundation of Harvard University. Nevertheless, his brief tenure was perturbed by Amerindian insurgency and religious bigotry, and he returned to England in 1637. Though knighted in 1640, he could not stomach Charles I’s authoritarianism, and in the Long Parliament became effectively the civilian governmental head during the Civil War. Nevertheless, he refused to condone the King’s execution, and split with Cromwell in 1653. He might have expected clemency at the time of the Restoration, but was deliberately excluded from the Indemnity & Oblivion Act. Though Charles II formally reprieved him, a Royalist court pursued him literally to the death. He was beheaded on Tower Hill and buried at Fairlawne in Shipbourne, which his father had settled on him.\n\nSir Thomas Peyton, 2nd Baronet (1613-84)\n\nOnly nine when he inherited his father Sir Samuel Peyton‘s estate, including his title and the traditional family seat Knowlton Court, Goodnestone, Peyton looked set for a comfortable life when, having married well, he became MP for Sandwich in 1640. These were dangerous times, however, and as a Royalist he was ejected from Parliament in 1644. He joined a group of radicals intent on overthrowing the revolutionary regime, and so was imprisoned in the Tower. Cromwell showed he had a compassionate side, however, when in 1655 he ordered that Peyton be allowed to spend 36 days at the Tunbridge Wells spa, presumably to recover his health. After the Restoration, Peyton was elected MP for Kent in the so-called Cavalier Parliament; but, despite being handed remunerative positions, he died deeply in debt. Consequently, his daughters were obliged to sell the estate to Admiral Sir John Narborough. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nJohn Lilburne (ca 1614-57)\n\nThe Civil War was the last time England was divided fiercely down arbitrary lines, republican sentiment was rife, radical beliefs became mainstream, and moral principle justified mass expropriation. One protagonist was John Lilburne, born (probably) in Greenwich of minor gentry from County Durham. He became prominent as a pamphleteer publicising the most extreme beliefs of the Levellers movement, whose aim was to press the same status on everyman. He invented the concept of ‘freeborn rights’ – privileges enjoyed by all by dint of being alive. The idea was unacceptable even to fellow anti-monarchists, but proved useful to American revolutionaries, and has now been recycled around the world. Though he fought in the Parliamentary army and remained highly popular with Londoners, Lilburne’s militancy won him few friends in authority. He was flogged, exiled, and repeatedly jailed, finally in Dover Castle. There he was converted to Quakerism. ‘Freeborn John’ spread the word around Kent, but died while visiting his wife at Eltham.\n\nJohn Wallis (1616-1703)\n\nA reverend’s son who himself became a reverend, John Wallis was born in Ashford, but after a plague outbreak attended grammar school in Tenterden. He studied at Cambridge, but from 1649 became a geometry professor at Oxford until his death. A mathematical genius, he made contributions in several other fields, including infinitesimal calculus and trigonometry. His most significant work, ‘Arithmetica Infinitorum’ (1656), introduced the Wallis Product, a new expression of π. He introduced the infinity symbol ∞ and multiplication sign x. Although he served Parliament as a cryptographer for 46 years, he supported the Restoration, and was a founder of the Royal Society in 1660. While responding to a Royal Society challenge in 1668, he identified conservation of momentum, and coined the term ‘momentum’. An insomniac, Wallis did mental calculations in bed, and once reeled off the 27-digit root of a 53-digit number over breakfast. An asteroid and an academy are named after him, as was an Ashford pub.\n\nDorothy Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1617-84)\n\nThe daughter of the Earl of Leicester, Dorothy Sidney from Penshurst became famous less for what she wrote, which amounted to her eloquent correspondence, than what was written about her. Known for her aristocratic beauty, she ignited a flame in the poet Edmund Waller, a relative of the Kentish Parliamentarian commanders William and Hardress Waller. Such was his passion that he wrote 16 genteel love-poems for her; he named her ‘Sacharissa’, which might translate today as something like ‘Sugarplum’. She virtuously shunned the lovelorn Waller’s advances, although in truth she had fatter fish to fry. At 21, she married the Earl of Sunderland at Penshurst, so becoming Lady Dorothy Spencer and living at Althorp House in Northamptonshire. Her husband was killed at the First Battle of Newbury in 1643, however, so she returned at length to Penshurst Place. In 1926, Julia Cartwright Ady wrote a biography of her, aptly named ‘Sacharissa’.\n\nFrancis Lovelace (ca 1621-75)\n\nLovelace’s father Sir William owned properties at both Bethersden and Woolwich. Like his four brothers, including the ‘Cavalier poet’ Richard, Francis fought for the King in the Civil War, commanding Carmarthen Castle as a colonel until its capture by Parliament in 1645, when another brother, William, was killed. Following exile in France, he joined his sister Anne in Virginia, but was sent home and jailed in the Tower after Parliamentarians arrived. He returned to America after the Restoration, when the Duke of York appointed him the second governor of New York. He took his responsibilities seriously: he improved defences, formed a militia, paid the native Lenape for Staten Island, and introduced religious freedoms, all while running the ‘Lovelace’ Tavern in Manhattan. When he was away working to establish a postal service, however, the Dutch seized the colony, albeit temporarily. The vindictive Duke held Lovelace responsible, sequestered his assets, and returned him to the Tower. Stricken by dropsy, he died penniless.\n\nSir John Banks, 1st Baronet (1627-99)\n\nBanks, the son of a Maidstone gentleman trader, went to Cambridge before becoming a merchant supplying hops and grain. By the age of 30, well on his way to becoming one of the wealthiest men in England, he had married the Lord Mayor of London’s daughter and bought The Friars at Aylesford; he later added a smart townhouse in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Having briefly served as governor of the East India Company during the costly Third Dutch War, he co-funded efforts to discover a North-East passage with his close friend at the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, who as godfather to Banks’s son Caleb arranged for John Locke, no less, to accompany the boy on a Grand Tour. Banks was made a baronet in 1661, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1668. An MP in 11 parliaments spanning 45 years, he represented Winchelsea, Rochester, and Queenborough, remarkably book-ended by Maidstone in both his twenties and seventies.\n\nSir Paul Rycaut (1629-1700)\n\nAfter reaching the walls of Vienna in 1529, the Ottoman Empire remained a major threat to Europe well into the C17. In 1660, Charles II sent Heneage Finch, the 3rd Earl of Winchelsea of Eastwell Manor, to serve as ambassador in Turkey. His secretary was Paul Rycaut from The Friary, Aylesford, a Cambridge graduate of Huguenot descent, who was later appointed the Levant Company’s consul in Smyrna, and also turned out a fine scholar. In 1665, he published ‘The Present State of the Ottoman Empire’, to which he added an account of the Orthodox Churches of Armenia and Greece (1679). He followed up in 1687 with his monumental ‘The Turkish History’ in two volumes. By that time, the Islamic tide had turned, the Ottomans having been decisively defeated at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, although Ottoman slave-traders continued to plague Europe until the C20. A fellow of the Royal Society, Rycaut retired to Hamburg, but was buried at Aylesford.\n\nJohn Spencer (1630-93)\n\nHaving been born in Boughton-under-Blean, Spencer went to The King’s School, Canterbury and benefited from an Archbishop Parker scholarship at Corpus Christi, Cambridge. In 1667, he became master of the College, which he remained for 26 years until his death. Meanwhile, he proceeded up the ecclesiastical ladder to the post of dean of Ely in 1677, at which cathedral he was eventually buried. In 1663, he had published a book on marvels that Samuel Pepys described as “most ingeniously writ”. He earned notoriety, however, for a controversy over his magnum opus ‘De Legibus Hebraeorum’ (1685), a scholarly work arguing that Mosaic Law was not original but derived from Egyptian tradition. Since this directly contradicted the Bible, he was attacked from all directions, even from abroad. Despite being described as “dangerous” in a C19 index of English literature, the book set an example for further such works of comparative religion. Spencer’s complete works were published in 1717.\n\nMargaret Finch (1632?-1740)\n\nA two-hour ride from London, ‘Beggar’s Hill’ at Norwood, Surrey was for 200 years such a popular rural draw to Roma gypsies that it was renamed Gipsy Hill; Samuel Pepys paid a visit, and John Keats wrote a poem about it. In 1768, the gypsies there elected Margaret Finch from Sutton, Kent their new queen. She exercised matriarchal control over her kinsfolk, while making a living by whatever means presented themselves, which primarily meant fortune-telling. Although exploiting people’s superstitious beliefs may sound reprehensible to the modern ear, it might better be thought of as entertainment. She obviously perfected an impressive act, because she supposedly ended up wealthy. She is said to have died at 108, although this is unverifiable. Described in old age as “grotesque”, she spent so long hunched up with her pipe and her lap-dog in her hut made of branches that muscle contracture locked her bones in place. She was buried at Beckenham in a square coffin.\n\nSir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet (1639-1701)\n\nThe son of Sir John Sedley of The Friars, Aylesford, Charles came to the public’s attention for all the wrong reasons. Having left Oxford without a degree, he joined the licentious Merry Gang in London, and was fined for standing naked on a balcony before a large crowd, pouring a glass of wine, stirring it inappropriately, and drinking the King’s health. Samuel Pepys declared him a “famous fop” and lover of actress Peg Hughes. Two decades later, better known as a playwright, poet, and MP for New Romney, Sedley quipped that, as the King’s successor James II had controversially made his daughter Catherine Sedley a countess after impregnating her, he might reciprocate by making James’s daughter Mary a queen. His wish was fulfilled when the King was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, Mary succeeded him, and Sedley was knighted. Denied a divorce after his wife went mad, Sedley also had two illegitimate sons by his long-term mistress, Ann Ayscough.\n\nSir Streynsham Master (1640-1724)\n\nBorn at Langdon, Dover, Master joined the East India Company early, first running EIC operations in Gujarat before moving on to Andhra Pradesh and Bengal. In 1678, he took over from Sir William Langhorne as the agent of Madras. Like Langhorne, he faced local panjandrums’ demands for tribute which, being liable to progress from diplomatic threat to military shove, underscored the need for the EIC to defend itself. Master nevertheless brought to his work a Christian ethic that would become a hallmark of the Raj. During his time there, St Mary’s church was built, the first in Madras. He was the first to tackle one of several Indian customs that outraged Britons, when he intervened in 1680 to save a local woman from suttee, i.e. being burned alive on her husband’s funeral pyre. He also appointed ‘scavengers’, customs collectors who were responsible for cleaning up the streets. After leaving in 1681, he bought a castle in Derbyshire.\n\nDr Robert Plot (1640-96)\n\nRobert Plot ought to be world famous as the man who published the very first illustration of a dinosaur bone, two centuries before the discovery of Maidstone’s famous ‘iguanadon’. Unfortunately for Plot, the only authority on creation in his day was the Bible; so he misinterpreted the fossil of a megalosaurus’s femur in his ‘Natural History of Oxfordshire’ (1677) as, if not a natural geological formation, then a giant’s thighbone. Not that he was a fool. Born in Borden, he had gone to school in Wye before attending Oxford, where in 1683 he became the first curator and Professor of Chemistry at the Ashmolean Museum, whilst simultaneously serving as Secretary of the Royal Society. He completed a ‘Natural History of Staffordshire’ (1686) before turning to a volume on Middlesex & Kent that was unfinished when he died back in Borden. He is commemorated with a plaque at the local church.\n\nAphra Behn (1640-89)\n\nThe enigmatic Aphra Behn from Canterbury (or maybe Wye) could be famous for her cool name alone. She wasn’t actually that exotic: Aphra was a biblical name, like Keturah or Keziah, and her maiden name was probably Johnson, unless it was Cooper. She acquired the Behn from a Dutchman, who may actually have been German. She supposedly spied for King Charles II but reported only untruths. We do know that, being Catholic, she injudiciously supported the doomed King James II. She responded to her impoverished condition by expressing herself prodigiously in print. She was forgotten until Virginia Woolf praised her for being a female writer, after which Behn was lionised by numerous feminist commentators. Some blamed prudish Victorians for her oblivion, although others think she just wasn’t much cop. Another feminist, Germaine Greer, had the last word, describing her as a palimpsest: a blank sheet onto which later generations project their own prejudices. Either that, or she wasn’t.\n\nMary Carleton (1642-73)\n\nFor centuries after the Norman Conquest, a woman’s best chance of making a fortune, short of inheriting one, was to marry a rich man, survive multiple childbirths, and outlive him, whether he died in battle or of excess. Mary Moders from Canterbury considered it too much trouble, and decided instead on a life of crime. She was first convicted of bigamy at Maidstone after marrying a Dover surgeon while wed to a Canterbury shoemaker. She headed for Cologne, where she beguiled an aristocrat with the promise of marriage, milked him of gifts, and scarpered. Back in London, she was acquitted of posing as a German princess to entrap surgeon John Carleton, which inspired a book and a play about her. A series of frauds followed, usually involving the pretence of being an heiress. Convicted of theft, she was transported to Jamaica, where she became a prostitute. After returning illegally to London, she was arrested, tried, and hanged at Tyburn.\n\nThe Very Reverend Thomas Comber (1645-99)\n\nFor the first four years of his life, Comber from Westerham never knew his father, who had fled to the Low Countries as a refugee from the Civil War. The boy proved an outstanding scholar, who already knew Greek by the age of ten and went on to receive a wide education. He went into the Church, eventually marrying and settling in Yorkshire. In 1672, he published ‘A Companion to the Temple and Closet’, with which he hoped to assuage Protestant nonconformists. It was one of many learned works he wrote with the aim of enlightening the pious and not so pious in that fraught age. Matters became even fraughter in 1688, however, when the Catholic king James II proposed a Catholic archbishop of York over Comber’s head. Luckily for him, the Glorious Revolution came to his rescue. Having published two pamphlets in support of it, he was installed as the dean of Durham in 1691.\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet Sir George Rooke (1650-1709)\n\nGeorge Rooke was born at Lawrence House, Canterbury, the seat of his father Colonel Sir William Rooke. In 1672, when the 3rd Dutch War broke out, he volunteered for the Royal Navy. It was a baptism of fire, as he repeatedly faced the formidable Dutch admiral de Ruyter. He survived, and in 1677, now a captain, brought Prince William of Orange to England. Early in the Nine Years War (1688-97), he became a rear admiral, distinguishing himself by burning 12 French warships at the Battle of La Hogue (1692), for which he was knighted. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14), he captured or destroyed all the Spanish treasure ships and the escorting French fleet at Vigo Bay, and two years later took Gibraltar, where he is now commemorated with a statue. He subsequently became Admiral of the Fleet and MP for Portsmouth before being forced to retire by gout. He died and was buried at Canterbury.\n\nSir George Wheler (1651-1724)\n\nAlthough his mother was from Egerton and his father from Charing, Wheler was born in the Netherlands, where they were living in exile during the Cromwellian Commonwealth. They returned after the Restoration, and Wheler went to school at Wye. After studying at Oxford, he was taken travelling around France, Switzerland, and Italy by his tutor George Hickes. In Venice, he received tuition in antiquities that he put to good use when he went on a tour of classical sites of Greece and the Near East in 1675-6. He brought back artefacts that he donated to Oxford University, as well as botanical specimens, and published an account of his travels called ‘A Journey into Greece’ several years later. In 1677, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, but this was rescinded in 1685, by which time he had become a clergyman. He was made a canon at Durham Cathedral, and died at Durham.\n\nIsaac Beckett (1653-1719)\n\nUntil mezzotint was invented in Germany in 1642, toned areas in illustrations generally had to be rendered with dots or hatching. This new technique involved roughening the engraved surface so that solid areas could be reproduced more faithfully, greatly enhancing the quality. The technique, which came to rival aquatint, became known in France as la manière anglaise, for which Beckett could take much of the credit. Having started as a calico printer in London, he took up mezzotint with Edward Luttrell, who did most of the drawing while Beckett did the finishing. After marrying a rich woman, he set up his own works, and was particularly prolific in the 1680s. He trained John Smith, who became mezzotint’s leading English exponent. Among the Kent-born Beckett’s most distinguished portraiture subjects were Charles II, the future James II, and the Duke of Buckingham. He also adapted self-portraits by Sir Godfrey Kneller and Sir Peter Lely, both of whom championed mezzotint.\n\nWhite Kennett (1660-1728)\n\nWhite Kennett’s unusual name was simply a merge of his parents’ surnames, his father being Basil Kennett, the rector of Dymchurch and vicar of Postling, and his maternal grandfather Thomas White, a wealthy shipbuilder from Dover, where Kennett was himself born. He went to school at Elham and Wye, but failed to complete his education at Westminster School after catching smallpox, and continued privately at Bekesbourne. While studying at Oxford, he took holy orders, eventually reaching the position of Bishop of Peterborough. A strident anti-Papist, he intervened zealously in more than one arcane theological controversy of the day. His greater worth was as an antiquarian. Already as a student he had translated several Latin works into English, among them Erasmus’s ‘In Praise of Folly’, a satire on superstition. Whilst still a vicar in Oxfordshire, he learned Old English and published valuable works on philology, topography, and biography. A street in Aldgate now bears his name.\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington (1663-1733)\n\nTen years after joining the Royal Navy at 15, George Byng from Wrotham was still an undistinguished lieutenant. In 1688, however, it fell to him to convey to Prince William of Orange the news that certain Navy captains were prepared to transfer their allegiance, leading directly to the Glorious Revolution. Byng was immediately promoted to captain, and under Sir George Rooke participated in the battles of Vigo Bay (1702) and Malaga (1704), as well as the capture of Gibraltar (1704). In 1705, he became MP for Plymouth, and after surviving the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 was made a full admiral. His role in suppressing the Jacobite rebellion of 1715 was rewarded with a baronetcy. Three years later, he stunningly destroyed the Spanish fleet at Cape Passaro and became Admiral of the Fleet. His less fortunate fourth son, Admiral John Byng of Wrotham Park, Middlesex, was infamously executed in order, as Voltaire wrily observed, “to encourage the others”.\n\nJosiah Burchett (ca 1665-1746)\n\nA native of Sandwich who was naturally drawn to "
