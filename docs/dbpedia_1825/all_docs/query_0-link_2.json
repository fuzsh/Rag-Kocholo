        "text": "To celebrate royalty style,\n\nFrom London, was just a few mile;\n\nA palace for Kings\n\nWith Christmassy things,\n\nT'was Eltham, but not for somewhile\n\nPECULIAR PLACEs\n\nand other destinations\n\nELTHAM PALACE\n\nOnce a place for Royal Christmases\n\nELTHAM is situated on the high road leading from London to the Crays, and then to Maidstone, at a distance of about two miles south-eastward from Greenwich. The place was anciently called Ealdham (the old home or dwelling-place), and was formerly a market town of considerable importance; the markets, however, were discontinued around the time of James I., shortly after the palace ceased to be used as a royal residence. The earliest mention of a royal residence, is in the continuation of the \"Historia Major\" of Matthew of Paris, (ascribed to William Rishanger), who wrote of it, from the year 1259 down to the close of the reign of Henry III. William Lambarde, in reference to this work, states that, King Henry lll, in 1270, kept a Royall Christmas at Eltham, being accompanied with his Queen and Nobility: and this (he says) was the first warming of the house, after that the Bishop had finished his work. The Bishop that he is referring to, is Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham, who organised, a considerable amount of work on the property at Eltham.\n\n​\n\nIn 1315, Queen Isabella, having taken up her residence at Eltham Palace, there gave birth to a son, who was called, John of Eltham, and afterwards made Earl of Cornwall. Edward II, frequently resided at Eltham, and in 1329 and 1375 Edward III, held his parliament here; and it was at the last mentioned period that a petition was presented by the Commons, requesting the king to make his grandson, ​Richard, Prince of Wales. ln 1347 the Duke of Clarence (Lionel of Antwerp), the king's son, in the absence of his father, kept a public Christmas here.\n\nIn 1364, John, King of France, Edward lll's prisoner by conquest, came as an unwilling guest to England, and was entertained by the king and queen at Eltham. Jean Froissart (one of the leading historians of the late Middle Ages) mentions how, on a Sunday afternoon, King Edward and Queen Philippa waited at the gates of the palace to receive the fallen monarch, and how, \"between that time and supper, in his honour were many grand dances and carols, at which the young Lord de Courcy distinguished himself by singing and dancing.” This entertainment must have appeared strange to the captive prince, who, when asked to join in with the festivities, replied, \" How can I sing in a strange land?\" Captive as he was, he seems to have been able to succeed in obtaining the Princess Royal, as his bride.\n\nEltham Palace was a favourite of Richard ll, and Anne of Bohemia. In 1386, it's recorded (in Holinshed's \"Chronicles\") that \"King Richard ll, holding his Christmasse at Eltham, thither came to him Leo, King of Armenia, whose countrie and realme being in danger to be conquered of the Turks, he was come into these west parts of Christendome for aid and succour at the hands of the Christian princes here. The king honourablie received him, and after he had taken counsell touching his request, he gave him great summes of money and other rich gifts, with a stipend, as some write, of a thousand pounds yearly, to he paid to him during his life.\" Froissart, in 1395 came to England for the purpose of presenting Richard ll, a volume of his writings.\n\nParliament met here to arrange King Richard's second marriage with Isabella of Valois (his six year old bride) she was brought there after her wedding, and from the gates of Eltham Palace she departed in state to her coronation. Henry IV, was frequently at Eltham with his Court, here he was espoused to Joan of Navarre, in the presence of the high priest and the chief officers of state, Antonio Riezi acting as the lady's proxy, and actually having the ring placed upon his finger.\"\n\nIn 1409, Henry lV, kept his Christmas at Eltham with his queen, and in 1412 he kept his last Christmas there. His son and successor, Henry V., also resided there, and kept his Christmas at Eltham in 1414. Even Henry VI, once kept his Christmas festivities at Eltham. It was said, that It would be difficult to find a finer banqueting hall in the whole country than that of Eltham. The date of the erection of the banqueting hall unquestionably corresponds with the time of King Edward IV.\n\nEdward IV, resided at Eltham Palace and on the 9th of November, 1480, his third daughter, Bridget, was born there. She was christened in the chapel in the palace, by the Bishop of Chichester and later, became a nun at Dartford. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, Edward IV, kept his Christmas there in great state in the year 1482-3, on which occasion, it is stated, 'more than two thousand persons were there daily entertained'. Edward IV, is recorded to have laid out large sums on the buildings, and, is supposed to have entirely rebuilt the great hall as it now stands.\n\n​​Henry VII., like his predecessors, generally resided there, and wanted to dine every day in the hall surrounded by his barons. Although Henry VIII, preferred the palace at Greenwich, he sometimes resided at Eltham, and in 1515 he kept his Christmas there. Holinshed recorded the entertainment on that occasion:--\"In the year 1515 the king kept a solemn Christmas at his manor of Eltham, and on the Twelfth Night, in the hall, was made a goodlie castle, wonderouslie set out, and in it certaine ladies and knights, and when the kinge and queene were set, in came other knights, and assailed the castle, where many a good stripe was given, and at last the assailants were beaten away, and then issued knights and ladies out of the castle, which ladies were strangelie disguised, for all their apparel was in braids of gold, fret with moving spangles of silver-gilt set on crimson satin, loose and not fastened; the men's apparell of the same - suite made like Iulis (sic) of Hungary and the ladies' heads and bodies were after the fashion of Amsterdam; and when the dancing was done the banket [banquet] was served in of two hundred dishes.\"\n\n​\n\nTowards the close of the year 1526 the plague raged so fiercely in London that the king and his Court removed to Eltham. Henry VIII, again kept his Christmas there that year, and in 1556 Queen Mary paid a visit to the palace, attended by Cardinal Pole and the Lord Montagu. In the first year of Queen Elizabeth's reign Eltham Palace was for a few days the royal abode; but fearing that the stagnant waters of the moat rendered the palace unhealthy, it was not frequently used by royalty. Sir Christopher Hatton was keeper of Eltham Palace in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and in 1606 James I, was visited at Greenwich by his brother in-law, the King of Denmark. In the surrounding grounds, deer ran free, so the two kings went together to Eltham, where they hunted with \"greate pleasure, and killed three buckes on horsebacke.\" There were three parks attached to this mansion, covering a very extensive tract of ground. The Great Park, the Little, or Middle Park, and Home, or Lee Park, the whole of which were well stocked with deer.\n\nDuring the Civil Wars, Eltham Palace was occupied by the Parliamentary General, Robert, Earl of Essex, who died there in September, 1646. After the death of Charles I. the royal residence was seized by the Parliament. In 1648, the parks having already been partly broken up and the deer destroyed, Nathaniel Rich purchased the house and a great part of the lands attached to it. Evelyn writes in his diary a few years later on April 22, 1656, \"Went to see his Majesty's house at Eltham; both the palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble wood and park destroyed by Rich the rebel.\"\n\nAfter being restored, the manor of Eltham was bestowed by Charles II, onto Sir John Shaw, in recognition of his friendship to him while in exile at Brussels and Antwerp. With the exception of certain portions of land originally in the royal park, it continued in the possession of his descendants. The great hall has for ages gone by the name of \"King John's Barn,\" probably from some confusion between King John and a son of Edward II., who was born there, who, was called \"John of Eltham.\" It was actually used for a barn, for some time.\n\n​In the mid 17th century, the owner, Sir John Shaw, built Eltham Lodge in the Great Park and lived there. For the next 200 years Eltham Palace was used as a farm and the buildings were tenanted. The Palace declined into a picturesque ruin, frequented by artists and sightseers. A campaign to save the Great Hall from demolition resulted in its restoration in 1828 but it was still used as a barn. Later in the 19th century Eltham Palace became a gentleman's residence, and glasshouses and gardens were laid out in the west moat. By the 1930's the Palace site was almost completely surrounded by houses. The Great Hall was repaired by Charles Peers, Chief Inspector of Ancient Monuments, in 1911-14, and more garden areas were planted.\n\n​In 1933 the Courtauld family obtained a lease of the Eltham Palace site from the Crown and initiated repairs to the buildings.\n\nIn 1944 the family surrendered the Crown lease and the site was taken over by the Royal Army Education Corps. The Corps remained until 1992, the grounds being used between 1975 and 1993 as the Royal Parks training facility. The site is now (2001) in the guardianship of English Heritage and is open to the public.\n\n​\n\nReference\n\n​Old and New London: The southern suburbs By Walter Thornbury, Edward Walford 1893\n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Old_and_New_London_The_southern_suburbs/\n\nEltham Palace Greater London Authority\n\n​https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1001410\n\n​South London by Besant, Walter 1836-1901\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/b24852405/\n\nWho's who?\n\nTo follow timeline, read column 1, then 2,3,4\n\nWar of the Roses- White Rose, House of York, red Rose, House of Lancaster\n\nWars of the Roses, (1455–85), in English history, was a series of dynastic civil wars whose violence and civil strife preceded the strong government of the Tudors.

It wasn't Christmas time, but, there was a great celebration. From the time he arrived, until supper, in his honour were many grand dances and carols, at which the young Lord de Courcy distinguished himself by singing and dancing.\n\nThe royal feasts at Christmas were celebrated there in 1384, 1385, and 1386\n\nGreat Hall Eltham Palace\n\nHenry IV. celebrated Christmas there in the years 1405, 1409, and 1412; and in 1414, the succeeding monarch, Henry V. kept that feast at Eltham, at which time an alarm was given by sudden news of a tumultuous assembly of the Lollards in St. Giles's Fields. The feast of Christmas was again celebrated here in 1429 by Henry VI. with great magnificence.\n\nEltham appears to have been the place chosen for the celebration of those court pageantries, and gorgeous festivals of the church\n\nLet us next consider what it means when the king is said to have kept his Christmas at a place. During the festival — for twenty days — he kept open house, nominally. That is to say, all comers received food and drink: his guests, one supposes, were bidden. Every day during the festival the king sat at the feast wearing his crown and his robes of royal state. Richard II., the most prodigal of all princes that ever lived, entertained every day no fewer than ten thousand persons at his palace. What the number was at Christmas no one knows.\n\nSouth London by Besant, Walter 1836-1901\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/b24852405/\n\nIt would be difficult to find a finer banqueting hall in the whole country than that of Eltham\n\nChristmas were kept there by Edward IV. and his court in 1483, when two thousand persons were daily fed at the royal tables. ​\n\n​Henry VII., like his predecessors, generally resided there, and wanted to dine every day in the hall surrounded by his barons.\n\nAlthough Henry VIII, preferred the palace at Greenwich, he sometimes resided at Eltham, and in 1515 he kept his Christmas there. Holinshed recorded the entertainment on that occasion:--\"In the year 1515 the king kept a solemn Christmas at his manor of Eltham, and on the Twelfth Night, in the hall, was made a goodlie castle, wonderouslie set out, ....and when the dancing was done the banket [banquet] was served in of two hundred dishes.\" Old & New London\n\nWilliam I 'The Conqueror'\n\nSome may not know that, on Christmas Day in 1066, after defeating King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings, William I 'The Conqueror' was crowned King at Westminster Abbey.\n\nHistory of Royal Christmases\n\nhttps://www.royal.uk/history-royal-christmases\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Christmas gifts were usually exchanged at New Year or on Twelfth Night. In 1392 the citizens of the City of London gave Richard II a one-humped camel and a pelican.\n\nHistory of Royal Christmases\n\nCivil war in England broke out between Charles I (Royalists) and Parliamentarians in 1642.,,,When Charles and the Royalists were defeated in 1646 the Long Parliament (sitting since 1640) passed an Ordinance that abolished the feasts of Christmas, Easter and Whitsun, known as the Christian festival of Pentecost. Charles was later executed in 1649 and England became a Republic.\n\n​History of Royal Christmases\n\nCharles II set about restoring the Monarchy and ....also reversed the legislation that prohibited religious festivals.\n\nHistory of Royal Christmases​\n\nKing Richard's sumptuous court at Eltham, where he celebrated in particular three Christmasses at Eltham, at which every imaginable entertainment was provided for a court overflowing with all the beauty and chivalry that could flatter a monarch, and scatter flowers over the dangerous precipice to which he was hastening. \"The king,\" says Hollinshed, \"kept the greatest part, and maintained the most plentiful house that ever any king in England did, either before his time or since ; for there resorted daily to his court above ten thousand persons, that had meat and drinke there allowed them. In his kitchen there were three hundred servitors, and every other officer was furnished after the like rate. Of ladies, chamberers, and landerers, there were above three hundred at the least; and in precious and costlie apparell they exceeded all measure onelie used in the court in those dayes, but also other people abroad in the townes and countries, had their garments cut far otherwise than had been accustomed before his dales, with embroderies, rich Airs, and goldsmith's worke, and everie daie there was devising of new fashions, to the great hinderance and decaie of the commonwealth.\" From this description, the reader may easily picture what must have been the splendid profusion which marked King Richard's doings at Eltham, when arriving with his gorgeous retinue from the capital, he \"courted repose\" in a new and most extravagant series of festivities.\n\nDuring a festival, King Richard had daily to his court above ten thousand persons, that had meat and drink there allowed them.\n\nThe extensive park, which spread its wooded avenues in all directions, afforded ample scope for the indulgence in silvan sports; while minstrels, jesters, and jongleurs drove ennui from the gate, and kept the monarch and his guests in a continued enjoyment of mirthful excitement.\n\nAbbeys, Castles and Ancient Halls of England and Wales: South 1872 John Timbs\n\nHenry VIII. was there again in 1526, but Christmas was not celebrated that year with the accustomed solemnities for fear of the plague, and hence was afterwards remembered by the name of the\n\n​still Christmas.\n\nDuring the time of Henry VIII, Eltham deteriorated, to the point where, it was no longer used as a royal residence, so the Christmas festivities discontinued\n\nQueen Charlotte, consort of King George III, is credited for introducing the Christmas tree\n\n​to Britain.\n\nHistory of Royal Christmases​​\n\n​At Eltham..no doubt word would be sent long beforehand if the King proposed to keep Christmas there. The yeomen of the kitchen had the beef put in the pickling tubs in November— vast quantities of beef, for, Christmas or not, the staple food of everybody in the winter was salt beef...Eltham, no doubt, depended upon the rich and fruitful country in which it stood. At eight miles from London, the markets there were of very little use. The annals of the Palace are simple, rather than scanty; in fact, there is plenty of mention made of the Palace, yet very little of importance is recorded concerning it. All that is recorded of it belongs to peace and festivity and the season of Christmas.\n\n​South London by Besant, Walter 1836-1901\n\n​How did they provide for so many guests?\n\n​How did they provide for the maintenance of so many guests? To feed two thousand every day is a great undertaking. We are accustomed to believe that the roads in winter were so bad as to be impassable. Now, everything had to be brought there, whatever the condition of the roads. And they were bye-roads, not high roads...due notice was certainly given; a vast quantity of salt provisions was laid down in readiness: for the rest, the country was fertile and well cultivated. The Park contained deer, but they could not kill all; the Thames, only three miles away...was full of salmon and every kind of fish: the banks of the lower reaches and those of the Ravensbourne, were the homes of myriads of wild birds. Still, one feels that the inland communications of the fourteenth century must have been a great deal better than those of the seventeenth century in order to allow..

The moat which surrounded it was of great width; the principal entry was over a stone bridge and through a gateway in the north wall. There was also another gateway and bridge on the opposite side of the enclosure.

The whole of this area was raised about 15 feet, and surrounded by a moat of great breadth, the water flowing up to the external walls of the palace. There were two bridges over the moat, one on the north side, where was the approach to the principal gate ; the other on the opposite quarter, leading towards the gardens and pleasure-grounds. Only the north bridge is now standing; the waters of the moat have been drained, and the whole of the ancient buildings swept away, with the exception of the great hall, and a building of two stories near the east end of the hall, probably a fragment of the lodgings erected by Henry VII.\n\nExamples of Gothic architecture 1895\n\n​In describing the architecture of this beautiful hall,..The internal dimensions are 101 feet 4 inches by 36 feet; so that the length is rather less than three times the breadth, and is divided into six compartments, or bays, by the arched trusses which form the main supports of the roof.

Above stairs in lodgings, called the king's side, were seventeen lodging-rooms; on the queen's side, twelve chambers ; and on the prince's side, nine lodging-rooms; in all thirty-eight, with various other necessary apartments and closets. Thirty-five bayes of buildings round the court-yard, which contained one acre of ground, the said bayes of buddings consisting of seventy-eight rooms, used as offices. The whole, it appeared, were much out of repair, and the materials valued at £753, exclusive of the charge of taking it down.\n\n​​The picturesque beauties of Great Britain: Allen, Thomas\n\nPlans & Elevations\n\nThe windows of the hall are ranged in couples, in five spaces on both sides, occupying the length\n\nof the building, from the east wall to the angle of the lays; every window is cinquefoil-headed and divided by a mullion without a transom, around which in some instances the thick trails of ivy impart a highly picturesque effect, which is heightened by the broad streams of cheerful sunlight that fall through the empty panels; and every space is divided by a buttress, which terminates below the cornice, and at the foot of the windows has twice the projection of the upper hall. Altogether, however, these supports are slender and partake of the same light and elegant proportions which characterise the whole building. The walls alone are adequate to the weight which presses on them, but their strength is increased by the buttresses —features which are almost inseparable from the ancient style of architecture, and were frequently used for ornament even when their strength was superfluous.\n\nOld & New London, Thornbury & Walford\n\nEltham Palace, North Bay of Hall\n\nStaircase, Eltham Lodge\n\nEltham Lodge (Godfrey)\n\nPlan of Eltham Lodge (Godfrey)\n\nKing John's Barn\n\nHenry VIII.

It appears to have been about the year 1836 that the discovery of these passages was made; and from a pamphlet published a few years ago we learn that a trap-door under the ground floor of one of the apartments led into a room below, ten feet by five in dimensions, from which a narrow passage about ten feet in length led to a series of passages, with decoys, stairs, and shafts, some of which were vertical and others on an inclined plane: these were once used for admitting air, and for hurling down missiles and pitch-balls upon the heads of those below. These passages were explored to a distance of nearly 500 feet, 200 of which lay under the moat. In a field between Eltham and Mottingham the arch had been broken into, but still the passage could be traced farther, proceeding in the same direction. In that part immediately under the moat two iron gates were found, completely carbonised, whilst large stalactites, formed of super-carbonate of lime, which hung down from the roof of the arch, sufficiently indicated the lapse of time since these passages had been previously entered. The passages now serve as drains in connection with the dwelling house which now stands upon the site of the ancient buttery at the eastern end of the great hall. The moat, which still surrounds the entire building, has been partially drained and turfed, and that part lying on the north side, which is spanned by the ancient bridge, is exceedingly picturesque, the effect being heightened by the herons and other species of water fowl that adorn its banks.\n\n​​Old and New London: The southern suburbs By Walter Thornbury, Edward Walford 1893\n\nHow easy, with neglect, a Royal Palace & Banquet Hall, over time, became a place to store hay, surrounded by stagnating water\n\n​ ​By the end of the Tudor reign, the palace was falling into ruin, the great hall of the palace, was later to be known as 'King John's barn'.\n\nUpon the breaking out of the civil war in the reign of Charles I., the parliamentary general, Robert, Earl of Essex, took up his residence in this royal mansion, and here he died in 1646. It was confiscated, together with other possessions of the crown, on the death of the king; and in 1649, a survey of the palace, with all its appurtenances, was made by commissioners from the parliament, for the purpose of exposing the whole to sale as national property. In this parliamentary survey, \"the capital mansion called Eltham \" is said to contain one fair chapel, one great hall, forty-six rooms and offices on the ground floor, with two large cellars and on the upper floor, seventeen lodging-rooms on the king's side, twelve on the queen's side, and nine on the prince's side, in all thirty-eight; and thirty-five bayes of building, in which were seventy-eight rooms in the offices round the court-yard, which contained one acre of ground. All the rooms were unfurnished, except the hall and chapel ; and the whole building was in bad repair, and untenantable\n\nExamples of Gothic architecture 1895\n\nThe British Museum\n\nThe only parts now remaining are the banqueting hall; an ivy-covered bridge of three ribbed arches which spans the moat on the north side, and still forms the entrance to the budding; part of the embattled wall, flanked with loop-holed turrets; some curious drains, supposed formerly to have been used as sallyports on occasions of emergency; and a building at the east end of the hall, with fine corbelled attics and ancient gables, formerly the buttery, but now a private residence, called the Court House. This latter building was thoroughly restored, and a new wing added to it in 1859, at which time the great hall, which had been for many years used as a barn, was cleared out, and the eastern end of it considerably altered, being made to serve as the entrance to the house. By far the most interesting of these remains is the magnificent banqueting hall, with its beautiful high-pitched roof, entirely constructed of oak, in tolerable preservation, with hammer beams, carved pendants and braces supported on corbels of hewn stone. Its dimensions are too feet in length, 55 in height. and 30 in breadth. \"The hall,\" writes Mr. Buckler, in his \"Historical and Descriptive Account of the Royal Palace at Eltham\" (1828), \"was the master feature of the palace.

'Ring o'roses' referred to the skin changes that resulted from it, and sneezing was a symptom of the respiratory form of the disease. The pleasant smell of a posy of fragrant herbs was believed to prevent contagion from bad smells, and many of those who 'fell down' in real life never got up again. Though the rhyme is now all that remains of the plague in English folk memory, it dominated English life for two-and-a-half centuries, from 1348 to 1679, and left its mark on history and literature.\n\nRead more................\n\nhttps://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/plague\n\n​​​The Great Plague of London​ 1665\n\n​This was the worst outbreak of plague in England since the black death of 1348. London lost roughly 15% of its population. While 68,596 deaths were recorded in the city, the true number was probably over 100,000. Other parts of the country also suffered. The earliest cases of disease occurred in the spring of 1665 in a parish outside the city walls called St Giles-in-the-Fields. The death rate began to rise during the hot summer months and peaked in September when 7,165 Londoners died in one week. Rats carried the fleas that caused the plague.\n\nRead more.........\n\nhttps://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources\n\n​The “Great Plague” was now killing over a thousand people a day, and at its peak, and it had grown so deathly quiet in London that throughout the City the river could be heard flowing under the nineteen arches\n\n​of the old bridge.\n\nhttps://lostcityoflondon.co.uk/tag/great-plague/\n\nThey say, Fire is a cleanser.\n\nThe year after the Great Plague, in 1666, London was charred & consumed, but the Great fire.\n\nTowards the close of the year 1526 the plague raged so fiercely in London that the king and his Court removed to Eltham. ​\n\n​​Old and New London\n\nIn London after the Black Death, the plague resurfaced about every 10 years from 1348 to 1665.

The first, in 1563, probably caused the greatest proportional mortality of all the London outbreaks, accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the city's population: probably as many as 18,000 people died.\n\n​https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/plague\n\nThe Black Death, which hit Europe in 1347, claimed an astonishing 200 million lives in just four years.\n\nBlack Death, From the Swiss manuscript the Toggenburg Bible, 1411.\n\nThe Great Plague of 1665 was the last and one of the worst of the centuries-long outbreaks, killing 100,000 Londoners in just seven months.\n\nAll public entertainment was banned and victims were forcibly shut into their homes to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n​\n\nRed crosses were painted on their doors along with a plea for forgiveness:\n\n“Lord have mercy upon us.”\n\nAll told, the Great Fire had destroyed 13,200 buildings and left an estimated 100,000 people homeless.

The first war was settled with Oliver Cromwell’s victory for Parliamentary forces at the 1645 Battle of Naseby. The second phase ended with Charles’ defeat at the Battle of Preston and his subsequent execution in 1649. Charles’ son, Charles, then formed an army of English and Scottish Royalists, which prompted Cromwell to invade Scotland in 1650. The following year, Cromwell shattered the remaining Royalist forces and ended the “wars of the three kingdoms,” though Charles II eventually ascended to the throne in 1660.\n\nRead more..........\n\nwww.history.com/topics/british-history/english-civil-wars\n\nEltham Palace today"
