The Chronicle of Ralph of Coggeshall records the birth in 1209 of \"Ricardus secundus filius regis\". Matthew Paris records that \"Isabel Anglorum regina\" gave birth in 1208 to \"Johanni regi filium legitimum...Ricardum\". He was designated Comte de Ponthieu before 14 Aug 1225. Created Earl of Cornwall 30 May 1227. In 1236, he was suggested as intermediary to negotiate an Anglo/imperial alliance proposed by Emperor Friedrich II but did not take up the post. The Continuator of Florence of Worcester records that \"Ricardus comes Cornubiæ frater Henrici regis Angliæ\" went to Jerusalem in [1239]. Implementing a crusading vow taken in 1236, Richard arrived at Acre in Palestine 11 Oct 1240, re-established some order in the kingdom of Jerusalem, and left in May 1241. He renounced the county of Ponthieu in Dec 1243. Richard was one of the proposed candidates to replace Heinrich Raspe as anti-king of Germany in 1247, and in 1250 may have been offered the Sicilian crown by Pope Innocent IV. According to Matthew Paris, he refused the kingdom of Sicily on the Pope's terms, after which the Pope offered it to King Henry who accepted it on behalf of his son Edmund. In Dec 1256, Richard was offered the German crown by the archbishops of Köln and Mainz to whom promises of payment of 8,000 marks had each been made, supported by Ludwig II Duke of Bavaria, who was betrothed to the daughter of King Henry III with a dowry of 12,000 marks, and subsequently by Otakar II King of Bohemia. Richard accepted the offer before the English parliament, and sailed for Germany. The offer was confirmed by a limited election outside Frankfurt 13 Jan 1257, entry into the city being barred by Arnold Archbishop of Trier. He was crowned RICHARD King of Germany on 17 May 1257 at Aachen Cathedral with his wife. Although his rival Alfonso X King of Castile had initially enjoyed the support of France and the Pope, King Henry III's peaceful settlement with Louis IX King of France in Jan 1257 provided the basis for Pope Alexander IV to modify his own position and on 30 Apr 1259 he secretly invited Richard to Rome for his imperial coronation, although Richard was unable to leave England because of the deteriorating relations with the barons. He was elected Roman senator in Apr 1261, with the support particularly of cardinals John of Toledo and Ottobono Fieschi. Pope Urban IV was less sympathetic to his cause, obtaining a more powerful military ally to protect his position in Italy in Charles Comte d'Anjou. The dispute was unresolved by the Papal Bull Qui Clum dated 27 Aug 1263 which found that both candidates for the German throne were king-elect. However, in 1266 Pope Clement IV appears to have favoured Richard's candidacy over a possible election of Konradin. After the latter's execution in 1268, Friedrich von Meissen emerged as a new possible candidate for the German throne and Richard renewed his efforts to increase his authority in Germany, in particular by his third marriage to a relative of Engelbert Archbishop of Köln. Richard suffered an apoplectic stroke in [Oct] 1271 which paralysed his left side and affected the balance of his mind. The Annales Halesiensibus record the death \"1272 Berhamstede IV Non Apr\" of \"rex Ricardus Alemanie\" and his burial \"apud Heles\". The Continuator of Florence of Worcester records the death \"IV Non Apr apud Berhamstede\" [1272] of \"Ricardus Alemannia rex\" and his burial \"apud monasterium de Hayles\" which he had founded. A writ dated 5 Apr \"56 Hen III\", after the death of \"Richard king of Almain\", records \"Sir Edmund his son, aged 22 on the day of St Stephen last, is his heir\" .\n\nm firstly (Fawley, Buckinghamshire 13 or 30 Mar 1231) as her second husband, ISABEL Marshal, widow of GILBERT de Clare Earl of Hertford and Gloucester , daughter of WILLIAM Marshal Earl of Pembroke & his wife Isabella de Clare (Pembroke Castle 9 Oct 1200-Berkhamstead Castle, Hertfordshire 15 or 17 Jan 1240, bur Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire). The Annals of Tewkesbury record the marriage \"III Kal Apr apud Falle juxta Merlawe\" in 1231 of \"Ysabel comitissa Gloucestriæ\" and \"Ricardo comiti Cornubiæ, fratri Henrici regis Angliæ\". Her (second) marriage is recorded by Matthew Paris, who names her \"Ysabellam comitissam Gloverniæ\" sister of William Marshall Earl of Pembroke, specifying that the marriage took place in April. The Annales Cambriæ record the marriage in 1231 of \"Ricardus comes Cornubiæ\" and \"Isabellam cometissam Gloucestriæ\". The Annales Londonienses record the marriage in 1231 of \"Ricardus frater regis\" and \"Isabellam comitissam Gloverniæ, relictam Gileberti de Clare\". The Annales Londonienses record the death in 1240 of \"comitissa Gloverniæ uxor comitis Ricardi\" in childbirth. The Annals of Tewkesbury record the death \"XVI Kal Feb apud Berkhamstede\"in 1239 of \"Isabella comitissa Gloucestriæ et Hertfordiæ, Cornubiæ et Pictaviæ\" and her burial \"apud Bellum Locum Cisterciensis ordinis\". Matthew Paris records that she died of jaundice contracted in childbirth .\n\nm secondly (Contract 17 Jul 1242, Westminster Abbey 23 Nov 1243) SANCHA de Provence, daughter of RAYMOND BERENGER IV Comte de Provence & his wife Béatrice de Savoie (Aix-en-Provence [1225]-Berkhamstead Castle, Buckinghamshire 5 or 9 Nov 1261, bur Hayles Abbey, Gloucestershire). \"Petrus de Sabaudia\" acted as proxy for the marriage of \"Richardo comite Cornubie\" and \"Sanccie filie Raimundi Berengarii comitis provincie\", recorded in a charter dated 17 Jul 1242. The Annales Londonienses record the marriage \"die Sanctæ Ciciliæ\" in 1243 of \"Ricardus frater regis\" and \"Beatrix uxor comitis Provinciæ filiam suam Cyntiam\". The marriage is recorded and dated by Matthew Paris, who confirms the bride´s parentage. She was crowned Queen of Germany with her husband 17 May 1257 at Aachen Cathedral. The Annales Halesiensibus record the death \"1261 V Id Nov apud Berhamstede\" of \"Sanchia regina Alemannie\" and her burial \"apud Heiles\". The Annals of Osney record the death \"die Mercurii proximo ante festum beati Martini apud Berchamstede\" in 1261 of \"Schenchia regina Alemanniæ, soror Elianoræ reginæ Angliæ\" and her burial \"ad domum de Hayles\" .\n\nm thirdly (Kaiserslauten Stiftskirche 16 Jun 1269) BEATRIX [van Valkenburg], daughter of [DIRK [II] Heer van Valkenburg & his first wife Bertha van Limburg] (-17 Oct 1277, bur Oxford, church of the Franciscan Friars Minor). The Annales Halesiensibus record the marriage in 1267 of \"rex Riccardus Alemannie\" and \"Beatricem cuius avunculus fuit archiepiscopus Colonie\". The same relationship is hinted by the charter dated 13 Sep 1271 in which \"Richardus romanorum rex\" refers to \"E. Coloniensi archiepiscopi\" as \"affinis nostri\". The primary source which confirms her parentage more precisely has not yet been identified, although the reference to \"Falkestan\" (presumably in error for Valkenburg/Falkenburg) in the record of her death quoted below suggests that she must have been the daughter of Dietrich [II] von Valkenburg if Engelbert Archbishop of Köln was her uncle. If this is correct, the date of her marriage suggests that she was the daughter of Dietrich [II]´s first wife, but this is not without doubt as other primary sources show marriages celebrated when the bride was aged 12 at that time. This marriage was arranged to bolster Richard's support in Germany, through the bride's influential uncle Engelbert Archbishop of Köln. The Annals of Osney record the death \"in vigilia Sancti Lucæ Evangelistæ\"in 1277 of \"Beatrix de Falkestan, regina Alemanniæ, uxor regis Ricardi\"and her burial \"in ecclesia fratrum Minorum Oxoniæ\" .\n\nMistress (1): JEANNE de Valletort, daughter of ---.

The name of Earl Richard´s second mistress is not known.\n\nEarl Richard & his first wife had four children: John, Isabella, Henry and Nicholas.\n\nEarl Richard & his second wife had [four] children: a daughter, Richard, Edmund and [Richard].\n\nEarl Richard had one illegitimate son by Mistress (1): Richard.\n\nEarl Richard had one illegitimate son by Mistress (2): Walter\n\n[FMG/Medieval Lands]\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRichard, Count of Poitou by 18 Aug 1225 (renounced c Dec 1243), 1st Earl of Cornwall, so styled from 21 Aug 1227 and King of the Romans (ie. heir presumptive to the Holy Roman Empire), so elected at Frankfurt 13 Jan 1256/7 and crowned at Aachen 17 May 1257 but soon ejected and returned to England, three of the Electors apparently having thrown him over because his monetary inducements to them were too small, PC (1253); Constable of Wallingford Castle 1216; knighted Feb 1224/5 and granted by his brother Henry III 13 Feb 1224/5 the County of Cornwall during the King's pleasure, following which he was presumably invested as Earl of that county; Lt of Guienne 1226-7; Ambassador to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II 1237 and Popes Innocent IV and Alexander IV 1250 and 1259 respectively; went on Crusade 1240-41; Co- or sole Regent during his brother Henry III's campaigns in Gascony 1253-54, fought with his brother Henry III against Simon de Montfort's barons at Battle of Lewes 1264, where he was captured; married 1st 30 March 1230/1 Isabel, 3rd daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and widow of Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford and 2nd Earl of Gloucester, and had three sons (all died young or sp); married 2nd 22 Nov 1243 Sancha, sister of his brother Henry III's wife Eleanor and 3rd daughter and coheir of Raymond Berengar V, Count of Provence, and by her had two or three sons (also died young or sp, including the 2nd and last Earl of Cornwall); married 3rd 16 June 1269 Beatrice, 2nd daughter of Walram de Fauquemont (or Valkenberg, near Mastricht), Seigneur de Montjoie and brother of Engelbert Archbishop of Cologne, and died 2 April 1272, leaving by Jeanne de Valletort, an illegitimate son.\n\n[Burke's Peerage]\n\nEvents\n\n Ruled: 1257-1272 (Holy Roman Emperor-symbolic only).\n\n Manorial Estate, 1256-1272, Holdgate Manor, Much Wenlock, Shropshire, TF13, GB. 4 Called 'Stantune' in 1086, (fn. 46) HOLDGATE had presumably been part of the greater 'Stantune' that was restored to the church of Wenlock in 901 by Aethelraed and Aethelflaed. In their time 'Stantune' seems also to have included Stanton Long. (fn. 47) By 1066 the 'Stantune' that became Holdgate had again ceased to belong to the church of Wenlock and consisted of five estates held freely by Ketil (Chetel), Genust, Alweard (Aelward), Dunning, and Aelfgifu (Elueua). By 1086 Helgot held them of Roger of Montgomery, earl of Shrewsbury (the tenant in chief) as two estates. (fn. 48) He was called Helgot of 'Reisolent', (fn. 49) perhaps from Résenlieu (Orne) in or near Roger's vicomté of the Hiémois, and was the eponymous lord who gave his name to his chief manor and to the barony centred on it. Honor and manor descended together. (fn. 50) Helgot's son Herbert of Clee, (fn. 51) nephew of Geoffrey of Clee ('de Clive'), bishop of Hereford, (fn. 52) succeeded before 1116 (fn. 53) and was living in 1121. The family is presumed to have held the manor in chief after Earl Robert's forfeiture in 1102. Herbert's son Herbert (fn. 54) of Castle Holdgate ('de castello Holgot') (fn. 55) was chief lord in 1166 (fn. 56) and died in 1189 or 1190. (fn. 57) His widow died childless in 1192 or 1193. (fn. 58) By 1194 Ralph of Arden held the manor, (fn. 59) apparently in right of his wife Agnes, daughter and heir of Robert de la Mare (perhaps a nephew of Herbert of Castle Holdgate) (fn. 60) and widow of Robert Mauduit of Warminster (Wilts.). (fn. 61) Between 1197 and 1199 Ralph was succeeded as lord by Agnes's son Thomas Mauduit. (fn. 62) In 1244, after Thomas's death, Holdgate passed to his son William (fn. 63) who alienated it in 1256 to Richard, earl of Cornwall and king of the Romans (d. 1272). (fn. 64) Richard's son Earl Edmund succeeded as lord, (fn. 65) although the Templars of Lydley had held the manor of the earl of Cornwall in fee farm since 1263. (fn. 66) The Templars' tenure lasted until some time between 1276 (fn. 67) and c. 1284. (fn. 68) Between c. 1284 and 1292 Earl Edmund's feudal tenant of Holdgate, Robert Burnell, bishop of Bath and Wells, acquired the chief lordship, (fn. 69)\n\nFootnotes:\n\n46. V.C.H.

The overlordship of the manor passed to the descendants of William Mauduit in the same way as the manor of Hartley Mauduit, of which Shalden was held.\n\nThe manor was apparently held by the Mauduits of Hartley Mauduit in demesne until near the end of the 12th century, when William Mauduit of Hanslope gave this manor to his brother Robert Mauduit of Warminster to be held of William and his heirs for the service of half a knight's fee. Robert Mauduit died in 1191, and his son and successor Thomas was holding the manor in 1235-6. He died in 1244, and was succeeded by his son William. Thomas the successor of William left a son and heir Warin, a minor, whose custody was assigned by Henry III to his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall. From Warin some interest in the manor seems to have passed on his death in 1299-1300 to his son Thomas, for he granted a virgate of land at Shalden to Walter Stoner his freeman for his homage and services. Before this time, however, the manor seems to have passed to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, for he obtained from Henry III a grant of free warren there, and on his death in 1272 the manor descended to his son Edmund.\n\n Inquisition, 5 Apr 1272. 6 808.
