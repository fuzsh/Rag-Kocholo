He was educated in Canterbury and at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1670.[2] He was knighted around 1675. He was MP for Herefordshire from 1701 to 1705.[3] He succeeded his father as baronet in 1712.[1]\n\nWilliams married Mary Powell (1663–1704), daughter of Sir William Powell on 11 February 1675.[1] The couple had two sons and six daughters, but only three of the daughters survived their parents.[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
