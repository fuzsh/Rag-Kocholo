        "text": "ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN DEER PARKS IN KENT By SUSAN PITTMAN Canterbury Christ Church University Thesis submitted to the University of Kent at Canterbury for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy January 2011 VOLUME ONE Abstract Elizabethan and Jacobean Deer Parks in Kent Although many researchers have contributed to the knowledge and understanding of the number, characteristics, landscape, management and ethos of medieval deer parks, there has been little coverage of deer parks in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, interest re-emerging with the upsurge of eighteenth century landscaped parks. This thesis aims to somewhat redress the imbalance by concentrating on the deer parks in one county, Kent, during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. The trigger for the choice of period was the earliest printed list of parks, which appeared in Lambarde's 'A Perambulation of Kent' published in 1576, with a second edition in 1596. After a discussion about the accuracy of the lists, topics such as the number, distribution, location, shape, size and longevity of Kentish deer parks are covered in Part I. How deer parks were managed forms two chapters in Part II, with the process of and reasons for disparkment and the management of disparked parks occupying another chapter. The ownership of parks in Part III addresses issues such as who held parks in 1558, how ownership was acquired, the reasons behind the successful retention of parks, which parks changed hands or were created and whether new owners there were differences between them and established owners. Lastly, one chapter in Part IV investigates the role Kentish parks played in enhancing the lifestyle of their owners, while another chapter concentrates on the negative perception of deer parks among those excluded from them and how this was expressed in a complexity of park violations. Lambarde left readers with the impression that deer parks in Kent were in decline, but this research shows that they retained their potent symbolism and indeed were generally flourishing throughout the period under review.

The personal focus on deer parks arose in the 1980s when assisting in the mapping and measurement of over one hundred ancient pollards in Lullingstone(55) park in Kent.1 Curiosity about the origin of these trees led to research into the park, which resulted in a slim publication on the subject.2 Years later a similar research project into a Duchy of Cornwall deer park, Kerrybullock, near a holiday haunt in the Tamar valley, widened the interest.3 It has long been an ambition to undertake detailed investigation into the deer parks of Kent, which this research has fulfilled, albeit for practical reasons concentrating on the relatively limited period spanning the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I from 1558 to 1625. The starting point of the research was inspired by the list of Kentish deer parks produced by the Elizabethan historian, William Lambarde, in the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' published in 1576 – the earliest printed list of parks for any county.4 Originally it was intended to extend the research into the reign of Charles I in order to assess the effect of the Civil War on deer parks, but time and space constraints made this impractical. There is, however, a certain logic in concentrating on the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I because both enjoyed hunting, the latter almost obsessively, and the monarchs' enthusiasm in this regard affected noble and gentry attitudes towards deer parks, which, during years of relative stability, could be studied to evaluate how they fitted into everyday culture without the distortions of the turmoil of internal warfare. 1 Numbers in brackets by park names are used throughout the thesis to identify individual parks in alphabetical order, so that they can be found on Map 1.1 p.316 and in the Park profiles from p.351; Rackham(1976:200) pollard = tree which is cut 8 – 12 feet above ground level and allowed to grow again from the bolling (trunk) to produce successive crops of wood. 2 Pittman(1983). 3 Pittman(1991). 4 A Perambulation of Kent: Conteining the description, Historie, and Customes of that Shyre. Collected and written (for the most part) in the yeare 1570 by William Lambarde of Lincolnes Inne gent. and nowe increased by the addition of some things which the Autheur him selfe hath observed since that time, (printed in London 1576). 2 As the first substantive research related to deer parks for any county for the late sixteenth into the seventeenth century, this study is wide ranging. Almost every aspect adds to the corpus of knowledge about the subject, and the whole might be seen to establish a base from which further research might emanate, rather than adding nuances, reinforcing or challenging conclusions of previous research. A major aim at the outset was to determine at a county level the overall state of parks, whether, as William Lambarde intimated, they were in decline, or whether they were stagnating or flourishing. Where opportunities have arisen on a subsidiary level, the findings of other historians have been tested against the Kent model, forming minor themes interwoven through the text. In the absence of any research into Kentish deer parks, basic questions such as identifying the number of parks in existence, their distribution, characteristics, management and ownership had to be tackled in order to establish the groundwork. Following this process, the dynamic forces behind parks were investigated; the factors contributing to the successful functioning or creation of parks; the degree, pace and process of disparkment; how parks were appreciated and valued by their owners; and the extent to which threats to parks from those denied regular access to them might have undermined their viability. The choice of parks to study was fairly arbitrary in that any park referred to in contemporary documents, i.e. from 1558 to 1625, was included, giving an eventual total of exactly one hundred. The reason for this decision was that if the creators of documents were still referring to an area of land as a park, it should be included whether or not it was still operating as a viable deer park. In any case, in the early stages of research the status of each park had not always been confirmed, and even at the end, for some, it remained unknown. The definition of 'park' within the context of this study is therefore necessarily broad and incorporates any area specifically called a park, which had once been enclosed for deer or continued to contain deer. Thus parks with deer, parks without deer, and completely disparked parks have come under scrutiny. Where a specific selection of parks has been made for deeper consideration, for example, parks still with deer when reviewing management, or defunct parks in the discussion about disparkment, this has been made clear in the text. 3 In order to make any progress towards arriving at an overview, profiles for one hundred individual parks were compiled, despite the extraordinary difficulties in so doing.5 Evidence about deer parks was widely scattered both in state papers and family estate records, but even after scouring a wide variety of documents sometimes little more than a snippet of relevant information was unearthed. The diversity of these sources becomes apparent in the number of footnote references, which have been necessary. There were disappointingly few documents solely related to deer parks even among the most extensive family papers such as those of Lord De L'Isle and Dudley, but where such documents survived they provided significant insights into aspects of park management, use and ownership.6 Despite considerable endeavour some park profiles barely contain more than one or two references, while other park profiles are fuller, but contain references widely spaced in time and variable in usefulness. Nevertheless, the park profiles provide as comprehensive a list as possible of both documentary and secondary evidence extant for every park known in Kent from 1558 to 1625. Although medieval deer parks have long captured the imagination and interest of historians at parish, county and national levels, the same does not apply to the Tudor and Stuart period, which tends to be tacked on as a postscript to studies of medieval deer parks or as a prologue to studies of eighteenth century parks.7 This hiatus in the history of parks means that there is little direct comparative secondary material at hand, although where possible parallels have been found from the medieval period. For this reason no detailed review of published sources appears in this introduction, but rather such publications as have a bearing on particular topics are reviewed in each chapter, because each has required different historiographical literature. The thesis is structured in four parts. In Part I the general background to Kentish parks is discussed. Chapter One concentrates on an analysis of and commentary on William Lambarde's park lists of 1576 and 1596, which were found to be reasonably accurate.8 When the lists were compared with five contemporary maps, 5 See Park profiles p.351 onwards. 6 Held at CKS and accessed by special permission of Lord De L'Isle. 7 Mileson(2009) reassesses previous research into medieval parks, and so his book provides an overall historiographical review. 8 Lambarde(1576); Lambarde, A Perambulation of Kent (London, 1596, 2nd edition). 4 the number of parks containing deer appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the period, with the number of parks going out of use being roughly balanced by newly created parks. However, as the park profiles reveal, there are yawning gaps in the history of individual parks, so only tentative conclusions could be drawn. Chapter Two discusses the main characteristics of parks and, with many originating before 1485, comparison with medieval parks in other counties was possible. Although Kent's varied geology strongly influenced the distribution of parks, particularly along the Greensand ridge belt, more complex factors such as archiepiscopal land holding, the proximity of London and the partial clearance of the Wealden woodland were also significant. The impression that Kent was less imparked than other counties has been queried, with the discovery of many more parks than originally thought, but as the same may be true of other counties, no firm conclusion can be drawn. Part II covers the management of parks in three chapters. Chapter Three discusses the management parks owned by gentlemen and noblemen and Chapter Four the management of crown parks. As there appears to have been no previous detailed study of the management of Elizabethan and Jacobean parks for any county, this study for Kent forms a template against which any future county studies can be set. Although books by Gascoigne and Markham gave detailed advice on estate management, how Elizabethan and Jacobean owners actually managed their parks is not well documented.9 Evidence has to be pieced together from a few illustrative examples, which were found scattered in estate papers, but they form an impressionistic picture revealing these parks, like their medieval counterparts, to have incorporated a mixture of diverse uses compatible with the retention of deer. The roles of the deer keeper in gentry parks and, in Chapter Four, the park keeper in royal parks have been outlined in as much detail as the evidence allows, because it was felt that very little systematic examination of these roles had previously been carried out. Roger Manning in his pioneering book on hunters and poachers from 1485 to 1640 tackled the subject, but did not always distinguish between the deer keeper 9 Gascoigne, The Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting (1575, London); Markham, Maison Rustique, or The countrey farme (London, 1616). 5 and the park keeper.10 His comments about the prevalence of poaching backgrounds among deer keepers were thought worthy of testing for the county of Kent, with the discovery that many deer keepers came from respectable yeoman families and performed their duties diligently, although examples of rogue deer keepers were not hard to find.11 Chapter Five examines the process of disparkment and the management of disparked parks, as they were converted to other uses. It ends with a discussion of the residuary survival of disparked parks long after their original function had ended. William Lambarde was found to be less reliable over the pace and timing of disparkment, which he implied was continuing to accelerate in Elizabeth I's reign. Such patchy evidence as survives indicates that the rate of disparkment slowed down in Kent between 1558 and 1625, and that, for Kent at least, the decline of the park was exaggerated. Even an apparently straightforward exercise to establish lines of park ownership has proved to be unexpectedly difficult. Chapter Six in Part Three covers this topic. There was overall stability in the ownership of parks, with many families holding parks for several generations before 1558, and continuing to do so until 1625 and after. Those who newly acquired parks during this period tended to be members of the Kentish gentry, not unlike the established owners, but some had newly acquired wealth. Where there was a disruption in park ownership loss or disparkment tended to coincide with particular family circumstances, rather than apparently being spurred on by the general economic climate of the time. There appears to have been a reluctance to give up parks, necessity rather than enthusiasm being the motivation to gain added income from disparkment. Lastly, Part IV reveals opposing perceptions of parks, Chapter Seven from the owners' viewpoint, and Chapter Eight from the viewpoint of those excluded from parks. The owners and their milieu placed great value on their parks in terms of prestige, status, largesse, and the enjoyment that they derived from them, both as venues of recreation and aesthetically, as settings for their mansions. The strength of this 10 Manning(1993:28-33,189-195). 11 Ibid. 6 attachment partly explains why owners were so keen to retain their parks. However, Chapter Eight assesses the counter force of those, including gentlemen and men from lower strata of society, who were denied access to the private hunting preserves of the elite. Depositions, mainly from the Kent Quarter Sessions and from the court of Star Chamber, but also from the Sutherland and De L'Isle and Dudley family papers, provided a depth of information about park breaks, and enabled a vivid reconstruction of their nature and complexity.12 An attempt has been made to estimate the threat park violations posed to the viability of parks, but it proved impossible to quantify this, neither is there comparative material from other counties to establish whether Kentish parks were more or less vulnerable to incursion. The drive to undertake this thesis has been strong enough to overcome the distinct disadvantage of the fragmentary, scattered, often sparse yet varied, nature of the documentation. Yet, in following up every lead, reading widely, and undertaking visits to numerous park sites, it has been possible to convey an evocative impression of the dynamics behind deer parks throughout the period 1558 to 1625. Because there is no wider framework within which to place an interpretation of Kent parks, it has been hard to judge how typical they were, but whatever was happening elsewhere the impression is that deer parks in Kent were both relatively stable in numbers and that indeed most were flourishing. 12 The Sutherland papers are held at Staffordshire Record Office. 7 PART I – KENT BACKGROUND Little is known about deer parks in Kent for any period, but even less is known about them in the late Tudor and early Stuart periods. It is therefore essential to establish which parks were operating as deer parks and which disparked parks survived in the landscape as separate entities. Lambarde's lists of parks, with and without deer, dating from 1576 and 1596, and five contemporary maps are useful primary sources to aid the identification of parks and will act as a starting point in establishing the number of parks in Chapter One. The distribution, location, density, shape, size and longevity of the parks will be discussed in Chapter Two. 8 PART I - CHAPTER ONE WILLIAM LAMBARDE, EARLY CARTOGRAPHERS AND THE EVIDENCE FOR THE NUMBER OF PARKS IN ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN KENT The aim of this chapter is to review contemporary printed sources covering the whole county of Kent to estimate the number of parks containing herds of deer in Elizabeth I's and James I's reigns and to see whether these sources enable a preliminary assessment to be made about whether the number of active parks was stable, fluctuating, decreasing or increasing. Throughout this thesis a distinction between 'active' and 'disparked' parks is being made. The term 'active' refers to parks known to have held deer for at least some time in the period from 1558 to 1625, together with those parks that were shown on contemporary maps. The term 'disparkment' will be discussed fully in Chapter Five, but for the time being non-active parks were those either without deer, or those for which the existence of deer remains unproven. For nearly all parks there is insufficient evidence to prove whether there were deer in parks and, if not, to pinpoint exactly when they were removed. Attention will initially be focused on the only contemporary textual source to contain information about parks in Kent, namely William Lambarde's 'A Perambulation of Kent' first published in 1576 and revised in 1596, both editions of which included a list of deer parks in the county. In the first edition the list comprised 52 parks of which 34 contained deer and 18 did not, and in the second edition 54 of which 31 contained deer and 23 did not.1 The list of 1576 is the earliest printed list for any county, although a written list of 22 Suffolk parks and their owners survives from c.1560.2 Lists of parks from another six counties appear in state papers in the early 1580s, following enquiries into the number of parks with breeding mares.3 A comparison of Lambarde's two lists indicates both particular and long-term changes. In the former case, five parks were added to the number of disparked parks, which rose from 18 in 1576 to 23 in 1596. Secondly, by specifying disparked parks 1 Lambarde(1576:48-49) The Particular of Kent; Lambarde(1596:60-61) The Particular of Kent; see Figure 1.1, p.9 for comparison between Lambarde's lists of deer parks. 2 Suffolk Record Office B449/5/31/36 Hengrave manorial record, cited by Hoppitt(1992:1). 3 TNA SP12/162/38 Cornwall, SP12/163/20 Dorsetshire, SP12/163/14 Hertfordshire, SP12/148/63 Norfolk, SP12/162/44 Somerset, SP12/162/34 Wiltshire.

By implication Lambarde attributes the loss of nearly half the deer parks to the expense of maintaining them for pleasure alone, although he did not elaborate on what he meant by disparkment. As will be discussed in Chapter Five, disparkment was a complex process, encompassing various stages, but for the purposes of this chapter Lambarde's simple definition of disparkment, namely that the parks no longer sustained deer, will suffice.5 Lambarde's estimation that nearly half of the county's many parks had been disparked within living memory, at the time of the first edition, was a drastic and noticeable change. This contention, along with Lambarde's identification of specific disparked parks, will be explored in the opening section (i) of the chapter to give a summary of sixteenth century developments prior to the reign of Elizabeth I. In the second section (ii) Lambarde's experience as a disciplined historian and his personal knowledge of the county of Kent will be examined to assess the reliability of his research, which will be shown to be of a generally high standard. In section (iii) Lambarde's invaluable lists with their overview of existing parks in 1576 and 1596 will come under scrutiny, with discussion about their inconsistencies and ambiguities. Although Lambarde made a few alterations to his previous list of parks in the second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' of 1596, he did not revise the main text, so his statement about the rate of disparkment remained. This study will argue that the rate of disparkment slowed down from the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign until the end of the reign of James I, a trend that can be discerned by studying the five contemporary county maps to which attention will be turned in section (iv). These maps will be compared with each other and with Lambarde's lists. Finally, parks which were missed by all 4 Cony = an adult rabbit (http://dictionary.oed.com); Lambarde(1576:9) this paragraph was unaltered in Lambarde(1596:11). 5 See also Chapter Five pp.138-148. 11 these sources or which were set up later will be mentioned, to reach a conclusion in section (v) about the number of parks which had deer in them for at least part of Elizabeth I's and James I's reigns. (i) Loss of parks before Elizabeth I's accession Lambarde's key phrase 'within memorie' (used in the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' to which it must be assumed that it primarily applies) would take older inhabitants back to earlier turbulent times in the sixteenth century when there was disruption in the ownership of many parks.6 Lack of continuity of management seems to have led to the loss of deer herds in some parks and consolidated the disparked status of others, but evidence of the individual histories of each park is at best patchy, so in most cases circumstantial evidence is all that is available. However, it will be shown that the loss of nearly half the active parks in Kent occurred from the later years of Henry VIII's reign to the end of Mary I's reign.7 The church, owning two-fifths of the county from 1422 to 1535, was the largest landowner in Kent.8 This figure was well above the national average, and was largely attributable to the extensive land holdings of the archbishop of Canterbury. 9 Ecclesiastical bodies held about 30 parks in Kent before the English Reformation, with the archbishop of Canterbury alone owning at least 19 parks, many not on Lambarde's lists. The land exchanges and confiscations engineered by Henry VIII from 1537 to 1540 therefore had a great impact on Kent landownership.10 As a result of the transfers the archbishop lost a dramatic number of parks at Aldington(1), Bexley(5), Fryarne(36), Ightham(48), Knole(50), Langham(early park 16), Lyminge(56), Lympne(57), Maidstone(59), three at Otford(62-64), Panthurst(67), Saltwood(75) and Wrotham(100).11 Other ecclesiastical institutions with parks seized by the crown were Boxley Abbey (Boxley,14a), St. Augustine's Abbey (Canterbury Old park,19), the Priory of Christ Church (Canterbury Trenley 6 Lambarde(1576:9) The Estate of Kent. As a lawyer, Lambarde was probably thinking in terms of the phrase 'within living memory', which was normally taken to be a period of between 30 to 60 years. 7 In this section all ecclesiastical parks are included whether or not they appeared in Lambarde's lists. 8 Clark(1977:6) citing Du Boulay(1966:244-245). 9 Clark(1977:6) this estimate is derived from comparative data on monastic holdings in other parts of the country in P. Hughes, The Reformation in England I(New York, 1950-1954:375). 10 Du Boulay(1952:19-36). 11 Morice(1859:234-272); Du Boulay(1966:317-329). The 'earlier park' number is a park which does not appear in post 1558 documents, but which has been included on Map 1.1 'Map of Kent showing all known parks' (Appendix 4 p.316) and Figure 1.4 (Appendix 3 pp.310-315) as a bracketed number. 12 park(20) and Westwell,98), the Abbey of St. Mary Graces by the Tower of London (Elham, 30), and Folkestone Priory (Folkestone, 34).12 In addition, the bishopric of Rochester surrendered to the crown part of its land enclosed within Cooling(24) park.13 Effectively, the only parks, whether active or disparked, retained by the church were the archbishop of Canterbury's parks at Chislet(22), Curlswood(26), Ford(35) and Lympne(57) and the bishop of Rochester's park at Bromley(16).14 How many of the parks were maintained with deer under the ownership of the crown remains unclear, because little is known of their status prior to seizure, but had they been disparked for any length of time Lambarde's 'within memorie' would have been somewhat overstretched.15 However, it is clear that lack of continuity in management and the desire of the crown and its lessees to maximise profits had led many to cease as deer parks by the reign of Elizabeth I, as Lambarde's first list testifies.16 The exceptional parks still holding deer were Cooling(24), owned by the Brooke family of Cobham, and, under keepership or crown lessees, Knole(50), Otford Great park(62), and, perhaps, Otford Little park(63) and Saltwood(75).17 Political turmoil also affected private parks, several of which were transferred to the crown after attainders served on traitors. Some of these parks had already been disparked, but new owners disparked others. Sir Henry Sidney, for example, with the grant of Penshurst in 1552 obtained Ashour(69) park, Northlands or Penshurst(71) park (then including Leigh park,70) and Southpark(72), after they had lain in royal hands since the attainder imposed on Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham, executed by Henry VIII in 1521.18 Penshurst(71) park, adjacent to 12 Boxley(14a), CPR c.66/1010 no.1047, p.213, 23/2/1563; Canterbury Old(19) Park, Morice (Camden Society IX, 1859); Canterbury Trenley(20), Hasted 9(1797:158); Westwell(98), Hasted 7 (1797:416); Elham(30), Hasted 8 (1797:99); Folkestone(32), TNA SC 6/HenVIII/1727 7 1758. 13 CMS DRc/T166A, 1533/4. 14 Chislet(22) park, LPL TA39/1, no deer since 1541; Curlswood(26) park, LPL TA633/1, 1586 'once used as a park for deer'; Ford(35) park, map fragment, 1624, shows deer (Arch.Cant.

Cage(88) and Postern(92) parks had been disparked by the time Lambarde compiled his first list, but Northfrith(89-91) and Southfrith(93) survived longer into Elizabeth I's reign.22 Lastly, in Mary I's reign, after the major failed rising of 1554 in Kent led by Sir Thomas Wyatt, the crown gained other attainted land. Allington((2) and Boxley(14a) parks were seized from Sir Thomas Wyatt himself. Allington was on Lambarde's list of disparkments, but Boxley(14a) was omitted, having been disparked by the abbot at an unknown date.23 The status of Sir Thomas Wyatt's new Lea park(14b) at Boxley, which he attempted to create in 1549, is unknown, but it seems to have been short-lived judging by disputes over the identities of the two parks at Boxley later in Elizabeth I's reign.24 A defunct park at Broxham(17) was seized from William Cromer.25 Lastly, Sir Henry Isley's involvement and subsequent beheading lost the family Brasted(15) and Sundridge(83) parks, both of which had been divided into fields by 1553, a park at 19 The exact sequence of events unknown, see Park profiles p.351. 20 Astor(1979:10) 1538, Henry took over Hever(46) as widower succeeding to his wife's estate, but compensated Anne Boleyn's siblings; CKS U1450/T5/62, 1541, Henry VIII acquired Henden(45) after an enforced exchange of land between himself and William Stafford, husband of Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister; CKS U1450/T6/10, 1560 lease of park for cony warren, deer house to be kept in good repair, but no mention of actual deer. 21 Surrey Record Office (Hoskins papers) leases from 1540 contain no evidence that deer were in the park (excerpts from Lionel Cole); BL Harl.Cart. 86.G.54,H.16,H.53, grants of park land make no mention of pales or internal character of the park. 22 Thirsk in Zell(2000:87-88); Chalklin(2004:95-104). 23 CCA DCB-J/X.10.17. 24 Zell(2000:32) 1549, hedges of Wyatt's new park at Boxley(14b) were torn down. 25 Lambarde(1576:6-7). 14 Langley(52) near Maidstone, which was disparked by 1576, and Sutton Valence(86) park, which was disparked when John Leland passed by in Henry VIII's reign.26 Although in 1555 the four parks were restored to Sir Henry Isley's son on payment of a fine of £1000, he fell into arrears and all his lands were returned to the crown in 1575.27 By implication, Lambarde attributed the loss of active deer parks to economic pressure, and some parks might well have lost their deer and undergone further steps towards total disparkment prior to seizure by the crown, perhaps due to financial pressure, family decline, or the different priorities of their owners. However, in the case of disparkment 'within memorie', it can hardly be coincidence that the successful deer parks in Lambarde's lists had not been directly affected by political instability, while 15 of the 18 disparked parks on the 1576 list were those that had undergone enforced disruption of ownership during the religious and political crises of the period.28 Change of ownership would not automatically lead to disparkment, but abrupt interruption in park ownership and management accelerated conversion of parkland to farmland or woodland. Turbulent upheavals made park restoration more difficult and previous disparkment more entrenched, and for crown-leased parks the incentive to reintroduce deer was further diminished or restricted by existing subleases.29 Disparkment in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I will be covered more fully in Chapter Five, but in the meantime Lambarde accurately identified an accelerating rate of disparkment prior to the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent', but did not note a deceleration in the early years of Elizabeth I's reign. 30 To compound this lack of refinement of period, by not revising his text in the second edition of 1596, he has left the reader with the impression that the rate of loss continued throughout Elizabeth I's reign. This was not the case, because when comparing his lists with the parks depicted 26 CKS U1450/E19, 1553, Brasted(15) and Sundridge(83) parks divided into fields; Chandler VIII (1993:88) prior to 1546, 'This elder Clifford hath yet a maner by Boxle caullid Sutton Valaunce where was a park.' 27 Steinman Steinman(1851:40) 8 March 1 & 2 Philip and Mary deed of restoration; CKS U1590/T14/17, 1575, his debts were about £10000 in several bonds, so his property was seized for a fair distribution of the proceeds. 28 The three exceptions are Mereworth(60) (misspelt at Merewood in 1576) and two parks at Oxenhoath(65,66) about which information is lacking. 29 See Chapter Five, pp.150-153, Chapter Six pp.173-174. 30 See Chapter Five (ii) p.140 onwards, and Figure 5.1 (Appendix 5 pp.317-318). 15 on contemporary maps, it will be seen that the rate of disparkment continued to slow down in the 20 years that followed the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent.'. The deer parks that remained at the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign were for the most part retained for several more decades, with a handful of new parks being created to balance the number that were lost. (ii) William Lambarde, the historian and topographer 'A Perambulation of Kent' was recognised as the pioneering county history even in its own time. In the opening pages Lambarde outlined the greater part of his interest in the section entitled 'The description and hystorie of the shyre of Kent.' Most of its contents lie outside the bounds of this study; but among 'such other things incident to the whole' Lambarde stated that he finally wanted to cover the hills and dales, parks and forests.31 In doing so he has provided the historian with the earliest printed list of parks, both extant and extinct, within any county. Before examining this and the later list of 1596 in detail it is necessary to establish their credibility, by judging the soundness of Lambarde's method and the degree of accuracy in his research. His contemporary William Camden, author of 'Britain' considered him 'a man right well endowed with excellent learning.' 32 When writing his history of Kent, Camden thought Lambarde 'has withal been so happy in his searches; that he has left very little for those that come after him.' 33 Lambarde's training as a lawyer gave him a disciplined approach to study, and indicative of his enquiring mind and scholarship was his mastery of Anglo-Saxon language and law displayed in 'Archaionomia' published in 1568. By that time he had also been working on the manuscript of the 'Alphabetical Description of the Chief Places of England and Wales', the bulk of which he and many of his friends had drawn from old chronicles and ancient histories.34 Lambarde's academic and scholarly approach has been considered meticulous for its time.35 According to Mendyk, 'He selected evidence intelligently 31 Lambarde(1576:6-7). 32 Camden(1610); Read(1962:7) citing Camden's dedicatory letter in the first edition of 'Eirenarcha'. 33 Mendyk(1986:476). 34 Lambarde(1596,foreword). 35 Read(1962:6); Warnicke(1973:2-27). 16 from the raw substance of his sources, and evaluated it in accordance with sound principles. Objective truth, not legend, was his goal.'36 Concerning methodology, Lambarde himself stated that to compile 'A Perambulation of Kent' he had studied credible records, and then added information partly from his own knowledge, and partly from that gleaned from other men. 37 However, details are hard to come by. He drew on his 'Alphabetical Description of the Chief Places of England and Wales' for what he referred to as his 'Topographicall Dictionarie' (later to become 'A Perambulation of Kent'), and for which he enlarged the history and topography of that county.38 His written sources have been analysed, but it is doubtful whether substantive documentary evidence on parks was available to him and, in any case, it would have been of limited use since it would scarcely have touched the contemporary position.39 When approaching the compilation of the section 'The Particular of Kent', in which the list of parks appeared, Lambarde would have had to rely largely, if not entirely, on his own and others’ knowledge of the Kentish countryside. Indeed, he admitted as much when he wrote an apology concerning information he or others had gathered:- If either by want of memorie I have not taken all, or by too much credulitie have mistaken any: I have pardon for it, and desire the Reader, either to correct or supplie it, by his own discretion and judgement.40 He might have written systematically to landowners about their parks, but surviving correspondence is scattered. Some letters written to Archbishop Matthew Parker relating to 'A Perambulation of Kent' showed that he was prepared to alter and amend in deference to those with specialist knowledge as part of his meticulous attention to detail. 41 That he kept notes, as he did for 'Ephemeris' related to his work as Justice 36 Mendyk(1986:471). 37 Lambarde(1576:59). 38 Warnicke(1973:26-27). 39 Flower(1935:47-48); Warnicke(1973:27-30) documents relating to ecclesiastical land might have been seen through the patronage of Dr. Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury. 40 Lambarde(1576:9) reference to his methodology and the apology were added before the final publication and do not appear in the manuscript copy of 1570 which he had prepared for circulation beforehand (BL Add.Mss.20033). 41 Bruce & Perowne(1853:424-426) cited with references to other letters in Alsop, 'Lambarde, William 1536-1601 (http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15921); StaffsRO D593/S/4/14/16-18, letters between Sir John Leveson and Lambarde; Dunkel(1965:46-48). 17 of the Peace, is shown by one surviving manuscript.42 Entitled 'Note of the names of the gentry in Kent, 1574', this was a working list which could be amended until the manuscript was despatched to the printers.43 It is apparent that the list of parks was compiled in a similar way. It was laid out in two columns in neither alphabetical, ownership nor locational order, rather the names were written at random as they became known to him, despite Lambarde’s emphasis on an ordered approach in the rest of the book.44 In these circumstances the degree of accuracy needs to be assessed. Warnicke considered that Lambarde often travelled throughout Kent and knew it well, because 'A Perambulation of Kent' contained many of his personal observations.45 But although he was soon to become embedded in the county, he hardly had time before the late 1560s to know it as intimately as many of the wellestablished Kentish gentry who would be his readers. His father, John Lambarde, a very successful London draper who had risen to be sheriff of London, purchased several properties, the last being that of the Kentish manor of Westcombe in Greenwich in 1553, shortly before his death the following year. William Lambarde was only eighteen at the time, but eventually inherited Westcombe, along with other properties in Herefordshire, Wiltshire and London, when he came of age in 1557. While John Lambarde had acquired properties haphazardly, his son concentrated his estate in London and Kent, adding to the Kent holding, but selling off the holdings in other counties. However, he remained resident at Lincoln's Inn until called to the Bar in 1567, and leased out Westcombe.46 The rest of his life demonstrated how fond he was of Kent, and Adrian believes that he was partly motivated to write 'A Perambulation of Kent' as a means to win acceptance into society 42 Read(1962:15-52). 43 Folger MS. X d.260, Folger Shakespeare Library. I am grateful to Georgianna Ziegler of the Folger Institute for this reference. This list differed slightly from that which was later published. 44 Adrian(2006:306-334) this article deals with the high degree of order in 'A Perambulation of Kent' and the importance it placed on political order and stability. However, \"Here creating order is not about reducing everything to 'universal unanimities' or sameness. Instead Lambarde allows for differentiation and distinctiveness (even disagreement) so long as they do not erupt into any kind of disorderly threat,\" p.330. 45 Warnicke(1973:30) also for other biographical details. 46 Ibid. p.10. 18 there, 'by demonstrating his intimate knowledge of and mastery over the topography and history of the county.'47 If this was his intention, he was eminently successful because in his commendation of the book Thomas Wotton of Boughton Malherbe could not have endorsed William Lambarde more strongly:- We should unto the author William Lambard, yeeld our very harty and perpetuall thanks: as our Country man in our wordes and deedes lovingly use him: as a man learned, duly esteeme him .... which for my part, I thinke meete to do, and meane to do: and for your parts, I desire hartily you should do, and I hope assuredly you will do.48 Lambarde stated on the title page that 'A Perambulation of Kent' had been collected and written (for the most part) in 1570.49 From 1568 he had been given wider opportunity to gather material while undertaking his new duties as a Commissioner of Sewers from Lombarde's Wall to Gravesend Bridge.50 This exacting job, giving control over important waterways, would have involved travelling around the countryside with fellow commissioners such as William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, and William Brooke, lord Cobham. Moving about the county in such company enabled him not only to make his own observations about Kent, but also to meet influential men from whom he could extract and exchange information. In 1570, at the age of 34, he married Jane Multon, whose father, George Multon, owned the St. Clere estate in Kemsing, northeast of Sevenoaks, and his social network among the Kentish gentry grew even wider. He was reticent in widely publicising the manuscript until it had been thoroughly scrutinised and it was from St. Clere that he wrote his letter to Thomas Wotton, on the last day of January 1570, requesting him to read the draft of his book. He chose Thomas Wotton because of the 'good understanding and interest' he had in the county, and hoped that he 'for good will indifferently would, weigh and peruse it.'51 His reticence was further reflected in Archbishop Matthew Parker's letter of May 1573, which was sent with a copy of the manuscript to William Cecil, lord Burghley, prior to Elizabeth I's progress round Kent, 47 Adrian (2006:311). 48 Lambarde(1576:7-8) Wotton's foreward. 49 Ibid. title page. 50 Warnicke(1973:36). 51 Lambarde(1596:foreword). 19 'who would be inquisitive concerning the places where she journeyed.' 52 In it the archbishop requested Lord Burghley not to discuss the manuscript in public so that the author's friends might have time 'to peruse, to correct, and amend.'53 By the 1580s Lambarde had become well integrated into the county. He had become a Justice of the Peace in 1580. He lived in St. Clere until 1583, before moving to Halling for his second marriage, where he lived as close neighbour to Sir John Leveson and Lord Cobham until his third marriage in 1592. Finally, he ended his days in 1601, resident at Westcombe.54 Thus, when he came to prepare the second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' for publication in 1596, he should have been in an even better position to make any necessary alterations to the park list. Detailed examination of the lists indicates that Lambarde's 1576 park list is fairly accurate, especially when the difficulties of communication and travel during the late Tudor period are taken into consideration. The second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' in 1596 was largely a re-print, and that might go some way to explain the limited number of changes made in the 1596 list. However, Lambarde must have made some checks, although not as thorough as they might have been. He failed to add park omissions or to clarify ambiguities in the first list, or to take note of new park creations in the intervening 20 years, so to that extent the 1596 list is less reliable than its predecessor. (iii) William Lambarde's list of parks The park lists were given quite a high priority in the order of 'A Perambulation of Kent.' In the section of the book headed 'The Particular of Kent' the lists of parks appeared preceding lists of hills, rivers, bridges, cities, markets and fairs, castles, honourable houses, almshouses, former religious houses and schools. The significance of this position might have been because the subject was close to the interests of his readers, 'his Countriemen, the Gentlemen of the Countie of Kent', as Thomas Wotton 52 Nichols(reprint of 1823 edition:341). 53 Dunkel(1965:46-47). 54 Alsop, Lambarde, William 1536-1601 (http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15921). 20 addressed them in his foreword, or perhaps because parks merited priority as a widespread and dominant feature in the rural landscape.'55 In the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' the list comprised 52 parks with 54 in the second edition of 1596. Tracing the parks on the modern Ordnance Survey maps proved to be relatively straightforward. Some parks, such as Cobham(23), Greenwich(39), Groombridge(40), Knole(50), Leeds(54), Lullingstone(55) and Penshurst(71) are still in evidence today. Others were easily located on a variety of maps and in documentary records, but two proved very elusive and some raised ambiguities.56 Stonehurst(81) was just over the border into Surrey, in the southeast angle between the Sussex and Kent boundaries with that county, but its inclusion was probably because of its ownership by the Brooke family of Starborough Castle (a branch of the Brooke family of Cobham).57 Hamswell has not been tracked down. There was a ‘Hamwell’ in Kent, about one mile east of Eastry (now the hamlet of Hammill), but there is nothing to indicate there was ever a park there. It is possible that Lambarde meant Hamsell park(43), in Rotherfield, Sussex. This was owned by the Waller family of Groombridge, who also owned Groombridge park(40), straddling the boundary between Kent and Sussex. Rotherfield is hardly county border country, but it is possible that confusion arose once again because Hamsell(43) park was owned by a Kent based family. There is ambiguity over Langley and Southpark because two parks of each name have been found. Both Langley parks are poorly documented, but Langley(52) park near Maidstone, held from the crown, was more likely to have been disparked by this period, which is as Lambarde recorded, while Langley park(51) in Beckenham was probably established in late Elizabethan times and continued into the seventeenth century.58 Southpark followed Ashour park(69) at Penshurst in the list, both owned by the Sidney family. However, evidence points to this Southpark(72) being disparked by 1570, and the listed Southpark was not so denoted.59 It is certain, therefore, that South 55 Lambarde(1576) first page of Wotton's foreward. 56 See Park profiles p.351 onwards; tithe maps, c.1870 OS 6\" mile series, were invaluable. 57 OS TQ425412. 58 Documentary evidence on both is sparse. See Hasted 5 (1797:346-349) for Langley, near Maidstone; Tookey(1975:9) land purchased in Hayes and West Wickham in 1571 became part of the later Langley Park; Arch.Cant. III (1860:191-193) 16/2/1633, letter mentioned the park. 59 CKS U1475/E55/1, 1559. 21 park(12) near Boughton Malherbe, which was repaled and restocked by Thomas Wotton in 1567, was meant.60 A mistake over this park would seem to have been highly unlikely given that Thomas Wotton had been sent Lambarde's manuscript to check. However, there is a discrepancy over Thomas Wotton's parks because he had three parks at Boughton Malherbe, South park(12), New or Lenham park(11), and Bocton or Old park(10), the last two being absent from Lambardes's lists.61 New or Lenham park(11) was impaled by Sir Edward Wotton (1489-1551), but was under arable cultivation by 1567. Many deer, but perhaps not the whole herd, were rounded up from the Old park(10) and removed to South park(12) in December 1567. The omission of two such recently functioning parks is inexplicable, unless for some reason it was with the acquiescence of Thomas Wotton himself. Lambarde made unusual selections in two names, St. Augustine's(18) and Calehill(98). Evidence points to St. Augustine's(18) being the park in Canterbury, usually called Canterbury, New or King's park(18), created by Henry VIII in the 1540s on former monastic land belonging to St. Augustine's monastery, Canterbury. Mary I granted the park 'commonly called Canterbury park' among other properties, to Cardinal Pole in 1556, and it would seem that it was only called St.Augustine's park for the short period of his ownership until his death in 1558, when his executors called it ‘St. Augustine's.'62 Thereafter, it is referred to under its other names, so why Lambarde picked out the monastic name is unclear. Apart from Lambarde's lists there are no other references to Calehill park(98) in the parish of Little Chart until 'The Olde Parke' and 'Parke woode' are shown on an estate map of the Darell family in 1639.63 It is possible that Lambarde was referring to this park, but if so he omitted the well documented medieval park of Westwell(98), three miles to the east of Calehill, which continued with deer in it under crown lessees at least into Elizabeth I's reign.64 The park 'at Ashford' is enigmatic. Edward Hasted linked the reference 'at Ashford' to Ripton(later park 104) park, but the earliest date for the park so far concerns 60 BL Add.Mss.42715. 61 Ibid. 62 CKS U1450/T6/28, copy of CPR 2 & 3 Philip and Mary, 13/3/1556; Dasent I (1893) Acts of Privy Council no.25, 9/12/1558. 63 CKS U386/P1. 64 Brigstocke Sheppard(1889:384) 1292 earliest date for Westwell(98); BL Add.Mss.42715, 1561, deer from Westwell mentioned. 22 its imparkment in about 1640.65 It is more likely that Lambarde was referring to the park at Scot's Hall(77), near Smeeth, to the east of Ashford, owned by Sir Thomas Scott, high sheriff of Kent, who had the wealth and status to sustain a park and lived in grand style, entertaining Elizabeth I at his home in 1573.66 A second park at Westenhanger(96,97) was the only active park added by Lambarde in 1596, otherwise he made a note of five additional disparkments, and corrected a misspelling.67 In the first edition there were 18 disparked parks, and in the second edition of 1596 there were 23. The additional five were the disparked Aldington park(1), omitted from the 1576 list, and four new disparkments, namely at Halden(41), one Otford park(?63), Saltwood(75) and Shurland(78). The total number of disparkments represented about one-third of William Lambarde's 1576 list, and a little over one-third of the later list, but his choice of parks to include in this category was not consistent. In the first edition some Elizabethan disparkments were not recorded by him, for example, one or two of Edward Wotton's parks at Boughton Malberbe(10,11).68 Other disparkments 'within memorie' William Lambarde might have listed were Sir Thomas Wyatt's parks at Maidstone(59) in which deer were last mentioned in 1556 and Boxley(14a) disparked by 1554.69 The archbishop of Canterbury's parks at Chislet(22) had not held deer since 1541 and Curlswood(26) had also been disparked.70 Brasted(15) and Sundridge(83) parks had both had been disparked by Mary I's reign, which Lambarde recorded in the case of Brasted(15), but not in the case of Sundridge(83).71 As most disparkments occurred before Elizabeth I came to the throne, the omissions are not critical in determining the number of deer parks which continued to function in her reign. The question next to be addressed is how complete a list of active parks did Lambarde compile and to do this the five contemporary maps will be discussed, 65 Hasted 7 (1797:534) 'There was formerly a park here, which was in being when Lambarde wrote his Perambulation, in 1570. The lands of it are still called the Old Park'; CKS U1095/P3, 24/12/1640, 'A plott of Ripton Parke... as it lay in severall closes before it was Imparked.' 66 Scott(1876:196,203-204); Cole(1999,186); Cockburn(1995) AC/35/40/3/2545,1597. 67 Lambarde made seven adjustments to the 1576 list in 1596, see Figure 1.1 p.9. 68 Boughton Malherbe(10,11) see p.24 following. 69 Boxley(14a) see p.13 above; CKS U1450 T6/28, 1556, Maidstone(59) park; TNA E134/31Elizabeth/ Hilary16, 1588, disparkment occurred by 1554. 70 Chislet(22) park, LPL TA39/1, 1587, no deer since 1541; Curlswood(26) park, LPL TA633/1, 1586 'once used as a park for deer'. 71 CKS U1450/E19, 1553, Sir Henry Isley's parks then divided into fields. 23 although only the first three were produced during the period spanning the first and second editions of 'A Perambulation of Kent.' (iv) William Lambarde and the cartographers The five county maps depicting parks are conveniently spaced to cover most of the period under review.72 Contemporary with the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent', with its list of 34 active and 18 disparked parks, were the maps of Saxton c.1575 and of an unknown cartographer c.1576. Saxton showed 27 parks, three more than the anonymous map, which depicted 24.73 Lambarde's second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent', with its list of 31 active parks and 23 disparked parks, was contemporaneous with Symonson's 1596 map, with 31 parks. In James I's reign came Norden's map of 1605 with 27 parks and Speed's of 1611 with 29.74 One notable feature of the maps was that none of Lambarde's disparked parks in the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' appeared on the maps, the inference being that the cartographers were attempting to record only existing deer parks. Corroborating evidence shows that to this extent the maps are accurate, with the exception of a park at Sarre, included by Norden, where no park has so far been detected, although it is possible that a short-lived park was set up there in the early seventeenth century. In the maps the park symbols are larger than would be the case in true scale, so the exact location of parks can be distorted. Some parks were clearly labelled, and others were easy to interpret because only one park was associated with the area, for example, Cooling(24) on the Hoo peninsula or Shurland(78) on the Isle of Sheppey. Others presented greater difficulty because they were not labelled, and the situation was especially confused to the south and east of Leeds castle around Boughton Malherbe, and in the Lyminge/Stowting area. 72 See Figure 1.2 (Appendix 1, pp.306-307) for Lambarde's lists of 1576 and 1596, alongside the 5 early county maps. A copy of the map of the unknown cartographer had been inserted at an unknown date into a copy of 'A Perambulation of Kent' of 1576, signed and dated by Peter Manwood of St. Stephen's, Canterbury, in January 1590. Although controversy has raged about whether this was the intended 'Carde of this Shyre'referred to by Lambarde, the watermark on the paper was found to be of the same period as that of the book and the map bore the arms of Elizabeth I, so barring forgery it has been included in this examination of parks. This book is at CKS with notes on the back page by G. P. Amos Pembroke on the authenticity of the watermark. Pembroke bought this copy in 1885 from the sale of the library of the Earl of Jersey at Osterley park. See Box(1926:89-95) and Livett(1937:247-277). 73 The additional three parks are Halden(21), Scot's Hall(7), Westenhanger(96). 74 Speed's additional parks are Glassenbury(37), Halden(41), Throwley(87), Well Hall, Eltham(95). 24 The two county maps from the 1570s showed two parks in the vicinity of Boughton Malherbe.75 A park near Ulcombe might have represented South park(12), while another at Boughton Malherbe was probably Bocton Old park(10). On the three later maps only one park was shown, which was more likely to have been Lambarde's South park(12).76 Compared with Lambarde, who listed Postling park(73) but not Lyminge(56), all the maps showed an unlabelled park at nearby Lyminge(56) rather than at Postling(73). This leaves a quandary, because there was or had been a park both at Postling(73) and at Lyminge(56). It is possible that Lambarde confused Postling(73) for neighbouring Lyminge(56). Henry VIII appointed deer keepers at Lyminge(56) in the 1540s and there was a case of unlawful hunting and stealing deer in Lyminge(56) park in 1606.77 According to Lambarde, Postling(73) was still an active park, although a tithe dispute in 1576 indicates that the park had been disparked.78 Given the positive evidence of deer in Lyminge(56) park, it is most likely that the maps represented Lyminge(56), so it appears that Lambarde should have included Lyminge(56), although he was correct about the presence of a park, albeit disparked, at Postling(73). The maps located six parks that were absent from Lambarde's lists. Four parks (at Bromley(16), Eastwell(28), Lynsted(58) and Throwley,87) were late creations, three of uncertain date, which appeared on the three later maps.79 A licence to impark 1000 acres at Eastwell had been given in 1589, so the park was overlooked by Lambarde, but evidence on the other three is less clear-cut.80 Two other inexplicable omissions from his list were parks at Ford(35) and Hemsted(44). All five maps depicted the archbishop of Canterbury's park at Ford(35).81 Although Lambarde might have been less familiar with east Kent, it is unclear why he was not told about it by Archbishop Matthew Parker, especially as Ford Palace with its park(35) was one of the few estates retained after the forced land exchanges of Henry VIII's reign.82 75 Saxton 1575, anonymous map c.1576. 76 Symonson 1596, Norden 1605, Speed 1611; BL Add.Mss.42715, for Boughton Malherbe. 77 Zell(2000:60) citing Letter Patent XVI, 1500, p.714; CKS QM/SB 710, 2/10/1606. 78 CCA DCB-J/X.10.16 f.209-210, 1576. 79 Firm evidence is lacking, but implication of late creation is in TNA SP12/136/33 for Bromley(16); Vallance(1932:147) Lynsted(58); apart from the early Kent county maps there is no clear evidence for the date of Throwley(87) park. 80 Physick(1973:128) licence to enclose 1000 acres of parkland granted in June 1589. 81 Arch.Cant. XLV (1933:168) c.1624, map of Ford park with deer. 82 Du Boulay(1952:19-36); Morice(1859:267); Du Boulay(1966:317-329). 25 Another omission by Lambarde was of Hemsted(44) park, which was shown on Saxton's and Norden's maps, at both ends of the time scale. The park was functioning when Sir John Guldeford wrote his will in 1560; Elizabeth I stayed at Hemsted during her progress in 1573, and a map of 1599 shows a park of 113 acres.83 It is unclear why Lambarde left this park out, except to add weight to the possibility that his contacts were not as extensive towards the south and east of the county. Lambarde and the cartographers faced the difficulty of ascertaining exactly which parks were functioning as deer parks at any given time because of the possibility of total or partial disparkment, re-imparkment and new imparkment. The fluctuating fortunes of Halden(41) and Shurland(78) parks bear this out. While Lambarde added Halden(41) to disparkments in the second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent', the park appeared on Symonson's and Speed's maps, yet this might not be inconsistent with the evidence. Halden(41) was seized by the crown from John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, in 1553 and put into the hands of Sir John Baker of Sissinghurst, when no deer were in it, because in 1571, after Elizabeth I had recognised the Sidney claim to the Dudley estates, Halden(41) park was completely repaled.84 When deer were reintroduced is unknown, but a survey of 16 August 1609 confirmed that deer were in the park, although in the following year the deer had gone.85 . A similar difficulty with achieving complete accuracy is illustrated by the park at Shurland(78). Lambarde added Shurland(78) to disparkments in the second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent', and the maps of 1596, 1605 and 1611 also disregarded Shurland(78), which might be seen as confirmation of the situation, but other evidence suggests that the status of Shurland(78) was not quite so clear cut. There were about 220 deer in a park in 1572, yet by October 1574, only 40 deer remained, and it would appear that the park was not restocked.86 Lack of deer would justify Lambarde's disparkment and the park's omission from the later maps, and no deer were mentioned in a survey of mid-January 1605. However, within a year Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery, instigated a suit of deer stealing, claiming that the ancient park had 83 ESRO DAP Box 32, will of 4/5/1560; Cole(1999:179-201) Appendix 2; SuffRO HA43/T501/242. 84 Bowen(1939:23); Sir Henry Sidney married Mary Dudley, daughter of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, and Jane Guldeford, whose family held Halden; CKS U1475 E23/2. 85 CKS U1475/M73; CKS U1475/T92. 86 TNA SP12/87/1-3, 15/5/1572; TNA SP12/908/29, 7/10/1574. 26 always held deer.87 While he might have exaggerated the continuity and extent of deer keeping, the defendants did not dispute his statement that deer had been there 'whereof memory of man is not to be contrary', even though it would have been in their interest to do so. The only active parks in Lambarde's list not appearing on the maps were Hamswell(43) and Stonehurst(81), which is not surprising if they lay outside the county.88 Ashour park(69) was not on the maps, neither was it added to Lambarde's disparkments, but it was being leased out by the Sidney family from the 1550s and gradually lost its status as a park, so Lambarde's inclusion of Ashour(69) might well have represented its last days as a park, and its omission from the maps the recognition that its original function had been lost.89 There was a significant degree of correlation between Lambarde and the early mapmakers, with 12 parks being in all sources and a further six being in five out of the six. However, none of the compilations was identical.90 Some discrepancies might be attributed to the four decades separating the earliest map from the latest – each illustrating changes over time, but when matched with the documentary evidence it is also clear that none was comprehensive. The most prominent parks in which deer were present some time between 1558 and 1611, but which do not appear in 'A Perambulation of Kent' or the five county maps, were Bore Place(9), Lee(53), Tyler Hill(94) in Canterbury and West Wickham(99).91 Boughton Monchelsea(13), Roydon(74), Scotney(76) and Well Hall(95) in Eltham were established as parks, but the presence of deer remains unproven.92 Licence to impark 500 acres at East Wickham(29) and Bexley was granted to Sir Oyliffe Leigh in 1610, but evidence of park creation is lacking for Chilham(21a), Mersham Hatch(61), and Surrenden(84) which were probably formed later in James I's reign.93 87 TNA E178/3925; TNA STAC8/183/34. 88 See p.20 above. 89 CKS U1475/T33, leases of 1553,1572,1574; Straker(1931:219). 90 See Figure 1.2 'Lambarde's list and 5 early maps compared' (Appendix 1 pp.306-307). 91 CKS QM/SB/122, 1596, Bore Place(9); Drake(1886:192-193) Lee(53) park; CKS U591 C261/5, 1599/1600, Tyler Hill(94); BL Add Mss.33899, 1558,1564, West Wickham(99). 92 CKS U807/M1, 1556, Boughton Monchelsea(13); CKS U48/P1, 1590, Roydon(74); ESRO DykeHamilton 606, 1579, CKS U1776/P1, 1619, Scotney(76); TNA E164/44, 1605, Well Hall(95). 93 TNA SP14/58/19, East Wickham(29); Heron(1791:68-69) 1623, Chilham(21a); CKS U274/E5, 1618, Mersham Hatch(61); CKS U350/E4, 1625, Surrenden(84). 27 Conclusion Lambarde's first list of 52 parks contained two parks wrongly located within Kent, three ambiguities over parks at Langley(51, 52), Southpark(12, 72) and at Ashford(77), and two enigmatic names: St. Augustine's(18) and Calehill(98). The other 45 entries have been found to be accurate, so that overall the list has a high degree of reliability. It is, however, not comprehensive with at least three omissions of active parks at Ford(35), Hemsted(44) and Lyminge(56). A number of disparkments might have been included for consistency, although dates of disparkment in some cases are unknown. Except for the addition of a second park at Westenhanger(96,97) and a disparked park at Aldington(1) in 1596, and altering 'Merewood' for 'Mereworth'(60) errors of commission or omission remained uncorrected in the second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent', so the degree of overall error in the later list is greater. However, Lambarde's lists remain an invaluable resource to historians, enabling them not only to identify Elizabethan parks, but also to differentiate the parks containing deer from those that did not. The range from 24 parks shown on the anonymous map to 34 (excluding disparkments) listed in the first edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' is probably not too far out at any given time. The aggregate number of active deer parks over the period 1576 to 1611 from Lambarde's first list and from the five cartographers is 46, including 'at Ashford'(77), Hamsell(43) (?Sussex), Stonehurst(81) (Surrey) and Starborough(80) (on the Kent/Surrey border). This total of active parks rises to 53 with the addition of deer parks mentioned in other sources. Deer are mentioned in documentary evidence for 33 parks.94 Whether the other 20 parks actually contained deer is debatable, because they could have functioned as open parkland, perhaps with stock grazing or rabbit warrens. However, nine parks named by Lambarde, but for which no supportive documentary evidence has been found, have been included because Lambarde distinguished active parks from the disparked by defining the former as those containing deer.95 Additionally, a further eight of the 38 parks shown on the five contemporary county 94 See Figure 1.3 (Appendix 2 pp.308-309) 'Active Elizabethan and Jacobean Deer Parks', and Park profiles p.351 onwards for the sources of evidence for individual parks. 95 Lambarde(1576:9); see Figure 1.3(Appendix 2 pp.308-308) - there is documentary evidence for deer in all but six of Lambarde's list – hence the addition of those six as active parks. 28 maps have been added on the basis that, because the maps omitted all the disparkments noted by Lambarde and by other sources, a very strong assumption can be made that they depicted active parks, especially as the maps were produced to attract influential, powerful purchasers – the owners of such parks.96 A further three new parks, Chilham(21a), Mersham Hatch(61) and Somerhill(93b) complete the total of 53.97 Additionally, there is a strong likelihood, but no substantive verification, that Boughton Monchelsea(13), Great Chart(38), Halstead(42), Roydon(74) and Scotney(76) were active parks in this period.98 The number of parks was never stable because some parks did not have deer in them for the whole period; some were disparked in the course of the period; while others were new creations.99 With evidence of the existence of 100 extant and extinct parks in documents from 1558 to 1625, including 53 known active parks, Lambarde's estimation that half the deer parks had been disparked was on target. However, in not fully updating his list or amending his text, the second edition of 'A Perambulation of Kent' failed to reflect the deceleration of disparkment in the later decades of the sixteenth century, although his lists and the five maps confirm this trend. 96 See Prince(2008:9-11) for a fuller argument about the nature of the parks that would be depicted on maps. 97 CKS U38/T1 part 2, 1622, manor house of Somerhill(93b) with park. 98 CKS U807/M1, 1556, Boughton Monchelsea(13); CKS QM/SR1/m.6d, 1605, Great Chart(38); TNA E178/6020, 1621, Halstead(42); CKS U48/P1, 1590, Roydon(74); ESRO Dyke-Hamilton 606, 1579, CKS U1776/P1, 1619, Scotney(76); TNA E164/44, 1605, Well Hall(95). 99 See Figure 1.4 'All known parks in Kent' (Appendix 3 pp.310-315), and Map 1.1 (Appendix 4 p.316) for the names and locations of these 100 parks.

Gathering even basic information for these aspects has been not been easy because there is no corpus of park-related material. Evidence has emerged haphazardly from a wide range of sources and tends to be fragmentary in nature, but despite these inadequacies, the characteristics of Kentish parks can be portrayed, if somewhat sketchily at times. Another obstacle has been the lack of countywide research into the Kentish parks before the Elizabethan period, which would have given a useful basis of comparison. Conversely, although research from other counties, such as Hertfordshire, Derbyshire, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire with Huntingdonshire, and Suffolk has been done, it offers little comparative material for the period from 1558 to 1625.1 Lambarde's lists have provided a starting point for the names of parks, and the five contemporary maps give a vivid visual representation of their distribution as perceived by Elizabethan and early Jacobean cartographers. However, the survey here undertaken includes all Kentish parks, whether or not disparked, for which references have been found from the eleventh century to 1660. Research, both general and countybased, into medieval parks beyond Kent, has proved invaluable in providing comparative material for factors influencing distribution, density and longevity. It has also suggested guidelines to follow. Documentary evidence has provided data about the size of over 60 Kentish parks. In addition, about 20 pre-1660 estate maps, of variable usefulness, show park boundaries and occasionally depict internal structure. The sites of over 40 parks have been visited in an attempt to ascertain the route and survival of boundary earthworks and other features, and local historians have provided field-work 1 County studies of medieval parks include – Liddiard(2007), Rowe(2009), Hertfordshire; Wiltshire & Woore(2009), Derbyshire; Dye(unpublished 1986), Norfolk; Way(1997), Cambridgeshire & Huntingdonshire. Prince(2008) covers Hertfordshire parks since 1500, although only the first 26 pages cover the period 1500-1660; elsewhere the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have been included at the end of more detailed medieval park studies e.g. Way(1997) and Hoppitt(1992). 30 details of a further 11 parks.2 Field visits have covered the geological zones of Kent, and give a spread from its westernmost park, West Wickham(99), to one of the most easterly, that of Canterbury park(18); from Cooling(24) on the fringes of the north coastal marshes to Lympne(57) overlooking Romney marsh, Kent's southernmost promontory. The choice of locations was arbitrary in that several were on private land, which was visited by the kind invitation of the owners; others were selected because they were readily accessible from public footpaths; and yet others because map-work gave a fairly accurate guide to where boundaries might lie within the landscape.3 (i) Distribution and location Elizabethan parks in Kent were largely the legacy of previous generations. With only a handful of parks being set up after 1558, the choice of park location had been established decades or even several centuries earlier, so a detailed analysis of the factors determining the original distribution of parks lies beyond the scope of this study. However, some general comments can be made to indicate factors that might have influenced the earlier park-making process. Map 1.1 showing the distribution of parks in Kent, identifies parks referred to in Elizabethan and Jacobean documents; parks for which no post-1558 references have been found; and parks for which references have been found in Charles I's reign, and for which an earlier existence is suspected, but remains unproven.4 Map 1.1 is as comprehensive as possible, bearing in mind that not all the parks have been located, not all were active at the same time and their longevity varied, some earlier parks might possibly occupy the same location as later ones under a different name, and some parks with the same name occasionally moved sites. Research into the distribution of medieval parks in other counties has shown that several factors, including geology and soil structure, the location of woodland, settlement patterns and strategic sites, were universally applicable.

Broadly speaking Kent can be divided into six geological zones - the Thames estuary and north coastal region, the North Downs, the Greensand Ridge with the vale of Holmesdale, the Low Weald, the High Weald, and Romney marsh. These have been succinctly and graphically outlined by Everitt:- There were, and still are, six Kents, covering a million acres and stretching 70 miles east and west, and of each area this theme (i.e. antiquity) was broadly true; of the Marshland from the Thames past the Swale to Thanet Minster; of the Downland with its southern scarp and winding northwards valleys; of the wooded ragstone hills and Holmesdale; of the Low Weald with its many 'dens'; of the high Weald with its ridge of 'hurst' villages; or again of the Marsh from Stone to New Romney.5 Two of these zones, the Thames estuary with its coastal hinterland and Romney marsh, were virtually devoid of parks. The rich grasslands for sheep grazing on Romney marsh and the north Kent coastal marshland, and the fertility of the loamy soil of the north coast hinterland for agricultural production at very early dates, probably meant that the opportunity for park creation was limited; enclosing land for parks resulting in unacceptable losses both in production and in rental income.6 The exception was the cluster of mainly royal parks to the west of the Darent valley, towards London, where the parks adjacent to the palaces of Greenwich and Eltham were situated.7 Here, having suitable hunting grounds close to the capital would have been of paramount importance to the monarchs and their court, but otherwise there were few parks because the area was well settled and the fertile soil so close to London could be cultivated to supply the capital's food markets. The North Downs also had few parks, even towards London, but more were located towards the eastern end in the upper reaches of the Little Stour valley. The variable nature of the chalk substrate might account for this pattern. To the west the chalk plateau is overlaid with sand and clay drift well suited to various types of agriculture, except where the Downs are capped with clay-with-flints, where woodland 5 Everitt(1966:20). 6 Thirsk in Lawson & Killingray(2004:72-73). 7 See Map 2.1 'Parkland areas of west Kent', p.45 – park areas have been deduced from personal field and map work, and from information kindly supplied by others (see fn. 2 of this chapter). See Park profiles (from p.351) for individual parks. 32 persisted and parks could be sited.8 More potent than geological factors, the distribution of parks in east Kent reflected the former ownership of land by the archbishop of Canterbury where, unlike to the west of the county, several parks were sited on chalk down land despite its suitability for agricultural use. Although the archbishopric owned vast woodlands in the Weald, which might be thought to be more suitable for parks, deer being woodland animals, priority there was given to timber extraction, as will be discussed shortly. The unproductive, shallow soiled, steeply sloping Greensand ridge with its 'chart' names supported a band of parks along its entire length.9 The greater density of parks in the west of the county might reflect the influence of London, but the string of parks continued to run southeast towards Folkestone, with further clusters of parks around Maidstone and southeast of Ashford. It is probable that here lay unexploited or under-exploited land where parks could more easily be carved out of woodland, which in any case was being cleared faster than that of the Weald, especially in the west of the county, because it lay nearer to settlements and to the London market.10 In the Low Weald, parks were more closely grouped to the west of the Medway, with markedly fewer to the east. Pioneering work by Cantor and Hatherly established a close correlation between woodland and parks. 'More significantly, a high woodland cover in the Domesday Book of 1086 was almost always the scene of much subsequent imparkment.'11 Rackham concurred with this observation in general, although he pointed to several anomalies including that of the Weald – the most extensive woodland area of all – which contained only a little above average number of parks and he posed the question 'Did it lack gentry to establish them?'12 The contrasting medieval development of the west and east Weald, as argued by Witney, offers an explanation for the higher number of parks in the west than in the east.13 The Wealden forest had been divided into a complicated system of dens, which 8 Tuson(2007:22). 9 Chart from the Anglo-Saxon 'ceart' meaning a rough common overrun with gorse, broom, bracken (http://dictionary.oed.com). 10 Witney(1976:154-186). 11 Cantor & Hatherly(1979:74-75). 12 Rackham(1986:123). 13 Witney(1976:154-186). 33 became detached parts of the surrounding parishes exploiting woodland resources of timber and autumn pannage for pigs.14 By the mid-thirteenth century the den system was petering out in the western Weald. Lack of water transport routes, coupled with the abundance of woodland on the Greensand hills to the north, made timber extraction from the western Weald unprofitable, so there was little resistance to woodland clearance for settlement. Dens were transformed into subordinate farm-based manors and it became possible for the gentry to take over smaller holdings in order to amass large estates on which to site parks. At the same time the crown established the Clare dynasty at Tonbridge, where the family built Tonbridge castle and extended its territory, the Lowy of Tonbridge, ever more widely to the west. The establishment of the Clares at Tonbridge was further strengthened by the effective withdrawal of the interests of the archbishop of Canterbury. Around Tonbridge, the Clares formed an immense chase by fencing off numerous dens. This chase of 40 square miles comprised two woodland areas separated by the Medway, namely Northfrith(89-91), served with deer from Cage(88) park, and Southfrith(93), supplied with deer from Postern(92) park. Gentry like the Pencestres of Penshurst followed suit with parks of their own. Meanwhile, in the eastern Weald the traditional den system remained robust under the dominating power of ecclesiastical and royal landowners, and park creation was inhibited. In the southeast Weald in particular, woodland lay close to the river Rother and timber could be easily shipped out to the continent. Prices, pushed higher by demand, led landowners like the archbishop of Canterbury to protect their Wealden woodland until a much later date, when it was more difficult for secular gentry to accumulate holdings and therefore to acquire sufficient land for a park.15 Across the High Weald parks were also more widely spread. Although much of the land remained woodland, and the heavy clay and Hastings beds only supported marginal farming dependent on grazing, park creation was limited and came late. For centuries settlement was scattered and isolated by waterlogged roads for several months of the year. It was not an area that attracted magnates, and wealth eluded it until the 14 Pannage = right or privilege to pasture pigs (or other animals) in a forest (http://dictionary.oed.com). 15 Clark(1977:7). 34 advent of cloth making which became well established by the mid-fifteenth century and expanded in the sixteenth century, peaking in about 1560.16 In response to Rackham's query, most parishes in the whole area of the Weald had resident members of the gentry, including newcomers rising from the ranks of successful yeomen, clothiers and merchants.17 The subsidy rolls of the 1520s showed that some clothiers were wealthier than the local landowning gentry, and many acquired 'nouveau' gentlemen status.18 They invested in their industry and in land, but most either did not aspire to parks or had scattered landholdings, which they preferred to lease out.19 Although the geology and soil structure of the six 'Kents' underlay the distribution of parks, it has been indicated that other more complex factors also played their part. This has been found to appertain to other counties as well, with variations reflecting the type of land available, whether woodland, common, waste or cultivated, and settlement and lordship patterns. Early parks in Oxfordshire were carved out of woodland and waste.20 In Derbyshire while early parks were associated with wood pasture, later parks were located on the margins of parishes, often with boundaries coterminous with that of the parish.21 In Northamptonshire parks were sited away from settlement on the edge of cultivated land, but in the north of the county were enclosed out of forest.22 In Berkshire parks were formed from the commons of the Kennet valley in the south, and from the woodland of Windsor forest in the east, both areas with the least productive sandy soils.23 In Suffolk the location of 63% of parks was biased towards the heavy clays of the wooded central area.24 However, the early clearance of woodland in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire meant that 25% of parks were sited on cultivated land, with no emphasis of park creation on lower grade soil.25 In Hertfordshire neither the heavily wooded Chilterns nor the depleted woodland area in 16 Brandon(2003:148,177-181); Zell(1994:12,153). 17 Ibid. p.31. 18 Brandon(2003:151). 19 Zell(1994:32-37). 20 Woodward(1982:4). 21 Wiltshire & Woore(2009:9-12). 22 Steane(1975:212,216-219). 23 Hatherly & Cantor(1979:67). 24 Hoppitt(1992:34-35). 25 Way(1997:29-37). 35 Plate 2.1 Parks sited near Castles a) Leeds Castle encircled by water, and surrounded by parkland in secluded bowl of land in the valley of the Len on the Greensand belt.
