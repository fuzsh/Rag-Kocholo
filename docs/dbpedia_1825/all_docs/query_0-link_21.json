        "text": "A CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION\n\nIsabella, her son Edward, Roger Mortimer and their followers spent Christmas 1326 at Wallingford castle, once the property of Piers Gaveston, earl of Cornwall and more recently the prison of Maurice de Berkeley. Here they were joined by Isabella's younger son John of Eltham and a party of Londoners.1 This was no mere social visit since John Stratford the bishop of Winchester, the newly appointed treasurer, and the earl of Leicester's son-in-law Thomas Wake had already met the mayor and aldermen of London on business ‘touching the king’:2 Edward II, who spent his own Christmas at Kenilworth ‘in great sadness’,3 was the unseen presence at the festivities.\n\nTwo big problems had to be addressed by the gathering at Wallingford. One was Isabella's future relations with her husband. The tone of her reply in February 1326 to the archbishop of Canterbury's plea for her to come home from France suggests that she still had a strong attachment to Edward.4 However, even supposing that she was not actually Roger Mortimer's mistress, she could hardly return to Edward as his wife, for this in itself would imply that Edward still had some status as king and make it almost impossible to remove him from the throne.5 Nonetheless her failure to do so required some public explanation. According to Adam Orleton's later defence of his conduct, composed in 1334, comments about Isabella's failure to visit her husband were already being made at Wallingford, and presumably elsewhere, in December 1326. The question was discussed there by the archbishop of Canterbury,6 the bishops of Winchester and Norwich, the earls of Leicester and Kent, and others and it was decided that in order to protect Isabella's reputation Orleton should deliver a sermon explaining the reasons. This he did, ‘neither adding to nor diminishing what was laid upon me’, stating that Edward's cruelty to Isabella made it impossible for her to return to him.7 Orleton later vigorously defended himself against the charge that he had said that Edward ‘carried a knife in his hose to kill queen Isabella, and that if he had no other weapon he would crush her with his teeth’, admitting only to saying that Edward's anger was increased by Despenser's death.8However, if the Historia Roffensis is to be believed, during the parliament of January 1327 Orleton, with the support of other bishops, did then say that if the queen were to return to the king, he would kill her.9\n\nEven this did not end Isabella's attachment to Edward. Again according to Orleton, in April 1327 Isabella told a council held at Stamford that she was ready and willing to visit her husband but was told firmly by the prelates and magnates present that it was out of the question.10 Although Orleton was abroad at the time, on a mission to Avignon to explain to the pope the recent dramatic events in England,11 his account is generally borne out by the mandate of the archbishop of Canterbury Walter Reynolds to the English bishops on 5 May 1327. Reynolds was anxious to quell the rumours about Isabella's failure to return to her husband, stating that until the kingdom was fully at peace it would be dangerous for her to do so.12 Edward was probably desperate to see both his wife and his children,13 but in the light of the archbishop's mandate Adam Murimuth's claim that Isabella hypocritically refused to see him, while sending Edward delicacies and friendly letters, is not believable.14 It was of course very much in the interests of those who had gained most by Edward's deposition, especially Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, that once in prison he should stay there without any possibility of restoration or reconciliation, but these facts also offer some defence to Mortimer against the charge in 1330 that he ‘falsely and maliciously initiated discord’ between Edward and Isabella.15 If Mortimer did so, he was merely repeating and perhaps exaggerating a commonly held opinion of the time.16\n\nPLANS FOR EDWARD\n\nThe other and even bigger question raised during the Christmas council at Wallingford was what to do with Edward II. Now that he had finally been separated from the Younger Despenser he could in principle have been restored to some semblance of power. But Edward's ability to escape control and to exploit any evidence of disunity among his opponents had been shown too often before. The tensions that may already have existed between Roger Mortimer and Henry of Lancaster and which almost led to a renewal of civil war in 1328–9 would probably have surfaced even sooner if Edward II had been freed from Kenilworth. It is unlikely that anyone during that Christmas at Wallingford ever seriously considered this option.\n\nAlthough Edward II had allegedly already been threatened with deposition both in 1310 and 1321,17 achieving this with some semblance of legality and consent was far more difficult than removing him from the company of his wife. This was an action for which there was no precedent since 1066 and consequently no procedure. According to a late version of Froissart's Chroniques those present at the Wallingford council were each asked whether Edward should be put to death or imprisoned. The first to be asked was Jean de Beaumont, the brother of the count of Hainault and commander of the mercenary troops who had assisted Isabella's invasion, who replied that Edward was king of England and, although he had acted badly, he had done so as the result of bad advice; it was not for Jean or anyone else to condemn Edward to death. He advised that Edward should be put in a castle, with proper regard to his rank, there to live in reasonable comfort for the rest of his life, and in the hope that he would be able to make amends. All those present accepted this advice and Edward was spared death.18 It is improbable that Jean de Beaumont's role was quite as prominent as Froissart later made out, or that there were no voices calling for Edward's execution, but it is clear that everyone agreed on at least one thing: Edward II had to be removed from the throne.\n\nThe first step in detaching Edward's subjects from their allegiance and preparing the way for the act of deposition which followed also formed part of the bishop of Hereford's sermon delivered at Wallingford. Echoing the sermon he had preached at Oxford in October, when he had publicly explained the reasons for the return to England of Isabella and her son, Orleton allegedly accused Edward of being both a tyrant and a sodomite.19 Although Orleton subsequently denied having used these words about Edward II, or inciting his subjects to rebellion, claiming instead that he was referring to the Younger Despenser,20 even their indirect use would be enough to suggest to his hearers that Edward was not a fit person to be king. Accusations or suggestions of sodomy, which was considered tantamount to heresy, were a familiar method of blackening the character of one's enemies: they were used, for example, by Philip IV of France against both Pope Boniface VIII and the Templars, and in the previous generation had been used against Philip's own father Philip III. They were also employed in 1311 by James II of Aragon against one of his subjects, the count of Ampurias.21 The hint, if such it was, that Edward engaged in unnatural vice was readily picked up and disseminated by chroniclers, especially those on the continent.22\n\nIt is likely that the Wallingford council took two further significant actions: firstly the composition of the articles of deposition, or at least of a first draft of the articles which were to be read out by the archbishop of Canterbury in Westminster Hall on 13 January;23 and secondly the decision to send two bishops, the bishop of Hereford and either the bishop of Winchester or London, to Kenilworth to request Edward II's attendance at the parliament24 which was due to begin on 7 January.25\n\nSCENES AT WESTMINSTER\n\nOn 31 December Isabella and her followers left Wallingford for London, where they arrived on 4 January and were received with great solemnity by the Londoners.26 Nonetheless the chaos and anarchy in London were still of very recent memory and precautions were taken against any repetition. On 30 December every citizen was required to take an oath by 6 January to keep the peace, and on 2 January orders were issued forbidding anyone to bear arms in the city, except for the guards appointed by the mayor and aldermen and the queen's escort of men-at-arms from Hainault.27\n\nThe bishop of Hereford and his colleague returned to Westminster on 12 January, with the news that Edward adamantly refused to attend, saying that he did not wish to venture among enemies and traitors.28 If Edward believed that his absence invalidated the assembly at Westminster as a parliament, whose legality was in any case doubtful, he underestimated the determination of his opponents. They may indeed have preferred Edward's absence to the embarrassment of having in their midst a crowned and anointed monarch whose very presence might pose awkward questions about the legitimacy of their proceedings, as well as attracting sympathy. It was no secret, for example, that the bishop of Rochester and some other bishops were deeply unhappy at the turn of events.29There was also the proximity of two papal envoys, William of Laudun the archbishop of Vienne, who already had long experience of Edward II and English affairs, and Master John de Grandison the archdeacon of Nottingham. They had arrived in England on 10 December 1326, nominally to assist in making peace between England and France, but had they been given the chance they might also have tried to mediate between Edward II and his enemies and to save him from deposition.30\n\nIn Edward II's absence matters now proceeded quickly. On 12 January, the day of his return from Kenilworth, the bishop of Hereford asked those present whether they wanted Edward II to remain as king or whether he should be replaced by his son, Edward duke of Aquitaine. It appears that there were differing opinions on this, so parliament was dismissed until the following morning, 13 January, to allow for further thought and persuasion.31 At this point the mayor and citizens of London intervened, either on their own account or in concert with Edward II's opponents, by writing to the prelates and magnates asking them to ally with them, to swear to maintain Isabella and her son, and ‘to crown the latter, and to depose his father for frequent offences against his oath and his Crown’.32 On the evening of 12 January there was a meeting of prelates and magnates, probably in Westminster Hall, at which the articles of accusation against Edward II were either drawn up or an existing draft refined, and at which it was agreed that Edward should no longer reign and that he should be be replaced by his son.33\n\nUp to this point it is possible to be reasonably confident about the sequence of events. However, apart from the formal proclamation of Edward II's ‘abdication’ and Edward III's accession in London on 24 January,34 there is a distinct lack of any official record of the events connected with the end of Edward II's reign in January 1327. The Parliament Roll for January–February 1327 records only the petitions which were presented when parliament resumed in February after the coronation of Edward III. Although there are many references to current events, there is no direct explanation of how Edward III had come to succeed his father. Edward II is referred to only in euphemisms such as ‘Edward his father, when he was king’.35 Even the six articles of accusation against Edward II do not now survive in any official form, although they may once have so existed.36 One official or quasi-official document is the Forma deposicionis Regis Edwardi post Conquestum Secundi, which is preserved in a Canterbury chronicle contained in Trinity College Cambridge Ms. R.5.41. It has been plausibly argued that the document was composed by a supporter of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer and designed to provide a description of events which would make it appear that Edward II had voluntarily resigned the throne instead of acting under the threat of force. Edward III's accession was presented as a substitution for the inadequate rule of his father. The author of the Forma deposicionis recorded only one deputation to Edward II at Kenilworth and not two, and implied that Edward II had already consented to his replacement by his son before the events at Westminster on 13 January. The second visit to Kenilworth was therefore made redundant and was not mentioned.37 Nonetheless, if used with care, the Forma deposicionis is still a valuable source.\n\nAccording to the Forma deposicionis Roger Mortimer of Wigmore was deputed by the gathering of prelates and magnates on the evening of 12 January to announce the results of their deliberations to those assembled in parliament38 when they reconvened in Westminster Hall on the following day, as the bishop of Hereford had asked them to do.39 Then followed a speech from Roger Mortimer and three sermons, by the bishops of Hereford and Winchester and the archbishop of Canterbury, and including the reading by the archbishop of the set of six articles, agreed on the night of 12 January, outlining Edward's defects as king.40 Roger Mortimer cleverly told the gathering that he was not speaking for himself but on behalf of the magnates who had unanimously agreed that the king should be removed from the government of the realm because he was inadequate (insufficiens), and because by accepting evil counsel he was the destroyer of the magnates and the Church, in breach of his coronation oath. Therefore Edward's first-born son the duke of Aquitaine should reign in his place if the people gave their approval (si populus preberet assensum). Thomas Wake, Henry of Lancaster's son-in-law, then replied in a clearly prearranged move and, raising his hands, announced that so far as he was concerned Edward should not remain king (dico pro me numquam regnabit). Mortimer was followed by Adam Orleton the bishop of Hereford, who took as his theme the text from chapter 11 of the Book of Proverbs (ubi non est gubernator populus corruet) (‘Where there is no governor the people shall fall’).41 He described his mission to Kenilworth and how he had spoken frankly to the king. He had addressed the king, citing the text, audi preces populi tui (‘hear the prayers of thy people’),42 and speaking of the great and intolerable defects in Edward's government, his adherence to evil and treacherous counsel, his destruction of the magnates and his loss of the lands which his father had left him. For these reasons the prelates and magnates wished Edward's son to rule in his place. Although, according to Orleton, the king had replied that he had followed the counsel ordained for him by the magnates, he showed himself penitent for the misdeeds which the envoys explained to him, and the homages of the magnates were annulled.43 This version of events, as described in the Forma deposicionis, may well reflect words exchanged with the king when Orleton was sent to Kenilworth to try to persuade Edward to attend parliament, but the implication that Edward II had accepted the transfer of sovereignty to his son even before the dramatic events of 13 January is to say the least doubtful, and as already indicated suggests that the Forma deposicionis is not an impartial record.44 Orleton was followed by John Stratford the bishop of Winchester who preached on the textcaput meum doleo (‘my head aches’),45 arguing that since the king was as it were the head of the kingdom, any weakness in the king produced a weakness in the kingdom; expounding on the many indecencia46 and evils which had been brought upon the Church and the kingdom; and concluding that the magnates were unanimous that the king should be replaced by his first-born son in the government of the kingdom, provided that this decision of the prelates and magnates was supported by the people. With this, Thomas Wake stretched out his arms and asked the people if they consented to this decision, and with a loud voice they acclaimed it. Speaking in French, Walter Reynolds the archbishop of Canterbury then began to address the people, taking as his text the proverbial saying Vox populi vox dei (‘the voice of the people is the voice of God’): ‘Dearly beloved, you know that for a long time you have been afflicted by various oppressions on the part of the king and his evil councillors; and you have called upon God for a remedy. Now it appears that your voice has been heard, since by the unanimous consent of all the magnates the lord King Edward has been deprived of the government of the kingdom and his son put in his place, if you consent to this unanimously. He [i.e. the young Edward] has accepted the counsel of the wise men of the kingdom, after the inadequacy (insufficiencia) of the king, as outlined earlier [i.e. in the articles of deposition], and the offences he had brought upon the Church and kingdom were explained to him.’ The whole people with one accord then raised their hands again and shouted ‘Fiat, fiat, Amen’.47 After which the young Edward was presented to his future subjects, with the words ‘Behold your king’, followed by the singing of ‘Glory, laud and honour’.48\n\nTHE ARTICLES OF DEPOSITION\n\nAt some point in the proceedings on 13 January, either during the archbishop of Canterbury's concluding sermon or, more probably, at an earlier stage in the day, the articles of deposition were presented to the assembly.49 The document was a simple one, without any of the circumstantial detail which had accompanied the charges against, for example, the Younger Despenser. Edward II was accused of being personally incapable of governing, of allowing himself to be led and governed by others who advised him badly, and of refusing to remedy these defects when asked to do so by the great and wise men of the kingdom or allowing anyone else to do so; of devoting himself to unsuitable work and occupations, while neglecting the government of his kingdom; of exhibiting pride, covetousness and cruelty; of losing, for lack of good government, the kingdom of Scotland, and other lands and lordships in Gascony and Ireland (which had been left to him in peace by his father) and of forfeiting the friendship of the king of France and of many other great men; of destroying the Church and imprisoning churchmen, and of putting to death, imprisoning, exiling and disinheriting the great men of his kingdom; of failing to observe his coronation oath through the influence of his evil counsellors; of abandoning his kingdom and doing all in his power to cause the loss both of it and of his people; and of being incorrigible and without hope of improvement. All of which was said to be so notorious that it could not be denied.\n\nEven allowing for the vagueness of these charges and for the simplistic nature of some, such as his alleged personal responsibility for the failure to hold Scotland (which had been far from peaceful in 1307) and for the war in Ireland (which in reality was the scene in 1318 of one of the few definite English military successes), Edward II was depicted as an incompetent ruler and as a man who could not command any respect, whose government in the last resort could only be ended, not mended. He was not however, and very significantly, described as a tyrant. Although the word was freely used of the Younger Despenser,50 it was not employed for Edward II51 any more than it was applied to Richard II in 1399.52 Although concepts of tyranny had long been discussed by political theorists such as John of Salisbury in the twelfth century53 and Bracton in the thirteenth,54 and were treated almost contemporaneously by the dissident Franciscan William of Ockham,55 the implications of using accusations of tyranny to remove a legitimate and anointed king were too contentious and divisive to be of any practical use.56 Edward was instead condemned for his inadequacy and for lacking in those qualities necessary in a king,57 an approach which even some of those sympathetic to him would have had to admit carried conviction. The fact that Edward had a son and heir available to succeed him on the throne made his removal easier to contemplate, even if still difficult to perform in practice. It was little wonder that at the same time as his father was being deprived of his throne, his son and successor, Edward duke of Aquitaine, was receiving plentiful advice from writers such as Walter Milemete and William of Pagula on how to conduct himself as king.58\n\nTHE GUILDHALL OATH\n\nAfter the dramatic events in Westminster Hall on 13 January a gathering was held at the Guildhall in the City of London. In the presence of the mayor, aldermen and ‘a great commonalty’ many of those attending parliament59 took an oath to safeguard Isabella, queen of England, and Edward, the son of the king of England, to give good counsel, to safeguard the liberties of the city, and to keep the ordinances made, or to be made, in parliament by the peers of the land.60 The wording of the oath makes it clear that although Edward II was on the way out, he was still technically king, and it was less extreme in form than the oath demanded by the citizens of London the day before.61 Over the next three days the oath was taken by Edward II's half-brothers, the earls of Norfolk and Kent, the earls of Hereford62 and Surrey, and their retainers; by Roger Mortimer and twenty-three other barons including the earl of Leicester's son-in-law Thomas Wake; fifty-six knights and ten serjeants ‘of the court’,63 four royal justices,64 and four others; twelve or thirteen knights of the shire currently attending parliament; the archbishops of Canterbury and Dublin; John Stratford the bishop of Winchester and treasurer, the bishops of Salisbury, Bath & Wells, Chichester and Llandaff, William Airmyn bishop of Norwich the chancellor, and the bishops of Coventry & Lichfield, Ely, Lincoln, Rochester,65 Worcester, and Adam Orleton of Hereford;66 the abbots of Westminster, St Albans, Waltham, Bury St Edmunds and Peterborough; three priors, twenty-three priests and clerks;67 thirty barons of the Cinque Ports, five men from Bury St Edmunds, and thirteen burgesses from St Albans.68\n\nTHE END COMES\n\nA second delegation then went to Kenilworth,69 probably leaving London on 15 or 16 January.70 There are differing accounts of its membership. According to the Historia Roffensis, the bishops of London, Ely and Hereford, two earls, two barons, and representatives from the counties, cities and Cinque Ports were sent to renounce the homage of the realm;71 the Canterbury chronicle which preserves the Forma deposicionis speaks simply of three bishops, two earls, two barons, two abbots and two justices, without giving any names, apart from that of William Trussell;72 the Brut chronicle states that the earl of Surrey went to act for the earls, John de Hothum the bishop of Ely for the clergy, Henry de Percy for the barons, and William Trussell for the knights.73 The most detailed accounts of the delegation are given in the Lanercost and Pipewell chronicles. Lanercost states that the delegation was composed of the bishops of Winchester and Hereford, the earls of Leicester and Surrey, William de Roos and Hugh de Courtenay for the barons, two abbots, two priors, two justices, two Dominicans, two Carmelites, four knights (two from north of the Trent and two from south of the Trent), two citizens of London, and two citizens of the Cinque Ports, numbering twenty-four persons in all. No Franciscan friars were included in the delegation, allegedly at the request of Isabella, who had a particular affection for the order, so that they would not be the bearers of so displeasing a message. There is no mention in this account of William Trussell, although it is certain that he was a member, nor of the bishops of London and Ely.74 The Pipewell chronicle gives the composition as the bishops of London, Winchester and Hereford; the abbots of Glastonbury and Dover; the earls of Surrey and Lancaster (i.e. Leicester); the barons Hugh de Courtenay and Richard de Grey; two royal justices, Geoffrey le Scrope and John Bourchier; two (?) barons of the Cinque Ports; four burgesses of London; and four knights to represent the community of the land.75While there is no agreement on the exact composition of the delegation sent to Kenilworth, it is clear that it was large in number and intended to be as widely representative of the kingdom as possible, and not just of those who were attending parliament.76\n\nThe delegation reached Kenilworth or its immediate vicinity on 20 January,77 when according to the chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker, which has the most detailed account of the mission, the bishops of Winchester and Lincoln78 went ahead of the rest and spoke to Edward in private, accompanied only by Henry of Lancaster. They tried to persuade him to resign his crown to his elder son, Edward, promising that he would be honoured as before and suggesting that he would obtain merit in the sight of God and bring peace to his subjects. But they also threatened that, if Edward did not resign his crown, ‘the people’ would withdraw their homage and fealty, repudiate his sons, and place someone of non-royal blood upon the throne. After many tears and much sighing, Edward gave way, prepared, as the chronicler put it, to lay down his life for Christ rather than witness his sons' disinheritance or the disturbance of the kingdom, and knowing that a good shepherd would give his soul for his sheep. The bishop of Hereford then arrived with the other members of the delegation, whom he gathered in order of rank in the king's chamber. At length Edward emerged from an inner room, dressed in a black robe, and so affected by grief that he could barely stand and had to be helped by the earl of Leicester and bishop of Winchester. The bishop of Hereford explained the reason for the delegation's presence and demanded that he resign his crown to his first-born son. Again Edward was threatened that if he did not agree, someone more suitable would be chosen as king. Weeping and crying out, Edward said that he was deeply saddened that his people were so angry with him, but was pleased that his son would at least succeed him as king.79 It is possible that a notary, as was later to be the case with Richard II in 1399, formally recorded Edward's acceptance, but there is no clear evidence of this.80 The threat to disinherit Edward's sons from the succession is not recorded by any of the other chroniclers and would in any case have been an empty one, since the placing on the throne of anyone other than the young Edward would scarcely have met with general acceptance and would have been a recipe for civil war.81 There is also a strong element of propaganda attaching to the account of Geoffrey le Baker, who was seeking here and elsewhere to portray Edward II as a suffering saint and martyr.82 However, there can be little doubt about Edward's grief at being deprived of his throne and reduced to an imprisoned subject of a new king, even if that king was his own son.83 On the following day, 21 January, Sir William Trussell formally withdrew homage on behalf of the kingdom from Edward, now once more Edward of Caernarfon,84 and Sir Thomas Blount, steward of the household, broke his staff of office.85 The reign of Edward II was ended, having lasted, as the Canterbury chronicler noted, for nineteen years, twenty-nine weeks and five days.86 For the unknown author of the Brut chronicle the downfall of Edward II and the disasters of his reign were the fulfilment of the prophecies of Merlyn:87‘and ever afterwards he lived his life in much sorrow and anguish’.88\n\nABDICATION OR DEPOSITION?\n\nThe delegation probably arrived back in London from Kenilworth on 25 January, but their news had preceded them.89 On 24 January it was proclaimed in London that ‘Sir Edward, late king of England, has of his good will (de sa bone volunte) and by the common counsel and assent of the prelates, earls and barons, and other nobles, and of all the commonalty of the realm, resigned the government of the realm (sen est ouste del governement du roialme), and has granted and wills that the government of the realm shall come to Sir Edward, his eldest son and heir, and that [Edward] shall govern, reign and be crowned king.’ The peace of the new king was proclaimed at the same time;90 the first official acts in the name of Edward III were dated on the same day as the proclamation; and his first regnal year began officially on the following day, 25 January.91\n\nEverything looked neat and tidy. One king had willingly divested himself of his office; a new king, the elder son of the old one and with an unquestioned right to succeed him, had been proclaimed and would soon be crowned. But was it quite so straightforward? Not everyone was happy at the events of January 1327. It is known, for example, that the archbishop of York, one of Edward II's oldest friends and allies, another close friend the bishop of Rochester, and the bishops of London and Carlisle did not consent on 13 January to Edward II's replacement as king by his son.92 Many others attending parliament tacitly accepted what was being done because of fear of the Londoners, whose clamour both inside and outside Westminster Hall punctuated the whole proceedings,93which were carefully stage-managed by Roger Mortimer and Thomas Wake. William Trussell, who withdrew allegiance from Edward II on behalf of the whole community of the realm, was also part of the management team: he was not an elected member of parliament,94but like Thomas Wake was a follower of Henry of Lancaster, earl of Leicester and Edward II's gaoler at Kenilworth. The taking of the Guildhall oath to support Isabella and the young Edward on 13 January and in the days following added further pressure, which some apparently resisted. Of the forty-seven men summoned to the parliament as barons only seventeen are recorded as having taken the oath.95 It is also noticeable that only twelve or thirteen knights of the shire out of sixty-eight who were elected,96 and a handful of abbots out of the nineteen who were summoned took the oath. The only burgesses who subscribed were eighteen men from Bury St Edmunds and St Albans, but none of these was an elected member of parliament;97 of the 108 elected burgesses none is recorded as subscribing.98 Earls and barons and their knightly retainers, on the other hand, were especially prominent.99 The representatives of North and South Wales were not even summoned to parliament until it had already begun: and one of the most prominent Welshmen, Sir Gruffydd Llwyd the sheriff of Merioneth, appears to have refused to attend, probably out of loyalty to Edward II and hatred of Roger Mortimer.100 The pressure was maintained after the deputation had left London for Kenilworth: on 20 January the archbishop of Canterbury and seven bishops took a new oath in support of the young Edward, which this time described him as king. Others may have done the same.101\n\nIt was made to seem as if Edward II had willingly resigned or abdicated his throne. But it was obvious to everyone that he had done so under extreme pressure. Earlier in his reign the Ordinances had been imposed upon him against his will and in 1320 he had won support from the pope for the annulment of his personal oath to uphold them: an oath made unwillingly was no oath, in the eyes of the Church. How much greater was the offence when an anointed king was forced to leave his throne; and how great the urgency to bundle the old king quickly out of sight and crown his successor. The chroniclers knew perfectly well that Edward II had been deposed, and several of them said so.102\n\nBut deposed by whom? Was Edward II deposed by parliament or during parliament? Some of the major events, such as those of 13 January, the presentation of the six articles against Edward II, the speech by Roger Mortimer, the sermons by the archbishop and bishops, and the acclamation of Edward II's elder son, certainly took place in parliament, in Westminster Hall, and in the presence of those who had been summoned to attend. But these were really only the public formalities, and were supplemented by other actions which occurred separately, such as the oath-taking at the Guildhall of the city of London between 13 and 15 January, or the meeting of the magnates and prelates on their own in Westminster Hall on the night of 12 January. The reservations and fears of some of those within Westminster Hall, the careful management of the events that took place there, and the intimidation of any possible opponents by the Londoners both inside and outside Westminster Hall must all be taken into account. What really brought about Edward II's downfall was the combined determination of the leading magnates, their personal followers and the Londoners that he must go. It has aptly been said that if ‘the magnates and prelates had deposed a king in response to “the clamour of the whole people”, that clamour had a distinct London accent’.103\n\nThe one certainty is that Edward II was still king when the month of January 1327 began, even if held a prisoner, but that he had ceased to be king before the month had ended. Although the deposition of Edward II did not attack kingship itself, the actual process of deposing a legitimate and anointed king involved an attempt to square the circle. That process had in practice taken place during, in, on the margins of and outside an assembly whose own legitimacy was to say the least doubtful. Edward II may in the end have given the appearance of abdicating his throne in favour of his son, but he had done so under intense pressure and while he was a prisoner. It was essential, both for propaganda purposes and for the future peace of the kingdom, that Edward II's deposition should have been agreed to ‘by the prelates, earls, barons, and the whole community of the realm’. The real nature of what had happened did not bear too close an examination.104 It is hardly surprising that a Parliament Roll for the period before 1 February 1327 does not exist: it is more than likely that one never existed.105 Edward II had been airbrushed out of the record.\n\nEDWARD IN CAPTIVITY\n\nOn 1 February the new king was knighted, together with many other young men, by John de Beaumont, the brother of the count of Hainault, and John de Bohun earl of Hereford.106 On the following day Edward III was crowned in Westminster Abbey by the archbishop of Canterbury, who had known and worked with his father since at least 1297; and he took the same oath which had been administered to Edward II in 1308.107 The bishops present included John de Hothum of Ely, Adam Orleton of Hereford, John Stratford of Winchester, Henry Burghersh of Lincoln and William Airmyn of Norwich, all of whom had fallen out with the former king.108 The former Edward II's two half-brothers, Thomas of Brotherton earl of Norfolk and earl marshal, and Edmund of Woodstock earl of Kent, were present, as were the earls of Surrey and Hereford, Roger Mortimer, Henry de Beaumont, ‘and other magnates of the realm’.109 On the day after the coronation the work of parliament was resumed: political debts were repaid in the confirmation of the 1321 articles of accusation against the Despensers; the judgment against Thomas of Lancaster in 1322 was reversed; Henry of Lancaster was confirmed as earl of Lancaster and steward of England; and there were moves to have both Thomas of Lancaster and Robert Winchelsey archbishop of Canterbury, another former opponent of Edward II, canonized.110 Roger Mortimer also petitioned for the reversal of the judgment against him in 1323, which was duly granted in July 1327, four months after the end of the parliament.111 The other winners in 1327 were the citizens of London, whose actions had done so much to undermine the power of Edward II in the autumn of 1326 and had helped to ensure his deposition in January 1327. The Londoners' petition for the restoration of their liberties could not be refused and on 7 March they were rewarded with a comprehensive charter confirming all the ancient liberties they had held before 1321 and granting them important new privileges.112\n\nThe change in regime was further signified by the choice of a council to advise the new king. ‘Because,’ according to the Brut chronicle, ‘Edward was so young and his father had been misled by false councillors’ he should be governed by twelve great lords of the land: four prelates (the archbishops of Canterbury and York, the bishops of Winchester and Hereford), four earls (Lancaster, Norfolk, Kent and Surrey), and four barons (Thomas Wake, Henry Percy, Oliver Ingham and John de Roos). It may be significant that Roger Mortimer was not among them.113\n\nEDWARD\n\nThe former Edward II, now simply ‘Edward, the king's father’, or ‘Edward of Caernarfon’114 was still at Kenilworth. Little is known about his stay there, except that he was apparently well treated; but even the gift of two tuns of Rhenish wine by his son the new king can have been of little consolation.115 Later, while Edward was at Berkeley, his keepers, Thomas de Berkeley and John Maltravers, were allowed £5 a day for his maintenance;116 altogether they were paid £700, of which £200 came directly from the exchequer, while in May 1327 they received a further £500 in cash, equivalent to one hundred days' maintenance, which was part of the £13,000 in silver pennies found in Caerphilly castle after its surrender by the son of the Younger Despenser.117 It was not lavish but was enough to keep Edward in modest comfort.118 However, if Murimuth is correct, Thomas de Berkeley and John Maltravers took turns in looking after Edward, one month at a time: Berkeley allegedly treated him humanely but Maltravers ‘otherwise’.119 Several of the chroniclers remark on the misery experienced by Edward while he was at Berkeley, though whether he was actually placed in a room adjoining a pit filled with rotting flesh there is no way of knowing.120 Regardless of any physical mistreatment, it was to be expected that he should continue to miss the company of his family and could not understand why they still refused to visit him.121 Any anger he had felt against Isabella and any possibility that he might do her harm had probably dissipated by this time and been replaced by feelings of loss and unhappiness. However, there is little reason to believe that Edward's despair was reflected in the Anglo-Norman poem in which Edward laments his fate and shows repentance for his past misdeeds. This was almost certainly composed by an anonymous fourteenth-century writer, making use of the familiar theme of the wheel of fortune and trying to cast Edward in a favourable light.122\n\nA MULTIPLICITY OF PLOTS\n\nEdward II was gone but not forgotten. No sooner had he been deposed than his friends and allies began plotting to free him from his imprisonment.\n\nThe first signs came in early March when a commission was appointed to inquire into the activities of a number of Warwickshire men, including Stephen Dunheved or Dunhead from Dunchurch, a few miles from Kenilworth, and two local priests both named William Aylmer.123 At this stage there was no mention of any plot to release the former king, but a strong hint of something more serious came on 28 April when the earl of Lancaster wrote from Leicester to the chancellor, John de Hothum bishop of Ely, telling him that he had heard that Brother John de Stoke, a Dominican friar from Warwick, had been plotting with others unnamed to ‘betray’ the earl's castle of Warwick, and asking for a commission to arrest him: this was duly issued on 1 May, significantly with orders to bring John to the king in person. Three days later further orders were issued for the arrest of Stephen Dunheved, who was to be taken to Wallingford for imprisonment. These apparently unconnected facts, together with the arrest of William Aylmer which was ordered on 23 April,124 suggest that the earl of Lancaster's anxiety about Edward's security, expressed in his letter and recorded by the Leicester chronicler Henry Knighton, was well founded and that the earl was eager for his royal charge to be moved somewhere safer.125 Although in 1328 the quarrel between the earl of Lancaster and Mortimer almost led to a renewal of civil war and in 1330 Roger Mortimer was accused of seizing Edward from Kenilworth and taking him to Berkeley with the intention of murdering him,126there is nothing to suggest any unwillingness on the earl's part in 1327127 or that there was any deliberate intention to exchange Edward's relatively comfortable imprisonment for a harsher regime under Mortimer's control.128 Nonetheless, that was to be the effect.\n\nOn 3 April 1327 Edward was formally transferred to the custody of two of Roger Mortimer's leading followers, his son-in-law Thomas de Berkeley and Berkeley's brother-in-law John Maltravers.129 On 5 April Edward arrived, with a heavily armed escort, either at the abbey of Llanthony in Gloucester or at Gloucester castle which was close by; and on the same day, or very soon afterwards, he was delivered to Berkeley castle.130 Within a short time of his arrival at Berkeley a second plot to release him was being hatched, involving some of the same cast of characters as at Kenilworth together with numerous other individuals. The evidence suggests that the conspirators were very determined but at the same time had little or no idea of what they expected to happen if they succeeded in freeing Edward. If they were acting with other more powerfully placed conspirators, there is nothing to suggest this.131\n\nOn 27 July Thomas de Berkeley wrote to the chancellor John de Hothum reminding him of an earlier letter in which he named a number of men who had approached Berkeley castle in force, had seized ‘the father of our lord the king’ from his custody132 and had plundered the castle.133 Exactly when this had occurred is not stated but it was probably earlier in July.134 Neither is it clear whether Edward had actually been taken out of the castle by the conspirators or whether he had only been freed from his prison within the castle. However, the names of those indicted for the offence are of great interest. They include Stephen Dunheved, the two parsons named William Aylmer who had been involved in the earlier attempt on Kenilworth, and thirteen others from the counties of Warwick, Stafford and Gloucester.135 Among the others were Stephen's brother, the Dominican Thomas Dunheved, two other Dominicans, John de Newminster and Henry de Ryhale, a monk from Hailes abbey in Gloucestershire, a canon of Llanthony, and the parson of Huntley in Gloucestershire. Thomas de Berkeley added that his men had also learned that a large number of men had gathered for the same purpose in the county of Buckingham and other adjoining counties, and that two of their leaders were another friar John de Redmere and John Norton. Berkeley said that he would do his best to apprehend Edmund Gacelyn and the others named in the commission. The fate of the Dunheved brothers is uncertain. Thomas is said to have died in prison after an unsuccessful attempt to escape, while his brother Stephen was captured at London. However, Thomas's imprisonment is said to have taken place around 11 June, which does not fit with his involvement at Berkeley in July; his brother apparently escaped and was still at large in 1329.136\n\nThe striking things about this list of names are the number of clergy, especially Dominican friars, and the number of men who had in one way or another served Edward as king. Edmund Gacelyn had been a royal household knight before 1321 when he had opposed the Despensers; while John de Redmere had, as the letter stated, been the keeper of the king's stud; William Aylmer and John le Botiller had probably also been in royal service.137 Of particular significance is the Dominican friar Thomas Dunheved. He had been one of Edward II's confessors and a papal chaplain and he it was who allegedly tried to obtain a divorce between Edward and Isabella while he was at Avignon in 1325;138 he may even have been with Edward in Wales in 1326.139 Thomas had probably been involved with his fellow Dominican, John de Stoke, and his own brother Stephen in the earlier plot against Kenilworth. Although the royal government understandably did not make the attempt to release Edward public, both the plot and Thomas Dunheved's part in it were known to the writers of the Anonimalle Chronicle and the Annales Paulini.140\n\nThe support given to the former Edward II by lowly members of the clergy and religious orders suggests that Edward's reputation for holiness which later gave rise to a campaign for his canonization had some kind of substance. But the appearance of so many Dominicans in their ranks is especially significant since the English Dominicans had a close relationship with and a fierce loyalty to Edward II both before and after he became king.141 Edward in his turn had expressed ‘a great affection for the order of friars preacher, for many reasons’.142 They provided his confessors and, in the case of the schemer and trickster Nicholas of Wisbech, supplied him with ‘evidence’ to support his belief in the miraculous powers of the Holy Oil of St Thomas.143 The Dominicans who protected Gaveston's body after his death in 1312 may have been from Oxford but it is also likely that they were from the Dominican house in Warwick.144 In June 1317 these friars told the king in a petition that they and their property had been attacked by the local population on account of monsire Piers.145 It was then hardly a coincidence that in March–April 1327 John de Stoke and perhaps other Warwick Dominicans plotted to free Edward from his imprisonment nearby at Kenilworth; or that other men from the same area should have been involved in the July plot against Berkeley castle. The attacks planned or carried out against Kenilworth and Berkeley were all too reminiscent of the seizure of Wallingford and of Mortimer's own escape from the Tower in 1323 for the authorities not to take them seriously.\n\nThe July plot came at a very difficult and dangerous time for the government of the young Edward III, since England and Scotland were again at war. The Scots had reopened hostilities, which had been dormant since the thirteen-year truce of 1323, when they attacked Norham castle on 1 February 1327, the very day of Edward III's coronation.146 In retaliation the English launched a campaign in July which resulted only in humiliation for the young king, who came close to capture at Stanhope Park in Weardale near Durham. It also resulted in the dissipation of much of the financial reserve which had been built up under Edward II; and in quarrels and recriminations between Roger Mortimer, the earl of Lancaster and Edward II's half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton the earl of Norfolk and earl marshal.147 The Scots then launched a savage and very determined attack on the main castles and the countryside of Northumberland during August and September.148 It was nothing less than a replay of Edward II's campaigns against the Scots and, to make matters worse, there were worrying signs from Ireland. Edward III's rule there was not formally proclaimed until 13 May 1327 and in February the justiciar, John D'Arcy, had sent an emissary to Scotland on ‘certain confidential business touching the lord king’, who was still considered to be Edward II. Robert Bruce's landing in Ulster around Easter 1327 (12 April) may have been connected with this mission, but Bruce certainly had ambitions of his own which may have amounted to a scheme to invade England with the assistance of Edward II's former ministers in Ireland and Edward's supporters and Mortimer's enemies in Wales.149 The government in England could not have known all of this but by July they had learned enough to be deeply worried about the situation in Ireland.150 Had they also known that two of Edward II's closest personal allies, Rhys ap Gruffudd151 and Donald earl of Mar,152 were also in Bruce's ranks, they would have been even more concerned.\n\nBy the late summer of 1327 England was under external attack and riddled with internal conspiracies, some of which were aimed at freeing Edward from captivity and perhaps even restoring him to the throne. For all anyone knew, Robert Bruce, now an ailing man and soon to die, might also have seen this as a way to gain the English recognition of Scottish independence which had eluded him ever since Bannockburn. Not surprisingly, Edward's guards took extra precautions. He was apparently moved around secretly by night from place to place, including Corfe castle in Dorset, so that no one could be sure of where he was being held, before finally being brought back to Berkeley.153\n\nANOTHER CONSPIRACY\n\nThe precautions were not sufficient: within weeks of Edward's return to Berkeley news came of yet another conspiracy to free the deposed king. On 14 September 1327154 William Shaldeford, Roger Mortimer's lieutenant in North Wales, wrote to Mortimer from Rhosfair155 in Anglesey to report a plan to release Edward from Berkeley on the part of Rhys ap Gruffudd and others in South and North Wales, and with the support of certain unnamed magnates. The letter was sent to Mortimer at Abergavenny,156 and one of Mortimer's retainers William Ockley was allegedly then sent to Berkeley with instructions to Edward's guardians John Maltravers and another of Mortimer's men, Thomas Gurney, to read the letter ‘and to take speedy action to avoid greater danger’:157‘thereupon William Ockley and the others who had Edward in their custody treacherously slew and murdered Edward, the father of our lord the king, in destruction of the royal blood’.158 If Edward had been successfully released, the conspirators also intended to bring about the destruction of Roger Mortimer and his followers. Although the story is known today only from a court case in March 1331, when a man from North Wales, Hywel ap Gruffudd, accused William Shaldeford of aiding and abetting the murder of Edward II,159 it is very plausible that in 1327 men like Rhys ap Gruffudd in South Wales and his counterpart Gruffydd Llwyd in North Wales, in whom loyalty to the former king was joined with hatred of Mortimer, really were planning to release Edward from his captivity. It is also worth remembering that Rhys ap Gruffudd had been with Edward at Neath abbey in his last days of freedom in 1326 and it also appears that he was involved in the earl of Kent's conspiracy in 1330. Hywel himself had probably been one of the men who joined Rhys ap Gruffudd in Scotland after the fall of Edward II.160 If Hywel's accusations are true, the news of this latest plot to free the former king had come not to Edward III's government but directly and personally to Roger Mortimer, who was then in Wales and therefore able to decide how to react without reference to Edward III and his council.161 This would therefore seem to be an open and shut case: Roger Mortimer had the opportunity to murder the former king and his agents Gurney and Ockley duly carried it out.\n\nOn 22 September Thomas Gurney was sent to the king and Isabella with letters from Thomas de Berkeley informing them that Edward had died on the previous day, 21 September, only seven days after the dispatch of Shaldeford's letter from Anglesey.162Gurney may have been expecting to find Edward III at Nottingham163 but it is more probable that he did so at Lincoln, where a parliament had been meeting since 15 September. The young Edward III was told of his father's death on Wednesday, 23 September, ‘during the night’.164 The news was clearly made public without delay:165 for the moment there was no suspicion that the death was other than natural.166\n\nPEACE AT LAST\n\nEven if there had been any suspicion of foul play, there was no time to look more closely or even for the young Edward III to go to Berkeley to pay his respects.167 On 24 September Edward wrote to the earl of Hereford (and presumably other magnates) informing him of the death of his father but also warning him that the Scots were reported to be on the point of invading England.168 Resisting the Scots had to take precedence over grieving for the old king, for whom nothing could now be done. The Scots were continuing their raids in the north, but these were for the moment at least to be the last of their kind, since the English had decided to negotiate for a final peace with Scotland. The failure of the latest Scottish campaign, along with near-bankruptcy169 and the growing disturbances within England170 made peace unavoidable. The regime of Mortimer and Isabella also no longer had the (very expensive) support of the force of Hainaulters under John of Hainault, which had left England for home at the end of August.171In early October envoys were sent to seek out Robert Bruce and to discover his terms. These were received on 18 October and formed the basis of negotiations at Newcastle during November and December 1327. On 1 March 1328 Edward III recognized the independent existence of the kingdom of Scotland and the legitimacy of Robert Bruce as its king; and on 17 March a formal treaty was concluded. It was in many respects the same as the abortive treaty for which the earl of Carlisle Andrew Harclay had lost his head in 1323.172\n\nA ROYAL FUNERAL\n\nWhile the preliminaries of peace were taking place the body of the former king lay at Berkeley. The long delay between Edward's death on 21 September and his burial on 20 December was not the result of indifference or callousness on the part of the young king, but rather of the pressure of events. Relations with France remained tense and had to be improved,173 while there was also the matter of Edward III's marriage to Philippa of Hainault, whose details had still to be negotiated.174 The situation was not unlike that at the beginning of the reign of Edward II, when the continuing war in Scotland and the arrangements for Edward and Isabella's own marriage took precedence over the burial of Edward I, who had died on 7 July and whose funeral took place on 27 October.\n\nSuch state events in any case took time to organize and there are indications that Edward II's funeral was intended to be a significant event: he was not going to be bundled quickly out of sight and promptly forgotten. The first question to be answered was where he was to be buried. The obvious place was Westminster Abbey, which Henry III had rebuilt to hold the shrine of the royal saint, Edward the Confessor, as well as his own tomb and those of his successors. The abbey was clearly intended to become a royal mausoleum to rival that of the kings of France at Saint-Denis.175 Both Edward I and his first queen, Eleanor of Castile, had been buried there and it might be expected that Edward II would also be laid to rest there. However, Edward had been on bad terms with Westminster Abbey since the beginning of his reign,176 while the political turbulence shown by the Londoners at the end of his reign and which had contributed so much to his deposition in January 1327 might have been expressed once more if the hated king's body were to be brought into their midst.177 It is known however that the monks of Westminster were anxious for Edward II to be buried there, no doubt for reasons of prestige. Two monks, Robert de Beby and John de Tothale, were sent to Nottingham during October 1327 ‘to seek the body of the dead king’:178 not to find out where the body of the dead king was, but to obtain it for burial. They were not successful and Westminster Abbey was ruled out in favour of the great Benedictine abbey of St Peter's, Gloucester. The story that John Thoky, the abbot of Gloucester, transported the body on a richly decorated wagon from Berkeley to Gloucester where it was solemnly received by the monks of St Peter's and a procession of the local people, can be only partly true since the orders for the body's removal to Gloucester came directly from the king and the journey was paid for by the exchequer.179 However the claim in the history of St Peter's, Gloucester, that the monasteries of St Augustine in Bristol, Kingswood near Bristol and Malmesbury in Wiltshire had all refused to accept Edward's body for burial because they were afraid of Roger Mortimer and Isabella and their followers is patently untrue.180 St Peter's, Gloucester, was deliberately chosen by Edward III and Isabella as Edward's resting place, partly because it was not Westminster but also because it had the merits both of proximity to Berkeley and of some previous connections with the English ruling house: the nine-year-old Henry III had undergone his first coronation there after his accession in 1216, and in 1134 Duke Robert of Normandy, the eldest son of William the Conqueror and one of the leaders of the first crusade, had been buried there.181 It was not a royal abbey in the same sense as Westminster but it had the makings of one.\n\nLittle is known in detail about the treatment of Edward II's body while it still lay at Berkeley. According to Adam Murimuth, various abbots, priors, knights and burgesses from Bristol and Gloucester were summoned to view the body but were able to do so only superficially.182 It was looked after by a royal serjeant, William de Beaucaire, and it was eviscerated and embalmed by an unnamed woman, who was taken to see Isabella at Worcester in the days immediately following the funeral at Gloucester.183 Edward's heart was placed in a specially made silver vase costing 37s 8d:184 after Isabella's own death in 1358 this was placed inside the breast of the effigy on her tomb in the choir of the church of the London Franciscans in Newgate.185 It is clear that Edward was being regarded and treated with dignity. Instead of such euphemisms as ‘Edward, the king's father’ or even ‘Edward of Caernarfon’, Edward was referred to as king throughout the financial records of his funeral; and this was consistent with the lavish display of the funeral arrangements themselves. It was clearly to be a ceremony which, like a coronation, emphasized the continuity of the monarchy and the legitimacy of both the present and the previous incumbents of the English throne. The ambiguities and untidiness of the events surrounding Edward II's deposition in January were to be made up for by the splendour of his funeral in December, and reinforced within a few years by the construction of an elaborate tomb above his burial place in Gloucester abbey.186\n\nOn 21 October, a month after Edward's death, his body was moved from Berkeley castle to Gloucester abbey,187 where it was initially placed upon a hearse brought from London. This was then replaced by a specially built one constructed by eight carpenters between 24 November and 11 December. It included four gilded lions painted by the king's painter, John de Eastwick, which stood around the hearse and wore mantles bearing the royal arms, and standing figures of the four evangelists. Eight figures of angels and two lions rampant completed the decoration.188 A great many people were evidently expected to come to view Edward lying in state, and a great many did so; four stout oak beams were placed around the hearse to control the crowds.189 The body in its coffin was not visible, being also surmounted by a specially made wooden image of the dead king, which bore a copper crown and was probably dressed in the pieces of armour which were brought from London.190 This was the first occasion on which a royal effigy was employed in England, but it started a tradition which was followed until the eighteenth century.191 The image of a warrior king was presented for the lying in state but for the actual burial the effigy was adorned with Edward II's coronation robes, which were returned to the great wardrobe in London after the funeral; the body itself was clothed in the undergarments which Edward had worn at his coronation in 1308.192 While it was awaiting burial the body was again attended by William de Beaucaire, together with the bishop of Llandaff John Eaglescliff, who was a Dominican friar and therefore especially sympathetic to the memory of the late king; two royal chaplains Bernard de Bergh and Richard de Potesgrave; two royal knights Edmund Wasteneys and Robert Hastang; two royal serjeants Bertrand de la More and John de Enfield; and Andrew the king's candle-maker.193\n\nThe funeral took place on 20 December. Although it was attended by Edward III, Isabella and Mortimer, nothing is known about it. There are no official records and the English chroniclers barely mentioned the occasion.194 If there were any doubts or suspicions about the circumstances of Edward's death, they were not voiced on that day. On 27 November the archbishop of Canterbury Walter Reynolds, who had known Edward for thirty years but had betrayed him at the last, preceded him to the grave.195\n\nA ROYAL MAUSOLEUM OR A ROYAL SHRINE?\n\nEdward III and the court had to hasten away. Edward's future bride Philippa of Hainault was about to arrive at Dover prior to their marriage at York on 24 January;196 and the peace negotiations with Scotland were still in progress. But this was not the end of Edward III's interest in Gloucester, since it appears that he now intended to turn St Peter's abbey into a royal mausoleum or rather a shrine to the memory of his father, and in the process replace the ignominy of Edward II's deposition and imprisonment by a powerful advertisement for the English crown. This in turn raises the question of whether Edward III considered making Gloucester rather than Westminster the usual burial place for English kings. The answer is probably negative: when his brother John of Eltham, earl of Cornwall died in 1336 he was buried at Westminster and a fine tomb later erected in his memory; and when Edward III himself died in 1377 it was to Westminster that his body was conveyed for burial.197\n\nOn 20 December 1328, the first anniversary of his father's burial, Edward III visited Gloucester and showed his gratitude to the people of the town for their respect to the body of his father by confirming their charters; he also granted privileges to the abbey.198He was there between 13 August and 4 September 1329, and again from 14 to 26 September, after a few days spent at Hereford; and between 22 and 26 June 1330. In September 1332 Edward wrote to the abbots of Gloucester, Hailes, Winchcombe and Tewkesbury, reminding them that his father's anniversary was about to occur and asking them and religious persons from Gloucester and the surrounding area to celebrate it in Gloucester abbey with all due devotion and honour.199 This was probably an annual occurrence both at Gloucester200 and in the king's own private chapel, or wherever he happened to be.201 Edward visited Gloucester again on 14 September 1337, and in March 1343 presented the abbey with a gold ship in honour of his victory over a French fleet at Sluys in 1340 and his recent narrow escape from shipwreck in the Channel: this was offered at the high altar but later attached to Edward II's tomb. In 1353 Edward III's sons also visited Gloucester to pay their respects to their grand-father's memory.202There is also ample evidence that Edward III encouraged others outside his family to pray for the soul of his father,203 sometimes as a quid pro quo for a royal grant.204\n\nBut Edward II himself was the main attraction at Gloucester. Large numbers of pilgrims came to visit the site of his burial and probably in even larger numbers after the construction of his tomb. It is traditionally believed that the offerings by visitors to the tomb helped to finance the extensive reconstruction of the Norman abbey during the course of the fourteenth century:205 the south transept was rebuilt between 1331 and 1336 in a style modelled on that of St Stephen's Chapel at Westminster;206 a new choir screen and choir were added between 1337 and 1367;207 and the great east window was built between 1350 and 1360, with paintings of the coronation of the Virgin, saints, angels and kings, but also including the arms of Edward II as well as those of Edward III and the Black Prince and other men who had fought at Crécy and Calais in 1346–7.208\n\nThe result was a magnificent recreation of the Norman abbey church in the new architectural style known today as perpendicular, and the perfect setting for the royal tomb which was constructed inside it. Although a great deal has been written about the tomb, many uncertainties remain. It is not known, for example, who ordered and paid for it, who designed and constructed it, and exactly when. The tomb effigy is made of alabaster probably from a quarry in Nottinghamshire, and may have been intended to emulate the white marble effigies of French kings of the same period. Edward is shown holding the orb and sceptre and ‘with a fine bearded head, calm and typically Plantagenet, flanked by angels’,209 which has led one commentator to suggest that the tomb was designed to emphasize the saintliness of Edward II, and the idea of the king as a type of Christ.210 The effigy lies on a tomb-chest of Purbeck marble and is surmounted by a canopy of fine-grained Cotswold oolitic limestone, which has been described as ‘the work of a genius and arguably the most thrilling of all tomb canopies’.211\n\nIt was certainly in the interests of the monks of Gloucester to have a king buried in their midst, especially one whose supposed saintly qualities attracted streams of visitors seeking miracles. Gloucester abbey was no doubt well aware of Hereford cathedral only about 30 miles away which possessed the shrine of the recently canonized Thomas Cantilupe and had been making a steady income from pilgrims since his death in 1282.212 Gloucester was now in a position to offer competition and appears to have done so: the number of pilgrims to Hereford had declined steeply by the mid-1330s.213 It might therefore have made good business sense for the monks of Gloucester abbey to invest in an elaborate shrine to Edward II without any involvement on the part of the crown. This may have been what happened214 but it seems unlikely. In the first place the tomb was clearly the work of a master and not of a local craftsman or architect. It was work of the very highest quality with both a national and an international significance.215 Two possibilities have been suggested, both men who had worked on royal building projects at Westminster: Thomas of Canterbury, who was in charge of St Stephen's chapel, Westminster, between about 1323 and c. 1335–6, and was also familiar with the latest developments in London and Canterbury, with a suggested building date for the tomb of about 1330;216 and William Ramsey, surveyor of the king's works from 1336, with a construction date of 1336–9.217 Secondly, it was very much in the interest of Edward III that his father should not only be buried amid splendour but that his tomb, when it was built, should convey a message of quiet but dignified majesty. If pilgrims wished to visit the tomb in search of miracles, so much the better. The English royal house could do with a saint from its own ranks, to add to the cult of St Edward the Confessor which was national rather than dynastic in nature, and also to counter the miracles attributed to Edward II's old opponent and deadly enemy, Thomas of Lancaster. In the quality and power of the effigy the tomb has no contemporary parallel and has aptly been described as ‘a remarkable example of theatrical statecraft’, and ‘a monument fit for a saint … that remains to-day a powerful manifestation of the evocative power of great architecture’.218 It is hard to believe that an object of such subtlety and importance could have been created without both the approval and the involvement of Edward III. There is also the possibility that the king was concerned in and contributed to the rebuilding of the abbey church, especially the south transept which has close architectural parallels with the tomb.219 If we were to guess at a possible date for the dedication of the tomb, it might be September 1337, the occasion of a visit by Edward III220 and the year following the completion of the south transept.\n\nAnother question is who paid for the tomb. Pilgrims and visitors no doubt made a contribution as the Abbey chronicle claimed, but there are no extant financial records of the medieval abbey to show whether or not this was so.221 It is also possible that the town of Gloucester made its own contribution in return for the confirmation of its charters in December 1328, but again there is no evidence to support this. On the other hand, if Edward III contributed wholly or largely to the cost,222 there should be documentary proof of this. Unfortunately this is not the case either.223 By the time that Edward III took over the rule of his kingdom from the regime of his mother Isabella and Roger Mortimer in late 1330, the treasury was almost empty.224 He was reduced to raising money by extraordinary measures and did so, for example, for the wedding of his sister Eleanor to Count Reginald of Guelders in 1332, when he sent out what amounted to begging letters to the heads of nearly 300 religious houses: these brought in over £1,300.225 It is conceivable that Edward III also raised money by special measures for the construction of his father's tomb. In his account for 1332–3 the sheriff of Gloucestershire recorded a sum of £1, 521 received from the lands at Cheltenham and Slaughter belonging to the great Benedictine abbey of Fécamp in Normandy.226 These had been in royal custody for several years, arising first from the seizure of the lands of alien religious houses in 1324 during the war of Saint-Sardos and then from the vacancy which arose when the abbot Pierre Roger was appointed as archbishop of Rouen. Pierre Roger was well known to the English court through his close involvement in Anglo-French relations: in 1328 and again in 1329 he was sent to England to demand that Edward III should perform homage; and in between these two missions he was sent to Gascony to sequester Edward's revenues until he agreed to pay homage, which was eventually performed at Amiens on 6 June 1329.227 It might have seemed appropriate to Edward III that in turn the abbey's own sequestered revenues should be used to help pay for his father's tomb: £1,521 would have gone a long way towards this.228 But there was another reason why Fécamp might have made a contribution: this was the close connection which had existed between England and the abbey since the time of Edward the Confessor, who had been a generous benefactor to the abbey, including granting it land in Sussex.229 The monks of Fécamp had retained their interest in Edward the Confessor and England and in about 1308 had installed stained glass depicting the lives of St Louis and St Edward, possibly to mark the marriage of Edward II and Isabella at nearby Boulogne.230 If they were interested in Edward II at the beginning of his reign, perhaps they were still interested in him after his death. This is of course highly speculative and there is no proof of any of these suggestions. Nonetheless a link between two famous Benedictine abbeys, one in Normandy and the other in Gloucester, remains an intriguing possibility.\n\nHOW DID EDWARD II DIE?\n\nThe sources are generally in agreement that Edward died on 21 September 1327 and at Berkeley castle, with the exception of some versions of the Brut chronicle which place his death at Corfe castle in Dorset.231 There is however a much wider variety of explanations for his death.232 Some sources recorded simply that he died, but made no attempt at any further explanation; one that he died naturally; others that he died of grief; others claimed that he was murdered, but without much elaboration; and a final category had the lurid red-hot iron story. The first group includes the initial announcement of his death during the parliament assembled at Lincoln in September 1327; the Annales Paulini say no more than that he died at Berkeley and was buried at Gloucester;233 the short annals composed at the Cistercian abbey at Newenham near Axminster in Devon in the early 1330s say only that Edward died and lay at Gloucester;234 the Canterbury chronicle says that Edward ‘Migravit ad Christum’ at Berkeley and was buried at Gloucester;235while the author of the Wigmore chronicle went out of his way to insist that Edward died a natural death, whatever was said to the contrary.236 Other examples could also be given, although some express doubt.237 The shorter continuations of the French Brutchronicle, ending in the early 1330s, use language which suggests that Edward died of grief but which might also be taken to mean that he died in pain.238 The Anonimalle Chronicle, another continuation of the French Brut, says simply that Edward became ill and died.239 But there were also doubters. Adam Murimuth, another writer connected with St Paul's, who wrote his final account twenty years after the event but was certainly working from much earlier notes, was shrewd and generally well informed; he was also the administrator of the vacant diocese of Exeter when Edward died and so not a great distance away. He too said that Edward died at Berkeley; but then added that it was commonly said that Edward had been murdered ‘by a trick’;240 later when writing of Mortimer's execution in 1330 he says that Mortimer was accused of having Edward suffocated.241 The Lanercost chronicler hedged his bets, saying that Edward died either naturally or through the violence of others;242 the author of the Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon, writing at Bridlington in the 1330s, noted that he did not believe what was then being written;243 an annotation in the Peterborough chronicle records that ‘Edward was in good health in the evening but was found dead on the morrow’;244 and the French chronicle of London remarked that he was ‘vilely murdered’.245 Some writers were more specific as to the mode of death. Strangulation was cited by the Lichfield chronicler,246 while suffocation combined with the insertion of a red-hot iron into Edward's bowels was offered by a number of writers. This appears in the longer continuations of the Brut chronicle;247 Ranulph Higden's Polychronicon;248 the Chronicon of Geoffrey le Baker;249 the chronicle of Meaux abbey in Yorkshire;250 and in Henry Knighton's chronicle written at Leicester;251 one version of the Brut adds that Edward was first of all drugged while he sat at dinner before being killed.252 Through the sheer horror of the account and by dint of repetition the red-hot iron has become the classic explanation of Edward's death.\n\nThere were also plenty of suggestions as to both the instigators and the actual murderers. The author of the Historia Roffensis, in recording that Thomas Gurney brought the news of Edward's death to Lincoln, spoke volumes when he described Gurney as ‘the follower of Satan’ and added that Edward had died while in the hands of enemies who had long planned to kill him, ‘saying we shall put him to a most shameful death’.253 John Maltravers and Thomas Gurney were named as the killers by Adam Murimuth, theBrut, and Geoffrey le Baker, among others; the Brut added that they were acting on orders received by Thomas de Berkeley from Roger Mortimer; Geoffrey le Baker claimed that Berkeley was deliberately kept away from Edward because he was too kindly disposed towards him,254 but that the orders for Edward's death were sent by Isabella through the medium of a deliberately ambiguous message composed by Adam Orleton, the bishop of Hereford.255\n\nIt is possible that Edward did die a natural death. Although he was described as a man of outstanding strength,256 there is no way of knowing his physical condition during the time of his imprisonment at Kenilworth and Berkeley and how far he was affected by confinement and possible ill-treatment. However, the mental condition of a man who had so recently been in a position of power with all the trappings of royalty and was now separated from family, friends and dignity is likely to have been very poor. It is easy to believe that Edward was deeply depressed by September 1327.257 If there were any underlying physical illness as well this might have been enough to bring about or accelerate his death. However, nearly all the references to a natural death or death from illness come from soon after Edward's presumed death and before new information came to light or other explanations had time to be elaborated. It seems more likely that he was murdered, probably by suffocation, and with the intention of leaving no outward mark on his body. A violent death, allegedly accompanied by the dying screams of the victim, is at odds with such a plan. The gruesome story of the red-hot iron may be true, or simply be a dramatic way of accounting for Edward's death from a painful illness. But it is also possible that it was a later addition: once the story began to circulate it quickly took on the status of undisputed fact. It has been plausibly argued that the story, with its implications of anal rape, was developed later as propaganda by his enemies, specifically in order to blacken his reputation still further258 and probably also to counter any attempts to portray him as a potential saint.259 There is also a parallel, which may be significant, between this story and the twelfth-century chronicle accounts of the murder in 1016 of an earlier English king, Edmund Ironside.260\n\nThere is no definite evidence of any initial suspicions about the manner of Edward II's death. As already mentioned, it is known that the woman who eviscerated Edward's corpse visited Isabella at Worcester a few days after the funeral. This could be interpreted as Isabella wanting to know more about the manner of her husband's death, either because she had a guilty conscience or because she suspected foul play; or the purpose may simply have been for her to receive Edward's heart.261 Although it is impossible to prove that Isabella had nothing to do with her husband's death, one part at least of the accusations against her can be rejected. The ambiguous message allegedly sent to Edward's gaolers on her behalf by the bishop of Hereford was pure fiction, since the bishop was not even in England at the time and so could not possibly have done this. A similar literary device has been traced via the St Albans chronicler Matthew Paris writing in the mid-thirteenth century to the early thirteenth-century French chronicler, Alberic des Trois Fontaines, who recorded a message allegedly written in 1213 by the archbishop of Gran/Ezstergom in Hungary, instigating the murder of Queen Gertrude the wife of Andrew II of Hungary: Reginam interficere nolite timere bonum est.262\n\nIt was not until the fall and execution of Roger Mortimer in October–November 1330 that Edward's death was first publicly described as murder and that anyone was named as responsible. In the indictment laid before parliament in November 1330 Mortimer was accused of having Edward moved from Kenilworth to Berkeley castle where he was ‘traitorously, feloniously and falsely murdered and killed by him and his followers’.263 Two of these followers, Thomas Gurney and William Ogle or Ockley, were also judged guilty of the murder of ‘King Edward, the father of our present lord the king’ and sentenced to death in their absence.264\n\nTHE PRISONER AT CORFE\n\nThe execution of Roger Mortimer and the conviction of Ockley and Gurney were the continuation and climax of another drama which had been working itself out since 1327. No sooner had Edward II been buried than tales began to circulate that he was not dead after all and that someone else was buried in his place. The usual cast of fantasizing friars reappeared on stage, together with former friends and allies of the departed king, and at least some leading magnates.\n\nOn 16 March 1330 Edward II's half-brother, Edmund of Woodstock the earl of Kent, was brought first before Robert Howel, the coroner of the king's household, and then before the magnates who were assembled in parliament at Winchester. After interrogation by Howel and Roger Mortimer Edmund made a remarkable confession: that the pope had asked him to free the former king from imprisonment, offering to pay the costs of doing so; that a Dominican friar from the London convent had come to him at Kensington near London and told him that he had raised the devil, who had told him for certain that the former king was still alive;265 that William Melton, the archbishop of York, sent Robert de Taunton, one of his chaplains, to him with an offer of £5,000 to aid in Edward's delivery. In a long and circumstantial confession Edmund gave the names of a number of people who he said were also involved, who believed that Edward was still alive and wanted to see him freed: four knights, Ingelram Berenger, William de la Zouche, John Pecche and Fulk Fitz Warin; William de Cliff; Hugh Despenser; two Dominican friars, Edmund and John Savage, who were ‘out of their order’;266 and the bishop of London. On a journey to France he had met Sir Henry de Beaumont and Sir Thomas Roscelyn in the chamber of the duke of Brabant, the former Edward II's nephew. The two exiles had said they planned to launch an invasion of England via Scotland, with the aid of Donald, earl of Mar. A Cistercian monk from Quarr abbey on the Isle of Wight had also arranged a barge to bring Edward and Edmund from Corfe to Arundel castle, and from there to wherever they decided. Edmund also admitted that he had written to Sir Bogo de Bayouse and Sir John Deveril concerning Edward's release from captivity.267 The lengthy account of the affair in the Brut chronicle appears to be based in part on Edmund's confession, but it adds that certain Dominicans had told him not just that Edward was alive but that he was being held by Thomas Gurney in Corfe castle, whose constable was John Deveril.268 When approached by Edmund, Deveril had admitted to him that he had Edward in his custody but was under strict orders not to allow anyone to see him. Edmund gave Deveril a letter addressed to his brother in which he promised to release him and claimed that he had the support of many prelates, earls and barons. Deveril betrayed him and took the letter directly to Roger Mortimer.269 The earl of Kent's confession was then repeated before a deputation of peers attending parliament. The result was a foregone conclusion, and the earl was executed outside the gate of Winchester castle on 19 March, but only after a delay in finding someone willing to perform the execution.270\n\nA month later it was the turn of William Melton, archbishop of York, who was interrogated before the king and his council at Woodstock on 23 April and again at Banbury on 30 April. Melton was charged that on 10 October 1329 a certain William de Kingsclere had come to him at Sherburn, ‘announcing to him and emphatically asserting that Edward, the late king of England, the father of the present king, was alive and in good health in the prison of Corfe Castle and asking him if he would furnish any advice or help in releasing him’. Melton had allegedly replied that he would have sold all his goods and chattels, except for a single vestment and a single chalice, in order to bring this about. It was claimed that Melton had then sent William de Kingsclere to Scotland to obtain the assistance of Donald, earl of Mar, who replied that when he was notified by the archbishop he would enter England with an army of 40,000 men. The archbishop denied all the charges and was to have been tried before Henry le Scrope, together with the bishop of London and William, the abbot of Langdon in Kent.271 These three men, William la Zouche ‘and many others’ petitioned the king during the parliament of November–December 1330 on the grounds that John de Haltby from Ipswich and Martin Love had tried to implicate them in the rebellion of the earl of Kent,272 and the proceedings ended abruptly on 12 December 1330 when Edward III ordered the justices not to take any further action since he held the archbishop completely guiltless of adherence to Edmund of Woodstock.273\n\nIn the end the only person to suffer death for his adherence to the alleged plot was the earl of Kent himself, and he won little sympathy because of his past behaviour and that of his followers.274 William Melton's clerk Robert de Taunton and various unidentified Dominican and Carmelite friars were put into prison;275 the provincials of the two orders, the distinguished scholar Simon de Boraston and John de Baconthorpe, may have been exiled for a time;276 and four knights, Fulk Fitz Warin, John Pecche, Ingelram Berenger and George de Percy, had their lands seized as the earl's adherents.277\n\nIt is easier to construct some kind of narrative than to explain exactly what was going on in 1330; to what extent those engaged in the plot really believed that Edward II was still alive; or whether they were simply entrapped by their own wishful thinking and by Mortimer and his agents; or whether they used the opportunity to further their own political agendas. An element of all these was probably involved. Part of the explanation was certainly the activities of friars concerned to demonstrate their continued loyalty to the former king, prepared to clutch at any straws and to persuade others of the truth of their stories. If Thomas Dunheved himself was no longer alive to lend his own special brand of fanatical loyalty, then other friars certainly did so. Several of the names of those identified by Edmund of Woodstock in his confession are men who had been connected with the Younger Despenser before 1327: Sir Ingelram Berenger was a former Despenser retainer; William de Cliff a chancery clerk had also been a Despenser adherent;278 the Carmelite Richard de Bliton had been the Younger Despenser's confessor;279 and Hugh Despenser was the son and heir of the Younger Despenser who had defended Caerphilly castle during the siege of 1326–7. Then there were the old and loyal friends of the former king, William Melton the archbishop of York, Stephen Segrave the bishop of London and William abbot of Langdon. All of these groups were hostile in varying degrees to the regime of Mortimer and Isabella.280 Particular attention has been drawn to the possible role of Sir John Pecche, one of the knights implicated by the earl of Kent. It has been suggested that he was in a position to know whether or not Edward II really was alive and being held at Corfe, since he had been constable of the castle.281 Pecche had been appointed as constable in December 1325 but it is not clear when he left office. He and his wife were made attorneys prior to going overseas in February 1327 and again in February 1328.282 Whether he did go overseas or not is unknown but it is very unlikely that he remained as constable until 1329, as has been argued.283 John Maltravers was formally appointed as constable in September 1329, but was already described as keeper in the previous month, while there is evidence that he was also at Corfe in or about September 1327.284 This suggests that he may have replaced John Pecche much earlier than the date of his formal appointment. Earlier in his career Pecche had had associations both with the Younger Despenser and, interestingly enough, was also acquainted with the Dunheved family;285 Pecche and Fulk Fitz Warin, another knight named by the earl of Kent, had also played an important part in the war against the Mortimers in the Welsh March in 1321–2.286 Far from knowing that Edward II was alive and well in Corfe castle, Pecche may have been as much influenced by rumour and disinformation as anyone else.\n\nAnother source of hostility was Henry, earl of Lancaster. Although Lancaster and his son-in-law Thomas Wake had helped to orchestrate the events which led to Edward II's deposition in January 1327, and he had apparently willingly acquiesced in Edward's transfer from Kenilworth to Berkeley in April that year, tension between him and Mortimer was increasing. This arose in part from the peace treaty with Scotland in 1328 to which he was bitterly opposed, together with others such as Henry de Beaumont who had claims to lands in Scotland; but it also stemmed from the growing influence and arbitrary behaviour of Roger Mortimer. Mortimer's power, symbolized by the title of earl of March which he was granted in October 1328, exceeded even that of the Younger Despenser against whom he had fought in the closing years of Edward II's reign. In the summer and autumn of 1328 the situation deteriorated so far that Lancaster began raising an army; among his sympathizers were the former king's two half-brothers, the earls of Kent and Norfolk. Open conflict was avoided and most of the rebels were pardoned, with the exception of Henry de Beaumont, Thomas Wake and Thomas Roscelyn who were forced into exile and fled to France.287 It was deeply ironic that some of those who invaded England with Isabella and Mortimer in 1326 were once again abroad and plotting, this time Mortimer's downfall.\n\nThere is a hint of things to come as early as November 1328 when the earl of Lancaster wrote to the mayor of London telling him that the earl of Kent had made certain communications with him, which he could not put into writing but which the bearer would report by word of mouth. Although it has been suggested that these concerned rumours that Edward II was still alive and that Lancaster was implicated in the earl of Kent's plot,288 this probably indicates no more than a growing sympathy between the two earls. The earl of Kent did however go to France in June 1329 on royal business connected with the canonization of Thomas of Lancaster289 and it was evidently during this period that he contacted the Lancastrian exiles living in Paris as well as visiting Avignon.290 If the account in the Brut is to be believed, Edmund told the pope that he thought his brother Edward was still alive. Although this account then says that the pope gave Edmund encouragement in releasing his brother from captivity,291 it seems unlikely that the pope would have committed himself to such a rumour: it is more probable that he fobbed Edmund off with polite words, but no more. In fact John XXII appears to have been profoundly embarrassed when he discovered that Edmund had engaged in a plot, and when John Walwayn, canon of Salisbury, came to Avignon in 1330, shortly after the execution of the earl of Kent,292 he expressed his unease very forcibly and made it clear that he did not and never had believed that Edward II was still alive. On 5 September 1330 the pope wrote to both Isabella and Edward III, thanking them for the news that John Walwayn had just brought and expressing his amazement that the earl of Kent could have asserted that the pope believed something so incredible: ‘that he for whom such solemn funeral ceremonies had been held was alive’.293 The pope added that he believed firmly that those who were present at the funeral were not deceived and did not attempt to deceive. If the funeral had been secret, there might be some justification for the report, but as it was held in public there was none. Had the pope believed such a report, he would have dealt not with the earl of Kent or anyone else, but with the queen and her son concerning the restoration to liberty and the production in public of the man said to be alive.294\n\nThe pope had not believed that Edward II was still alive in 1330 and, just as significantly, some of the chroniclers did not believe it either. The author of the Lanercost chronicle expressed his amazement that the Dominican friar who began the rumour, or indeed any educated person, should have believed the devil, the father of lies;295 while Geoffrey le Baker remarked that the whole thing was false and a fantasy.296 Roger Mortimer and his agents must have learned of the existence of rumours being spread by certain friars and had then used them to entrap their enemies.297\n\nTHE END OF ROGER MORTIMER\n\nMortimer's success in snaring Edmund of Woodstock contributed to his own downfall only a few months later. Edward III was furious and ashamed: he had been very reluctant to order the execution of his uncle Edmund of Woodstock and had done so only under great pressure, from both his mother Queen Isabella and from Mortimer.298 There were other reasons for what followed but it is likely that the death of the earl of Kent was the last straw for the eighteen-year-old king. Mortimer and his mother between them had usurped the power which was rightfully his as king; they had bankrupted the treasury; humiliated him in his first and unsuccessful campaign against the Scots in 1327; imposed upon him a hateful treaty with the same enemy and, without his approval, married his sister Joan to David Bruce, the son and heir of Robert Bruce;299 and there was also the question of relations with France. With the aid of one of his most trusted followers, William de Montacute, Edward began to plot the overthrow of Mortimer. In early September Mortimer and Isabella moved, with Edward III, to Nottingham castle. Despite Mortimer's suspicions of a plot against him, Edward III and his supporters held their nerve, and on 19 October Montacute and a group of armed men entered the castle by an underground passage during the night and placed Mortimer under arrest.300 The following month Edward III gained his revenge. Mortimer was indicted before parliament for the murder of Edward II at Berkeley castle in September 1327 and for other crimes, was duly convicted, and was drawn and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November.301\n\nPUNISHING THE GUILTY\n\nSeveral of Mortimer's followers were dealt with at the same time. Simon de Bereford was convicted of aiding and abetting Mortimer in all his crimes;302 William Ockley and Thomas Gurney were convicted of the murder of Edward II;303 and two others, the Yorkshire knight Bogo de Bayouse and John Deveril, who had been at Corfe when the earl of Kent tried to find the former king, were both found guilty of the earl's entrapment.304\n\nHowever, neither of Edward's former keepers at Berkeley castle, John Maltravers and Thomas de Berkeley, was charged with responsibility for his death. Maltravers was instead sentenced to death in his absence for his alleged leading role in plotting against the earl of Kent. He was charged with knowing that Edward was dead but not with his murder.305 Thomas de Berkeley was present in parliament and must have known in advance that it was reasonably safe for him to be there, since he was treated quite differently. He may have been encouraged by the fact that his son Maurice de Berkeley and Thomas de Bradeston, a royal household knight but with Berkeley connections, were among the conspirators who had arrested Roger Mortimer on the night of 19–20 October.306Thomas de Berkeley accepted that Edward had been delivered into the safe-keeping of himself and John Maltravers at Berkeley, and that Edward was murdered there while in their custody, but said that ‘he was never an accomplice, a helper or a procurer in his death, nor did he ever know of his death until this present parliament’.307 He also claimed that when Edward was murdered he was absent from the castle at Bradley and was so ill that he could remember nothing of what took place. When he was asked why he did not take better care of the king, he replied that he had appointed other keepers and officials to act in his place, and again denied any part in Edward's death. On 20 January 1331 a jury of twelve knights appeared before the king in parliament and declared that Thomas de Berkeley was not guilty of any part in Edward's murder, that they believed that he had been ill, that Thomas Gurney and William Ockley had been acting in his place, and that they had carried out the murder. The king was evidently not fully convinced, since Berkeley was left in the custody of the steward of the royal household to await a decision on his fate at the next parliament.308\n\nThe jury which advised Edward III on the guilt or innocence of Thomas de Berkeley was no ordinary body of county knights attending parliament, but included well-connected and experienced men, such as the royal household bannerets Roger Swynnerton, John D'Arcy and John de Wisham (seneschal of Gascony from 1324 to 1327; and currently justice of North Wales), and a royal household knight, William Trussell (who had formally renounced the community's homage to Edward II in January 1327).309 Such men knew perfectly well that anyone who had committed treasonable acts could expect no mercy: if they had disbelieved Berkeley's story, there is little doubt that they would have said so.310 But the men who were best placed to tell the jury and the king about Thomas de Berkeley's guilt or innocence were William Ockley, Thomas Gurney and John Maltravers, who were not to be found, having already fled the country each with a sentence of death and a price on his head hanging over him.311\n\nTHE EXILES\n\nNothing was heard again of William Ockley and his fate remains a mystery. Maltravers could in principle have gone to Ireland, where his younger brother Edward held the valuable family manor of Rathkeale in Co. Limerick, but he would have been far too conspicuous there and would have invited arrest by the royal authorities.312 Instead Maltravers and Gurney, who both had close family connections with the south-west of England, probably escaped to the continent from the small Cornish port of Mousehole, with the aid of two local men, Benedict Noght and John le Taverner. The authorities believed that these two remained in contact with Maltravers and Gurney after their escape and continued to supply them with food and arms.313 Even this was not the end of the story. Maltravers appears to have gone to the Low Countries, where he had spent a previous period of exile after 1322, and worked hard at rehabilitating himself by acting as an English agent at the time when Edward III was busily building alliances there against France.314 In 1332 Maltravers's wife Agnes went abroad, allegedly on pilgrimage but probably in order to join her husband. In 1334 Maltravers contacted Edward III because he ‘was desirous to reveal to him many things concerning his honour and the estate and well-being of the realm’. It is likely that he wished to tell what he knew about the death of Edward II, with which he had not been charged but about which he certainly knew more than was good for him. William de Montacute, the same knight who had been instrumental in the overthrow of Roger Mortimer in 1330, was sent to the continent to meet him.315 If Maltravers did tell his side of the tragedy of Edward II, no record has survived but, as will appear, it is likely that his evidence was closely linked with the exoneration of Thomas de Berkeley in 1335.316 In 1339 Maltravers was granted a life annuity of £100; in 1342 his wife was authorized to stay with him for as long as she wished; in 1345 Maltravers submitted to Edward III in Flanders;317 in 1351 he was pardoned and eventually returned to England, where he died in 1364.318 Even more extraordinary than the real-life story of John Maltravers is the outside possibility that he was so well known in the Low Countries as an Englishman who had fled his country after being involved in the death of a nobleman that he became an inspiration for the fictional English knight, Sir John Mandeville, the hero of one of the most widely read works of travel literatu"
