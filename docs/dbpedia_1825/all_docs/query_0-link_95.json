KENTISH DISTRICT TIMES COMPANY, LTD., HIGH STREET, ELTHAM. 1909. THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. PREFACE. HE chapters which go to make up this book are the outcome of a number of simple addresses which the writer had prepared to interest the older children of his school in the history of their ancient village. It was suggested that these addresses might be re-written and amplified for the benefit of \" children of older gro-wth,\" and thus came about their publication in >weekly instalments, in the local Press, for the space of twenty months. It is in response to a very general request from all sorts and conditions of readers, not only of Elthain, but of the neighbouring districts, that the chapters are now presented in book form. It has been the aim of the writer to tell simply and clearly the story of a jyillage that is brim full of historic interest, .to recount as vividly as may be the many romantic incidents that have been associated with it, and to recall from the depths of the past, the noble and distinguished personages, who, from time to time through the long centuries, have trod our Eltham fields and lanes, and helped to make our village story. Local historians do not always recognise sufficiently that each village, however small or remote, has played and is playing its part in the greater drama of national history. Nevertheless, it is the fact which makes the investigation of local history a matter of great importance in any scheme of historical study. The Church, the Manor, the Tithe Barn, the Parish Records, the Cross, the Field names, the Lanes, the Pound, and many another old-time relic, all have their tale to tell of the life and progress of the village community, and very often reveal the part which it has played in the nation's destinies. Eltham's r61e in this respect has been a notable one, so, as opportunities have arisen, the writer has taken advantage of them, to get glimpses, from the village stand-point, of passing national events, of the changes in manners and customs, and other circumstances which seemed to lend an interest to the narrative. The general plan of work is shown by the table of contents. The parish pos- sesses antiquities of a tangible character which date back to the earliest periods of history. These have been taken, as far as possible, in the order of their antiquity, and the story written round them. The Dover Road, the Common, the Manor, the Church, the Palace, and the many other landmarks are thus made to tell their own tale. This method of treatment seemed the most appropriate, not only from an educational point of view, but from that of the general interest of the casual reader. The self-imposed labour of research and writing which the book represents has occupied the leisure hours of upwards of four years. It has been a labour of love ; the result, however, would never have been obtained but for the kind help, encourage- ment, and advice, which have been so readily given by many old residents, and others, in Eltham and elsewhere, interested in the study of local history. Special thanks are due to Mr. F. W. Nunn, of Lee, a Vice-president of the Woolwich, and also the Greenwich, Antiquarian Society, not only for his personal assistance at the British Museum Library, but for his long and patient labours in the field of photography. With the exception of the plates that have been kindly and specially lent by Messrs. Macmillan and Co., for the purpose of this book, nearly all the photographs, whether from old prints and pictures, or originals, are the pro- duction of his camera, and represent the work of more than a year. Grateful thanks are also accorded to Dr. E. A. Baker, M.A., the Borough Librarian, and his Assistants at the Public Libraries of Eltham, Woolwich, and Plumstead, for their ready co-operation and advice in the use of the fine collection of Kentish records which the Borough possesses ; to Miss Lewin, who has herself kept records of Eltham for the latter portion of the nineteenth century, for much valuable information ; to Miss Bloxam, for many facts regarding the Palace; to Mrs. Dobell, for permission to photograph her copy of \"Hortus Elthamensis,\" for the use of her copies of the Sherard Letters, and for other assist- ance; to Miss May, of Avery Hill Training College, for her kind help in construing the old French poem of Froissart referring to Eltham, and published now in English for the first time; to Miss Moore, who also has made studies of Eltham history, for kind criticism and assistance ; to Miss Edith Anderson, also an enthusiastic student of local history ; to Mr. W. H. Taffs, our Eltham numismatologist ; to Mr. T. W. Mills, the Treasurer of the Eltham Charities ; to Dr. J. Jeken, a fifty year's resident of Eltham; to Mr. C. H. Athill, F.S.A. ; to Mr. W. J. Mortis, who, for upwards of half-a- century, held public offices in the parish, and whose local knowledge of the period is unique; to the Rev. T. N. Rowsell, former Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, for per- mission to quote extensively from his history of the \" Golf Club House \" ; to the Rev. E. Rivers, Vicar of Eltham, for permission to photograph the Parish Registers J to Mr. R. Whittaker Smith, Mr. W. B. Hughes, and Mr. W. G. Thame, for much useful information ; to Mr. W. H. Browning, for so kindly undertaking the compilation of the index ; to Mr. Geo. Bishop (Pope Street) ; Mr. T. H. Bartlett (The Gordon), and Mr. D. Waters (Mottingham), for information respecting their respective Schools; to the Rev. H. A. Hall (Holy Trinity), Eev. Father MacGregor (S. Mary's Roman Catholic), Rev. E. J. Penford (Congregational), Rev. A. C. Chambers (Baptist, Westmount Road), Mr. G. W. E. Dowsett (Wesleyan), and Mr. Alfred Smith (Baptist, Balcaskie Road), for notes respecting their several Churches ; to Mr. F. J. Furnivall, LL.D., for special permission to use the plate of \"Chaucer on Horseback\"; and to many others who have so kindly placed their knowledge at the writer's disposal. Novembei; 1909 R.R.C.G.

O a 3 i I o £ S H h O 8 a x TO THE YOUNG FOLKS OF ELTHAM \\V:TH MANY OF WHOM HE HAS HELD FREQUENT CONVERSE UPON THE TOPICS HEREIN DISCUSSED, THE WRITER DEDICATES THIS BOOK IN THE FERVENT HOPE THAT, EVEN IN THOSE DISTANT DAYS, WHEN THE YOUNG FOLKS SHALL HAVE BECOME THE OLD FOLKS, ITS PERUSAL MAY HELP THEM TO PRESERVE THE MEMORIES, AND TO CARRY ON THE TRADITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROMANTIC HISTORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM November, 1909. JULIUS C/ESAR (from a Copper Coin in the British Museum.) CHAPTER I. IN CESAR'S DAYS. The dwellers in Eltham hardly need to be reminded that the place in which they live, at one time a quiet Kentish village, has a very interesting history. Every place, of course, has a history of some sort, more or less interesting, when traced back to the beginning. But Royal Eltham has seen so many stirring times, has had so many great and interesting people associated with it, and has so much of its history written down in old books, and scattered about here and there in national records, that we may quite truly say there are few villages in the whole of England which can reveal a more romantic story. Though we may find, however, a great deal told us about Eltham in these old and musty records, and in books that are very learned, or very expensive, or very rare, it is doubtful whether one in a hundred of our young people will care to hunt for the story in those quarters, because old tomes are usually go tiresome to read, and need much patience to understand. So, it has been suggested that it would be a good thing to write the story of Eltham, right down from the earliest times, in such a way that even the children may read and comprehend ; and that it would be a particularly good thing to do so now, before the old village loses all its rustic features ; for, alas, its green fields are gradually disappearing, and its quaint buildings are being removed, one by one, to make way for modern needs. This, then, is the excuse for the follow- ing chapters. Now, it is quite likely, when you caught sight of the heading to this chapter, that you may have exclaimed, \" Csesar, indeed ! Surely Csesar never came to Eltham ! \" You are right. Ca;sar never came to Eltham, for when the Romans invaded the land, and subdued the Britons, Eltham had not come into existence. But it is very probable, nay, the probability is so great that we may regard it as a fact, that the great Julius himself, he who Brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill,— THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. passed with his victorious troops within the bounds of what afterwards became the parish of Eltharn. We will consider presently what grounds there are for such an assertion as this ; but, in the meantime, let us walk up the Well Hall-road, to the point where the great highway runs, right and left, past the Herbert Hospital, and over Shooter's-hill. Here we find ourselves face to face with something which the old Roman con- querors did for us, something that was so useful and so permanent that it has remained to this day, a memorial of their industry and skill. That something is the fine road itself, the Old Dover-road, which runs straight from London to the sea. For more than eighteen hundred years this old road has been a highway for traffic ! What a tale it might tell us if it could only relate the many great events of history with which it has been associated ! In the course of these chapters we shall have to consider some of those events — the most im- portant of them. To tell the whole tale of the Old Dover-road would need a book all to itself. That is not our purpose. For the present, our attention is directed to Caesar and the Romans, and their associations with what is now Eltham. As you know quite well, there were two Roman invasions. First of all, Julius Caesar came, 55 years before Christ, and again in the following year. He then went away with his host of warriors, only stopping just long enough to make it quite plain to the Britons that it was little use to resist the Roman arms. From the time of Julius Caesar's departure the Britons were not again molested by the Romans until a hundred years had passed, and the great Caesar and all the host that came with him had long been dead. Then, 47 years after Christ, in the time of another Caesar, came other Roman legions, and they conquered the land and made the Britons Roman subjects. It was after this second invasion that the old road on which we stand was constructed according to the ideas of the Roman engineers. Let us have a look at it, and see what history we can make out of it. In the first place you will notice how straight it is. As far as you can see, right to the top of the hill in one direc- tion, and beyond the Brook Hospital in the other direction it is almost a straight line. Now, fol- low it here upon this map of Kent. From Lon- don all the way to Canterbury it is perfectly straight. At Canterbury it breaks off at an angle where it runs south-east to Dover. That portion, too, is quite straight. Now let us examine this large map which shews all the Roman roads of Britain in thick black lines. Notice the directness of them all. Straight- ness, directness, this seems to have been one of the objects of those old road makers. You will notice, too, that the road is called Watling- street. How it came by that name does not appear to be quite certain. \" Watling \" is not a Roman name, and it must have been applied long after the Roman times. One authority tells us that it is a mispronunciation of the Roman name \" Vitellina Strata,\" which means \" Street of Vitellius,\" who, at the time of its construc- tion, was the Emperor of Rome. But this inter- pretation seems rather far-fetched. Another writer says that it is derived from the \" Wast- lings,\" but nobody seems to know who or what the \" Waetlings \" were, though it has been said that they were a \" craft,\" possibly \" basket makers,\" which is very likely. This we do know, however, that in Anglo-Saxon days it was called \" Weetlinga Street \" ; in the middle ages, it had become \" Watling Strete,\" and it has come down to us as \" Watling Street.\" Look at the length of it. Here is where it touches Eltham, you see. On it goes westward till it crosses the Thames a little above London. Then it strikes a north-westerly direction to St. Alban's, and on right through the midlands. At Gailey, which is a small village in Staffordshire, it branches off in two directions. The branch to the left crosses the Severn at Wroxeter, and then runs south. The right hand branch continues north-west from Gailey until it strikes Chester. It then takes a north-easterly course, passes Man- chester, and joins a continuation of Ermine- street at Aldborough. By a direct northerly course it thence intersects the Wall of Hadrian, winds through the Cheviots, crosses the Tweed just below Melrose, and eventually strikes the Wall of Antonine, at the head of the Firth of Forth. It is a great and noble road. Space it out by means of the compass and scale and you will find THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. that it is nearly 500 miles in length. You must not think, however, that all the roads made by the Romans were perfectly new at the time of their construction. Very often old British track- ways already existed, and, when convenient, the Roman road-makers would make use of these, merely re-modelling them according to Roman methods. Most of you remember how, a few years ago, the Woolwich Borough Council transformed the winding and rather narrow road from Eltham into the wide, straight, and up-to-date Well Hall-road. towards the sea the Cenimagni, from Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk, the Ancalites, from Berks and Wilts, the Cassi from Herts. They passed this way, bands of grim and fear- less fighters — chieftains, in rude chariots, painted blue, with scythes protruding from the axle trees, tended by horse and foot, some bearing blue-stained shields, some wearing plumed hel- mets, many with their bodies stained with woad, armed with pike, or dart, or broadsword, or with that terrible three-pronged spear, the trident — all pressing onward to foregather on the coast, BRITISH WAR CHARIOT, SHIELD AND SPEARS. In a similar way, the Romans, when it suited their purpose, brought the old British track- ways \" up-to-date,\" and this is what actually happened to the highway here. It is the opinion of antiquarians that, even before the first coming of Julius Csesar, a British road ran from London to Dover, upon the line of the present Old Dover- road. A knowledge of this fact makes the spot upon which we stand all the more interesting. When the news spread among the tribes that Csesar was coming, and that a vast fleet of Roman galleys was preparing to bring across from Gaul another host of warriors in greater numbers, and better prepared, than those who came a year before, it was along this primitive track that the Trinobantes, from Essex, hurried under the gallant Cassibelan, once more to dis- pute the landing of the invading host. You know the end of it. They were beaten. Many of the defeated Britons fled to the dense forests, many more retraced their steps along this old track way, hastening to get beyond the river before the Roman soldiers should overtake them. A few miles above London there was a spot where the river could be forded. It was towards this point that the trackway led, and thither hastened the retreating Britons, where they crossed the stream and, on the other side, fortified their position as best they could. Pre- sently came along the pursuing legions of Rome, led by the most famous of all Roman General* THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. — \" immortal Cssar.\" It was a well disciplined army that marched past this point, every man armed with the most effective weapons that civilisation could then devise, and trained in the art of warfare by the experience of a hundred fights under the most successful leader Rome had ever known. The Britons stuck great pointed stakes in the river to prevent the Romans from crossing, and the spot was known as Cowey Stakes for many years. But it was of little avail. The Roman Eagle triumphed, and it must have been along this trackway that the victors passed once more. It was the return of a victorious army, bearing with them the trophies of war, and many a wretched British captive fated to be dragged through the streets of Rome, to grace the tiiumph of the conqueror. So, although we cannot definitely say that thus and thus the things occurred, taking all matters into consideration, there seems to be sufficient evidence to warrant the presumption that this part of Eltham parish came within Caesar's line of march. ROMAN SOLDIERS. CHAPTER II. FROM AUGUSTA TO THE SEA. It is not from books only that we may read history. There are other means of obtaining information about the doings of our forefathers. The printer is a useful man, and by means of his art he is able to record, and to distribute broad- cast, the thoughts of men, wise and otherwise. But there have been occasions when a man with a pickaxe has revealed historical facts which all the books in the world had failed to recognise. If we walk about Eltham with our eyes open, our wits alert, and our thinking cap properly adjusted, we may perhaps pick up many a bit of history which has escaped the ken of other people. The works of Nature are an open book, and happy is he who knows how to read it. But the same may be said of those other works which are the result of man's art and industry. A few years ago some workmen were making a trench along Edgware-road for the purpose of putting down a telephone tube. In the course of digging the men who wielded the pick-axe and spade came upon the actual pavement of the Roman road, over which the pres-ent Edgware- road runs. It lay beneath some six to twelve inches of ordinary soil, which came below the wood paving and concrete of the present road. The Roman pavement \" was found to consist of large black nodular flints, weighing from four to seven pounds each, on a bed of rammed red- dish-brown gravel of thickness varying according to the inequalities of the clay surface below.\" In T. Codrington's book, dealing with \" Roman Roads in Britain,\" you will find the particulars of this interesting discovery, together with other information which the discovery revealed as to how the Roman road-makers did their work. From this, too, we may deduce some knowledge of the construction of the part of Watling-street upon which we now stand. We may safely say that it was paved, because it was the general custom of the Romans to pave the roads. Sometimes, too, the roads lay along embankments which were thrown up and pre- pared by great labour. Such embankments are 0 THE STORY OF EOYAL ELTHAM. still to be seen in some parts of the country. Most of them, however, have been levelled in the course of farming operations, or for the sake of the stone and other materials they contained. Sometimes the road had a causeway erected along its side. The methods of construction seem to have varied according to the needs or the re- sources of the locality, but the paving, the em- bankment, the causeway, and the directness of the course, were common features of the Roman roads in Britain. So we may almost imagine what this Old Watling-street was like after the Roman workmen had completed it. We might, perhaps, have said \" British \" workmen, for there can be little doubt that the Britons had to take their share in the labour. It is easy to think of the skilled work being done by the more experienced Roman workmen, and much of what we now call unskilled labour being done, under Roman direction, by the subjugated Briton. Before we go any farther let us have another look at the map. Let us see if we can make out any other interesting facts about those ancient times. Here is a modern map. It shews the great railways of England. Now look at those great trunk-lines. Where do they run to? They all run to one centre, and that centre is London. And why do they do this? The reason is, that London is not only the greatest city of England, but it is also the greatest mart, and the greatest port. Now here again is this other map, that of \" Britain in Roman Times.\" Look at those black lines indicating the Roman roads. What do you notice? Yes, you notice that, just as the great trunk railways run to London, or radiate from London, like the spokes of a wheel, so did those old Roman roads. Here is our own Watling-street, you see, whose course we have already described. Then there is Stane-street, running from London to Chichester in the south ; Ermine-street, frpm London to the north ; and that great highway, whose name seems to have been lost, which runs from London south-west as far as Exeter, and north-east into the Eastern Counties. There are six great roads, radiating from London as a centre. Does not that suggest to us that London must have been a place of considerable import- ance even in those remote days? That it was »o is also borne out by the fact that the Romans called the city Augusta, in honour of their Em- peror of that name. But, under the Roman rule, you may be pretty sure that London increased in importance, and as it did so, this very road, which now forms the northern boundary of Eltham parish, became of greater and greater importance. By an ex- amination of the map you will see that it was the direct course between London and Dover, and that was the nearest way to Gaul, which was the route to Rome. Rome ruled Britain through its Governors, somewhat in the way that Eng- land rules India at the present time. There were, however, no means of rapid communication —no telegraph, no railway. Imperial troops, imperial despatches, in fact every communication between the imperial rulers in Rome and the ruled in Britain, had to go by road, and the one great highway along which they travelled must have been this part of Watling-street. Now, the reading of history, even in a super- ficial sort of way, is a dull and dreary pastime, unless you exercise a little imagination ; so, stand- ing as we do now in this interesting part of Eltham, let us look back in imagination across the intervening nineteen centuries, and try to picture what those earliest Roman invaders saw when they passed this way. When immortal Caesar climbed the hill on the other side, follow- ing the old British trackway along which the Britons had but lately fled in hasty retreat, he looked out upon an expanse of country, even as we can look now. But the face of the country was very different. From suitable vantage points we may look down upon the slated roofs of Well Hall, and on to Eltham village, with its two spires pointing upwards ; further away in the hazy distance we may discern Sidcup and Chislehurst and other places, and in the intervening spaces cultivated fields and market gardens, or park-like meadows, characteristic of modern Kent. What Csesar looked down upon was an expanse of forest, con- sisting mainly of oak, ash, holly, or yew. There the red deer, wild oxen, and wild hogs found cover. The beaver and water fowl were com- mon to every stream, affording ready prey to such beasts as the wild cat, the wolf, and the bear. He probably saw but few natives, for, in the first place they were not very numerous. It THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. has been said that their number right through the country did not exceed two millions. In the second place, they were not likely to expose themselves to view, seeing that they had only recently suffered defeat. But the land was not all forest, nor were the \" wild wood wanderers,\" as the natives have leen called, quite the savages that they are sometimes described. There were clearings in the forests, where the natives cultivated their wheat, barley, millet, and even roots and fruit trees. They tilled the land with wheeled ploughs, and knew the use of loam and chalk as manures. Upon these open spaces might have been seen the primitive huts, circular, wattled, merchandise. Upon its banks are thickly-popu- lated towns, Woolwich, Greenwich, Deptford, and other places, now component parts of the great city of London, busy hives of men, from which arises the buzz of industry. Csesar looked oa no such scene as this. The old river was there, but it had not then been made to confine its waters within its banks. Far away to the right and left it spread itself out in swamps and lagoons. When the tide was up it covered the land for many miles, almost like a sea. When it returned the swampy islands revealed them- selves, and we may imagine that among its many channels, or over the surface of the main stream, the native fishermen plied their coracles, or ROMAN EAGLE. and thatched. It needs no great stretch of imagination to picture such a settlement here- abouts, in this sunny valley, say, below Shooters'- hill, where the natives kept their tiny breed of cows, and in those intervals of time, when the demands of agriculture were not imperative, worked at basket making, sending the hand- made articles to foreign markets for sale. The osier beds of the great river so near at hand would have supplied ample materials for the industry. An old Roman writer has recorded that basket making was peculiarly a British in- dustry, and that British baskets were exported to the Continent. Then, what about the prospect on the other side of the hill? There we free the Thames, with its procession of mighty ships bearing other primitive boats, in search of daily food. Well, may we say, as we survey the scene at our feet, \" Look on this picture — and on this.\" Then, after four hundred years, there came those last dramatic scenes, when Rome was humbled, and was obliged to withdraw her men from Britain, to protect their fatherland in Italy. Four hundred years is a very long time when compared with the usual span of a man's life. During those centuries of Roman occupation, immense changes had taken place in the con- dition of the people, their habits of life, their industries, their religion. Even the face of the land, too, had undergone a change. New towns had sprung up upon the great roads, new methods of building had been introduced. Roman villas were familiar objects upon the landscape. You THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. may see the floor of such a villa, in Greenwich Park, exposed to view at the present day, and it is quite within the bounds of possibility that some such Roman residences existed about here too. Who knows? But to Roman rule and influence there came an abrupt end. Rome was in danger. Home was the word. The exodus began. Along those great highways that converged upon London — the Augusta Trinobantum of the Caesars — there commenced the great retreat. And from Augusta to the sea, there passed, this way, the main bulk of those who were bound Rome-ward. Surely it was a tragedy which the old road witnessed in those last days of Rome in Britain; a tragedy of such a character that its ultimate effect was to- change the course of our National history.

Now, although Eltham is singularly rich in relics which are memorials of one or the other of the recognised periods of English history, we seem to have nothing left to us to look at — no old road, no old ruin that we can touch and say of it \" This was, certainly, the handi- work of those fierce fighting folk from over- sea, who came and settled here and first started Eltham and gave the place its name.\" But there is a stretch of land on the side of Shooter's-hill — \" Eltham Common \" — where the furze bushes grow, and where we have a right to take a stroll if we like; and there is the fact recorded in the encyclopedia, or the guide book, that \"Eltham is in the Hundred of Blackheath,\" and, moreover, there is the very name itself, \"Elt-ham\"; all of which associate the village with what we call ths \" Saxon period.\" Though these plain and obvious facts may seem rather dull and uninteresting, they are luminous enough, if we know how to use them, to throw a light across the long fifteen cen- turies and enable us to discern something of Eltham in the making. We need not dwell at any length upon the troubles endured by the Britons when their protectors, the Romans, had left them for ever. You may read all about that in your history 10 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. books— how the Jutes came o%er and landed in Kent to help the British to fight the barbar- ians from the north, the Picts and Scots— how, when they saw that the land was fair and fer- tile, these very Jutes turned against the Britons themselves and drove them out — how there followed fellow tribes of Jutes, and Eng- lish, and Saxons, who, landing on the eastern and southern coasts, continued the great strug- gle which lasted more than a hundred years, and did not cease until the Britons had been driven away westward into Cornwall and Wales, and the intruding tribes had estab- lished themselves in the land and laid the foundation of this nation of ours which we call England But, to get an idea of how Eltham came into existence we must know something of these fierce people who came with fire and sword and devastated the land, burning Christian churches, razing to the ground the beautiful Roman villas, and wiping out whatever was left of Roman civilization, for they were our forefathers, and it was they or their immediate descendents, who settled \" here about,\" and gave their settlement the name of Eltham. Let us have a look at them as they lived yonder on the bleak shores of the Baltic, for, by knowing something of their habits of life over there, we may better understand the new kind of social life they set up here — new, at any rate, to this land. They were a fine race of people, tall, fair- haired, gray-eyed, brave, and adventurous, and they lived together in clans or families. Note that fact particularly. Family life was the basis upon which their social system was built up. Each family lived by itself and took all the necessary measures for the benefit and protection of its members. Each little village community lived apart from all the others, and around it there lay a stretch of appropriated land, sometimes it was a broad belt of virgin forest, and some- times moorland, and this belt was called a \"mark.\" It was the boundary; and very jeal- ously was it guarded by the \" marksmen.\" A well-known writer says of it : — \" Whoever crossed the ' mark ' was bound to give notice of his coming by blowing a horn, or else he was cut down at once as a stealthy enemy. The ' marksmen ' wished to remain separate from all others, and only to mix with those of their own kin. In this primitive lore of separation we have the germ of that local independence and that isolated private home life which is one of our characteristics as a people at the present day.\" Can we wonder that tribes living like this found the rich wooded vales of Britain a great attraction ? Kent must have appeared to them as well suited for 'such a mode of life. There were wide clearings in the forests which had been already applied to farming purposes by the British, ideal spots in which to establish their villages communities. The temptation was irresistible. To secure so fair a laud was worth the sacrifice of blood. So hither they came, tribe after tribe. They fought and bled, but made thf> land their own. You may fairly ask, was the first settlement at Eltham early in the English conquest, or did it spring up in later years, when the coun- try had, to some extent, settled down ? But it is hard to fix the exact time. All that we can be sure about is that it came into exis- tence in Saxon times, but in which century is a matter of doubt, and will remain so until further evidence is brought to light to help us to decide. But let us try and picture the first beginning of a typical English village, and see to what extent the conditions may be applied to Eltham. A tribe of Angles, or Saxons, or Jutes, sud- denly swoop down upon a district and find that it will suit their needs exactly. If Britons are already in possession, out they have to go. There is a fight, may be, great shouts and the clash of arms. In the end, the Britons are driven away, or put to the sword, or made slaves. Then the new comers set to work to establish themselves. They destroy the Brit- ish huts, and construct others of their own, and after a while there arises a village of rude dwellings surrounded by a wooden stockade. Each family puts up a little homestead, con- sisting of a small wooden shanty, a court-yard, THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAJM. 11 and a cattle-fold, and the land upon which this homestead stands becomes their own. Here, you see, is the beginning of private property in land. The forest and pasture land outside the stockade become the common property of the community. Every householder can turn his stock upon it — his cattle into the pasture land, his pigs into the ring of forest. But to keep the too selfish person within bounds, and to be sure that he does not encroach upon the rights and privileges of his neighbour, and so, by an act of injustice disturb the harmony of the us as the \" common-land.\" Its uses have not been entirely diverted to other purposes. There are no Anglo Saxon buildings left to us. The early Saxons were not good builders. Their structures were mostly of wood. They wer& not of a character to last many years. So the hall of the headman, with the dwellings of the churls, and the huts of the serfs, have long since passed away. But we have Eltham Common still left to remind us of the conditions under which our ancient forefathers lived. In those rustic homes what an important per- son was the head of each family. The Eltham RESIDENCE OF A SAXON NOBLEMAN (from old M.S.) community, an officer is appointed to see that no man trespassses or turns more than his proper share of cattle into the common ground. Besides the woodlands and the common lands which belong to the tribe as a whole, a certain part of the land is set apart for tillage. Three large fields fulfil this purpose, one field being allowed to lie fallow each year. Every house- holder is allotted a portion of each of these fields, which he and his family are expected to cultivate. Eltham Common. Yes. Here we have what is left of the \" Common lands,\" set apart by the earliest Eltham community. Through all these long centuries it has come down to churl was, truly, the king of his household. He made the laws for the government of his- family, and he enforced them sternly, too. But. his duties were not limited entirely to his family. He had public responsibilities. As the head of a house, it was his right, and his duty, to attend the \" Moot,\" or Village Coun- cil, to help in the management of the affairs of the community as a body. Now-a-days we still have our \" Moot \" but it has a different name. Our fathers, or grandfathers, will recollect the village \"moot\" as the \" Vestry.\" In all country villages it is- now the \" Parish Council.\" Mottingham, for instance, has such a \" moot.\" But, as Eltham has been made part and parcel of Woolwich. 12 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. our \" moot \" goes under the dignified name of \" Borough Council.\" Indeed, our \" moot,\" at the present time, is resisting an attempt of the War Office to encroach upon our rights in the \"common land\" of Eltham. It would not be possible, in these times, for the head of every family to be a member of the \" moot.\" The number would be too large. So we elect special members to look after the business for us. Notice, however, that the electors are mainly composed of householders. Therefore, you will notice, our present system of local government is based upon those prin- ciples which were first applied by our adven- turous ancestors when they came over and took possession. We are considering these matters here because they had so much to do with \" Eltham in the Making,\" and, unless you keep them well in your mind you will never get a really intelligent idea of the history of Eltham, nor, indeed of the history of your country. In course of time, the families of the original communities increased, and branches of the old stock went farther afield and set up new communities. To enable these communities to act together in resisting a common foe, it is said that \" hundreds \" first came into exis- tence. A hundred families supplied a hun- dred warriors a chosen champion for each family. A writer says that \"these hundred families recognised a bond of union with each other, and a common inheritance, and arranged them- selves under one name, for a general purpose, whether for defence, administration of justice, or other reasons.\" The common name of the hundred was sometimes derived from that of some chieftain or from some tree or familiar place where it was the custom of the hundred to meet. For this district the meeting place was on that bleak open country now called Blackheath. So it was called the \"Hundred of Blackheath.\" If Eltham found its origin in the early period of the Saxon occupation, and it may have done, although we cannot be certain about it, we may picture in our minds a meet- ing of the hundred. On the appointed day. a hundred champions mounted their horses and proceeded to Blackheath, there to meet the acknowledged chief of the \" hundred.\" There they gathered about him. When he dismounted from his steed and planted his spear in the ground, each warrior in his turn touched the leader's spear with his own, in token of the compact that existed between them, and as a solemn pledge of loyal support. Then would they confer together, in their vigorous Anglo- Suxon speech. If a speaker said something that the meeting did not agree with, they made loud exclamations of dissent, but if they approved of what he said, they knocked together their spears as a sign of agreement. A hundred would meet somewhat in this way in its very earliest days. In course of time, as the population increased and the conditions of social life gradually changed, the work of the hundred increased more and more, and took in the trial of criminals, settlement of disputes, bargains of sale and such like matters. Then, in the course, of a long time, the \"hun- dred \" ceased to be known as a hundred fami- lies, but came to mean a hundred \"hides \" of land, and a division of a county, even as we recognise it now. It is said that Alfred the Great divided the land up into counties, hun- dreds, and tithiugs. It would, perhaps, be more likely that he took the ' hundreds \" as he found them, combined them to form counties, and divided them to form tithings. At any rate, we should bear in mind that in the first instance the \"hundred\" referred to \"persons,\" and, subsequently, the name got to be applied to \"land.\" It would be a satisfaction to be able to fix the eact date of the birth of Eltham. But, at present, it is a matter of doubt. The earliest records of the \" Hundred of Blackheath \" do not seem to mention Eltham. This suggests that the village was not in existence at the time. On the other hand, there is the \" com- mon land.\" There it is pointing distinctly to antiquity. Then there is the name. Elt-ham, by which it has been known from the begin- ning. \" Eltham \" is generally regarded as a modified form of \" Eald-ham.\" This is Anglo- Saxon, and, therefore, it would have been THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. 13 applied to the place by the stranger folk — the English. \" Eald \" means \" old,\" and \" ham \" is the same word as the German \" heim,\" meaning \" home.\" So, \" Eald-ham \" means \" Old- home,\" or \" Old place of abode.\" Does it not seem a little strange that the term \" old \" should have been used in the first place ? Why \"old \" ? The question gives rise to several interesting theories. One of these is that there was, originally only a residence here, perhaps a royal resid- ence. That in the course of years a village grew up around it, and it came to be named after the residence or \"old-home.\" This theory seems to fit in with the fact that we find no mention of Eltham in the earliest records of the \" Hundred of Blackheath.\" Another suggestion is that a British settle- ment may have existed here, and that when the Saxon came and founded a new colony, he named it \" old-place of abode \" as a conse- quence. Another theory casts a doubt upon the gen- erally accepted meaning of the name. It sug- gests that \" Eald \" may have been the name or the corruption of the name of some clan, and, as was often the case, the clan name was given to the place, just as Billing-ham is the \"home of the Billings,\" and Wokingham, is the \"abode of the Wokings.\" But there is uncertainty about it all. What we may be pretty sure of is that Eltham came into existence somewhere, in the misty past, long anterior to the coming of the Normans. When we tread the soft turf of the \"common land \" on Shooter's-hill, we may feel some satisfaction in being in direct contact with a relic of those distant ages, and, as we have been doing to-day we may find a pleasant exer- cise for our imagination in trying to estimate the possibilities and probabilities of what took place when Eltham was in the making. SAXON WHITE HORSE. GREAT SEAL OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. CHAPTER IV. WHEN ALWOLD WAS LORD. One of the earliest bits of really authentic written history about Eltham is to be found in Domesday Book, that remarkable document which was compiled by order of William the Conqueror, and completed about 1086, A.D. Here we are told that \"Alteham\" was held by Alwold under the King. \" Alteham,\" of course, means \" Ealdham,\" or \" Eltham,\" and we must suppose that the Norman scribe who wrote the name in this way, was not particu- larly good at the spelling of English. This was excusable, under the circumstances, so we may forgive him. Hut the statement thus set forth throws much light upon what had been happening in the ancient village. It reminds us of the many changes that had been taking place, in social life, since those very early days of \" Eltham in the Making,\" alluded to in the last chapter. Six hundred years had passed away since the Saxons first came and settled here. Six hundred years since Hengist founded the Kingdom of Kent, and during that long period many small Saxon kingdoms had risen, and existed for a time, to finally disappear, as by degrees they were all wrought into one kingdom and ruled by one king. When Alwold, the lord of \" Alteham,\" gathered his friends about him in his manorial hall, — for we may suppose that he had one, although no mention seems to have been made of it anywhere— when the ale was quaffed, and songs were sung, and the jests went round, if by chance the talk turned upon lore, and the doings of their forefathers, as it sometimes would, very ancient history must have seemed the beginning of England, just as to-day \" the Wars of the Roses,\" \" the Battle of Agincourt,'' or the Norman Conquest, seem to us very far away in the past. Alwold's over-lord was the King, Edward the Confessor. You know something about him, how he was a man of saintly character, living a strict religious life, and how, on account ot this, h« has been known ever since as Edward the \"Confessor.\" It was he who brought over the expert Norman workmen to build the beau- tiful abbey at Westminster. THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. 15 On a clear day we can see the old Abbey from our playground. It may be that the boys and girls of Alwold's days looked out from our Eltham fields at the distant Abbey, and watched it slowly rising up, or listened to their elders when they talked about its building. It may be, also, that a few of those older folk had some grumbles to make abeut the king's fondness for foreigners, and his bringing over these work- men to do his work. It is most likely, how- •ever, that complaints of this kind were only made in whispers, for was not Alwold lord of \" Alteham,\" and did he not hold \" Alteham\" under the king himself? We are apt to forget the children when we read history, unless they happen to be young princes or young noblemen. We are so taken up by the deeds of the heroes, and men of action, and noble ladies, that we think but little of the multitudes that made up England, and of the merry lads and lasses who were to be the future builders of the kingdom, just as you young folks of to-day will be the future citizens of the Empire. There were interest- ing boys and girls in \"Alteham,\" when Alwold held it under the King, just as there are inter- esting boys and girls now. But they lived under very different conditions. Let us give them a thought, now and then, when we con- eider those conditions. Who was Alwold? We do not know anything about him or his family. But we may assume that he was a rather important person, or the king would never have entrusted him with one of his own manors. He paid the king six- teen pounds a year for the use of the manor. It does not sound much in these days. But in the time of the Confessor, and for a long time afterwards, a pound was worth a great deal more than it is now, and sixteen pounds then was a good large sum. Alwold may have been a soldier, or a great hunter, or a statesman, or he may have been one of those \" lore thanes,\" as they called them, who, unlike thanes in general, were fond of study and the reading of books. The king was of this kind of habit. Alwold, who held \"Alte- ham \" under the king, may have been a man of his kind, too. We do not know. But as the chroniclers have not been good enough to tell us what sort of a man he was, there is no reason why we should not make a kind of fancy picture of him in our mind's eye. Imagine you see him, then, on a bright summer day, when the fields and meadows of \" Alteham \" were dressed in their fairest garb, riding forth from his huge wooden manor house, upon his favourite horse. He wears no covering to his head, save the natural covering of thick, fair hair, which hangs down to his shoulders; and a full, fair beard adds dignity to his intellectual face. He wears a red woollen tunic, which reaches to his knees, and around his waist is a leathern belt, untanned. Breeches of similar material reach to his knees, while the lower parts of his legs are clothed in linen hoseu, laced or bandaged with cross garters, called shank guards. His shoes are of leather, uutauned, and from his shoulders there is suspended a square mantle, which hangs in graceful folds behind. There! Don't you think our Alwold is a handsome fellow, as he sits easily his noble steed, which canters gracefully across the Alteham greensward? The Domesday scribe tells us nothing about the house of Alwold. But it was no uncom- mon thing for Domesday scribes to leave out all mention of a Manor House or a Church. Indeed the survey of Churches and Church- yards seems to have been outside the scope of Domesday Book. So, because we find no men- tion of a Manor House, nor yet of a Church, at \" Alteham,\" at that time, we must not jump to the conclusion that there was no Manor House and no Church. The probabilities are that there were both. And although Domesday really refers to the period immediately after the Saxon thane had gone, and a Norman Lord had taken his place, it may be taken to fairly represent the condi- tion of the village in the late Saxon times and Alwold's day. The social condition of the classes below that of the lord was not greatly changed at first, except in name. The \" ceorls \" were now called \"villans,\" the \" cottiers \" were \" bordars,\" and the \" thralls \" 16 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. were \"slaves.\" Otherwise the change was not so very great at first. Domesday says that ' Alteham \" answered for \"one suling and a half. There is the arable land of twelve teams. In demesne there are two teams. And forty two villans with twelve bordars have eleven teams. Nine slaves there. And twenty-two acres of meadow. Wood of fifty hogs. In the time of King Edward it was worth sixteen pounds. When he received it twelve pounds. And now twenty pounds. Alwold held it of the King.\" \" What queer words ! \" you will exclaim. They are old English words that have gone out of use. Let us read it again, giving, as near as we can the interpretation of those strange words. \" Alteham \" answered for, \" about 240 acres, for a suling was as much land as a team of eight oxen could plough in a year, together with the pasture land that was required for the feeding of the oxen. \" There is arable land of about 1,800 acres. \" In that portion of the land around the Manor and cultivated by the lord himself there are about 320 acres. \" There is nothing ' nllianous ' about the forty-two villans. They are called villans only because they live in the villa or village. They are respectable men, who are tenants of the lord, and farm the land of the manor, except the lord's own land, or demesne as it is called. They pay rent for their land to the lord, and sometimes, in place of rent, help in the tilling of the lord's land. They have to provide one or more oxen for the manorial plough. They are freemen, though they may not give up their farms without the special permission of their lord. \"The twelve bordars, are also called cottien, or cottagers. They sometimes had small allot- ments, but they kept no oxen. They helped in the cultivation of the lord's land, and also worked some days of the week on the farms. \"The nine slaves were attached to the lord's land. Their lot was not a happy one. They were of a class that were supposed to have de- scended from the British who were kept in thraldom. They were born in slavery, and generally died in that state. They were attached to the Manor, and were bought and sold with the land and cattle. They could be scourged and branded, as the lord pleased, and even if one was killed, the punishment was only a small fine. Saxons who were captured in war, or those who were unable to pay fines for offences committed, were often made slaves or serfs. Occasionally a lord would set a slave free. He would give him a lance or sword, and tell him that he was at liberty to go where he pleased. The slaves had to do the hardest work — they were the ploughmen, shepherds, and swine herds. So, from all this, we may picture in our minds what life in \" Alteham \" was like wheu Alwold was the lord. The great house, built of wood, low, one storied, and around it clus- tering the huts of the serfs who wait on the lord. Further afield the cottages of the vil- lans and the thralls — with mud walls and roofs thatched with reed. The great house of the lord has its hall and chapel. The hall is the principal apart- ment; it is there that Alwold feasts his guests. It has a fire in the centre and a smoke-hole in the roof, and on the clay floor rushes are strewn and changed from time to time. It is furnished with a heavy clumsy table set upon tressels, along the sides of which the guests sit upon benches and stools. What feasts they have, for these Saxon fore- fathers of ours, love eating and drinking. The table is covered with a cloth, and upon it are set the platters, bowls, dishes, horns, and knives. Swine's flesh is the usual meat, and when the joint is roasted, it is carried round the table on the spit, and each one cuts off a slice for himself. The usual vegetable is cole- wort, and the usual drink is ale, though a rich man may afford wine and mead. Table man- ners are sometimes rather slovenly. They eat and drink far into the night, and on very festive occasions through successive days and nights. As the flowing bowl is going its round, so also is the harp, which is handed from one to another, as each contributes his song to the minstrelsy of the evening. And when it is time to sleep, many of the men No. 13. PART OF OLD WALL— ELTHAM PALACE (1909). (From the Moat, South-East). No. 14. WATER GATE TO MOAT. South Side. ' f*< f.^ . ^ . \".- . .,.,. No. 15.

THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. 17 throw themselves upon mattresses in the hall, upon the floor. The lord retires to his bed, which is a sort of crib or trough filled with straw, with a coverlid of skin, and so they sleep off the effect of their carouse. But apart from their less praiseworthy habits, those ancient Elthamites, contrived to get a good deal of real enjoyment out of life. They lived a great deal in the open air, and their amusements were often found in such manly sports as running, leaping, wrestling, riding and fighting. There was plenty of hunting, hawking and fishing, for the lord could hunt on his own grounds, and boars, deer, hares, and even wild goats were some- times to be found. The tradesmen of the village were very im- portant persons then. The smith had to look after the iron-work of the ploughs, and to shoe the horses. Then there were the car- penter, the stone-mason, the constable, the steward of the manor, who had to look after the interests of the lord and the tenant, and among many others, that important person, the bee-keeper. Bee-keeping was a great business in those days, for you must remember that there were no colonies to send them sugar, and those who liked sweets had to depend for the luxury upon the bees. Moreover, was not honey wine sweet to the tooth of those old forbears of ours ? No wonder, the bee-keeper was an important person. The great blot upon the social life of the time was \"serfdom.\" Here is a little dialogue, written at the time by an old Saxon writer. Does it not bring the condition of the serf vividly before our minds ? : — \" ' What sayest thou, ploughman ? How dost thou do thy work ? ' \"'Oh, my lord, hard do I work. I go out at daybreak, driving the oxen to field, and I yoke them to the plough. Nor is it ever so- hard winter that I dare loiter at home, for fear of my lord, but the oxen yoked, and the ploughshare and the coulter fastened to the plough, every day must I plough a full acre, or more.' \" ' Hast thou a comrade ? ' \" ' I have a boy driving the oxen with an iron goad, who also is hoarse with cold and shouting.' \" ' What more dost thou in the day f ' \" ' Verily then I do more. I must fill th& bin of the oxen with hay, and water them, and carry out the dung. Ha ! Ha ! hard work it is, hard work it is ! because I am not free. ' ' Let us hope that the lot of the slaves- that were attached to the Manor of Alteham was happier than that of this poor thrall, see- ing that their lord was Alwold who held the Manor under the good king Edward FEAST AT A ROUND TABLE (Bayeui Tapestry.) WHEEL BED (Cotton M S.) THE SICKNESS AND DEATH OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR (Bayeux Tapestry.) CHAPTER V. THE SIGN IN THE SKY. The year 1066 was a fateful year for Eltham, as it was for the whole of England. In its earlier days the Royal House was over-shadowed by death, an event which had a direct effect upon the conditions of life in our village. Then, just after Eastertide, appeared the strange sign in the sky fore-boding the over- throw of a kingdom, and filling the hearts of men with fear. Summer brought wars and rumours of wars. The fall of the year wit- nessed the great fight and England stricken beneath the heel of a foreign foe, and, ere its eventful months had run their course, Eltham had passed into other hands, and Alwold was no longer to hold its Manor under the King. Surely, it was a terrible year, and it left its mark upon our history, national and local, as no other year has ever done. When the New Year was born, Edward the King lay dying. For many weeks he had bat- tled with disease. In those latter days he uttered strange words, and his people, filled with reverence and awe, declared that he had the gift of prophecy. On January 5th, 1066, the \" Confessor \" passed away. We may be sure that the folk of Eltham, especially Alwold, who held the Eltham lands of the King, were distressed by this event, for, though the English people were not well pleased by his liking for foreigners, Edward the Confessor was held, generally, in esteem and love by his subjects. He had been spared to see the completion of his own new Church at Westminster — the noble Abbey, which, with its additions, is the pride of all Englishmen to day. But he was too ill to be present at itf> consecration on December 28th. \"Holy Inno- cents' Day.\" A week or so later he died, and, the very next day, January 6th, they solemnly conveyed his body to the beautiful minster, and gently laid him to rest. There is something sad and pathetic about this incident, yet it seems consistent and beautiful that he, who conceived the building of that majestic edifice, who watched it lovingly through the years of its erection, should have been the first of that THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. 19 long array of kings and heroes who have beea buried within its walls. King Edward's death was the beginning of the end of Saxon rule in England, as it was the beginning of the end of Alwold's tenure of Eltham. There was a great gathering at the funeral, for that year the dead king had called to- gether the assembly of wise men — the Witan— in London, instead of at Gloucester as was usual, and immediately after the solemn cere- mony of interment was over — Professor Free- man says, that in all probability it was on the same day, — the Witan proceeded to elect a new king. Was Alwold of Eltham present on that occasion ? There is no record to say that he was, but, one can well believe that the Lord of Eltham, being so near at hand, whether he took part in the important deliberations or whether he did not, would not have been absent on an occasion which was fraught with so much of importance to Eltham and himself. The Witan selected Harold, the son of Earl Qodwine, and he was duly installed as King and the Crown lands of Eltham passed into his hands. But Harold had rivals for the King- ship. There were some Englishmen who thought the youthful Atheling, Edgar, had a stronger claim. But the Atheling was young and weak, and the Witan wanted a strong man. Tostig, the brother of Harold, also set up a claim, but the most formidable rival was Wil- liam, the Duke of Normandy. William declared that the Confessor had promised him the crown. But the Confessor had no legal power to do this. He also accused Harold of break- ing an oath that he had made to support the claim of the Norman Duke to the throne. But Harold said that the oath was obtained from him by unfair means, and was therefore not binding. And, after all, Harold's claim was the strong- est of all, for, not only was he specially recom- mended by the Confessor himself, before he died, as the most suitable man for the office, but he was duly and regularly elected by the Witan. In quaint language the old Chronicler of the time puts it thus :— \" Nathless, that wisest man, Dying made fast the realm To a high-risen man. Even to Harold's self, Who was a noble earl: He did at every tide Follow with loyal love All of his lord's behests, Both in his words and deeds: Naught did he e'er neglect What e'er of right belonged Unto the people's king.\" And he further says, \" Now was Harold hal- lowed as king, but little stillness did he there enjoy, the while that he wielded the kingdom.\" We may well imagine that the men of Eltham took their proper share in these national events, and it is quite likely that the Eltham ceorls, or villans, as Domesday Book calls them, who farmed the manor lands were amongst the crowds who assembled about the new minster to look upon the great men and to see what they could of the ceremonies. But notwith- standing that Harold, the great warrior and the wise councillor, had been made king, and most people seemed pleased, there was in the air a feeling of uncertainty, a feeling that something was going to happen. This feeling was increased and intensified by the appear- ance of a strange sign in the sky. It was a comet of unusual dimensions, and, supersti- tious as the people were, they were easily led to believe by those who thought they under- stood such matters, that this strange \" star \" with the monster tail which seemed to sweep the sky, was a portent sent to warn them that a terrible disaster was about to overtake the kingdom. When you read Tennyson's Play, \" Harold,\" which you should all do, you will see, in the first act, how the poet vividly describes the effect of this great; comet upon the terror- stricken people. \"It glares in heaven, it flares upon the Thames, The people are as thick as bees below, They hum like bees — they cannot speak — for awe; Look to the skies, then to the river, strike Their hearts, and hold their babies up to it. I think that they would Molochize them too, To have the heavens clear.\" 20 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. Aldwyth: Gamel, son of Orm, What thinkest thou this means ? Gamel: War, my dear lady ! * * * One of the pictures shown upon the Bayeux Tapestry is that of six men pointing fearfully \"towards a star which trails a rudely drawn streamer of light behind it.\" It is explained that \" These men are marvelling at the star.\" We do not marvel so much at comets now, and you will be interested to know that the comet which so alarmed the English in the spring of and had sailed up the Ouse to the City of York. Then Harold the King of England gath- ered around him his trusty men of London and of Kent and marched northward, and gave them battle. The invaders were routed, and Tostig and the giant Harold, King of the Northmen, were slain in the fight. This was on September 25th. Four days later Duke William of Normandy landed with an army in Sussex. \" While the Normans were yet at Pevensey, an English Thane had seen them land, and CORONATION OF HAROLD (Bayeux Tapestry.) 1066, is one which comes our way once in about every seventy-five years. They tell us that it will be here again in three years' time — in 1910. When it comes, if we are alive, we may be able to look upon it and think of Harold the King, and Alwold of Eltham, and the stirring scenes of those old days, but it is not likely to bode disaster, or to fill men's hearts with fear, as it did when it swept the sky eight centuries ago. But, as the Chronicler has told us, \"Harold had but little stillness\" during his short reign. The late summer brought the news that his brother Tostig, and Harold King of the North- men, had come to England with a great host. he went and mounted his horse, and rode northwards, and rested not day or night, where King Harold and his host were resting after their great fight. So the Thane came to King Harold, and said, ' My Lord O King, Duke William and his Normans have landed in Sussex, and they have built them a fort at Pevensey, and they are harrying the land, and they will of a truth win thy kingdom from thee, unless thou goest speedily and keepest thy land well against them ! ' \" And presently there came a churl also who had come from Hastings, and he told King Harold how that the Normans had marched from Pevensey to Hastings, and how THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. 21 they had built them a castle at Hastings and how they were harrying the land far and wide. \" Then King Harold answered and said, ' This is evil news indeed j would that I had been there to guard the coast, and Duke William never should have landed; but I could not be here and there too ! * So the King hastened with all speed to London.\" Now, would it not be interesting if we could only slip back, somehow, over those eight hun- dred and sixty years, and peep into some of the with him against the Duke of Normandy. Kent and all the southern counties quickly re- sponded to his call, and we may be sure that the men of Eltham were foremost amongst the men of Kent, for, apart from the patriotic spirit which was strong in men's hearts at that time, it must be remembered that Eltham was one of the Royal Estates, and Alwold would be expected to come up with his full force of fighting men. Yes, they had stirring times in the village for those few days. Harvest was over and men A SHIP OF THE FLEET OF DUKE WILLIAM TRANSPORTING TROOPS FOR THE INVASION OF ENGLAND (Bayeux Tapestry.) Eltham homes of the time — into the huts of the cottiers and the housen of the churls, and act- ually hear what the folk themselves had to say about all these happenings ? It is most likely that one would find those simple villagers full of gloomy forebodings. The strange star with the sweeping tail had gone away in the early summer, but they had not forgotten it, and in these risings against their lord the King, and in this coming of the Norman Duke, they saw, only too plainly, the realisation of the message brought by that awful sign in the sky. The King abode for some six or seven days in London, and word was sent forth bidding all men to gather under his banner and to march could be better spared. Every available horse was got out and made ready. What a busy man was the blacksmith ! There were coats of mail to put into order, shields and helmets to make good, to say nothing of the trappings of the horses, and the weapons for the men. Every axe, and sword, and spear, and bow, was brought out for use, and in every house that sent forth a fighting man there was all the bustle of preparation. In the old wall that bounds our Church-yard a stone is fixed, upon which is graven the names of those Eltham heroes, who, a few years ago, fell fighting for their Queen and country in far-off South Africa. It is right that we 22 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. should keep them in memory. The great Empire of which we are proud has been built up by the sacrifice of life and labour on the part of individuals. And we should remember that there is a long line of heroes whose names have never been recorded upon the roll of fame. The sturdy Eltham cottiers and churls, who, in those fateful days, strode forth to fight for King and Fatherland, who fought and fell at Senlac and never returned to gladden aching hearts in those simple Eltham homes, are of a great host who have kept aglow that fire of patriotism which has made the British nation what it is. You know well the story of the fierce fight at Senlac on Saturday, October 16th, 1066— the death of Harold and his great Earls fighting to the last, the rout of the English army, the triumph of William. It is a thrilling story. The English were defeated, but not disgraced. But it brought about a new order of things. Then passed Eltham into other hands, and Alwold the Englishman, goes out of the story. We know not whither he went, or what was his fate. And the new lords of Eltham were ^trangers who spoke a foreign tongue. BISHOP ODO, THE LORD OF ELTHAM MANOR, PRONOUNCING A BLESSING. (From an old Print). CHAPTER VI. THE WARRIOR BISHOP. Let us refer once more to Domesday Book. These are the words of the scribe: — \" Haimo holds of the Bishop, Alteham . . . .... In the time of King Edward it was worth sixteen pounds. When he received it twelve pounds. Now twenty pounds.\" Notice. There is no mention of King Harold. Domesday Book ignored his very existence as King. It was William's policy to impress up- on the English that Harold was an impostor, an adventurer who had no right to the throne at all. He wanted them to forget Harold and to recognise that he, William, was the only true successor to Edward the Confessor. So jou get no mention of Harold, the King, in Domesday. There is a stoi-y concerning the burial of Harold, which shews how relentless was the spirit of William in this respect. It is so beautifully and simply told by Professor Freeman, that we really must read it in his « ords : — \" The great battle being over, Duke William came back to the hill and stayed there all night. He had the dead bodies swept away around where the Standard had stood, and there he pitched his tent and did eat and drink. The next day he had the dead among his own men buried, and he gave leave that the women and people of the country might take away and bury the bodies of the slain English. Many women, there- fore, came and took away the bodies of their husbands and sons and brothers. Then the two Canons of Waltham, who had followed the Army, came to the Duke and craved that they might take the body of their founder, tmi \\ 24 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. King Harold, and bury it in his own minster at Walthain. And Gytha, the King's mother, also craved the body of her son She offered the Duke King Harold's weight in gold if she might have his body to bury at Waltham. But the Duke said nay; for that Harold was perjured and excommunicated, and might not be buried in holy ground. Now, there was in the Norman army one William Malet, a brave knight, who was in some way or other a kinsman or friend of King Harold's; so Duke William bade William Malet take the body of his friend and bury it on the sea coast, under a heap of stones, which men call a cairn. For Duke William said: 'He guarded the shore when living, let him guard it now that he is dead.' But no man could find the body, for it was all defaced and mangled, and it had been thrown aside when the bodies were cleared away for William's tent to be pitched. But there was a lady called Edith, whom, for her beauty men called ' Swanneshals,' or the Swan's Neck, whom Harold had loved in old times when he was Earl of the East Angles.\" She was able to point out the dead King, so they buried him under a heap of stones beside the sea. \" But after a while, when Duke William was crowned King of the English, his heart became milder, and he let men take up the body of King Harold from under the cairn, and bury it in his own minster at Waltham.\" There. We have read this story, although it is not exactly Eltham history, because it shews that hard, harsh nature of William which was responsible, among other things, for keeping the name of Harold out of the Domesday record. But for all that, Harold was not for- gotten, and to this day, in the memory of his countrymen, he stands for all that is noble and great in an Englishman. \" Haino holds of the Bishop, Alteham.\" The Bishop was Odo, a half brother of William. Let us consider some of the history of Odo, and see how it was that he became possessed of Eltham. When Odo was about twelve years of age he was made Bishop of Bayeux, which is a town in Normandy. Rather young to be a bishop, you will say, but we do sometimes read of foolish and inconsistent things in history. Odo has not left a very good name behind. He was ambitious and selfish. Indeed, his ambition led to his loss of Eltham, and, for a time, to his undoing. He is, how- ever, credited with one very good thing, and that is with getting the famous Bayeux Tapes- try made. If it had not been for this wonderful piece of needlework we should not have known so much of the Norman invasion of England aa we do. It is two hundred and fourteen feet long and twenty inches wide, and the pictures worked upon it represent scenes of the invasion and of the Battle of Hastings. There are on it six hundred and twenty-three persons, seven hun- dred and sixty-two horses, dogs, &c., thirty- seven buildings, and forty-one boats. It must have taken a long while to make, but one great historian says that it is the best and most re- liable account of the Conquest that exists. It is said that Odo had this work done for the ornamentation of his Cathedral Church at Bayeux. So we may give him credit for one useful piece of work, at least. When William decided upon the invasion of England, he had much trouble in persuading the Norman barons to join with him in the expedition. They did not like the idea. They thought it would be doomed to failure. But when William told them that if they helped him to success, he would divide amongst them the estates of the English nobility, they began to think better of the matter, and ultimately agreed to go with him. Odo, who was quite a young man at the time, was very active in bringing round the barons to William's side. So was Robert, his brother, and, of course, another half brother of Will- iam. Though Odo was a bishop, and a young one, he was a warrior, and well acquainted with, the ways of fighting men. It must have been a fine sight at Hastings to see this young bishop riding into battle. When the order was given to the Norman troops to advance, Will- iam the Duke rode at their head, and on one side of him rode Odo, on the other side rode Robert.

Odo did not carry a sword, because the laws of the Church forbade a priest to shed blood. But he wielded a heavy mace, and, when the right moment came, no doubt he used it pretty stoutly. He could not run his opponents through with a mace, but he probably did ser- ious damage to some of their skulls. It is recorded that at one moment of the battle, the Normans were getting the worst of it. The horsemen in retreating got into a fosse, or ditch, and rolled about, trampling up- on one another, and they were all a confused and struggling mass. Some of the Normans started to run away. Then up rode Bishop Odo, swinging his mighty mace, laying about him, and shouting reproof and encouragement to the bewildered Normans. He stayed the panic and probably saved the day. William was as good as his word. The Con- quest completed, he divided the land amongst his knights and nobles. Odo and Robert came in for most liberal rewards. Together with estates in other counties, Odo was given two hundred manors in Kent, that of Eltham being one of them, and he was given also the English title of Earl of Kent. He had immense power, too, in the government of the country. When William, a few years later, found it necessary to return to Normandy for a time, Odo ruled in his name. But he was so harsh and tyran- nical that the men of Kent rose against him, and sought aid from Eustace, Count of Bou- logne. Ambition led to the fall of Odo, as it has to the ruin of other men. William found that his great Earls were getting a little too power- ful for him. So he took measures to keep their power within bounds. Some of them resented this, and scheming and plotting went on for resisting the will of the King. Odo was one of the schemers. He collected much money and men, making believe that he wanted to get himself made Pope. But William was too wide awake. He was not to be taken in. One day at Court, there was a surprise for Odo. The King was there and his courtiers all around. Quite unexpectedly William ordered the arrest of the Bishop. So taken back was everybody that no officer moved to carry out the King's command. They feared to touch a Bishop. So William walked up to Odo, and seized him with his own hands, exclaiming, with a grim laugh, \" I arrest not the Bishop, but the Earl of Kent.\" And Odo was kept a prisoner till the Conqueror died. At the death of the King, William Eufus, his second son, as you know quite well, was given the crown. The Conqueror, at his death, let Odo out of prison, and Rufus allowed his uncle to be once more Earl of Kent. After a while the Norman barons rose against the Red King. They said that they wanted to make his brother Robert King, but their real object was to increase their own power and influence. Odo was their leader. It looked as if the cause of the King was hopeless. But the English stuck loyally to him, and, the pride of ambitious Odo suffered another shock. There was fighting in the north and the west, but Odo and his chief followers were at Roch- ester Castle, and William knew that if he wanted to crush out the revolt, he would have to march against his uncle at Rochester and destroy his power once and for all. So he gathered his fighting men round him in London, and the English came to his banner in force, for he promised to grant them good laws, to levy no unjust taxes, and to allow men the freedom of their woods and of hunting. In the short struggle that ensued, our hero Odo did not cut a very heroic figure. On hear- ing of the Red King's advance, he hastened to Pevensey, where he expected to meet his bro- ther Robert with additional troops from Robert of Normandy. But the Red King was too strong for them and Odo was obliged to give in. Then the King did a rather foolish thing. The English would have been glad to see Odo put to death. But Odo promised to get the surrender of Rochester Castle, and then to leave the country for good, if the King, his nephew, would let him go. So William sent him on to Rochester to make arrangements for its surrender. But it did not come off as was expected, and the unhappy Odo was placed in 26 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. a rather awkward predicament. When he came near to the castle, and explained the cir- cumstances of his coming, the guards seized him and took him within the castle, and then said they would not give it up to the King. So, on the arrival of Eufus and his men, it was subjected to a siege. It was a considerable undertaking, and the King had to appeal to the English for more help. The Men of Kent res- ponded to the call, and those who refused were given the dreaded name of \"nithing,\" which was the vilest name in the language. After a long siege, during which the garrison suffered from great sickness and privation, the castle surrendered, and when the prisoners were led out between the ranks of the royal troops, the English cried with a loud voice, \" Halters ! Bring halters to hang up the traitor Bishop and his friends!\" But the halters were not applied, and most of the rebels were spared execution. Many were banished from the country for ever. Among these was the Bishop of Bayeux. Such, then, briefly told, is the story of Odo, half brother of the King, and the Bishop of Bayeux, who, through the grace of his royal master, became possessed of the broad acres of Eltham, who amassed great wealth and used it wrongfully, who, by ambition, fell. When he went into exile, he passed out of the history of England. Few tears were shed, we may be sure. And it is not with much regret that we now dismiss him from the Story of Eltham. DUKE WILLIAM ADDRESSING HIS SOLDIERS AT THE FIELD OF HASTINGS (Bayeux Tapestry.) DEATH OF HAROLD (Bayeui Tapestry.) CHAPTER VII. HAIMO THE SHIRE-REEVE. When William the Conqueror proceeded to distribute the English estates among his Nor- man Barons he used a certain amount of dis- cretion. He was anxious to win over to his side as many of the English nobility as he could, so he did not take away the estates of all of them. In districts where they were not particularly active in resisting William, many of the English nobles were allowed to keep their lands and manors. But in those quar- ters whence the bulk of the fighting men had come who had fought against him at Senlac, or who had subsequently opposed him in his conquest of England, William was heartless in his confiscations. Kent suffered especially. Not an English nobleman was allowed to re- tain his property in Kent. William had good reason for this. Kent was specially loyal to England and to Harold. So two hundred manors of Kent were given to Odo alone, and he ruled them with an iron hand. The Elt- ham Manor was allotted to Haimo, who held it under Odo. This Haimo was, for more reasons than one, a rather distinguished personage. In the first place he was a kinsman of the King himself. Although he could not claim so close a rela- tionship as Odo, the Earl and Prelate, who- was the King's half-brother, he could claim to have descended from the same old stock — from that fierce Norse pirate, Eolf or Hollo, who was driven from his own land, Norway, as an outlaw, and who came to Normandy and founded the settlement there which after- wards became the Duchy, and of which Wil- liam was the Duke. So, you see, Haimo, the new Lord of Eltham, was of royal blood. And, otherwise, he was a very important man. He was the Shire Reeve of Kent. This was a very high office. In the old Saxon days the Reeve of the Shire was elected by the peo- ple, and, next to the Earldorman or Earl, he was the chief man in the County. But Haimo was appointed by the King, and it was his duty to preside, as the representative of the King, at the Shire Court or Leet, where he had to settle all sorts of disputes that were brought before him from among the people of the Shire. If he was unable to settle them to their satisfaction then they could take their 28 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. disputes to the King. That was how some of the Courts of Law came to be formed, such as the King's Bench, Court of Common Pleas, &c. It must have been strange to have men who spoke a foreign tongue to do this kind of business, and it must have been the cause of a good deal of trouble in meting out justice. The Eltham churls, probably, did not much like having a lord over their manor who could not speak to them in their own language and who could not understand them when they wanted to speak to him. But it is very likely that these Norman Barons had very little to do with the English •villagers. They held themselves aloof from them, and, perhaps, thought themselves quite superior to them. This feeling would be shared by the retainers and foreign servants who waited upon the Baron in his hall, and the lot of the Eltham villagers could not have teen so happy under Haimo as it was under Alwold, who was an Englishman and could speak their own tongue. Not that we have any reason to think that Haimo was particu- larly hard or tyrannical, though the Norman Barons did not bear a very good character in this respect. Haimo's own relative, Odo, for instance, has left behind him a very bad name. In his case \" his evil deeds live after him,\" as Mark Anthony says in the play. But Haimo «ould not have been quite the same sort of man as Odo. Odo was turned out of his Earldom by the King because of his wrong doings, but Haimo remained as Shire Eeeve until his death, which shows, at any rate, that the King never suspected him of being mixed up with the scheming and plotting which led to Odo's un- doing. So, as we cannot find out anything against Haimo, we may as well put him down as a straight-forward Lord of Eltham, al- though, being a foreigner, speaking a foreign language, and obliged to carry out the strict laws of the King, the simple Eltham folk could hardly like him well, especially as his presence always reminded them that they were a conquered people. One day, at the time when Haimo was the lord, there was commotion among the Eltham farmers. All the villans, as they were now called, were summoned to appear before the Hundred Court over at Blackheath, and there was no doubt a good deal of talk amongst them on the farm, or at the forge, or wherever they were in the habit of getting together for a gossip, as to the meaning of this summons. When they got to the Hun- dred Court, there they saw four stern looking persons, called commissioners, and near them were their clerks with quill pens, and ink, and parchment, all looking very wise, we may be sure, and ready to write down whatever they were told. Haimo was there, too, not only because he was Lord of Eltham, but because he was the Shire Reeve. There were also a number of folk from other Manors within the Hundred, priests too, and six villeins from each township. These farmers were not at all pleased to be called up in this way, and, on the quiet, there was a lot of grumbling going on amongst them. It was explained that at a great Council held at Winchester it was ordered by the King that commissioners with their clerks should be sent out into the shires, hundred by hundred, to make enquiries about the manors, and to set it all down in writing. So Haimo himself, and the \" villans \" from the Eltham Manor were made to take a solemn oath that they would tell the truth, and then the stern Norman lawyers questioned them about the estate, how much land it contained and what sort of land it was, how many men there were upon it, and what kind of men they were, what it was worth in Edward's time and what it was worth now, how many cattle and swine each freeman kept, whether the rents could be raised, and other questions besides. The villans had to give correct answers to these enquiries, whether they liked it or no. and the clerks worked away with their quill pens, set- ting it all lown \" in black and white \" as they say, just as the King had commanded. When one town-ship was done with, another town- ship was treated in the same way till the whole Hundred was completed, and so the Commisioners went on right through the other Hundreds of the County. The clerks wrote these things down upon separate scrolls THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. '29 or leaflets, and when they had finished them, they were taken away to Winchester, where other clerks copied them all out again, in a form that had been already arranged. That was how Domesday Book was made up. Yes! Englishmen regarded this as a grievous day. Deeply did they resent the humiliation of having to answer these searching questions. Bitter were the words used by the villagers against inquiry, although, perhaps, they were only muttered protests, for men feared to speak their minds aloud. An old writer of the times says: \"It is a shame to tell what he thought it no shame for him to do. Ox, nor cow, nor swine, was left that was not set down upon hia writ.\" In some places men spoke their pro- tests loudly. There were disputes, which led to fighting and bloodshed. But it was of no avail to resist. The mailed fist of the Conqueror prevailed. By Easter Day, April 5th, 1086, the day appointed as the time limit by the King, the work was finished, and Domes- day Book was added to our National Records. Domesday Book! The name seems very ap- propriate. \" Men called the book Domesday,\" *ays a writer, \" for to the English the inquest seemed searching, and terrible as that of the Last Judgment.\" We have styled Haimo, at the head of this chapter, as Shire Reeve, because that was tho old Anglo-Saxon name for the office which he filled. Now-a-days, we cut the name short and call the officer a Sheriff. The duties of the Sheriff of the present day are not the same as those of the olden time, but many of those duties are similar. The interesting point to bear in mind is that the office was really first established long ago in early Saxon times, and that the present High Sheriff of Kent is on the long roll of Sheriffs which included Haimo, the Lord of Eltham, and many other Shire Reeves before him. But in the Domesday page which refers to Eltham and to Haimo, he is not described as a \" Shire Reeve.\" The word \"Vicecomes,\" has been put in just above his name, which looks as if the clerk, in the first instance, omitted, the title, and that it was afterwards inserted. Domesday is written in Latin, and \"Vicecomes \" is merely the Latin equivalent of Shire Reeve. William found that the office of Shire Reeve in England so much resembled that of a \"Vis- count \" or \" Vicecomes \" in Normandy that he introduced the Norman title to England, and that is how it comes about that Haimo is described as \" Vicecomes \" in Domesday. You will notice, however, thai the old English name has survived after all, for we still call the important officer \"Sheriff\" and not \"Viscount.\" Haimo seems to have lived to a good old age, for in the year 1111, forty-five years after the Norman Conquest, we read of his giving back to the Abbey of St. Augustine at Canterbury the remaining portion of the Manor of Fordwich. Haimo had a niece named Maud, or Mabel, and she married Robert Fitz Roy, Earl of Gloucester, who was a son of Henry I. When Haimo died his lands were in- herited by his niece, and that is how it came about that the Manor of Eltham, after Haimo's death, became one of the estates of the Earl of Gloucester, or, as the book tells us, \"became ap- pended to the honour of Gloucester.\" We must now say good-bye to Haimo, for the hand of death has taken him out of our story. For many years the Eltham Manor was held by the Earl of Gloucester, and his descendants and heirs. A hundred years slip away, in the course of which there seems to have been a dispute as to whom the \" vill,\" or village of Eltham rightly belonged. This dispute led to a legal inquiry and a scrutiny of the Rolls. This was in the seventh year of the reign of King Edward I. As a result of this scrutiny we get an account of Eltham at that particular time, which is so interesting that we may as well read it in the quaint language in which it was written. In reading it you would do well to read through the lines, as they say, and see if you can picture for yourselves, some of the con- ditions of life in our old village at that time. \" Extent of the Manor of Eltham in the county of Kent made by precept of our Lord the King, on the death of Richard de Clare, formerly Earl of Gloucester and Hereford, be- fore William de Axmouth and William de Horseden thereto assigned. 80 THE STORY OF ROYAL ELTHAM. \"By the oath of who say on their oath that in demesne there are 206 acres of arable land, of which 111 acres are worth 4d. per acre; and the amount is 59s. 6d. \"And they say that there are two acres of meadow worth 3s. per acre; and the amount 6s.
