The evening is divided into two sessions: during the first we work through the Scripture readings for the following Sunday. During the second session we look at the teachings of Christianity and of the Catholic Church in the hope that candidates will be ready for reception at Easter.\n\nFor more information visit http://www.rcsouthwark.co.uk/election_faithjourney.html\n\nBack to TOP\n\nGet a copy of a certificate of reception of a Sacrament?\n\nBaptism Certificate\n\nContact the Parish Office with the following:\n\nDate of your Baptism (at least an approximate year).\n\nYour full name and the names of your parents.\n\nSuggested Donation (£10) or anything that you can afford.\n\nFirst Holy Communion Certificate\n\nContact the Parish Office with the following:\n\nDate of your First Holy Communion (at least an approximate year).\n\nYour full name.\n\nSuggested Donation (£10) or anything that you can afford.\n\nConfirmation Certificate\n\nContact the Parish Office with the following:\n\nDate of your Confirmation (at least an approximate year).\n\nYour full name.\n\nSuggested Donation (£10) or anything that you can afford.\n\nMarriage Certificate\n\nContact the Parish Office with the following:\n\nDate of your Wedding (at least an approximate year).\n\nYour full name and the full name of your spouse.\n\nSuggested Donation (£10) or anything that you can afford.\n\nParish Office: eltham@rcaos.org.uk / 0208 850 1666\n\nPlease note that certificates should be picked up from the Parish Office in person during the Parish Office hours (9.30am to 4pm Monday to Friday, and 9.30am to 12noon on Saturdays).\n\nBack to TOP\n\nApply to a Catholic nursery, primary school or secondary school?\n\nOnce you have chosen your school, you should contact the school or go to the relevant borough's website to obtain a supplemental form to be signed by your parish priest.\n\nAt Christchurch Eltham, Fr John will be signing supplemental forms.\n\nPlease note there will be no dates set for Fr John to sign on your school form before the end of the year 2022.\n\nThe next signing date will be Saturday 6th January 2023.\n\nFind the name of a local Catholic nursery or school?\n\nList of local Catholic Schools\n\nBack to TOP\n\nArrange to marry?\n\nIf you or your partner is a Catholic and want to marry, you should contact the Parish Office and make an appointment to see the Parish Priest at least 6 months before your wedding.\n\nThis a time for the Parish Priest to get to know you and to start to look at the special requirements of your wedding.

Please write names clearly.\n\nA Mass for someone living: e.g. Intentions of Name. Or Name (health intentions). You can, of course, use whatever wording you choose.\n\nA Mass for someone who is dead: e.g. Name RIP. Or Name RIP (2nd Anniversary). You can, of course, use whatever wording you choose.\n\nIt is customary to offer a Mass stipend to the priest, since saying the Mass each day is his work. This stipend is supposed to be sufficient to provide for the priest’s needs that day. In the Archdiocese of Southwark, £10 is the usual offering, but you are free to offer less or more or nothing, as you please.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nBecome a volunteer?\n\nVolunteers are the lifeblood of the parish: without them we could not function.

You also have the option to have the body rest overnight in the church before the funeral.\n\nAfter the date and time have been arranged, you should contact the Parish Office to make an appointment to meet with the Parish Priest. The Parish Priest will help with choice of readings and music for the funeral, even if you only want a service at the crematorium or cemetery.\n\nYou will need to think about how you want the service to “feel”? Is it to be a time of celebration of a life? Crematoriums and cemeteries have busy schedules, so please make sure you allow enough time for all the elements you want to include e.g. eulogies, poems and music.\n\nTel: 020 8850 1666\n\nEmail: eltham@rcaos.org.uk\n\nBack to TOP\n\nFind a hospital chaplain?\n\nIf you are going in to hospital, do contact your parish priest so that you can receive the Sacrament of the Sick at home first.\n\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich\n\nFr Josephat Ezeanolue: Our Lady of Grace - 0208 858 0401\n\nQueen Mary’s Hospital, Sidcup\n\nParish priest: St Lawrence of Canterbury - 0208 300 2480\n\nPrincess Royal University Hospital, Farnborough\n\nParish priest: St Michael and All Angels - 01689 851776\n\nUniversity Hospital, Lewisham\n\nParish priest: St Saviour and SS John Baptist and Evangelist - 0208 852 2490\n\nFor Care Home chaplains, contact the local parish in the area in which the Home is located.\n\nBack to TOP"
