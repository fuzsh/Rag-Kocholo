They ask that they might have the remainder of their expenses, as they petitioned the last parliament and nothing has been done. Nature of endorsement: The Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer are to be ordered that, when they have called John Smale before them, they are to inform themselves of how long they had remained seized, and of what has been paid to them before now; and they are to let them have some consideration, by payment or by assignment, so that they do not lose entirely."
