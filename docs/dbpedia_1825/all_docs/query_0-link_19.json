        "text": "This certainly seems to be Westminster Abbey, though to me not obviously St Edward's Chapel. Someone who knows the Abbey well will be able to confirm the location. Where does the date of 1797 come from, is it inscribed and dated?\n\nThe composition is certainly close to Turner's cathedral interiors of the 1790s and around 1800, e.g. his watercolour 'Erasmus in Biship Islip's Chapel' of 1796 in the British Museum (1958,0712.402). But Turner's handling of watercolour, mastery of perspective and lighting is quite distinctive and not obvious in this work. See for comparison the downgraded and rather cruder watercolour of Westminster's Henry VII Chapel in the Courtauld Institute Gallery http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/14874e3b.html . The old attribution of this to Turner seems to have been based on its similarity to the British Museum's work.\n\nAndrew, if your reservations about the un-Turnerish handling relate to the flat and near duotone colouring, then I suggest a look at the much later http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-the-town-hall-louvain-and-the-choir-of-st-peters-church-d20263 (1839).\n\nFor me, the later work's limited palette rings a bell and its black outlining has a curious echo of the white gouache (?) in the cathedral. One might think it a plein-air sketch, but the Tate has a pencil sketch from which it was worked up (Tate D28045). Hence the watercolour style is deliberate, and it was part of his architectural weaponry by then.\n\nYou've led me to shed some of own my doubt, anyway.\n\nOn reflection, I'm just off to look for a Westminster interior sketch in the Bequest. I may be some time!\n\nEdward, I am sure that the title \"Caen Cathedral\", capitalised with no article, implies the cathedral of that name. I've never heard anyone name a cathedral by its stone. That's like calling Exeter \"Beer Cathedral\" :-)\n\nThe naming error is easily explained. Turner visited Caen in 1826. The Rouen, Le Havre, Caen, Bayeux and Isigny sketchbook has 15 pages of the town, all exterior views. When added to the high arches, this visit may have been enough for someone to make a mistaken inference.\n\nThe fly in my ointment is our date, 1797, presumably inscribed on the work. It negates the Mouth of the Thames sketchbook as an source. In the same year, Turner painted the Choir of Salisbury Cathedral, the South Transept of Ely Cathedral and Durham Cathedral along the South Aisle. [All viewable by searching the Tate.] They each try to capture light and atmosphere in different ways, and make particular use of rays on the columns.\n\nA painting of Westminster Abbey makes sense in such a project. For me, the only remaining problem is the style, almost avant-garde in comparison. Was he really capable of it so early on? And if he wasn't, who was?\n\nOr, are we looking at a poor image? Could the collection tell us whether what we see here is faithful?\n\nI have had a word with Andrew Wilton as senior authority on Turner watercolours: he knows it as a puzzle, but is certain it is not Turner though also hard to suggest alternatives (not Roberts, John Scarlett Davis or John Fulleylove as other names). We both agree it looks like Westmnster: its not Tewkesbury and in my view not Caen (where Roberts did various versions). Frankly I can't remember anyone who used white 'drawing' like that -allowing the overall apearance is owing to some sort of degradation, but again of a sort I've never seen in anything by Turner, early (he was mostly doing this sort of view in the later 1790s) or later: if it's acidification in a perhaps tinted paper, that might suggest it's later than it looks by some admiring follower.\n\nThe image of the painting on ArtUK is better than the one here and allows identifying the tomb on the right as that of John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (http://bit.ly/2vIZQ7Q ). The left tomb is William de Valenceâs (http://bit.ly/2ultZWZ ). The artist must have been in the middle of the Chapel of SS. Edmund and Thomas the Martyr looking towards the Chapel Edward the Confessor (http://bit.ly/2wqfPWn).\n\nIn âHistory of Antiquitiesâ, E.W.Brayley says that the âChapel is separated from the Ambulatory by an ancient wooden screenâ (p153, (http://bit.ly/2ultZWZ ) which is clearly missing from the painting.\n\nStarting with plate 73, the âInventory of the Historical Monuments in Londonâ shows the chapel and the tombs from different perspectives http://bit.ly/2wE70Hy , frustratingly they all have a slightly different point of view than the painting.\n\nOn the left side of the painting, is there a figure sitting (and painting?) next to the monumental brass of Robert Waldeby?\n\nPerhaps we should not be so sure about the bodycolour. Take a closer look at Salisbury Cathedral Choir http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-choir-of-salisbury-cathedral-tw0837. Notice the light in the chapel lower right. Even though it is not possible to magnify the image, this light does not fit with the rest of the painting and the implied underlying colour of the ground. One candidate for it is white and yellow bodycolour. Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum might be able to check it.\n\nThis would be a minor exception were it not in the 1797 series of English cathedrals. As it is, consider a scenario in which Turner is using the series to explore interior light, as seems self-evident to me. He challenges himself to capture the Salisbury chapel lamp; it sort of works; excited by a sunbeam at Westminster, he uses the same approach for a full \"Sun is God\". Perhaps taken aback, he never does it like this again, though he does exploit white bodycolour when it suits.\n\nAll the more reason to ask where that 1797 comes from.\n\nDear All - I am attaching images of the accession register entry for this painting where the date of 1797 first appears in writing along with some other interesting notations. The accession register was compiled by the first Curator, Richard Quick, who set up the museum as a public body following Sir Merton's Deed of Gift which was actioned upon his death in 1921.\n\nI have also attached an image of the relevant card from the circa 1906 index system which was, I believe, compiled as part of Sir Merton's Deed of Gift project (i.e. sorting out what was going to come to the people of Bournemouth and what was going to be retained by the family). As you can see the card is dated 30.4.1906 so I think the date of 1921 in the text on the mount of the work is a mistake. But I still believe that Sir Merton obtained the work via auction.\n\nI also checked the file on this work and while there was nothing there about where the 1797 date comes from there was evidence which might explain the mount. We lent the painting to the Lang Art Gallery in 1924 and apparently it arrived with broken glass and a scratched mount which were replaced. A mix up about the date of Sir Merton's death and the obtaining of it by the museum is quite understandable.\n\nSo, going back to the date of 1797, I can only say that if somebody has access to the right Christies catalogue they might be able to track the purchase of the work by Sir Merton (then just plain Mr Merton Russell Cotes). The sale would have to have been before 1906. If the previous owner could be found then we might have more evidence to work with. If anyone has a clue please share it as I will be heading up to the National Art Library soon and I could book out the relevant catalogue for study.\n\nAdditionally, we have been contacted by a member of the public who suggests that Edward Lascelles purchased a watercolour of Westminster Abbey by J.M.W. Turner in 1796. However that painting is not at Harewood House or at Tate. Does anyone know of the fate of this particular painting?\n\nI have changed our database to reflect that the painting shows Westminster.\n\n4 attachments\n\nimg-1665.jpg (4 MB)\n\nimg-1666.jpg (4 MB)\n\nimg-1667.jpg (3 MB)\n\nimg-1668.jpg (3 MB)\n\nTo a great extent this painting is a fantasy or caprice, as it does not show any real sense of what it should. As a view from inside St. Edmund's Chapel towards the tomb of Edward the Confessor, the two spaces between the three tall columns should be filled, to their entire width, by the tombs of Richard II and Queen Anne of Bohemia (on the left) and Edward III (on the right). The 1849 painting of 'St. Edmund's Chapel' by Max Emanuel Ainmiller (1807 - 1870) shows quite effectively what would have been seen by any observer of this view.\n\nProblems with our painting are that there is no possible passage allowing the procession move from the Ambulatory past the left-hand-side of the tomb of Edward III to the tomb of the Confessor. Also, it make no sense to place a wooden pulpit in what is essentially a corridor. And finally, the tomb of Richard II appears to have been transformed into an elaborate altar, which makes no sense either given the rather narrow space in front of it.\n\nThe attached (rather fuzzy) map gives a good idea of the sightline.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Ainmiller also paints the view from St. Edmund's Chapel with the wooden screen missing. Was there some period in the Abbey's history, in the early to mid-1800s, when it was removed, to be replaced at some later date? Or is it a case of both painters employing artistic licence?\n\n2 attachments\n\nview-from-st-edmund-s-chapel-westminster-abbey.png (2 MB)\n\nst-edmund-s-chapel-sightline-to-the-tomb-of-edward-the-confessor.png (696 KB)\n\nThank you to Kieran and Andrea for all your additional comments in February and very useful attachments. I hope Russell-Cotes finds these useful for its object file. I would like to close this discussion now. The artist is not JMW Turner, but remains unknown. The subject is certainly Westminster Abbey but not strictly accurate. Although the use of white bodycolour on poor quality paper seems mid-19th century, Andrea's 'spot the difference' for John of Eltham's monument suggests otherwise (the three shields at bottom left). However, the artist may well have made a mistake here when working up a finished watercolour from a pencil drawing. As Andrew said, three years ago now, the use of perspective is assured. This is a competent artist who for the time remains anonymous."
