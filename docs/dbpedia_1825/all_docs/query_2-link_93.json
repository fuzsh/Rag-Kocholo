        "text": "Frederick Edward Falkiner was born 1820 at Mount Prospect, Tipperary, Ireland, the son of John Daniel Falkiner and Mary Cuddy (Marina Loftus).\n\nAt some stage in 1834 there was an emigration of several Falkiner family siblings to Tasmania; Frederick, his brother Daniel Richard and three sisters though not necessarily all at the same time.\n\nIn March 1835 Frederick E. Falkiner was appointed Postmaster at St Paul’s Plains following the resignation of J.K. Gray and shortly afterwards a Special Constable of Police in October 1835 where he was the Poundkeeper in Campbell Town.\n\nFrederick departed Launceston for Port Phillip in October 1836 however newspaper advertisements suggest he returned to Tasmania at some stage and was running a general store with liquor license at New Ross in 1838 then Lincoln in 1839, his brother Daniel also operating a store with a liquor license in 1839 at Campbell Town.\n\nBy 1841 Frederick was in Melbourne and operating as a horse dealer and keeper of the livery stables on the Eastern Hill. It was around July 1841 he married Fanny Gaile, second daughter of Dr. Gaile, of Gaile’s Hill, County Carlow, Ireland; cousin to Judge H. V. Giblin; also, cousin to Sir Rigs Falkiner, Bartoose, Mount Prospect Estate, County Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nWith the resignation of William Wright in May 1841 as Chief Constable of Police for Melbourne and Port Phillip, Frederick Falkiner was appointed, effective June 1, to fill the vacancy with a salary of £100 sterling. It was observed in the Port Phillip Gazette (26 May 1841) that Falkiner’s appointment was very judicious given the steadiness and circumspection of his character afforded by his several years’ experience in Tasmania. His tenure was short though, only seven months, with William Wright being re-appointed Chief Constable in January 1842 following Falkiner’s resignation, or dismissal, at which point he returned to his profession as a horse dealer in Collins Lane, Melbourne at least until 1847.\n\nOn 28 September 1846, the former Chief Constable of Melbourne was apprehended on a charge of violently assaulting a jockey named John Watts, in the stables at the rear of the Royal Hotel. The assault, it appears, was in retaliation for a blow received at the racecourse at an earlier hour of the day, which had produced a black eye. Watts’ head had been laid open to some extent and he was in a precarious state. Falkiner was indicted 17 October for assaulting John Watts with a whip handle and striking him on the head with intent to maim, at Melbourne, on the 28th of September. A second count was with intent to disfigure, the third with intent to disable, and the fourth with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The jury returned Falkiner guilty of a common assault, and his honor having ordered him from the dock to the floor of the Court, sentenced him to pay a fine of one pound and to be discharged.\n\nSometime after 1847 Falkiner settled on land he had taken up at the junction of the Diamond Creek and Yarra River in the Parish of Nillumbik where he proceeded to plant an orchard. He also grazed cattle on his property. This leasehold included land which was reserved for a village and part of which later became the Eltham Lower Park.\n\nThere were several complaints against Frederick E. Falkiner in those early years. One memorable complaint was from seven men on the Nillumbik country on account of Falkiner’s practice of impounding other men’s cattle which strayed in the vicinity of the Falkiner occupation. Thomas Sweeney was the chief complainant. Falkiner was reported to Superintendent La Trobe, in a letter of 11 May 1849 from Thomas Sweeney, that he was “very much annoyed by a neighbour who has located himself, without permission and on a Village Reserve, who is continually impounding my cattle off the section claiming an entire right to it.”\n\nAround the same time of Sweeney’s letter of complaint, Frederick E. Falkiner applied for three 640-acre leases (Lots 1-3) in the Parish of Nillumbik. It was in August of that year that John Semar, who held a license to depasture stock on the run known as ‘Semars’ or ‘Arthur’ on the Diamond Creek, requested that the license be transferred to Alex Falconer of Melbourne because he had sold his stock to that gentleman. It is a reasonable assumption that he was referring to F.E. Falkiner.\n\nIn the early 1850s the land on the east of the original half acre ‘Town Allotments’ (Sections 1 to 5) in the Eltham Village reserve was subdivided into 22 lots, allotments varying in extent from approximately 2 to 6 ½ acres. It was anticipated that the subdivided land would be used primarily for cultivation purposes. With one exception, the allotments were offered for sale at public auction in 1852, as were a number of larger country lots beyond the village reserve boundaries.\n\nThe allotment excluded from the auction sale was Allotment 17, on the south of Ely Street and containing nearly 2 ½ acres. On it were some improvements regarded as being the property of Frederick Edward Falkiner. The improvements were described in a report of Surveyor Hurst, whose father was the Superintendent of C.S Haley’s Diamond Creek run (or station). According to Hurst the improvements on Allotment 17 consisted of “1 ¼ acres of cultivations, a very dilapidated five-roomed hut of sawn slabs, also a rough hut used as a dairy, total value £30.” When a subdivision survey was effected, F.E. Falkiner applied for exclusive right of purchase of all the land on which he had made some improvement, viz the cultivation, etc on Allotment 17 and fencing and a stockyard on Allotment 18. He was allowed to purchase Allotment 17 without having to compete at a public auction and was directed to vacate Allotment 18.\n\nOn February 1st, 1854, the first Post Office in Eltham was opened, and the first postmaster was Frederick E. Falkiner, who presumably operated the service from his home. In today’s mapping this was in Falkiner Street which runs between Main Road and Ely Street, Eltham. Sketch lines of land maps of the time place the house at the northern end.\n\nIn that same year it is also recorded that F.E. Falkiner complained about the Building Committee at the Little Eltham school, a complaint deemed “frivolous and vexatious” by Mr Goodman of Heidelberg.\n\nOn May 1, 1855, Falkiner was succeeded as Postmaster by Thomas Hunniford, a merchant of Little Eltham; the name of the post office remaining unchanged though it was listed in official returns by the name of the new location, the site of present day 820 Main Road.\n\nIn 1858 Falkiner was fined £5 and costs for carelessly setting fire to his stubble yet in the same year he was an auditor for the accounts of the Eltham District Road Board, and the street adjacent to his crown grant was named after him.\n\nOn July 1, 1881, Frederick E. Falkiner, one of the oldest inhabitants of the community, was found dead in his bed early in the morning. When he had retired to rest a few hours earlier he was, apparently, in perfect health, and had been working the same day as usual on his farm. His death was attributed to heart disease.\n\nFrederick’s wife Fanny died seven years later, September 12, 1888, at Eltham and is buried at Eltham Cemetery though her grave site is not actually known. It is presumed to be located in the Old Methodist section adjacent or nearby to other Falkiner family members.\n\nFrederick is also buried at Eltham Cemetery but the location of his grave is also unknown, presumably beside or with Fanny. His death certificate reads as a little Who’s Who of Little Eltham at the time. His death was registered by David George Clark, who was also the Head Teacher at the Eltham State School No. 209 in Dalton Street. He was buried July 3 by undertaker, William Bravery Andrew who also owned and ran the General Store at the corner of Maria Street and and Franklin Street (present day site of Cafe Zen Den). The minister who conducted the burial service was William Crozier, an early pioneer settler of Little Eltham and it was witnessed by George Knapman, the blacksmith who ran the shoeing forge adjacent to the Eltham Court House. All of whom are now resident in Eltham Cemetery.\n\nResearch and Copy: P. Pidgeon, December 2021"
