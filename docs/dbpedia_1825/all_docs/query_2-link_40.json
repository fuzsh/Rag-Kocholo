        "text": "Above: The parish church of St John, Eltham.\n\nThe church is assumed to have been in existence since Norman times, possibly even Saxon times. The earliest mention was 1166 when William, Earl of Gloucester, founded a priory at Keynsham, in Somerset, and gave ‘to the Church of St Mary and St Paul, of Keynsham, and the canons regular there serving God, in free and perpetual alms, the Church of St John, of Hautham [Eltham], with its appurts’. This meant that the abbots of Keynsham were the Rectors of Eltham and, in turn, appointed the vicars to carry out the duties of a priest.\n\nOne of the earliest records of the church relates to a document of Richard Tottnam, in 1468, who ‘left provisions for 2 pounds of wax, and also for a torch before the image of St John the Baptist’. In 1543 – five years after the priory of Keynsham, in Somerset, had been dissolved – the right of being Rector passed to Oriel College, Oxford. The advowson of the vicarage was sold to the Rowper family who later sold it to other parties. Church accounts go back to 1554.\n\nA new church, believed to be the third on the site, was erected in 1670, at the expense of Sir John Shaw, the roof of the old church had fallen in while a vault was being dug for him in 1667.\n\nA famous name associated with the church is that of Thomas Doggett, who had retired from the theatre in the West End of London to live at Eltham. He died and was buried on 25 September 1721 in the churchyard. Doggett established a sculling race on the Thames – the oldest rowing race in the world. Up to six apprentice watermen of the River Thames compete for this prestigious honour, which has been held every year since 1715.\n\nA second name, probably less well known, is that of Sir William James – captor of Severndroog, on the Malabar Coast, in India, in 1755. James died in 1783 and was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist.\n\nIn the 19th century, Colonel John Thomas North – the landowner who had Avery Hill House built – died in 1896 and was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist.\n\nThe present church was built in 1875 on the site of the medieval one. The architect was Sir Arthur Blomfield. The church stands surrounded by its churchyard beside the crossroads at the top of Eltham Hill.\n\nSee also – Avery Hill House\n\n-ENDS-"
