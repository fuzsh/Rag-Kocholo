        "text": "Slight changes to this as i pick it back up after a break!\n\n\"With the death of our late dread sovereign Edward, the IV of that name since the conquest, and the destruction of his sons Edward V and of Richard Duke of York, all of most dear and blessed memory, that the said throne of England was occupied without lawful right by the late Richard Duke of Gloucester, late calling himself King of England and of France, and with the said Richard himself destroyed for which we thank God, it is by the will of God that the elder daughter of the said Edward being lawfully begotten, is the rightful and lawful inheritrix of the throne and realm and therefore we do say that the Commons and Lords of this realm do acknowledge that The Most High and Most Mighty Princess, Elizabeth, be lawful Queen of England and of France and Lady of Ireland\" - proclamation of Elizabeth I's title and right by the Speaker of the House of Commons in October 1485.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\"All must bow to King Dorset!\"\n\nThe words of Archibald Douglas 5th Earl of Angus in a letter to his wife Elizabeth in November 1485.\n\nHe was bemoaning the poor treatment of himself, his young King James IV and their entourage after the combined Scots, Yorkist, French and disgruntled Lancastrians united to defeat Richard of Gloucester in the Summer of 1485.\n\nThe story of their success is of course well-known thanks to the popular chronicle written anonymously and widely distributed in literate society in the following year.\n\n\"Historie of the Arrivall of Elizabeth, the Queen, in England and the Finall Recouerye of Her Kingdomes,\" the title clearly meant to mirror the chronicle of her late father's restoration after the defeat of Henry VI and the Earl of Warwick.\n\nThe Scots resentment was not unique, whilst Elizabeth of York and her family were sequestered in the Royal Apartments in the Tower of London before repairing to the Palace of Westminster for the opening of the new Queen's first Parliament - the Scots were stuck in the rather decayed set of buildings in Scotland Yard. It was probably this experience that inspired James IV's later rebuilding programme of the Scot's royal residences.\n\nThe young King was of course betrothed to the English Queen, who was six years his elder, and certainly there was a level of affection between the two. Elizabeth had lived in close proximity to the King for almost three years and the King was said to admire her but his treatment by her family and supporters in the late months of 1485 would have a lasting impact on their relationship.\n\nElizabeth herself was in the middle of a political maelstrom trying to establish her own identity and her right to rule.\n\nShe was also mourning the past - on November 2 (one what would have been her brother's 15th birthday) a full requiem mass was held for Edward V and his brother Richard Duke of York and Norfolk - attended by most of the English Court.\n\nThe established facts that the deposed King and his brother had been killed with the connivance of Richard Duke of Gloucester (late calling himself King of England) were promulgated throughout the land giving official confirmation of long held rumour.\n\nThe real feelings of the Queen and the Queen Dowager and their wider family are not known - neither are known to have ever mentioned the fate of Edward V and his brother in public.\n\nThere was no burial service, no bodies and no formal charge against Richard of Gloucester or any other man.\n\nA notable absence was Cecily Duchess of York - the elderly woman was said to have left London for her country home nursing a \"bitter heart\" at the death of her youngest and final son. Her final leave-taking of her granddaughter and sovereign was said to have been courteous and respectful - with the Queen permitting the aged Duchess to sit in her presence.\n\nAt 19 Elizabeth was said to physically resemble both her parents in the words of one courtier \"a very handsome woman of great ability\" who was also said to be devoted to her numerous relations and mother.\n\nHer accession to the English throne was not without controversy - several in the first Parliament summoned in her name that cold November had suggested her \"right and title\" to the throne was not valid due to her sex, some muttered the rightful King was her younger cousin Edward Earl of Warwick (the son of her disgraced Uncle George), others claimed that on her marriage that barbarous Scots boy would be England's King as her husband he would gain all. The reality though was that a powerful political coalition had opted for Elizabeth who in reality was the least worse choice to all sides.\n\nMore importantly that coalition now wanted its rewards hence Angus' comments about the Queen's half brother Lord Dorset but he was just one of many.\n\nAttachments\n\nCapture.JPG\n\n...\"This spirited prince now saw, and most anxiously regretted, that he was thus at last deluded by king Louis; who had not only withdrawn the promised tribute, but had declined the alliance which had been solemnly agreed upon between the Dauphin and the king's eldest daughter\" - Crowland Chronicle\n\nChapter One: Journey to the throne\n\nIn late 1482 the conflict between James III of Scotland and his brother Alexander Duke of Albany reached its climax with Alexander joining Richard Duke of Gloucester's invasion of the country.\n\nJames and Alexander's relationship had been in terminal decline for several years.\n\nGloucester's victory saw Albany appointed Lieutenant General of the Kingdom of Scotland and James III under arrest.\n\nMany thought the King would manage to persuade some of his notable courtiers back to his side with time and Albany's governance was not much more impressive than his brother's.\n\nOne consequence of Albany's victory was he again began negotiations with the English for the betrothal of the Scot's heir, his nephew James Duke of Rothesay, to one of the daughters of Edward IV.\n\nIn late November Scots negotiators had arrived at the English Court to try and persuade Edward to revive his interest in a Scots marriage.\n\nEdward was not particularly willing given his brother's successful campaign against the Scots but would hear them out after all the Scots heir was a child and any marriage would be several years hence.\n\nIn December though the situation changed and on December 18th it was announced King James III had died \"of grief\" at his defeat by the English.\n\nIn reality the King was almost certainly murdered with the connivance of his brother the Duke of Albany - his body displayed for his funeral bore few marks but it is generally believed that he was strangled.\n\nMany wondered if Albany would proclaim himself King - but when the Scots Parliament met it was merely to confirm the accession of the nine-year-old James IV - Albany still unpopular was as expected named as Regent - however the Scots Lords insisted custody of the young King and his brothers' was vested in the popular Queen Dowager Margaret of Denmark.\n\nThe Regent ordered the Scots negotiators to look elsewhere for a bride for the new King and made overtures for possible betrothal's with both France and Maximilian of Burgundy.\n\nHowever Edward IV cheated of seeing his eldest daughter Queen of France now decided any King would do and intent on revenge on France would like to completely neutralise the Scots.\n\nHe gave the Scots negotiators a choice of Elizabeth (16) or Cecily (13) - if the Scots chose Elizabeth or Cecily, who had previously been offered to the Scots, he was willing for them to join Queen Margaret at Stirling immediately - he also suggested returning the recently taken town of Berwick as part of any dower.\n\nInitially the Scots had said the King's daughter Anne was nearer in age to the Scots King but Edward refused as he still hoped to see her marry Philip of Burgundy.\n\nThe Regent keen to ensure English support for his rule and a generous pension was prepared to support the suggestion - regaining Berwick might help negate the anger at an English match for the \"wee King\".\n\nThe Scots opted for Elizabeth of York and preparations for her to travel north began to be made.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Eltham (January 20th 1483) - The Scots were expected to maintain Elizabeth until the King's 12 birthday, if he repudiated the betrothal at that date her immediate return to the English Court along with any part payment of her dower must be guaranteed, it was expected the couple should marry when James IV turned 14. The Scots were also expected to agree that in the event of James dying before the marriage Elizabeth would be returned to England along with all her plate and jewels and not forced to any other marriage that disparaged her dignity or that of her father.\n\nIn return the English guaranteed pensions to Albany and many of his supporters in the Scots Parliament as well as the first part of Elizabeth's dower. Berwick would only be handed over following Elizabeth's marriage. Her betrothal took place at Windsor in February.\n\nElizabeth of York's progression north in early March 1483 is well documented - she was accompanied on the first part of the journey by much of her father's court before being transferred with her household to the care of her uncle of Gloucester. At Berwick Upon Tweed still in English hands Elizabeth was formally received by the Scots regent.\n\nShe entered the Scots capital and was well-received by the populace, despite her nationality, and was formally presented to her future mother-in-law and husband and was lodged in the Royal apartments at Edinburgh castle.\n\nThe Royal family and much of the Scots court celebrated Easter in the capital before Elizabeth accompanied her future mother-in-law to Stirling. It would be here Elizabeth received news her father Edward IV was seriously ill.\n\n\"For, shortly after the events already stated, and when the Parliament had been dissolved, the king, neither worn out with old age nor yet seized with any known kind of malady, the cure of which would not have appeared easy in the case of a person of more humble rank, took to his bed. This happened about the feast of Easter; and, on the ninth of April, he rendered up his spirit to his Creator, at his palace of Westminster, it being the year of our Lord, 1483, and the twenty-third year of his reign.\" - Croyland Chronicles\n\nElizabeth's reaction to her father's death and her uncle Richard of Gloucester's assumption of power in England following the death of her father is not known.\n\nHowever the official Scots position from the Duke of Albany was to offer Richard his continued support and to request his continuing agreements regarding Elizabeth's betrothal and dower be maintained.\n\nAlbany does, in one of his few surviving communications, ask after Elizabeth's family - \"As to the Lady she is somewhat anxious for her mother's health and the well-being of her sisters who we are given to understand remain at Westminster.\"\n\nThe reply from Richard does not survive but it must have satisfied Albany as no further communication mentions the English Queen dowager.\n\nThe next contact Elizabeth would have with her family was at the beginning of June when her uncle Sir Edward Woodville arrived with three English ships in the Firth of Forth.\n\nHe formally requested refuge from Albany and was allowed to travel to Stirling to see his niece.\n\nElizabeth must have been alarmed at how her family's situation appeared to be worsening and by the end of June Richard of Gloucester was proclaimed King.\n\nAlbany's initial reaction appears to have been somewhat muted when the English heralds presented him details of Richard's accession and the deposition of Edward V.\n\nHe made no comment and left for Stirling where he appears to have informed Queen Margaret and Elizabeth of York of events south of the border.\n\nThe Scots lords themselves now had serious questions - the Treaty of Eltham which confirmed the betrothal was based on Elizabeth being Edward's legitimate daughter.\n\nMany questioned whether the deal would be maintained given Elizabeth was now a bastard by order of her uncle. Would the marriage still be worth going ahead with for either side?\n\nAn English betrothal had not been universally popular and the Scots felt under no obligation to maintain an alliance that now offered little advantage.\n\nIn late July Richard informed Albany that he would continue to support Albany's regency for as long as he would maintain the peace with England.\n\nHowever he stated the terms of the Treaty of Elthams were void and that he demanded the regent have his niece escorted to the border and placed in the custody of the Earl of Northumberland.\n\nHe also requested Albany banish Sir Edward Woodville from Scotland and have him escorted to the English border he also demanded Albany to not receive or give refuge to any of the \"adherrants of the former Queen Dowager, Lady Grey and her family\".\n\nThe Queen's brother Lionel Bishop of Salisbury had also fled abroad and was thought to be in Brittany.\n\nAlbany was left with little choice and in August he ordered Elizabeth removed from the Queen's household at Stirling and brought to Edinburgh - she was housed in the royal apartments at the Castle but her staff was reduced significantly and she had little money. He had Sir Edward \"closely\" kept but did not have him escorted to the border.\n\nThroughout August the Scots Lords and Albany debated the value of keeping the lady in Scotland and retaining the betrothal in the face of English opposition.\n\nBefore a decision was finally reached England would erupt with a series of revolts against Richard's rule initally in the name of Elizabeth's brother Edward.\n\nThe revolts were coordinated by many of those who had served Elizabeth's father and suprisingly included Richard's former friend the Duke of Buckingham, also an obscure Lancastrian claimant attempted a small landing in Wales.\n\nIt is not clear whether Albany received communications from any of those rebelling against Richard III or when the first rumours of the death of Edward V and his brother reached him but it is noted that he did communicate with both the French regent and the Duke of Brittany about the situation in England (he was also sounding out alternative matches for James IV including Anne of Brittany).\n\nIt seems likely he was at least at one point considering supporting the rebels and invading England from the north such an invasion whether it succeeded or not would have seriously damaged Richard's ability to crush the rebellion he was facing in the South and West of England.\n\nAlbany it seems was hoping that if her brother's were dead those loyal to Edward V would support Elizabeth as his lawful heir - he seems to have backed away when he heard that Henry Tudor was planning to join with the rebels.\n\nAlbany's hesitation in taking action helped guarantee the rebellion in England would fail.\n\nHe retained custody of Elizabeth but again issued no confirmation of the betrothal to James IV.\n\nBy Christmas 1483 Richard was celebrating the end of the rebellion and for the first time since his usurpation was looking more secure whilst Elizabeth remained in Scotland isolated and not even the company of the King and his brothers to cheers her.\n\n\"Meanwhile in England, France and Scotland, the leaders of the conspiracy undertook many things to prepare . Some held strategic places defended by armed men, others secretly solicited the common folk to make disturbances, and yet others were ready and waiting elsewhere, so that, as soon as they could, they might begin a war, and some men used secret messengers to invite others to join their new conspiracy, whom they knew for sure to share their hatred of Richard.\" Anglica Historia by Polydore Vergil\n\nThe Marquess of Dorset had fled to Brittany joining his uncle and Henry Tudor and it was there on Christmas Day that Henry Tudor proclaimed himself committed to destroying Richard and made an oath that if she were free he would marry Elizabeth of York or if not her sister Cecily of York.\n\nIt is almost certain Henry intended to be King himself without any consideration of the claims of Edward IV's daughter's however it is also certain that Henry's success would be dependent on the support of supporters of Edward IV alienated by Richard III and to gain their support a marital commitment to the York daughter's was essential.\n\nIt is a strange deal but given Albany's failure to support the rebels earlier that year it might have seemed the only choice for Dorset who probably believed the Scots would not move against Richard and that Elizabeth's betrothal was not likely to survive current events.\n\nDorset himself had written to Albany asking that the lady be allowed with Sir Edward Woodville to sail for Brittany where no doubt a marriage with Henry Tudor would be arranged - Albany failed to reply.\n\nAs 1484 began it seemed likely that Richard III would maintain his hold on the English Crown and that Elizabeth of York would remain in limbo in the custody of the Scots.\n\nShe had received little communication from her family in England or her scattered relatives in Brittany and France.\n\nShe had been housed in apartments at Edinburgh Castle but had few attendants and from her later letters we know she missed the company of her large family in England.\n\nNominally the Lady Elizabeth was under the protection and custody of the Scots Regent the Duke of Albany. However her day to day protection was provided by the Keeper of Edinburgh Castle the John Stewart Lord Darnley.\n\nDarnley had been loyal to the late King James III and loathed Albany and the resentment among the Scots nobility of Albany and his subservience (whether real or imagined) to the English was growing.\n\nEven Albany's former ally, Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus, had fallen out with the regent and rumours of rebellion were present throughout the first three months of the year.\n\nIn April the Scots Parliament was summoned and refused point blank due to the manipulation of several nobles and their allies to approve Albany's requests and it became clear he was losing his grip on the country and he fled Edinburgh. In May he would be murdered whilst attempting to board a ship for France.\n\nParliament had declared him a traitor (due to his unproved involvement in the murder of James III) and established the Earl of Angus as Regent of Scotland until the King's 14 birthday (March 1487) and confirmed The Queen Dowager's custody of the King and his two younger brothers.\n\nThe Parliament authorised Angus to seek out a match for the King for the good of the realm but no mention was made of the young English woman who remained in Edinburgh Castle.\n\nIn England Richard III's success at defeating the rebellions of Autumn 1483 had meant he should have been enjoying some security but in early April his only legitimate child died at Middleham in Yorkshire further weakening his position.\n\nIn Scotland Angus consolidated his governance of the realm but in August it became apparent that Richard would not tolerate an independent Scotland.\n\nRichard believed neither Angus nor his predecessor had honored their agreements when he had invaded Scotland in 1482 - the price for English help against James III had been recognition of England's overlordship of Scotland and both had refused to return the King's niece to English custody and he knew Angus had received representations from the family of Elizabeth Woodville.\n\nHaving crushed rebellions against his own rule - Richard was contemplating a fresh invasion of Scotland.\n\nAngus had been putting out tentative diplomatic feelers to the French regent Anne for some time initially to find a match for the King or his younger brother's that would renew France's ties with Scotland. He now wanted a treaty of mutual aid against England.\n\nAnne was already offering support to Richard's enemies including Henry Tudor, his uncle, the Marquess of Dorset and the Bishop of Salisbury who had fled Brittany for France.\n\nIn late August Richard III received communication that \"the former bishop of Salisbury, along with many gentleman of the French court have arrived in Edinburgh\".\n\nLionel was formerly received by the 11 year old King and the regent and Sir Edward Woodville was released from his imprisonment as a mark of respect for the French delegation.\n\nLionel made it clear the French were willing to support a new treaty allying France and Scotland against England with the aim of \"restoring the right lawful sovereign of England\".\n\nThere were three main claimants - Elizabeth of York (if her illegitimacy was a mere ruse by Richard III), Edward Earl of Warwick (the only male Yorkist claimant but in Richard III's custody) and Henry Tudor (with a weak claim through his mother).\n\nIt does seem some consensus had been reached between Henry Tudor and Dorset & Salisbury and the French regent was supporting it.\n\nThe deal hinged on full recognition of the betrothal of Elizabeth and James IV. In the event of the marriage being without issue the Scot's throne would pass to James' lawful heir but the English throne would pass to Henry Tudor (or if he was deceased his issue by Cecily of York who he would marry).\n\nJames brother James Duke of Ross would be betrothed to one of Elizabeth's younger sisters. The French regent's support for a scheme that would see England and Scotland under one crown might seem odd - but plunging the two nations into conflict would also ensure they left France alone - and her financial commitment to support any joint invasion would be minimal.\n\nRichard III was probably well aware of the negotiations taking place in Scotland and had issued a flurry of orders relating to the defence of northern England and improvements to the principal castle's defending England from Scotland and dispatched orders to the Earl of Northumberland and his nephew the President of the Council of the North John Earl of Lincoln for the defences of his realm.\n\nIn the end the long-drawn out negotiations took so many weeks it was early October before any formal agreements between the parties opposed to Richard was reached.\n\nWhilst holding off military action in the short-term allowed Richard time to improve his defences against any invasion it also allowed his enemies time to sound out further support in England.\n\nThe Christmas festivities of 1484/5 were muted at the court of Richard III - his grief for his dead son was still heartfelt and the Queen was also unwell - accussations she was being poisoned were made though it is though grief at the death of her only child was more likely the cause of her failing health.\n\nIn Scotland the regent organised numerous events for the court and the King and his brothers at a court presided over by the Queen Dowager. Notably Elizabeth of York was seated beside her betrothed and was addressed as Your Grace by all members of the court - it did not escape anyone's notice her canopy of estate bore not the arms of Scotland but the undifferenced Royal arms of England.\n\nOn January 3rd this visual statement became fact when Angus in a letter to his wife described Elizabeth as \"and Her Grace the right lawful Queen of England\"\n\nElizabeth would later describe her changing fortunes as leaving her mind \"blowing hither and thither in the wind\". In attendance on the Queen in Scotland were her uncles Sir Edward Woodville and Lionel Bishop of Salisbury along with a growing number of men once loyal to her father. In France her brother Lord Dorset, Henry and Jasper Tudor and the Earl of Oxford were in constant attendence on the French regent arguing for men and money to assist in any invasion. Whilst in England despite a careful watch being placed upon her Margaret Beaufort Countess of Richmond was sounding out further support (whether to support her son's claim or the Yorkist princess is a matter of conjecture).\n\nFor Richard the year would deteriorate further when in March his wife Queen Anne would finally die. His reliance on his loyal band of northerners was provoking difficulty in the south and west country and in Wales but his authority held - but there was growing distrust of both Northumberland (who was constantly complaining about the Earl of Lincoln's role in the North) and the Stanley's who Richard mistrusted due to suspicion of Stanley's wife Margaret Beaufort.\n\nHowever he also had breathing room to consolidate his control as despite the Franco-Scots alliance there had been zero movement to launch an invasion of England.\n\nThe delay was in part due to the season and also due to the French regent's miserliness in contributing men or money to the campaign due to her own internal political struggles.\n\nRichard himself was by May in negotiations with both the Portugeuse for a marital alliance that would give him some much needed international support. He also approached the Duke of Brittany about a marriage to his young daughter once promised to the nephew he had deposed.\n\nThe uneasy peace would soon be at an end in the summer of 1485 - French troops were provided to Henry Tudor and the Marquess of Dorset to launch an invasion of England.\n\nThe plan was two-fold - Henry and Dorset would land in Wales - Henry with his unlce and the Earl of Oxford would rouse Welsh support whilst Dorset would cross into the South West and garner support there before the two mini armies would reunite to march together on London via Oxford. At the same time Scots forces would launch an attack on Northern England.\n\n\"Your Grace, My dear mother\n\nThe King has joined me at Edinburgh and Sir Edward tells me we will travel south behind a greate armie.\n\nLord Angus has told me I am to be Queene and that my uncle will be destroyed . It seems strange this is what has come.\n\nWhen I think of what great affection father held him in and how he has acted against my brothers, your grace and us all. I know not what to think of it and hope that if that comes to pass I will do what is right by you and those lost to us. I praye to God most fervently to give me a strong and just rule and to guide me in all things.\n\nTomas rites from France he is well and I know that will please you much to know that he is safe from harm.\n\nI hope your grace and my sisters be in goodly health for you are ever in my prayers and thoughts.\n\nThe queene here is as kind to me as ever and the king is ever gentle in my presence. Lord Angus has all controle here and has been a good guide unto me I believe.\n\nPray for me\n\nyour daughter\n\nElizabeth R\"\n\nLetter of Queen Elizabeth I to Queen Elizabeth Wydeville, copied from a lost original by Sir Francis Bacon in his History of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth (1622).\n\nBy late July war was on the agenda as the forces opposed to Richard III's rule finally took action.\n\nThe bulk of the Anglo-French force would depart from Normandy on July 20th and land in south Wales a week later. Once there the castle of Dale was captured by the combined forces - Henry Tudor and his uncle it was agreed would march north through Wales gathering support, whilst Dorset and the Earl of Oxford would march West for Bristol where Dorset would summon forces in the West Country loyal to him. The two armies would join together at Worcester before turning towards London.\n\nRichard learnt of the landing of the forces on about the 24th July by which time it was clear his Welsh supporters had either deserted or declined to meet the forces. Richard immediately left London having issued his orders for his supporters to meet him at Oxford.\n\nAs he marched he learnt the Scots forces had massed at Jedburgh and were preparing to cross the border - he sent instructions to his nephew the Earl of Lincoln and Northumberland to engage the Scots army but ordered the Stanley's whose troops would normally be defending their part of the Scots border to march south to meet him. Instructions that were largely ignored.\n\nTudor and Dorset managed to recruit some considerable support but their numbers were certainly less than the army Richard had to face them.\n\nRichard would reach Oxford around August 3rd after a slow start and was joined their by many of his men including the duke of Norfolk. He intended to wait there until news reached him of which way Dorset and Tudor planned to march towards London.\n\nIn the North though Angus with the Scots forces, bearing Yorkist banners, had reached Harbottle when news reached him that Northumberland and his men were just some miles south - however before Angus could lay down any bottle plan - an emissary had arrived bearing the Earl's note offering his support and loyalty to his \"right lawful sovereign lady\".\n\nNorthumberland's about face has fascinated historians as he had been an early supporter of Richard however it is widely thought he was dissatified that Richard's absence had not allowed him to take full control of northern England and that he had to play second fiddle to Richard's young nephew the Earl of Lincoln.\n\nNorthumberland's men now joined with the Scots and began a slow march south for York, a city loyal to Richard but largely undefended.\n\nHowever the Earl of Lincoln with his Yorkshire troops including many men from Richard's own northern holdings had joined with the troops of the Bishop of Durham and were slowly marching north intending to destroy the Scots.\n\nThe two sides would meet at Stannington south of Morpeth on August 14th - the resulting battle would leave the Earl of Lincoln and around 1,000 of his men dead, the Bishop of Durham was taken prisoner and now nothing lay between Angus, Northumberland and York. On August 15th Angus despatched orders that the \"King and the Queene be brought with haste south\".\n\nIn the South by August 18th Richard and his army were preparing to meet with his rivals at Burford. It was probably on the eve of the battle that Richard would learn of Lincoln's defeat.\n\nRichard's army initially had control of the field and Dorset and Tudor took heavy casualties - however the King himself took to the midst of battle in attempt to rally his troops. Whilst Henry Tudor was badly injured by those surrounding the King - it was Richard who was fatally wounded. With Richard dead his men soon fled the field and Norfolk was forced to capitulate and by Dorset's orders was executed on the field. When someone pointed out that he had not faced trial Dorset pointed out neither his uncle Lord Rivers, nor his brothers had when they met their fate at Richard's hand.\n\nRichard's reign was over but the question still remained of who would claim the crown. Tudor's injuries whilst not fatal meant he would have to take rest in Oxford - had he been well then it is a popular thought with many now that he would have proclaimed himself King. Dorset with no hesitation abandoned his ally to the doctor's and ignoring the plea of Oxford and Jasper Tudor ordered his own forces to march on London - the Marquesses well known vanity wanted to make sure he was the first to arrive victorious in the capital.\n\nIn the North Northumberland and Angus encamped outside York on August 20th and sent orders to the Mayor and Sheriff to surrender the city. Initially the corporation refused and ordered the city gates closed to the Earl's however on August 22nd news reached the north of Richard's death and to avoid further battle the Mayor and corporation formally received the Earl's.\n\nNorthumberland then requested a service of Thanksgiving be held in the Minster for the deliverance of England unto her rightful sovereign - it was notable that no mention of who the rightful sovereign was as now in Northumberland's control was the person of Edward Earl of Warwick (the sole surviving male member of the house of York).\n\nOn September 5th Dorset's army entered London where he had an emotional reunion with his mother and half sisters.\n\nMuch of Richard's household and supporters had fled - however Dorset soon established a new council in his sister's name without it must be said reference to the woman herself or the Scots regent.\n\nOn September 7th in an echo of Richard's own coup - Dorset ordered a chaplain to preach a sermon outside St Paul's declaring Richard's reign to be a usurpation and that the only lawful heir was the daughter of the late King Edward.\n\nWith artful manipulation a day later a petition of nobles, commons, the mayor and corporation of London called on the lady Elizabeth to assume the throne and was presented to the Queen Dowager at Westminster.\n\nDorset went further issuing formal writs in his sister's name for a Parliament to convene in London in October. Meanwhile he browbeat the dithering Archbishop Rotherham of York to deliver the Great Seal to him.\n\nOn September 11th the Archbishops of York and Canterbury issued a new bidding prayer - \"Our princess ..our dread Queen, Elizabeth, the lady Queen Elizabeth her mother, all the royal offspring, her nobles and people.\"\n\nA recovering Tudor would reach London on the 14th September for a reunion with his own mother who was in permanent attendence on her old friend Elizabeth Woodville - it was bitter sweet as it was too late for him to proclaim himself King but there was certainly plenty of people who thought he was a better match for Elizabeth of York than the Scots King.\n\nAll the victor's now needed was the lady herself who would eventually arrive on September 30th - Northumberland and Angus had led a growing entourage that surrounded the new Queen and her betrothed as they slowly made their way South - their entry into the city of London would be impressive - the young Queen accompanied by her brother Dorset who had ridden out to meet her, her uncles Sir Edward Woodville and the Bishop of Salisbury and her cousin the Earl of Warwick - all on horseback, surrounded by Yorkist banners, the City corporation had hurridly created displays in praise of both the Queen and the King of Scots.\n\nThe Queen after receiving the loyal addresses of the Mayor of London and diverse others were taken to the Royal Apartments at the Tower to be received by her mother, the Countess of Richmond and the Duchess of Buckingham and the Marchioness of Dorset. It is perhaps no doubt that it was an emotional reunion for the Queen and her family. A notable absence was the aged Duchess of York perhaps still mourning the death of her last surviving son though she was in London.\n\nThe young King of Scots would follow behind his betrothed entourage much to the 12 year old's chagrin with gentleman of his household and Angus. The Scots contingent would be lodged in the rather dilapidated group of buildings at Scotland Yard - the ancient residence of the King of Scots in London.\n\nThe 19-year-old Queen would that evening the first meeting of her council - Dorset was named Lord Treasurer, Northumberland was confirmed as Lord Great Chamberlain and was additionally made President of the Council of the North he also retained his Lord Wardenship of the Marches, Lord Stanley was also confirmed in all his posts and appointed to the council, Archbishop Rotherham retained the role as Lord Chancellor, the Bishop of Salisbury was made Keeper of the Privy Seal, Lord High Constable was restored to the young Duke of Buckingham (whose father's attainder would be reversed by Elizabeth's first Parliament) his custody was awarded to his mother the widowed Duchess and his marriage awarded to the Earl of Northumberland. Both Jasper and Henry Tudor were restored to their respective Earldom's (the Yorkist Earl of Pembroke having fallen at Burford) and lands in the crown's hands - Henry was named president of the Council of Wales, the Earl of Oxford was named Lord High Admiral with Edward Woodville named his deputy.\n\nNominally Elizabeth of York was now Queen Regnant the first in England's long history but their was dissent amongst her supporters and many would expect to reap significant rewards for their support and still voices were raised that a woman could not have rule over men.\n\nThere was still the question of her legitimacy and whether her cousin Edward should not rule in her place. Many of her new supporters such as Oxford had remained committed Lancastrians who believe Henry Tudor to be the rightful heir of Henry VI.\n\nCould Elizabeth prove them all wrong and bring peace where there had been confusion and disharmony?\n\nConsolidation:\n\nA study of the first acts of Elizabeth's first parliament show her and her council's aims.\n\nAct concerning the title to the crown, act repealing the Act of Titulus Regius, An act for the restitution of The Queen Dowager were followed by acts restoring the Earl of Oxford, Henry and Jasper Tudor, the late Duke of Buckingham and others who had fallen foul of Richard III.\n\nThe Queen's council went further - Howard had fallen at Burford but his son was stripped of the Norfolk inheritance (which passed to the Queen under the terms of the Act settling it on her late brother Richard Duke of York), Richard's assets were also split - the aged Countess of Warwick was restored to her Beauchamp inheritance (but only until her death when it would pass to her grandson the Queen's cousin the Earl of Warwick) and the Neville assets in the north were restored to the numerous Neville co-heirs.\n\nThe bigger question was who the Queen would marry - there was a small and determined group around her who hoped she would ditch the Scots betrothal and marry Henry Tudor, others wanted the Scots betrothal ditched in favour of a more impressive match with a foreign prince.\n\nThe Queen though in the words of one chronicler \"devoted\" to the memory of her father and his wishes in this matter - to Elizabeth she was \"honour-bound\" to marry James IV as soon as he was of age and in a meeting with the Earl of Angus she confirmed that those who wished her to break the match were not to be heard.\n\nThe Scots party would spend Christmas 1485 in London before returning North in the New Year. It was notable that James IV was present at major occasions accompany the Queen as she celebrated the season at Westminster.\n\nIn January James and Angus left and the Queen and her court removed to the palace of Sheen.\n\nThe Queen's sisters were also now back on the marriage market.\n\nCecily of York was now nearly 16, Anne just turned 10, Catherine 6, and Bridget 5 - the Queen confirmed that each would receive the dowers promised by her late father subject that they married with the Queen's approval. It was still debatable whether the girls carried a claim to the throne though Elizabeth's accession certainly implied that they did.\n\nUnder the terms of Dorset's agreement with the exiled Lancastrians - Cecily was intended to marry Henry Tudor and with the Queen seemingly committed to the Scots alliance Henry's supporters on the council now pushed his claim to marry the lady Cecily. The match was supported by the Queen Dowager and of course Henry's mother - surprisingly Lady Margaret had always been well-liked by the family of Edward IV and during Richard's rule had maintained contact with Elizabeth Woodville.\n\nAn alternate proposal with Elizabeth marrying Henry and Cecily marrying James IV was suggested but again the Queen wished to retain her Scots match.\n\nShe probably rightly guessed that a foreign monarch would by nature allow her a semblance of independence that a domestic husband might not.\n\nIn the end the Queen gave in and confirmed that Cecily would marry the Earl of Richmond in March (on her 16th birthday).\n\nWith Cecily's marriage assured and the Queen looking secure on her throne - foreign offers began to come for the Queen's sisters.\n\nThe French regent keen to ensure England remained a peaceful neighbour was keen to renew a marital tie - and suggested Anne of York marry Charles Count of Anjouleme or Francois Count of Vendome (both were Prince's of the Blood but far distant to the throne given the youth of the French King).\n\nElizabeth was reluctant as neither match was of the ambition or scale of her father's intentions and she informed the French she thought her sisters too young for either gentleman. She countered with the suggestion that should the King be free then naturally she would be greatly honoured if he chose as his consort on of her sisters. Nominally of course Charles VIII was still betrothed to Margaret of Austria who all those years earlier he had ditched Elizabeth of York for.\n\nFor the time being her younger sisters would remain unwed and unbetrothed in the care of their mother.\n\nThe first months of Elizabeth's reign continued in the same trend - the Queen followed the lifestyle of her parents taking the court from palace to palace along the Thames Valley.\n\nThe Queen's closest companions were her sister Cecily, her half sister Grace (an illegitimate daughter of Edward IV) and her aunt the Duchess of Buckingham. Her household was largely run by the Duchess who was only a decade older than the Queen.\n\nThe Queen's council followed her progresses with the coterie of her closest nobles in constant attendance. Dorset was now regarded as supreme and for many was the real monarch but his power was checked by the Earl of Oxford and the Earl of Northumberland both of whom jealousy guarded their own power bases.\n\nIn March 1486 the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury died and the Queen and her brother indicated that they wished their uncle Lionel Bishop of Salisbury to replace him. Oxford and Northumberland objected both pointing out that the Bishop was very young to lead the church in England and offered alternatives in the end the Queen to Dorset's anger acquiesed and John Morton Bishop of Ely was formally nominated by the Queen. Lionel bitter in his disappointment was rewarded being placed head of the team of negotiators set up in October 1486 to formalize the marriage treaty between the Queen and the King of Scots (ahead of the King's 14 birthday in March 1487).\n\nThe Queen's advice to the negotiators was to follow the example of the King of Aragon and the Queen of Castile were both had retained their individual royal authority.\n\nMorton soon proved a loyal advisor to the Queen and in February 1487 she dismissed Rotherham of York from the Council and appointed Morton as Lord Chancellor in his stead. Morton was keen at restoring the royal finances and enforcing the Queen's revenue rights - by her command he would soon lead the council.\n\nHistorians have seen Morton's rise as the Queen trying to distance herself from her half brother just as her father had tried to distance himself from Warwick twenty years earlier.\n\nDorset remained a key influence and his consolation prize was confirmation of his son Edward Grey's betrothal to the Queen's cousin Ann St Leger and confirmation that she would inherit the Holland Exter inheritance with the marriage to take place in 1488 when Anne was 12. The Queen went further and created her brother Duke of Exeter on March 29 1487.\n\nJames IV turned 14 in that same month - and dismissed Angus as regent taking control of his own government - James was ambitious,cultured and well-educated.\n\nHe was also a handsome young man as many women of his court attested to.\n\nAlthough still resentful of how he and his men had been treated by the English he still seemed keen on the English match and ordered Angus and the other commissioners to continue the long-drawn out negotiations.\n\nTo James Elizabeth was the pretty young woman who had first come to Scotland four years earlier and certainly he remained attracted to her which for a royal marriage was unusual at a time where most royal couples had never met before their betrothal and marriage.\n\nFor the Scot's Elizabeth's only failing was her nationality.\n\nEventually agreement was reached - The Treaty of Falkland - signed by James and Elizabeth's representatives at Falkland Palace on July 13th 1487.\n\nThe treaty agreed there should be a \"true, sincere, whole and unbroken peace, friendship, league and amity between the said Princes for the terms of life of each and between them and their wholy longed for heirs and successors...\"\n\nIt also included the contract for the marriage of Elizabeth and James - neither it was agreed would bear the cost of the other's household, neither would receive any \"annuity or maintenance\" for each other's realms. Though when resident in England the Queen's household would bear the cost and maintenance of the King's and should the Queen venture north James would be liable for the costs incurred. James would be King of England during the Queen's lifetime only. Their realms would be jointly inherited by their issue as per the customs of England and of Scotland. In default of any issue they would each be succeeded by their lawful successors and neither could inherit the other's throne.\n\nIt also at James insistance included the return to the Scots of Berwick with the town being surrendered one month from the King and Queen's marriage. There were guarantees on trade and further more it confirmed the King and Queen would make diplomatic decisions as \"one\". James' name would come first in all formal styles of the royal couple and would have a full role in the governance of England as fitting for a man.\n\nJames had been expecting to travel south for the marriage at some point soon after - hopefully in time to be crowned with his wife in London (the Queen's coronation was set for September 8) with his mother appointed to govern Scotland in his stead however he was told that there would not be time for the English Parliament to meet and confirm the Marriage and it was better to wait - there was also the matter of the Papal dispensation as both were decsended from John of Gaunt (James through Joan Beaufort Queen of Scots and Elizabeth through her grandmother Cecily Neville)\n\nOnce confirmed the treaty would be enshrined in English law as Queen Elizabeth's Marriage Act by her second parliament summoned in September 1487.\n\nTo James anger the act imposed additional restrictions on him - although he was to co-reign with the Queen most of the power would remain with her (in effect his ability to act in England would depend on his relationship with his wife), he was also forbidden to take the Queen to Scotland (other than for her crowning) without the consent of the Queen, her council or Parliament. It also stated the King could not take any of their children out of the country without consent. He was also banned from appointing Scots to any office in England. ( collected Acts of Parliament: Eliz 2 session 1).\n\nElizabeth's September coronation had been a spectacular affair and had been modelled on her father's - and was administered by Archbishop Morton and the Bishop of London Thomas Kempe. The Queen was attended by a number of young ladies under the guidance of the new Countess of Richmond including her sister Anne, her cousin's Ann St Leger, Margaret Plantagenet and Elizabeth Stafford. Buckingham as Lord High Steward was considered too young to bear the Crown as was traditional so instead for the coronation the Duke of Exeter was appointed to act as his deputy.\n\nTwo months after the coronation - the papal dispensation permitting the Queen's marriage arrived - James' representatives in London now pressed the English for a date and location for the marriage.\n\nIn the end the couple would not marry until late April 1488. The Scots had been keen on an earlier date but both courts were reluctant to travel far in cold January or February weather. A March marriage would have to be early to avoid Lent. The Scots had suggested the week after Easter (which fell in early April) but the Queen did not want to marry so close to the anniversary of her father's death.\n\nIn the end both parties agreed on the wedding taking place at York on the 28th April.\n\nYork itself was a compromise - the English suggested that James IV should travel south immediately after Easter and the wedding could take place in London. The Scots didn't like how that might look that the groom was having to come to the bride implying James was somehow the junior partner in the relationship - after much debate York was chosen. The choice for the English was York once loyal to the Lancastrians and then to Richard III would be greatly honoured by the choice and it would be a useful reminder to the north of who was their sovereign - a chance for York to show its loyalty.\n\nThe Earl of Northumberland was responsible of acquiring lodgings for the two courts and the city corporation were quick to mount magnificant displays to welcome the Queen to the city - prominant amongst the pageantry was Elizabeth's personal badge adopted from her father of the White Rose en Soleil (imposed on a Sun in Splendour), the Queen's household staff could easily be spotted in York dressed in the Yorkist colours of blue and murray. James' household staff proudly wore his badge of the red lion rampant. Some even stiched the white rose over the heart of the lion to show the union of James with Elizabeth.\n\nThe Queen was supported at the ceremony conducted by Archbishop Rotherham by her younger sister Anne, her cousins Anne St Leger, Margaret Plantagenent and Elizabeth Stafford under the watchful eye of the Duchesses of Exeter and Buckingham. The Countess of Richmond did not attend as she was \"greate with childe\".\n\nAfter the wedding the Royal couple were entertained to a great dinner by the City of York before their formal putting to bed in the hastily refurbished lodgings of the Abbot of St Mary's. The couple remained in York for several days before beginning the journey south - which turned into a six-week long slow progress through England.\n\nThey arrived in London to great rejoicing in early June - the Queen appeared radiant and very content and the young King seemed most courteous towards his wife.\n\nElizabeth's formal proclamation of the royal couple's style was simple \"James and Elizabeth, King and Queen of England, of Scotland and of France and Lord and Lady of Ireland\".\n\nWhilst personally the couple appeared content their households were soon at odds - issues of precedence, national pride and new rivalries did not a happy mix make.\n\nThe King himself was all affable with everyone but Dorset and others around the Queen were incensed when the young man joined the Queen in council pulling up a stool and sitting by her. Worse it soon became apparent that the Queen expected the council to listen to her husband and act on his instructions as she wrote to Dorset \"as if the king were us\".\n\nBy early July the English council began to really fear King James as the Queen was clearly in the early stages of pregnancy - her ladies reporting gleefully the Queen had morning sickness. James might be only 15 but he clearly knew his duty.\n\nThe couple would soon be separated as James received news from Scotland that his mother was seriously ill and near to death - James would race north whether out of genuine concern for his mother or a fear that with her guiding hand gone his younger brother the 12-year-old Duke of Ross might be promoted as a rival to the King by ambitious courtiers.\n\nHis sudden departure delighted much of Elizabeth's council though the Queen herself was somewhat less enthusiastic at James departure."
