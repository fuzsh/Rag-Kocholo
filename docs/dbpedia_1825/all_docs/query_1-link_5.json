        "text": "Main\n\nJohn of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall was born 15 August 1316 in Eltham Palace, Kent, England, United Kingdom to Edward II of England (1284-1327) and Isabella Capet (c1295-1358) and died 13 September 1336 Perth, Scotland, United Kingdom of unspecified causes.\n\nBiography\n\nHe gained the title of Earl of Cornwall on 6 October 1328.1\n\nHe was due to marry Maria, daughter of Ferdinand IV, King of Castile and Leon but the marriage did not take place.\n\nJohn of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336) was the second son of King Edward II of England and Isabella of France. He was born in Eltham Palace, Kent, England and was named after his father's father, King John of England.\n\nIn 1321, John was created Earl of Cornwall, a title which had traditionally been held by the king's eldest son. However, because John's older brother, Edward III, had already been created Earl of Chester, John was given the lesser title of Earl of Cornwall instead.\n\nDespite his young age, John was involved in politics and military affairs. In 1330, when his brother Edward III overthrew their mother's lover and regent, Roger Mortimer, John was one of the earls who supported Edward in his coup. After Mortimer's execution, John was appointed as the Chief Guardian of Scotland, a position he held until his death.\n\nHe died in Perth, Scotland, in 1336, at the age of 20. John's death was a great loss to his family and to the English nobility, as he was considered to be a promising and talented young man.\n\nBetrothals\n\nAs the younger brother of the English monarch, since early childhood marital negotiations were made for John: in March 1328 Edward III entered into negotiations for a marriage between his brother and María Díaz de Haro, heiress of the Lordship of Biscay.[lower-alpha 1]\n\nBy contract signed on 28 September 1334, John was then betrothed with Maria de La Cerda, Lady of Lunel and daughter of Ferdinand de la Cerda (grandson of King Alfonso X of Castile) by his wife Juana Núñez de Lara, Lady of Lara.[2] A dispensation was sought, but the contract was abandoned when relations between Edward III and King Philip VI of France worsened in late 1334. Marie married Charles d'Évreux at Poissy in April 1335.[3]\n\nIn December 1335 were made negotiations for a marriage with Joan, Countess of Penthièvre and heiress of the Duchy of Brittany;[lower-alpha 2] however, it doesn't seem that these arrangement resulted in an official betrothal.\n\nSiblings\n\nOffspring of Edward II of England (1284-1327) and Isabella Capet (c1295-1358) Name Birth Death Joined with Edward III of England (1312-1377) 13 November 1312 Windsor Castle, Berkshire, England, United Kingdom 21 June 1377 Sheen Palace, Surrey, England, United Kingdom Philippa of Hainaut (1311-1369) John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336) 15 August 1316 Eltham Palace, Kent, England, United Kingdom 13 September 1336 Perth, Scotland, United Kingdom Eleanor of England (1318-1355) 18 June 1318 22 April 1355 Reinoud II van Gelre (c1295-1343) Joan of England (1321-1362) 5 July 1321 Tower of London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom 7 September 1362 Hertford Castle, Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom David II of Scotland (1324-1371)\n\nOffspring of Edward II of England (1284-1327) and unknown parent Name Birth Death Joined with Adam FitzRoy (c1307-1322) 1307 England, United Kingdom 19 August 1322 England, United Kingdom\n\nSee Also\n\nwikipedia:en:John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall\n\nJohn of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall at thePeerage\n\nJohn of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall - Geni.com\n\nJohn of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall at Find A Grave\n\n\"John , earl of Cornwall (1316–1336)\".
