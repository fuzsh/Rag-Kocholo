        "text": "Starting from the 19th century much has been said about English alabaster as material for religious sculpture. With over 3.000 estimated surviving pieces scattered worldwide, English alabasters constitute indeed one of the best-known and largest class of reliefs. As is well known, the vast majority of pieces, removed from churches in Britain during the Reformation and the Iconoclasm that follows, is now preserved in museums or places that have no correspondence with the original contexts. Naturally, this circumstance is problematic and has in fact influenced the types of studies dedicated to English alabasters, which, after the pioneering contributions of St John Hope and Hildburgh, have been focused for the most part on isolated pieces in specific collections, or on distinct categories and iconographic repertories. One of the biggest challenges that scholars still need to face, therefore, regards the examination of how English alabasters were experienced by medieval and early modern worshippers in the church interiors they were created for. Starting from an investigation of defined groups of alabaster panels that belonged to different parish churches in Cambridgeshire, including St Mary and Andrew at Whittlesford and All Saints in Little Shelford, this paper aims at filling this gap in research. Embracing notions on the materiality of devotion, on the agency and reception of art, it will examine these artefacts as part of dynamic immersive environments, where the spiritual and emotional response of the audience was activated by different sensorial stimuli, triggered by multimodal devotional practices. In order to reach its goals, the paper will delve into comparative sets of materials, including archival records and historical sources, normative books, and the extent alabaster reliefs.\n\nThis paper examines two groups of mid-fourteenth-century monuments, comprising three military effi gies and two associated ladies, at Northmoor (Oxfordshire) and Winterbourne (Gloucestershire). The armour shown on the three military figures is unusual but virtually identical, and all five monuments are evidently from the same workshop. Yet petrologic analysis shows that the stylistic group transcends the materials employed. The effigies appear to be the work of a single group of well-trained sculptors who came to the church site to work, using locally available stone rather than carving the fi gures at a central urban workshop before transporting them to Northmoor and Winterbourne.\n\nThis paper explores the main functions of memorials and how they influenced iconographical aspects of late medieval tomb design, specifically English brasses and incised slabs. The secular aspects of medieval monuments, with their emphasis on status and family pride, are frequently more striking than the sacred aspects; often they dominate the composition and in many cases they have been more extensively studied. As St. Augustine recognised, as well as being a solace to the living, monuments served the purpose of providing assistance to the dead. Indeed many regarded this as their main purpose. Once a person was dead and in Purgatory, the sentence could be shortened by prayer and intercession. The value of the prayers of the living to the purification of the dead in Purgatory was a central tenet of medieval faith, and it was therefore vital to a believer that prayers for his or her soul should be said and masses sung. This aim was reflected in many aspects of tomb design, with attention being drawn to the good works of the person commemorated."
