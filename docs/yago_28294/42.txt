History of Queen Sonja's day

Queen Sonja was born in Oslo on July 4, 1937, to commoners. She studied dressmaking and tailoring, and received a degree in fashion and social sciences — perhaps this explains her impeccable taste! She also received a diploma from a Swiss finishing school. She met then-Crown Prince Harald at a gathering in 1959, and they began dating immediately.

Due to the contentious nature of their relationship, they kept their relationship a secret. A royal, especially the future King, was not permitted to woo commoners, at least not until Harald. Even before their marriage in 1968, Sonja and the then-Crown Prince Harald had been dating for nine years. Harald had warned his father, King Olav V, that if he did not give his consent for him to marry Sonja, he would remain unmarried. Eventually, King Olav V approved the marriage and Sonja received recognition at her wedding in 1968.

Harald and Sonja were crowned King and Queen of Norway in Oslo in 1991. The Queen has long been an active humanitarian, particularly in favor of children’s organizations and the Red Cross. She accompanies the King on royal visits and hosts visiting dignitaries. Her various interests include painting, music, and hiking through Norway. Together with the King, she is a ceramicist and painter. Queen Sonja is immensely popular in her homeland. Sonja is one of the most popular girl names these days, with many people naming their daughters after her. The Queen’s birthday is honored across the country by all departments of the government and state agencies, as well as many homes because Norwegians take national pride seriously.
