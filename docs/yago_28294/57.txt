Happy Anniversary to King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, who got married on this day 49 years ago! In honour of their anniversary, we are featuring the wedding of the then Crown Prince Harald and Sonja Haraldsen-

Sonja Haraldsen arrived at Oslo Cathedral with King Olav, a great mark of approval as the King initially disapproved of the marriage and only relented after his only son and heir said he would remain a bachelor if he couldn’t marry Sonja.

After the ceremony, the new Crown Prince couple drove through the streets of Oslo in a 1966 Lincoln Continental convertible, later used at the wedding of their son, Crown Prince Haakon, in 2001.
