        "text": "Have a look inside this home that carries an important history of our royal couple and monarchy.\n\nThe house was built for the Haraldsen family in Oslo in 1935. Sonja Haraldsen lived here most of the time until she married Crown Prince Harald in 1968.\n\nFrom their secret relationship started in 1959 they had to wait nine years before they received King Olav's approval to marry. During this time, Tuengen allé 1B, home of Sonja's mother, was one of the few places they could meet.\n\nThe house is built in a functional style, which was very popular in the 1930s. The exterior looks like when the house was newly built.\n\nInside it is mainly decorated as in 1968, when Sonja moved out and became Norway's Crown Princess.\n\nThe first floor of Queen Sonja's childhood home was restored in August 2018. Since then the work has continued and now the whole house is completely restored."
