        "text": "This official portrait of King Harald and Queen Sonja was released in 2016 to mark the King's Silver Jubilee.\n\nThe Norwegian royals celebrated Harald's 25th year of his reign with a series of events, including a lavish banquet with many of the European royal families in attendance.\n\nThe then Prince Harald with wife Sonja on their wedding day in 1968.\n\nSonja wore a silk wedding gown by Norwegian department store, Molstad and sported flowers in her hair instead of a tiara to secure her veil.\n\nThe couple had dated for nine years but there was controversy over their romance, as Sonja was a commoner.\n\nHarald told his father Olav that if he was not allowed to marry Sonja he would not marry at all. This would have been a disaster as it would have ended the reign of his family and the Norwegian monarchy, as Harald was the sole heir to the throne.\n\nHarald and Sonja welcomed their first child, Princess Martha Louise, on 22 September 1971.\n\nAlthough Martha Louise is two years older than her brother, Crown Prince Haakon, she did not feature in the order of succession at the time of her birth, because constitutional law at the time dictated that only males could inherit the Norwegian throne.\n\nThe law changed in 1990 but only applied to those born that year or later.\n\nFemales born between 1971 and 1990 were given succession rights but their brothers would still be before them in the line of succession.\n\nPrincess Martha Louise shares three daughters with her late husband, Ari Behn, (who died by suicide in 2019) â€“ Maud, Leah and Emma.\n\nThe palace also released a portrait of the King with his two heirs, Crown Prince Haakon and Princess Ingrid Alexandra, to mark his Silver Jubilee in 2016.\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra is second in line to Norway's throne after her father, Haakon, and is expected to become the country's second female monarch, after the 15th-century Queen Margaret."
