        "text": "mims111 said:\n\nWell you shocked me Johann!\n\nOh, I’m sorry. But I didn’t write the article – I just stumbled across it.\n\nI alway thought that king and queen has almost perfect relationship! Well nothing is perfect and if it is true, Im happy, that they stayed together.\n\nBTW I had the same impression. Maybe it’s just gossip. I don’t know how reliable that Per Egil Hegge is. And Se og Hør articles always have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\ni heard about something like that before, too.\n\nWell, I didn't hear they were about to divorce, but it was said that the King and the Queen were living in different parts of the palace because they had some marriage problems... but I don't know.. Cannot say anything about this.\n\nAnyway it's nice to see them so close again (during the StateVisit to Switzerland for example). Love won, right?\n\nThe King and Queen has admitted they have had their ups and downs in the marriage like most couple but that they work trough it, in the 80/90s they were not living in different parts of the palace as they were living at Skaugum . Se og Hør today in VG retracts the statement that it was Crown Prince Harald who sent his Head Aide de campe to the president of Stortinget to hear about a divorce. Friends of Harald and Sonja says to VG today that divorce never was an issue, but that the public lifestyle put strains on their marriage. There are noithing written about anyone else involved, just the public preassure on them and how they did their work and the rather old fashioned way the Crown Prince was raised. Sonja once said something like he discussed it with himself and then it woul be that way, and that it took some getting used to.\n\nPer Egil Hegge who is very credible and is writing the auhtorised book on the King which will come out in two weeks or so, to mark his 70th birthday has no comment, the president of Stortinget back then Jo Benkow has no comment, The then Prime Minister Kåre Willoch says he has never heared about any divorce rumours, and the palace spokesperson says the King and Queen does not know if someone talked to the President of Stortinget about a divorce. Accoding to VG the King and Queen was more than suprised when they saw the cover of Se og Hør yesterday.\n\nAtene said:\n\nQueen Sonja love art, so I think she will get lot of art.\n\nMaybe she'll get a picture painted by Queen Margrethe II...\n\nI guess it's much easier to find a good present for a Queen than for a King.\n\nI hope King Harald will give her some new jewels.\n\nOf course I am hoping for a new Tiara (but I don't think so.. since she got a new one for her 60th)... or maybe some new ear rings or necklaces...\n\nHer_Majesty said:\n\nMaybe she'll get a picture painted by Queen Margrethe II...\n\nI guess it's much easier to find a good present for a Queen than for a King.\n\nI hope King Harald will give her some new jewels.\n\nOf course I am hoping for a new Tiara (but I don't think so.. since she got a new one for her 60th)... or maybe some new ear rings or necklaces...\n\nYes, I`m sure that QS will get a picture painted by QM\n\nAccording to this aftenposten article (in English) Harald and Sonja were about to divorce in the eighties.\n\nMaybe a poster who is familiar with the Norwegian court and press (Larzen, norwegianne?!) can assess this: Is this just gossip or is there perhaps some truth in it?\n\nThank God the two of them stuck it out. I mean it now gives the younger set (i.e. The Crown Couple) a shining example to look upon. I know it had to be difficult for Queen Sonja - not being allowed to marry her true love for many years, the public pressures of being the only female royal in Norway for years and the miscarriages - but it just speaks to her character and her deep, abiding love for her husband, her family and the Norwegian people that she would endure all this and stand beside him.\n\nI know it had to be difficult for Queen Sonja - not being allowed to marry her true love for many years, the public pressures of being the only female royal in Norway for years and the miscarriages - but it just speaks to her character and her deep, abiding love for her husband, her family and the Norwegian people that she would endure all this and stand beside him.\n\nWell said, I couldn't put it any better. I think Sonja's an incredibly strong woman. And welcome to the forums!\n\nI read about that in yellow press. But it was in mid or early 90. around Sonja's renovation's time.\n\nI love the press's implication there: \"Sonja! If you order any more new china or spend any more money on wallpaper, I'm leaving you!\" I'm sure that's EXACTLY how conversations at the palace were going. You gotta love the press.\n\nI think they're just not as demonstrative - I've always heard that Harald's very shy, so he's probably not the sort of person who's comfortable with much affection in public. There wasn't even a whole lot of hand-holding and such in pictures at the time of their engagement (except for the posed ones). I think he's just way too shy to kiss Sonja in the middle of a press conference on national TV, like Henrik did a few days ago with Margrethe. Some of Harald and Sonja's sweeter pictures are when they're not directly in front of cameras - for example, there was a photo from her 70th birthday where they were standing on a porch and hugging, and it had been shot from some distance away. He also seems - and this is something that doesn't come across as much in still photos as it does in some of the videos I've seen - to be really gentle with her when they do touch, for example when they come out onto the dance floor in the video of his 70th birthday. As for Margrethe and Henrik...Henrik's a Frenchman, what do you expect?\n\nQueen Sonja gets a good coverage today, in Norway as well as Denmark:\n\nNødstedte piger fik uventet hjælp: Dronning Sonja trådte til med førstehjælp til skadet sejler - Royale | www.bt.dk\n\nTønsbergs Blad - Fikk førstehjelp av Dronning Sonja\n\nOff the island of Mågerø a boat with three girls ended up in troube when one of the girls cut herself badly on the boats propeller.\n\nFortunately a boat passed nearby. That boat assisted the girls into a cove on the island, located next to the royal residence there.\n\nHere bodyguards provided first aid for the injured girl who was then taken to a hospital. As I read the article Queen Sonja offered comfort, also for the two other girls by wrapping them in blankets.\n\nThe story is confirmed by the court: \"I can confirm that the Queen and staff from the escort-service took part in helping an injured girl at the shore near the Royal cottage\"."
