        "text": "In an ongoing series of documentaries about their lives, NRK reported how Olav invited [Sonja] along with other friends to a birthday dinner for his son at the palace and she happily attended. [...] The invitations from the palace stopped when Olav finally became aware that his son was serious about Sonja Haraldsen. [...] Their separations were difficult, and they told NRK they tried to break up on several occasions, but both were miserable.\n\nThe press in Norway, meanwhile, kept quiet about the romance, only daring to write a few lines after reports of their relationship had made news in the British and Swedish press. No Norwegian editor wanted to challenge the palace, which remained silent. It wasn’t until 1964 that local newspapers wrote about the “rumours” that had been reported abroad.\n\nThe Labour Party government at the time saw constitutional problems with any marriage between Harald and Sonja, and the powerful Labour Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen was firmly opposed to one. He sent out a press release claiming that no question of marriage had crossed his table, a move viewed as a denial of any pending engagement announcement. More years passed and then Crown Prince Harald finally found the courage to tell his father that if he couldn’t marry Sonja Haraldsen, he would be remain unmarried. And that really did put the monarchy at risk. His two sisters were both married to commoners, and it was unclear who would then be heir to the throne after Harald.\n\n[…] It was unusual at that time for a young woman like Sonja Haraldsen to remain unmarried at that age [30], and Harald told NRK he worried he would ruin her life. “We just kept waiting and hoping that they’d all finally back down,” he said. In the meantime, Sonja’s mother Dagny Haraldsen allowed the couple to meet at her home. That was among their only free space.\n\nKing Olav finally gave in to the idea but still needed a green light from the government. […] Finally, wrote Dagsavisen editor Arne Strand, [conservative Prime Minister Per] Borten took the easier way out, and said his government would not advise against the marriage. It wouldn’t support it, but it wouldn’t challenge it either. […]\n\n[…] When Harald and Sonja’s own son, the current Crown Prince Haakon, fell in love and wanted to marry a single mother with a history of wild partying behind her, they supported him and King Harald didn’t ask the Stoltenberg government for advice but merely informed it that a wedding loomed.\n\nRoyal romance raised a ruckus"
