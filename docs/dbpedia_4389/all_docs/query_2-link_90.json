        "text": "Tiffany A. Tat, “PLA Navy Reserve: Out of the Shadows and into the Forefront?” CMSI Note 7 (Newport, RI: Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute, 5 August 2024).\n\nFrom CMSI Director Christopher Sharman:\n\nChina Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI) Friends and Colleagues –\n\nA few days ago, the PLA celebrated “PLA Day” – a military holiday commemorating the founding of the PLA in 1927. As part of the commemoration, Xi Jinping called for building strong border, sea and air defenses to protect the country’s territorial sovereignty and maritime interests. While a common refrain from Xi, his statements influence the trajectory of the PLA’s development.\n\nReforming and improving the PLA military Reserve is one way China’s military is incorporating Xi’s guidance. With this in mind, CMSI is pleased to provide you with CMSI Note #7.\n\nThis CMSI Note breaks new ground on an understudied and underreported topic – the PRC’s efforts to enhance the capabilities of the PLA Reserve. This CMSI Note identifies the locations of several Chinese Navy Reserve units, discusses their roles and missions, as highlights distinguishing markings on Reserve uniforms and on Reserve warships. It also addresses potential challenges the PLA may face as seeks to integrate more civilian expertise into its Reserve forces.\n\nThis CMSI Note is an excellent primer on the People’s Liberation Army Navy Reserve – a topic that warrants far more research. Its timely release coincides with President Xi’s PLA Day directives just a few days ago. This CMSI Note was authored by CMSI’s own, Professor Tiffany Tat. Her insights and efforts to uncover new details about the PLAN Reserve provide a vital addition to the body of literature on China’s Navy. Kudos to her for her painstaking efforts to begin to address this important topic – more to follow!\n\nSummary\n\nAs a part China’s goal to build a fully modernized military by 2035, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is improving its reserve forces through increased defense spending, critical policy changes, and organizational restructuring. Reserve forces (后备力量) encompass the PLA Reserve (预备役部队) and paramilitary forces, such as the militia, which fall under the leadership of the Central Military Commission and can be mobilized by the National Defense Mobilization Department to support combat.2 The many components that make up China’s fighting force such as active-duty PLA forces, China Coast Guard, and the militia have been studied in depth; however, the PLA Reserve remains an understudied and underreported topic. While the PLA Reserve represents a fraction of the force structure of their active-duty counterparts, recent changes in military reform specific to the PLA Reserve highlight the importance of this relatively small force and the evolving role reservists (预备役人员) may play within the PLA.3\n\nCMSI Perspectives and Key Takeaways:\n\nA focus on reforming the PLA Reserve signals ongoing efforts at military readiness and may be an indicator China is preparing for a scenario in which additional resources are required to replace active-duty casualties.\n\nThe PLA seeks to shrink the Army Reserve and grow the Reserves of the PLA Navy (PLAN), PLA Rocket Force (PLARF) and PLA Air Force (PLAAF) which may indicate the PLA is preparing to engage more in these non-ground force domains.\n\nNew reforms affecting the PLA Reserve seek to attract civilian talent in addition to retaining former active-duty veterans. The widening of eligibility and recruitment to civilians with no prior active-duty service is another form of attempted military-civilian fusion as the PLA aims to capitalize on specific technical skills from the civilian sector.\n\nReserve forces, and more specifically the PLAN Reserve, can be mobilized in a cross-Strait invasion scenario, giving the PLAN a source of strategic depth in manpower capabilities.\n\nDiscussion\n\nInitial research efforts have identified at least five distinct PLAN Reserve units, but the exact size of the PLAN Reserve and number of units is not currently publicly available.5 Three of these units are Mobile Radar and Observation Battalions located in Qingdao, Xiamen, and Shenzhen. A Reconnaissance Ship Squadron is based in Yantai and a Minesweeper Squadron is based in Ningbo.6 The primary mission set of the PLAN Reserve varies depending on time, place, situation, and unit capabilities. Of the five units identified, their duties may include but are not limited to performing tasking related to maritime reconnaissance, countermine warfare, service support for other vessels, electronic warfare, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), search and rescue, or local level security. PLAN Reserve units operate either independently or in coordination with active-duty PLAN forces. Notably, PLAN Reserve units have been observed participating in several active-duty PLAN exercises, which is a testament to this force’s ability to mobilize and integrate with their active-duty counterparts in increasingly realistic scenarios.7\n\nPLAN reservists are distinct in appearance, capabilities, and purpose; and therefore, should not be confused or conflated with the China Coast Guard, the Maritime Militia, active-duty PLA, or any other reserve force. As depicted in Graphic 2, PLAN reservists wear the PLAN uniform while on duty and a ‘Y’ insignia on their uniform distinguishes reservists from their active-duty counterparts.8 The PLAN Reserve has historically drawn primarily from prior service active-duty veterans and their experience operating heavy weaponry and specialized military equipment makes this force uniquely positioned to support, augment, and even replace active-duty PLAN forces. When not in duty status, PLAN reservists are able to maintain civilian employment and are excused from their civilian duties when called to military service.9\n\nAt present, there are three major reforms affecting the evolution of PLAN Reserve. The first is a commitment to decrease PLAA Reserve and increase PLAN, PLAAF, and PLARF Reserves. The second reform is to optimize the PLA Reserve organizational structure to adapt to future combat needs and integrate with the active-duty component.10 The third reform, codified in the 2023 Reservist Law, widens the net of eligibility to include, notably, non-prior service individuals with special technical or professional skills from the civilian sector.11 These reforms are being implemented through a series of changes in military legislation and new policies governing the PLA Reserve specifically. … … …\n\nPREVIOUS NOTES IN THIS CMSI SERIES:\n\nCMSI Notes are short, timely analyses of recent China maritime events.\n\nDaniel Clayton Rice, “Sharpening the Sword: Chinese Navy Aircraft Carrier Battle Group Defense Zones,” CMSI Note 6 (Newport, RI: Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute, 16 July 2024).\n\nFrom CMSI Director Christopher Sharman:\n\nChina Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI) Friends and Colleagues –\n\nCMSI is pleased to provide you with CMSI Note #6. This CMSI Note details Chinese Central Television-7 (the CCTV Defense and Military channel) reporting about three concentric defensive rings (or zones) that surround People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) aircraft carriers.\n\nThe videos were part of CCTV-7’s popular military technology series, “Sharpening the Sword.” They were aired to commemorate the PLAN’s 75th anniversary.\n\nNot only do the videos detail the three zones, they also address carrier battle group (CVBG) command and control, roles and responsibilities of ships, submarines and aircraft that support carrier operations, and the types of carrier-based flight operations the PLAN conducts. This CMSI Note captures many of these details.\n\nThis Note will be of particular value to those who are interested in some of the terms of art used to describe PLAN CVBG operations. While far from authoritative, the videos from the “Sharpening the Sword” series provide a window into possible PLAN thinking about the organization and structure of both current and future carrier CVBG operations.\n\nThis CMSI note was authored by Mr. Dan Rice. Mr. Rice is a China Political and Military Strategy Subject Matter Expert at the Brute Krulak Center for Innovation and Future Warfare at the Marine Corps University. CMSI thanks Dan for flagging this program and capturing its details for this CMSI Note.\n\nPerspectives and Key Takeaways\n\n• Chinese state media’s Channel 7 recently released a series of videos that described China’s aircraft carriers and the carrier battle groups, including their history, composition, and operational theory.\n\n• The videos describe the carrier battle group (CVBG) “Outer Defense Zone” (外防区), also called the “Depth Defense Zone” (纵深防区), as 185 km to 400 km away from the aircraft carrier.\n\n• The “Middle Defense Zone” (中防区), or the “Area Defense Zone” (区域防区) is described as 45 km to 185 km away from the aircraft carrier.\n\n• The video details the “Inner Defense Zone” (内防区), otherwise called the “Point Defense Zone” (点防区), as 100 meters to 45 km away from the aircraft carrier.\n\n• According to the videos, air operations from the carriers are generally divided into two types of flight operations: the “Split wave operational pattern” (分波作业方式) and the “Continuous operational pattern” (连续作业方式).\n\nContext\n\nTo commemorate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), Chinese state media’s Channel 7 released a series of videos on 25 April 2024 showcasing PLAN capabilities.2 The videos were part of CCTV 7’s popular military technology series, “Sharpening the Sword.” Likely intended for domestic consumption, the videos focused on Chinese navy operations as the PLAN continues “Going towards the Deep Blue (走向深蓝)”. Chinese media frequently uses this phrase to describe efforts to expand PLAN fleet operations, which is based on the title of a maritime strategy book sharing the same name.3\n\nThe video series included a discussion of how CVBGs could be organized for future fleet operations. According to the video, the organization of a CVBG is broken down into three concentric rings centered on the aircraft carrier. Each expanding ring emphasizes different warfare disciplines. Table 1 summarizes these zones. While mission requirements are likely to dictate the composition of specific ships supporting future CVBG operations, the zones depicted in the videos provide a glimpse into the potential organization of CVBG operations. … … …\n\nConclusion\n\nThe PLAN is entering into what Chinese media often refers to as the “three carrier generation” (三航母时代) – when it will have three operational aircraft carriers that can be employed to project power.16 In the PLAN’s “three carrier generation”, the PLAN will likely deploy its CVBGs deeper into the western Pacific and possibly into the Indian Ocean. Many of these deployments are also likely to be experimental, serving as a proving ground to test PLAN power projection capabilities. The disposition of the three zones described in the Sharpening the Sword video series may be one of several ideas the PLAN is experimenting with as it integrates CVBG into routine fleet operations. The videos seem to suggest that operational insights can potentially be gleaned through observations of CVBG operations. The type of flight operations – split wave or continuous operational pattern – may reveal the PLAN’s training focus and the disposition of surface ships around the carrier may indicate the tasks and responsibilities assigned to individual ships. While far from authoritative, these videos provide a window into possible PLAN thinking about the organization and structure of current and future carrier battle group operations.\n\n***\n\nAndrew S. Erickson, “Admiral Wang Renhua: Exemplifying Jointness and Oversight for China’s Navy amid Xi’s Grade-and-Rank Reforms,” CMSI Note 5 (Newport, RI: Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute, 11 April 2024).\n\nFrom CMSI Director Christopher Sharman:\n\nChina Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI) Friends and Colleagues –\n\nCMSI is pleased to provide you with CMSI Note #5. It elucidates the background, significance, and implications of the 28 March promotion of Admiral Wang Renhua (王仁华) to full Admiral (three-star rank in the PLA); and the apparent elevation of CMC Politics and Law Commission he heads to Theater Command Leader grade, on the same level as the theaters and services.\n\nThis CMSI Note continues our efforts to focus on the People in China’s Military Maritime Domain.\n\nWhat do you know about the CMC’s Politics and Law Commission? What role will Admiral Wang play? What might it mean for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) specifically? Finally, what does this promotion suggest about the future of grade-and-rank promotions of other senior officers?\n\nDr. Andrew Erickson tackles these questions and so many more in this comprehensive CMSI Note that examines Wang, his career as a political officer, and his role at the Politics and Law Commission. His painstaking research efforts helps to paint a picture of this Navy officer and a CMC Commission you may know very little about.\n\nSummary\n\nA microcosm of China’s ongoing military advancement, Admiral Wang Renhua (王仁华) embodies some of the subtle, complicated efforts underway to make the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) a sophisticated fighting force that is more than the sum of its parts and whose human capital is narrowing the gap with its profusion of formidable hardware. On 28 March 2024, in a ceremony at the Central Military Commission (CMC)’s Bayi Building in Beijing, Xi Jinping concurrently promoted Wang to full admiral—three-star rank in the PLA (which, unlike the U.S. military, does not have a four-star rank)— and, apparently, Theater Command Leader grade.2 Doing so in his capacity as CMC Chairman, Xi also oversaw the implementation of one of the key new management dynamics nearly a decade into his sweeping military reforms: simultaneous promotion in grade and rank in an effort to transition from the PLA’s longstanding grade-centric system to a more Western-style rank-centric system.3 As in other professions, approaches to promoting personnel matter greatly in military performance. China heretofore employed a billet-grounded grade system, whereby not only every officer but also every organization is assigned one of fifteen grades; whereas agile, professional Western militaries have long benefitted from an individually-portable rank system. China’s transformation toward the latter approach remains a work in progress, but Wang’s trajectory is an important bellwether of things to come. More broadly, Wang’s career advancement and rise to CMC insider status as the Secretary of the CMC’s Politics and Law Commission also offers living testimony to other PLA efforts underway, particularly at increasing jointness. His varied resume includes a shift from Army to Navy officer in 2017 as well as service in the East Sea Fleet and at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.4\n\nCMSI’s Perspectives and Key Takeaways:\n\nAdmiral Wang Renhua’s promotion is the latest indication of efforts to synchronize grade-and-rank promotions at the full admiral/general level (three stars in the PLA).\n\nWang’s role may be best understood as a military loyalty enforcement boss.\n\nA key responsibility for Wang may well be to root out and destroy Xi’s enemies within the PLA.\n\nA potential component of Wang’s portfolio in the navy realm could be to maintain a tight grip on the wardrooms aboard China’s growing fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).\n\nHaving Wang serve in the Navy, and currently as head of the CMC’s powerful Politics and Law Commission, helps the PLA shift to a more joint force as part of Xi’s post-2015 reforms.\n\nWang is not originally from the Navy and does not represent the institutional interests of the PLA Navy.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a PLA Army political officer to switch uniforms to the Navy and retain them from that time forward, as Wang has done. … … …\n\n***\n\nConor M. Kennedy, “Deck Cargo Ships: Another Option for a Cross-Strait Invasion,” CMSI Note 4 (Newport, RI: Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute, 8 February 2024).\n\nFrom CMSI Director Christopher Sharman:\n\nDeck cargo ships. It’s possible you know little about them. Virtually absent from discussions about cross-Strait contingencies is any reference to how deck cargo ships might support a Cross-Strait Invasion or another Island Landing Campaign.\n\nWhile images of the PLA’s employment of traditional roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) ferries frequently appear in PRC media, you don’t hear much about this other type of RO-RO vessel. Deck cargo ships are numerous, easy to build, and readily available along China’s coast. Moreover, they can be rapidly constructed at multiple Chinese shipyards. The PLA’s integration of deck cargo ships into PLA’s calculus for a cross-Strait contingency has several operational and tactical implications.\n\nCMSI’s own Conor Kennedy authored this important CMSI note. It is another groundbreaking piece that will influence discussions about PLA amphibious lift capabilities for years to come. I highly recommend you read this CMSI Note, which flags several critical operational and tactical considerations.\n\n“CMSI Notes” are a relatively new product line from the team at CMSI. “CMSI Notes” are short quick turn analysis of potential high-interest China & Taiwan events or topics that have critical maritime policy, DoD, and U.S. Navy significance.

The views expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily represent the views, policies, or positions of the U.S. Department of Defense or its components, to include the Department of the Navy or the U.S. Naval War College.\n\nSummary\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has in recent years increased its use of civilian shipping to augment its sea lift capacity. The incorporation of commercial roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) ferries into the amphibious lift equation, has likely altered assumptions on the PLA’s total amphibious lift.2 The PLA intends to use RO-RO vessels to deliver PLA amphibious and non-amphibious wheeled and tracked vehicles into target port facilities or across landing area beaches, further enabled by lighterage and floating causeway systems.3 Ensuring an accurate assessment of all components of lift is vital to determining the PLA’s ability to launch and succeed in a cross-strait invasion. The inclusion of the major RO-RO ferries in these assessments has been key to assessing lift. However, the PLA also employs another important, but largely ignored type of RO-RO vessel, the deck cargo ship.4\n\nCMSI Perspectives and Key Take-Aways:\n\nIn addition to RO-RO ferries, the PLA also uses another class of RO-RO ship, the deck cargo ship, in sea transport training exercises.\n\nDeck cargo ships are widely used in China’s ocean engineering and construction industry, constituting an existing and large-scale volume of lift capacity.\n\nThe simple design and relative ease of construction of deck cargo ships means they can quickly be built in large numbers.\n\nThese vessels may be tasked to bring in large columns of logistics and follow-on forces to consolidate landing areas, possibly in waves not far behind landing assault forces.\n\nDeck cargo ships can distribute the risk for many units making transits and force an adversary to find suitable kill solutions to strike numerous lower value targets.\n\n***\n\nJulia M.

Lai has also stated his support for the implementation of an Indo-Pacific Strategy concept.\n\nLai has an opportunity to leverage the national security experience of President Tsai’s outgoing advisors, who may potentially help his administration calibrate Taiwan’s responses to People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military provocations in and around the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe Lai administration likely would prove receptive to U.S. and partner overtures that contribute to Taiwan’s ability to strengthen its maritime domain awareness and security; enhance maritime law enforcement and search and rescue capabilities; conduct maritime patrols; and improve information sharing.\n\nLai intends to maintain the cross-Strait status quo, and has stated that he is willing to conduct dialogue with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the basis of mutual respect and equality.\n\nLai almost certainly will seek to continue President Tsai Ing-wen’s policy of diversifying Taiwan’s economy and expanding sustainable trade partnerships with democratic nations. He has stated that overdependence on the PRC leaves Taiwan vulnerable to economic coercion, and thus opposes pursuing further economic agreements with China under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) or a potential Cross-Strait Trade in Services Agreement (CSTSA).\n\nContext\n\nTaiwan’s national elections took place on January 13, 2024. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, Dr. William LAI Ching-te (賴清德), and his running mate, Ms. HSIAO Bi-khim (蕭美琴), will serve as the next President and Vice President of Taiwan. Their ticket won 40.05% of the vote. The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) candidate HOU Yu-ih (侯友宜, also rendered Hou You-Yi) came in second with 33.49%, and Taiwan People’s Party candidate KO Wen-je (柯文哲) came in third with 24.46%.2\n\nWilliam Lai is the current Vice President (VP). He previously served as a Tainan legislator (1999-2010), Tainan mayor (2010-2017), and as Premier (2017-2019) prior to successfully running as President Tsai’s VP in 2020.3 4 Bi-khim Hsiao most recently served as Taiwan’s diplomatic representative in Washington (2020-2023), where she possessed a strong working relationship with both the Trump and Biden\n\np. 2\n\nadministrations as well as with members of Congress.5 Previously, as a Taiwan legislator (2002-2008; 2012-2020), she served on the influential Foreign Affairs and National Defense (FAND) Committee.6 7 During this time, Hsiao also held various leadership positions in the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, Liberal International, and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.8 9 She is from the progressive wing of the DPP and a close ally of President Tsai.10\n\nDuring the election campaign, the DDP exhorted voters to “choose the right person, choose the right path.” Now that Dr. Lai, Ms. Hsiao, and other senior officials will collectively shape Taiwan’s cross-Strait, national security, and defense policies, what do they believe the “right path” looks like?\n\nCross-Strait Policy\n\nAccording to a December 2023 survey, more than 60% of Taiwanese are moderately to extremely concerned that the PRC may attempt to invade Taiwan.11 It is thus unsurprising that defending Taiwan’s sovereign status has remained a cornerstone of President Tsai Ing-wen’s presidency, and such a policy would continue under a William Lai administration.12 13 DPP leaders consistently argue that there is no need to declare independence, as the Republic of China (ROC) is already a sovereign country and the PRC and Taiwan are not subordinate to one another.14 15 16 Lai states that his priority is to maintain the status quo by means of a “pragmatic and consistent” cross-Strait policy.17 18 He is willing to hold dialogue with China on the basis of mutual respect and equality, but criticizes the PRC for curtailing exchanges based on the DPP’s refusal to accept the so-called “1992 Consensus.”19 20 21 22 23 The supposed “Consensus” refers to a “political strategy” devised following the conclusion of 1992 meetings between representatives from PRC and ROC semiofficial government organizations, which enabled the KMT and CCP “to shelve their differing positions concerning which government is the legitimate, exclusive representative of ‘China,’” and subsequently allowed them to proceed to negotiations on practical cross-Strait agreements.24\n\nPRC authorities have repeatedly linked the so-called “Consensus” to their own “One China” Principle, which maintains that “there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,” and the PRC “is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.” 25 26 Conversely, the KMT asserts that the “Consensus” is intentionally ambiguous, enabling each side to interpret whether “One China” constitutes the ROC or PRC. 27 The DPP argues that as China has “never acknowledged the existence of the ROC,” accepting the “1992 Consensus” implies that Taiwan is part of China.28 29\n\nAccording to Lai, pursuing a peace agreement with authoritarian China—as previously advocated by a number of prominent pan-blue politicians—is thus futile, as the fates of Tibet and Hong Kong demonstrate that “peace without sovereignty is not genuine peace.”30 31 Former DPP Premier and party heavyweight Su Tseng-chang also underscored this point during election rallies by calling attention to ongoing PRC human rights abuses against the Uyghurs and Hong Kongers.32\n\nWilliam Lai almost certainly would maintain President Tsai’s policy of diversifying Taiwan’s economy and expanding sustainable trade partnerships with democratic nations, and states that dependency on China has “created vulnerabilities” that the CCP can exploit “through economic coercion.”33 34 35 36 For this reason, Lai remains opposed to pursuing further economic agreements with China under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) or Cross-Strait Trade in Services Agreement (CSTSA). He also supports Taiwan joining the Western-led Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans- Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). 37 38 39 40\n\np. 3\n\nNational Security and Defense Policy\n\nAlthough Lai—unlike Hsiao—did not serve on the Foreign Affairs and National Defense (FAND) Committee, as the DPP Caucus Whip he supported strongly U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and famously excoriated KMT legislators for repeatedly blocking the special budget for arms procurement in 2005.41 42 43 He almost certainly intends for his administration to execute and deepen President Tsai’s defense reforms. 44 45 46 47 48 He has pledged to “expedite” Taiwan’s “transition into an asymmetric fighting force, focusing on cost-effective and mobile capabilities.”49 He also stated that he would “seek greater cooperation with partners and allies, particularly in training, force restructuring, civil defense, and information sharing.”50 Moreover, Lai has specifically stated that he seeks comprehensive security cooperation with Japan.51\n\nVice President Lai has expressed his support for the Indo-Pacific Strategy concept. He stresses the importance of ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight; strengthening maritime domain awareness and security; enhancing maritime law enforcement and search and rescue capabilities; enhancing Taiwan’s ability to conduct maritime patrols, including with international partners; and “establishing consultation mechanisms to jointly maintain maritime security.”52 53\n\nLai has argued that under his leadership, the potential for a cross-Strait conflict would decrease due to his focus on strengthening Taiwan’s national security and defense capabilities.54 55 It is possible that Bi-khim Hsiao may play an important role in helping to shape the future trajectory of Taiwan’s national security, defense, and foreign policies.\n\nImplications\n\nThroughout the election campaign, Lai and Hsiao made it clear that they would continue to lean toward and seek deeper cooperation with key democratic partners as they safeguard Taiwan’s robust democratic society and freedoms. Their administration’s policies will inevitably influence the trajectory of Taiwan’s security landscape by shaping Taiwan’s deterrence posture, national defense readiness, and ultimately its ability to counter an increasingly aggressive PRC all-domain pressure campaign.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Dr. Famularo is a Visiting Scholar at CMSI and a Postdoctoral Fellow in Taiwan Studies at the Harvard University Fairbank Center.

Their administration’s policies will inevitably influence the trajectory of Taiwan’s security landscape by shaping Taiwan’s deterrence posture, national defense readiness, and ultimately, its ability to counter an increasingly aggressive PRC all-domain pressure campaign.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from my recent article for the U.S. Naval War College’s China Maritime Studies Initiative, “Choose the Right Person, Choose the Right Path”: Taiwan’s Cross-Strait, National Security, and Defense Policies Under a Lai/Hsiao Administration:\n\nThe incoming William Lai/Bi-khim Hsiao administration almost certainly intends to continue to execute and deepen President Tsai’s defense reforms. Lai has also stated his support for the implementation of an Indo-Pacific Strategy concept.\n\nLai has an opportunity to leverage the national security experience of President Tsai’s outgoing advisors, who may potentially help his administration calibrate Taiwan’s responses to People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military provocations in and around the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe Lai administration likely would prove receptive to U.S. and partner overtures that contribute to Taiwan’s ability to strengthen its maritime domain awareness and security; enhance maritime law enforcement and search and rescue capabilities; conduct maritime patrols; and improve information sharing.\n\nLai intends to maintain the cross-Strait status quo, and has stated that he is willing to conduct dialogue with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the basis of mutual respect and equality.\n\nLai almost certainly will seek to continue President Tsai Ing-wen’s policy of diversifying Taiwan’s economy and expanding sustainable trade partnerships with democratic nations. He has stated that overdependence on the PRC leaves Taiwan vulnerable to economic coercion, and thus opposes pursuing further economic agreements with China under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) or a potential Cross-Strait Trade in Services Agreement (CSTSA).\n\n***\n\nAndrew S. Erickson and Christopher H. Sharman, “Admiral Dong Jun Engages Friends and Foes: China’s First Naval Defense Minister Brings Joint Operational Experience,” CMSI Note 2 (Newport, RI: Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute, 30 December 2023).\n\nFrom CMSI Director Christopher Sharman:\n\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has a new leader – and he is a Navy guy!\n\nOn 29 December, Admiral Dong Jun was appointed China’s 14th Minister of National Defense. Admiral Dong Jun’s impressive career as a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) officer will certainly influence how he executes his new role.\n\nThis analysis focuses on Dong’s formative experiences as a naval officer, and their potential implications within the maritime domain; with particular emphasis on Dong’s liaison role – representing the PLA, and ultimately the Central Military Commission (CMC), in interactions with foreign militaries.\n\nDong’s unprecedented background as the PLAN Commander reflects serious joint and naval focus under Xi with growing potential applications to disputed sovereignty claims in the East and South China Seas—none more important than Taiwan.\n\nBut what do you know about Admiral Dong’s Navy career? What assignments have shaped his thinking? What joint experiences does he have that enable him to assume this influential position?\n\nThe China Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI) is pleased to bring you CMSI Note #2, “Admiral Dong Jun Engages Friends and Foes: China’s First Naval Defense Minister Brings Joint Operational Experience.” We are publishing this note just one day after the announcement of Admiral Dong’s appointment to serve as the PLA Minister of National Defense.\n\nThis CMSI Note, along with our first note published on 27 December titled, “Admiral Hu to the Helm,” will be posted shortly on the CMSI webpage. Considering this is a holiday weekend (and unlikely to be posted until next week), we encourage you to circulate this note to your distribution lists to ensure the right folks have eyes on to support the inevitable questions about Admiral Dong that will come early next week.\n\nMy profuse thanks to Dr. Andrew Erickson and the whole CMSI team who helped pull our second CMSI Note together so quickly. Andrew’s decades of experience and laser focus on China’s Navy enabled our team to get this note to your in-boxes within ~24 hours of the public announcement of Admiral Dong’s appointment.\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\nChristopher H. Sharman\n\nDirector"
