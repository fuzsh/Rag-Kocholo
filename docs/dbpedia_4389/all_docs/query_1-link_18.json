        "text": "On June 8th, the \"Dream Chemical Engineering, Nurturing Dreams Plan\" expert symposium was held in the fifth-floor lecture hall of Hongyi Building. The symposium invited Professor Zhu Shiping, Vice President of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), to give a special lecture on \"The New Era of Polymer Reaction Engineering: High-End Polymer Product Development\" to the faculty and students of our school. Vice President Xing Weihong attended the symposium, which was presided over by Ju Yonggan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the School of Chemical Engineering.\n\nDuring the presentation, Professor Zhu Shiping humorously and comprehensibly introduced his profound understanding of polymer reaction engineering and the research conducted by his team in this field. He started by presenting an overview of the field of chemical engineering from a broad perspective, revealing the essence of chemical engineering through \"one sentence,\" \"one page,\" and a \"chemical engineering song.\" Using the research work of his team as an example, he discussed the application of polymer reaction engineering in the production of polymer materials. He proposed the concept of \"precision production of polymers\" and provided an academic feast in a relaxed atmosphere. Professor Zhu's presentation was rich and captivating, receiving enthusiastic responses from the faculty and students present, who actively posed questions. Professor Zhu addressed each question meticulously and offered insightful advice and suggestions related to the students' research topics and directions.\n\nPrior to the symposium, President Qiao Xu had a cordial meeting with Professor Zhu Shiping, and the two sides engaged in in-depth discussions on the construction and development of the chemical engineering discipline, talent cultivation, and other aspects.\n\nLeaders from the School of Chemical Engineering, faculty representatives, and all undergraduate and graduate students attended the symposium through a combination of online and offline methods.\n\nAuthor: Tang Weizhi (School of Chemical Engineering); Review: Ju Yonggan, Ji Qingchun\n\nAppendix: Professor Zhu Shiping's Brief Introduction\n\nProfessor Zhu Shiping, Vice President of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), graduated from Zhejiang University with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1982. He obtained his Ph.D. from McMaster University in 1991. Starting in 1994, he served as a faculty member in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at McMaster University. From 2009 to 2014, he served as the head of the Department of Chemical Engineering. In 2015, he was honored with the title of \"Distinguished University Professor.\" In 2017, he joined The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) as a Chair Professor and Vice President. His research areas include polymer reaction engineering, metallocene-catalyzed olefin polymerization, controlled free radical polymerization, polymer process modeling, and intelligent polymer materials. He has supervised over 140 graduate students, published more than 400 papers, cited over 18,000 times, and has an H-index of 78. In 2010, he was elected as a fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, and in 2014, he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2020, he was elected as a fellow of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World. In 2016, he received the R.S. Jane Memorial Award, the highest award from the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering. In 2019, he published the \"Chemical Engineering Song.\""
