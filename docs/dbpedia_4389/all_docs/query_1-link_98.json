        "text": "The World’s Wealthiest Cities Report is the definitive guide to the world’s wealthiest and most expensive cities, published annually by Henley & Partners — the global leader in residence and citizenship by investment — in partnership with wealth intelligence firm New World Wealth.\n\nWealth data\n\nNew World Wealth is currently the only known independent wealth research firm systematically tracking global wealth migration trends between countries and cities. The firm tracks the movements of over 150,000 high-net-worth individuals in its in-house database, with a special focus on those with over USD 30 million in listed company holdings. The database’s primary focus is on company founders (50%+ of the database) and individuals from high-value companies who hold the following positions: chairperson, CEO, president, director, and managing partner.\n\nNew World Wealth relies primarily on this database when assessing the city wealth breakdowns featured in this report. The firm uses various public sources to check city locations, including LinkedIn and other business portals. The data also takes into account prime property statistics — specifically, it considers the number of highly priced homes in each city.\n\nNote: It should be noted that New World Wealth never gives out the names of the individuals in its database, which it uses purely for in-house statistical studies.\n\nCity definitions\n\nWe take into account the normal city limits of all the cities mentioned in this report, with the exception of those listed below.\n\nThe Bay Area includes the city of San Francisco and Silicon Valley.\n\nLos Angeles includes the city of Los Angeles as well as Beverly Hills, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, and Malibu.\n\nMiami includes Miami (city) and Miami Beach (island).\n\nNice to Èze includes Nice and Èze as well as Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, and Villefranche-sur-Mer.\n\nAthens includes the city of Athens as well as surrounding beachfront areas such as Glyfada and Piraeus.\n\nZurich refers to the Canton of Zurich.\n\nGeneva refers to the Canton of Geneva.\n\nNotes and wealth definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this report, ‘wealth’ refers to an individual’s liquid investable wealth, which only includes listed company holdings, cash holdings, and debt-free residential property holdings.\n\nThe terms ‘millionaires’ or ‘high-net-worth individuals’ (HNWIs) refer to individuals with liquid investable wealth of USD 1 million or more.\n\nThe term ‘centi-millionaires’ refers to individuals with liquid investable wealth of USD 100 million or more.\n\nThe term ‘billionaires’ refers to individuals with liquid investable wealth of USD 1 billion or more.\n\n‘Millionaire growth’ refers to the rise or drop in the number of millionaires living in a country or city over a certain period, in percentage terms.\n\n‘Wealth per capita’ refers to the average wealth of a person in a specific country or city.
