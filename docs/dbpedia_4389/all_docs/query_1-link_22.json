A ‚Äú1+1+1‚Äù joint funding programme will see the three parties jointly invest nearly HK$90 million over the three-year period from 2024 to 2026. This is the first time that Guangdong Province and the universities with campuses in both Guangdong and Hong Kong have jointly invested in research collaboration. This cooperation is a #milestone , as CUHK and CUHK-Shenzhen, the two earliest and strongest ‚Äúone university, two campuses‚Äù institutions in the Greater Bay Area, join hands to contribute to the innovation and technological development of the region.

This study uses Fairclough‚Äôs three-dimensional discourse analysis theory to conduct text analysis, discursive practice analysis, and social practice analysis of the business school undergraduate admissions prospectuses at HKU, CUHK, HKUST, HKSYU, and HSUHK in Hong Kong, exploring the influence of promotional culture on discourse practice of higher education. #Commercialization\n\nRecently, a former student said to me that some Western universities do not understand the system of 'University within a University' at some top universities in China. This creates disparity for Chinese international students in the West. Some students from tier-3 level colleges were admitted into the top universities in the West because their degrees carry the name of a top university but have limited relation with the university at all. At the same time, this also means that these Western universities thought they enrolled the students from the top universities but they did not. This prompted me to think about writing this blog to introduce the well-quoted '985 Project', '211 Project' and ' Double first-class initiative' of Chinese universities. I hope it helps some colleagues in the admissions team and partnership development of the UK and other Western universities, but also useful for colleagues who are into rankings.

Prof. Shi acknowledged the existing limitations and obstacles in university collaborations but remained hopeful, advocating for constructive dialogues driven by thoughtful leaders and globalization. In navigating the complexities of the modern world, Prof. Shi envisioned a future where nations would cooperate to overcome obstacles, recognizing the interconnected nature of global issues. He believed that universities, the hub for delivering universal knowledge, could collectively contribute to finding solutions by fostering an environment conducive to constructive conversations.
