The HKSAR Government has always supported universities to run schools in GBA cities to turn the region into an education hub attractive to talents.\n\n“Since its operation in 2014, CUHK-Shenzhen has made outstanding achievements in teaching and scientific research, and has made encouraging progress in all its work,” Lam was quoted saying.\n\nLam has also highly praised the university’s achievements in various aspects. The establishment of the School of Medicine is not only an important milestone in CUHK-Shenzhen’s development, but also the overall deployment of the GBA national strategy, said Lam, adding that its “future development is anticipated.”\n\nIt is symbolically significant to promote the medical and health care industry development in the GBA, continuously deepen new cooperation modes between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the medical and education fields, and improve the level of professional services, according to Lam.\n\nXu Yangsheng, president of CUHK-Shenzhen, expressed in his speech his hopes that the freshmen should cultivate independent thinking habits and learn to communicate with others.\n\nIt is reported that the newly enrolled undergraduates, postgraduates and doctoral students at the university will start courses today."
