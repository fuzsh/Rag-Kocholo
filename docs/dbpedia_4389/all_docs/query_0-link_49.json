        "text": "This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. To mark the occasion, we are publishing a series of reports celebrating the cityâs achievements in different aspects over the past four decades.\n\nShenzhen has established 15 universities and colleges over the past 40 years, with 113,200 full-time students currently studying on campus, according to Shenzhen Special Zone Daily.\n\nStrategies have been implemented to speed up the development of higher education in the city after authorities studied economic and social development demands.\n\nIn recent years, Shenzhen took development opportunities to gather high-quality education resources at home and abroad by introducing foreign universities to cooperate with local universities.\n\nThe city built its first university â Shenzhen University (SZU) â in 1983 when the special economic zone had been created just three years previously.\n\nIt took only eight months for SZU to enroll the first batch of 216 students. SZU, since its establishment, has always explored innovative mechanisms to cultivate talented students.\n\nApproved by the Ministry of Education, the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) was built in 2012.\n\nSUSTech was the first university in the country to adopt a comprehensive enrollment policy specifying that the final grade of the applicant is calculated as 60 percent of their college entrance examinations (or gaokao) grade, 30 percent of the aptitude test grade, and 10 percent of the high school academic proficiency test grade.\n\nShenzhen MSU-BIT University, the first China-Russia cooperative university, welcomed the first batch of students in 2017.\n\nShenzhen MSU-BIT University is a nonprofit higher educational institution, an independent legal entity, jointly established by the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Lomonosov Moscow State University and Beijing Institute of Technology.\n\nThe main building of Shenzhen MSU-BIT University.

Majors set up at universities and colleges have basically covered major emerging industries and key supported sectors in the city, the Daily said.\n\nThe cityâs universities and colleges have also become an important platform for attracting and nurturing high-end talents. At present, there are more than 30 academics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering working full time in the city, along with over 500 national high-level talented employees from different fields.\n\nThe city set goals for the development of its higher education in 2016, including a .\n\nAccording to its 10-year development plan, the city will have around 20 universities by 2025 with nearly 200,000 students."
