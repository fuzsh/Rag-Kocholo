        "text": "Our current program structure was established in 2018. For grants made between 2006-2018, where there was not a direct mapping from one of the previous program areas to the current structure, the “Other Grantmaking” label was applied. View the “topics” associated with these grants to better understand them.\n\nFor more recent grants, this label indicates that the grant’s funding source was outside of a program’s budget. Some examples include our philanthropy and Good Neighbor Committee grants."
