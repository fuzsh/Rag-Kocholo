        "text": "If you ever wondered why the progress in cancer research is so slow despite billions being invested into basic research – Sholto David will show you why.\n\nForget Asian papermills. Forget Sicilian universities. They are just emulating what the most prestigious US research institutions teach. And you can’t get any more prestigious than Harvard and its Dana Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nWell, the level of data forgery is pathetically amateurish and excessive. So much that we could only include a fraction of it into this article, you will have to search Ken Anderson, Bill Hahn and other protagonists on PubPeer to see how bad it all really is. In fact, it is worse, because we only see the tiny tip of the fraud iceberg – image data duplications, the last resort of a failed scientist after every other trick failed to provide the desired result. Billions of dollars were burned for this cancerous trash science, but it made many academic careers, some got very rich, and entire dynasties established themselves at Dana Farber.\n\nNone of Dana Farber researchers mentioned in this article replied when asked to comment on their PubPeer records.\n\nDana-Farberications at Harvard University\n\nBy Sholto David\n\nAs the whole world furiously argues over whether the president of Harvard did or didn’t use some quotation marks in the right place, scientists at the affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) must breathe a sigh of relief, no one has bothered to critically read their research in years! Far worse skeletons than plagiarism lurk in the archives…\n\nLaurie H. Glimcher\n\nStarting with Laurie H. Glimcher, who is the President and CEO of the DFCI. No doubt Laurie built her career on papers like this one, in Nature Immunology (2003), which includes some impressive contributions to art, but perhaps not to science.\n\nNeal N. Iwakoshi, Ann-Hwee Lee, Prasanth Vallabhajosyula, Kevin L. Otipoby, Klaus Rajewsky, Laurie H. Glimcher Plasma cell differentiation and the unfolded protein response intersect at the transcription factor XBP-1 Nature Immunology (2003) doi: 10.1038/ni907\n\nMaybe the coauthor Klaus Rajewsky could issue a correction blaming the updated western blot hardware this time (as opposed to “updated FlowJo software“).\n\nLaurie has a curious attitude to correcting her work, although she has replied to one of my less critical comments, she neglected to respond to the above issue (despite prompting); and for the following duplicated flow cytometry plots, she provided this dismissive response:\n\nWell Laurie, it’s your paper, if you care about it being correct, you could very well reach out yourself!\n\nBoaz Tirosh, Neal N. Iwakoshi, Laurie H. Glimcher, Hidde L. Ploegh XBP-1 specifically promotes IgM synthesis and secretion, but is dispensable for degradation of glycoproteins in primary B cells The Journal of Experimental Medicine (2005) doi: 10.1084/jem.20050575\n\nLaurie co-authored several papers with Claudio Hetz. This “star neuroscientist” was investigated by his university, which released a damning report, accusing Hetz of recklessness, negligence, and a problematic attitude to research ethics. Hetz simply expressed regret that he didn’t have access to a better version of Photoshop to more convincingly manipulate his images.\n\nIn February 2020 Laurie claimed on PubPeer that she had not been made aware of what happened with Hetz’s papers (perhaps she should subscribe to For Better Science email alerts!). In any case this discovery did not prompt her into action, by 2023, only one of the four papers tagged on PubPeer with her and Hetz as co-authors has received a reply from her, and none have been corrected or retracted. For example, this undergraduate level error of miscounted western blot lanes remains in the scientific record, without comment or correction, in the prestigious journal Science, no less:\n\nClaudio Hetz, Paula Bernasconi, Jill Fisher, Ann-Hwee Lee, Michael C. Bassik , Bruno Antonsson, Gabriel S. Brandt, Neal N. Iwakoshi, Anna Schinzel, Laurie H. Glimcher, Stanley J. Korsmeyer Proapoptotic BAX and BAK modulate the unfolded protein response by a direct interaction with IRE1alpha Science (2006) doi: 10.1126/science.1123480\n\nThe above paper has generated a lengthy PubPeer thread, discussing multiple splices in the supplementary figures.\n\nWilliam C. Hahn (Bill)\n\nThe very next entry on the DFCI leadership page is Laurie’s deputy, William C. Hahn who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. While Laurie has a few troubling papers and a lamentable attitude to rectifying these errors, Bill has a far more impressive PubPeer record, including 30 search results, with eighteen pertaining to problematic images. Bill is the former postdoc of Robert Weinberg, owner of an impressive PubPeer record too.\n\nBill contributed this calamitous effort to the journal Cancer Research in 2005.\n\nWen Chen, Jason D. Arroyo, Jamie C. Timmons, Richard Possemato, William C. Hahn Cancer-Associated PP2A Aα Subunits Induce Functional Haploinsufficiency and Tumorigenicity Cancer Research (2005) doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-05-1103\n\nI would encourage anyone interested to look carefully at the blots, the edges very clearly show that these are not merely bands with similar shapes, but the same bands copied and pasted.\n\nThe stench of the sacked MIT professor David M. Sabatini is never far from these discussions. Bill co-authored a 2006 paper in Cell with Sabatini, and also with MIT’s Eric Lander, who was previously Joe Biden’s top science adviser, but resigned following reports of bullying and misogyny.\n\nJason Moffat, Dorre A.

Root A Lentiviral RNAi Library for Human and Mouse Genes Applied to an Arrayed Viral High-Content Screen Cell (2006) doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.040\n\nBill’s PhD student Richard Possemato, also an author of the previously mentioned paper, worked at MIT with Sabatini and is now professor at New York University. The bands in yellow boxes are nearly pixel-perfect identical on close inspection.\n\nWe can quickly complete the Cell, Nature, Science trifecta for this blog post with another collaboration between Bill and Sabatini published in Nature which includes duplicated flow cytometry histograms, sensibly tucked away in the supplementary data. James E. Bradner (formerly executive committee member of Novartis, and just last week announced as the new chief scientific officer of Amgen) earns another mention on For Better Science.\n\nScott R.

Yaffe The bromodomain protein Brd4 insulates chromatin from DNA damage signalling Nature (2013) doi: 10.1038/nature12147\n\nThis is not the only duplication of flow cytometry histograms published by Bill; another was previously identified by Elisabeth Bik:\n\nSheila A Stewart, Derek M Dykxhoorn, Deborah Palliser, Hana Mizuno, Evan Y Yu, Dong Sung An, David M Sabatini, Irvin S Y Chen, William C Hahn, Phillip A Sharp, Robert A Weinberg, Carl D Novina Lentivirus-delivered stable gene silencing by RNAi in primary cells RNA (2003)\n\ndoi: 10.1261/rna.2192803\n\nBill apparently collects collaborations with longevity weirdos, including this paper with another obnoxious David: the Harvard professor David A. Sinclair. Something was clumsily hidden by cloning a rectangular section from a nearby lane. What was concealed? We will likely never know, but at least one of the authors must have felt it was important enough to hide.\n\nRon Firestein, Gil Blander, Shaday Michan, Philipp Oberdoerffer, Shuji Ogino, Jennifer Campbell, Anupama Bhimavarapu, Sandra Luikenhuis, Rafael De Cabo, Charles Fuchs, William C. Hahn, Leonard P. Guarente, David A. Sinclair The SIRT1 deacetylase suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis and colon cancer growth PLoS ONE (2008) doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002020\n\nThis finding was previously mentioned on For Better Science when discussing the work of Leonard Guarente, Sinclair’s mentor:\n\nIn his quest to befriend anti-aging cheaters, Bill has also travelled to Germany, where he collaborated with the shooting star Karl Lenhard Rudolph (who later became the nation’s most famous zombie scientist).\n\nThe following paper stems from Rudolph’s time at Hannover Medical School, and it was therefore not part of the 2016 misconduct investigation by the Leibniz Association. The penultimate author is Hannover Medical School’s current president, Michael P. Manns.\n\nA Satyanarayana, R A Greenberg, S Schaetzlein, J Buer, K Masutomi, W C Hahn, S Zimmermann, U Martens, M P Manns, K L Rudolph Mitogen stimulation cooperates with telomere shortening to activate DNA damage responses and senescence signaling Molecular and Cellular Biology (2004) doi: 10.1128/mcb.24.12.5459-5474.2004\n\nBill works with lots of prestigious collaborators, Massimo Loda is the current Editor-in-Chief of Molecular Cancer Research, an AACR journal (a publisher you can find frequently in this blog post).\n\nRaanan Berger, Phillip G. Febbo, Pradip K. Majumder, Jean J. Zhao, Shayan Mukherjee, Sabina Signoretti, K. Thirza Campbell, William R. Sellers, Thomas M. Roberts, Massimo Loda, Todd R. Golub, William C. Hahn Androgen-induced differentiation and tumorigenicity of human prostate epithelial cells Cancer Research (2004) doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-04-2938\n\nWorth mentioning that Thomas M. Roberts is another DFCI researcher and Harvard professor, and so is his former postdoc Jean Zhao; they have a PubPeer record of their own, with and without Bill.\n\nHere is Bill with another DFCI colleague, James DeCaprio:\n\nAnna A. Sablina, Wen Chen, Jason D. Arroyo, Laura Corral, Melissa Hector, Sara E. Bulmer, James A. DeCaprio, William C. Hahn The tumor suppressor PP2A Abeta regulates the RalA GTPase Cell (2007) doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.047\n\nIn 2020, DeCaprio corrected a Nature Cell Biology paper Park et al 2020 because “the western blot image for VINC in Fig. 3g was a duplicate of that for LSD1.” So duplicated blots should be corrected? Plenty of work to be done in that regard!\n\nAnother impressive titan of industry, Bill published with current Head of Global Product Development and Chief Medical Officer of Roche, Levi Garraway in 2011.\n\nNikhil Wagle, Caroline Emery, Michael F. Berger, Matthew J. Davis, Allison Sawyer, Panisa Pochanard, Sarah M. Kehoe, Cory M. Johannessen, Laura E. MacConaill, William C. Hahn, Matthew Meyerson, Levi A.

Good to know that in Big Pharma research is in such safe hands.\n\nMore troubling western blots in motion at DFCI, with Bill as the penultimate author.\n\nHailing Cheng, Pixu Liu, Zhigang C Wang, Lihua Zou, Stephanie Santiago, Victoria Garbitt, Ole V Gjoerup, J Dirk Iglehart, Alexander Miron, Andrea L Richardson, William C Hahn, Jean J Zhao SIK1 couples LKB1 to p53-dependent anoikis and suppresses metastasis Science Signaling (2009)\n\ndoi: 10.1126/scisignal.2000369\n\nAnd finally for Bill, another paper in Nature, with Bob Weinberg, containing multiple splices, and a mirrored band (I also think the migration of the Large-T bands seems unusual). This paper has over 3000 citations… So probably nothing urgent here for Nature to address?\n\nWilliam C. Hahn, Christopher M. Counter, Ante S. Lundberg, Roderick L. Beijersbergen, Mary W. Brooks, Robert A. Weinberg Creation of human tumour cells with defined genetic elements Nature (1999) doi: 10.1038/22780\n\nIrene M. Ghobrial\n\nMoving on to Irene M. Ghobrial, who is the Senior Vice President for Experimental Medicine at DFCI. Irene works on multiple myeloma, frequently publishing with her DFCI colleagues Kenneth C. Anderson, Nikhil C. Munshi, Teru Hideshima, Ruben Carrasco, and Yu-Tzu Tai.\n\nWhat kind of research has elevated Irene to her current position?\n\nIn 2012 this epic fail was published, Irene gained ethical approval to aspirate bone marrow from cancer patients and healthy volunteers, but Figure 1 includes three obvious duplications.\n\nFeda Azab, Abdel Kareem Azab, Patricia Maiso, Teresa Calimeri, Ludmila Flores, Yang Liu, Phong Quang, Aldo M. Roccaro, Antonio Sacco, Hai T. Ngo, Yong Zhang, Brittany L. Morgan, Ruben D. Carrasco, Irene M. Ghobrial Eph-B2/ephrin-B2 interaction plays a major role in the adhesion and proliferation of Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia Clinical Cancer Research (2012)\n\ndoi: 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-11-0111\n\nWouldn’t the volunteers be furious after undergoing such an invasive procedure? Can the data from a paper like this ever be rehabilitated?\n\nJust like hapless Chinese papermills, Harvard scientists struggle with images of crystal violet stained cells. Perhaps this method is just cursed?\n\nPaola Neri, Li Ren, Abdel Kareem Azab, Matthew Brentnall, Kathy Gratton, Alexander C. Klimowicz, Charles Lin, Peter Duggan, Pierfrancesco Tassone, Adnan Mansoor, Douglas A. Stewart, Lawrence H. Boise, Irene M. Ghobrial, Nizar J. Bahlis Integrin β7-mediated regulation of multiple myeloma cell adhesion, migration, and invasion Blood (2011) doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-292243\n\nAnother blunder in troublesome migration and invasion experiments was published with John Crown, an Irish politician and member of the 24th Seanad at the time this paper was submitted.\n\nClaire Corcoran, Sweta Rani, Susan Breslin, Martina Gogarty, Irene M Ghobrial, John Crown, Lorraine O’Driscoll miR-630 targets IGF1R to regulate response to HER-targeting drugs and overall cancer cell progression in HER2 over-expressing breast cancer Molecular Cancer (2014)\n\ndoi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-71\n\nLike her colleagues mentioned above, Irene also has trouble with counting, how many Harvard researchers does it take to count to seven I wonder?\n\nAs with Bill, there are plenty of western blot duplications to enjoy, too.\n\nAbdel Kareem Azab, Feda Azab, Simona Blotta, Costas M. Pitsillides, Brian Thompson, Judith M. Runnels, Aldo M. Roccaro, Hai T. Ngo, Molly R. Melhem, Antonio Sacco, Xiaoying Jia, Kenneth C. Anderson, Charles P. Lin, Barrett J. Rollins, Irene M. Ghobrial RhoA and Rac1 GTPases play major and differential roles in stromal cell-derived factor-1-induced cell adhesion and chemotaxis in multiple myeloma Blood (2009) doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-199281\n\nRuben Carrasco is another DFCI scientist and frequent collaborator of Irene’s. He is listed as a former postdoc of Ronald DePinho (who caused a financial catastrophe as President of MD Anderson in Texas). Read more on Ron here:\n\nPerhaps one can only learn bad science from DePinho, who was the postdoctoral adviser for Ned Sharpless, subject of my last blog post.\n\nWho could be to blame for this supplemental silliness? The splice, which the authors did not try to hide, is hard to justify in the first place, never mind that loading controls were simply borrowed from the above blot.\n\nMichal Bar‐Natan, Dina Stroopinsky, Katarina Luptakova, Maxwell D. Coll, Arie Apel, Hasan Rajabi, Athalia R. Pyzer, Kristen Palmer, Michaela R. Reagan, Myrna R. Nahas, Rebecca Karp Leaf, Salvia Jain, Jon Arnason, Irene M. Ghobrial, Kenneth C.

In the figure below, a group of mice has made a knight move across the page, and transitioned between groups. Thinking about what Irene’s team may have wished to demonstrate (lack of cancer spread in their favoured group) this appears to be a very convenient error.\n\nYu Zhang, Michele Moschetta, Daisy Huynh, Yu-Tzu Tai, Yong Zhang, Wenjing Zhang, Yuji Mishima, Jennifer E. Ring, Winnie F. Tam, Qunli Xu, Patricia Maiso, Michaela Reagan, Ilyas Sahin, Antonio Sacco, Salomon Manier, Yosra Aljawai, Siobhan Glavey, Nikhil C. Munshi, Kenneth C. Anderson, Jonathan Pachter, Aldo M. Roccaro, Irene M. Ghobrial Pyk2 promotes tumor progression in multiple myeloma Blood (2014) doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-563981\n\nAnother problematic murine figure is shown below. This appears to be nearly entirely fabricated by taking repeated scans of a few mice and labelling them as showing a range of different timepoints and treatment conditions. Look carefully at the positions of the tail, feet, fur, and elements of noise around the mice.\n\nKenneth C. Anderson (Ken)\n\nAs mentioned previously, Irene frequently publishes with Kenneth C. Anderson (you may have noticed above). Ken is also a senior DFCI researcher. Perhaps we can imagine them as Ken and Barbie?\n\nQuite apart from his collaborations with Irene, Ken has an extensive record of problematic papers without Irene. These have been tagged on PubPeer over the last ten years. Perhaps Ken has rotten luck in choosing his collaborators? Here Ken teamed up with the previously mentioned Ron DePinho and Ruben Carrasco for an artistic interpretation of western blotting his CEO Laurie might be impressed by.\n\nDaniel R.

DePinho The differentiation and stress response factor XBP-1 drives multiple myeloma pathogenesis Cancer Cell (2007) doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2007.02.015\n\nHow about this muddle in Nature Medicine, also with Ruben Carrasco:\n\nDi Zhu, Zhongqiu Wang, Jian-Jun Zhao, Teresa Calimeri, Jiang Meng, Teru Hideshima, Mariateresa Fulciniti, Yue Kang, Scott B Ficarro, Yu-Tzu Tai, Zachary Hunter, Douglas McMilin, Haoxuan Tong, Constantine S Mitsiades, Catherine J Wu, Steven P Treon, David M Dorfman, Geraldine Pinkus, Nikhil C Munshi, Pierfrancesco Tassone, Jarrod A Marto, Kenneth C Anderson, Ruben D Carrasco The Cyclophilin A-CD147 complex promotes the proliferation and homing of multiple myeloma cells Nature Medicine (2015) doi: 10.1038/nm.3867\n\nA final mix-up with Ruben Carrasco, who is associate professor in Harvard with his own lab at DFCI.\n\nMasahisa Jinushi, Matthew Vanneman, Nikhil C.

Ken teamed up with Harvard’s and For Better Science celebrity Carl Ronald Kahn.\n\nYu-Tzu Tai, Klaus Podar, Laurence Catley, Yu-Hua Tseng, Masaharu Akiyama, Reshma Shringarpure, Renate Burger, Teru Hideshima, Dharminder Chauhan, Nicholas Mitsiades, Paul Richardson, Nikhil C Munshi, C Ronald Kahn, Constantine Mitsiades, Kenneth C Anderson Insulin-like growth factor-1 induces adhesion and migration in human multiple myeloma cells via activation of beta1-integrin and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/AKT signaling Cancer Research (2003) pubmed: 14522909\n\nJames E. Bradner earns another mention for his collaboration here with Ken. Perhaps it’s time for someone to look carefully at his work? He certainly seems to be caught in the crossfire rather a lot. Also put together with the help of DFCIs star oncologist Paul G. Richardson, described in 2022 as “a giant of cancer care in myeloma“.\n\nTeru Hideshima, Jun Qi, Ronald M.

Anderson Identification of genes regulated by 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) in multiple myeloma cells using oligonucleotide arrays Blood (2003)\n\ndoi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3146\n\nConstantine Mitsiades is now associate professor at DFCI, he and his brother have more on PubPeer. They also used to be collaborators of Germany’s untouchable top ophtalmologist Antonia Joussen (see the fabrications in Poulaki et al 2002 and Poulaki et al 2004).\n\nThe following study was likely conducted in Japan, where DFCI’s Teru Hideshima obviously has contacts, but somehow his postdoctoral advisor Ken has wrangled himself the senior authorship spot. What was his contribution here I wonder?\n\nMasaharu Akiyama, Osamu Yamada, Teru Hideshima, Takaaki Yanagisawa, Kentaro Yokoi, Kohji Fujisawa, Yoshikatsu Eto, Hisashi Yamada, Kenneth C Anderson TNFalpha induces rapid activation and nuclear translocation of telomerase in human lymphocytes Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications (2004) doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.02.080\n\nSome of Ken’s associates seem curiously dependent on him for their own research career; DFCI program director and Harvard professor Nikhil C. Munshi is a good example (there are others) who appears to have almost no independent activity.\n\nAround 2010 Ken retracted three papers in quick succession (Okawa et al 2008, Tai et al 2009, Gatt et al 2010), apparently because the cell lines were mixed up, and to be fair, it does seem like mixing things up is rather in Ken’s wheelhouse, but it does leave one wondering… Was an investigation into the affair ever held? Or were the retractions prompted by secret investigation? How much research funding can you waste on these blunders at DFCI without any consequences or any public comment?\n\nIn conclusion: a swathe of research coming out of DFCI authored by the most senior researchers and managers appears to be hopelessly corrupt with errors that are obvious from just a cursory reading the papers.\n\nImagine what mistakes might be found in the raw data if anyone was allowed to look!\n\nAs it happened to the Dean of Harvard Medical School, George Q Daley:\n\nAs time marches on, methods have become more “genomical”, and in a lot of ways, harder to scrutinize. I had a go at replicating some of the gene expression analysis in Irene’s papers (for example, see here), and it doesn’t look hopeful, but it isn’t worth anyone’s time to write such comments if obvious errors in images are going to be left unmolested for years at a time.\n\nIn 2017, DFCI’s own future Nobel Prize winner William G. Kaelin Jr wrote an opinion piece in Nature, lamenting the proliferation of papers focusing on “impact” rather than robustness, burying weak data in supplements, cherry picking, and other poor practices, he didn’t mention fraud, although there are still some interesting quotes.\n\nWhat exactly is the building material of choice at DFCI?\n\nCredit should go to the anonymous and named commenters on PubPeer, Bill and Ken’s papers have been annotated over the last ten years, I presume frequently by Clare Francis. Some of the more recent comment’s especially on Irene’s papers were left by me, sometimes with the help of ImageTwin.ai. Other known contributors include Cheshire, and Elisabeth Bik. Written with some help from Leonid."
