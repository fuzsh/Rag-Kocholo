Military analysts also point out Russia has the capability of responding to the F-16 deployment, and this military aid is very likely to further escalate the Russia-Ukraine conflict, dampening already dim hopes of peace talks.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/8/6 0:06:15\n\nTeam China makes Olympic history in Paris with confidence\n\nWith 16 golds, 12 silvers and 9 bronzes, China was sitting on top of the Olympic medal table as of Sunday, followed by the US and host country France, with many being claimed by Gen Z athletes in fields outside China's traditional strengths.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Wu Jie | 2024/8/5 0:03:54\n\nNetanyahu's US trip a 'bet on both sides'\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the US is an attempt to show his supporters that Washington is still with him, and he is using this chance to \"bet on both sides\" as he is scheduled to meet with US President Joe Biden and likely Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris as well as former president Donald Trump, so that he can ensure that whoever eventually wins the election, the US will still back Israel despite its operation in Gaza already killing nearly 40,000 Palestinian people.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/7/25 22:40:20\n\nChina successfully mediates Palestinian factions to sign 'historic declaration' for reconciliation\n\nChina has made another significant contribution to the peace and stability of a world in turbulence as 14 factions from Palestine, including Fatah and Hamas, with key support from China, reached a historic declaration for nationwide reconciliation in Beijing on Tuesday.

More importantly, this proves that the so-called accusation of being a \"decisive enabler\" in the Russia-Ukraine conflict made by the US against China has not even been accepted by Kiev.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/7/22 20:36:13\n\nPlenum urges holistic approach to national security\n\nThe 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) issued a communique on Thursday as its third plenary session concluded, stressing that the Chinese modernization is the modernization of peaceful development, while also saying that modernizing national defense and the armed forces is an integral part of Chinese modernization.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/7/18 22:39:29\n\nFatah, Hamas reported to meet in China, 'showing nation's constructive role'\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said that China will work together with all parties within Palestine to promote reconciliation, amid reports that representatives of Fatah and Hamas are due to meet again in Beijing within days.

Chinese analysts said that apart from boosting bilateral cooperation, China will strengthen cooperation and coordination with Turkey and other major powers in the region to jointly promote a sustainable cease-fire in the continuing Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/6/3 21:05:40\n\nChina warns US about redlines on core interests as vice FM visits Washington at critical juncture\n\nChinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu's visit to the US from Thursday to Sunday aimed at sending a clear message to the US about China's redlines on its core interests while also maintaining communication between senior officials in the two countries, said Chinese experts. They also noted that if the US refuses to stop its provocations and hostile measures toward China, the tensions between the two major powers will be difficult to stabilize while Washington is still mired in problems in the Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/6/2 23:37:13\n\nChina-US relations at critical stage of preventing deterioration and promoting stability: Vice FM\n\nChina-US relations are at a critical stage of preventing deterioration and promoting stability and the US' approach of seeking dialogue while harming China's interests is unworkable. There is no future in zero-sum games under the guise of competition, and China will not accept suppression or deprivation of its legitimate development rights, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said while holding consultations with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell in Washington on Thursday local time.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/6/1 16:03:49\n\nXi meets Sisi as China, Arab countries to hold conference\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping held talks with visiting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Beijing on Wednesday.

Experts said on Monday this will surely cause large numbers of civilian casualties, and the latest development in the situation proves that the US-dominated mediation has failed once again.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/5/6 21:45:08\n\nBlinken faces difficult task 'to stop bloodshed in Gaza' with visit to Middle East\n\nUS State Secretary Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia on Monday, the first stop in a broader trip to the Middle East that aims to mediate between Israel and Hamas and stop the bloodshed in Gaza. The conflict has already brought huge domestic and external pressures to Washington, as pro-Palestine protests across major universities in Western countries are making Washington's policy of tolerating Israel's operations look increasingly unjustified and embarrassing.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/4/29 22:10:40\n\nPLA Navy celebrates 75th founding anniversary as open day events held across the country\n\nThe Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy holds open day events in multiple coastal cities across China around Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of its founding, with numerous people getting onboard advanced warships to enjoy the moment of pride and patriotism with naval officers.

China Sea'\n\nChina is showing the greatest sincerity and making concrete efforts in stabilizing situation and safeguarding peace in the West Pacific region, analysts said, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy holds a symposium to gather naval commanders and senior officers from navies around the globe to discuss maritime security from Sunday to Wednesday, while the US is about to conduct military drills with its ally the Philippines starting from Tuesday, which is bound to intensify the current tensions in the South China Sea.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/4/21 21:04:11\n\nChina's top legislator to visit N.

Extending support and aid to Ukraine was a contentious topic among NATO member countries during a two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. One day earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had proposed a 100-billion-euro, five-year package of military aid to Ukraine, which was supported by only the UK, Poland and Latvia, media reported on Friday.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/4/7 22:36:00\n\nYellen's trip eyes on 'further stabilizing' China-US ties; Washington needs Beijing's cooperation to resolve national debt crisis\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, a US senior official who is believed to be pragmatic and less hawkish toward China than many of her peers, has arrived Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, and kicked off her 6-day visit to China from Thursday to Tuesday (April 4-9), with Chinese experts saying on Friday that Yellen is trying to seek helps from China to solve US economic challenges, and they said US officials need to adjust its arrogant attitude and speak nicely when asking helps.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Zhang Weilan | 2024/4/5 22:48:46\n\nASEAN members frequently engage with China; 'peace & devt' mainstream for Asia-Pacific\n\nMany key members of ASEAN have held frequent engagements with China to reinforce and further develop the friendly ties to focus on joint development recently, while the US is trying to use the Philippines to hype up frictions in the South China Sea to interrupt the regional security situation and damage China's relations with the regional countries. Experts said the mainstream of the region is still about peace and development as the vast majority of the ASEAN share consensus with China to build community with shared future, and the vicious attempt of foreign forces is doomed to fail.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/4/2 18:00:38\n\nMa's mainland trip reflects mainstream of Taiwan that calls for anti-secessionism, cross-Straits peace: expert\n\nFormer chairperson of the Kuomintang (KMT) party Ma Ying-jeou kicked off his 11-day trip in the Chinese Mainland on Monday, with observers from both the island and the mainland paying great attention to his visit, as they expect Ma will be able to boost exchanges between youths from both sides, and balance the negative impact brought by the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/4/1 21:24:37\n\nStrategic rivalry mindset remains in US, complicates China ties: analyst\n\nChina-US relations have been in a complex situation recently. On one hand, many top US companies have expressed their interest and confidence in China's market and in the recovery of people-to-people exchanges in some fields, but on the other, the US is mulling to increase military activities in South China Sea, and Washington is taking new actions to contain China's rightful development in the high-tech fields.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Qi Xijia | 2024/3/31 21:38:06\n\nTaiwan's military acts in Kinmen 'provocative,' bringing risks of escalation for tension with mainland\n\nThe Chinese mainland is closely monitoring the actions of Taiwan island's military around Kinmen. \"If they provoke or cause trouble, daring to act rashly, they will surely face failure,\" Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said on Wednesday in response to reports that Taiwan island will conduct live-fire drills in April at locations including Kinmen and Lieyu.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Chen Qingqing | 2024/3/27 21:17:11\n\nPutin vows punishment as Moscow mourns victims\n\nThe terror attack in Moscow that has reportedly caused at least 133 deaths will further unify Russians, as Chinese experts said the incident will not weaken, but will strengthen the authority of Russian President Vladimir Putin as Russians want the government and military to revenge for the victims, and Russia will surely retaliate not only against the terrorists but also other related hostile forces behind the attack.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Zhang Wanshi | 2024/3/24 21:39:29\n\nEU summit 'to bring limited impact to Ukraine crisis'\n\nLeaders of EU member states are gathering in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit as the Ukraine crisis is bringing more concerns, as well as exerting pressure on Europe. Analysts said the EU might not be able to significantly change the situation even if major European powers have the strong political will to do so, while the difficult economic situation in Europe will impact EU leaders' consensus on how to keep supplying military aid to Kiev.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/3/21 20:35:30\n\nIndia's recent acts, remarks over China's Zangnan 'serve election purpose'\n\nThe Indian government's recent acts and remarks over the Chinese territory of Zangnan are in the interests of helping Prime Minister Narendra Modi win re-election, as he and his party want to shape a hawkish image for their nationalist voters. This does not necessarily mean that India will take real actions to provoke China or change the status quo in border regions, because New Delhi wants to win the election, not sparking a military conflict that it cannot afford, Chinese analysts said.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/3/20 20:48:46\n\nPutin reelected; 'China-Russia ties to continue to make progress'\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday congratulated Vladimir Putin on his reelection as Russian president, as Putin has addressed his supporters and declared his reelection victory earlier on the same day following the victory of presidential election with over 87 percent of the vote in his favor.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/3/18 16:57:45\n\nChina Coast Guard carries out more law-enforcement patrols in waters near Kinmen\n\nIn another patrol, China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels sailed in the waters near the Kinmen islands on Friday and Saturday, a move experts said is intended to signal that Chinese mainland law-enforcement vessels will conduct more patrols in the waters to protect lives and safeguard the legitimate rights of fishermen from both mainland and Taiwan region.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/3/17 21:29:31\n\nNATO annual report mentions China more frequently, with more hostile tone\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday released his Annual Report for 2023, and the document mentioned China more frequently and with a more hostile tone compared to the one he released last year. Chinese experts said that the words in the report are similar to those in US policy documents about âstrategic competitionâ with China, so in the future, to what extent the US-led military alliance will have friction with China depends on the development of China-US relations.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/3/15 1:04:13\n\nUkraine crisis 'may escalate' amid new aid deal\n\nThere are new dangers of an escalation in the Ukraine crisis as media claimed that NATO members are mulling deploying ground troops to join the war and the West continues to send weapons to fan the flames of the conflict. Consequently, Russia warned that it is ready for nuclear war if the US sends troops to Ukraine, while China has concluded its second round of shuttle diplomacy among key players in Europe on seeking a political settlement to the Ukraine crisis.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Liu Caiyu | 2024/3/13 22:24:35\n\nChina calls for immediate cease-fire as Gaza conflict defies Ramadan\n\nA cease-fire in Gaza has not materialized despite the arrival of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, with international concern over the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis ramping up. China on Tuesday called for an immediate cease-fire and ensuring access to humanitarian aid for the people in the region.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Du Qiongfang | 2024/3/12 22:36:31\n\nTwo sessions 'to guide China's development' with new thoughts, targets\n\nThe National People's Congress (NPC), China's national legislature, held the closing meeting of its annual session on Monday, during which lawmakers approved and passed a series of work reports and resolutions related to China's economic development plan, rule of law and central budget, marking the successful conclusion of the two sessions in 2024.\n\nBy Yang Sheng and Zhao Yusha | 2024/3/11 23:02:14\n\nCease-fire before Ramadan unlikely as 'US-proposed deal unfair for Palestinians'\n\nNegotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza are unlikely to achieve a breakthrough before the start of Ramadan, media reported. Analysts said that the key reason is that Israel just wants to have a temporary cease-fire, and Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza believe that if the cease-fire is temporary, the conflict will return to the region after Israeli forces take a break.\n\nBy Yang Sheng | 2024/3/10 21:33:46\n\nPutin 'projects confidence' over war in Ukraine, Russia's economic growth under Western sanctions\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual State of the Nation Address on Thursday.
