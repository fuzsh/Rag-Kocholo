Courtesy of CUHK-Shenzhen\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Lee Ka-chiu said via video that CUHK-Shenzhen has inherited the educational philosophy and academic system of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and stands as an example of successful educational collaboration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).\n\nLee believes that it will promote broader and higher-level cooperation among universities in the GBA and provide solid talent and sci-tech innovation support for the development of the country.\n\nDuring a speech at the ceremony, Shenzhen Mayor Qin Weizhong expressed hope that the university will quickly become a first-class research university and contribute to comprehensive reforms in higher education, sci-tech self-reliance and self-strengthening, and closer cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.\n\nRocky S. Tuan, president of CUHK, noted that CUHK and CUHK-Shenzhen will work together to continually operate under the âone brand, two campusesâ philosophy, reform and innovate higher education, and nurture young talent for the GBA and across the country.\n\nBuilt from an abandoned factory surrounded by barren land in Longgang, CUHK-Shenzhen now has a beautiful campus that covers 1.33 million square meters of land and boasts 656,000 square meters of facilities.\n\nIt has six schools â the School of Management and Economics, the School of Science and Engineering, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the School of Data Science, the School of Music, and the School of Medicine.\n\nAdditionally, it has seven colleges â Shaw College, Diligentia College, Muse College, Harmonia College, Ling College, Minerva College, and Seventh College. Its medical school, music school, and an affiliated hospital are currently under construction.\n\nAt present, 10,118 students are studying on campus.
