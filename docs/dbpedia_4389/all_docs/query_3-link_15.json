Leung Hin-ming took up his role as the 2nd Editor-in-chief of the Editorial Board, introducing more life elements in the publication and developing \"Freshman Special Edition\". The amount and quality of the later publications varied. The operational transparency and exposure were relatively low. In Year 2015 to 2016, the Editorial Board granted the statutory authority of independence. However, the designate cabinet came to dismissal at that time. The by-elected cabinet failed to succeed due to the inadequate polling rate. The first officially independent Editorial Board was elected in Year 2016 to 2017. Yau Wing-sze, the former Member of the 8th Editorial Board, took up the post of Editor-in-chief. The publication frequency changed from once a year to three times a year.
