        "text": "As a world-renowned institution, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen) has attracted a multitude of creative, outstanding, and talented students from around the world.\n\nOn February 22, 2023, a group of students at CUHK-Shenzhen, having recognized many features and certain shortcomings of the University, proposed an intriguing idea: to establish a new university that \"retains the essence of CUHK-Shenzhen and discards the flaws.\" Their proposal, which is later published and called the Singapore Initiative, involved establishing a new university in Singapore that would inherit the longstanding philosophy of CUHK while also addressing its limitations.\n\nOnce the Singapore Initiative was proposed, it attracted numerous enthusiastic individuals and advanced thinkers. Prominent figures such as David Li, Willy Dharma, Jasper Lee, Prvz Miah, and Shafin Habib, among others, joined this initiative and injected strong vitality into our new university. As of May 2023, more than 36 \"professors\" have already joined our new university.\n\nWhere will this creative university be located? Never forget why we started, and we can accomplish our mission. In order to fulfill the Singapore Initiative's original aspiration of providing quotas for students from Southeast Asia to join in a university and to reflect our international characteristics, we have decided to establish the main campus in an international city in Southeast Asia. After thorough discussions, research, and comparative analysis, and with the unanimous agreement of all members of the Governing Board, we have chosen Singapore as the location for the main campus. Additionally, as a token of appreciation for the dedicated contributions from Associate President Willy from Indonesia and President Jasper from Thailand, we will also establish branch campuses in Jakarta, the former capital of Indonesia, and Bangkok, the capital of Thailand.\n\nWhen will this creative university be established? We plan to officially establish the university in 2043 and hold the inaugural opening ceremony on September 1, 2043 (Tuesday). 2043 is a significant year as it marks the 80th anniversary of the establishment of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Being a university that inherits the educational philosophy of CUHK, if we can complete the construction of the main campus before this year, we can present a gift to CUHK on its 80th birthday. Furthermore, 2045 is the centenary of Indonesia's independence. If we can complete the construction of the Indonesian branch campus before that year, we can contribute to Indonesia's centennial celebration and offer our gift to commemorate their hundred years of nationhood.\n\nWhat should this creative university be named? Considering that the main campus will be located in Singapore and to reflect our international characteristics, we have decided to name it \"The International University of Singapore\", in short \"IUS\". Of course, since our university is founded by members of CUHK, we also have a nickname, CUHK-Singapore, which is widely known among students and well-known to the public.\n\nSince the Singapore Initiative was first published on February 24, 2023, the University has made many achievements before its formal foundation. Click the link to view our key events in each year.\n\nFounded on February 24, 2023, The International University of Singapore has always sought to develop and increase its influence in China Mainland, especially Shenzhen, one of the most internationalized cities in China Mainland.\n\nOn May 15, 2023, after the strong support of many parties, our Embassy in CUHK-Shenzhen was finally formally established and is located in Room 619, Ling College Block B, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Prof. Prvz will be the first CUHK-Singapore ambassador to CUHK-Shenzhen.\n\nThe embassy is mainly responsible for the following affairs:\n\nPropagate CUHK-Singapore to CUHK-Shenzhen students, especially freshmen. Induce and encourage them to transfer to IUS, join IUS as a visiting/exchange student, or attend summer classes at IUS.\n\nOrganize activities in CUHK-Shenzhen for IUS members, including sports days, basketball matches, high table dinners, and so on.\n\nProvide learning materials from previous cohorts freely, including lecture notes (combination PDF), midterm/final exam papers, and other essential materials.\n\nProvide a platform for CUHK-Shenzhen students to find classmates, swap sessions, buy courses, and so on.\n\nOffer a free temporary academic VPN and ChatGPT account for any CUHK-Shenzhen student.\n\nRecord basic math (calculus, linear algebra) lectures and upload them to IUS's official YouTube for the use of CUHK-Shenzhen junior students.\n\nPublish WeChat Official account posts.\n\nIn CUHK-Singapore, we will ensure a whole process democracy, including democratic decision-making, democractic elections, democratic consultation, democratic management, and democratic oversight.\n\nDemocratic Decision-making\n\nCUHK-Singapore establishes three decision-making bodies: the President's Office, the Senate of Staff, and the House of Students. Together, the Senate and House form the Governing Board.\n\nThe Governing Board convenes regular meetings every Friday evening. In special circumstances, ad hoc meetings may be called.\n\nDecisions made by the university and its departments, schools, colleges, and embassies are categorized into two types. \"Notices\" refer to specific, minor decisions made within departments. \"Policies\" encompass important decisions or those that have cross-departmental implications, requiring approval by the Governing Board. All notices that do not align with any policy should be revoked.\n\nNotices can be issued directly by departments upon achieving internal consensus.\n\nHowever, for every new policy issued by the university, it must be separately approved by the Senate and the House of the Governing Board. The process involves introducing a proposal in either chamber by a teacher senator or student representative. The proposal is then assigned to a committee for research, discussion, and revisions. Afterward, the proposal is put to a vote in the respective chamber. If approved in one chamber, it proceeds to the other chamber for a similar process of research, discussion, revisions, and voting. Once both chambers vote to accept a proposal, any differences between the versions are reconciled, and a final vote is held. If the proposal passes, it is presented to the President for consideration. The President can either approve the proposal, sign it into policy, or veto it. A veto can be overridden by the Governing Board in most cases. However, if the President does not sign a proposal, and the Governing Board is no longer in session, the proposal is vetoed by default. This action, known as a pocket veto, cannot be overridden by the Governing Board.\n\nThe Governing Board has the power to impeach the President. After the House of Students passes an impeachment resolution by a simple majority, the President is impeached. The resolution is then presented to the Senate of Staff for voting. If more than two-thirds of the Senate members vote in favor of the impeachment resolution, the President is removed from office.\n\nDemocratic Elections\n\nThe Governing Board will establish an Election Committee to independently organize and oversee the election process, including candidate registration and vote counting.\n\nGeneral elections for student and staff “congressmen” are held annually on the last Saturday of April. Each term lasts from July 1st to June 30th of the following year. Senators are full-time staff, while representatives are students. Elections are conducted based on the college system. Within the five colleges, representatives are elected based on the number of votes received, with each floor having priority. Nine Senate seats and 19 House seats are allocated from each college.\n\nIn addition to regular elections, a freshmen by-election is held in late September each year, only allowing freshmen students to participate. The election is open to all students, who cast their votes to determine the freshmen representatives. Six House seats are allocated from each college.\n\nCampaign and Election Process:\n\nEncourage participating student and staff candidates to deliver policy speeches.\n\nPublish the list of successfully nominated student “congressmen” before the election day.\n\nRequire a certain deposit from both student and teacher candidates.\n\nStudent congressmen receive remuneration equivalent to student assistants.\n\nOrganizational Promotion:\n\nPromote dialogue and cooperation between students and faculty members through active consultation.\n\nConduct educational campaigns to deepen democratic values and foster their widespread acceptance."
