Hong Kong's unique position as a bridge between East and West, combined with its international outlook and strong academic traditions, has solidified its status as a leading destination for those who wish to study in Hong Kong. Among these institutions, the University of Hong Kong stands out for its long history and academic excellence.\n\nHKUST: A Rising Star in Global Higher Education\n\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) was founded in 1991 as part of the government's initiative to expand Hong Kong's higher education sector.
