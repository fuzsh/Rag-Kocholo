        "text": "I know why you’re here.\n\nYou wanna see somebody tear this album apart… and then you either wanna tear me apart, or enjoy the analytical destruction kicked back in a comfy chair munching on a tasty snack thinking about younger Dennis DeYoung’s ego.\n\nHonestly I can’t really talk about Dennis now, like Present-Day Italian Grandpa Dennis.\n\nHe does look like that, right?\n\nAnyway, if you’re reading this post then I’m certain you’re familiar with the 1983 Styx album Kilroy Was Here and the whole dilemma behind it.\n\nIf you aren’t, I am more than happy to explain it! Not anything fancy though.\n\nBasically, it was Dennis’ idea. The album was a response of sorts to Christian groups back in the day that took issue with rock and metal bands for supposedly incorporating Satantic messages and backmasking in their songs. Bands like Twisted Sister, AC/DC and ELO got caught up in this whirlwind, and obviously it didn’t leave Styx behind.\n\nDennis wanted Kilroy to be huge, but the rest of the band had trouble accepting it and it only got worse when he decided they needed to orchestrate an entire stage show to perform as they sang. None of the Styx guys, aside from Dennis, are natural melodramatic stage actors at heart. But he was gonna force ‘em to be! BOOM. Kilroy was born… and it drove the band apart.\n\nThe actual story in Kilroy is essentially this:\n\nThe world is in chaos after a very strict and powerful fascist theocratic organization, the Majority for Musical Morality (MMM, or Triple M as I say it)—led by evil dictator Dr. Righteous (played by JY)—takes away all rock music and even resorts to publicly converting young rock musicians into ‘good citizens’. They burn instruments and lock people up, and because of the oppression, musicians are forced to form a rock underground type of society for their safety.\n\nAll hope seems lost… but two unlikely heroes work quickly in the shadows.\n\nOne is an ex-rock star, Robert Orin Charles Kilroy (it’s supposed to spell out ROCK, of course… and he’s played by Dennis, of course). Naturally feisty and itching to pick fights, he’s always locked up in prison under the watch of the Robotos— the robotic army Dr. Righteous employed to keep rock prisoners at bay. Kilroy finally figures out a good plan to escape prison by posing as a Roboto (during the song “Mr. Roboto”).\n\nThe other hero is a young guitarist named Jonathan Chance (played by Tommy Shaw; also not so subtle symbolism, eh?). Instead of accepting the fate of a fallen society, Jonathan rises from the ashes and sneaks around the city in an attempt to locate Kilroy and take down Dr. Righteous and his goons (two being the Panozzo twins) to win back rock n roll.\n\nSo, that sounds really cool! The album also had a corresponding short film played at the start of shows (also known as Kilroy Was Here the film, or Caught in the Act). It follows the start of Kilroy and Jonathan’s quest, where Kilroy escapes from prison and Jonathan breaks into the old Paradise Theatre. The two meet up, and that transitions into the start of the show.\n\nNext to that there are separate music videos illustrating the rest of their journey, and some of them… just don’t make sense? Or at least, look out of place. Like their corresponding songs.\n\nAnd that’s mainly why the album is a mess. It proposes an interesting and exciting artistic concept, which includes social and political commentary relating to the time period, and enforces it in the short film and some of the songs and videos. But the rest of the album feels misplaced, like there are songs that don’t belong and don’t push the story along. It’s all randomly placed, like Dennis had an inkling of an idea about what he wanted to do, but then it went a little haywire somewhere along the way.\n\nPersonally, I think Kilroy could’ve worked better as a longer album with more songs, for more details to the story’s background. At the same time, I’m quite confident the rest of Styx didn’t want to torture themselves any longer than 9 songs.\n\nI mean, of course the album could have just stuck with the 9-song track list here— but to me, there should’ve been more substance in just those 9. A little something more… because most of the songs we ended up with have little to do with the album’s concept.\n\nThis is the part where we break it down, folks. This is the juice of the steak.\n\nI’m gonna show you that, even though some of the songs are killer bops… the Kilroy album is a mess.\n\nAlright, we’re going one by one. Each section is for a song and the corresponding music video.\n\nMr. Roboto\n\nUndoubtedly the catchiest song on the track, and the one everybody knows somehow. It’s like, when somebody hears ‘Styx’ you have the people who associate them with ‘Come Sail Away’, and others associate ‘Mr. Roboto’. Maybe even ‘Babe’ comes to mind.\n\nThis is the beginning of the album, where Kilroy escapes prison under the guise of a dispatched Roboto guard.\n\nHe tells the world he’s “got a secret” that he must hide to protect himself.\n\nThis is also the song in which Dennis DeYoung invents a word. Certainly the Shakespeare of our time!\n\nIt’s a good start to the album and introduces the listener to these Robotos in Dennis’ dystopia. But even so, I sort of wish he actually slipped in a song before this one explaining Kilroy’s situation, instead of relying on the short film to clear up the storytelling.\n\nWatching the short film, you know for a fact that he’s in prison. In the song, you know he needs to disguise himself to escape and hide, but it’s like… where is Kilroy? How did he get there?\n\nWe find out later, also from the short film, that Kilroy was accused of allegedly murdering someone from the MMM in the Paradise Theatre. So, the reason for Kilroy being in prison wasn’t just because he’s a prominent rock star who needs to be taught a lesson like everyone else. It’s because he supposedly killed someone, I guess? I don’t think that plot point goes anywhere.\n\nI feel like if there was a backstory song before “Mr. Roboto”, we would better understand Kilroy’s situation and mindset, as well as the world he lives in. Instead we jump right into it, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing— I just think it could’ve been done with better flow so “Mr. Roboto” makes a bit more sense instead of just being the cool opening catchy song showcasing how neat and clever Kilroy is and ‘technology bad’.\n\nYou know what, lemme say something about that part, too— apparently the Robotos were Japanese-made because of the ‘80s nationwide fear of Japan taking over economically, and so they’re scary spooky. Is this really the album for this oddly specific commentary? Like we can’t save rock n roll without taking a dig at the Japanese tech and auto industries, ooooh scary!\n\nDespite this, “Mr. Roboto” DOES stick with the concept for the album and the story is kicked into action.\n\nNow in the music video for “Mr. Roboto”, Kilroy dances and dramatically flails himself around on a flashy stage in the dark, my guess in the Paradise Theatre since that’s where he meets Jonathan in the film.\n\nThere are flashbacks to the scenes in prison when Kilroy is in his cell and the Roboto comes to scold him for his behavior in the cafeteria (where he instigated a fight with another Roboto).\n\nI dunno about you guys, but… if I was on the run from the rock-hating fascist government and killer robots, I probably wouldn’t want to make myself too known? Like he’s just on that stage giving a full performance as if that isn’t the most deadly thing he could do to himself at that very moment.\n\nFor somebody who keeps saying he needs to hide, HE AIN’T HIDING TOO WELL.\n\nCold War\n\nProbably my least favorite song on the album because I don’t really like the sound, but I’m not going to hold a bias!\n\nTaking inspiration from the notorious actual Cold War (ya know, tensions between the USA and the Soviet Union and all that), this song is about the tensions between the oppressed rockers and the tyrannical MMM and Dr. Righteous.\n\nIt’s sung by Jonathan Chance, or Tommy Shaw IRL. He’s tired of bowing down to the MMM and he warns of a secret revolution brewing in the underground.\n\nI say “Cold War” fits the album’s concept, it just doesn’t really further the story— which begins the problem with much of the album’s content. Some of the songs don’t serve the purpose of the album.\n\nAt least this one actually refers to the conflict between the two parties in the story and how it’s brought Jonathan to his breaking point, so that’s still quite important!\n\nThere’s no music video for this one, so let’s continue on.\n\nDon’t Let it End\n\nAwwwww, don’t even get me started!\n\nNevermind, THIS is my least favorite song. “Cold War” gets a pass.\n\nSuddenly, the story comes to an abrupt halt. And we are only 3 SONGS IN.\n\nIt’s a pop rock song about lost romance. In the song, Kilroy talks of a lady love who I guess walked out on him and he has trouble letting her go. Very sad, quite terrible, yes yes.\n\nBut what does it have to do with the album!\n\nSeriously! We were doing good for two songs, what on Earth happened? We’re only three songs in and the album has already started to drift from its original purpose. It’s supposed to be making a mockery of groups like the MMM and taking a stand for the rock bands who got caught up in legal issues for Satanism and ‘poisoning the youth’.\n\nFor SOME reason, Dennis briefly throws that out the window in favor of a random love ballad?\n\nDamn, he just couldn’t help himself, could he?\n\nThe music video is just as unbelievable.\n\nKilroy is angsting on his living room couch, which then morphs into his depressing dark prison cell facing a big empty room. He has a picture of his lady, he’s sad, yadda yadda.\n\nBut then… he just waltzes right out of his cell! Yeah, he just slides that door open and joins his little band buddies downstairs on a funky little dance floor and he’s twirling around all sad and whatnot.\n\nNot only did the story stop in the song, but visually, too! I thought Kilroy was guarded and followed at all times, at least based on the short film. Is he dreaming? Hallucinating? Does he think he still has a band and he’s just imagining it all because he feels so alone? How is he able to give a rock performance in a heavily guarded anti-rock prison?\n\nI don’t know if Dennis even thought of it that deeply!\n\nHigh Time\n\nThank god, we’re back on track.\n\n“High Time”, sung by Kilroy, is another revolution song similar to Jonathan’s.\n\nKilroy describes turning on the TV (“laser video”) and never seeing anything but the face of the evil Dr. Righteous, and that’s really grinding his gears.\n\nWhat I love about this song is that it actually brings up some solid, thought-provoking ideas— how authoritative powers can manipulate the youth through cleverly disguised messages and twisting words to appeal to them or scare them into submission.\n\nAnd my favorite lines have gotta be “It ain’t the music that’s in question … It’s more the freedom of expression”.\n\nBasically, it’s indeed a revolution song like Jonathan’s, but less about the deep conflict leading to a revolt and more about actually starting the revolution itself.\n\nNo music video, let’s trudge.\n\nHeavy Metal Poisoning\n\nYEEEESSSS dude! I like this one! But I digress, for I must maintain professionalism.\n\nOkay, so this is the bad guy evil villain song— absolutely perfect for JY, who as I’ve said before portrays the bonkers Dr. Righteous.\n\nDr. Righteous is already a campy villain caricature who’s really hammed it up in the music video and the short film. I think JY had some fun with his role!\n\nOf course the song is delivered with a delightful campiness, with JY exaggerating his tone (and screaming as usual). But the delivery of this song, and the goofiness of the music video, brings up yet another question.\n\nHow seriously does Dennis want us to take Kilroy Was Here, exactly?\n\nI know having Dr. Righteous as an exaggerated caricature is part of the message— he wants to mock those real anti-rock authorities with a campy typical villain type, instead of somebody too foreboding and serious and essentially giving those people what they want.\n\nBut then the effort he put into this whole thing and coercing everybody to go along with it makes me think he really wanted Kilroy to be held in the same respects as a professionally produced theatrical play or rock-based film.\n\nAnother Tommy (1975), the next Pink Floyd’s The Wall (1982). Something huge or revolutionary.\n\nThe messages, the drama, the fact that he portrayed himself as the story’s comeback hero? C’mon Dennis, you’re sending us mixed messages, man! Are you saying “please don’t take me that seriously” or “please take me that seriously” because honestly, I can’t really tell.\n\nWelp, back to JY. The evil villain song is a MUST in rock operas, even when Dr. Righteous isn’t a scary figure— more like a cartoon character, which I find enjoyable but it sort of takes away the seriousness of the material.\n\nOH, I almost forgot to mention the irony! An anti-rock villain is singing a rock song. I’m gonna say Dennis is a rather clever fella, and that he did that on purpose to show the government’s hypocrisy and skewed logic.\n\nI also like the point he was (possibly) trying to make with Righteous saying “Pop your pills and drink and smoke / Shoot those chemicals in your veins / Anything to ease the pain”. It’s representative of these groups putting all of their focus on the ‘sinful’ rock n roll fans instead of directing their efforts towards real problems like drug addiction. In this dystopian world, Righteous considers drug addiction a more reasonable way to deal with stress instead of listening to music, and so allows it to slide.\n\nSo, uh… props to you, Dennis?\n\nIn the music video, we get to see Jonathan again as he breaks into a Righteous rally playing guitar and getting up in Dr. Righteous’ face before being dragged away.\n\nAt the rally, Righteous is lecturing his followers (through song as we discussed) on the dangers of rock and metal music poisoning the minds of the youth. An excited pair of parents drag their rock and roll inflicted teenage son on stage to be converted. Funny enough, Righteous grabs the boy’s guitar and plays it for a few seconds before cracking it in half.\n\nIn the middle of a comical dance break, that’s when Jonathan breaks in and promptly gets his ass handed to him. I mean, he tried ya know?\n\nJust Get Through This Night\n\nThe official Jonathan Chance power ballad.\n\nIn the song, he’s trying to gather up all the courage he can and convince himself to push past obstacles and end up triumphant.\n\nIt’s quite a lovely song! Jonathan is coming to terms with his mixed emotions and fear of not succeeding, so it’s almost like a hero’s lowest point in your typical hero’s journey kind of tale.\n\nI think it still sticks to the album’s concept. It’s another turn away from the killer robots and scary government, but a nice quiet song and at least relates to the emotional side of the story.\n\nEven with no corresponding music video, I can still imagine Jonathan making his way across silent rooftops in the mask of darkness, close to giving up but still holding on to hope of meeting Kilroy and saving rock.\n\nDouble Life\n\nSo, this song is sung by JY, or Dr. Righteous. It would appear he’s talking about somebody living a ‘double life’, having to balance being someone else during the day and night.\n\nIt’s weird because I can’t actually tell who he’s referring to, considering he says “I’m schizophrenic and so am I” later in the song.\n\nSo is Righteous starting to lose his mind, or is he already unstable and trying to hide it? What sort of double life is he leading?\n\nDoes he secretly want to be a rock star, despite being part of the Majority for Musical Morality? Let’s think back— the man got his own rock songs… he called rock “music” instead of noise or racket… he briefly played guitar and totally killed it before snapping the guitar in half… and now he’s singing about leading a double life.\n\nAt first I thought he was talking about Kilroy leading a double life as an ex-rock star and a Roboto in order to save his skin. But he doesn’t know Kilroy escaped prison, unless his escape somehow ended up on the news already. But he also doesn’t know that Kilroy is wearing a disguise.\n\nSo I can only be left reasonably thinking that it’s a song about Righteous’ unstable mind. With the context clues, I believe it is about Righteous and his secret desire to play rock music, which would go against everything he stands for, or was taught to stand for.\n\nIt could be commentary on the people persecuting others for loving rock n roll when they themselves feel devoid of freedom—likely with some childhood-interest suppression sprinkled in—and thus secretly desire to live again without judgement.\n\nI cannot say for certain… you’ve beaten me, Dennis. Partially.\n\nI’m going to say that it still relates to the concept album, but it’s weaker and doesn’t further anything. It gives us insight on Dr. Righteous’ “inner workings” but so far the story has become more jumbled with each song.\n\nStarting back at “High Time”, there was clear motive to start a musical revolution against the MMM and Kilroy sets out to do so, once he finds Jonathan anyway. Then we got Righteous’ “Heavy Metal Poisoning” when he lectures everybody about staying away from rock music, and Jonathan is taken off the premises.\n\nThen we have Jonathan’s power ballad, but we literally have no idea where he is. Did he escape the clutches of the MMM? Is he still wandering around the city or on the outskirts? All we know is that he is sad and needs to boost his confidence.\n\nNow we’re here, at Righteous’ mental breakdown. We can only assume that Kilroy and Jonathan are still trekking across the city in search of the Paradise Theatre.\n\nI guess our questions are about to be answered… sort of. This next song is BONKERS, dude.\n\nHaven’t We Been Here Before\n\nThis song… this music video…\n\nWHAT!?\n\nHelp help the story’s gone off the rails!\n\nOK, so let’s talk about the song first. There’s nothing to talk about. It’s another ballad.\n\nWe have no clue where Jonathan is, except for the weird shit he does in the video. First we see him appear at a big window in a dimly lit blue room… after we just saw cartoonish footsteps running through grass until the grass opens up, revealing a… thingy? It rises off the ground and past the other window in the room.\n\nThen Jonathan puts his hands on the window, he turns into a silhouette and shatters.\n\nMeanwhile in a restaurant of some kind, Kilroy is at a table arguing with Greasy JY (I don’t think he’s Dr. Righteous here because why would he sit with Dr. Righteous?) about something but we can’t hear (cards?).\n\nThis is the song I realized I so deeply missed Dennis’ signature mustache and mop hair. Now he’s kinda uncanny—\n\nSo Kilroy and Greasy JY get into a fight and Kilroy dramatically shoves the hanging lamp above them, which parallels a little girl swinging back and forth in a chair? Then a pendulum swings the same way?\n\nThen the pendulum comes back, but this time Jonathan is clinging on for dear life and almost slips and plummets to his purple room death. Trust me, I’m sure Tommy thought he was gonna die that day and come back as a ghost to haunt Dennis on set.\n\nOh yeah, and there’s a… there’s a creepy clown puppet that keeps doing slow flips on chairs. Don’t know what the hell that means and I kinda don’t wanna know. Dennis can keep that freaky shit to himself.\n\nBack in the restaurant, all the sleazy guys suddenly start scrambling to stop their card games and look normal, before old dudes in suits barge in searching for someone. One of them tries to interrogate John Panozzo the Bartender, but he ain’t talking.\n\nOne of the dudes stares down at Kilroy and Greasy JY. And Kilroy… ya know, does he even care that he’s being seen out in public? Surely these police state dudes know what Robert Orin Charles Kilroy looks like, right? He’s just in this restaurant out in the open, no disguise or anything. Was this something that happened in the past before Kilroy was taken in, before the Roboto disguise?\n\nMEANWHILE, Jonathan is still clinging onto the pendulum for dear life and this time he’s just hanging off. I think he needs help.\n\nWe now come to the video’s end. The old dudes leave the restaurant, Kilroy and Greasy JY shake hands and everyone is cheering. Old dude goes to the blue room and we end on a freaky shadow of the stupid freaky clown.\n\nWhat did this video give me about the plot? Nothing. What did the lyrics tell me about where we are in the story? Nothing. Do we know if Kilroy and Jonathan have accomplished anything? No.\n\nOnce again I got a whole lot of nothing and have no clue what’s going on. Why is Kilroy in a restaurant? Were those old dudes looking for him or just sniffing out all those sinful rock musicians to arrest them? Is Jonathan just a memory or a figment of Kilroy’s imagination in this part of the video? And then they were both next to the swinging pendulum, so is this just some weird flashback? WHERE ARE THEY!\n\nThis is the second to last song in the album, which means we’re technically one song away from when Kilroy and Jonathan are supposed to meet in the Paradise Theatre. AND, not to mention, this is the last REAL song on the album.\n\nThe last song on the album, the conclusion of this story, is abrupt and kinda lackluster even though it sounds happy.\n\nDon’t Let it End (Reprise)\n\nBased on the lyrics, this is the short happy ending song where Kilroy and Jonathan meet up and set out to make sure rock music doesn’t end. It’s different in the short film, where Kilroy and Jonathan meet up and Kilroy reveals himself after removing his Roboto mask, and “Mr. Roboto” plays instead of “Don’t Let it End (Reprise)”.\n\nIt’s a nice song, I actually really love how upbeat and triumphant it sounds. It makes for a nice happy ending theme, which fits better after a grand finale sort of song… which we didn’t get.\n\nActually, the vibe “Don’t Let it End (Reprise)” gives me is more along the lines of “we saved rock n roll and took down the MMM!” instead of “we’re meeting in secret in a dark depressing theater”.\n\nReally, it does! Can you imagine there being a grand finale song before this one, where Kilroy and Jonathan lead an army of rockers and face off with Dr. Righteous once and for all? Where Kilroy, Jonathan, and Righteous take turns spitting trash talk back and forth and battling Righteous’ words with loud music and surrounding him, pressuring him to give up? And tying in to his mental breakdown in “Double Life”, Righteous crumbles and reveals himself to be a secret fan of rock music and forces himself to face… well, himself? And with the fall of Dr. Righteous, Kilroy and Jonathan know there’s still hope of taking down the MMM and revolting against the government until they’re heard.\n\nHoly SHIT, guys. I came up with that on the spot and that’s STILL a better, more satisfying ending than what we were given. The real ending of the album is ambiguous, but in a bad way because the entire concept just wasn’t carried out right!\n\nThe final analysis…\n\nAfter going through and breaking down each song on Kilroy Was Here, it’s even clearer to me than ever before just how utterly messy the story’s execution was.\n\nLike I said way earlier (sorry for how long it became), Dennis DeYoung put forth a really interesting and clever album story concept that obviously had a lot of potential.\n\nBy the end of the whole thing, it’s easy to tell that Dennis actually bit off more than he could chew and didn’t quite have the experience or organization needed to make this project work. His mind is scattered and does what it wants, which isn’t bad— I’m a rather well-known scatterbrain amongst my friends and family, organization is sometimes difficult for me. But this is especially unhelpful when you’re dead set on producing such a heavy undertaking.\n\nHe didn’t develop the story enough for the story to flow naturally and it lost itself along the way down songs that just weren’t fitting or kept taking us away from the action needlessly. Dennis really wanted that pop rock love song in there, even when it had no place in the concept. If it was supposed to demonstrate Kilroy’s loneliness or something, I’m not buying it. It just wasn’t good enough to keep the concept strong.\n\nIt started off pretty strong with “Mr. Roboto”, and I really wish it kept this strong momentum the whole way through.\n\nIN CONCLUSION… Kilroy Was Here is definitely a hot garbage dumpster trash fire and mostly DID NOT stick to the album concept, and that is why it kinda failed and also didn’t because a lot of people love it nowadays because it sounds nice.\n\nI’m among the very few people looking at this silly album with so much scrutiny, but it’s what I love to do and I love story theory discourse!\n\nAnyway, Dennis snogs robots PASS IT ON. Thanks for reading!"
