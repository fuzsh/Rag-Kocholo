The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:07 a.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Maxine Waters [chairwoman of the subcommittee] presiding. Members present: Representatives Waters, Lynch, Cleaver, Green, Driehaus, Himes, Maffei; and Capito. Chairwoman Waters. This hearing of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity will come to order. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank the ranking member and other members of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity for joining me today for this hearing on academic perspectives on the future of public housing. Public housing plays an important role in providing affordable rental housing for 1.2 million households, containing about 3 million individuals. In fact, research suggests that residents of public housing fare better across a number of measures than households at similar income levels who live in private market apartments without housing assistance. Despite the many successes of public housing, some critics continue to associate the program only with problems. These perceptions of public housing have led some public housing authorities to push for the continued demolition of public housing units. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates since 1995, 200,000 public housing units, including the great majority of large high-rises have already been torn down, just as yesterday the Associated Press reported that the City of Atlanta is in the process of demolishing the last of its public housing, making it both the first city to have public housing and the first major city to eliminate it. These negative perceptions of public housing also helped fuel disinvestments in the program over the last 8 years. For too long, our Federal housing policy said that homeownership was a one-size-fits-all approach for all households and neglected the important need that public housing fills for some individuals and families. Year after year, our Federal budgets reflected these priorities. Beginning in 2003, the Federal Government underfunded the public housing operating fund for 6 consecutive years. The public housing capital fund has also fallen well short of need in recent years. Where estimates vary, the Center on Budget and Public Policy priorities estimates the cost of needed repairs and modest upgrades at $22 billion. As the current Administration begins to reverse the trend of underfunding the program, I believe that now is the time to look at how the current program can be improved, so that it best serves the needs of low-income families. First, we must address the loss of units throughout the country. The HOPE VI Program has accelerated the demolition of public housing, leading to a net loss of at least 50,000 units. That is why last year I introduced in the House, and the House passed, a HOPE VI reauthorization bill that required one-for- one replacement. In addition, Chairman Frank and I recently wrote to Secretary Donovan to request a one-year moratorium on all public housing demolitions. I am also troubled by resident displacement and the low rates of return among original public housing tenants. Additionally, I believe we need to build-up the record of HOPE VI and reconsider how well public housing programs meet the needs of different types of residents. In particular, I am concerned about whether we are adequately serving the most vulnerable public housing residents, including elderly and disabled residents, families with children, and included in that ex-offenders. More needs to be done to ensure that housing is connected to job opportunities, affordable healthcare, and transportation. We also need to improve upon how public housing agencies and nonprofits work together to provide case management services to residents of all ages by grounds and levels of need. This case management needs to continue through the life of the development and it needs to effectively target residents who relocate with vouchers. It is time to rethink the way that residents are involved in the process of governing their communities, particularly when redevelopment takes place. This includes helping residents access job opportunities right in their own backyards and ensuring that they can advocate for how their communities are designed. I am pleased that our witnesses are here today to comment on these issues. There are many questions we have yet to answer on these important topics and I look forward to our witnesses' testimony. I thank you, and I would now like to recognize our ranking member, Ranking Member Capito, for 5 minutes for an opening statement. Mrs. Capito. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And I want to thank the witnesses today for coming before us. I don't have a formal opening statement. I just have a couple of things I would like to say, and I also want to apologize. I have to go to the Floor to manage two or three suspensions, so I might be in and out during the committee hearing. At this point in time, I think it's well-placed to be looking at the future of public housing and how we can best use our resources. Right now at this moment, Federal spending on public housing is at an all-time high. When you combine the consolidated appropriations with the stimulus package, it's quite sizeable, and certainly the same can be said for the HUD appropriations bill that was passed last week. I think it's important as we look at more dollars that we do this in a smart and efficient way, and one of the things I have learned through service on this committee in talking with my local housing folks is that some flexibility needs to be built into the program. So, as the chairwoman said, a one-size- fits-all approach no longer fits the housing authorities and the others who are in the position to make decisions. That's why we did our Section 8, the Moving to Work revisions I think were good because of the flexibility we built in there, and I would like to see us build flexibility into our public housing programs as well. I think that innovative solutions are what we are looking for today, and I'm certain most of you have great ideas on that in terms of how to reach our vulnerable populations, whether it's our elderly or disabled from my perspective representing a rural State. I think it's important too that we realize that rural America has great housing needs, maybe not in the greater numbers. But as a lot of our aging population lives in the rural area, certainly in my State, we need to be able to help them meet the challenges they have as they move into their elderly years and make sure that they are in safe, affordable housing. I have also noticed in my own community of Charleston, West Virginia, when we have tried to reshape the face of public housing, that a lot of the housing units were clustered together intensely, and have come into quite disrepair, because of the age, basically, of the units. And I think our housing authority has done a wonderful job in terms of reshaping the face of public housing in our community, but I think they have been able to use some flexibility in terms of not necessarily a one-to-one replacement in that exact locality but spread those units around the different city and area to make sure the units are there, but they are not as heavily concentrated as they had been in the past. And one of the aspects I think it's important that we emphasize too, is as we rebuild and renovate units, that we do this in a smart and efficient way to use our dollars the best, and that's to make sure we build an energy efficiency and the green standards I think will help drive cost savings, but also be a smarter way to use our dollars. So with that I would like to thank the chairwoman for having this hearing and I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses. Thank you. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Mr. Lynch is now recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I appreciate you holding this hearing and I appreciate your longstanding advocacy on behalf of families living in public housing. I would also like to welcome our panelists and I thank them in advance for their testimony on this very important issue. As someone who was raised in public housing in the housing projects in South Boston, I understand the important role that public housing can provide for families and the community at large. Federally-subsidized public housing provides homes for about 3 million Americans living in 1.2 million households today, but we know that our public housing stock is insufficient and more units are necessary. Prior to coming to Congress, I worked as a young lawyer. I did pro bono work in the housing projects in the City of Boston representing families living in public housing, who were having trouble with lead paint on the pipes, asbestos in the apartments. Folks who were underhoused, a lot of kids living in apartments with maybe one bedroom. So I know the strain that's facing a lot of families in public housing. Many factors have contributed to a shortage of public housing, including insufficient Federal funding and the demolition of aging units without replacements, as Chairwoman Waters has mentioned. This committee has received testimony at previous hearings, and I have heard from the public housing community in my district, that public housing agencies lack sufficient staff and resources to perform inspections and maintain aging buildings. It is especially stressful in larger urban areas, including some cities in the Northeast, such as in my district in Boston, where the housing stock is older than in many parts of the country. We know that additional maintenance and inspections are necessary to ensure tenants' safety and the proper allocation of Federal resources. The lasting questions related to public housing are grounded in how to best use affordable housing as a platform for families' stability and independence. Research has supported the idea that a stable, safe, and clean place to live can serve as the foundation for self-sufficiency. And as we enter into a new phase of federally-subsidized housing, I am interested in hearing more about the many approaches to the future of public housing intervention, whether it's a continuation of the mobility-based, mixed-income models that have helped transform old high-rises into revitalized communities or the prioritization of housing preservation for certain populations like the disabled and elderly. I look forward to hearing from our panelists on these ideas. I want to thank you, Madam Chairwoman, again for your advocacy on this issue and for convening this hearing. And I yield back the balance of my time. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Mr. Himes, would you like to make an opening statement? If not, we will move to our witnesses. Again, we want to thank you for being here today. We will recognize you each for 5 minutes, and we will begin with our first witness, Dr. Thomas Boston, professor, School of Economics, Georgia Institute of Technology. Our second witness will be the Honorable Orlando Cabrera, CEO, National Community Renaissance and Of Counsel to Nixon Peabody. Our third witness will be Dr. James Fraser, associate professor, Department of Human and Organizational Development, Vanderbilt University. Our fourth witness will be Dr. Edward Goetz, director, Center for Urban and Regional Affairs, University of Minnesota. Our fifth witness will be Dr. Laura Harris, assistant professor, School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy, University of Memphis. Our sixth witness will be Mr. David Jones, president and CEO, Community Service Society of New York. Our seventh witness will be Dr. Mark Joseph, assistant professor, Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences, Case Western Reserve University. And our eighth witness will be Dr. Susan Popkin, director, Program on Neighborhoods and Youth Development, The Urban Institute. Without objection, your written statements will be made a part of the record. You will be now be recognized for a 5- minute summary of your testimony. Thank you. Starting with you, Dr. Boston. STATEMENT OF DR. THOMAS D. BOSTON, PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Mr. Boston. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and the honorable and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Your invitation letter asked me to answer eight specific questions related to my research on the Atlanta Housing Authority, and I will restrict my answers to those questions. And let me start simply by summarizing my research findings, and that is that when low-income housing-assisted families are given access to quality affordable housing in neighborhoods of greater opportunity, their self-sufficiency increases significantly. The first question I was asked to respond to was to describe my research on public housing in Atlanta. I have mainly focused on how mixed-income revitalization, housing choice vouchers, and public housing have affected family self- sufficiency. I have examined 20,000 administrative records of families who received housing assistance from the Atlanta Housing Authority between 1995 and 2007, and, more recently, I completed an examination of 26,000 families who received housing assistance from the Chicago Housing Authority between 1999 and 2007. I have attempted to answer the following questions: Did families relocate to better neighborhoods when the housing projects they lived in were demolished? Did they lose housing assistance? Did mixed-income developments or vouchers improve self-sufficiency in comparison to housing projects? Did the benefits of mixed-income revitalization exceed the cost? Finally, did the performance of elementary kids improve if their families had access to vouchers or lived in mixed-income developments? Next, I was asked to describe the transformation efforts in Atlanta. Between 1995 and 2007, Atlanta fully constructed 13 mixed-income developments, more than any other housing authority in the country. In 1995, Atlanta provided housing assistance to over 16,000 families, 47 percent of whom lived in public housing projects, and 33 percent of whom used the vouchers. By 2007, Atlanta provided housing assistance to over 17,000 families, 15 percent of whom lived in public housing projects, and 59 percent of whom used vouchers. And then, another 90 percent lived in mixed-income developments and I am leaving aside in those percentages the elderly families. What are the re-screening policies of AHA and what percentage of original public housing residents moved back into the redeveloped communities? Madam Chairwoman, I cannot speak authoritatively on the re-screening policies. I do know that those policies, those re-screening processes were handled by private development companies, and I would have to defer to the management of the authority in regards to a more authoritative answer to that. But with regard to the second question that I have examined in detail, my research found that in Atlanta, 21.4 percent of the still-active original families moved back into mixed-income developments, and about 61 percent used vouchers. I have also found through numerous focus group interviews that the large percentage of families who remain on vouchers do so primarily by choice. My statistical research in Atlanta also found that mixed-income revitalization did not cause families to lose housing assistance. The next question I was asked is in what way have I updated my 2005 article that was published in the Journal of the American Planning Association. And I would simply say that I conducted a number of updates to that study, including extending it over a period of time. I have added a study of Chicago. I have looked at issues of the association between voucher locations and crime. I have done cost-benefit analyses, and so on. The most important update has been the addition of the Chicago Housing Authority that was funded by a grant from the McArthur Foundation, and that is a 300-page report that is currently undergoing peer review. Here are the findings: First, I found that families who relocated--and this is specifically with respect to Atlanta--from public housing projects moved to much better neighborhoods. We looked at 16 community metrics to evaluate that. Second, we found that the employment rates of work eligible adults increased from 21 percent in 1995, when most families lived in public housing projects, to an average of 53 percent in 2007, when most families had moved away from those projects. And we tracked families longitudinally. On nationally standardized tests we found that: kids whose families lived in housing projects scored very low, in the 29th percentile nationally; those whose families used vouchers scored slightly higher, in the 35th percentile nationally; and those whose families lived in mixed-income developments scored higher, in the 43rd percentile. All of these, of course, are much lower than we would like to see them. And, the most important point is that the vouchers in mixed-income developments provided access to better schools. Violent crime was not significantly correlated with the percentage of families who lived in census tracts. It was, however, highly correlated with the poverty rate in census tracks. And, finally, we found that the net social benefit of revitalizing 6 public housing projects in Atlanta was $125 million per development, our benefit cost ratio of 1.6 to 1. Let me end simply by saying that my research in Atlanta has demonstrated conclusively that the self-sufficiency of low- income families can improve significantly if those families are provided access to quality, affordable housing in neighborhoods where the opportunities for upward mobility are greater. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Dr. Boston can be found on page 38 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Now, we will go to Mr. Cabrera. STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ORLANDO J. CABRERA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL COMMUNITY RENAISSANCE AND OF COUNSEL TO NIXON PEABODY Mr. Cabrera. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Good morning, Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member Capito, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Orlando Cabrera and I wanted to thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and Ranking Member Capito for your invitation to speak this morning. Madam Chairwoman, I ask that my written comments be entered and accepted into the record. Chairwoman Waters. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. Cabrera. In light of present company, I feel compelled to state that I am not an academic. Further, most of my comments are tailored to the world of the PHA, the housing provider. There are some axioms in the world of public housing; and, one of them is that public housing is at a crossroads, and that's because public housing is always at a crossroads. There are pretty basic reasons for that being the case. The first and foremost reason is that our country is always changing. That is no different today. Public housing policy has always been interesting because it's a terrific indicator of where our country is. Public housing was very important to returning veterans during World War II and it's going to be very important to the elderly, right now, frankly, with our aging population. We're going to see demand increased for public housing and more accurately for affordable housing. And one of the very large issues facing the issue of public housing is how we look at housing. Public housing has always been treated as something that is outside of the housing spectrum. It is another theory I disagree with strongly. I think public housing is well within the housing spectrum and needs to be considered within the housing spectrum. Moreover, the focus, I believe, for many housing practitioners is the issue of affordable housing, and, what is the supply of affordable housing? How is that supply helping those who need it most? No place is that reality more acute than in the world of elderly housing; and no place will it be more acute in our lifetimes, I believe, with the state of our aging population. Another large issue for PHAs is the changing nature of our Nation's demographics. Much of our public housing stock was developed at a time when the population center was located in the Northeast. Things are changing remarkably. The modality for housing in the places where it's changing has typically not been public housing. It has been for the last 30-plus years Section 8. So issues that are very important to the Northeast and rightly important, such as public housing and the obsolescence of public housing, are far less important to places in the West than in the South where vouchers are the typical modality for housing people who have the need to be housed. This is going to drive a lot of the conversation, but it begs a big question, which is why we have typically treated public housing in a particular way. We have decided long ago that public housing, and this is not a one-size fits all argument, but public housing is a particular kind of program. The truth is that, from a practitioner's perspective, public housing is one part of a very large spectrum that fits a lot of needs, and that spectrum deals with its needs in different ways in different parts of the country. The driver here is always going to be whether the local government has the flexibility to function in order to address the needs of its particular community. In the Northeast it's going to be different than in West Virginia or in Los Angeles, or for that matter in San Bernardino, which is just 40 miles to the East of Los Angeles. That driver is going to dictate a lot of how we deal with the issue of affordable housing generally and the subset of public housing. Very quickly, there is a tangential issue that I promise you no one--none of my formal professional colleagues at HUD--asked me to do this, but I'm going to do this shamelessly. A big part of trying to determine the future of public housing is probably funding technology at HUD. Public housing is driven by data, and data currently is kept at HUD in ways that would be a technological generation ago--a lot of Excel spreadsheets. There are currently applications that will make the business of keeping data much easier, would serve Congress well, would serve HUD well, would serve PHAs well, and would serve tenants well. I would ask Congress to think about funding a solid, technological platform for HUD to provide that data to all of us, to the American taxpayer, to PHAs, to this Congress, and to tenants. With that, Madam Chairwoman, and Ranking Member Capito, thank you for your time. Thank you for the invitation, and I stand ready to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Cabrera can be found on page 41 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Dr. James Fraser? STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES C. FRASER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN AND ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, PEABODY COLLEGE, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY Mr. Fraser. Good morning, Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Capito, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to testify today. For more than a decade, I have been involved as evaluator in a variety of HOPE VI and mixed-income housing programs around the southeastern United States, I have also been a part of the active community of scholars who share scientific findings with each other. Today, I draw on all of these to testify. One of the most noteworthy aspects of the HOPE VI Program is that it addressed both place-based goals around neighborhood revitalization and people-based goals around economic self- sufficiency, wealth accumulation, and general wellbeing. Among the most important lessons that we have learned from HOPE VI is that any policy utilizing such a dual focus requires as much planning, professionalism, and follow-through to create the enabling conditions for people to move up and out of poverty as it does to change the landscape by building housing and providing increased police patrol. Research shows that HOPE VI has been very successful in most cases in providing decent, affordable housing that is attractive and suits the needs of many low-income families. My own research in Durham, North Carolina, and in Nashville, Tennessee, show that residents are generally very satisfied and appreciate safe, affordable, quality housing. Likewise, research across the country does point to the fact that people who are able to qualify to move back into HOPE VI redevelopments actually do experience a better environment living where there's less crime, whether that be their perceptions or actual police records showing that it is decreased. However, people are not all benefiting equally for two reasons. First, even when stakeholders claim that they equally support place-based goals and people-based goals, the place- based goals typically outpace people-based goals. And, second, HOPE VI has been geared for a specific type of low-income citizen, namely, those who have clear paths in mind to achieve their goals, access to decent paying jobs, relatively few barriers in their way, and they view HOPE VI as providing quality, income stabilized housing as a stepping stone on their journey. But we know the evidence suggests the large majority of people in poverty do not fall into this category. Many low-income families live in isolated poverty with multiple barriers to work and a lack of access to living wage jobs. Indeed, HOPE VI was designed to deal with this issue through the creation of mixed-income communities. But today I would contend there is little, if any, direct evidence, that shows that living in a mixed-income community has actually empowered low-income residents to move toward economic self- sufficiency. Certainly, living and having access to quality affordable housing has helped that, but living near middle-income families has not been shown to do that to-date. These findings have prompted some people to suggest that we are expecting too much out of a program like HOPE VI, that we could do better, or that we should just not expect that people would move up and out of poverty in such a way. But, my research and my review of the literature shows that perhaps part of the issue is that we haven't provided the authority to the people that we're trying to help to actually make decisions about the communities being built. HOPE VI families do have quality housing, but broader achievement around people in place-based goals of neighborhood revitalization and increases in economic status have not been realized. And, if residents through community-based organizations had more control over their homes and neighborhoods as well as the authority to lead and design HOPE VI type neighborhood initiatives, it is likely these goal sets would be addressed in a manner that mirrored the actual needs of the people who are the stakeholders, the low-income residents. It is not my intention to say that public housing authorities are not capable of meeting the goals of HOPE VI. Rather, I suggest that we are asking too much of them. Let them build on their strengths, which are frequently related to developing and managing housing and other physical assets, and let us instead turn to residents and community-based organizations to lead the public, private, and non-private sectors toward the intertwined goals of neighborhood transformation and upward economic momentum for low-income residents. I have assembled policy suggestions that do stem from different research projects, and I'll state a few right now. First, thinking about the choice neighborhoods legislation that will be considered, perhaps entities other than public housing authorities could be considered to be the recipients. Community-based organizations have long-standing relationships with public and private organizations that have a track record of getting things done. The second, in terms of governance of these types of initiatives, residents do much better when they come to a table on equal footing. Too often, I heard stories from HOPE VI where residents were asked to choose paint colors and give their feelings or input about the relocation process. But when it came down to the actual decision-making, they were not at the table. So I concluded that their range of policy suggestions, I suggest around this, that might be able to empower residents to engender greater commitment toward the communities and neighborhoods we're building and create the sustainability we're looking for with the large public investment that is outlayed. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Fraser can be found on page 49 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Dr. Edward Goetz. STATEMENT OF DR. EDWARD G. GOETZ, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS, AND PROFESSOR, URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING, HUBERT H. HUMPHREY INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA Mr. Goetz. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to provide this testimony today. As Dr. Fraser noted, the HOPE VI Program is designed to create two general types of benefits. The first is the community-wide benefits. It is envisioned that HOPE VI redevelopment will result in an increase in property values, attraction of greater levels of private sector investment, an improved neighborhood environment, a reduction in crime, and so on. The program is also designed to provide individual level benefits for the residents of the public housing. The idea here is that by relocating the better neighborhoods while moving into the finished redevelopment that these residents will have a reduced fear of crime and reduced risk of victimization. They may even experience increased physical health, mental health, and will achieve greater economic self-sufficiency. The academic research to-date shows a fair amount of success, an impressive amount of success on the first of these objectives, these community-wide benefits. Studies across the country have shown that crime is reduced in neighborhoods that have undergone HOPE VI transformation, unemployment drops, incomes in the neighborhood rise. poverty declines, there is an overall increase in the level of education in the neighborhood, and property values increase. The only caveat to these generally very positive outcomes is that most of them are dependent upon population turnover. That is income is increased in the neighborhood and levels of education increase, not because the existing residents have improved their lot, but because those residents have been replaced by more highly-educated and higher-income people. At the individual level, the research is much more mixed and the evidence of benefits to individuals is much more modest. On the positive side, virtually all studies show consistent and strong benefits in the form of a reduced fear of crime. Residents report less evidence of social disorder. They report higher satisfaction with housing conditions, with the exception of cost in most cases. But, otherwise, the evidence is really quite mixed. There is the predominance of evidence shows no demonstrated benefits on employment, on earnings, on economic self-sufficiency. In fact, there is even evidence of greater economic insecurity among families who are displaced through HOPE VI redevelopment. There is no consistent evidence of health improvements. This comes from the largest study in this respect is the Urban Institute's five-city panel study. There is no consistent evidence of school-related benefits for children. There are mixed findings related to neighborhood satisfaction. Some residents are more satisfied in their new neighborhoods. Some are less satisfied. Some residents are more satisfied with certain dimensions of their new neighborhood and less satisfied with others. There are significant and consistent findings, however, that displacement through HOPE VI disrupts the social networks and the social support systems of lower-income public housing families. They experience, and their children tend to report, greater levels of social isolation, fewer interactions with neighbors in their new neighborhoods, a loss of a sense of community, and damage to the overall social capital. These limited individual benefits are problematic in and of themselves. I think they are more problematic because of my current research, which shows that HOPE VI and public housing demolition in general tend to target projects with disproportionately high percentages of African-American residents in them. So my recommendations going forward, these results I think suggest a number of different changes in direction. The first would be to stop further demolition of public housing. As you noted in your opening remarks, HUD has demolished close to 200,000 units of public housing over the last 15 to 20 years. That's more than twice the number of units that the Commission that led to the creation of HOPE VI identified as being severely distressed. As we continue to tear down public housing through HOPE VI, we tend to tear down units and projects that are more and more functional over time, and this is reflected in the evidence of residents who are asked whether they want to move, the majority of whom say no. I would also suggest that given the positive outcomes of the physical redevelopment in HOPE VI neighborhoods that we have perhaps come upon a good model for building more affordable housing. So far from continuing to tear down public housing, we should use the lessons of HOPE VI to actually expand public housing. We can build it in a mixed-finance and a mixed-income manner, and we can be expanding the stock of affordable housing. The demand for it, of course, still exists. Any redevelopment policies going forward should limit displacement of families to all extent possible. This means favoring rehabilitation over demolition. It means phased redevelopment. It means building replacement housing before demolition takes place and then, finally, for a percentage of residents of public housing, the evidence shows those who benefit the most from voluntary, enforced displacement are those who wanted to move in the first place. And so Federal policy should maintain an option for people who want to move out of public housing. Voluntary mobility programs like Moving to Opportunity should be continued and expanded in order to provide that opportunity.

HARRIS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, DIVISION OF PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT ADMINISTRATION, SCHOOL OF URBAN AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS Ms. Harris. Good morning, Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Capito, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Based on my research experiences, this testimony addresses the questions posed in the invitation letter I received for this hearing. I have submitted a more lengthy written testimony to the subcommittee, but here I'll focus on describing the case management system in Memphis and lessons for future policy. Case management to help new residents toward employment and economic self-sufficiency is a key part of the HOPE VI Program, typically by referring residents to existing community programs. In the past few years, there has been a tremendous evolution in this case management system used in Memphis based on experiences with two early HOPE VI grants they received. While these early grants maintain compliance with HOPE VI guidelines, they did not achieve the desired change of significant progress toward economic self-sufficiency for many residents, which was the ultimate goal. By the time the Memphis Housing Authority received its third and fourth HOPE VI grants in 2002 and 2005, there were local stakeholders, including the Housing Authority, who saw that there needed to be a more structured, intensive, and comprehensive case management system in place to help households move toward self-sufficiency. The most important stakeholder to become involved in the HOPE VI redevelopment efforts was the Women's Foundation for Greater Memphis, who made a financial commitment of $7.2 million to support the entire case management program for these 2 cities for 5 years for approximately 600 families. During this time, the Memphis Housing Authority identified urban strategies as a key partner in providing technical assistance to this case management program, helping plan and coordinate community development programs. In 2006, Urban Strategies, the Memphis Housing Authority, and the Women's Foundation together agreed to the creation of a new nonprofit called Memphis HOPE, which is now the entity responsible for case management for HOPE VI residents. One key lesson from much HOPE VI research has been that many adults need far more than referrals to job training programs or encouragement in order to get a job. In my written testimony, I describe three key barriers that public housing residents in Memphis and elsewhere face when trying to improve their economic situation: low levels of education and literacy problems; health problems that are undiagnosed, not managed well, or do not meet Federal guidelines as disabilities in order to receive assistance; and a lack of personal or accessible public transportation. In thinking about the lessons from HOPE VI, there are five issues that should be considered in crafting future Federal policy for public housing residents and other very poor households. First, in programs like this, identify a strong intermediary who will advocate throughout the local community for the needs of this client population in the redeveloping neighborhood. In Memphis, the Women's Foundation and local foundations have made a commitment to see long-term change, continually asking for evidence of change and plans for sustainability after the initial 5-year case management period ends. Many in the local community now view this Memphis HOPE model as an incubator for creative ideas about how to affect real change for poor households. Second, following on this first point, figure out how to work around the program funding silos which make comprehensive case management and redevelopment efforts difficult. In Memphis, the local funding through the efforts of the Women's Foundation and the creation of this third-party nonprofit have made it possible to react quickly to create programs as they identify program gaps for their case load. Third, ensure that the program starts to make plans early on to figure out how case management will be sustainable for HOPE VI clients wherever they live. In particular, the presence or absence of case management services may affect the long-term viability of these newly developed mixed-income HOPE VI sites. For example, at one of the earlier HOPE VI sites that is now mostly redeveloped, property managers have reported that in the last year since HOPE VI case management stopped there, there has been an increase in the number of public housing residents losing their jobs and facing eviction. There is concern at this site and others that particularly during the current economic climate, more residents will lose employment and face some more circumstances. There is a need for ongoing case management if this vision of creating mixed-income communities where public housing residents live is to be truly viable. Fourth, make sure that grantees are realistic from the start about the goals for their client population, by understanding the depth of literacy problems, mental and physical health problems, and other barriers to employment and self-sufficiency. After more than a decade of Welfare to Work era efforts, including HOPE VI case management, there is a much better understanding about the types of issues to look for and plan for. Finally, encourage grant recipients to capitalize on creative approaches to identify local partnerships for client employment. I go into more detail in my written testimony about this, using a very innovative approach. They work to create individual relationships with both large and small area employers to help open doors for clients who are qualified for work. They have chosen to target opportunities where clients might move ahead and ultimately become economically self- sufficient, rather than merely focusing on quickly locating minimum wage service sector jobs. These recommendations suggest that both the system of service delivery and the content of those services should be examined to ensure that programs can be as efficient as possible in helping move poor individuals toward economic self-sufficiency as appropriate. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Harris can be found on page 77 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Mr. Jones? STATEMENT OF DAVID R. JONES, ESQ., PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COMMUNITY SERVICE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK Mr. Jones. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and honorable members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify on the future of public housing, particularly in regard to the New York City Housing Authority's (NYCHA) implementation of something called Section 3 of the 1968 Housing Act, which requires that HUD funds be used to maximize job and training opportunities for low-income residents. My organization, the Community Service Society, has long been concerned about the scale and effectiveness of local Section 3 efforts by the New York City Housing Authority. As a more than 160-year-old organization, we were one of the first to address urban poverty in America. We founded the Columbia of Social Work, and for those visiting New York, the first public baths. But our work recently has focused on labor force issues in New York, particularly concerning black males and disconnected youth. To place New York's experience in context, it should be noted that the New York City Housing Authority runs the largest and reputedly one of the best housing authorities in the Nation. It serves over 180,000 households in 340 developments across the 5 Boroughs of the City. With a resident population in that complex of 500,000, its size comes closer to matching some major cities in America and it represents, I think, somewhat over a quarter of the total population of residents in public housing. In contrast to other areas, low-income families are desperate to get into public housing in New York. We have a waiting list that well exceeds 100,000 and waits as long as 9 years are not uncommon for people waiting to get in. NYCHA receives more than $1 billion in HUD funds each year, which are spent on management operations and capital improvements. And, this year, NYCHA has already received 423 million additional economic and stimulus funds, which opens up further opportunities. In short, NYCHA is a major economic engine within the City of New York and we have a good reason to expect Section 3 efforts to be significant. But, we find it falls short of providing economic opportunity to residents at a size comparable to the expenditure. In our latest housing policy report that we have submitted to the committee making the connection, economic opportunity for public housing residents, we find that only 51 percent of NYCHA's 231,000 working age residents participated in the labor force in 2005. Another 13 percent were engaged in school or training. We estimate at present, and this is probably a low estimate, that between 20- and 30,000 residents are unemployed, and now actively seeking work in a recession. Our economy can serve the worse since the Great Depression of the 1930's. We have some reason to believe from our experts that unemployment rates for Blacks and Latinos in New York may well top-out in 2011, somewhere in the vicinity of 20 percent. So we're coming into an enormously bad time. Most in the Housing Authority in New York are Black and Latino women--62 percent--many under age 24; or Black and Latino men between 18 and 34. Over a third don't have high school diplomas. As our report indicates, the Authority's Section 3 effort is ridiculously small compared to the number of potential jobseekers in NYCHA communities. For that reason, CSS supports the Earnings and Living Opportunities Act being drafted by Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, because it will strengthen existing Section 3 provisions in several ways. It accords, first, hiring-training priorities to residents in developments where head funds are being expended and then to those in the broader community around those developments. It essentially incentivizes and makes it possible for residents to watch as enormous investment goes on in their community and sit around; and none of those jobs are available. This becomes an intolerable situation. It provides a private right of action that enables aggrieved parties to take legal action against agencies or contractors, and New York, as you may be aware, has a long history of discriminatory behavior in the trades. It sharpens the requirements for hiring and training for agencies and contractors receiving HUD funds. It creates a Section 3 office within the Office of the HUD Secretary, and it increases local accountability. Moreover, we urge congressional drafters to incorporate real incentives for housing authorities to intensify Section 3 efforts. The proposed legislation speaks to performance incentives that can be instituted by the HUD Secretary. I'll close there. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jones can be found on page 88 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Mr. Joseph. STATEMENT OF DR. MARK L. JOSEPH, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, MANDEL SCHOOL OF APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCES, CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY Mr. Joseph. Madam Chairwoman, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to speak before you today. Secretary Donovan has said that building communities in a more integrated and inclusive way is essential to advancing social and economic justice in America. The HOPE VI Program, as we have already heard, has had some impressive successes and also faces some deep challenges. The Choice Neighborhoods initiative has great promise as a new phase of poverty deconcentration, but as best I can tell, it also has the potential to repeat or overlook some of the key shortcomings with the HOPE VI Program. Along with collaborators at the University of Chicago, one of whom--Amy Khare--sits behind me today at the hearing. My research is focused at the ground level of the massive public housing transformation currently underway in Chicago. Our research has included in-depth interviews with almost 200 residents and 75 other stakeholders; and almost 300 observations of internal meetings and community activities. I want to make just two main points this morning about what we are learning about mixed-income development in Chicago. First we have identified some of the early benefits that residents have experienced, but also some important downsides to what is happening to them. Second, successful mixed-income development is more complicated than anticipated, and I will propose six key success factors that should be considered. So one of my early resident experiences in mixed-income developments, on the very positive side, there have been high levels of resident satisfaction with the new physical environment. Public housing residents never thought they would get to live in such high-quality housing. My written testimony includes quotes, so you hear in residents' own voices about all of these findings I am going to talk about. Also positive, there have been self-reported psychological benefits. Some report a decrease in the stress that they feel, not having to deal with violence and crime. Some particularly increased aspirations, feeling that they are more motivated to accomplish more in their lives now that they have had this housing opportunity. But, on the other hand, there are residents who report an increase in stress. For some, the strict rules and monitoring in the new developments generate stress, and, some have told us that they feel there are double standards that are applied to them versus the other residents of the developments. For some, there's an increased sense of stigma within the new development. Residents feel stereotyped by their new neighbors because of where they used to live. There are low levels of social interaction among the residents. Some residents are disappointed with the lack of a sense of community. Others welcome the privacy in the new developments, but there's a considerable amount of self-isolation--residents withdrawing and really keeping to themselves. And this was not the intention of HOPE VI. There have also been some tensions and negative interactions among residents driven by underlying us versus them dynamics. These issues include an absence of shared norms and concerns about social control. Let me use my remaining time then to suggest six possible key factors for success: Number one: balancing screening with inclusion: Which low- income residents will get to return on-site to benefit from the revitalization? The key will be how to screen-out those residents who may create problems for everyone while screening in as many residents as possible, who could make the most of the opportunity. Second, property management: It is clear that high quality property management is critical to a successful development. But less obvious is the potential for property managers to either be central players in the positive community building process; or, to detract from it by imposing their own prejudices and differential treatment of residents. Third, support services: Housing relocation alone will not change residents' economic circumstances. There need to be both pre and post occupancy supports; and, not just work supports and incentives, but social services as well; and these services must be sustained well beyond move in. So that's where there's a need for long-term funding, service infrastructure and service integration. Fourth, physical design: Units should be externally indistinguishable, but also physically integrated on the site. And the design should include common space, green space, and shared amenities. This is need to promote and shape social relations; but, we must anticipate that it will be contested space, raising issues of turf, of norms of behavior and of informal social control. Next, resident engagement and community building: Given the extreme income and racial diversity in these sites, social connections will not happen naturally. There must be ways to identify shared interest and common ground, or else perceived and real differences will drive social relations. And, finally, governance and decisionmaking: In the Chicago developments, the condo associations are the sole, formal the decisionmaking body; and, they exclude all renters. The local advisory counsels have been disbanded, thus creating tension and increasing divisions. There need to be inclusive governance bodies, where all residents can be represented and have a voice in their community. I'll end there. I have not had time to address the impact of the current housing market crisis on mixed-income development, and can take that up later if there's interest. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Joseph can be found on page 94 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Dr. Popkin. STATEMENT OF DR. SUSAN J. POPKIN, DIRECTOR, PROGRAM ON NEIGHBORHOODS AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT, THE URBAN INSTITUTE Ms. Popkin. Thank you, Chairwoman Waters, and honorable members of the subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to appear here today. For the past decade, I have been studying the impact of the HOPE VI Program on the original residents of public housing targeted for redevelopment. While most of my research is focused on Chicago, which had more distressed public housing than any other city, I have conducted research in 15 HOPE VI sites across the country. My remarks today draw from two major studies: the HOPE VI Panel Study, which tracked residents from five sites across the country from 2001 to 2005; and the Chicago Family Case Management Demonstration, which began in 2006. HOPE VI was a key element of a bold effort to transform distressed public housing communities and demonstrate that housing programs could produce good results for residents and communities. Evidence from The Urban Institute's Hope VI Panel Study, the most comprehensive study of resident outcomes, shows that many former residents have received vouchers or moved into fixed-income developments, and now live in better housing, in less-poor, dramatically safer neighborhoods. And as Dr. Goetz said, we see the same finding in virtually every study that has been done on relocation. However, despite these very real gains, our research shows that the program has not been a solution for those hard-to-house families who suffered the worst consequences of distressed public housing. If Choice Neighborhoods is to be more successful than its predecessor in meeting the needs of the most vulnerable, the initiative must incorporate strategies that effectively address their needs. Hard-to-house residents are long-term public housing residents who are coping with multiple, complex problems, such as mental illness, severe physical illness or disability, substance abuse, large numbers of young children, grandparents raising young children, low levels of education, weak labor market histories, and criminal records. Our analysis from the data from the Hope VI Panel Study estimated the proportion of families falling into one of these categories ranges from 37 percent in 3 smaller cities to 62 percent in the 2 larger cities, in Chicago and Washington, D.C. In 2005, we found that the follow-up, that every site these hard-to-house families were more likely to end up in traditional public housing than to have received vouchers who have moved into mixed-income housing. Placing them in other traditional developments may well have kept them from being homeless, but clearly we need better solutions for vulnerable residents than simply moving them to other developments, which may well become as or even more distressed than the developments where these families started. The Chicago Family Case Management demonstration provides one model for serving the needs of the most vulnerable public and assisted housing families. The Demonstration, the partnership of The Urban Institute, the Chicago Housing Authority, and Heartland Human Care Services, serves residents from two CHA developments and provides these families with intensive family case management services, long-term support, enhanced relocation services, workforce strategies for those who have barriers to employment, and financial literacy training. The ultimate goal of these services is to help these families maintain safe and stable housing, whether in traditional public housing in the private market with a voucher or in a new, mixed-income development. The project is now in its third year, and has achieved impressive interim outcomes, including engagement rates of 90 percent; and, successfully adapting the model from one that provides place-based services to one that follows residence post-relocation. We have used the data from the demonstration to create a resident typology to develop criteria for targeting services effectively. Our analysis divides the demonstration population, all long-term, extremely poor, African-American residents, into three distinct groups based on characteristics, each needing a different kind of service approach. What we call the ``Striving Group'' has their high school diplomas. They are connected to the labor market, even if they are cycling in and out of low- wage jobs, and most significantly they are in good physical and mental health. These are the residents most likely to benefit from relocation with vouchers or to mixed-income developments. Their biggest problem is that they have lived in public housing for more than 20 years. They will continue to need light-touch support to ensure that they are able to maintain the gains they made in leaving distressed public housing, including long-term follow-up, employment and financial literacy services, and perhaps second mover counseling to help them make subsequent moves to even less poor neighborhoods that offer greater opportunities for them and their children. In contrast, the group we're calling ``Aging and Distressed'' have stark physical and mental health challenges, and are unlikely to move toward self-sufficiency. In addition to having very fragile health status, most have not worked in decades, and are truly disconnected from the labor market and the world outside public housing. A better approach for these extremely vulnerable residents is to focus on harm reduction; essentially, helping them remain stable and avoid becoming either homeless or ending up in nursing homes. And since many of them still have children in the household, to keep those children from ending up in the child welfare system. For example, a strategy might be to convert some traditional senior housing into an assisted living model that provides sufficient care, meals, housekeeping activities, healthcare and case management, to help these frail residents remaining in the community. To accommodate the needs in the public housing population, the service would need to be available to residents well under the age of 60, so not just to elderly who suffer from major and physical disabilities. Finally, the group we're calling ``High Risk'' residents share characteristics with both the ``Striving'' and ``Aging and Distressed'' groups. Like the ``Striving Group,'' they generally are younger and have children in the household; and, like the ``Striving Group,'' the vast majority of these residents indicated they didn't want to remain in traditional public housing. But they have very low levels of education and literacy. They are disconnected from the labor force. And, further, while they are not yet as frail as the ``Aging Distressed Group,'' they already have serious physical and mental health challenges with high rates of poor health, depression, anxiety, obesity, and substance abuse. With their multiple challenges ``High Risk'' families are the group for whom intensive case management models and permanent, supportive housing are most likely to pay off in terms of keeping them out of the homeless, child welfare, and criminal justice systems. Assisting them to achieve their housing goals for vouchers or mixed income, and helping them move towards self-sufficiency. In conclusion, with its proposed Choice Neighborhoods initiative, the Obama Administration has the opportunity to build on nearly 2 decades of experience with HOPE VI. Incorporating intensive case management and permanent supportive housing for the most vulnerable into Choice Neighborhoods or any other comprehensive redevelopment efforts is one way to ensure these initiatives truly meet the needs of all public housing families. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Popkin can be found on page 117 of the appendix.] Chairwoman Waters. Thank you all very much for your testimony here today. I would now like to recognize myself for 5 minutes to try to raise some questions about some of what I have heard. Let me ask Dr. Boston, would you describe the case management services that have been received by those clients who have been moved out of public housing or even those who remain in mixed-use HOPE VI projects? What kind of case management do they get? Mr. Boston. Each family who is relocated has an individual case manager. That family is assigned a person and that person works with an individual on a one-on-one basis, so that if it is an issue of relocation or if it is an issue of attempting to find housing, if they have to move from one location to another, they have that. There's also a very extensive program of training, both in terms of workforce development as well as educational training and other kinds of programs. Chairwoman Waters. Are the case managers social workers? Are they individuals who are hired to connect with community resources rather than do the kind of social work that deals with the whole person and the whole family? Mr. Boston. They are a combination of both, and they do. Chairwoman Waters. Do you have professional social workers who are doing this work? Mr. Boston. The individuals are not professional social workers, but they are individuals who are very familiar with the problems that families have encountered and they have a variety of strategies to assist those families in addressing those problems. Chairwoman Waters. The residents who are given Section 8 vouchers, and I think you described something like 61,000 of those, I'll go back and take a look, had they been tracked? Do you know why they are? Mr. Boston. Yes, I do. Chairwoman Waters. Where are they? Mr. Boston. The residents who have Section 8 vouchers have moved in a variety of locations. They have roughly of those who have Section 8 vouchers about 20 percent live in suburban communities outside of Atlanta and the remainder live in various communities within the City of Atlanta. Most of those residents are in the southern part of the city, but more recently with the growing use of project-based rental assistance, which allows the location of housing assistance throughout the City, there are a number of families who have moved in all locations of the City, including some of the wealthiest neighborhoods. Chairwoman Waters. So what you are telling me is your research is such that you have traced all of those and you know where they are and that none are concentrated in the poor census tracks? Mr. Boston. No. I am not saying that none are concentrated, but I can tell you definitively that I have traced every one of the families; and, we have what we call a metric, a community attribute index that includes 16 variables. And we have geocoded that index to the address of every family and we have tracked those families' movements from year-to-year between 1995 and 2007. Chairwoman Waters. How do you account for the growing homelessness in Atlanta? I was recently there over by Five Points and Woodruff Park, and there were hundreds of people being fed. And when I went back in the evening I saw what appeared to be thousands. Who are those people, and are any of those former residents of public housing? Has the homelessness increased in Atlanta? Mr. Boston. Homelessness has increased, but I cannot say the increase is due to any policies of the Atlanta Housing Authority. In fact, as the initial part of my research, I spent a great deal of time setting up a research designed specifically to determine whether or not the housing policies, particularly in regards to mixed-income development, was causing families to lose housing assistance at a rate that would not be expected otherwise, and I found that was not the case. Atlanta has had, up until the recent housing crisis, a serious problem of housing affordability; and it had created a tremendous strain for families, both working families as well as housing assisted families, low-income families, without jobs. Chairwoman Waters. Well, you had waiting list for housing assistance in 2001 with over 24,000 individuals on it. So are you suggesting that even with the Section 8 vouchers that you put out into the overall Atlanta area and the waiting list, that there was plenty of room for these Section 8 vouchers, plenty of units that could be utilized by the displaced tenants? Mr. Boston. The families who have been relocated, and in addition to tracking records, I have conducted over 20 focus groups, and each focus group has a minimum of 10 families there. And so I have looked at families both qualitatively as well as quantitatively and I can say that those families have been able to find housing in locations throughout the City. And there has not been a problem with families who received housing vouchers finding places to live. Chairwoman Waters. Our records show that as of 2007, of the 5,000 families displaced from public housing, only 332 moved back into mixed-income communities. Does that number sound correct to you? Mr. Boston. That number does not sound correct to me. Chairwoman Waters. What does your research show? About how many moved back? Mr. Boston. Well, yes. As I indicated earlier, my research shows that roughly 20 percent of the families who were living in public housing moved back to public housing, and the issue is complex, because there is a normal year-to-year attrition of families from public housing, and that attrition rate is about 10 percent independent of whether they are involved in mixed- income development. Families move away. Some families are evicted. Some families have health problems, and other problems. And so that's 10 percent across-the-board, so if you take that 10 percent out, which is true of both families affected by mixed- income revitalization and those that aren't, then 20 percent of those remaining who are in public housing moved back into public housing developments. Chairwoman Waters. Someone, and I don't know if it was you who mentioned that the screening process for being able to get back into a HOPE VI project is done by the private developer. Is that true? Mr. Boston. Yes. Chairwoman Waters. Why would private developers be deciding how we spend our government money to house? Mr. Boston. Because that's the way it is done. I'm sorry, Madam Chairwoman, I don't know all of the details of the screening process, so I can't speak authoritatively on that. But I can say simply that the housing authority works with private developers and they outline the criteria that the developers have to follow in providing services to the families, and, there are also certain stipulations in the lease agreement that families sign onto that establish conditions for them occupying those houses. Chairwoman Waters. Mr. Goetz, it sounds as if your research and your information is quite different from Mr. Boston's. You have heard what his research has shown in Atlanta, and it differs somewhat with what you appear to have discovered in your work. Can you tell me about what you have discovered with the ability of those who were living in distressed housing who are transferred into HOPE VI projects--the ability for them to get back in--how was that screening done? Who gets back in and why? Mr. Goetz. Well, I don't know of any studies that have answered that particular question about who gets in and why. I do know that in most cities the screening process is managed by private management firms that are working in the redeveloped site and that they apply screening criteria that are generally much stricter than what had been applied in previous public housing instances. So increased tenant screening criteria is an important reason why so few of the original residents ever get back into the development. Chairwoman Waters. Do you know if the private developers have social workers who are part of that screening who are looking at these individuals, what their needs are and how they possibly could benefit from this redeveloped housing? Are we looking at Atlanta and other areas who are interested in getting people back into HOPE VI projects, who had no problems, who have demonstrated that they already have taken control of their lives and that they are on the path to career development. Are we literally getting rid of the most vulnerable people in those housing projects who need more services and the people who are already on the track to taking control of their lives benefiting from these policies? Is that what we are doing? Mr. Goetz. Well, I do know also that most of the families who are displaced from a HOPE VI project, they do as many of the members of the panel have mentioned: move to better neighborhoods; but that's a relative term. They are moving in most cases from neighborhoods that have 60 percent poverty to neighborhoods that have 30 percent poverty. This still leaves them in neighborhoods that are more than 3 times as poor as the average city neighborhood and more than 4 times as poor as the average metropolitan area neighborhood. They also move to other racially segregated neighborhoods. So those who don't get back into the redeveloped site may have marginally improved their neighborhoods, but they are still in many of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the city. Chairwoman Waters. So, I'm going to move on to my other members, but let me just say that everyone basically concluded that most of the distressed housing projects are occupied by African American and Latino minorities for the most part. And when they are given these Section 8 vouchers that will allow them to move wherever they want to move, they are moving into suburbia and into better communities where they are welcomed by everybody. Is that right? Mr. Goetz. No. Chairwoman Waters. No? Mr. Goetz. No. Chairwoman Waters. Why not? Mr. Goetz. Well-- Chairwoman Waters. In Atlanta, they move wherever they want to move. Mr. Goetz. They are of course restricted by the ability of fair market rents and by the willingness of landlords to accept housing choice vouchers. They are also limited by their knowledge of the housing market and their own preferences for staying in neighborhoods that are neighborhoods that they may be more familiar with or neighborhoods where they had social support networks in place. Chairwoman Waters. Do you think that the poor Census tracks in these cities are impacted by the displaced, Section 8 voucher holders, more than any other sections of these cities? Mr. Goetz. Are you still asking just me? Chairwoman Waters. Yes, just you. [laughter] Mr. Goetz. I asked because I actually haven't researched that particular question, but, given the fact that that's where most of the displaced families conduct their housing searches, it's logical to conclude that it's putting significant pressure on the housing stock in those neighborhoods. Chairwoman Waters. Well, I thank you for that, and the reason I did not ask some of the others was I had an opportunity to meet Mr. Jones up in New York when I held a hearing there just last week, and I know what he has testified to. And both Dr. Harris and Dr. Popkin basically gave testimony today that comports with my experience having worked in public housing. So I just did not ask them additional questions, because, you know, they too like you seem to share some of the knowledge and information that I have, but I wanted to hear a little bit more from you, because you first opened up some of the questions about the success. And everybody said with HOPE VI there is some success, but I appreciate you also identifying the weaknesses along with Dr. Fraser. Thank you very much. With that, I will turn to Mr. Cleaver. Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I understood Mr. Goetz on the same deal, but I want to include Dr. Joseph and Dr. Harris to perhaps get some kind of an academic response as well. When I was Mayor of my City and in charge of public housing, we built the first HOPE VI project in the Nation in Kansas City, Missouri. And if we look at the units today, they still look good. They are well cared for, but I was criticized because all the HOPE VI units are still in the lowest income tracks. But, we have a structural problem, and I don't know how we can get it fixed. I know right now you're going to fix it, because you can answer this question and we are going to solve this problem. I am going to be a hero. Yale University is going to get big grants. Here it is. HUD--Mr. Cabrera may need to get in this as well--will only give a certain amount of money for land acquisition. And it turns out that land acquisition is always less expensive in the low-income tracks. And so if we get dollars for a HOPE VI project, I don't care where the housing authority looks or the mayor looks, it's going to end up in the lower-income tracks, because that's the only affordable land. How do we solve it? I mean, there are some neighborhoods that are exempt. Now, they would probably fight anyway, but their exemption, at least when I was mayor, is based on the fact that I can't buy land there. Mr. Cabrera. Congressman, are you asking? Mr. Cleaver. Well, yes. Mr. Cabrera. Okay. HOPE VI developments happen on property that belongs to the public housing authority that is subject to a declaration of trust and that has units that have annual contributions contracts on them that are going to be demolished. So when the portion of the HOPE grant, and I don't recall that there is an acquisition portion, it might be that they are adding on land around the property that they already own. The first step in HOPE VI is identifying what property the public housing authority has that it wants to deal with in terms of demolition. HOPE VI's purpose, legislative intent to this day, is two-fold. It is to demolish public housing units that are obsolete, because the vast majority of public housing stock is between 50 and 70 years old. Its purpose is to deconcentrate poverty. And its purpose is to build something back, using a bunch of different kinds of financial tools--not just public housing funds. The reason that it worked in Kansas City, the reason it has worked in other cities as well--when it has worked and it has worked mostly--is because the marriage of all those tools have come out with a product that serves a lot of people--not just the demographic--that is occupying the public housing band width. Public housing is a financing mechanism. It essentially is a unit financing mechanism to operate a particular apartment. When you add the other mechanisms, you are serving essentially low-income people, but you may not be serving low-income people who had received a public housing unit. Dr. Popkin illustrated this just a few minutes ago with respect to how it is that folks come back or don't come back. There's always attrition from public housing. One of the reasons that it winds up being the case that HOPE VI deals, as you noted, look better, is because generally the way they are pro forma, the way they are economically modeled, allow for reserves to permit the maintenance of those units. So from an economic perspective, Dr. Boston, I don't know if I missed that, but if I did, please correct me. Mr. Boston. Yes. Congressman, I would like to share my perspective on that, and maybe we can get some grant money coming to Georgia Tech. But it requires a complex of strategies to have a successful community. The fundamental strategy is that you have to focus on the issue the ladders that create the fulfillment of the human potential. And above and beyond bricks and mortar, and anything else, the most important element is having in place policies and strategies that allow families to fulfill their human potential. What does that mean when we talk about neighborhoods? Well, forget about the bricks and mortar. We mean, have we built better schools? Do the children have access to better schools? On average, their mother, typically black, has two kids. Those kids are very young. She is concerned about their safety. Have we addressed issues of crime in the neighborhood through various partnerships with communities that have capabilities of doing so? Have we established an early learning center and do we have new YMCAs or after school programs? Mr. Cleaver. I am going to interrupt you because you're making the point I was trying to make. What we're talking about is trying to completely, socially, and in some cases even morally and physically, rehab an area and that's because the only place we place housing units are in areas like that. I mean why can't we place housing units, whether they are Section 8, whether they are HOPE VI, in areas where, you know, everybody says scatter sites of housing. If people find out that you're going to try to build something, they are going to come and say, I know the whole deal. We will have traffic problems if we build new housing coming in, or we're going to overload the schools. But why can't we have scatter-site housing in neighborhoods where we don't have to go in fighting crime? Mr. Cabrera. It's very expensive, scattered housing. And, Congressman, just a small tweak: The case of Kansas City is different than other cases. So if you go to San Francisco, there is a HOPE VI deal smack down in the middle of North Beach. If you go to Seattle, there is a huge, brand new, beautiful HOPE VI deal in South Seattle, which is now a very vital community. And, if you go to Tacoma, you go to Salishan. It's another example of a place where, again, it's in a vital community. And this is where the local nature has to be brought into consideration. It depends upon the location. It depends upon where you are building. It is a very different situation in Kansas City, perhaps, than it is in Seattle. And I think that's part as it is in Atlanta for that matter. So I think that's part of the stress there. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Mr. Green? Mr. Green. Thank you Madam Chairwoman, and I thank both you and the ranking member for the work that you have done in affordable housing, especially with the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which I hope will in time help us with a good many of the problems that we are contending with currently. I also thank you for the assemblage of witnesses that we have today, all of whom have great credentials, and I thank you for your testimony. My first question, and it's to anyone who would care to respond, and if you can be terse, it would be appreciated. Why do we need brick and mortar as opposed to just having vouchers? There are many who contend, why have a building that we have to manage? Why not just have all vouchers? Mr. Goetz. The most prominent answer to that would be that in some cities with very tight housing markets, Housing Choice vouchers are extremely difficult for tenants to use. They face tremendous competition in the rental market, and given the choice, landlords tend to prefer residents who don't have vouchers and Section 8 certificates to those who do. And so in some hot real estate markets that characterize many American cities, Housing Choice vouchers are about as good as confederate money. Mr. Green. Moving to another question, and thank you. We have lost about 50,000 public housing units because of the HOPE VI revitalization program. Is that a fair statement? If I have made an unfair statement, somebody please correct me. Mr. Cabrera. We have demolished 110,000 units through the HOPE VI Program, if I recall. Mr. Green. Now, if the purpose of the Program was to revitalize severely distressed public housing, has HOPE VI in some fashion been less than HOPE VI, maybe HOPE V? Mr. Cabrera. There was a HOPE V, you know. There is HOPE I through V. Mr. Green. Yes, well. Mr. Cabrera. HOPE VI has been successful in places where the local government has the capacity to move it forward. It has struggled in places where that might have been a challenge. I would take, you know, without at all trying to appear disagreeable, I would disagree with Dr. Goetz. In those places that allocate Section 8 vouchers, what you'll find is utilization rates that are bordering 98 percent, and they tend to be very dense areas of the country. The places where you see Section 8 probably struggle a bit, are in places that have housing authorities in suburban areas or housing authorities in rural areas. Rural areas drive a lot of the Section 8 voucher underutilization. The second largest housing authority in this country is not on the mainland. It's in Puerto Rico. It has more units than Los Angeles. It has more vouchers, I believe, than Chicago. Mr. Green. I am going to have to ask you to wrap up. I have about four more questions. Mr. Cabrera. No, sure. I'm sorry. And so my point is, it's more a balance of understanding what the demand is in the city. Mr. Green. And I'll give you a chance to respond in a moment if I have enough time. But because we don't have one- for-one replacement, and because we have persons who do not return for various and sundry reasons, I have to ask, is HOPE VI being used to evict people from projects who ordinarily might not be evicted? I heard what were called forcible injury and detainer lawsuits in another life, commonly known as evictions. And there were persons who could not be evicted, but my suspicion is if they had a chance to find another way to move persons, this may have been done. So does that happen when you rebuild, reconstruct? Do you lose people who have been deemed undesirable, but who were lawfully eligible to be in the project, the housing unit? Ms. Popkin. May I respond to that? Mr. Green. Go on. Ms. Popkin. Our research has shown that what mostly happens to the most troubled tenants, the undesirable tenants, is they have been moved to other distressed public housing. They have not been evicted in large numbers. They have been pushed somewhere out of the way in a place that I think could become even more distressed than the place they started, because now you have all the troubled families concentrated together. So in the housing authorities I have studied, they have certainly been moved out of where they were, which was often an awful place. But they often feel that where they have gone is a little bit better, but it's certainly not anywhere any of us would think is a good solution. Mr. Green. Madam Chairwoman, may I ask one final question? Chairwoman Waters. Yes. Mr. Green. My final question, thank you, is this. Is public housing in this country at risk because of undocumented workers? Mr. Cabrera. No, Congressman. Public housing is offered to either folks who are legal residents of the United States or U.S. citizens; or, alternatively, children who might have parents who are illegal, but who have an entitlement. Mr. Green. But are you having a real problem? Are you being sued by undocumented workers, lined up outside, demanding that they have units? Mr. Cabrera. No. Mr. Green. Are they protesting outside, saying where is my public housing? Mr. Cabrera. They aren't, Congressman. Mr. Green. I ask because there's a big concern about the takeover, about the undocumented workers just absolutely consuming the public housing stock of this country, and I'm eager to know where this is happening. Have any of you experienced a big takeover because of undocumented workers? Mr. Cabrera. No. No. Mr. Green. Let the record reflect that all heads were indicating a negative in terms of an answer, and I thank you Madam Chairwoman. If we have a second round, I will have more questions. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Our ranking member has returned. Ms. Capito? Mrs. Capito. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I apologize for missing a lot of the testimony, but I am very interested in the questions. Dr. Boston, in your presentation you talked about the influence of different public housing availabilities on the level of achievement for students in testing. And, I think if you go from 29 percent in public housing to 43 percent in the mixed income, that's dramatic. I am not a professional like you all are, but that's a dramatic increase there. But as you said, that's still low, but it's going in the right direction. How much in the future strategy of the best way to put forth public housing are statistics such as this incorporated into reshaping public housing for the future? We are looking at the academic side of the polling--not polling--but the research that you have done. Mr. Boston. Thank you very much for the question. It is increasingly becoming an issue, and, indeed, a growing criteria that is being asked of public housing authorities to consider. That is, how do various policies affect the performance of kids whose families receive housing assistance, so that if you look at the Choice Neighborhoods Program, it's a part of that program. And I think it's an excellent criteria, because fundamentally, those are the kids who in the future will either contribute productively to society or if there is no adequate intervention, unproductively. Mrs. Capito. Does anybody else have a response? Yes, Dr. Joseph? Mr. Joseph. I think it is also important to note though that what Dr. Boston is finding may also be evidence of different populations going into different circumstances. So the group that we see going into mixed-income housing and having these better numbers in terms of achievement may have been actually a higher achievement group in some ways, had they been able to jump through the different hurdles they needed to to get themselves into the new housing versus taking a voucher or making different choices. So part of what we do moving forward to your question is also sort out a little bit how much of this is an actual impact of the different circumstance and how much is driven by different types of families making or being forced or constrained into different choices. Mrs. Capito. Yes, I could see that. I see what you're saying, but I do think as Dr. Boston points out that those children--and I'm sure I'm not telling you something you don't already know, but--those children are probably going to be the children; that, as they grow if they fail to achieve or if they have difficulties--meaning they are going to be the ones who are going to be looking at public housing as an option for them--and then the cycle continues in a way that it makes it difficult to break those cycles. So I think that's good. We do a lot in this committee and subcommittee about different social programs, and counseling programs, housing literacy programs, foreclosure assistance. Well, not foreclosure, obviously, that wouldn't be right, but other educational programs. And can you give me an overview of the utilization of these programs and are they actually achieving what we hope they do achieve? Ms. Popkin. I think that related to the HOPE VI Program, specifically, the case management has very considerably. You heard Dr. Harris talk about Memphis, where it took them a long time to develop a comprehensive case management. I know from Chicago, the City where I'm doing work now, utilization is about 50 percent, generally. Mrs. Capito. About what? Ms. Popkin. 50 percent. Mrs. Capito. 50 percent of the residents are using it or the total program is only used 50 percent of the time? Ms. Popkin. 50 percent of the residents are using it in a demonstration. We are doing it and have been able to increase that to 90 percent, but that takes extra money and more time for the case managers. Mrs. Capito. What would be the best? This might be a dangerous question in some sense, but what would you say is the most effective best program in terms of counseling assistance, whether it's parenting or child skills, or financial literacy or home budgeting? I mean, is there one that kind of stands out above the rest? Ms. Popkin. I think you need all of it, especially. You know, a lot of people have been using distressed public housing, not all public housing, the subset of really troubled public housing, as the housing's last resort. And you're dealing with a population that is very similar to the homeless, and they need comprehensive services--everything you mentioned--parenting, support. And a lot of them are going to need it for a long time. It's not going to go away quickly. Mrs. Capito. Doctor? Ms. Harris. May I say, in Memphis, they do really think. They haven't come up with words like Dr. Popkin described for their typology in Chicago looking at their entire case load. But they really do think about, you know, what are the services appropriate for their elderly and getting them in stable housing, where there's not work as a goal there. And what do they do for people who are officially, technically disabled, who may be able to work a little bit. But a full time job is not feasible for them and helping them find what's appropriate for them. And then there's the whole rest of the case loads. That's the working age adults who may have employment, or may not, that need some further assistance in some way. And it's figuring out for them is their key barrier really getting him hooked up to one more program; you know, a job training program, that's going to move them into a position that would be stable for them; or, is it really getting them into that literacy class and finding childcare and whatever the other issues are. So I think it's so hard to come up with what is the program or what is the most effective, because it's so personalized for small segments of the case load. And I think Memphis has done a good job of looking at that, particularly when it comes to employment, in figuring out small groups to work together with those residents to move toward employment. Mr. Jones. I would just be careful, and not just from an academic vantage point, not to forget that the magnitude of the recession we are in is changing all the rules. If you have whole communities where public housing is set that are losing employment at extraordinary rates, that changes the game entirely. So some of the inventions we're talking about here may not be as effective, because the real question is, can you get people back into the workforce and can you get people in housing authorities, that we see some skills to get back into productive work? So I think there has been a shift here, and some of the fights we have in New York are assuming full employment where people are just holding back. That's not the case here. People are clamoring for work. Mrs. Capito. Thank you. Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much. Mr. Driehaus? Mr. Driehaus. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you for this hearing. I have worked with the housing authority very closely over the last 10 years in Cincinnati, and, with all due respect to Dr. Boston and his comments about the way the voucher system is working, we haven't seen it play out that way in Cincinnati. And I would like to ask any member of the panel about rent reasonableness, because we are running into what I perceive to be a real challenge. The HOPE VI project in Cincinnati has displaced many low- income families, but in addition to the HOPE VI project, there were other very large developments that were also torn down around the same time, which led to a dramatic increase in the voucher population. But where the relocation occurred in many cases was driven not by the housing authority or the policies of the housing authority directly, but by what they were claiming to be the private sector. Well, when we dug into it a little deeper, what we found was that the reimbursement rates for the vouchers in certain neighborhoods, and they tended to be high poverty neighborhoods, so far exceeded the market rate rental that that's where landlords flocked. We are in low- to mixed-income neighborhoods, and, purchase single family homes, there was an additional incentive, a 10 percent bump-up in the voucher if it was a single family home. So we found a lot of investors going in and purchasing single family homes in what were moderate priced neighborhoods. And what we did not find was the type of dispersion, Dr. Boston, that you spoke of in Atlanta. And we found that there was a reconcentration of poverty in essentially the neighborhoods right around where the HOPE VI project was. So we created this kind of artificial mixed-income neighborhood through the HOPE VI project. We took what were mixed-income neighborhoods in the surrounding area, and turned them into low-income neighborhoods. And we have seen the subsequent flight that one often sees when that happens. You know, in addition, these were the same neighborhoods that were impacted by predatory lending and who have felt the brunt of a foreclosure crisis. So at the same time, these neighborhoods are experiencing predatory lending. They have an influx in investors using vouchers, and really tipping the balance in many of these neighborhoods. But it was driven in large part in terms of the voucher side by what the reimbursement rate was for the voucher. How do we get around the rather strict requirements at HUD on rental reimbursements? How do we get more flexibility to the local housing authority to recognize where that disparity exists between the rental reimbursements and the market rate to make that even across- the-board, so we do achieve the type of balance that Dr. Boston spoke of. Mr. Boston. Could I just respond very quickly? Mr. Driehaus. Sure. Mr. Boston. And, again, one of the things Atlanta has done is to create what they call rental submarkets. And, so, rather than applying the same fair market rental standard across the City, whereby you actually constrained to neighborhoods that you can move in and it confines most of the rental opportunities to the lower-income neighborhoods, they have taken the same pool of money and disaggregated it, broken it down into different power, depending upon the cost of housing in different neighborhoods. Mr. Driehaus. The challenge we face is that those runaways can change dramatically from street to street in certain neighborhoods. So when we try to set rental rates by Census track, even, they can be wildly off, depending upon what block you're on. Mr. Boston. Right. Mr. Driehaus. And in many older cities, we find this all the time, that neighborhoods are not homogenous in terms of the housing. But, yet, the Housing Authority finds itself restricted because of what they are being told by HUD. Mr. Cabrera. Congressman, it isn't so much what they are being told by HUD. HUD, when they set rent payment reasonableness standards, now use something called the American Community Survey. And it isn't the perfect tool. Traditionally, it used a lagging indicator built on the Census, which meant your rent standards were being set 2 years behind the date when it would apply. Mr. Driehaus. But by Census track, correct? Mr. Cabrera. It is by Census track, but it's beyond the Census track. It is more a survey beyond what you are describing to me, as I understand it, is a qualified Census"
