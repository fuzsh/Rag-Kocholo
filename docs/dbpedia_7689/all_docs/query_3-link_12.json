        "text": "On November 14, 1861, North Carolina Adjutant General James G. Martin issued his order for all Volunteer regiments to change their numerical designation by adding ten (10) to their existing regiment number. Therefore, while the 7th NC Volunteers were mostly imprisoned, their regiment was to be renamed as the 17th NC Regiment (of State Troops). However, the regiment was not officially re-organized until May 16, 1862, roughly a year after the first volunteer company was commissioned. Since there was a gap between when some were exchanged and the regiment was re-organized, most historians have named this regiment the 17th NC Regiment (2nd Organization).\n\nOriginal Company of 7th NC Volunteers Company Name Company Sorta Became**: Company A Independent Greys 32nd NC Regiment - 1st Company B Company B Hyde County Rifles Company B - Renamed to Stonewall Rifles Company C Tar River Boys Company K Company D Hertford Light Infantry Company C Company E Currituck Atlantic Rifles 56th NC Regiment - Company C Company F Roanoke Guards Company A Company G Hamilton Guards Mustered Out of Service on March, 20, 1862 Company H Morris Guards Company G Company I John Harvey Guards Recreated as an Independent Company from August 1862 until May 1, 1863, then assigned as Company L in this Regiment Company K Confederate Guards Mustered Out of Service on March 26, 1862 Company L State Guards Recreated as an Independent Company from August 1862 until it was Mustered Out of Service on March 4, 1863 New Company - Men from Hertford & Bertie Counties Hertford County Rifles Company D New Company - Men from Martin County No Known Nickname Company E New Company - Men from Granville, Person, & Martin Counties No Known Nickname Company F New Company - Men from Washington & Tyrrell Counties Liberty Guards Company H New Company - Men from Edgecombe County No Known Nickname Company I ** \"Sorta became\" means there was not a wholesale re-enlistment or re-election of the previous officers. Many men did move over, but many were new recruits.\n\nThe17th NC Regiment was re-organized at Camp Mangum near Raleigh, NC on May 16, 1862, with the following officers:\n\nColonel William F. Martin;\n\nLieutenant Colonel John C Lamb;\n\nMajor Thomas H. Sharp;\n\nAdjutant Gilbert Elliott;\n\nSergeant Major Wilson G. Lamb;\n\nA.Q.M., John S. Dancey;\n\nCommissary L. D. Starke;\n\nSurgeon R. K. Speed.\n\nCompany ACaptain William Biggs.\n\nCompany BCaptain James J. Leith.\n\nCompany CCaptain William B. Wise.\n\nCompany DCaptain James M. C. Luke.\n\nCompany ECaptain John L. Swain.\n\nCompany FCaptain George B. Daniel.\n\nCompany GCaptain Thomas J. Norman.\n\nCompany HCaptain Stuart L. Johnston.\n\nCompany ICaptain Augustus J. M. Whitehead.\n\nCompany KCaptain Howard Wiswall, Jr.\n\nCompany LCaptain Lucius J. Johnson.\n\nThe Adjutant of the regiment, Charles Gilbert Elliott, was detailed and under his supervision the iron-clad ram \"Albemarle,\" which contributed so largely to the capture of Plymouth, was constructed. Lt. M. A. Cotton and Lt. Wilson G. Lamb filled his place as Adjutant of the regiment. The 17th NC Regiment was assigned to service in Eastern North Carolina and performed picket duty watching the enemy at New Bern, Washington, and Plymouth. In December of 1862, a detachment from the regiment with a squadron of cavalry from Lt. Col. Stephen B. Evans' regiment (63rd NC Regiment - aka 5th Cavalry) and Moore's Battery, all under Lt. Col. John C. Lamb, captured Plymouth. Another detachment drove the enemy from Washington, NC. Many minor raids and surprises of the enemy's outposts cleverly managed by Capt. William Biggs, Lieutenants Hardison, Grimes, Cotton and others gave indication of what might be expected of the regiment when it should have the opportunity of displaying its fighting qualities.\n\nIn 1863, the 17th NC Regiment was brigaded with the 42nd, 50th, and 66th NC Regiments, and placed under the command of Brig. Gen. James G. Martin (NC), and stationed at Fort Branch in Martin County, Kinston, and Wilmington, and was thoroughly drilled and disciplined by that splendid organizer and disciplinarian.\n\nOn February 2, 1864, the 17th NC Regiment under command of Lt. Col. John C. Lamb, with the 42nd NC Regiment under Col. John E. Brown, Parris' Battery of six (6) guns and a squadron of cavalry under Lt. Col. Jeffords (SC), the whole under command of Brig. Gen. James G. Martin (NC), attacked the enemy's forts at Shepherdsville (town now named Newport). After the capture of their block houses and driving in of their outposts, the command moved upon their forts and entrenchments. The 17th NC Regiment on the right assailed their columns in splendid style and pouring over the works captured their guns and barracks. The brave Capt. James J. Leith of Company B, was killed. The enemy fled in dismay over the river and did not stop until safely under the guns of Fort Macon near the town of Beaufort. Ten (10) pieces of artillery, 78 prisoners and a large quantity of stores were the fruits of this victory. The Atlantic & North Carolina Railroad bridge was burned and the railroad occupied to prevent re-inforcements from Beaufort and Fort Macon being sent to New Bern. Owing to the failure of Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett's (VA) command to capture New Bern, Brig. Gen. Martin's troops were withdrawn the next day. In reference to this battle I quote from the official report of the Federal Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer, commanding at New Bern under date of February 7, 1864:\n\n\"Martin performed his part well.\"\n\nThe great campaign of 1864 was now about to open and the desperate struggle to capture the capital of the Confedacy to begin. Federal Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant crossed the Rapidan River on the 4th of May, with his army of 140,000 men and moved overland upon Richmond. Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, with 30,000 men and a large naval armament, ascended the James River and occupied the Bermuda Hundreds Peninsula, threatening both Richmond and Petersburg. To meet this movement the Confederate forces operating in North Carolina with troops from South Carolina and Georgia were rapidly concentrated at Richmond and Petersburg and placed under General Pierre G.T. Beauregard's (SC) command.\n\nOn the 11th of May, the 17th NC Regiment (1,100 strong) followed by the 42nd and 66th NC Regiments, marched through the streets of Petersburg with their bright bayonets reflecting the morning sunlight to join in the mighty struggle then impending. The 2nd battle of Drewry's Bluff, on the 12th - 16th, resulted in forcing Maj. Gen. Butler back upon his fortified base at Bermuda Hundreds. On May 16th the Confederates were ordered to assault this line of entrenchments. Brig. Gen. James G. Martin's (NC) brigade was upon the extreme Confederate right, and the 17th NC Regiment was Brig. Gen. Martin's right regiment so it devolved upon this regiment to lead the assault. Then its thorough drilling and discipline proved of great value. Emerging from the woods into the open field with unbroken front and without a halt, at double-quick step, its onset was not stopped until the enemy's works were won and the Confederate banner waved in triumph over Maj. Gen. Butler's stronghold. The charge was taken up along the line with equal gallantry and success and Maj. Gen. Butler's Union forces were driven to shelter under the protection of their gunboats in the James River and Appomattox River. Thus the \"bottling up of Butler,\" so graphically detailed by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, was complete. The regiment suffered very heavily in this assault, losing about 175 officers and men killed and wounded. The brave and youthful Lt. Col. John C. Lamb fell mortally wounded upon the enemy's works and died a few days thereafter.\n\nOur fighting commissary, Capt. L. D. Starke, now of Norfolk, VA, is entitled to special notice, having sent his wagons to the rear and joined the boys in the front, and participated in the battle with distinguished bravery. A more gallant soldier never lived.\n\nBy the death of Lt. Col. Lamb, Major Thomas H. Sharp became Lieutenant Colonel, and Captain Lucius J. Johnson of Company L became Major.\n\nA division was created for Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC) composed of the brigades of Brig. Gen. James G. Martin, Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Colquitt (GA), Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood (SC), and Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman (NC), and was ordered to report to General Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania had been fought, and Federal Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in his turning movement had ordered Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's cavalry, supported by Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren's Corps, to seize the heights at New Cold Harbor.\n\n\"Anderson came up on the first of June, with Kershaw's and Hoke's Divisions, and attacking Sheridan drove him back toward Old Cold Harbor, and secured the heights around New Cold Harbor and Gaines's Mill, which he at once proceeded to fortify \" The importance and value of this success can only be realized when it is understood that had Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's order been carried out the Federals would have occupied the ridge, and the Confederates, instead of defending, would have been compelled to assail them, inasmuch as it was the key to the Confederate Capital. The great and decisive battle of Cold Harbor, on June 3, followed these preliminary engagements, and resulted in the bloodiest repulse of the Federals known in the history of the war. The 17th NC Regiment was upon the right of the line, and supported Grandy's (VA) battery. In its front the enemy's dead were so thickly strewn that one could have walked on their bodies its whole extent. In this battle Lt. M. A. Cotten and Private Benjamin Andrews greatly distinguished themselves, bringing into our works the flag of a New York regiment, of Brig. Gen. Robert O. Tyler's (NY) Brigade. The enemy assaulted our lines several times, and during the interval between the assaults, this flag was brought in and temporarily planted upon our works. This incident unquestionably misled the brave Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, who in his official report of the battle claimed that his troops had carried our line, \"having seen through his field glasses the Stars and Stripes floating from the enemy's works.\"\n\nAfter the battle of Cold Harbor Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant transferred his army to the south bank of the Appomattox River and attempted a coup d'etat at Petersburg.\n\nGeneral Robert E. Lee, on June 14th, moved Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Division near Drewry's Bluff, in order that it might be in position to act as reserve for his army or go to the support of General Pierre G.T. Beauregard at Petersburg. The Federals under General Smith had advanced to within a few miles of Petersburg and had swept away all our forces in their front and the city was in imminent danger of capture. The brigades of Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood (SC) and Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Colquitt (GA) had been sent forward by rail and Brig. Gen. James G. Martin (NC) with Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman (NC) was pressing forward by forced marches and arrived after midnight of June 15th and commenced to entrench,\n\nThe Confederates now numbered about 10,000 men behind their hastily entrenched line. The Federal General Smith had been reinforced by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's Corps which came up at noon and raised the Federal forces to 66,000.\n\nThe morning of June 16th was spent in skirmishing and artillery fire. In the afternoon Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, now in command of the Federals, assailed with all his forces and just at sunset broke through Brig. Gen. Henry A. Wise's (VA) lines, whose troops went streaming to the rear. These brave men had fought unceasingly for two (2) days and were much exhausted and only yielded when completely overwhelmed. As many of the men of our division as could be spared were hastily gathered from various points on the line and with the remnant of Brig. Gen. Wise's brigade being organized in a compact body were hurled upon the victorious Federalsthe right wing of the 17th NC Regiment joining in the attack. The Federals were driven out and our line re-established. Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren's Corps had now come up, which increased the Federal army to four corpsnumbering 90,000, and no reinforcements had reached General Pierre G.T. Beauregard from General Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe battle re-opened on June 17th, at noon. Three times were the Federals repulsed but as often resumed the offensive. At dusk on the extreme right our lines were again broken and partially restored by the timely arrival of Brig. Gen. Archibald Gracie's (AL) Brigade, the conflict raging until 11 o'clock.\n\nDuring these engagements General Beauregard's engineers had been at work selecting a line nearer the cityshorter and stronger, being the line afterwards held during the siege. After midnight our troops were withdrawn to this new line. Our skirmishers being left in the old works with instructions to delay the advance of the enemy in order to gain as much time as possible for our troops to fortify the new line. The writer of this had the honor of commanding the skirmishers of his regiment and can testify to their brave and determined resistance, in connection with other commands, which resulted in keeping back the enemy until 3 o'clock p.m. of that day (June 18th).\n\nFortunately about this time Maj. Gen. Charles W. Field's (VA) and Maj. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw's (SC) Divisions of General Lee's army arrived, which swelled the Confederate forces to 20,000 against 90,000 of the enemy's.\n\nAbout 3 p.m. a general and final assault was given. It was urged with as great pertinacity and was resisted with equal determination as those preceding. Before dark it ended in a complete repulse of the Federals along the whole of our front. In these series of engagements the regiment lost many of its most valued officers and brave men. Lieutenants Perry, Hobbs, Pope and others were among the killed.\n\nThe writer would desire to appear not ungrateful to his comrade and friend Lt. William J. Hardison (now Sheriff of Martin County) and at the risk of being personal, wishes to place on record the act of his brave friend, who, at the risk of his own life, sprang over our breastworks during the enemy's last assault and bore his wounded friend in his arms to safety behind them.\n\nI am indebted to Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood's (SC) recent address for much information as to data, etc., of these battles and note with pleasure his closing words: \"I have told the story of Petersburg without comment. The narrative itself is an immortelle and a reverently lay it upon the tomb of Beauregard, the soldier.\"\n\nFoiled in his attempt to carry Petersburg' by storm Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant now laid siege to the city. I cannot better describe the hardships endured by the brave soldiers than to make extracts from the recent address of Captain Elliott.\n\n\"At the beginning of the siege, June 20th, the report of Martin's Brigade occupying Colquitt's salient showed 2,200 men for duty. In September, when they were relieved, the total force was 700, nothing but living skeletons. Occupying the sharp salient, the work was enfiladed on both flanks by direct fire and the mortar shells came incessantly down from above. Every man was detailed every night, either on guard duty or to labor with pick and spade repairing works knocked down during the day. There was no shelter that summer from sun or rain. No food could be cooked there but the scanty provisions were brought in bags on the shoulders of men from the cook yard some miles distant. The rations consisted of one pound of pork and three pounds of meal consisted the meals for three daysno coffee, no sugar, no vegetables, no grog, no tobacco, nothing but the bread and meat. No wonder that the list of officers was reduced to three Captains and a few Lieutenants with but one staff officer, (spared through God's mercy) to this brigade of 700 skeletons. But every feeble body contained an unbroken spirit and after the Fall months came those who had not fallen into their graves or been disabled, returned to their colors and saw them wave in victory in their last fight at Bentonville.\"\n\nIn July their beloved Brigade Commander, Brig. Gen. James G. Martin, was transferred back to North Carolina and Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland (NC) became his successor. Brig. Gen. Martin was greatly beloved by his soldiers. They had the most unbounded confidence in his military skill and admiration for his personal bravery illustrated on every battlefield where they had followed him. In October the brigade was sent to the Richmond front and participated in the minor engagements of Henrico Court House, Charles City Road (aka Fussell's Mill) and others, maintaining its high reputation for bravery.\n\nAdvices having reached General Robert E. Lee of the preparation by the Federals of a land and naval expedition for the capture of Fort Fisher, Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) division was sent to its relief. The 17th NC Regiment and parts of the 42nd and 66th NC Regiments were the advance of the division and reached Wilmington at 1 a.m. on December 24, and, after being lunched at the depot by the patriotic ladies of that city, took up the line of march for Fort Fisher, the 17th NC Regiment bivouacking there on the night of the same day The enemy having effected a landing at Fort Gatling on the ocean side, the regiment was withdrawn from Fort Fisher on the morning of December 25th, and moving down the military road were ordered to attack Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler's troops. Capt. Thomas J. Norman's company in front, supported by the balance of the regiment, deployed as skirmishers, assailed the enemy. Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland (NC) in his official report said:\n\n''Lieutenant Colonel Sharp, 17th NC, pressed close upon and drove their skirmish line back upon their main body, which was covered by the guns of at least thirty men of war lying broadside to the beach. Captain Norman, Company G, deserves special notice.\"\n\nA Lieutenant and ten men were captured. The regiment lost three (3) men killed and twenty (20) wounded in this engagement.\n\nBefore the arrival of the balance of our division, Maj. Gen. Butler had re-embarked his troops and thus ended the powder-ship fiasco and the military career of this modern Falstaffhe being relieved by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nThe ease with which this land and naval attack was repulsed, undoubtedly created in the mind of General Braxton Bragg (TN) an undue feeling of security. Not anticipating a renewal of the attack on Fort Fisher, unfortunately the division was withdrawn to Wilmington.\n\nOn the afternoon of January 13, 1865, whilst the regiments of the division were on dress parade in Wilmington, the enemy had reappeared before Fort Fisher and were landing their forces, and before the division could be transported to Sugar Loaf, the bulk of the Federal forces had landed and, pushing that night across the peninsula, constructed a line of field works from the ocean to the Cape Fear, thus cutting off all land communication between Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Division and Fort Fisher. This line of works was held by a negro division, commanded by General Paine and a white brigade under Col. Joseph C. Abbott, who afterwards misrepresented North Carolina in the United States Senate.\n\nAt 4 o'clock on the afternoon of January 15th, the skirmishers of Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland's (NC) Brigade, which was on the left of our line, under command of 2nd Lt. Wilson G. Lamb, were ordered to drive back the enemy's pickets to enable General Braxton Bragg (LA) and Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke (NC), to make a reconnoissance of the enemy's position. The effort was only partially successful, owing to several of the enemy's ships which were lying close to the shore, having opened a terrible enfilading fire upon our skirmishers so soon as they appeared on the open sand beach; but further to the right where the small undergrowth was some protection, the enemy's skirmish line was driven in and their rifle pits occupied, giving opportunity for an examination of the enemy's position. The writer recalls the calm and heroic bearing of the modest and gallant Maj. Gen. Hoke who withdrew from the reconnoissance with two bullet holes through his coat. For reasons satisfactory, I presume, to General Bragg, no assault was made, notwithstanding at this moment the enemy had withdrawn Col. Abbott's brigade and a portion of Col. Wright's negro brigade to join in the assault upon Fort Fisher, which was then in progress.\n\nThe troops at the time in our front were all negroes and did not number more than 2,500, defending a line of a mile in extent. That evening Fort Fisher after a most gallant defense, surrendered, and the last port of the Confederacy was closed forever.\n\nSeveral small engagements approaching closely to the dignity of battles followed the fall of Fort Fisher, in all of which the enemy were repulsed. The rapid advance of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman from the South made the evacuation of Wilmington a mere question of time and on February 22, Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland's (NC) Brigade, [including the 17th NC Regiment] forming the rear guard of our army, marched sadly and leisurely through the streets of our \"City by the Sea,\" and Wilmington passed under Federal control. Continuing our retreat up the Wilmington & Weldon Railroad, the army, after crossing the North River, halted for the night. The enemy's cavalry pursued up to this point and attempted by sudden dash to prevent the burning of the bridge over the railroad. They were promptly encountered by our rear guard, under the brave Capt. Charles G. Elliott [?], and were repulsed, sustaining heavy loss. The next day the march was resumed and without further fighting the army reached Goldsborough a few days thereafter.\n\nAnd now the closing scenes of the bloody drama of the American Civil War was to be enacted upon the soil of North Carolina. Goldsborough became the objective point of three armies. Federal Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman with 70,000 men was advancing northward. Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield with his army corps of 21,000 raised the Federal forces to 30,000 at Wilmington; and Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox's Division arriving at New Bern increased Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer's command to 15,000. These different Federal armies aggregating 115,000 men, if allowed to concentrate, would make short work of the Confederate forces whose total, including the remnant of Lt. Gen. John B. Hood's (TX) army, did not reach 40,000 men. The hope of successful resistance was indeed forlorn and the only chance of any success was to fight these armies separately.\n\nThe column under Federal Maj. Gen. Cox advancing from New Bern, was encountered near Wyse's Fork near Kinston, NC on the 8th of March, by Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Division, reinforced by the 67th and 68th NC Regiments, and the Junior and Senior Reserves. Leaving, at midnight, their entrenchments along the line of a creek, Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland's, Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood's (SC), and Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Colquitt's (GA) Brigades under the guide of Col. John H. Nethercutt of the 66th NC Regiment, (who was familiar with the country) found themselves at day dawn on the flank and rear of the enemy, and forming line of battle in echelon of brigades, Brig. Gen. Kirkland's leading, burst upon the surprised enemy and drove them in rapid flight to the rear, capturing 1,000 prisoners and 4 pieces of artillery. The enemy had been driven nearly a mile when Federal Maj. Gen. Palmer's Division appeared upon our right flank. The 17th NC Regiment was on our extreme right and its advance having thus become arrested immediately changed front to meet the enemy, and not knowing their force, boldly charged the division and drove back that part of it in our front, wounding their commander, Maj. Gen. Palmer. Finding itself overlapped right and left, it deployed as skirmishers with both wings reversed, and held its position until reinforcements were brought up under the personal command of Maj. Gen. Hoke, and thus had the honor of preventing the flanking of our army. Later a congratulatory order from Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland was read to the regiment on dress parade at Goldsborough complimenting it upon its splendid achievement.\n\nThe enemy proceeded to fortify their position, and on March 10th General Braxton Bragg (TN) sought to employ the same strategy in again attacking the enemy. It was contemplated by reconnoissance in force to develop the enemy's extreme left and renew our turning movement of two days before. Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland's (NC) Brigade was assigned this duty, supported by the other brigades of the division. Our skirmishers were thrown out, supported by the brigade, and engaging the enemy's pickets, drove them rapidly before us. The enemy's works were developed and, not knowing that it was intended that we should not assault, we rushed upon the works under the heaviest fire which we had ever received. Notwithstanding the brigade had lost one-half of its number, it reached the abatis and slashing and held its position until ordered to withdraw. In this assault the heroic Capt. Charles G. Elliott added another gem to the crown of his military fame. The gallant 1st Lt George W. Grimes, distinguished in many battles, had been desperately wounded and became a prisoner.\n\nThis is the only battle in which the 17th NC Regiment was ever repulsed, and even here it felt that if it had received support its colors wrould have been planted upon the enemy's works. Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman having reached Averasborough it became necessary to concentrate all available troops in his front and Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's (NC) Division was withdrawn and sent by rail to Smithfield Depot and marched thence via Smithfield to Bentonville. The army of Maj. Gen. Sherman was moving from Averasborough to Goldsborough, upon two roads running parallel and about ten (10) miles apart. Our division swelled our army to about 15,000 men, against Maj. Gen. Sherman's 70,000. On the morning of the 19th Bvt. Maj. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis's XIV Corps and Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum's Army of Georgia, numbering about 35,000 men were attacked by our troops and driven back a considerable distance, three guns and nine hundred prisoners falling into our hands.\n\nThe other corps of Federal Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army came up and were thrown on our left flank, which had become much advanced in the battle of the previous day. In consequence of this movement it became necessary to change the position of our army. The brigade of Brig. Gen. William W. Kirkland (NC), deployed as skirmishers, held the enemy in check while the entire army changed front, and thereafter occupied a position in the center and joined in the repulse of the many and furious charges of the Federals. In this battle Capt. William Biggs of Company A was greatly distinguished for his intrepid bravery. Our brigade received the special commendation of General Joseph E. Johnston for its valued services in this engagement.\n\nThus closes the volume of the bloody record of the 17th NC Regiment and their brave companions of associated commands.\n\nThe army was withdrawn, retiring through Raleigh and Chapel Hill and was surrendered to Maj. Gen. William G. Sherman at Centre Church in Randolph County, at the final capitulation.\n\nSupplementing this record it would not be amiss to state that the flag of the 17th NC Regiment saved at the surrender by Private Abel Thomas, of Company A, was unfurled at the unveiling of the Confederate monument at Raleigh on 20 May, 1895, and beneath its tattered and bullet-riddled folds the veteran survivors marched to do honor to their dead heroic comrades.\n\n* The above was written by former 2nd Lt.
