        "text": "The Fighting Fourth\n\n4th (Infantry) Battalion, Australian Imperial Force\n\nMass migration from Britain to Australia during the nineteenth and early twentieth century saw many west Walians make the epic three month voyage to the new country. A result of this migration was that many young men from Wales, and also the sons of these men, took up arms for Australia. One of Australia’s most renowned seamen was Commander Joseph Bathurst Beresford, who had been born in Laugharne in 1862. Beresford took command of the Australian Forces that fought against the various German colonies in the Pacific, especially during the now forgotten campaign in Papua New Guinea. Carmarthen man Major Dixon Hearder became one of the most well known Australian officers during the war, also being involved in politics in Australia. As far as can be ascertained, at least 418 Welshmen were killed while serving with the AIF, while at least 1,496 Welshmen served in the famous slouch hat. Countless more sons and daughters of Welsh migrants who were born in Australia would have served and died on top of these numbers.\n\nWith many ties to our cousins in Australia, this section of the website is dedicated to the memory of men who fell during the Great War with just one of the Australian infantry battalions, the one which my Great grandfather fought and died with: the 4th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force (AIF).\n\nIt was researching my Great Grandfather’s exploits during the war with the 4th Battalion, known among its numbers as the Fighting Fourth, which motivated me to embark on researching local war memorials. For this reason, this section of the website is dedicated to the men of this fine fighting unit, who fell in large numbers on the battlefields of Gallipoli and the Western Front.\n\nAfter the outbreak of war in Europe, the colonial governments of Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as our ancient ally, Portugal, pledged to support Britain in her fight against German oppression, and began mobilising their armed forces.\n\nThroughout the states of Australia the call to arms began at once, and dozens of new battalions were formed to create an Australian Imperial Force. The city of Sydney was the centre point for the formation on 17 August 1914 of the 4th Infantry Battalion, which was raised at Randwick Racecourse, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Astley John Onslow Thompson, VD. It may surprise many people to know that there was quite a strong tie to Wales with the 4th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, or Fighting Fourth. The battalions original commander, Lieutenant Colonel Astley John Onslow Thompson, VD (pictured below), was a Carmarthenshire man, from the small mining town of Pontyates and, as well as my Great Grandfather, David Thomas John of Laugharne, at least twelve men of the battalion who fell during the course of the war were from Wales.\n\nIt is beyond the realms of this website to contain a full history of the Fighting Fourth following its formation, but each year of its existence has been broken down in diary form into notable events, which are published here. It is of note that during its existence, the battalion lost over 1,673 men dead, either killed, died of wounds or died of disease, while around 6,634 officers and men passed through its ranks. Compare that to a local battalion, such as the 15th Battalion, Welsh Regiment (Carmarthen Pals), who lost around 670 men dead, and it is plain to see that the Fighting Fourth fought through some tough campaigns, reinforcing Australian claims that they were used as elite troops, to attack the strongest enemy defensive positions.\n\n1914\n\nAugust 17th.
