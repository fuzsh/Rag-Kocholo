The British troops are based in the southern province of Basra, which has become increasingly dangerous in recent months.\n\nOverall, the British are responsible for four Iraqi provinces in the south, although it is planned for the security of the volatile Maysan province to be handed over to Iraqis in the coming months.\n\nOrganisation of the British army\n\nThe corps\n\nThe army is principally divided into more than a dozen different corps, which are a collection of regiments or small groupings of soldiers that share a common area of specialist expertise, such as infantry, artillery, cavalry or even dentistry.\n\nThe regiments\n\nA regiment normally contains of around 650 soldiers depending on its role. Sometimes infantry regiments have more than one unit of this size and are referred to as a battalion. A battalion unit comprises of three or more companies of similar size. A company is made up of two or more platoons, which are around 10 to 12 men strong and commanded by a lieutenant. Guards regiments have operational and ceremonial duties at, for instance, royal residences.\n\nThe brigades\n\nA brigade is a collection of different regiments and supporting units that have been grouped together for a specific purpose. A fighting brigade will traditionally contain infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments together with many supporting cap badges. The composition of each brigade will differ depending on its responsibility but could often contain 5,000 soldiers. A regiment varying in size from a battalion to a number of battalions.\n\nArmy brigades in full:\n\n1 Mechanised brigade\n\n4 Armoured brigade\n\n7th Armoured brigade (Desert Rats)\n\n12 Mechanised brigade\n\n15 (north-east) brigade\n\n16 (air assault) brigade\n\n19 Mechanised brigade\n\n20 Armoured brigade\n\n39 Infantry brigade\n\n42 (north-west) brigade\n\n49 (east) brigade\n\n43 (Wessex) brigade\n\n51 (Scottish) brigade\n\n52 Infantry brigade\n\n102 Logistics brigade\n\n160 brigade\n\nThe divisions\n\nA division would traditionally be made up of three or four brigades depending on the specific role it is to undertake, and is configured in a similar fashion to a brigade but on a larger scale. 1 (UK) division and 3 (UK) division are fighting divisions whereas 2, 4 and 5 division are responsible for administrative support.\n\n1 (UK) Armoured division\n\n2 (UK) division\n\n3 (UK) division\n\n4 (UK) division\n\n5 (UK) division\n\nThe corps of the British army\n\nHousehold Cavalry and Royal Armoured corps\n\nThe Royal Armoured corps (RAC) and Household Cavalry consists of cavalry regiments and the royal tank regiment.

It is equipped with Fuchs reconnaissaince vehicles with some squardons using Challenger 2 tanks. It has some soldiers based permanately in Kuwait, with other positioned in Canada, Cyprus, USA and Thailand. Otherwise based at the RAF base in Honington, Suffolk.

The regiment is currently part of the Desert Rats 7th armoured brigade, and is currently the lead battle group of the Allied Joint Rapid Development Force, which means that its has a mandate to be the first armoured formation deployed in a conflict. It currently has solidiers stationed in Northern Ireland and Canada.\n\nSpecial operations\n\nSpecial Air Service regiment (SAS)\n\nFormed by Captain David Stirling while he was in hospital in the second world war after a parachuting accident, the SAS was initially created as a desert raiding force to weaken Nazi general Erwin Rommel’s North African logistics network, as well as hinder aircraft operations.\n\nOne of their roles as the air troop is to jump out of a plane at 25,000ft and land deep behind enemy lines. The SAS became globally renowned after they dramatically ended a siege at London’s Iranian embassy in 1980 and were later famously sent to Iraq during the Gulf war to search for mobile Scud launchers.\n\nTheir motto, “Who dares wins”, could reflect the rigorous selection process as much as the job, with only 10 out of 125 soldiers surviving the harsh selection proceedure to be awarded the prestigious Winged Dagger beret badge.
