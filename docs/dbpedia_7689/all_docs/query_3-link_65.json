        "text": "Hello Everybody,\n\nThis is my first post, so I apologise in advance if I am posting in the wrong section or should have looked elsewhere.\n\nMy father-in-law has asked me to find out about his fathers time in the war, and what history about this regiment that I can find out.\n\nI have the following facts about the person in question.\n\nRifleman George Wilson 8/19830 17th Regiment Battalion Royal Irish Rifles.\n\nEnlisted 25th September 1914\n\nDemobed 27th February 1917\n\nHe was sent to france at some point.\n\nI have obtained his medical from the nation achieves, which contains various text that I cannot understand. If there is a way to attach it to this post I will if someone can tell me how.\n\nI understand that it is very hard to get information about individuals, but we also want a history of the 17th Battalion as well. My attempts at various google searches has left me very confused, so if anybody can at least point me in the right direction that would be great.\n\nAlso I would like to say that it is great to have a forum such as this, The Great War is an important part of history and should be remembered. I have just recently read the biographies of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch, and they were very good.\n\n1. Was George an Ulsterman?\n\n2. 17th Btn was a training unit from which he would have been posted to a 'line' battalion.\n\nAny details such as where he was from etc would be helpful, quite a few R Ir Rifles followers on forum so you may well be lucky. Key in any of the details you can't understand and let us work withthem.\n\nCheers\n\nDes\n\n(if you go to my Ballymena site below, you will see a link to Ulster Division. Click on and you will find a lot of info about the training etc. His enlistment in September 1914 ties in with the dates when many members of the pre-war Ulster Volunteers joined up on being given the green light by Sir Edward Carson.)\n\nHi,\n\nHe landed in France on the 5th October not the 15th.\n\nThe 5/6th October 1915 is when the bulk of the Ulster Division crossed to France.\n\nFrom the 8 pre-fix on his service number it would indicate 8th [East Belfast] RIR.\n\nIf he didn't join the 8th directly and went into the 17th Reserve first then it is possible that he was not from East Belfast and he was put into them when they needed to increase their numbers.\n\nAs Des has said September 1914 is when the majority of UVf members signed up to go with the Division.\n\nI had a quick look for him on the Ancestry site but no joy yet. Any info off his records may help if you can't upload, ie dates or names of places he was sent to when wounded.\n\nRob\n\nHi,\n\nYes thats what it looks like, he would have joined the 8th in September 1914, served in France with them until wounded and sent back home.\n\nHe would then have gone into the 17th for re-training, but it must have been decided he was not fit enough to be of further use to the army so was discharged. At that time he would have been eligble for the Silver War Badge which he would have to claim.\n\nThis he could then wear to show he'd done his bit! As Des says you can read up about this award.\n\nSo you need to be looking for the 8th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles not the 17th, as there is next to nothing available for the 17th research wise. And he may have only been with the 17th for a matter of weeks.\n\nSome others on the forum have an interest in the 8th.\n\nAs a starter i would recommend looking at Cyril Falls History of the 36th Ulster Division, to which the 8th [East Belfast Volunteers] belonged. Think its available on line.\n\nA battalion is part of a regiment, so the regiment is the Royal Irish Rifles and there were a number of battalions raised during the war in addition to the two regular pre-war battalions that went overseas.\n\nThe long long Trail link explains how each battalion was formed.\n\nRob"
