Thornton (Army Serial Number 36036602), Infantry, Comapny \"A\", 17th Tank Battalion, United States Army, for distinguishing himself by heroic service in connection with military operations against an enemy of the United States on 19 September 1944, in the area of Sillegny, France. Moving forward in advance of the platoon, S Sgt. Thornton and two of his fellow soldiers daringly fought their way past enemy positions into the heavily fortified town of Sillegny. When supporting infantry troops came under intense artillery and machine gun fire, these three men singlehandedly attacked and destroyed mined road blocks and paved the way for the assault. Fearful of bringing fire on their comrades, they permitted enemy tanks to envelop their vanguard positions and be engaged by surprise fire from armored equipment in the rear. Deep in hostile territory they reported the presence of an enemy column, enabling our air forces to attack and destroy it. After supporting troops had poured through the breach made by S Sgt. Thornton and his two fellow soldiers, they rendered conspicuous service in directing the evacuation of the wounded. The action of S Sgt. Thornton in venturing so far forward to break the way for his platoon was an outstanding example of courage and daring, and contributed materially to the achievement of a diffiult objective.\"\n\n4 October 1944 (as S/Sgt.) - Oak-Leaf Cluster to Bronze Star Medal (7AD General Order #105, dated 30 November 1944)\n\n\"Staff Sergeant Delmar G. Thornton (Army Serial Number 36036602), Infantry, United States Army, for distinguishing himself by heroic service in connection with military operations against an enemy of the United States on 4 October 1944, in the area of St. Antonis, Holland. Serving as tank platoon leader in a vigorously contested action southeast of St. Antonis, S Sgt. Thornton came under heavy anti-tank fire. So intense was the barrage that a number of his tanks were disabled and it became necessary for him to withdraw. While stopping his tank to rescue a number of men whose vehicles had been destroyed, S Sgt. Thornton encountered accurate enemy shelling which knocked out his own tank. Quickly reconnoitering the terrain, S Sgt. Thornton plotted an escape route, organized his men, and safely led them back to our lines. His courageous leadership and quick thinking saved a number of skilled tank soldiers from imminent capture.\"\n\nBetween 4 October 1944 and 5 April 1945 - battlefield commission as 2nd Lieutenant\n\n5 April 1945 - Silver Star (7AD General Order #103, dated 23 June 1945)\n\n\"SECOND LIEUTENANT DELMAR G. THORNTON (Army Serial Number O2005589), Infantry, United States Army, for distinguishing himself by gallantry in action on 5 April 1945, in Germany. On the night of 5 April 1945, LIEUTENANT'S platoon was the lead platoon of a company attack on the town of Wilmeringhausen, Germany. When within 500 yards of the town, LIEUTENANT THORNTON discovered the terrain to be far different from that shown on the map and the planned route of attack impossible due to terrain difficulties. The darkness rendered mounted reconnaissance useless and made it imperative that an alternate route be sought on foot. Knowing that one man stood a better chance of escaping detection by the enemy, LIEUTENANT THORNTON instructed his platoon to wait and, alone, set out to seek a route into the town. LIEUTENANT THORNTON evaded detection by great skill and daring and after extensive movement behind the enemy lines, found an approach suitable for tanks on the opposite edge of town. Returning to the tank column, he led them over the route he had covered in an attack that routed the enemy defenders and speedily won the objective with a minimum of casualties. By his heroic and gallant action LIEUTENANT THORNTON enabled the company to seize, consolidate and defend the objective from a strong counter-attack that soon followed. Lieutenant Thornton's performance was in keeping with the highest tradition of the military service.\"\n\nLt.
