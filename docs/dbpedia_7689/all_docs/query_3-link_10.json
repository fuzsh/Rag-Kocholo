        "text": "The 17th Infantry Regiment was initially established on January 11th, 1812, but later merged with the 3rd Infantry and lost its individual identity. However, on May 3rd, 1861, it was reorganized.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the 17th Infantry Regiment served in the Army of the Potomac, specifically in Sykes' Division of the 5th Army Corps. The badge of the 5th Army Corps was a white cross patee, which is depicted in the regiment's coat of arms. This badge is displayed on a blue field above and to the left of the stone wall.\n\nAt the Battle of Fredericksburg, the 17th Infantry Regiment endured significant losses while assaulting the famous stone wall. The soldiers lay flat on their faces for an entire day (December 14th), positioned eighty yards in front of the wall. The enemy, located in large numbers behind the wall, had sharpshooters ready to fire upon any movement from the regiment.\n\nThe five-bastioned fort, depicted on a blue shield above and to the right of the stone wall, represents the badge of the 5th Army Corps during the Cuban campaign in 1898.\n\nThe blue shield below the stone wall features a buffalo, symbolizing the regiment's illustrious history in the Korean War. The nickname \"Buffalo\" was adopted after Colonel William W. \"Buffalo Bill\" Quinn, one of the commanding officers during the Korean War.\n\nThe shield itself is blue, representing the color associated with the infantry.\n\nThe crest on the coat of arms is a sea lion, derived from the Spanish Arms of Manila, symbolizing the regiment's involvement in the battles surrounding the city in 1899.\n\nLastly, the two arrows represent the regiment's participation in Indian campaigns."
