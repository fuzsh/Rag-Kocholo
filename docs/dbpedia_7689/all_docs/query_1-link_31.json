Many of the families recognised Pantosaurus and knew the PANTS song, so it was great to see that the message of Talk PANTS is spreading.\n\n“Many thanks to staff from Edinburgh Zoo for having us and Pantosaurus there. The children really enjoyed spending the afternoon with our friendly and colourful dinosaur.\n\n“Talk PANTS lets us speak to children about their rights and how to keep safe in an age-appropriate way and it was brilliant to see so many families turn up for the event. A simple conversation can make a big difference and that’s what Talk PANTS is all about.”\n\nOther upcoming Talk PANTS events in Edinburgh include appearances at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on August 20th, the Primary School Gala Day at the Book Festival on August 22nd, and a family day at Sighthill Library on August 30th which will include a reading by popular children’s author Bruna De Luca, from her book I’m Not Cute, I’m Dangerous.\n\nFor more information about Talk PANTS, visit the , and to find out about other events taking place in Edinburgh, visit EdinburghTalkPANTS\n\nAnyone with concerns about the welfare of a child can call the NSPCC’s free and confidential helpline on 0808 800 5000 or email help@NSPCC.org.uk for advice.\n\nChildren and young people can contact Childline about anything that may be worrying them by calling 0800 1111 or by visiting: www.childline.org.uk\n\nBenefits for victims, police, prosecutors, defence lawyers and courts\n\nA world-leading £33 million Scottish Government initiative for sharing digital evidence from crime scene to court room is being rolled out across Scotland.\n\nDigital Evidence Sharing Capability (DESC) allows police officers, prosecutors, defence lawyers, court staff and judges to access a secure, unified system to collect, store, process and manage evidence digitally.\n\nBenefits include fewer victims and witnesses having to attend court, cases coming to court and concluding quicker, and valuable police time being saved.\n\nDuring a pilot of the programme in Dundee, around 19,500 pieces of evidence were handled through DESC, with almost 550 hours of police officers’ time freed up.\n\nDESC handles evidence including CCTV footage, photographs, and data and other materials from computers and mobile devices. This will be expanded to include documents and recordings of police interviews.\n\nThe system means members of the public and businesses can submit digital evidence – such as material recorded on mobile phones – more easily by email when sent a link by a police officer. DESC also saves on transport costs and cuts CO2 emissions by reducing the need for physical evidence to be collected in person and stored.\n\nDESC’s expansion across Tayside and Forth Valley marks the start of a phased national roll-out that is expected to be completed by autumn 2025.\n\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said: “This is a world first for Scotland – a truly transformational programme where digital evidence is managed securely from crime scene to court room, benefitting victims, police officers, prosecutors, defence lawyers, court staff and judges.\n\n“During the successful pilot in Dundee, DESC allowed justice system partners to collect, manage and share digital evidence in a streamlined and efficient way, helping to get cases resolved more quickly. It has also freed up a significant amount of time for police officers, creating additional capacity for frontline policing.”\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs said: “The national roll-out of DESC is a significant step forward in modernising the collection, management and secure storage of digital evidence.\n\n“Until now, police officers have relied on transferring digital evidence such as mobile phone images or CCTV onto USB sticks or discs, before delivering them to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\n\n“Through DESC, officers can obtain and share digital evidence securely and efficiently, saving them time and reducing delays. This supports victims and witnesses to achieve faster justice outcomes. The national roll-out will also provide the groundwork for further modernisation of the criminal justice process including supporting the introduction of body worn video for frontline police officers.”\n\nAndrew Laing, Deputy Head of Local Court, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, said: “Being able to see CCTV evidence of an assault or shoplifting taking place, or Ring doorbell footage of a person committing an act of domestic abuse as soon as the matter is reported by police has allowed prosecutors to make better and quicker decisions and faster sharing with the defence to enable the early resolution of cases.\n\n“COPFS and criminal justice partners in Police Scotland, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service, the defence community and judiciary will continue to work to transform the justice system and ensure cases move through the system as efficiently as possible, with speedier outcomes and significantly less inconvenience to victims and witnesses.“\n\nSheriff Principal Gillian Wade KC said: “DESC facilitates easier sharing of digital evidence which can be crucial for determining the strength of a case at an early stage and allowing for more informed decisions about allegations against an accused person.\n\n“This dovetails well with other initiatives currently being implemented such as the Summary Case Management pilots. Both have at their core the importance of early disclosure and engagement alongside multi-agency co-operation. This approach leads to fewer unnecessary hearings, fewer witness citations and a reduction in the number of outstanding trials.\n\n“While DESC will initially be utilised for Summary cases only, it is envisaged that its capability will be expanded to include Solemn business at a later stage.”\n\nThe Scottish Government will invest £33 million in DESC over 10 years.\n\nDespite leaving North Edinburgh for the bright lights in London when she was only 17, Linda never forgot where she came from and was very proud of North Edinburgh , its people and the community’s long history of fighting injustice (writes LYNN McCABE).\n\nShe felt very strongly about inequality and social justice and although she had a comfortable life and could have spent her retirement years with her feet up, she chose to get involved in her old community and do what she could to try to improve things.\n\nShe was passionate about education and was a great advocate for lifelong learning and signed up for a variety of courses which covered some of the topics she was interested in including Scottish history, politics, the Scots language and the arts. Even when she wasn’t attending a class, she was always researching something and was keen to share her learning with others.\n\nShe joined the Power to the People group in 2012, a new project developed by local activists who wanted to study the history of protest in Scotland through the arts. It was a perfect fit for Linda with her passion for politics, Scottish history and the arts.\n\nThe class ran for a number of years and brought together people who were new to activism as well as people who had been involved in community politics and the trade unions.\n\nLinda was really interested in listening to everyone’s views but was more than capable of holding her own during the many heated debates that took place each week!\n\nThrough the years, the focus of the class moved from studying the history of protest to actually taking part in protests! Members of the Power to the People group got involved in many local issues including cuts to local services and the campaign to stop the eviction of local families from their homes.\n\nLinda was at the heart of these protests helping to design placards and banners and was actively involved in a sit-in at the local housing office and a protest that ended up taking over Ruth Davidson’s constituency office. She also took part in numerous protests outside the city chambers every year in response to proposals to cut vital local services.\n\nHaving exhausted the subject of the history of protest in Scotland over a 2 year period, Linda and her class mates from the Power to the People group decided it was time to undertake another research project where the focus was closer to home.\n\nThis project was going to focus on North Edinburgh’s history and would cover some of the big industrial, housing and political changes in the area over the last century. It turned out that there was too many interesting things which they felt could not be missed out so the history timeline began with the Roman encampment in Cramond!\n\nThe information the group unearthed was fascinating and highlighted how central North Edinburgh was to Scotland’s history.\n\nOn the completion of this research, Linda and a few other folk from the group decided their next priority would be to promote North Edinburgh’s hidden history and over a number of years they developed heritage walks, a history hub down at Madelvic and led a successful campaign to protect and restore the Granton Castle Walled Garden.\n\nLinda remained actively involved in all these projects even as her health deteriorated and was instrumental in helping to preserve the area’s cultural heritage.\n\nAnother passion of Linda’s was arts and culture. She felt strongly about the need for the arts to be accessible to everyone. She was a regular visitor at the city’s art galleries and kept her eye out for new exhibitions and cultural events which were heading to Edinburgh.\n\nShe was quick to share this information with all the groups and projects she was connected with which ensured that local folk from didn’t miss out.\n\nLinda was very good with her hands and was one of the stitchers involved in creating the Prestonpans tapestry, The Diaspora Tapestry for the Homecoming and the Great Tapestry of Scotland.\n\nShe almost succeeded in convincing her friends from North Edinburgh to embark on a new project called the Great Tapestry of North Edinburgh which was going to cover key historical events and famous people associated with North Edinburgh. Everyone was really excited about the idea of this project, until they realised that they were going to have to be involved in doing the stitching!\n\nDespite a really positive meeting with Andrew Crummy who had designed the other tapestries, the consensus amongst the group was that it was a good idea but none of them were likely to be alive to see the tapestry completed so sadly that project didn’t come to pass!\n\nAnother passion of Linda’s was womens’ rights and so on Wednesday afternoons she would catch up with her pals from the Women’s International Group (WIG) who ran a programme of informal learning opportunities for local women.\n\nThe group also organised numerous events including womens’ health and well-being days, hustings, and public meetings on local issues and made history when they became the first singing deputation at a full council meeting.\n\nBeing local women, the Women’s International Group were well aware of all the strong North Edinburgh women who had came before them and made a point of celebrating their achievements and the achievements of inspirational women from around the world at their annual international womens day events.\n\nLinda was always at the heart of these gatherings and did presentations, took her turn at chairing the event, read poetry but was equally happy to do the register or make the tea and coffee.\n\nLinda’s passion for her community continued through the last few years of her life. She would regularly email me funding information or links to materials which she thought would be useful.\n\nDespite her health issues, she remained interested in what was happening in North Edinburgh and regularly shared words of support and encouragement to the friends she had made in the community over the years.\n\nLinda was most definitely a North Edinburgh ‘wummin’ through and through and will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nLynn McCabe\n\nCommunity Learning and Development Worker\n\nRoyston Wardieburn Community Centre"
