Australians on the Western Front, 1918. Volume 1: Resisting the great German offensive (Viking, Penguin Random Hose Australian: Melbourne) 401 pp., Call No. 572 CAME 2018.\n\nVolume 1, the first in a two-part series, is the story of Australian troops on the Western front in March and April 1918. These troops were directly responsible for pushing back the German advances on the Somme towards Amiens at Dernancourt and Villers-Bretonneux and further north at Hazebrouck, saving the Channel Ports, and their actions resulted in the collapse of the German offensive which was to finally win the war for Germany. The Australian victories in April 1918 enabled the British to launch their own great offensive in August 1918, in which the Australian Army Corps now led by General John Monash, would play a pivotal role in the defeat of Germany three months later (which will be covered in Volume 2).\n\nCameron, David W.

Deng Xiaoping: the man who made modern China (I. B. Taurus: London) 330 pp., Call No. 411 DILL 2015.\n\nDeng Xiaoping has generally been given the credit for the reforms of the late 1970s that put China on the path to spectacular economic growth and development, a process that has turned it into one of the greatest powers of the twenty-first century. His 'Four Modernisations' - reform in agriculture, industry, military, science and technology - unveiled at the Third Plenum of the Central Committee in 1978 undoubtedly paved the way for China's rise to superpower status. Yet, only a decade after this, his greatest achievement, Deng fell dramatically from grace, becoming reviled both within and out.\n\nFahey, John (2018).

Strategy: a history (Oxford University Press: Oxford) 751 pp., Call No: 820 FREE 2013.\n\nSir Lawrence Freedman, one of the world's leading authorities on war and international politics, captures the vast history of strategic thinking, in a consistently engaging and insightful account of how strategy came to pervade every aspect of our lives. The range of Freedman's narrative is extraordinary, moving from the surprisingly advanced strategy practiced in primate groups, to the opposing strategies of Achilles and Odysseus in The Iliad, the strategic advice of Sun Tzu and Machiavelli, the great military innovations of Baron Henri de Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz, to the nuclear strategists of the 1950s, and finally to counterinsurgency and the 'Revolution in Military Affairs'.\n\nHughes-Wilson, John (2018). Hamel 4th July 1918: the Australian & American victory (Uniform: London) 163 pp., Call No. 572 HUGH 2018.\n\nThe Battle of le Hamel near Amiens, France, was a dramatic turning point in the Great War. Hamel showed how the stalemate of trench warfare could be broken. It also was one of the first bloodings of the newly-arrived American Expeditionary Force in France. Corporal Thomas A. Pope of Chicago was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour. The lessons of Hamel were to unleash a military phenomenon, 'Blitzkrieg' or 'Lightning War' - the modern warfighting concept of combining all arms in the attack: infantry; artillery; airpower; tanks; deception; and, above all, surprise.\n\nLardas, Mark (2018). Rabaul, 1943-44: reducing Japan's great island fortress. Air Campaign series. (Osprey Publishing: Oxford) 96 pp., Call No: 950 LARD 2018.\n\nIn 1943, the massive Japanese naval and air base of Rabaul was a fortress standing in the Allies' path to Tokyo. It was impossible to seize Rabaul or to starve the garrison out. Lards explains how air power, with judicious use of naval and land forces, would eliminate the need to occupy a ground objective in order to control it. The siege of Rabaul provided a road map for the rest of World War II in the Pacific.\n\nMoorcroft, Paul (2018).

Independence struggles in Namibia, Angola and Rhodesia were followed by civil wars between rival factions. Liberation movements in South Africa demanded self-rule and an end to apartheid.

Success at Polygon Wood would put Broodseinde Ridge within Second Army's reach. The attach was almost blindsided by a German counter-attack on the eve of the battle, but the critical situation on the Anzac Corps' right was saved by the 15th Brigade of 5th Division, which secured the right flank before the Division went on to achieved it objectives. Luck played a part in achieving a 'splendid victory'.\n\nRees, Peter (2018).

The last battle: endgame on the Western Front, 1918 (Profile Books: London) 453 pp., Call No: 572 HART 2018.\n\nBy August 1918, the outcome of the Great War was not in doubt: the Allies would win. But what was unclear was how this defeat would play out, would the Germans hold on, prolonging the fighting deep into 1919, with the loss of hundreds of thousands more young lives, or could the war be won in 1918? Herein, Peter Hart brings to life the dramatic final weeks of the war, as men fought to secure victory, with survival seemingly only days, or hours away. Drawing on the experience of both generals and ordinary soldiers, and dwelling with equal weight on strategy, tactics and individual experience, this is a powerful and detailed account of history's greatest endgame.\n\nHolloway, David Clare (2014).

After a disastrous campaign in Greece, there are fears of a German takeover in Vichy-controlled Syria and Lebanon, where a French colonial army may fall in line with the Nazis. Churchill orders General Wavell to take the offensive, assuming that the French will not put up a fight against an Allied show of force. The only troops available are the 7th Australian Division: untested recruits, digging ditches in the Egyptian desert. This book tells how the 7th Division came to fight the French in the rocky hills of Lebanon and the barren wastes of Syria. The French resisted viciously. The Australians won the war, bu"
