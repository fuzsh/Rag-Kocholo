        "text": "Colour patches were developed and used by the Australian Imperial Force (A.I.F.) in World War 1, as a means of rapid unit identification. In the absence of regimental badges, they became a focal point of fierce unit loyalty and pride.\n\nThis colour patch system was continued throughout the Australian Army between 1921 and 1945, but ceased during the early years of the post-World War II army.\n\nDuring World War II, Australian Imperial Force unit colour patches were distinguished from those of the non-A.I.F. component of the Australian Military Forces by the addition of a grey border or backing. This border, or backing, was of a shape representing the division to which the battalion was allotted, and not necessarily symmetrical with the battalion shape, for example 2/19th Australian Infantry Battalion's colour patch was a half-sized battalion patch diamond-shaped brown over mid-green, within the grey horizontal oval of the 8th Australian Division.\n\nLikewise, the 2/13th and 2/11th Australian Infantry Battalion colour patches were, in 1943, with others varied in shape to the 9th Australian Division \"T\"-shaped patch, their colours respectively black superimposed on mid-green, and white superimposed on mid-green, both on a grey backing, all colours in \"T\"-shape. The \"T\" shape was to indicate involvement in the Siege of Tobruk.\n\nColour patches were re-introduced in 1987 on a restricted scale, permitting active units which could prove descent from a former unit which had an approved colour patch and served either during World War 1 or World War 11, to apply to wear the earliest version of that unit's colour patch. Policy in the case of linked units is to wear the colour patch of the unit taking precedence in the linked unit's designation.\n\nLight Horse colour patches are of a horizontal rectangle shape, divided diagonally, with the colour of the brigade nearer the front of the wearer, the colour of the regiment towards the rear.\n\nInfantry colour patches, with the exception of the 9th Australian Division, are divided equally in the horizontal or vertical plane. In the former case, the battalion colour is placed above the brigade colour. In the latter, that portion of the colour patch nearer the front of the wearer is the battalion colour, that to the rear the brigade colour. The shape of the colour patch, with the exception of the battalions of 4th Brigade, indicates the division to which the unit belonged in the Great War. The 4th Brigade, though wearing the 1st Division shape patch, was allotted initially to the New Zealand and Australian Division for service at Gallipoli. It was, after Gallipoli, allotted to 4th Division on its being raised in Egypt in February 1916."
