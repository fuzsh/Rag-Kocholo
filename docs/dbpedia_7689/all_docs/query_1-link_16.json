        "text": "What are these records?\n\nThese records are the unit war diaries of the British Army in the First World War and are held by The National Archives in record series WO 95.\n\nThey are not personal diaries (try the Imperial War Museum or local record offices for those).\n\nDifferent parts of the collection cover units serving in different theatres:\n\nFrance and Flanders: WO 95/1-3154, WO 95/3911-4193 and WO 95/5500\n\nMesopotamia, Iraq and North Persia: WO 95/4965-5288\n\nEast Africa, Cameroon and West Africa: WO 95/5289-5388\n\nAdditional operational records for the Royal Naval Division can be found in ADM 137.\n\nSome diaries are available on other websites:\n\nGallipoli and the Dardanelles: WO 95/4263-4359 Ancestry (£).\n\nAustralian and New Zealand Expeditionary Force: WO 95/3155-3657 Australian War Memorial and Archway\n\nCanadian Expedition Force: WO 95/3715-3910 Library and Archives Canada\n\nWhat information do the records contain?\n\nSome diaries record little more than daily losses and map references whilst others are much more descriptive, with daily reports on operations, intelligence summaries and other material. The digitised diaries cover activity in France and Belgium.\n\nThe diaries sometimes contain information about particular people but they are unit diaries, not personal diaries. A few contain details about awards of the Military Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal.\n\nMany maps and plans were included in the original diaries but some confidential material was removed before the files were made available. This accounts for the absence of some appendices referred to on the covers of many diaries.\n\nHow do I search the records?\n\nYou can search (£) for a digitised diary in our catalogue by filling in the form below.\n\nTo search the entire collection, digitised or not, use the search advice below in the advanced search of our catalogue restricting your search to reference WO 95.\n\nEach diary is listed in our catalogue under the name of the unit, for example ‘9 Battalion Manchester Regiment’, along with a short description summarising the theatre of operation and the section of the British Army command structure within which the unit existed (usually a division).\n\nPlease note, the search results will include the number(s) and term(s) you searched with wherever they appear in the title and short description of the diary. So if you search for the 3rd battalion of a regiment your results may include diaries for units in the 3rd division as well.\n\nThe following search tips may prove useful:\n\nIf you search only by name of regiment (without a battalion number), your search results will include all the battalions in that regiment.\n\nYou do not need to include the word ‘regiment’, ‘battalion’ or ‘brigade’. For example, to search for a battalion in the Northumberland Fusiliers, you need only search using the word ‘Northumberland’.\n\nWhen searching for unit numbers, use cardinal numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3 etc.) as opposed to ordinal numbers (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.). For example, to search for the 9th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment search with “9 Manchester”\n\nWhat do the records look like?\n\nWith each download, you will typically see a unit diary that may cover a period of several years. This may be divided into several PDF files, which you can save to your computer. You can then scroll through the PDF files to locate the battalion and dates that you are interested in.\n\nMany of the war diaries were scribbled hastily in pencil and use obscure abbreviations, whilst some are the second carbon copy of the original, so they may be difficult to read.\n\nWhy can’t I find what I’m looking for?\n\nNot all the unit war diaries held by The National Archives have been digitised."
