        "text": "Battle of Sharpsburg, or Antietam\n\nThe regiment returned from its pursuit of the Union cavalry and joined the brigade on its right. It was commanded by Captain John A. McGregor.\n\nFrom the first of two War Department markers for Toombs’ Brigade that were on the Antietam battlefield, located on the Harpers Ferry Road just south of Sharpsburg:\n\nToombs’ Brigade took position on the evening of September 15, on the bluff commanding the Burnside Bridge and ford a short distance below. His skirmishers and several Batteries of Artillery engaged the enemy during the afternoon of the 16th. On the morning of the 17th the Brigade was exposed to a heavy fire from the enemy’s Artillery on the opposite side of the Antietam. Between 9 A.M. and noon the enemy made several attempts to carry the bridge, but failed. An assault at 1 P.M. was successful and the Brigade fell back and formed line in this road, on the extreme right of the Division and co-operated with Archer’s Brigade of A.P. Hill’s Division in checking any further advance of the enemy.\n\nFrom the second of two War Department markers for Toombs’ Brigade that were on the Antietam battlefield, at one time on the west side of Branch Avenue but no longer standing:\n\nOn the morning of the 17th, the 2d and 20th Georgia of Toombs’ Brigade, the 50th Georgia of Drayton’s Brigade, and a Company each of Hood’s Texas Brigade and Jenkins’ Brigade occupied a position commanding the Burnside Bridge and Snavely’s Ford. At 1 P.M., the Ninth Army Corps forced the passage of the bridge and ford, and Toombs withdrew his command to the Antietam Furnace Road in the suburbs of Sharpsburg. During the engagement at the bridge and ford, and while falling back, Toombs was joined by the 15th and 17th Georgia, of his Brigade, and five Companies of the 11th Georgia of Col. George T. Anderson’s Brigade. Re-forming his command on the Antietam Furnace Road, where he was joined by portions of Kemper’s, Drayton’s and Garnett’s Brigades, Toombs advanced on the left of Archer’s Briagade of A.P. Hill’s Division and, at this point, engaged the Federal troops in the lane and fields beyond. Late in the afternoon his command was relieved by Branch’s Brigade of A.P. Hill’s Division and moved easterly across the Sharpsburg Road, where it remained until withdrawn to re-cross the Potomac.\n\nFrom Captain McGregor’s Official Report for the 17th Georgia in the battle:\n\nMy command, together with Fifteenth Georgia and five companies of the Eleventh Georgia Regiment, were posted as support to the Twentieth and Second Georgia Regiments, who were engaged at the Stone Bridge, and who distinguished themselves in the extreme in driving the enemy away, who attacked them with vastly superior numbers of infantry; also had batteries, which commanded the bridge. Still the gallant Twentieth and Second held the position until all their ammunition was exhausted. They then fell back. About this time we were relieved by a portion of General A. P. Hillís division, as I thought to go to the support of our own division and to rest a little, for we were worn almost down by fatiguing marches, but in the meantime the enemy were advancing on the left of the position which we had been holding. After the position was taken by those who relieved us we proceeded to go to the position where we were ordered, and while on the march toward the left we were notified that the enemy were advancing in strong force, and that our forces which were posted in their front had, after a very short resistance, given way and left one of our batteries exposed to the mercy of the enemy. Of course the gunners were then compelled to leave, and their condition was such that two or three pieces were left on the field. I received an order to bring my command up in double-quick time and engage the enemy, which I promptly obeyed. Never could men have acted more gallantly than those under my command, save a few, which I shall hereafter mention. When I reached the field I found the enemyís long lines in position in grand style. I took position and ordered my men to open fire upon them, at the same time to be cool and aim well, which they did. After a short but desperate struggle the enemy gave way, and we went forward. The battery was then safe. We engaged the enemy about 4 p. m., and it lasted until dark. We drove the enemy about three-quarters of a mile, and should have still pursued but for the prudence of yourself and General R. Toombs, who had discovered that the enemy had batteries on our left and were only waiting for our approach."
