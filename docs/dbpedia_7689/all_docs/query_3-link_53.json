Its purpose is to bring together those who served honorably with, or who are now on active duty in all Battalions of the 17th Artillery. It was also formed to honor those who sacrificed their lives while serving with the unit.\n\nThe Association’s objective is to find all who served with said unit and to hold yearly reunions at various locations. We wish to preserve and strengthen the friendships and camaraderie that was formed while serving in this outstanding Artillery Unit. The Organization will publish a newsletter to keep all members informed of events, historical information, and activities of the Association. We will also maintain the 17th Artillery Classroom in Snow Hall at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and add new Memorabilia, pictures, and history of the past and present units in addition to the exhibits that are already there, as well as maintaining an Internet Site. This site is in recognition of and dedicated to all that proudly served in the great units of the 17th Artillery.\n\nPlease use our Guest Book to leave a message to other visitors.
