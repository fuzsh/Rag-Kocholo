        "text": "This article is about the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) and will help you to research the Regiment and the soldiers who served with it during the First World War. I have written a separate article about the war-raised 2nd Battalion 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) and a series of guides to help you to research soldiers who served in the Indian Army. To view the guides click on the blue links below:\n\n2nd Battalion 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment)\n\nResearching Soldiers who Served in the Indian Army in the First World War\n\nThe 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) in the First World War\n\nLineage: Formed at Phillour in 1858 by Major J. C. Innes ”from the faithful remains of the 3rd, 36th and 61st Bengal Native Infantry, and designated ”The Loyal Purbiah Regiment”. In 1861 its designation changed twice, becoming first the 21st and then 17th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. In 1864 it became the 17th (Loyal Purbiah) Regiment of Bengal Infantry and in 1898 the 17th (The Loyal) Bengal Infantry. In 1902 the Regiment became the 17th Musalman Rajput Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) and in 1903 the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment). The Regiment was disbanded on 20 December 1921.\n\nClass Composition of Battalion in 1914: 8 Companies of Musalmans of the Eastern Punjab and Hindustan. 1919: 4 Companies of Musalmans of the Eastern Punjab and Hindustan.\n\nLocation in 1914: The 17th Infantry was stationed at Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh, India), having arrived from Manipur (India) on 12 March 1914.\n\nThe 17th Infantry was an Indian infantry regiment which served in East Africa and with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the First World War. In the Regiment’s final confidential report before the outbreak of war, the 17th Infantry was inspected by Major-General Alexander Wilson, Commanding Lucknow (Infantry) Brigade in 1914 and I’ve transcribed part of the report below:\n\nTurnout: Satisfactory.\n\nEfficiency in drill: Satisfactory.\n\nRecruits: Satisfactory. Of prescribed classes.\n\nInterior economy: Satisfactory. Due economy is practised in regard to clothing deductions.\n\nGeneral efficiency: Individuality and independence of action is encouraged. Officers both British and Indian are well up to the standard of their rank, in the practical handling of their men. A well trained battalion.\n\nObservations by Major-General E. S. May, Commanding 8th (Lucknow) Division:\n\nThis battalion showed itself during the Dacca Concentration to be a soldierlike and useful body of men. They were as well trained as could be expected from the situation in which they had been placed during the period previous to the manoeuvres. There was considerable initiative amongst the officers and discipline was good. Fit for active service.\n\nConfidential review reports on Indian Army units for 1913-1914: IOR/L/MIL/7/17023\n\nThe 17th Infantry was stationed at Lucknow in August 1914 and landed in East Africa in December 1915. The Regiment served in East Africa until January 1918 when it arrived back in India at Karachi (Sindh, Pakistan) the next month. The best resource for learning more about the Regiment’s service in East Africa, where it was decimated by disease, is its war diaries which I have recorded below. In June 1918, while the 17th Infantry was stationed at Dinapore, the Regiment received orders to mobilize for service in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. The Regiment landed at Suez, Egypt on 19 June 1918 and served in the closing stages of the Palestine Campaign. The 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) was disbanded on 20 December 1921. Below is an extract from the October 1914, Indian Army List which recorded the British officers serving with the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment).\n\nWar Diaries of the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment)\n\nThere are seven war diaries for the Regiment and the first five have been digitized by the National Archives. To download these war diaries for a small fee click on the blue links below. The last two war diaries can only be viewed at the National Archives. I have copies of all war diaries and have transcribed some entries below.\n\nDate: 01 December 1915- 30 September 1916\n\nLines of Communication, East Africa\n\nReference: WO 95/5369/14\n\nNotes: There was very little to report in this war diary and most entries concerned the movements of troops.\n\nDate: 01 October – 30 November 1916\n\nColonel Taylor’s Column, East Africa\n\nReference: WO 95/5334/33\n\nNotes: Only 2 pages in length which consisted of the movements of various detachments.\n\nDate: 01 December 1916 – 30 September 1917\n\nIringa Column, East Africa\n\nReference: WO 95/5334/15\n\nNotes: A good, detailed war diary, with plenty of information regarding the inadequate rations (exact weight was given) supplied to the Indian soldiers. Indian casualties are listed by both name and regimental number.\n\nDate: October 1917\n\nGeneral Headquarters, East Africa\n\nReference: WO 95/5318/2\n\nNotes: A good war diary for the month which is only 2 pages in length.\n\nDate: 01 November 1917 – 11 February 1918\n\nGeneral Headquarters, East Africa\n\nReference: WO 95/5320/5\n\nNotes: A short war diary which overall contains good information for the period.\n\nDate: 01 June 1918 – 31 March 1919\n\n160th Infantry Brigade, 53rd Welsh Division, Egyptian Expeditionary Force\n\nReference: WO 95/4632\n\nNotes: An average war diary with many entries simple recording ”Nothing further to report” or just noting when parades and physical training took place. The names of British officers appear throughout.\n\nDate: 01 April 1919 – 29 March 1920\n\n234th Infantry Brigade, 75th Division, Egyptian Expeditionary Force\n\nReference: WO 95/4694\n\nNotes: Longer entries than usual for a war diary covering this period. Despite this very little happened. British and Indian officers and other ranks are mentioned throughout.\n\nFurther Sources for the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment)\n\nA good source of information for the Regiment and the British officers who served with it are its confidential reports held at the British Library: Confidential Reports on Regiments etc. These reports also contain the annual reports of the British officers serving with the 17th Infantry. However, when the Regiment was abroad only its Depot and the British officers serving with it were reported on. For information regarding the British and Indian officers who served with the 17th Infantry, the Indian Army List should be consulted.\n\nExtracts from War Diaries of the 17th Infantry\n\nOctober 1917, East Africa, WO 95/5318/2\n\n9 October 1917 – Migerigeri – Regiment marched at 13 hours reaching Migergeri, 13 miles at 18 hours. Orders – To proceed Nahungu to form special reserve Hanforce. Scale British Officers 100lbs, Indian Officers 12lbs, Sepoys 6 1/4lbs, followers, 5lbs. Transport- Pack donkeys troublesome at first and requiring more rifles as escort than other forms of transport, as personnel was short, and loads required replacing frequently.\n\n15 October 1917 – Luale – Marched 5.30 hours reached Luale 15 miles, 13 hours. Regiment attacked by bees and one donkey killed, all donkeys stampeded [and] loads lost. Captain E Hammick two ribs dislocated by fall from mule. To hospital.\n\n01 December 1916 – 30 September 1917, Iringa Column, East Africa, WO 95/5334/15\n\n8 January 1917 – Muhanga Mission – Owing to shortage of rations units instructed by Officer Commanding Taylor’s Column to nominate a requisitioning officer to purchase supplies locally so long as unit’s remained on short rations.\n\nOwing to fact that Germans and other forces operating in this area had previously cleared the country of supplies and cattle little or nothing could be obtained. Natives had fled their holding’s and were hiding in the forest at least such of the as the Germans had not carried away as carriers.\n\nGuides to Researching Soldiers who Served in the Indian Army"
