An earlier regiment designated the 17th Infantry Regiment was organized on January 11, 1812, but was consolidated with four other regiments as the 3rd Infantry in the post-war reorganization of the army following the War of 1812, due to the shattering losses it sustained at the River Raisin. The current 17th Infantry was constituted as the 17th Regiment of Infantry on May 3, 1861.\n\nCivil War[]\n\nThe 17th Infantry Regiment was in the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War in Sykes' Division of the 5th Army Corps, the badge of which was a white cross patee, which is embodied in the coat of arms and shown on the blue field above and to the left of the stone wall.\n\nAt Fredericksburg. the 17th suffered heavy losses in the assault on the famous stone wall, \"For one entire day, (December 14) the men of the 17th lay flat on their faces eighty yards in front of the famous stone wall, behind which the enemy was posted in large numbers and any movement on their part was sure to draw the fire of rebel sharpshooters.\n\nThe five-bastioned fort, shown on the blue shield above and to the right of the stone wall, was the badge of the 5th Army Corps in Cuba in 1898.\n\nCoat of arms[]\n\nThe buffalo, shown on the blue shield bellow the stone wall represents the regiment's history in the Korean war. The \"Buffalo\" nickname was adopted after one of the regiment's commanding officers in the Korean war, Col. William W. \"Buffalo Bill\" Quinn.[citation needed]\n\nThe shield is blue, being the color representing the infantry.\n\nThe Crest is a sea lion taken from the Spanish Arms of Manila for the fighting around that city in 1899.\n\nThe two arrows represent the Indian campaigns in which the 17th Regiment participated.\n\nMedal of Honor recipients[]\n\nSpanish–American War\n\nPrivate George Berg, Company C\n\nPrivate Oscar Brookin, Company C\n\nCorporal Ulysses G.
