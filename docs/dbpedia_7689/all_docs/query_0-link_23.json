The ADF takes its duty of care to Defence members seriously and their health and wellbeing is a key Defence priority.\n\nAs Defence moves to shape, deter and respond to the rapid global changes affecting Australia’s interests, the Defence Health System must also display agility and adapt to the future strategic environment and respond to government priorities.\n\nThis presentation will provide an overview of the ADF Health Research Framework 2021-25. This Framework marks a new chapter in setting a strategic approach to shaping Defence health research to have the greatest potential to contribute to ADF capability and improved health outcomes for ADF members.\n\nThe Framework aims to optimise Australia’s relative advantages in health research expertise and infrastructure and outlines a more streamlined and systematic engagement process between Defence and research partners. Implementation of each of the four strategies which underpin the Framework will ensure high quality, relevant and timely research is delivered to optimise ADF capability.\n\nThis presentation will also showcase in more detail the first key strategy of the Framework which is the identification of strategic health research priorities. These priority areas will be integral to the future of Defence health research, and research within these priority themes will support the health and wellbeing of ADF members.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr Michael Drew is the Director of Health Research within Joint Health Command at Defence.

Following the trial participation of two candidates in 2019, Australia has now enrolled cohorts of 20 students in 2020 and 13 in 2021, with a further 20 nominated to commence in 2022.\n\nGeneral global health topics covered include International Health Regulations, development economics, maternal and reproductive health, child health, nutrition, global health diplomacy, and an introduction to the role of the military in global health (and how different nations approach this). Complex topics such as female genital mutilation, abortion, and other serious ethical challenges are discussed. Advanced courses deal with:\n\nContemporary and historical examples of Military Global Health Engagement, such as the US Medical Civil Aid Programs during the Vietnam War, engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the evolution of Exercise Pacific Partnership in response to an increasingly sophisticated understanding of what benefits partner\n\nPublic Health Issues of Disasters in Developing Countries, including the role of different responders to disasters and some of the most important public health issues among disaster\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation methods used by government and non-government organisations involved in aid, development and security co-operation, culminating in writing an M&E plan using “real life” USAID solicitations for international development projects.\n\nHealth Context Analysis, which prepares military health professionals to consider the cumulative influence of socio-cultural background, health culture, determinants of health, and the health system to develop a standardized tool to collect, organise, and interpret information about a specific country or region and to inform global health\n\nThrough participation in discussion groups, ADF students build an international network of military health professional peers that will assist them in postings requiring interactions with partner nations.\n\nThe courses are designed so that students complete approximately one module per week. Students read the materials and watch the lectures in their own time, and then convene as a class once per week online (via live video teleconference) for seminars with course faculty and their fellow students. Individual courses may also require discussion board participation, a term paper, and possibly a final exam. Most courses run for 11 weeks. Most live sessions are held on weekday evenings, U.S. Eastern Standard Time, which is mid-morning in eastern Australia.\n\nIdeal ADF candidates will have a strong academic record in previous tertiary studies, some previous experience working in an international environment, and a military posting or career plan that demonstrates likely personal and service benefit from this qualification and professional network. Applications are sought in November – December each year from SERCAT 3-7 members of all ranks and in all health professions including General Service Officers.\n\nBiography:\n\nBrigadier Reade is an intensivist, anaesthetist, and the Professor of Military Medicine and Surgery at the University of Queensland.

The service incorporates Psychiatry, Drug Health, Pain & Rehabilitation Medicine, along with Clinical Psychology and a comprehensive allied health team. It is a patient-centred model of care driven by veterans’ and members’ goals, with embedded telehealth capability and residential accommodation available for those needing to travel for care.\n\nThe transition from ADF to civilian health care can be destabilising for separating personnel, with challenges navigating complex care needs across multiple providers. The availability of clinical services to support ADF members across this transition has been identified as an opportunity to better coordinate continuing healthcare supports. Through its multidisciplinary focus and case managed model, the NCVH is well placed to facilitate a less disruptive transition to civilian life for those with some of the highest medical and psychological needs.\n\nThe NCVH has, to-date, received referrals for 25 ADF members approaching transition from the military. These referrals have spanned all service branches (11 Army, 11 Navy, 3 Air Force), with the majority of members (76%, n=19) having deployed, with all but one medically separating. Most members were married or in de facto relationships (72%, n=18), which were identified as potential supports over the transition period. The majority of members required care across disciplines for physical, mental and psychosocial health needs. A high burden of chronic pain with multiple musculoskeletal injuries was noted, along with high burdens of mental health diagnoses in these transitioning members. The availability of the NCVH clinical service to support members both in advance and subsequent to transition has supported effective coordination of care and mitigated risks of loss to follow-up through this period.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr Charles Betts is a consultant psychiatrist with public appointments within Sydney Local Health District in addition to working at St John of God Richmond Hospital. He is a fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.\n\nDr Betts graduated medical school in 2013 (MBBS, Sydney University) and previously studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He also served five years in the United States Air Force prior to relocating to Australia.\n\nCorresponding author name: Dr Cameron Korb- Wells\n\nCorresponding author email:\n\ncameron.korbwells@health.nsw.gov.au\n\nArmy Psychology: preparing for Accelerated Warfare and supporting an Army in Motion\n\nLieutenant Colonel Maureen Montalban1\n\n1 Australian Army, Australia\n\nThe evolution of the Australian Army Psychology (AAPSYCH) capability for Army has been heavily influence by the last two decades of high operational tempo, the creation of Joint Health Command (JHC) where Army psychologists have been key clinicians within the Mental Health & Psychology Teams, and external drivers with respect to reforms, reports and recommendations that have squarely put a focus on clinical mental health care; and for very good reason, AAPSYCH has been at the forefront of the provision of mental health care to ADF personnel in the last two decades.\n\nHowever, AAPSYCH as a capability is at a pivot point. As a capability, we are repositioning ourselves to focus on command decision support and organisational psychology tasks. This is as a result of the 2020 Health Capability Establishment Review (CER) outcomes, the formal sign off of the AAPSYCH capability statement by Director General Future Land Warfare in 2021 and the decision by the Surgeon General Australian Defence Force in 2022 to delineate the services provided by JHC (mental health services) and the single Services (organisational psychology activities).\n\nThe role of AAPSYCH has always been to support the warfighter, and we have done so in our long history of service: whether it be ensuring we have selected, recruited and retained the right people for the right jobs, to looking after their mental health and wellbeing to ensure they are ‘fit to fight’, to ensuring that we help enable Commanders to make the tough decisions. AAPSYCH is posturing itself to be Future Ready, within the context of Accelerated Warfare and Army in Motion by reviewing, re-envisaging and realigning many aspects so that we can provide Army the full suite of tasks outlined in our capability statement. We don’t have everything right, right now. But as history has shown, we have continually provided Army and its people what it needs, at that particular point in time and we will continue to do so, now and into the future.\n\nBiography:\n\nLieutenant Colonel Montalban is an Army psychologist who has worked at the tactical, operational and strategic environment within the Australian Defence Force, providing psychological advice and interventions to individuals, units and Commanders. She has done so within Australia and on operational deployments to Timor-Leste, the Solomon Islands and the Middle East.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Montalban has completed her Bachelor of Economics (Social Sciences), Graduate Diploma in Science (Psychology), Graduate Diploma in Public Health, Master of Psychology (Health) and is currently working towards completion of her Doctor of Philosophy at the Research School of Population Health at the Australian National University.\n\nCorresponding author name: Lieutenant Colonel Maureen Montalban\n\nCorresponding author email: maureen.montalban@defence.gov.au\n\nAttention control training to improve PTSD symptoms for transitioning veterans\n\nMr Dan Botros1, Dr Olivia Metcalf2 , Dr Tracey Varker2, Mr Doug Scott1\n\nOpen Arms – Veterans & Families Counselling, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, Australia\n\nThe University of Melbourne, Australia\n\nAltered threat monitoring in military and veteran populations may contribute to the development of mental health issues. A simple computer-based program, known as attention control training, developed in the Israeli Defence Force, has the potential to re-calibrate threat monitoring in veterans before they leave the military and transition to civilian life, in order to improve mental health.\n\nIn this pilot randomised controlled trial Australian Defence Force personnel and veterans (N = 59) received four weekly sessions of either attention control training, or a placebo attention training. Participants who received attention control training reported significantly lower levels of PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and significantly improved work and social functioning. No participants who received attention control training worsened with regard to PTSD symptoms, whereas 23.8% of those who received the placebo attention training experienced an increase. The potential for attention control training, a simple, seven minute computer task, to prevent the development of PTSD is significant, and these preliminary findings are world-first.\n\nThe aim of this presentation is to discuss these findings, as well as provide a clinician’s experience of recruiting and engaging participants to take part in attention control training, learnings from the study, and future directions. The majority of participants were veterans who had transitioned within the last 12 months. The main barrier to participation in this trial for ADF personnel was the nature of transition as a busy time, in that members discharging from Defence have multiple other commitments to complete to assist with their ADF transitional requirements. Participation was also hindered by excess travel requirements to complete the trial for members on remote bases, and a lack of understanding around data collection and privacy barriers. The learnings from this preliminary study include the need to consider a ‘virtual implementation’ of attention training, which would involve delivery to an individual’s own computer, as well as deeper integration within the transition space. To validate these preliminary findings, a randomised controlled trial with transitioning personnel is needed.\n\nBiography:\n\nDan Botros has been employed with Open Arms for 4 years and held multiples positions across the organisation including acting Director of Transitioning Members (DVA), Acting Regional Director Vic/ TAS, Group Programs Coordinator and currently is employed as the Assistant Director of Clinical Outreach and Group programs across Victoria and Tasmania.

Articulating the health of this complex system and its ability to generate and sustain directed health capability effects is a significant task. This is made all the more challenging as not all elements of this array are under the direct control of the Surgeon General Australian Defence Force (SGADF).\n\nThe approach to DHS assurance requires a broad view and understanding of that complexity and of the levers available to influence and govern it. Application of a comprehensive assurance framework requires collaboration, cooperation and buy-in from all stakeholders.\n\nGenerating and sustaining required health capability and capacity is dependent on integrating, coordinating and managing a range of fundamental capability inputs, ensuring they are delivered in required state, quantities, characteristics, timescales and tempo needed for the required effects.\n\nThe ADF Health Strategy (the Strategy) identified that a health system assurance function would be an appropriate mechanism by which the SGADF would apply guidance and technical authority through Defence health across key operating contexts of garrison, deployed and civilian influences.\n\nThe DHS assurance framework articulates how Health Strategy Office (HSO) will, in combination and coordination with existing audit and governance programs of the services and groups, provide positive systems wide assurance that Defence health capability is fit for purpose, ready to deliver, responsive to change and resilient in facing challenges.\n\nBiography:\n\nLieutenant Colonel Fred Parker is a General Service Officer within the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps. On completion of university in Sydney he graduated as a Registered Nurse. Following a few years employed in acute care environments, he joined the Army ‘just to have a look’. Over the last 28 years, he has undertaken variety of appointments across all military environments. He is currently the Deputy Director, Health Strategy Office at Joint Health Command\n\nCorresponding author name: Dr Anna Samson\n\nCorresponding author email: anna.samson1@defence.gov.au\n\nBruxism in military members – misconceptions and occupationally centred considerations in management\n\nJessica Kuk\n\nRecognising the controversies and contention about bruxism, this presentation aims to identify and dispel misconceptions about its diagnosis, clinical consequences and associated disorders by drawing from current literature. It discusses important considerations of patient factors within the military population in order to provide appropriate patient centred care.\n\nPatients presenting to the dentist frequently report grinding of teeth at night. This is often accompanied or preceded by reports of jaw joint and muscle pain, headaches and tooth wear. Historically, within the Defence population, there is an almost reflexive treatment to provide an occlusal splint or a ‘nightguard’ without further investigation or review. Unsurprisingly, patient compliance and success are either poor or unknown. Indeed, this is not always appropriate treatment and may even leave other associated conditions undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nIn some cases, the provision of a nightguard can cause further detriment.\n\nIn order to appropriately manage presentations of reported bruxism and its accompanying complaints, the dental practitioner must conduct accurate history taking and investigation. This should involve discussions and questions about any pain, parafunctional habits, psychosocial stressors and general health and wellness. In some cases, it may warrant collaboration with other health practitioners. Understanding the individual’s military context, the lifestyle of the Defence member and its influence on these factors is crucial to comprehensively colour the presenting picture. Greater appreciation of these patient factors, facilitates provision of patient centred, holistic and where necessary, mulit- disciplinary care.\n\nThere may be challenges in providing this care within the military context such as practitioner education, resource availability, environmental factors, availability to attend appointments and requirement to remain dentally and medically fit to deploy in accordance with conditions stipulated by Defence Health Policy. The practitioner’s understanding of these challenges facilitates successful navigation and ultimately leads to better patient outcomes and ideally reduced risk of dental casualties and maintenance of capability.\n\nIn the current climate where retention of capability is a priority, the dental practitioner has a responsibility to empathetically deliver care to increase patient satisfaction and prevent deterioration of oral health that may hamper dental readiness– that is, healthcare to ensure members are Fit to Bite, Fit to Fight.\n\nBiography:\n\nLCDR Jessica Kuk joined the RAN as an undergraduate dentist studying at University of Adelaide. She began her Naval dental career in WA, prior to serving as a Fleet Mobile Dental Officer on multiple platforms. LCDR Kuk is currently enjoying her posting to HMAS Cairns, providing dental support to crews of hydrographic survey and patrol vessels, whilst studying a Master of Science in Medicine (Pain Management) Orofacial Pain. Through her further study, LCDR Kuk continues to develop interest in delivering evidence based, patient centred care within the military context.\n\nCorresponding author name: Jessica Kuk\n\nCorresponding author email: kukjessica@gmail.com\n\nCo-Designed and Peer Led Programs\n\nMr Matt Newlands1 , Dr Jonathan Lane\n\n1 Military & Emergency Services Health Australia, Adelaide, Australia\n\nThe lack of cultural competence of frontline and military health service providers is considered a barrier to accessing and remaining in care, especially mental health services. This is particularly relevant to individuals with a strong service identity which is inherently shaped by the training they receive, their experiences on deployment and the norms, traditions and values of their service culture.\n\nThe presentation will provide an overview of three unique programs co-designed and delivered by Lived Experience Service Peers which are successfully breaking down these help-seeking barriers. These three programs: “Group Emotional And Relationship Skills” (GEARS), “MindRight” & “StoryRight” provide a transdiagnostic, skills-based approach to mental health aimed at providing service personnel with the skills and knowledge to monitor, address and manage what is within their own control. All of these programs are delivered by supervised lived experience peers with the cultural expertise and the credibility to role model functional recovery, thus improving content and skills uptake. Facilitators are trained using a ‘train the trainer’ model of participation, observation, and gradual increase of responsibility for delivery, whilst receiving formal clinical training and are provided with high level clinical oversight.\n\nAll three programs provided by Military and Emergency Services Health Australian are providing a renewed sense of purpose and meaning for Frontline and Military personnel nationally through the application of relevant service-related skills and experience to assist peers in their journey of recovery and/or growth.\n\nBiography:\n\nMatt is a husband and father with 10 years-service with South Australia Police (2006 – 2016). Having been diagnosed with PTSD and depression in 2015, Matt fought a personal battle with suicidal thoughts and refusal of his diagnosis resulting in the destruction of his personal life and the end of his Policing career in very dramatic circumstances.\n\nMatt spent the following years learning strategies and tools to optimise and maintain his wellbeing before turning his attention to supporting other military and first responders.\n\nMatt is now the Lived Experience Stakeholder Engagement Manager and Program Manager for Military and Emergency Services Health Australia; and is also a qualified counsellor, peer work consultant, program facilitator and volunteers as a national Community Ambassador for RUOK?\n\nCorresponding author name: Jonathan Lane\n\nCorresponding author email: jlane@mesha.org.au\n\nDamage Control Resuscitation – are we missing the POInT?\n\nDr Andrew Cahill1\n\n1 Australian Army, Australia\n\nEffective Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR) involves the principles of permissive hypotension, damage control surgery and haemostatic resuscitation. The availability of appropriate blood products in austere, resource-limited and complex prehospital environments is a critical vulnerability to adequate resuscitation. In the military context, operational constraints such as logistic resupply limitations, cold chain compliance, tactical signature, and equipment manoeuvrability may additionally restrict availability. The paucity of blood product redundancy requires an operational solution.\n\nThe Point Of Injury Transfusion (POInT) program is a proposal to enable fresh whole blood to be available and utilised in extreme circumstances where commercial blood product components are deplete or logistically untenable. The proposal closely aligns with established programs in coalition militaries by paralleling the use of pre-screened pre-identified ADF donors to avail Low Titre Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) to causalities in haemorrhagic shock.\n\nThe Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC), in its 2020 amendment to the TCCC guidelines, removed crystalloid therapy as a resuscitation fluid of choice option for casualties in haemorrhagic shock. As a result, ADF Medical Technicians, often the most proximate clinician to the point of injury, do not routinely carry any of the resuscitation fluids recommended to treat trauma causalities in haemorrhagic shock. To address this deficit, the POInT proposal offers a formalised means of sourcing and transfusing LTOWB at the point of injury.\n\nThe key elements of the POInT proposal can be discussed as three phases: approval, pre-deployment and deployment considerations. Firstly, as LTOWB is currently not commercially available in Australia, an appropriate proof of concept, with national and Defence legislative compliance and relevant health policy review is required for approval. Secondly, the pre-deployment processes involve identifying low titre Group O donors within the deploying force, scheduled screening for transfusion transmissible diseases, ensuring equipment familiarisation, training donors and clinicians on the procedure as a battle drill, and outlining the strict clinical governance requirements regarding blood product handling and use. Thirdly, deployment considerations include personnel planning, the utility of pre-mission collections, coalition interoperability and the tactical donation and administration procedure.\n\nExamples of LTOWB transfusions in austere, remote, and operational conflict settings have been increasingly documented. Whilst domestically screened blood components remain sourced as first line products, redundancy options when operational constraints prevent such availability should be considered; mission success and casualty survivability may depend on this. Articulated in this introductory proposal, the POInT program may deliver, in extremis, whole blood critical for damage control resuscitation far forward to support ADF operations.\n\nBiography:\n\nMajor Cahill is an Army Medical Officer, currently completing a clinical year in Acute Medicine at John Hunter Hospital. Commissioning in 2011, he has had sequential postings to operational units in the Australian Army and has international and domestic operational experience as a Regimental Medical Officer.\n\nMajor Cahill is a Fellow of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, a Defence Aviation Medical Officer and enrolled in Master of Medicine (Critical Care Medicine).\n\nCorresponding author name: Andrew Cahill\n\nCorresponding author email: andrew.cahill@defence.gov.au\n\nEnvironmental exposures on deployment and reproductive health: What’s the deal, baby?\n\nDr Rachelle Warner1,2 , Dr Jodie Avery1,2, Associate Professor Susan Neuhaus1, Professor Michael Davies1,2\n\nUniversity of Adelaide, Australia\n\nRobinson Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia\n\nMilitary personnel deployed on operations may encounter a variety of hazards with the capacity to adversely affect reproductive health. This paper investigates the association between self-reported exposure to reproductive toxicants and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Australian Defence Force veterans who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan during the period 2001–2009. Utilising the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) Census Study data set, descriptive analyses of participants’ self-reported exposure were compared with the occupational environmental monitoring data taken at their reported deployment location. Univariate analyses assessed the significance of unadjusted associations between self-reported exposures and reproductive outcomes. Overall, self-reported adverse reproductive outcomes were significantly increased in veterans who deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq (p = 0.04) compared to those who only deployed to only one of those locations; particularly in women (p = 0.009). Miscarriage was the most likely of these (p = 0.008). These figures would benefit from being confirmed against medical records but are worthy of further study. In this historical cohort study, causal inference cannot be made due to absence of control groups to exclude sources of potential bias. Imprecision in the assessment of environmental hazards in the MEAO and other methodological constraints make it impossible to calculate precise estimates of risk.

Preservation of the deployed force requires that medical officers are experts in primary care and occupational medicine. Accordingly, when not deployed, most full-time ADF medical officers augment the experience gained in garrison health support by engaging in clinical placements in general practice or civilian emergency departments. This model of learning produces broadly skilled medical officers well equipped to meet the needs of disease non-battle casualties.\n\nBut what about trauma? Australian service members deploy on operations confident in the expectation that, if they are wounded, they will receive best- practice trauma care. In recent years, work has begun on an Operational Clinical Skill Set (OCSS) for deployed general surgeons, recognising the growing gap between military and civilian practice. Likewise, it has been recognised by many authors that routine civilian clinical activity offers variable exposure to the situations surgeons may encounter in the field; there is a need for a purposeful approach to learning – an Operational Clinical Readiness Pathway (OCRP). This is equally the case for generalist medical officers. Civilian primary care and emergency department placements do not offer the concentrated experience of in-hospital trauma management necessary to allow non-specialists to care for injured soldiers in the wards, or while awaiting evacuation and onward movement.\n\nIn this presentation, we propose a pilot program in which general duties medical officers are offered the opportunity to be embedded within an admitting trauma unit for a period of four weeks. This period of clinical immersion will enable attainment of pre- defined learning objectives centring on the knowledge and skills required to provide comprehensive medical care to trauma casualties in the period following initial resuscitation and damage control surgery. Key competences would include tertiary survey completion, prevention and recognition of common complications of trauma, and understanding the role of nursing and allied health specialists in trauma care. If successful, we hope to expand the program to include other military health disciplines, acknowledging that it is the entire healthcare team, not isolated experts, who support optimal function of the deployed trauma system. Ultimately, we believe that trauma clinical immersion can emerge as one of many learning experiences within an OCRP that will allow every serving doctor to be a confident and competent trauma clinician.\n\nBiography:\n\nMajor Mahoney is an anaesthetist and intensive care registrar in the ADF Medical Specialist Program seconded to the Royal Hobart Hospital where he is also the Director of Trauma.

Headquarters Middle East exercises command and control of deployed ADF units in the MER through Op Accordion. Op Accordion enables contingency planning and enhancement of regional relationships in the MER by providing communications, force support, airbase operations and health care. Camp Baird has been the home to thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen and women over the past two decades however in the last six months has undergone a substantial decrease of personnel. This draw down process has led to large teams being reduced considerably.\n\nThe AMAB Health facility is currently responsible for the health care of ADF personnel both in location and within the greater MER. The purpose of this presentation is to outline the different roles and responsibilities of an Australian medical technician in a coalition medical facility prior to, during and post the draw down process. Additionally this presentation will outline future planning for a medical facility when expansion is required to support a larger number of personnel.\n\nLastly, this presentation will detail the improvements to training required by medical technicians prior to deploying to a non-warlike environment. This includes the upskilling of medical technicians to perform more advanced medical procedures, AME responsibilities and administrative roles.\n\nThis presentation will expand on the following points:\n\nPreparation and pre-deployment training for medical technicians\n\nThe roles and responsibilities expected of a medical technician\n\nOverview of injury patterns, patient presentation and management\n\nGeneral staffing, layout and services available in the AMAB Medical facility\n\nDifferent standards in training and treatment between different coalition forces\n\nImprovements in training inclusive of specific training deemed pertinent for a medical technician prior to deployment in non-warlike\n\nThe presenter will cover topics mentioned above during the presentation. They will outline the importance for improvement in pre-deployment training for a Medical Technician and how best we prepare ADF medical personnel for changes in circumstances on operations. This information is especially relevant as their role both nationally and internationally is constantly transforming. The threats to coalition personnel are rarely consistent; therefore, in order to be ready for the next mission, Medical Technicians need to be adaptable and prepared.\n\nBiography:\n\nCPL Allana Smith enlisted into the Australian Regular Army in the Royal Australian Medical Corp as a Medical Technician on 24 February 2014.\n\nOn the completion of the Australian Defence Force Medical Course CPL Smith was posted to the 1st Close Health Battalion based in Darwin, Northern Territory.\n\nShe deployed with 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment on Operation AUGURY to the Philippines in 2018.

The competitions at the time provided sub-units with the opportunity to strive for excellence in the provision of forward medical care in a simulated field environment. Due to operational tempo requirements and incremental training liabilities, Army wide inter- unit competitions in health units have ceased to exist and have not been conducted over an extended period of time.\n\nThe Forward Medicine competition will be a premier event to test the skills and prowess of teams of Health personnel from across the country. The event/activity is designed to test the Tactical Combat Casualty skill set over a wide variety of tactical medicine components. Teams will be faced with a Full Mission Profile scenario that will play over a series of phases, with each phase, the scenario will unfold a little further. The overall scenario will be physically demanding and teams should be prepared for exertion over an extended period. Teams will have the opportunity to challenge themselves, push themselves hard, and excel beyond any obstacles they face.\n\nThe Forward Medicine Competition (FMC) should be considered a high yield solution to cement Tactical Medicine as the centre of health training excellence and reinforce the Medical Technician brand and to set the standard for clinical training and commensurate with our coalition partners\n\nThe Global War On Terror seen a period of intensive kinetic operations, health training must not lose the momentum gained and should continue to focus the training of health personnel, in particular Medical Technicians, in the forward space to maintain “core combat and operational behaviours”. The centrepiece for these behaviours is Tactical Combat Casualty Care principles that encompass Point of Injury Care, stabilisation, prolonged field care and the rapid and effective evacuation to the appropriate Medical Treatment facility.\n\nWith the new Army Health reformation structure with four integrated elements that have distinct identities, the activity could serve as a great opportunity to build unit cohesion, dare say it rivalry and a pride in unit capability. Furthermore, the advent of JMED course, there is no reason why this competition could not eventually incorporate Medical Technicians from across the three services.\n\nThe development of the event/competition could also lead to the establishment of an Australian version of the American Expert Field Medical Badge. Recognition of the skills of a tactical medical capability is something we should continue to invest in, support and reward.\n\nBiography:\n\nMajor Robertson has served in Army Health Services for more than 30 years firstly as a Medic and then commissioned for the last 10 years.

What is the role of the health professional in this claims process and what can you recommend to your transitioning patients to assist them?\n\nThe panel of Defence and DVA representatives will provide answers to these questions and others, and use case studies to explore the issues. We will discuss the medical separation process, GP referrals, Defence and DVA support services, and the process for compensation claims, which are required to activate some of these supports.\n\nWe will help to demystify the claims process and provide insights about how healthcare professionals can best support a swift and efficient passage of claims, while minimising unnecessary paperwork. And we will dispel the myth that healthcare professionals need a detailed understanding of the complex Acts that define compensation and rather focus on the importance that clinical knowledge and expertise brings to the claims process.\n\nDVA will highlight the health-based initiatives in place to ensure transitioned members and veterans can receive the health treatments and services they need, even if their claims have not yet been finalised.\n\nDefence will outline the support available to transitioning members both from within health and more broadly across Defence.\n\nAttendees will gain important insights about the transition process and their role in helping members have a positive transition experience and enter civilian life better prepared for lifelong health and wellbeing.\n\nBiography:\n\nProfessor Jenny Firman AM completed her medical degree at University of Melbourne and while a student joined the Royal Australian Navy.

The manualised 12-week program is adjunctive to normal mental health (MH) care in that it is community based and aimed at psychoeducation and skills for stabilisation and recovery from a transdiagnostic perspective. It also unique in the way in which it is culturally specific and delivered by peers. This presentation will describe the preliminary clinical outcomes of the program evaluation (DDVA271-20) to date.\n\nMethods: The MVFR participants’ individual pre- and post-program primary clinical outcomes of psychological distress (K-10); Depression (PHQ-9); Anxiety (GAD-7); Anger (DAR-5); post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PCL) scores; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); Resilience (BRS) and Disability (SDS) will be discussed. Emotional Regulation (ER), as measured by the Dimensions of Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-SF), is hypothesised to be strongly associated with all outcomes.\n\nResults: The individual results from participants (N=58 as at the time of this abstract) who have completed the program demonstrate statistically significant pre-post changes on all measures except resilience and disruption to work. There is a strong association between ER and all measures, suggesting that ER skills moderate symptoms of psychological distress and therefore ER is a key skill for stabilisation and functioning.\n\nConclusion: Emotional dysregulation underlies many of the symptoms of psychological distress in the MVFR population. Per led transdiagnostic psychoeducation and skills-based stabilisation programs for stress and trauma disorders are both novel and potentially effective programs to support clinical treatment. This is particularly relevant for MVFR populations due to the high occupational risk for these conditions.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr Lane, FRANZCP, MBBS (Hons), has been in the Army for over 30 years and an Afghanistan veteran.

A Holistic Service for Veterans and Serving Members\n\nDr Gavin Angus-leppan1 , Dr The Chow Chow1\n\n1 Ncvh, Concord Hospital, Concord, Sydney, Australia\n\nThe unique and complex nature of the veteran’s health create major obstacles to establishing wellbeing. This presentation will explore our experiences at The National Centre for Veterans Health Care with veterans and serving members suffering physical, psychological and substance use issues. This multidisciplinary service offers integrated care from a range of specialties. We discuss two cases which exemplify the challenges arising from interactions between multiple diagnoses, multiple professional stakeholders and multiple therapeutic regimes. Some of the problems we have encountered include overlapping polypharmacy, the stigma of mental health care, the early use of irreversible surgical treatments, psychological blocks to good response to medical treatment and issues around perceived legitimacy of medical complaints in the context of a psychological disorder. We see these issues as particularly pertinent to the areas of pain and trauma.\n\nArising from experiences, we reflect on the benefits of a multidisciplinary team with regular and efficient communication between its members and of the identification of interactions, both pharmacological and psychosocial. Multiple perspectives on and interactions with patients have yielded a richer understanding and deeper engagement with patients. For instance, a patients increased awareness of the specific and personal meaning and associations of their pain helps disentangle the experience of pain from other issues. The acknowledgement of multiplicity of needs has also fostered a sense of containment and help alleviate the distress of patients troubled by competing issues.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr Gavin Angus-Leppan is a Psychiatrist with an interest in Psychosomatic Medicine, Trauma and Psychotherapy including EMDR.

At the same time, the military medical system must maintain functioning links with equally complex external agencies such as the wider Australian health system, the Departments of Health and Veterans Affairs, a large contracted health workforce and, of course, the ADF’s war- fighting elements that rely on our support to achieve their mission.\n\nSo how do our health leaders navigate this complex web of organisational challenges in an ever changing global and domestic environment? Do we devolve decision making down to the lowest level practical and empower junior leaders and clinicians? Or do we embrace the opposite approach – pushing all decision making and health policy to the very top, to those isolated from the patient and the mission and risk paralysing the health system in the process? I think we intuitively know the answer lies somewhere in between those extremes, but this illustrates a dilemma faced by those in the ADF health system today.\n\nThe judicious application of Mission Command in health organisations, has the potential to shift the focus from centralised decision making, to empowered leaders and clinicians at the tactical level who are focused on achieving the mission in line with the Commander’s Intent. At its foundation, the idea of mission command recognises that once we move from planning to execution things can and do change. It recognises that the speed of decision making and agility can sometimes be the difference between mission success and mission failure. An equally important concept that underpins Mission Command is that usually, the person best placed to make timely decisions is the one doing the job. A brief analysis of history will show that mission command has and does win wars, but only if the principles are practiced in peacetime too. It is not easy, and will require investment in our junior leaders and increased agility from our senior leaders moving forward.\n\nThere is no prescription and no endorsed leadership style – our health leaders will need to adapt, frequently, and sometimes outside of their comfort zone. It is a skill that requires investment and often years of practice. Leadership is hard to get right – it is difficult to be all things to all people when the lens through which we view leadership is subjective and we each have our own opinion of ‘what right looks like’ when it comes to health leadership. But we can and should do more to improve – so as not to fail our junior leaders of the future if/when the flag goes up. Encountering this reality for the first time in “the face of battle” will likely have dire consequences. Preparation for the inevitable demands of this environment should, therefore, start now and, arguably, be built into the “DNA” of our peacetime health systems.\n\nBiography:\n\nKelly Dunne, CSC, BA, MHM, MMDS, is a Lieutenant Colonel working in the Directorate of Army Health as part of Army Headquarters.

There is also no current drug treatment for hearing loss.\n\nRecently there has been a paradigm shift in the laboratory and clinical understanding of the onset and progression of hearing loss due to noise exposure. Our new understanding of the ‘hidden hearing loss’ due to damage to the nerves in the inner ear suggests that hearing loss may be well advanced before the standard hearing test (i.e. the audiogram) used for decades in military and other populations detects any deficits. It also suggests new drug treatments targeting this nerve loss may be more achievable than previously thought.\n\nHere we outline recent studies by our group and others indicating that new devices, new tests and new drug therapeutics are needed and on the foreseeable horizon for detection and mitigation of hearing loss in military and civilian populations. We describe the results of our studies of mobile hearing test devices in and hidden hearing loss in soldiers from Victoria and Simpson barracks. We also outline our translational studies into nerve growth factors as a possible drug treatment for noise-induced hearing loss and recent clinical trials of these drugs for treating hearing loss.\n\nBiography:\n\nDr Sly is Chief Operating Officer – Research at the Ear Science Institute Australia.

However, war is about much more than combat or the technologies we fight with, and focusing on weaponry may blind us to the broader social, political and cultural context and effects of these technologies on the humans who constitute our militaries. The potential of exposing military members to fertility compromise is both a physical and a moral issue. Exposure to reproductive toxicants, side effects of protective equipment and medical prophylaxis, and the potential to weaponize biological or chemical substances that could cause infertility are issues that should be considered rigorously. This paper considers emerging threats, both current and futuristic, to the reproductive health of military veterans and the implications for preventative medicine policy.\n\nBiography:\n\nRachelle Bonner joined the public service as a multitasking ninja, and that pretty much describes her career to date.

Physiological measures provide a quantitative evaluation of user response to certain stimuli in these computer- generated synthetic environments, or “virtual environments”, and can provide a feedback loop to significantly improve user experience and performance in such environments.\n\nThis presentation will explore how biofeedback technologies and approaches are being used within AI enabled XR systems for training and/or educational applications. The biosignals explored provide insights into physiological and/or emotional processes in users/participants. The presentation will discuss how biometric feedback is used in XR technologies, with a focus on specific biofeedback sensor use in the context of simulation training and education, concluding with recommendations about how biometrics can appropriately be used in XR synthetic training systems.\n\nMethod\n\nA systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines looking at ‘What biofeedback technologies and approaches are being used within AI enabled XR systems for training and/or educational applications?’. An initial scoping search of existing research revealed many theoretical and untested-on- human concepts and approaches. From this scoping search, the key inclusion criteria for this literature review were defined. Of importance is that the included biofeedback enabled systems are validated on real human participants and therefore provide actual experiment results. A total of 803 studies were identified for screening and post evaluation, 48 met the search criteria and were included for analysis.\n\nResults:\n\nA total of 11 different biosignals were captured across the different studies. When considering the use of biosignals by primary measure, stress made use of the most individual biosignal types. Electrodermal activity, also referred to as galvanic skin response (GSR), was the most widely used biosignal, with most application in the measurement of stress, cognitive load, and emotions. Eye tracking was also frequently used in the measurement of stress, cognitive load, and attention.\n\nA total of 42 different biosensor devices were identified in the resultant studies. These sensors covered a range of different implementation approaches, from purpose-built integrations, experimental lab setups, and implementations using commercial off-the-shelf equipment.\n\nEach of the biosignals in the studies enables biofeedback mechanisms and can form the basis of AI/machine learning approaches to remove artifacts, process signals into usable data, and/or identify patterns. The biosignals themselves provide insights into physiological and/or emotional processes in users/participants.\n\nConclusion & recommendations\n\nThis paper summarises current research implementing XR technologies in combination with biofeedback and AI approaches, with a focus on the specific biofeedback sensor use in the context of simulation training or education contexts. Several important recommendations emerge from the research, including:\n\nA minimum of two biosignals should be captured where possible, and thus devices that capture multiple biosignals are preferred.\n\nThe use of simpler sensor technologies and associated measures is preferred to limit the impact of movement artifacts and maximise reliability of data. Wristband devices present as particularly useful devices for biofeedback implementations in XR simulation training applications.\n\nGiven the dynamic innovation occurring in biosensing technology, implementations of biofeedback enabled XR synthetic training systems should focus on identifying appropriate biosignals and actuation of biofeedback in virtual environments and tasks. A “plug and play” approach to sensing technology is recommended, allowing sensing technologies to be updated/upgraded overtime while the fundamental benefits of the biofeedback implementation are retained. As such, details regarding integration of biosensing technologies with synthetic environment development tools (ie. game engines) should be a focus of development approaches.\n\nBiography:\n\nBen is the Co-Founder & Director of Future Projects at Real Response, he is also a Registered Paramedic with 15+ years of domestic and international pre- hospital experience.

Caring for our nation’s older veterans\n\nMr Nathan Klinge1\n\n1 RSL Care SA, Australia\n\n993,000 Australians served in the military forces during WW2 representing around 14% of the total population at the time, whereas only just under 60,000 Australians served in the Vietnam War, representing well under 1%.\n\nVeterans from the Vietnam era are now moving through their later years into aged care, where veterans as a whole represent an ever-diminishing population in aged care as the WWII numbers dwindle. The impact of this will see a much-reduced capacity within the residential aged care sector to respond to the cultural and social care needs of veterans, given it is likely in the years ahead a provider operating a 100+ bed facility may only have one lone war veteran in their care.\n\nPrevious generations of veterans from WW1 and WWII have held a much more prominent and visible place within our aged sector, which in those times created more opportunities for aged care providers to facilitate appropriate care outcomes for veterans and their peers. So, what will happen to those from the Vietnam War era and beyond?\n\nWhile there has been much focus in recent years on the transitional requirements of younger veterans leaving the ADF, little attention has been placed on the ‘transition’ of Vietnam Veterans as they move through into the later years of their life.\n\nAt RSL Care SA we believe that ageing is simply another of life’s transitions, and like all transitions, if its managed appropriately it can be done well and to the veteran’s advantage.\n\nSo what do we know?\n\nWhen a veteran has a complex mental health background, their interaction with caregivers and services within the aged care industry may be adversely affected. Furthermore, older veterans with complex physical and mental health conditions have additional care requirements, and these cannot always be met within the existing skillsets and experiences of the aged care industry. In particular:\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and impact on early ageing – People with PTSD can find that the ageing process exacerbates pre-existing PTSD symptoms. Medical illness and reduced physical ability may mean the individual is unable to manage symptoms using previous coping strategies, and concurrently their retirement from work and fewer family responsibilities can mean fewer distractions from their PTSD symptoms.\n\nSocial isolation – Experiences of social isolation throughout a veteran’s life can pose ongoing health and wellbeing risks for them as they age, particularly for those who live alone, have smaller social networks, and who have fewer opportunities to engage in meaningful social activities.\n\nDementia – Veterans with PTSD or who have been wounded in combat have significantly higher risk of developing dementia, when compared with groups without PTSD or who were not wounded in combat.\n\nVeteran culture. In the past the aged care sector was quite well-informed with respect to the idiosyncrasies of veteran culture, partly due to the sheer weight of numbers that veterans held in the aged care community, but also because many of the caregivers themselves had direct family links to the WW1 or WWII veteran communities (or both). Increasingly however the veteran population represents a much smaller percentage of the aged care community and many of the care providers themselves come from overseas, meaning that the industry has largely lost its intrinsic capacity to meet the culture needs of our older veterans.\n\nThis presentation discusses the aged care sector’s capacity to provide culturally safe and person- centred care for veterans.\n\nSuggestions will be provided to enable ESOs and other members of the veteran community to strengthen the aged care sector’s ability to better cope with the changing needs of our emerging and ageing veteran populations.\n\nBiography:\n\nWith over 23 years of full-time military experience, and now being employed as a CEO in aged care, Nathan has served in a variety of leadership, management and training positions. Nathan has served as a Director on a variety of not-for-profit boards, and he represents veteran health issues on South Australia’s Veterans Advisory Council and on SA Health’s Veterans Health Advisory Council.

The implementation of TCCC concepts has application in prehospital casualties beyond combat trauma, particularly with respect to treatment priorities, procedures and management of evacuation care goals.\n\nContemporary military forces have implemented widespread TCCC at the basic level, which the ADF has included as a tenet of combat behaviours within foundation warfighting. The Army School of Health (ASH) has developed and implemented a training continuum for all health care providers to adopt the TCCC Medical Provider proficiency, which incorporates further procedural and clinical interactions to support tactical field care and evacuation to a destination treatment facility.\n\nThe implementation of the TCCC (MP) as endorsed by Director of Army Health, enables enhanced provision of care in austere and remote environments to include haemorrhage control, airway management, fluid resuscitation, analgesia, antibiotics and high impact clinical techniques as important adjuncts toward providing the best possible care in an environment characterised by limited resources and prolonged evacuation timelines. A session presented by the Senior Medical Technicians of the Health Battalions will outline the developmental background, endorsed deliverables and the implementation of the TCCC (MP) into training establishment and deployable training programs.\n\nBiography WO1 Robbie Cuttler WO1 Chris Owen WO1 Joel Travica WO1 Ade Brooks\n\nIntegrated Aeromedical Support to the US Marine Corps in the Northern Territory\n\nMr Mick Frewen, Dr Paul Hanley\n\nCareFlight will present on six years of fully integrated aeromedical support to the United States Marine Corps (USMC) in the Northern Territory.\n\nCareFlight has been providing contracted aeromedical support to the USMC exercises and training activities in the Northern Territory for the last six years, across some of the most remote military training areas in the country.

Integral to the success of the Operation was a range of operational health effects delivered by small teams of personnel from a variety of military and civilian backgrounds. Despite the significant risk, relentless tempo and multiple agencies involved, the Operation was deemed a resounding success, with 4100 people evacuated by Australian government agencies in a two week period.\n\nThis oral presentation will describe circumstances on the ground in Kabul and at Al Minhad Air Base in August 2021, and share observations that may be of interest to military medicine leaders and practitioners in other high tempo and complex settings. Lessons from the evacuation may assist in shaping a “pathway to the future” with a more apposite appreciation of military medical risk, an understanding of the unique strengths of medical practitioners, and an example of how technical control of health capabilities might be exercised in volatile and uncertain environments.\n\nLessons from the evacuation Operation include the importance of building resilience in teams, foundational skills and knowledge, trust, and a goal- focussed culture. The presentation will also highlight how the principles of “mission command”, well-used in combat operations, are indispensable to military medical practice in complex environments.\n\nBiography:\n\nLieutenant Colonel Adamson is the Senior Medical Officer at the Directorate of Army Health in Canberra.

This was a major escalation of the armed conflict between these two states that began with the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014.\n\nAs at 29 June it has been estimated that the Ukraine military have sustained more than 10,000 killed and 30,000 wounded personnel. In this same period it is estimated that the Russian military have sustained 16,000 killed with an unknown number of wounded.\n\nThe civilian population of the Ukraine has also been heavily affected by the invasion with the United Nations estimating that 4,731 have been killed and 5,900 wounded in the conflict as at 26 June, with 7.1 million people internally displaced and 7.3 million refugees leaving the country.\n\nThe Ukrainian civilian health system has been placed under overwhelming pressure due to the number of civilian and military casualties, and numerous attacks affecting civilian health assets where 76 people have died and 59 have been injured in 295 separate incidents up to 15 June.\n\nInformation available from publicly accessible sources including the United Nations, World Health Organization, United States and United Kingdom government and non-government agencies, Medline, Google Scholar, medical journals, media organisations and investigative journalism groups was collected and analysed. Information relevant to the medical aspects of the conflict including casualty numbers and rates, types and patterns of injury, battle versus non-battle injuries, medical support to military forces and the civilian population, disease threats, and effects on the existing Ukrainian health infrastructure was identified and collated. The collected information was analysed to create a picture of the medical aspects of the war, and to identify learning points for ADF health services.\n\nBiography:\n\nColonel Chambers is currently the Director of Clinical Services at Headquarters 17 Sustainment Brigade. He has served in multiple command appointments including Commanding Officer 3rd Health Support Battalion from 2018 to 2020.

London, FRCS – 1983\n\nThe geostrategic picture in the Indo-Pacific is changing, and the risk of near-peer conflict in our region increasing. As military health practitioners, we face these strategic circumstances with a major capability acquisition based on decisions made well over a decade ago when small wars and counter-insurgency were the principal war fighting paradigm. We are grappling with a pivot away from delivering health support in secure, low intensity conflict to volatile liminal zones that require a truly joint approach; and a pervading mindset that strives for gold standard care in non-gold standard environments.\n\nAt times of great change, it is easy to think the problems we are facing are unprecedented. Rarely however is this the case. As GEN (retd.) James Mattis said;\n\n‘Ultimately a real understanding of history means we face nothing new under the sun.’\n\nThis presentation will use the case study of the British Armed Forces campaign in the Falkland Islands in 1982 to describe previous solutions to current problems in the delivery of littoral and sea- based health care against a sophisticated enemy. It will explore the constraints we may be generating with developing littoral force doctrine and clinical policy framework—constraints that may limit our ability to support large scale manoeuvre forces in a near-peer warfighting environment. It will make recommendations regarding the need for a different approach to risk in clinical governance, capability acquisition and training, to better position us for success in the likely austerity of future combat.\n\nBiography:\n\nMajor Alexander B.

In 2019, Joint Health Command (JHC) published a Feasibility Study, identifying that there was a “military and clinical need for a joint Role 3 capability”. A deployable ADF Role 3 capability will require Neurosurgery as a core specialist area.\n\nMore recently, between November 2020 and November 2021, four Australian Neurosurgeons deployed with an AUS Surgical Team to the US Army’s Role 3 Hospital at BDSC, Iraq as part of the Combined Joint Task Force – Operating Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR).\n\nMethods\n\nA ‘gap analysis’ was performed, exploring the potential for the ADF to provide neurosurgical capability in support of a proposed ADF joint Role 3 capability.\n\nAs part of the analysis, the authors: 1) identify the current state of ADF Neurosurgery, 2) analyse the JHC report on the feasibility of developing an ADF joint Role 3 capability, 3) discuss the gap between the current state of Neurosurgery within the ADF and the required deployable Neurosurgery capability, and 4) propose strategies for closing the gap between current ADF Neurosurgical capability and the requirement to meet the proposed joint Role 3 capability.\n\nResults\n\nAlthough the current cohort of ADF Neurosurgeons are able to meet the capability requirements for a short-term operational Role 3 deployment, there are several areas that need to be addressed if the ADF is to provide a sustainable Neurosurgical capability to the proposed ADF joint Role 3 capability. The authors identify several important capability requirements as part of the “Raise, Train, Sustain” model for providing military capability. These strategies align with the Australian government’s objectives to enhance Defence’s posture and partnerships in the region, and to provide health capabilities that ensure that joint health elements are able to meet Government direction and advance Australian’s strategic interests by shaping Australia’s strategic environment, deterring actions against Australia’s interests, and responding to credible military force when required.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe JHC Feasibility Study clearly determined that there is a military and clinical need for an ADF joint Role 3 capability. A “gap analysis” has identified a performance gap in the areas of specialist health workforce recruitment, skills acquisition & maintenance, and deployment opportunities & career progression for Role 3 specialists that will need to be addressed in order to meet the ADF’s need for a deployable joint Role 3 neurosurgical capability.\n\nBiography:\n\nAssociate Professor Andrew S Davidson (MB BS, MS, PhD, FRACS) is an academic neurosurgeon at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Royal Melbourne Hospital, and Melbourne Private Hospital.

Carey1,2,3\n\n1 School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia\n\n2 Institute of Ethics and Society, The University of Notre Dame, Australia\n\n3 Joint Health Command, Australian Defence Force, Campbell Park, Canberra, Australia\n\n4 School of Historical & Philosophical Inquirey, University of Queensland, Lucia, Australia\n\nIntroduction\n\nInternationally Moral Injury (MI) is an increasingly recognised and widespread syndrome (Koenig & Al Zaben 2021). The Australian Defence Force (ADF) defines MI as ‘a trauma related syndrome caused by the physical, psychological, social and spiritual impact of grievous moral transgressions, or violations, of an individual’s deeply held moral beliefs and/or ethical standards’ (ADF, 2021). Core symptoms commonly identifiable are: (a) shame, (b) guilt, (c) a loss of trust in self, others, and/or transcendental/ultimate beings, and (d) spiritual/ existential conflict including an ontological loss of meaning in life. Secondary symptomatic features include (a) depression, (b) anxiety, (c) anger, (d) re- experiencing the moral conflict, (e) social problems, (f) relationship issues, and ultimately (g) self-harm.\n\nBackground\n\nQualitative and quantitative research previously presented at AMMA (which was bestowed the Weary Dunlop Award 2019), confirmed the presence of MI among the majority of interviewed and surveyed Australian veterans (Hodgson & Carey, 2019; Hodgson et al 2021; 2022). The research also highlighted the potential rehabilitation role of chaplains for addressing veteran MI (Carey, Hodgson, et al. 2016; Hodgson & Carey, 2017; Carey & Hodgson, 2018).\n\nPurpose\n\nThis paper will present further developments since AMMA 2019, with regard to the initiation of a novel and proactive systematic chaplaincy rehabilitation program for ADF veterans experiencing moral injury.\n\nMethod\n\nBased on Australian and international MI"
