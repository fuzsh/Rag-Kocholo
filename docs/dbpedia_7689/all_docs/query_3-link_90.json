        "text": "The 17th Infantry Regiment Distinctive Unit Insignia (DUI), sometimes called a unit crest, was originally approved on 14 October 1924 and highlights some of the unit’s more distinguished engagements up to that point. A white cross in the upper left is taken from the badge of the Union Army’s V corps, with the wall below it signifying the famous defensive fortification at Fredericksburg where so many Soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. The five-bastioned fort recalls V Corps’ insignia during the War With Spain, and the buffalo is taken from the unit’s nickname, “Buffalos,” which in turn was inspired by its commander during World War II, Colonel (later Lt. Gen.) William Wilson “Buffalo Bill” Quinn.\n\nDistinctive Unit Insignias are worn by all Soldiers (except General Officers) in units that have been authorized to be issued the device. It is worn centered on the shoulder loops of the Army Green Service Uniform (AGSU) and the blue Army Service Uniform (ASU, Enlisted only) with the base of the insignia toward the outside shoulder seam. DUIs are not worn on the Dress variations of either uniform, however.\n\nFull guidance on wear of the DUI is found in DA Pamphlet 670-1, Section 21-22, \"Distinctive unit insignia.\"\n\n♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦\n\nLike many Infantry Regiments, the 17th Infantry points to 3 May 1861 as the date it was constituted—the same date on which President Abraham Lincoln called for addition of 40 new regiments in the Union Army, 39 of which were to be Infantry. Organized at Fort Preble in Maine on 6 July 1861, the 17th would go on to take part a dozen campaigns in the Civil War. In 1869, it was consolidated with the 44th Infantry, Veteran Reserve Corps and the new merged unit designated the 17th Infantry. Under this title, the unit would see action in the Indian Wars, War With Spain, Philippine Insurrection, and the Mexican Expedition.\n\nDuring World War II, the Regiment was assigned to the 7th Infantry Division and took part in amphibious assaults in the Aleutian Islands, Marshall Islands, the Ryukyus, and Leyte, earning three Arrowheads for its four campaign streamers. The Regiment was still assigned to the 7th Infantry Division when the Korean War erupted, and spent almost the entire war deployed with the 7th and earning four Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations before returning to the U.S. and being relieved of assignment to the 7th in 1957.\n\nCombat actions since then include participation in four Vietnam War Campaigns, the Panama intervention, and service in Iraq and Afghanistan; it earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for its support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2012 – 2013 and a Valorous Unit Award for its service in Operation Iraqi Freedom, all signs of the Regiment’s commitment to “Truth And Courage.”"
