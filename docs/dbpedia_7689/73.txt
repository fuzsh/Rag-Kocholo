The Regular Army Battalions of the Welsh Regiment issued service number 9711 at some point between the 20th January 1908 (9632) and the 26th January 1909 (10015).

The most common enlistment term by this point was three years in the colours and nine in the reserves, although other options were available. A surviving daily order for the 2nd Battalion Welsh Regiment at Bordon Camp on the 8th December 1913 shows he stayed with the colours at a bit longer. In a list of men approved for furlough there is a 9711 Private A. Cain of 'A' Company.

He also previously been recorded on the 1911 Census of England & Wales as a Private of the 2nd Battalion The Welch* Regiment who were then in Barracks at Pembroke Docks.

(* I won't get dragged into which spelling is correct. It seems both were in use).

His Medal Index Card shows he landed in France on the 13th August 1914 with the 2nd Welsh Regiment. Our parent site shows the 2nd Battalion at Bordon Camp at the outbreak of war, moving to the Le Havre on the 13th August 1914.

His Medal Index Card has a note in the remarks section "Trans 22.1.16". I suspect that was the date that he was transferred to the Machine Gun Corps and was issued with the service number 19380.

It can be very difficult to track movements of Machine Gun Corps men without their service records. The Machine Gun Corps only came into being towards the end of 1915 and Machine Gun sections of Infantry Battalions only moved into it as sufficent Lewis Guns became available to allow the Infantry Battalion to maintain firepower.

Assuming Alfred was still with the 2nd Battalion Welsh Regiment then they were in the 3rd Brigade with the:-

1st Battalion South Wales Borderers

1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment

2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers

On the 26th January 1916 the 3rd Machine Company came into being, and comprised the rebadged former members of the Machine Gun sections of all four Battalions.

Unfortunately that can't be taken from granted - if he'd been medically evacuated back to the UK then on recovery he could have ended up posted to the MGC.

One of the sources that can sometimes help is the Victory Medal and British War Medal Service Medal Roll, (Ancestry only), but the MGC is a serial offender when it comes to a complete lack of information - even the unit served with is not stated.

If he married during the time he was serving, or the marriage produced children, then the related certificates should at a minimum show the grooms\ fathers rank and regiment\Corps and sometimes much more.

There is also the potentially details about his unit on the 1918 & 1919 Absent Voters lists - see here for how this can help https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/soldiers/how-to-research-a-soldier/finding-soldiers-through-the-1918-absent-voters-lists/

Hope that gets you started,
