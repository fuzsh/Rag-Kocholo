The Wedding of 17-year old King Farouk of Egypt and 16-year old Safinaz Zulficar (soon renamed Queen Farida, wearing her Diamond Peacock Tiara) at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo on this day in 1938. The couple had three daughters and divorced in 1948, due to the lack of a male heir. The King remarried in 1951, and was forced into exile the following year.
