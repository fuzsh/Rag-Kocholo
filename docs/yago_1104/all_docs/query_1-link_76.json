All together, they form unyielding pages of history that remain there with the truths for all to discover and contemplate.\n\nThis Book, Farida, the Queen of Egypt, a memoir of Love and Governance, is the authentic love story of Safinaz Zul-Faquar, who later took the royal name Queen Farida, and the young Prince of Egypt, Farouk the First. It is the story that the late queen told in her own words, as she described the joyful times she had as a young teen falling in love with this handsome young adolescent Prince Farouk, who was about to be crowned the King of Egypt. Talking about how she was enthralled into the romance of her life, when King Farouk chose her to be his wife and the Queen of Egypt.\n\nQueen Farida’s story describes her love for Farouk and her passion for wanting to make her life at the Royal Palace, the fairytale every young girl dreams about. It also describes her struggles with the Royal Palace Court and the King’s entourage of assistants and servants, who vied for controlling the palace life over her will. Farida describes how she fought the Palace corruption and how she tried to protect Farouk, who was constantly steered towards the life of lust and women and not the life of an honorable King, husband and father and a model for his people?\n\nFarida described how it all ended, after eleven years of persistence to make it right, with no options but to demand her divorce from King Farouk. With her divorce in 1948, hell broke loose over Farouk’s incompetence and the tragedies mounted leading to his humiliation and ultimate exile to Italy, on July 26th, 1952, after the Egyptian Military Revolution.\n\nFarida’s life story continues when she turned to Art, after her divorce and losing her crown. Art became her passion and the way for her salvation after her troubled marriage and the overthrow of her husband King Farouk. She describes her long journey moving from one place to another, her financial highs and lows, when she could not meet her own living expenses. She describes how she met the three Egyptian Presidents, Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak, in search for a decent life in her homeland, Egypt, by the Nile and the Pyramids.\n\nAll in all, this book is the story of Queen Farida’s life with the ups and downs that characterized her life’s struggle for no fault of her own. It was just her destiny and she remembered every part of it as if they were just happening.\n\nTranslator’s Preface\n\nMy first and only meeting with the late Queen Farida was in the summer of 1986, at my sister-in-law’s residence in Zamalek, Cairo, Egypt. My wife Mouchira and I were visiting her sister, Mervat M. Mumtaz, in the summer of 1986. Queen Farida, the cousin of Dr. Hassan Mumtaz, Mervat’s husband, was also visiting. Our meeting was a brief social meeting in which Queen Farida talked about her artworks, among other topics. Because my wife and I had been living in the United States for many years, I talked to Queen Farida about the possibility of arranging an art exhibit for her in the United States. At the time, I felt an exhibit for the queen’s artwork in Princeton, New Jersey, would offer a great opportunity for her and an opening for exhibitions all over the United States.\n\nAfter our meeting in Zamalek, I wanted to pursue my offer to Queen Farida, but unfortunately as time passed us by, we never had the opportunity to do that. Two years later, I learned of her passing, closing the chapter on that possibility.\n\nIn 2006, many years later, I met Ambassador Farouk Hashem in Cairo. My wife and I were invited to dinner at his home in Heliopolis. That was the start of a long relationship with the Hashem’s since. During our dinner conversation, the subject of Queen Farida came up, and the idea of this translation came about. Ambassador Hashem told me about his book that he had published in Arabic years earlier about the queen. It was of great interest to both of us to have it translated into the English language for publication in the United States.\n\nIt took a great deal of effort to give this book the best presentation possible. Translating from the rich Arabic language to English was not an easy task. Although I wanted to ensure the most authentic translation I could, I quickly recognized that a literal word-for-word translation would lose all the beauty of the book and the essence of the compelling story of Queen Farida. As such, this book presents the struggles and triumphs of Queen Farida based on the Arabic narrative of my friend and colleague, Farouk Hashem.\n\nFarida, The Queen of Egypt: Memories of Love and Governance is presented as a novel on the life of the queen; her love story with her knight in shining armor, King Farouk; and his struggles with the governance of the country, Egypt. As a witness to the events from the halls inside the royal palace and through her eleven years as the queen of Egypt (January, 1938- November 17th, 1948). Queen Farida told her story to Ambassador Farouk Hashem.\n\nThe book includes rare photographs of the queen’s life inside and outside the royal palace. Copies of some of her artworks and official royal declarations are included. I have also included other documents from the Egyptian Revolutionary Council, exiling King Farouk on July 26, 1952. These documents are included as appendices.\n\nMorad Abou-Sabe’, PhD\n\nPrinceton, New Jersey\n\nAuthor’s Preface\n\nThis book is not a diary of the late Queen Farida, the queen of Egypt. Nor is it a book about the political history of Egypt during her tenure as the first lady of Egypt for eleven years when she lived as the devoted wife and companion for King Farouk. It is a collection of memories of the late queen that she narrated to me, where I was the quiet, attentive listener. It is a semblance of memories that were flowing from the natural ability of a storyteller. That was Farida. It was not an intended narration to me. Nor did I lure her to tell it. The friendship between us prompted her to express her story to me. It was indeed a reflection of what transpired throughout her life. I was there for her whenever we had the opportunity and clarity of mind to discuss the events she wanted to talk about.\n\nI saw her smiling, heard her laughing, and saw her upset and angry when it was necessary. I was with her through her most difficult moments, and there were many, but at no time did I see her showing any bitterness. With her pride, she overcame pain, the kind that most—except for the rare ones—would succumb to. Her artistic spirit held her fragile body high above the tragedy that had befallen her throughout her adult life. Painting was her sanctuary and brought her comfort.\n\nAfter the opening of one of her art exhibits one evening, she told me, Art saved me from insanity.\n\nShe was proud and shy, quiet but firm, but she had softness in her voice that spelled determination and strong will. She described a great deal of the ups and downs in her lifelong journey. There she faced with strong determination the debauchery and disarray in the affairs of the royal palace. She expressed her disapproval and disgust over all that had been happening behind the closed doors of the palace. She talked about how she resisted falling to these ills with stubbornness and without any concern for her crown and the royal position she held. She would have no hesitation giving it all up, rejecting Farouk and the royal life she had come into. She eventually did when she asked for her divorce eleven years later. She had the sincerest of intentions to be the loyal queen to the king she loved and married, but not at the expense of her pride, honor, and dignity. She preferred to keep her dignity and the love of the Egyptian people despite her concerns over the kingdom and Farouk himself. She recognized that exposing the palace corruption could only be done as a living witness on the inside.\n\nFarida remained a reservoir of the secrets of the palace, where everything was held tightly inside here until the writing of this book. These memories can only be told with confidence and honesty, as Farida herself did. It is, after all, her personal memories.\n\nShe was like a fortune-teller when she told me, I told you a great deal about myself that no one else knows. Do you think you’ll write a book about me?\n\nI smiled but gave no answer. I was seeing her off at the airport in Bahrain. She was going to see her daughters in Switzerland when she told me that. I had not actually thought of writing this book until that moment. As the plane flew into the skies, I answered to myself, Why not? Why couldn’t there be a book about Farida. I’ll do that someday.\n\nHere I am, writing this book. No historical format compels me, as would have been necessary were it a historical narrative. I write it without any chronology. It’s a story that someone told me, the same person who was remembering, at times with great agony, the events that shaped her life and, I might add, the life of a nation at a time when she had the inside story of what was actually happening.\n\nFarouk Hashem\n\nHeliopolis, Cairo, Egypt\n\nHow I Met the Queen\n\nI did not know Farida, the former queen of Egypt, before 1976, except through her pictures in the newspapers and magazines. That year, I was working as a consular at the Egyptian Embassy in London. I was participating as the Egyptian representative in the preparation for a festival for the arts and civilization of the Islamic world with all of its regions. At that time, Queen Farida was living in Paris and had specifically come to London to attend the festival. There, I was introduced to her for the first time and learned of her interest in Islamic art. After the festival was over, Queen Farida left London with a promise that we would stay in touch and continue our dialogue about art.\n\nIslamic art occupied a great deal of Queen Farida’s thoughts. It reflected her innermost beliefs. I kept my promise and made sure throughout my service in London to always be in touch with her. I also followed up on her intellectual and artistic activities in Paris and shared my own with her from London until I completed my services at the Embassy and returned to Egypt.\n\nIn 1986, ten years later, I saw Queen Farida again. My wife and I were attending a dinner party, and to our surprise, the queen was right there. There, we had the opportunity through our host and his family to have an elegant private evening at a gathering that was primarily a family dinner.\n\nThat evening, the former queen was graceful without pretense. She was simple and fragile in her own way. The evening extended well after dinner to the wee hours of the morning until dawn. Her conversation was so enlightening that we did not feel the hours passing us by. After all, she was talking among friends. She told us about her life since she was a child and about her family. She told us how Safinaz (her birth name) met King Farouk. She told us about the engagement, the royal trip and the way her marriage was consummated. She talked about how she and Farouk differed and how their differences led to her decision after eleven years of marriage to end it all and ask for her divorce. She talked about the king’s sisters and"
