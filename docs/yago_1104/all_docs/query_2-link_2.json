        "text": "A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.\n\nThe Queen, an Egyptian, was married to the young Farouk in 1939. The wedding, carried out accordina to strict Islamic custom at the time, was held in her absence, though with great fanfare and pageantry. After the wedding, she was renamed Farida in accordance with the tradition that all members of the royal family have the same initial.\n\nIn 1948, Farouk divorced her after she had given birth to three daughters but failed to produce a male heir. The divorce aroused both great interest and antipathy in the West, both because of Farida's youth and beauty and because the King was regarded by many as the personification of a corrupt old order.\n\nAt the same time as Farida was divorced, King Farouk's sister, Queen Fawzia, described in the press as one of the world's most beautiful women, was divorced by the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi."
