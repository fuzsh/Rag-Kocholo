        "text": "Princess Fawzia-Latifa, the youngest granddaughter of HRH King Farouk I of Egypt, and the daughter of the last reigning monarch of Egypt, Crown Prince Ahmed Fouad, is set to get married this weekend. The 36-year-old is tying the knot with a French engineer named Sylvain Honoudou who resides in the Principality of Monaco. The wedding will take place at her father’s residence in Geneva on Saturday, January 19. According to sources, the soon-to-be newly-weds will say “I do” in the presence of their close friends and family, including her mother Princess Fadila of Egypt and her brothers Prince Fakhruddin, Prince Mohammed Ali, and his wife, Afghan Princess Noal.\n\nThough little is known about the couple’s romance, it is likely that Princess Fawzia met Honoudo in Monaco, where she was born. It’s not the only royal wedding happening in 2019 either. Grace Kelly’s grandson and Princess Stephanie of Monaco’s son Louis Ducruet got engaged to his college sweetheart Marie Chevallier last February, with the wedding set to take place in Monaco sometime during the summer.\n\nThe nuptials will be the latest in a string of royal weddings, which kicked off in May 2018, with The Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle tying the knot with Prince Harry in England. The highly-televised ceremony was followed by yet another royal wedding that saw Princess Eugenie of York wed Jack Brooksbank in October.\n\nMabrouk!"
