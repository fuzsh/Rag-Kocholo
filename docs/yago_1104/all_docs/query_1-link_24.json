        "text": "Queen Farida Of Egypt (September 5, 1921–October 15, 1988) was an Egyptian artist, born Safinaz Zulficar, who was the first wife of Egypt’s King Farouk from 1938 to 1948.\n\nEarly life\n\nFarida was born in a time in which motherhood was the only priority for a woman. The birth of an heir to the throne was especially important. However, due to the rising influence of the West, the role of the First Lady rose to a higher level. The first lady became an honorary title, bearing with it the duties of attending charities, fundraisers, commemorations, and receiving foreign dignitaries. Queen Farida accepted the chair of the Red Crescent Society and was also honorary president of the Feminist Union and the New Woman Alliance. She was also patron of the Egyptian Girl Guide Company, which had an important role in community affairs.\n\nArtistic Career\n\nShe worked with art and drew many paintings, and her uncle, the great artist Mahmoud Saeed, encouraged her to develop her talents in the art of drawing, but her royal duties diverted her from the practice of drawing. She returned to the practice of drawing in 1954 in order to cover her living expenses, and her art belongs to what is known as the innate art of adults. It should be noted that she attended the private school of Ashod Zorian in the early 1950s after being divorced by King Farouk (the last king of Egypt).\n\nArt Galleries and Exhibitions\n\nFarida remained in Egypt until 1963, after which she traveled and resided in Lebanon, Switzerland, and Paris.\n\nShe held numerous art galleries in Madrid, Majorca Island, Paris, Cairo, Geneva, Bulgaria, and Texas in the 1970s and 1980s. One of her exhibitions, entitled \"One Thousand Visions and Visions,\" was in Cairo in May 1980.\n\nIn 1982, she returned to Egypt and lived an ordinary life in one of Cairo's apartments.\n\nDeath\n\nShe died in Cairo in 1988 after suffering from leukemia, and she was buried there."
