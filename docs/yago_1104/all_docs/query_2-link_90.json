        "text": "Egypt last week was busily preparing for the visit next month of the 18-year-old Crown Prince of Iran, Shahpur Mohammed Reza, son of strong-willed Shah Reza Khan Pahlavi, whose marriage to hazel-eyed, black-haired, 17-year-old Princess Fawziya, eldest sister of boy-King Farouk will take place this spring. At last reports the wedding date had not been set.\n\nPopular young King Farouk, who himself married a commoner year ago, has always insisted that his three sisters shall have the right to choose their own husbands and, according to Egyptians, the marriage of Princess Fawziya and the Iranian heir will be a real love match. Only incidentally will it strengthen the ties between two of the most powerful Moslem nations of the Near and Middle East.\n\nAn ardent winter sports fan, Princess Fawziya reportedly fell in love with the Crown Prince during a holiday trip to Switzerland two years ago. Like modern-minded young Queen Farida she wears the veil, in deference to Moslem custom, but lets it hang loosely about her neck (see cut).\n\nCrown Prince Reza is the favorite of the Shahâ€™s eleven children. When Son Reza decided to marry an Egyptian an Iranian law, requiring that the heir to the throne marry an Iranian, stood in his way. The Shah soon took care of that. A special measure was passed making Princess Fawziya a citizen of Iran."
