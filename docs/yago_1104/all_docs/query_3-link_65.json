        "text": "Princess Elizabeth the future Queen of Great Britain and Irland | KÃ¶nigin Elisabeth II. von England\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Wedding Gifts Presents| List of jewels given to QEII\n\nA gold and earliest Egyptian coins necklace with felsnar was the interesting wedding gift given to Princess Elizabeth by King Farouk of Egypt in 1947 - the Egyptian necklace dating back to the third century and incorporating one of the earliest Egyptian coins.\n\nA wedding gift of outstanding historical interest and beauty has been presented to Princess Elizabeth by King Farouk of Egypt.\n\nThe necklace, which dates back to the third century, B.C. is a fine example of the achievement of Egyptian craftsmen at that period. The gold coin in the centre of the necklace represents Arsinoe, Queen of Egypt, who was the wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus, the second King of the three-centuries-long Ptolemaic Dynasty 323-30 B.C. which ended with the famous Queen Cleopatra.\n\nThe back of the centre coin is symbolic of the prosperity of Egypt and the Ptolemaic Dynasty. The Cornucopia--horn of plenty--containing corn, grapes and a pomegranate, the whole being symbolic of the property of Egypt under the Ptolemaic Dynasty.\n\nThe Cornucopia is surrounded by the inscription \"Arsinos of Philadelphus\" - Arsinos belonging to Philadelphus or married to him.\n\nThe coin, carefully minted out of a fresh cast, is one of the earliest examples of Egyptian coinage, which replaced the earlier system of barter at this time.\n\nThe gold setting and chains are of the same period ca 250 B. C.\n\nThe stones in the discs, ornaments and clasps are of green felsnar or Amazon stone.\n\nThank you to Laura for this information.\n\nSource: Illustrated London News Wedding Number; The Times; Royal Collection."
