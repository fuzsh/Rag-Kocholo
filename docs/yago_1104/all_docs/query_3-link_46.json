        "text": "Irma Capece Minutolo, who has died aged 87, enjoyed a moderately successful career in Italian opera; she was also the mistress of former King Farouk of Egypt and, according to her later accounts, his widow.\n\nFarouk, a corpulent playboy with an insatiable appetite for buxom women, had been deposed in July 1952 and was living in exile in Naples. The following year his second wife, Queen Narriman, left him and filed for divorce.\n\nHe soon spotted the teenage Irma Capece Minutolo, a flaming red-head who was newly crowned Miss Naples, on a diving board, clad in a skimpy bikini. She recalled being impressed by his command of Italian, though her rejected fiancé, Enzo Ancarola, challenged the former king to a duel with either pistols or swords.\n\nWilliam Stadiem, Farouk’s biographer, told how her Catholic parents disapproved of the relationship but changed their tune when the king offered a considerable sum of money.\n\nIrma Capece Minutolo insisted that they were no different from other lovers, giving Farouk’s bodyguards the slip to enjoy the countryside together. One August evening in 1958 they were sitting outside Caffe Doney in Rome when a paparazzo leapt out. “The monarch, alarmed that he was being attacked, seized the photographer by the neck. Tables and glasses went flying in a free-for-all that was like something out of a 1950s Western,” noted a report.\n\nIn 1963 Farouk booked the exclusive Naples Artists Club to launch Irma’s singing career. More than 300 guests attended the black-tie recital, but a minute into her opening aria from Puccini’s Madama Butterfly the lights went out. Women screamed, men roared with laughter, the pianist stopped playing, but Irma Capece Minutolo continued singing.\n\nCandles were fetched and the recital resumed, although the pianist’s sheet music caught fire. To make matters worse, Farouk constantly nudged his friends, saying: “Marvellous voice, yes?” The critics were as unkind as they could be, making Irma Capece Minutolo briefly the laughing stock of Italy.\n\nFarouk died suddenly from a heart attack in 1965, while in the company of another young woman. Despite having been his companion for more than a decade, Irma Capece Minutolo was not mentioned in his will, though she joined his first wife, Queen Farida, for his funeral at the Verano Cemetery in Rome.\n\nIrma Capece Minutolo, sometimes known professionally as Imra Di Canosa, then moved into a small flat and began to work seriously on her voice. Although no impresario was willing to risk working with her, she secured a role through a friend of a friend and that was enough to launch her career.\n\nShe was awarded the Maria Callas Prize; performed at La Scala, Milan; and in 1969 the baritone Tito Gobbi, who was also a director, cast her in Gianni Schicchi in Florence.\n\nIn September 1971 Opera magazine praised “her attempt to give vocal and dramatic consistency to the sad character of Carmela” in Cavalleria Rusticana in Turin. She also appeared in films, including Franco Zeffirelli’s Young Toscanini (1988) starring Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nIrma Capece Minutolo was born in Naples on August 6 1935. She claimed to be a princess in her own right, even suing two Italian journalists who described her father as a chauffeur.\n\nShe refused to be drawn on the many other women in Farouk’s life, only admitting that the former king had “many women friends”. In 1954 she said: “I prefer not to marry. Farouk is sensible and tender, but marriage is the tomb of love,” though in a 2005 interview she claimed that they had been married in an Islamic ceremony.\n\nWhether wed to the king or not, Irma Capece Minutolo never married anyone else. Latterly she ran a singing school in Rome.\n\nIrma Capece Minutolo, born August 6 1935, died June 7 2023"
