        "text": "Arsalan & Shameer\n\nWe chose Mr. El-Farouk Khaki as our wedding officiant through All Seasons Weddings services. Mr. Khaki kept in touch, coordinated everything with us, and checked on us constantly to see what our expectations were. He asked if we expected him to be dressed in a certain colour or attire etc., which we felt very happy about. He didn’t have to, he just wanted us to have things our way. He was a hit with our guests. He was engaging, funny, and interesting! Our ceremony was magical, and we owe this to him. He made the ceremony not only warm and engaging by sharing his personal experiences, but also sacred and heartwarming with the way he officiated the wedding. We are so incredibly grateful to him. Please extend our gratitude to him and let him know what an amazing job he’s doing by bringing joy to couples on the most important day of their lives! Thank you to the team at All Seasons Weddings as well, for making the process of booking the officiant hassle-free and for the seamless communication process! May 2024\n\nArsalan & Shameer\n\nCame across the All Seasons Weddings website through an online search. The website is easy to navigate, and the brief introductions of all the officiants helped us narrow down our search. I must say that the wedding officiants on the All Seasons website all seem great, and the positive reviews testify to the quality of their work and engagement. Our wedding was special. We have been in a long-distance relationship for 14 years, so this wedding was very meaningful to us. It was a culmination of cultures, love, and distance coming together. Our wedding officiant, Mr. El Farouk Khaki, was just amazing. Since we booked him, he has constantly been in touch to coordinate every little detail, which we really appreciated. He understands how couples want their big day to be perfect and was very easy to work with. At the wedding, all of our guests thoroughly enjoyed the ceremony as he officiated it in such a special and beautiful way. He made us and our guests shed a tear or two, and there were moments where we all smiled and burst out into laughter. He helped us craft some beautiful memories of our wedding. May 2024\n\nYomna & Jason\n\nEl-Farouk Khaki officiated our wedding and we can't imagine anyone else having been there for our special day. His words about love and marriage were heartfelt and they spoke to us, and everyone at our ceremony. We loved how the ceremony was broken down and how the steps were explained. It allowed us and our families to be present and take in what was going on, step by step. As an inter-faith couple, we both felt represented and respected. It was everything we had dreamed of! Communication and booking was very easy through All Seasons. It was a pleasure! April 2024\n\nDylan & Reine\n\nOur families really felt included and the translations El-Farouk added were extremely helpful. It was such a perfect day. I’m so grateful to El-Farouk and AllSeasons for being a part of our big day. It truly could not have been any easier, or any more wonderful! Thank you again! June 2023\n\nCasey & Tara\n\nEl-Farouk was lovely, accommodating and exceeded our expectations. It felt so great to have him there for our special day. I am glad that we live in a place where we can not only get married, but have an officiant like El-Farouk. September 2021\n\nCasey and Tara\n\nEl-Farouk was fantastic. He made our day memorable, was so accommodating and gave us the perfect heartfelt and inclusive ceremony. We felt honoured to have him officiate our wedding! Thanks again for everything, Casey and Tara\n\nMorgan and Jay\n\nEl Farouk did a phenomenal job in officiating our wedding! We have received nothing but stellar feedback about his service, in particular the way he blended religious and secular aspects of service. Thank you Morgan and Jay\n\nKaanu & Conrad\n\nEl-Farouk Khaki was kind and his message was very personal to us. He made the ceremony feel intimate and unforgettable. Most of our guests joined via video call due to pandemic and El-Farouk made all of them a part of the ceremony. He guided us before, through and after the ceremony with ease and warmth. His message was both spiritual and from the heart. Kaanu & Conrad August 2020\n\nTony & Alyah\n\nThanks for helping us to find El-Farouk for our wedding! He was an amazing officiant, very friendly, funny and accommodating, especially in these uncertain times. We are super grateful that when our original venue cancelled on us due to the pandemic, he was willing to go to another venue which we found on short notice, which was outside of the areas he usually serves. Due to the circumstances, we had an extremely small wedding, with only our parents and siblings in attendance, and El-Farouk was very affable (our moms loved you!). Both of us were a little bit nervous during the ceremony, but El-Farouk was calming and guided us along the process at every step. We couldn't have envisioned a better wedding with any other officiant. Thank you so much for helping us get married, El-Farouk! Thanks Tony & Alyah\n\nM & V\n\nI wanted to thank you for your services and helping us find El-Farouk. He's a great guy and made our special day even more special. I would recommend your platform and his services without hesitation. Thank you sincerely. Feb. 2020\n\nNicholas & Lisa\n\nEl-Farouk Khaki was organized, responsive, and accommodating of our preferences for the ceremony. He was calm and knowledgeable, and offered great advice. He is very personable and funny, and was a delight to work with. Many of our guests commented on how great he was, and how he suited our laid-back style. I would definitely recommend El-Farouk! Nicholas & Lisa September 2019\n\nMark & Michael\n\nMy husband Michael and I had the pleasure of being married by El-Farouk Khaki in September 2019. As we only recently started planning our wedding, El-Farouk helped us with everything to do with the ceremony, alleviating all of our worries and questions. He was very professional but also really friendly and down-to-earth and made the planning and the ceremony an enjoyable and rewarding process. We loved how he added a sense of fun to the event and this was so appropriate for our non-traditional wedding. It was an absolute joy and honour to be married by him and we would highly recommend his services. Thank you so much El-Farouk! Mark & Michael\n\nJohn & Ed\n\nWe could not have been more pleased with the service provided by Mr. Khaki. Our wedding was a complete surprise to our guests, and Mr. Khaki began by addressing them with warmth and humour, telling them why we had decided to marry and how concerned we were that the many years of our relationship prior to the wedding not be disregarded as insignificant. He then conducted the service in a relaxed but dignified manner, guiding us through our vows and the exchange of rings. Later he steered us and our witnesses through the process of signing the many forms necessary for registering our marriage, professionally and efficiently. When that was done, Mr. Khaki mingled with our guests and charmed them with his wit, intelligence and charm. Many of them told us how much they had appreciated how well he handled the event from start to finish. We would be happy to recommend Mr. Khaki to any of your clients who are seeking to choose an officiant. Thank you El-Farouk Khaki! John & Ed May 2019\n\nAhbhisheik & Kelly\n\nMr. Khaki was our first and only choice for an officiant and he far surpassed the expectations we had for him which were high. He was incredibly receptive to a slight last second change and was flexible with his time. His words were quite beautiful, especially the poem he read after the rings were exchanged. He's a genuine man with a big heart and you can see it when you hear him speak. Thank you El-Farouk Khaki. Ahbhisheik & Kelly May 2019\n\nDiego & Samantha\n\nWe chose El-Farouk Khaki was our officiant as we felt tightly aligned to his values and world view. We could not have asked for a better person to officiate our wedding. El-Farouk is kind, fun, passionate and caring. He respected our wishes for a short, sweet, and secular wedding ceremony and was easy to communicate with and is genuinely a lovely person! Diego & Samantha April 2019\n\nLivia and Linda\n\nMy partner and I are fortunate and very grateful to have had El-Farouk as our officiant! His presence reflected much kindness, genuine respect for the spirit of Love in all forms, open-mindedness, and a charming sense of humour. Thank you for honouring our special day! Livia and Linda Jan 5th, 2018\n\nMyia and Semhar\n\nEl-Farouk (Khaki) was our dream officiant and we chose him specifically, creating a ceremony that deeply represented and celebrated both who we are and the building of community as part of our love and relationship. El-Farouk brought his own beautiful words and offerings to the ceremony and many of the people present said it was the most beautiful ceremony they had witnessed. Working with All Seasons was very straightforward and supportive and we are grateful to have had an officiant who could hold and celebrate us well."
