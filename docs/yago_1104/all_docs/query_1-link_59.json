This was the beginning of many meetings between Mr. Hashem and Queen Farida in Cairo and many other Capitals in the Arab World, especially Bahrain. That was also the start of their travels to many Arab countries for twelve years, where Queen Farida had the opportunity to talk about her life story with King Farouk at the Royal Palace, the ups and downs in their relationship, her love for the Arts and the struggles she had to face throughout her life until her passing in 1988. Morad Abou-Sabe’ met Queen Farida in the summer of 1986, when she was a dinner guest at his sister in law in Cairo and met Mr. Hashem twenty years later in 2006, when they discussed the publication of this English version of the book about Queen Farida.
