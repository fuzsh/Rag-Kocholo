Goon Review

Calling Goon this generation's Slap Shot would be an understatement. Aside from the obvious surface comparisons to the George Roy Hill/Paul Newman classic about a minor league hockey team going nowhere, director Michael Dowse (Fubar) and co-writer/co-star Jay Baruchel have created a film that outdoes what many hail as the greatest hockey comedy ever made.

Interview: Alison Pill

Dork Shelf talks to another Goon cast member, Toronto native Alison Pill, about what to look for when choosing a love interest role, working with Seann William Scott and Jay Baruchel, and her fear of improv.

Terra Hazelton

& Andy Sparacino of Fubar 2

We had a chance to chat with Terra Hazelton and Andy Sparacino, two of the stars of Fubar 2. Hazelton plays Trish, a strip club waitress with a heart of gold and Terry's love interest. Those familiar with the first Fubar film will know Sparacino — who played Terry and Dean's old friend and "party leader" Tron — a role that he reprises in the sequel. We talk Fubar 2, music, LARPing and World of Warcraft, and even have enough time to shotgun a few beers.

Fortunately there was enough water left in the well to keep the cow alive and ready to be milked for our viewing pleasure once again!
