        "text": "With the successful launch of Season 1, FUBAR Season 2’s release date is on the minds of many Arnold Schwarzenegger fans. The action spy comedy series uses a great concept where a CIA operative on the verge of retirement takes one last job in the field, only to find out that his daughter is also a CIA agent involved in the same mission. But when will the father-daughter duo return for another season?\n\nHere’s all the FUBAR Season 2 release date information we know so far, and all the details on when it is coming out.\n\nFUBAR Season 2’s release date could arrive by 2025.\n\nAfter FUBAR’s arrival on May 25, 2023, Netflix renewed it for another season on June 17, 2023. But with the ongoing strikes, the development of the second season has been stagnant. We may have got season 2 in the latter half of 2024. But the strikes will most likely push it to some time in 2025 as it is yet to go through all three stages of production.\n\nThis date is an estimation based on the information we have so far. ComingSoon will provide an update to this story once we receive official details.\n\nFUBAR season 1 ended with a cliffhanger as both Luke Brunner and his daughter Emma weren’t left in a safe territory. So, we expect season 2 to pick up the story from right where it was left off. Gabriel Luna’s Boro will definitely not return. But Arnold Schwarzenegger will be back again as Luke along with Monica Barbaro’s Emma. They’d be joined by Milan Carter as Luke’s best friend Barry, Fortune Feimster’s Roo, and Travis Van Winkle’s Aldon.\n\nWhere is FUBAR Season 2 coming out?\n\nFUBAR Season 2 is expected to come out on Netflix most likely in 2025.\n\nThe official synopsis of FUBAR reads:\n\n“When a father and daughter discover they both secretly work for the CIA, an already dicey undercover mission turns into a dysfunctional family affair.”"
