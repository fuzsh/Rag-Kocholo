        "text": "On Friday in San Diego during Comic-Con 2010, Jay Baruchel hinted to MTV that a “bona fide American movie star” would appear in his upcoming hockey comedy, “Goon.”\n\nIt might have been a super big secret, but apparently writer/producer Evan Goldberg (“Superbad,” “Pineapple Express”) didn’t get the memo and let the cat out of the bag to the Playlist later that day.\n\n“We’re hoping that Seann William Scott will be in the movie,” Goldberg said. Someone ought to let Kevin Smith know as he’s already said Scott will star in his competing hockey comedy, “Hit Somebody.” Impending roughhousing call coming shortly enough, we’re sure.\n\nMeanwhile, Goldberg also announced the new director, Michael Dowse, the filmmaker behind the techno DJ satire, “It’s All Gone Pete Tong,” and the Canadian hoser/hesher cult classic, “FUBAR.” “I was talking to Michael Dowse yesterday,” Goldberg said enthusiastically. ” ‘Fubar’ to me is legendary. I think it’s unbelievable.”"
