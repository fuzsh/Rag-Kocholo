        "text": "As much as Canadian cinema aspires to high art, FUBAR II makes you wonder if (the horror!) maybe this is what we do best.\n\nFull Review | Aug 20, 2019\n\nThe FUBAR films are an experiment - can two knuckleheads really get by doing nothing but partying and drinking beer? And is it believable? You bet it is.\n\nFull Review | Aug 28, 2013\n\nI've got a bunch of Canadian friends, and everything about this film feels so real, despite being so over-the-top insane.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Apr 28, 2011\n\n...a clever, complicated comedy which plays like a performance from a far off distant galaxy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Apr 17, 2011\n\nGets better as it goes along, although I was never rolling on the floor with laughter.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Apr 10, 2011\n\nThough the energy flags a little in the film's second half, overall the comedy feels nervy and original.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Oct 1, 2010\n\nAs with the 2002 movie that introduced us to the pair, director Michael Dowse (who co-wrote the script with Lawrence and Spence) makes it clear that these are loveable losers.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Oct 1, 2010"
