        "text": "Netflix's FUBAR is the latest CIA comedy drama to take over our TV schedule, and it's safe to say we're obsessed. The eight-part series follows Arnold Schwarzenegger as a spy who's close to retirement, but has found himself pulled back in for one last mission, after his daughter (played by Monica Barbaro) finds herself in trouble.\n\nIf, like us, you binge-watched the first season of the show (and also looked up what the acronym actually means), the chances are you're already looking ahead to a potential second season. Here's everything we know about FUBAR season 2, from casting news to release date.\n\nHas FUBAR season 2 been confirmed?\n\nCertainly has! At Netflix's recent TUDUM event, which took place in June 2023, not only was a follow up season announced, but fans were also treated to a blooper reel from season one. \" Arnold Schwarzenegger just announced at #TUDUM that FUBAR has been renewed for Season 2! And to thank the fans, he released this blooper reel,\" a tweet confirming the news added.\n\nPreviously, Netflix also announced Arnold Schwarzenegger - the lead - as their Chief Action Officer, which bodes well for future partnerships. In a two-minute promo, the actor presented a series of upcoming action movies and TV shows, with a voiceover saying, \"No one loves action as much as I do.\"\n\nWho might star in FUBAR season 2?\n\nAs it hasn't been confirmed, it's hard to know for sure, but fans can assume many of the leads from season one would return for more episodes. Those include:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as Luke Brunner\n\nMonica Barbaro as Luke's daughter Emma\n\nMilan Carter as Luke's best friend Barry\n\nFortune Feimster as Roo\n\nTravis Van Winkle as Aldon\n\nFabiana Udenio as Tina\n\nFans can assume Boro, played by Gabriel Luna, won't return, due to his death scene.\n\nWhat might happen in FUBAR season 2?\n\n*Spoilers*\n\nAt the end of season 1, we see father and daughter duo Luke and Emma working together as CIA operatives, as he hopes to reconcile with ex-wife Tally, just as she's set to remarry. We also hear Barry's new girlfriend Tina taking a hush hush phone call in Russian, leaving lots of question marks over who she actually is.\n\nSo many cliffhangers!\n\nFUBAR is now streaming on Netflix."
