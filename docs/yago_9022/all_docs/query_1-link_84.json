Catherine St. Baruchel, NDG’s most famous Hollywood star, talked about just how proud he was to work on the project.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nJay Baruchel, Michael Dowse talk hockey before Goon premiere Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

I’m a very proud Canadian and a very proud Montrealer. This country is my home. Movies are my reason for getting up in the morning. And hockey comes very close to those. Hockey is my religion. When the summer-time comes and there is no Habs on, I’m like, ‘What the f— are we doing on a Tuesday night?’\n\n“I knew the first take of the first shot I’d be a sobbing mess and I was. It was the best job ever. Wake up every day, watch a bunch of hard-workin’ guys skate their arses off for 12 hours to make our movie. We invented our own league. We invented this world world. And then to see it in flesh-and-blood.”\n\nBaruchel also talked about how he’s more into writing screenplays these days and suggested he might even give up acting altogether to focus on penning scripts.\n\n“Without sounding cheesy, I feel like my life is finally starting,” said Baruchel, who is in the midst of writing three other screenplays with his writing partner Jesse Chabot. “I was a kid actor here and I figured at 18, I’d go to film school and I’d just screw off and be Joe Writer indie film guy. By the time I’m 20, people will forget I was a kid actor. But I got more gigs. So I had to put that stuff on hold. Just to say this is the part of my life I’ve always dreamt off and been most excited about. And now it’s finally happening. Words can’t describe how awesome it is.”\n\nGoon opens Friday.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
