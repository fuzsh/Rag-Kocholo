        "text": "Michael Dowse\n\nGoon Review\n\nCalling Goon this generation's Slap Shot would be an understatement. Aside from the obvious surface comparisons to the George Roy Hill/Paul Newman classic about a minor league hockey team going nowhere, director Michael Dowse (Fubar) and co-writer/co-star Jay Baruchel have created a film that outdoes what many hail as the greatest hockey comedy ever made.\n\nInterview: Alison Pill\n\nDork Shelf talks to another Goon cast member, Toronto native Alison Pill, about what to look for when choosing a love interest role, working with Seann William Scott and Jay Baruchel, and her fear of improv.\n\nInterview\n\nTerra Hazelton\n\n& Andy Sparacino of Fubar 2\n\nWe had a chance to chat with Terra Hazelton and Andy Sparacino, two of the stars of Fubar 2. Hazelton plays Trish, a strip club waitress with a heart of gold and Terry's love interest. Those familiar with the first Fubar film will know Sparacino — who played Terry and Dean's old friend and \"party leader\" Tron — a role that he reprises in the sequel. We talk Fubar 2, music, LARPing and World of Warcraft, and even have enough time to shotgun a few beers.\n\nTIFF 2010\n\nFubar II Review\n\nAs much as I always loved the first Fubar movie, I was very skeptical when I found out they were premiering the sequel at this year’s festival. To mix metaphors, I thought they were returning to the well to milk a dead cow. Fortunately there was enough water left in the well to keep the cow alive and ready to be milked for our viewing pleasure once again!\n\nTIFF 2010\n\nMidnight Madness Lineup\n\nMidnight Madness has always been a favourite refuge for dorks at the Toronto International Film Festival. Free from the stuffy attitude that plagues the rest of the festival, Midnight Madness is just about the movies. Awesome, weird and insane movies. The programme is a showcase for the best in sci-fi, fantasy, action, horror, animation and […]"
