        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger's spy comedy FUBAR is officially returning for a second season on Netflix.\n\nThe star gave the good news at the Tudum event on Saturday (June 17), with the streaming platform doubling down on its social channels with a surprise for fans.\n\nThe season 2 renewal announcement was paired with a blooper reel from season 1, which is the perfect opportunity to hear Schwarzy drop a series of F-bombs.\n\nRelated: Chris Hemsworth confirms Extraction 3 is in the works at Netflix\n\nAnd, speaking of F-bombs, FUBAR, in case you didn't already know, owes its name to the military acronym for F**ked Up Beyond All Recognition, used to refer to an operation or mission ended up in disaster.\n\nThe series from creator and showrunner Nick Santora includes plenty of such disasters from father-daughter CIA duo Luke and Emma Brunner, played by Arny and Top Gun: Maverick's Monica Barbaro.\n\nPremiering in May this year, FUBAR follows their dysfunctional familial dynamic as both Luke and Emma come clean to each other about their real jobs. This family secret delays Luke's retirement plans, while he and his daughter team up to bring down arms dealer Boro Polonia (played by The Last of Us's Gabriel Luna).\n\nRelated: Netflix announces The Archies movie following Riverdale's final season\n\nThe series also stars comedian Fortune Feimster and How To Train Your Dragon's Jay Baruchel as CIA operative Roo and Emma's boyfriend Carter, respectively.\n\nThe cast is rounded out by Milan Carter, Travis Van Winkle, Barbara Eve Harris, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley and Fabiana Udenio.\n\nThe eight-episode first season opened to big numbers for the streamer, paving the way for a season 2 order. In its first four days of availability on the platform, Variety reported that FUBAR garnered 88.94 million hours in viewing time. Not bad. Not bad at all.\n\nSeason 1 of FUBAR is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
