        "text": "We then had to ask about “The Princess Bride,” which is featured prominently in the film. Dowse said that he only wanted to choose “one Rob Reiner film” and that it wound up in the movie because, “It was in the script.” “It was one of our many direct nods to Rob Reiner, and a little bit of ‘When Harry Met Sally,'” he explained. “It would have been stupid to have them go watch ‘When Harry Met Sally.’ And it’s such a beautiful movie. I love ‘The Princess Bride’ as well.” When we asked about what other romantic comedies (specifically) he took a look at, he cited “When Harry Met Sally,” “It Happened One Night,” “The Apartment” (“There’s a lot of young Jack Lemmon in Daniel Radcliffe”), “Manhattan,” and he also studied a lot of romances like “Love Story” and “The Way We Were,” “just to look at how they shot and treated romance movies.”"
