        "text": "FUBAR II (Michael Dowse). 86 minutes. Opens Friday (October 1). For venues, trailers and times, see Movies. Rating: NNN\n\nFubar II picks up five years after the original with our two dope-and-beer-addled Calgary headbangers – wildman Dean (Paul Spence) and his marginally less wasted best buddy, Terry (David Lawrence) – leaving Calgary for Fort McMurray and big bucks in the tar sands.\n\nDean fakes an injury in the hope of getting workers’ comp. Terry falls for a local girl, which puts a strain on the friendship.\n\nFunnier and livelier than the first film, Fubar II delivers lots of nihilistic low comedy. Highlights include a spectacular house demolition by bombed party-goers, with Dean in the middle, tripping and oblivious, and a consumer rampage in the West Edmonton mall.\n\nSpence and Lawrence have the acting chops to make Dean and Terry more than mere caricatures. We believe in them and their bonded-for-life friendship. That yields some genuinely tender moments when the duo split up, Dean’s testicular cancer returns and he hits rock bottom.\n\nThe cancer was central to the first Fubar, but here it feels shoehorned in, especially when warm-hearted uplift gallops in at a family Christmas to trample the laughs, at least until the battle with the coke-crazed Santa Claus."
