        "text": "FUBAR is returning for a second season at Netflix. Production on the new series got underway in late April 2024 in Elora, Ontario, Canada. Here’s everything we know about the upcoming second season, including the news that Carrie-Anne Moss has joined the cast.\n\nFUBAR is a Netflix Original action-comedy series helmed by Nick Santora, released on May 25th, 2023. Netflix had to swat away some serious competition to acquire FUBAR, ultimately winning an intense bidding war for what would become Arnold Schwarzenegger’s first television role in over five decades of acting.\n\nIn case you haven’t dove into the series yet, here’s what you can expect:\n\n“A father and daughter have both been working as CIA Operatives for years, but each kept their involvement in the CIA hidden from the other, resulting in their entire relationship being a gigantic lie. Upon learning of each other’s involvement in the CIA, the pair are forced to work together as partners, and against the backdrop of explosive action, and espionage, learn who each other really are.”\n\nFUBAR Season 2 Netflix Renewal Status\n\nOfficial Renewal Status: Renewed (Last updated: 06/17/2023)\n\nThe series was officially renewed at Netflix’s TUDUM event in Brazil on June 17th, 2023. The announcement came alongside a clip of bloopers from the first season.\n\nWe predicted a renewal in early June, citing FUBAR’s forthcoming appearance at TUDUM but also because of the show’s strong performance in its first couple of weeks on the service.\n\nHow well has FUBAR performed on Netflix?\n\nWe can watch FUBAR’s performance in its first month thanks to numerous sources, which gives us an idea of how well the show performs.\n\nLet’s start with Netflix’s stats provided via the Top 10 site.\n\nThere, the show featured in the global top 10s for five weeks (note: CVEs were not provided by Netflix for the first three weeks):\n\nWeek Period Hours Viewed Views / CVE Rank Week in Top 10 May 21st, 2023 to May 28th, 2023 88,940,000 0 1 1 May 28th, 2023 to June 4th, 2023 88,030,000 (-1%) 0 1 2 June 4th, 2023 to June 11th, 2023 42,280,000 (-52%) 0 3 3 June 11th, 2023 to June 18th, 2023 24,500,000 (-42%) 3,400,000 5 4 June 18th, 2023 to June 25th, 2023 15,300,000 (-38%) 2,100,000 10 5\n\nFlixPatrol data shows where the show was particularly sticky in the individual Netflix top 10s. From their data, we can see the show performed best across Europe, the United States and Canada plus Nordic regions and Australia.\n\nWhat to expect from FUBAR Season 2?\n\nTina as a Russian Double Agent!?\n\nThe biggest twist of the season came towards the end of the season when it was revealed that Tina is a Russian double agent who has been spying on the CIA, and the NSA the entire time. What her true motives have yet to be revealed, but she might be trying to drain every last drop of information she can get out of the CIA before reporting back to her Russian comrades.\n\nWhy is Tina helping Luke and the CIA?\n\nDespite being a Russian double agent, her true motives have yet to be revealed. Also, aiding Luke, Emma, and the other secret CIA agents is a great way to conceal her identity and continue spying on the CIA.\n\nThe dysfunctional family on the run\n\nWith their identities revealed Luke, Emma, and the rest of the CIA team will be on the run from the extensive criminal network that they’ve been thwarting.\n\nNowhere will be safe, and a man of Luke’s size will find it hard to simply blend in. Expect a lot of hilarious attempts to remain hidden from the criminal network, with plenty of hilarious results.\n\nWill Luke and Emma grow closer?\n\nIn the face of perseverance, in particular, multiple death-defying situations, Luke and Emma will eventually bond as father and daughter.\n\nWho is returning in the cast for FUBAR Season 2 and who’s new?\n\nWe would expect the following cast members to return for FUBAR season 2:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as Luke Brunner\n\nMonica Barbaro as Emma Brunner\n\nMilan Carter as Barry\n\nFortune Feimster as Roo\n\nTravis Van Winkle as Aldon\n\nFabiana Udenio as Tally Brunner\n\nJay Baruchel as Carter\n\nBarbara Eve Harris as Dot\n\nAparna Brielle as Tina\n\nAndy Buckley as Donnie\n\nDevon Bostick as Oscar\n\nOn May 13th, 2024 – Netflix announced that Carrie-Anne Moss, best known for playing Trinity in The Matrix and recently appearing in The Acolyte, would be playing the role of Greta Nelso.\n\nWhat is the production status of FUBAR season 2?\n\nOfficial Production Status: Filming Underway (Last Updated: 03/04/2024)\n\nFilming for FUBAR season 2 got underway on April 29th, 2024, and is scheduled to run until August 12th, 2024.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger recently gave an update on his condition after he had a pacemaker installed. He has confirmed that he will be ready to film in April.\n\nWe got confirmation that cameras were rolling via The Wellington Advertiser on April 30th, 2024, with numerous photos being taken by Lorie Black for the outlet. From their photos, we can see the show is being filmed under the codename OINK:\n\nWhen could we expect to see a second season of FUBAR on Netflix?\n\nRelease dates are particularly tricky to predict with the ongoing WGA strike.\n\nFilming for the first season reportedly occurred between May 2nd, 2022, and August 25th, 2022. This means the time between filming starting and the series being released on Netflix was just over 12 months.\n\nBetween pre-production, filming, and post-production, it could take at least fourteen to fifteen months for the second season of FUBAR to land on Netflix.\n\nWith filming taking place between April 2024 and August 2024, we expect to see FUBAR season 2 on Netflix in Q2 or Q3 of 2025.\n\nAre you looking forward to a second season of FUBAR on Netflix? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nNote: contains additional reporting from Kasey Moore."
