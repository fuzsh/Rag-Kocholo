        "text": "The director of the action-comedy Stuber, Michael Dowse, is set to helm a live-action feature film adaptation of the hit video game franchise Just Cause.\n\nThere are four games in the franchise, and they follow the character Rico Rodriguez on a race-against-time mission to stop The Black Hand, a lethal mercenary group.\n\nThere are no plot details to share on the film as they are being kept under wraps, but “the character’s well-known grappling hook and wing-suit will be part of the action as will the Hand. The tone the producers are hoping to evoke is Romancing the Stone, the 1980s adventure movie that featured jungle heat and repartee between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.”\n\nThe project is set up at Constantin Film, and this script is being written by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The movie is being produced by Constantin’s Robert Kulzer and Martin Moszkowicz, as well as Adrian Askarieh via his Prime Universe Films. Square Enix will also serve in an executive producer capacity.\n\nAre you familiar with the Just Cause video game, and are you excited to hear that it’s getting the feature film treatment?"
