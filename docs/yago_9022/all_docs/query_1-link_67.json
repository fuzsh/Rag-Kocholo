        "text": "Vaughn toplining the Seth Rogen-produced comedy…\n\nTHR has learned that Vince Vaughn (‘Term Life,’ ‘True Detective’) has signed on to star in ‘The Politician,’ the next feature from director Michael Dowse (‘What If,’ ‘Goon’).\n\nFeatured on the 2013 Blacklist of unproduced screenplays, the Matthew Bass and Theodore Bressman-penned comedy tells of “a politician in Washington D.C. who is caught in a scandal with some hookers. The man and his underachieving accomplice go on the run from the FBI, U.S. Marshals and a gang of drug dealers.”\n\nProducers on the comedy include Seth Rogen and his Point Grey partners Evan Goldberg and James Weaver. Mark Gordon is also on board to produce."
