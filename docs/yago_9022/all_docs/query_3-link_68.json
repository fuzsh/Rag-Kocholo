        "text": "© Netflix\n\nReady to get locked and (re)loaded? At Tudum: A Global Fan Event in Brazil in 2023, Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that he’ll “be back” as Luke Brunner for more laughs and shenanigans in front of the camera (and behind the scenes) in FUBAR Season 2. As of May 27, the new episodes have already started filming.\n\n“Season 2 is bananas,” creator Nick Santora (Reacher, Prison Break) previously told Tudum. “We’re coming up with some real fun surprises for FUBAR fans in Season 2, for sure.”\n\nHere’s everything we know about FUBAR Season 2.\n\nWhen did filming start?\n\nNow! Arnold Schwarzenegger promises that Season 2 will be BIG, and he’s got the action figure to prove it. In honor of starting production on Season 2, FUBAR broke a Guinness World Record by building the biggest action figure in the world. A regular Luke Brunner action figure stands at 5.52 inches. This guy? He stands at 265.7 inches, or 22.14 feet. “And next season’s action figure will be twice as big,” says Schwarzenegger in the video above. “Season 2 is coming — enjoy it.”\n\nWhat is FUBAR Season 2 about?\n\nLuke Brunner (Schwarzenegger) is a veteran CIA operative who, up until recently, was on the verge of retirement. After his last mission in saving another operative — who just so happened to be his daughter Emma (Monica Barbaro) — he’s back and face-to-face with new villains. This one is an old flame from Luke’s past who threatens to destroy the world ... if she doesn’t destroy his life first.\n\nHow many episodes will Season 2 have?\n\nFUBAR Season 2 will span eight, 60-minute episodes, promising fans an action-packed continuation of the series."
