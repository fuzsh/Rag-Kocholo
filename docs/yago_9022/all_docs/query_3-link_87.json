        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Netflix action series, Fubar, has been renewed for a second season! The actor made the announcement himself over the weekend during Netflix’s Tudum event.\n\nThe first season of the series was a lot of fun, and I think it’s one of the best projects that Schwarzenegger has been a part of in years! Schwarzenegger is definitely in his element in this series, and I’m excited that we are going to get more!\n\nThe eight-episode first season of Fubar follows CIA operative Luke Brunner (Schwarzenegger) who discovers a family secret that pulls him back into the field and delays his retirement plans. He’s “forced to go back into the field for one last job, FUBAR tackles universal family dynamics set against a global backdrop of spies, action, and humor.”\n\nThe show was a big hit for the streaming service and it opened with 88.94 million hours viewed in its first four days of being released.\n\nFubar also stars Monica Barbaro as Emma Brunner, Fortune Feimster as Roo, Jay Baruchel as Carter, Aparna Brielle as Tina, Andy Buckley as Donnie, Barbara Eve Harris as Dot, Gabriel Luna as Boro, Milan Carter as Barry, Fabiana Udenio as Tally, and Travis Van Winkle as Aldon. Schwarzenegger also serves as an executive producer alongside creator and showrunner Nick Santora.\n\nSchwarzenegger previously said: \"Everywhere I go, people ask me when I'm going to do another big action comedy like True Lies. Well, here it is. FUBAR will kick your ass and make you laugh — and not just for two hours. You get a whole season.\"\n\nNick Santora acts as FUBAR's showrunner and executive producer. He said: \"FUBAR is, by far, the most surreal project of my career. I grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger films -- I'd hit my dad up for a few bucks so I could race to the movies and see the biggest star in the world on the big screen -- so creating the first scripted television project for Arnold is unbelievably exciting for me,\" Santora says. \"The thing I always marveled at was how Schwarzenegger could be funny while still kicking ass ... that's why I wanted FUBAR to be a hysterical, CIA-spy comedy mixed with heart-stopping action! And it is all that – and more. I'd love to elaborate with more details, but, sorry, it's classified.\"\n\nAre you happy to hear that we are getting another season of Fubar? Did you enjoy the first season?"
