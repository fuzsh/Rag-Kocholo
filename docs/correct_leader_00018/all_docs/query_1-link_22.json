        "text": "The French president announced on Sunday (11 March), to no one’s great surprise, that he would not be seeking re-election. Never again will Chirac stride through the corridors of the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels. By the time of the next summit in June, he will have been replaced.\n\nIt is hard to see why the European Union should shed a tear for Chirac. For 12 long years he has sat atop one of the Union’s most powerful nations and he has done his damnedest to block change. He came to power when the EU had just expanded to 15 member states and he behaved as if it should have stuck at six. He has taken foot-dragging and delay to new depths of lassitude. In only one area – defence – did he show any appetite for change. The St Malo declaration on European defence of 1998, made jointly with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, did give some impetus to greater European co-operation.\n\nFor the rest, he behaved like the former agriculture minister he was and is. Before holding the more illustrious and lucrative positions of prime minister and mayor of Paris, Chirac was agriculture minister in 1972-74, when the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was at its most supportive of French farmers. Once he became president, a mere 21 years later, he fought to keep his country’s farmers in the style to which they had become accustomed.\n\nThere is an irony in Chirac making his farewell EU appearance in Berlin. For it was in Berlin in 1999 that he perpetrated a famous stitch-up with the help of Gerhard Schröder, the then chancellor of Germany. The CAP should have been reformed, but with Schröder’s connivance, the French farming industry kept its snout in the EU trough for a bit longer. There was no reform of the dairy sector and less reform of other sectors than there should have been.\n\nTacked on to the Berlin stitch-up on the CAP budget was a stitch-up on the appointment of Pierre de Boissieu as deputy secretary-general of the Council of Ministers. Given that the Secretary-General, Javier Solana, was to be fully occupied as high representative for foreign policy, Chirac and Schröder were effectively putting de Boissieu, at that time the French ambassador to the EU, in charge of the Council secretariat – a decision that has been yet another brake on change in the EU.\n\nThe Berlin hanky-panky was repeated during negotiations in 2002 over the EU’s spending for 2004-06. Schröder and Chirac got together for a cosy chat at the Conrad Hotel, on the eve of the October summit, and made an agreement delaying further reform of CAP spending and ensuring that a financial settlement for the new member states could not dislodge the CAP, which was (at least for the EU15) preserved in aspic until 2013. By the time the summit proper started, the parameters for debate had already been curtailed: an ill-tempered spat with Blair followed. The stitch-up showed breathtaking disregard for the etiquette of the European Council, but it was highly effective for all that – and entirely in keeping with Chirac’s high-handed style. This was, after all, the man who later famously scolded the applicant member states in February 2003 for siding so readily with the US in the war against Iraq, telling them that they had missed a good opportunity to keep quiet and that those already members of the family had more rights than those knocking on the door.\n\nChirac blew hot and cold on the enlargement of the EU, as indeed he blew hot and cold on the EU. Earlier in his French political career, he had found it expedient to attack the Europeanism of the then president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and to play up his French nationalism. But at other times, he affected his support for the EU – on his terms. Last week he was claiming to have been a constant supporter of enlargement – this constancy was often hidden from the applicant countries, which felt neither trusted nor loved. He was a political opportunist, on Europe as on so much else.\n\nHis decision to call a referendum on an EU constitution that he claimed to support and his subsequent failure to attain a ‘Yes’ vote from the citizens of France, was a verdict of sorts on the incoherence of his approach to the EU.\n\nTrue, it was on his watch that the euro was established and the EU expanded to 27 but Chirac does not deserve the credit. Nor is he solely responsible for the EU’s current drift. Blame can be attached also to the likes of Blair (who promised much but failed to deliver), Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, and Schröder. And it is true that for five years, from 1997-2002, Chirac was presiding over a government of co-habitation, with a socialist Lionel Jospin in power as prime minister, so he was not in a position of strength. But equally, in 2002-07, he had a centre-right government beneath him and still he failed to deliver."
