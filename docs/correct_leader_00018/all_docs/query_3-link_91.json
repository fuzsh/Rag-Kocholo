        "text": "Jacques Chirac, who has died aged 86, fulfilled a lifetime’s ambition in 1995 when he became President of the Republic of France; he had previously served two terms as prime minister and 18 years as mayor of Paris.\n\nIt was Chirac’s third attempt at the presidency, and at the start of the campaign he was dismissed by the pundits as a no-hoper. But he confounded all predictions, beating his fellow Gaullist Édouard Balladur in the first round of voting before going on to victory in the second round over his Socialist opponent Lionel Jospin.\n\nHe served two consecutive terms, from 1995 to 2007, but his political career ended in disgrace in 2011 when he became the first former French president to be convicted of corruption.\n\nTall, square-jawed and charming, Chirac swept into power on a wave of popular enthusiasm that saw his poll ratings soar to 67 per cent, a record for any Fifth Republic president.\n\nAfter 14 years of eccentric and ultimately paralysed rule by his Socialist predecessor François Mitterrand, Chirac seemed a breath of fresh air: “Our worst enemies are ourselves,” he said. “There needs to be another shock, like 1958 [which brought the return of Charles de Gaulle].”\n\nAs a schoolboy he had skipped classes to study Cordon Bleu, thinking he might defy his parents and become a chef. In 1979, while walking through Roissy airport at the height of the boat people crisis, he noticed a young Vietnamese girl in tears and adopted her on the spot.\n\nYet within months of his election his popularity had taken a nosedive. President Mitterrand, under whom he had served as prime minister, once remarked of Chirac that “I thought during the first months of our cohabitation that he was contradicting himself from one week to another. I ended up noticing that he could even contradict himself between morning and evening.”\n\nAt the Elysée Palace, Chirac soon displayed the contrariness for which he had long been known.\n\nWhen Srebrenica fell, he accused the Serbs of barbarism and offered French soldiers to help the UN recapture the enclave, demanding a tougher line despite the risk of alienating Russia. Many critics of western policy welcomed this new moral line from the French, but within weeks Chirac had retrenched and fallen into line with UN policy.\n\nHe seemed determined to tread on toes. To a chorus of international condemnation, he announced the resumption of nuclear testing in the Pacific. The testing programme had been suspended by President Mitterrand in 1992, a decision which Chirac had promised not to reverse. As other nations threatened a trade boycott, only the British stood by him.\n\nBut London, too, was to be disappointed. John Major’s Conservative government had reason to hope that Chirac’s presidency would cost Europe its united front against Britain on matters such as the single currency, border controls and BSE.\n\nThough Chirac had supported the Maastricht agreement in 1992, he had become noticeably less enthusiastic about the single currency and had begun to talk passionately about a Europe of nation states. His presidency, he assured British journalists, would restore the old “entente cordiale” between the two nations.\n\nHis doubts – if he had any – about monetary union were soon transmuted into an ill-tempered campaign for the appointment of a Frenchman to run the European Central Bank. And despite sympathetic noises, he did nothing to help Britain lift the ban on the export of beef.\n\nBut it was his failure to tackle the country’s mounting economic problems that cost him the support of French voters. He had been elected vowing to reduce unemployment, yet his pledges soon lost their shine as unemployment rose to new heights and social security cuts were imposed in an attempt to reduce France’s burgeoning budget deficit.\n\nHe was unwise, too, in his choice of Alain Juppé, his deputy in Paris, to be his first prime minister. Juppé quickly made himself unpopular with a series of ill-judged PR initiatives – telling the French people the economy was in good shape when unemployment had reached a post-war peak, and calling for a new culture of responsibility amid mounting social unrest.\n\nIn 1997, in what must count as one of the biggest miscalculations in modern French history, Chirac dissolved parliament and called an election, apparently gambling on his own side winning a majority, thus avoiding the need for “cohabitation” with a Socialist prime minister.\n\nThe gamble did not pay off: with his party sliding in the opinion polls, not even Juppé’s resignation could save Chirac’s centre-Right alliance in parliament. In May 1997 Chirac’s old adversary, Lionel Jospin, became France’s new prime minister, at the head of a Left-Green alliance. Chirac found himself lumbered with a government he could not control.\n\nAfter the election, his own centre-Right alliance fragmented, leaving him as the only real leader the opposition possessed, but one who was prevented by the President’s constitutional position from acting as such.\n\nThe formation of a new Left-wing administration whose term of office coincided with the remaining term of Chirac’s presidency brought about a striking reversal of the president’s traditionally dominant role, leaving him master of little more than the Elysée Palace and the presidential jet.\n\nIt seemed obvious to everyone that the 2002 presidential elections would see a Jospin and Chirac face-off in the second round – with Jospin the favourite to win. But Jospin’s position was undermined by spoiler candidates on the Left and in the first-round election on April 21 2002 he was eliminated, trailing behind the far-Right National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nOnly 19 per cent of the people had voted for Chirac, the lowest support for a sitting president, yet in the second round, on May 5, the French Left and Centre had little option but to rally behind him to keep out Le Pen.\n\nWithin a year of returning to office, Chirac emerged as a leading voice at the UN against the Bush-Blair war in Iraq, as a result of which he found himself hailed in France – and not just in France – as a strategic visionary. His standing in the polls rose steeply and it seemed that he had invented a “Chirac doctrine”, according to which Europeans must build a common front to avoid being bullied into hare-brained adventures like the Iraq war.\n\nOccasional Brit-bashing went down well, too. In 2005 Chirac was overheard joking to Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder at a summit: “You can’t trust a country with bad food. After Finland, Britain is the country with the worst food in the world.”\n\nAt Chirac’s re-election his defeated opponent, Lionel Jospin, had made a prediction. Within two years, he had suggested, Chirac would cause a political train wreck. It took a year longer than that, but Jospin was right – and as usual it was his impetuosity that caused Chirac’s downfall.\n\nIn 2000 he had been the first head of state to call for a European constitution, to meet the challenges of accommodating new members from the East. The necessary changes in the rules could have been made in an updated EU treaty. Calling it a “constitution” was always a hostage to fortune.\n\nIn 2004 he compounded his error by calling a referendum in France on the constitutional treaty the following year. His motives were partly tactical: to embarrass the French Left, which had won sweeping victories in the regional and European elections.\n\nYet Chirac made little attempt to sell the constitution to the French people, failing to impress when he tried to present himself as a defender of the French “social model” against the wicked Anglo-Saxon free market. In May 2005 voters gave him a bloody nose, decisively rejecting the draft constitution. The referendum “Non” was a devastating blow to the EU and meant the end of Chirac’s influence at home and abroad.\n\nHe had come into office promising to heal the “social fracture” of the nation. But by the time he left in 2007 little had changed. A couple of timid attempts at economic reform were interrupted by a cohabitation with a Socialist government, whose ruinous 35-hour working week Chirac then failed to reverse.\n\nGrowth remained stagnant; unemployment high; and the public sector bloated and top-heavy, while unions continued to fight tooth and nail to preserve their generous pensions and a welfare system that the economy could ill afford.\n\nChirac had never been the “regular bloke” he seemed. The man who railed against the technocracy responsible for France’s ills had himself been educated at the École Nationale d’Administration, the training ground for that technocracy.\n\nHe once told an interviewer that the only books he ever read were whodunnits; in fact he spoke Russian well enough to translate a work by Pushkin, and was fond of Chinese poetry. Rather than reading Playboy behind a book of sonnets, observed the Socialist writer Françoise Giraud, Chirac “would read poetry behind a copy of Playboy”.\n\nThough in 1995 he had announced the disposal of the fleet of military planes that took ministers anywhere they wanted, and that ministerial limousines would stop at traffic lights, he failed to tackle other privileges.\n\nHis protection of his prime minister Juppé’s unorthodox housing arrangements (an elegant Paris flat rented at council-house rates from the city) included a spirited defence of privileges for the elite because of their “special value” to the nation. In reality, Chirac was an insider through and through, though the extent to which he himself exploited the system would not become clear until after his retirement.\n\nJacques was evacuated to Toulon with his parents in 1940. His first “political emotion” was when he heard of the sinking of the French fleet by the British at Mers-el-Kébir: “I understood that the destruction of an army or the decline of a national destiny could depend on a decision or indecision at the top,” he recalled. As a boy scout he amused himself cutting German telephone wires.\n\nAt the Louis le Grand High School in Paris, his highest marks were for physical education: “He is too talkative, too inattentive and too highly strung to succeed,” ran one school report.\n\nIn an exchange arranged by his parents, Jacques travelled to Britain for a month every year between the ages of 16 and 20 to stay with a boy of the same age in Rochester, Kent.\n\nHe travelled widely during his British holidays, staying in YMCA hostels. In 1949 he was among the crowds welcoming George VI and the young royal princesses as they toured the shipyards of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The experience gave him a firm grounding in English and a liking for fish and chips.\n\nChirac defied his schoolmasters’ expectations, winning a place at the elite Institute of Political Sciences (“Sciences Po”) in Paris and then the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). There he became a communist, selling the party newspaper, L’Humanité, on the streets.\n\nHis hero was Albert Camus, whom he imitated to the point of being photographed in drab clothes with a Gitanes drooping moodily from the corner of his mouth. He refused the future Socialist prime minister Michel Rocard’s invitation to join his radical political group on the grounds that it was “too conservative”.\n\nHe continued to travel widely. During one vacation he worked on a cargo ship plying the seas between Dunkirk and North Africa (losing his virginity in a brothel in Algiers). In 1953 he attended a summer school at Harvard, hitchhiked his way to Texas, did a stint as a hotel bellhop and fell in love with a young woman called Florence. He had planned to marry her, he said years later, but his father had forbidden the match.\n\nHis life altered course after he fell in love with a fellow student at the Sciences Po, Bernadette Chodron de Courcel, a member of a prominent Catholic family whose father had been one of de Gaulle’s wartime advisers in London. They married in 1956.\n\nChirac was determined to show his wife’s family what he could achieve, and swiftly executed the first in a long series of political U-turns by turning his back on Communism and becoming a fervent Gaullist.\n\nHe had received his army commission from the cavalry training centre at Saumur. Shortly after the wedding he left for military service as a cavalry officer in Algeria, where he was wounded and awarded the Croix de la Valeur Militaire after saving a comrade’s life. On his return to France he entered the ENA, became a prodigiously hard worker, and passed 16th out of his year.\n\nIn 1962 he caught the eye of de Gaulle’s prime minister (later President), Georges Pompidou, who offered him a job in his office. Pompidou appreciated Chirac’s vigour, christening him “le bulldozer”.\n\nChirac first came to international notice in 1972 when Chaban-Delmas appointed him agriculture minister. Over two years in the post, he successfully championed the interests of French farmers during many tense negotiations with France’s Common Market partners. In 1974 he became interior minister.\n\nAfter Pompidou’s death that year Chirac switched his support from Chaban-Delmas, Pompidou’s aspiring successor, in favour of Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Giscard celebrated his appointment as president by choosing Chirac, then 41, to be prime minister.\n\nBut they soon fell out. In 1976 the Chiracs were invited by Giscard to spend a weekend at the presidential Fort de Brégançon. Chirac had expected to be treated as a valued partner, but Giscard seemed determined to teach his uppity prime minister a lesson.\n\nWhile at the dinner table Giscard and his wife were seated on high-backed armchairs, the Chiracs had to sit with Giscard’s ski instructor and his wife gazing up at the President from small wooden chairs. Not long afterwards Chirac resigned.\n\nHe now began his long campaign to win the presidency, founding his own party, the neo-Gaullist Rassemblement pour la République (RPR) to back his first presidential bid during the 1981 elections. Meanwhile, another opportunity came his way.\n\nUntil 1977 Paris had been run by a préfet appointed by the government, but Giscard decided it should have an elected mayor, though he intended the job for one of his own supporters. In the elections held that year, Chirac upset that calculation by trouncing the President’s man.\n\nFour years later, his intervention in the presidential election split the Right-wing vote, ruining Giscard’s chances of re-election and giving the Socialist Mitterrand a comfortable majority.\n\nChirac flopped into third place for the presidency, but in 1983 another opponent opened the way for him to tighten his grip on Paris. When the Socialist prime minister Pierre Mauroy introduced a system of directly elected mayors for three major cities, including Paris, Chirac’s supporters consolidated their hold on the city, resoundingly beating the Socialists.\n\nHe would remain Mayor of Paris until his elevation to the presidency in 1995.\n\nHis long reign at the Hôtel de Ville saw investment in public services and the gentrification of the capital. But Chirac’s critics accused him of running the city in a secretive and dictatorial manner and of ruthlessly sweeping Paris’s social problems to the outer suburbs. There were, moreover, persistent rumours of corruption.\n\nBy 1986 the popular mood had shifted against the governing Socialists in parliament; Chirac led the Right to victory in elections to the legislature and was duly appointed prime minister by President Mitterrand.\n\nChirac embarked on an unmistakably conservative programme with wide-ranging privatisations and a controversial attempt to limit places at French universities. With France tiring of socialism, the 1988 presidential elections should have been Chirac’s for the asking. But he was constantly outfoxed by the wily Mitterrand, who turned Chirac’s instability to his own advantage.\n\nChirac was devastated to lose the presidency for a second time. He suffered a two-year depression and almost abandoned politics. But it was during this unsuccessful bid for the presidency that he developed a close working relationship with his younger daughter Claude.\n\nShe would go on to be the mastermind of his successful presidential campaign and later became director of communications at the Elysée Palace.\n\nClaude felt convinced that her father could succeed if he appealed to younger voters disaffected with politics. In 1987, when Chirac was considering a proposal to ban a concert by Madonna at which she was planning to throw her knickers into the audience, Claude appealed to her father to think again.\n\n“I locked myself into a room with Daddy,” she recalled, “and made him listen to her records. I explained that if Madonna was banned, he was in danger of depriving young people of an important event.”\n\nThe performance went ahead, Madonna kissed Chirac on both cheeks and handed him a cheque for Aids research, and in return he lowered VAT on records. Chirac would apply the lessons of this episode in his subsequent bid for the presidency.\n\nWhen he again won the 1993 elections to the legislature in a landslide, Chirac drew the conclusion that cohabitation would destroy his presidential hopes and decided as leader of the RPR to hold himself in reserve for the presidential elections due in 1995. The job of prime minister, he decided, would go to his old friend Édouard Balladur.\n\nChirac had been warned by close allies that Balladur would use the position to further his own presidential ambitions, but Chirac believed he had a watertight agreement that Balladur would give him a clear run. The critics were right.\n\nBefore long, relations between the two men had begun to deteriorate. On Christmas Day 1994, when Chirac telephoned Balladur with best wishes, Balladur, in church at the time, did not return his call. In January 1995 he declared his candidacy for the presidency, taking many of Chirac’s former allies with him.\n\nWhile Balladur campaigned in Paris, Chirac got out into the provinces, kissing babies, meeting farmers, listening to the unemployed and chatting to shoppers. He was a political everyman, addressing fears of immigration one day then waxing lyrical about “les exclus” the next.\n\nEven his gargantuan appetite proved an electoral advantage: while the dour Balladur survived on mineral water, Chirac hoovered his way through stews, cheeses and chocolate cake with populist gusto.\n\nHis political career was dogged by rumours of sleaze – and not just rumours. The French were well aware that Chirac never paid for a luxury holiday, that he spent €4,000 a day in “entertaining and food expenses” when he was Paris mayor, and that he was a serial adulterer.\n\nThere were also long-standing stories – never confirmed – that he had fathered a child by a Japanese woman, rumours possibly reinforced by his well-attested, though equally mysterious, enthusiasm for Japan (he was a great fan of Sumo wrestling). In 2001 his amorous escapades were documented in a drive-and-tell book by his former chauffeur, Jean-Claude Laumond, who revealed that in the 1980s the women in his office knew him as “Three minutes – shower included”.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, however, a tide of scandal threatened to engulf him, when magistrates began investigating claims that the Paris Town Hall under Chirac had become a milch cow for the RPR, with construction contracts sold to party cronies and hundreds of party workers given phantom jobs at public expense.\n\nChirac consistently denied any wrongdoing, and as president he enjoyed immunity from prosecution. In 2011, however, he was found guilty of embezzling public money and received a two-year suspended sentence, becoming the first post-war French head of state to be convicted of a crime.\n\nHidden below the surface, however, lay a Chirac that nobody outside his immediate family ever saw. In 1990 his elder daughter, Laurence, who suffered psychiatric problems, threw herself out of the fourth-floor window of her Paris flat.\n\nThough she survived, she suffered serious injuries and was thereafter confined to a sanatorium, eventually dying in 2016. Then in 1993, Chirac’s son-in-law, Philippe Habert, a television executive married to his daughter Claude, was found dead having taken a drug overdose, leaving Claude widowed at 30.\n\nChirac faced these tragedies with fortitude and refused ever to answer questions about his private life; not even his closest aides were permitted to speak to him about it. In a little noticed article in a Catholic magazine in 1996, Claude Chirac recounted her father’s advice to her as a child after a pet dog had died: “You must be strong, and you must try not to show your sadness to others, especially those that love you.” In knowing how to hide your grief, Chirac suggested, you respect the feelings of others.\n\nChirac’s contribution, the Musée du quai Branly, devoted to the “art and civilisation of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas”, was a monument to a more thoughtful, outward-looking presidency than those of his predecessors.\n\nIt was seen as a symbolic effort to reach out to non-European civilisations at a time when France was having trouble digesting the offspring of such cultures at home. “Against those who preach confrontation, violence, hate,” he declared, the museum would send “the humanist message of respect for diversity and the dialogue of cultures.”\n\nJacques Chirac is survived by his wife, by his younger daughter and by his adopted daughter.\n\nJacques Chirac, born November 29 1932, died September 26 2019"
