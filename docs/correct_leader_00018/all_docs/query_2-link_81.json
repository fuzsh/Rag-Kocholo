        "text": "Former French President Jacques Chirac, who led the country from 1995 to 2007 and was known as an ardent fan of Japanese culture, died Thursday in Paris at the age of 86, French media reported.\n\nHis son-in-law Frederic Salat-Baroux told the media that he died in the morning \"surrounded by his family, peacefully.\"\n\n[Anadolu Agency/Getty/Kyodo]\n\nA conservative, Chirac was elected to the presidency twice, in 1995 and 2002, after serving as prime minister twice and mayor of Paris three times.\n\nChirac steered France into the single European currency and was a stalwart opponent of the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nChirac actively tried to enhance relations with Japan. Paris and Tokyo became sister cities in 1982 while he was mayor.\n\nHe loved a range of aspects of Japan, from art to sumo, and visited country for more than 40 times.\n\nIn 2000, he created the \"President of the Republic of France Cup,\" known as the \"Chirac Cup,\" for sumo champions in Japan, which was presented until he left office.\n\nChirac's second presidential election in 2002 was notable, for it pitted him against the extreme-right-wing candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, which galvanized the left and pushed him to victory with 82 percent of the vote.\n\nHe was the first French president to recognize France's role in the Holocaust.\n\nHis reputation took a toll when he was convicted in 2011 of corruption that took place while he was mayor of Paris.\n\nHe appeared less frequently in later years, suffering from memory loss said to be linked to a form of Alzheimer's disease or to a minor stroke he had in 2005."
