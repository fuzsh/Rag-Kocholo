        "text": "Home > News & Policies > July 2006\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nOffice of the Press Secretary\n\nJuly 16, 2006\n\nRemarks by President Bush and French President Chirac\n\nCottage Nine\n\nKonstantinovsky Palace Complex\n\nStrelna, Russia\n\nG-8 Summit 2006\n\n9:14 A.M. (Local)\n\nPRESIDENT BUSH: I want to thank Jacques Chirac for coming over. It's always a pleasure to visit with Jacques. He is a man who is able to crystalize his thoughts, who is able to discuss issues in a very clear way.\n\nObviously, we're going to spend time talking about the Middle East. The United States is proud to work with France on Resolution 1559 of the United Nations, which is a clear statement of principle and concern about Lebanese democracy. I'm confident that other leaders will look at the spirit of 1559 and recognize that one way to help heal in the Middle East is to address the root causes of the problems there, and the root cause of the problem is Hezbollah and Syria and the Iranian connection.\n\nThe President has taken a strong lead on this issue in the past. We are in discussions with his administration, and I'm confident that we'll be able to come up with a clear position between France and the United States on this vital issue.\n\nI look forward to discussing other issues with my friend, Jacques Chirac. It's good to be with you, sir. Thank you for coming by.\n\nPRESIDENT CHIRAC: (As translated.) First of all, I just like to say how delighted I am to have this opportunity to meet with the American President. And I note, albeit it, that this has been difficult circumstances as we have been witnessing the sad events that have been unfolding in the Middle East. But I'm especially struck and delighted by the fact that we share the same views of the issues at stake here. We witness the tremendous sadness, the hardship of the civilian population in this region. You know what longstanding ties France has always had with Lebanon. And when I say, this region, I refer not only to Lebanon, but, of course, to what's happening to the Palestinians. So we would call -- (inaudible) -- for a show of moderation on the part of all parties involved, so that we can establish the conditions of a long-lasting, lasting cease-fire in the region.\n\nNow, I entirely agree with the American President in what he said about supporting the U.N. mission, which is designed, among other things, to ensure the release of the Israeli soldiers being detained right now both by Hezbollah and by Hamas, and put an end to the firing of Kassam rockets.\n\nNow, with respect to Gaza, which is a separate issue from that of Lebanon, we feel that it is essential, it is of the essence, that we renew dialogue with Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nNow, as regards Lebanon, I couldn't agree more with President Bush in saying that what is at the heart of this is the to-the-letter implementation of Security Council Resolution 1559. That is what must be done forthwith. And we must stop all those who are at present engaging in jeopardizing the security, the stability and authority of Lebanon.\n\nPRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you all. Thank you, sir.\n\nEND 9:19 A.M. (Local)"
