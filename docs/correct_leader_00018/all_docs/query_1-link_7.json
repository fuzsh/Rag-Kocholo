        "text": "Jacques Chirac served two terms as French president and took his country into the single European currency.\n\nHe moved from anti-European Gaullism to championing a European Union constitution that was then rejected ignominiously by French voters.\n\nHis refusal to back the US-led invasion of Iraq only worsened his already difficult relationship with the UK's then Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nAnd Chirac's reputation at home was tarnished when, after leaving the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, he was convicted of corruption that took place during his long tenure as mayor of Paris.\n\nJacques RenÃ© Chirac was born in 1932, the son of a bank manager who later became the managing director of the Dassault aircraft company.\n\nEducated at the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the elite academy for aspiring civil servants, the young Chirac flirted with communism and pacifism.\n\nHe served for a time in the French army reserve and was wounded during the French colonial war in Algeria.\n\nThe 1960s saw him working as an assistant to Gaullist Prime Minister Georges Pompidou.\n\nIt was he who marked Chirac out for the top and made him a junior minister in 1967.\n\nIn 1974 the Gaullists experienced a watershed year.\n\nChirac, now firmly at the centre of things, led a revolt against the official Gaullist candidate for the presidency, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, in favour of ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing.\n\nWhen the latter duly became president he rewarded Chirac with the premiership. He was 41 years old.\n\nTwo years later came another split.\n\nChirac, wanting more powers for himself from the increasingly imperious Giscard, resigned as prime minister and compounded his action by forming his own neo-Gaullist party, the RPR.\n\nIn 1977, Chirac was elected mayor of Paris, a post he would hold for 18 years.\n\nBut his tenure was marred by numerous financial and political scandals which would sully his reputation.\n\nHe had ambitions for the presidency and in 1981 he stood, unsuccessfully, against the Socialist FranÃ§ois Mitterrand.\n\nMitterrand made Chirac prime minister in 1986, during the period of \"cohabitation\" between left and right, but the relationship between the two was fraught. There were disagreements over the extent to which Chirac felt that presidential powers were encroaching on to his own role as prime minister.\n\nHowever, Chirac's protests had little impact on Mitterrand, whose own nickname \"Dieu\" - \"God\" - revealed much about his own magisterial image.\n\nChirac suffered a severe setback when striking students forced him to abandon his planned changes to the university system.\n\nHe was also heavily criticised for his role in the release of French hostages held in Lebanon in 1988.\n\nMany suspected that Chirac had made a deal with Iran, which was backing the kidnappers, something that he vehemently denied.\n\nAfter being defeated a few days later by Mitterrand at the 1988 presidential elections, Chirac resigned from the cabinet.\n\nEver a thorn in the side of the Socialist government, Chirac still believed that his time would come, as French attitudes changed towards taxation, privatisation and the role of the state.\n\nIn all of these areas, opinion was moving to the right and the only question was who would pick up the baton.\n\nChirac's time finally came in the 1995 presidential elections.\n\nWith a promise of tax cuts and a healing of the social divide in France, he defeated his main Gaullist rival, Edouard Balladur, in the first round and saw off Mitterrand's Socialist successor, Lionel Jospin, in the second.\n\nAt the third attempt \"the bulldozer\", as Chirac was nicknamed, had finally crashed the gates of the ElysÃ©e Palace, ending 14 years of opposition for the French right.\n\nWhile retaining much of the pomp that goes with the job, Chirac opened up the presidency.\n\nThe pavement in front of the ElysÃ©e Palace, once a no-go area for Parisians and others, was pedestrianised, and it even became possible to email him directly.\n\nBut in other ways there was little change.\n\nWithin six weeks of his inauguration, Chirac had outraged world opinion by announcing the resumption of French nuclear tests in the South Pacific.\n\nAs the tests took place on Mururoa Atoll, the nearby French territory of Tahiti erupted in violent demonstrations.\n\nRioting only ended when the president sent in the Foreign Legion.\n\nHe also took sharp action against environmental groups, ordering the boarding of a Greenpeace ship which had entered the test area.\n\nChirac continued the policy of close co-operation with Germany, publicly stating that European integration relied upon Franco-German leadership.\n\nHe was berated for keeping French interest rates high in order to shadow the Deutschmark.\n\nHe said it was the price to be paid for a single European currency, which France eventually joined.\n\nAt home, nothing could mask the endemic problems affecting French society.\n\nHigh levels of unemployment, a growing underclass and increased racial tensions saw the French public become increasingly distrustful of politics and politicians.\n\nThe resurgence of Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front in the 2002 presidential elections, shook French politics.\n\nThe elections saw Le Pen and Chirac run off against each another.\n\nWhile the far-right leader was soundly defeated, the outcome posed more questions about democracy in France than it answered.\n\nThe French public's decisive rejection of the proposed EU constitution in May 2005 dealt a seismic blow, both to the country's political elite and to the man whose own legacy was riding on the result.\n\nImmediately after the vote, the visibly cowed president appeared on national television, calling upon the nation to wrap itself in the tricolour.\n\n\"Let's not fool ourselves,\" he said.\n\n\"The decision of France inevitably creates a difficult context for the defence of our interests in Europe. We must respond to this by uniting around one requirement; national interest,\" he added.\n\nParis's failure in 2005 to win the competition to host the 2012 Olympics was symbolic of the loss of confidence in Chirac's administration.\n\nHis second term as president came to an end in 2007, and four years later the ailing former leader was convicted of corruption relating to his time as mayor of Paris.\n\nA nationalist in the Gaullist tradition, Jacques Chirac was a man of great political ability who brought charisma and personal charm to his role.\n\nHis critics dubbed him \"the weathervane\" but, after a career lasting 40 years, the political climate had changed and his own skills, once formidable, had waned.\n\nHowever Jacques Chirac was a political survivor and although his time was up in 2007, he could still lay claim to one of the longest continuous political careers in Europe."
