        "text": "Before the meeting began the two heads of state made press statements.\n\nDuring their talks Vladimir Putin and Jacques Chirac discussed various issues relating to their bilateral trade and economic cooperation and the possibility of expanding this cooperation. They also discussed the work done by the Russian-French Business Council, the situation in Lebanon, as well as the current situation in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nDuring the official dinner they mentioned their respective experience of work done by the governments of Russia and France to draw up projects for the state budget. In addition to this, the two heads of state discussed issues with respect to cooperation in aviation construction and transportation in detail.\n\nThe issues of using French experience to help ensure traffic safety and safe road construction in Russia as well as the possibility of French experts participating in these projects were discussed separately.\n\nTwo memorandums were signed in the presence of the two heads of state. One concerned mutual understanding and intentions between Russia’s Ministry of Transportation and the French company, Vinci, and the other concerned the common intentions of Russia’s Ministry of Transportation and France’s Ministry of Transportation, Infrastructure, Tourism and the Sea.\n\nFollowing the meeting the President of France, Jacques Chirac, awarded Vladimir Putin the Legion of Honour, the highest French state award. Jacques Chirac said that France highly values the President of Russia’s contribution towards developing the two countries’ multifaceted cooperation.\n\nIn turn, Vladimir Putin noted that it is a great honour for him to receive this award of France – that is country of his great deal of interest and respect. The Russian head of state emphasised that relations between Russia and France have developed over centuries and though they have had different levels of closeness, they always remained significant in international affairs and for the Russian and French peoples. “I want to assure you, the people of France, that I will try to make an even greater contribution towards strengthening the friendly relations between our people and states”, Vladimir Putin said."
