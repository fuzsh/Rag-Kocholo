        "text": "Former French President Jacques Chirac was given full military honors Monday as past and current world leaders gathered in Paris to attend his final service.\n\nCutting a solemn figure, French President Emmanuel Macron presided over the ceremony on a mild, sunny morning near the site of Napoleon's tomb in the courtyard of Les Invalides. A military band played the national anthem, ``La Marseillaise,'' before Macron inspected the troops. Chirac's casket, covered with a Tricolor flag, was then carried to the center of the courtyard.\n\nMacron, who did not speak, later attended a memorial service at the Church of Saint-Sulpice in downtown Paris alongside dozens of French politicians and foreign officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and Jordan's King Abdallah II.\n\nChirac's coffin was driven to Saint-Sulpice, where pianist Daniel Barenboim played a Schubert impromptu, as mourners lined the procession route to his funeral service. When the hearse carrying Chirac drove by, the crowd broke into applause.\n\nStanding outside of the Invalides, Nathalie Kabongo, whose husband worked on Chirac's 1995 and 2002 campaigns, said Chirac reminded her of \"a politics closer to the people.\"\n\n\"`Apart from being president, he was a man (...), a warm man, a man close to people, smiling and with a heart,\" she said. \"We need that sometimes.\"\n\nThose assembled took pictures, shed tears and held signs reading \"Thank you for saying no to the war in Iraq\" as they watched the flag-draped coffin onscreen.\n\nMax Mignard, who came to pay his respects, described Chirac as the \"kindest man in politics.\"\n\nA private family church service for Chirac was celebrated prior to the military tribute and a private funeral was taking place later at the Montparnasse cemetery. A minute of silence was being held in schools and public buildings across the country Monday on France's national day of mourning for its former leader."
