        "text": "A French court has given former President Jacques Chirac a two-year suspended prison sentence for diverting public funds and abusing public trust.\n\nMr Chirac, 79, was not in court to hear the verdict because of ill-health but denied wrongdoing.\n\nPresident from 1995 to 2007, he was put on trial on charges that dated back to his time as mayor of Paris.\n\nHe was accused of paying members of his Rally for the Republic (RPR) party for municipal jobs that did not exist.\n\nThe prosecution had urged the judge to acquit Mr Chirac and nine others accused in the trial. Two of the nine were cleared. The other seven were found guilty and all but one handed suspended prison sentences.\n\nJean de Gaulle, grandson of former President Charles de Gaulle, was handed a three-month suspended term while former union leader Marc Blondel, 73, was convicted but escaped a sentence.\n\nIn 2004, during his presidency, several figures including France's current Foreign Minister Alain Juppe were convicted in connection with the case.\n\nMr Juppe was given a 14-month suspended sentence.\n\nJacques Chirac, mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995, is the first former French head of state to be convicted since Marshal Philippe Petain, the leader of the wartime Vichy regime, was found guilty in 1945 of collaborating with the Nazis.\n\nThe BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris said the verdict would be seen as a stain on Mr Chirac's character.\n\nThe case was divided into two parts: the first count involved embezzlement and breach of trust in relation to 21 bogus jobs; the second related to a charge of illegal conflict of interest concerning seven jobs.\n\nHe was found guilty of both.\n\nThe former president, who had legal immunity during his time as head of state, faced a potential 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros for the employment of more than 20 bogus officials.\n\n\"Jacques Chirac has breached the duty of probity required for public officials, to the detriment of the public interest of Parisians,\" said tribunal judge, Dominique Pauthe.\n\nAlthough he himself was not in court, Mr Chirac's adopted daughter Anh Dao Traxel was present to hear the verdict which she described as \"too, too severe for him\" and a great source of pain.\n\n\"As a family, we should all absolutely support him... for his health for the rest of his life,\" she said in an emotional statement outside the court."
