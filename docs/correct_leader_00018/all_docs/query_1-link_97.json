        "text": "Paris (CNN) -- The French supreme court has rejected a constitutional challenge in the corruption trial of former President Jacques Chirac, allowing court proceedings to move forward after they were suspended in March.\n\nThe court provided no specifics on the case after announcing its ruling Friday.\n\nChirac is accused of multiple counts of misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris before he became president.\n\nJudge Dominique Pauthe had put the trial on hold until June 20.\n\nLawyers for another defendant in the case had argued that the charges should be quashed because too much time has elapsed between the alleged offenses and the trial.\n\nThe argument was raised by Jean Yves Le Borgne on behalf of his client, Remy Chardon, 63, who was Chirac's chief of staff from 1993 to 1995.\n\nPart of the reason for the delay in bringing Chirac to trial is that he had immunity from prosecution during the 12 years he was president of France.\n\nChirac, 78, is accused along with nine other people of embezzling money from the city of Paris when he was mayor. He allegedly used public money to pay people to work for his political party, the RPR, and paid others to perform jobs that did not really exist.\n\nChirac was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995, the year he became president.\n\nFormer French Prime Minister Alain Juppe was sentenced in December 2004 for his role in the affair, but Chirac benefited from presidential immunity at the time. After Chirac left office in May 2007, he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter.\n\nChirac could face a 10-year sentence and a fine of 75,000 euros (about $100,000) if found guilty of using the employees to work for his party.\n\nThe former president denies the accusations.\n\nThe city of Paris dropped a civil suit against Chirac after he and his party paid back about $3 million.\n\nHe left the presidency with low approval ratings, but his popularity has bounced back in recent years."
