        "text": "On Oct. 31, 2013, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during his official visit to France, paid a visit to the 81-year-old former French President Jacques Chirac.\n\nWang Yi said to Jacques Chirac that you are a well-known western politician in China, and an old and good friend of the Chinese people. In the 12 years of your administration, the Chinese leaders and you jointly promoted the realization of leapfrog development of China-France relations, and the achievements of the bilateral relations today are inseparable from your efforts. Your friendliness towards China is from the heart, from your deep understanding of the Chinese history and culture, and from your high recognition of China's development prospects, as well as from your sense of responsibility in proposing the establishment of a multipolar world and harmonious coexistence of different cultures.\n\nJacques Chirac said that I have high respect to China and the Chinese people. I love China and the Chinese culture. Every time I visited China, I was deeply impressed by the power of China's great civilization, increasing my reverence and enthusiasm to China. I am deeply convinced that with the further development of China, China's important ideas and wisdom will play a more and more important role in the world."
