Point Arguello is a headland used as a launch site by the United States Navy. Point Arguello was first used in 1959 for the launch of military and sounding rockets. It was transferred to the United States Air Force in 1964,[1] at which time it became part of Vandenberg Air Force Base.[2]

There were six launchpads at Point Arguello.[citation needed] It was located south of Vandenberg Air Force Base, and was named by George Vancouver for José Darío Argüello, a Spanish frontier soldier who was Commandant of the Presidio of Santa Barbara and acting governor of Alta California.[3]
