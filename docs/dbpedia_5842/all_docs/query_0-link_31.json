Jesup, • ^ ~ Chief Quarter&iaster's Office, Tampa, October 21 ylS3&. Cteneral: I have the honor to renort the operations of the quarter- master's department in Florida durin^he past year, under my direction, as follows: To meet tlie contingency of hostile operations against the Seminole In- , dians, supphes vmnd fir^t accumulated at St. Augustine and Tampa, in August, IS^^. flbm the former depot supplies were famished to estab- - ^ lish f»osts on the Atlantic coast, to wit: New Sm\\Tna, Indian river, and Fort Dallas, on the Miami river. The attention of the commanding general being first directed to the protection of the frontier settlements, and Pilatka, on the St. John's, being a belter point for sending supplies up the St. John's and Ochlawaha rivers^ Pilatka was substituted as a depot, and St. Augustine broken up. Temporarj'^ posts were established at Orange creek, Okehumke, the Witlilacooche, Hillsborough, and Flint rivers, on the high-road leading from Tanilpa to Pilatka, and 'on Lakea Hains and Griffin, the head- waters of the Ochlawaha. A depot was estab- lished at Savannah for hirnishing a depot at Indian river, the magnitude of which position was increased in consequence of the location o/a line of posts westerly from that point to the Kissimme river. The operations being wholly of a protective character up to this time, and the Indians, since their nuii*ders at Indian river and the trading-house on Pease creek, retiring to their assigned limits in south Florida, where active operations, if necessaiy, would take place, the importance of Tampa as a depot be- came greatly enhanced, and large supplies were required and received at this point from Brevet Gfl4onel Hunt, at New Orleans. From Tampa, posts on an easterly line, to connect with the posts west from Indian river, were esiablished, with a sub-depot on Pease creek. The line thus ad- vanced caused all the posts to the north of it to be abandoned, and the troops concentrated on this line and south of it. A sub-depot was placed on the Manatee river to supply the posts on a line to Chokkomicklu, another point on Pease creek, where the burnt store stood; here, also, a bridge of 120 feet span was constnicted, for operating to the south, if ne- <jessary. Two other posts were established at Charlotte harbor — one at St. Joseph's island, and the other at the Corlosahatchee river. The great number of posts located, and frequent changes of the stations of the troops, required a large amount of land and water transportation and material, all of which was furnished to meet the wants of the service and the wishes ■of the commanding general — which, upon retiring firom the immediate command of the troops in Florida, he took occasion to express in a letter to 'Auijust 15 8 io,uoo oa [ M ^^- ;x* I .330 me, herewith iraniiSitteA. An efficient trt(fvi^^f-^H*/wa5ons and tnnmj^ was* early organized, and kept in activity, inoving with the troops iruougli-* the conn try, and keeping up supplies at the several posts, from tiioe to tinte, of subsistence, forage, and quartermaster's stores. Before any of the steamers belonging to the quartermaster's department could be sent to the Atlantic coast of Florida from the Gulf of Mexico, the services of a char- tered steamer were needed to communicate between Savaniiah and In- dian river, until in February, when she was. relieved by the iron pro- peller Ashland and steamer Monmouth; tliese kept ti^e depot at* Indian river supplied until it became necessary to lay them \\\\\\)^ jeing un!^:ervico- able. These were old boats when sent to Florida. The water tran.s|X)r- lalion to Tampa consisted of steamers Fashion, Colonel Clay, and Derossett. In February the Derossett became disabled, and the steamer Planter was purchased by Col. Hunt to supply her place. The Derossett was subsequently repaired, with the means in the department at Tampa, and has since been sold at New Oriels. At eighteen postiiestablished ,fiiU and safe protection was given to the public property, and the troops liberally supplied with camp equipage. At the permanent posts, storehouses, stables, hospitals, and quarters for men and officers , h ave been erected. In all cases, this work has been accomplished by the labor of the tro^fc?, with materials obtained by them in the countrj'— a carpenter in but fc\\^ases being hired to instinct the laborers. In July, a reduction of the land transportation was ordered, and the quantity not required in Florida directed to be sent to Texas. The steamer ** Fashion\" has transported the surplus transportation, and, ia one more trip, wilLfini:^h that serviv-e. There remain in Florida fifty- five mule-teams, one hundred battery horses, and seventy horses in the quartermaster's department for express and other purposes; (sixty four horses and forty mules remain to go to Texas.) The depot 'at Tampa, at first under the control of Major Haskins, was, on account of his en- feebled condition, assigned as the station of Brevet Major Donaldson. Of the efficiency of Major Donaldson I cannot speak in too high praise, and the commanding geiieral's notice of his services renders it superfluous for me to say more. The depot at Indian river was assigned to Captain Jor- dan, to whom credit is due for its organization, and for meeting the wants of the department on the east side of Florida. To both these officers I am indebted for a zealous support in the conduct of the department. I have drawn upon you for ninety-seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven dollars and forty-three' cents in tfie past year, and received thirty-one thousand five hundred and ten dollars from the treasury and other sources, as per statement herewith. This is the amount that has passed through my hands for the department in Florida. Of the expend- itures in connexion with this service at Savannah and New Orleans, reports from the officers at those places will give information. Details concerning the depots at Tampa and Indian river will be furnished by the officers immediately in charge of them. I take occasion to urge again the establishment of an '^army wagon-yard,'' connected with the Quar- termaster's department. I imagine no civilived nations at this day would intrust to contractors the manufacture of gun-carriages, <fcc.; and no of- ficer of experience will dispute that the transportation of the army should be as perfect and free from blemish as the work turned out from our arseuals. I trust, ^reReral, that you will make exertions to obtain the appropnatiou from Congress, at its next session, asked f-r in my rorre- , spondence with you oit this subject. ^ V \"^^^ Respectfully submitted. a; C.

Thousands of acres are covered with dwarf mangroves as shown above. Towards the coast the mangrove trees grow very large and with their prop- roots FORM impenetrable FORESTS. Although Lake Okeechobee naturally has a nearly stable water-level, in the greater part of the Everglades the level of the surface-water has normally a seasonal fluctuation. Thus in the rainy season, the summer, the Everglades should be brimful of water ; on the other hand, in the dry season, the winter, the surface should be more or less dry. At this period the Everglades represent a low prairie, while in the wet season they really constitute a vast lake. When seen at this high-water stage, some of the early Spanish expeditioners consid- ered the whole basin a vast lake and it was recorded ''Lake Mayami.\" Various minds have conceived various schemes for the ''development,'' of the Everglades, or \"devilopmenf as inter- preted by some. Among these ideas \"drainao^e'' and \"farming\" have been *' Front Prairie.''

Since the beginning of this century five water highways, preliminary to the dredging of drainage canals, have been added to the natural outlets for the enor- mous amount of water of this spring. The sudden upsetting of nature's rou- tine of ages did not better matters, to say the least. Droughts and \"freezes\" are said to be now more frequent than formerly. Large areas of land between the Everglades and the ocean are said on «rood authoritv to have been rendered worthless for farming by seriously low- ering the water-table and eliminating the capillary water-supply necessary for the existence of vegetation, particularly of cultivated crops.

It fringes the lake, the fringing area becoming wider southward on both sides of the lake. The main basin has a gentle curve west- ward. The eastern side follows the rock rim of the eastern coastal region of Florida; its western side follows a nearly similar curve along the Indian Prairie and the Big Cypress Swamp. The Ten Thousand Islands form a kind of delta of the Everglades. There much of the surface-water finds its way to the Gulf of Mexico through a labyrinth of myriad channels. In addition to the delta-like outlet, the measureless water of the Everglades is constantly escaping in numerous surface streams flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, through the coast- wise lagoons, Bay Biscayne and the Bay of Florida, through the Caloosahatchee flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, through subterranean streams, some of which show themselves as springs of fresh water off the shores of tho ocean or in tlie coastal saline lagoons and bays, through the honeycombed limestone of sections of the coastwise ridge on the east, through general seepage and through evaporation from a surface of about three hundred thousand acres. These are the natural outlets for the Everglades' waters, not only unmeasur- able but also unmanageable on occasion. The balance of the surface waters and of the water-table, regulated through ages, was normally beneficial to the nat- ural vegetation of the Everglades them- selves and all the surrounding territory. With this water protection, climate was tempered and fires, at first a natural calamity as a result of lightning and later artificially started by the methods of primeval man, were relatively rare and evidently circumscribed. Further- more, the many elevated parts of the Everglade prairie and the islands were tillable during the seasonal period of low water — the winter. Curiously enough the winter is the proper season for the growing of vegetable crops in that latitude. Likewise, under these natural conditions, the water-table was 42d Congress, 3d iytsHion, \\ HOUSE OF EErEESENTATlVES. { Ex. Doo. No. a. SAC AND FOX AND SEMINOLE INDIAN EESERVATIONS. LETTER FROM THE ACTING SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, RELATIVE TO A recent survey of the line dividing the CreeTc ceded lands ^ upon ichich the Sac and Fox and Seminole Indians have reservations. December 19, 1872.— Referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs and ordered* to be printed. Department of the Interior, Washington, D. C, December 17, 1872. Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a coinmunica- tion, dated the 7th instant, from the Coniinissioner of Indian Affairs, inviting the attention of tliis Department to a recent survey of the line dividing the Creek ceded hinds, upon which the Sac and Fox «^nd Semi- nole Indians have reservations, from the Creek reservation, as provided for by the eighth article of the treaty with the Creeks, of June 14, 18GG. (U. S. Stats., vol. 14, p. 785.) An examination of the field-notes and plats of said survey, which has been approved, discloses the fact that the line above referred to divides the reservations of the Semiiioles and Sacs and Foxes, lea\\iiig extensive improvements east of said line, and, consequently, within the Creek country. In view of the facts stated it is recommended that legislation be had authorizing negotiations with the Creek Indians for the purchase of that ])ortion of the reservation of the Seminoles and Sacs and Foxes thrown, by the survey, into the Creek reserve. I have, therefore, prepared, and herewith transmit a draught of an act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate with the Creek Indians for the cession of a portion of their reservation occupied by friendly Indians, and respectfully commend it to the favorable consid- eration of Congress, to the end that the Government may be enabled to execute the existing treaty stipulations with the Indians interested.

Department of the Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, Washington, D. C, December 7, 1872. Sir : I have the honor to invite the attention of the Department to the following, viz : By the 3(1 article of the treaty concluded with the Creek Indians June 14, 18G0, (U. S. Stats, at Large, vol. 14, p. 785,) said Indians cede to the United States, for the settlement of friendly Indians and freed- men, the west half of their entire domain, to be divided by a line running north and south. In consideration of the cession made by the 3d article of the treaty concluded with the Seminole Indians March 21, 1866, (U. S. Stats, at Large, vol. 14, p. 755,) the United States, by said article, granted to said Indians, out of the Creek ceded lands, a reservation containing 200,000 acres. In consideration of the improvements upon the reservation of the Sac and Fox of the Mississippi tril>e of Indians, ceded by the 1st article of the treaty concluded with said Indians February 18, 1867, (U. S. Stats, at Large, vol. 15, p. 495,) the United States, by the 6th article of said treaty, granted to these Indians a reservation out of the Creek ceded lands, containing about 750 square miles. The Seniinoles and the Sacs and Foxes have settled upon their re- spective reservations, and have made improvement thereon, not expect- ing to be disturbed by the survey of the line dividing the Creek ceded lands from the Creek reservation, as provided for by the 8th article of the Creek treaty of 1866, hereinbefore referred to. However, the surv^ey has subsequently been completed, and approved by the honorable Secre- tary of the Interior, under date of the 5th February last. Upon an examination of the plats and field-notes of said survey, it is found that the dividing-line cuts through a portion of the reservations above re- ferred to, for the use of the Seminole and Sac and Fox Indians, leaving extensive iin])rov\"ements east of said line, and, consequently, within the Creek country. In view of the foregoing, I respectfully recommend that the matter be aid before Congress, with the request for legislation authorizing the Department to negotiate with the Creek Indians for the purchase of the lands thus thrown into the Creek reserve, to the end that the tribes who have settled down in good faith, and entere<l into agricultural pursuits, may not be deprived of the fruits of their industry, through no fault of theirs, and, further, that the Government may be enabled thereby to carry out existing treaty stipulations with the Indians interested.

No quibbling marked their predictions. The blossoming of the saw grass first attracted their attention. This blooming was out of season, and un- timely blooming of this Everglades grass has been for centuries a signal to the Seminoles to stop, look, and listen. They sensed a certain tenseness in the stillness which hung over the 'Glades; the smaller birds stopped singing and chirped nervously, and their flights were short and furtive — t heir general drift was northward and westward. The great buzzards, too, were ap- prehensive and seemed to group themselves a s though in consultation. Instead of taking their usual great, gliding flights, they went aloft and nerv- ously beat the air — their drift was northward and westward.

The Seminoles did not under- take a miles-per-hour pre- diction of the wind be- cause that is a white pian's classification. They did, however, graphically de- scribe its velocity, and the wind was as terrific as they said it would be. Not until the storm was actu- ally in progress did the white man with his science know about it, and then ships in the storm zone wirelessed the news. This was a week before it struck the Florida coast. Almost hourly, the weather men radioed ships for additional information, and from these reports they computed the speed, intensity, and general di- rection of the storm. Eventually falling barom- eters in Porto Rico and along the Florida east coast signalled the storm's arrival.

Four weeks before the storm the Indians told of a seven-foot wall of water that would sweep over the 'Glades. When it came, it was six feet high and tore through the dyke of Lake Okeechobee. An error of a single foot in such an estimation most certainly does not discredit the abQin- of the Seminoles to read \"signs.\" The general destruction which they predicted was sufficient to devastate a part of Palm Beach and Palm Beach County to the extent of nearly $150,000,000. The recovery of more than three thousand bodies of storm victims was horrible proof that the loss of life was appalling. Having read the **signs,\" the Seminoles prepared a brief migration into the land of their brothers, the Tallahassees, far to the north and west of their own threatened territory. Before leaving they urged their white friends to follow them to safety. But white men no longer believe in \"signs.\" They listened with supercilious amusement to the earn- est pleadings of the Indians and, with deprecating gestures, told the Seminoles to be on their way. The Seminoles went ; the white men stayed. Inso- far as is known, not a single Seminole was lost in the storm. Chagrined, undoubtedly at their own in- abilit}^ to forecast the intensity of the approaching storm and seeking to find some solace, the white men are seeking now to disprove the accuracy^ of the Seminole forecast of the storm by seiz- ing upon the official state- ment from the Red Cross headquarters at West Palm Beach that on the third day following the storm, a Semi- nole arrived at headquarters seeking aid for his people. I saw this Indian and he did not appear as bedraggled as some of the rest of us. From his appearance one would say that he had been more regu- larly fed in the days immediately preceding his appearance at headquarters than most of us who were engaged in rescue work. Certain it is that none of us who made the first trips into the 'Glades saw any Seminoles. If the white people who have seized upon this Indian's appearance at headquarters were more intimately acquainted with the Seminoles, they would find less comfort in his re- quest for aid. The Seminoles are not naturally greedy or grafting, but contact with white men has given them new ideas of conduct. From us they have adopted the idea that if something usable may be had for the asking, it does no harm to ask. A day or two after the Miami storm in 1926, word reached the Seminoles that prodigious quantities of food, clothes, and other desirable supplies were being given away in the dty. Chief Tony Tommy marshaled his band into town after admonishing his people to look as pitifully needy as possible, but when they arrived, he saw what a mess the white man was in, so they wandered back into the 'Glades as silently as they came. Some days later, a rescue detail was sent to them but the rescuers found that, except for a rather discomfiting wetting, the Indians had suffered no ill effects from the storm. The Indians also predicted this storm, but seem to have attached little importance to its coming because they stayed in the 'Glades to weather it. And what of the white man with his radios, barometers, and whatnots of science to foretell storms? He was only twenty-four days behind the Indians with their saw-grass blossoms, crickets, and buz- zards. And he was doubtful as to the certainty of its com- inz. For six d a v s he charted its progress along a course as true as any crow ever flew — direct for Palm Beach. Unlike the Semi- nole, he fed himself on false hopes. Saturday, he allowed that the storm might strike Palm Beach; Sunday morn- ing he said that it probably ^ would. Sunday afternoon it did. Sunday evening three thousand lives had been snuffed out and $150,- 000,000 worth of property and improvements awaited replacement. If the white man had sensed the same certainty in his science that the Seminole sensed in his \"signs,\" the loss of life might have been negli- gible. There was ample time for the removal of everybody from the threatened area. The Seminoles proved that. And who are these Seminoles? Today, they seem to be chiefly important as items of in- terest to those who visit Florida in winter. They are more significant than that, however, even though they may be no more important economically and socially. Until 1750, the Seminoles were a part of the Creek Confederacy and lived in Georgia. The name properly is Simanoli, and means rene- gade or runaway. Statements as to why the Seminoles with- drew from the Creek Confederacy differ.

It does not appear that economic discontent could have caused their \\vithdrawal.

And there is no evidence that they ever wanted them, anyway. They did, however, appreciate loyalty and when the Geor- gians demanded that the Seminoles return their slaves, the Seminoles stoutly refused. This led to one of the most humorous incidents in the military history of the United States, and it gave Georgia the distinction of being the only state in the Union that ever carried on an independent foreign war. This war was unique. There was no fighting. The Georgians couldn't find the Seminoles. They found plenty of trails but no Indians. The Seminoles had a cute trick of tramping a perfectly evident trail, broad and inviting. Then, individually, or in small groups, they jumped the border of the trail, climbed up into the trees, draped themselves with Spanish moss, and kept very quiet while the Georgian marched bravely on. Georgia's private war fizzled out in 1810. Then came Andrew Jackson and the Seminoles found them- selves with a real war on their hands. So did the country. The United States, using seven successive generals, and spending $17,000,000, fought the Seminoles for seven years. The army finally succeeded in rounding up fifty braves and twenty canoes near what we now know as Fort Lauder- dale. The captives, however, were immediately released, and the Seminoles recognized as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes.\" More than that, the Government recognized the Seminoles as a Nation and granted them autonomy. Op-peel-it ojusi That is, it is to laugh heaps. No Semi- nole ever surrendered ; his losses were practically negligible. It was not within the power of the government to give the Seminole something that he had always had ; so being recog- nized as a civilized tribe and as a nation did not flatter the Seminoles a bit because they never recognized the white man's capacity to flatter them. Even the four hundred Seminoles still left in Florida today secretly regard us as a people who lie, cheat, and steal, and, consequently, are en- tirely unworthy as a people for them to associate with. Despite the fact that in 1916 all Indians were given full citizenship by Congress, the Seminoles refused to accept it. The Seminole wars seem to have been wantonly precipi- tated, and appear to have been forced by that spectacular soldier, Andrew Jackson, who, after his great defense of New Orleans, became a national hero. He was of the South and when the planters appealed to him personally for a solu- tion of their troubles over escaping slaves, their appeals con- cerned something that he well understood. When he told the nation that the Seminoles must be driven out of Florida, that settled the matter. Yet, after the war had been in progress several years, bewildered General Jessup wrote to the President, \"We are attempting to remove the Indians when they are not in the way of the white settlers, and when the greater portion of the country is unexplored wilderness of the interior of which we are ignorant.\" Then Florida, in 1819, became the property of the United States and all America felt that it now had a free hand to deal with the savages as each and everyone saw fit. The slave-holders along the northern border felt free to organize independent excursions to recover their slaves. This led to excesses and the government found that the raiding planters were almost as much of a problem as the Seminoles. Then, somebody conceived the idea of deporting the Seminoles to an isolated spot in the West and a great pow- wow was held. Arkansas was chosen as the objective but the Indians stipulated that a delegation should be permitted to visit the \"far country\" to see how they liked it. This request was granted and the government allowed the Indians to migrate to the land of the Pawnees as best they could. But they were violently received. The Pawnees stole their ponies, blankets, and all other possessions and beat them out of the country. Glad to escape with their lives the Semi- noles, weary and worn, returned to Florida and declared most emphatically that they didn't like the \"far country.'* Before much more could be done about it, they had melted away into the Everglades and the Army was again con- fronted with the task of rounding them up. These Florida Seminoles are today the only independent people living within the confines of these United States. Technically, they are still at war with us, if we are not with them. They seek no favors and accept none. During President Cleveland's administration when the government tried to give the Seminoles plows, wagons, hoes, and the like,. Chief Tiger Tail pointed scornfully toward a settlement of shiftless whites and said, \"Indian no want. Give 'em him.\"\" The government has tried to educate the Seminoles and to make them feel that they would have a greater part in the plan, invited them to help build the schoolhouse under the supervision of the man who was to be their teacher. They worked faithfully, and the night before school was to open, teacher and intended pupils lay down in their blankets to sleep together. In the morning, the teacher awoke to find himself alone. The Indians would have none of it. One way and another, the Seminoles have always main- tained comparative freedom of action and thought, and they still maintain it even when it comes to hurricanes. And from their last demonstration, it appears that they still re- tain the ability to out-guess the white man. The young bucks have departed largely from the wearing of the tunic, bright sash, and close-fitting, deerskin leggins^ but they still wear many shirts and as many loosely tied, bright colored handkerchiefs around their necks as they possess. But the dress of the women has not changed. They still wear no headdress at all. They wear a straight, full skirt,*^ long enough to hide their bare feet, and the long sleeved, ful^ fitting waist which fails to meet the skirt band by about two inches. They satisfy their longing for adornment with metal breast-plates, bracelets, and strings of bright beads. Their houses are still largely of palmetto leaves and skias. of wild animals with a floor of split logs raised about .t\\y(f feet above the ground. Some of the more progressive and less stubborn have recently built board houses. They have never felt any great economic pressure but they have found tourists a source of easy wealth, and this has. enabled them to turn the white man's motor car into the Indians delight, and with it they ramble over Florida at wilL I s I j ( \\ \"NOT rOR SCHOOL BUT FOR LVT' NATIVE AMERICAN »wr(yrwin to iNniAjt bdvcation ToLvn 18 FEBRUARY 3, 1917. 8 The Florida Seminoles— Their Right in the Everglades By Minnie Moore- Wilson, Kissimmee, Florida. T HE characteristic of -** Americans since that July day in 1776 has been to \"wake somebody up\" and when we stop to think of the dormant strength that has been stored up in this red race of the Ever- glades for more than a century— of 600 people that have been denied liberty and a square deal, then we must know that the citizens of Florida, when fully aroused as to the true condition of the vanquished and unfortunate Seminole will rise up and demand justice. The Legislative halls at Tallahassee are now vibrant with the affairs of the State. More than one hundred men have answered to the roll call and bills for moral uplift, bills for material pro- gress and bills for financial aid will be presented. \"What will the Legislature of 1915 do for the Seminole?\" This subject is all-absorbing and is ap- pealing to every red-blooded, white American in Florida and the homeless condition of these native people, the original owners of all this country, is touching the instinct of chivalry of all Florida's Indians. A STATE PROBLEM Florida's Indian population is a State problem and not a National problem; This article was read before the Legislative Committee at Tallahassie, and was endorsed by same. Also before the Reciprocity meeting of the Jacksonville Womens' Club with endorsement by them. these aborigines occupy a unique posi- tion, different from that of any other tribe in the United States. First they were Spanish subjects, but, with the hoisting of the American flag in 1821^ they came as a part of the new terri- torial possessions, —citizens of the Unit- ed States. Under Spanish rule, Florida was home to them and in peace they possessed lands, cattle, indigo plantations and orange groves. With the influx of white settlers from the Southern States, who came with their slaves and blood hounds, the Seminoles commenced to retire to- wards the Everglades. In 1855 when the U. S. Government: deeded to Florida all her \"swamp and over- flowed lands\" the Indians came as apart of the possessions, as they oc- cupied the Everglade territory. Thus they became a State problem, as micch a part of Florida as the land itself! Florida accepted this gift of the Ever- glade country from the National Govern- ment. Can she repudiate her resposibi- lity to her Indians subjects that came as a part of this gift? Of the 58,000 square miles we call the Land of Flowers little remains for the original owners. THE SEMINOLE LAND BILL At the last Legislature, as is well known, a Seminole Land Bill was care- n The Native American JDdlZL Fehruary 3, 191? 35 fully drawn by an intelligent body of men granting a tract of 235,000 acres to the Everglade Indians. The bill passed both House and Senate but was killed on the last day by the Governor's veto. If there was any technicality involved (and no reasonable one has ever been given) then a similar bill should be so framed as to free from any objectionable fea- tures and passed at the approaching Legislature. For the benefit of those not informed, 200,000 acres of this tract are water- covered and utterly worthless for agri- cultural or reclamation purposes, being of **lime stone rock formation full of pot holes and according to the report of the committee on Indian affairs would only serve as a hunting ground, and further that no white men could ever make use of it.'' So today we find our Florida Seminoles stranded in these great morasses, a Na- tion haunted by famine and extinction. Will the democracy of Florida allow a helpless people to be crushed out of ex- istence by a handful of speculators. whose highest thought is the jingle of dollars? This forlorn remnant of a once powerful race are being pushed on and on, by a brute force totally unworthy of Floridians and the white speculator says, * There is no land left for the Seminole, let him make bricks without straw.\" NO ALMS ASKED In making a plea for these bewildered people we only ask that they be given an American chance. No alms are ask- ed, neither charity, nothing but the lands that are theirs by the sacred rights of Governmental treaty. Further making of good citizens is the highest duty of an individual or a State and every Seminole Indian is capable of being molded into a worthy American citizen, fully up to the highest Caucasian standard. The first work for Floridians is to see that these bewildered people have an abiding place, a refuge where they can work out their own destiny without fear of molestation. At the present time, the Seminole selects a home, builds his wigwam and with rude tools clears and fences his little fields. The white man comes along and tells the Seminole to \"move on, move on,\" that he has pur- chased the property. In his anguish, the Indian is silent and uncomplaining and with his little belongings moves on into other trackless wilds. It shoald be the duty of the Floridians to resent with all their strength the enemy of the Seminole,— the man, the bandit, who would rob him of his home. The knowledge of Florida's boundless millions of untenanted acres makes this appeal an easy one, and the opposition may as well realize that the agitation will not cease nor the subject be settled until it is settled right and justice is done the helpless, home-loving Seminole, and thus white America may atone in part, for a cruel ''Century of Dishonor.'' Florida's honor is far greater than her land possessions and to know that the State of Florida has the legal right to adl her Everglade lands is to know that the State of Florida has the legal right to make a flrrant of such lands and thus right a wrong a century old. This Flor- ida of ours, the fairest State in the Southland, is great enough to come to the rescue of the kindly and home-loving Seminoles and to give them a shelter and a refuge in this, the direst hour of their existence. LET FLORIDA DO HER DUTY NOW Let Florida do her duty now and not wait as Oklahoma has done until America asks. *'Why have these red people of the 'Glades been cheated out of their right- ful inheritance,\" for the answer might be an entangling one to unravel. ♦ n ' i: Surely the Everglade country has had enough ugly and destructive publicity, for all Florida suffers today for high pressure sales of water covered Ever- glade lands. The hour has arrived when the voice of Floridians should be heard and the call to right and justice should be sound- ed from every hamlet, town and city of this fair State. No longer should these wards of Florida be denied homes in the country they love so well, and no longer should a stigma on the fair name of Florida be heralded in flaming head-lines to the world. THE DRAINAGE PROBLEM No longer should the great drainage scheme be in the way. It is not a ques- tion of whether the 'Glades can be suc- cessfully drained. It is not a question of subterranean lakes that would require the locks and gates of Pluto's region to cut the water off. It is not a question of $28, 000, 000 to complete the drainage. It is not a question of whether bonds can be sold or not, nor of the enormous * 'drainage tax\" that may continue for half a century, nor of U. S. Court in- dictments and all the propoganda that combine to make the Everglade problem a staggering one; none of these unhappy subjects should be debated. It is the crime against an innocent people that is robbing the Everglade country of a success and a triumph and filling the great drainage scheme with defeat and humiliation. Shall we make of Florida a little Bel- gium by driving the Seminole from his possessions? The tragedy of brave little Belgium must not be repeated in Florida, for this American Nation of ours is looking to and thinking of oppressed humanity as she has never done in the 432 years of her Anglo Saxon existence, and if homes are again denied this red race in the land of their nativity, denied them because they are an innocent and helpless people -if only Florida, of all the forty-eight States in the Union, continues to carry a blot on her escutcheon, then will the smouldering embers of journalistic com- ment and investigation burst forth into a lurid flame of expose as if lighted by a thousand signal fires. Then will an in- quiring and indignant public wait for the answer to the riddle of the Okeechobee sphinx which alone holds the key to this Egypt of America— t/i6 land of the Semi- noles! If injustice be done the Seminoles, will the Everglade lands ever be sold? A Vital Point ii EdncatioH One of our great men has very aptly distinguished between the educated and the uneducated man, in words to the effect, that the educated man sets his own task and keeps himself at it, while the uneducated must serve the task mast- er. Think upon this, students! In our school a large proportion of the students are leaving out the vital point of education. True, they are acquiring knowledge, but they are not training themselves to be masters of self of the situations of daily life. The genuinely educated man places a high value on his life and determines the use he will make of it. He then, of his own will, sets out to accomplish this. Without doubt he could exist by aimlessly passing from day to day, but he would be merely a slave to himself, and all the world. Such a life would hold neither success nor happiness. So, young women and young men, girls and boys, take the advantages you have in the school room and industrial activities to make masterful women and men. Go into your lessons and your work as if you were choosing them rather than having them placed upon you; do your tasks in a spirit of willingness rather than being forced ; in all you do, strive to gain independent thought and action, rather than being pushed or led, so that when you come to take your part in the world's work you will be able to use your lives in a purposeful, helpful way. — Th^ Chemawa American.

Dimock TH ERE are at bay in the swamps of Florida, the last refuge to which they can retreat, the de- scendants of that Osceola whose just defiance of the United States was as heroic an act as history' records. Among them are those who propose to defend and, if need be, die for their homes. It is all too pitiful. A sheriff's posse can follow the trail of these possible bellig- erents to their shacks in the Everglades and shoot them down, at the sacrifice only of the lives of a few of our citizens and — the honor of the Nation. Business will not be disturbed. The daily journals will give the tragedy about half the space devoted to a balloon ascen- sion. But another chapter of shame will be added to the record of our treatment of the Seminoles. Less than a century- ago the substantial habitations of these people, surrounded by well-tilled fields, extended for two hundred miles across the State of Florida. Then, harried and hunted by our forces under General Jackson, their houses and villages were destroyed and they were driven from their homes. Force proving costly, this simple-minded people was tricked by treaties that one blushes to read. There was an open treaty witli chiefs purporting to represent the tribe, an(i a secret one with chiefs as individuals. Paltry as was the compensation promised by the Government for the surrender of a vast territory, it was never paid. Protests by the Governor of Florida and by Colonel Humphries, the Government's own agent, were ignored. The full text of the in- famous treaties may be found in Sprague's '' History of the Florida War.\" South, and again south, we have pressed these people. We have hunted them through their own swamps and driven them to hide in the grass like rats. We have made the United States their tradi- tional foe, the bogie of childhood and the dread of maturity. The visitor to their camps in the swamps may now confront rifles leveled in the fear that he is an offi- cial of the Government. There are three hundred Seminoles in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. As our countrymen have crowded them, they have retreated into the swamps from the land to which they hold the first title. They have been driven into the last ditch, and that last ditch is being drained by our people. No Indian title to the land be occupied 20t 202 THE.

At his hunt- ing camp in the I>ig ('ypress he was civil but silent ; at the trader's store he pre- itt Retak e Preceding From e 204 THE OUTLOOK 28 JaniMuy 1911 A DESPOILED PEOPLE f tended to know no English, and it was only at a moonshiner's camp that he unbent llien we caught him with his family, gave candy to the pickaninny, and photographed the outfit. We promised him prints, and he accepted our assur- ances as if he expected them ; but when later, at the trader's store, we redeemed our promise, he looked as if he were about to faint His eyes followed us as if we were freaks, and he said something to the trader which made him laugh. After- ward the man explained to me : \" He says you no lie. Everybody who comes here wants to get a picture of an Indian. They all promise to send him a copy, and usually some tobacco with it ; but I never before knew one to keep his promise.\" Suddenly the attitude of the Indians toward us changed. They b^;an to un- derstand our English, ate with us when we met in the 'Glades, and were hos- pitable when we invited ourselves to their camps. It was harder to get on with the squaws, and there were some whose con- fidence we never could secure. There were camps, too, which we have not been allowed to enter, although their owners have been friendly — at a distance. A few of the Seminoles can read, write, and keep their simple accounts. At a camp which we were the first white men to visit we saw a Httie book kept by our host On a page half filled with memoranda of alligator hides sold and ammunition and supplies bought we found comments on ourselves : '* good frend, all time, come my camp, me no care, stop 3 days, go new york, come see me next time.\" \" no lie, all rite, get mad easy.\" The getting mad referred to was merely a manifestation of indignation at some vile expressions for which our race, and not his, was responsible. We had been in his canoe in the 'Glades when he met and hobnobbed with an aDigator-hunter whom we knew. The conversation of the white man was crystallized obscenity, and its vileness was permeating the vocabulary of the Indian. Soon after the hunter had passed on the Seminole asked : •' Where good white man live ? He no come here.** When I sought his opinion of the trader at whose store I had first met him, he nodded vigorously : ** Him good ojus [much], no lie, no cheat Injun boy, me think so.\" I asked how he liked a certain mission- ary, who was a far better friend to him than the trader, but who lacked the tact with which the latter abounded. \" Him holowaugus [no good], Injun no want white man* God. Want Injun God. Mission man talk, talk, talk, Jesus Clist all time.\" The Seminole's prejudice against white men becomes positive dislike of mission- aries and hatred of Government men. When a mission was established at Immo- kalee (Home), the Indians fled to the swamp. A recently established mission is on practical lines. It consists of a hospital, with medical attendance and advice free, a trading store where supplies are sold at cost, and a home where the red man is always welcomed. The Indian needs to be taught our language and our industries, and untaught his superstitions and dis- trust of his white friends, before he tackles our theologies. From this little mission flows about the only good influence that reaches the Semi- nole of the swamps and the 'Glades. When he touches the civilization of the east coast of Florida, he is plied with the strong drink which is poison to his race, but which few people of the wild can resist. On the western borders of his habitat he finds white hunters slaughter- ing the deer, killing the alligators, and trapping the otter, which belong by inher- itance to him and upon which the support of his family depends. The Seminole is a good deal of a man, and has preserved much of the dignity of demeanor which his heritage of freedom gave him. While camping with one of them in the Big Cypress a negro refugee from the swamp came to our fire. He was hungry, and I made up a parcel of grits, bacon, and coffee for the poor fellow, whose appearance appealed to my S)mi- pathies. While I was gathering the stores the negro went out with the Indian to bring in wood for our fire. As they returned I could read the history of their races in the face, form, and bearing of each. The negro slouched along with obsequious 205 < V face, furtive glance, and back bent to its burden. The Seminole strode in advance with an erectness of carriage and a mien worthy of, say, the President of the Chemical Bank, although his bare legs I mean the Indian's — ^impaired the realism of the illusion. I was proud of our conquest of one Seminole camp and of winning the good will of its members. Our hospitable host daily swept the tables on which we were to sleep, and, when we left his camp, accompanied us a day's journey in the from the tail of a belligerent rooster. When a youngster did something that had been forbidden, his father started for the boy with wrath in his eye and a stick in his hand. The youth darted from the camp and ran through the shallow water splashing like a frightened duck. He hid in the swamp for an an hour or two, and when he returned with shy, sidelong glances our host behaved like a Christian father and pretended to have forgotten the act of disobedience. At first the picka- ninnies of the camp were wild as a brood <c LriTLE STANDS BETWEEN THE SEMINOLE AND STARVATION BUT THE FEW REMAINING ALLIGATORS\" Everglades to point out the trails we should take. He laid aside all formality, and would turn from grave converse with us to tickle with a feather the toes of a youngster. With the rest of the camp he shook with laughter over a vaudeville per- formance by a puppy that seized a pig by the tail and rolled over and over in a wild attempt to twist it off. When the squealing young porker had escaped his tormentor by dragging him over the fire- logs, the exuberant canine, by way of encore, grabbed a mouthful of feathers of young partridges, but they yielded to the example of their elders and our own advances, and we soon became quite chummy. I'hey were a busy, useful, and merry lot of tots. A three-year-old baby trimmed a canoe as if he had been bom in it, while poling it like a veteran. A giri of six mothered a child of two and took the infant with her in the canoe, which she poled a hundred yards out in the 'Glades to fill pails with water for the camp. Daily the babies were scrubbed by the older ones, who often soaped hands, 206 THE OUTLOOK face, and garments indiscriminately ; then, wading waist deep, they rolled the young sters in the water to rinse them. The Camera-man had troubles of his own, for the native American, like a woman of Vanity Fair, wants to face the camera in full regalia. From the feathers in his turban to the shoes on his feet our host wore his ceremonial costume, while the lady of the camp displayed her brightest calico and her beads to the last pound. When our host was in his mellowest mood, I ventured to speak of the good will of our people toward his. Unwarned by his ominous silence, I talked of the missions, and even said a good word for the Government and its work in the West. I would better have kept silent, for I brought stem lines to his face and filled his mind with thoughts of the wrongs his people had suffered from mine. I tried to come back to a lighter theme, but the day had been spoiled. The Seminoles are physically and morally clean, of boundless hospitality and kindly nature. Yet unless action be soon taken it will be too late for our Government to escape the infamy of crushing this help- less people to whom its obligations are peculiarly sacred. The United States constituted itself the guardian of the uncivilized peoples within its borders. Its Indian Department pos- sesses unlimited means, immense equip- ment, and wide experience. It is not to its credit that it has so long delayed con- sidering the condition of the Florida Semi- nole. It should not be impossible to find agents of sufficient sense and sensitive- ness to convince these wronged and justly suspicious wards of the Nation of the present kindly feeling and just disposition of our people toward them. It is too late to remedy the injustice of the past. But the Florida Seminole's fear of being driven from his home should be dispelled forever. He loves that home. When, recently, emissaries came to these Indians from the long-ago deported branch of their tribe, they brought invitation to their Florida brothers to join them in the West. The Seminole would be satisfied with a little of the inheritance that belongs to him, a portion so small as to be of neg- ligible value to us. An Indian Reserva- tion three townships wide and twelve long, running from Boat Landing, would probably be sufficient. This tract of eighteen by seventy-two miles includes a little unused prairie land, some of the Big Cypress Swamp, a small section of the Everglades, a bit of mangrove swamp, and part of the shallow lagoon caUed White Water Bay. It has no important stream, does not touch the coast line, and if it includes a habitation other than Indian I do not recall it, and I have been familiar with the country for many years. Its boundaries should be sternly guarded against the uninvited white hunter, tourist, or trader. Whisky ought to be kept out even at the cost of hanging a few dealers, *' to encourage the others.\" \"HE POLES HIS HEAVY CANOE THROUGH THE BIT OF WILDERNESS LEFT HIM The Forest Fire Problem By William Davenport Hulbert LAST summer, in the height of the fire season, our Uncle Samuel noticed that certain lumbermen were cutting timber on a tract of land that lies within the boundaries of a certain National forest in the Cascade Mountains. The land belonged to them, they having purchased it before the reserve was estab- lished, and of course a man may do as he pleases with his own. But our Uncle Samuel didn't like it at all, and he said so. There had been no rain for several weeks, and in the ordinary course of events on the Pacific Coast he did not expect any for several weeks to come. Everything .was very dry, and the needles, twigs, and branches of the felled trees were turning to tinder as fast as they came down. The lumbermen's donkey-engines were throw- ing sparks like so many Roman candles, the logging locomotives were doing the same, and the loggers themselves were smoking their pipes and probably handling matches with more or less carelessness, after the manner of men in general. And the worst of it was that all this was being done at the foot of a timbered slope which belonged to Uncle Sam himself. If a fire once started in those new slashings, it was pretty sure to sweep the whole mountain- side and take everything in sight. There- fore our uncle was much disturbed, and he suggested to the lumbermen that they should suspend operations till the arrival of the first rains. But the lumbermen couldn't see it that way. They were mak- ing money, and they wanted to keep right on making it They refused our relative's request, and he, much to his regret, was not in a position to insist.

All this would 207 Retak e Preceding Frame »» 208 THE OUTLOOK \\h be unimportant if it were not for the fact that the fine needles which form the foliage of a coniferous forest are very susceptible to atmospheric moisture. A heavy dew fairly saturates them, and a very slight increase in the humidity of the air renders them much less inflammable. On the other hand, they dry out almost instantly in direct sunshine or under the touch of a parching bree2;e. An east wind, therefore, acts on a Cascade forest fire very much as the hot blast does on an iron furnace, or as a brand-new bat- tery acts on a gasoline engine. There is something doing immediately it puts in an appearance. But that was not all. This National forest lies mainly on the western side of the Cascades, but, like all other great ranges, the Cascades are very irregu- lar and have many outlying peaks and slopes that face in all directions. It so happened that the particular slope which was worrying our Uncle Samuel looked toward the east. The wind, therefore, was not only hot and dry, but it was blow- ing from the new slashings straight up the mountain-side toward Uncle Sam's own woods. And about four o'clock in the afternoon, when that wind had had sev- eral hours in which to lick every last trace of moisture out of the tangled brush, the slashings took fire. By half-past seven, when the first telephone message reached the Forest Supervisor, the flames had swept a thousand acres, much of it heavily timbered. The Supervisor's office was eighty miles away, but he was on the spot the next day with a hundred men, well armed with shovels and other weapons. The lumber company had already set another hundred at work, and twenty-five more arrived the following morning. The east wind had nearly, though not quite, blown itself out, and just at present the fire was not spread- ing nearly as rapidly as at first. The indications were that there would be a day or two of calm weather, followed by a west wind of more or less strength, and when that west wind arrived the flames would cease their westward progress entirely and begin to travel toward the east, where there was a large body of fine green timber which must be saved if pos- sible. In fact, they had already made a start in that direction by running up a long. steep slope on the eastern side of the valley where the lumbermen had been working. So the Supervisor, after look- ing the ground over, divided his force into two main bodies and sent one of them to the fire's northeastern front and the other to the southeastern, with instruc- tions to work toward each other. It takes brains and experience to fight a forest fire effectively. Shovels and water and dyna- mite are all very well as far as they go, but they alone are not enough. The men sent to the northeastern bor- der found the fire burning in isolated spots, without any continuous front, and spreading very slowly. Probably this was due in part to the fact that the ground was fifteen hundred to two thousand feet higher than where the trouble began, and at such altitudes the dews are heavier than on the lower levels. A forest fire differs from President Lincoln's gunboats in that it cannot navigate freely where the ground is a little damp. These small burning areas were attacked with the shovels, and dirt was thrown on the flames until they were smothered. They were easy. Besides them, however, there were a great many tall \" stubs \" or \" snags,\" which were doing more or less damage — dead trees, standing as erect as ever, but almost bare of bark and branches, and thoroughly dried out by years of exposure to the sun and wind. These infernal machines are much more common in the Northwestern forests than in the Eastern, and are not infrequently two hundred feet or more in height. When a fire reaches the foot of one of them, it goes straight to the top and throws out sparks and cinders, which are carried far and wide to start fresh trouble in unexpected places. Except the wind they are the worst enemies that the fire-fighter has to contend with. For a time they called for very careful watching, but many of them fell within the next day or two, and as fast as they came down they were extinguished. The men on the southeast had a some- what different proposition on their hands. Here the fire was not so scattered, but was advancing with a front that was fairly continuous, though crooked and irregular. It was moving more rapidly, too, for the ground was lower and drier than toward the north. There was little chance of HI t.^ ? 8 A RANCiER PUTTING OUT A GROUND FIRE WITH A WET IJLANKET • * f« \"these small burnlvg areas were attacked with the shovels disposing of it by direct attack, and it seemed wiser to place some impassable obstacle in its way and let it burn itself out. So instead of throwing dirt upon it they cleared a \" fire-line \" along its front, scraping away every^thing that was inflam- mable and leaving only the fire-proof min- eral soil. Within the next two or three days this line was extended northward into the region where the first company was at work, and then, before the west wind arrived, there came an unexpected piece of good fortune — a very slight fall of rain. It wasn't much. To the unini- tiated it might have been too small to amount to anything. But it made a wonderful difference, and the supervisor immediately began paying off his men, keeping only enough to patrol the worst places, where the ground fires were still 210 smoldering and a few stubs still making threats. Then Uncle Sam sat down to count the cost. The actual expenses of fire fight- ing had been about twenty-five hundred dollars, most of which had fallen on him, though the lumber company paid a part. He and the company had each lost about seven million feet of timber. Uncle Sam's was so situated that it would not have been salable for some time to come, and the valuation that he placed"
