        "text": "New vertebrate species continue to be discovered even in well-studied regions with long histories of faunistic investigations. While, in many cases, species discovery results from molecular analyses that show high genetic divergence or other evidence of reproductive isolation among known populations previously classified as a single species (Jackman, 1998; Shaffer et al., 2004; Kuchta, 2007; Feldman and Hoyer, 2010; Jackson et al., 2017; Bingham et al., 2018), other cases involve the discovery of distinctive new taxa (Köhler et al., 2005; Mead et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2018). Both processes have played substantial roles in the large increase in number of recognized amphibian species (Köhler et al., 2005), including in the plethodontid salamander genus Batrachoseps. Batrachoseps is the most species-rich amphibian clade on the west coast of North America; the number of recognized species has increased from four prior to the work of Brame and Murray (1968) to 21, including one with two morphologically divergent subspecies, at present (Jockusch et al., 2015). Six of these species represented newly discovered lineages, primarily from outside the known range of the genus at the time of discovery, that were also straightforward to diagnose morphologically (Brame and Murray, 1968; Marlow et al., 1979; Wake, 1996; Wake et al., 2002). The rest resulted from analyses of molecular data, which led to the recognition of substantial additional genetic diversity and sharp contact zones within a relatively conserved morphology (Yanev, 1980; Jockusch et al., 1998, 2001, 2012).\n\nOn 8 May 2006, Mr. Wes Fritz discovered a large Batrachoseps under debris at the abandoned Coast Guard station at Point Arguello, California, USA on Vandenberg Space Force Base. This region is within the range depicted for Batrachoseps nigriventris (Fig. 1), but ManTech biologist Morgan Ball recognized that this animal was not morphologically consistent with this species and urged a wider search. Base biologist Nancy Sandburg collected a second individual at the same site on 22 May and brought the two individuals to Sweet's lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In size, coloration, and pattern, these individuals were sufficiently similar to Batrachoseps pacificus from the northern Channel Islands that we initially suspected an introduction in materials transported by the Coast Guard from their facilities on Anacapa or Santa Cruz Islands to the mainland station at Point Arguello. Tissue samples assayed by Jockusch confirmed that these were members of the B. pacificus group. However, sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (cytb) did not place the Point Arguello samples within B. pacificus, ruling out a human-mediated introduction from any known population. Instead, these sequences grouped with those of B. minor (Jockusch et al., 2015). Batrachoseps minor is a distant relative of B. pacificus within the pacificus group, one of five strongly supported subgeneric groups within the genus (Yanev, 1980; Jockusch et al., 2015). However, the nearest known population of B. minor is >90 km away, and cytb sequences differed by an average of 4.9% between samples of B. minor and the haplotype from Point Arguello.\n\nThe mitochondrial differentiation and geographic isolation of this newly discovered population led to an expanded search for animals, guided in part by attention to the complex tectonics of the southern Coast and western Transverse Ranges. It also led us to characterize genetic diversity at multiple nuclear loci. The molecular results, in combination with geography and morphology, support the conclusion that these populations merit recognition as a new species. Here we describe this attractive and distinctive species, and name it in honor of David Wake. This species is a member of the B. pacificus species group, but geographically disjunct from the other taxa within this clade. The geographic isolation from close relatives, tiny known range, and near absence of genetic diversity suggest that this lineage is an evolutionary relict.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nMorphology.—Voucher specimens were preserved in 10% formalin following standard protocols and then transferred to 70% ethanol for long-term storage. Morphological measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 mm with a Helios dial caliper by SSS, with the aid of a dissecting microscope for smaller measurements. Clearing and staining with alizarin red (for bone) and alcian blue (for cartilage) followed standard protocols (Hanken and Wassersug, 1981). All specimens used for morphological descriptions have been deposited in museum collections (see species description); collections abbreviations follow Sabaj (2020).\n\nTaxon sampling and sequence generation.—The species-tree analyses of Jockusch et al. (2015) identified B. wakei, new species (there called B. sp. nov.), as a member of the B. pacificus group. We retained all representatives of the B. pacificus group from this dataset (n = 6 for widespread species and n = 2 for narrowly distributed ones, including B. wakei, new species; Fig. 1A), as they were selected to span genetic and geographic diversity within the clade, and greatly increased the sampling of B. wakei, new species (Table 1). The final sample size for B. wakei, new species, varied from 18–25 individuals per marker, except for one marker that had limited variation across the pacificus group, for which only two individuals were sequenced. For cytb, the only available sequence of B. (m.) aridus was also added to the dataset. Supplemental Table S1 (see Data Accessibility) provides voucher and GenBank accession numbers (MW651987–MW652170) for all molecular sequences from B. wakei, new species.\n\nTable 1\n\nKnown populations of B. wakei. Pop is population number shown on Figure 7; n is the number of individuals sampled for at least one molecular marker.\n\nJockusch et al. (2015) included data from six gene regions: the mitochondrial protein-coding marker cytb, two protein-coding nuclear markers (portions of recombination activating gene 1 [rag1] and pro-opiomelanocortin [pomc]), and three largely intronic nuclear markers (parvalbumin [pvalb], myosin light chain, phosphoralatable, fast skeletal muscle [mylpf], and interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 [ilf3]). Methods for DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing, and alignment are as described in Jockusch et al. (2015). Sampling of pomc was not expanded because of its overall low level of variation across the genus. rag1 was rephased for B. wakei, new species, using PHASE 2.1.1 and following the methods of Jockusch et al. (2015), as the additional sequencing revealed additional alleles in the homozygous form. These sequences added support to the previous computational phasing, which had inferred that one individual was heterozygous for two novel alleles.\n\nWe added one additional marker, a largely intronic region of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). This marker was amplified using the primers GapdL890 and GapdH950 (Friesen et al., 1997) and sequenced with either these primers or three newly designed sequencing primers (gapdLseq: 5′–attgcCCTCAATGACCACTTT–3′; gapdHseq: 5′–ctgtaACCGCACTCATTGTCAT–3′; luciae_gdH3'seq: 5′–AT-CACTAAAACACATGCCTGGG–3′). The first two are in the exon region and partially overlap the amplification primers; luciae_gdH3'seq is within the intron and was designed to bypass a very long (20+) polyT stretch at the 3′ end of the intron in a subset of taxa. The amplification mix for gapdh contained 1X ExTaq buffer (Takara), 190 µM each dNTP, 0.25 µM each primer, and 0.25 U ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara), along with 80 ng of template DNA in a 10 µl volume. This mix was cycled using a touchdown program: 94°C for 3 minutes initial denaturation, then 16 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 70°C for 30 seconds, decreasing by 0.5°C/cycle, and extension at 72°C for 1 minute, followed by 24 cycles with a constant annealing temperature of 62°C. Products were checked by gel electrophoresis, cleaned enzymatically using a combination of alkaline phosphatase and an exonuclease, and sequenced using BigDye version 1.1 or 3.1, with varying recipes. A typical reaction mix contained 1 µl of cleaned PCR product as template, 0.5 µl of BigDye, and 1.5 pmol primer in a 7.5 µl reaction. Products were separated on an ABI 3100 or ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer and checked by eye in Sequencher v. 5.1 (Gene Codes Corporation). Indel differences between alleles within an individual were common, and resulted from variation in the length of a polyG tract. Chromatogram traces were compared to call the alleles present in each individual. Phasing for the full dataset was completed computationally using Phase v2.1 (Stephens et al., 2001; Stephens and Scheet, 2005), as in our previous work, and the resulting sequences were deposited in GenBank (MW652171–MW652283).\n\nBatrachoseps attenuatus was selected as the outgroup for all markers, because it was the closest relative that was consistently strongly supported as outside of the full B. pacificus group in gene trees including complete representation of the genus (Jockusch et al., 2015). Batrachoseps stebbinsi was also included, as it is a much closer outgroup in 6 of the 7 markers. However, pvalb lacked support for monophyly of the pacificus group relative to B. stebbinsi, so B. stebbinsi was not formally treated as an outgroup. For B. attenuatus and B. stebbinsi, the ‘a’ allele of each specimen in Jockusch et al. (2015) was arbitrarily chosen. Both alleles were retained for members of the pacificus group.\n\nGenetic diversity in B. wakei, new species.—AMOVA (Excoffier et al., 1992) was used to test for population structure and quantify the proportion of the variation that was distributed among populations of B. wakei, new species. This analysis was run on the allelic data for gapdh and rag1 combined, as these were the only loci to show variation. Missing data were excluded in a pairwise fashion, with distances between populations calculated as percent of alleles that differed using the diss.dist command in poppr v. 2.8.1 (Kamvar et al., 2014) run in R v. 3.5.1 (R Core Team, 2018). We obtained data for at least one of the two variable loci from 23 individuals: two individuals from the southernmost population (RR tracks south), and six to eight individuals from each of the other three populations. AMOVA was run in the R package pegas v. 0.11 (Paradis, 2010), with 1,000 permutations to estimate significance. Haplotype networks were also inferred for sequences of B. wakei, new species, from these two loci in the R package pegas v. 0.11. For gapdh, gaps were treated as equal to substitutions (accomplished using false coding of indels as nucleotide variants).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis methods.—Because relationships may differ across genes as a consequence of multiple evolutionary processes, we used coalescent-based species tree methods to infer the placement of B. wakei, new species. PartitionFinder v. 1.0.1 (Lanfear et al., 2012) was used to select models of evolution for each locus and, where applicable, to test whether a priori candidate partitions should be modeled separately or together. Because different model sets are available in the phylogenetic analysis software packages we used, PartitionFinder was run twice, once comparing all models and once restricting the model set to those available in MrBayes (Ronquist et al., 2012). The Bayesian Information Criterion was used for model selection. For cytb, rag1, and pomc, each codon position was treated as a candidate partition. For ilf3, exonic regions and the two introns were candidate partitions. pvalb, mylpf, and gapdh each consist of a single intron with a very small number of bases in the flanking exonic regions, so they were each analyzed as a single partition. In all PartitionFinder analyses, sites that are coded as gaps in all pacificus group samples, and thus were present only in the included non-B. pacificus group lineages (i.e., B. attenuatus and B. stebbinsi), were coded as a separate partition; these sites were excluded in the phylogenetic analyses. When choosing among partitioning schemes, only those in which these ‘excluded’ sites were treated as a separate partition were considered, to ensure that the model selected was the best model for the sites included in the final analyses.\n\nGene trees were inferred using maximum likelihood (ML) using GARLI v. 2.0 (Zwickl, 2006) and Bayesian inference (using MrBayes v. 3.2.4–pre 3.2.7) on each marker alignment. For ML analyses, ten replicate searches with different taxon addition orders were conducted. Support was estimated with 1,000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates, with one random addition replicate per bootstrap replicate. For MrBayes, the compound Dirichlet tree length prior was used (Zhang et al., 2012), with parameter values (1,βT,1,1). Tree lengths, but not topology or branch supports, are sensitive to the prior mean on tree length, so βT was set empirically based on the length of the maximum likelihood tree. As a result, values of βT ranged from 0.5 for cytb to 10.8 for rag1. Topology and branch lengths were linked across partitions; all other parameters were unlinked. When multiple partitions were present, the command Ratepr=variable was used; this allows different rates for each partition but maintains a common set of relative branch lengths across partitions. Each analysis was run for 10 million generations, using the default value of two independent runs, each with four chains. Examination of estimated sample sizes for all parameters, the standard deviations of split frequencies, and plots of each parameter against generation indicated that the burn-in and run length were sufficient for all analyses. Stationarity was achieved rapidly, and a standard burn-in of 10% was used in all analyses.\n\nAdditionally, we inferred haplotype networks for two nuclear markers in which B. wakei, new species, formed part of a large comb in phylogenetic analysis, following the methods described above. For pomc, the network was inferred using the most probable pair of haplotypes for each individual, as this more accurately depicts the allelic diversity. For ilf3, only two unresolved polymorphisms remained in the ingroup; these were ignored.\n\nRelationships among species were inferred using the quartet-based inference approaches in ASTRAL-III (Zhang et al., 2018), which uses inferred gene trees, and SVDQuartets, which uses site patterns (Chifman and Kubatko, 2014). These two methods are based on the coalescent and thus incorporate incomplete lineage sorting as a cause of discordance across loci; they also accommodate multiple individuals per species (Chifman and Kubatko, 2014; Rabiee et al., 2019). To account for gene tree error, ASTRAL-III was run on three different gene tree sets: the ML trees, ML trees with branches receiving <10% bootstrap support collapsed (Zhang et al., 2018), and a set of 1,000 bootstrap replicates. SVDQuartets was run in PAUP* v. 4.0a168 (Swofford, 2003), with 100 bootstrap replicates to estimate support. To produce the data matrix, all ‘a’ alleles from a given individual were concatenated, as were all ‘b’ alleles. The cytb sequence was concatenated to both the ‘a’ and ‘b’ alleles to maximize the information available in each tip sequence. Taxa sequenced at only 1–2 loci were excluded (or when justified by geography or phylogeny, combined with sequence from another individual to produce a composite sequence), as were sites that were present only in the outgroup. The SVD quartets data matrix contained 116 tips (representing 10 species) and 6,346 sites (5,562 nuclear and 784 mitochondrial), including 1,446 variable sites (1,149 nuclear and 297 mitochondrial). Given the possibility that the mtDNA may have been acquired by introgression, all species tree analyses were run both including and excluding the mitochondrial locus.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe description of B. wakei brings to 23 the number of taxa recognized within the genus Batrachoseps, 22 species and a morphologically divergent subspecies within B. major that is also sometimes treated as a species, B. m. aridus; nine of these taxa belong to the B. pacificus group, making it the most diverse of the five subgeneric groups recognized. The eight taxa previously known within the B. pacificus group occur in three geographic regions (Jockusch and Wake, 2002; Jockusch et al., 2015): coastal southern California and northern Baja California (home to B. gabrieli, B. major, and B. (m.) aridus); the northern Channel Islands (B. pacificus); and the Coast Ranges of central California (B. gavilanensis, B. luciae, B. incognitus, and B. minor). Within each of the mainland regions, the B. pacificus group species are parapatrically distributed, or narrowly allopatric (Fig. 1A). However, neither set of geographically contiguous species constitutes a monophyletic group; this non-monophyly is believed to reflect a biogeographic history in which the central coastal taxa were transported north separately on distinct pieces of land by tectonic activity (Yanev, 1980; Wake, 2006).\n\nThe geographic gap between the central and southern distribution of the B. pacificus group was previously thought to extend from central San Luis Obispo County to the Los Angeles Basin and San Gabriel Mountains, a region occupied by B. nigriventris (Fig. 1A). Among B. pacificus group species, B. wakei falls squarely within this gap. It is geographically closest to populations from the northern Channel Islands. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that these islands have been isolated from the mainland, likely for their entire history, by a saltwater barrier that constitutes a very substantial barrier to dispersal by amphibians (Yanev, 1980). The new species is separated from the nearest documented population in the central coast region by 84 km and from the nearest mainland population in the southern portion of the range by 202 km. The region separating B. wakei from its mainland B. pacificus group relatives is occupied only by B. nigriventris.\n\nBiogeography of B. wakei and the B. pacificus group.—The inability to find other populations of B. wakei has delayed naming the species for a number of years, during which time extensive sampling efforts both near and far were undertaken. The tectonic history of the Santa Ynez Mountains is quite complex and involves over 100 degrees of rotation of the western end, from a position aligned N–S against the coast of what is now northern San Diego County to its current WNW–SSE alignment projecting into the Pacific Ocean (Luyendyk, 1991). Much of this movement has occurred during the estimated times of divergence of species in the B. pacificus group (Wake, 2006), although the areas and durations of submerged and emergent portions of the Santa Ynez range and northern Channel Islands are complex and poorly established. To the north this rotation is compressing the triangular Los Osos Domain (Lettis et al., 2004), creating a series of NW-trending ridges and valleys that closed off the Santa Maria Embayment and elevated the Santa Lucia Range that extends SE from Big Sur to the Cuyama River. Batrachoseps incognitus and B. minor now occupy this ridge, where they occur in microsympatry with B. nigriventris.\n\nThe occurrence of B. wakei in a very restricted coastal terrace habitat raises questions about when and how it reached this habitat. A major fault zone parallel to the San Andreas system (the Hosgri Fault) originates at Honda Point and extends NW mostly offshore, but has three more coastal fragments at Point Sal, Point Buchon, and Point Piedras Blancas, the latter within 5 km of localities for B. incognitus. However, searches at these sites and throughout the Irish Hills inland of Point Buchon have yielded only B. nigriventris. Extensive fieldwork on the distribution of the northern members of the pacificus group and B. nigriventris in the Santa Lucia Mountains leads us to conclude that B. wakei is very likely a true relict species with a tiny range.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity of B. wakei.—Although the placement of B. wakei is variable across different gene trees, in most markers it shows a southern affinity, as expected given its placement in a clade with B. pacificus and B. major (Fig. 1). The exceptions to this are the mitochondrial marker cytb and one nuclear marker, rag1, where B. wakei instead appears more closely related to a central coast species (Supplemental Figs. S1–S3; see Data Accessibility). A key question is what process(es) are responsible for the variable placement of B. wakei across different gene trees. This variation could be explained either by incomplete lineage sorting or by post-speciation gene flow between species (Maddison, 1997; Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009). Adjacent short internodes, as observed in the species tree, provide conditions under which incomplete lineage sorting is expected. The tendency for clades that violate species monophyly to involve geographic neighbors, and samples from range margins, suggests a role for gene flow as well. Additional investigation with a much larger number of markers is needed to robustly test the role of post-divergence gene flow in the evolution of this clade. Given its geographically intermediate position and current isolation, evidence that B. wakei hybridized with B. minor after its separation from the more southern lineages would be particularly interesting, especially since these two species presently occupy very different environments (exposed marine terrace vs. mesic, rocky montane woodland).\n\nThe genetic homogeneity of mitochondrial DNA and other markers in B. wakei is striking, especially in the context of genetic diversity within the genus. The complete absence of variation in cytb across 18 individuals from four populations is particularly unusual and contrasts with the general pattern found in other species of Batrachoseps (Martínez-Solano et al., 2007, 2012; Martínez-Solano and Lawson, 2009; Jockusch et al., 2012, 2020). For example, Martínez-Solano et al. (2007) found multiple haplotypes in the majority of populations of B. attenuatus from which only two individuals were sampled and eight of nine populations from which at least three individuals were sampled. The only exception was a northern population, in a region that shows a signature of a recent range expansion. Similarly, populations of B. attenuatus from islands in San Francisco Bay and the surrounding headlands generally harbored two or more cytb haplotypes, with the only exception hypothesized to have resulted from an anthropogenic introduction (Martínez-Solano and Lawson, 2009). Intraspecific variation has been studied in less depth in other species, which show the same general pattern of extensive variation, both within and between populations, especially in mitochondrial cytb sequences (Jockusch et al., 2001, 2012, 2020; Martínez-Solano et al., 2012). The extremely low level of genetic diversity in B. wakei extends to the nuclear genome and is low even in comparison to single-population samples of other species of Batrachoseps.\n\nExtremely low levels of genetic diversity result from genetic drift in association with certain demographic processes. One scenario is a bottleneck in the recent past, followed by an extended period at a low population size (Nei et al., 1975). Low genetic diversity may also be a consequence of a recent range expansion. Serial subsampling of diversity as a population expands leads to loss of diversity along the expanding range front (Slatkin and Excoffier, 2012). For this scenario to explain the lack of diversity, the species must have been more widespread, with either extinction eliminating the source populations or, alternatively, these persisting and awaiting discovery. The much lower sea levels during Pleistocene glacial maxima provided an expanded area of potential occupancy. At the estimated sea level minimum during the last glacial cycle of greater than 100 m below present with the California coast estimated to have been located more than 10 km seaward of its current location off Point Arguello (Reeder-Myers et al., 2015). Additionally, if the species is restricted to marine terrace habitats, sea level fluctuations would be expected to result in serial subsampling.\n\nConservation status of B. wakei.—Two features of B. wakei are important to consider in making decisions that affect its habitat and conservation: the lack of genetic diversity and its small range size. The limited genetic diversity signals that the effective population size is very low and is expected to limit the adaptive potential of the species. Small range size is a major predictor of endangerment in many taxa, including amphibians (Sodhi et al., 2008; Pincheira-Donoso and Hodgson, 2018). A recent analysis (Tietje and Rödel, 2018) found that range size was far more important than other tested variables (measures of body size, abundance, and latitude) in predicting lineage duration in amphibians. The tiny known range of B. wakei is at the extreme lower end of amphibian range sizes.\n\nRange estimates calculated from IUCN Red List data (v. 6.1 shape files) identified nine salamander taxa (of 564 included species) with a range size below 5 km2 (IUCN, 2018). Of these, three (Plethodon ainsworthi, Nototriton tapanti, and Oedipina paucidentata) are poorly known; each appears to have only been collected once (i.e., at one locality on one day; Brame, 1968; Good and Wake, 1993; Lazell, 1998), with no new specimens since their descriptions, and the validity of P. ainsworthi has been questioned (Himes and Beckett, 2013). Three additional species are in highly specialized, geographically restricted habitats: a single cave system (Gyrinophilus subterraneus; Besharse and Holsinger, 1977), a 4.8 km2 marine island (Oedipina maritima; García-París and Wake, 2000), and at high elevations on a volcanic peak in Lake Nicaragua (Bolitoglossa insularis; Stark et al., 2014). The other three species (Cryptotriton monzoni, Bolitoglossa indio, and Urspelerpes brucei) resemble B. wakei in having been collected on multiple occasions, and not having obvious geographic restrictions on their distributions. They have all been discovered at additional localities since the IUCN assessment was completed and are now known to be considerably more widely distributed (Sunyer et al., 2012; McCranie and Rovito, 2014; Pierson et al., 2016; Pierson, pers. comm.). Thus, B. wakei falls in the bottom 1% for salamander range size.\n\nIn 13 years since the first individuals of this species were discovered, we and others have surveyed an area encompassing 475 km2 surrounding the known range of this species. This effort has managed to extend the range by a total of just 3.5 km, within a very narrow elevational band. Under good surface conditions, B. wakei can be found at moderate abundance within this area. This makes B. wakei unusual in being a species that can be found consistently under good conditions in its tiny range. In this regard, it resembles G. subterraneus (Niemiller et al., 2010) and Dendrotriton xolocalcae (Taylor and Smith, 1945). We predict that continued efforts to find additional populations may be successful, as somewhat similar habitat exists along the coast to both the north and south. Thus, survey efforts along the coast should continue to include coastal terrace habitat at Point Conception (20 km SSE), where an area of approximately 10,000 hectares was recently protected through acquisition by The Nature Conservancy and is not open to the public, relict dune sheets on the north side of Point Sal (36 km NNE), and the coastal slopes of the Irish Hills north of Point Buchon (75 km N). Additionally, the restricted marine terrace habitat along the Harmony Headlands coast south of Cambria (110 km NNW) should be searched; this area contains habitat similar to that occupied by B. wakei in the geographic vicinity of central coast members of the B. pacificus group.\n\nDespite its small range and lack of genetic diversity, B. wakei is inherently well protected, and so long as its habitat is not disturbed, it is likely to persist. Land ownership is divided between the United States Space Force, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Union Pacific Railroad Corporation, and the governmental entities are expected to be supportive of management practices that aid in conservation of this species. At present, most of the habitat is undeveloped dunes and none of the habitat is accessible to the general public. The dune flora is heavily impacted by non-native Iceplant, which was originally planted for erosion control but has become invasive and is thus a target of management. However, the Iceplant does not appear to negatively affect the salamanders, which may in fact benefit from the increased retention of surface moisture. Significantly, all entry to the area is strictly regulated and monitored because Vandenberg Space Force Base hosts a set of dispersed launch complexes used to send military and civilian satellites into polar orbits."
