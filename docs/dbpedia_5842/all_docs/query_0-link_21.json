SPACE VEHICLE DEPARTM ENT ...center for missile and space technology research and development at General Electric Progress in power for space Manned space nights, as well as other U.S. space projects, will require new, light-weight, long-life sources of electrical energy. Conventional batteries, now being used in missiles and satellites, are far too heavy for most future space applications. For example, during a year's operation, one thou- sand 15 amp/hr batteries, similar to the one shown above, would be required to equal the 41 watts which the thermionic converters in the photo can generate from the heat of the sun. These batteries would weigh 15,000 lbs — a complete thermionic system, including the converters developed in General Electric's Re- search Laboratory plus a collector and orientation equipment, only about 20 lbs. To provide such new, light-weight systems, engi- neers at General Electric's Missile and Space Vehicle Department are investigating a wide variety of prom- ising space power sources, utilizing the specialized capabilities of other Company research operations. For instance, under U.S. Air Force contract, G.E. is conducting extensive research in thermionics, and is developing an experimental thermionic system con- sisting of a solar collector, converters, and storage and control components. Intensive work in photo- voltaics includes the development of an advanced unit to provide more than 500 watts of continuous power for the Advent communications satellite. For the U.S. Army Signal Research and Develop- ment Laboratory, a regenerative fuel cell is under development, as are magnetohydrodynamic electrical converters for the Air Force Office of Scientific Re- search, WADD and BMD. In addition, MSVD is investigating nuclear thermionics and nuclear turbines.

The Countdown WASHINGTON Red Missile Photographed Extremely clear color photos of a Russian missile warhead which blazed into the Pacific July 7 are in the possession of the U.S. Countdown has learned the pictures — taken from U.S. aircraft — are so plain they have enabled intelligence experts to identify the type of ablating material used on the re-entry vehicle. Just what type has been classified by the Pentagon, along with the pictures. The missile was the second in a test series of two rockets fired by the Russians more than 8000 miles, presumably from a base near Murmansk. TBX is Killed The Air Force top command. Countdown is told, has flatly rejected Tactical Air Command proposals for developing the so-called TBX — a tactical-range ballistic missile. The weapon — -suggested as a 1000-mile-range missile for NATO — is considered unnecessary. This leaves TAC without a successor to the fighter-bomber in the late '60's. Norstad Leaving Soon? Talk persists that Gen. Lauris Norstad will step down fairly soon as commander of NATO and retire from the Air Force. The reason: there appears to be no job for him to go to. Gen. Thomas White, AF chief of staff, continues to be considered the top condidate to succeed Norstad. Atlas Base Increase A possible increase in the present 1 3 A tlas squad- rons is understood to be up for decision at the Secretary of Defense level. The Air Force wants two more 12- missile squadrons (dispersed in silos in a 12-by-l con- figuration) and is gaining some support for the idea. Picking Last Titan Site The site for the last of the planned 14 Titan squad- rons is all but set. The location is expected to be an- nounced by the AF within two months. Another Courier Try Coming Up Next attempt at launching the first Courier Signal Corps communications satellite may come within a few weeks. The first try failed Aug. 18 when the Thor- Able- Star booster blew up. On the Pad NASA's Atlas- Able Moon orbiter is on the pad for launching late this month, probably between Sept. 25 and Sept. 29 when the moon is at perigee . . . But the first flight of the polar-orbiting second-generation Nim- bus weather satellite now has slipped to the first half of 1962. It was to go in late '61. INDUSTRY Demand Drops for Engineers, Scientists An index based upon recruitment advertising shows that the demand for engineers and scientists throughout industry fell 13% in July. Deutsch & Shea Inc., which developed the index, says the drop-off continues a down- ward trend established in the second quarter of 1960 and is partly explained by a seasonal slack in recruiting. Army Spending $1.3 Billion on Rockets FY 1961 spending on missiles by the Army is now computed at $1.3 billion. The Army says 10% of this figure is being spent in-house and the remainder is going to industry. New Saturn Static Tests A new series of Saturn static tests using the proto- type SAT booster (modified as the result of tests this spring) will begin late this month or early next at Huntsville. Construction is continuing meantime on Saturn-I, which will be launched in its first flight test from the Cape next year.

Titan II will provide SAC with a missile capable of delivering the largest nuclear warhead in the nation's ICBM arsenal — possibly well over 10 mega- tons. The huge Martin ICBM, powered by fast-reaction storable fuel, will be SAC's main assault missile for obliter- ating the enemy's hardened targets. Titan I and, later, Titan II will pro- vide the Air Force with boosters cap- able of hurling Dyna-Soars and other space vehicles and satellites into orbits around the earth and into lunar space. They will be, in the language of their manufacturer, military \"space trucks\" of the future. • SAC crew shot — The Titan pro- gram's timetable now looks approxi- mately like this: -The first V series Titan is sched- uled to be launched from a test silo at Vandenberg AFB, Calif., within the next eight weeks. The \"V birds\" are similar to the instrumented all-but- operational J series Titans that have been launched from surface pads at Cape Canaveral. -The first technically operational Titan I is scheduled to be launched by a SAC crew 30 to 60 days later from the three-silo Titan training site at Vandenberg. The SAC crew later will be part of the cadre of Titan instruc- tors. -The first full nine-missile Titan I squadron is scheduled to be operational at the sites surrounding Lowry AFB, Colo., in the fall of next year. Six are slated to be operational by early 1963. -The first Titan II R&D missile is scheduled to be launched from Cape A TITAN I ICBM takes off from launch pad at AFMTC, Cape Canaveral. Canaveral in late 1961. The first of eight Titan II squadrons is scheduled to be operational by early 1963. The Air Force says the Titan pro- gram has recovered time lost last year and this year when R&D difficulties resulted in three blow-ups and other snags at Cape Canaveral. Moreover, Col. Albert J. Wetzel, Titan program director at the Air Force's Ballistic Missile Division, has said: \"There are no major basic tech- nical problems outstanding in the Titan I program.\" • To build 230 birds — The present official Air Force score on Titan R&D shots, including the successful launching of a \"J\" series bird from Cape Canav- eral Aug. 30, is: 14 successes, two par- tials, and five failures. Some 50 more R&D shots are scheduled — about evenly divided be- tween Titan Ts and Titan ITs. That would bring the total R&D launchings to about 70. The total Titan I and Titan II pro- duction run now planned is about 230, exclusive of Titan production for space work. The main R&D effort in the Titan program is rapidly swinging to Titan II. The division of the program into two distinct missiles is a sharp break with the step-by-step manner in which Atlas was developed. Because of the pressure on the Atlas program, improvements generally were introduced into the production line as quickly as possible. This was not done with Titan. Instead, a cut-off point was established for the introduc- tion of further modifications into Titan I, and these were collected for intro- duction into Titan II. The result is that Titan II is for all practical purposes a second-generation missile. Like the solid-propelled Minute- man, the Air Force's main second- generation ICBM, it will have a re- action time of one minute rather than the 15 minutes of Atlas and Titan I. Like Minuteman, it will have higher reliability because of its relative sim- plicity. Like Minuteman and the Atlas \"E\" series, it will have all-inertial guidance. Titan II will not have Minuteman's mobility or relatively low cost. But it will provide a means of delivering a far greater warhead. • $4.9 billior program — The first Atlas squadrons are manning each missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 I I TITAN'S FIRST STAGE is removed from the erector following a static firing at the Denver Division of The Martin Co. complex of three missiles with 16-man crews. The first Titan I squadrons are expected to man each complex of three missiles with 10-man crews. Each dispersed Titan II is expected to be manned by a two- or three-man crew. Each group of 10 dispersed and unmanned Minutemen is expected to be launched remotely by a two-man crew. Air Force figures on the cost of Titan bases vary, depending on whether development costs are included. Official Air Force estimates put the total cost of the Titan program at $4.9 billion — about $2.7 billion of which is to be spent by the end of FY 1961. On the basis of the presently planned 14 squadrons, the average cost per squad- ron of nine ready-to-launch missiles is $350 million. However, excluding the develop- ment costs, the Air Force puts the cost of each Titan I squadron at $166.5 million and each Titan II squadron at $138 million. Comparatively, the Air Force has estimated the cost of the early soft Atlas squadrons at $133 million and the improved, hardened Atlas squad- rons at $152 million. The Atlas figures also do not include development costs. One of the principal reasons for the decrease in the cost of the Titan II squadrons and the increase in the cost of the later Atlas squadrons is that one can be stripped of much support equip- ment while the other calls for more such equipment. • No strategic overlap — Minuteman is expected to be far cheaper than either Atlas or Titan. Estimates of Minuteman costs also vary considerably. However, many Air Force officials expect the total Minute- man program to cost not more than $2 billion, including development. This would pay for some 450 Minutemen scattered in silos across the country and some 150 Minutemen deployed on 50 missile trains. The first fixed Minuteman squad- rons are scheduled to become opera- tional in the second half of 1962; the first train squadrons in 1963. Thus the Minuteman and Titan II programs overlap — but not strategically. Only Titan II among the nation's big strategic missiles will have the striking power to knock out a hardened Planned Deployment of Titan ICBM's Base Location Number of Squadrons* Base Configuration Lowry AFB, Denver Ellsworth AFB, S.D.

For example, assume the target is a Soviet missile site hardened to with- stand pressures of 100 lbs. per square inch. Also assume the missile to be launched against it has a one-megaton warhead and a CEP of about two miles. In order to have a 90% chance of destroying the missile site, about 19 missiles would have to be launched against it. On the other hand, a 10-megaton ICBM with the same CEP greatly re- duces the number needed. About six missiles could do the job of the 19. • Super destruction — If accuracy improves and the CEP can be reduced to 1.5 miles, about 14 one-megaton missiles would be needed — still a large number. But two 10-megaton missiles could do the job — and more. The reason for this, of course, is the immensity of a 10-megaton blast. Such a warhead detonated on the sur- face could dig a crater 250 feet deep and a half-mile across. The fireball would be more than two miles wide. Both Atlas and Titan I are con- sidered to be capable of carrying multi- megaton warheads. But Titan II alone is considered to be in the super war- head class. Titan's space role is equally for- midable. At present, all Air Force plans for the use of Titan as a space booster are officially centered on the Dyna-Soar R&D program. However, the poten- tialities of both Titan I and Titan II for space work are considered to range far beyond Dyna-Soar. Martin officials have said that Titan I in its present form is capable of launching a 2.5-ton satellite into orbit around the earth, and that a modified Titan 1 would be capable of launching more than a five-ton satellite. • Booster for space ships — Dr. Albert C. Hall, Martin vice president for engineering, has said that Titan I without new development could launch a major space vehicle around the moon or place a small instrumented payload on the moon. Titan II is considered capable of launching manned spacecraft on mis- sions in lunar space. Initially, Air Force plans call for using only Titan I in the Dyna-Soar program. However, Titan II is ex- pected to be brought into the program as it advances toward development of operational military spacecraft. At the same time, some experts close to the Titan program foresee the use of Titans to launch military missile defense satellites and other types of military space stations. This is Titan — in war and space. 12 missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 As Red manned shot looms . . . Administration Acts to Speed Apollo by Jay Holmes Under pressure of a possible pre- election man-in-space shot by Russia, the Eisenhower Administration is prod- ding into life NASA's Project Apollo — the plan for a three-man space ship. Until last week what one congress- man called merely a \"designers dream,\" Apollo now has been raised to full study status, with plans to move it swiftly into the R&D stage. NASA has set up a timetable to complete study contracts by the middle of next May. It also plans to ask for R&D money in the FY 1962 budget. The timetable was given to industry at an Aug. 30. conference in Washing- ton by Robert R. Gilruth, director of NASA's Space Task Group. He set Sept. 6 as the deadline for expression of interest by prospective bidders, with a bidders conference to be held Sept. 12 at the Langley, Va., NASA Re- search Center. Proposals are due Oct. 10, with contracts (probably more than two) to be awarded Nov. 14. Tentative plans call for design, de- velopment and manufacture of the space ship, which would be boosted by a Saturn launching vehicle, in 1962-65. Active flight testing and mission flights are projected for 1965-70. Apollo will carry provisions and atmosphere for flights lasting several weeks. It is to come down on dry land, but must be designed for emergency landings on land or water, and able to sustain the crew for several days after landing. • Space station step — Command of the mission will be on board the space ship, with almost continuous contact with the earth. The crew will be ex- pected to fulfill a role comparable with that of a transcontinental jet airliner. Gilruth listed some of the major technological problems as: —Coping with or avoiding excessive solar radiation. —Safe crew recovery in case of space ship or booster malfunction. -Managing heat and other loads re- sulting from re-entry into the atmos- phere at speeds near 36,000 ft. /sec. Apollo's multimission capability, Gilruth said, will include a variety of scientific, technological and civilian services as an earth-orbiting vehicle. It will serve also as an intermediate step toward the establishment of manned space stations. When later versions of the Saturn vehicle are available, Apollo will be capable of manned reconnaissance flights to the vicinity of the moon. • Launch program — John W. Town- send Jr., assistant director of the God- dard center, gave details of satellites to be launched soon. The Juno II satellites — following Explorer VII, S-15 and S-45, both built by the Marshall Space Flight Center, will be launched in the next six to eight months. S-15 will study gamma rays and S-45 will be a multifrequency ionosphere beacon. Typical missions of the Goddard center, Townsend said, are the ionos- pheric topside sounders, S-48 and S-27. American industry is building S-48 while Canada is producing S-27 as part of the international cooperation pro- gram. Other Goddard satellites include S-30, an ionosphere direct measure- ments satellite; S-5 1 , the United King- dom satellite; S-16, the orbiting solar observatory; S-6, the atmospheric struc- tures satellite; P-14, the magnetometer probe; and P-26, the nuclear emulsion recovery vehicle (NERV). Robert J. Mackey, head of the Communications branch, reported that NASA is interested in active commu- nications satellites. Although NASA has no active program in this area, he said, Department of Defense activities are being monitored and studied to de- termine their implication to civilian communication studies. The Orbiting Geophysical Observa- tory, project manager Wilfred E. Scull said, will be used on two separate mis- sions. The Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (POGO) will be used on low-altitude polar orbits for study of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The Elliptical Geophysical Observatory (EGO) will follow highly elliptical, low-altitude orbits to study energetic particles and magnetic fields. missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 13 The MissilejSpace Week Reds May Have Dyna-Soar Type Vehicle Information obtained by U.S. scientists is reported to indicate that the Soviet \"space menagerie\" satellite may have been a winged Dyna-Soar type spacecraft. Until now it has been generally assumed that the Russians brought their two dogs back to earth from orbit Aug. 20 in a Mercury-type, capsule rather than a more advanced vehicle. Use of a winged spacecraft, if it could be controlled from the ground, would explain how the Russians were able to obtain a high degree of accu- racy in returning the life capsule. European military sources have reported previously that the Russians were working on the Dyna-Soar type T-4A, re- ported to weigh about 3000 lbs. The Soviets said the space menagerie weighed nearly 5 tons. NASA Wins Rover Control The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has won a five- month struggle with the Atomic Energy Commission for control of the proj- ect Rover nuclear rocket. Harold B. Finger, NASA chief of nuclear pro- pulsion, was chosen to head a joint NASA-AEC Nuclear Propulsion Office (NPO), set up at AEC headquarters in Germantown, Md. Milton Klein, assistant manager for technical operations in the AEC's Chicago Operations Office, will be Finger's deputy. The joint NASA-AEC announcement said the new offices will be staffed by employees drawn from both agencies. However, it will not include Col. Jack E. Armstrong, who has headed the AEC effort as deputy chief of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Office. Finger said he would have a staff of about 10 or possibly a few more, planned to set up operations in German- town late last week. He said he will be in charge of Project Rover, with authority to make decisions that formerly had to be made by agreement be- tween NASA and AEC. Echo's Reflectivity Holds Up So far, radio reflections from the Echo I balloon satellite have suffered no permanent ill effect from passing through the earth's shadow. A slight distortion of signals was observed on passes through the shadow during the first eight days beginning Aug. 23, but the quality returned when Echo re- entered sunlight. This would indicate that sufficient gas remains in the balloon to reinflate it each time it returns. By Aug. 30, Echo was spending 27 minutes of each 118-minute orbit in darkness. This is expected to increase to about 37 minutes by late November and then gradually decrease to zero in another three months. SBA 'Dictator' Bill Fought Congressional leaders are expected to block a rider which could give the Small Business Administrator virtual dictatorial power on DOD procurement contracts. The controversial measure, S3903, is an amendment to the Small Business Act proposed by Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) Legislative au- thorities, including House Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Vinson (D-Ga.), say it would hand the SBA Administrator power to make de- fense contracts conform to his judgement in small business subcontract set- asides. It would also enable him to obtain contractors' records from govern- ment procurement agencies — a \"search warrant\" as some have termed it. ICBM Base Catch-up Seen by February Industry officials in the Atlas base contraction program are optimistic about the new AF management set-up (M/R, Aug. 22, p. 8) to end slippage. Some are hopeful of getting back on the original schedule by January or February. Last week, he AF handed over to SAC the remaining three pads of the 564th Strategic Missile Squadron at Warren AFB, Cheyenne, Wyo. The 6-pad squadron is no*1 She nation's first fully operational combat ICBM unit. Linde's Liquid Hydrogen Plant on Regular Delivery Linde Co. reports distribution is now on a regular delivery schedule from its new liquid hydrogen plant in Torrance, Calif., which has a capacity of 13,000 lbs. a day. (See cover) The plant, which went on stream June 27, has shipped more than 300,000 lbs. of the supercold liquid to West Coast missile/ space development projects. It is the first privately owned and operated facility to supply liquid hydrogen on a commercial basis. Linde designed and constructed the plant after winning a contract in April, 1959, to sell up to 3,300,000 lbs. a year to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The NASA contract was awarded on the basis of an estimated maximum requirement of 10,000 lbs. a day. How- ever, this need will grow rapidly. Correction Several inaccuracies in an article titled \"FBM Accuracy Starts with SINS,\" published in Missiles and Rockets, July 25, 1960, pp. 8-9, have been corrected by Sperry Gyroscope Div. of Sperry-Rand Corp., subject of the story. The following comments plus state- ments extracted from a Sperry letter recently received by M/R will clarify the situation. The M/R story said, in effect, that 12 Sperry Mark III SINS had been delivered to the Navy and that starting in July 19 more would be delivered. This statement, based on a Sperry- Navy press release, is incorrect. Sperry's recent letter stated: \"The article attributes us with the delivery of 12 Mark III Inertial Navigation Systems. Sperry has delivered 12 — as a matter of fact, by now we have de- livered 16 — inertial systems, but tech- nically speaking these are Mark I, not Mark III systems. The major difference between the Mark I and the Mark III is a changeover from an analog to a digital system.\" The article further stated that Sper- ry's Mark HI SINS would be installed on the third and fourth Polaris subs. This was drawn from the same source and is also incorrect. Actually, Mark III SINS will be installed on the third and fourth subs of the second series. North American's Autonetics will provide its Mark II SINS for all five of the 598 Class submarines. Sperry's clarification said: \"Our new type SINS, the Mark III, is sched- uled to go aboard the four 608 Class submarines and, beginning with this series, Sperry has thus far delivered one.\" 14 missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 GE Noise Communications System Promises Top Security A new noise communications sys- tem being developed by General Elec- tric's Heavy Military Electronics De- partment may prove to be the most secure system ever designed. The company says signals trans- mitted by this system will be \"as dif- ficult to detect as a needle in a hay- stack.\" Called \"Phantom,\" the broad-band communication system receives and transmits intelligent noise or static. It is a radical departure from conven- tional narrow-band military communi- cations technique where each radio link is allocated a specific narrow bandwidth to avoid interference and to crowd as many channels as pos- sible into the electromagnetic spectrum. In broad-band communications the transmission bandwidth is many times larger than the intelligence bandwidth. For military communications, broad- band techniques provide three types of security: security against jamming be- cause of the tremendous amounts of power required to interfere with the transmitted signal; transmission security since the average power is spread over a wide bandwidth making the signal extremely difficult to detect; and mes- age security in that even if the signal is detected, it can be made very dif- ficult for an unauthorized listener to understand what is being transmitted. • Special bandwidths — The system uses a special form of double side-band transmission, resulting in bandwidths much greater than those in conven- tional practice. The prototype Phan- tom equipment is designed for use in long-haul, high frequency circuits where multipath conditions are encountered; however, it can be operated at fre- quencies much lower or higher than HF (3-30 mc) without any major de- sign changes. Its operation is not re- stricted to any particular frequency, GE says. Since the system's average power is spread over such a large bandwidth, conventional narrow-band circuits operating within the Phantom channel are unaware of its presence. In normal operation, the Phantom signal appears as random noise, or ordinary static, to conventional receiving equipment. The data rate of the system is pur- posely kept low in relation to trans- mission bandwidth. This provides ex- cellent jamming immunity and allows Phantom to be operated in heavily congested portions of the r4 spectrum. The system can tolerate the inter- ference caused by other signals, and at the same time these other signals provide \"cover,\" which enhances the transmission security of Phantom. In order to receive the Phantom transmissions, an authorized receiving station must not only have the proper equipment, but also knowledge of the operating frequency and the specific signalling wave form being used. Present Phantom equipment has many hundreds of thousands of signalling waveform selections available which can be changed as often as necessary. Two Phantom systems operating in the same frequency band — but using different waveform selections — will appear es- sentially as random noise to one an- other. Conventional radio transmissions falling in the Phantom channel also appear as random noise to the system. Comparable to a combination lock, Phantom is designed so that it can still perform its military communications function even though an enemy knows its frequencies and how it operates. • Over 2000 miles — According to GE, feasibility of the system was con- clusively proved during recent field tests when signals were beamed successfully more than 2000 miles. General Electric engineers working at the receiving site during the field tests with conventional equipment — THIS 100-ft. antenna at General Electric' s Heavy Military Electronics Department, Syracuse, N.Y., was used to receive signals during recent field tests of the Phantom broad-band communication sys- tem. even though they knew what to look for — were unable to locate with any certainty the signal being received by the Phantom equipment nearby. Many different frequencies in the HF band were used during the tests. High frequency was selected for the field tests because of the severe multipath and interference conditions normally encountered in this frequency range. Besides point-to-point communi- cations, GE foresees application of Phantom in aircraft and satellite com- munciation systems. Thermionic Converters Near Market Practical thermionic converters are now being produced in quantity by General Electric and are expected to be on the market next month. Present output of the pilot-line operation in Schenectady, N.Y., is 60 per week. According to the company, capacity could be stepped up to 100 per week. These first devices — type Z-5386 vacuum thermionic converters — pro- duce one watt with a minimum thermal efficiency of 2.5%. Each is the size of a silver dollar and weighs three ounces. Cathode temperature is approximately 1100°C. GE is also pushing research and development in vapor thermionic con- version. Plans are to produce and market the vapor type at a later date. The company believes that outputs up to 20 watts per square centimeter of cathode surface and thermal efficiencies as high as 30% can be attained. Thermionic converters transform heat from any source — the sun, nuclear reactors, isotopes, chemical and fossil fuels — directly into electricity. They can operate on waste heat from other power-generating methods. Such devices are particularly at- tractive as power sources for space applications. Commercial possibilities exist for remote areas on earth. ONE-WATT vacuum thermionic converter produced by General Electric's Power Tube Department will be commercially available next month. The close-spaced sealed-off unit has minimum power density of 0.2 watts per square centimeter of cathode surface and thermal efficiency of at least 2.5%. missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 At record WESCON show . . . Packard Reminds Industry of Its Duty Los Angeles — Hewlett-Packard president David Packard gave his fel- low electronic industry managers a talking-to on responsibility last week — spearing at those who would like to pull out of defense work. Opening up the sixth annual Western Electronic Show and Conven- tion, Packard said the ever-mounting dependence upon electronics by the military had thrust the burden of leadership upon the industry. \"We are the heart and nerve center of America's defense effort,\" he said, adding point- edly: \"The hope . . . that our industry can and should become less dependent on military work is sheer wishful thinking that borders on irresponsi- bility. \"It will be the continuing task of the electronics industry to add to our military strength for many years ...\" WESCON, sponsored by the West- ern Electronic Manufacturers Associa- tion and the Seventh Region of the Institute of Radio Engineers, this year drew a record attendance of 40,000 to TECHNICAL Los Angeles — A new approach to semiconductor micro-component pack- aging was reported at WESCON by Thomas C. Hall of Pacific Semiconduc- tors, Inc. This was one of a number of ad- vances in the rapidly-expanding tech- nology of microelectronics described at the meeting's technical sessions. The Pacific Semiconductor tech- nique employs surface passivation, which Hall defined to mean the genera- tion on the semiconductor surface of a chemical film layer which does not adversely affect electronic properties of the surface leading to good device char- acteristics. In addition, it provides electrical stability of the surface as well as isola- tion from electrical and chemical influ- ences which might lead to deteriora- tion. Hall said that in addition to im- proved performance and reliability, sig- nificant and critical advantages in mi- cro-miniaturization and fabrication are achieved. He said an order of stability exceed- ing that obtainable with the best her- metic packaging has been obtained by the Los Angeles Sports Arena. The show was permeated with serious tech- nical presentations, rather than head- line-hunting predictions that usually crop up in meetings of this type. On this note, Dr. William V, Wright said microelectronics pioneered in the U.S. has done much to keep this country abreast of Russia in space. • 'We launch brains' — Dr. Wright, who is manager of Electro-Optical Sys- tems Inc.'s Solid State Division, re- marked that \"Russia launches weight, we launch brains.\" He said the United States certainly leads Russia in col- lecting space data. As an example of microelectronic technology. Dr. Wright demonstrated a silicon disc device that reports the position of a spot of light focused on the disc's surface. He said the radia- tion tracking transducer could be ap- plied to space navigation systems, satel- lite tracking, antenna orientation and advanced communications systems. With some modification, the same unit can detect infrared radiation. Much comment was stimulated by generating oxidic layers of altered com- position and structure on silicon sur- faces. These films are attached by strong covalent chemical bonds to the crystal substrate. Substitution of various organic groupings into the structure of the oxide film renders the film water re- pellent. Hall listed these advantages of sur- face passivation packaging over her- metic packaging of semiconductor de- vices: improvement in reliability, reduc- tion in size, superior performance, sim- plification of manufacture and exten- sion of state-of-the-art limits. • Layer deposits — D. J. Shombert and J. Allegretti of Merck, Sharp & Dohme told of a method of depositing layers of single crystal silicon on single crystal silicon substrates. This alterna- tion of layers of controlled resistivity and type was said to permit the intro- duction of many functional elements directly into a structure. They said ele- ments deposited experimentally in five and seven layer structures include ca- pacitors, resistors, rectifiers, voltage lim- iting Zener diodes, pnpn transistors and solar cells. A number of speakers dealt with micromodules, in which interest has a paper presented by Bernard Bald- ridge of General Electric's Light Military Electronics Department. He pointed out the danger of pollution of electronic environments by inadequate systems planning. Denigrating the current emphasis on experts and specialists, Baldridge cited the need for more \"generalists\" who understand overall system prob- lems, causes and effects. He said the experts must understand that the inter- actions of our society preclude work- ing in anything like a vacuum. The ultimate systems interaction, he said, might be a runaway satellite transmitter powered with solar batteries which would require intercept and de- struction to permit the frequency to be used again. Dr. Eberhardt Rechtin, telecom- munication division chief at Cal Tech's Jet Propulsion Laboratories, received the 1960 Achievement Award of the IRE Seventh Region. Dr. Rechtin was cited for \"research in communications systems and leadership in setting up deep space communications stations.\" been increasing during the year. Radio Corporation of America, in fact, of- fered what it termed a Basic Micro- module Laboratory specifically in- tended for electronic equipment manu- facturers interested in the conversion of existing systems to the micromodule form. It was described by D. T. Levy. He said the simple laboratory per- mits equipment design engineers to design, assemble, and evaluate experi- mental micromodules in a minimum of time. Taking up 10 ft. of lab bench, the equipment includes not only an air- abrader and process control unit, a stereoscopic microscope, solder-coating equipment and a curing oven, but also all necessary small tools, chemicals, jigs and fixtures. It includes a small but adaptable stock of microelements and even an instruction booklet describing the principles of micromodule construc- tion and the methods by which com- plete electronic circuits may be divided into individual micromodule units. The laboratory is intended for de- sign engineers as a research tool for building and testing experimental mi- cromodules, not as a production unit, RCA emphasized. Robert G. Rockwell, Varian Asso- ciates, reported on development of a new klystron tube weighting eight oz. 16 missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 Defense EQUIPMENT Los Angeles — Outstanding missile and space electronic equipment on dis- play at the recent WESCON show ranged from a large high-performance tape recorder which cost $2-million to develop to an infrared detection device smaller than a lipstick. The tape recorder was an all solid- state advanced recorder selected by Boeing Airplane Co. for testing of the Minuteman missile. It is being used as the primary recorder/ reproducer of a telemetry ground station. The FR-600 recorder developed by Ampex Corp., Redwood City, Calif., also took one of five outstanding de- sign awards at the show. The Ampex recorder is the primary unit of a test system to record telemetry signals dur- ing pre-flight, launch and flight. First production models of the re- corder were shipped recently to the Boeing Seattle plant. Seventeen of them will be used in the test program. A normal two and one-half year product development period was compressed into 18 months to meet requirements of the Minuteman program, Ampex says. First nine recorders shipped to Boe- ing have a frequency range of 300 cycles to 250 kilocycles per second with a 60 ips tape speed. Although this is more than double the bandwidth pre- viously available, Ampex reports that circuitry and magnetic head improve- ments now are being engineered to ex- tend the bandwidth of the remaining eight Boeing recorders to provide for recording up to 500 kilocycles at a tape speed of 120 ips. • Early application — Boeing's use of the recorders was one of the first major applications of serially recorded data for missile programing. At a tape speed of 60 ips, information is trans- mitted to the recorder at up to 350,000 bits per second. Boeing selected a 7-track configura- tion for the Minuteman testing, al- though the recorder i s capable of handling up to 14 tracks on inch-wide tape. The tape-recorded data in the telemetry system is the primary in- formation source to a tape format con- verter. The information is pulse-code- modulated and frequency-modulated telemetry data. Ampex reports that the output of frequency-modulated re- ceivers, containing serial coded PCM missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 information, is redundantly recorded for reliability on three separate tracks. Remaining four tracks are used for recording conventional FM/FM telem- etry signals and other information. Some of the recorders sent to Seattle will be re-shipped to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and Patrick AFB, Fla., after checkout by Boeing system engineers. Ampex says an all solid-state modu- lar electronic system was chosen to assure minimum down-time and high reliability. Modular packaging permits quick replacement of individual elec- tronic units and the solid-state devices do not require the 30-min. warmup time associated with vacuum tubes. The recorder is applicable to other advanced missile systems. The lipstick size infrared detector was developed by Raytheon Co.'s Microwave & Power Tube Infrared De- vices Laboratory at Waltham, Mass. The device is for use in detection units pinpointing missiles, launching pads or rocket motor test areas. The passive beamless unit is said by Raytheon to be the smallest known metal-encased unit in the field of infra- red detectors, less than two inches long. The company says the new detec- tor's long-range operation, its small size and metal casing make it particularly applicable to missiles. • Some highlights — In other devel- opments at the WESCON show: Mincom Division of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. intro- duced a new video band recorder/ re- producer which it said could simulate an actual missile flight by feeding original data back to the receiver in the missile. General Electric's Receiving Tube Department displayed application of ceramic tubes as part of an ultra-high frequency transmitter built by Space Technology Laboratories. The ceramic tubes in Resdel Engineering Corp.'s identified by GE as a 7486 radio-fre- quency oscillator triode and a 7296 VHF-UHF power amplifier. The STL communication unit was designed to transmit two watts of CW power from a space vehicle 10-million miles from earth. GE also showed use of ceramic tubes, currently in production, were \"UDOP\" UHF Doppler velocity, ac- celeration and position systems, which have successfully flown in all Pershing missiles, as well as ceramic tubes in a miss-distance indicator built by the Ralph M. Parsons Co. Leach Corp. displayed a 24-oz. tape recorder carried by Air Force Capt. Joseph Kittinger to record medi- cal data on 14 separate magnetic chan- nels during his 19% -mile leap from a balloon. It was learned that Leach has under development one half as small, Corning Electronic Components, Corning, N.Y., announced plans to market one-watt and half-watt high quality film resistors in direct competi- tion with composition resistors. The one-watt resistors will sell for 6.1 cents, the half-watt for 5.9 cents. Collins Radio Co.'s Western Divi- sion, Burbank, Calif., unveiled me- chanical filters with ferrite transducers for the first time. Improved perform- ance was said to result from replacing of former nickel-alloy material with the ferrite transducers. 17 BMD beefs up . . . Air Force Satellite Program Gets New Boss Greer will bring sharp eye fo job of expediting Midas, Samos and Discoverer by Clarke Newlon The man the Air Force has selected to boost USAF satellites higher — and to do it faster — is a tall, lean West Pointer, class of '39, a command jet pilot and an electronics engineer who catches errors in computers. He is Brig. Gen. Robert E. Greer, who will assume his duties as Vice Commander of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division for Satellite Programs on October I. Actually, he is already spending more time in the BMD offices at Englewood, Calif., than his own at the Pentagon where he was Assistant Chief of Staff for Guided Missiles. General Greer's assignment as satel- lite boss and expediter comes coinci- dentally with word from California that BMD will hike its personnel from a present 2000 to nearly 7000 in the next two years and to 12,000 in the coming 4-5 year period. Eventual payroll: $100 million annually. In Bob Greer's Pentagon office he kept an old-fashioned school- room blackboard hanging by his desk. In the course of a normal conversation he would cover it with mathematical equa- tions, sometimes to satisfy his own thinking, sometimes to clarify a point. The mistake the computer had made was not really the computer's fault. It had been fed one bit of wrong data. Neither the computer nor Greer knew this but only Greer knew the answer was wrong. One of the general's main jobs at BMD will be to push the Midas and Samos programs, but it will be more to keep a critical eye on the entire Air Force satellite schedule, as his job title indicates. Under his sharp scrutiny will come, in time, the Discoverer satellites, one of the next two of which will probably put a monkey in space and, hopefully, recover it. General Greer was not, he says, too impressed with the latest feat of the Russians in putting their menagerie in orbit and recovering it. But the reason he was not impressed was, he said, that it had been apparent for some time they had such a capability. • On Soviet ability — Will the Rus- sians put a man in space? \"No doubt of it,\" he said. \"Not the slightest doubt.\" \"When?\" \"Within the next six months,\" \"he thought and then qualified that. \"Ivfake it the near future.\" \"Like October?\" \"It's possible,\" he said. \"Mostly it depends on their program, on how flexible it is. They may have pro- gramed more than one shot carrying animals and if their program is rigid, they'll do that again. If they are flexible they could wipe out animal shots and go right on to man. Or, they may have planned only one animal shot. \"Actually,\" he continued, \"now that they have proved they can land a cap- sule where they want it and land it safely, the feat of putting up a manned vehicle is simpler than an unmanned. \"In the unmanned operation you have to depend on servo-mechanisms and pre-programing. They have definite limitations. A man in the satellite, though, makes things much simpler. He can think and react. He can look up or down and figure out his position for stabilization. He can focus a camera, fire a retro rocket, handle controls and guidance. He's about the best servo- mechanism ever built.\" General Greer felt that some of the long Pacific Ocean shots made by the Russians were tests for the menagerie shot and for the manned capsule which will follow it. The Soviet feat of landing their capsule with an accuracy of six or seven miles he thought showed high technical skill and high confidence in that skill. He also explained how he thought they had accomplished such precision. The Russians, he said, have suffi- cient thrust in their booster to carry aloft an inertial guidance system, re- gardless of weight. They can guide their satellite into exactly the orbit they wish. Knowing the exact orbit they can also predict where it will be at any given second, kick it out of orbit with a retro-rocket and land it with great accuracy. Because our Thor-Agena has not sufficient thrust to lift the Thor's in- ertial guidance system as well as a pay- load, guidance is forfeited. The Dis- coverer satellites are guided into orbit by an auto pilot which is preprogramed and which cannot correct for wind drift or gyro error, for instance. Hence, without precise knowledge of the orbit the U.S. satellite recoveries have to account for a much greater margin of error — a margin figured in 200 or more miles instead of 10. This is also the reason the U.S. recoveries are scheduled over water instead of land — to prevent the possi- bility of a satellite landing on, say, Los Angeles. 18 missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 M/R's growing advertiser acceptance 90 NEW ADVERTISERS since January 1, 1960 Ace Drill Bushing Co.

Cosmic Deluge Upsets Theory MIT physicists believe they have recorded the heavi- est cosmic-ray shower ever observed. Because of its unusually high energy level, scientists believe that the source was beyond our galaxy (which conflicts with present theory of cosmic ray origin).

The primary cosmic ray causing the shower had energy from 20 to 40 billion bev, scientists said after a three-month analysis. Thermionic Converters Available Soon One-watt vacuum thermionic converters are now in pilot production at General Electric's Schenectady plant. The 3-oz., 2-in.-dia. miniature power sources will be commercially available by October, says GE. For the near future, the company is developing vacuum-type converters with 5-w output and cesium vapor-type con- verters with up to 20w/sq.cm. output. Until now, all of GE's production has been for its own missile/ space use. No Shadow Operation For Echo The Echo I radio beacon is now operating solely on its solar cells. The beacon goes off each time the balloon satellite moves into the earth's shadow. The balloon remained almost fully inflated during the first few shadow crossings. Self-Cooled Accelerometer Developed An integral self-cooling system for accelerometers, patented by Dr. Leslie Gulton, will allow the sensing units to endure temperatures of more than 2000°F. An expansible gas under ultrahigh pressure — released at pre- specified temperatures into an expansion chamber sur- rounding the accelerometer — absorbs heat and cools the wall enclosing the instrument. Thermoelectric Units Both Heat and Cool Temperatures of crystal filters in an IR detection sys- tem were controlled within 0.5 °C by Westinghouse ther- moelectric cooling devices in a recent Aerobee-Hi rocket shot. The NRL probe was reported to be the first use of such devices for both heating and cooling. GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT Titan Base Wiring Prefabricated Wiring and cabling for an entire Titan base is pre- fabricated in the factory in a new technique developed by Martin. The prefab harness — widely used in mass- production of electronic chassis but never before ex- tended to such heavy cable and long runs — is said to be quicker, cheaper and more reliable than conventional methods. Contract Awarded for HIPAR Radars General Electric HMED has been awarded a $14.5- million production contract for high-power acquisition radars (HIPAR) for Army's improved Nike-Hercules.

Pluto is slated to be the propulsion source for Slam, a low-level supersonic weapon. nissiles and rockets, September 5, I960 23 TITAN SPECIAL REPORT tures will apply to both, and fabrication techniques will be equally applicable. Testing, to be conducted here with the exception of actual flight, will all be handled in Titan I facilities. Test stands D-l and D-2 are now being ret- rofitted for the 108-ft.-long Titan II. Static tests of the complete missile are expected here next year. Tests of components and subsys- tems are already being carried out and Aerojet-General Corp., the propulsion system contractor, has been testing the storable engines for several months. • Accent on simplicity — The prime interest in the Titan II system is relia- bility, not optimum theoretical per- formance. As one program executive remarked: \"The first engineer who sug- gests a design modification in the inter- ests of sophistication will promptly be shot.\" Range of the storable-fuel missile will be in excess of 12,000 miles, accord- ing to Martin. This figure is based on a payload weight equal to that of Titan I. Despite its heavier payload, Titan II is expected to surpass the range capability of any other ICBM system. Some structural \"beefing up\" will] be provided for two major reasons: the requirement for an in-silo launch, and the denser nature of the storable fuels. The former beef-up results from studies missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 Titan II Will Get Mon Payload ir DENVER — Titan II will be devel- oped with tooling, testing and elec- tronic facilities based on those designed for Titan I, but with greatly improved performance, reliability and reaction time, Martin-Denver says. The company expects to phase its facilities here from the original version of the two-stage ICBM to the follow-on version with a minimum of effort and complication. The biggest single change from a tooling point of view is the expanded diameter of the second stage from eight to ten feet, equalling the first stage size. Materials used in the two systems will be identical in most cases, jigs and fix- 24 lange and Production Line Modification by Frank G. McGuire First stage of Titan I is shown on production line at The Martin Co.'s Denver Division. of acoustical and vibration factors pres- ent in an in-silo launch. The Aerojet engines will provide the Titan II with slightly greater thrust than its predecessor, through a series of modifications to the powerplant. The engine will have a space-start capabil- ity, making it useful as an upper stage for future extremely large boosters. Most of the additional ten feet in length will be accounted for by tankage in the first stage. A slight increase in second-stage length will be used for the payload compartment, making possible a larger warhead. The second-stage tankage increase will result from the enlarged diameter, not lengthening. • New sequence — Additional changes are planned in subsystems, such as the stage separation sequence. In the Titan II sequence, the second stage will ignite while still connected to the first stage, and the engine blast will in- sure separation. An interstage connec- tor will have a number of slots located about its periphery to allow initial escape of engine gas and flame until separation is positively achieved. Ve- locity at this point is about 6000 to 7000 feet per second. The Titan I sys- tem called for a delay in second-stage ignition until the two stages were about 15 ft. apart. The 15-ft. distance was supplied by two solid rockets mounted on the sec- ond stage. These performed the dual function of aiding separation while sup- plying a positive force to feed fuel to the second-stage turbopumps. Without this force, Martin said, there was danger of the liquid forming globules and floating around the tank in weight- less condition. Accuracy of the engine cutoff is believed to be such that verniers will not be required for final velocity and course correction. Titan II will, if this is true, have an extremely clean con- figuration and simple operation se- quence. Mass ratio of Titan II is believed to be roughly equal to that of its prede- cessor, about .94. (The German V-2 had a mass ratio of about .57). An all-inertial guidance system by AC Spark Plug will replace the present radio-inertial system supplied by Bell Telephone Laboratories. The re-entry vehicle will be made by General Electric. The scheduled launch in October of a Titan I from its silo at Vandenberg AFB is designed to test certain Titan II design features. These will consist most- ly of structural changes, including the modification of chemical milling areas to reflect the altered requirements of strength vs. weight. • Production — Martin plans no pro- duction lots for the Titan II, primarily because it is being designed from the start as an operational configuration and will undergo as few engineering changes as possible, consistent with sys- tem reliability and simplicity. The entire Titan I vehicle is esti- mated by Martin to have \"fewer parts than the nose section alone of some modern combat aircraft.\" Spares will be selected from the approximately 23,- 000 line items in the missile and kept on hand at maintenance and overhaul depots, such as the San Bernardino Air Materiel Area. Parts in Titan II will probably number significantly less. The company estimates that chemi- cal milling applied to the fabrication process has reduced weight of the ve- hicle by 900 to 1000 lbs. Although the exact areas to be chemically milled on Titan II are not yet determined, a com- parable weight saving is expected. Basic airframe material on Titan is 2014 aluminum alloy, supplied by Dow Metal Products Co., Harvey Aluminum, and Alcoa. Martin devised special weld- ing methods for the alloy, due to its undesirable characteristics. The excel- lent strength-to-weight ratio of 2014 led to its choice. • Welding — Manufacturing develop- ment engineers at Martin established a process using an inert-gas shielded tungsten arc with an aluminum filler wire. It was found that this also kept the heat-affected zone in the parent material to a minimum. Tensile strength in the welded joint is maintained through use of an alumi- num backup chill bar which dissipates heat. A steel plate located under the butt joint prevents the parent material from adhering to the fixture during welding. The overall welding technique is roughly similar to that used in welding magnesium-thorium alloys on the Po- laris FBM. • Panel treatment — Extruded panels are received from suppliers in a semi- hardened condition, and are subse- quently machined in order to maintain a tolerance of 0.050 in. thickness. One supplier of skin panels, Dow, extrudes them in a 13,200-ton press at its Madison, 111., plant, one of the three largest such presses in the world. Panels are extruded in \"U\" and \"V\" shapes to missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 26 FIRST STAGE of a Titan is lowered into place in a cell of the Vertical Test Fix- ture. Here, for first time in production sequence, both stages are mated. achieve a required 34-inch width. They are then straightened and flattened to close tolerances. Flatness tolerance in bend areas on the stiffener side is 0.030-in. -convex, and the side 0.030- in.-convex-or-concave. Panels are extruded in 37. -ft. lengths — the \"U\" shape being used for panels with three stiffeners, and the \"V\" shape for panels with two stiffeners. After the flattening process in Dow's contour- correction equipment, panels are sent to the stretcher for desired percentage of stretching. Machining at Martin-Denver is done on the flush surface of the panel, using a tape-controlled Giddings and Lewis Mill, then on the reverse side between the \"T\" shaped stringers. Following machining, panels are mounted on a Kirksite contour block, placed in another stretch press and formed to the proper radius. The Huf- ford press used in this operation is re- putedly the first of its size and capacity to be used in the industry. It has a 1400-ton capacity and measures 43 ft. long, 1 1 ft. wide and 20 ft. high. Chemical Milling follows the stretch press operation. Neoprene base ma- terials prevent the etching solution from attacking portions of the panel to be kept constant. The neoprene is scribed, after being cured, and by peel- ing off selected sections Martin has in effect a template which determines where the alloy will be affected by the etchant. • Assembly — The Titan is com- posed of twelve of these panels, which are assembled in a locating fixture in groups of three and automatically welded together longitudinally. The lo- cating fixture, custom-built for the Titan program, consists of a bed assembly, locating and clamping paddles, a weld- ing bridge and the automatic welding head with its control system. The \"T\"-shaped stringers running the length of each panel are used by the pneumatic clamps to hold the panel in position on the weld fixture. Three panels at a time are welded into a quar- ter-barrel assembly. After four of these quarter-barrel assemblies are complete, they are clamped to the locater paddles and welded together to form the complete barrel which constitutes the Titan air- frame. Upon completion of this opera- tion two electrical cutting heads trim How Titans Height Diameter (1st stage) Diameter (2nd stage) Weight Range Guidance Propellant Thrust (1st stage) Thrust (2nd stage) Operational Compare Titan I 98 ft. 10 ft. 8 ft. 220,000 lbs. 7000 stat. mi. radio inertial liquid 300,000 lbs. 80,000 lbs. 1961 Titan II approx. 110 ft. 10 ft. 10 ft. approx. 250,000 10,000 stat. mi. all inertial storable liquid 400,000 lbs. 100,000 lbs. 1963 the ends of the barrel. Domes to form the ends of tanks for the vehicle were fabricated in \"orange peel\" fashion until the devel- 1 opment of equipment which could fab- | ricate them of fewer segments, includ- ing a specially-formed dome cap with formed-in outlets for liquid flow. After completion of welding on the dome itself, two of the finished domes are placed in chucks on a welding fixture, while a completed barrel as- sembly is placed between them on a rolling base. All fixture segments are synchronized so that they roll together, resulting in butt joints being formed by component edges. The weld is per- formed by a fixed welding head, which remains in one position while the work- piece rotates before it, thus accom- plishing the job in one pass. Both visual inspection and the use of a dye penetrant are utilized to verify the integrity of welds. All welds of tank panels, domes and finished bar- rels are checked by X-ray techniques as well. Following X-ray tests, tanks are subjected to hydrostatic operations, which accomplish testing, cleaning and finishing of metal surfaces. Hot air and nitrogen are then introduced into the tank, one after the other, to dry it and reduce the dew point to 10°F. Finished and tested tanks are then sealed. Tankage assemblies, engine fair- ings, inter-tank structures and transi- tion assemblies are then positioned in fixtures for joining. • Testing — Because of the extreme reliability required of Titan, Martin- Denver has adopted a building-block approach to testing. Components, then subsystems, then complete sys- tems are checked out thoroughly. Electrical components and harnesses are bench-tested, and relays are sub- jected to simulated missile electrical loads. Hydraulic and pneumatic subsys- tems are tested against specifications in facilities with up to 15,000 psi hydrostatic pressure available. Upon completion of the vehicle, the missile is taken to the vertical test facility, a 13-story structure with iso- lated test cells. This vertical test facility (VTF) has provisions for completely isolat- ing the missile from outside inter-i ference while electrical and electronic checks are performed in one of thej nine test cells. \"Marriage system checks\" are per- formed on guidance, control systems, telemetry, pressure lines, and correct sequencing. A complete countdown is carried out, and electronic simulation of engine firing and flight sequences is included. 26 missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 TITAN SPECIAL REPORT Parts Reduced in Titan II Engine Switch to storable fuels eliminates ignition system and provides space start capability for big vehicles Sacramento, Calif. — The Titan II engine is expected to have only about half as many control components and moving parts as the original Titan design, according to Aerojet-General Corp., associate contractor for pro- pulsion on both versions of the two- stage ICBM. The company is relying on sim- plicity to provide high reliability in the storable-fuel version of the Martin missile. The estimate of parts reduction includes ground support equipment and reflects elimination of the helium and nitrogen start systems, the ignition systems, and many valves and regu- lators. Instead of the start systems, solid-propellant gas generators will be used to spin the turbines at launch to feed propellants to the engine. Adoption of storable hypergolic fuels has enabled the company to elim- inate the ignition system. Aerojet has dubbed the storable fuel mixture for Titan II \"Aerozine- 50\"; it is a composition of 50% hydra- zine and 50% unsymmetrical dimeth- ylhydrazine. Aerozine-50 will team up with nitrogen tetroxide to power the two-stage ICBM with more than 400,000 lbs. thrust in the double- barrelled first-stage engine. As it did with Titan I, Aerojet will follow the now-in-vogue concur- rency concept — simultaneous develop- ment and production of engines. The phase-in of the Titan II on the heels of the Titan I model is expected to be relatively smooth. • Eligible for space — An additional feature of the first-stage engine which will have no direct application to the weapon system, but will make Titan II a front-runner for any upper- stage job in huge space systems, is the capability of a space start. The hyper- golic nature of the storable propellants greatly simplified the problem of start- ing the big engines in space, and the already proven second Titan stage will be a natural companion for third-stage [honors atop any new super-booster. Aside from the great reduction in parts, modifications of the engine for missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 FIRST-STAGE ENGINES for Titan I at the Sacramento Liquid Rocket Plant of the Aerojet-General Corp. Titan II first stage will have similar specifications. its Titan II role will include changing the seals on fuel and oxidizer lines and valves, altering mixing ratios, and re-working injector plates. Aerojet has been testing a storable- fuel version of the Titan engine for several months. The particular storable fuel mix- ture chosen for Titan II has the fol- lowing general characteristics: weight mixture ratio of 2.00; volume mixture ratio of 1.24; combustion temperature about 5590° F; characteristic velocity about 5725 fps; and specific impulse approximately 288. These are calculated at 1000 psia, shifting equilibrium and optimum expansion at sea level. Aerojet is reported to have made some increases in specific impulse per- formance and other properties. Specific impulse figures for the Titan II pro- pellants, for example, have been esti- mated to be equal to the LOX-RP 1 combination of Titan I. • Similar specs — First-stage engine dimensions and specifications for the Titan II will undoubtedly follow the Titan I design closely. Designated the LR-87-AJ-3, Titan l's booster has an overall length of 10 ft., a maximum width of 9 ft., and a gross weight of 3700 lbs. It is a bell-nozzle configura- tion using regenerative cooling and having an area ratio of 8:1. Fabricated of stainless steel, the double barrels use common missile tankage for propellant supply. About 250 stainless steel tubes are welded side by side to conform to the properly shaped mandrel and shape the thrust chamber. Burning time is 120 seconds. The second stage generates about 80,000 lbs. thrust at altitude (equiv- alent to about 60,000 at sea level) and is billed as the free world's largest space-started rocket engine. It con- sumes about 25 tons of propellant dur- ing its 150-second burning time. Designated LR-91-AJ-3, the en- gine's bell nozzle thrust chamber is partly regeneratively cooled and has an area ratio of 25:1. Entire engine unit is about seven feet long, four feet wide and weighs about 1300 lbs. When modified for the Titan II vehicle, the first and second stage en- gines will be re-designated LR-87-AJ-5 and LR-91-AJ-5, respectively. 27 TITAN SPECIAL REPORT Safety Stressed in A-G's Storabh by Dan AA. Tenenbaum Manager, Test Divisions Aerojet-General Corp. Sacramento, Calif. — Development of engines for Titan II has required some major changes in test facilities at Aerojet-General's Liquid Rocket plant here to accommodate the stor- able propellants nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozine-50 (a 50-50 mixture of UDMH and hydrazine). Important modifications include: conversion of engine test stands and a new central storage and pumping facility for propellants; a new remotely controlled continuous mix station for Aerozine-50, so that the constituents can be mixed as they are unloaded from tank cars; a 5'/2-mile railroad spur for direct transportation of pro- pellants to the storage area, and a number of new safety devices to pro- tect personnel from the possible hazard of toxic vapors. The present facilities, built for de- veloping Titan I engines, were designed to accommodate liquid oxygen and RP-1, a hydrocarbon type fuel. Interim modifications to existing facilities are being utilized for Titan II engine tests until construction and conversion of the new facilities is completed late this year. In the new design and modification work, the most important considera- tions were the toxic nature of the stor- able propellants and, hence, the need for extra safety measures for the per- sonnel who handle them. Aerojet's ex- tensive experience with storable-type propellants, posing the same or similar handling problems, has helped greatly in the present rapid changeover. Our experience with storables includes de- veloping rocket engines for assisted take-off of the Air Force B-29, B-45, B-47, and F-84 aircraft; inflight thrust augmentation on the Air Force F-86 airplane; and propulsion systems for the Aerobee, Bomarc, Nike, Vanguard About the Author THRUST Chamt test Stand C-l-2-3 ci version depicted artist's drawing. second stage and Able second stage. Work on Titan engine testing is an around-the-clock operation for 1150 members of the Liquid Rocket Plant Test Division. • Test area — The liquid rocket test area is composed of 24 high-thrust test stands ranging in thrust capability from 150,000 to 1,500,000 lbs. The high-thrust test stands are constructed in groups of three on a common con- crete structure referred to as a com- plex. The basic test stand structure consists of a reinforced concrete base with steel superstructure to accom- modate the propellant run tanks and rocket engine thrust mounts. The 24 test stands are separated into four test zones. Each zone con- sists of two complexes, operated from a reinforced concrete, revetment-pro- tected control building housing two control rooms, one for each complex. Each test zone also contains a test shop D. M. (Dan) Tenenbaum directs testing operations for both the Liquid Rocket Plant and the Solid Rocket Plant of Aerojet-General Corporation near Sacramento. An Aerojet employee since 1948, he was responsible for testing of numerous rockets for aircraft programs. He now directs rocket engine testing for the Titan, Polaris, Minuteman and other Aerojet projects. COMPLEX of th. test stands on each s of control room um bunker in center. for the maintenance of test stand equipment and instrumentation for checkout of rocket engines and com- ponents prior to test. Each zone has its own gaseous nitrogen, fuel, oxidizer, and water sup- ply and distribution systems. Two of the test stands are capable of simulat- ing altitudes up to 250,000 ft. A vibration facility is provided for dynamic vibration and shock testing of components and complete engine assemblies. The high-thrust test facilities are augmented by a fifth test zone which is used for component testing. This facility includes five control buildings — each operating up to four test set ups and a time-versus-volume flowmeter cali- bration facility. * Propellant storage and distribu- tion— The bulk storage and distribution control system is centrally located. The selection of this area was influenced by two factors; it was minimum dis- tance for a single bulk storage facility, and it most nearly complied with quan- tity-distance regulations established by for the propellants hydrazine, UDMH, and nitrogen tetroxide. Fuel and oxidizer unloading sta- tions are provided for truck and rail- 28 missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 car deliveries. The unloading opera- tion, as well as the fuel mixing and coordination of transfer to the various test locations, will be controlled from the central control building located within the storage area. Propellant spillage and scrubber effluent are di- rected to the large concrete-lined water sump equipped with a pH meter to detect excessive concentrations of fuel or oxidizer. Chemicals are added to provide neutralization if the con- centration exceeds the normal limit. The unloading of the tankers, which are pressurized by nitrogen, and the transfer from the storage facility to the test stand tanks, is an operation remotely controlled from the station located in the storage area. It is con- ducted from a process-type display panel with an override control at the receiving point for use in the event of an abnormality. • Fuel mix facility — Since Aero- zine-50 fuel is not supplied in the blended condition, a fuel mixing facility had to be constructed. This facility is located between the fuel unloading station and the fuel storage. Two stainless steel tanks having capacities of 11,300 gallons (UDMH) and 8800 gallons (hydrazine) are mounted on strain gage load cells. The fuel components are pumped sepa- rately but simultaneously from each outlet into an impeller mixer, the out- put of which is directed to the fuel storage tanks. Continuous recording of the per- cent mix is presented at the control station on a potentiometer-type strip chart recorder. In addition, a continu- ous record is made of the specific gravity of the mix. The percent mix display includes visual limits of mix, as well as off-mix alarm devices. The tank load cell system provides a back- up with these system refinements: a. A check on the overall ratio of the mixed fuels. b. A record of the delivered pro- pellant weight. c. A backup in the event of a failure of the conductivity system. • Scrubbers — Scrubbers are pro- vided to minimize the toxicity of the propellant vapors expelled from the test stand run, catch, or storage tanks during any venting operations. Interim scrubbers of the water spray or chemi- cal type have been used. The operational facility has venturi throat scrubbers typical of those man- ufactured by the Schutte and Koerting Co. The gases are scrubbed by the action of the liquid spray — a 20% sodium hydroxide solution for oxidizer gases, and water for fuel gases — which creates sufficient suction to entrain the gas and enter the throat of the venturi where the gas and spray are mixed and the gas thoroughly scrubbed. • Test stand systems — For the stor- able propellants, all bleed and drain systems are closed-loop (i.e., propel- lants are never intentionally exposed to the atmosphere) or routed into scrubbers. In addition, downward slopes are maintained in all propellant lines to provide for ease of draining and bleeding; propellant outflow from the bleeds and drains is routed into a catch tank for each propellant. All propellant vapors are routed through the scrubbers for each propellant. Catch or dump tanks are provided for each propellant in each test zone. They have enough capacity to contain the full run tank volume in the event of an emergency that requires rapid evacuation of the propellant run tanks. These tanks are also used as catch tanks for all closed-loop bleeding or draining effluent. Provisions have also been made to transfer contaminated propellant from these tanks into tank trucks for disposal or refining. Propellants which have been in- advertently spilled are immediately washed down with copious amounts of water. Concrete drains route the spilled mixture into a large concrete sump equipped with a pH monitoring device. When excessive buildup of a propellant is noted, the sump is chemically treated to neutralize its contents. The deflector residue is also routed into this sump. Ground water outflow from the plant perimeter is continuously moni- tored to detect the presence of ex- cessive propellant residue. If excessive buildup is detected, the outflow is di- rected into retention ponds for chemi- cal treatment. • Safety — Safety of personnel has been a major part of this program from its inception. Design of the system for safety has naturally been stressed. We have also added emphasis on pre-planning to in- sure that all employees completely understand the work to be performed, installed a buddy system so that no employee is allowed to work alone on storables, and thoroughly instructed employees on comprehension of safety clothing and the plan for unexpected emergencies. The current medical history record of a representative group of personnel has shown no adverse effects as a result of their daily work with stor- ables. missiles and rockets, September 5, I960 29 FROM LABORATORY CURIOSITY TO MISSILE TRAJECTORY... ICROELECTRONIC GRAY MATTER FOI TOMORROW'S air and sea launched ballistic mis- siles will fulfill a pivotal role in the nation's retaliatory arsenal. Directing their flight will be revolutionary guid- ance computers, miniaturized to a point far beyond the limit of conventional design techniques. But before this degree of miniaturization can be achieved in a computer that must be more than a laboratory curi- osity a radically new design philosophy must be applied. Engineers at G.E.'s Light Military Electronics Depart- ment are meeting the challenges of size and sophistica- tion by pursuing a predominantly functional approach to micro-electronics . . . exploiting the versatility of tun- nel diodes and other semiconductors in conjunction with thin film circuit wafers. And by designing for microminiaturization from the start, not only is it feasible to achieve far greater component densities — the development of standardized circuits and functional modules also reduces the numbers of components and connection in- terfaces, significantly enhancing predicted reliability. MISSILE GUIDANCE Electronics engineers with experience and interest in this burgeoning field are invited to write informally for additional technical data or information on specific professional opportunities.

Lowry AFB, Colo. — A \"concrete machine\" rapidly taking shape here — the first hard site for Titan I — is ex- pected to be ready for operation by a squadron by mid- 1961. Construction on the complex is now at its peak, the Air Force says, and final brick-and-mortar work will take another six months. The remaining site (minus equipment) will house the 703rd Strategic Missile Wing; it is built to withstand a near miss, but not a direct hit. The Air Force declined to specify what size weapons these estimates were based on, but the structures are de- signed to withstand a 100 psi over- pressure. Tolerances required of the concrete work in this first site gave rise to the \"concrete machine\" description. These require a 1/32-in. silo tolerance, in addition to shock-mountings for all other equipment, including stairways, toilets, doors, light fixtures, floors and operational equipment. The overwhelming size, weight, and depth of the complex make it apparent the Air Force expects to be hit first, but is intent on maintaining the ability to hit back. Everything is designed to maintain a reaction time of less than 15 minutes. Maintenance will be on a remove- and-replace basis, with no attempt to make any repairs at the site. The Air Force says it is producing birds at a rate which will allow for replacement. Crews will travel periodically to one of the established missile ranges to get experience in actual launches, rather than merely static tests. Each squadron will have nine mis- siles, with one extra as a spare. Three missiles will be at each of the three launch complexes in the Titan I system, and the Titan II system will have only one storable, fueled missile at each site. • Direct command — If war comes, a command to launch the missiles will come directly from the White House to the launch control center without trav- elling through any of the routine com- mand channels. In event the President and other government leaders are cas- ualties, \". . . an alternate plan will be followed,\" said a SAC officer. There will be about five 12-man crews at each complex — about half as many as are considered necessary at a hardened Atlas site, the Air Force said. Living quarters are provided under- ground for crew members. The Titan sites are expected to be ready for oper- ation before the hardened Atlas sites. The second floor of the control center in the power house is not at- tached in any way to the external domes of these units, but is mounted on inde- pendent pillars which are attached to spring-beams in the main floor. Under a load, these steel beams flex like an automobile leaf spring. There is a 12- in. \"rattle space\" between the edges of the second floor and the internal wall of the dome. Dispersal between sites is about six miles here, although the Air Force says the optimum is 18 miles. The initial explanation for the dis- crepancy was that the Air Force re- duced the distance in the interest of economy, considering the cost of addi- tional land acquisition. It was later ex- plained that the Lowry complex was:< planned and begun before the 18-mile figure was established. This in turn was attributed to in- creased Soviet nuclear capability. • Vulnerability — Despite the tre- mendous emphasis on hardened sites and short reaction time, there is an unescapable period of vulnerability which the Air Force hopes to eliminate with all-inertial guidance.
