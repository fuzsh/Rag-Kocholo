        "text": "San Marino, entirely surrounded by Italy, is not only the smallest country in Southern Europe, but also the world’s oldest republic, with a constitution established in 1600. This fascinating microstate, named after Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia, offers a unique blend of ancient history and modern-day charm.\n\nThe country is home to a number of historical sites, including the Three Towers of San Marino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounding by Saint Marinus\n\nThe history of San Marino traces back to 301 A.D., when a Christian stonemason named Marinus founded the world’s oldest surviving republic. Saint Marinus, fleeing persecution, established a monastic settlement on Mount Titano, laying the foundation for what would become the Republic of San Marino.\n\nThe country’s claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state has had a significant impact on its foreign and political affairs, setting it apart from other nations in Europe.\n\nIndependence and Diplomatic Relations\n\nSan Marino’s independence was officially acknowledged by the Papacy in 1631, marking the beginning of its diplomatic relations with other countries. Over the centuries, San Marino has managed to maintain its sovereignty and autonomy, even in the face of challenges such as the brief occupation by Cardinal Alberoni’s forces in 1739, which ultimately led to the Pope reinstating San Marino’s sovereignty.\n\nThe country has experienced various political events, such as the Rovereta Affair in 1957, which saw competing governments, armed militias, US and Italian intervention, and an Italian blockade of San Marino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonte Titano and the historic centre of San Marino, encompassing an area of 55 hectares, proudly hold the title of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This exceptional destination showcases the formation of a representative democracy grounded in civic autonomy and self-governance.\n\nThe city of San Marino has served as the unbroken capital of an independent republic since the 13th century. It is a testament to the resilience of the people of San Marino and their commitment to self.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonte Titano\n\nMonte Titano, the highest peak in the Republic of San Marino, offers breathtaking landscapes and panoramic views of the surrounding Italian region and the Adriatic Sea.

This practice of having two heads of state, akin to Roman consuls, is derived from the customs of the Roman Republic, and continues to shape the country’s political landscape today.\n\nThe Captains Regent are elected on a biannual basis, showcasing the country’s commitment to democracy and frequent elections.\n\nConsiglio Grande e Generale\n\nThe Consiglio Grande e Generale, San Marino’s parliament, consists of 60 members elected for a five-year term. This legislative body is responsible for making decisions on behalf of the citizens of San Marino, ensuring their voices are heard and their concerns are addressed.\n\nIn addition to electing the Captains Regent, the Great and General Council also elects the Congress of State, a 10-member body that holds executive power in San Marino, further demonstrating the country’s dedication to democracy and representation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Marino offers a wealth of culture and attractions for visitors to explore, including:\n\nIntriguing museums\n\nIconic monuments\n\nVibrant festivals\n\nDelectable cuisine\n\nDelve into the heart of this captivating microstate and uncover the treasures that await you in every corner!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscover the history of San Marino, from its ancient origins to its modern status.\n\nMuseums and Monuments\n\nAs you wander through the streets of San Marino, you’ll come across a variety of unique museums and monuments, including:\n\nThe Palazzo Pubblico, San Marino’s town hall, stands as the most iconic building in the city, showcasing the country’s architectural prowess and historical significance.\n\nThe Torture Museum, where you can learn about the dark history of punishment and torture methods.\n\nThe Museum of Curiosity, which houses a collection of odd and fascinating artifacts from around the world.\n\nThese museums and monuments offer a glimpse into the rich history and culture of San Marino.\n\nThe Torture Museum and the Museum of Curiosity, on the other hand, offer a glimpse into the darker and more peculiar aspects of history, housing a selection of instruments of torture from the Middle Ages and a collection of rare and curious objects from various regions, respectively.\n\nLocal Cuisine and Wine\n\nWhile exploring the charming streets of San Marino, be sure to indulge in the delicious local cuisine and wine that the country has to offer.
