        "text": "Current Enrollment Statistics:\n\nOfficial Winter Enrollment Report\n\nAugust Enrollment Figures\n\nParty Enrollment\n\nBy enrolling in a constituted party you can help designate candidates by signing petitions and voting in a primary election. You are not obligated to vote for your party’s candidate in the General Election however, you may cast your vote for any candidate on any party line.\n\nTo vote in a Primary Election, you must register for one of the following constituted political parties by indicating your preference on the voter registration form: Democratic, Republican, Conservative, Working Families.\n\nYou can also choose to write-in a party or not enroll in a party, but in either of these cases you will not be able to participate in a primary.\n\nChanging Enrollment\n\nIf you are currently actively registered to vote and are enrolled in one of the constituted political parties, you may request at any time to change your party enrollment. If you are actively registered to vote and are currently unaffiliated with any constituted political party or \"Blank\", you may request at any time to become enrolled in one of the constituted political parties.\n\nTo change or add party affiliation, fill out a voter registration form making sure to indicate your new party choice and submit the registration form to the Board of Elections by mail or in person.\n\nVoters can change their party enrollment online with a valid DMV issued ID or license at https://dmv.ny.gov/ or by completing a paper registration form and returning it to their County Board of Elections. Any change of party enrollment done via the DMV site requires an extra day to allow for transmission.\n\n*From the New York State Board of Elections website - A change of enrollment received up until February 14th each year will be effective immediately. Changes received on or after February 15th until seven days after the June Primary will be set aside and opened the seventh day following the June Primary and entered in the voter's registration record.\n\nIf you have a NY Driver's License, Permit or Non-driver ID card you can file a change of party enrollment online here: https://dmv.ny.gov/more-info/electronic-voter-registration-application. Because DMV needs the weekend to process the online request, it should be done through the DMV portal no later than February 11th to be timely.\n\nIf you do not have a DMV-issued ID or the DMV portal is not working for you, then you must file a new paper voter registration form with your local board of elections with your updated information. You can obtain a form from any post office, public library, government office or the county board of elections office, or you can print a form from our website.\n\nForms requesting a change of party enrollment must be RECEIVED by the local county board of elections no later than February 14th to be effective for this year’s June Primary.\n\nPrior Enrollment Years\n\nThe following are the Official Fall Enrollment numbers for each year noted. They represent the eligible voters for that year's General Election.\n\n2022 Fall Enrollment\n\n2021 Fall Enrollment\n\n2020 Fall Enrollment\n\n2019 Fall Enrollment\n\n2018 Fall Enrollment\n\n2017 Fall Enrollment\n\n2016 Fall Enrollment\n\n2015 Fall Enrollment\n\n2014 Fall Enrollment\n\n2013 Fall Enrollment\n\n2012 Fall Enrollment\n\n2011 Fall Enrollment\n\n2010 Fall Enrollment\n\n2009 Fall Enrollment\n\n2008 Fall Enrollment\n\n2007 Fall Enrollment\n\n2006 Fall Enrollment\n\n2005 Fall Enrollment\n\n2004 Fall Enrollment\n\n2003 Fall Enrollment\n\n2002 Fall Enrollment\n\n2001 Fall Enrollment\n\n2000 Fall Enrollment\n\nPolitical Parties"
