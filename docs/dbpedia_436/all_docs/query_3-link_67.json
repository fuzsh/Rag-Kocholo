        "text": "The micro-State of San Marino was initially governed by the Arengo, initially made up of the heads of families. In the 13th century the institution relinquished its powers in favor of the Great General Council. In 1243, the first two regent captains were appointed by that Council and this form of appointment continues in use today.\n\nLegislative bodies\n\nThe Great General Council (Consiglio Grande e General)\n\nMain article: Grand Council of San Marino\n\nThe Council is made up of 60 members elected every 5 years through a system of proportional representation in the nine castelli. These administrative divisions correspond to the old parishes of the Republic, and each one is governed by a Council headed by a Captain elected every 5 years. The Great General Council approves the budget as well as elects the Captains Regent, as heads of the Executive.\n\nParliament and chamber\n\nThe legislative body is made up of the Grand General Council, Parliament, and a Chamber. Members of Parliament are elected every five years and are responsible for legislation, justice and resolving jurisdiction issues. They are also in charge of the election of the Regent Captains, the State Congress, the Council of Twelve, the Advisory Commission. Parliament is also in charge of ratifying treaties with other countries. Parliament is divided into five Advisory Commissions made up of 15 members who study, propose and debate the incorporation of new laws that will be discussed in the Great General Council.\n\nExecutive bodies\n\nThe Regent Captains\n\nMain article: Regent Captain of San Marino\n\nEvery six months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to serve as Heads of State. The Regents are chosen from among different parties, with which the Headquarters is balanced. The investiture takes place on April 1 and October 1 of each year. When the term ends, the citizens have three days to file complaints about the acts carried out by the Regents. If they are admitted for processing, legal proceedings are opened with the former head of state.\n\nThe practice of dual rule, as well as the frequency of re-election, derive directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The Council is equivalent to the Roman Senate and the Regent Captains are the modern version of the consuls of ancient Rome.\n\nThe State Congress\n\nThe State Congress is made up of 10 Secretaries that exercise executive power. It is actually a cabinet of ministers. The 10 secretariats are:\n\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs.\n\nState Secretariat for Internal Affairs and Civil Defence.\n\nState Secretariat for Finance, Budget and Programming, Information and Relations with the Office of Numismatics and Philatelia.\n\nState Secretariat for Education, Culture, University and Justice.\n\nState Secretariat for Agriculture, Environment and Territory.\n\nState Secretariat for Social Security and Health.\n\nSecretary of State for Trade and Relations with the Citizen Council.\n\nSecretary of State for Communications, Transport, Relations with the Azienda Autonoma di Stato, Service Tourism and Sports.\n\nState Secretariat for Industry and Crafts.\n\nSecretary of State for Labour and Cooperation.\n\nJudicial bodies\n\nThe Council of Twelve (Consiglio dei XII)\n\nThe Council of Twelve is elected by the Grand General Council for the entire legislature, serving as the judicial body and also acts as a third instance in the Court of Appeals. Two government inspectors represent the State in financial and patrimonial matters.\n\nJudicial organization\n\nSan Marino's judicial system is entrusted to outsiders for both historical and social reasons. The only native judges are the Justices of the Peace, who can only handle civil cases that do not exceed 25 million Liras (about 13,000 euros). The Council of Twelve serves as the court of appeal in third instance.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nSee also: Annex: Political Parties of San Marino\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. The three main political parties are the San Marino Christian Democratic Party (PDCS), the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD), and the San Marino People's Alliance (APSM) along with several smaller ones such as the United Left coalition of San Marino (IUSM) or the New Socialist Party of San Marino (NPSSM). Due to the small population and territory of the country, it is difficult for any party to achieve an absolute majority and most of the time a coalition is formed. As a result of the June 4, 2006 elections, the PDCS and PSD hold the majority of seats on the Council.\n\nBecause tourism represents more than 50% of the economy, the government has abolished taxes and customs duties, except for the sale of coins and stamps. In addition, the Italian government gives San Marino an annual budget after the Basic Treaty signed by both parties.\n\nCurrent Affairs\n\nThe main issue facing the current government are the economic and administrative problems derived from San Marino's status as an Italian enclave, which leads it to a total financial and commercial dependence on the neighboring country while at the same time it does not belong to the European Union. The other priority is to increase the transparency and efficiency of Parliament and its relations with the Cabinet and the Captains Regent.\n\nMain data\n\nFrom the CIA World Factbook.\n\nCountry Name:\n\nConventional long form: Republic of San Marino\n\nConventional short form: San Marino\n\nLocal long form: Republic of San Marino (RSM)\n\nLocal short form: San Marino\n\nCode: YE\n\nType of Government: Republic\n\nCapital: San Marino\n\nAdministrative divisions: 9 municipalities (castelli, singular - castello); Acquaviva, Borgo Maggiore, Chiesanuova, Domagnano, Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, San Marino, Serravalle\n\nIndependence: 301 (by tradition)\n\nNational holiday: Anniversary of the founding of the Republic, September 3, (301)\n\nConstitution: October 8, 1600; The electoral law of 1926 sometimes performs constitutional functions.\n\nLegal system: Based on a system of civil laws influenced by the Italian ones.
