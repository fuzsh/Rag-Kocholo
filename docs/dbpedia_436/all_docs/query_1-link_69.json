        "text": "PORTAGE, MI -- Voters chose Matt Longjohn to represent the Democratic Party in the Nov. 5 election for Michigan’s 40th House District.\n\nLongjohn topped Lisa Brayton — a former Republican who was running as a Democrat — in the Tuesday, Aug. 6, primary.\n\nLongjohn will run against Republican Kelly Sackett, who ran unopposed in the primary. The winner will earn a two-year term in the state legislature.\n\nDistrict 40 includes the city of Portage and parts of Texas Township and Oshtemo Township.\n\nAccording to unofficial totals, Longjohn won with 7,764 votes (70.4%) compared to Brayton’s 3,264 votes (29.6%).\n\nRELATED: Live election results for Kalamazoo-area races, Aug. 6, 2024\n\nBrayton, 53, ran as a Republican for the Kalamazoo County Commission in 2020 before she was elected to a four-year term on the Portage City Council in 2021. She was disqualified from the city’s mayoral race in 2023 due to a residency issue.\n\nLongjohn, also 53, teaches medical students at WMed and runs his own health systems consulting business. He also serves on the Portage Planning Commission. He ran against Republican Fred Upton for a U.S. House seat in 2018, losing in the general election. He faced criticism for using the title M.D. in campaign materials.\n\nRep. Christine Morse, D-Texas Township, has held the 40th District seat since 2023. She first took office in 2021, prior to redistricting.\n\nInstead of pursuing another term, Morse is ran for a new judgeship in the 9th Circuit Court, leaving her seat open. In that race, she earned enough votes Tuesday to advance to the general election.\n\nWant more Kalamazoo-area news?
