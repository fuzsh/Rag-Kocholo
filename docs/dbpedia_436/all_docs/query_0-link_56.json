        "text": "Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) – a unicameral Assemblée nationale (National Assembly), an assembly of 255 members. Members are directly elected in 205 conscriptions (electoral divisions). 169 of the conscriptions are allotted one seat and the plurality voting method is used, while the remaining 36 conscriptions see between 2 and 6 members elected using the block voting (scrutin de list) method is used. The Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace party has heavily dominated recent elections, and almost all non-dominant party members are elected as independents. Terms are 5 years.\n\nCôte d’Ivoire has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nCroatia – a unicameral Hrvatski Sabor (National Assembly) of which the sole house is an assembly of 151 members. 140 seats are allocated to 10 electoral divisions, each of 14 seats. The electoral division boundaries are not based on local administrative boundaries, but are special boundaries drawn according to a legal requirement that each division’s population of voters varies by no more than 5% from the mean. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated within each division by the semi-open party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula, to parties which win at least 5% of the total vote in that division. Voters may mark a vote for an individual candidate against their chosen party list, and any candidate who individually wins 10% or more of the total vote has precedence over the list order in allocating seats to individuals. A further 8 seats are reserved for representatives of Croatia’s 22 ethnic minorities (3 of these seats being for Serbian voters). Finally, 3 seats are allocated to representatives of Croatians living overseas. These two additional groups of seats are also filled by party list seat allocation systems. Terms are four years.\n\nCroatia has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Predsjednik Hrvatske (President), a constitutional president who is directly elected for a five-year term by the two-round runoff system, and individuals are limited to two terms of office. However, primary executive power is exercised by the Premijer (Prime Minister), nominated by the Predsjednik on the basis of the confidence of a majority in the Sabor. The Predsjednik and the Premijer share some foreign relations and defence roles. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nCuba – a unicameral Asamblea Nacional del Poder Popular (National Assembly of People’s Power), an assembly of 612 members. All members are semi-elected in multi-member divisions of between 2 to 5 members, with seats determined by a ratio of one for every 20,000 residents. Nomination is not free to all citizens, but is organized through ‘municipality commissions’ and also workers’ representative organisations administered by the ruling political party. The nomination process results in one candidate being nominated for each available seat, but elections are still held and each candidate must secure 50% of the vote to confirm their seat, failing which a new candidate will be sought through a fresh nomination process. Terms are five years.\n\nCuba has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by a Presidente (being the President both of the nation and also of the Council of State, and also referred to as either Prime Minister or Premier). The President is chosen by the Asamblea Nacional (although since 1959 only the brothers Fidel and Raúl Castro have held the office). (Last updated January 2018.)\n\nCyprus – a unicameral Vouli ton Antiprosópon (Greek, also Temsilciler Meclisi (Turkish), House of Representatives), an assembly of nominally 80 members, but in practice 56 members. The arrangements predate the division of Cyprus and purport not to recognise that division. Seats are allocated in a 7:3 ratio between voters (and candidates) from each of the Greek (currently 56 seats) and Turkish (nominally another 24 seats) Cypriot ethnic communities, which divide geographically. However, since the political division of Cyprus in 1963 (roughly along the geographic line of ethnic division) the Turkish community places have not been filled. The 56 seats currently filled by Greek Cypriot voters are allocated in proportion to population to 6 electoral divisions based on the boundaries of administrative districts. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated within each division by the open party list system of seat allocation. There are three rounds of distribution of seats/ In the first, done within each of the six districts, parties are awarded seats using the simple quota and the largest remainder method with one seat for each whole quota. A second distribution pools all unsuccessful votes, including successful parties remainders, and pools all seats yet unallocated, and and allocates seats to parties using a second simple quota calculation, but only to parties which achieved a vote share of 3.6% nationwide (10% for coalitions). If the total of seats allocated still falls short of 56, these final remaining seats are awarded in order of vote share total to any party which won more that 7.2% of the vote nationwide. Voters may mark one individual candidate preference for every four seats available in their electoral division. Parties may identify party leaders, who are always given precedence on the lists when awarding seats allocated to parties to individual candidates, and after that other candidates come in order of the voters’ marking of preferences. Terms are up to five years. The Vouli also has 3 non-voting observer members representing the Maronite, Latin and Armenian ethnic minorities.\n\nCyprus has the premier-presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President subject to a division of responsibilities and powers shared with the Vouli, which is formally independent of the President. The President is directly elected for a five-year term by the two-round runoff system, but under a policy of balancing ethnic divisions candidates for the position must be Cypriot citizens of the Turkish ethnicity. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nCzech Republic (Czechia)– a bicameral Parlament of which the lower house is the Poslanecká Sněmovna (Chamber of Deputies), an assembly of 200 members. For the election of the Poslanecká Sněmovna the nation is divided into 14 electoral divisions based on administrative regions. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated within each division by the open party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt method[viii], to parties which win 5% of the total vote in that region (for multi-party coalition lists the threshold is higher: 5% per party included, up to a maximum threshold of 20%). Voters mark ballots with up to four preferences for individual candidates within their chosen list. Individual candidates who receive more than 5% of the preferences on the ballots supporting their party are raised up to the top of the list order for allocating seats won. Terms are four years.\n\nThe Czech Republic has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is elected by a joint session of the Parlament. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Předseda Vlády (Prime Minister, or Chairman of the Government) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Poslanecká Sněmovna. (Last updated September January 2023.)\n\nDenmark – a unicameral Folketinget, a composite assembly of 179 members. 175 of the members are indirectly elected by a partially open party list system of levelled seat allocation. Each voter may vote for a party list, for one of the candidates on a party list (which vote will be counted as a vote for that party), or for an independent candidate (whose votes are counted as if she were a party). 135 seats are filled in 17 electoral divisions based on the 10 Danish districts by a system of seat allocation using the D’Hondt divisor formula. 40 supplementary seats are then allotted so that the total seats for each party is equal to a proportional share of the 175 seats, calculated by the Sainte-Lague method. To be eligible for any of the 40 supplementary seats parties must either (i) pass the threshold of 2% of the national vote, (ii) win at least one division (district) seat, or (iii) win at least a Hare quota of aggregate votes/aggregate seats (of the initial 135 seats) in two of the three national provinces. The party list system is a blend of ‘open’ or ‘closed’ approaches; each party may choose from among a number of methods for how the seats won by that party will be distributed among its individual candidates. Parties may choose an open list approach, but the closed list order is the most commonly chosen method, and for such parties the threshold for the personal vote for an individual candidate to override the list order is very high. Finally, Danish citizens in the overseas territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands each elect two members to the Folketinget by the SNTV direct election voting method. Terms are up to four years. This electoral system dates from 1849, with significant modifications in 1855 (trialling aspects of the early STV system proposed by Carl Andrae), 1915, 1920 and 1953.[ix][x]\n\nDenmark has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Queen. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Statsminister (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Folketinget. (Last updated July 2023.)\n\nDjibouti – a unicameral Assemblée Nationale of which the sole house is an assembly of 65 members. Seats are allocated among six electoral divisions in proportion to population, in numbers ranging from 3 to 35. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by block vote system, such that in each division the party list that obtains the plurality of the vote is awarded 80% of the seats for that division. The remaining 20% of seats (13 in total nationwide) are allocated by the closed party list system of seat allocation to parties (other than the party winning the block vote in each division) that won at least 10% of the vote, but if there are no such other parties in a division then these seats are also awarded to the majority party. Terms are five years.\n\nUntil 2012 the electoral system provided that the plurality party would be awarded all the seats for a division. From 1999 to 2013 this highly distortionary system saw the dominant People’s Rally for Progress (RPP) party and its coalition partners hold all 65 seats. RPP has not been out of office since national institutions of government were established in 1979. Djiboutian elections are regularly boycotted and their integrity is highly disputed.\n\nDjibouti has the presidential system of government, in which executive authority is vested in a constitutional President who is directly elected for five year terms, nominally by the two-round runoff method, although no recent election has seen the RPP candidate win less than 80% of the official vote. The President appoints a Prime Minister and cabinet. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nDominican Republic – a bicameral Congreso Nacional (National Congress) of which the lower house is the Cámara de Diputados (Chamber of Deputies), an assembly of currently 190 members. 178 seats are allocated in 32 Circuncriptions (electoral divisions) based on the 31 provinces and the national capital district, on the basis of one deputy per 50,000 inhabitants or remainder in excess of half that quota, provided that each province must have at least two deputies in total. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by the open party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. A further 5 seats are allocated to parties which won at least 1% of the national vote but were not allocated any seats in the 32 regional districts. A final 7 members are elected from among citizens who are resident oversees. Terms are 4 years.\n\nThe Republic has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. A president is limited to a single consecutive term of office, but may run again at future elections after a term out of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nEcuador – a unicameral Asamblea Nacional (National Assembly), a composite assembly of 137 members. These members are not directly elected but seats are allocated to parties in two categories by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the Sainte-Laguë method. One category of 116 seats in total are allocated in multi-member regional districts. A second group of 15 seats are allocated in a national pool. Finally, 6 representatives of citizens living abroad are elected in 3 overseas divisions – Canada/United States, Latin America and Asia/Europe/Oceania – in each of which 2 representatives are directly elected using the SNTV method. Terms are 4 years.\n\nEcuador has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by thetwo-round runoff method, with the proviso that if a candidate scores 40% of the vote and is 10% ahead of their nearest rival, that candidate wins on the first round. A president is limited to two 4-year terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nEgypt – a unicameral Majlis Al-Sha’ab (People’s Council), a composite assembly of 596 members. The composition of the Majlis, and related election laws, were significantly reorganised during 2014-15 and and again for the 2020 elections. As of the 2020 elections, 284 members are directly elected in 143 electoral divisions of either 1 or 2 seats, using the two-round runoff system. The remaining 284 members are not directly elected, but are allocated to political parties in four very large-magnitude electoral divisions (filling 100, 100, 42 and 42 seats respectively) by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. The President of Egypt also appoints a final 28 supplementary members of the majlis. Terms are 5 years.\n\nEgypt has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Rỷys (President), who is directly elected for a 4-year term by the two-round runoff system. A president is limited to two terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nÉire – a bicameral Oireachtas (Legislature) of which the lower house is the Dáil Éireann (literally ‘Assembly of Ireland’, but also translatable as National Assembly), an assembly currently of 160 members. TeachtaiDála (members) are directly elected in 40 multi-member divisions (termed ‘constituencies’) by the single transferable vote (STV) method. Éire is one of only two nations in the world – the other being Malta – to elect its lower house by this method. The STV method, used in Ireland since 1921, was entrenched in the national constitution in 1937 and two referendum attempts (in 1959 and 1968) to replace it with plurality voting were rejected by the electorate. The Constitution also sets the minimum number of seats in a division at three, and requires that the overall ratio of members in each division to population must fall between 1:20,000 and 1:30,000. Legislative provisions adopted in 2011 provide that the number of members must be between 153 and 160. Constituency boundaries are reviewed by an independent commission at least every 12 years to reflect changes in population distribution and to minimise malapportionment; the most recent revision applies from the 2016 election. Each electoral division is allocated either 3, 4 or 5 seats, and the specific seat allocations to divisions are recalculated for each election. If at an election the sitting presiding officer of the Dáil (the Ceann Comhairle) does not retire, he or she is deemed to have been automatically re-elected in their constituency, and that constituency elects one fewer member than its initial allocation of seats. Candidate names are listed on ballot papers in individual alphabetical order in a single column. By-elections are held using preferential voting, which often causes the vacant seat to change hands between parties. Terms are up to five years.\n\nÉire has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a directly elected constitutional Uachtarán (President). However, actual executive power is exercised by the Toiseach (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Dáil. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nEl Salvador – a unicameral Asamblea Legislativa, an assembly of 84 members. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated, in two tiers, to parties by the open party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. 64 seats are allocated to electoral divisions based on the nation’s 14 regional departments, which are allotted numbers of seats in proportion to population (currently ranging from 3 to 16). A second group of 20 seats are allocated in a national pool. Voters may mark preferences for any number of individual candidates from within or across parties, but their vote will be divided into fractions (totalling one vote) using such preference marks for the purpose of determining the total ‘number of votes’ achieved by each party list. Once the numbers of seats to allocate to each party list are calculated, the preference totals for individual candidates are again used to determine which individual candidates are awarded seats. Terms are 3 years.\n\nEl Salvador has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Presidente, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. A presidente is limited to a single consecutive term of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nEquatorial Guinea – a bicameral Parlamento of which the lower house is the Cámara de los Diputados (Chamber of Deputies), an assembly of 100 members. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation. Parties must achieve 10% of the vote nationwide to be eligible to be allocated any seats. Terms are five years.\n\nEquatorial Guinea is effectively a one-party state, with the dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea party winning 100 out of 100 seats at the most recent elections in 2022; only 8 opposition members have ever been elected to the Cámara since its establishment.\n\nEquatorial Guinea has the presidential system of government, in which executive authority is vested in a constitutional President who is (nominally) directly elected for five year terms by the two-round runoff method. Current president Teodoro Obiang has been in office since 1979. The President appoints a Prime Minister and cabinet. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nEstonia – a unicameral Riigikogu of which the sole house is an assembly of 101 members. Seats are allocated in proportion to population among 12 electoral divisions, in numbers ranging from 6 to 13 seats. The electoral system has an unusual combination of direct election of individual representatives together with seat allocation to political parties, operating in three stages of counting. Voters cast a vote for a single candidate in their electoral district, whose party affiliation is also made clear. For the first two stages of counting, seats are allocated in proportion to population among 12 electoral districts, in numbers ranging from 5 to 15 seats (at the 2023 election). First, within each electoral district, any candidate who received a simple (Hare) quota of the votes cast in their district is elected. It is possible for candidates of minor parties who do not meet the national 5% vote threshold (see following) to be elected in the first stage, and independent candidates may nominate, and will win a seat if they achieve a first-stage quota. For the second of counting, in each electoral district each political party is allocated seats for each whole simple quota won in aggregate by all the candidates of their party. However, a party (or coalition of parties) is only eligible to be allocated such seats if it has won 5% of the nationwide vote total. Seats allocated to parties in the second stage are are awarded to individual candidates in order of their individual votes (including any candidates who won a quota in their own name at the first stage), except that individual candidates who fail to personally secure 10% of the simple quota of votes in their electoral district is not awarded a seat. Any seats not won in the first two rounds of counting go into a pool of seats for the third stage of counting, where they are also allocated to the parties or coalitions which have won 5% of the nationwide vote total, on the basis of applying a modified version of the D’Hondt divisor formula (where each divisor from the second onward is diminished, slightly advantaging parties with higher votes) to the nationwide vote totals to nominally allocate 101 seats (minus any seats won by independents or locally strong non-threshold parties) among the eligible parties. This third-stage allocation of seats to parties deducts the total number of seats won by parties in the first two stages to yield the number of third-stage seats for each party. These final seats are then filled from national closed party lists submitted by each party – which lists consist of all of the candidates nominated in the 12 electoral districts ranked in the order determined by the party – except that individual candidates who fail to personally secure 5% of the simple quota of votes in their electoral district are excluded. The awarding of seats to individual listed candidates at the third stage is also structured so as to ensure that the final assembly will include numbers of representatives from each electoral district that match the original numbers of seats allocated to each district. The system as a whole largely amounts to an open party list system, with a national levelling component drawn from the third stage of counting. But despite the overall open list character of the system, the final closed list component still allows parties to guarantee highly-listed candidates of a seat, unless their personal vote is very low. Terms are four years.\n\nEstonia has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is elected by the Riigikogu. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Peaminister (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Riigikogu. (Last updated March 2023.)\n\nEthiopia – a bicameral Parliament of which the lower house is the House of People’s Representatives or Yehizb Tewekayoch Mekir Bete (Amharic), an assembly of 547 members. 525 members are elected in local single member divisions (‘constituencies’) by the plurality voting method, and 22 additional seats are reserved for representatives of minority nationalities and peoples. The party configuration of Ethiopia is a single-dominant-party system, with the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front party winning 500 of the 547 seats at the 2015 elections. Terms are up to five years. The elections due in 2020 have been deferred by the government citing the civil unrest and warfare in the nation.\n\nEthiopia has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is directly elected by the House of People’s Representatives. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the House. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nFiji – a bicameral Parliament of which the lower house is the House of Representatives, an assembly of 51 members. The size of the assembly grows slowly with population, based on a rule that there will be one member for every 17,472 citizens. Members are not directly elected but are allocated to political parties using the open party list system of seat allocation. The nation is a single electoral division. Only parties which achieve 5% of the national vote share are eligible to be allocated seats. Terms are five years.\n\nFiji has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional President who is elected by the Fijian Great Council of Chiefs. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the House of Representatives. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nFinland – a unicameral Eduskunta (Parliament of Finland) of which the sole house is an assembly of 200 members. Seats are allocated in proportion to population among 14 electoral divisions. One division (the island of Åland) is allocated a single seat, and a member is directly elected by the plurality method. The other 13 divisions are each allocated 6 or more members, in proportion to their populations. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated within each division by the open party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. There is no minimum vote threshold for parties to be eligible for seats. Overall representation of parties in the Eduskunta is not made proportional to national vote totals by any formal mechanism. Terms are up to four years. This long-established electoral system dates from 1919.[xiii]\n\nFinland has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is directly elected. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Pääministeri (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Eduskunta. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nFrance – a bicameral Parlement of which the lower house is the Assemblée Nationale, an assembly of 577 members. 566 electoral divisions, termed circonscriptions, are divided among the 101 French Départements based on a target population (currently around 100,000 persons), and electoral law specifies that circonscription boundaries must be drawn so that variations of population between the divisions within each Département do not lead to a circonscription exceeding more than 20% the average population of the circonscription of the Département. (The most recent review of boundaries was done in advance of the 2017 elections.) An additional 11 circonscriptions are established for French citizens living overseas.\n\nMembers are directly elected in the circonscriptions by a form of the two-round runoff method – which is in practice a plurality method with an initial round of eliminations, and a capacity for transfer of voter support from eliminated or withdrawn candidates. If a candidate wins votes in the first round equal to a majority of the formal votes cast in their division, and also at least 25% of the total number of registered voters in their division, they are elected in that round. (There are rare instances of candidates winning a majority of votes in the first round but failing to achieve the second criterion where voter turnout is unusually low.) If there is no such winner, all candidates who poll in excess of 12.5% of the total number of registered voters in their division (or, if fewer than two candidates meet that condition, the two highest-placed candidates) run in a second round, which is determined by the plurality voting method. Instances where three candidates proceed to the second round are not uncommon, but bargaining between parties usually sees the tactical withdrawal of nominations between rounds.\n\nThe elections of April-May 2017 upended the traditional situation where the leading centre-left and centre right parties dominated most seats contests. As a result, the ‘centrist’ En Marche party of President Macron won a very distorted number of seats in the Assemblée. By contrast, the election of 2022 was the first in decades in which the recently-elected President’s party did not have a parliamentary majority, although the variety of parties of the left and right do not combine to form a workable majority either.\n\nTerms are up to five years.[xiv] Since 1875, the Assemblée electoral system has seen a variety of variations of the single-member district two-round approach, but also once made use of a system of party seat allocation at the 1986 elections.[xv]\n\nFrance has the premier-presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised jointly by the Président (President) and also the Premier Ministre (Prime Minister). The Président is directly elected for a five-year term by the two-round runoff system, and individuals are limited to 2 terms of office. The Premier Ministre is chosen on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Assemblée Nationale. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGabon – a bicameral Parlement of which the lower house is the Assemblée nationale (National Assembly), an assembly of 120 members. The nation is divided into 9 electoral divisions based on the nation’s provinces, which are allotted numbers of seats ranging from 9 to 18. Members are elected by the ‘absolute majority vote’, the details of which are unclear even from the Parline database, but which appear to be the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting method, but incorporating a two-round runoff element. Terms are 5 years.\n\nGabon has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected for a seven-year term by the two-round runoff method. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGambia – a unicameral National Assembly, an assembly of 53 members. 48 members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. The remaining 5 members, including the Speaker, are appointed by the President. Terms are 5 years.\n\nGambia has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected for a five-year term by the two-round runoff method. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGeorgia – a unicameral Sakartvelos parlament’i (Parliament of Georgia), a composite assembly of 150 members. 30 members are directly elected in single member divisions by a hybrid plurality voting/two-round runoff system, where if the first round plurality winner falls short of 30% of the formal vote, the contest goes to a second round. The other 120 seats are not directly elected, but are allocated within 11 electoral regions to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation, to parties achieving a threshold of 1% of the formal vote. Terms are 4 years.\n\nThe electoral composition of the Parlament’i has been the subject of intense civil dispute since the dominant Georgian Dream party won 75% of seats (and thus a capability to make constitutional changes) with 48% of the vote at the 2016 elections. The current system, used at elections 2020, was brokered after extensive civil unrest and international involvement. At these elections Georgian Dream again won secured 48% of the vote but this time only 60% of the seats; at the first round of voting turnout was 56%, but second round turnout was only 26% after many opposition parties called for a voting boycott.\n\nSince 2011 the provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have not voted due to their effective separation from the Georgian state.\n\nAt present Georgia has the premier-presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised jointly by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method, and the Prime Minister, who is nominated by and accountable to the Parlament’i. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGermany – A bicameral Bundestag (Federal Assembly) of which the lower house, also termed the Bundestag, is a composite assembly of nominally 598 members (but in recent elections, significantly more that 598). The Bundestag system of levelling, developed in the 1950s, was the first of the mixed-member proportional electoral systems. Voters cast votes on two distinct ballots, one for local division candidates (the Erststimmen or ‘first vote’) and one for parties nationally (the Zweitstimmen or ‘second vote’).\n\n299 local divisions are divided proportionally among the 16 German Land (states) in proportion to population. Using the Erststimmen, members for the 299 single member divisions are directly elected by the plurality voting method.\n\nUsing the Zweitstimmen, a supplementary number of at least 299 seats are allocated to parties using the closed party list system of seat allocation in the numbers required such that the party composition of the whole assembly is proportional to the national total votes for each party. Seats are distributed among all parties that have either won more than 5% of the total national Zweitstimmen vote, or won at least three Erststimmenlocal member divisions. (National parties representing ethnic minorities (such as the Danish community in Schleswig-Holstein or the Sorb people in Saxony) are excused from the election threshold due to the Constitutional imperative to protect such minorities. However no party representing these peoples has won seats in recent decades.) Each seat-eligible party is allocated supplementary seats proportionally using the Sainte-Laguë/Schepers method. Each party’s seat entitlement is then distributed between the Lander in proportion to the party’s national vote results in each of the Lander. (Note that this may not result in the total number of members from each Land being proportional to the populations of each land).\n\nDepending on the configuration of parties achieving the 5% Zweitstimmen national threshold, the parties’ relative second-vote vote shares, and their numbers of Erststimmen seat wins, the rules for mathematical proportionality are capable of distorting the number of supplementary seats significantly upward from the nominal total of 299. If a party has won more local divisions in a Land than it is entitled to according to the calculation described above, the relevant seats (termed ‘overhang seats’) are nevertheless awarded to the local candidate and the total size of the Bundestag is increased to maintain the desired party proportionality. In recent elections the number of these overhang seats has risen as a result of the two largest parties receiving decreasing shares of the total party vote while continuing to win almost all the local electoral division seats. Following a 2011 constitutional court ruling that this result was unacceptable because it amounted to a breach of the principle of equality of voter influence, an electoral rule has been adopted whereby additional party list seats are created to compensate for overhang seats, so as to ensure proportionality among the parties in the Bundestag relative to each such party’s share of the total national vote. Moreover, to ensure that such additional sets do not distort the relative seat totals between the 16 Lander, these additional seats are distributed nationwide, not only in the Land in which the phenomenon is caused. In 2017 the degree of this distortion rose sharply, with the Bavarian Christian Social Union party winning all 46 local seats in Bavaria, but only around 6% of the national second-vote, while four minor parties won much larger national vote shares of between 8% and 14%. The consequence was that the number of party list seats expanded by an additional 111 (from 299 to 410), resulting in a Bundestag of a total of 709 members. In the elections of 2021 the phenomenon increased further still, generating a total of 139 additional seats and a final Bundestag of 736 members.\n\nFinally, each party’s final supplementary entitlement of seats in each Land is awarded to specific candidates. Since individual candidates may be both nominated for a local division and also be placed on the regional party lists, seats are first ‘confirmed’ for candidates who have won local divisions in that Land, and any remaining seats are filled from other candidates on the party list.\n\nTerms of the Bundestag are up to four years.[xvi]\n\nGermany has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Bundespräsident, a constitutional president who is elected by a convention consisting of both houses of the Bundestag supplemented by regional legislators. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Bundeskanzler (Federal Chancellor) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the lower house Bundestag. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGhana – A unicameral Parliament, the sole house of which is an assembly of 275 members. All members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. Divisions boundaries are reviewed every 7 years or following each national census. Terms are four years.\n\nGhana has the premier-presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, subject to a division of responsibilities and powers shared with the Parliament that is formally independent of the President. The President is directly elected for a four year term by the two-round runoff system, and individuals are limited to 2 terms of office. (Last updated September 2023.)\n\nGreece – A unicameral Vouli ton Ellinon (Parliament of the Hellenes) of which the sole house is an assembly of 300 members. Greece is divided into 56 electoral divisions based on regional administrative divisions (nomoi); the two largest nomoi, Attica and Thessaloniki, are divided into five and two divisions electoral districts respectively. The number of seats allocated to each electoral division is in proportion to population, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method, determined every ten years following census. As at 2015, 48 of the divisions are multi-member, the largest being ‘Athens B’ with 42 seats, although most have fewer than 10 seats. Eight divisions are allotted only a single seat, and in these single member divisions members are directly elected using the plurality method. Across the 48 multi-member divisions a total of 288 seats are allocated to parties by the open party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method, but only among parties which receive 3% of the total national vote. A complex formula then distributes the determined party seat allocations across the multi-member divisions so that the intended divisional seat totals are also met. Voters may mark their ballots with preferences for a limited number of individual candidates – between 1 and 4 depending on the number of seats allocated to their electoral division – and the individual candidate totals are used to determine the order in which seats are allocated to candidates to fill each party’s seat allocation in each division. (If early elections are held with 18 months of previous elections, the system uses closed, rather than open, party lists.) Finally, the Vouli may by law direct that up to 5% of the total number of seats are filled by seat allocation to parties from separate national closed lists, using the original party national vote totals, and they have so legislated that 12 of the seats (making up the total of 300) are filled in this manner. This final element is often used to ensure that significant national leaders or prominent individuals have a certain path in to the Vouli. Terms are up to four years.\n\nThe overall result of this complex allocation system often generates anomalous numbers of individual candidates elected within electoral divisions compared to the enrolments and the actual voting results in the division.\n\nAt elections from 2012 to 2019, 50 of the 288 seats were extracted from the proportional allocation calculations described above and set aside as a seat bonus for the party which achieved the highest national vote total. These additional seats were filled by candidates from the party’s existing lists allocated across the electoral divisions in numbers proportional to the party’s vote shares in each division – a practice which meant that total number of members of the Vouli from each division would diverge somewhat from each division’s ideal population-proportional share. Following a change to the electoral law legislated in 2016, this rule will not apply to the election scheduled for 2023, but a lesser variant of it will return for the following election. (Greek constitutional rules provide that amendments to the electoral law come into effect at the second election following their passage, unless they are approved with a 2/3 parliamentary majority.)\n\nGreece has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is elected by the Vouli. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Pro̱thypourgós (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Vouli. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGuatemala – a unicameral Congreso, a composite assembly currently of 161 members. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. 130 seats are allocated within 23 electoral divisions based on the 22 departments of Guatemala, the capital department being subdivided into two electoral divisions. This number of seats is adjusted for each election in response to population changes. Seats are allotted to divisions in proportion to population, resulting in the two capital divisions having 11 and 19 seats, while the other departmental divisions vary in seat allotments between 1 and 10 seats. An additional 31 seats are allocated to parties on a national basis using separate party lists. Terms are 4 years.\n\nGuatemala has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Presidente, who is directly elected for a four-year term by the two-round runoff method. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGuinea – a unicameral National Assembly, a composite assembly of 114 members. 38 members are directly elected in single member divisions, based on 33 prefectures as well as five communes in the capital Conakry, by the plurality voting method. The remaining 76 members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation in a single national pool using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. Terms are 5 years.\n\nGuinea has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected for a five-year term. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGuinea-Bissau – a unicameral Assembleia Nacional Popular (National People’s Assembly), an assembly of 102 members. 100 members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties in 27 multi-member electoral divisions by the closed party list system of seat allocation. The final two seats are for representatives of citizens living abroad elected in two single-member divisions, one for residents of other places in Africa and the other for residents of Europe. Terms are 4 years.\n\nGuinea-Bissau has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Presidente, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. Guinea-Bissau has an unfortunate history of political instability (the most recent military coup in 2012 seeing the constitution suspended and later reinstated) and no presidente has completed a full five-year term since independence was achieved in 1973-4. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nGuyana – a unicameral National Assembly of which the sole house is a composite assembly of at least 65 and up to 72 members. None of the seats are directly elected. 40 seats are filled by the closed party list system of seat allocation from national party lists using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. A further 25 seats are allocated among 10 regional divisions, and these more local positions are also filled by the same closed list system. Up to six unelected executive ministers may also be appointed by the government to sit in the Assembly, but they are non-voting members. Finally, if the Assembly wishes, a non-member may also be appointed as Speaker, but such an officer does not vote in the Assembly. Terms are five years.\n\nGuyana has the premier-presidential system of government in which executive authority is vested in a President who is directly elected. The leader of the party winning the most votes at each Assembly election assumes the office of President for the term of the Assembly. The President however shares actual executive power with a Prime Minister drawn from the Assembly. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nHaiti – a bicameral Parlement of which the lower house is the Chambre des Députés (Chamber of Deputies), an assembly of 118 members. Members are directly elected in single member divisions by the two-round runoff method. In the first round a candidate is elected if they achieve either 50% of the formal vote or a lead of 25% of the formal vote over the second-placed candidate. Terms are 4 years. Political disruption in Haiti has seen elections scheduled for 2019 delayed more than once, and are now scheduled to occur in 2023.\n\nHaiti has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nHonduras – a unicameral Congreso Nacional, an assembly of 128 members. Seats are allotted among the 18 Honduran departments in proportion to population, with seat numbers ranging from 1 to 23. In departmental divisions allocated just 1 seat, election of members is direct by the plurality voting method. All other members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. Terms are 4 years.\n\nHonduras has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. A president is limited to two terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nHungary – A unicameral Az Orszag Haza or Országgyűlés (National Assembly or Diet) of which the sole house is a composite assembly of 199 members. 106 seats are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. There is significant malapportionment in voter registrations across the single-member districts. A further 93 seats are not directly elected but are filled on a nationwide basis by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. For this allocation voters cast a second ballot indicating their preferred national party. Thresholds for parties to be allocated any of these 93 seats are 5% of the national vote share for single parties, 10% for two-party coalitions, and 15% for coalitions of three or more parties. (However, parties representing specified ethnic minorities (Armenian, Bulgarian, Croatian, German, Greek, Polish, Romani, Romanian, Rusyn, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Ukrainian) face a threshold of only 0.27% of the national vote, and the most successful such party for each ethnicity may send one non-voting spokesperson to the Országgyűlés even if they fail to achieve any allocated ordinary seats.) The actual vote tallies for each party used in the allocation of the 93 seats are the sum of each party’s second-ballot votes together with all votes cast for the party’s candidates in local electoral divisions which were (i) unsuccessful in electing a candidate, or (ii) the number of votes for successful candidates that were above the tally for each division’s second-placed candidate (ie: the margin of victory). This approach, while having some of the effect of a levelling system, does not actually guarantee a high degree of final proportionality of seats to national vote shares. In the three elections held since this system was established (2014, 2018, and 2022) the Fidesz party swept almost all the 106 local electoral division seats, and the final overall seat numbers have not been proportional to national vote shares, with Fidesz securing a total of 64% to 67% of the seats in the Országgyűlés despite national vote shares of 44%, 48% and 52%. Terms are 4 years.\n\nHungary has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional President who is elected by the Országgyűlés. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Miniszterelnök (Minister-President) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Országgyűlés. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nIceland – A unicameral Alþingi or Althing (General Assembly) of which the sole house is an assembly of 63 members. 54 seats are allocated among six electoral divisions, nominally in proportion to population although malapportionment has been increasing in recent elections. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties within each division by a partially open party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. The selection of successful individual candidates within each party’s final allotted number of seats in each division is determined by a partially open list process, with voters’ rankings of candidates are used to alter the candidate order of each party list in a limited manner, using a scoring system based on the Borda count method. A final 9 levelling seats are allocated to parties that win at least 5% of the national vote so as provide that final representation of each such party is as closely proportional as possible to their share of the national vote total. The 9 individual candidates appointed under this rule are drawn from existing divisional candidate lists, based on relative party performance in each division and then using the earlier individual candidate vote scores, such that each of the six electoral divisions provides either 1 or 2 of the additional members. Terms are up to four years. Iceland has very high election participation rates, typically over 85%, even though voting is voluntary.\n\nIceland has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Forseti, a constitutional president who is directly elected. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Forsætisráðherra (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Alþingi. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nIndia – A bicameral Bhārat kī Sansad (Parliament) of which the lower house is the Lok Sabha (House of the People), an assembly of (currently) 545 members. Up to 530 seats are allocated to single member divisions in the 28 Indian states, and up to 20 seats are allocated to single member divisions in the 7 Union Territories. At present there are 543 such divisions in total. In each state or territory some divisions are reserved to elect representatives of legally identified castes and tribes according to India’s ‘reservation’ policy for the advancement of these disadvantaged ethnic and social groups. Members are directly elected to all the divisions by the plurality voting method. Finally, 2 additional members may be nominated by the President of India from among the Anglo-Indian community if the President believes that they are not adequately represented. Terms are up to five years.\n\nIndia has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is directly elected by an assembly consisting of the two houses of Parliament and regional representatives. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Bharat ke Pradhan Mantri (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Lok Sabha. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nIndonesia – A bicameral Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat (People’s Consultative Assembly) of which the lower house is the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (People’s Representative Council, or DPR), an assembly of 575 members. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated in 80 electoral divisions by a partially open party list system of seat allocation, using the Sainte-Laguë formula. Electoral divisions are formed from provinces or from subdivisions of the larger provinces, and are allocated seats in proportion to population. Only parties which win 4% of the total vote nationwide are eligible to be allocated seats in any division. The party list system is ‘open list’ in the sense that voters can mark a preference for an individual candidate, and any candidate who receives more than 30% of the seat quota for their electoral division is moved to the top of the party’s list. Parties are obliged to ensure that at least 30% of the candidates on their lists are female. The voting age is 17, or lower for married individuals. Terms are up to five years.\n\nIndonesia has the premier-presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Presiden (President) subject to a division of responsibilities and powers shared with the Majelis, which is formally independent of the Presiden. The Presiden is directly elected for a five-year term by a modified two-round runoff system. Presidential nominations are restricted to the legislative political parties and nomination rights are based on parties (or combinations of parties) receiving a vote share of 25% at the previous DPR election, or by nomination of at least 20% of the current members of the DPR. Parties must put forward a ticket consisting of a presidential and a vice-presidential candidate from different provinces. If there are 3 or more presidential tickets, to win in the first round a ticket must win 50% of the vote nationally and also at least 20% of the vote in more than half of the provinces of Indonesia. Presidents are limited to 2 terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nIran – The institutions of government in Iran are more numerous and interconnected that the traditional three-branch model in use in most nations. In addition to a president and executive government, a legislature and a judiciary, Iran boasts additional institutions including the Vali-e faghih-e (Guardian Jurist, the effective head of state, known colloquially in English as the Supreme Leader), the Shora-ye Negahban-e Qanun-e Assassi (Guardian Council of the Constitution, responsible for vetting candidates for other public offices), and the Majles-e Khobregane-e Rahbari (Assembly of Experts on the Leadership, responsible for appointing the Vali-e faghih-e every 8 years).\n\nFor a legislature Iran has a unicameral Majlese Ŝourāye Melli (Islamic Consultative Assembly) an assembly of 290 members. The Shora-ye Negahban-e (Guardian Council) has the power to approve all candidates for election to the Majlese (and also the power of approval over all legislation). 285 members are directly elected to the Majlese in 196 electoral divisions which are a mix of single member and multi-member divisions. Single member divisions are filled by the plurality voting method, and multi-member divisions by the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting method. However in each case a minimum of 25% of the votes cast is required for a candidate to be awarded a seat in the first round of voting. In any division where seats remain unfilled under that condition, only a number of lead candidates up to twice the number of available vacancies in the division go forward to a second round of voting, and results there require only a simple plurality. Finally, five seats are reserved for ethnic minorities, including 1 seat for each of Zoroastrians, Jews, Assyrian and Chaldean Christians, Armenian Christians in the north of the country and Armenian Christians in the south of the country. These seats are filled by direct election using the plurality rule, in what are effectively nation-wide polls. Terms are for 4 years.\n\nThe Majles-e Khobregane-e Rahbari, an assembly of around 88 islamic scholars, is also publicly elected every 8 years. Candidacy is limited to islamic jurists and scholars of at least the rank of Ayatollah. The Majles-e Khobregane-e’s primary function is to renew the appointment of the Vali-e faghih-e every 8 years, or to fill the office should it fall vacant.\n\nSubject to the complexities of its unique multi-institutional governance arrangements, Iran may be said to have the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Ra’isjomhur (President) subject to only limited constraints from the legislature. However in practice the Vali-e faghih-eis responsible for major national and foreign policy decisions and for numerous senior government and military appointments. The President is directly elected for a four-year term by the two-round runoff system, and individuals are limited to 2 terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nIraq – A unicameral Majlis an-Nuwwāb (House of Representatives), an assembly of 329 members. The total number of members is determined by a constitutional requirement for one member for each 100,000 citizens of Iraq. 320 of the 329 seats are allocated within each of the 18 electoral divisions based on the governorates of Iraq, in proportion to the number of registered voters in each governorate; Baghdad has 70 seats (to be 69 at the 2018 elections), with the other governorates ranging from 7 to 34 seats (7 to 31 at the 2018 elections). Previously elected by a party list system of seat allocation, at the 2021 elections members were directly elected in 83 electoral districts returning between 3 and 5 members, using the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting method. The final 9 seats are reserved for special election within specified governorates of representatives of specific national minorities, including five for Iraqi Christians and one each for the Yazidi, Shabak, Sabean/Mandaean and Feyli Kurd communities. Terms are four years.\n\nIraq has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional Rỷys (President), who is selected by the Majlis. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Rỷys Alwzrạʾ (Prime Minister), who holds office on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Majlis. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nIsrael – A unicameral ha’kneset, or Knesset (Assembly), an assembly of 120 members. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated on a national basis by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula, to all parties which win 3.25% of the vote nationwide. The composition of the Knesset is therefore closely proportional as between parties, and the party configuration in Israel features many small parties. Individual members are awarded seats from closed party lists. Parties are permitted to sign apparentment agreements, giving them an advantage in seat allocation calculations. Terms are up to four years.\n\nThe electoral system of Israel, like that of the Netherlands, gives representation to a large number of parliamentary parties, may with small numbers of parliamentary members. The system is often cited by political scientists as highlighting an excessive and unwelcome diversity that can result from large-magnitude (in this case, 120-seat) seat allocation electoral systems, leading to frequent threats to – and changes of – government. The highly contested state of politics in Israel has meant that elections occurred twice in 2019, and in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022, all yielding close and unstable overall results regarding government formation.\n\nIsrael has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Nesi HaMedina, a constitutional president who is selected by the Knesset. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Rosh HaMemshala (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Knesset. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nItaly – A bicameral Parlamento of which the lower house is the Camera dei Deputati (Chamber of Deputies), a composite assembly of 400 members, and the equally powerful upper house is the Senato, of 200 members. Over several decades the houses have been elected by a variety of electoral systems combining seat allocation with reinforced majority mechanisms.\n\nFollowing new electoral rules (known as the Rosatellum law) adopted in 2017, 36% of the members of each house is directly elected by plurality voting in single member districts, with the proviso that candidates are only eligible to win if they are members of parties which win at least 1% of the total nationwide vote, and which are also members of coalitions which win 10% of that vote (or are single parties which do so). The remaining 63% seats are not directly elected, but are filled by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. These seats are filled from single national candidate lists based on the nationwide vote share of all parties achieving at least 3% of that vote. Ballots provide for only a single vote, which constitutes both their vote for a national party list as well as a vote for that party’s candidate in the local division.\n\nA final small number of seats are allocated to Italian citizens living abroad, divided into four electoral divisions (zones): Europe (including Russia and Turkey), South America, North and Central America, and Africa/Asia/Oceania/Antarctica – each of which elects a share of the available seats proportional to the number of citizens enrolled in each zone. Where a region has more than one seat, they are allocated proportionally according to votes cast for party lists.\n\nParties may on a national basis form coalitions (joint lists), which will optimise the seat allocations to the coalition members as a whole, with subsequent allocations to each member party being in proportion to their shares of the total coalition vote. Further, in counting votes to determine plurality winners of the single-member districts, the votes for coalition members are pooled, and if such a coalition in aggregate achieves the plurality of votes in the division the candidate with the most votes takes the seat. In any case, coalitions may choose to coordinate nominations so that in any local district, only one candidate appears on the ballot, endorsed by all the coalition members. (More detailed technical information on the electoral system is available from the Camera website here.)\n\nThe Senato is elected by a system essentially the same as that for the Camera, except that the number of seats is exactly half the numbers for the Camera for each of the district-elected, party-list, and overseas categories. The Italian Constitution was amended in 2020 to reduce the size of the chambers of the parliament, the Camera dropping from 630 members to 400, and the Senato from 315 to 200. The numbers of district direct-election seats, party-list-allocated seats, and overseas representatives at the 2022 elections were therefore respectively 147, 245, and 8 in the Camera, and 74, 122, and 4 in the Senato.\n\nWhereas for the Camera all citizens of 18 years of age may vote, in Senato elections only voters aged 25 or older may vote. The Senato shares with the Camera the power to approve or disapprove of a national executive government taking office.\n\nItaly has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional Presidente who is elected by a special joint session of the Parlamento supplemented by regional representatives. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri (President of the Council of Ministers, or prime minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in both the Camera and the Senato.

Voters cast two separate ballots, one for the election of local members and another indicating support for parties to be allocated national seats. 289 members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. There is significant malapportionment in the number of electors registered in these single-member divisions, with a ration of over 2:1 between largest and smallest. A further 176 members are not directly elected but seats are allocated to parties in 11 multi-member electoral divisions by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. Overall representation of parties in the Shūgiin is not made proportional to national vote totals by any formal mechanism. Terms are four years.\n\nJapan has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Tennō (Emperor). However, actual executive power is exercised by the Naikaku-sōridaijin (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Shūgiin. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nJordan – A bicameral Majlis al-Umma (National Assembly) of which the lower house is the Majlis al-Nuwaab (House of Deputies), a composite assembly of 130 members. The first component of the Majlis is 115 members across 23 electoral divisions ranging in size from 3 to 9 seats. Members for these seats are not directly elected but seats are allocated to political parties by the open party list system of seat allocation. Across these divisions, 9 seats are reserved for candidates representing the Christian minority, and 3 seats are reserved for candidates representing the Chechen and Circassian minorities. The second component of the Majlis consists of 15 appointed seats reserved for women, which are filled by the unsuccessful female candidates who contested the electoral divisions who obtained the highest percentage of votes in their divisions, provided that no division obtains more than one such seat. Candidates for these first two components nominate without political party affiliation. Terms are four years.\n\nJordan has the dominant executive system of government, in which executive power is exercised solely by the Mlk (King) subject to only limited constraints from the Majlis. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nKazakhstan – A bicameral Parlamenti of which the lower house is the Mazhilis, a composite assembly of 107 members. 98 seats are allocated to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method, to all parties which win 7% of the total vote nationwide. An additional 9 members are appointed by the Assembly of Kazakhstani Nation. The party configuration in Kazakhstan is extraordinarily one-sided in favour of a coalition of governing parties supporting former long-serving President Nursultan Nazarbayev. In the elections of 2007 the pro-government coalition was officially recorded as winning 88% of the vote and, as no other party passed the 7% threshold, was awarded every seat. In response a rule was adopted that if only one party surpasses the 7% threshold, the party getting the second highest number of votes would be allocated two seats. In the 2012 election the governing party won 83 seats, and two small parties passed the threshold to claim the remaining 15 seats between them. By the elections of 2021 two opposition parties managed to secure 22 seats between them. Terms are five years.\n\nKazakhstan has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised solely by the Prezidenti (President) subject to only limited constraints from the Parlamenti. The Prezidenti is directly elected for a five-year term. There is a nominal limit of two terms, but this limitation does not apply to the founding and current President Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Each of Kenya’s 47 counties is also allocated one seat exclusively for female candidates, who are also directly elected by the plurality method. A further 12 members are nominated by the political parties represented in Parliament (in proportion to their numbers of elected members) to represent special interests, including youth, persons with disabilities, and ‘workers’. Finally the Speaker of Parliament, chosen by the Parliament, is a member ex officio. Terms are five years.\n\nKenya has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised solely by the President subject to only limited constraints from the Assembly. The President is directly elected for a five-year term by the plurality voting method. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nKuwait – a unicameral Majles Al-Ommah (National Assembly), an assembly of up to 65 members. 50 members are directly elected to the Majles in 5 electoral districts, each electing 10 members, by the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting method. The electoral law does not officially recognise political parties at elections and candidates are therefore elected as independents or as members of unofficial voting blocs, although party-like groups form in the Majles following the elections. Terms for these 50 elected members are four years.\n\nAny Majles member who joins the governing ministry – of which at least 1 and no more than 16 may do so – steps aside from their position in the Majles and are not replaced, but individual ministers may return to their former Majles place on ceasing to be a minister.\n\nKuwait is a constitutional monarchy in which executive power rests with the Emir, a hereditary monarch. The emir’s semi-hereditary successor, the crown prince, is not valid until ratified by an absolute majority of the Majles. If the Emir’s nominee is not ratified then he must nominate three candidates from which the Majles choses one to be the crown prince. The Emir appoints the executive government whose ministers are subject to votes of confidence in the Majles (although ex-officio cabinet members of the Majles do not participate in such votes of confidence).

A further 54 seats are not directly elected but seats are allocated in one nation-wide division, using the open party list system of seat allocation, to all political parties which win votes equal to at least 5% of the votes cast, as well as at least 0.5% of the enrolment in each one of the seven oblasts (provinces), including the cities of Bishkek and Osh. The most successful political party is limited to receiving a maximum of 27 of the 54 proportionally allocated seats. Every list must have a minimum of 30% of candidates from each gender, and at least every fourth candidate listed must be from the minority gender on that list. Each list must also show a minimum of 15% of candidates from ethnic minorities, and 15% of candidates under 35 years old. Terms are 5 years.\n\nKyrgyzstan has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLatvia – A unicameral Saeima of which the sole house is an assembly of 100 members. Seats are allocated in proportion to population among 5 electoral divisions, in numbers ranging from 12 to 36 seats. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated within each division by the open party list system of seat allocation using the Sainte-Laguë formula, to parties that win 5% of the total vote nationwide. Preference votes may be cast for individual candidates, each of which is identified by party, with the option of marking each candidate with approval or disapproval; the net vote for each candidate is then calculated as the party list vote plus approval votes minus disapproval votes. The seats allocated to parties are then awarded to individual candidates in order of their net individual votes. Terms are up to four years.[xx]\n\nLatvia has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is selected by the Saeima. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Ministru prezidents (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Saeima. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLebanon – A unicameral Assemblée nationale or Majlis an-Nuwwab (Chamber of Deputies) (Arabic), of which the sole house is an assembly of 128 members.\n\nFrom 1960 to 2009 Assemblée elections were conducted under a unique electoral system based on allocations of seats to ethnic and religions communities.\n\nFollowing reforms adopted in late 2017, following a delay of 9 years since the previous election in 2009, a new Assemblée electoral system was used in the elections of 2018, and again for elections in 2022. Under the reforms, the nation is divided into 15 electoral divisions, to each of which are allocated between 5 and 13 seats in proportion to population. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to political parties within each division by the closed party list system of seat allocation. However the complex diversity of ‘religious confessional’ and ethnic groups within the nation resulted in over 60 party lists being nominated in the elections of 2022, mostly grouped into 6 broad coalitions. Terms are up to four years.\n\nLebanon has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional president who is elected by the Assemblée. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Assemblée. According to the National Pact of 1943, certain high political offices are also conventionally reserved for candidates of specified religions confession: for example, only a Maronite Christian holds the office of President, and only a Sunni Muslim holds the office of Prime Minister. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLesotho – a bicameral Parliament of which the lower house is the National Assembly, a composite assembly of 120 members. Voters cast separate ballots for two components of the assembly, a local division representative and a national preferred party. 80 members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. The remaining 40 members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties in a single national pool by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method, to form a levelling system which takes the single member division seats won by parties into account. No seats are allocated to parties that win more local division seats than their national proportional share would indicate. Terms are 5 years.\n\nLesotho is a constitutional monarchy in which executive power is nominally held by the King but in practice the system of one of representative parliamentary, in which power is exercised by a Prime Minister who holds office with the confidence of the National Assembly. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLiberia – a bicameral Legislature, of which the lower house is the House of Representatives, an assembly of 73 members. Members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. Divisions are allocated in proportion to population among the 15 counties of Liberia, but each county is guaranteed a minimum of two electoral divisions, resulting in a degree of malapportionment. Terms are 6 years.\n\nLiberia has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected for a six-year term by the two-round runoff method. A president is limited to two terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLibya – Following the revolution of 2011 and the establishment of new institutions of government in 2012, Libya had a unicameral al-Mu’tamar al-Waṭanī al-‘āmm (Arabic), Agraw Aghelnaw Amatu (Berber) or General National Congress.\n\nThe Congress was a composite assembly of 200 members, first formed at the 2012 elections. 120 members were directly elected in local divisions of 1 or 2 members (based roughly on population) by the plurality voting method (for single-member divisions) or the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting method (for two-member divisions). These members were required to nominate as independent of political parties. A further 80 seats were filled in 12 larger regional divisions, variously allocated between 3 and 16 members in proportion to their populations, by the closed party list system of seat allocation.[xxi]\n\nThe Congress subsequently organized new elections in June 2014. At these elections the new Majlis al-Nuwaab (Council of Deputies or House of Representatives) was elected to replace the Congress. The Majlis was also a composite assembly of 200 members. 120 members were directly elected, comprising 40 members elected in single-member electoral divisions by the plurality vote method and 80 members elected in 29 multi-member electoral divisions by the single non-transferable vote method. Separately, a further 80 seats were filled through a party list system of seat allocation. Turnout at the election was just 18%, down from 60% at the election of July 2012, and due to security issues no voting took place in some locations.\n\nThe Majlis began its operation in August 2014, but due to civil war it was forced to relocate to Tobruk and became unable to operate in a normal manner. In November 2014 the Libyan Supreme Court ruled that the June 2014 elections were unconstitutional and that the Majlis should be dissolved whilst it was being menaced by armed militias. The Majlis rejected the ruling. A minority of members of the General National Congress elected in 2012 claimed that the Congress was not correctly abolished and continues to exist, but this did not in any practical sense eventuate, nor was the proposal internationally recognized.\n\nA UN-brokered attempt to reconcile the competing chambers broke down in January 2016. Electoral democracy has not been restored to Libya since these events, although local elections were held in 2019.\n\nLibya nominally has a form of the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Rỷys (President) who is the Chairman of the Al-Mu’tamar ex officio. However, actual executive power is exercised by a Rỷys Alwzrạʾ (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Al-Mu’tamar. Conditions in Libya from 2014 onward have not allowed the normal exercise of executive authority over the nation. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLiechtenstein – a unicameral Landtag, an assembly of 25 members. The small nation is divided into two electoral divisions, Oberland and Unterland, which are allotted 15 and 10 seats respectively. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated to parties by the open party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. On their ballots, votes choose a party list, but also indicate preferences for up to as many individual candidates as there are seats available in their electoral division. A specific candidate can only be given 1 vote. For each voter, the preference votes cast for individual candidates are aggregated to constitute the total votes for each party, with any shortfall in marking of individual candidates (against the total possible of 15 or 10 votes) counted as votes generally for the party chosen by the voter as their ‘list’ party. Each voter therefore in effect casts 15 (or 10) votes for various parties, and the aggregate of all such votes is used to determine the overall party vote total within each district, when is then used for calculating the party-proportional seat allocation. Candidates within each party are then allocated seats in order of their individual preference vote totals. Unlike other party list electoral systems, the order in which candidates are listed by their parties on the ballot is therefore of no relevance in determining which candidates take seats. Parties must achieve 8% of the total national vote (across both divisions) to be eligible to be allocated seats in either division. Terms are 4 years.\n\nLiechtenstein has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which executive power is vested in the hereditary Fürst (Sovereign Prince) (although it is currently delegated to his son the Stellvertreter des Fürsten or Regent), but in practice exercised by the Regierungschef (Head of Government, or Prime Minister) who holds office with the confidence of the Landtag. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLithuania – A unicameral Seimas of which the sole house is a composite assembly of 141 members. Seats are awarded through two separated processes, based on elections held on separate days. 71 members are directly elected in single member divisions by the two-round runoff method. Seats may be won in the initial round of voting by a candidate who wins at least 50% the votes cast, provided turnout was at least 40% of registered voters and the winner’s vote amounts to at least 20% of registered voters. If no such winner emerges in the initial round, seats are filled at a second round contested by the two highest-placed first-round candidates, decided by simple plurality, and without any turnout limit. At a separate election, held a fortnight after the initial round of voting for local divisions, 70 seats are allocated by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method, to political parties that win 5% of the total vote nationwide, or to multi-party alliance lists that win 7%. This second election is only valid if turnout exceeds 25% of registered voters. Terms are up to four years.[xxii]\n\nLithuania has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional Prezidentas who is directly elected. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Ministras Pirmininkas (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Seimas. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nLuxembourg – A unicameral D’Chamber, (Luxembourgish) (also Chambre des Députés (French) and Abgeordnetenkammer (German)), an assembly of 60 members. Seats are allocated in proportion to population among 4 electoral divisions based on the boundaries of the Cantons of Luxembourg (with seat numbers currently ranging from 7 to 23). Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated within each division by a variant form of the open party list system of seat allocation. The system used involves the panachage technique of voting for individual candidates within a party list system. Voters may cast a simple vote for one party’s list, or alternatively they may record a number of individual votes (called ‘preferences’) for individual candidates, up to the number seats available in each division. A list vote is taken to be worth a number of votes for the party equal to the number of seats available. The totals of all votes for candidates from each party is used to calculate the number of seats allocated to each party, using the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota. The ranking of candidates in order of their total personal votes is then used to allocate each party’s seats to individual candidates. There is no vote threshold for parties to be eligible to win seats. Terms are up to five years.[xxiii]\n\nLuxembourg has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the hereditary Grand Duke. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Premier Ministre (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in D’Chamber. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMadagascar – a bicameral Parlement of which the lower house is the Assemblée Nationale or Antenimieram-Pirenena (National Assembly), a composite assembly of 151 members. 87 members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method, and a further 64 members are elected in 32 two-member districts by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the D’Hondt divisor formula. Terms are 5 years. Madagascar has a very high rate of voting for non-registered-party and independent candidates, ihich collectively achieved 57% of the vote at the 2019 elections; however the relatively dominant Isika Rehetra Miaraka amin’i Andry Rajoelina party, despite winning only 30.9% of the vote, secured 84 of the 151 seats.\n\nMadagascar has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMalawi – a unicameral National Assembly, an assembly of 193 members. Members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. Terms are 5 years.\n\nMalawi has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the plurality method. A president is limited to two consecutive terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMalaysia – A bicameral Parliament of which the lower house is the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives), an assembly of 222 members. All members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. Division boundaries are redrawn by an Election Commission every ten years based on the population (using the latest census). The divisional boundaries, most recently revised in 2018, show a significant malapportionment with rural divisions, and divisions in the states of Sarawak and Sabah, having significantly lower enrolments than average. Terms are up to five years.\n\nMalaysia has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a head of state elected by – and rotated between – nine Malaysian provincial royal dynasties. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Dewan Rakyat. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMaldives – a unicameral Rayyithunge Majilis (People’s Majlis), an assembly of 85 members. Members are directly elected in two-member divisions for each atoll and the capital town of Male’ by the single non-transferable vote (SNTV) voting method. The President appoints an additional 8 members to the Majlis. Terms are 5 years.\n\nThe Maldives has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. A president is limited to two terms of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMali – A unicameral Assemblée Nationale of which the sole house is an assembly of 147 members. Members are directly elected in a mix of single-member and multi-member divisions, the latter having up to four members. Divisions are allocated as one seat for every 60,000 residents and an additional if the remainder of that population exceeds 40,000. In single member divisions members are elected by the two-round runoff method. In multi-member divisions members are elected by a party block voting method, in which voters select between lists for each party combined with the two-round runoff technique (that is, if no party list secures a majority in the first round of voting, the two most successful lists contest a second round). Two or more parties, as well as multiple independent candidates, are permitted to nominate a joint list of candidates within each multi-member division. Terms are five years. Turnout in Mali is very low, typically at 35% or below.\n\nMali has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the Presidente (President) subject to only limited constraints from the Assemblée. The President is directly elected for a five-year term by the two-round runoff system. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMalta – A unicameral Parlament of which the sole house is the Kamra tad-Deputati, an assembly of at least 65 members. 65 members are directly elected in 13 electoral divisions each of five members by the single transferable vote (STV) voting method. Unusually for STV systems, candidates may nominate in two electoral divisions, and if they win in both they withdraw from one victory, resulting in a by-election which, conventionally, is only contested by the relevant party’s unsuccessful candidates for that division.\n\nIn elections where only two parties win seats in the Kamer, a unique levelling mechanism is applied to ensure that final seat shares are proportional to nationwide vote share. Under this mechanism, a party which wins a plurality of votes nationally but does not achieve a majority of seats, that party is allotted additional members in the Kamra sufficient to give it a parliamentary majority of one seat, with the additional winning candidates being chosen from the party’s highest-polling candidates not already awarded a seat. For example, at the 2008 elections the Partit Nazzjonalista (PN) won the majority of votes – 49.3% – but only won 31 seats, while the Partit Laburista, with 48.8% of the votes, won 34 seats. The PN party was therefore awarded 4 additional members so as to have a 35:34 majority, bringing the total membership of the Kamra to 69 members. Conversely, the levelling rules also guarantee that the proportion of seats won by a minority party will match the proportion of primary votes won by its candidates nationally. For example in the 2013 elections the PN party had its number of members increased by 4 supplementary members, bringing the total size of the Kamer to 69, and at the 2017 election the PN will be awarded 1 supplementary member under the same rule. In 2022, 2 bonus seats were awarded to the Nationalist party, which was the minority party, to restore such proportionality.\n\nRecently adopted (from the 2022 elections) rules requiring gender parity also provide for additional seats to be created for women, and at the 2022 election an additional 12 members were appointed (6 each for the two dominant parties), bringing the size of the Kamer to 79 members.\n\nFinally, a Speaker may be appointed by the Kamer from outside the elected members, in which case that officer becomes an additional member of the Kamer.\n\nTerms are up to five years. In elections from 1960 to 1995 Malta had the second highest voter turnout in the world (and the highest for nations without compulsory voting). The 2022 election saw a turnout of only 85%, very low by Maltese standards.\n\nMalta has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a constitutional President who is elected by the Kamra. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Prim Ministru (Prime Minister) on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the Kamra. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMauritania – a bicameral Barlamane (Parlement (Fr), Parliament) of which the lower house is the Al Jamiya al-Wataniyah (Assemblée Nationale, National Assembly), a composite assembly of 157 members. 113 members are directly elected in a mix of single- and multi-member electoral divisions. In single member divisions members are elected by the two-round runoff method. In two-member divisions, parties nominate a list pair of candidates which must contain one man and one woman; one parties list will won both seats either by winning 50% of the vote in the first round, or by winning a runoff round. Divisions allocated 3 or more seats are filled by the closed party list system of seat allocation, with party lists obliged to show alternating male and female candidates. A further 40 seats are also allocated to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation; lists for these seats must again present candidates alternating by gender. A final 4 seats are elected by citizens living abroad. The current party system in Mauritania features a single dominant party. Terms are 5 years.\n\nMauritania has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised by the President, who is directly elected by the two-round runoff method. The most recent elections in 2014 were boycotted by most opposition parties. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMauritius – A unicameral National Assembly of which the sole house is an assembly of up to 70 members. The nation is divided into 21 electoral divisions (‘constituencies’), 20 of which elect 3 members to the National Assembly, with the last division (the separate island of Rodrigues) electing 2 members. These 62 members are directly elected in their divisions by the block voting method, with voters being able to cast up to 3 votes (2 in the Rodrigues division). There is significant malapportionment in the numbers of registered voters in each electoral division. A further number of unsuccessful constituency candidates are subsequently added to the National Assembly after each general election under a system known as ‘best loser’, which is a hybrid of a supplementary appointment system and a ‘levelling’ system. In this system, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to a maximum of 8 additional members with a view to address any under-representation of the Hindu, Muslim, and Sino-Mauritian ethnic communities in the Assembly. Nominations will be drawn from unsuccessful candidates with the highest votes, provided they meet the community identity criteria. The party identity of these nominees must be such that these nominations as a whole do not to affect the party political balance generated among the 62 directly elected members. Terms are five years.\n\nMauritius has the plurality parliamentary system of government, in which nominal executive authority is vested in a President elected by the National Assembly. However, actual executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister on the basis of the continuing confidence of a majority in the National Assembly. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMexico – A bicameral Congreso General of which the lower house is the Cámara de Diputados, a composite assembly of 500 members. 300 members are directly elected in single member divisions by the plurality voting method. An additional 200 seats are allocated in 5 regional divisions of 40 seats each, by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method, to all parties that achieve at least 2% of the national vote. To be eligible for additional allocated seats in the larger regions, a party must nominate candidates in at least 200 of the 300 electoral districts. In addition, parties are obliged to ensure that at least 50% of their candidates are female. If a party’s nominees in the 300 single-member districts do not meet that criterion, the difference can be made up on their lists for the 200 allocated seats.\n\nThe seat allocation component of the Cámara de Diputados is also subject to two unusual mathematical provisos. Firstly, the majority party’s regional seat allocations are limited so that when added to its district seats won, the party’s seat total does not exceed 300 of the total of 500 seats (this limit being raised to 315 seats for a party which wins 60% of the vote). Secondly, the seat allocation to any party is limited so that the total of district and additional seats for each party does not exceed the proportion out of 500 that it would have won had the party received a vote share 8% higher than it did, and all 500 seats had been allocated proportionally. The second proviso does not operate to reduce seat wins for a party which has exceeded the target in the second proviso through an unusually large number of local district wins. The Cámara electoral system is a hybrid form of the ‘parallel‘ composite electoral system, but with a national seat-proportionality levelling mechanism which leads analysts such as IDEA to classify it as similar to mixed-member proportional (MMP) systems.\n\nTerms are three years. At previous elections and for the July 2018 election sitting deputies were barred from nominating for re-election at the end of serving a three-year term (but could run again at subsequent elections). However that law has been repealed with effect from the Cámara chosen in 2018.\n\nMexico has the presidential system of government, in which executive power is exercised solely by the Presidente subject to only limited constraints from the legislature. The Presidente is directly elected for a six-year term by the plurality system, and individuals are limited to a single term of office. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMoldova – a unicameral Parlamentul, an assembly of 101 members. Members are not directly elected, but seats are allocated in a single national pool to parties by the closed party list system of seat allocation, using the simple quota and the largest remainder method. There are thresholds for eligibility for lists to be allocated seats: 7% for coalitions of two or more parties, 5% for a single party or other contesting entity, and 2% for an individual independent candidate. Terms are 4 years.\n\nMoldova has the representative parliamentary system of government, in which executive power is nominally held by the President, who is selected by the Parlamentul, but is in practice exercised by the Prime Minister on the basis of confidence in the Parlamentul. (Last updated January 2023.)\n\nMonaco – A unicameral Conseil National, a composite assembly of 24 members. . First, 16 members are directly elected by a form of multiple non-transferable vote (MNTV) voting. Second, the remaining 8 seats are allocated to political parties in proportion to party vote shares. Voting for both parts of the Conseil occurs through a single ballot paper, on which voters may record individual votes for up to 24 candidates. Parties will generally nominate 24 candidates. Each voter uses a pre-prepared ballot paper consisting of a list of the 24 candidates nominated by one party, but may delete names and also add names of candidates from other parties (the practice known as panachage), finishing with 24 or fewer names as they wish. The vote totals of each candidate are then "
