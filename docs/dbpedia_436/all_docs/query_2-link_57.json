        "text": "The San Marino Drive Green Streets and Trash Capture Project will install biofiltration areas and a sub-surface trash capture device along San Marino Drive. The purpose of these features is to reduce pollutant discharge to nearby Lake San Marcos.\n\nAlso included in the project is approximately 500 linear feet of new sidewalk along San Marino Drive, along with new pedestrian access ramps. Minor drainage improvements are also proposed between Calle del Arroyo and Hermosita Drive to improve storm drain capacity.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nDuring construction, the County will make every effort to minimize disruptions in the area. There will be temporary impacts to utilities, and to both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Traffic control measures, including signage placed prior to and during construction, will be implemented to ensure the safety of our customers.\n\nIt is estimated that construction of the project will begin in Summer 2023 and be completed in Winter 2024. Please note that construction dates are subject to change due to compliance requirements, inclement weather, and/or other unforeseen circumstances."
