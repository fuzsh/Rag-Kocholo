        "text": "San Marino elects on the national level a legislature. The Grand and General Council (Consiglio Grande e Generale) has 60 members, elected for a five-year term by semi-proportional representation with national majority bonus (the winning coalition receives at least 35 seats on 60).\n\nSan Marino has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.\n\nThe first elections were held in March 1906 after the Arengo held on the same year that established democracy in the country. Between 1926 and 1943, the Sammarinese Fascist Party took power and all other parties were banned. Democracy was restored in 1945.\n\nSince early 2008, there has been an electoral threshold of 3.5%. Since 2016, if none of the coalitions achieves an absolute majority of seats, a runoff between the two largest coalitions is held.\n\nMain article: 2019 Sammarinese general election\n\nA parliamentary election was held in San Marino on 8 December 2019.\n\nParty or allianceVotes%Seats+/–Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party5,99333.3521+11Tomorrow in MotionRETE Movement3,27618.2311+3Domani Motus Liberi1,1126.194NewCoalition votes570.320–Total4,44524.7315+3Libera San Marino2,96416.4910–14We for the Republic2,35913.138+2Future Republic1,85010.296–5Elego3612.010NewTotal17,972100.00600Valid votes17,97293.44Invalid/blank votes1,2626.56Total votes19,234100.00Registered voters/turnout34,51155.73Source: State Secretariat for Internal Affairs and Public Function\n\nSummary of Sammarinese elections for the Grand and General Council, 1945–2016 Election Round PSDS PCS PSS PDCS PSIS MLS SR AP SU AN PSD PS UPR C10 RETE RF DML NplR Libera Oth.
