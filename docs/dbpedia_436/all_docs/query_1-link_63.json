        "text": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A proposal to install new leadership in Haiti appeared to be crumbling Wednesday as some political parties rejected the plan to create a presidential council that would manage the transition.\n\nThe panel would be responsible for selecting an interim prime minister and a council of ministers that would attempt to chart a new path for the Caribbean country that has been overrun by gangs. The violence has closed schools and businesses and disrupted daily life across Haiti.\n\nMoïse Jean-Charles, an ex-senator and presidential candidate who has teamed up with former rebel leader Guy Philippe, told Radio Télé Métronome that he would not participate, according to the station.\n\nWATCH: Widespread gang violence in Haiti continues, bolstered by weapons trafficked from the U.S.\n\nJean-Charles did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Philippe, who helped lead a successful revolt in 2004 against former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and was recently released from a U.S. prison after pleading guilty to money laundering, said no Haitian should accept any proposal from the international community.\n\nIn a video posted Tuesday on social media, Philippe accused the community of being complicit with Haiti’s elite and corrupt politicians and urged Haitians to take to the streets.\n\n“The decision of Caricom is not our decision,” he said, referring to the regional trade bloc whose leaders presented the plan to create a transitional council. “Haitians will decide who will govern Haiti.”\n\nOther high-profile Haitian politicians declined to participate in the proposed transitional council. Among them were Himmler Rébu, former colonel of Haiti’s army and president of the Grand Rally for the Evolution of Haiti, a party that is part of a coalition awarded a spot on the transitional council.\n\nHe said in a statement that the party prefers that a judge from Haiti’s Supreme Court assume the reins of power.\n\nRébu added that the party is “ashamed and angry” upon seeing “the search for positions of power that do not take into account the responsibilities attached to them.”\n\nCaribbean leaders who announced the plan for the transitional council did not respond to messages for comment.\n\nWATCH: Gangs edge Haiti to brink of collapse as regional leaders seek solutions\n\nThe plan emerged late Monday following an urgent meeting involving Caribbean leaders, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others who were searching for a solution to halt Haiti’s crisis of violence.\n\nHours after the meeting, Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced Tuesday that he would resign once the council was in place, saying that his government “cannot remain insensitive to this situation.”\n\nHenry remains locked out of Haiti because gang attacks have shuttered the country’s airports. He is currently in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe gang attacks began Feb. 29, when Henry was in Kenya to push for the U.N.-backed deployment of a Kenyan police force. The deployment has been temporarily suspended.\n\n“My concern is that the longer there is a power vacuum and an effort to figure out a way forward on the political side, every day that delays resolutions, many, many people are dying,” said William O’Neill, the U.N.’s independent expert on human rights in Haiti.\n\nArmed men in the capital of Port-au-Prince have set fire to police stations and stormed the country’s two biggest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates. Among those who fled are gang leaders of at least seven communities, according to a new report by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, known as BINUH.\n\nAs of March 10, gunmen attacked, looted or torched at least 30 state institutions, more than 600 homes and private businesses and nearly 500 public and private vehicles, BINUH said.\n\nGangs also have attacked neighborhoods in a rampage that has left scores dead and more than 15,000 homeless. More than 130 people were killed between Feb. 27 and March 8. Meanwhile, at least 40 gang members were killed between Feb. 29 and March 10, according to BINUH.\n\n“This is absolutely catastrophic,” O’Neill said. “I describe Port-au-Prince now as an open-air prison. There is no way to get out: land, air or sea. The airport is still not functioning.”\n\nBy Tuesday, the attacks were subsiding, with some businesses and banks reopening, although schools and gas stations remained closed. Public transportation restarted, and more Haitians could be seen Wednesday going about their business.\n\nWhile some activity has resumed, many people are still concerned that gangs might resume their attacks.\n\nCaricom gave the organizations that were offered positions on the council until Wednesday to submit the names of people who would represent them. As of midday Wednesday, no list had been submitted.\n\nThe nine-member council has seven positions with voting powers.\n\nVotes were offered to Pitit Desalin, Jean-Charles’ party; EDE/RED, a party led by former Prime Minister Claude Joseph; the Montana Accord, a group of civil society leaders, political parties and others; Fanmi Lavalas, Aristide’s party; the Jan. 30 Collective, which represents parties including that of former President Michel Martelly; the Dec. 21 Agreement, a group that backed Henry; and members of the private sector.\n\nThe remaining two nonvoting positions would go to a member from Haiti’s civil society and its religious sector.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who be awarded a position on the council if it was rejected by certain political parties.\n\nCoto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico."
