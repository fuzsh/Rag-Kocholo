        "text": "Early mail-in voting (formerly known as absentee voting) is available, and no excuse is required. The last day to request an absentee ballot is the second Friday before the election (unless that date is a state holiday, in which case the deadline is the following Monday). You can return your absentee ballot request form through the mail or in person. Voted ballots must be received by Election Day in order to be counted. You can sign up to track your absentee ballot on your Secretary of State website. Absentee ballots begin being counted on Election Day. Contact your local elections office for more information.\n\nRequesting and Returning an Early-Vote (absentee) Ballot\n\nYou can apply for an early voting (formerly known as absentee) ballot by contacting your county clerk in person, by personal agent, by mail or by fax. You can print the early voting application request form from your state's website. To apply for early voting, you should complete the form and then mail or fax it to your county clerk.\n\nYou may also send in a hand-written request. You can obtain an early voting ballot by writing to your county clerk or election commissioner with the following information:\n\nYour name and residence address\n\nYour political party affiliation\n\nYour voting precinct (if known)\n\nYour phone number\n\nThe mailing address you want the ballots sent to\n\nYour signature\n\nNOTE: Beginning April 2024, voters will be required to provide their Nebraska driversâ€™ license or state ID number when requesting and returning a ballot by mail. Alternatively, voters could include a photocopy of their qualifying ID.\n\nAll county election offices will accept early voting applications up to 120 days prior to a statewide election. However, regular early voting ballots are not sent out or voted until 35 days before the election. The last day to request an early voting ballot to be mailed is the second Friday before the election. All early voting ballots whether personally delivered, delivered by agent or delivered by mail or other carriers must arrive by the closing of the polls on Election Day: 8:00 pm central time and 7:00 pm mountain time.\n\nThose who requested an absentee ballot but end up voting in person:\n\nYou may only do so by a provisional ballot. Do not mail a ballot and vote in person. For specifics, you can find your local county clerk contact info here.\n\nOverseas citizens and U.S. military personnel can find information on how to register to vote and request an absentee ballot at the Overseas Vote Foundation.\n\nRequest your Ballot\n\nTo be eligible to vote in Nebraska, you must be:\n\nA United States citizen\n\nAt least 18 years old on Election Day\n\nA resident of Nebraska on or before registration deadline\n\nNot a convicted felon; or if convicted your civil rights have been restored at least two years since your sentence has been completed, including probation or parole\n\nNot have been officially found to be mentally incompetent\n\nRegistered to vote\n\nNote: If you recently moved to Nebraska, or moved to another state after the registration deadline, you may only vote a Presidential ballot. By law, your residence is that place at which you have established a home, where you are habitually present, and to which, when you depart, you intend to return. Leaving for temporary purposes, such as military service or school attendance, need not result in a change of residence for voting purposes. However, any permanent change in your residence or address will require you to re-register to vote.\n\nIncarcerated Voters & Returning Citizens:\n\nIn Nebraska, you temporarily lose the right to vote if you are convicted of a state or federal felony. Your right to vote is automatically restored two years after you complete your sentence, including parole, or probation. Pretrial detention and misdemeanors do not restrict your voting rights.\n\nNote: Beginning on July 18th, a new rule will be implemented that removes the two-year waiting period for the restoration of voting rights after completing a sentence for a felony conviction. Voting rights will be restored immediately upon finishing the sentence, including any parole term.\n\nVoters without traditional residence:\n\nIt is not mandatory for citizens to possess a \"permanent home\" for voter registration. A citizen can provide an alternative description of their residence, even if they are experiencing homelessness, as long as it enables the authorities to identify and assign a voting precinct to them. This precinct assignment ensures that the voter receives the appropriate ballot. The mailing address on their registration form can be a PO box, local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or the home of someone who will accept mail for them.\n\nThe first Nebraska election requiring voter ID will be the May 14, 2024, statewide primary election.\n\nAll special and statewide elections after this date will require voter ID.\n\nNo special election prior to May 14, 2024, will require voter ID.\n\nAcceptable IDs must have your name and photo. Valid photo IDs include:\n\nNebraska driver's license/state ID\n\nU.S. passport\n\nMilitary ID\n\nTribal ID\n\nHospital, assisted-living facility, or nursing home record\n\nNebraska political subdivision ID (state, county, city, school, etc.)\n\nNebraska college or university ID\n\nExpired documents will be accepted. You can get a free state ID for voting from the DMV. If you were born in Nebraska and need your birth certificate to get a free state ID, you can get a free certified copy of your birth certificate from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Note: A birth certificate is not a valid form of photo ID.\n\nIf you do not present an acceptable photo ID at the polls, you will be required to vote a provisional ballot. You must present a photo ID to your local election officials no later than the Tuesday following Election Day or sign a reasonable impediment certification for your vote to be counted.\n\nReasonable impediments include illness or disability, lack of documents required to obtain a photo ID, or a religious objection to being photographed.\n\nVoters can call or text 844-338-8743 at any time to reach VoteRiders Voter ID Helpline.\n\nThe voting systems used in Nebraska are optical scan and DRE.\n\nOptical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes.\n\nDirect Recording Electronic (DRE): This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen.\n\nThere are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.\n\nSome of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.\n\nYou let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.\n\nYou can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC)"
