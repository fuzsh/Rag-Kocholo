Check out the election calendar for upcoming elections. Your specific local district(s) may not have an election if there are no contested races or measures up for election.\n\nThere are three different types of elections Idahoans can participate in — general, primary, and consolidated or district elections. Elections recur on a cycle.\n\nPolls are open on Election Day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nGeneral Elections are held in even-numbered years on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November and are open to all registered voters regardless of party affiliation.\n\nSuccessful party candidates from the Primary Election appear on the ballot along with statewide constitutional amendments, initiatives, referendums, and some taxing district elections.\n\nParty Primary Elections to select party candidates for federal, state, and county offices are held in even-numbered years on the third Tuesday in May. Those candidates who receive the most votes during the primary election go on to run in the general election.\n\nYour party choice can affect which primary election races you are eligible to vote in.\n\nIn Idaho, each political party chooses which voters may participate in the primary election for that party. Your party choice can affect which primary election races you are eligible to vote on. Learn more about political party affiliation in Idaho.\n\nAny voter may choose to vote on a non-partisan ballot, which includes ballot measure questions and judicial positions."
