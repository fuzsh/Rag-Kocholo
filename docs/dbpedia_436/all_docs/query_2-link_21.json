Each organism is composed of a restricted number of Councilors (fifteen members nominated in proportional representation between the Council Groups and the lists represented in the Council).\n\nThe same Councilor can be a member of one or more Commissions; while the Secretaries of State cannot. The duty of the Council Commissions is to examine government bills, as well as to express opinions on the work of other commissions, since each has different duties.\n\nThe Commissions last a legislature; namely, five years; a president and a vice-president are elected in each Commission; the sessions are open to the public except in rare cases."
