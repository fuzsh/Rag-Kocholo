        "text": "Parliament of San Marino\n\nThe Grand and General Council (Italian: Consiglio Grande e Generale) is the parliament of San Marino. The council has 60 members elected for a five-year term.\n\nFrom the fifth century San Marino was ruled by an assembly composed by all the family heads known as the Arengo. However, as population grew, such a body became more and more dysfunctional, with its functioning being crippled by feuds between families.\n\nWhile the exact timing is unknown, there is historical evidence that by the early 13th century the citizens of San Marino elected an assembly called Council of the LX, which was also known as the Grand and General Council. In this first stage the power was shared between the Arengo and the Council, with the latter gaining more and more power over the centuries.[1] This process culminated in the 1600 statutes which defined the Council as the \"supreme, absolute and only prince\"[1] of the community, attributing to it \"the right over life, death and goods of every citizen\"[citation needed] together with every power needed to rule and manage the country. Until the 17th century, members of the Council were periodically elected by the Arengo, then the 1600 Statutes established that the Council could autonomously nominate its members by co-optation. This led to an increasing concentration of power in the hand of the richest families, which were also the only ones that could afford to pay for the necessary education. The oligarchic nature of the council became even clearer when, between the 17th and 18th centuries, laws were passed to formally establish a noble class with 20 seats reserved to it.\n\nThis situation ended on 25 March 1906 when the Arengo was summoned once again after centuries and in which householders were asked whether the system of co-option of councillors for life should continue. The proposal was rejected by 90.65% of voters, consequently, the country's first modern election was conducted on June 10, 1906.\n\nDuring the fascism period, between 1923 and 1943, the Grand and General Council was dissolved and a new legislature called the Prince and Sovereign Council (Italian: Consiglio Principe e Sovrano) was formed, with all its 60 members belonging to the Sammarinese Fascist Party.\n\nSuffrage was extended to women in 1959, granting to them the possibility to vote for the first time in the 1964 elections.\n\nThe country's electoral law is based on the electoral system of Italian municipalities. Between 1945 and 2007, San Marino used proportional representation. A majority of at least 35 seats is given to the winning coalition of parties which receives an absolute majority of votes at the first or the eventual second round of elections. Within single coalitions, seats are divided between the parties using a D'Hondt system. A 3.5% threshold exists, together with guarantees for female candidates.\n\nThe Council appoints from among its members the Congress of State, which is the executive branch of the government, and the Captains Regents, who serve as the heads of state.\n\nMain article: 2019 Sammarinese general election\n\nIn the 2019 election, two electoral alliances were formed:[2]\n\nLibera, an alliance of the Democratic Socialist Left, Civic 10 and Socialist Ideals Movement and Reforms and Development\n\nNoi per la Repubblica, an alliance of the Socialist Party, Party of Socialists and Democrats, Democratic Movement San Marino Together and We Sammarineses\n\nCoalition Party Votes % Seats +/– Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party 5,993 33.35 21 +11 Tomorrow in Motion RETE Movement 3,276 18.23 11 +3 Domani Motus Liberi 1,112 6.19 4 New Direct coalition votes 57 0.32 0 – Total 4,445 24.73 15 – Libera 2,964 16.49 10 –14 Noi per la Repubblica 2,359 13.13 8 +2 Future Republic 1,850 10.29 6 –5 Ēlego 361 2.01 0 New Invalid/blank votes 1,262 – – – Total 19,234 100 60 0 Registered voters/turnout 34,511 55.73 – – Source: State Secretariat for Internal Affairs and Public Function\n\nPolitics of San Marino\n\nArengo\n\nList of legislatures by country"
