The following parties are recognized in New York State:\n\nDemocratic\n\nRepublican\n\nConservative\n\nWorking Families\n\nOnly voters registered with a party may vote to nominate that party's candidate in a Primary Election.\n\nIf you would like to register without designating a party, simply mark the space indicating \"I do not wish to enroll in a party.\"\n\nChange of Party Enrollment\n\nThe voter registration form should be used to change your party enrollment from one party to another or to enroll for the first time in a party. A change of enrollment received up until February 14th each year will be effective immediately. Changes received on or after February 15th until seven days after the June Primary will be set aside and opened the seventh day following the June Primary and entered in the voter's registration record.\n\nPlease see the Deadlines referenced on the New York State Elections site.\n\nImportant Deadline\n\nFebruary 14 is the statutory deadline for a Board of Elections to receive from the DMV a voter’s request to change their party enrollment for this year’s primaries. Therefore, any change of a party enrollment via this DMV site must be done by February 13 in order to be effective for this year's primary elections. You may still hand-deliver a party enrollment change directly to your local Board of Elections on February 14.\n\nDownload English Application\n\nDownload Spanish Application\n\nDownload Chinese Application\n\nDownload Korean Application"
