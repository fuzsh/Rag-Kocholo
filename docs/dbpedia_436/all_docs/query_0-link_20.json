        "text": "2024 is not just an election year. It’s perhaps the election year.\n\nGlobally, more voters than ever in history will head to the polls as at least 64 countries (plus the European Union)—representing a combined population of about 49% of the people in the world—are meant to hold national elections, the results of which, for many, will prove consequential for years to come.\n\n[This story has not been updated. For a newer version published mid-year, click here.]\n\nIn Taiwan, for example, who becomes the next president will fundamentally shape Beijing’s approach to the self-governed island it has repeatedly threatened with invasion.\n\nRead More: Taiwan’s Presidential Frontrunner Faces Balancing Act With China\n\nOf course, simply holding an election does not mean the process will be free or fair. Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appears set to win a fourth consecutive term in January, though the election is being boycotted by the country’s main opposition party in protest of a monthslong crackdown on political dissent.\n\nRead More: Sheikh Hasina and the Future of Democracy in Bangladesh\n\nSimilarly, in Pakistan, the country’s most popular politician, former Prime Minister Imran Khan, sits in jail, while his party has been suppressed and his supporters arrested in the run-up to February’s election.\n\nRead More: Imran Khan on His Plan to Return to Power\n\nElections with all-but-certain outcomes can still be worth watching. While Vladimir Putin may be embarking on a sure-win reelection campaign, the March presidential election results, if the true vote breakdown is disclosed, may be viewed as a potential indicator of the strongman’s support—and whether the Russian public continues to back his seemingly endless war. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, it’s unclear if a planned 2024 presidential vote will take place while the besieged nation is currently under martial law, though incumbent leader Volodomyr Zelensky has said he intends to seek another term and his ratings remain high.\n\nRead More: Inside Volodymyr Zelensky’s Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the Fight\n\nElsewhere, key political successions are also already brewing. With a bleak economic outlook casting a shadow over the U.K.’s ruling Conservative Party, which has been in power for nearly 14 years, opinion polls suggest the opposition Labour Party will likely come out on top in Britain’s next general election, which embattled Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to call at some point in 2024.\n\nRead More: The Man Who Wants to Fix Britain\n\nNot to mention, the elephant in the room; the U.S. presidential race culminating in November has the potential to unleash what the Economist recently described as “the biggest danger to the world” of 2024: former President Donald Trump securing a second term.\n\nBelow are all the elections scheduled or expected to take place in 2024—compiled from information by the National Democratic Institute, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, and Anchor Change, among other sources, and ordered by population according to projections by the United Nations. (Countries and dates are subject to change.)\n\nFor context, each listing also includes the country’s “freedom and fairness score” that ranges from zero (least free and fair) to one (most free and fair) from Our World in Data’s free and fair elections index, which is based on expert assessments by the Swedish think-tank V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy).\n\nINDIA\n\nPopulation: 1.44B\n\nElection(s): Lok Sabha (House of the People)\n\nDate(s): expected April -
