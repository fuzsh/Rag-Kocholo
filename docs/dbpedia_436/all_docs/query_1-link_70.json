        "text": "Recognized as a health management expert, she is often called on by other healthcare leaders and state agencies for her expertise on how to achieve successful outcomes. Her contributions to Arizona’s healthcare and behavioral healthcare systems include, but are not limited to, success in fiscal viability, policy development, service innovation, data management and information systems development.\n\nMrs. Chase has served as the chief financial officer and chief operations officer of several companies and possesses extensive knowledge in finance and operations. She cares deeply for people and has an understanding of the clinical work of Terros Health strengthened by her social work degree from Arizona State University.\n\nUnder Mrs. Chase’s strategic vision and leadership as president and CEO at Terros Health, revenues increased from $38 million to nearly $84 million, through the expansion of existing services, the addition and growth of primary care services and three acquisitions of culturally and strategically aligned companies.\n\nMrs. Chase serves on several boards including: Mental Health Corporations of America (MHCA), Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers and Grand Canyon University as well as Arizona State University Advisory Council. She was named as the 2018 Outstanding Healthcare Executive and one of the Most Influential Women of 2018 by AZ Business Magazine. She was also listed on the 2018 Healthcare Power List by Phoenix Magazine and named one of The Most Admired Leaders by Phoenix Business Journal.\n\nDuring Dr. Rice’s tenure with the Alhambra School District, the district received numerous state and national awards. Dr. Rice has been recognized for his exceptional leadership including being named Arizona’s Distinguished Administrator in 2002; received the Willis J. Ray Volunteer Award from Grand Canyon University in 2003; received an Award of Excellence for Contributions to Public Education from the Arizona School Public Relations Association in 2004; was inducted into the ASU College of Education Hall of Fame in October 2005, received the ASA Administrator of the Year – Superintendent Division in 2007; was named Arizona’s Superintendent of the Year in 2007 and received the Grand Canyon University Alumnus of the Year. In 2010, Jim received the WestMarc Individual Leadership Award. When Jim retired from the Alhambra Elementary School District, the governing board bestowed his name, James W. Rice, on one of their schools. In 2013, he was inducted into GCU’s Athletic Hall of Fame, and in 2016, he was inducted into GCU’s College of Education Hall of Fame. In 2017, Dr. Rice was inducted into Phoenix Union High School District’s Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nDr. Rice currently serves as a content expert for doctorate level students at GCU, where he also serves on the university’s board as a board trustee. In addition to GCU’s board, he serves on the advisory council for the Assistance League of Phoenix.\n\nHe continues to act as a consultant to his predecessor at Indiana Institute of Technology. From 1960 to 1970, Mr. Andorfer served as a full-time faculty member at the International Business College (Fort Wayne, Indiana) and then from 1970 to 1977 as dean and director of the International Junior College of Business (Fort Wayne, Indiana). Mr. Andorfer has actively participated as a consultant and evaluator for the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association for the past 15 years. During that time, he occupied a three-year term on the Higher Learning Commission’s Academic Review Committee.\n\nMr. Andorfer and his wife, Mary Janet, continue to play an active role in their community. They chaired a capital campaign to raise $1.5 million with St. Aloysius Catholic Church for its elementary school and new community center.\n\nHe has served on numerous boards and is the recipient of several honors and awards. To name just two, he received the Sagamore of Wabash Award (Indiana’s highest citizen award) and another naming him the “Citizen of the Year” by the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette in 2003, along with two other university presidents. At the conclusion of Mr. Andorfer’s service at the Indiana Institute of Technology in 2003, “Andorfer Commons” (the newest and largest building on the campus) was dedicated in his honor, remembering him as a man of character and excellence.\n\nMr. Andorfer earned his Bachelor of Science in Education and Master of Arts in Education from Ball State University (Muncie, Indiana). In addition, he has completed graduate work in finance and administration.\n\nBetween 2009 and June 2022, Mr. Mueller has also overseen nearly $1.7 billion in campus expansion through new technologies, classrooms, laboratories, athletic facilities and student amenities.\n\nThese efforts to create a better educational environment have been accomplished at no additional cost to students or taxpayers in Arizona. By creating a hybrid education model that relies on operational efficiencies and fiscal responsibility on its ground and online campuses, this ensures one of Mr. Mueller’s highest priorities as president—that a high-quality, private, Christian education is affordable to all socioeconomic classes. In fact, GCU’s online students received nearly $130 million in scholarships and traditional campus students received nearly $180 million in 2022.3\n\nAcademically, Mr. Mueller has led a reinvention of GCU's programs, aligning the school's curriculum with high-growth fields such as computer science, information technology, cybersecurity and engineering, among others, while continuing to produce graduates with the high character and servant leadership the university is known for. As of September 2023, the university offers 336 academic programs, including 275 online programs. By the end of 2023, GCU grew from nine to 10 colleges.\n\nAnother emphasis for Mr. Mueller has been his five-point plan to revitalize West Phoenix by 1) Creating jobs on campus that have made the university an economic catalyst for the community, 2) Creating jobs for local residents through 10 business enterprises that employ nearly 500 people, 3) Supporting K-12 education with free tutoring and full-tuition scholarship programs, 4) Making the surrounding neighborhood safer through a $2.2 million partnership with the City of Phoenix and 5) Collaborating to complete nearly 1,200 repairs with Habitat for Humanity.4\n\nMr. Mueller's vision for Christian education draws from his own experiences as a student, teacher and coach in Christian schools. His passion is also seen in his inspiring Chapel service addresses, which draw standing-room-only crowds at GCU Arena.\n\nMr. Mueller began his higher education career as a teacher and coach at Concordia University. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Education and Master of Arts in Education from Concordia.\n\nMr. Mueller has served on a myriad of boards, including the Greater Phoenix Economic Council and Arizona Commerce Authority and is executive director of the Joy Community Church Foundation.\n\nHis post-college career began at age 21 as a television broadcaster (news and weather, WJAC and KPNX). After law school, at age 26, he served as an assistant attorney general in its organized crime division. At age 29, he was elected as a state representative, and at age 31, a state senator.\n\nDean Kaites has started over 20 companies in his career. One of his companies, GSIS, does global security consulting around the world. Another company, P3, LLC, helps sports teams and professional leagues with their business transactions. He is also an investor in more than 100 companies both public and private.\n\nTaking the knowledge learned in the world of sports, he formed a company called the Christ Foundation, LLC that gives its services away to churches to help them succeed in the business of the church. He is of counsel to the law firm of Fennemore Craig and a pastor at a church in Scottsdale, Arizona. Dean Kaites has a doctorate from Duquesne University School of Law, Juris Doctor, a bachelor’s degree from Allegheny College, a degree in Christian studies from Fuller Theological Seminary, and is completing a master’s in ministry from Phoenix Seminary in Fall 2024.\n\nHe is the author of two books: “Fear Not” and “In the Beginning” and is currently working on a third book. He is a grateful husband to wife Ann and a blessed father of Alexander and Jacob.\n\nPrior to joining GCU, Mr. Lambertson served in numerous leadership roles in The Boeing Company, including chief engineer, systems engineering, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) leading all functional activities for the nearly 1,200 BCA Systems Engineers; integration leader, 777/777X Fuselage Assembly Center leading the production engineering and integration for Boeing’s wide body 777 and new 777X fuselages; with his last three and a half years serving as The Boeing Company’s chief of standards.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Lambertson served over 20 years in the U.S. Air Force. A command, instructor and chief examiner pilot, he logged over 3,300 flying hours in various aircraft worldwide, including 147 combat hours. He holds FAA Airline Transport Pilot (ATP), USAF Aircraft Maintenance, and Command & Control licenses/certifications. His career included a variety of individual contributor, management, command and senior leadership positions. He was selected as an Air Force chief of staff intern to DARPA. He has commanded missions globally including in both the Iraq and Afghanistan combat zones, as well as commanding the National Science Foundation’s support missions to Antarctica (Operation DEEP FREEZE). Finally, he served as the director of systems engineering at the U.S. Air Force Academy and continues as a senior advisor to the USAF Academy’s Systems Engineering program.\n\nDean Lambertson holds a Bachelor of Science in Space Operations from the U.S. Air Force Academy, a Master of Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a Master of Science in Systems Engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology. He is also a graduate of the USAF’s Air War College. He enjoys spending time with his family and volunteering. He serves with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) as a transport mission pilot and character development instructor. He has served in leadership roles with organizations, including Aerospace Industries Association, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, SAE International and the Everett Gospel Mission. Dean Lambertson and his wife have two children."
