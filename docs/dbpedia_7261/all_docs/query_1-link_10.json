Originally published as Dictionnaire des Cinéastes, 1965. Designed by W. H. Snyder Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 78-136028 ISBN: 0-520-01864-8 (cloth) 0-520-02151-7 (paper) Copyrighted material BY GEORGES SADOUL For this Dictionary we used the definition of \"Film Maker\" given by Louis Delluc in 1922, to include \"Organizers, directors, artists, industri- alists who have contributed something to the artistic industry of the cinema.\" The present volume contains a thousand entries devoted to directors, scriptwriters, cinematographers, art directors, composers, producers, inven- tors—but not actors and actresses. At least 10,000 entries would be nec- essary—not for an international Who's Who which would require at least 100,000 names, but just in order to include all those who have con- tributed to the rapid worldwide development of the art of the cinema since 1895. This Dictionary does not pretend to be \"exhaustive.\" In order to be accessible to everyone, both in format and in price, it could not attempt to emulate the monumental Italian Filmlexicon degli Autori whose seven volumes contain well over 50,000 entries, including actors. The necessity of making a selection has led us to choose, sometimes arbitrarily, one film maker over another of equal importance; but we have attempted to include here the representatives of 60 countries without limit- ing ourselves to the best-known film industries. Twenty-five years devoted to film history, numerous study travels in four continents, devoted collabora- tors and excellent French and foreign reference works have not prevented errors and gaps in a volume which contains about 20,000 dates and film titles. Certain omissions (rightly or wrongly) are deliberate. Others not. If one attempted to bring to the public only à perfect work one would never be able to print the manuscript Publication is the best means of provoking corrections and additional information. We appeal to readers to send us these so that one day a revised and corrected edition can be published. Our predecessors proceeded no differently. Here is the method we have followed. The date of a film is in principle that of the first public screening, not of its conception, beginning or end of production, or private screening. In this we have followed the historians Copyrighted material of literature who use the date of the first edition, of a book's release to the public, as the identifying one. Each of our entries (apart from those of a few lines) is comprised of a critical appraisal, followed by a filmography. All have been abridged and many do not list all the films of a prolific film maker. The director's filmographies are the key to this Dictionary. For other film makers we cite only film titles with their directors, whose entries should be referred to for additional information. This part has been retained to facilitate consultation but it does not signify that we have pretended to settle the old question about the \"author\" of a film. In certain cases, the principal \"author\" might be less the credited director than a star (such as Douglas Fairbanks), a producer (such as Zanuck), a scriptwriter (such as Zavattini), or even a writer whose literary work has been adapted (such as Victor Hugo). A film is almost always a collective creation and each col- laborator, from the least technician to the most famous star, in small part or large, is one of the authors. Moreover, certain major comedians can be considered as the principal authors of films which they themselves did not always \"direct.\" Thus, we have included brief entries for Buster Keaton, Max Under, Harold Lloyd, and others. In the entries for important directors we have quite often quoted from interviews, statements, or critical articles. Sometimes we have had to para- phrase these while respecting the spirit. In the filmographies we have given (whenever possible) original-language titles and the French titles which are not often a literal translation but the title chosen, for good or ill, by the dis- tributor. A thousand important films have been given only by title, followed by an asterisk, indicating that this work is described in more detail in our complementary Dictionary of Films. In order to be able to publish a volume for wide distribution it was nec- essary to accept limitations on the number of entries and therefore to eliminate some categories of film makers. We have not included technicians though we know that they are of major importance (editors, sound engi- neers, and camera operators). We have cited few producers and no ex- hibitors, distributors, or exporters. It is our hope that this present volume, such as it is, will be of assistance to cinéphiles — that elite of spectators who now count themselves in mil- lions around the world. vi Copyrighted material TO THE ENGLISH EDITION BY PETER MORRIS I am pleased to have had the opportunity of bringing Georges Sadoul's val- uable Dictionary of Film Makers to English-speaking readers. In preparing this edition I have taken advantage of his invitation to revise and correct factual information in the original. In particular many of the filmographies have been expanded and additional biographical information has been in- cluded in many of the entries. More recent development of certain film makers' work has led me to revise completely several of the entries. I have also added many new entries, no- tably for directors who established their reputations in the sixties (e.g., Bertolucci, Form an, Skolimowski) but also for certain cameramen, writers, and composers whose work seemed to me to merit inclusion. In each case entries authored by me are indicated by an asterisk. In some cases I have added additional information or a critical appraisal of the film maker's re- cent work; these are indicated in the text by square brackets [ ]. In all, the Dictionary has been expanded by some 15%. The original format has been retained with minor revisions. The film maker's name is followed by an indication (in parentheses) of his original name or other names under which he worked (also = also known as). The arrangement is entirely alphabetical by letter. \"Mc\" and \"Mac\" are interfiled as \"Mac\" as is now common practice though, of course, the correct spelling has been retained. Certain names have been cross-refer- enced for convenience and to avoid confusion over surname prefixes (e.g., Philippe de Broca is entered under \"Broca\" but cross-referenced from \"de Broca,\" and similarly with Erich von Stroheim, and others). The filmographies for many entries have been expanded and in every case up-dated; for some directors the filmographies have been completed. Filmographies which are not complete have been indicated by the use of \"notably\" preceding the filmography, to indicate that a selection has been made. Original-language film titles have been used in directors' filmogra- vii Uopy riQhtod mstcnsl phies wherever possible but not for other film makers where a cross reference to the director is possible. For reasons of space, titles in common languages (French, German, Italian) have not been translated when the English release title is merely a translation of the original; it has usually been given when it substantially differs. For other languages (Russian, Swedish, Japanese, etc.) an English title is given even though this may only be a literal translation and not a release title. Film dates, given in parentheses after the title and without the \"19,\" do not include the country of origin except where this is not the same as that in which the film maker normally worked. For film makers who worked on a group of films in one country and later in another country, the films' country of origin is given only at the beginning and end of each series of films (e.g., Lubitsch). In any case, the films' nationality is often indicated by the language of the tides. As Sadoul points out, publication is a means of provoking emendations and I join with him in welcoming corrections or additional information for inclusion in a later edition. Inevitably not everyone will agree with Sadoul's assessment of certain film makers, nor with mine. But the particular merit of the original over other dictionaries is its critical and historical appraisals rather than its being only an assemblage of facts. It is this quality which I hope I have retained in this edition. I am indebted to the Canadian Film Institute's Film Study Center and the British Film Institute's Information Department, without access to which the preparation of this volume would have been impossible. viii Copyrighted material ALSO Also known as ED Editor ANIM Animator MUS Composer ART DIR Art Director/Production PHOTOG Director of Photography Designer PROD Producer/Executive ASSIST Assistant Producer CHOREOG Choreographer/Dance PSEUD Pseudonym Director Q.V.

From 1946 to 1948 was assistant director, unit production manager, writer at Enterprises Studios. Continued as as- sociate producer and assistant until 1952 when he directed 17 of the NBC TV series The Doctor and four of the China Smith series. During his years as assis- tant (see below) he worked with Re- noir (<7.v.), Losey (q.v.), Wcllman (q.v.) t and Chaplin (q.v.). He directed his first feature in 1953 and received major recognition with Apache in 1954.] His style is powerful, persuasive, and a little hysterical. He often dealt with so- cial themes in his early films, notably in Apache, Attack, The Big Knife and that marvelous reversal of the conven- tional thriller, Kiss Me Deadly. He has said of himself: \"I portray heroic char- acters. I am opposed to the idea of fatalism. Everyone must take his own actions even if he is broken. Voluntary sacrifice is the acme of moral integrity. Suicide is a gesture of revolt: it is neces- sary to pay the price of strife ... I loath showing despicable characters who are merely black; this is a question less of finding excuses than explanations . . • I have a weakness for flowery language but during rehearsals I become aware of what could be excessive and I make it more humane . . . Love with a cap- ital L has never been depicted in my films. It is the basis of life, of mankind, but the attachment which a man can have to a way of life or a cause is per- haps more durable than the attachment to a woman.\" [assist: for Renoir The Southerner* (45), for Leslie Fenton Pardon My Past (45) , for Wellman The Story of G.I.

(Yekaterinburg Feb 23, 1903- ) Originally Eisenstein's (q.v.) right-hand man and collaborator, he made his own name famous with Jazz Comedy (34). Drawing on Amer- ican burlesque, serials, musicals, and even animated cartoons, but with an original, very Russian style of its own, it was a worldwide success. He followed this up with the less successful Circus and Volga-Volga and, after the war, Spring, featuring his wife Lyuba Orlova. He returned to contemporary problems with Meeting on the Elbe in 1949 and in 1952, directed a biographical film on the composer, Glinka. His entertaining earthy approach and verve have earned him a place among film makers of in- ternational caliber. co-dir/co-scen (with Eisenstein): Oc- tober*, The General Line*, Que Viva Mexico*. dpr: Romance sentimentale (Fr31), Women's Crusade /Woman's Weal, Wom- an's Woe (Switz31), Internationale (33) (both these are experimental documen- taries), Vesyolye Rebyata/Jazz Com- edy* (34), Cirk /Circus* (36), Report of Comrade Stalin on Proposed Consti- tution of the USSR to the Eighth Ex- traordinary Congress of the Soviets (37), / Maja/May 1st (38) (both documen- taries), Volga-Volga (38), Svetlyi Put/ Bright Pat h /Tanya (40), Film Report on the War No. 4 (41), Odna Semja/ One Family (43), Kapiskie Liudi /Those From the Caspian (44), Vesna/ Spring* (47), Vstrecha na Elbe/Meeting on the Elbe (49) (photog: Tisse, mus: Shosta- kovich), Kompozitor Glinka/Glinka (52) (photog: Tisse), Chelovieku che- loviek/From Man to Man (58) (docu- mentary), Russki Suvenir/ Russian Sou- venirs (60), Lenin v Shveitzarii/ Lenin in Switzerland (66), October, revised version of original (67). ALEXEIEFF, Alexandre am m France. (Ka- zan, Russia August 5, 1901- ) The complete work of this great French animator lasts barely two hours on the screen but represents more than thirty years of continuing experiments with plastic techniques. Originally a talented engraver and illustrator, he developed af- ter 1930 the pin-screen method of illu- minating thousands of pins, set at various levels in a screen, to produce depth and design. In Une nuit sur le mont Chauve (33) set to Mussorgsky's music he used this method to create the effect of ani- mated engravings, full of strange beauty and fantastic details. His prewar short commercials are supreme examples of the form - plastic poems of shapes, light, movement, and color. During the war in Canada he returned to the pin-screen with his collaborator Claire Parker and made the beautiful En Passant set to French-Canadian folk music. Back in France after the war, he had again to concentrate on commercials before making for Orson Welles the remarkable pin-screen prologue for The Trial and the short film Le Nez based on the Go- gol story. If only for his invention of the revolutionary pin-screen technique with its limitless possibilities, he would merit a place in film history.

DeMille (q.v.) and Stanley Kramer (q.v.). ANTOINE, André Dm France. (Limoges Jan 31, 1858-Le Pouliguen Oct 19, 1943) This influential theater director and man- ager came to film too late (at 60 years old) in his career to exercise the same kind of influence on the still adolescent cinema. However many films he directed he was usually restricted to adaptations of well-known authors and had his L'Alouette et la Mésange (from his own script, using nonprofessional actors) re- fused distribution. The striking vision of Paris at war he created in Le Coupable and the lyricism of La Terre would lead Copyrighted material one to think that his Les Frères Corses, Les Travailleurs de la mer (from Victor Hugo), and Mademoiselle de La Sei- glière might be significant films, but they have unfortunately disappeared. The best French film makers of the Twenties did not understand how much the founder of the Théâtre Libre and one of the proponents of the \"new nat- uralism\" anticipated the future of the cinema and particularly Italian neo- realism. But before his final retirement from the film studios, he wrote: \"People have been mistaken, from the beginnings of the cinema, in adopting theatrical methods for an art which is nothing like it . . . The kingdom of tomorrow will belong to plastic artists more than liter- ary ones ... On the stage, the view is fixed. In the cinema, it is perpetually in motion . . . The most valuable im- provement that could be made would be to avoid using studios, even, and es- pecially for interiors . . . Then we would be able to note the difference pos- sible between the cinema, which is living, outdoor creation, and the theater, whose principle, on the other hand, is the imi- tation of nature.\" Retired as director of the Odéon in 1916. From 1930-1940 he was film critic for Journal. His son, André-Paul Antoine, has written scripts for Du vivier, Christian- Jaque, Pierre Chenal, Raymond Bernard (all q.v.), and others.

ANTONIONI, Michelangelo Dm Italy. (Fer- rera Sept 29, 1912- ) One of the most important film makers of the second half of this century. Passionately involved with his themes, his best work is char- acterized by an avoidance of traditional narrative structure in favor of character studies in depth and analyses of the anguish and unease of the modern world. Born among the middle-class and know- ing these people best, his films have been almost entirely set in the bourgeois milieu, with the notable exception of II Grido, the hopeless odyssey of a worker in the northern plains of Italy. Always, the environment of his characters plays a major role in the themes of his films. He developed an early interest in the cinema and theater, contributed in the late Thirties to Cinema, and continued writing as a film critic until 1949. His first film experience was as a script- writer during the gestation period of neo- realism and his first films were docu- mentaries. In films like Gente del Po, N.U., and U Amoroso Menzogna hints of his vision of the world and even his obsessions are already present. His first features are largely exploratory, but he established himself with Le Amiche in 1955 from a story by Cesare Pavese. In relation to this he said: \"My profession is making films, but this is also the pro- fession of living, of relating to my fel- low-men, having experiences.\" L'Avven- tura, his first major international success, made him famous and he followed this with L'Eclisse and La Notte, the second and third parts of a trilogy focusing on women in modem society. He has de- scribed, at various times, his themes and approach: \"My opinions, my mistakes, that which is most personal in my ex- periences will convey my message if I am sincere. To be sincere implies making something that is somewhat autobio- graphical. The experience that mainly contributed to make me a director is the bourgeois background from which I came ... In the first place and above all I like women. Perhaps this is because I understand them better. I was raised among women and in their environment. I have been criticized for observing everything from a distance. This is not at all deliberate, only my method of tell- ing the story. This 'distancing' is perhaps also modesty. I manage to imagine a moving scene but I cannot direct it. Per- haps this is because I am moved before others. Perhaps it is also because I am from the north, from Ferrara, a town where the people hide their emotions entirely ... I am very concerned dur- ing shooting to follow the character until I sense the necessity of slackening my grip. The acting becomes good through the images, which is a plastic fact Gray tones and threatening skies are often characteristic of my films ... In trying to explain to the actor what he must do, one risks making his acting mechanical or turning him into a second director. . . . I attach great importance to the sound-track, to natural sounds and noises more than to music. . . . Our drama is incommunicability which isolates us one from the other. Its permanence misleads Copyrighted material us and prevents us from resolving our problems. I am not a moralist. I neither have, nor pretend to have, a solution.

(London Nov 9, 1902-Feb 1968) With Alfred Hitchcock (q.v.) the strongest force in Uopy riQhtod mstcnsl the British cinema of the Thirties and one of the most important British di- rectors. Passionately devoted to the cin- ema, tasteful and intelligent, he has varied between quasi-documentary por- traits of English life and theatrical adap- tations, but his style has always been part of his attempt to avoid the Korda (q.v.) \"international\" approach and find an authentic English character. The son of Lord Asquith, he went to Hollywood in 1926 to study film-making and in 1928 in Britain was assistant to Sinclair Hall on Boadicea. His first feature, Shooting Stars (28), a burlesque, used revolutionary effects. He continued his experiments in audio-visual counterpoint and the portrayal of English life with A Cottage on Dartmoor (29); in Tell En- gland (30) he depicted the Gallipoli ex- pedition during the First World War. He became internationally famous as a mas- ter of stage adaptations with Pygmalion (38) from Shaw's play. He made what is certainly his masterpiece, The Way to the Stars, at the end of the war. Thereafter, the evolution of the cinema somewhat stranded him in the two genres that appealed to him, but he con- tinued to make civilized, entertaining films until his death.

ASTRUC, Alexandre Dm France. (Paris July 13, 1923- ) A stylist with a deep in- sight into the elaboration of visual imag- ery as a means of elucidating human relationships. He established a consid- erable reputation as a film critic and journalist for Combat and L'Ecran Fran- çaise and renewed interest in the Ger- man silent cinema and the work of Murnau. Evolved the idea of \"caméra- stylo\" in 1948: \"By it I mean the cin- ema will gradually break free from the tyranny of the visual, from the image for its own sake, from the immediate and concrete demands of the narrative, to become a means of writing as supple and subtle as written language . . . With the development of 16mm and television, the day is not far off when everyone will possess a projector, will go to the local shop and rent films written on any subject, of any form . . . The funda- mental problem of the cinema is how to express thought The creation of this language has preoccupied all the theore- ticians and writers in the history of cinema, from Eisenstein down to the scriptwriters and adaptors of the sound cinema.\" He worked on two 16mm shorts as as- sistant to Marc Allégret (q.v.) and Mar- cel Achard (q.v.) and collaborated on two scripts before making his first pro- fessional film, Le Rideau cramoisi, in 1952. This and his first feature, Les Mauvaises rencontres, 1955, are in some ways precursors of the nouvelle vague. Apart from his early films, most of his films are from imposed subjects and adapted from existing works. Few have had any real commercial success. It is ironic that the man who so passionately attacked the filming of famous novels and plays should himself have had to use the \"caméra-stylo\" in just this way. assist: Marc Allégret's Blanche Fury (Brit47), Marcel Achard's Jean de la lune (49). co-scen: La P . . . respecteuse (52) (dir: Pagliero), Luther (unfilmed). dir (shorts): Aller et Retour (48) in 16 mm, Ulysse ou les Mauvaises ren- 10 Copyrighted material contres (49) in 16 mm, Le Rideau cra- moisi* (52), Les Puits et le Pendule (63) for TV, Evariste Galois (64).

AUTANT-LARA, Claud* Dm France. (Lu- zarches Aug 5, 1903- ) Became active in the cinema from the age of sixteen, designed sets and costumes for Marcel L'Herbier (q.v.) and later for Jean Renoir (q.v.) and Jacque Catelain; was also assistant to René Clair (q.v.). He directed an avant-garde short, Fait divers, in 1923, then a documentary, Vit tel (26), and Construire un feu (27-28), an early wide-screen experiment from a Jack London story. From 1930 to 1932 he directed French versions of American films in Hollywood and, after his return to France, directed a number of shorts. His pre- 1942 features were commissioned and did not at all appeal to him but he had to accept them in order to make a living until Le Diable au corps (47) brought him international fame. It is perhaps not surprising that he has said: The director must consider himself sur- rounded by enemies. What I mean by this is that, in a business where the taste of one man must prevail, he is sur- rounded by people who want to do nothing but impose their own tastes.\" The war gave him the chance to emerge from the shadows, and after the charm- ing, outdated Le Mariage de Chiffon and Lettres d'amour in 1942, his satire of the bourgeoisie in Douce/Love Story (43) seemed especially astringent dur- ing the Pétainist period. Waspish satiri- cal views of conventional morality char- acterize his films in the first postwar decade. An attack on the recent war through a portrait of an earlier one is the key to Le Diable au corps, still his best film. He dissected the ridiculous characters of \"la Belle époque\" in Oc~ cupe-toi d'Amélie, brought violent Vol- t ai re an satire to L'Auberge rouge, and depicted the bitter occupation years in La Traversée de Paris. His films, how- ever, are not all equally successful. He has tended to concentrate on staging well-written adaptations of classic novels and plays. This may perhaps be because the cover of a well-known work allows him to say more without interference from the censor (whom he has perpetu- ally attacked). In order to make Non Uccidere, a film close to his heart for ten years, he had to accept many com- mercial films. art dir: for L'Herbier, Le Carnaval des vérités (19), L'Homme du large (20), Villa Destin (21), Don Juan et Faust (22) , L'Inhumaine* (23), Le Diable au coeur (27); for Jean Renoir, Nana* (26); for Jacque Catelain, Le Marchard de plaisir m). assist: to René Clair on Paris qui dort* (23) , Le Voyage imaginaire (25). dir (shorts): Fait divers (23), Vlttel (26), Construire en jeu (27-28), Le Gendarme est sans pitié, Un client sérieux, Monsieur le duc, La Peur des coups, Invite Monsieur à dîner (ail 32-33).

(Ma- drid June 2, 1922- ) With his friend Berlanga (q.v.) he gave the Spanish cinema a new lease on life and an inter- national standing. Stylistically vigorous and sincere, he has expressed the real- ities of his country better than anyone (except Bunuel) in Comicos, La Ven- ganza and particularly in Death of a Cyclist and Calle Mayor. The son of actors Rafael Bardem and Mathilde M. Sampiero, he was educated in agricul- ture, then in 1947 received a diploma from the Madrid film school. He made his name as a scriptwriter on Berlanga's Welcome, Mr. Marshall! in 1952. In 1955, the young film maker took stock of the Spanish cinema: \"After 60 years the Spanish cinema is politically ineffec- tive, socially false, intellectually infirm, aesthetically empty, industrially rickety. We now want to fight for a national cin- ema with love, sincerity, and honor.\" Later he added: \"Undoubtedly a film maker cannot himself hope to change the world. Nonetheless, he must make a con- tribution. He must devote all his efforts towards a positive, useful cinema that will reveal the reality of things so that they will change. The Spanish spirit is realistic in literature as it is in paint- ing. I consider the cinema deeply rooted in reality. It is the witness of its time. It is necessary to say as much as possible, as quietly as possible. Briefly, to shun the baroque and return to classicism.\" \"An artist cannot transplant his roots; I can speak only of that which I know well: Spain.\" scen: for Berlanga, Bienvenido, Mr. Marshall!* (52), Novio a la vista (53); and for all his own films.

(Moscow June 16, 1902-Riga Jan 1965) The best Soviet director of comedies, gentle and lyrical in his approach, full of warmth in his perceptive observation of behavior. Orig- inally a boxer, he trained in films under Kuleshov. After his excellent silent films, like The House on Trubnaya Square (28) and Girl with the Hat-Box (27), he created his masterpiece, Okraina in 1933. In 1959 in a conversation with me he said: \"I am not a theoretical man, but I take the material for my films from life. For good or ill, I have always tried to show a modern period, men truly set in Soviet times. But it is not easy and one might in this regard think of a Japanese painter. Until he is 40 he paints still lifes. Between 40 and 60, birds. After 60, herons and ducks. He must wait until he is a hundred before finding the dignity to take up the sub- ject of man. But is one ever sure of having sufficient time? Personally I like the droll aspects of a drama and the tragic elements of comedy. It is a ques- tion of proportions, not always easy to find.\" Acted in Kuleshov's The Strange Adventure of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks* (24), Otsep's Der Lebende Leichnam/A Living Corpse (USSR/Germany 29), his own Miss Mend.

BECKER, Jacques dir France. (Paris Sept 15, 1906-Paris Feb 21, 1960) A director of integrity who was Renoir's (q.v.) as- sistant from 1931 to 1939 and who followed the realistic path of his mentor, but with an intensely personal and care- fully detailed style of his own. He began by creating a kind of social tableau of France, offering a very careful and rea- listic portrait of peasant life in Goupi Mains-Rouges, of fashionable Paris in Falbalas, of a pair of working-class lovers in postwar Paris in Antoine et Antoinette, and of the Saint-Germain- des-Près youth in Rendez-vous de juillet. His most perfectly created visual work is Casque d'or, a portrait of Parisian apaches at the turn of the century and a tribute to the time of Feuillade (q.v.). He tried his hand at sophisticated com- edies and was forced to accept several commissioned films, but acquitted him- self well even with these. Then, just be- fore his death he regained his true crea- tive power with Le Trou, a rigorous but totally engrossing film. He has described his art and ideas: \"The effectiveness of a film is dependent on the application of a rigorous logic to the development of the story. In a true film everything must be foreseen, the smallest suspect detail destroys the value of the whole.\" \"Causes don't interest me as much as a theme. The story (the anecdote, the tale) is of little importance to me. Only the char- acters, who become my characters, obsess me to the point where I can't stop think- ing about them. They excite me just as people I meet by chance during the day excite me and about whom I am curious to the point of being caught staring at strangers.\" \"People have been wrong in believing, roughly, that I have tried at any price to be 'social.' This impression is caused by the fact that in my films they become quite involved with the charac- ters. That is my somewhat entomological side: whatever happens in France, I am French, I make films about French peo- ple, I look at French people, I am inter- ested in French people.\" Began a feature L'Or du Cristobal in 1939 that he was not able to complete.

BERGLUND, Sven INVENTOR Sweden. (Stockholm July 20, 1881 -Berlin May 10, 1937) Would appear to have been, with Eugène Lauste (q.v.), the first to have recorded sound on film by an op- tical process (1906-11). After demon- strating the process in Stockholm, 1921, and Berlin, 1922, he established Filmfo- toton, which was absorbed in 1928 by Tobis. Continued his experiments on stereoscopic film in Berlin after 1933. Committed suicide in 1937, undoubtedly toescaDe the Gestapo. BERGMAN, Ingmar DIR/SCEN Sweden. (Uppsala July 4, 1918- ) The most famous contemporary Swedish director. Preoccupied with metaphysical musings about human relationships, God, and the Devil, he has followed in the footsteps of his mentors, Sjcstrôm (q.v) and Stiller (q.v.), with an unparalleled sense of thsme, character, poetic lyricism, atmos- phere, and an overwhelming pessimism. The son of a pastor to the royal court, he was trained in the Swedish theater, was assistant at the Swedish Opera from 1940-42, worked on scripts at Svensk Film in dus tri from 1940-44, and wrote scripts for Sjôberg (q.v.) and Molander (q.v.). His first films as director reflect the influence of Marcel Carné and French poetic realism. He made his name with two almost metaphysical studies of the problems of male-female relation- ships, Prison (48) and Thirst (49), and women play a major role in films such as Summer Interlude, Waiting Women, Summer with Monika and A Lesson in Love. He had already established an international reputation when the public at large discovered him through Smiles of a Summer Night (55), even though this acidulous satire was generally con- sidered only a charming comedy. He was taken seriously after The Seventh Seal, despite its somewhat simplistic philos- ophy. It doesn't match the profundity of Wild Strawberries (perhaps his master- piece), in which he portrayed a man facing the problems of his past life — a theme he had earlier explored in the 19 Copyrighted material tragicomedy Sawdust and Tinsel. He be- came somewhat uncertain in his forties but found a new forcefulness and ap- proach in Through a Glass Darkly, Win- ter Light, and The Silence, whose sparse, intense styles he has further developed in his recent films. He has discussed himself and his work at various times (somewhat paraphrased): \"Art lost its basic creative drive the moment it was separated from worship ... In former days the artist remained unknown and his work was to the glory of God ... I want to be one of the artists in the cathedral on the great plain . . . Regardless of whether I be- lieve or not, whether I am Christian or not, I would play my part in the collec- tive building of the cathedral.\" \"When I was younger, work was an exciting game for me . . . now it has become a bitter fight.\" \"If my original ideas have enough strength to make a film, I decide to ma- terialize it. Then comes something very difficult and complicated: the transforma- tion of rhythms, moods, atmosphere, ten- sions, sequences, tones and scents into words, into an understandable script . . . I have never had any ambition to be an author. I am a film maker not an author.\" \"The human face is the starting point for our work. The camera must take part only like a totally objective observer. The actor's most beautiful means of expres- sion is his look. Simplicity, concentra- tion, an awareness of details, these must be the constant factors in each scene and each ensemble.\" \"My first command- ment is always to be interesting. The public has a right to demand from me sensation, emotion, joy, rejuvenation. Everything is allowed except that which leads to failure; the most dangerous roads are in the end the only practical ones.\" Bergman has continued to work in the theater as a director and playwright and also for TV. scen: for Sjôberg Hets/Torment* (44), Sista Par et ut /Last Pair Out (51), for Molander Kvinna utan ansikte/ Woman without a Face (47), Eva (48), Fran- skild/ Divorced (51), for Alf Kjellin Lustgarden / Pleasure Garden (61), and all his own films except Music in Dark- ness, Thirst, This Can't Happen Here, The Virgin Spring. dir: Kris /Crisis (46), Det Regnar pa var Kiirlek/It Rains on Our Love (46), Skcpp till India/and/ A Ship Bound for India (47), Musik i M inker /Music in Darkness (48), Harnnstadt/Port of Call (48), Fdngelse/ Prison (48), Tôrst/ Thirst* (49), Till Gladje/To Joy (50), Sant Hdnder inte Hdr/This Can't Hap- pen Here/ High Tension (50), Sommar- lek I Summer Interlude* (51), Kvinnors Vantan/ Waiting Women (52) Som- maren med Monika/Summer with Mon- ika* (52), Gycklarnas Afton/Sawdust and Tinsel /The Naked Night* (53), En Lektion i Karlck/A Lesson in Love (54), Kvinnodrôm/ Journey into Au- tumn* (55), Sommarnattens Leendef Smiles of a Summer Night* (55), Det Sjunde Inseglet/The Seventh Seal* (56), Smultronstdllet/Wild Strawberries* (57), Nara Livet/So Close to Life/Brink of Life (58), Ansiktet/The Face/The Magi- cian (58), Jungfrukdllen/The Virgin Spring* (60), Djdvulens Oga/The Devil's Eye (60), Sasom i en Spegel/ Through a Glass Darkly* (61), Nattsvardsgdsterna/ Winter Light* (63), Tystnaden/The Silence* (63), For atte inte Tola om Alia Dessa Kvinnor/Now about All These Women (64), Stimulantia (65) (one episode, released 67), Persona (66), Vargtimmen/Hour of the Wolf* (68), Skammen/ Shame (68), Riten/The Rite /The Ritual (69) (for TV), En pas- sion/A Passion (69), Faro Document (70). BERKELEY, Busby (William Berkeley Enos) DIR/ choreog USA. (Los Angeles Nov 29, 1895- ) The best American chore- ographer of the Thirties. His career began on Broadway as choreographer, producer, impresario; moved to Hollywood soon after the introduction of sound to be dance director for the films of Eddie Cantor and others. Joined Warner Broth- ers in 1933 and developed there the mas- terful, cinematic style that became his trademark: kaleidoscopic visual stagings of chorus girls, using every conceivable camera device and angle. He is far more the author of such musical master- pieces of the Thirties as 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933 than their credited directors. He has recently returned to the Broadway stage.

(Valen- cia June 12, 1921- ) With his friend, Bardem (?.v.), he gave birth to a new Spanish cinema with Welcome, Mr. Mar- shall! Originally a journalist, like Bardem he was trained at the Madrid film school. He is a masterful satirist and has fol* lowed in his best films (notably Placido) the great Spanish picaresque tradition. He has said of himself: \"L want to show only the goodness of men through the social order and mankind. As a man, I am a liberal, as an individual, a Chris- tian. What pleases me is to make films. I like to live and be left in peace.\" This latter wish has not always been granted, since his films have often fallen afoul of the censor. Has scripted all his own films. dir (notably): Paseo sobre una guerra antlgua (48) (16 mm short, co-dir: Bar- dem), El Circo (49) (16mm short), Esa parefa feliz (51) (co-dir: Bardem), Bien- venido, Mr. Marshall!* (52), Calabuch (56) , Los Jueves Milagro (57), Placido (61) , Les Quatrcs vérités (62) (one epi- sode), El Verdugo/The Executioner* (62) ,LasPiranas (67).

[His The Last Company in Ger- many with Conrad Veidt and Emil Jan- nings seemed to indicate talent, but his French and British films were mediocre. Moved to France in 1934, Britain in 1935, and Hollywood in 1940. His first Hollywood film of any merit was Con- flict (45), a Germanic-style thriller with Humphrey Bogart and Sidney Green- street. He even managed to nullify the charms of The Merry Widow, and his Miss Sadie Thompson is a poor remake of Rain.] DIR (notably): Qualen der Nacht (26), Schinderhannes (28), die Letzte Kom- pagnie/The Last Company (30), Der Mann, der den Mord beging/The Man Who Murdered (31), Der Rebell (32), Der Tunnel (33), L'Or dans la rue (Fr34), Beloved Vagabond (Brit36), Devotion (USA43), Conflict (45), A Stolen Life (46), Possessed (48), The High Wall (48), Payment on Demand (51), The Blue Veil (51), Sirocco (51), The Merry Widow* (52), Miss Sadie Thompson (54), Beau Brummel (54), Interrupted Melody (56), Gaby (56), Kisses for My President (64). * BERNSTEIN, Elmer mus USA.

Italy (Parma March 16, 1940- ) Young film maker of serious moral sensibility and political interests who made his name with Before the Revolution (64), a thematically dense and visually bold film. Though he has worked on documentaries and for TV, his films are more influenced by the later Visconti (q.v.) and Rossellini (q.v.) and by Godard (q.v.) and Pasolini (q.v.) than by conventional Italian neorealist roots. His Partner (68) is a portrait of modern intellectual man; The Conformist (69) and The Spider's Strategy (70) both deal ostensibly with Italy's fascist past but are philosophically complex works with a more visually assured and less gran- diose style than his earlier features. As- sistant to Pasolini on Accattone* (61) and has scripted all his own films.

He made the brilliant Salt of the Earth* in 1954 and spent much of his time thereafter in political and social agitation against the Holly- wood system. He did not make another film until 1968, Slaves, an often bril- liantly structured analysis of 19th-century slavery in America. bielek, PaPo DiR Czechoslovakia.
