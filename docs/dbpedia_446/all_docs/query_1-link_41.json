        "text": "Vogue representatives at the Met Gala confirmed Rihanna would not be attending before they shuttered the carpet.\n\nPeople magazine reported just a little while ago that the multihyphenate had the flu. A representative for Rihanna did not immediately confirm the reason for the confirmed attendee’s absence.\n\nSanya Tawakley, 21, was among the crowd watching the departures outside the Mark hotel after first trying to reach the front of the Met (“that was a bust,” she said). A student at the Fashion Institute of Technology living in New York for the first time, she said she wanted to come to see the looks.\n\nShe arrived at 5:30 p.m. — a little too late to see Tyla, but just in time to see Jonathan Bailey, Doja Cat and the models led out by Karlie Kloss. She also got a glimpse of Cardi B, who reached her hand out of the umbrella fortress that had been hiding her look to tease the fans chanting her name.\n\n“This was a night for the girls,” she said. “I honestly think in terms of favorites: Doja killed it. Ironically, she was iconic for wearing a towel.”\n\nTawakley studies communication design.\n\n“It was honestly just so much fun in terms of everyone standing there judging the looks, it was like community bonding,” she said.\n\nPet couturier Anthony Rubio recreated the best 12 looks from this year’s Met Gala for his Pet Gala in New York. (May 25)\n\nYou’re putting together a list of your favorite looks from the evening. And now you may be yearning: “If only I could see dogs adorned in such garb!”\n\nWell, you’re in luck. Designer Anthony Rubio throws a Pet Gala in the weeks following its human-centric namesake. This year’s edition will take place on the third Monday in May — May 20. For $300 a ticket, Rubio promises a bevy of dogs in recreations of looks from the Met Gala.\n\n“The designers for The Met Gala have months to create their looks for celebrities to shine on the red carpet. I have two weeks to recreate them and for dogs,” Rubio says on the ticket site.\n\n“For The Pet Gala, I have to figure out how to translate garments worn by humans onto our four-legged stars,” he continues. “Humans can suffer for their fashion, but dogs will not. Their comfort and safety is my top priority.”\n\nThe Vogue livestream may be down, but the Met Gala carpet isn’t yet closed to couture.\n\nThe scene is chaotic, although the line of celebrities has slowed somewhat. Despite guests being summoned to dinner more than a half-hour ago, the new arrivals are leisurely making their way up the stairs.\n\nCamila Cabello may be feeling the lateness more than most, though — her bag was a block of ice with a rose in it. It was dripping all over the carpet.\n\nRemember Choupette? Karl Lagerfeld’s beloved cat whose presence was sorely missed at last year’s Met Gala honoring her late owner (though many an attendee paid her homage)?\n\nWell, she didn’t make it this year, either. Flowers aren’t too good for cats. But she does appear to be doing well.\n\n“Hey, folks! While I might not be the most active on social media, things are hopping at home, especially with my new friend who keeps me on my toes!” Choupette — or her opposable thumb-equipped oracle — posted on Instagram a few days ago. She’s acquired a new, plainer feline sibling named Siara.\n\nPamela Anderson has been going makeup-free to public events lately, but she appeared to break the streak for the Met Gala. It wasn’t a return to the overly done Baywatch days, however. She chose a natural, soft, glowing look to pair with her blush Oscar de la Renta.\n\nShe told People magazine previously that her barefaced looks were “freeing, and fun, and a little rebellious too” and that she was “glad it became a positive message.”\n\nAn Indian entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist is dropping the internets’ collective jaw on a red carpet dominated by some of the biggest names in popular culture.\n\nWearing a nude Iris Van Herpen gown with fluttering butterflies along both sleeves, Mona Patel was styled by Law Roach, whose celebrity roster includes 2024 Met Gala co-chair Zendaya.\n\nPatel, however, is no movie star. She is a Forbes Next 1000 honoree whose health care ventures include a company that uses artificial intelligence to help radiologists work more efficiently.\n\nBut it’s her nonprofit work that may have landed the woman known as “Haute Mona” inside fashion’s biggest night. Motivated by the patriarchal pressure Patel said she felt growing up in India, “Couture for Cause” auctions distinctive, made-to-measure clothing and hosts global campaigns to improve girls’ access to higher education and healthcare.\n\nIt’s almost dinner time. Tonight’s meal has been designed and provided by Olivier Cheng Catering. Dinner will be in the Temple of Dendur. There will be “tablescapes” of “enchanted candelabras entwined with floral arrangements, further transporting guests inside a fairytale narrative.” Here’s what’s on the menu:\n\nTo start: medley of spring vegetables paired with olive soil, elderflower foam and raspberry vinaigrette (no, that’s not a typo for “olive oil”)\n\nMain course: filet of beef, pea tortellini, morels and spring vegetables\n\nDessert: assortment of petits fours inspired by the Brothers’ Grimm fairytale of — yep — Sleeping Beauty and a selection of “confections in the shape of bespoke hats”\n\n7:08 p.m.: Kris Jenner, in white Oscar de la Renta, chats with La La Anthony on the carpet, with Corey Gamble. “It’s just a wonderful night and we get to see the kids in a little while,” Jenner said. Anthony asked when her best friend, Kim Kardashian, would arrive. “Any minute,” Jenner said. “You know Kim.”\n\n7:23 p.m.: Fresh from the Tom Brady roast, and undeterred by the previous night’s boos, Kim Kardashian seems to be spotted leaving The Mark, under cover of multiple umbrellas.\n\n7:41 p.m.: Kim Kardashian posts a series of photos on Instagram previewing her silver Maison Margiela by John Galliano, showing off a tiny waistline that might make Scarlett O’Hara faint.\n\n7:46 p.m.: Kendall Jenner walks the Met carpet in archival Givenchy by Alexander McQueen from 1999. She tells Anthony that she’s the first human to wear it. “I couldn’t do any tailoring … but it just fit perfectly,” she told Vogue. “It was meant to be.”\n\n7:53 p.m.: Kim Kardashian, sporting platinum blonde hair, appears on the carpet.\n\n8 p.m.: Kylie Jenner is on the carpet.\n\nAn AP photographer outside the gala says protesters have begun moving away from the vicinity of the Met Gala.\n\nPolice ordered protesters to stay on the sidewalks and stay off the roadway. If they don’t comply, they were threatened with arrest for disorderly conduct. Photos showed a protester being detained, but New York police have not yet confirmed any arrests.\n\nColman Domingo said he took inspiration from the late Chadwick Boseman for tonight’s look. The “Rustin” star emerged as one of Hollywood’s most-watched dressers last awards season as he took forward-looking approaches for leading men’s fashion.\n\nWearing Willy Chavarria, Domingo described the 2024 Met Gala as the “cherry on top” of a “magical year.” He named the iconic “Black Panther” actor and Chicano culture as influences for his strong-shouldered cream jacket and loose black trousers.\n\n“All of it feels hot and street and sexy,” Domingo told Vogue.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters marched from Hunter College toward the Metropolitan Museum of Art as the gala was underway. The protesters were chanting and clapping as they marched, and some held signs that read “Free free Palestine” and “Revolution will be live, free Gaza.”\n\nThe protesters tried to skirt police to get closer to the event, per livestreams, but the security cordons around the gala are pretty extensive. An AP photo shows NYPD arresting one protester nearby.\n\nThe four celebrity co-chairs have arrived in a range of styles both traditional and bold — but all dressed by some of the most acclaimed designers.\n\nJennifer Lopez donned custom Schiaparelli. A 13-time veteran of the Met Gala, Lopez wore a sheer gown with sparkling rhinestones.\n\nZendaya went all-in on “The Garden of Time” theme in custom Maison Margiela. The “Challengers” star wore a blue and green dress adorned with a mockingbird and bunches of grapes.\n\nAlso wearing Maison Margiela was Bad Bunny. Holding a black floral bouquet, the Puerto Rican singer had on a navy jacket with red details inside his pants legs and a poofy beret-esque hat.\n\nChris Hemsworth, the first-time host who has joked that he is not fashionable, wore a tan Tom Ford suit. The Australian actor dressed things down a bit, foregoing a tie and leaving several shirt buttons undone.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Chew is no stranger to the red carpet. Like the technology giants that preceded his company’s rise to prominence — Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, for example — he has previously attended the Met Gala.\n\nBut that appearance came in 2022, before U.S. lawmakers began cracking down on TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company over national security concerns. Designated by Anna Wintour as an honorary chair for this year’s benefit — TikTok is the gala’s chief sponsor this year — Chew is expected to return for fashion’s biggest night out.\n\nIt’s unlikely he will be greeted with the same skepticism he got from Congress earlier this year during a nearly six-hour grilling over ByteDance’s safety policies. But if celebrity attendees serve viral looks tonight like they’ve done in the past, it’s almost certain that the 2024 Met Gala will be one that generates plenty of content for TikTok’s 170 million U.S. users."
