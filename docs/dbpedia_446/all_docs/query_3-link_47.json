        "text": "“ Even Rocky had to take a couple of lessons before he got back in the ring with Clubber Lang. ” - John Peter McAllister\n\nFor the episode, see MST3K 322 - Master Ninja I.\n\nMaster Ninja I is a feature-length presentation assembled from two episodes of the 1984 TV series The Master. It was followed by several additional such features, starting with Master Ninja II (used in Experiment #324).\n\nPlot[]\n\nMax Keller, a hot-headed young man with a strong sense of justice, encounters John Peter McAllister. McAllister has returned to America after spending nearly forty years in Japan studying the ninja arts after his service in World War II. McAllister has come to America to find the now-adult daughter that he never knew that he had. Max convinces McAllister to train him as a ninja, in exchange for which Max will help McAllister in his search. They are followed by Okasa, a former pupil of McAllister's who wants to kill him.\n\nThe duo finds themselves embroiled in the case of the Trumbull family who own an independent airfield. Greedy land developers are trying to force the Trumbulls off their property. Max and McAllister expose the plot and save the Trumbulls' airfield.\n\nMax and McAllister then travel to a nightclub where they find a dancer friend of McAllister's daughter.

The credits effects have near-constant double images that make the visuals difficult to follow, in addition to the washed-out colors and poor lighting. The film also appears to be taken from an overseas PAL copy converted to US NTSC standard (framerate conversion explaining the double images), meaning the audio is slightly higher pitched than normal.\n\nMaster Ninja I was assembled from the episodes \"Max\" (the series premiere) and \"Out-of-Time-Step\".\n\nThe entire The Master TV series was released on VHS by Trans World Entertainment as numerical Master Ninja titles. Some releases identify it as The Master Ninja.\n\nThe entire series of The Master was released on DVD & Blu-Ray in February of 2018.\n\nMST3K Connections[]\n\nDirector Ray Austin was also director for Master Ninja II.\n\nWriter and executive producer Michael Sloan was also executive producer for Master Ninja II.\n\nLee Van Cleef also portrayed Dr. Tom Anderson in It Conquered the World and would reprise his role as John Peter McAllister in Master Ninja II.\n\nTimothy Van Patten would reprise his role as Max Keller in Master Ninja II.\n\nActor and stunt coordinator Sho Kosugi would reprise his role as Okasa and was stunt coordinator in Master Ninja II.\n\nClu Gulager also portrayed Bob Hatten in San Francisco International.\n\nBill McKinney also portrayed Chief Wilson in Final Justice.\n\nW.T.
