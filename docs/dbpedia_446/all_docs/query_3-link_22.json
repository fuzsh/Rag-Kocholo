        "text": "Tallulah Willis, daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, disclosed on Friday that she received an autism diagnosis last summer. In an Instagram post featuring an old video of her and her father, she humorously hinted at her diagnosis.\n\n\"tell me your [sic] autistic without telling me your [sic] autistic,\" she wrote.\n\nThis revelation came in response to a follower's query about her diagnosis, marking the first time she publicly discussed it.\n\n\"Found out this summer and it's changed my life,\" Tallulah replied.\n\nTallulah described her discovery as life-changing, referring to herself as \"neurospicy\" in a subsequent comment.\n\nOpen about her mental health struggles\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by a range of conditions affecting social skills, behavior, and communication.\n\nTallulah has been open about her mental health struggles, including her battle with anorexia and diagnoses of ADHD, depression, and borderline personality disorder.\n\n\"I'm having an intens [sic] moment of romanticizing unhealthy times and how it felt to move through the day in that size body,\" she posted on Instagram last month.\n\n\"Just wanted to voice it because I know (hope) I'm not alone.\"\n\nShe underwent treatment for these issues at Driftwood Recovery in Texas in June 2022. Despite her personal challenges, Tallulah remains candid about her journey to recovery and continues to share her experiences to raise awareness and foster understanding about mental health issues.\n\n\"I realized that what I wanted more than harmony with my body was harmony with my family - to no longer worry them, to bring a levity to my sisters and my parents,\" she noted."
