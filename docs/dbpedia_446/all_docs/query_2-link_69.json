        "text": "Over the years, Kyle Richards' husband Mauricio Umansky has become a beloved face on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills — but fans never get to know the Househusbands as well as we do the 'Wives. If we're going to ask the big question — \"Who is Mauricio?\" — we might as well start from the beginning.\n\n\"My husband is in real estate. Very high end real estate,\" shared Kyle in Season 1, Episode 1 as a clip of Mauricio (manning the grill) rolled. \"I'm very fortunate that my husband is successful enough that I don't have to work. I do miss it sometimes and I do work occasionally, but the most important thing to me is being a mom.\"\n\nTheir relationship hit a rough patch while filming Season 13 and the two separated, but they are still trying to figure out whether they can fix their marriage.\n\n\"We were never fighters, we're not a toxic couple, so we've been able to manage that so far. It's gonna go one way or the other, you know? We're either going to wake up and be like, 'Oh my gosh! We could actually fix this,' or it's going to be divorce,\" Kyle told ET on Valentine's Day.\n\nIn Season 13, Episode 16, the two talked about how couple's therapy had been going.\n\n\"We've gone through a tough few months, a tough year, whatever you want to call it, right?\" Mauricio said. \"Having a session with him helps me be more in-tune with myself.\"\n\nLook back on Mauricio's life in his pictures below, from his childhood in Mexico to his early years with Kyle and their daughters.\n\nBaby Mauricio Umansky\n\nWhen Mauricio was a child, he had a blood disease called neutropenia, leading him to spend a lot of time in the hospital. According to Mayo Clinic, the disease \"occurs when you have too few neutrophils, a type of white blood cells. While all white blood cells help your body fight infections, neutrophils are important for fighting certain infections, especially those caused by bacteria.\"\n\nDuring Season 10, Episode 10, Kyle and Mauricio hosted a fundraiser for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. During the episode, the former child star revealed she chose to support the cause because of her husband's childhood health issues.\n\n\"When we think about where we want to put our energy and our appreciation into, it's Children's Hospital Los Angeles,\" she shared.\n\nMauricio Umansky as a Baby with His Father Eduardo Umansky\n\nBorn in Mexico to parents Estella Sneider and Eduardo Umansky, Mauricio entered the world on June 25, 1970. Today, Estella is a psychologist and sex therapist. Eduardo is also in real estate; he previously worked at Hilton & Hyland with Mauricio before joining him at The Agency.\n\nWhile sharing a throwback photo of her dad and his parents in 2021, Mauricio's second-youngest daughter Sophia Umansky noted that her father and his father have a striking resemblance.\n\n\"Am I the only one who thought that Eduardo was present day Mau?\" she captioned the snap.\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky with His Sister Sharon\n\nMauricio has one sibling: His little sister Sharon. Over the years, Sharon has made a few appearances on RHOBH, with the most recent being a cameo alongside her husband Kendall in Season 12, Episode 10, when she attended a Hanukkah party at the Umansky-Richards residence.\n\n\"When I made the commitment to convert [to Judaism], I always knew that I would bring this into my home and celebrate these holidays,\" shared Kyle in the episode as everyone gathered around to light the menorah.\n\nSharon, for her part, got a kick out of Dorit Kemsley's son Jagger reciting the story of Hanukkah.\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky at the Pool\n\nThe Umansky family lived in Mexico until Mauricio was six years old, when they all moved to the United States.\n\nToday, Mauricio's daughters speak Spanish. His family is also Greek and Russian (while Kyle's is Irish and Welsh), so the Umansky girls have grown up with a wide array of cultural experiences.\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky Riding a Horse\n\nWhile we've seen plenty of Housewives ride horseback over the years (in some precarious situations), I'm not sure we've ever seen Mauricio mount a pony...until now. Here, a very happy little Mauricio takes an (also little) horse for a spin.\n\nIn Season 8, Episode 16, we learned that Kyle is allergic to horses, which might explain why Mauricio is rarely seen with one, although he and his team did attend The Hamptons Classic horse show in September 2023.\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky in a Sweater\n\nWhy is Mauricio counting to six in this photo? It might be his sixth birthday, which would date this photo June of 1976. That explains the style of the sweater, but not why he'd be wearing a sweater in June.\n\nRELATED: Who Is Mauricio Umansky from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?\n\nMauricio Umansky at His Bar Mitzvah\n\nAs RHOBH fans know, Mauricio is Jewish. While we don't have any ready-for-TV footage from his personal bar mitzvah party (just this amazing photo), fans did see another important coming-of-age event in his life: his youngest daughter Portia's bat mitzvah.\n\nIn October 2021, Portia celebrated the occasion with a circus-themed party. At the event, she and Mauricio danced to Lady Gaga’s cover of “La Vie En Rose” and were joined by Kyle's then-fellow RHOBH cast members including Lisa Rinna, Dorit, Crystal Kung Minkoff, and Sutton Stracke.\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky and His Mother\n\nThis picture of Mauricio and mom Estella in matching outfits on vacation should be hung in the Louvre.\n\nOver the years, Mauricio's love of travel has been apparent on RHOBH. His family is often jetting off to their home-away-from-home in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nHe's also regularly traveling to open up new offices for The Agency, though there's no location in France (yet). In June 2022, the company's first European office opened in the Netherlands.\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky Dressed Up\n\nDid you know that Mauricio's first calling was actually fashion? When he was newly out of college, he started a women's clothing company called 90265 (after the zip code in Malibu).\n\n\"That did quite well — I started the fad of oversized T-shirts on girls wearing leggings,\" he shared in a 2014 interview with Worth Magazine. \"At 26, I sold the company and had to figure out my next life. I have always had a love of sales and a love of architecture, and the combination brought me into real estate. My first job was at Hilton & Hyland, a boutique firm in Beverly Hills co-owned by my brother-in-law, Rick Hilton.\"\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky and Mother Estella\n\nMauricio's mom, Estella, is an RHOBH icon in her own right. During Season 2, Episode 9, she went under the knife for a facelift with Dr. Paul Nassif.\n\n\"My mother in law Estella had been considering a facelift. She is 61 years old and looks amazing,\" shared Kyle in a BravoTV.com blog at the time. \"I have always been proud that she had never done anything to her face — very rare around here. When Alexia was a little girl, she asked my mom why so many of her friends looked like cats. We all died laughing!\"\n\n\"I knew that if Estella was going to have the facelift, there was only one doctor to go to — Dr. Paul Nassif,\" Kyle aded. \"He has an incredible reputation, not only for being a gifted surgeon, but for having an incredible bedside manner.\"\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky with Kyle Richards and Kim Richards\n\nWhen Mauricio married Kyle, he became part of her larger family, including her daughter, Farrah, and her sisters, Kim Richards and Kathy Hilton.\n\nToday, the feminine energy and Richards genes surrounding Mauricio is even stronger: Kyle and Mauricio also share daughters Alexia (born in 1996), Sophia (born in 2000), and Portia (born in 2008).\n\nYoung Mauricio Umansky and Kyle Richards\n\nKyle and Mauricio first met in 1994, when both were in their early 20s. In 2021, Kyle told The Knot that their meet-cute took place at the nightclub Bar One after Mauricio worked up the courage to approach her (he thought she was actress Demi Moore's sister).\n\nRELATED: Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky's Marriage: A Timeline\n\n\"I figured if I couldn't get Demi Moore, I could try to get her sister!\" Mauricio joked in the interview, going on to note that he got something \"much better.\"\n\nKyle, for her part, was attracted to how they had common interests and goals. He was also sweet with her daughter, Farrah.\n\nMauricio Umansky in 2011\n\nWhile Mauricio has never been an actor, he does have a soft spot for reality TV.\n\nBesides RHOBH, he appears Buying Beverly Hills, which focuses on The Agency."
