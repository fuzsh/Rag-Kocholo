        "text": "Demi Moore gave the audience a piece of her mind while introducing Cher at a charity event in France on Thursday.\n\nTaking to the stage at the amfAR Cinema Against AIDS Gala in Cap d’Antibes, the 61-year-old actress didn’t hold back while demanding respect for the Believe hitmaker, 78, before the superstar made her entrance.\n\nIn a video taken by co-Editor in Chief of Variety, Ramon Setoodeh at Cannes Film Festival 2024 and posted on X, staring into the audience Demi said: ‘I’m going to see if this is the moment we’ve all been waiting for.’\n\nSeemingly waiting for the audience to get on board the Cher hype with her, Demi continued: ‘I’m just making sure that you’re really, really with me. Because this incredible woman that I’m about to introduce – she’s a Grammy winner, an Oscar winner, an Emmy winner.’\n\nThen staring at someone in her view, Demi unexpectedly said: ‘Are you an Emmy winner over there in the back of the room? I f*****g don’t think so.’\n\n‘She’s a style icon and my personal hair inspiration,’ Dami added, concluding: ‘She is just one of the most talented, successful, and best-loved performers of all time.\n\n‘So please,’ she added, before another loaded long pause as she stared out into the audience, appearing to be agitated.\n\n‘Please give a warm welcome to the incredible, one and only Cher,’ she finished, before the icon took to the stage.\n\nFans commented on the video with mixed reactions, as Lawrence Stern wrote, ‘Iconic,’ while Kyle Bergslien tried to imagine what Demi was thinking, as he said: ‘She said, I will treat you like a child until you learn respect.’\n\nX user @jaywhohuh asked: ‘Why did she keep pausing like that? What a weird way to introduce Cher?’\n\nIt wasn’t clear from the audio in the video whether the Ghost actress was reacting to something specific the audience were doing, or if she was trying to be playful but it didn’t translate.\n\nThe star looked incredible for the evening in a plunge silver dress, slick long hair and a gorgeous glistening necklace, while Cher took to the stage wearing a black combat-style suit.\n\nHeidi Klum posted videos of the evening – which did appear to host a rowdy audience – as Cher strutted and down the stage with her blonde hair in waves, performing an array of bangers.\n\nAfter a spritely rendition of Waterloo by Abba, Cher had a change of costume as she donned a shiny leotard, leather jacket and wore her hair in tight curls for If I Could Turn Back Time and Believe, as she skipped around the stage to an enraptured crowd.\n\nOn the red carpet earlier in the evening, the pair posed together as they attended the night alongside Cher’s Def Jam music executive boyfriend Alexander, 38.\n\nThis comes after Demi defended the extreme violence and nudity her comeback film, dubbed the most grotesque film since Saltburn. Gulp.\n\nThe Substance, directed by Revenge creator Coralie Fargeat, premiered at the French festival last week and received the longest standing ovation at 13 minutes (anything under 5 minutes is regarded as a snub at the festival).\n\nThe Palme d’Or contender sees Demi star as Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading Hollywood actor who discovers an experimental medical procedure to combat ageing.\n\nShe stars alongside Margaret Qualley, Hugo Diego Garcia, and Dennis Quaid, who replaced Ray Liotta in the film following his death aged 67 in 2022.\n\nTalking about making the film, Demi praised Qualley as being a ‘great partner’ to share scenes with – one of which sees them entangled in a particularly bloody fight scene.\n\n‘We were obviously quite close at some moments…and naked. But there was also a levity [in shooting those scenes],’ she told the crowd (per The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nShe said the film ‘pushed her out of her comfort zone’ but that the explicit imagery was ‘necessary to tell this story.’\n\nDemi shared that The Substance shifts ‘the male perspective of the ideal woman’, assuring attendees at the press conference that she and Fargeat are ‘not anti-men, we’re anti-jerks’ when asked if the film condemns men.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : George Lucas insists Star Wars is ‘not a spaceship movie’\n\nMORE : The 7 most shocking Cannes Film Festival movies that caused the most walkouts"
