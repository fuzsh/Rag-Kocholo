I think the first audition was great and the screen test, I shanked, I got in my head.\n\nThe actor, who went on to find stardom thanks to appearances in Ghost and Indecent Proposal, said: “I just got nervous and I didn’t own it.\n\n“But in my beating myself up, it then just reinforced the idea that I didn’t think I was good enough,“ she added\n\nMoore went on to star with Cruise in 1992 drama A Few Good Men.\n\n45 films you never realised were banned\n\nShow all 46\n\nIn the same interview, Moore discussed the rape she suffered as a teenager. In her newly released memoir, Inside Out, the actor said she was 15 when she was attacked by a friend of her mother’s.\n\nShe said: “I felt trapped, I didn’t want [it] and I was clear that I didn’t. I felt like it was my fault. I felt like I had behaved in a way that was mature like I really knew a lot. I never really looked at myself as being a kid. I never looked at it as rape.”\n\nShe added: “I saw it as unfortunate, I was very embarrassed by it.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Agencies.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
