        "text": "Zendaya returns with second look\n\nZendaya, who co-chaired this year's gala, surprised people with a second look.\n\nShe returned to the carpet after the livestreams had wrapped wearing a 1996 Givenchy black gown and a 2007 bouquet-inspired headpiece from Alexander McQueen, according to Harper’s BAZAAR.\n\nWhat happens after the red carpet?\n\nWhile the red carpet certainly feels like the Met's main event, the stars are now enjoying the actual festivities, which include dinner and a performance by a yet-to-be-revealed artist.\n\nThere's a strict no-phones policy inside, but photos of celebs enjoying the exclusive evening usually emerge by the end of the evening.\n\nNo Rihanna sighting on the carpet\n\nRihanna, who is a Met Gala mainstay, was not spotted on the red carpet throughout the duration of Vogue's livestream.\n\nThe singer arrived very late to last year's event. Although she recently teased her Met Gala look in an interview with Extra, some outlets reported that she ended up skipping the event this year.\n\nA spokesperson for the artist did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nCamila Cabello is dripped out with a purse made of ice\n\nThe singer, who announced her upcoming album today, said her purse was a block of ice that melted into a clutch by the time she reached the Met's stairs.\n\nShe said the accessory evoked the idea of \"impermanence\" and was partially inspired by her new album: \"Things are melting, it's hot,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\"\n\nAmanda Seyfried debuts a fresh color\n\nAmanda Seyfried used the Met Gala red carpet to debut a major hair change. The actor's new silver-blue hair was styled in a bun with a vinelike gemstone headpiece and old Hollywood curls framing her face.\n\nHer silver Prada gown is adorned with glittering pink flowers, and she added another pop of color to her look with bright purple lipstick.\n\nCardi B clears the Met Gala carpet with her voluminous train\n\nThe rapper's black gown from Giambattista Valli consumed the entire bottom part of the carpet as she arrived on the steps.\n\nBroadway takes the Met Gala\n\nThe lights of the Great White Way are typically dark on Mondays. Stars of some of Broadway's biggest hits made their way to the Met on their night off.\n\nJonathan Groff, Eddie Redmayne, Elle Fanning, Jeremy Strong and Sarah Paulson all walked the red carpet tonight.\n\nThe red carpet livestreams have come to an end\n\nThe red carpet livestreams have shuttered as celebs head inside to enjoy the rest of their night.\n\nDemi Lovato is working on new music\n\nLovatics, assemble! Demi Lovato revealed that she is working on new music.\n\n\"I'm in the studio right now working on new music,\" Lovato said on the E! carpet. \"Hopefully it will be out in the near future.\"\n\nElle Fanning is still the perfect Sleeping Beauty\n\nIf anyone could embody this year's theme, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" it's Sleeping Beauty herself. The actor played the role of Aurora in the 2014 film \"Maleficent.\"\n\nTonight, she's wearing a custom Balmain dress with icelike birds atop the shoulders.\n\nLewis Hamilton's Burberry fit pays tribute to Britain's first Black gardener\n\nLewis Hamilton, one of the top stars in Formula 1 racing, told Vogue that his outfit is inspired by John Ystumllyn, the first Black gardener in Britain.\n\nHe also said a quote from a poem by Alex Wharton is embroidered into his coat lining. Hamilton is known for uplifting and highlighting Black artists and designers at the Met Gala.\n\nLily Gladstone is sparkling at her first Met Gala\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon” and \"Under the Bridge\" star Lily Gladstone, who finished a historic awards run this year, is attending her first Met Gala tonight.\n\nThe actor is wearing a bedazzled Gabriela Hearst gown with a matching sheer cape that resemble the night sky. She told The New York Times that her Indigenous roots inspired the gown.\n\n\"We say we come from the stars,” she said.\n\nKylie Jenner goes for classic cream-colored gown\n\nKylie Jenner opted for an ethereal cream gown at this year's Met Gala after wearing bold colors last year.\n\nHer look was a custom design by Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia of Oscar de la Renta, inspired by garden statues, according to Vogue. Garden statues were mentioned in \"The Garden of Time,\" the J.G.
