        "text": "There are reports today that actress Demi Moore has been hospitalized for \"exhaustion.\" TMZ says that Moore was rushed to the hospital on Monday night. There is speculation that substance abuse might have been involved. Moore has also dropped out of a biopic about porn star Linda Lovelace.\n\nMoore's publicist says:\n\nBecause of the stresses in her life right now, Demi has chosen to seek professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and improve her overall health. She looks forward to getting well and is grateful for the support of her family and friends.\n\nAll of this on the heels of her divorce from husband of six years Ashton Kutcher.\n\nSince the two announced their split a few weeks ago I've done several interviews (like this one) about what the divorce means for the two stars from a financial point of view. It's not a nice picture. With his new role on Two and a Half Men Kutcher is on a roll. He's earning an estimated $700,000 per episode and doing a very rough back-of-the-envelope estimate I think that between his show, restaurants and investments Kutcher earned $11 million in the last 12 months.\n\nMoore hasn't done quite as well. The star still gets residuals from her older movies and she does ads for Ann Taylor but it's been a long time since Moore had a starring role. With her standout performance in the tiny movie Margin Call it looked like Moore might be on the verge of launching something like a comeback. But the hospitalization will likely put any career surge on hold.\n\nThe sad truth here is that at 33, Kutcher is at the height of his earning potential. At 49, Moore has passed that point. While men are allowed to age gracefully in Hollywood and continue landing starring roles in dramas and action films well into their 50s (just look at the cast of The Expendables which earned $274 million at the box office), women don't get those same opportunities. The best a woman of 50 can hope for is a career like Meryl Streep's. The star has had great success finding juicy roles for older women. She recently earned her 17th Oscar nomination for The Iron Lady.\n\nBut not every actress is Meryl Streep and too many women fade into obscurity because they can't find good work.\n\nIt can't help Moore's equilibrium that her younger husband has been constantly in the tabloids with other, younger, women. What Moore is dealing with is the realities of why Hollywood is so rough for women writ large.\n\nIf Moore can overcome her current problems, she of course has potential. Moore recently went behind the lense to direct a piece for the Lifetime film Five about women living with breast cancer. And while it gets harder for women to find roles in the movies as they age, TV has become a great provider of work for older actresses. Just look at recent impressive turns by Glenn Close, Holly Hunter and Kyra Sedgwick.\n\nIt will be a great thing if we see Moore rise up from this and enter a second phase of her career. I know many women are hoping for it."
