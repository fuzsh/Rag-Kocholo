She first gained attention on daytime television before breaking out as a film star in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, she was the highest-paid actress at the time.[14] She has earned several accolades, including nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globes.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Occupations ...\n\nClose\n\nMoore began acting in 1981, and appeared on the soap opera General Hospital (1982–1984).[15] After departing the show, she rose to prominence as a member of the Brat Pack, starring in the films Blame It on Rio (1984), St. Elmo's Fire (1985), and About Last Night...
