        "text": "Anna Always On Brand\n\nVogue editor-in-chief and Met Gala co-chair Anna Wintour is decidedly on-theme in a floor-length black jacket embroidered with a colorful spray of flowers. A vine-like diamond brooch complements the botanical look along with a queenly necklace that marks her as the reigning royalty here today.\n\nWicked Witch of the Web\n\nFormer Rolling Stone cover star Emma Chamberlain goes goth, channeling the “Sleeping Beauty” theme (and evil queen?) in a lace black gown with dark makeup. The 22-year-old may be best known as a sweet and bubbly content creator, but on this night, she’s showing off a decidedly more wicked streak.\n\nLong Live Queen Z\n\nZendaya strut down the Met Gala carpet in a peacock-inspired gown designed by John Galliano for Maison Margiela Artisanal. The dress features a drape and bow created from aluminum and organza, and a hand-painted veil and hat wrapped in stockings. Now that’s what we call a showpiece.\n\nK-Pop Royalty\n\nIt’s royal blue for K-pop royalty, as Blackpink’s Jennie makes her return to the Met Gala carpet. Just like the multi-faceted star, Jennie’s gown is a multi-dimensional masterpiece, showing off her toned legs and midriff in the front, with a sweeping train at the back. Now that’s how you shut it down.\n\nFuriosa Fashion\n\nChris Hemsworth avoids both the armored aesthetic of Thor and the unkempt look of his post-apocalyptic warlord character in the upcoming Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. He does show off a little chest, however, with an unbuttoned shirt underneath a simple tan three-piece suit. Does it scream “Garden of Time”? Not really, but he is wearing a (Chopard) watch.\n\nCan’t Get Enough\n\nThis is her… now. Jennifer Lopez proves she still has few, if any, equals when it comes to attending events in precariously revealing clothes. This time around, it’s Tiffany jewels and a silvery custom Schiaparelli gown that leaves little to the imagination and flares outward with wings up top (while trailing a lacy train behind that a couple of tuxedoed assistants have taken great pains to carry and position for photos).\n\nNothing Bad About It\n\nIf this gala is all about looking unflappable in fashions that verge on the absurd, then Bad Bunny has struck the ideal entrance — wearing the first big hat of the night. That puffy medieval headgear, combined with the angular sunglasses, black blazer (apparently still bearing a tailor’s chalk marks), and red-striped pants give him the air of a musketeer (or a matador from the future).\n\n5-Star Fashion\n\nStray Kids made their Met Gala debut in coordinating Tommy Hilfiger looks that were custom-designed to match this year’s theme, while staying true to Tommy’s All-American aesthetic. Always one to have fun with fashion, the K-pop group turned up in bespoke navy overcoats before doffing them to reveal their matching red, white and blue suits.\n\nPortrait Perfect\n\nOne hopes there are no bees inside the Met: in a year when most went literal on the “garden” element of the theme, Nicki Minaj’s Marni dress is absolutely exploding with brightly colored petals. The saturated tones and roughed-in style have her looking like she just stepped out of a Matisse painting.\n\nSlaying the Fashion Game\n\nThe Game of Thrones star is no stranger to drama and she delivers on all fronts with this maroon gown, sculpted blond hair and black sheer cape. Forget surviving the red wedding: Christie slays the red carpet.\n\nDelivering on Dapper\n\nThere’s no beef with this outfit from Steven Yeun, who paired an embroidered three-piece suit with army-style black boots. And while other stars showed up on the carpet with a date or statement bag, Yeun’s accessory for the night was decidedly more practical: an umbrella.\n\nModel Goes Metal\n\nModel Ashley Graham turns heads in spiky bangs and a custom form-fitting black gown by Ludovic de Saint Sernin. Decked out with metal and Swarovski crystal and Jared jewelry, Graham shared on Instagram that the piece took 500 hours of hand work to bring to life.\n\nBroadway Baby (Bump)\n\nDid Lea Michele just reveal her pregnancy – and the gender of her child – on the Met Gala carpet? The Broadway star debuted her baby bump in a powder blue dress that has us whipped up in baby fever (or just a cotton candy dream).\n\nRisky Business\n\nTroye Sivan is giving business meets bondage in this Prada fit, which plays off the luxury label’s classic suiting with an edgy twist. Always want to subvert fashion (and music) trends, Sivan’s appearance kicks off a busy season for the popstar, who’s slated to head out on tour with Charli XCX this summer.\n\nA Lofty Lana Look\n\nLana says yes to an elaborate gauzy headpiece — a custom Alexander McQueen inspired by a similar piece from the late designer’s 2011 retrospective exhibit, “Savage Beauty.” Instead of deer antlers, this take puts the emphasis on a pattern of thorny brambles that wind around her sand-colored gown and up through the veil.\n\nNot a Barbie Girl\n\nAfter a year of thinking pink, Barbie director Greta Gerwig opts for all-black (and trousers) on the Met Gala carpet. Gerwig broke box office records with the Barbie film and she’s breaking from tradition here with her monochromatic look, but in our opinion, it’s yes, more than kenough.\n\nLovin’ on Jack\n\nJack Harlow makes a return appearance to the Met Gala in a sharp, gray suit with contrast-color lapel. He doesn’t need no whips and chains to work in a theme either, giving a nod to the “garden” dress code with a small bouquet of flowers pin.\n\nLike Sands Through the Hourglass\n\nSinger Tyla may well win the award for most creative interpretation of the theme, stunning as a human hourglass in a sands-of-time-inspired custom Balmain gown that may as well be painted on. An hourglass accessory — who needs a functional purse tonight? — ensures that there’s no mistaking this sublime concept.\n\nBaila Conmigo\n\nRauw Alejandro brings reggaeton to the red carpet in another standout Ludovic de Saint Sernin look for the night. This time, the Puerto Rican star goes glam in a glittery disco ball top and cream suit that’s as suitable for the gala as it is for the after-party dance floor.\n\nChallenge Accepted\n\nAfter showing off fancy footwork on the tennis court in Challengers, Josh O’Connor joins a gala co-chaired by co-star Zendaya in what appear to be floral clogs. It’s a whimsical touch matched by his extra-long tuxedo tails for a vibe that’s rather formal above the waist and anything but below.\n\nX Marks the Spot\n\nLil Nas X is no stranger to making a statement on the red carpet but dare we say his look this year is decidedly more… demure? That’s what you get when previous Met Gala looks have included everything from a gold jumpsuit to silver body paint (and not much else). Still, there’s lots to love about this year’s fit, which features a slouchy, oversized silhouette and enough sparkles to light up the room he walks into.\n\nCozy Chic\n\nKim Kardashian is a silver siren in this Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano gown, which features chain and floral accents cut from real mirror fragments. Kim paired the look with a cashmere cardigan, proving that sexy and cozy can seemingly co-exist in one garment.\n\nThe Grande Dame\n\nThe “B” in Cardi B is for big, bold and bouffant as the superstar rapper (literally) took over the carpet in this extraordinary – and exaggerated – gown. Just how big was this dress? It took a team of ten people to help carry the train and set it down just right for photographers.\n\nI Spy\n\nChildish Gambino is giving grown-up tycoon in a Nineties-inspired Saint Laurent suit paired with a taupe brown shirt and oversized tie. The Mr. & Mrs. Smith star is clearly taking notes from his hit Prime Video series, which stars Glober as a stylish secret spy.\n\nSpring Awakening\n\nEaster may be over, but Ayo Edebiri brings a basket of blooms to the Met carpet in this fresh and floral dress. The springtime design perfectly captures the night’s ‘Garden of Time’ theme and proves the Emmy-winner is a force to be reckoned with both on and off-screen.\n\nLizzo Returns\n\nIn one of her first major public appearances since a dramatic “I QUIT” Instagram post in March, evidently prompted by criticism related to allegations of sexual harassment and creating a hostile workplace, Lizzo hits the red carpet in a funnel-shaped Weinsanto design that has divided some viewers. Her speckled eye makeup, meanwhile, has garnered glowing reviews.\n\nStanning Sam Smith\n\nAfter rocking a racecar driver tracksuit in the music video for “Desire,” Sam Smith makes their Met Gala debut in a custom old-world tuxedo by their partner and date for the evening, designer Christian Cowan, that features a sheer chiffon skirt overlay. The singer may have had the quip of the evening: asked by a reporter what they expect from fashion in the future, they replied, “Clothes in my size in stores.”\n\nGiving Us Something\n\nIt’s unlikely anyone will bring a bigger feather boa to this year’s gala than Dua Lipa. She confirms her Radical Optimism with an eye-catching mixture of layers and delicate textures from Marc Jacobs with Tiffany & Co. diamonds. It’s on the busy side, sure, but her confident poses are selling this gothic realness.\n\nWet and Wild\n\nDid we really think Doja Cat was going to show up to the Met Gala in an Amazon towel? Despite earlier photos online, the singer and rapper turned up in a Vetements dress, though she kept the fresh-out-the-shower look – the white gown mimics a wet T-shirt, while her makeup (intentionally) features mascara running down her cheeks.\n\nIt’s Mister Domingo to You\n\nNot many men were born to wear capes but Colman Domingo is one such red-carpet superhero, sweeping into the event with a black-and-cream ensemble by Willy Chavarria that makes for a strikingly elegant silhouette. Like several other attendees, he completes the presentation with a bouquet of flowers — in this case, white calla lilies.\n\nGarden of Gigi\n\nWhile there’s no shortage of flowers on display tonight, Gigi Hadid has taken the idea a step further with a custom white Thom Browne dress that has enough ruffles to resemble a flower in its own right. Even so, it’s festooned with more green vines and light yellow blossoms (and Chopard jewels) — she’s pulling around an entire garden.\n\nRussell Rules Red Carpet\n\nTaylor Russell stuns in a gorgeous Grecian-style gown that channels her inner golden goddess. The Bones and All actress arrived on the Met Gala carpet sans rumored beau Harry Styles, only further proving that this star can shine all on her own.\n\nGo Greta\n\nThere’s no looking past this outfit from Past Lives star Greta Lee, who interprets the night’s theme in a sheer, baby’s breath-inspired dress over (what we assume) is a nude bodysuit. Extra points for the severe bangs and sharp makeup too.\n\nJust Jeff\n\nExpect the eccentric from Jeff Goldblum, who tends to dress like he’s headed to a fashion show no matter what he’s actually doing that day. Here it’s a relatively understated (for him) overcoat with white scarf and gloves — opera gear, basically — though with jeweled pins and shades that give him a slight edge of steampunk villain.\n\nEternal Sunshine\n\nIf the Costume Institute’s new exhibition is titled “Sleeping Beauties,” consider Ariana Grande the fairest of them all. Ari walked, nay fluttered, down the carpet in an intricate kaleidoscope-effect dress with exaggerated wings adorning the side of her face. The singer and co-star Cynthia Erivo made their Met Gala appearance to promote the upcoming musical, Wicked, and this outfit hits all the right notes.\n\nDare to Be Demi\n\nNo half-measures for Demi Moore. Tonight the actress is wearing a heart-shaped creation from Harris Reed that’s bristling with arrows — the floral fabric is repurposed silk wallpaper — as well as a sumptuous Cartier necklace. Apologies to anyone else who came as a reimagined Cupid, because this will be tough to beat.\n\nEscola Es Guapo\n\nIt’s a breakout ensemble from the breakout comedian who stole scenes in Difficult People and Search Party and is now dazzling audiences in their unhinged Off-Broadway show Oh, Mary! Wearing all white — veiled hat, tuxedo jacket and bow tie, and a long skirt — they’ve channeled the spirit of a haunted doll, complete with a wicker lamb basket full of carnations.\n\nElle Enchanted\n\nSince the Costume Institute’s spring 2024 exhibition is called “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” it’s only right that Sleeping Beauty herself would be on the scene in a dress that pays homage to some of the fairy princess’ doting forest companions. Elle Fanning’s ice-like dress is custom sculpted by Balmain."
