        "text": "'I need to speak to the person who designed Demi Moore’s bathroom before I die'\n\nMegan C. Hills10 July 2020\n\nThe words ‘Demi Moore toilet monkey’ are ones we weren’t anticipating to write today, but here we are.\n\nThe Indecent Proposal actor revealed yesterday that she’s launching a brand new podcast from her bathroom. But it was the decor - trapped monkey, Joan of Arc statue and toilet couch - that upstaged the announcement.\n\nAt first glance, it might be hard to establish where in her house Demi Moore is sitting. The floral couch, complete with a coffee table and orchids, suggest she's in a living room. But glimpse into the back corner and you'll spy a loo.\n\nThe first picture was enough to spark many, many questions: Why is there a couch? Is it wise for a bathroom to have a deep pile carpet? Is that a teeny tiny stand for her face mask sitting on the counter?\n\nBut more importantly, why is there a tiny monkey toilet guardian trapped in the stone wall, forced to watch the loo? Is that blue object lodged in the wall next to it an ill-fated predecessor?\n\nThe second picture presents even more questions than the first. Why is there a bathtub mirror? Why is the couch facing the bathtub? Does she keep her towels on the floor and if so, how does she dry them? Is that a dog bed and if so, does her dog sleep in the bathroom?\n\nIf those are windows by the bathtub, does that door lead outside the house? Why is there a life-size statue of Joan of Arc?\n\nMany of Moore’s fans had questions about the set-up, with many asking if she was in her living room or bathroom.\n\nOne commenter wrote: “I think I speak for most when I ask, are you sitting in your bathroom?”\n\nInstagram / @demimoore\n\nAnother wrote, “I can't tell if there's a couch in the bathroom or a toilet in the living room lol.”\n\nRead More\n\nTransfer news LIVE!

In a tweet that swiftly went viral, one user declared they were “starting a slack channel for the sole purpose” of finding out why it existed - garnering over 50k likes.\n\nAnother wrote, \"imagining Demi Moore, driving down the road, spotting a couch, then 'we gotta stop, that would look great in the bathroom.'”\n\nOf course, another hot topic of conversation was the aforementioned toilet monkey. One wrote, “oh to be the tiny monkey overseeing the toilet in Demi Moore’s carpeted bathroom with a Joan of Arc statue and a couch.”\n\nOthers said they “can’t stop thinking about demi Moore's bathroom monkeys”, with one writing that it was “the thing that freaks me out most” about the whole set up.\n\nFor another creative user, Demi Moore’s bathroom was just the hit of inspiration they needed to embark on their own interior design journey.\n\nTaking to Animal Crossing, one user completely recreated Moore’s bathroom to the best of their ability - from her brown carpet, to her orchids, to the confusing and slightly out of frame life-size doll.\n\nWe did a deep dive into Moore’s Instagram to see if we could figure anything else out. And lo and behold, we found a picture of Moore’s Joan of Arc statue in all its glory:\n\nOther pictures also seem to suggest she’s swapped out the furniture in her bathroom, as another picture showed there used to be a red chair in front of the door leading outside (and that yes, her pets do hang out in her loo).\n\nMore questions were raised after we found a picture of Moore and her daughters Tallulah and Rumer.\n\nSitting in front of a fireplace, in a room full of brown shag carpet and the same infamous couch, it posed a terrifying question - is this yet another angle of the bathroom?\n\nThough Moore’s choice of interiors may be baffling, there’s no denying they're also fun.\n\nAs one user put it: “I need to speak to the person who designed Demi Moore’s bathroom before I die.”\n\nOh - and in any case, the post was to promote her upcoming podcast Dirty Diana. The actor released a trailer for it on her Instagram and revealed that its first episode would drop on Monday.\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
