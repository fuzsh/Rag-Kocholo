First it was just us in the bar with Chris the bartender originally from St. Petersburg Florida who got a job in chicken from applying online. This older couple came in, we got to talking, laughing they ended up buying us a permafrost shot from Yukon jack (which is apparently made in Connecticut) and the old guy who is like 7 feet tall got a free drink for picking up the panty cannon from floor to bar-75 pounds you have to pick it up with 1 hand- then a younger couple came in with their sprinter we talked to them they are traveling from California and then 2 young dudes who are film and photographers came in mike and Matt we talked to them for a while as they are also heading to South America and then Tom and colene showed up with delica. Pan American class of 2018. We should start taking photos. So there is this thing at the chicken creek saloon where the walls are covered with hats and shredded panties. We were curious about how the panties get shredded and of course you fill the panty cannon with gun powder along with the panties and light them on fire and watch them explode. So talk talk talk I wanted to do this before we left. I got some nz Macpac panties to give chris the bartender to blow up and he was like well if you wait around for like 5 min Tony can do it. Tony works there and 2 days ago he acquired a baby squirrel as a pet-named skeeter because the miner who found it found him in a gold panning bucket full of mosquitoes. Dude had this thing living in his hood. So Tony grabs all the gun powder and supplies, the locals and everyone camping is there watching. There is a kiwi women and we are joking about the durability of Mac pac. Tony gets it all set up, the locals yell at him that he’s doing it wrong bc it’s his first time, he lights the pantie cannon and BOOM! They are shredded into 2 pieces!! Meanwhile across the street the bang scared a momma moose and her baby out of the bushes so now everyone is taking photos of that craziness walking around. I gave Tony a hug as he had just popped his cherry with my undies and got the staple gun from Chris to put my panties on the wall. I put them right next to the bills hat that you first see on the right when you enter the bar. The panties say my name and go bills!

Went to specialized auto, switched out our camp gear for rv park gear and jerry gave us a ride to ship creek rv dropping us off on the back side Set up tent, ate more chocolate that some guy from mechanic gave us (halloween candy) and ordered terrible sushi from urban sushi for 60.00-not worth it. We did some computer stuff and passed out hard\n\nJuly 20 Got a late start on our town walking rounds today and left ship creek around 2pm. We had to do some laundry and figure our shit out. The whole rv staff knows us now. Randy the handy man john the manager the lady everyone. We even got the special WiFi passcode. They didn’t realize we had a dog and told us if anyone asks it’s a service dog. We then walked to black cup which was 2m saw the climbing gym guy, got coffees and split Sando and cookie and sent some freelance work files while Jordan edited photos. We then walked to specialized auto to switch our gear for backpacking gear and got to check out this old land cruiser truck bed in the shop and talked to all the guys they loved our van and we got sweet hiking intel from James. He gave us a ride to rei where we stocked up on some camp snacks and then we got burgers at Tommy’s and walked to Carr’s where we resupplied groceries and camping food stuff. Jordan waited outside with the backpack and the dog by the liquor store portion of the establishment and was questioned by the young stupid large fat security guard if he was waiting for someone he said he was waiting for his wife as I walked up and the fatty shuffled away. Then we walked 3m back to ship creek through downtown and saw that the ice cream line was 30 min long. But we really wanted it but wanted more to take off our packs/drop our gear. So we went ‘home’ first and then I stayed whilst ran to get ice cream which was well worth it. Spruce tip vanilla. Now we are dealing with crazy barking grunting homeless man in the woods behind our tent so we had to put all the bear canister and extra shit in the laundry room so he wouldn’t be tempted to take it.
