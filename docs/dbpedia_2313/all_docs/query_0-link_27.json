        "text": "I did find a couple more orphan stories tucked away in unlikely places on my computer. Before sharing them with you allow me to revisit two issues that have been troubling me lately. (1) How best can we encourage family historians to take up those things ordinary historians do? Things like setting one’s family history in a broader historical context, or even as mundane as referencing something found on the internet.\n\nHere’s a post from May 2016 that will explain further what I’m on about https://wp.me/p4SlVj-Gf\n\nDo click on the link. [I’m also trying to see how many people click on the links i provide, and how many use the search box widget].\n\nSetting your Irish orphan into her historical context may be something you resist. Or you feel you don’t have the skill. I hope you give it a go, nonetheless. Launch yourself into space, a safety-net will appear. Take your time. Work up to it slowly. Maybe start with a blank piece of paper and writing down things you are curious about. It’s your piece of paper. No one but you needs see what you’ve written. Here are a few examples to start you off.\n\n‘How did my orphan end up in a workhouse? That particular workhouse? Why was she in Dunwich Benevolent Asylum, or Aradale Hospital, or Goodna in the last years of her life? Why did relations between the Belfast orphans and the Matron, the Captain and the Surgeon on the Earl Grey turn sour? Where did the orphans who went to the Moreton Bay District after disembarking from the Thomas Arbuthnot get their feistiness from? Why was she still living in a tent in Ballarat in 1862? How did she manage with such a large family? How did they travel all that way to the Darling Downs? What was her family life? Why did she have so many husbands, and so many children? Was she religious? Describe her life on the Victorian goldfields, in Port Fairy/Bendigo/Bathurst/Balmain/Adelaide/the Clare Valley/Wollongong/Toowoomba [insert the place(s) where your orphan lived]? What emotional turmoil did she experience appearing before the Ipswich Petty Sessions court? Or living on a remote sheep station? How do i include First Nations people in my family history? May i suggest not being afraid to use ‘hypotheticals’? “Ed was in Brisbane town that day in January 1855, when Dundalli was executed. He came home physically shaken, and told me all about it. Every time i see a Wonga pigeon i think about it”.’ We may need to cast our net imaginatively to find information that fits into our history. Recognition and truth telling are vital characteristics of every family history.\n\nYou’ll think of other questions, peculiar to you, to pursue, I’m sure.\n\nHistorians involved in public history, teaching family history courses, or providing expert advice for television programmes such as “Who do you think you are?” will be very much in favour of your placing your orphan ancestors in their appropriate historical context. ‘Am I right, or am i right?’ as my stepdad used to say. Maybe we should ask some of them for tips, Naomi Parry Duncan at the University of Tasmania family history course, Rachel Murphy at Limerick, or Tanya Evans who recently was elected President of the Federation of Public History, for example.\n\nMaybe look for a course you could enrol in. You’ll learn what kinds of questions to ask, what sources are available, and how you can question, and use them. It’s a great way forward.\n\nA student at Macquarie University, Amanda Midlam, has written some tips for writing a Famine orphan ‘girl’s family history. I wonder how you might gain access to this. I believe Trish Power was trying to include it in the latest GIFCC newsletter. Check out the www.irishfaminememorial.org website.\n\nMy second issue (2) follows from the first, and concerns ‘ethics and family history’. As Alison Light put it in her Common People, “The central moral or ethical questions of historical enquiry are unavoidable and immediate in family history: why does the past matter? How much and what do we owe the dead? “ I have also written about some of these ethical questions elsewhere in my blog.\n\nLet me see if i can find what I’ve said via one of the Search boxes at the bottom of a post, even if it is just to repeat the message. Do any of you use the Search Box? Here’s the link to some questions I posed earlier. Do click on the link, and scroll down https://wp.me/p4SlVj-I0\n\nScroll down to the very end and read the comments people made. The suggestions from Jenny Coates, Barbara Barclay, Julie Poulter, Janeaology, and others are very helpful. Janeaology recommends that we ‘publish and be damned!’ and refers us to http://genxalogy.blogspot.com/2013/09/ethical-dilemmas-2-geneabloggers-open.html What a delight. You might like to follow her blog, yes?\n\nI even entered the twittersphere and typed ‘ethics and family history’ into the Twitter search box. Jeepers, it really can be helpful. I found blogs, podcasts and even books. A discussion in the History Workshop via Julia Laite’s @julialaite podcast circa September 2021, or Penny Walters’ book, Ethical dilemmas in Genealogy are two to explore further.\n\nhttps://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/difficult-stories-and-ethical-dilemmas-in-family-history/\n\nOf course, you may be lucky, and never have to confront any kind of ethical dilemma in writing your family history. But it is something many of us will face at one time or another. I’m really interested in your take on this issue; how do you deal with ‘difficult’ stories? Do you exercise self censorship? Keep the ‘scandalous’, ‘unwelcome’, ‘contentious’ information private, for fear of hurting someone? Or do you forge ahead, providing evidence for what you are prepared to say? Let me know your views, please.\n\nPersonally, I’m doing a bit of soft shoe shuffle at the moment by letting family historians speak for themselves. The advantage is that descendants are engaged with their orphan ancestor in ways others of us are not. It is a very personal, sometimes passionate engagement. Have a look at the orphan stories that appeared in https://www.tintean.org.au between September 2019 and July 2020 and you’ll see what i mean.\n\nA few more stories\n\nMost of the stories i have remaining on my computer did make their way to the www.Irishfaminememorial.org website\n\nHere’s one by Rebecca Mahoney, about her ancestor “Fanny” Young. Alas I have lost touch with her, and she did send a pic with her story. Ah, found it. What a fine looking couple.\n\nI previously put up Frances’s ‘family reconstitution’ at bogpost 31 see https://wp.me/p4SlVj-Ji\n\n[You may wish to click on the link and have a look at some of the other family reconstitutions that are there, Bridget Fallon, Sarah Hare, Anne Maroney, Ann Nelligan, Sarah O’Brien, Bridget Dowd, for example.]\n\nFrances Young per Tippoo Saib\n\nby Rebecca Mahoney\n\n“Frances Maria Young was 17 when she was selected from the workhouse to be part of the famine orphan scheme in 1850. She was a Protestant, and both her parents had apparently died that year in Mt Nugent, County Cavan. I’m having some difficulty tracing them but having visited famine sites in Ireland. I know that many victims were not officially buried. Some went into unmarked mass graves, and there are accounts of corpses being eaten by dogs etc. In this context, one shouldn’t be surprised that records aren’t easily found, I suppose.\n\nFrances, known as Fanny, was illiterate. She worked, presumably in domestic service, until her marriage in October, 1856. Her husband, William Melbourne (the surname is sometimes transcribed as Millborn when traced back through preceding generations in England) was a free settler from Stebbing, a village in Essex.\n\nAccording to my grandmother, William owned a property in Parramatta and was a dray driver. She said he was the first man to deliver milk to the Sydney area. After his marriage, he decided to move to Yackandandah, following a friend that he had met on the “Garland” on his passage to Australia in 1851. The lure of the area was gold, according to my grandmother. Although he didn’t make a fortune, both he and his friend bought land there and settled. Fanny apparently didn’t travel overland on the dray as William did, but went by ship to Melbourne first. On this journey, she was robbed of all her possessions. Together, they had ten or eleven children. There is possibly a child born in Sydney in addition to the ten born in Yackandandah. Their second son, Sydney (yes, his name was Sydney Melbourne!!) was my maternal great grandfather. Fanny and William went on to have 73 grandchildren, one of whom was my grandmother.\n\nThe above is a combination of documented data and oral history, some of which is contradictory. I found it interesting that in the oral history, there is no mention of the Irish Famine Orphan Scheme. In fact, my grandmother, who was born and raised in Yackandandah, was sure that she had been told that her grandmother Fanny and grandfather William had been married in England prior to coming to Australia. She knew Fanny was Irish, but not the orphan / workhouse part of the story. I’m wondering if Fanny saw this as something embarrassing and not to be discussed? About forty years ago, I had my Nanna write down what she knew about her family’s background and I have kept it. She was as sharp as a tack and had a great memory, so she wouldn’t have forgotten something like the Famine Orphan Scheme if she had ever heard of it”.\n\nRebecca Mahoney\n\nEliza Christie from Armagh per Diadem\n\nAllow me to include this one by Di Samter. Di sent it some time ago, about the same time as another friend was having great fun getting in touch with relatives throughout the world by means of her DNA tests. Gerry even had me travel St John’s point in Donegal and take pictures of a Bronze Age burial site near Dunkineely.\n\nI haven’t included Di Samster’s family tree but you will detect her enthusiasm for DNA analysis, something family historians are using more and more these days. Have you tried doing a DNA test? What test would you recommend?\n\nEliza’s Legacy by Di Samter\n\n“My family history has, in one leap, taken me back 20,000 years, when recently I had a section (referred to as HVR1) of my maternal DNA analysed. With the more readily available access to DNA analysis, my apprehension gave way to excitement when I decided to give it a go. Having traced my ancestors’ journeys from Europe to Australia for many years, I thought this was a completely different way of gaining information. As a young child I always wanted to know how, when, from where and why my ancestors had come to Australia. In 1981 my Aunt (my father’s sister) introduced me to family history and from that moment on I was hooked on genealogy. During the mid 1980s another Aunt (my mother’s sister) started tracing my maternal ancestors. On my direct maternal/maternal line Eliza Christy is as far back as we could find.\n\nIt is my understanding that research has shown that most native Europeans have descended from seven ancestral mothers. These mothers have been given fictional names and I wondered – to which “Mother” did I belong? I used the internet to find a company that provided a DNA analysis service by Googling ‘family tree DNA sequencing’. Having decided which provider to use, I placed my order over the internet. Two swabs were posted to me to scrape a sample of DNA from the inside of my cheek and then return to them. About two months later I received the results revealing “Helena” to be my ancestral mother. I was able to access this provider’s DNA database and find others who identically matched the mutations of my maternal DNA sub-group (sub-clade). Although “Helena” represents around 41% of native Europeans, those who exactly match my sub-clade appear to be quite small – so far. This small group trace their ancestors back to Ireland, Scotland, England and one from France. Some people did not know the origins of their maternal ancestry. One such person comes from Australia and has chosen not to be contacted by other users. I am now having a further section of my maternal DNA analysed, referred to as HVR2 – and with hindsight I possibly should have done it all in the first instance.\n\nWith this new information to hand, my next step was to reassess our research back to Eliza Christy(ie). Years ago we had found the marriage of my gg-grandmother, Mary Jane Jones to William Bright in 1872, which gave her parents’ names John Jones and Eliza nee Christy, but we have never found Mary Jane’s birth entry, which would have divulged more clues about her parents’ origins. I knew the Jones family had settled in the Clunes area and I decided it was worth further investigation into the Victorian State Registers of Births, Deaths & Marriages to see if I could discover if Mary Jane had any siblings. I searched for the births and deaths of children with the surname Jones and the father John – the mother Eliza with maiden name Christy (varying the spelling of her maiden name). Being able to search the State registers on-line and have an instant entry downloaded to my computer made the process very easy. I found and bought a number of downloadable birth and death entries of the siblings of Mary Jane Jones. Mary Jane, born in 1854, is listed on the subsequent birth entries of her siblings and this is where I discovered that Eliza Christy had come from Armagh in Ireland and her husband John (Fras/z/er) Jones from Liverpool. Their ages and date and place of marriage in 1852 in Kilmore, Victoria were stated on the birth registers. The family tree below shows Eliza’s female line descendants coloured in red – these relatives should have the identical comparative DNA sequence to mine. (However, I guess it is possible there has been a mutation from Eliza to myself, but apparently this section of DNA is very stable and doesn’t often mutate). The sons, coloured in pink, should also inherit the identical section of maternal DNA to mine, but it is only mothers who pass it on to their offspring. Eliza and her husband John Jones had 12 children that I know of – the youngest being George Edwin Jones born on 3.6.1877 in Clunes, and died the 30.8.1916 on a WW1 battlefield in France.\n\nEliza’s family had unexpectedly captivated my attention. Through the wonders of the internet, I managed to make contact with Trevor McClaughlin – author of “Barefoot & Pregnant?”- who has written about the orphaned Irish girls who were shipped to Australia following the Irish Famine. He kindly provided me with more information about my Eliza. She was described as “thinly dressed” and came from Charlemont, Killalyn, Armagh. She entered the Armagh Workhouse on 9th January 1849 leaving 4th October 1849 for Plymouth to set sail for Australia. Eliza arrived in Port Philip, Victoria on board the Diadem on 10th January 1850, along with other orphaned girls from Ireland.\n\nAs time went by, many of Eliza’s children and grandchildren migrated to NSW. Eliza’s grand-daughter, Mary Ann Oberg (nee Bright), my g-grandmother, went to NSW with her husband, Malcus, in the early 1890s. The large family eventually settled in Inverell, where my grandmother, Tyra, was born. My grandmother was always keen to talk about her Swedish father, but was evasive about her mother’s side of the family. Both my elder sister and I recollect that – when we were quite young – and she was once again telling us about her father – we asked her “where does your mother’s family come from”? She pensively stated “France” then completely changed the subject. When I mentioned to her, in the 1980s, that her mother was not French and on her mother’s paternal side of the family we have two convict ancestors, her face looked ashen and she was lost for words – it was unprecedented for her to be speechless! I tactfully left the subject alone, as she was clearly upset about these skeletons creeping out of the cupboard. Hence the subject of her mother’s family became taboo and I never managed to talk to her about it again.\n\nI am still hoping to find out more about Eliza and her husband John Jones. I did find a death entry for an Eliza Jones (her parents names unknown, lived 53 years in Victoria) who died on 23.10.1902 in Maryborough Hospital, but her age was stated as 10 years older than I expected her to be – the age could of course be an error and this may really be my Eliza, but at present I am uncertain. No records have been found of the death of John (Frazer) Jones, nor do I know when he arrived in Australia, but it was obviously before his marriage to Eliza in 1852. John’s middle name Fraz(s)er was only used occasionally on official documents. I would be pleased to hear from someone if they are connected to this family, or know of details about the deaths of Eliza (nee Christy) and John Jones. Although my Mother and Grandmother have passed away, their maternal DNA identifies and connects the generations, being passed down through the female line descendants, ensuring the continuity of Eliza’s daughters.\n\nCatherine Moriarty\n\nFinally, a family history that Mike Vincent sent to me way back in the noughties. It is the story of Catherine Moriarty from Dingle in county Kerry who travelled with her sister Mary on board the Thomas Arbuthnot under the care of one of the best Surgeon Superintendents in the ‘Earl Grey scheme’, Surgeon Charles Edward Strutt. The Moriarty sisters were to prosper in their new home in what was to become Queensland. {I’ll be keeping an eye out to see if any of you use the search box to look for Catherine Moriarty and her sister Mary elsewhere in my blog}.\n\nMy sincere thanks to Mike for allowing me to reproduce his family history here. Parts of it are in Kay Caball’s Kerry Girls, should anyone have a copy. Best wishes Mike for recovery from your operation. The little gym i go to, Active Seniors, has some gentle exercises on YouTube at “Active Seniors exercise online”. There might be something there which helps. I took the liberty of removing your phone number and address from your original family history. I hope that’s okay. Fingers crossed my technologically challenged attempt at formatting holds.\n\n“Catherine Moriarty from Dingle per Thomas Arbuthnot\n\nby Mike Vincent\n\nORIGINS\n\nCatherine Moriarty was born in Dingle, Co. Kerry, Ireland on March 17, 1831 to Maurice Moriarty and Margaret Cahalane(1), who had married at St. Mary’s Church Dingle on February 21, 1827.(2) A brother John had been born on May 31, 1828(3), a sister Mary April 8, 1833(4) and a brother James on February 28, 1836, all at Dingle.(5) Nothing has been found about these brothers.\n\nBy 1849 the sisters were classified as orphans and were residing in the workhouse in Dingle. They were sent to Australia on the Thomas Arbuthnot, arriving in Sydney on February 3, 1850. At this time Catherine and Mary were actually aged 19 and 17 years respectively, and had been previously employed in Dingle as a house servant and a nursemaid. Catherine could neither read nor write, but Mary was able to read.(6) After a short stay in Sydney (11 days) they moved to Brisbane, on the steamer Tamar(7), where after 13 days Catherine was employed by John Bruce at North Brisbane.(8) By the 9th of June 1852 Mary had met and married James (Samuel) Brassington, a resident of Ipswich. Catherine Moriarty was a witness at this ceremony in St. Stephen’s Catholic Church, Brisbane.(9) Catherine Moriarty and Thomas Elliott were the sponsors at the baptism at St. Mary’s Catholic Church, Ipswich, of Mary’s first child on February 15, 1853.(10) On June 7, 1853 Thomas and Catherine were married in St. Stephen’s Catholic Church, Brisbane.(11) They returned to live in Ipswich where their first child was born on June 7, 1854, and baptised Thomas James at St. Mary’s Church on June 25.(12)\n\nThomas James ELLIOTT\n\nIn the June sessions at Westminster assizes, Thomas Elliott, apprentice tailor, aged 15 years, was found guilty of ‘larceny from the person’, as pickpocketing was then known, and was sentenced to imprisonment for four months.(13) Baptised Thomas James Elliot on August 16, 1818, at St. Clement Danes Church, London, his parents were James Elliot and Mary Ann Whitaker(14). He was caught again for pickpocketing, tried in the Westminster sessions on June 25, 1835, and acquitted for lack of evidence.(15) However on a third occasion, though calling himself James Elliott, his previous conviction was noted, and he was again found guilty of ‘larceny from the person’ in the Central Criminal Court, Middlesex, on August 15, 1836. Since he had a previous conviction, he was sentenced to 14 years transportation.(16) He was held in prison until, on March 29, 1837, along with 199 other convicts, he sailed in the 403 ton barque Lloyds from the Downs.(Offshore from the town of Deal, just north of Dover.)(17)\n\nThomas James arrived at Port Jackson, Australia, on July 17, 1837, where his description was recorded thus – ‘ 5 feet 4 inches tall; brown hair and eyes; brown complexion; missing front tooth in upper and lower jaws; M E inside lower right arm; T J inside lower left arm; able to read; single; trade – tailor.'(18)\n\nHe was then assigned to work for Charles Kelly at Ham Common in the Windsor district of New South Wales.(19) By 1841 it seems he had left the employ of Kelly (20), and in 1848 was residing in the Parramatta District when granted his first ticket-of-leave, No. 48/181, on May 31st. This was cancelled in September 1850 for his ‘being absent from the District’, but later that year this was reissued after this absence had been explained. He again had his ticket cancelled then reissued in January 1852 presumably for the Parramatta district.(21) He must have been somewhat successful in Sydney, probably as a tailor, for by November 1852 he was working as a tailor in the town of Ipswich, to the west of Moreton Bay. At this time still holding a ticket-of-leave, he was arrested for some unknown minor offence, and sentenced to a month in Brisbane prison, being released on December 18 for ‘good conduct’, after serving three weeks.(22) He returned to Ipswich where he was soon to meet his future wife, the young Catherine Moriarty.(10)\n\nPROSPERITY\n\nAfter their marriage the Elliotts continued in the tailoring trade in Ipswich for more than 20 years, until at least 1874. But they also invested in land, and rented out houses they had built. In may 1855 Thomas purchased an acreage allotment (no. 103) in Williams Street, West Ipswich, for £21(23), and another (no. 85) in the same street in November 1857 for £22-16-9.(24) These blocks were in a rural area of West Ipswich which did not develop quickly, and have been subdivided for suburban housing in only the last 30 years. (Details of the Elliott properties are shown in Table 1.) He next purchased a 32 perch town allotment in Ellenborough Street for £27 in 1858, but this was resumed when the railway line came through the town in 1865.(25)\n\nBy 1861 the Elliotts (Details of the Elliott children are shown in Table 2.) were living in Waghorn Street and renting premises for the tailoring business on 16 perches in Bell Street from Mr. F E Bigge. With the advent of the railway and associated construction of Union Lane, the address of this building in Bell Street was changed to Union Lane by 1865, and later to Union Street.(26) Meanwhile Thomas had also purchased a cottage in Pelican Street, North Ipswich, which he was renting to Walter Male in 1863, as well as a block of land nearby in Canning Street.(27) By 1865 allotment 85 in the western suburbs had been sold to George Frost, and allotment 103 divided and sold to W Duggan and J Flynn.(28)\n\nThe tailoring business was continued in Union Street until moving to premises in East Street in 1874.(29) This business must have been successful, for between 1854 and 1874 it was able to support his wife and eight children, and allow him to purchase and improve various properties around the municipality. Founding his business in the very early days of the town must have helped establish his reputation as a tailor, for he did not advertise in the local paper, The Queensland Times, nor anywhere else, so he must have relied on word of mouth and the passing customers for his trade. His tailoring business also provided training for his elder daughters, while his contacts enabled his youngest daughter, Elizabeth, to obtain employment at Cribb and Foot’s dressmaking department, where by 1906 she was supervisor.(30) Tailoring and dressmaking became traditional family skills for which even his grand-daughters were noted.(31)\n\nAbout 1865 he sold the cottage in Pelican Street (32), and on the Canning Street property built a wooden house, which was rented in turn over the next two decades to Joseph Harrower, James McGaw and Joseph Halstead.(33)\n\nThomas decided to leave the tailoring trade, and to retire to the more comfortable hotel accommodation business. Ipswich had always been a centre for accommodation and hotels, and in 1859 for example, when Brisbane had 18 hotels, Ipswich could boast 26.(34) To this end in 1874 he obtained an hotel licence and rented large premises on three adjoining allotments, each of 32 perches, in East Street, Ipswich, from George Thorne. These comprised an hotel and other buildings, one of which was used for the tailoring business for a short time. This hotel was The Cottage of Content, which had been occupied by Godfrey O’Rourke since before 1859.(35) The Elliotts ran The Cottage of Content as an hotel for three years(36), then in 1877 took up the licence of The Carriers’ Arms, which he transferred to The One Mile Hotel, which he had rented from Robert Cribb. This hotel was at Little Ipswich, now known as West Ipswich, on the corner of Brisbane Street and Moore Lane, now Hooper Street. This old brick building was at a major intersection, diagonally opposite the Ipswich pound, and overlooking the One Mile Bridge across the Bremer River.(37) This was the area where in the earliest days of Ipswich the bullock wagons halted on their journeys to and from the Darling Downs. There is a One Mile Hotel on the same site, and the pound is still diagonally opposite in June 2000.\n\nIn the period between 1866 and 1875, the family also lived in rented homes in Elizabeth Street opposite St. Mary’s Catholic Church.(38) During the 1870s they also owned a residential allotment in Pine Street, North Ipswich between Fitzgibbon and Lawrence Streets.(39)\n\nOn September 17, 1874, while renting The Cottage of Content, Thomas had purchased at a crown land auction, a block of land in Brisbane Street, one allotment west of Waghorn Street. This 32 perch allotment cost £20 pounds, with an additional deed fee of £1, and a survey fee of 12 shillings. The original ledger book recording these details shows the signature of the purchaser as ‘Thos. J. Elliott’, in very shaky handwriting.(40)\n\nBy 1878 with nine unmarried offspring ranging in age from two to 24 years, the family had sufficient experience, confidence and staff to invest in the hotel business. They took out a mortgage for £200, at ten percent interest, with the newly formed Ipswich and West Moreton Permanent Building, Benefit and Investment Society, on the 5th of February, to build a wooden hotel on the Brisbane Street land, purchased four years before.(41) This must have been a substantial building, for at this time a typical wooden house, including detached kitchen, cost £100 to build.(42)\n\nThis was licensed as The Prince of Wales Hotel, and was located next to James Real’s Ipswich Hotel, which had been built on the corner of Brisbane and Waghorn Streets in 1875.(43)\n\nOne young lad, Bernard Gallagher, had come down from the Bundaberg district to begin work in the Railway Department at Ipswich. His mother (another Irish orphan?) wrote to Catherine Elliott asking her to look after him while staying at their hotel. His stay was worthwhile, for in 1882 he married the Elliotts’ second eldest daughter Margaret Jane, and his job in the railway became a lifelong career, in which he became Supervisor of Railway Stores in Queensland.(44) At least three other daughters, Mary, Elizabeth and Catherine also married railway employees, while all three Elliott sons began their careers in the railway as well.(30, 31, 44, 45)\n\nIt is also of interest that two children married into hotel families. Catherine into the Real family, who had hotels and shops in Ipswich(46), and George into the Lynch family, who at one time held the licence of The Bull’s Head Inn, at Drayton.(47)\n\nAt the end of 1879 the licence of The Prince of Wales was not renewed, and until 1888 the building in Brisbane Street was operated as a boarding-house, no doubt providing useful ’employment’ for some of the seven daughters in the family.(48) During this period one of the guests announced that he was unable to pay his substantial accommodation bill. Thomas Elliott proceeded to have him thrown into the street, but the quick thinking lodger suggested that the building needed a coat of paint, and that he would apply it in exchange for his accommodation. An agreement was reached, the guest’s dignity was preserved, and the wooden boarding-house was repainted.(49) About 1885 the family moved into the Canning Street residence with Margaret and Bernard Gallagher, while the boarding-house was managed by a Mrs. Cook.(50) With a large family of eight, apparently little income from the renting of the boarding house, and Tom’s failing health, the Elliotts’ financial circumstances declined during the 1880s, and they found it necessary to secure additional mortgages on the Brisbane Street property from the Building Society.(51) These were as follows:- in 1879 £40; 1885 £45; 1886 £20; 1887 £20; 1888 £50; and 1889 £60.\n\nWhen Tom died of cancer of the jaw at his Canning Street residence in August 1888(52) there were arrears of rates owing on that property (£4-5-3), and the boarding-house (£6-13-9).(53) When his will was proved for probate, leaving all his possessions and property to his wife Catherine, she signed an affidavit stating that at the time of his death he had less than £10 in cash(54) The mortgage figures and rate arrears indicate that this was probably a fair assessment of his financial situation. Catherine retained possession of the Canning Street home and the boarding-house, which continued to operate.(55) She was now responsible for five daughters and two sons, between the ages of eight and 23 years, and though some of them were employed and she obtained a loan for £60 in 1889, there were still rates of £7-15-7 and £11-18-7 owing on the two properties in 1890.(56) During the next two decades, daughter Lucy entered the Sacred Heart Convent at Dalby, and the other children were married (see Table 2), most moving away from Ipswich. The Canning Street residence was sold about 1900, and Catherine later moved into a house in Martin Street with her youngest daughter, Elizabeth O’Grady, who had married in 1908.(49) It was here that Catherine died as a result of a gastric infection in August 1909.(57) On her death the boarding-house passed into the possession of the Ipswich Building Society, and was run for a year or two by Mary Hammill, before being sold in 1911 to Matilda Rae.(58) After passing through several owners, the site, along with the corner allotment, was purchased in 1962 by the Caltex Oil Company, who erected a petrol station there.(59)\n\nThe Ipswich daily newspaper, The Queensland Times, carried the following notices in its edition of Tuesday, August 24, 1909.(60)\n\nDEATH.\n\nELLIOTT.- On the 23rd August, at\n\nher residence, Martin-street, Ips-\n\nwich, Catherine Elliott, relict of\n\nthe Late Thomas James Elliott,\n\naged 76 years.\n\nFUNERAL.-The Friends of Messrs.\n\nT.

(7)\n\nTHE LATE MRS. ELLIOTT\n\nThe late Mrs. Catherine Elliott.. ,.. whose death was recorded in our last issue, arrived in Sydney in the ship Thomas Arbutnott, coming to Bris- bane in the Tamir the same year. She was married in 1851, her hus- band predeceasing her by 20 years. She leaves 10 children-three sons and seven daughters. The sons are Mr. T.J. Elliott ( Childers ), Mr. G. P. Elliott (Brisbane), and Mr. J. A. Elliott (Ipswich); and the daughters are Mrs. T. J. Hurley, Mrs. B. Gal-lagher, and Mrs. S.Murphy (Brisbane), Mrs. J. Real (Clayfield), Mrs. S. Tur- ner (New Zealand), Mrs A. O’Grady (Ipswich) and Sister Mary Scholastica (Convent of the Sacred Heart, Bowen-ville), besides 42 grand children, and three great-grand children. The funeral took place yesterday afternoon, and was largely attended, amongst those pres- ent being a considerable contingent from the railway workshops at North Ipswich-where Mr. J. A. Elliott is employed-and representatives of the Ipswich Technical College committee of which he is a member. The rite at the graveside was performed by the Rev. P. J. Murphy. Wreaths were forwarded by Mr. G. Evans and fam-ily, Mr. And Mrs. S. Palmer, Miss Ethel Sheppard, Mr. and Mrs. Little-ford. Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Bunnett, carriage, trimming, and saw-mill em-ployees, (Ipswich Railway Workshops), Ipswich and West Moreton Rugby Un-ion, and Goods-Shed employees(Ips- wich railway station). A great many telegrams and messages of sympathy were also received.\n\nTABLE 1 Details of properties owned and/or occupied by the Elliott family in Ipswich, Queensland\n\nLOCATION DESCRIPTION AREA USE TENURE SOURCES\n\nA:R:P\n\nWilliams St. West Ipswich Alot. 103 3:8 land owned 1855 – c. 1864 2, 13, 15\n\nWilliams St. West Ipswich Alot. 85 2:2:6 land owned 1857 – c. 1864 2, 14, 16\n\nEllenborough St. Ipswich Town Por. 4 Alot 20 32 land owned 1858 – c. 1864 2, 17\n\nBell/Union St. Ipswich Town Por. 2 Alot. 12 16 cottage, shop rented c. 1861 – 1873 2, 11, 3, 5\n\nWaghorn St. Ipswich Town Por.?

Please let us know if there is anything you’d like to correct, or to add.\n\nMy very best wishes to everyone about to plunge into the joys and frustrations of researching and writing their family history.\n\nA tweeter asked recently what is the best first line/last line in any book you’ve read? I took ‘line’ to include ‘sentence’ and answered with the last sentence of Flann O’Brien’s At Swim Two Birds.\n\n“He went home one evening and drank three cups of tea with three lumps of sugar in each cup, cut his jugular with a razor three times and scrawled with a dying hand on a picture of his wife good-bye, good-bye, good-bye“. A bit grim?\n\nAny ideas? What would you suggest?\n\nIn the first half of this year a handful of Macquarie University students developed their research skills and wrote up their findings in a number of Irish Famine orphan histories. I haven’t yet seen the results but look forward to doing so when they become available. It was a difficult time for these interns. Working during the coronavirus pandemic, the scandalous betrayal of university teachers, and being restricted to what was available online cannot have been easy. What i have to offer here, alas, is too late for their endeavours. But i hope it will be useful to someone either now, or in the future.\n\nSouth Australia\n\nMy first offering concerns South Australia. The serendipitous ‘finds’ happened when in the 1980s and 90s i was working on the large influx of Irish women who came to Adelaide in the mid 1850s. The South Australia Government Gazette, ‘Ships Papers’ held in the State Archives at GRG 35/48, ‘Immigration Agent, Letters-in’ at GRG35/43, the ‘Irish ‘girls’ at Clare’ GRG 24/6 2431, were especially useful. I’m sure others have used them to good effect since then. Official Government sources generally spoke well of the young women as did those in places of Irish settlement such as Clare.\n\nGovernment Gazette 22 November 1849 pp.37-8,\n\n“The facts mentioned in the Commissioner’s Report shew that the young females sent from Work-houses have hitherto been of an age to render them useful and independent. Indeed the best evidence to that effect is contained in the very favourable accounts which …you have had occasion to give of the conduct of the Irish Orphans, and of the satisfaction they have givem to their employers“.\n\nBut there was also plenty of prejudice against them from the Emigration Department, and Surgeons Superintendent. Which only shows how Surgeons could affect the reputation of these young women in their new home. The Surgeon on the Nugget which arrived in July 1854 said of the prospects for the arrivals on board, “Tolerably good for the good, but little for the semi barbarous pauper Irish girls who have never seen the inside of a house and who know nothing”. Contrast this with the Report of the Surgeon per Royal Albert arriving in Port Adelaide in December 1855. He stated “There is a great outcry, at present, in the colony against Irish immigrants. I am happy to state however, that the Irish single females per “Royal Albert” have nearly all obtained employment. This is, in a great measure, owing to the excellent account i was enabled to give of their conduct during the voyage”.\n\nWhat struck me in reading through my notes was that there is material here for anyone wishing to write about the ‘collective mentalite’ of young Irish immigrant females. I used this idea many moons ago in my teaching. Is it still a thing? You know what i mean, instead of looking at these young women through ‘official’ male eyes, it is a way of studying their ‘basic habits of mind’ about everything…about the voyage, their immigration experience, their attitude to ordinary, everyday things, their upcoming employment as domestic servants, their sexuality, family life, friendship, “the elemental passages of life”. That kind of thing. There is a lovely essay by Patrick Hutton on this subject in History and Theory, vol. 20, no. 3, October 1981, pp.237-59, for anyone interested. The Surgeon on the Oriental suggested one of the reasons for dissatisfaction with the Irish was “ they are obstinate and will not obey orders and likewise that they know nothing of domestic habits“, that is of their prospective colonial masters and mistresses. Would they be ‘broken’ or acculturated by the need for a job or by the demands of married life, or do you think they remained feisty, rebellious, and independent?\n\nThe sheer number of letters coming into the the South Australian Immigration Agent’s office shows how strong were their family bonds, mothers enquiring about their daughters, “…if you would be so kind as to let me know did she arrive or die on the voyage …”, this from ‘her distressed friends’ asking about Frances McDowal from Dublin who was in the Destitute Asylum in Adelaide, “considered an imbecile”. Or letters from far afield, from Melbourne, Kiama, and New Zealand, offering to pay their family member’s passage to where they lived, because “she is totally unacquainted in Adelaide”. James Byrnes in 1855 offers ‘when i get an account from them (Honora and Margaret Hogan) I will pay their passage by return of post down to Melburn‘. Or from Theresa Sheehan in Wellington, New Zealand asking about her daughter Mary Ann, “…it is a long time since i left her at home she was only a child” , different family bonds from the ones we readily assume, no? This one is perhaps more familiar, “I take the liberty of writing a few lines to see if you would be so kind as to trouble yourself so much with me as to let me know if i could get any of my brothers or sisters out to me as I should verry much wish to bring them out here to do well…”.\n\nIt was merely by chance that i came accross reference to two of the Earl Grey orphans in SAA GRG 35/43 Immigration Agent Letters-in. I’ve mentioned them before, briefly, in blog post 67 https://wp.me/p4SlVj-2e1\n\nMargaret McTagart from Belfast per Roman Emperor\n\n18 May 1857 letter from Arabella McTagart, 3 Patens Lane, Perth Road, Dundee, Scotland.\n\n“The girl alluded to is Margaret McTagart from Belfast Workhouse“. In a well written letter Arabella enquires after her sister, “I am very much depressed in mind since i parted with a sister of mine. I understand she arrived to the colony as there had been letters from many who went out in the same ship”. She asks that the Depot “books” be searched to see for her sister ” for emigrants who went out in or about the year 1846…she was not in her native place at the time so “doesn’t know the name of the ship”. I’m presuming, because of the reference to Belfast Workhouse, that Margaret was on board the Roman Emperor, the first ship to Adelaide carrying “Earl Grey” orphans. Dundee was a familiar destination for young women from Ulster, many going there to work in the textile industry.\n\nBridget Mahony from Fermoy per Elgin\n\n16 July 1855 letter from Margaret Mahony, Cork, asking about her daughter Bridget.\n\nHonble Sir,\n\nI most humbly and respectfully beg leave in the liberty I take of addressing you with these few lines respecting my daughter Bridget Mahony aged 18 years sailed in the Elgin from plymouth to adelaide South Australia at the end of May 1849 and reached the colony in safety on the 11th September following. I your most humble applicant most humbly and respectfully hopes that you will be good enough to take me into your worthy honour’s humane and kind consideration in letting me know when convenient to your worthy honor if my daughter is living or not and also to be pleased to forward to me my daughters address so as to enable me to write to her. Hon Sir , by your complying with your humble applicants most humble request your applicant as in duty bound will pray. Margaret Mahoney widow No.5 Alley Coppingers Lane off Popesquay Cork Ireland.\n\nPS. I, your humble applicant beg leave to acquaint your worthy honor that it was from the Union workhouse of Fermoy in the county of Cork that my daughter was sent from when she was emigrated and I, now resides in my address to your honor.\n\nMargaret’s request was successful in that Matthew Moorhouse replied, 23 October 1855, “Bridget Mahoney was hired from this depot on the 3rd of October 1839 (sic) to Mr Walker shopkeeper Hindmarsh. I know nothing of her since then”.\n\nVictoria\n\nBuoyed by my find among my notes from the South Australian archives I turned to those I had for Port Phillip. I have not checked to see what is available online. Our archivists do a wonderful job but there is a limit to the hours in a day, and what they can do. I’d need the skills of someone like Kelly Starr to get into the nooks and crannies of whatever is online from the Public Records Office of Victoria. But look, here among my notes I’ve found something about\n\nBridget Ryan from Drum, Tipperary per Pemberton\n\nThere are two letters, one addressed to the Immigration Agent in Port Phillip at VPRS 116/P unit 1 file 51/95. Bridget’s half sister Johanna McGregor is making enquiries about her. It is a beautifully crafted letter from an intelligent woman.\n\nSydney September 7th 1851\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Emigration agent here to write to you concerning my sister. I received a letter a few days ago from my friends at home informing me that my sister arrived here about two years ago but did not mention the name of the ship she sailed out in. I have made all enquiries here for her but can get no intelligence of her, I am greatly disturbed in my mind ever since I received the letter and I hope Sir you will do all in your power to find out has she arrived in your Port. My sisters name is Bridget Ryan or otherwise Conneen. her complexion fair. and her age about 19 or 20 years. We are half sisters and I am not sure which of those two names she may call herself by. The Gentleman of the Emigration Depot wishes that I should hear from you before I Advertise her in the Newspapers. My sister is a native of Ireland County Tipperary Parish of Drum. I cannot answer my mother’s letter until I hear something of my sister as I know it would make her very uneasy to hear that we never met here.\n\nI remain Honorable Sir,\n\nYour Humble servant\n\nJohanna McGregor\n\nthat is my husband’s name McGregor.\n\nThe other is a Memo communicated to J McGregor 23 September 1851 as follows,\n\nBridget Ryan arrived at Port Phillip per Ship Pemberton in May 1849.\n\nShe was taken out of the Depot by Thomas Hassett, Milkman, living next door to Messrs Bowler & Bennett, Solicitors Collins Street Melbourne. About fourteen months since she married a John Bryan from Carrick O’Loughnane Tipperary and has a son.\n\nBryan and wife, when last heard of by Hassett, were living with a Mr Fisher Sheepholder of Geelong. A letter addressed to the care of Mr McKern publican of Geelong will find them–– or to Thos Hassett, as above, who comes from the same place as the Ryans and Knew them at Home. Bridget Ryan was married from Hassetts house.\n\nHugh E Childers\n\nImmigration Agent\n\nMelbourne\n\nSept 19, 1851.\n\nHow caring and helpful was that.\n\nI had planned to add a little more, mostly taken from Probate records, obituaries in Trove and the like. But I’ll leave that till another time.\n\nLockdown might be a good time to relearn some of the poems I used to be able to recite, a lifetime ago\n\n“Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,\n\nEnwrought with golden and silver light,\n\nThe blue and the dim and the dark cloths\n\nOf night and light and the half light…\n\nThank you Mr Yeats.\n\nMay I invite readers to have a look at Kay Caball’s ‘Comment’ to my blog post (64)? Kay outlines her method for tracing the “Kerry Girls”, the subject of her book, and stresses how important it is to get in touch with someone local who can help find your particular Earl Grey orphan in Ireland.\n\nLet me return to what I’ve been trying to do in the last couple of blog posts viz. place an orphan in the workhouse where she lived before coming to Australia. I know full well I’ll repeat some things I’ve said before, or to put it more politely, reinforce what I’ve said before.\n\nFor instance, for this post which intends focusing on workhouse Indoor Admission and Discharge records, you may wish to review my https://wp.me/p4SlVj-4X\n\nTowards the bottom of that one you will see how i found some of the Earl Grey orphans in Indoor Workhouse Registers. There’s a brief mention of Letitia Connelly and Alice Ball from Enniskillen, Maria Blundell and Mary Dowling from North Dublin, Marianne Howe and Mary Bruton from South Dublin, Sarah and Margaret Devlin, and Charlotte and Jemima Willcocks from Armagh, and Cathy Hilferty from Magherafelt. The orphans can be elusive. They are sometimes difficult to find. [Karen S. tells me she has found some Lady Peel orphans in the Cashel Registers].\n\nShould you intend retracing your orphan’s steps in Ireland, it is very important to do all the homework you can before you leave for the Emerald Isle. Exactly which workhouse did she come from? What records have survived for that workhouse? Can I get access to them? Do i need to apply for a reader’s ticket? Can I find her baptism in church records? Is any member of her family mentioned in Tithe Applotment Books or in Griffith’s Valuation? Even send an email to a local history society. That kind of thing. Nowadays there is an ever increasing number of records being put online which will help you do this.\n\nMy aim in this post is to introduce you to information found in Workhouse Indoor Admission and Discharge Registers. Whet your appetite if you will. Let me pull together some of the things I’ve suggested recently. I’ll start by using the third example from a couple of posts ago.\n\nMargaret Love from Enniskillen per Diadem\n\nMargaret married in July 1851, shortly after arriving in Port Phillip. She would have been about 17 years old or so. {Thanks Perry}.She married William Hargrave, a blacksmith from Leeds, England, a man of different religion from her own, and six years older. They had twelve children, six boys and six girls. But their first five girls and one boy died in infancy. That is a high infant death rate.\n\n“The night your sister was born in the living-room\n\nyou lay on your bed, upstairs, unwaking,\n\nCryptsporidium frothing and flourishing\n\nthrough the ransacked terraces of your small intestine...”\n\nSinead Morrissey, Home Birth\n\nFirst settling in Geelong, the couple tried their hand at the gold diggings in Ballarat. Most likely with little success since William took up smithy work again in Moomambel, Mosquito and Maryborough. Margaret herself died in Maryborough Hospital of tertiary syphilis at the end of April 1877 when she was about 43 years of age. Margaret did not have an easy life.\n\nLet’s see if we can turn her life clock back and locate her in Irish workhouse records. Try typing “Church Hill Fermanagh” into your search engine. (You’ll need to skip Winston Churchill’s relationship with Fermanagh). And lo, there is a place spelled both Churchill and Church Hill in the parish of Inishmacsaint. Unfortunately its baptismal records do not cover the period we want. Churchill is some distance from Enniskillen workhouse where I found Margaret and her siblings, Sarah and Thomas, and Mary their dropsy afflicted mother. More of that in a moment.\n\nand from the database,\n\nSurname : Love\n\nFirst Name : Margaret\n\nAge on arrival : 16\n\nNative Place : Churchill, Fermanagh\n\nParents : Mary\n\nReligion : Roman Catholic\n\nShip name : Diadem (Melbourne Jan 1850)\n\nWorkhouse : Fermanagh, Enniskillen\n\nOther : shipping: house servant, reads; PRONI Enniskillen PLU BG14/G/4 (3251) Union at large, sister of Sarah (also on Diadem) and Thomas, daughter of Mary who was disabled from dropsy.

Empl. John O’Loughlin, Point Henry, £7, 1 year, apprentice; married James Barry, Geelong, 2 Jun 1851.\n\nEnniskillen workhouse\n\nFor some ‘recent’ news about the workhouse see https://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/11/21/news/enniskillen-workhouse-to-be-brought-to-life-with-lottery-funding-1192436/\n\nThere are a number of other Irish workhouses being restored, refurbished and turned into heritage sites. I know of at least two; Carrickmacross in County Monaghan and Portumna in County Galway. Readers may know of others?\n\nEnniskillen workhouse is well served with surviving records . To find out more about its history try the following two links. Or type ‘Enniskillen workhouse’ into the search box at the end of this post to see what i have said about it already.\n\nhttp://www.workhouses.org.uk/Enniskillen/\n\nhttps://ideas.repec.org/p/ucn/wpaper/200315.html\n\nIn this second link Cormac O’Grada , Timothy Guinnane and Desmond McCabe provide information on ‘Agency and Relief’ in Enniskillen, stressing how a ‘careless, incompetent, penny pinching‘ administration of the workhouse exacerbated the Famine throughout the Poor Law Union, and led to the dissolution of the Board of Guardians in March 1848. That was a lucky strike for Margaret and Sarah Love who were to leave in late 1849, by which time administration of the workhouse was in the hands of ‘professional’ Vice-Guardians, Gowdy and Trevor. Do have a look at that working paper. It may help you understand why so many Earl Grey orphans went to Australia from Enniskillen.\n\nIn the Board of Guardian Minute Books, 17 November 1846 [BG/XIV/A/2 page 490] and 16 March 1847 [p.572] we read that a Visiting Committee reported on the abysmal state of the workhouse. They found the house “in a miserable state of filth and irregularity” and complained “it must eventually result in fever and other diseases“. By March 1848 signs of the new reforming broom were being felt: “Resolved…that a pair of sheets be used in each bed, instead of one as at present; that a pauper be appointed to place a clean pair on each bed every fortnight and a clean shirt or chemise every week.\n\nResolved that the Schools of the Enniskillen workhouse Union be placed under the National Board of Education…”\n\nNew buildings, better financial management, and administrative reform not only reduced the number of fever cases but prepared the way for Enniskillen workhouse being a major source of Earl Grey orphans going to Australia.\n\nIndoor Registers : Enniskillen\n\nTo repeat what i said in blogpost 5, these are large heavy volumes containing plenty of information about inmates. They have space to record by number, the name and surname of each ‘pauper’, their sex, age, whether married or single, if child whether orphan, deserted or bastard,\n\nwidower or widow;\n\ntheir employment or calling; their religious denomination,\n\nif disabled, the description of their disability,\n\nthe name of their wife or husband, number of children,\n\nobservations on the condition of the ‘pauper’ when admitted,\n\nthe electoral division and townland where they lived,\n\nthe date when admitted or when born in the workhouse, and the date when they died or left the workhouse.\n\nPotentially a goldmine of information, they are certainly worth ‘mining all within’. Yet such was the crushing day-to-day pressure of the Famine, not all registers were so meticulously kept, and relatively few have survived, most of them in the North of Ireland, and held in PRONI in the Titanic Centre in Belfast.\n\nMy own research notes written on cards in pencil are not as legible as i would like. I was determined to catch as many Earl Grey orphans as possible. I certainly did not research each orphan in detail. Tracing their whole workhouse history was not always possible. But those descendants who wish to visit Ireland and walk in the same space as their orphan ancestor, or breathe the same air, surely will have more time to comb these records, should they have survived. May i wish you every success?\n\nWhat do i have for Margaret and Sarah Love in my notes?\n\nMy search in volumes BG14/G/4 and 5 in the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) was principally for those Earl Grey orphans who left Enniskillen workhouse on 3 October 1849 en route to Plymouth to join the Diadem, and those who would leave on the 26th of the same month to join the Derwent.\n\nAt BG14/G/4 No. 3249 Mary Love entered the workhouse on the 15 June 1848 with her children, Thomas (14 year old) and Margaret and Sarah who were described as twins and as being 16 years old. Note the discrepancy with Port Phillip shipping records. Their place of residence was Union at large, that is, they were homeless.\n\nMary was a 59 year old widow, Roman Catholic, who was disabled from dropsy, all of her family living from hand to mouth. Most likely they had survived by begging. And whilst Mary was recorded as being from the Union at large, alongside that entry appears the name of a townland which in my spidery handwriting looks to be Coldrum. We’ll need to check the names of townlands. Here’s a possibility https://www.townlands.ie/fermanagh/magheraboy/inishmacsaint/caldrum-glebe/\n\nMother Mary left the workhouse 12 October 1848, leaving her children still in the workhouse. Young Margaret stayed there until 3 October 1849. Sarah left 4 July 1849 but (at BG14/G/5 no. 2238) re-entered a couple of weeks later, 3 August ’49, before leaving with her sister on the 3rd October to join the Diadem.\n\nThere is another record at BG14/G/5 no. 1238 for a 65 year old Mary Love, Roman Catholic, no calling, aged and infirm, who entered the workhouse 1 May 1849 and left 30 July. She can hardly be the mother of our sixteen year old twins but as Kay Caball suggests, ages were not reliable. If we believe the entry we have above at no. 3249, our Mother Mary would have been about 45 years old when she gave birth to her son Thomas! More conundrums to resolve.\n\nHere are a few more examples from Irish workhouse Indoor admission and discharge records relating to orphans who came to Australia per Diadem, Derwent and Earl Grey .\n\nMcManus families in Enniskillen workhouse\n\nMy first example is one that demands another visit to the archives. I’ve misplaced some of my notes, and the remaining ones are in a state of disarray. There was evidently more than one McManus family in Enniskillen workhouse. My surviving notes however do underline how desperate these families were. The McManus females were not long term residents of the workhouse but they frequented it on numerous occasions during the Famine years. {I’ll highlight the dates of their entry and leaving to help you trace that frequency}. They came in when they needed to, or when they were desperate enough. Using a bit of historical license, one might even imagine the emotions involved in their family breaking apart. But I’d be careful about ascribing my own emotions to people in the past.\n\nHere, from my surviving notes, are references to them as they appeared in Indoor Registers BG14/G/4 and 5. {I’ll also highlight their place of residence. Remember what i said in an earlier post about the importance of geography. Type the townland name along with County Fermanagh into google or your alternative search engine and you will find exactly where the townland is}.\n\nNo. 210 Mary McManus and 211 (?) Margaret McManus 15 yo single RC Laragh entered 4/7/1847 left 30/08/47\n\n470 Mary McManus 18 yo RC 4/7/47 to 27/7/1847\n\n947 Ann McManus 15 RC Letterbreen in 4/7/1847 out 18/09/47. She had entered along with her 9 yo, 5 yo and 3 yo siblings.\n\n1185 Margaret McManus 16 s deserted by mother RC clean Laragh entered 3/09/1847 along with Mary 12 yo and Thomas 7 yo\n\n1441 Mary McManus 14 yo entered with her 30(?) yo mother Mary(?) and her siblings Margaret 12, Eliza 8, Pat 5, Thomas 2 and Redmond 2 mths. Husband in Scotland. Laragh Cleenish Island entered 12/10/47 left 7/04/1848. Two members of this family were to come to Australia by the Derwent.\n\n1474 Margaret McManus 12 yo orphan RC mother in house Ballycassidy Twy.\n\n1797 Anne McManus 20yo paralyzed\n\n2315 a Mary McManus (mother?) left the workhouse in 1850.\n\n2362 & 2615 Mary McManus\n\n2648 Ann McManus\n\n2728 Mary McManus 12 yo daughter of 38 yo Ellen RC Florencecourt\n\nin 25/04/48 out 25 May 48\n\n4060 Margaret McManus 16yo single RC Rahalton Derrygonnelly in 24/10/48 out 26/10/49 the date other orphans left Enniskillen to join the Derwent at Plymouth\n\nand 4064 as part of the same family group Mary 14 yo who entered on this occasion 24/10/48 and went out 9/11/48. This is looks to be Margaret’s sister who was also to join the Derwent.\n\nand just to confuse matters further in BG14/G/5 number 15 Margaret MacManus 17 yo s. RC Union at large Drumbeg, in 23/1/49 out 3/10/49 which is the date others left to join the Diadem. But there was no Margaret McManus on the Diadem.\n\nOne would need some time in the archives to find which of these McManus women and children belonged to whom. Notice how they moved around from townland to townland during the Famine years. {Remember how far the young hero traveled during the Famine in Paul Lynch’s brilliant novel, Grace}. It would appear that Margaret and Mary McManus per Derwent were sisters. Ann McManus may have belonged to a different family.\n\nEllen and Mary Fitzsimmons\n\nJust a couple more for the Diadem, at BG14/G/4 nos 464 and 465, as part of a family, with mother Grace a 45 yo widow, Established Church, and a 15 yo brother Robert, Ellen Fitzsimmons 14 yo and Roseanne 12 yo entered 4 July 1847 and left 16 February 1848 ; nos 3592-5 Grace Fitzsimmons 45 yo widow no employment Aghnaglack in 10/08/1848 entering with Mary 17 yo no employment, along with Ellen 11 and Rose Ann 9, all of them leaving four days later on the 14th August. Then in BG14/G/5 at nos. 254-5 Ellen Fitzsimmons 18yo Protestant Carn Blacknett and Mary Fitzsimmons 16 yo Protestant entered the workhouse 26 January 1849 and left 3 October 1849, the same date as other orphans leaving to join the Diadem at Plymouth.\n\nArmagh Indoor Registers BG2/G/1 and 2. Mary Littlewood\n\nLet me finish with a couple more from Armagh Indoor Register where you can find many more Earl Grey orphans. The first relates to Mary Littlewood whose story i recounted in blogpost 9 https://wp.me/p4SlVj-dQ\n\nI included a synopsis of her stay in the workhouse there. Here are further details that i hope help us understand young Mary a bit more. {I’ll continue highlighting the family’s dates of entry and leaving, and the townland where they resided}.\n\nBG2/G/1 Unfortunately I didn’t always note down the numbers and there seems to be some duplication of entries in the second volume BG2/G/2.\n\nBG2/G/1 nos. 5440-44 Mary Littlewood 54 yo married, husband Samuel, Protestant, enters with her four children from Rich Hill Ragged and dirty 1/11/1846 leaves 28/12/46; Mary, 15 yo thinly clothed and hungry 29 Nov. ’46 to 28 /12/46; Thomas William 13 yo leaves 1/12/46; John 11 yo and Ann Eliza 9 yo who leave 28/12/46. {Incidentally Richhill and Ballybreagh are not too far from Portadown, the birthplace of that great poet i quoted earlier, Sinead Morrissey}.\n\nNo 6159 Samuel married to Mary 57 yo Established Church from Rich Hill enters the workhouse with one of his children 13 yo Thomas William 12/12/46 leaves with his wife and the rest of the family 28 December 1846. The family all left on the same date. I wonder did they not like being separated from each other in the workhouse.\n\nNos. 7532-36 Mary Littlewood married no calling Protestant delicate husband Samuel Rich Hill Ballybreagh enters 16/2/47 leaves 14/08/47. No.7533 is 11 yo John followed by Ann Eliza 9years old, Samuel 57 yo married weaver very ill died 25 February 1847, and finally Mary 15 yo single leaves 10/08/1847.\n\nThen in the next volume BG/G/2 nos. 1469 et seq. Mary Littlewood 54 yo married Established Church, thinly clothed and quite destitute, from the Union at Large (now she has nowhere to live) re-enters the same day 14/08/47 along with 11 yo John and 9 yo Ann Eliza. They all leave a few weeks later on 6/09/47. The family is only staying in the workhouse for very short periods.\n\nWe see the remainder of the family again at No. 2076 et seq. Mother Mary is described as a 52 year old widow a member of the Established Church (Church of Ireland or Anglican) from Rich Hill Ballybreagh coming in to the workhouse 5 October 1847. But she dies on the 10 March 1848. Shortly after, her eldest daughter Mary 15 yo leaves the workhouse 24 May 1848 en route to Plymouth to join the Earl Grey. She leaves behind her siblings, all of them described as thinly clothed and destitute, thirteen year old Thomas who absconds from the house 11 July ’48, 11 yo John who leaves 10 September 1850 and Ann Eliza 9 years old who leaves 18 July 1851. Bit by bit the family falls apart. I wonder what became of them. Mary Littlewood’s story, Earl Grey orphan, is recounted at https://wp.me/p4SlVj-dQ\n\nMary Anne Kelly per Earl Grey\n\nFinally, the ubiquitous Mary Kelly. This one is Mary Anne Kelly who also came on the Earl Grey with her sister Rose. I did have some loose sheets with specific references to entries in the Indoor Registers that i used for the second volume of Barefoot & Pregnant? But they’ve gone missing. Here are the references from Barefoot; BG2/G/1 3119, BG2/G/2 439, 1417and for Rose BG2/G/2 439, 1418, 1819.\n\nFrom my early numberless notes, BG2/G/2\n\nMary Anne Kelly single female 19 yo. Established Church, Thinly clothed and hungry, resides Middletown, entered 30 April 1847, left 6 May 1847. She had come in with her mother 40 yo Rose Kelly along with her siblings, sister Rose 15 yo and two brothers Patrick and Michael, all of them described as thinly clothed and hungry.\n\nThree months later Mary Anne re-enters the workhouse but this time is described as a single female 19 yo Roman Catholic, recovering from fever thinly clothed and hungry, residing Middletown. She enters along with her younger sister Rose who is 15 years old. She too is recovering from fever. They enter 7 August 1847. Rose leaves 13 September 1847, Mary the 8th November.\n\nBut Rose comes back one day later, 14 September 1847, along with her two brothers 12 yo Patrick and 10 yo Michael. Rose is described as s f 15 reduced to 14 years old, Fatherless RC thinly clothed etc. Middletown. Rose will leave the workhouse on 24 May 1848 the same date other Armagh orphans leave to join the first orphan vessel, the Earl Grey. Patrick and Michael will leave the workhouse 26 September 1849.\n\nFinally, Mary Anne Kelly single female 19 yo RC thinly clothed and destitute residing Middletown comes back to the workhouse 28 December 1847 and she too will leave 24 May 1848 en route to Port Jackson. The shipping record in Sydney will state her parents are called James and Rose, her mother being still alive and living in Middletown.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————–\n\nI can think of more things we might do. For example, see what we can discover about Armagh during the Famine. Or about the changes happening to the weaving industry in this densely populated county. Or about the workhouse itself.\n\nObviously the content of this post will be of particular interest to the descendants of Margaret and Sarah Love or Margaret and Mary McManus, and the others. Nonetheless i hope it encourages you to research ‘your’ own particular orphan inside the workhouse, in Downpatrick, Magherafelt, Ballymena, Dublin, Cashel or wherever. Be warned though, if Indoor Registers have survived, you may discover only a brief reference to your orphan. Yet nothing ventured, nothing…\n\n“…discover by your grave cloths a replica of yourself\n\nin turquoise faience, fashioned with a basket.\n\nHere, it says. I’ll do it. Take me“.\n\nfrom The House of Osiris in the field of reeds in Sinead Morrissey’s Parallax"
