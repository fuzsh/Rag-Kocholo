        "text": "Irish medical professional training body and higher education institution\n\n\"RCSI\" redirects here. For the New York church, see Reformed Church on Staten Island.\n\nNot to be confused with Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.\n\nThe Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) is a not-for-profit medical professional and educational institution, which is also known as RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences. It was established in 1784 as the national body for the surgical branch of medicine in Ireland, with a role in supervision of training, and as of 2021 provides a broad range of medical education in multiple countries.[6]\n\nRCSI's main campus is situated on St. Stephen's Green and York Street in central Dublin and incorporates schools of medicine, pharmacy and biomolecular sciences, physiotherapy, population health, denistry and nursing and midwifery. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate education in a number of healthcare fields.[6]\n\nRCSI is ranked fifth in the world for SDG3 Good Health and Well-being in THE Impact Rankings 2024[7]. The THE University Impact Rankings recognise universities around the world for their social and economic impact based on the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground and foundation\n\n[edit]\n\nSince medieval times, the practice of surgery in Dublin was licensed by one of the Guilds of the City of Dublin, the Barber-Surgeons' Guild, also known at times as the Guild of St. Mary Magdalene. The guild chapel was in Christchurch. Guild membership was obtained by a 3-year apprenticeship, followed by 2 years as a journeyman. In fact the College of Surgeons maintained a mandatory period of apprenticeship to become a qualified surgeon until 1828.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1446, the Barber-Surgeons' guild was incorporated by a royal decree of Henry VI, becoming the first medical corporation in Britain or Ireland.\n\nIn 1765 Sylvester O'Halloran, a surgeon from Limerick, proposed a College of Surgeons along the lines of the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been regulating French surgeons since it had been created by Royal Charter by Louis IX in 1255, to train and regulate surgeons.[8] The Dublin Society of Surgeons was founded in 1780 at the Elephant public house on Essex Street (now Parliament Street).\n\nTrinity did not teach surgery as a subject until 1851, so Ireland was entirely without a school focused on surgery. To have a separate organization focused on providing standardised surgical education became one of the goals of the society and they lobbied for a Royal Charter, in 1781 presenting the Lord Lieutenant a petition to be incorporated separately from the barbers. The awaited charter was granted by King George III on 11 February 1784. The governing body, including the first President, Samuel Croker-King, and William Dease, first professor of surgery, met in the boardroom of the Rotunda Hospital for the first time on 2 March.\n\nNon-discrimination\n\n[edit]\n\nAdmission or employment was not subject to discrimination on sectarian grounds. Two of the RCSI's leading founders, Sylvester O'Halloran and William Dease, as well as 11 of its first 57 presidents, were Catholics. The college also recognized the medical qualifications given by the Catholic University from 1856, which gave legitimacy to their diplomas.\n\n18th and 19th centuries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first candidate for examination was John Birch, in August 1784.\n\nThe RCSI's first location, at the corner of York Street, was acquired in September 1805, with additional land at Glover's Alley bought in 1809. The site was previously an abandoned Quaker burial ground. The Duke of Bedford laid the first stone of the new building on St. Patrick's Day, 1806 and building reached completion in March 1810. As of 2021, this remains the primary location of the institution.\n\nA supplemental charter was granted by Queen Victoria in 1844, dividing medical graduates into Licentiates and Fellows. Initially, physicians were trained alongside surgeons. In 1886 these two disciplines were merged, and the medical school began operation. As a result of this historical legacy, graduates of medicine still receive Licentiate diplomas from the two Royal Colleges as well as now being awarded MB (Bachelor of Medicine) BCh (Bachelor of Surgery) and BAO (Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics) degrees by the National University of Ireland.\n\nNow defunct subjects formerly taught include: Logic (1852–1862), Military Surgery (1851–1860) and botany (1792–1889).\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1916 Rising, the main college building on St Stephen's Green was occupied by Irish Citizen Army forces, led by Commandant Michael Mallin and Countess Markievicz. After surrendering, both were tried and sentenced to death. Mallin was executed while Markievicz's sentence was commuted due to her gender.\n\nThe subject Hygiene or Political Medicine (1841–1921) was retired, and its Chair united with Medical Jurisprudence.\n\nThe RCSI became the first medical institution of learning to offer a 4-year graduate entry programme for medicine in Ireland.[9]\n\nEthna Gaffney became the first female professor at RCSI in 1967.[10]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the period 2014 – 2018, RCSI-affiliated researchers collaborated with over 2,100 international academic and industry institutions producing over 2,900 co-authored publications. The university's field-weighted citation impact is twice the world average and scores in the top decile internationally in the Times Higher Education World University Ranking (2020).[6]\n\nIn December 2019, the RCSI was authorised as a university, becoming the ninth in Ireland, following a change in legislation, and an application by the college. The long-sought change in status was complicated by the RCSI's status as a private body but eventually a standard process was created and the college met the conditions set out in it, and following ministerial approval, the change was endorsed by votes in both houses of the Oireachtas.[1] This also made it the eleventh university on the island of Ireland, including The Queen's University of Belfast and Ulster University.\n\nAssociated hospitals\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the 1980s Beaumont Hospital, Dublin has been the principal centre for medical training. Other affiliated hospitals include teaching hospitals such as Connolly Hospital, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital, Dublin and University Hospital Waterford.\n\nAcademic structure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe institution has a structure of Faculties and Schools, some parts of which focus more on undergraduate studies, some more on post-graduate and continuing professional education.[11]\n\nThe lead faculty is the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, with Schools as follows:\n\nSchool of Medicine (largest medical school in Ireland; five or six year undergraduate programme, four year Graduate Entry Programme (GEM))\n\nSchools of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences (undergraduate, including MPharm and Advanced Therapeutic Technologies (ATT), and post-graduate, education)\n\nSchool of Physiotherapy (undergraduate and graduate-entry, and post-graduate, education)\n\nSchool of Nursing & Midwifery (largest post-graduate nursing education provider in Ireland)\n\nSchool of Postgraduate Studies (three Masters streams, MD and PhD studies)\n\nSchool of Population Health (postgraduate programmes in Population Health Leadership)\n\nSchool of Dentistry (five year undergraduate Bachelor of Dental Surgery)\n\nand two other units:\n\nGraduate School of Healthcare Management\n\nCentre for Positive Health Sciences\n\nThe other faculties are:\n\nFaculty of Radiologists and Radiation Oncologists\n\nFaculty of Dentistry\n\nFaculty of Nursing and Midwifery\n\nFaculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine, operated jointly with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland\n\nEducation is delivered using a structure of departments working across faculties and schools.[11]\n\nResearch and innovation\n\n[edit]\n\nRCSI is home to numerous healthcare research collaborations and centres. The university's research is focused on improving human health through \"translational\" research: clinical, laboratory-based and health service research informed by societal and global health challenges, and on improved diagnostics, therapeutics and devices; healthcare delivery issues; policy and clinical practice and enhancement of the quality of education of healthcare professionals.\n\nStrategic research themes include:\n\nBiomaterials and regenerative medicine\n\nCancer\n\nNeurological and psychiatric disorders\n\nPopulation health\n\nHealth service issues\n\nSurgical science and practice\n\nVascular biology\n\nAdmissions and values\n\n[edit]\n\nRCSI is a culturally diverse, international organisation with alumni presence in almost every country in the world. More than 3,800 students representing 60 nations are typically enrolled in its Medicine (1,800), Pharmacy (200) and Physiotherapy (100) programmes. RCSI's Medicine programme allocates 25% of places for EU applicants and 75% for non-EU applicants. RCSI claims to have educated more than 32,000 alumni.[12]\n\nIt states that it values innovation, excellence, independence, academic freedom, diversity, tolerance and community and that it champions a patient-centric approach to its activities and endeavours. RCSI is the largest Irish medical school.[13]\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Students' Union (SU) is an annually elected body, consisting of 8 officers. The SU is the institution's bridge between faculty and the student body and is invited to most meetings, ensuring that student voices are heard on a variety of topics. The SU works closely with the Student Council, which consists of class representatives from all classes at RCSI.\n\nStudents at RCSI are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities that promote service in the community and cultural awareness. 80% of the student population is from outside the European Union, with a significant portion coming from North America, the Middle East and Asia.[14] The Biological Society (BioSoc) is the official student society of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and claims to be the oldest student medical society in the world.[citation needed] The RCSI International Night and the Chocolate Ball (amongst many others) are their main annual events.\n\nRCSI has a sports ground in Dardistown in Dublin's northern suburbs.[15]\n\nInternational aspects and operations\n\n[edit]\n\nRankingsGlobal rankingsARWU (2024)[16]901−1000THE (2024)[17]251−300\n\nThe RCSI is active in medically related sectors of education in multiple locations. During the South African Apartheid, for example, the RCSI provided medical education to those that were discriminated against.[18] More than 95 countries from each continent are represented in the RCSI student body.[19]\n\nIn Malaysia the RCSI & UCD Malaysia Campus, became the RCSI's \"launching pad\" in South-East Asia. Established in 1995, medical students may choose to complete their pre-clinical studies at either UCD or RCSI in Dublin, before continuing the clinical aspect of their degree in Penang. Also in Malaysia, Perdana University Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (PU-RCSI) was established in 2011, aiming to host up to 100 students per year on its 5-year undergraduate medical programme, the first cohort to graduate in 2016.[citation needed]\n\nRCSI-Bahrain is a fully-owned constituent university of the RCSI. The first cohort of medical students commenced studies in October 2004 followed by the first cohort of nursing students commencing in September 2006.[citation needed] Programmes offered include a 5-year Bachelor of Medicine (MB, BCh, BAO) programme, a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing programme and a 2-year research based Master of Science in Nursing programme.[20][21][22] Since 2009, students can also obtain the degrees conferred upon RCSI graduates from the National University of Ireland.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, RCSI Dubai was founded and currently offers a master's programme in Healthcare Management. In 2007, the RCSI, in conjunction with Valentia Technologies, the Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), and Ireland's Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC), launched a unique training initiative with the Emergency Medical Services Dubai Training Institute. The aim is to better patient care and improve response times within Dubai's emergency ambulance services.[23]\n\nFor students at the home institution of the RCSI, options may be taken abroad as a result of collaborative agreements with other medical schools around the world. In 2007, these medical schools included Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, and Tufts University. There are also informal agreements with other institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University and Mayo Clinic.[citation needed]\n\nMotto and colours\n\n[edit]\n\nThe RCSI motto, \"Consilio Manuque\", was adopted from that of the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been afforded the motto by Louis XIV. It was originally \"Consiloque Manuque\", his personal motto.\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessor Abraham Colles of Anatomy, the first person to characterise the injury that was later on known as Colles' fracture\n\nFelipe Contepomi, former Argentina rugby union international.\n\nSurgeon Captain Thomas Joseph Crean VC DSO (1873 to 1923), who later achieved the rank of Major.\n\nBaron Darzi of Denham, Professor of Surgery, Imperial College London, and formerly the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health\n\nSir Alexander Dempsey, M.D. FRSM, JP, physician, hospital administrator and magistrate.\n\nEmily Winifred Dickson (13 July 1866 – 1944), the first woman Fellow of any Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland or Great Britain\n\nPatrick Dignan, major general, director of army surgery, British Army, between 1973 and 1978.\n\nSir Ian Fraser (1901-1999), president of the college and president of the British Medical Association, who introduced the widespread use of penicillin into military hospitals during the Second World War\n\nNada Haffadh, Bahrain's first female minister when she was appointed Minister of Health in 2004\n\nRavi Kant, professor of surgery, Padma Shri award winner(2016) and vice chancellor of King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India.\n\nMohammed G A Al Maadheed, physician\n\nKarl Mullen, Irish Rugby Union player and captain of the Grand Slam-winning Irish team in 1948\n\nPat O'Callaghan, Irish gold medallist at both the 1928 and 1932 Olympic Games\n\nIan Robertson, former star of the Dublin gaelic football team\n\nSir William Stokes, knighted for his contribution in the field of surgery.\n\nWan Azizah Wan Ismail, first Malaysian to be awarded the MacNaughton-Jones gold medal for Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1977; a MP, the first president of the Malaysian People's Justice Party, the first female Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister and wife to current Malaysia's 10th prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nSir William Wilde, surgeon, author and father of Oscar Wilde\n\nT.G.
