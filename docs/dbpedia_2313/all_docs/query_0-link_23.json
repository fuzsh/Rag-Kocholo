Wadkins, 29 years old, fatally shot his estranged wife, Mary Wadkins, 32 years old, before taking his own life in the bedroom of Mrs. Wadkins home at 1143 Amity street. The shooting occurred about 8:30 p.m. shortly after Mrs. Wadkins had seen her two sons, by a previous marriage, off to the community Halloween party for boys, sponsored by the Charles D. Hammond lodge, Fraternal Order of Police and the Port City CIO council at Marsh Field. THE MURDER and suicide climaxed a quarrel which had started in the afternoon. Detectives Dan Colburn and Rudolph Johnson, who investigated, said. In the house at the time of the shooting were Mr. and Mrs. Harvey VanderLeest, friends who came to live with Mrs. Wadkins three weeks ago. Mrs. VanderLeest said that Wadkins killed his wife a few minutes after returning to the house in the evening. Three shots followed Mrs.Wadkins cries of, \"Don't shoot me!\" Mrs. VanderLeest told the detectives that she rushed to the bedroom door and pleaded with Wadkins not to shoot his wife again. After telling her to call the police, Mr. Wadkins said he was going to kill himself, said Mrs. VanderLeest. A few seconds later another shot was heard. Police found Mrs. Wadkins on the bed and Wadkins slumped against it. Both had been shot in the head. The death weapon was a .45 caliber automatic pistol. THE WADKINS had operated a store at 1543 Carlton street but it had not proved successful. According to the information obtained by police, Mrs. Wadkins had succeeded in getting another man to invest in the business. The sale of the store was subject of argument. Mrs. Wadkins finally started divorce suit and the husband was served with an injunction restraining him from molesting his wife. A charge of malicious destruction of property later was made against Wadkins by his wife, but dismissed. Wadkins went to Milwaukee for three weeks but returned a few days ago. He visited the home Friday afternoon and quarreled with his wife.. Then he returned Friday night apparently with the intention of killing his wife and himself. Officers said the husband was jealous of his wife. The two sons of Mrs. Wadkins, Donald, 13 years old, and Harold, 11 years old were intercepted at the Halloween party at Marsh Field by Detectives Johnson and Colburn and taken to the home of an uncle at Muskegon Heights. They were with their father today. It was Mrs. Wadkins' third marriage and Mr. Wadkins' second. They were married in Muskegon in February, 1945. MR. WADKINS was born on Dec. 2, 1917 in Zion, Ill. and after living in Kenosha, Wis. In 1918 came to Muskegon the following year. Mr. Wadkins was employed by the Campbell, Wyant and Cannon Foundry company since 1944. He leaves two children by a former marriage, a son, Leo L. Wadkins and a daughter, Lavonne Wadkins of Muskegon; four brothers, Gilbert, Herbert L., Claire and John of Muskegon and a half-brother, Gene H. Amsbury, Washington, D.C., four sisters, Mrs. Vernon Cartwright, Mrs. Donald A. Brooks and Miss Mary Lou Wadkins, Muskegon and Mrs. Albert E. Thomas, Berry, and a half-sister, Mrs. Raymond Terpstra, Muskegon Heights. Mrs. Wadkins, the former Mary Sochowski, was born November 6, 1914 at Peshtigo, Wis. And had lived in Muskegon since she was eight years old, having moved here from Bancroft. She had been employed at Continental Motors corporation.

Virginia Lou Walters left this world on October 29, 2006 the same way she lived her life - on her own terms. Her strength amazes us all. She is survived by her husband of 58 years, Glenn M. Walters, her children, and their families: Martha L. Walters and John H. VanLandingham of Eugene, Oregon (Johnny H. VanLandingham and Cassady V. Walters); Steven G.

Schwemmin. Her sister Betty Conrad of Atlanta and brother Jack Schnell of West Olive survive her. Gin was born on May 28, 1923. She graduated from Ottawa Hills High School in 1940; her path seemed set when she was voted most independent girl. From there she went to Grand Rapids Junior College and on to graduate with a BA and teaching certificate from Ypsilanti Teachers College (now Eastern Michigan University). She shot a hole-in-one at Indian Trails Golf Club after 9 whiffs while at GRJC. Gin worked in the ammunition factory, was a navigator in the civilian air patrol during World War II, and sprayed the vitamins on the cereal at the Kelloggs factory. She was a 59 model at Goodyears and Hudsons in Detroit and her love of hats inspired her to decree red berets for all at her 80th birthday celebration. Her sense of fashion and style was all her own. Who else would go on a hot air balloon ride in a full-length dress and heels! Virginia met Glenn on a blind date in 1947 and gave up the Sorbonne for a great marriage and 5 children. Big Gin was the family foundation - she was the glue that held it all together. Gardening and flower arranging were her great loves, and her talent for them won her many awards. Virginia was a Master Flower Show Judge, life member and president of Kent Garden Club and the Federated Garden Clubs of Michigan, as well as president of the Tucson Garden Club and member of the Dirt Daubers Garden Club of Montague, Michigan. Virginia and a small group of friends imagined and helped bring to fruition the botanic gardens that later became the Frederik Meijer Botanic Garden & Sculpture Park. Virginias sharing went beyond family and friends and involved her in many groups. She was a member of Alpha Xi Delta Sorority; a teacher in Battle Creek and Denver, Colorado, schools; president of numerous East Grand Rapids PTAs, where she also helped to head up the drive for girls sports; a member of the Voluntary Action Council, Babies Welfare Guild, Womens City Club, and Ladies Literary Club. She marched against racism and co-founded an early Headstart program at Campau School in Grand Rapids in the early 1960s. Gin shared her imagination, enthusiasm, and optimism in many ways, from dune jumping during the family Olympics at Lake Michigan to being a great and very lucky card player to being the hostess with the mostest! Big Gin was spontaneously generous and everyone she met was a friend. Gin loved to read to her grandchildren, make and build things with them, and watch their imaginations take off. She inspired them to explore the natural world. She could pack more kids into a Karmen Ghia than anyone, and her grandkids will always remember her driving them fast on the roller coaster roads where she would announce as they departed, Off like a dirty shirt! She cherished her grandchildrens individuality. They, in turn, loved hearing about Grandmas WILD days. I have a wonderful husband, five beautiful children, 12 wonderful grandchildren, Ive traveled the world -- what else could I ever want? Friends are welcome to join Glenn and family Saturday, November 4th, promptly at 6:30 p.m. to celebrate Virginia. 6:30-7:30 p.m. memories, party to follow.

JOHN B. WHEELER, of the firm of Wheeler & Hugunin, in the 28th year of his age. Seldom has the decease of one of our citizens caused more emotion in our midst, or deprived us of one whose claims to our respect and affection were better founded upon his virtues. Coming to Muskegon, in the summer of 1853, he commenced a business, small in itself, but which, by his strict integrity and methodical business habits, soon became lucrative, and his exemplary and upright life soon formed for him a circle of warm and admiring friends. With these, and with other of his later acquaintances, the bond of friendship widened and strengthened to the day of his death. In 1854, upon the resignation of Postmaster Walton, Mr. Wheeler was appointed to the charge of that office by President Pierce, and he continued to fulfil the duties of his station with courtesy and public satisfaction, until his removal in 1857. During this period he was elected to the office of Town Clerk which he also ably filled. In 1857 his health seriously began to fail. A bronchial affection insiduously extended its ravages, and unfitted him during the summer of that year for active duty. From that time he slowly but surely faded. Eminent physicians were consulted and the benefits of Hydropathy were applied, but Nature refused to restore his blighted strength and on Sabbath morning his spirit took its flight to the better land. On Monday afternoon his funeral ceremonies were held at the Methodist Church, and under the ministrations of the Rev. Wm. Rounseville. After a sermon, impressive, yet filled with consolations to his weeping friends, he was placed in his last tenement, deeply mourned by the large concourse, which accompanied his remains. Mr. Wheeler was one of the first Trustees of the Methodist Church in this place, and his obsequies were the first since the dedication of that church.\n\nInformation donated by Bill Moore\n\nWHEELER, OLIVE B.

Soon after they moved west to Northern Michigan and about four or five years following to White Lake, where they settled in the old town of White River, the romance of which is interweaved with the history of the northern part of Muskegon county. Later they moved to Montague. By occupation, Mr. Whelan was a fisherman and during his time made large catches of the famous whitefish, which was then so abundant in these waters. About twenty-nince years ago, he was ship-wrecked just off White Lake. It was a heavy snowstorm, which came up about the first of May and caught him with two companions out in a small sailing vessel. They were out in it for three days lashed to the boat and were finally picked up by a schooner. Their own outfit and vessel were lost. Ever since that time, Mr. Whelan had been in ill health, suffering greatly with asthma. Five years ago he came to Muskegon to reside with his daughter. A little over a week ago he was taken with his last illness. Besides his widow, five of their nine children survive him. They are; Mrs. James Doyle of Holland, Mrs. L. Anderson of Holland, Mrs. Michael Tobin of Muskegon, Miss - Mary Whelan of Holland and Edward Whelan of Racine.

A small estate is divided among four heirs, two daughters and two sons, by the will of Mrs. Josephine White, who died a week ago. The will was filed for probating Friday. Bequests of $5 each are given Wallace H. White of Whitehall, and Charles S. White of Fruitport, sons. A daughter Mrs. Bertha Paulson of Fruitport, is given $25. The funeral expenses are expected to dispose of the remainder of her money. The house, furniture, wearing apparel and two acres of land in Fruitport, which constituted Mrs. Whites farm home for the past two years were bequeathed to the youngest daughter, Miss Alice White, with the unusual stipulation that the house is not to be moved from the property, which is in accordance with a deed Mrs. White made with Edward Paulson, husband of the oldest daughter. Curiously enough, Mrs. White when she died was administratrix of the estate of her husband, George M. White, who died several years ago. To dispose of this tangle a petition was made Thursday in probate court for the appointment of an administrator de bonus non in his estate. The hearings on this petition and on the probate of will were set for Oct. 21.\n\nInformation donated by Matt Burns\n\nWHITE, Nellie E.
