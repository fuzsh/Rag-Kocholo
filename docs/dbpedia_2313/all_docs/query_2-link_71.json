His death was unexpected.\n\nHis family will receive friends at Whitley’s Funeral Home from 6:00 to 8:00 PM Monday, May 25, 2020. Funeral services will be held at Whitley’s Chapel at 1:00 PM Tuesday, May 26, 2020 with Rev.

In addition to his parents, Harry was preceded in death by his brother, Terry Karriker and his great-granddaughter, Daisy Torres.\n\nA longtime area resident, Harry was a member of Liberty Baptist Church and worked as a train conductor for Norfolk-Southern until he retired. Harry loved to read his bible, fish and watch Cartoons with his grandchildren. Harry loved the Lord and loved his wife of 56 years. He was a strong willed, but humble man and a devoted husband, father and grandfather. Harry will be dearly missed.\n\nHe survived by his wife, Judy Wyatt Karriker of the home, his daughters; Teresa Whitaker (William) of Cocoa FL, Jessica Dixon (Jerry) of China Grove, grandchildren; L.J. Dixon, LaDonna Torres (Roy), Desiree Sherman (Richard), Montana Brown (Craige), Chrizdeana Bundy (Caleb), Telka Dease (Rickey), Megan Bundy, Savannah Moore, great-grandchildren; Brianna, Elizabeth and Olivia Torres, Aubrey and Kera Sherman, Chandler and Jason Brown, Sebastian and Jacob Bundy; Dakotah, Sierrah, Rickey and Tarek Dease and his sister, Lorraine Morton of China Grove, sister-in-law, Joan Karriker of Salisbury and “son-in-law” Donnie Moore (Helen).\n\nOnline condolences may be left at www.whitleysfuneralhome.com"
