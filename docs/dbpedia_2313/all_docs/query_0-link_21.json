Mensch, Barto, R. 1, died at 1:25 o'clock yesterday morning in Allentown hospital. He was 69. Mensch, who was highly skilled in the craft which dates back centuries before the Christian era, was stricken with a heart attack on Jan. 21. Highlighting his more than half-century career in illumination (a style of ornamenting manuscript by adding elaborate designs in color or gold or silver) was the publication of two articles on his 'Treasure Volume,' a beautifully illuminated work containing the complete records of the incorporation of the Schwenkfelder library at Pennsburg. Several Allentown department stores exhibited in the past another achievement in his career; a desk made in 1919 by his father on which he penned 200 selections in poetry and prose and which blazed in illumination done in 18 different colors. Mensch, who lived at Babbling Brook, Barto R. 1, was not only an expert in his field but collected the illuminated manuscripts of others in the fast-diminishing art. During the war years he addressed 1,000 letters in 'illuminating' style to his son and others, which have since become collector's items. Of Pennsylvania German descent, he was born at what was known as 'Tsoppa Wartshouse' in Rockland township, Berks county. He attended Stoner's business college and later became an instructor in penmanship there. Later he also taught at the Standard School of Commerce, New York City; the Morse Business college, Hartford, conn.; the Spencerian Commercial school, Newburgh, N.Y., and Mountain State Business college, Jarkersburg, W. Va. For two years he was general manager of the Erie County Milk Assn. In 1919 he returned to this locality and made his home in Perkasie, where he continued to live until 1940. Then he made his permanent home at Babbling Brook, the summer home which he and his brother bought in 1930, adjoining Camp Mensch Mill, near Huffs Church. A former Mason, he has been secretary of Moyer Brothers Creamery at Huffs church since 1932. He was the son of the late Milton and Emma Haas Mensch. Survivors include his wife, Laura; six children, Charles, Tucson, Ariz., Lillian, wife of Warren Beldon, Benson, Vt., Vera, wife of Lt. Col. Lisle Bartholomew, Ft. Totten, N.Y., Sue, wife of Archibald Hanna, Bradford, conn., Sara, wife of Paul Nickell, Philadelphia, and Marcus, Boyertown, and one brother, Eugene, Jeanerette, La.\n\n[Source: Allentown Morning Call, Thursday, February 1, 1951, page 6.

Merkel of Kutztown died of a heart attack last night in the Kutztown Publishing Co. building at 243 W. Main St. Horrified onlookers saw Merkel appear at a smoke-shrouded second-story window, then collapse on the floor. Thinking he was overcome by smoke, Drs. George Leibensberger and Kenneth Lambert applied artificial respiration and used the resuscitator from the Kutztown Fire Co. ambulance. But Dr. Lee Dunkelberger, deputy Berks County coroner, pronounced Merkel dead of a heart attack at the scene. Damage to the building from fire and water was \"very slight\" said fire company secretary Charles Saul. A small furnace, used for melting type metal, overheated and started the second floor smoldering, he said. The floor and the first-floor ceiling were \"charred and burned, but not badly,\" Saul said. Two employees, Willard DeTurk and Arthur Zimmerman, said they were working on the first floor and \"smelled something burning.\" But they paid no attention, they said, because the type-metal furnace was used regularly on Friday night to melt linotype slugs used in the Kutztown Patriot, a weekly newspaper published Thursdays. The furnace was unattended, a company spokesman said. When the men downstairs saw smoke on a stairway, they telephoned firemen at 7:47 p.m. The composing room, where Merkle died, adjoins a little room where the furnace was. The composing room was filled with smoke. Merkle, a leatherworker for the Kutztown Shoe Co., Inc., served with the Army in the South Pacific in World War II, and was Kutztown's second assistant fire chief for the last eight years. A son of the late William and Alice Merkel, he lived at 300 W. Main St., in Kutztown, and was a member of Ziegel's Union Church, Lyons Fire Co., the American Legion, and the Kutztown Social Club. Surviving with his wife, Mrs. Jean D. Oswald Merkel, are four sisters, Eva, wife of Alton Geist, Mamie, wife of Norman Schadler, and Maude, wife of Paul Printz, all of Kutztown, and Mabel, wife of Edwin Becker of West Leesport R. 1.\n\n[Source: Allentown Morning Call, Saturday, July 17, 1954, page 5.

Merkel, aged about 59 years, a well-known retired farmer of Fleetwood, was found dead on Monday forenoon in his sand quarry, in Ruscombmanor, about one-third of a mile south of Fleetwood, death being caused apparently by apoplexy. Mr. Merkel drove to the quarry about 6 a.m. to get a load of sand for Frederick Maurer. At 6.30 the team was found on the street, going toward home, by Chas. Bleiler. No driver accompanied the team, and the face that the wagon was loaded with sand, and the shovel on top of the sand, indicated that the one who had loaded the sand was ready to start the team. Mr. Bleiler tied the horses to a fence along the road side, expecting that the driver would shortly follow. At 10 a.m., Mr. Maurer, who had been waiting for his sand, started to investigate the cause of the delay. When he found the team along the roadside, he at once surmised that Mr. Merkle had met with an accident, and started for the sand quarry., where Mr. Merkel's body was found near the screen over which he had run the sand previous to loading. It is supposed that he was stricken when about ready to get on the wagon. Deceased was a son of Isaac Merkel, of Fleetwood, who died in 1880. His mother died about a year ago. The widow (nee Catherine Keim) and one sister, Mrs. Peter Kieffer, of Lyons, survive. He was a member of the Lutheran congregation of the Fleetwood Union Church, and the O.U.A.M. and K.G.E. orders of Fleetwood.\n\n[Source: Allentown Morning Call, Wednesday, April 25, 1906, page 7.
