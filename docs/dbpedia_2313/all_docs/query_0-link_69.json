        "text": "Transcribed by William Morris Higginbotham\n\n[email protected]\n\nCharleston, WV\n\n2000\n\nThe Lynchburg Press, Thursday 08/04/1814\n\nJohn Higginbotham (ca1726-1814) VA\n\nDIEDOn Sunday the 25th ultime, Mr. John Higginbotham of Amherst countyaged 88 years.\n\nHis friends and acquaintances, who knew him while living, will deplore his loss.\n\nLynchburg Press, Thursday 02/11/1819\n\nDr. Shannon Higginbotham (ca 1796-1819) VA/PA\n\nCOMMUNICATED.\n\nDIEDAt Philadelphia, on the 22d ultime, Dr. SHANNON HIGGINBOTHAM, son of Mr. William Higginbotham, of Amherst County, Va., in the 23d year of his agebeloved, and lamented by all who knew him! Here the pen might drop, and let impressive silence speak, for his eulogy is written on the hearts of his friends; of all who were of his acquaintanceBut society has occasion, and justly, to deplore the premature loss of so much worth.\n\nThis excellent young man from early childhood, seemed to entertain just conceptions of the great importance of education, and the acquirement of useful knowledge, as the means by which man became fitted to perform some useful part, on the theatre of life.This correct impression he never lost sight ofhe voluntarily subjected himself, throughout the last 12 or 14 years, to the most rigid discipline, and with an assiduous perseverance, but seldom equaled, probably never surpassed; devoted this important period of life, to the attainment of that high destiny, where the hopes and just anticipations of his friends had already placed him; and to the credit of his parents, be it said, they never thwarted his course, but sustained him with an unsparing hand, until at the goal of full fruition, and ripening to maturity, the fruits of their constancy, and their solace, sank together in the dust!It pleased a kind providence, thus to chasten surviving relations, and to bereave society of an ornament, of which it might well be proud!He had acquired a correct understanding of the most useful languages , ancient and modernhad devoted much of his time to science and the artsand thus having become acquainted with all, he judiciously selected the healing art as that in which he was likely to become most useful to his country. For this purpose, he had, with unabated labor and attention, employed the last three years of his life, to the particular study of the science of medicine; and such was his proficiency, it might be fairly said, without exaggeration, that no young man of his age, (with the opportunities afforded him) ever entered the University of Pennsylvania, with capacity and acquirements more extensive.It was while attending a course of lectures at this University he died.\n\nTo say thus much and no more, would be to leave the better part untold, and doing an act of injustice to the virtuous dead; but to do this as becomes us, a misfortune, not unfrequently, occurs, should we say to little, in fearing to say too much.The writer was personally, well acquainted with the subject of this obituary notice, from his infancy to his death; and although he has the will to offer a much higher tribute of respect to departed merit, then his humble pen has power to dictate, he would not heedlessly cast the memory of a good man into shade, by overcharging his real character, or pourtry his worth in traits too highly coloured for real life; this would tend to obscure his fair claims to the benedictions of posterity, and endanger the keeping up an example worthy of imitation, to the living.\n\nThen let it suffice to say, in the language of another friend, who was with him at his death, whose fellow student he was, and who has borne ample testimony to his worthThat his modestyhis unassuming deportmentand above all, his moral rectitude, could not but engage the attention and admiration of all who knew him. In point of understandingpersevering application to his studiesand his acquirements in the particular profession he had chosen for his future usefulness, he had few equals.\n\nThe Virginian, Lynchburg, VA, Friday 10/18/1822\n\nFrances Higginbotham McDaniel (ca 1785-1822) VA\n\nDIED, on Thursday the 26th ult. At her fathers in Amherst, of a lingering and flattering complaint, FRANCES McDANIEL, consort of George McDaniel, and daughter of Joseph Higginbotham. She was in the 37th year of her age, and left four small children and a tender husband, to lament their irreparable loss. In offering a tribute of respect to the memories of our departed friends, we can do so perhaps in no way more respectfully then endeavoring to imitate their virtuous examples, if such they have left us. We should, therefore, perpetuate in our recollection such examplesand endeavor so to imitate them, as that, in the end, we may look around us with a mind placid and serene, at the last lingering scenes of nature, and calmly resign our breath to him who gave it us. Our recently departed friend , we hope died thus. Although she at time, expressed herself unwilling to die, yet, for the most part, she manifested that degree of resignation amidst her afflictions, which we are willing to believe was the offspring of a complete reliance in the renovating influence of heavenly grace. Suffice it to say that our departed friend was meek, gentle, kind, submissive, affectionate, tender, sincere, and forgiving. We trust that religion, holy religion, was the prop on which she resided all her prospects of eternal happiness. In her death, ye friends and relatives, truly you have sustained an irreparable loss, but if she has left you to dwell in the bosom of her heavenly benefactor, why not cheerfully give her up? Or why not, rather, rejoice that she has left this world of sorrow, afflictions and pain, for one in which we hope there is exemption from all afflictions and bereavements?\n\nWe die to live, and live to die no more.\n\nLynchburg Virginian, Monday 06/13/1825\n\nFrances Kyle Higginbotham (1734-1825) VA\n\nDIED, at her residence, in the County of Amherst, near New Glasgow, on the 30th May last, Mrs. Frances Higginbotham, in the 91st year of her age.\n\nThe Virginian, Lynchburg, VA, Thursday 10/20/1825\n\nJames D. Higginbotham (ca1802-1825) VA\n\nCOMMUNICATED\n\nDeparted this life, on Monday the 10th inst. At the residence of his uncle, Thos. Higginbotham, in Amherst, in the 23rd year of his age, Mr. JAMES D. HIGGINBOTHAM, son of James Higginbotham, decd. (who was at the time of his death of the state of Kentucky.) This young man fell a victim to that fatal malady denominated by physicians the \"galloping consumption;\" which, in this instance, from its attack to its mournful termination, progressed with the most unexampled rapidity. But yesterday the deceased was in the midst of ushis cheek suffused with the glow of healthhis eye delighted, and his heart thrilled with the deceitful prospects and illusory hopes of future years. Yes, he was with us, the cherished promise and beloved object of his relatives, and the delight of his juvenile friends and acquaintances. And now, alas! Cut off in the midst of his hopes, his leaf is withered by the untimely frosts of deaththe grave numbers him with its mouldering tenants. Thus fades man, whose flower is often enflushing, when blighting is nearest. It must be a source of pleasure, though a mournful one, to his friends and relatives to remember, that, since his death was an event that no human skill could avert, the malady which produced it was neither lingering nor painful; during the whole period of which, though in the full possession of his mental faculties, he was unconscious of any the least degree of physical suffering. He fell asleep in death as one who wraps his mantle about him, and lays him down upon his couch to pleasing dreams.\n\n\"No further seek his virtues to disclose,\n\n\"Nor draw his frailties from their dreaded abode,\n\n\"There they alike in trembling hope repose,\n\n\"The bosom of his Father and His God.\"\n\nLynchburg Virginia, Monday 02/09/1835\n\nThomas Higginbotham (1767-1835) VA\n\n-at his residence, in Amherst county, on the 5th inst. Thomas Higginbotham, Esq. Formerly a merchant of this place.\n\nLynchburg Virginian, Monday 02/16/1835\n\nDeparted this life Wednesday, the 4th inst. Mr. Thomas Higginbotham, of Amherst county, in the 64th year of his age. He was brought up from early life to the mercantile profession, which he pursued with success, and with the confidence and esteem of all with whom he had dealings, or knew him. He possessed a discriminating judgment and firmness of purpose, not to be shaken, when that judgment convinced him that he was right. He was generous and benevolent, humane and kind to all who deserved itno matter in what relationship they stood to him, whether as servant, assistant, relation or friendand charitable to the poor. Through life he observed an undeviating regard to truth, so much so as to disdain to deceive, even by a smile. May all living men practice his virtues. If he had failings, (and who has not?) they emanated chiefly from the goodness of his heart. If he was not a Christian, he possessed the virtues of one, and more than thousands who call themselves such. The writer of this knew him long and intimatelyand in this short sketch, of his character, has, he believes, followed his own great example of a rigid adherence to truth, without which, indeed, there is no virtue.\n\nThe Lynchburg Virginian, Thursday 07/07/1836\n\nJesse Higginbotham (1779-1836) VA\n\nOBITUARY\n\nDied, on the 8th ult. At Soldiers Joy, in Nelson, Mr. JESSE HIGGINBOTHAM, in the 57th year of his age.\n\nThe Lynchburg Virginian, Thursday 08/26/1841\n\nTirzah Higginbotham London (1783-1841) VA\n\nOBITUARY\n\nDied, at Poplar Grove, her residence, in the county of Amherst, on Sunday, the 1st inst., about 3 oclock, P.M., after a painful illness of sixteen days, which she bore with the greatest fortitude, Mrs. TIRZAH LONDON, widow and relict of John J. London, deceased, in the 60th year of her age. Mrs. London seemed conscious, when first taken sick, that she should never recover, and it was some time after her attack, before she would consent that a Physician might be called insaying \"they can do me no good.\" Notwithstanding this seeming knowledge that she must die soon, she was perfectly calm and resigned, and spoke to her children frequently with the most perfect composure, of her approaching end. She had been for many years a professor of Religion, but had never attached herself to any particular Church. In the death of this truly amiable and Christian lady, society has lost one of its brightest ornamentsher children, a mother who was kind and affectionate, almost to a faultand her servants, a mistress whose place can never be filled. Her sorrowing friends should mourn not as those who have no hope, for in her death she gave the strongest proof that \"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.\" To her bereaved children we would say, follow her bright example, practice the virtues taught by her, and prepare to meet her in Heaven, where \"parting shall be no more.\"\n\nThe Lynchburg Virginian, Thursday 11/11/1841\n\nThomas Higginbotham (1824-1841) VA\n\nOBITUARY\n\n-, at his fathers residence, in the county of Amherst, on Monday, the 1st inst., in the 18th year of his age, THOMAS HIGGINBOTHAM, son of Absalom Higginbotham. The writer of this small tribute to his memory knew him from infancy, and can with truth and justice say, that, he never was acquainted with a more amiable young man. Modest and retiring in his disposition and manners, unwilling to give trouble to others, he appeared to conceal the extent of his sufferings to the last. Could the constant assiduous attention of his devoted parents, the sympathies of his friends and physicians have averted the fatal blow, Thomas would still live; the pride of his family and friends. But it has pleased an all wise Providence to direct otherwise. But let them not sorrow as those who have no hope, for a few hours before he died that Divine Spirit which alone can inspire confidence in the Redeemer, enabled him to exhort all around him with a pathetic appeal to meet him in heaven, where I trust he now rests in the bosom of his Savior.\n\nLynchburg Virginian, Monday 08/18/1845\n\nDaniel Higginbotham (1781-1845) VA\n\n---, at Soldiers Joy, (his residence, in the county of Nelson) on Sunday, the 10th inst.

James Higginbotham (1812-1874) VA\n\nDEATH OF AN ESTIMABLE CITIZENMr. James Higginbotham, of Amherst county died at his residence near the Court House on Wednesday last, of inflammation of the stomach.

Her family has the sympathy of many friends in the county and elsewhere.\n\nThe Clinch Valley News, Friday 11/16/1894\n\nJames Bane Higginbotham (1846-1894) VA\n\nThe death of Mr. J. Bane Higginbotham on Sunday night last was a great shock to his family and friends. It was more distressing in that it occurred away from home. He was at Richlands at the time and was spending the night at the home of a friend when heart failure suddenly caused his death. He leaves a wife and two sons, both grown. The burial was at Liberty Hill on Tuesday. His mother, widow of the late Rees T. Higginbotham, at an advanced age, mourns the death of her eldest son. Other near relatives are his brother, W. J. Higginbotham, and sisters, Mrs. Jos. S. Gillespie, A. P. Gillespie and J. M. Hoge. In her sons, Sidney and Allen, the widow will find all comfort and help.\n\nThe Clinch Valley News, Friday 02/08/1895\n\nAllen Higginbotham (ca1855-1895) VA\n\nMr. Allen Higginbotham, who has suffered greatly for many years, died last week.\n\nThe News, Lynchburg, VA Sunday 05/16/1897\n\nMary Almir Higginbotham (1840-1897) VA\n\nDeath of Miss Almer Higginbotham\n\nAmherst, Va., May 15.(Correspondence.)A sad death occurred near our village on yesterday at the home of Mr. C. J. and the Misses Higginbotham. Miss M. Almer Higginbotham, a member of this happy family of brother and sisters, who had spent so many years of their lives together, was called to her reward after a very brief illness. Miss Higginbotham had about reached the meridian of life. She had been a most consistent member of the Ebenezer Baptist church for years, and an indefatigable worker in both church and Sabbath school, and her death will be a great loss to her church and community. The funeral services will take place this afternoon at five oclock, at the Higginbotham residence, services being conducted by the Rev. Jos. L. Wiley, pastor of the Baptist church of our village. The bereaved family have the sympathy of a large number of relatives and friends in their bereavement.\n\nTazewell Republican, Thursday 08/05/1897\n\nNancy A. Higginbotham (1875-1897) VA\n\nDeath of Miss Nannie Higginbotham\n\nOn Saturday afternoon a shadow of sadness fell upon our community when it was announced that Miss Nannie A. Higginbotham had departed this life. For about one month she had been lingering with ultimately proved to be a fatal illness, and at 3:05 p.m., surrounded by relatives and friends, who had tenderly and lovingly administered to her wants, she passed quietly to a brighter and happier land. From the testimony of those who were her intimate associates during her childhood and early womanhood her life had been recorded as that of a bright, pure girl and sweet Christian. Her death was a sad one, but full of comfort to those who were related to her by the close ties of blood and the warm associations of friendship and love.\n\nMiss Higginbotham was born the 17th of January, 1875, and was the daughter of Rees B. Higginbotham, deceased. She has five living sisters: Mrs. W. S. DeVault, Mrs. J. W. Chapman, Mrs. I. C. Dodd, Mrs. J. H. Brown and Miss Mary Higginbotham. The four last mentioned were with her during her last hours.\n\nIt had been announced that funeral services would be held in the Methodist church on Sunday Afternoon at 5 oclock. At that hour the church was filled to overflowing with persons of all ages, who had come to join in paying the last tribute of respect to the deceased.\n\nThe church had been draped in mourning by the tender hands of lady friends.\n\nAs the casket was born into the church it was preceded by Misses Joie Brittain, Alice Alexander, Jesse OKeeffe and Lula Steele, dressed in white and bearing floral offerings. These young ladies were intimate friends of the deceased. As they entered the church the choir sang: \"Go Bury Thy Sorrow.\" The funeral services were conducted by Rev. I. P. Martin and were continued and concluded in the following order: A vocal solo and chorus, \"Death is Only a Dream.\" Prayer, by rev. I. P. Martin. Hymn, \"Asleep in Jesus.\" Scriptural selections and funeral remarks. Prayer, by Rev. W. W. Ruff. Vocal duet, \"Some Sweet Day, By and By.\"\n\nThe passages of scripture were read from the bible of Miss Nannie and had been marked by her as favorite passages. They showed how deeply she was impressed with the truth of the word of God and how thoroughly her heart had been given to her Savior.\n\nAt the conclusion of the services at the church the remains were taken to the East End cemetery and interred. The following gentlemen were active pall bearers: Messrs. W. H. Alderson, Geo. W. Dodd, Barns Gillespie, W. J. Gillespie, J. S. Bottimore and A. S. Higginbotham. The following gentlemen acted as honorary pall bearers: Messrs> Frank Pyott, A. J. Higginbotham, C. W. Jones, Will Pierce, M. J. Hankins and J. T. Smith.\n\nThe procession that followed the remains to the grave was the largest we have seen since our residences in Tazewell.\n\nBristol News\n\nMiss Higginbotham Dead\n\nMany persons in Bristol will regret to learn that Miss Nannie Higginbotham died at her home in Tazewell, Va., at 3 oclock Saturday afternoon. Miss Higginbotham taught in the Virginia public school here last year and was engaged for the same duties this year.\n\nWhile here she made many friends, and her sweet amiable disposition made her much beloved by her acquaintances.Bristol News.\n\nTazewell Republican, Thursday 05/24/1900\n\nNancy Bane Higginbotham (1818-1900) VA\n\nOn Tuesday night, at 9:10 oclock, Mrs. Nancy Bane Higginbotham died at the home of her son-in-law, Mr. A. P. Gillespie, at this place. She had been in declining health for several months and her death was not unexpected.\n\nThe maiden name of the deceased was Nance Bane, and she was born at White Gate, Giles County, Va., on the 21st day of September, 1818, which made her at the time of her death eighty-two years, eight months and one day.\n\nFor more than sixty years Mrs. Higginbotham had been a consistent member of the Presbyterian church. She was married to Mr. T. J. Higginbotham, of this county, more than fifty-five years ago. Her husband died more than twenty years ago. She is survived by one son, Mr. W. J. Higginbotham, of Cedar Bluff; and three daughters, Mrs. A. P. Gillespie and Mrs. Jos. S. Gillespie, of Tazewell, and Mrs. J. Meek Hoge, of Burkes Garden. She left a number of grand-children, among them Messrs. A. S. and A. J. Higginbotham, sons of Mr. J. Bane Higginbotham, deceased.\n\nOn Wednesday morning the remains were taken to Liberty Hill, the old home of the deceased, and at 8 oclock funeral services were held in the Presbyterian church at that place, conducted by Revs. W. W. Ruff and Thomas Mowbray. These services were attended by a large congregation, composed of the descendants, relatives and friends of the deceased lady. The remains were buried in the graveyard at the old home place.\n\nThe Clinch Valley News, Friday 05/25/1900\n\nAmong the old citizens of Tazewell who have recently died, none will be more missed or lamented then the subject of this sketch, who was buried on last Wednesday. Mrs. Nancy Higginbotham died last Monday at the home of her daughter, Mrs. A. P. Gillespie. She was born in Giles County more than 81 years ago, and had lived in Tazewell more than 50 years, where she was widely known and highly esteemed for her womanly and Christian virtues.\n\nHer husband, the late Maj. Thos. J. Higginbotham, who died in 1879, was for many years one of Tazewells wealthy and most prominent citizens, to whom she was married in the year 1845, at her home in Giles County, near White Gate. There were five childrenthree daughters and two sons, viz: Mrs. A. P. and J. S. Gillespie, Mrs. J. Meek Hoge, of Burkes Garden, W. J. Higginbotham, of Cedar Bluff, and J. B. Higginbotham, deceased, the father of A. S. and A. J. Higginbotham, prominent young men of our county. Mrs. Higginbotham was aunt to Mrs. J. W. Chapman and Mrs. M. N. Higginbotham, who was directly of indirectly connected with the most prominent family in the county.\n\nHer death will be widely mourned and lamented. This sketch will be read by people scattered over many distant parts of the country, who will feel that they have been personally bereft in the death of this good woman.\n\nSince her girlhood Mrs. Higginbotham had been a zealous member of the Presbyterian church. Her membership was with the Presbyterian church at Liberty at the time of her death, from which the burial services took place, and in a church which she and her husband had been principally instrumental in building, and for many years the chief support.\n\nRev. Mr. Mowbray, her pastor, preached a great funeral sermon from the text, \"I know that my redeemer liveth\". Rev. Mr. Ruff, of this town took part in the services. A large concourse of people were present on the occasion, including friends and relatives from other counties and adjacent towns.\n\nTazewell Republican, Thursday 01/16/1902\n\nMary Alexander Thompson Higginbotham (ca1836-1902) VA\n\nAfter a lingering illness, Mrs. Mary Higginbotham died last night at the home of her daughter, Mrs. N. F. Adams, at Cedar Bluff. The deceased was a most estimable Christian lady, and left a number of relatives to mourn her death. Her maiden name was Alexander, she being a sister to our townsman, Mr. J. D. Alexander.\n\nIn the fall of 1862 she was married to James W. Thompson, then clerk of the county court of Tazewell county.

The deceased was sixty-six years old at the time of her death, and since early childhood had been a consistent member of the Presbyterian church.\n\nThe remains will be taken to the home of her son, Mr. S. J. Thompson, at Liberty Hill, and tomorrow to Thompson Valley for interment in the old Thompson graveyard.\n\nClinch Valley News, Friday 02/21/1902\n\nJoe Higginbotham (unk-1902) VA\n\nHigginbotham to Hang\n\nRoanoke, Va. Feb 17. Rev. Father Aneieux, a Catholic missionary among the colored people of Lynchburg, was a caller on Joe Higginbotham today. Higginbotham will be taken to Lynchburg Saturday or Sunday night without military escort. He is to be hung next Monday for criminal assault an attempt to kill Mrs. Ralph Webber in that city January 11th.\n\nTazewell Republican, Thursday 02/27/1902\n\nEditorial Paragraphs\n\nJoe Higginbotham was hung last Monday morning at Lynchburg for the horrible crime he committed in that city on the 11th of January. Some of the daily papers had extensive accounts of the hanging and also reproduced detailed reports of the crime. The press is constantly perverting the taste of the reading public by graphic and extensive descriptions of horrible crimes. We hope the time will come when the respectable press will see the necessity for giving as little space as possible to such things.\n\nClinch Valley News, Friday 02/28/1902\n\nHigginbotham Executed\n\nFull Confession With His Last Breath\n\nAll Is Done Decently\n\nHistory of Horrible Crime in Which Deliberate Attempt at Murder Followed and Assault\n\nLynchburg, Va., Feb. 24Joe Higginbotham, who on Jan. 11 assaulted and then cut the throat of Mas.

Downing, colored, of the Presbyterian church, left Roanoke on the train and accompanied the prisoner and guards to this city, which was reached at 1:50. The prisoner was taken up Seventh street to the jail, which is on Ninth and Clay, instead of going to the union depot; but neither there nor on the way to the jail were any crowds seen, every one being content that the execution of the laws sentence would be carried out.\n\nAt 4 oclock the Rev. L. L. Downing had come to the cell and prayed with him repeatedly, as later did the Rev. B. Tyrrell, of the Diamond Hill Baptist church, to which Joe belonged. He was neatly dressed in a dark suit and look in good condition.\n\nLast Statement\n\nTo most of those who came to look at him in his cell he refused to talk, but he assured The News correspondent, in reply to the question, that when he left the Webber home he took the route by way of the railroad to Hicksons mill, where he turned and came back. He said he did not go to the Presbyterian cemetery, where bloodhounds followed a track.\n\nAt 8:13 Sergeant Johnson, with his assistants, entered the cell, as did the spiritual advisers. Joe was told to stand up and take off his overcoat, which he did promptly. The handcuffs were then taken off his wrists and his hands were tied behind him. He then was escorted by two policemen to the gallows, walking with a firm tread up the steps and taking his place on the trap. The Rev. Downing then read the 23rd Psalm, after which Sergeant Johnson produced the death warrant. The noose was then adjusted, and his feet. Tyrrell was telling him in a low tone to trust in the Lord and be courageous. Joe was seemingly composed.\n\nSpeech On The Gallows\n\nWhen asked if he had anything to say; he replied in a firm voice: \"Dear friends, the time has come for me to pay for a crime of which I am guilty. It was a terrible crime, and Im sorry for that and all my sins. Men may not forgive me, but I feel that God will. I know that Ill be saved, because Jesus died for sinners.\"\n\nHe then quoted with some corrections the 16th verse of the third chapter of John, being prompted by the Rev. Downing. The black cap was drawn over his face and he stood perfectly erect. As Sergeant Johnson descended the steps said: \"Good-bye friends. Meet me in Heaven.\"\n\nAt 8:19 the bolt was pulled, and Joe was launched into eternity. The body turned round and round, and for a minute or two there were muscular contractions. At 8:26 the physicians reported the pulse at 120. At 8:28 it was 66; five minutes later it was very faint, and at 8:45 he was pronounced dead. At 8:45 a coffin was brought in, the rope was cut and the body was lowered into the coffin, which was then fastened, and taken in a hearse in waiting. This afternoon it will be shipped to the University College of Medicine, in Richmond.\n\nTazewell Republican, Thursday 06/04/1903\n\nJerry Higginbotham (unk-1903) VA African-American\n\nJerry Higginbotham, a young colored man, died from Typhoid fever on last Monday morning at 3 oclock at this mothers home in the west end of town.

V. Wilson Company, Inc., morticians, in charge.\n\nThe bier was banked with masses of flowers and illuminated with indirect lights.

It was committed to the tomb at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, April 25, 1934, in the Methodist Cemetery.\n\nIn one of numerous eulogies, the Rev. E. T. Henderson, acting pastor of the Rivermont Baptist Church, said McGustavus Higginbotham accepted a \"strategic place in the life of the community\" and the Rev. C. L. Somers, rector of the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, said the community is now not so warm since his heart has become still.\n\nThe principal eulogy, a prepared address, was delivered by the Rev. P. L. Harvey, pastor of the Diamond Hill Baptist Church, who said that Undertaker Higginbotham, having served his day and generation, now falls asleep, a sleep that shall be undisturbed until the departed friend reaches the other shore.\n\nThe Rev. James Carter, formerly connected with the Virginia Theological Seminary and College, was master of ceremonies. The service was conducted according to the wishes of the dead who said he was born about 8 o'clock at night, was married at that hour, and at that hour he chose to be buried.\n\nLong before 8 o'clock, the large pipe organ, situated in the gallery, behind the choir, pealed forth its solemn dirge. As a signal was given, the procession entered the church amid a veritable sea of faces. The two middle rows of benches has been reserved for the mourners, of whom there were a hundred or more, for fraternal organizations and other functionaries.\n\nThe vested clergymen led the procession, followed by the widow, children, and relatives. Just behind were members of the Odd Fellows and Knights of Pythias.\n\nAs soon as all were seated, the choir sang \"How Firm a Foundation,\" and all joined in the chorus. The Rev. Mr. Henderson read from the scriptures, quoting from the fifteenth chapter of the First Corinthians: \"By the grace of God, I am what I am.\"\n\nAfterward, the Rev. J. E. Dodson, the pastor of Jackson Street M. E. Church, prayed for the departed spirit, saying, \"In the midst of life, we are to death.\"\n\nThe master of ceremonies called for the reading of telegrams and resolutions received by the bereaved family, which were read by Undertaker C. V. Wilson. Notable among the resolutions received from the Colored Funeral Directors and Licensed Embalmers Association of Virginia. The Rev. Mr. Blackmore, of the Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows read a resolution adopted by the local lodge here, extolling the virtues of McGustavus Higginbotham, saying in part:\"We feel the loss of our brother, who has been called from labour to rest, but we...strive to carry on where...has left off.\"\n\n...allowed two minutes to make eulogies. The Rev. Mr. Henderson, among the first to speak, quoted from Longfellow and from Kipling's \"Lest We Forget\", and the Rev. Mr. Blackmore assured the vast assemblage that \"earth has no shadow that Heaven cannot heal.\"\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Harvey took his text from the book of Acts, saying: \"For David, after he had served his own day and generation, by the will of God fell asleep.\" He drew an analogy from the life of David and the life of Undertaker Higginbotham, saying that the latter now deserves his long rest.\n\n\"A quiet, unassuming man, he was, but yet always dignified.\" said the Rev. Mr. Harvey. The business he founded will long be a landmark in Lynchburg's history, and he is leaving a grand heritage.\"\n\n\"He falls asleep,\" the minister said, \"In complete relaxation as permitted only to a benign spirit, a sleep that is undisturbed. Sleep refreshes us so that we may continue on our journey.\"\n\nFraternal Rites said by the Knights of Pythias and Odd Fellows, clustered around the bier, under subdues lights, concluded the funeral ceremonial for McGustavus Higginbotham.\n\nHe is survived by his widow, Mrs. Lina Higginbotham, and the following children: Mrs. Lula Stewart, Milton, Sidney, Gregory, Viola, James, of Lynchburg, and Mrs. R.

The notice appears in a Ronceverte, W. Va., newspaper.\n\nThe Clinch Valley News, Friday 08/20/1943\n\n(From The West Virginia News, Ronceverte, W. Va)\n\nMrs. LaVaicia Barnes (Moore) Higginbotham was born in Abbs Valley, Tazewell County, Virginia on the old Captain James Moore homestead, Jan. 1, 1853, and died at her home near Frankford, Greenbrier county, West Va., July 21, 1943, at the advanced age of 90 years, 6 months and 20 days. She was a daughter of William Taylor and Mary Bowen (Barnes) Moore.\n\nOn November 25, 1875, she was united in marriage to Reese Thompson Higginbotham, who died March 16, 1912. To this union were born nine children, al of whom born in Tazewell county, Virginia. They are Miss Mary Amanda, living at the home place near Frankford; William M. Higginbotham, living near Frankford; Barbara Leticia, now Mrs. Charles G. Rader, of Maxwelton; Laura Matilda, now Mrs. Cecil Rodgers, of near Ronceverte; Sally Alice, deceased, Lavinina Brown, deceased; Oscar Donald Higginbotham, living at the old home place, near Frankford; India Allen, Now Mrs. Raymond E. Bright, of Frankford; Clyntha LaVicia, now Mrs. Robert M. Baldwin, of Richmond, Va.\n\nShe is also survived by a bother and sister, Oscar Bascom Moore, who lives on the old Capt. James Moore farm in Tazewell county, Va., and who is now in his 89th year, and who was unable to attend his sisters funeral; and Mrs. Mary Eliza (Moore) Davidson, of Tazewell. She was present for her sisters funeral.\n\nShe is also survived by three grandchildren, Miss Virginia Rader, Wm. Higginbotham, Jr., and Miss Nancy Ellen Bright, all of Greenbrier county.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Higginbotham lived in Tazewell county until 1902 when they purchased a farm near Frankford.\n\nFuneral services were held at the home on July 23rd, conducted by her pastor, Rev. R. W. Wilson, assisted by Rev. C. W. Fink, district supt. of Lewisburg district of the W. Va. Conference, and Rev. Lloyd Arehart, pastor of the Glenville Presbyterian church, who grew up a neighbor boy. She was buried in Frankford cemetery beside her husband.\n\nMrs. Higginbotham was a woman endowed with an unusual vitality of both mind and body. It was only about four months before her death that she gave up her knitting and crochet needles and was forced to quit work. She had no ailments or sickness; her body wore out; the gates were ajar and she entered the portals of a new life. Her energy had been boundless and her kindliness and consideration of others were the fixed and steadfast rule of her life.\n\nIn early childhood she united with the Methodist church and during her long life was actively interested in her church and all its activities. She was a member of Frankford Methodist church, successor of the Old Gilbo Methodist church, the first Methodist organization within the bounds of Greenbrier county and in which Bishop Francis Asbury preached.\n\nNo story of the life of Mother Higginbotham could be complete without reference to the life of her ancestors, which though local is of importance in the annals of our national history. The first of her clan to come to this country was James Moore, who came from North Ireland to Chester County, Pa., in the year 1726. There he married and later moved to Rockbridge county, Va., on the waters of Walker Creek. A son, James Moore, married Martha Poage. They established their home in Abbs Valley, Tazewell county. He was a private in the army of Gen. Andrew Lewis, at Point Pleasant, October 10, 1774. He was later commissioned a captain and he and his company took an active part in the Revolution in Virginia and the Carolinas. He and his company participated in the battle of Cowpens, Guilford Court House and Kings Mountain. Capt. Moore and his wife had a family of nine children. A son, James, was captured by the Indians on Sept. 7, 1784, and taken to Ohio. He returned to Virginia, March 26, 1789. he was the grandfather of Mrs. Higginbotham. On July 14, 1786, a band of Indians came into Abbs Valley and Captain Moore and the following of his children were killed: John, Rebecca, Alexander, William and Margaret. His wife, Martha, and another daughter, Jane, were taken prisoner to Ohio and burned at the stake. Mary, another daughter, and Martha Evans, a girl who lived in the home were taken captive, but they returned with James in 1789. Another son, Joseph, was with his grandfather in Rockbridge county and escaped the Indian attack and slaughter. The whole family was wiped out except James, Mary and Joseph.\n\nJames Moore went back to Abbs Valley and took charge of the Captain James Moore farm. His 3rd child by his first wife, Barbara Taylor, was Wm. Taylor Moore, and was the father of Mrs. Higginbotham. Mrs. Higginbothams grandfather, James Moore, died in 1851.\n\nOscar Bascom Moore, brother of Mrs. Higginbotham, owns and lives on the old Captain James Moore homestead. The descendants of Captain Moore erected a monument to his memory and his family on the site of the old log cabin home, in 1928.\n\nThe \"captive\" Mary Moore became the wife of Rev. Samuel Brown, Presbyterian minister.\n\nThey have many descendants, some of whom have lived in Greenbrier county. One, the Rev. John Calvin Brown, was one time president of the old Lewisburg Female Institute, now Greenbrier College.\n\nMother Higginbothams family of patriots and superb citizenship may have had its parallels in the annals or our country, but we doubt if it is excelled by any.\n\nThe Clinch Valley News, Friday 09/13/1946\n\nRebecca Alice Higginbotham (1856-1946) VA\n\nMiss Alice Higginbotham, age 89, died at the Mattie Williams hospital last Friday morning, following a lingering illness.
