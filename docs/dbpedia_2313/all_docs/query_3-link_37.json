        "text": "From THE BAKER COUNTY PRESS issue of 12 May, 1933\n\nBODY OF JESSE CREWS MANGLED BY TRAIN.\n\nThe body of Jesse Crews, 30, son of Mr. and Mrs. John Crews of Macclenny, was struck by a freight train at 3:40 Sunday morning in West Macclenny. The body was immediately taken from under the train by the crew and County Judge Dowling, Constable J. M. Brown, Justice of Peace Minger, and Night Watchman Griffis notified. Judge Minger impaneled a coroners jury who viewed the body and adjourned to meet Tuesday morning at 10 oclock.\n\nBurial service for Jesse Crews was held at Manntown Cemetery Monday afternoon, Rev. S. T. Duckworth of the Church of God officiating. The deceased was well known about Macclenny where he was reared and is the only son of Mr. and Mrs. John Crews.\n\nAt the inquest Tuesday morning the train crew composed of Russell Lamb, engineer; J. L. Lee, fireman; F. P. Walker, conductor; E. K. Stone, flagman; J. V. Lewis and D. W. Sloane, brakemen, testified that the body was cold when the train was stopped within 11 car lengths after striking the body. Mr. Lamb testified that he saw the body distinctly and noted that it was a white man and immediately applied the brakes and succeeded in bringing the train of 30 cars to a stop within 11 car lengths. He stated the train was making from 30 to 35 miles an hour, with the exception of two cars all were loaded. Mr. Lamb stated that the first car picked up the body on the brake beam and this caused the head to be shattered and one leg cut off below the knee and one foot. The body was otherwise bruised.\n\nTestimony introduced at the inquest showed that Crews and Clifford Hodges had been together about town until 12 oclock Saturday night when Crews went into the home of Mrs. Sara Bennett. Hodges is then said to have left Crews, whose whereabouts are unaccounted for until he was struck by the train. O. F. Shepard, watchman at Walters mill, testified that he heard 3 shots about 1 oclock in that section. Hodges stated that he left the Bennett house with Noah Ellison who was carrying a lantern and trying to fix a truck. Rich Lauramore testified in seeing Hodges about this time near the old dance hall. However, Hodges was found asleep on the road south of the railroad and near the section houses after the body of Crews was taken up. Hodges admits that they were drinking freely.\n\nAn axe with what is supposed to be blood on it was found on the railroad and new highway by L. B. Williams Sunday morning, but it has not been connected with the affair. Other theories are advanced that Crews was murdered and laid on the track to be mangled by the train or that he died and fell between the tracks and that he fell and struck his head on the rail, thus causing death. However, some of those have been substantiated by fact, and the coroners jury, after hearing all testimony, adjourned to meet again Friday, 12, at 2 oclock when the case will be gone into again and further evidence will try to be developed that will clear up the tragic death of Jesse Crews.\n\nThe State was represented at the hearing by County Prosecutor Walter A. Dopson, and Col. Culpepper of Jacksonville, appeared in the interest of the railroad.\n\nThe coroners jury was composed of J. R. Rowe, foreman, J. G. Crews, F. B. Crews, W. W. Lott, J. M. Thompson, and L. B. Williams."
