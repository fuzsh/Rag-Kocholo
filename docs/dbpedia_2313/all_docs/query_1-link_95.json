        "text": "Downtown Akron overhead skyline\n\nOverhead view of downtown Akron, which enjoyed the warmest December in 2015 of any year since 1889.\n\n(Shane Wynn, Akronstock)\n\nAKRON, Ohio -- The average temperature recorded by the National Weather Service in Akron last month was 43.7 degrees, the Beacon Journal reports, breaking a record of 41.1 degrees set in 1889.\n\nWarm ocean currents in the Pacific Ocean, called El Nino, are expected to continue keeping temperatures in the Midwest above average through this winter.\n\nAkron soldier taken prisoner in North Korea returns: Army Private David Burke, who was taken prisoner in North Korea in November 1950 and died in a prison there months later, was returned to Akron after the U.S. government identified his remains using DNA testing, the Beacon Journal reports.\n\nNorth Korea returned Burke's remains along with roughly 600 others in 1990.\n\nSandra Kurt appointed Summit County Clerk of Courts: Summit County Councilwoman Sandra Kurt was appointed by county Democrats this week to replace Dan Horrigan, who became mayor, the Beacon Journal reports.\n\nIn two months she is scheduled to run in a primary election for the $98,000-a-year clerk job.\n\nKurt, the Summit County Democratic Party's second chairperson, previously served as interim chairwoman when party boss Jeff Fusco took over the Akron mayorship after Garry Moneypenny's abrupt resignation in June.\n\nBradford Carlton and Neil Rothstein, two candidates who had filed to run against Kurt in the March primary, have both dropped out of the race. Carlton pledges his support to Kurt in a news release Friday.\n\nAkron officials converge on more bike lanes, friendlier streets: A task force in Akron has formed around politicians and officials, including Akron Planning Director Jason Segedy, to examine how to improve transit options and incorporate bike lanes throughout the Rubber City.\n\nSegedy told WKSU that the city's roads are largely overbuilt, providing flexibility to backfill extra space with bike lanes and even features that will help prevent runoff from running into the city's sewers.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates woman trains for weightlifting Olympics in Akron: Amna Al Haddad, of the United Arab Emirates, is in Akron training to become the first female Olympic weightlifter from the Middle Eastern nation, WKSU reports.\n\nAl Haddad says she would be the first \"hijabi\" competing in the Olympics, referring to the head covering she wears as part of her Muslim faith.\n\n\"A lot of people think, oh she is covered, she can't really do sports,\" Al Haddad told Jeff St. Clair. \"I feel my representation when I compete for the covered is to show you can still be who you are and pursue what you love.\"\n\nFrom the Amazon to Akron, what is fruit leather? Evan Delahanty blends fruit from the Amazon rain forest with locally grown produce to make fruit leather, a dried concentrated snack that contains the combined proteins and fiber of the fruits involved."
