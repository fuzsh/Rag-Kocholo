        "text": "PDF Version (1.28 Mb, 108 pages)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis publication was prepared by the Strategic Research and Statistics Directorate of Strategic Policy and Partnerships Sector in collaboration with the Indian Registration and Integrated Program Management Directorate, Regional Operations Sector, Indigenous Services Canada.\n\nShould you require clarification or additional population statistics, please call 1-800-567-9604 or e-mail aadnc.infopubs.aandc@canada.ca.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Registrar within the department of Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) is required by the Indian Act (Chapter I, Section 5 (1)) to record in the Indian Register the names of individuals who are registered under the act. The Indian Registration System (IRS) is a database which records individuals' names and a range of non-statutory data. The Registered Indian Population by Sex and Residence describes the IRS population as recorded at December 31, 2021. Descriptive statistics are developed from the IRS that include sex, residence, registry group, responsibility centre and region.\n\nDifference from the 2020 edition\n\nThere were 22 individuals who identified their sex as \"Other\" in 2021. Following confidentiality guidelines, data for these individuals were suppressed including to any district, regional and national totals.\n\nData organization\n\nData are organized in 2 broad sections. The first section provides summary statistics that include age and gender distribution, and residency comparisons for all regions and Canada.\n\nThe second section presents information for each registry group arranged by sex, residence, responsibility centre and region. For purposes of the Privacy Act, data in this section are collapsed into 3 columns by rolling residency fields 1 through 5 into one \"On reserve and on Crown land\" category. This minimizes the presence of small numbers in order to preserve privacy and data confidentiality.\n\nEntire registry groups with total membership of less than 40 people are suppressed from the Detailed tables section and indicated by a * in every cell. Furthermore, other techniques are in place such as suppression of individual cells smaller than 10 as well as suppression of adjacent cells to guard against residual disclosure. The counts of any suppressed cells, however, are included in aggregations to district, regional and national totals.\n\nIn total, data for 11 registry groups and general lists required suppression. In terms of registry groups, 4 in British Columbia were suppressed. As for general lists, there were 2 suppressions in Ontario, 1 in Manitoba, 2 in Saskatchewan, 1 in the Yukon and 1 in the Northwest Territories.\n\nTypes of residence\n\nThere are 6 types of residence, all of which are active fields used in the Indian Register. They represent individuals registered under the Indian Act, or who are descendants of individuals registered under the Indian Act, whose residency is captured by any one of the following:\n\nOn reserve own band\n\nOn reserve other band\n\nOn Crown land own band\n\nOn Crown land other band\n\nOn Crown land no band\n\nOff reserve\n\nUnlike some other ISC/Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs systems, the Indian Register does not distinguish between Indian Act reserves and lands affiliated to First Nations operating under self-government agreements (SGAs). Technically, once a SGA is ratified, the lands are no longer considered Indian Reserves under the provisions of the Indian Act. Therefore, individuals in the \"On reserve and on Crown land\" category may reside on lands legally defined as Indian reserves, on Indian settlements usually represented by Crown Lands and on other lands affiliated to self-governing First Nations.\n\nThe \"Off reserve\" category represents individuals affiliated to First Nations who may reside neither on reserve nor on Crown land according to the Indian Register.\n\nDistinction between the words \"band,\" \"registry group\" and \"reserve\"\n\nA band refers to a body of Indians for whose collective use and benefit lands have been set apart or money is held by the Crown, or declared to be a band for purposes of the Indian Act.\n\nA registry group is an administrative term used in the Indian Register. For details, please refer to point 1 under Source of data.\n\nA reserve, as defined in the Indian Act, means a tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, there were 619 bands or 634 registry groups in Canada and 3,406 reserves, not all of which are inhabited.\n\nNote to users\n\nThe Indian Register is meant to record individual names in accordance with specific sub-sections of the Indian Act. The Indian Register does not include all persons who are entitled to be registered according to the Indian Act, only those who have applied to be registered and whose entitlement has been verified. Therefore, data from the IRS may not fully meet the requirements of some statistical activities (e.g. demographic projections, migration patterns).\n\nThere is a reporting lag between the occurrence of a given life event and its being reported and recorded for updating of the Indian Register. This means that events occurring prior to December 31, 2021 may not be reflected in the Indian Register as documented on that date. The following examples illustrate this concept:\n\nInfants entitled to be registered at birth may not be registered by the December 31 reporting date. Parents often do not report the birth until a later year. It is estimated that of all births reported in 2021, approximately 90% had actually occurred prior to 2021.\n\nIndividuals can remain on the Indian Register for some time after they are deceased. A certificate of death or a confirmation of presumed death is normally required to remove a name from the Indian Register.\n\nResidency codes are typically updated when a life event is reported, although some bands update them more frequently. Residency remains a voluntary field in that the information is not mandatory to collect.\n\nAdministrative changes to the Indian Register in 2021\n\nBritish Columbia region 2020 groups affected by region 2021 changes by region Soda Creek (716)\n\nTobacco Plains (603)\n\nTsartlip (653)\n\nXatśūll First Nation (716)*\n\nYaq̓it ʔa·knuqⱡi'it (603)*\n\nW̱JOȽEȽP (653)*\n\n* The changes have not yet been implemented in the Indian Register as some departmental systems cannot handle non-Latin script. The Indian Registry team is working to resolve this issue.\n\nSummary Statistics\n\nRegistered Indian population by region and type of residence, December 31, 2021\n\nRegion Number of bands On reserve\n\n(a) On Crown land\n\n(b) Off\n\nreserve\n\n(c) Total\n\na + b + c Atlantic 34 25,397 57 42,345 67,799 Quebec 40 57,520 1,599 36,721 95,840 Ontario * 126 97,318 1,984 127,428 226,730 Manitoba 63 93,923 1,062 71,046 166,031 Saskatchewan 70 78,340 1,576 86,765 166,681 Alberta * 45 77,156 3,243 54,428 134,827 British Columbia 199 62,698 386 89,690 152,774 Yukon * 16 556 3,381 5,805 9,742 Northwest Territories 26 391 12,413 7,091 19,895 Canada 619 493,299 25,701 521,319 1,040,319\n\n* Consult Source of data for band / registry group affiliations\n\nOn reserve and/or on Crown land counts can include individuals living on lands affiliated with First Nations operating under self-government agreements.\n\nRegistered Indian population by type of residence for All Canada, December 31, 1994 – 2021\n\nYear Number of bands On reserve\n\n(a) On Crown land\n\n(b) Off\n\nreserve\n\n(c) Total a + b + c 1994 607 314,843 21,800 237,014 573,657 1995 608 325,453 22,466 245,131 593,050 1996 609 331,289 23,080 256,505 610,874 1997 608 341,825 23,981 261,629 627,435 1998 609 351,671 24,056 266,687 642,414 1999 610 360,707 24,071 275,112 659,890 2000 612 368,556 23,437 283,506 675,499 2001 612 373,121 23,567 293,413 690,101 2002 614 380,067 23,270 301,514 704,851 2003 614 386,605 23,066 309,825 719,496 2004 614 391,459 23,963 318,204 733,626 2005 615 397,980 24,203 326,188 748,371 2006 615 404,117 24,329 335,109 763,555 2007 615 410,889 23,697 343,464 778,050 2008 615 419,647 23,956 350,437 794,040 2009 615 427,554 24,234 357,518 809,306 2010 616 434,730 24,429 365,182 824,341 2011 617 441,891 24,706 401,609 868,206 2012 617 448,690 25,352 427,011 901,053 2013 617 455,381 25,687 438,677 919,745 2014 617 462,184 25,878 448,163 936,225 2015 618 468,762 25,959 458,322 953,043 2016 618 476,223 25,789 468,550 970,562 2017 618 483,675 25,341 478,504 987,520 2018 618 486,928 25,351 482,388 994,667 2019 619 490,071 25,757 493,127 1,008,955 2020 619 491,842 25,676 503,838 1,021,356\n\n2021 619 493,299 25,701 521,319 1,040,319 On reserve and/or on Crown land counts can include individuals living on lands affiliated with First Nations operating under self-government agreements.\n\nThe 25 largest bands in Canada, December 31, 2021\n\nBand Name Region Indian Register population Change in ranking\n\n(from 2020) Six Nations of the Grand River (121) 1 Ontario 28,019 No change Qalipu Mi'kmaq First Nation (034) Atlantic 24,583 No change Mohawks of Akwesasne (159) Ontario 13,100 No change Blood (435) Alberta 12,761 No change Lac La Ronge (353) Saskatchewan 11,617 Up one position Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation (355) Saskatchewan 11,572 Down one position Mohawks of Kahnawá:ke (070) Quebec 11,343 No change Saddle Lake Cree Nation (462) Alberta 11,256 No change Peguis (269) Manitoba 10,842 No change Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte (164) Ontario 10,461 No change Samson (444) Alberta 9,139 No change Cross Lake Band of Indians (276) Manitoba 9,138 No change Norway House Cree Nation (278) Manitoba 8,605 No change Bigstone Cree Nation (458) Alberta 8,500 No change Wikwemikong (175) Ontario 8,454 No change Première Nation des Pekuakamiulnuatsh (076) Quebec 8,373 Up two positions Fort Alexander (262) Manitoba 8,273 Down one position Siksika Nation (430) Alberta 7,559 Down one position Sandy Bay (283) Manitoba 7,054 No change Onion Lake Cree Nation (344) Saskatchewan 6,658 No change Opaskwayak Cree Nation (315) Manitoba 6,474 Up one position Oneida Nation of the Thames (169) Ontario 6,417 Down one position Little Red River Cree Nation (447) Alberta 6,160 No change Stoney (471)2 Alberta 5,639 No change Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (313) Manitoba 5,441 No change\n\n1 Six Nations of the Grand River consists of the following 13 registry groups: Bay of Quinte Mohawk, Bearfoot Onondaga, Delaware, Konadaha Seneca, Lower Cayuga, Lower Mohawk, Niharondasa Seneca, Oneida, Onondaga Clear Sky, Tuscarora, Upper Cayuga, Upper Mohawk and Walker Mohawk.\n\n2 Stoney consists of the 3 registry groups: Bearspaw, Chiniki and Wesley.\n\nBands in Canada by size, December 31, 2021\n\nRegistry groups in Canada by size, December 31, 2021\n\nRegistered Indian population, on and off reserve by age and sex, December 31, 2021\n\nIn the following regional tables and charts, \"On reserve\" includes individuals living on Crown land and on other lands affiliated with First Nations operating under self-government agreements.\n\nAtlantic region\n\nRegistered Indian population, by type of residence, age groups and sex, December 31, 2021 Age On reserve Off reserve Total -
