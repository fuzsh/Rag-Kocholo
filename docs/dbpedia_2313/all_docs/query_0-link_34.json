        "meta_description": "Abstract. A set of seasonal drought forecast models was assessed and verified for the\nJaguaribe River in semiarid northeastern Brazil. Meteorological seasonal\nforecasts were provided by the operational forecasting system used at FUNCEME\n(CearÃ¡'s research foundation for meteorology) and by the European Centre\nfor Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Three downscaling approaches\n(empirical quantile mapping, extended downscaling and weather pattern\nclassification) were tested and combined with the models in hindcast mode for\nthe period 1981 to 2014. The forecast issue time was January and the forecast\nperiod was January to June. Hydrological drought indices were obtained by\nfitting a multivariate linear regression to observations. In short, it was\npossible to obtain forecasts for (a)Â monthly precipitation,\n(b)Â meteorological drought indices, and (c)Â hydrological drought indices. The skill of the forecasting systems was evaluated with regard to root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), the Brier skill score (BSS) and the relative operating\ncharacteristic skill score (ROCSS). The tested forecasting products showed\nsimilar performance in the analyzed metrics. Forecasts of monthly\nprecipitation had little or no skill considering RMSE and mostly no skill\nwith BSS. A similar picture was seen when forecasting meteorological drought\nindices: low skill regarding RMSE and BSS and significant skill when\ndiscriminating hit rate and false alarm rate given by the ROCSS (forecasting\ndrought events of, e.g.,Â SPEI1 showed a ROCSS of around 0.5). Regarding\nthe temporal variation of the forecast skill of the meteorological indices,\nit was greatest for April, when compared to the remaining months of the rainy\nseason, while the skill of reservoir volume forecasts decreased with lead\ntime. This work showed that a multi-model ensemble can forecast drought events of\ntimescales relevant to water managers in northeastern Brazil with skill. But\nno or little skill could be found in the forecasts of monthly precipitation\nor drought indices of lower scales, like SPI1. Both this work and those\nhere revisited showed that major steps forward are needed in forecasting the\nrainy season in northeastern Brazil.",

Their validation generally hindered by lack of knowing the truth. We propose a virtual framework, in which this truth is fully known and the sensor observations for Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing, Remote Sensing, and Hydrogravimetry are simulated. This allows the rigourous testing of these virtual sensors to understand their effectiveness and limitations.\n\nMultidisciplinary approach to understand the salinization of fractured crystalline aquifers in semi-arid region\n\nMarjorie Beate Kreis, Jean-Denis Taupin, Nicolas Patris, Patrick Lachassagne, Virginie Vergnaud-Ayraud, Julien Daniel Pierre Burte, Christian Leduc, and Eduardo SÃ¡vio Passos Rodrigues Martins\n\nProc. IAHS, 385, 393–398, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-393-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-393-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study used hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical data to understand the salinization processes of the crystalline groundwater (GW) in Ceará, Brazil. Results demonstrate that GW is generally recent and recharged by meteoric waters mainly through localized infiltration. The study suggests that GW, originally bicarbonated, becomes progressively enriched in chloride due to the dissolution and leaching of salts that have precipitated in the unsaturated zone and pond sediments during dryer periods.\n\nIsotopic signature of precipitation in the semi-arid region of CearÃ¡, Northeastern Brazil\n\nMarjorie B.

Moreover, the isotopic data available were mainly linked to the establishment of the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation, which was paralyzed in the 1990s despite the extensive use of these data to improve the global knowledge of hydrological processes. This study allowed to improve the characterization of the isotopic signal of precipitation in NEB.\n\nTechnical Note: Revisiting the general calibration of cosmic-ray neutron sensors to estimate soil water content\n\nMaik Heistermann, Till Francke, Martin SchrÃ¶n, and Sascha E. Oswald\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 989–1000, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-989-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-989-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a non-invasive technique used to obtain estimates of soil water content (SWC) at a horizontal footprint of around 150 m and a vertical penetration depth of up to 30 cm. However, typical CRNS applications require the local calibration of a function which converts neutron counts to SWC. As an alternative, we propose a generalized function as a way to avoid the use of local reference measurements of SWC and hence a major source of uncertainty.\n\nTesting a novel sensor design to jointly measure cosmic-ray neutrons, muons and gamma rays for non-invasive soil moisture estimation\n\nStefano Gianessi, Matteo Polo, Luca Stevanato, Marcello Lunardon, Till Francke, Sascha E.

Our capability to measure this variable is still, however, limited. In this study, we show the tests conducted on a new soil moisture sensor at several locations. The results show that the new sensor is a valid and compact alternative to more conventional, non-invasive soil moisture sensors that can pave the way for a wide range of applications.\n\nProjecting sediment export from two highly glacierized alpine catchments under climate change: exploring non-parametric regression as an analysis tool\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 139–161, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow suspended sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas responds to future climate change is hardly assessable as many interacting processes are involved, and appropriate physical models are lacking. We present the first study, to our knowledge, exploring machine learning to project sediment export until 2100 in two high-alpine catchments. We find that uncertainties due to methodological limitations are small until 2070. Negative trends imply that peak sediment may have already passed.\n\nHESS Opinions: Drought impacts as failed prospects\n\nGermano G. Ribeiro Neto, Sarra Kchouk, Lieke A. Melsen, Louise Cavalcante, David W. Walker, Art Dewulf, Alexandre C. Costa, Eduardo S. P. R. Martins, and Pieter R. van Oel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4217–4225, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4217-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4217-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPeople induce and modify droughts. However, we do not know exactly how relevant human and natural processes interact nor how to evaluate the co-evolution of people and water. Prospect theory can help us to explain the emergence of drought impacts leading to failed welfare expectations (“prospects”) due to water shortage. Our approach helps to explain socio-hydrological phenomena, such as reservoir effects, and can contribute to integrated drought management considering the local context.\n\nShallow and deep learning of extreme rainfall events from convective atmospheres\n\nGerd BÃ¼rger and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3065–3077, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3065-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3065-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur subject is a new catalogue of radar-based heavy rainfall events (CatRaRE) over Germany and how it relates to the concurrent atmospheric circulation. We classify reanalyzed daily atmospheric fields of convective indices according to CatRaRE, using conventional statistical and more recent machine learning algorithms, and apply them to present and future atmospheres. Increasing trends are projected for CatRaRE-type probabilities, from reanalyzed as well as from simulated atmospheric fields.\n\nThree years of soil moisture observations by a dense cosmic-ray neutron sensing cluster at an agricultural research site in north-east Germany\n\nMaik Heistermann, Till Francke, Lena Scheiffele, Katya Dimitrova Petrova, Christian Budach, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Benjamin Trost, Daniel Rasche, Andreas GÃ¼ntner, Veronika DÃ¶pper, Michael FÃ¶rster, Markus KÃ¶hli, Lisa Angermann, Nikolaos Antonoglou, Manuela Zude-Sasse, and Sascha E. Oswald\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 3243–3262, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3243-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-3243-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for the non-invasive estimation of root-zone soil water content (SWC). The signal observed by a single CRNS sensor is influenced by the SWC in a radius of around 150 m (the footprint). Here, we have put together a cluster of eight CRNS sensors with overlapping footprints at an agricultural research site in north-east Germany. That way, we hope to represent spatial SWC heterogeneity instead of retrieving just one average SWC estimate from a single sensor.\n\nReconstructing five decades of sediment export from two glacierized high-alpine catchments in Tyrol, Austria, using nonparametric regression\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, Christoph Mayer, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1841–1863, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1841-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1841-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a suitable method to reconstruct sediment export from decadal records of hydroclimatic predictors (discharge, precipitation, temperature) and shorter suspended sediment measurements. This lets us fill the knowledge gap on how sediment export from glacierized high-alpine areas has responded to climate change. We find positive trends in sediment export from the two investigated nested catchments with step-like increases around 1981 which are linked to crucial changes in glacier melt.\n\nSuspended sediment and discharge dynamics in a glaciated alpine environment: identifying crucial areas and time periods on several spatial and temporal scales in the Ãtztal, Austria\n\nLena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Erwin Rottler, Theresa Blume, Johannes SchÃ¶ber, and Axel Bronstert\n\nEarth Surf. Dynam., 10, 653–669, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-653-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-653-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change fundamentally alters glaciated high-alpine areas, but it is unclear how this affects riverine sediment transport. As a first step, we aimed to identify the most important processes and source areas in three nested catchments in the Ötztal, Austria, in the past 15 years. We found that areas above 2500 m were crucial and that summer rainstorms were less influential than glacier melt. These findings provide a baseline for studies on future changes in high-alpine sediment dynamics.\n\nSoil moisture observation in a forested headwater catchment: combining a dense cosmic-ray neutron sensor network with roving and hydrogravimetry at the TERENO site WÃ¼stebach\n\nMaik Heistermann, Heye Bogena, Till Francke, Andreas GÃ¼ntner, Jannis Jakobi, Daniel Rasche, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Veronika DÃ¶pper, Benjamin Fersch, Jannis Groh, Amol Patil, Thomas PÃ¼tz, Marvin Reich, Steffen Zacharias, Carmen Zengerle, and Sascha Oswald\n\nEarth Syst.

Stationary, mobile, and airborne CRNS technology monitored the root-zone water dynamics as well as spatial heterogeneity in the 0.4 km2 area. The 15 CRNS stations were supported by a hydrogravimeter, biomass sampling, and a wireless soil sensor network to facilitate holistic hydrological analysis.\n\nCOSMOS-Europe: a European network of cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture sensors\n\nHeye Reemt Bogena, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Jannis Jakobi, Patrizia Ney, Steffen Zacharias, Mie Andreasen, Roland Baatz, David Boorman, Mustafa Berk Duygu, Miguel Angel Eguibar-GalÃ¡n, Benjamin Fersch, Till Franke, Josie Geris, MarÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Sanchis, Yann Kerr, Tobias Korf, Zalalem Mengistu, Arnaud Mialon, Paolo Nasta, Jerzy Nitychoruk, Vassilios Pisinaras, Daniel Rasche, Rafael Rosolem, Hami Said, Paul Schattan, Marek Zreda, Stefan Achleitner, Eduardo Albentosa-HernÃ¡ndez, Zuhal AkyÃ¼rek, Theresa Blume, Antonio del Campo, Davide Canone, Katya Dimitrova-Petrova, John G.

This data paper presents long-term soil moisture measurements recorded by 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) operated by 24 institutions and distributed across major climate zones in Europe. Data processing followed harmonized protocols and state-of-the-art methods to generate consistent and comparable soil moisture products and to facilitate continental-scale analysis of hydrological extremes.\n\nAssessing the feasibility of a directional cosmic-ray neutron sensing sensor for estimating soil moisture\n\nTill Francke, Maik Heistermann, Markus KÃ¶hli, Christian Budach, Martin SchrÃ¶n, and Sascha E. Oswald\n\nGeosci. Instrum. Method. Data Syst., 11, 75–92, https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-11-75-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-11-75-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a non-invasive tool for measuring hydrogen pools like soil moisture, snow, or vegetation. This study presents a directional shielding approach, aiming to measure in specific directions only. The results show that non-directional neutron transport blurs the signal of the targeted direction. For typical instruments, this does not allow acceptable precision at a daily time resolution. However, the mere statistical distinction of two rates is feasible.\n\nSpatio-temporal soil moisture retrieval at the catchment scale using a dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors\n\nMaik Heistermann, Till Francke, Martin SchrÃ¶n, and Sascha E. Oswald\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 4807–4824, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4807-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4807-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a powerful technique for retrieving representative estimates of soil moisture in footprints extending over hectometres in the horizontal and decimetres in the vertical. This study, however, demonstrates the potential of CRNS to obtain spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture beyond isolated footprints. To that end, we analyse data from a unique observational campaign that featured a dense network of more than 20 neutron detectors in an area of just 1 km2.\n\nProjected changes in Rhine River flood seasonality under global warming\n\nErwin Rottler, Axel Bronstert, Gerd BÃ¼rger, and Oldrich Rakovec\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Results indicate that future changes in flood characteristics are controlled by increases in precipitation sums and diminishing snowpacks. The decreases in snowmelt can counterbalance increasing precipitation, resulting in only small and transient changes in streamflow maxima.\n\nA dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors for soil moisture observation in a highly instrumented pre-Alpine headwater catchment in Germany\n\nBenjamin Fersch, Till Francke, Maik Heistermann, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Veronika DÃ¶pper, Jannis Jakobi, Gabriele Baroni, Theresa Blume, Heye Bogena, Christian Budach, Tobias GrÃ¤nzig, Michael FÃ¶rster, Andreas GÃ¼ntner, Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen, Mandy Kasner, Markus KÃ¶hli, Birgit Kleinschmit, Harald Kunstmann, Amol Patil, Daniel Rasche, Lena Scheiffele, Ulrich Schmidt, Sandra Szulc-Seyfried, Jannis Weimar, Steffen Zacharias, Marek Zreda, Bernd Heber, Ralf Kiese, Vladimir Mares, Hannes Mollenhauer, Ingo VÃ¶lksch, and Sascha Oswald\n\nEarth Syst.

We identify storage reservoirs as an important factor redistributing runoff from summer to winter. Furthermore, our results hint at more (intense) rainfall in recent decades. Detected increases in high discharge can be traced back to corresponding changes in precipitation.\n\nSeasonal drought prediction for semiarid northeast Brazil: what is the added value of a process-based hydrological model?\n\nTobias Pilz, JosÃ© Miguel Delgado, Sebastian Voss, Klaus Vormoor, Till Francke, Alexandre Cunha Costa, Eduardo Martins, and Axel Bronstert\n\nHydrol.

Data, 10, 1063–1075, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1063-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-1063-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a hydro-sedimentological dataset for the IsÃ¡bena catchment, northeastern Spain, for the period 2010â2018. It contains the results of several years of monitoring rainfall, discharge and sediment flux and analysing soil spectroscopic properties. The dataset features data in high spatial and temporal resolution suitable for the advanced process understanding of water and sediment fluxes, their origin and connectivity and sediment budgeting and for model development.\n\nEffects of sample size on estimation of rainfall extremes at high temperatures\n\nBerry Boessenkool, Gerd BÃ¼rger, and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 17, 1623–1629, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-1623-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-1623-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRainfall is more intense at high temperatures than in cooler weather, as can be seen in summer thunder storms. The relationship between temperature and rainfall intensity seems to invert at very high temperatures, however. There are some possible meteorological explanations, but we propose that part of the reason might be the low number of observations, due to which the actually possible values are underestimated. We propose a better way to estimate high quantiles from small datasets.\n\nlumpR 2.0.0: an R package facilitating landscape discretisation for hillslope-based hydrological models\n\nTobias Pilz, Till Francke, and Axel Bronstert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 3001–3023, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3001-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3001-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo discretise and transfer a landscape into a hydrological model, many different algorithms and software implementations exist. These are, however, often model specific, commercial, and allow for only a limited workflow automation. Overcoming these limitations, the software package lumpR was developed. It employs an hillslope-based discretisation algorithm directed at large-scale application. The software is demonstrated in a case study and crucial discretisation parameters are investigated.\n\nCan local climate variability be explained by weather patterns? A multi-station evaluation for the Rhine basin\n\nAline Murawski, Gerd BÃ¼rger, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

A downscaling based on conditioning a stochastic weather generator on weather patterns is a promising approach. Here the link between patterns and local climate is tested, and the skill of GCMs in reproducing these patterns is evaluated.\n\nProjections of the Affluent Natural Energy (ANE) for the Brazilian electricity sector based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios of IPCC-AR5\n\nCleiton da Silva Silveira, Francisco de Assis de Souza Filho, Francisco das Chagas Vasconcelos Junior, and E.

The relative role of hydrological model parameter uncertainty, compared to other uncertainty sources from our applied ensemble, is highest in those catchments showing the largest shifts in flood seasonality which indicates a lack in parameter robustness under non-stationary hydroclimatological conditions.\n\nFloods and climate: emerging perspectives for flood risk assessment and management\n\nB.

They include uncertainties coming from climate forcings, streamflow measurement, and hydrological model error (for HydrREM). Comparisons with other hydrological reconstructions and independent/dependent observations show the added value of the two reconstructions in terms of quality, uncertainty estimation, and representation of extremes.\n\nThe agricultural expansion in South America's Dry Chaco: regional hydroclimate effects\n\nMarÃ­a Agostina Bracalenti, Omar V. MÃ¼ller, Miguel A. Lovino, and Ernesto Hugo Berbery\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 3281–3303, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3281-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3281-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Gran Chaco is a large, dry forest in South America that has been heavily deforested, particularly in the dry Chaco subregion. This deforestation, mainly driven by the expansion of the agricultural frontier, has changed the land's characteristics, affecting the local and regional climate. The study reveals that deforestation has resulted in reduced precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff, and if intensive agriculture continues, it could make summers in this arid region even drier and hotter.\n\nMachine-learning-constrained projection of bivariate hydrological drought magnitudes and socioeconomic risks over China\n\nRutong Liu, Jiabo Yin, Louise Slater, Shengyu Kang, Yuanhang Yang, Pan Liu, Jiali Guo, Xihui Gu, Xiang Zhang, and Aliaksandr Volchak\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

We develop a cascade modeling chain to project future bivariate hydrological drought characteristics over China, using five bias-corrected global climate model outputs under three shared socioeconomic pathways, five hydrological models, and a deep-learning model.\n\nImproving runoff simulation in the Western United States with Noah-MP and variable infiltration capacity\n\nLu Su, Dennis P. Lettenmaier, Ming Pan, and Benjamin Bass\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 3079–3097, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3079-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3079-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe fine-tuned the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) and Noah-MP models across 263 river basins in the Western US. We developed transfer relationships to similar basins and extended the fine-tuned parameters to ungauged basins. Both models performed best in humid areas, and the skills improved post-calibration. VIC outperforms Noah-MP in all but interior dry basins following regionalization. VIC simulates annual mean streamflow and high flow well, while Noah-MP performs better for low flows.\n\nSpatial variability in the seasonal precipitation lapse rates in complex topographical regions â application in France\n\nValentin Dura, Guillaume Evin, Anne-Catherine Favre, and David Penot\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2579–2601, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2579-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2579-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe increase in precipitation as a function of elevation is poorly understood in areas with complex topography. In this article, the reproduction of these orographic gradients is assessed with several precipitation products. The best product is a simulation from a convection-permitting regional climate model. The corresponding seasonal gradients vary significantly in space, with higher values for the first topographical barriers exposed to the dominant air mass circulations.\n\nAssessing downscaling methods to simulate hydrologically relevant weather scenarios from a global atmospheric reanalysis: case study of the upper RhÃ´ne River (1902â2009)\n\nCaroline Legrand, BenoÃ®t Hingray, Bruno Wilhelm, and Martin MÃ©nÃ©goz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2139–2166, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change is expected to increase flood hazard worldwide. The evolution is typically estimated from multi-model chains, where regional hydrological scenarios are simulated from weather scenarios derived from coarse-resolution atmospheric outputs of climate models. We show that two such chains are able to reproduce, from an atmospheric reanalysis, the 1902–2009 discharge variations and floods of the upper Rhône alpine river, provided that the weather scenarios are bias-corrected.\n\nGlobal total precipitable water variations and trends over the period 1958â2021\n\nNenghan Wan, Xiaomao Lin, Roger A. Pielke Sr., Xubin Zeng, and Amanda M. Nelson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2123–2137, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2123-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2123-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal warming occurs at a rate of 0.21 K per decade, resulting in about 9.5 % K−1 of water vapor response to temperature from 1993 to 2021. Terrestrial areas experienced greater warming than the ocean, with a ratio of 2 : 1. The total precipitable water change in response to surface temperature changes showed a variation around 6 % K−1–8 % K−1 in the 15–55° N latitude band. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms leading to different water vapor responses.\n\nAssessing decadal- to centennial-scale nonstationary variability in meteorological drought trends\n\nKyungmin Sung, Max C. A. Torbenson, and James H. Stagge\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

A novel approach merges tree-ring proxy data (North American Seasonal Precipitation Atlas – NASPA) with instrumental precipitation datasets by temporally downscaling proxy data, correcting biases, and analyzing shared trends in normal and extreme precipitation anomalies. We identify regions experiencing recent unprecedented shifts towards drier or wetter conditions and shifts in seasonality.\n\nIdentification of compound drought and heatwave events on a daily scale and across four seasons\n\nBaoying Shan, Niko E. C. Verhoest, and Bernard De Baets\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2065–2080, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2065-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2065-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study developed a convenient and new method to identify the occurrence of droughts, heatwaves, and co-occurring droughts and heatwaves (CDHW) across four seasons. Using this method, we could establish the start and/or end dates of drought (or heatwave) events. We found an increase in the frequency of heatwaves and CDHW events in Belgium caused by climate change. We also found that different months have different chances of CDHW events.\n\nPotential for historically unprecedented Australian droughts from natural variability and climate change\n\nGeorgina M. Falster, Nicky M. Wright, Nerilie J. Abram, Anna M. Ukkola, and Benjamin J. Henley\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1383–1401, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1383-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1383-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMulti-year droughts have severe environmental and economic impacts, but the instrumental record is too short to characterise multi-year drought variability. We assessed the nature of Australian multi-year droughts using simulations of the past millennium from 11 climate models. We show that multi-decadal megadroughts are a natural feature of the Australian hydroclimate. Human-caused climate change is also driving a tendency towards longer droughts in eastern and southwestern Australia.\n\nFlood risk assessment for Indian sub-continental river basins\n\nUrmin Vegad, Yadu Pokhrel, and Vimal Mishra\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1107–1126, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1107-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1107-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA large population is affected by floods, which leave their footprints through human mortality, migration, and damage to agriculture and infrastructure, during almost every summer monsoon season in India. Despite the massive damage of floods, sub-basin level flood risk assessment is still in its infancy and needs to be improved. Using hydrological and hydrodynamic models, we reconstructed sub-basin level observed floods for the 1901–2020 period.\n\nKey ingredients in regional climate modelling for improving the representation of typhoon tracks and intensities\n\nQi Sun, Patrick Olschewski, Jianhui Wei, Zhan Tian, Laixiang Sun, Harald Kunstmann, and Patrick Laux\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

This study provides a reference to set up regional climate models for TC simulations. They contribute to a better TC process understanding and assess the potential changes and risks of TCs in the future. This lays the foundation for hydrodynamical modelling, from which the cities' disaster management and defence could benefit.\n\nDivergent future drought projections in UK river flows and groundwater levels\n\nSimon Parry, Jonathan D. Mackay, Thomas Chitson, Jamie Hannaford, Eugene Magee, Maliko Tanguy, Victoria A. Bell, Katie Facer-Childs, Alison Kay, Rosanna Lane, Robert J. Moore, Stephen Turner, and John Wallbank\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Throughout the UK, river flows are likely to be lower in future, with droughts more prolonged and severe. However, whilst these changes are also found in some boreholes, in others, higher levels and less severe drought are indicated for the future. This has implications for the future balance between surface water and groundwater below.\n\nPredicting extreme sub-hourly precipitation intensification based on temperature shifts\n\nFrancesco Marra, Marika Koukoula, Antonio Canale, and Nadav Peleg\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 375–389, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-375-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-375-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new physical-based method for estimating extreme sub-hourly precipitation return levels (i.e., intensity–duration–frequency, IDF, curves), which are critical for the estimation of future floods. The proposed model, named TENAX, incorporates temperature as a covariate in a physically consistent manner. It has only a few parameters and can be easily set for any climate station given sub-hourly precipitation and temperature data are available.\n\nSpatiotemporal responses of runoff to climate change on the southern Tibetan Plateau\n\nHe Sun, Tandong Yao, Fengge Su, Wei Yang, and Deliang Chen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-11,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-11, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur findings revealed runoff generation is dominated by rainfall runoff in the YZ, and the largest glacier runoff contribution is in the downstream sub-basin. Annual runoff trends indicate an increase in the NX but a decrease in the NX-BXK for 1971–2020, due to contrasting precipitation changes. Total runoff across the sub-basins will consistently increase through the 21st century, mostly resulting from increased rainfall runoff.\n\nFROSTBYTE: A reproducible data-driven workflow for probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasting in snow-fed river basins across North America\n\nLouise Arnal, Martyn P. Clark, Alain Pietroniro, Vincent Vionnet, David R. Casson, Paul H. Whitfield, Vincent Fortin, Andrew W. Wood, Wouter J. M. Knoben, Brandi W. Newton, and Colleen Walford\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3040,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3040, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForecasting river flows months in advance is crucial for many water sectors and society. In N. America, snowmelt is a key driver of river flow. This study presents a statistical workflow using snow data to forecast flows months ahead in N. American snow-fed rivers. Variations in predictability across the continent are evident, raising concerns about future river flow predictability amid a changing (snow) climate. The reproducible workflow hosted on GitHub supports collaborative and open science.\n\nHydroclimatic processes as the primary drivers of the Early Khvalynian transgression of the Caspian Sea: new developments\n\nAlexander Gelfan, Andrey Panin, Andrey Kalugin, Polina Morozova, Vladimir Semenov, Alexey Sidorchuk, Vadim Ukraintsev, and Konstantin Ushakov\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 241–259, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-241-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-241-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPaleogeographical data show that 17–13 ka BP, the Caspian Sea level was 80 m above the current level. There are large disagreements on the genesis of this “Great” Khvalynian transgression of the sea, and we tried to shed light on this issue. Using climate and hydrological models as well as the paleo-reconstructions, we proved that the transgression could be initiated solely by hydroclimatic factors within the deglaciation period in the absence of the glacial meltwater effect.\n\nAccounting for hydroclimatic properties in flood frequency analysis procedures\n\nJoeri B. Reinders and Samuel E. Munoz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 217–227, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-217-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-217-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlooding presents a major hazard for people and infrastructure along waterways; however, it is challenging to study the likelihood of a flood magnitude occurring regionally due to a lack of long discharge records. We show that hydroclimatic variables like Köppen climate regions and precipitation intensity explain part of the variance in flood frequency distributions and thus reduce the uncertainty of flood probability estimates. This gives water managers a tool to locally improve flood analysis.\n\nAn increase in the spatial extent of European floods over the last 70 years\n\nBeijing Fang, Emanuele Bevacqua, Oldrich Rakovec, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2890,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2890, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use grid-based runoff from a hydrological model to identify large spatiotemporally connected flood events in Europe, assess extents' trends over the last 70 years, and attribute the trends to different drivers. Our findings reveal a general increase in flood extent, with regional variations driven by diverse factors. The study not only enables a thorough examination of flood events across multiple basins but also highlights the potential challenges arising from changing flood extents.\n\nUnderstanding the influence of âhotâ models in climate impact studies: a hydrological perspective\n\nMehrad Rahimpour Asenjan, Francois Brissette, Jean-Luc Martel, and Richard Arsenault\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 4355–4367, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4355-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-4355-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models are central to climate change impact studies. Some models project a future deemed too hot by many. We looked at how including hot models may skew the result of impact studies. Applied to hydrology, this study shows that hot models do not systematically produce hydrological outliers.\n\nA semi-parametric hourly spaceâtime weather generator\n\nRoss Pidoto and Uwe Haberlandt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3957–3975, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3957-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3957-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong continuous time series of meteorological variables (i.e. rainfall, temperature) are required for the modelling of floods. Observed time series are generally too short or not available. Weather generators are models that reproduce observed weather time series. This study extends an existing station-based rainfall model into space by enforcing observed spatial rainfall characteristics. To model other variables (i.e. temperature) the model is then coupled to a simple resampling approach.\n\nA principal-component-based strategy for regionalisation of precipitation intensityâdurationâfrequency (IDF) statistics\n\nKajsa Maria Parding, Rasmus Emil Benestad, Anita Verpe Dyrrdal, and Julia Lutz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3719–3732, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3719-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3719-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIntensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves describe the likelihood of extreme rainfall and are used in hydrology and engineering, for example, for flood forecasting and water management. We develop a model to estimate IDF curves from daily meteorological observations, which are more widely available than the observations on finer timescales (minutes to hours) that are needed for IDF calculations. The method is applied to all data at once, making it efficient and robust to individual errors.\n\nAccounting for precipitation asymmetry in a multiplicative random cascade disaggregation model\n\nKaltrina Maloku, Benoit Hingray, and Guillaume Evin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3643–3661, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3643-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3643-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh-resolution precipitation data, needed for many applications in hydrology, are typically rare. Such data can be simulated from daily precipitation with stochastic disaggregation. In this work, multiplicative random cascades are used to disaggregate time series of 40 min precipitation from daily precipitation for 81 Swiss stations. We show that very relevant statistics of precipitation are obtained when precipitation asymmetry is accounted for in a continuous way in the cascade generator.\n\nOn the combined use of rain gauges and GPM IMERG satellite rainfall products: testing cellular automata-based interpolation methodology on the Tanaro river basin in Italy\n\nAnnalina Lombardi, Barbara Tomassetti, Valentina Colaiuda, Ludovico Di Antonio, Paolo Tuccella, Mario Montopoli, Giovanni Ravazzani, Frank Silvio Marzano, Raffaele Lidori, and Giulia Panegrossi\n\nHydrol.

The study is the first detailed analysis of the potential usage of the Cellular Automata technique to merge different rainfall data inputs to hydrological models. This work shows an improvement in the performance of hydrological simulations when satellite and rain gauge data are merged.\n\nSeasonal soil moisture and crop yield prediction with fifth-generation seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) long-range meteorological forecasts in a land surface modelling approach\n\nTheresa Boas, Heye Reemt Bogena, Dongryeol Ryu, Harry Vereecken, Andrew Western, and Harrie-Jan Hendricks Franssen\n\nHydrol.

Sci., 27, 3143–3167, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3143-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3143-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our study, we tested the utility and skill of a state-of-the-art forecasting product for the prediction of regional crop productivity using a land surface model. Our results illustrate the potential value and skill of combining seasonal forecasts with modelling applications to generate variables of interest for stakeholders, such as annual crop yield for specific cash crops and regions. In addition, this study provides useful insights for future technical model evaluations and improvements.\n\nA genetic particle filter scheme for univariate snow cover assimilation into Noah-MP model across snow climates\n\nYuanhong You, Chunlin Huang, Zuo Wang, Jinliang Hou, Ying Zhang, and Peipei Xu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2919–2933, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2919-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2919-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study aims to investigate the performance of a genetic particle filter which was used as a snow data assimilation scheme across different snow climates. The results demonstrated that the genetic algorithm can effectively solve the problem of particle degeneration and impoverishment in a particle filter algorithm. The system has revealed a low sensitivity to the particle number in point-scale application of the ground snow depth measurement.\n\nInvestigating the response of landâatmosphere interactions and feedbacks to spatial representation of irrigation in a coupled modeling framework\n\nPatricia Lawston-Parker, Joseph A. Santanello Jr., and Nathaniel W. Chaney\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2787–2805, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2787-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2787-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIrrigation has been shown to impact weather and climate, but it has only recently been considered in prediction models. Prescribing where (globally) irrigation takes place is important to accurately simulate its impacts on temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Here, we evaluated three different irrigation maps in a weather model and found that the extent and intensity of irrigated areas and their boundaries are important drivers of weather impacts resulting from human practices.\n\nValidation of precipitation reanalysis products for rainfall-runoff modelling in Slovenia\n\nMarcos Julien Alexopoulos, Hannes MÃ¼ller-Thomy, Patrick Nistahl, Mojca Å raj, and Nejc Bezak\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2559–2578, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2559-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2559-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor rainfall-runoff simulation of a certain area, hydrological models are used, which requires precipitation data and temperature data as input. Since these are often not available as observations, we have tested simulation results from atmospheric models. ERA5-Land and COSMO-REA6 were tested for Slovenian catchments. Both lead to good simulations results. Their usage enables the use of rainfall-runoff simulation in unobserved catchments as a requisite for, e.g., flood protection measures.\n\nStatistical post-processing of precipitation forecasts using circulation classifications and spatiotemporal deep neural networks\n\nTuantuan Zhang, Zhongmin Liang, Wentao Li, Jun Wang, Yiming Hu, and Binquan Li\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1945–1960, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1945-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1945-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use circulation classifications and spatiotemporal deep neural networks to correct raw daily forecast precipitation by combining large-scale circulation patterns with local spatiotemporal information. We find that the method not only captures the westward and northward movement of the western Pacific subtropical high but also shows substantially higher bias-correction capabilities than existing standard methods in terms of spatial scale, timescale, and intensity.\n\nSensitivity of the pseudo-global warming method under flood conditions: a case study from the northeasternÂ US\n\nZeyu Xue, Paul Ullrich, and Lai-Yung Ruby Leung\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1909–1927, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1909-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1909-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examine the sensitivity and robustness of conclusions drawn from the PGW method over the NEUS by conducting multiple PGW experiments and varying the perturbation spatial scales and choice of perturbed meteorological variables to provide a guideline for this increasingly popular regional modeling method. Overall, we recommend PGW experiments be performed with perturbations to temperature or the combination of temperature and wind at the gridpoint scale, depending on the research question.\n\nHybrid forecasting: blending climate predictions with AI models\n\nLouise J. Slater, Louise Arnal, Marie-AmÃ©lie Boucher, Annie Y.-Y. Chang, Simon Moulds, Conor Murphy, Grey Nearing, Guy Shalev, Chaopeng Shen, Linda Speight, Gabriele Villarini, Robert L. Wilby, Andrew Wood, and Massimiliano Zappa\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1865–1889, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1865-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1865-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHybrid forecasting systems combine data-driven methods with physics-based weather and climate models to improve the accuracy of predictions for meteorological and hydroclimatic events such as rainfall, temperature, streamflow, floods, droughts, tropical cyclones, or atmospheric rivers. We review recent developments in hybrid forecasting and outline key challenges and opportunities in the field.\n\nSensitivities of subgrid-scale physics schemes, meteorological forcing, and topographic radiation in atmosphere-through-bedrock integrated process models: a case study in the Upper Colorado River basin\n\nZexuan Xu, Erica R. Siirila-Woodburn, Alan M. Rhoades, and Daniel Feldman\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1771–1789, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1771-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1771-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe goal of this study is to understand the uncertainties of different modeling configurations for simulating hydroclimate responses in the mountainous watershed. We run a group of climate models with various configurations and evaluate them against various reference datasets. This paper integrates a climate model and a hydrology model to have a full understanding of the atmospheric-through-bedrock hydrological processes.\n\nLocal moisture recycling across the globe\n\nJolanda J. E. Theeuwen, Arie Staal, Obbe A. Tuinenburg, Bert V. M. Hamelers, and Stefan C. Dekker\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1457–1476, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1457-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1457-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEvaporation changes over land affect rainfall over land via moisture recycling. We calculated the local moisture recycling ratio globally, which describes the fraction of evaporated moisture that rains out within approx. 50 km of its source location. This recycling peaks in summer as well as over wet and elevated regions. Local moisture recycling provides insight into the local impacts of evaporation changes and can be used to study the influence of regreening on local rainfall.\n\nHow well does a convection-permitting regional climate model represent the reverse orographic effect of extreme hourly precipitation?\n\nEleonora Dallan, Francesco Marra, Giorgia Fosser, Marco Marani, Giuseppe Formetta, Christoph SchÃ¤r, and Marco Borga\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1133–1149, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1133-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1133-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nConvection-permitting climate models could represent future changes in extreme short-duration precipitation, which is critical for risk management. We use a non-asymptotic statistical method to estimate extremes from 10 years of simulations in an orographically complex area. Despite overall good agreement with rain gauges, the observed decrease of hourly extremes with elevation is not fully represented by the model. Climate model adjustment methods should consider the role of orography.\n\nRegionalisation of rainfall depthâdurationâfrequency curves with different data types in Germany\n\nBora Shehu, Winfried Willems, Henrike Stockel, Luisa-Bianca Thiele, and Uwe Haberlandt\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1109–1132, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1109-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1109-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRainfall volumes at varying duration and frequencies are required for many engineering water works. These design volumes have been provided by KOSTRA-DWD in Germany. However, a revision of the KOSTRA-DWD is required, in order to consider the recent state-of-the-art and additional data. For this purpose, in our study, we investigate different methods and data available to achieve the best procedure that will serve as a basis for the development of the new KOSTRA-DWD product.\n\nThe suitability of a seasonal ensemble hybrid framework including data-driven approaches for hydrological forecasting\n\nSandra M. Hauswirth, Marc F. P. Bierkens, Vincent Beijk, and Niko Wanders\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 501–517, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-501-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-501-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForecasts on water availability are important for water managers. We test a hybrid framework based on machine learning models and global input data for generating seasonal forecasts. Our evaluation shows that our discharge and surface water level predictions are able to create reliable forecasts up to 2 months ahead. We show that a hybrid framework, developed for local purposes and combined and rerun with global data, can create valuable information similar to large-scale forecasting models.\n\nContinuous streamflow prediction in ungauged basins: long short-term memory neural networks clearly outperform traditional hydrological models\n\nRichard Arsenault, Jean-Luc Martel, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Brunet, FranÃ§ois Brissette, and Juliane Mai\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 139–157, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-139-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-139-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPredicting flow in rivers where no observation records are available is a daunting task. For decades, hydrological models were set up on these gauges, and their parameters were estimated based on the hydrological response of similar or nearby catchments where records exist. New developments in machine learning have now made it possible to estimate flows at ungauged locations more precisely than with hydrological models. This study confirms the performance superiority of machine learning models.\n\nDaily ensemble river discharge reforecasts and real-time forecasts from the operational Global Flood Awareness System\n\nShaun Harrigan, Ervin Zsoter, Hannah Cloke, Peter Salamon, and Christel Prudhomme\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1–19, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReal-time river discharge forecasts and reforecasts from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) have been made publicly available, together with an evaluation of forecast skill at the global scale. Results show that GloFAS is skillful in over 93 % of catchments in the short (1–3 d) and medium range (5–15 d) and skillful in over 80 % of catchments in the extended lead time (16–30 d). Skill is summarised in a new layer on the GloFAS Web Map Viewer to aid decision-making.\n\nSpatial distribution of oceanic moisture contributions to precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau\n\nYing Li, Chenghao Wang, Ru Huang, Denghua Yan, Hui Peng, and Shangbin Xiao\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6413–6426, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6413-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6413-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpatial quantification of oceanic moisture contribution to the precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) contributes to the reliable assessments of regional water resources and the interpretation of paleo archives in the region. Based on atmospheric reanalysis datasets and numerical moisture tracking, this work reveals the previously underestimated oceanic moisture contributions brought by the westerlies in winter and the overestimated moisture contributions from the Indian Ocean in summer.\n\nEnsemble streamflow prediction considering the influence of reservoirs in Narmada River Basin, India\n\nUrmin Vegad and Vimal Mishra\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6361–6378, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6361-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6361-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods cause enormous damage to infrastructure and agriculture in India. However, the utility of ensemble meteorological forecast for hydrologic prediction has not been examined. Moreover, Indian river basins have a considerable influence of reservoirs that alter the natural flow variability. We developed a hydrologic modelling-based streamflow prediction considering the influence of reservoirs in India.\n\nDeclining water resources in response to global warming and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns over southern Mediterranean France\n\nCamille Labrousse, Wolfgang Ludwig, SÃ©bastien Pinel, Mahrez Sadaoui, Andrea Toreti, and Guillaume Lacquement\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6055–6071, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6055-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6055-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe interest of this study is to demonstrate that we identify two zones in our study area whose hydroclimatic behaviours are uneven. By investigating relationships between the hydroclimatic conditions in both clusters for past observations with the overall atmospheric functioning, we show that the inequalities are mainly driven by a different control of the atmospheric teleconnection patterns over the area.\n\nLinking the complementary evaporation relationship with the Budyko framework for ungauged areas in Australia\n\nDaeha Kim, Minha Choi, and Jong Ahn Chun\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5955–5969, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5955-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5955-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe proposed a practical method that predicts the evaporation rates on land surfaces (ET) where only atmospheric data are available. Using a traditional equation that describes partitioning of precipitation into ET and streamflow, we could approximately identify the key parameter of the predicting formulation based on land–atmosphere interactions. The simple method conditioned by local climates outperformed sophisticated models in reproducing water-balance estimates across Australia.\n\nRisks of seasonal extreme rainfall events in Bangladesh under 1.5 and 2.0 Â°C warmer worlds â how anthropogenic aerosols change the story\n\nRuksana H. Rimi, Karsten Haustein, Emily J. Barbour, Sarah N. Sparrow, Sihan Li, David C. H. Wallom, and Myles R. Allen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5737–5756, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5737-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5737-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme rainfall events are major concerns in Bangladesh. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and damage nearly harvestable crops in pre-monsoon season. While in monsoon season, the impacts can range from widespread agricultural loss, huge property damage, to loss of lives and livelihoods. This paper assesses the role of anthropogenic climate change drivers in changing risks of extreme rainfall events during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons at local sub-regional-scale within Bangladesh.\n\nPan evaporation is increased by submerged macrophytes\n\nBrigitta Simon-GÃ¡spÃ¡r, GÃ¡bor SoÃ³s, and Angela Anda\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4741–4756, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4741-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4741-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to climate change, it is extremely important to determine evaporation as accurately as possible. In nature, there are sediments and macrophytes in the open waters; thus, one of the aims was to investigate their effect on evaporation. The second aim of this paper was to estimate daily evaporation by using different models, which, according to results, have high priority in the evaporation prediction. Water management can obtain useful information from the results of the current research.\n\nEvaluation of water flux predictive models developed using eddy-covariance observations and machine learning: a meta-analysis\n\nHaiyang Shi, Geping Luo, Olaf Hellwich, Mingjuan Xie, Chen Zhang, Yu Zhang, Yuangang Wang, Xiuliang Yuan, Xiaofei Ma, Wenqiang Zhang, Alishir Kurban, Philippe De Maeyer, and Tim Van de Voorde\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4603–4618, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4603-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4603-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere have been many machine learning simulation studies based on eddy-covariance observations for water flux and evapotranspiration. We performed a meta-analysis of such studies to clarify the impact of different algorithms and predictors, etc., on the reported prediction accuracy. It can, to some extent, guide future global water flux modeling studies and help us better understand the terrestrial ecosystem water cycle.\n\nCharacterizing basin-scale precipitation gradients in the Third Pole region using a high-resolution atmospheric simulation-based dataset\n\nYaozhi Jiang, Kun Yang, Hua Yang, Hui Lu, Yingying Chen, Xu Zhou, Jing Sun, Yuan Yang, and Yan Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4587–4601, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4587-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4587-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study quantified the altitudinal precipitation gradients (PGs) over the Third Pole (TP). Most sub-basins in the TP have positive PGs, and negative PGs are found in the Himalayas, the Hengduan Mountains and the western Kunlun. PGs are positively correlated with wind speed but negatively correlated with relative humidity. In addition, PGs tend to be positive at smaller spatial scales compared to those at larger scales. The findings can assist precipitation interpolation in the data-sparse TP.\n\nA comparison of hydrological models with different level of complexity in Alpine regions in the context of climate change\n\nFrancesca Carletti, Adrien Michel, Francesca Casale, Alice Burri, Daniele Bocchiola, Mathias Bavay, and Michael Lehning\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3447–3475, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3447-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3447-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh Alpine catchments are dominated by the melting of seasonal snow cover and glaciers, whose amount and seasonality are expected to be modified by climate change. This paper compares the performances of different types of models in reproducing discharge among two catchments under present conditions and climate change. Despite many advantages, the use of simpler models for climate change applications is controversial as they do not fully represent the physics of the involved processes.\n\nModelling evaporation with local, regional and global BROOK90 frameworks: importance of parameterization and forcing\n\nIvan Vorobevskii, Thi Thanh Luong, Rico Kronenberg, Thomas GrÃ¼nwald, and Christian Bernhofer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3177–3239, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3177-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3177-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the study we analysed the uncertainties of the meteorological data and model parameterization for evaporation modelling. We have taken a physically based lumped BROOK90 model and applied it in three different frameworks using global, regional and local datasets. Validating the simulations with eddy-covariance data from five stations in Germany, we found that the accuracy model parameterization plays a bigger role than the quality of the meteorological forcing.\n\nHydrological concept formation inside long short-term memoryÂ (LSTM) networks\n\nThomas Lees, Steven Reece, Frederik Kratzert, Daniel Klotz, Martin Gauch, Jens De Bruijn, Reetik Kumar Sahu, Peter Greve, Louise Slater, and Simon J. Dadson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3079–3101, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3079-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3079-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite the accuracy of deep learning rainfall-runoff models, we are currently uncertain of what these models have learned. In this study we explore the internals of one deep learning architecture and demonstrate that the model learns about intermediate hydrological stores of soil moisture and snow water, despite never having seen data about these processes during training. Therefore, we find evidence that the deep learning approach learns a physically realistic mapping from inputs to outputs.\n\nA two-step merging strategy for incorporating multi-source precipitation products and gauge observations using machine learning classification and regression over China\n\nHuajin Lei, Hongyu Zhao, and Tianqi Ao\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2969–2995, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2969-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2969-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow to combine multi-source precipitation data effectively is one of the hot topics in hydrometeorological research. This study presents a two-step merging strategy based on machine learning for multi-source precipitation merging over China. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively distinguishes the occurrence of precipitation events and reduces the error in precipitation estimation. This method is robust and may be successfully applied to other areas even with scarce data.\n\nCited articles\n\nBÃ¼rger, G.: Expanded downscaling for generating local weather scenarios, Clim.
