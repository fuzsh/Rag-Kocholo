In 1888, Paris had a population of 2,326,449, according to the Annuaire Statistique. During that year, 51,230 people died in the city, giving an all-cause mortality rate of 22.0 deaths per 1000 population. According to official figures, in the following year, 1889, the mortality rate increased by 1 point to 23.0 deaths per 1000. In 1890, it stood at 22.8 deaths per 1000, and in 1891, it fell back to 21.5 deaths per 1000.

According to statistics from the Annuaire, one of the main causes of death at the end of the nineteenth century was respiratory disease (mainly pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, but we shall also examine acute and chronic bronchitis). Between 1885 and 1889, the main peaks of deaths from these respiratory infections were concentrated in the winter months. The sequence was uniform, with deaths from these causes beginning to increase in the autumn of each year, rising to a peak between January and April and declining sharply in the summer. The peak, therefore, coincided with the coldest months of the year.

For example, in September 1885, pneumonia accounted for just 200 deaths in Paris, but it rose during that winter, peaking at 682 deaths in March 1886. This represented a 3.4-fold increase in deaths.

In 1888, the lowest death toll from pneumonia occurred in September when 127 people died of the disease in Paris. That winter, mortality from pneumonia peaked in March at 355 deaths. In other words the number of people dying from pneumonia almost tripled (Ã—2.8).
