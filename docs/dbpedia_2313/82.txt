The scale of the Johnstown flood of 1889 is difficult to visualize. Summarizing the flood’s impact in statistics and facts is a quick way to convey the enormity of the event. Here is a list of some of the most descriptive facts about the Johnstown flood.

2,209 people died. (Click here for a PDF list of flood victims, including their addresses, ages and burial places.)

99 entire families died, including 396 children

124 women and 198 men were left widowed.

More than 750 victims were never identified and rest in the Plot of the Unknown in Grandview Cemetery

Bodies were found as far away as Cincinnati, and as late as 1911

The American Red Cross, led by Clara Barton and organized in 1881, arrived in Johnstown on June 5, 1889 – it was the first major peacetime disaster relief effort for the Red Cross.

Johnstown has suffered additional significant floods in its history, including in 1936 and 1977.
