He was born at Chachapoyas (Peru) in 1550; died at Asunción (Paraguay) in 1605. His father Pedro de Añazco was a Spanish captain, companion of Sebastián de Belalcázar in the conquest of Ecuador; and through him, it is said, the first notice of the "Dorado" of Guatavitá reached the Spaniards in Ecuador.

At the age of twenty-two, Añazco became a Jesuit. In 1577, he was sent to Julí, on Lake Titicaca. Thence he passed to the Chaco tribe among the Abipón people and in 1593 to Paraguay, where he would die.

He was an indefatigable missionary and a zealous student of Indian languages. Highly respectable authorities like Gonzalez Dávila and Lozano credit him with having composed grammars, "doctrines" and catechisms in nine different Indian languages of South America.
