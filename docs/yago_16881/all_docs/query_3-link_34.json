He married his sweetheart, Freda Yingst, in November, that same year, and moved to Indiana.\n\nThis young couple was blessed with three children, twins, Jeff and Rhonda, and later Joy.\n\nJames worked various jobs to support his family. From being a field worker, to working in a factory, to then having a successful career as an office furniture salesman, from which he acquired the nickname, “Big Jim.”\n\nJames was a faithful and active member of his church, serving his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ for over 60 years. For 40 of those years, he was at Cornerstone Baptist Church, where he was a Sunday School Teacher, a Deacon and a Song Leader.\n\nJames was a University of Arkansas fan, watching his Razorbacks whenever he could. He was also a big Indiana University, Colts, and Pacer’s fan.\n\nJames was preceded in death by his parents, Chester and Zula Meredith, and two sisters.\n\nJames is survived by his wife of 70 years, Freda Meredith; his children, Jeff (Brenda), Rhonda (Mark), and Joy (Mark); his grandchildren, Kelly (Brian), Luke (Jessica), John (John), James (Tobi), and Michael (Ashley); great grandchildren, Carson, Sarah, Mariah, Lilah, Cole, Carter, Scarlet, Ryder, Colton, Cody, Camden, Jayden, Braxton, and Archer James; brothers, Richard (Billie) William, Jimmy and Allen (Ina).\n\nA service will be held at Noon on Friday, April 21 at Cornerstone Baptist Church, 10701 E 56th St, Indianapolis, IN 46235, with visitation from 11 a.m. to service time.
