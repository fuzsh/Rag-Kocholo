        "text": "I am Rev. Dr. Darrell Greenawalt (folks call me Pastor Darrell), I have been serving Christ United Methodist Church, Franklin, since July 2018. I grew up attending Nixon UMC, south of Butler, where I graduated from Knoch HS. I earned a BFA in art history/photography from Ohio University, returning to WPA in 1989 after earning a MDiv from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, IL. Recently, I completed a DMin program in Pastoral Counseling at Ashland Theological Seminary, focusing on fatherhood.\n\nMy 30-year ministry career began at Jeanette: Gethsemane UMC. I later served Lander UMC, South Greensburg UMC, Girard/Lake City UMC’s, and Saegertown UMC, before moving to Franklin.\n\nI married Sharon in 1998 and am the very proud father of four boys: Nathan, Aaron, Noah, and Toby. Our family enjoys hiking, biking and traveling.\n\nDuring my ministry, I have served on the Sessions Ministry Team, the Superintendency Committee of the Greensburg District, the Erie-Meadville District Committee on Ministry, the Episcopacy Committee, and on the board of directors of EUMA (The Erie United Methodist Alliance).\n\nMost importantly, I am a follower of Jesus Christ and desire to become more like Christ every day. As Romans 1:11-12 says, I am anxious to spend time with the folks of Christ UMC that we may mutually encourage each other. May the Kingdom of God be advanced by the work we will do together!\n\nRomans 1:11-12 NIV\n\n“I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.”\n\nI joined the staff of Christ Church in 1996 as a part-time Director of Music Ministries. During those early years, I worked bi-vocationally in various positions within county and state government. From an early age, I loved the function and dynamics of the local church. My passion is singing and playing in concert ministry, but more so in the worship planning and leading. I love to help others encounter the presence of God through active participation. In the intervening years, I received my license to preach from the United Methodist Church, and was appointed as the Associate Pastor of Christ Church in 2009. I subsequently completed my Course of Study at United Theological Seminary, during which time I left my work with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2011 to serve as Associate Pastor in a full-time capacity. I am responsible for overseeing the worship life of Christ Church, providing a leading role in pastoral care, and helping lead and shepherd alongside our lead pastor. In addition to my training at United Theological Seminary, I attended Clarion State College and Penn State University, receiving degrees in Business and Agriculture. My wife, Kim, is my closest partner in ministry – and in life. We are the parents of two adult children; Bethany and Matt, who are married to wonderful spouses. We also have three grandchildren, and we live near Tionesta, PA. I enjoy the out-of-doors, particularly working on our small farm which has been in our family for over 125 years, family gatherings, and quiet, unhurried time reading and working with my hands.\n\nColossians 3:16-17 NIV\n\n“Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.”\n\nAnne received her bachelor’s degree from Geneva College in Beaver Falls, PA. She has lived in Franklin for the past 24 years with her husband, Clarence, where they raised their two children, Riley, and Maddison.\n\nAnne is the daughter of a retired United Methodist pastor who taught her early on that the greatest relationship she would ever have is with the Father.\n\nShe has enjoyed many years as a restaurant owner and caterer, and for the past 13 years, has worked closely in the social service field, working with children and families. She has been the Outreach Director at CUMC since 2019 and has found such joy working with her church family and building many new relationships.\n\nJodi is a Venango native…FHS grad, Air Force Retired, Geneva College Grad. Together with her husband, Doug, share 4 unique boys (Jonathan, David, Seth and Alex), 4 very special grandchildren (Brian, Daisy Mae, Seleena and Mable Rae), and a number of furry and feathered critters on our little homestead!\n\nJodi has worked in a multitude of Youth Ministry/Faith Based Programs. Her travels and experiences have been diverse. She has worked with young Athabaskan Indians in Galena, Alaska. She has worked with AWANAs and Cub Scouts in Saudi Arabia. She has worked with youth aiding inner city homeless through NY School of Urban Ministry. She has worked with multiple Scouting Programs in Franklin and in the Pittsburgh area as well. Jodi most recently worked for the state of PA, Dept of Human Services, as a Training Supervisor, with special focus in children and youth, families in need and Trauma Informed Care.\n\nJodi and Doug have been at Christ Church for 4 years, volunteering in several ministries, getting to know the church family. Jodi loves to cook, craft, grow goodies from the ground (flowers, food, can/preserve) and share all the abundance that God has blessed her with… because God IS Good… ALL the Time!\n\nJodi’s heart is to share her life’s journey with Jesus:\n\nGOD IS REAL to her…. And she wants the youth to KNOW, that HE is REAL.\n\n~ “Be still, and know that I am God” Psalm 46:10"
