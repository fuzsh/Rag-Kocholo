For more information email Lisa.\n\nJames Franklin, born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia was married to Mary Jane Lauderdale of Botetourt County shortly before the Revolutionary War.[1] The couple had the following known children:\n\nJohn Franklin[2]\n\nIsaac Franklin[2]\n\nJames Franklin Jr.[2]\n\nWilliam Franklin[2]\n\nAnn Franklin[2]\n\nBetsey Franklin[2]\n\nJane Franklin[2]\n\nSally Franklin[2]\n\nAlbert C. Franklin[2]\n\nIn 1815 James Franklin Sr. sold 132 acres to his son Isaac Franklin, in Sumner County, Tennessee.[3]\n\nJames Franklin wrote his will in Sumner County, Tennessee on 18 Dec 1828 and it was presented to the court there for probate at the Feb 1829 term.[2][4]\n\nThis profile includes collaborative information about James' slave holdings. Per Census records and Will records the following information has been gleaned.\n\nThese enslaved persons were named in the will of James Franklin:\n\nJacob[2]\n\nMoses[2]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nThere is major confusion in this family as to the ancestry and descendants of this James Franklin, and which children actually belong to Henry and Margaret Franklin, and a lot of work documenting the family with actual sources, rather than unsourced family tree links needs to be done. Those interested in the family are welcome to use the resource files of the Franklin DNA Project to locate information to help actually source this family group. Please add sources/documentation for any edits/additions and links to parents/children.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Times-Picayune. 07 Oct 1846. p2.
