        "text": "Ed Dunn, beloved husband, father, and grandfather passed away Saturday morning, February 19, at Big Sky Nursing home. After a long and trying struggle with declining health, he has finally found his way home with the Lord and can find the peace he deserves.\n\nEd was born on July 29, 1930 to Joseph and Lezetta Emiline Dunn at their home at 1623 Walnut. He has three brothers – Jack, Howard, and Gary. He attended Bryant School and was proud of his heritage growing up in the infamous Sixth Ward. He graduated from Helena High School in 1948 and was the senior class president. During his last two years of High School, he spent the summers working for the Forest Service at Rainy Creek, West of Haugen, MT.\n\nUpon graduation, he worked for the Northern Pacific Railroad, where he had begun working during his senior year of high school. On August 2, 1948, he took a leave of absence from the railroad to join the U.S. Navy, where he served proudly on the U.S.S. Biaroka until his discharge on August 4, 1952. After his discharge, he returned to Helena and resumed employment with the railroad and enrolled briefly at Carroll College. He then worked several years at the Helena Post Office until he retired with a disability in 1976. He later worked for the State of Montana until his retirement in 1992.\n\nEd married Ann Riis on May 21, 1955, and they raised two children – Kevin and Karen. As his children were growing, he and Ann blessed them with lives rich with memories of camping, sports, and time spent with family. He was an avid sports fan and faithfully followed his children – and later his grandchildren – in their athletic endeavors. If you were in the gym (or county), you couldn’t help but hear his views from the sideline on team performance, coaching, and officiating during each game as he followed Karen’s basketball career at Helena High.\n\nThat same passion extended to his love for all sports. Ed was an avid supporter of the Carroll College Fighting Saints throughout his life and followed their football program and basketball programs through thick and thin. Although mildly disappointed in his Grandson Corey’s decision to engage as a foe of the Saints, he didn’t make much of an effort to hide his pride when Corey’s name was frequently called out for tackles when Eastern Oregon University came to town… and he proudly wore the EOU jersey while enjoying the games from the comfort of the private box at Carroll’s stadium.\n\nPatience was the one virtue that consistently seemed to evade Ed, but his love for his family and their friends was genuine. Ed and Ann have always opened their hearts and homes to the friends of Kevin and Karen, and more importantly to their children, spouses, and grandchildren. Once a part of Kevin or Karen’s life, all children qualified for unquestioned “grandchild” status. The special pride Ed had for his children was shared without hesitation with all of his grandchildren… probably even more intensely.\n\nChildren always came first. Nothing brought Ed more joy than the smiles, laughs, and energy of his grandchildren. This love for children was obvious to all… and there was plenty of love to extend to numerous nieces and nephews as well. The importance of family and “family values” was the greatest lesson he ever shared with his children.\n\nEd is survived by his wife of nearly 56 years – Ann. He is also survived by his two children – Kevin Dunn (Jeannie) and Karen Smith (Levi); eight grandchildren: Cassidy Smith and Braden Winterburn-Smith; Rylee and Corey Dunn; Ian, Torrey, and Jantzen Case, and Sunne Case-Lucas (Jeremy); and three great-grandchildren. He will also be missed by numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins. He was preceded in death by both parents.\n\nViewing hours will be from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Thursday, Feb 24 at Anderson Stevenson Wilke Funeral Home. A Vigil service will be held at 4:00 p.m. Thursday at St. Mary Catholic Community. Funeral Liturgy will be 10:00 a.m. Friday, Feb 25 at St. Mary Catholic Community. Burial with military honors will follow at the Montana State Veterans Cemetery at Ft. Harrison. A gathering of friends and family will be held in the lower level of the church immediately following the burial. Condolences may be sent to the family by visiting: www.aswfuneralhome.com."
