        "text": "I’m not quite sure why I decided to research this but I wanted to track all of the coaches that have worked with James Franklin at Vanderbilt and Penn State over the years.\n\nAnd here are the fruits of that labor that I figured you’d probably want to see too. Below is Franklin’s coaching tree.\n\nNow, calling this a coaching tree isn’t technically accurate. It’s more of a coaching proximity map with Franklin being the root of all of this, but “coaching tree” sounds better and is easier to understand.\n\nA few ground rules as it relates to how this tree was researched.\n\nFirst, Franklin had to be your boss so this tree effectively started when he was hired at Vanderbilt on Dec. 17, 2010. Now, there are a few exceptions to the rule – mainly if you played for Franklin. If you played for him, you’re on the list. There is at least one player I found that predates the Franklin-Vanderbilt era, though, so more on him way later. There are also people on here who aren’t necessarily coaches but I felt were important to include like Penn State’s Chief of Staff Kevin Threlkel. I also based all of the tables below on the first position these coaches were hired for. For the sake of brevity, I didn’t include promotion-type titles (assistant head coach, co-defensive coordinator, etc.) Most of the time, there was a position role attached so I went with that.\n\nNext, by my count, there are six former-hires-turned-head-coaches. We’re counting Manny Diaz, barely, since he was a head coach prior to becoming Penn State’s defensive coordinator. But he has both hired some of Franklin’s staff and also had to have success at Penn State to get that role. Additionally, each of those head coaches have a respective staff but only coaches who worked or played with Franklin appear on the list. For example, Brent Pry is the head coach at Virginia Tech. Hokies offensive coordinator Tyler Bowen makes the list because he was a GA at Penn State while special teams Stu Holt doesn’t because he never worked for Franklin.\n\nLastly, I’m certain I missed someone. Probably a few someones. I know for a fact I don’t have every analyst on this list. Penn State doesn’t list them on their coaching roster but does list some of their staff directory. I tried to only list those who served in a GA, position or coordinator role. I’m sure I missed a few players as well, particularly from the Vandy era. If you feel that I missed someone, I made a form. I will try to make this a living breathing document with occasional updates here or there and likely one big offseason update.\n\nFeel free to skip around. Below each section I’ve added interesting notes about important members of Franklin’s coaching staffs over the years.\n\nEach section is grouped by their initial hire:\n\nFranklin’s Career\n\nCoordinators\n\nPosition Coaches\n\nGraduate Assistants\n\nPlayers\n\nVarious\n\nHired By Assistants\n\nFranklin’s Career\n\nYearRoleTeam/School 1991-1994QuarterbackEast Stroudsburg1995Wide Receiver CoachKutztown1996Defensive Backs CoachEast Stroudsburg1996Offensive CoordinatorRosklide Kings1997Wide Receiver CoachJames Madison1998Tight Ends CoachWashington State1999Wide Receiver CoachIdaho State2000-2004Wide Receiver CoachMaryland2005Wide Receiver CoachGreen Bay Parkers2006-2007Offensive CoordinatorKansas State2008-2010Offensive CoordinatorMaryland2011-2013Head CoachVanderbilt2014-PresentHead CoachPenn State\n\nWe can’t list out Franklin’s career coaching tree without first talking about the road he’s taken to get to Happy Valley.\n\nFranklin’s coaching career started after his playing career ended at East Stroudsburg, where he majored in psychology. From there, he spent time in Pennsylvania at Kutztown and East Stroudsburg before heading to Denmark.\n\nThat’s right. The country known for Lego and The Little Mermaid.\n\nIn 1996, Franklin was the offensive coordinator of the Rosklide Kings. There, he helped the Kings to the Mermaid Bowl VIII Championship as they beat Copenhagen Towers, 62-48. It appears that the Kings are no longer in existence while the Towers remain one of the top teams in the Dansk Amerikansk Fodbold Forbund.\n\nAfter his tour of Denmark, he returned to be the wide receiver coach at James Madison, bouncing around at jobs with Washington State and Idaho State before taking a wide receiver coaching job at Maryland, where he worked briefly with former Penn State head coach Bill O’Brien. Franklin hasn’t spoken a ton about his relationship with O’Brien, but former Penn State quarterback – coach by both O’Brien and Franklin – Christian Hackenberg recently brought this up on his In the Pocket podcast.\n\nFranklin’s only trip to the NFL came in 2005 where he was the wide receiver coach for the Green Bay Packers. He left that role for the offensive coordinator job at Kansas State, then returned to Maryland for the OC job under Ralph Friedgen in 2008. If there was a head coach who I would consider the seed tree for Franklin, it’d be under Friedgen’s.\n\nFriedgen is an important part to Franklin’s story and one that is explored quite well in this article from the Washington Post. To make a long story relatively short, when Franklin was rehired at Maryland, athletic director Debbie Yow offered Franklin the head coaching job when Friedgen retired. But Yow left for NC State, Kevin Anderson fired Friedgen despite being named ACC coach of the year in 2010, which caused Friedgen to burn his diploma from Maryland, and Anderson to rebuke the offer for Franklin to take over Maryland’s program.\n\nThat is how Franklin ended up at Vanderbilt, taking their head coaching job where he went 24-15. And as you probably know, after O’Brien returned to the NFL with the Houston Texas, Penn State hired Franklin on Jan. 11, 2014.\n\nFranklin currently makes $7 million a year with a contract that runs through 2031. There are a few other perks in there as well, which you can view here.\n\nCoordinators\n\nNameFirst YearHired RoleCurrent Role Bob Shoop2011Vanderbilt Defensive CoordinatorMarshall Safeties CoachCharles Bankins2011Vanderbilt Special Teams CoordinatorNC A&T Special Teams CoordinatorJohn Donovan2011Vanderbilt Offensive CoordinatorUniversity of Florida AnalystJoe Moorhead2016Penn State Offensive CoordinatorAkron Head CoachPhil Galiano2018Penn State Special Teams CoordinatorNew Orleans Saints Assistant Special Teams CoachJoe Loring2019Penn State Special Teams CoordinatorOregon Special Team CoordinatorKirk Ciarroca2020Penn State Offensive CoordinatorRutgers Offensive CoordinatorMike Yurcich2021Penn State Offensive CoordinatorUnclearManny Diaz2022Penn State Defensive CoordinatorDuke Head CoachStacy Collins2022Penn State Special Teams CoordinatorBoise State Special Teams CoordinatorAndy Kotelnicki2024Penn State Offensive CoordinatorPenn State Offensive CoordinatorTom Allen2024Penn State Defensive CoordinatorPenn State Defensive CoordinatorJustin Lustig2024Penn State Special Teams CoordinatorPenn State Special Teams Coordinator\n\nBob Shoop\n\nBob Shoop is an interesting name here because he has his name all over the coaching staffs of those who Franklin has hired. Franklin hired him in 2011 as Vanderbilt’s OC where he then followed Franklin to Penn State. Shoop then shows back up on the Franklin radar so to speak as Joe Moorhead’s defensive coordinator at Mississippi State from 2018-19, and once again resurfaces entering the 2024 season as Marshall’s safety coach under Charles Huff.\n\nJoe Moorhead\n\nJoMo is technically the first Franklin-hired-turned-head-coach when he took over the job at Mississippi State in 2018. He was the head coach at Fordham prior to joining Penn State but his staff in Starkville had Penn State fingerprints all over it with several names including Shoop and Huff. Plus, former players Nyeem Wartman-White and Billy Fessler among others.\n\nMoorhead’s real impact on Franklin’s coaching tree is that he was the central piece in helping Franklin’s tree grow after 2016. Without Moorhead – or at least his offense leading Penn State to a 2016 Big Ten Title – Franklin may have been out after that 2016 season. And sure, having Saquon Barkley didn’t hurt but Moorhead’s two offenses still remain the best to play under Franklin.\n\nMike Yurcich\n\nMike Yurcich holds the distinguished title of being the only coordinator fired mid-season. You can read my general thoughts on that firing here but not necessarily the best title to have.\n\nManny Diaz\n\nAgain, as discussed earlier, he’s on here because he found success at Penn State that led him to get his second head coaching job – this time at Duke. He also has several on his staff with connections to Penn State, including Gabe Infante and V’Angelo Bentley.\n\nAndy Kotelnicki\n\nIn some ways, he’s responsible for this whole project. I wanted to take an expanded view on this column and that’s why you’re here.\n\nReturn to top\n\nPosition Coaches\n\nNameFirst YearHired RoleCurrent Role Brent Pry2011Vanderbilt Linebackers CoachVirginia Tech Head CoachChris Beatty2011Vanderbilt Wide Receiver CoachChicago Bears Wide Receiver CoachHerb Hand2011Vanderbilt Offensive Line CoachUCF Offensive Line CoachRicky Rahne2011Vanderbilt Quarterbacks CoachOld Dominion Head CoachSean Spencer2011Vanderbilt Defensive Line CoachTexas A&M Defensive Line CoachWesley McGriff2011Vanderbilt Cornerbacks CoachAuburn Cornerbacks CoachGeorge Barlow2012Vanderbilt Defensive Backs CoachUniversity of Louisiana at Layfette Cornerbacks CoachJosh Gattis2012Vanderbilt Wide Receiver CoachMaryland Offensive CoordinatorTerry Smith2014Penn State Cornerbacks CoachPenn State Cornerbacks CoachMatt Limegrover2015Penn State Offensive Line CoachKent State Offensive Line CoachTim Banks2016Penn State Safeties CoachTennessee Defensive CoordinatorDavid Corley2018Penn State Wide Receiver CoachPittsburgh Steelers Assistant QB CoachJa'Juan Seider2018Penn State Running Backs CoachPenn State Running Backs CoachGerad Parker2019Penn State Wide Receiver CoachTroy Head CoachJohn Scott Jr.2020Penn State Defensive Line CoachUnclear*Phil Trautwein2020Penn State Offensive Line CoachPenn State Offensive Line CoachTaylor Stubblefield2020Penn State Wide Receiver CoachAir Force Wide Receiver CoachAnthony Poindexter2021Penn State Safeties CoachPenn State Safeties CoachTy Howle2021Penn State Tight Ends CoachPenn State Tight Ends CoachMarques Hagans2023Penn State Wide Receiver CoachPenn State Wide Receiver Coach\n\n*Fired from Detroit Lions after 2023 season\n\nFranklin’s Initial Coaching Staff\n\nIt’s important to talk about Franklin’s initial coaching staff because it’s largely reflected above. Of his initial staff, Brent Pry, Herb Hand, Ricky Rahne, Sean Spencer, Bob Shoop and John Donovan followed him to Penn State. Additionally, key off-the-field staff Andy Frank, Chuck Losey, Dwight Galt III, Dwight Galt IV, Kevin Threlkel and Michael Hazel joined Franklin in Happy Valley. None of the coaches remain a part of Franklin’s staff but several of those off-the-field staff members are still around.\n\nBrent Pry\n\nMy fellow Altoid, Brent Pry lasted the longest of the coaches out of that bunch and I think has a big influence on why Franklin hired Manny Diaz and Tom Allen. Pry was very much Franklin’s right-hand man, at least on the field, and one of the biggest contributors to Franklin’s success. Pry and Franklin’s relationship goes back to Franklin’s playing days in East Stroudsburg, where Pry’s father Jim was the Warriors offensive coordinator. Brent was the team’s linebacker coach. The younger Pry rejoined Franklin at Vanderbilt in 2011, followed him to Penn State, became defensive coordinator in 2016 and then took the Virginia Tech head coaching job in 2022.\n\nPry’s coaching staff is also littered with former Nittany Lion coaches and players.\n\nHerb Hand\n\nI believe he is the only coach to appear on Chopped that’s worked for Franklin.\n\nRicky Rahne\n\nAnother eventual head coach, Ricky Rahne, is a bit interesting to me. He was Penn State’s quarterback coach from 2014-15 before being moved to tight end coach during the Joe Moorhead OC era. He was then the offensive coordinator after Moorhead. Was his success that lead him to the head coaching job at Old Dominion based on what Moorhead built? I don’t know but it certainly didn’t hurt they both had Saquon Barkley as their running back.\n\nRahne’s initial connection to Franklin is from Franklin’s days at Kansas State where Franklin was OC and Rahne was a GA. Rahne’s unique tree crosses pass with Bill Snyder and Jim Knowles as well.\n\nJosh Gattis\n\nGattis followed Franklin from Vandy to Happy Valley where he was the wide receiver coach, maybe Franklin’s best, until 2017. However, seeking greener pastures, he joined Mike Locksley, also a descendant of the Ralph Friedgen coaching tree like Franklin, at Alabama in 2018, went to Michigan in 2019, Miami in 2022 and is back in Maryland as their OC under Locksley.\n\nTerry Smith\n\nTerry Smith was Franklin’s first Penn State-produced hire. Smith played wide receiver in Happy Valley from 1987 to 1991 before playing professionally in the NFL, CFL (including the Shreveport Pirates) and AF2 (the minor leagues to the Arena Football League). Since 2014, he’s been Penn State’s connection into Western PA, where he was once a head coach at Gateway High School. He’s also Justin King’s step-dad, which I learned while researching all of this.\n\nAnyways, Smith is the longest current tenured coach working for Franklin and probably doesn’t get enough credit for how valuable he is. Penn State’s secondary is now arguably its best asset on defense and Smith is arguably Franklin’s best recruiting asset in the western half of the state.\n\nJa’Juan Seider\n\nTalk about valuable. He has developed Penn State’s running back room into one of the best in the country. Seider also served as interim offensive coordinator with Ty Howle after Mike Yurcich was fired. He’s always one to keep an eye on for head coaching jobs despite saying he wants to stay at Penn State for a long time.\n\nGerad Parker\n\nWhile one of Franklin’s wide receiver coaches, in a relatively revolving position since Gattis left, Parker is now the head coach at Troy. He is probably the least substantially impacted branch for the Franklin-hired-to-head-coach tree by Franklin but still worthy of noting.\n\nMarques Hagans\n\nThe latest Defense Against the Dar… sorry, I mean wide receiver coach at Penn State.\n\nReturn to top\n\nGraduate Assistants\n\nNameFirst YearHired Role Derham Cato2011University of Washington Tight Ends CoachJoey Orck2011Analyst at UVAChandler Henley2012Miami Dolphins Assistant Quarterback CoachLamar Morgan2012Michigan Defensive Backs CoachRyan Anderson2013Unclear*Bobby Snopek2014LawyerSteve Williams2014Harvard Special Team CoordinatorTyler Bowen2014Virginia Tech Offensive CoordinatorWill Windham2014South Alabama Defensive CoordinatorAndrew Jackson2015WVU Defensive Line CoachJoe Brady2015Buffalo Bills Offensive CoordinatorRyan Smith2015Arizona Cardinals Cornerbacks CoachTommy Galt2015Works in SalesMark Dupuis2017Penn State Offensive AnalystSean Cascarano2017Unclear**Kevin Smith2017Old Dominion Special Teams CoordinatorMatt Fleischacker2017Orange Theory Fitness CoachV'Angelo Bentley2019Duke Cornerback CoachKevin Reihner2019Troy Tight Ends CoachJeff Carpenter2020Los Angeles Chargers Wide Receiver CoachDavid Parker2021Penn State AnalystBryce Jones2022Northern Iowa Cornerbacks CoachDwayne Scott2022GA at SyracuseKevin Ceh2023GA at Penn StateJordan Lucas2024GA at Penn State\n\n*Last with New York Giants\n\n**Last at Cornell\n\nBobby Snopek\n\nBobby Snopek is one of a few who no longer appear to be in football and is now interestingly a lawyer. You can check out his lawyer page here.\n\nTyler Bowen\n\nTyler Bowen is all over the Franklin coaching tree. He first shows up as a student assistant in Maryland back in 2010. Then he joined Penn State’s staff as a GA in 2014. That’s how he gets on this list before spending time with Joe Moorhead at Fordham. He later came back to Penn State as the tight ends coach before going to the Jacksonville Jaguars under former-rumored Boalsburg house-owner Urban Meyer in 2021. From there, he joined Brent Pry at Virginia Tech in 2022 and has been the offensive coordinator ever since.\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nThe first of two coaches to share names with famous early American politicians.\n\nJoe Brady\n\nEveryone’s favorite “Penn State should hire him for OC” is now the offensive coordinator with the Buffalo Bills after helping LSU win a national title in 2019.\n\nMark Dupuis\n\nMark Dupuis has bounced around Franklin’s tree, first appearing as a GA then joining Ricky Rahne at Old Dominion. He’s returned to Penn State as an offensive analyst.\n\nKevin Smith\n\nHe’s currently Old Dominion’s special team’s coordinator under Rahne.\n\nV’Angelo Bentley\n\nHe works as Duke’s cornerback coach under Manny Diaz.\n\nKevin Reihner\n\nHe currently works for Gerad Parker as Troy’s tight end coach. He appears to be the only common connection on that staff — beside Parker of course — to Franklin.\n\nJordan Lucas\n\nHe gave us arguably the greatest quote in American football history.\n\nReturn to top\n\nPlayers\n\nNameFirst YearHired RoleFirst SchoolCurrent Role Danny O'Brien20092021at Penn StatePenn State Quarterbacks CoachChris Marve20102019at Mississippi StateVirginia Tech Defensive CoordinatorBilly Fessler20142020at Mississippi StateOhio State AnalystDeion Barnes20142020at Penn StatePenn State Defensive Line CoachMatt Zanellato20142016at Davenport UniversityUMass Wide Receiver CoachNyeem Wartman-White20142019at Mississippi StateAkron Defensive Line CoachTorrence Brown20142024at Penn StateGA at Penn StateWendy Laurent20142021at Penn StateDartmouth Tight Ends CoachJan Johnson Jr.20162023at Virginia TechVirginia Tech AnalystMichael Shuster20162021at Old DominionAkron Quarterback Coach\n\nFirst Year Player refers to the person’s first year playing under Franklin while first year coaching reflects the first time he worked for either Franklin or a former Franklin hire turned head coach.\n\nDanny O’Brien\n\nRemember way back in the intro (or if you don’t you can go back to the top and read it) when I mentioned a player that predates the Franklin Vandy Era. This is him. Of course, he was famously almost a Penn State player too but O’Brien played for Maryland while Franklin was there in his second stint. From there, O’Brien has worked his way through college and Canadian football playing days, then an analyst role at Penn State in 2021. He was a GA in 2023 and will be the quarterback coach in 2024. O’Brien is the fastest star currently growing in the tree and will play a big role in the success of Drew Allar in 2024. I highly recommend Ben Jones’ feature on O’Brien.\n\nDeion Barnes\n\nDeion Barnes is always my answer for “which football player did you have a class with?” Barnes is also the first Franklin-coached player at Penn State to be a coach under Franklin.\n\nMatt Zanellato\n\nHe is one of a few Penn Staters to play under Joe Paterno, Bill O’Brien and James Franklin. He’s also the only player on this list that played for Franklin that has never worked under Franklin or any of his assistants. Zanellato is currently the wide receiver coach at UMass. I believe he’s also the first former Franklin Penn State player to coach against Franklin.\n\nMichael Shuster\n\nThe former quarterback has spent time with several of Franklin-hired-head coaches and will now take on the quarterback coaching role at Akron under Joe Moorhead. At Akron, he’s also joined by former Penn State linebacker Nyeem Wartman-White, who is the Zips defensive line coach.\n\nBilly Fessler\n\nAlso a former quarterback under Franklin, Fessler was initially hired as UCLA’s quarterback coach most recently but has moved into an analyst role — without much mention or notice — after the hiring of Eric Bieniemy. The Bruins will of course come to Beaver Stadium in early October.\n\nChris Marve\n\nChris Marve didn’t play at Penn State but he’s on this list because he was a player at Vanderbilt under Franklin. He worked with Joe Moorhead in Mississippi State and is working under Brent Pry as Virginia Tech’s defensive coordinator.\n\nReturn to top\n\nVarious\n\nNameFirst YearHired RoleCurrent Role Andy Frank2011Off-Field SupportPenn State's General Manager of Personnel and RecruitmentBarry Brown2011Strength CoachUnclearCharles Huff2011Quality Control CoachMarshall Head CoachChuck Losey2011Strength CoachPenn State's Assistant AD for Athletic PerformanceDwight Galt III2011Strength CoachRetiredKevin Threlkel2011Off-Field SupportPenn State's Chief of StaffMichael Hazel2011Off-Field SupportVirginia Tech's Chief of StaffRobert Livingston2011Quality Control CoachColorado Defensive CoordinatorCharles Walker2012Quality Control CoachAnalyst at Penn StateSam Williams2012Quality Control CoachUnclearBarry Gant2013Strength CoachAlcorn State's Director of Sports PerformanceDwight Galt IV2014Strength CoachVirginia Tech Strength CoachKirk Campbell2017AnalystMichigan Offensive CoordinatorGabe Infante2022AnalystDuke Special Teams Coordinator\n\nCharles Huff\n\nHuff started out under James Franklin as a quality control coach in 2011 at Vanderbilt and has worked his way up the coaching ladder to of course become the head coach at Marshall. Huff spent time at Penn State as a running back’s coach until he went to Alabama for a similar role. He’s essentially grown the most on this tree but also did some of it on his own. It’s likely he will also move to a Power 4 type role relatively soon.\n\nAndy Frank & Kevin Threlkel\n\nYou probably have seen both of them but just don’t realize it. Both Frank and Threlkel are major players behind-the-scenes at Penn State and have been with Franklin since he began coaching at Vanderbilt. Frank is essentially Penn State’s general manager while Threlkel is Penn State’s chief of staff. While they’re not traditional coaches, they’re massively important figures and now two of Franklin’s longest confidants.\n\nMichael Hazel\n\nSimilarly to Frank and Threlkel, Hazel makes this list because he was a major behind-the-scenes person on Franklin’s staff. Where he differs is that he followed Brent Pry to Blacksburg where Hazel is still a major factor behind-the-scenes.\n\nThe Galts\n\nDwight the third and Dwight the fourth, plus Tommy have all spent time in various roles, particularly on the strength and conditioning side. Dwight the third retired, while Dwight the fourth has worked for Pry at Virginia Tech and Ricky Rahne at Old Dominion. The Galt III is also a big reason in helping current Penn State strength coach Chuck Losey grow his career. No word on what makes Losey’s mustache grow though.\n\nGabe Infante\n\nHe started out as an analyst under Franklin after spending time at St. Joseph’s Prep in the Philadelphia area and then working in Temple’s recruiting department. He is now at Duke under Manny Diaz as the special teams coordinator.\n\nKirk Campbell\n\nCampbell was hired by Franklin in 2017 as an offensive analyst but later left to join Jim Harbaugh’s staff in Michigan. He worked his way there from analyst to quarterbacks coach and will now act as the offensive coordinator under Sherrone Moore in Ann Arbor, starting in 2024.\n\nRobert Livingston\n\nLivingston and Franklin first crossed paths when the former was a Vanderbilt quality control coach. He left for the NFL, working his way through the ranks in Cincinnati where he ultimately became a secondary coach. Ahead of the 2024 season though, he will join Deion Sanders as Colorado’s defensive coordinator. He’s also the second person on this list to share a name with an early American politician.\n\nReturn to top\n\nHired By Assistants\n\nAll names below are reflected in the charts above.\n\nManny Diaz\n\nGabe Infante\n\nV’Angelo Bentley\n\nCharles Huff\n\nBob Shoop\n\nTorrence Brown\n\nJoe Moorhead – Mississippi State\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nBilly Fessler\n\nBob Shoop\n\nCharles Huff\n\nNyeem Wartman-White\n\nJoe Moorhead – Akron\n\nBilly Fessler\n\nMichael Shuster\n\nNyeem Wartman-White\n\nGerad Parker\n\nKevin Reihner\n\nBrent Pry\n\nChris Marve\n\nDwight Galt IV\n\nJan Johnson Jr.\n\nJeff Carpenter\n\nMichael Hazel\n\nTyler Bowen\n\nRicky Rahne\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nDwight Galt IV\n\nKevin Smith\n\nKirk Campbell\n\nMark Dupuis\n\nMichael Shuster\n\nReturn to top\n\nSourcing for this information comes from staff directories, media guides as well as Linkedin.
