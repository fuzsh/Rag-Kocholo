        "text": "Jaman James Smith of Modesto, California passed away Wednesday, December 22, 2021. After admirably persevering with significant health challenges for many years, Jaman died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 72.\n\nJaman was born on November 15, 1949, to father James W. Smith and mother Yvonne Smith. Jaman and his younger brother Bradford enjoyed a rich childhood on their North Modesto family farm with four generations of neighboring family and many adventures in the outdoors. That family included the James W. & Helen Smith clan, as well as the Manuel & Mary Azevedo clan. Among his many talents, Jaman was a natural when it came to growing things and was roundly celebrated for his green-thumb in ornamental horticulture as a member of the FFA while a student at Downey High School. He continued on with this passion at Modesto Junior College.\n\nAs a handsome and charismatic young man, Jaman’s cheerful confidence caught the eye of the woman who would become the love of his life. Jaman and Patricia Cummings were wed on June 22, 1973 and started a family of their own soon after. To support that family, Jaman worked for his father’s new small business in RV service. As Coach Repair grew, so too did Jaman’s family. With the aid of his beloved wife and under the supportive guidance of his father, Jaman would eventually come to take up ownership of Coach Repair and make it his own.\n\nJaman spent the better part of the next 40 years as a great man of many parts. He was a pillar of the community as an honest business owner and the savior of many a wayward traveler with his skilled repair service and vast RV knowledge. He provided RV problem solutions advice for thousands of customers over the years. He maintained a passion for gardening, and for everything mining and geological. He was a helpful hand and happy word to his many friends, neighbors, and acquaintances. He was a cheerful and cherished member of his large extended family. He was patient and nurturing father to his children. Jaman was a loyal and loving partner to the wife that he treasured till his final day, Patricia Ann Smith.\n\nJaman’s cremated remains will, in part, lie among the hills and mountains of California’s Mother Lode territory, a place he adventured through his whole life long. The best of him, however, will be committed to the sea, just north of Pigeon Point Light Station State Historic Park, so he may rest with his beloved Patricia forever more.\n\nJaman’s long and meritorious life will be survived by: his brother Bradford Smith (wife Agnes); his children Cameron (wife Kimberly); Evan (wife Lane); and Kara Smith; his grandchildren Caden, Rylie, and Lily Smith. He will be remembered by all the family and friends that fondly knew him as “Jay”.\n\nIf you would like to make a donation in Jaman’s memory, you may contact: The American Cancer Society, The American Kidney Fund, or The American Diabetes Association."
