        "text": "Photo Album\n\nFranklin Family History from Jill Franklin Hicks and Opal Franklin Manis\n\nMavis Opal Franklin was born and raised in Fentress County, Tennessee. Jill was born and raised in Muncie, Indiana. All of her ancestors were born and lived most of their lives in Fentress and Overton County, Tennessee before moving to Indiana. We are both descendents of Isaac Franklin b. 1787 in North Carolina. Opal descends from Isaac’s son Nathan. Jill descends from Isaac’s son James M. Franklin.\n\nOur related Family Lines are: Smith, Means, Stephens, Beaty, Winningham, Sells, Cravens, Davis, Cooper, Linder and Bowden.\n\nOur family history begins in North Carolina. Isaac Franklin was born in 1787. This is where it gets a little interesting, we have been told over and over by descendants of Isaac that his father was a Cherokee Indian. As the story goes, Isaac’s father took a white woman, married her and took her maiden name. Isaac and his brother Jacob Franklin were said to of been born in an Indian Camp somewhere in North Carolina. Isaac and Jacob were the sons of Jacob and Caroline Franklin. They lived in Indian Territory in North Carolina, Jacob and Caroline had six children:\n\n1. Isaac b. 1787 Indian Territory, N. C.\n\n2. John b. Cherokee Co., NC\n\n3. Abraham b. 1786 Cherokee Co.N. C-d. 1867 Cherokee Co. NC.\n\n4. Tom b. 1798 NC\n\n5. Jacob b. 1792 NC-d.abt. 1851 Cherokee Co. NC, he married Margaret Swinney, d/o James & Rebecca Swinney\n\n6.

NC, she married Richard Sisson on Oct. 3,1814 in Rutherford Co., NC.\n\nIsaac headed for Tennessee in early 1800, as rumor has it with his brother’s wife, Nancy. Supposedly Jacob, his brother, was right behind them in hot pursuit. Whatever the ending was to that story has never been handed down, but Isaac ended up in Overton County Tennessee with wife Nancy Turner and Jacob ended up back in North Carolina in a town called Franklin. Jacob married Margaret Swinney in North Carolina and they raised their family in Cherokee Co. Isaac and his family lived in Overton, Fentress and Morgan County, Tennessee which is where they all died. According to an affidavit which was given on behalf of O. Early Franklin, son of Jacob and Margaret Swinney Franklin, O. Early Franklin’s Father, Jacob was a brother to Lucy Franklin. This affidavit was given by a Indian by the name of Chuuuklusa, or something like that, the writing was very hard to read.\n\nIsaac Franklin 1787-unknown\n\nIsaac Franklin was born in North Carolina in 1787.

Nathan began seeing other women and was arrested around 1869 for living with Roda Riddle York. Living together was not legal and Nathan was charged with Lewdness, taken to court and fined $25.00. These charges are recorded in the Fentress County Courthouse. In the latter part of the 1870’s Nathan was again in trouble, this time for selling liquor on Sunday and again for Lewdness. Andrew Jackson Franklin, his brother, signed a bond for $500.00 to get him out of jail and make sure he appeared in court.

The enemy has been destroyed and the Villa Verde Trail secured. A passage hs been forced through the Caraballo Mountains from the Central Plain to the entrance of the Cagaya Valley, thus hastening the completion of the Luzon Campaign.\n\nAfter one hundred and twenty days of fierce hand to hand combat over terrain more difficult than any yet encountered in this war, the “RED ARROW” again pierced the enemy’s line. You have crushed completely another of the enemy’s so-called impregnable defenses, brilliantly concluding the Division’s 5th campaign in the Pacific Theater.\n\nI desire to express to every officer and enlisted man in the Division, as well as those attached, my heartfelt appreciation of the courage and determination each has shown while playing his vitally important part in this long and arduous campaign. You have outfought and destroyed a cunning and determined enemy, an enemy occupying elaborately prepared defenses on ground of his own choosing. Your Victory was impressive and decisive and one of which you may well be proud.\n\nIt is with justifiable pride and complete confidence that I look forward to your continued success into the heart of Tokyo.\n\nW. H. Gill\n\nMajor General, U. S.
