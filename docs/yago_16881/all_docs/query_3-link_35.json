        "text": "It's easy for diehard college football fans to hold a grudge against couples that elect to have a fall wedding because there's a good chance the ceremony and reception will keep those in attendance away from the weekly craziness that always ensues.\n\nBut if you only care about one team, tying the knot during its bye week is the way to go. And that's exactly what these Penn State fans did Saturday while the Nittany Lions are between games.\n\nPenn State is between Big Ten games this weekend, coming off a 31-7 demolition of Northwestern last week and looking ahead to Michigan for Week 8. So obviously, this was the only Saturday these diehard Nittany Lions fans could get married.\n\nAnd coach James Franklin approves.\n\nPenn State is back in action next week and will host the Wolverines for a 7:30 p.m. ET start time on Oct. 21."
