In 1717, he was able to bring a printing press and typesets from England to Boston. His younger brother Benjamin was indentured as his apprentice and they set type for the Boston News Letter. [3][4]\n\nIn 1719, he was employed to print the Boston Gazette, the first issue released that December. He continued the employ for about another year, when a different publisher was chosen. [4]\n\nHe then embarked on his own newspaper and was the publisher of the New England Courant at Boston. His first issue was published on Aug. 7, 1721.[5][6]\n\nThe Hell-Fire literary group formed by Benjamin Franklin and William Douglass often met at the printing offices of the Courant, and members contributed writings to the publication, adding the practice of long editorials within it's contents.[5]\n\nIn 1723, James Franklin was arrested, and censured and for a month by a Speaker's warrant for the outspoken political nature to one of his articles, while James refused to divulge the author.[3][4]\n\nThe younger brother Benjamin, his apprentice, was made publisher as the court had restrained James from publishing the Courant, or any pamphlet or paper of a similar nature, unless approved by the Secretary of the province. This allowed publication, evading the court order on James.[6][5][7] However, for Benjamin to be publisher, the indenture agreement had to be canceled, and another one was written, but kept in secret.[3][4]\n\nJames expected Benjamin to act in the manner of obedience and service of any apprentice, while Benjamin sought indulgence and leniency and they often argued. Benjamin eventually publicly let out the 'secret' indenture resulting in their final quarrel and left for Phildadelphia.[3] James wife Ann took over the responsibility as assistant printer and shopkeeper at the Courant, becoming one of the first woman printer's in the New England colonies.[5][4]\n\nAs interest in the paper declined at Boston, James' brother John advised him that there was a good prospect for a printer and newspaper at the seaport of Newport, Rhode Island, so James moved his operation there in about 1727, being the first Rhode Island printer.[6][7]\n\nIn 1730, James was chosen by the Newport Assembly to publish a new edition of colonial laws.[3]\n\nOn September 27, 1732, he published the first edition of the Rhode Island Gazette, but the paper lasted just six months.[3][4]\n\nIn 1733, he published the schedule for the General Assembly.[3] He continued his printing business by publishing Almanacs and works for various authors, as well as printing on linens and fabrics, a trade he learned in England.\n\nJames died at the age of 38 in Newport on Feb. 4, 1734/5 and his widow Anne continued the printing business for another 13 years until her son James Jr. took over the operation. She took on a partner, Samuel Hall, said to be her son-in-law.[6][3]\n\nHe is buried in the Common Burial Ground at Newport. [8]\n\nHe married Anna Smith at Boston on Feb. 4, 1723. [9] Anna was born there on Oct. 2, 1696, daughter of Samuel and Anna Smith. [2]\n\nHis widow Ann died on April 19, 1763 and is buried with James. [10] She survived all her five children. [6]\n\nChildren\n\nAnne born about 1727; died on November 2, 1730 aged 2 years and 8 months. [11]\n\nJames Jr. born ___ (c 1730); died on April 21, 1762. [6]\n\nAbiah born ___; died before 1763.[6] (may have married George Buckmaster at Newport on July 17, 1743 and died on Oct. 15, 1754)\n\nElizabeth (sometimes called Sarah Ann) born ___ ; died before 1763. [6](possibly the wife of Samuel Hall)\n\nMary born ___ ; died before 1763. [6]\n\nSource notes\n\nBoston Births/Baptisms\n\n1696: James of Josiah and Abiah Franklin born Feb. 4.
