        "text": "James traveled overland to California in 1849, where he mined in the Shasta district. In 1851 he moved to Oregon, settling in Umpqua Valley. He returned east to fetch his wife. He was admitted to the bar in 1854, served in the Territorial Legislature, and also the State Senate.8\n\nA Good Teacher. -- The directors of the Canyonville district have secured the services of Hon. James F. Gazley Sr. to teach the sprint term of school. The people of that community are to be congratulated on having secured so able and efficient a teacher as Judge Gazley, and also the teachers of the county school should feel pleased with such a valuable acquisition to their ranks. Mr. Gazley was a teacher of no mean attainments twenty years ago, and his return to school room duties is a matter of surprise to his many friends. There is no doubt but that the Canyonville people will have a good term of school during the spring months--“Plain-dealer.”"
