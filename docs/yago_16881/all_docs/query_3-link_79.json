Grandma's father\n\nwas John Bigelow of the Northborough/Marlborough area, and he practiced architecture. Her mother was a Howe\n\n(my great great grandfather was Horace Bigelow, an entrepaneur and social liberal who owned a shoe factory in\n\nWorcester Ma. He instituted profit sharing in his company, built the White City amusement park in Worcester and later\n\ndonated it's electric generating plant to the city). Her first husband was a Murray (2 children, Anne and Margie) and her\n\nsecond was Paul Parmenter (2 kids, Dan- my father- and John, in CA now). She and grandpa Paul were distant cousins,\n\nthe Bigelows and Parmenters having known each other since at least the 1750's if not longer. My father Dan Parmenter\n\nmarried Kathleen Loughman (pron \"Lockman\"), the Loughmans being from MA (Cape Cod) and NY (the Bronx- my great\n\ngrandfather was a military man and moved a lot. He was high ranking officer in the Navy and a set a record for\n\nthe deepest sea dive in about 1913). I'm ashamed at the moment to say I can't remember much about the Bigelow line\n\nbeyond John Bigelow, although I do know family tales dating back to the French and Indian War.\n\nZeph\n\nNote:\n\nFrom: John Parmenter\n\nTo: zephreny parmenter < zephparm@hotmail.com >\n\nSubject: Janice Bigelow\n\nDate: Sat, 28 Dec 2002 14:22:48 -0800 (PST)\n\nI have ALL the family genealogy (up to date) on my computer. I have copied all the Bigelow files that Grandpa Bigelow and my Mom, Janice, had. I have done some research and am still recording stuff. As you can see, Horace Holly Bigelow was actually an Uncle of ours, as he was the brother of Arthur Julian Bigelow. James Franklin Bigelow, Arthur's son, was Grandpa Bigelow's father. I have lots, lots more information, including pictures, on all the branches and you are\n\nwelcome to it all!!\n\nFrom: Daniel E Parmenter\n\n15 Hudson St\n\nNorthboro, MA 01532\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am currently clearing up my mother's estate in Northboro, MA. Her father was John A Bigelow a lifelong resident of Marlboro, MA (aprox 1890-1970).\n\nBoth, my mother (Janice Bigelow Parmenter), and my grandfather were extremely active in areas of genealogy and history, esp. of the Bigelow family.\n\nI have come across, among other things, approximately 100 unused copies of a booklet printed for the 1872 Bigelow Family Reunion and, I think, compiled by Gilman Howe. I also have found a panoramic picture of the attendees of that gathering.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any interest in acquiring these items, either through purchase or donation. I would like for them to come into appreciative hands.\n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel E Parmenter\n\n15182.42D21 Margaret Helen Bigelow, b 12 Aug 1887; d 02 Jan 1957 Marlborough; m 21 Jun 1910 Henry Augustas Dudley ( b 02 Oct 1886; d 07 Jul 1939)\n\n15182.42D22 John Arthur Bigelow, b 28 Jan 1889 (1890?); d 08 Feb 1970 (aged 81); m Anne T.
