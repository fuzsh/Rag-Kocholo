For many people, the latter is more important.\n\nNewlyweds Kirsten Luzik and Joshua Keele are self-proclaimed \"true\" Penn State Nittany Lions fans. To prove their devotion, the couple was sure to schedule their wedding on Saturday, Oct. 14, on a weekend when Penn State wasn't playing.\n\nLuzik tweeted at coach James Franklin, and she received almost immediate approval.\n\n\"I don't understand people who don't plan it that way! Are you committed to PSU FB or not lol,\" Franklin wrote.\n\nThe Nittany Lions will return to the gridiron next week when they host the Michigan Wolverines at 7:30 p.m. ET on Oct. 21.\n\n--Meaghan Latella"
