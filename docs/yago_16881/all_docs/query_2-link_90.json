        "text": "Descendants of Nathan Smith of North Carolina\n\nGeneration #1\n\nNathan (0Research) Smith of North Carolina\n\nNathan Smith was born in about 1720 in North Carolina. In about 1745 in North Carolina, Nathan married Ann Smith b. c. 1725. By 1751 Nathan and Ann settled in Bladen Co NC and began raising their family. The first documentation for this family is from the 1767 Cumberland Co NC Tax List. And, the family is next found in the 1768 Cumberland Co NC patent for land on Richland Creek near what is now Putnam NC.\n\nIn 1784 Moore County split from Cumberland County. A Nathan Smith is found in the 1790 Moore Co NC Census. With him is one female of indeterminate age. Did Ann die before 1790, and is this daughter Mary living at home?\n\nNathan Smith, et. al., migrated in about 1791 from North Carolina to an area thought to be Franklin Co GA, establishing the Nathan Smith Settlement. This date is set by Jacob Hollingsworth's later arrival in 1793 when Jacob built Ft. Hollingsworth. And, there is circumstantial evidence which indicates Nathan was awarded bounty land in Georgia as a Patriot even though he had not served in Georgia.\n\nThe Cherokees complained that the Nathan Smith Settlement was on their land. Benjamin Hawkins, an Indian Agent, was sent to Georgia to determine who was right, the settlers or the Indians; and, he decided in favor of the Indians.\n\nNote, the Nathan Smith Settlement was located in the vicinity of Holllingsworth, Franklin (now Banks) Co GA near where Fort Hollingsworth still stands. Evidence for locating the Nathan Smith Settlement at Ft. Hollingsworth comes from Jacob Hollingsworth, Resident #63 on the list, who is cited as a New Settler to Nathan Smith's Settlement and a deed showing James Minyard, Resident #42 on the list, owning property on Mountain Creek. This property is located approximately 1/4 mile south of Hollingsworth GA.\n\nThe land dispute went on for many years, and the settlers became discouraged. On 9/13/1798, members of the Nathan Smith Settlement sent a petition to the Governor of Georgia, requesting some sort of relief. With the \"Four Mile Purchase\" of 1804, the boundary of the Cherokee Purchase was extended north and west, and these lands were added to then Franklin Co GA. Although the newly purchased lands included a majority of settlers in the previously disputed territory, many settlers of the Nathan Smith Settlement were either out of luck or had already moved on.\n\nAs some awaited final resolution, other members of the settlement sold their lands \"warranted against all but the Indian Claims,\" continuing their southern and western migration. Four of Nathan Smith's sons and many of their neighbors migrated by 1813 to what would become the Fair River, Bahala, Bogue Chitto, and McCall Creek settlements of Lawrence and Franklin Counties in Mississippi. Nathan and his wife are believed to have lived the remainder of the lives at the original settlement, and are buried somewhere in what is now Banks Co GA.\n\nBorn c. 1720 in North Carolina\n\nMarried c. 1745 in North Carolina to Ann Smith b. c. 1725\n\n11/10/1749 Craven Co NC Land Joining\n\nSettled by 1751 in Bladen (now Moore) Co NC\n\n1754 Cumberland split from Bladen Co\n\n1767 Cumberland Co NC Tax List: Nathan Smith\n\n12/22/1768 Cumberland Co Land Patent\n\n1771 Cumberland Co NC Land Transaction\n\n1772 Cumberland Co NC Land Transaction\n\n1774 Cumberland Co NC Land Transaction\n\n1784 Cumberland Co NC Grand Jury: Nathan Smith\n\n1784 Moore Co split from Cumberland Co\n\n1790 Moore Co NC Census\n\nMigrated c. 1791 to Franklin Co GA\n\n9/13/1798 Petition to the Governor of Georgia for adjustment of land boundaries: Nathan Smith\n\n12/20/1798 Franklin Co GA Land Transaction\n\n1800 Franklin Co GA Tax List: Nathan Smith 300 a.
