        "text": "This biography was submitted by Sandy Spradling, E-mail address: <SSpradling@aol.com>\n\nHistory of Greenbrier County\n\nJ. R. Cole\n\nLewisburg, WV 1917\n\np. 246-248\n\nJAMES FRANKLIN McCLUNG.\n\nJohn McClung, who emigrated from Scotland to Ireland about 1690, and from there to Virginia, finally, was the ancestor of James F. McClung. (See sketch of John McClung and family.)\n\nOf the seven sons of John, Samuel McClung (Devil Sam) before mentioned had a son, Stuart, born December 24, 1836, died September 12, 1901. He was the father of James F. McClung. On March 29, 1860, Stuart McClung married Mary George, born at Dawson (see sketch of George family). Their children were Joseph Albert, born March ,5, i86i Sarah Elizabeth, December 4, 1862; Margaret Rebecca, wife of W. B. Hayes (see sketch) James Franklin, June, 1867; Samuel, October 17, 1869; Callie Jane, January 30, 1872, married August 31, 1892, to John Cook; Mary M., May 12, 1874, married June 27, '900, to W. F. Mc-Dowell; Louise Alice, December 22, 1876, married Dexter Spangler; Spencer Hill, September 22, 1879; Lelia Ruth, February 8, 1882, married James H. Jarrett.\n\nJames Franklin McClung was reared a farmer. He and his brother, Samuel, own and operate a seven-hundred-and-fifty-acre tract of land, on one-half of which stands the old house. It is on the part belonging to James F. Here is the homestead of the Stuart McClung family and the place where the children roamed at will in childhood.\n\nAfter the subject of our sketch had received his education, the best his district school could give him, he became a traveling agent for the next twenty years of his life, first for Abney Barnes & Company, dry goods merchants of Charleston, W. Va., and finally for Hutcheson-Stephenson Hat Co., of the same city. He was with each firm for ten years, and probably no man in the State knows more about the people and country of the twenty-five counties through which he traveled during that time than does James F. McClung.\n\nWithout an accident or a day of sickness he went to and from the Jackson river back to Big Sandy, on the Kentucky border, and from the Little Kanawha to the Virginia mountains on the north, unarmed, but always welcomed, though his route took him everywhere among the feuds of the McCoys and Hatfields of the State."
