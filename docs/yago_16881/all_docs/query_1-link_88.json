Hilda BOYD,\n\nMary Philomena\n\nSMITH Geri Shank My grandmother was Hilda BOYD. Her parents were Charles \"Spot\" & Anna KNECHT. My grandmother's mother's maiden was SCHMIDT.

My great grandparents were married in Oct. 1903. I'm looking for any KNECHT, SCHMIDT or SHANK families. John BRADFORD,\n\nMary Ann\n\nBRADFORD,\n\nSarah Elizabeth\n\nHIGGS Carol Jenkins I have a John BRADFORD who married in Franklin County Indiana in 1817 to a Sarah BLADES. Sarah BLADES is the daughter of Isaac BLADES and Sarah Elizabeth HIGGS. I can not find out who John Bradford's parents were. John is my third great grandfather. He is relation to a family by the name of RUSSELL and also SMITH. He was born in Tennessee in 1798. I also can not find out who Sarah Elizabeth Higgs's parents were. There is a Mary Ann BRADFORD who married a RUSSELL in Grainger County Tennessee and came to Franklin County Indiana with one small son and expecting the second son. (He was born in Franklin County IN) She was married in 1800 to the RUSSELL. Does anyone know who her parents and siblings were or who she came with to Franklin County In as her husband had died in Tennessee. Thanks for any help. William CARPENTER, Susan/Susannah TONER Eileen Clark I have not been able to find death documentation or burials on William and Susannah/Susan (TONER) CARPENTER of Posey Twp, Franklin County. William was born in Lycoming County, PA about 1782. In 1850, he and Susan were living in Posey Twp. He died before 28 June 1856 because I have a copy of his Franklin County probate record. Susan is listed on the Posey Twp 1870 census but not on the 1880. Old Brick Cemetery is a logical burial, and while someone has added a few CARPENTER records to Find-a-Grave Old Brick, active Find-a-Grave volunteers have reported that those burials cannot be confirmed. Children of William & Susan: James, Deborah Ann, Isreal, Edward, Sarah, William Oliver and Oliver. To avoid duplication and not needed research: I have some detail & documentation on the children, and the Rush County Find-a-Grave CARPENTER records & headstone photographs (Samuel and his descendants, allied families) are my own. I've also done onsite research Franklin County library & courthouse. I'm specifically looking for William and Susan. William's brother Samuel is my 3rd great-grandfather. Thank you! Catherine CASE Barbara Kuykendall My brick wall is Catherine CASE. Born in Indiana, probably Franklin County, 7 January 1821. Died 10 March 1889 in Laurel. Married to Dr. Thomas GIFFORD of Laurel. Reifel says she is the daughter of Henry and Ann CASE of Metamora, but that is incorrect. Henry and Ann did have a daughter named Catherine, but in 1860 their daughter Catherine was 35, single and living at home, while my Catherine was married with children. A cousin of my dad's (long deceased) said she was a descendant of John and Priscilla ALDEN. I cannot prove that, since I don't even know who her parents were! She named her youngest son Samuel Alden, but we think Dr. GIFFORD's full name was Thomas Alden GIFFORD. The ALDEN connection may be through him, not through her. Can anyone help me find Catherine's parents? One possibility for her parents is Charles Rockefeller CASE and Catherine HEATH. In 1840 they had a daughter in the right age group, who could have been named for her mother. Can anyone help me find Catherine's parents? Matthew CAVANAGH Greg Boyd I am trying to find the roots of my Great Grand father Matthew CAVANAGH born in Oldenburg 1812 he had a son in Fayett Texas in 1869 my Grandfather. I have never been able to find anything else about Matthew other than he married a late in his life a woman named Malissa I would guess he had previously been married. Maybe he left the area because of the civil war. Can you tell me where I might find birth records for Oldenburg and or other information. I sincerely thank you for any help you might be able to give.

DAVIS,\n\nSarah Ann McFARLAND Dan Davis My brick wall is finding any information about my great great grandparents, John S. DAVIS and Sarah Ann McFARLAND. I know that they were married in Franklin County Indiana on Sept. 9th, 1852. In 1860 they lived in Ray Township and had 4 children, Joseph, Robert, Hannah and Martha. My great grandfather, John Henry was born in 1861. The family eventually moved to Woodford County Illinois.

One son he had was John Edward DAWSON who Married Emma FIELDS of Laurel. any Help I would be grateful for. Benjamin DOTY Ken Pohl Here's one I have been fighting for about 30 years. My wife's gr-gr-grandfather, Benjamin DOTY was born about 1798 in Minisink, Orange County, NY. He married Mary SCOFIELD in Big Flats, Tioga County, NY and they had several children there. They disappeared after the 1830 census. Mary appears as Mary DOTTY on the 1850 census in Metamora, Franklin County, IN with several children including Charles Wilson DOTY, my wife's gr-grandfather, who always claimed to have been born in Rochester, IN. Another mystery - where is Rochester, IN? With some help from others on this site we discovered that Rochester is now known as Cedar Grove, a small village just a few miles down Route 52 from Metamora. There is no sign of Benjamin DOTY on the 1840 or 1850 census of Franklin County. Did he head for the gold rush in California, was he killed during the canal construction, did he just take off from his family? There was canal construction in Big Flats before the family moved to Franklin County so there is a possibility he was a canal worker. A family rumor states that he fell in the canal on the way home from a lodge meeting. Help! Sarah GILBERT Patricia O'Connor (no email) My brick wall is Sarah GILBERT, b. btwn 1800 & 1810 in Indiana. On April 15, 1831, in Brookville, she married Henry COLESCOTT, son of Ralph COLESCOTT and Rhoda CAIN. Her children were William G., b. 1832; Mary M., 1832; Rhoda Ann, 1836 and James Henry, 1939. By the 1850 census, Henry is dead and Sarah apparently had remarried a PANNELL. Two of her children, William and Rhoda are living with foster parents in Shelby Co., IN. We can’t find Sarah, Mary or James on the 1850 census. We need her parents; on the 1817 tax list we find a Nathaniel GILBERT; the 1830 census shows a William and James GILBREATH in Franklin Co. and the 1840 census has a William GILBERT. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Armstrong HAWKINS,\n\nMary DAVIS Carol Tolley My brickwall is Armstrong HAWKINS and his wife Mary DAVIS. Armstrong was born 25 Jan 1818 in IN. Mary DAVIS was born 22 Sep 1819 in OH. They married 17 Mar 1836 in Franklin Co. This family appears in the 1840 fed census for Franklin Co, and 1850 Ray Twp, Franklin Co IN census. Also in 1850 with them is Rachel HAWKINS, age 59, b in TN. Possibly Armstrong's mother. Family history states that his parents were a John and Rachel HAWKINS. Both Armstrong's and Mary's birth yr are in question. Could be as early as 1812 or as late as 1819. The family removed to Jackson Co, IA in about 1854 and both died in 1869. Also in the 1850, Metamora, Franklin Co fed census are a John and Mary HAWKINS, who named a son, Armstrong. I have not been able to find anything further on them. I have found three main HAWKINS lines in this eastern area of IN. HAWKINS/HACKLEMAN; HAWKINS/ LYTLE/LITTLE and John and Nancy HAWKINS, but have not been able to count any of them completely out. I have not been able to connect Mary DAVIS with any DAVIS line. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Lodisa HUNTER\n\n(RAMSEY?) F. Kay Roberts Lodisa was born 1851 Unknown IN.

I would like to know his parents, siblings, when he came to US, where he lived before coming to Franklin Co., IN and why he came there. Perhaps he had a relative in the area. James F. OGLESBY Amy Tillman My brickwall is my great-grandfather, James F. OGLESBY. He was born 26 Dec 1847 in Scotland. I don't have anything on him until he shows up in the 1870 Census in Highland, Franklin, Indiana at the age of 23. He is enumerated in the household of Julia HANDY, and his occupation is Railroad Foreman. He married his first wife, Mary Ann WHITE on 23 Sep 1870 in Franklin county. Mary Ann was the daughter of Edward George and Martha Ann [McGLINN] WHITE who resided in Franklin county. James and Mary Ann had two sons -- Edward Francis (b. 31 May 1871) and John (b. 19 Aug 1873). In 1880 they were residing in Brookville Twp. Mary Ann died 07 Jul 1883. James married a second time to Sarah L. ALFORD on 23 Jan 1884. Sarah was the daughter of William Henry and Eviah [WILEY] ALFORD. She was much younger (b. 07 Oct. 1867). James and Sarah would have four children: Sarah L. (b. 05 Mar 1885), James Francis (b. 20 Feb 1887), Fannie Jezabelle (b. 17 Mar 1890) and Earl Roger (b. 19 Mar 1893). Shortly after Earl's birth, Sarah ran off and left James with the children. He was very ill, and unable to care for the children, so on 15 May 1894 he placed the four youngest in the Franklin County Children's Home. He died six months later on 14 Nov 1894 in Franklin county. I would very much like to find out where James is buried (perhaps even a death certificate?), and any other information about his arrival in Franklin county prior to 1870 -- or any information about his parents or any siblings that might have been with him.
