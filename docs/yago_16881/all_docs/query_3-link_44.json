        "text": "I think they have all been good at times. It's still obviously a small number of practices and number of plays to truly evaluate.\n\nI thought our entire staff, as well as team, felt like we took a big jump in Day 2 compared to Day 1. So I thought that was a real positive. But it's just kind of a small (sample size) right now to really base that off of. I'll have a better idea a week from now.\n\nBut so far, solid, and obviously there's still some steps that need to be taken there for that entire room. Obviously that's been a big question mark for the media and some of the fans.\n\nI think the coaching staff and I think the players have a good amount of confidence in what that room has the ability to do and the amount of work that they have put in with Beau (Pribula) and Drew (Allar) all summer.\n\n(Amin) Vanover is a guy that I don't think enough people are talking about. We have a ton of confidence in Amin. And I think the other guy — and I get why a lot of people aren't talking about him — is Smith Vilbert.\n\nSmith Vilbert is a guy that we have a lot of confidence in as an organization and as a program. He's missed, obviously, a lot of football, so you guys haven't had a chance to see him the way we have. But you talk about big, strong, physical experienced mature.\n\nSo that gives us really three defensive ends that have played a ton of football in my mind in terms of games and practice with Vanover, Dani and Vilbert. And then you've got Carter, who is new to the position, but still has played a ton of football.\n\nAnd then we've got Mason Robinson, who is going into Year 2 in the program that we are going to need to take a significant step for us. And then after that, there's a bunch of guys, whether it's (Joseph) Mupoyi, whether it's Mylachi (Williams), whether it's (Jordan) Mayer, whether it is (Max) Granville. There's other guys kind of in the mix there.\n\nBut I would say for us, you've got Vanover, Carter, Dani, Vilbert, Mupoyi and Robinson as probably the six guys that we know the most about right now, if that makes sense.\n\nYou see changes. A guy that right away to me, when we went out in the field on the first day was Ta'Mere (Robinson). Ta'Mere looked different. He really looked good. You noticed that right away.\n\nI think everybody kind of had noticed (Tony) Rojas already. The numbers that have been reported and just looking at him, he obviously looks different, as well.\n\nAnother guy that a lot of people aren't talking about but were excited about that is really kind of changed his body as well is (Eagan) Boyer. I want to say Boyer has put on 35, 40 pounds, and is really doing some nice things.\n\nBut I would say that's probably the biggest change in terms of physical appearance, and then in terms of mentally, obviously there's a big jump at the quarterback position. (Ethan Grunkemeyer) is really doing some nice things. We think he's got a very, very bright future and has really taken a step.\n\nI think Jaxon Smolik has been really impressive in terms of what he's been able to do mentally, maximizing what he's been able to do right now. That's been impressive, as well.\n\nBut I think it's just a combination. Some guys have a lot of room for growth mentally. Some guys have a lot of room for growth physically. But there's a few examples.\n\nHe's already flashed in the first two days. (He's) athletic, quick, a lot of things you saw on the high school tape but you don't know if those things are going to show up when they get here, but that's already happened. He also tested really well with our baseline testing with Coach (Chuck) Losey and that staff, as soon as he was cleared and able to do that.\n\nIn terms of the process, we really kind of had no idea until really very late in the process that this was even something they were thinking about. And then there's one thing to be thinking about; there's another thing to actually be able to do it.\n\nI think he was taking summer classes to be able to ensure the fact that he would be able to come (as a January enrollee) and once he got the classes done and realized he could qualify now and graduate now, then they brought the option up to us. And I think that also triggered to us that they are very serious about Penn State because they are having these types of conversations with us.\n\nBut it was pretty late in the process, so then it was a ton of work that had to happen for him in terms of the application process and all that; for us, in terms of getting all that documentation and then also getting him here. Like I think the same weekend his brother got married; so they had the wedding and were driving here.\n\nSo there's a lot of stuff that we had to get done in a short period of time and because of the wedding, it's not like he could even come a couple days early. Like he was getting here right at the last minute.\n\nSo far, first impression, really good. But obviously there's a big difference between running around in shorts and T-shirt than there is in full pads. So we'll see that today. We'll have a better idea today.\n\nExplosive plays to me goes hand-in-hand with getting your best players the ball. I felt like the last couple games of the year, you saw a significant change there.\n\nSo obviously with that, that kind of went through the interview process. A big part of the interview process was production of explosive plays and the data to back it up, not just saying in an interview, hey, I want to be explosive; the data to back it up.\n\nBut then also philosophically, how are you going to get your best players the ball? How are you going to get them touches? How are you going to get them touches early in the game? Those types of things are a big part of it.\n\nAgain, it's one thing to talk about those things in the process; it's another thing to go watch the the film and it's another thing to study the data and make sure those things are happening. Sometimes it's easier said than done depending what position the guy plays.\n\nBut so far, so good. Been a ton of discussions in the offseason about that, and then I think from him being able to watch us during bowl prep, and then winter workouts and then spring ball and all these types of things, I think he's got a pretty good idea of the guys we have, the weapons we have, the experience we have.\n\nAnd then I think the other thing we are going to have to do, back to development of some of these positions, is hopefully by Game 3, we feel like there's other guys that you guys are all talking about our best players and that we are talking about in terms of people that we have to get more touches to.\n\nI think you guys heard me say this before. We are really not in a position in Year 11 in the program to start all over. We have not done that.\n\nSo in terms of all three coordinators, they were hired based on what they had done well in their careers but also, what are you able to do and how comfortable are you, honestly comfortable, keeping the same, and what needs to change?\n\nI would say on offense, there's probably more change than on defense and special teams. But probably not as much as you guys would think.\n\nSo I think Andy (Kotelnicki) has done a really good job of that. That takes a ton of confidence. That takes a ton of intelligence. And I think it also takes enough experience that you feel like you're able to do that.\n\nAnd again, that's so that we don't have 50 players learning a completely new system. We have kind of a blend, a combination of one coordinator, and then the things that need to change.\n\nSo I think we are in a good spot there. I think some of the rule changes over the last couple years that allow you to have essentially OTAs in the off-season where you are actually able to coach, that's helped. Because I think in the old days when you hired a new coordinator and you could do no coaching in football when other sports could, those transitions, those changes, are more significant.\n\nIt's less significant now because you get spring ball. You get summer OTAs, and we have been able to get a ton done. I think we are in a pretty good spot, and most importantly, I think the players are confident with what we are doing and how we are doing it.\n\nTerry (Smith) is the model. Terry is the model in terms of recruiting and then in terms of development. You would say, typically, when you have a year where you essentially lost two corners to the NFL that you would feel like that was a big question mark going into the season, and feel like that was an area where maybe you had some concerns.\n\nBut we actually feel like that position from top to bottom could be better this year athletically. Now don't misinterpret what I'm saying. They still have to do it on game day, and obviously when you have lost the amount of production that we lost at that position, we understand that.\n\nBut I'd say seven guys that went through spring ball and went through summer and now are in training camp, we feel really good about those seven guys, and specifically, six guys, three deep on either side. Right now it's hard to really say.\n\nCam Miller has got the most experience here at Penn State. You guys know how we feel about AC, Audavion Collins, what he's been able to do all offseason. Been a ton of conversation. Maybe most improved guy on our roster since the end of the season.\n\n(Jalen) Kimber has come in and really developed and changed his body in our strength and conditioning program and has played a lot of football in a very good conference. You know (A.J.) Harris. There's just a lot of guys that we feel good about.\n\n(Zion) Tracy, who we've got a ton of confidence and (Elliot) Washington, who we have a ton of confidence in. All those guys have for the most part either played, whether it's played here or played at other places.\n\nSo Terry just does a really good job in terms of rebuilding and retooling that position. And I don't think it's a position that, as coaches, we have a ton of concerns about.\n\n(In terms of starters), I just don't know; I don't have enough practices to feel like it's \"these\" guys. I feel like we have a group of players that we feel really good about. Now somebody has got to separate themselves and be the guy; or, we are going to be rotating a lot of high-quality players that we feel good about.\n\nI would really say the whole group. Drew, Beau, Grunk, (Jaxon) Smolik. I've been as impressed with Smolik's growth and how he's handled his (injury) situation as anybody. I think the dialogue is really good. I typically sit in the quarterback meetings, and I think the dialogue and discussions are really good.\n\nI think Andy, with 19 years of experience as a play-caller, and really being able to float, which is really what he wanted to do coming here, to be able to float as an offensive coordinator, almost like a lot of the NFL organizations do; and then have someone like Danny (O'Brien), even before the rule changes as a GA, Andy was able to get comfortable with Danny. I think that helped, as well.\n\nBut the dialogue in that room has been really good. I think the players got a ton of respect for Danny as a former player that's walked in their shoes.\n\nAnd I think we have a system now that is going to put not only our best players in position to be successful but I think Andy's background as a former line coach, I think helps, too. Because typically on offense, everything you're doing is about how do you make things as challenging on the defense as possible, obviously. But also, how do you limit the complication of things for your O-line and for your quarterback. You want to try to keep things as simple for those two positions as you possibly can in two positions that are not very simplistic.\n\nAnd I think he's done a really good job of that. Sometimes I think coaches say that because that's Coaching 101 interview process and things like that. But the execution they have, I think Andy has done a really good job. Again, experience matters; 19 years as a play-caller that you learn not only things that have worked but things that you would do differently. That experience really counts.\n\nDrew obviously has been able to lean into Danny and has been able to lean into Andy, but I also think some of the things systematically that we are going to do -- and I would say even some of these things we are going to do, you guys are going to look at and say, I don't know if that's something I would imagine Drew doing but by him doing just enough of it opens up and creates opportunities for other things in our offense and makes us difficult to defend. I think it's really good. I think it's been really good.\n\nIt's interesting, when you watch just the Kansas film from the last two years, Beau was pretty excited. But when you look at over 19 years, Buffalo, different types of quarterbacks, and just the overall knowledge of offense, there's a reason for all those guys in that room to be excited.\n\nI would say the first thing is the length of the season. I think you guys know, we have always talked about trying to create depth, was always important playing in a conference like the Big Ten.\n\nSo that was philosophically something that we've always believed in but I think your point is a good one. It's magnified now. You have the potential of 17 games.\n\nSo how are you going to do that? I think that, coupled with some of the rule changes over the last couple years where you can play in four games, save your redshirt, but then you also get to be able to play in all of the postseason games and not burn your redshirt, I think that factors in to strategy in how we do these things.\n\nAnd then just making sure we are doing a really good job of rotating and playing guys for the fourth quarter, for late in the season, and now a playoff run, all those types of things.\n\nI guess to answer your question, it's not really dissimilar to what we have done in the past. I just think it's heightened if that makes sense.\n\nPurdue was a great example going on the road (for the 2022 opener). We've done a few of these things before; I think has been helpful for us, and I think it gets everybody's kind of attention.\n\nI have probably more respect for West Virginia than anybody just because I've played there so many times and I know what Mountaineer Football means to the state of West Virginia and I know what the environment is going to be like. Played there a ton of times.\n\nAnd in some ways, there's a geographic component to this, as well. There's some historical factors there, as well, in terms of being a bordering state or whatever -- however you want to describe it.\n\nSo I think it's going to be a great game. I think it's going to be a great environment and then on top of that, the way they ended their (2023) season. I think they ended up winning nine games and the quarterback ended up playing really well and finished the season on a real high note. So they've got a ton of confidence coming into this year because of that.\n\nWe feel good about it. We typically wait on (announcing captains), unless there's just an obvious person that everybody has identified, players most importantly and staff, that you feel like going into the summer, this person has separated themselves, and everybody views them as such and you want to name them to have that leadership going into the summer.\n\nThere's also the aspect of holding it as long as possible, and then there's multiple guys that are working their tails off to become leaders on our team. And the reality is, when you're talking about a team of 125 or whatever the number may be, we're going to need more leadership than just the captains.\n\nSo I think we're in a good spot there. I see this team being more vocal. Myself and Chuck Losey and Coach Palko spent a ton of time talking about this. I see these guys being more vocal in challenging their teammates. Holding their teammates accountable. I think those things have been pretty evident in the summer workouts and so far in camp.\n\nSo I think we are in a good place, but we're going to need it. We're going to need a ton of it. And we'll probably hear, probably in the next two weeks, we'll probably name captains. But then we are going to need more leadership than just those guys, too.\n\nIt's been really good. And I think the competition is really important. Having three guys there, two of which that have kicked in college games, I think is really important. (Plus) a young exciting player that has really done a nice job in practice.\n\nBut as we all know, I don't care what position it is, sometimes there's a difference between practice and games. So the game reps carry a lot of weight for us. I think if it's close between two guys, at the end of training camp and we are talking about naming a starter, you probably give the edge to the guy that has game experience to go with someone that has no game experience, then the competition, the gap needs to be significant enough to make up for that.\n\nBut I just think the competition is important. I think sometimes at those positions, there's not the same level of competition. Maybe there is for the defensive end or the corner position, and we've tried to create that as much as we can.\n\nSander has grown a lot and learned from that experience (of being benched in the 2023 season opener). In terms of just pure talent of kicking the ball, he's impressive. I mean, he's very, very impressive. So we'll see how this plays out.\n\nBut the competition has been really good but I think the game experience could and will factor into the decision process.\n\nSALE: 60% Off Annual Lions247 VIP; or Monthly W/ Fantastic Perk"
