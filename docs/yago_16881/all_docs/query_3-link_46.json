        "text": "James Franklin Harrell, Sr., 83, of Newnan, Georgia, passed away peacefully on June 20th, 2023, at his home, surrounded by his loving family. He was born at home to the late Millard Harrell and the late Thelma Irene Adkisson Harrell on February 14th, 1940, in Thomasville, GA. He grew up in south Georgia as the family moved around the region working as sharecroppers.\n\nJames was a loving husband to his late wife Janis, to whom he was married for 38 years. He is survived by his son Wendell (Tonya); his daughters Vickie Smith, Tina Poore, Rachel Foster (Ray), and Pamela Schoentag (David); his numerous grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, and nephews; siblings Joyce Marie Harrell Thrower and Jerry Harrell (Sue). He was preceded in death by his brothers Thomas Andrew Harrell and Wendall Harrell. James’ family was the center of his world, and he cherished every moment spent with them.\n\nJames was a retired roofer who ran his own business alongside his late wife for 40 plus years and veteran of the US Army. In his leisure time, he enjoyed fishing, front porch sittin’, listening to classic country music, reading novels, or watching wrestling. He also enjoyed tending to his garden and watching his plants flourish around him.\n\nJames will be remembered for his kind heart, his warm smile, and the enduring love for his family. He loved telling his stories and his sense of humor was infectious. He was so lovable many just called him Daddy. As we mourn his loss, we take comfort in the knowledge that his spirit will continue to live on in the hearts and minds of those who knew and loved him.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at his home in Newnan on Sunday, June 25th at 2:00 p.m. where friends and family can come together to celebrate his life through love, laughter, and stories of James."
