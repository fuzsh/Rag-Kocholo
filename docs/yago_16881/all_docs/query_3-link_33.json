        "text": "Irene Welsh\n\nIrene (Miner) Welsh was born on Sept. 21, 1889 in or near Mill Run, Fayette County, PA, the daughter of William Henry \"Squire\" and Sara Jane (Basinger) Minerd.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 1909, when she was age 19, Irene married 23-year-old James Franklin Welsh (Feb. 27, 1886-1966), the son of John and Ellen (Nicklow) Welsh of Mill Run. Her father, a justice of the peace, performed the wedding ceremony.\n\nThe Welshes were the parents of seven children  Cathryn Marie Stillwagon, Margaret Helen Miller, Thelma Ream, John Henry Welsh, Gertrude Williams, James Clyde Welsh and Daniel Leslie Welsh.\n\nThey resided in Mill Run for many years. In 1920, federal census enumeration records show that their home was next door to Irene's parents, with James working in a local coal mine. When the U.S. Census again was taken in 1930, they resided in Mill Run, with James employed as a laborer for Georges Construction. Living just a few doors away were Irene's brothers and sisters in law, Frank and Ida (Grimm) Miner and Clyde and Jane (Hiles) Miner.\n\nIn 1931, their daughter Mildred was born when the family temporarily made its home in Greensburg, Westmoreland County.\n\nJames and Irene and their 4 eldest children, circa 1916\n\nIrene with youngest son Daniel Welsh\n\nWith the nation in the grip of the Great Depression in the 1930s, work would have been difficult for James to find. Sometime in the late '30s, however, he found a job as a laborer with the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was one of the ways President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the federal government tried to overcome unemployment and is widely considered one of the Roosevelt's largest and most ambitious undertakings of his \"New Deal\" to get the nation back on sound economic footing. Over the years, the WPA hired millions of out-of-work individuals to build public works projects, such as roads, bridges, retaining walls and buildings.\n\nThe census of 1940 lists the Welshes in Springfield Township, with James laboring for the WPA and son John as a loader in a local coal mine.\n\nIn about 1943, the family relocated to Connellsville, Fayette County, where James secured a job with Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation. Their address was 1929 Springfield Pike. He appears to have finished his working career with the company.\n\nNormalville Cemetery\n\nSadly, the Shadow of Death cleaved apart the family in 1966. In May, married daughter Cathryn Stillwagon passed away at the untimely age of 56 from the effects of coronary heart disease.\n\nJust under a month later, having suffered from hardening of the arteries, James contracted bronchial pneumonia and died on June 3, 1966 in Connellsville State Hospital, at the age of 80. His remains were laid to rest at the Normalville Cemetery.\n\nIrene outlived her husband by only little more than a year. She passed away on Sept. 30, 1967. She is buried beside her husband in the Normalville Cemetery.\n\n~ Daughter Cathryn (Welsh) Stillwagon ~\n\nDaughter Cathryn Welsh (1909-1966) was born on Sept. 5, 1909.\n\nShe married Lewis J.

Lewis worked for the Scottdale Wood Products Company.\n\nLewis suffered a heart attack and passed away at the age of 60 on May 11, 1965. He was interred in Mount Olive Cemetery near Pennsville.\n\nCathryn followed him to the grave a year later. She was burdened with coronary heart disease and was admitted to Connellsville State Hospital, where she succumbed to death on May 7, 1966.\n\nSon Kenneth Daniel \"Chug\" Stillwagon made his home in Mount Pleasant, Westmoreland County, circa 1965.\n\nDaughter Mildred Irene \"Mert\" Stillwagon (1931-2005) was born on Feb. 11, 1931 in Greensburg.

She also was a machine operator for nine years with Williamshouse Corporation. Among her hobbies were baking, cooking, sewing and gardening. Mildred passed away at age 74 on March 25, 2005. She was laid to rest in Mt. Tabor Cemetery in Normalville, following a funeral led by Pastor Joseph Wingrove. She was survived by 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
