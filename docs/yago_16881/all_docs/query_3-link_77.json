        "text": "Just when you thought the ever-positive head coach of Penn State football couldn’t get any more interesting, James Franklin revealed some fascinating news about his lineage.\n\nThrough his Ancestry.com profile, the Langhorne, Pennsylvania native recently uncovered that his historic family lineage extends beyond football greats all the way to no other than your favorite founding father: Benjamin Franklin.\n\nLanghorne, Pa. sits on the beautiful border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, tucked between Trenton and the numerous Philadelphia suburbs. As someone who hails from “just outside of Philly” it comes as no surprise to Coach that someone with the last name “Franklin” from the area is related to the legendary Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIn case you skipped out on your entire social studies education since birth, Benjamin Franklin is one of America’s founding fathers, famous for his multi-page resume, which included author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. Franklin’s greatest achievement is furiously advocating for the turkey to be America’s national bird.\n\nWe did some further investigating into the lineage and reached out for confirmation and comment from the Benjamin Franklin Society of America. Resident Benjamin Franklin lover and historian Doug Dooling confirmed the connection through a common ancestor that “married someone from the Franklin family. Then they had babies, and so on and so forth.”\n\nA rare depiction of Sir Arthur Franklin.\n\nJames Franklin’s electric coaching and charisma is no shock now for fans who can take pride in the fact that their head football coach is related to one of America’s greatest thinkers, but most importantly, the people can proudly proclaim the fact that their coach’s ancestor helped to design the first ever rocking chair."
