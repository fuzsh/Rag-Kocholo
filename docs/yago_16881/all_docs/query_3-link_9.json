        "text": "My wife stayed up last night and we both watched the national championship in wrestling. Now she didn‚Äôt watch 15 minutes total of the big 10 championships but she pretty much knows how good Penn St is is wrestling. She kept hearing how dominant Penn St was in this tournament and it kept showing Cael Sanderson and when Levi Haines won the National Championship she was all over the bed and all out of the blue she said James Franklin needs to get his shit together and learn how to coach like the Penn St coach does in wrestling üòÇ. She asked me why don‚Äôt we have any Penn St wrestling shirts which I told her I do but now she wants one so i gotta get her a Penn St National championship shirt. She‚Äôs never asked for a Penn St wrestling shirt or I would‚Äôve bought her one lol. How sweet it is baby National Champions again üòÅ She works with Ohio St people at work and she‚Äôs tired of losing to Ohio St and James Franklin needs to get his shit together üòÇ she was killing me last night lol"
