        "text": "Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama\n\nA Memoir\n\nWritten by: Bob Odenkirk\n\nNarrated by: Bob Odenkirk, Steve Rudnick, Leo Benvenuti\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 52 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nBob Odenkirk’s career is inexplicable. And yet he will try like hell to explicate it for you. Charting a “Homeric” decades-long “odyssey” from his origins in the seedy comedy clubs of Chicago to a dramatic career full of award nominations - with a side trip into the action-man world that is baffling to all who know him - it’s almost like there are many Bob Odenkirks! But there is just one and one is plenty. Featuring humorous tangents, wild characters, and Bob’s trademark unflinching drive, Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama is a classic tale told by a determined idiot."
