He turned professional the following year and won his first 65 matches and the Italian middleweight championship. In 1965 he claimed both the world junior-middleweight title and the European middleweight title. The next year he boxed outside Italy for the first time, retaining his European title in a bout in Berlin but losing his world junior-middleweight title to Ki-Soo Kim in a 15-round decision in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nBenvenuti went to the United States in 1967 and took the world middleweight title on April 17 by defeating Emile Griffith in a 15-round decision. They met again on September 28, 1967, and in the rematch Griffith regained the title by prevailing in a 15-round decision. On March 4, 1968, they fought a third time, and Benvenuti took the title back by winning a 15-round decision. Benvenuti then successfully defended his championship by outpointing Don Fullmer in 15 rounds on December 14, 1968. He made two more successful defenses in 1969, winning on the 7th-round disqualification of Fraser Scott on October 4 and knocking out Luis Rodriguez in the 11th round on November 22."
