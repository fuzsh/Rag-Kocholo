        "text": "The Italian navigators entered the New World, and the natives were friendly. Less than four months after Mayor Robert Jackson and several other Montclair municipal officials visited the township’s new sister city of Aquilonia, Italy, it was Montclair’s turn to greet municipal officials from Aquilonia, who arrived for a much-anticipated reciprocal visit on October 5 and were feted with a welcoming ceremony. The ceremony was delayed by about an hour and a half owing to last-minute snags, but the delegation looked none the worse for wear as Mayor Jackson and Montclair resident Raffaele Marzullo, an Aquilonia native and the individual who was instrumental in the sister-city union, expressed their gratitude for the visit.\n\nMayor Jackson said it was great to see the Italians once again after having met them in Aquilonia, and Mirco Annunziata, the Aquilonia town assessor, said in English that he was grateful for the hospitality he and his colleagues had been shown. He spoke of establishing a new symbolic bridge between the two towns, and he said he hoped it would last for years to come. Aquilonia Sister City Committee President Raffaele Michele Gala, who spoke Italian through Marzullo’s translation (Marzullo did all of the necessary translating), said he was glad the two towns could come together and hoped that they could “forge new bonds” going forward.\n\nMembers of the Montclair Township Council (Third Ward Councilor Sean Spiller was absent) expressed their own sentiments at the welcoming ceremony. First Ward Councilor William Hurlock said he was thrilled with the prospect of showing Montclair to the guests, and he thanked them for helping him connect with relatives he hadn’t even known he had when he visited Aquilonia with Mayor Jackson in June. Councilor Hurlock added that the residents of Aquilonia had “truly touched our hearts.” Councilor-at-Large Rich McMahon, who was also on that trip, said his best memory of Aquilonia was the “sheer quantity of fabulous food.” Unlike other members of the council, Councilor McMahon does not claim Italian heritage, but, as an Irish-American, he had expressed gratitude for Italians in America back in November 2016 when the sister-city connection with Aquilonia was first proposed.\n\n“If it weren’t for the Italians,” he’d said, “who would the Irish have to marry?”\n\nDeputy Mayor / Second Ward Councilor Robin Schlager, who has Italian ancestry through her grandmother, said she regretted being unable to go on the official trip in June but was hoping to visit eventually. Councilor-at-Large Robert Russo showed a picture of his 98-year-old mother, Florence, who hails from Avellino. He confessed to never having been to Italy despite his own Italian heritage and has always wanted to go. He told the Italians that if they ventured to St. Lucy’s Church in Newark, it was his mother’s parish, and his uncle was a priest there.\n\nFourth Ward Councilor Renée Baskerville celebrated the fact that the residents of Aquilonia were joining Montclair residents at a time when the township offers great diversity of Montclair’s population, and she also noted that Italians and blacks had lived next to each other in the Fourth Ward for many years. She also applauded Italy for being first among nations in gender pay equity, where women make the equivalent of 98 cents to every dollar that men make (the ratio is 82 cents to the dollar in the U.S.). She also said she was grateful that the sister cities were building “bridges, not walls.”\n\nAlso speaking was Township Clerk Linda Wanat, who visited Aquilonia with the Montclair delegate that went in June. She said she was captivated by the wonderful people she’d met and the rolling hills and sunsets she’d seen. The mood of the ceremony was encapsulated by Leonardo Marzullo, president of the St. Vito Society, who said the sister-city relationship was proof that there are so many varieties of people in the world, yet “we all talk the same language. We all talk about being kind with people and being good hosts and be[ing] friendly, and try to accomplish something together.”\n\nThe ceremony concluded with Mayor Jackson presenting the key to Montclair to the Aquilonia delegation. Later, Raffaele Marzullo toasted the mayor for going beyond ceremonial acts and making a real effort to bring the two towns together, praising him for his leadership.\n\nThe Aquilonia delegation is scheduled to attend the upcoming Columbus Day Mass at the invitation of Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. The delegation will also march with the New York City Police Department in the city’s Columbus Day parade."
