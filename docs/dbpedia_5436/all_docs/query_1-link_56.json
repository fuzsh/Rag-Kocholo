        "text": "In order to survive in a destroyed post-World War II Naples, the pennliess Filumena takes to prostitution, with wealthy Domenico Soriano (Marcello Mastroianni) a regular customer. The young beauty soon becomes his mistress – and over many decades, their lives are intertwined. But as Filumena, Sophia Loren is slow in telling him that she has borne three sons – and not necessarily to Domenico.\n\nA tragicomedy melodrama, passions run high in Vittorio De Sica’s adaptation of Neapolitan author Edoardo De Filippo’s novel. Unfortunately, whilst Marriage Italian Style sees Loren at her glorious best as she refuses to conform to her expected subversive role, caricature and farce are too often the order of the day. What could and should have been a social commentary becomes a narrative played for laughs.\n\nNominated for 1965 best actress Oscar and 1966 best foreign language film\n\nRating: 44%\n\nDirector: Vittorio De Sica (Bicycle Thieves, Umberto D.)\n\nWriter: Renato Castellani (Two Cents Worth of Hope, Romeo & Juliet), Tonino Guerra (Blow-Up, Kaos), Leonardo Benvenuti (Speriamo che sia femmina, Amici miei), Piero De Bernardi (Speriamo che sia femmina, Amici miei) – adapted fromt he novel by Edoardo De Filippo"
