        "text": "by Allan Fish\n\n(Italy 1961 121m) DVD1\n\nAka. La ragazza con la valigia\n\nA travel iron in a leather case\n\np Maurizio Lodi-Fé, Charles Delac d Valerio Zurlini w Leonardo Benvenuti, Piero de Bernardi, Enrico Medioli, Giuseppe Patrone Griffi, Valerio Zurlini ph Tino Santoni ed Mario Serandrei art Flavio Mogherini\n\nClaudia Cardinale (Aida Zapponi), Jacques Perrin (Lorenzo Fainardi), Luciana Angiolillo (Lorenzo’s aunt), Gian Maria Volonte (Piero Benotti), Corrado Pani (Marcello Fainardi), Romolo Valli (Don Pietro Introna), Renato Baldini (Francia), Elsa Albani (Lucia),\n\nAn open-topped car pulls up on the roadside. A young woman gets out. She looks around pensively, finger in mouth. She looks increasingly desperate. Now here’s the question; imagine this was a Hollywood film, what is the girl looking for? A missing pet, perhaps, like Holly Golightly? A piece of jewellery? Either way, she’s retracing her steps, right? A world of no. You see, this isn’t an American film, this is Italy, earthy Italy. Our heroine isn’t looking for anything but a quiet spot, for in her own words she’s about to explode if she doesn’t find a place to squat down and have a piss. She finds a spot, and on emerging with relief, as Peggy Lee’s ‘Fever’ blasts out of the car radio, she has only one question for her male companion; “did you look?” It’s a wonderful opening.\n\nThe girl in question, Aida, is the would-be cabaret singer who has been on a holiday with playboy Marcello. The problem is that he’s grown bored with her, having sampled the goods, and proceeds to drive off and leave her after arranging to meet her in a bar. Returning home, she follows him and Marcello sends his 16 year old younger brother Lorenzo downstairs to brush her off with some lie that this isn’t his house, which, as Marcello used a false name, proves somewhat easy. When Lorenzo takes one look at her, he falls in love, and proceeds to help her out, paying for a hotel room, letting her have a bath at his aunt’s place when everyone’s out, and even lending her 5,000 lira. Slowly Aida realises that Lorenzo is in love with her, and she can only feel friendship. It doesn’t need Lorenzo’s priest and tutor to tell you, this isn’t going to end well.\n\nWith the possible exception of Skolimowski’s Deep End, has there ever been a more accurate study of the pining love for a teenage boy for an older, worldlier girl? Zurlini’s miraculous film is simply one of the forgotten classics of Italian cinema, not helped by being available shorn of half an hour and being dubbed awfully on all previously existing prints. Finally restored to DVD (though the old public domain prints are still out there), it’s an absolute treat, anchored by two wonderfully authentic turns from its young stars. Perrin was not only always at home in Italian surroundings, he even looks Italian, if you follow me, and his every aching glance and yearn hits you like a kidney punch. Just watch the scene where Cardinale dances with another man into the night, and the jealous Lorenzo aches that it isn’t him, while Tiomkin’s ‘De Guello’ from Rio Bravo is heard on the soundtrack (well, John Wayne did say it was a declaration of war). Cardinale, in her turn, is simply gorgeous, a piece of flotsam used, discarded and forgotten by various men, just trying to make something of her life and needing it too badly to worry initially about where the help came from. With both leads being so perfect, it’s easy to forget that both were dubbed; don’t forget Cardinale, though Italian, was raised in Paris and only spoke French in her early years of stardom.\n\nShowing the same delicacy of feeling as on his previous film, Violent Summer (again with a French male lead and with an ending left open to debate), he even gets to top that film’s celebrated love scene in the sand with what surely goes down as one of the most tender in film history, as Lorenzo gets as close to consummation as he ever will, caressing Aida’s hair like it’s his last night on earth. Let me put it this way, if that fire that burnt down the original Cinema Paradiso had happened several years later, their embrace would have been on that montage. Then again, come to think of it, who was it who sat there, arms behind his head enraptured?"
