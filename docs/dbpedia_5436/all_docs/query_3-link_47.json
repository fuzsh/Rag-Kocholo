        "text": "At more than three and a half hours, Once Upon a Time in America is no small investment. A mob film full of mystery, violence and drama, there are inevitable comparisons between this and such films as The Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface and the like. But, directed by Sergio Leone, this 1984 Cannes Film Festival sensation is firmly stamped with its own European aesthetic of the American dream gone wrong.\n\nReturning to Manhattan’s Jewish Lower East Side 35 years after a self-imposed exile, former Prohibition-era gangster, Noodles (Robert De Niro) finds himself confronting memories of the past and the responsiblity for the death of his best friend, Max (James Woods). It’s an epic story of heists, double-crosses, drugs and violence (the misogyny of the time can be hard to take, including two rape scenes). But an older Noodles looks for atonement – and in his search he makes unexpected discoveries.\n\nButchered on its release (more than 90 minutes of the film seen in Cannes edited out), this longer version, now dated, can be hard going. Whilst not quite the classic many maintain it to be, Once Upon a Time in America sees De Niro in a role that fits like a second skin and features a fascinating soundtrack from Ennio Morricone, part haunting pan pipes, part cloyingly sentimental schmaltz. It’s also the film debut by pre-teenage Jennifer Connelly.\n\nRating: 65%\n\nDirector: Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, The Good The Bad & The Ugly)\n\nWriter: Leonardo Benvenuti (Amici miei, Between Miracles), Enrico Medioli (Rocco & His Brothers, The Leopard), Franco Arcalli (Last Tango in Paris, 1900), Franco Ferrini (Phenomena, The Pool Hustlers), Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, The Good The Bad & The Ugly) – based on the novel by Harry Grey\n\nMain cast: Robert De Niro (The Godfather Pt II, The Irishman), James Woods (Salvador, Be Cool), Elizabeth McGovern (Downton Abbey, Ordinary People)\n\nIn order to survive in a destroyed post-World War II Naples, the pennliess Filumena takes to prostitution, with wealthy Domenico Soriano (Marcello Mastroianni) a regular customer. The young beauty soon becomes his mistress – and over many decades, their lives are intertwined. But as Filumena, Sophia Loren is slow in telling him that she has borne three sons – and not necessarily to Domenico.\n\nA tragicomedy melodrama, passions run high in Vittorio De Sica’s adaptation of Neapolitan author Edoardo De Filippo’s novel. Unfortunately, whilst Marriage Italian Style sees Loren at her glorious best as she refuses to conform to her expected subversive role, caricature and farce are too often the order of the day. What could and should have been a social commentary becomes a narrative played for laughs.\n\nNominated for 1965 best actress Oscar and 1966 best foreign language film\n\nRating: 44%\n\nDirector: Vittorio De Sica (Bicycle Thieves, Umberto D.)\n\nWriter: Renato Castellani (Two Cents Worth of Hope, Romeo & Juliet), Tonino Guerra (Blow-Up, Kaos), Leonardo Benvenuti (Speriamo che sia femmina, Amici miei), Piero De Bernardi (Speriamo che sia femmina, Amici miei) – adapted fromt he novel by Edoardo De Filippo\n\nMain cast: Sophia Loren (Two Women, The Life Ahead), Marcello Mastroianni (La dolce vita, 8½), Aldo Puglisi (Seduced and Abandoned, The Birds, the Bees and the Italians)"
