Sentenced to life imprisonment for armed robberies, one of which resulted in the death of two women, Goldman pleads not guilty to murder. The court proceedings transform Goldman into a hero of the intellectual left. Ever the agitator, the mercurial Goldman throws his own trial into chaos, risking a death sentence. The Goldman Case paints a portrait of a militant revolutionary, but also of a society torn apart by patterns of racism and injustice that are still virulent today.\n\nDirector: Cédric Kahn\n\nWriters: Nathalie Hertzberg, Cédric Kahn\n\nProducer: Benjamin Elalouf\n\nCinematographer: Patrick Ghiringhelli\n\nEditor: Yann Dedet\n\nCasting Director: Antoine Carrard\n\nProduction Designer: Guillaume Deviercy\n\nBFC JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL SPONSORED BY EDWIN & DORIS COHEN\n\nView Event →\n\nSHTTL (2022) | Featuring Guest Speaker Moshe Lobel | JEWISH FILM FESTIVAL 2024\n\nNR | 114 min | In Yiddish and Ukrainian with English subtitles\n\nFeaturing Guest Speaker Moshe Lobel from the cast of SHTTL\n\nA Jewish village in Ukraine, bordering Poland, is on the verge of being taken over by Nazis.

The dialogue is almost entirely in Yiddish, and the film is mostly in black-and-white.
