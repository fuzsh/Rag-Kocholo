        "text": "Who are Those Guys? - Ennio Balbo\n\nEnnio Balbo was born on April 18, 1922 in Naples, Italy. He studied acting at the Sharoff Academy in Rome. After World War II he joined Paola Bourbons acting troop. It was here he met his wife actress Dora Calindri [1911-2002] who was the sister of actor Ernesto Calindri [1909-1999]. Balbo was almost 40 years-old before he began his full-time career as an actor. He would go on to appear in 45 films from 1958 until 1988. Balbo also appeared often on TV and was a film dubber voicing in Italian the voices of Norman Fell, George Kennedy and Sebastian Cabot. He was also heard in cartoons and television series. Ennio appeared in five Euro-westerns: “Day of Anger”, “Two Faces of the Dollar” both in 1967, “Gatling Gun” and “Two Pistols and a Coward” both 1968 and “The Stranger’s Gundown” (aka “Django the Bastard”) in 1969.

If a ranger died or left they hired a new one. Yet they never went over 26. Our show was based on real history. “Those rangers were paid 50 dollars a month, and they had to provide their own horses, weapons and ammunition.\n\nNow look how Arizona has grown. Today there are condominiums where one [we filmed ‘26 Men’]. The television series established Henderson as an expert gun showman. His skill caused the president of ABC to rework the ‘26 Men’ pilot to showcase Henderson’s agility and fast draw.\n\nAt one time, Henderson won the title of Fast Draw and Gun Dexterity Champion of the World. His fast draw was so fast that it was photographed with a missile camera.\n\nHis awards include the 2003 Golden Boot Award for his significant contributions to the Western genre of television and movies.\n\nHe generously supports the fans of the Old West and has made personal appearances at numeroue rodeos, fairs and film festivals.\n\nAs a cowboy, Henderson is the real deal. Born on a ranch in Pueblo, Colorado, ho honed his skills as a rider, a roper and an expert marksman.\n\nDemonstrating his skills got him most jobs, and when he didn’t get roles, he was hired to train the other actors.\n\nHe once trained “Sugarfoot” star Will Hutchins on guns and roping.\n\n“It was the heyday of Westerns. We used to joke, if the TV repairman wanted to repair your TV, he’d take the back off and empty out the dead cowboys and Indians.\n\nHenderson’s other credits include “Wells Fargo”, “Cheyenne”, “Sergeant Preston” and numerous European “spaghetti westerns” (Treasure of the Aztecs” and “Pyramid of the Son Gods”).\n\nHenderson, who traveled widely with the Merchant Marines during World War II has had homes in Torrance, Laguna Beach, Palm Springs and finally Ridgecrest, where his mother, father and aunt lived.\n\nIn 1962 then Arizona Governor Paul J. Fannin named Kelo Henderson an Honorary Citizen of Arizona. Then in 1963 the Old West Arizona Rangers Historical Society made him an honorary Arizona Ranger.\n\nTo catch a glimpse of Henderson and “26 Men” go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWE_Z6-TRi4\n\nFIND A PLACE TO DIE\n\nJoe!

The gold is recovered and Joe and Lisa head to California to start a new life together.\n\nYouTube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvuJ20ocB_0\n\nRIP Aldo Berti\n\nItalian actor Aldo Berti died shortly after midnight in Florence, Italy from brain cancer on December 26,2010 . He was 74. Aldo was born on February 29, 1936 in Florence. Aldo appeared in over 40 films from 1956's “Time of Vacation” with Vittorio De Sica until 1972's “Return of the Holy Ghost”. Half of his films were Euro-westerns. Among them were supporting roles in “A Stranger in Sacaramento” and “Why Go On Killing?” both 1965, “The Dirty Outlaws” and “A Stranger in Town” both 1967, “Once Upon a Time in the West” (1968), “El Puro” (1969), “The Ballad of Death Valley” (1970), “Have a Nice Funeral” and “Mallory Must Not Die” both in 1971 and two Spirito Santo films in 1972. Aldo lived a nomadic life traveling all over the world after giving up his film career. Aldo was living life with no cares and a mind like a sponge soaking up everything he could see and hear. He was friends with William Berger, had a romantic relationship with actress Barbara Steele after which he almost committed suicide. Berti was friends with Sarah Churchill, became a poet and wrote a book of poems entitled ‘Canto Finale’. On February 14, 1984 while traveling up the Nile with a load of patients for Juba and the first Doctors Without Borders they were attacked by armed men with machine guns, grenades and burned. Hundreds died and Aldo’s spirit died with them. From that point on he lived a personal life of shame for not dying with them. For many years he lived a simple life in Morocco. He was diagnosed with brain cancer in October of this year and returned to Florence to face death. One of the most recognized Italian character actors has left us. We should best remember Aldo by one of his famous sayings, \"To be born is the privilege of all, having lived a privileged few.\" Rest in peace amigo.\n\n15 SCAFFOLDS FOR A KILLER\n\nQuindici forche per un assassino - Italian title\n\nQuince horcas para un assesino - Spanish title\n\n15 potences pour un salopard - French title\n\nDie schnutzigen Dreizehn - German title\n\nDirty Busters - German title\n\nDekapente aghones gia ena dolofono - Greek title\n\nDirty Fifteen - English title\n\n15 Scaffolds for a Murderer - English title\n\n15 Scaffolds for a Killer - English title\n\nA 1968 Italian, Spanish co-production [Eos Film (Rome), Centauro Film (Madrid)]\n\nProducer: Luis Vasquez\n\nDirector: Nunzio Malasomma\n\nStory: Mario di Nardo\n\nScreenplay: Mario de Nardo, J.

Without much trouble he manages to track down, kill most of the criminals and return the filthy lucre to it's rightful owners. The only slight problem is that he is unable to capture Jim Norton - who has apparently been murdered in a gunfight elsewhere. Not entirely persuaded by this story, he decides to journey to Montana , where the villain's 'twin brother' Trevor happens to live.\n\nMontana , however, is in the grip of an escalating range war between the farmers, who want to erect barbed wire fences around their land, and the ranchers, who want the right for their cattle to roam freely. Matters are especially tense in Miles City , the town where Regan ends up - mistaken as the new sheriff (and equipped with essential diminutive, alcoholic, cackling deputy).\n\nHis workload immediately become burdensome. The ranchers are led by a particularly unappealing individual called Bransbury, whose credentials are cemented by the way in which he regularly twists the ends of his moustache in a caddish fashion. The farmers, suffering from his unpleasant habit of burning down their property, have formed a resistance group, led by. Trevor Norton. Trevor, despite appearances, believes in peace and seems to be an essentially good man; only willing to fight when pushed into having no options. He also has a pretty niece, Sally, to whom Regan soon takes a shine.\n\nAdding to the already complicated story is the fact that Bransbury has also hired a couple of killers, Buck Dago and Sam, who were coincidentally members of the original Norton gang. They realize the new identity of their old boss and are determined to find out what exactly has happened to the money that they helped steal. - Matt Blake\n\nYouTube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivqOnb_Nkic\n\nWho are Those Gals? - Carroll Baker\n\nKarolina Piekarski was born on December 28, 1931 in Johnston, Pennsylvania.

One of the company's greedy agents, Mike Allison, kicks out both his white partners and the Indians. He has his some of his associates secretly murdered and blames it on the Indians, who are then killed when they get in the way of his plans. Five chiefs with lifelong shares in the Oil Company die mysteriously as a result. The young chief Shave Head asks his a half-blood brother Chris Howard for help. Chris assumes the post of deputy sheriff and tries to expose Allison and the murderers. When a representative of the Oil Company turns up in Wind River City and exposes Allison's plot, the white inhabitants begin to take sides. Allison does his utmost to defend himself and finally has the oil camp set on fire, passing it off as an act of revenge perpetrated by the Indians. The Indians are helpless against this accusation and Howard must pay for it with his life.\n\nYouTube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ltbRRaA1k\n\nSTRAIGHT TO HELL RETURNS\n\nThere was once a version of STRAIGHT TO HELL (1987) which was five or six minutes longer. At the eleventh hour, the producer, the editor and I (Alex Cox) cut out half a dozen scenes, in a misguided flight of cutting room madness, thinking that by making the film shorter we were making it better, by making it go a bit faster we were making it funnier...\n\nWe were wrong. Now, fortunately, the UCLA Film and TV Archive has rescued the original Interpositive of the uncut version, the missing scenes are restored, and a new HD master has been created, Dan Wool has recovered the missing audio, Richard Beggs has whipped the picture into aural shape, Tom Richmond and Beau Leon have created a new visual strategy - heavy on the yellows and deep blacks - and Webster Colcord has animated some additional skeletons.\n\nAll to be in theaters again in October and November 2010, and on DVD and download on December 14, 2010. This - along with Microcinema's release of Searchers 2.0 - must be the perfect stocking-filler. Oh! And did I mention all the digital violence by Collateral Image, and the dolly tracks, and the new shot of George's shoes?\n\nHappy 70th Birthday Klaus-Peter Thiele\n\nKlaus-Peter Thiele was born December 14, 1940 in Meiningen, Germany and is the son of actor Heino Thiele [1891-1964]. Klaus-Peter graduated from high school in Berlin-Tegel and startedappearing in stage engagements in Parchim and Potsdam, before appearing in DEFA films for nearly three decades. His first film role is a resounding, and international success playing the title role in the anti-war film \"The Adventures of Werner Holt\" (1964). Later we see him in playing many different characters, sometimes as a sympathetic figure, but also as a conceited, haughty and arrogant snob. Gladly, he would go back on this earlier character, when it comes to the Nazi occupation of roles. Thiele played this very often in Polish films, but also in the short TV series by Rudi, such as \"Archiv des Todes\" and \"Front ohneGnade\". After the political changes of 1989, the actor with the deep, warm voice appeared on stage in Hamburg and Munich, gaining experience, he also becomes a regular cast member of the Störtebeker Festival in Ralswiek. He remembers findly working with Bud Spencer in the movie \"Condor Mission\" that is released in the United States. Klaus-Peter Thiele has lived for many years with the painter Marie Rautenberg, the daughter of Valeska Rautenberg, which has also worked on several film and TV productions. His sister, Brigitte Thiele (1936-2006) also worked occasionally as an actress. Thiele appeared in one Euro-western “White Wolves” (1969) . Today we celebrate Klaus-Peter Thiele’s 70th birthday."
