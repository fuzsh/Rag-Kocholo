        "text": "Isabella Rossellini is an Italian actress, filmmaker, author, philanthropist, and model. Born into a family of cinematic royalty on June 18, 1952, in Rome, Italy, she is the daughter of Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian director Roberto Rossellini. Rossellini's early life was marked by her parents' high-profile careers and their eventual divorce, shaping her unique perspective on fame and personal life. Rossellini's film career began in 1976 with a minor role in A Matter of Time, directed by Vincente Minnelli. However, her breakthrough came in 1986 when she starred in David Lynch's Blue Velvet, a role that earned her widespread acclaim for her intense performance. Rossellini continued to work with Lynch in Wild at Heart and has since starred in numerous films such as Death Becomes Her, Fearless, and Joy. Despite being known primarily for her acting, Rossellini also ventured into writing, directing, and producing, notably creating the series of short films Green Porno, exploring animal behavior. In addition to her acting career, Rossellini's striking features led her to become a successful model. She served as the face of Lanc√¥me for 14 years, becoming one of the highest-paid models worldwide. Beyond her work in film and fashion, Rossellini is committed to conservation efforts, specifically focusing on wildlife preservation. She studied animal behavior and conservation at Hunter College in New York City and has used her platform to raise awareness and funds for various environmental causes.\n\nAsia Argento stepped out of her horror maestro father's shadows with award-winning roles in \"Perdiamoci di vista\" (1994) and \"Traveling Companion\" (1996) before becoming a provocative director herself and a pivotal figure in Hollywood's #MeToo movement. Born in Rome, Italy in 1975 to cult horror auteur Dario Argento and model Daria Nicolodi, Asia Argento made her big screen debut aged nine in \"Demons 2\" (1986) and two years later took the leading role of runaway Martina in \"Zoo\" (1988). After appearing as sole survivor Lotte in \"The Church\" (1989), Nanni Moretti's daughter in \"Red Wood Pigeon\" (1989) and troubled teen Simona in \"Close Friends\" (1992), Argento was directed by her father for the first time playing an anorexia sufferer in \"Trauma\" (1993), and then as a serial killer-pursuing detective in \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" (1996). Argento truly proved she was a star in her own right when she won Best Actress at Italy's answer to the Oscars for her turns as paraplegic Arianna in comedy \"Perdiamoci di vista\" (1994) and waitress Cora in coming-of-age \"Traveling Companion\" (1996). Argento then ventured into English-language cinema with cyberpunk thriller \"New Rose Hotel\" (1998), portrayed Christine Daae in her father's take on \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1998) and Eponine in miniseries \"Les Miserables\" (2000), and starred as seductive thieves in both \"Viola Kisses Everybody\" (1998) and \"B. Monkey\" (1998). Having previously helmed the \"Prospettive\" segment of horror anthology \"DeGenerazione\" (1994) and documentary shorts about her father and Abel Ferrara, Argento made her feature-length directorial debut with \"Scarlet Diva\" (2000), a semi-autobiographical tale she also starred in, and followed it up with \"The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things\" (2004), a provocative adaptation of JT Leroy's same-named novel in which she played a drug-addicted prostitute single mother. After appearing as undercover spy Yelena in her first blockbuster, \"xXx\" (2002), Argento worked with Gus Van Sant on \"Last Days\" (2005), George A. Romero on \"Land of the Dead\" (2005) and Sofia Coppola on \"Marie Antoinette\" (2006). But she spent the rest of the decade focusing on European cinema, landing major roles in \"Transylvania\" (2006), \"Boarding Gate\" (2007) and \"The Last Mistress\" (2007), playing an American art student in Dario Argento's \"The Mother of Tears\" (2007) and showing up as an exotic dancer in \"Go Tales\" (2007) and cult leader in \"On War\" (2008). After adding the likes of \"Horses\" (2011), \"Islands\" (2011) and \"Baciato dalla fortuna\" (2011) to her filmography, Argento portrayed heiress Lucy Kisslinger in \"Dracula 3D\" (2012), starred in French-Portuguese romance \"Obsessive Rhythms\" and Bangladesh Liberation War drama \"Shongram\" (2014), and directed her third feature film, \"Misunderstood\" (2014), a tragicomedy about a neglected teen coping with her parents' divorce. In 2017 Argento helped to kickstart the #MeToo movement after alleging in a New Yorker article that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein had sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. A year later Argento herself was accused of a similar offence by Jimmy Bennett, an actor aged 17 at the time of the alleged 2013 incident.\n\nDan Castellaneta, a formidable talent in the world of entertainment, is renowned for his versatility that extends from acting to voice-over artistry and writing. Born on October 29, 1957, in Oak Park, Illinois, his passion for performance began at an early age. He honed his craft at Northern Illinois University and, upon graduation, became a regular player in Chicago's improvisational scene before joining the famed Second City improv troupe. His career in television started with The Tracey Ullman Show, but it was his role in The Simpsons that catapulted him into the limelight. Castellaneta has voiced the iconic character of Homer Simpson since the show's inception in 1989. His ability to portray a broad range of characters with distinctive voices, from the dim-witted yet lovable Homer to the cantankerous Groundskeeper Willie, has earned him recognition as a premier voice-over artist. His work on The Simpsons led to several Emmy Awards, demonstrating his prowess in bringing animated characters to life. In addition to his success as a performer, Castellaneta has also made his mark as a writer. He has contributed scripts to several episodes of The Simpsons, showcasing his ability to weave engaging narratives. Beyond this, he has acted in various live-action roles in shows like Friends and Parks and Recreation, and has lent his voice to numerous other animated series. Despite his prolific career, Castellaneta maintains a sense of humility and dedication to his craft, a testament to his enduring appeal in the entertainment industry.\n\nFrank Russell Capra (born Francesco Rosario Capra; May 18, 1897 ‚Äì September 3, 1991) was an Italian-American film director, producer and writer who became the creative force behind some of the major award-winning films of the 1930s and 1940s. Born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five, his rags-to-riches story has led film historians such as Ian Freer to consider him the \"American Dream personified.\"Capra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three Academy Awards for Best Director from six nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories. Among his leading films were It Happened One Night (1934), You Can't Take It with You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939); Capra was nominated as Best Director and as producer for Academy Award for Best Picture on all three films, winning both awards on the first two. During World War II, Capra served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and produced propaganda films, such as the Why We Fight series. After World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such as It's a Wonderful Life (1946), performed poorly when they were first released. In ensuing decades, however, It's a Wonderful Life and other Capra films were revisited favorably by critics. Outside of directing, Capra was active in the film industry, engaging in various political and social issues. He served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, worked alongside the Writers Guild of America, and was head of the Directors Guild of America."
