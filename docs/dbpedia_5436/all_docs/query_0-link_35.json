This script can be written in English, Italian, French or Spanish.\n\nMISP students who will choose the production track will undertake an internship on a film/TV series shooting (or also, if possible, within an established production or distribution company, a TV network or an advertising agency).\n\nFor foreign students who do not speak Italian, it can be difficult/impossible to begin an internship for the production track in Italy: in this case either they have to find and internship in their own country or they have to choose the writing track, and deliver a script as their final work.\n\nFor a good number of the students who will choose the screenwriting path, at the end of their final projects there will also be the possibility of doing an internship in some production company or network or writers room. This internship cannot be guaranteed in advance for everyone, as it will always depend on the acceptance of the candidate by the employer.\n\nDirector\n\nArmando Fumagalli, Università Cattolica del

held on line. The aim of the direction of the course is to have as many classes as possible in presence. But in spite of this a total of 5% to 10% of classes on line could reasonably be expected.\n\nThe Master in International Screenwriting and Production was born with two post-graduate courses in Tecniche di scrittura per la fiction (2000 and 2001), that became a Master Universitario di I livello in 2002-2003. The Master has been running every other year (2004-2005, 2006-2007, etc. until 2014-2015) with the name of Scrittura e produzione per la fiction e il cinema.
