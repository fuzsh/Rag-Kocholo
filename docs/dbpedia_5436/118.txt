Leo Benvenuti (born October 10, 1959) and Stephen Mark "Steve" Rudnick (born February 24, 1958) are a Chicago-based film and television writing and producing team. The two met in 1978 while studying with Josephine Forsberg at The Players Workshop of Second City.[1] In 1990, they developed their own late-night variety show called The Steve and Leo Show.
