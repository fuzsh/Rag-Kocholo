        "text": "1. Saayndhu Saayndhu (YuvanShankar Raja, Ramya NSK)\n\nLovely tune, Fantastic Lyrics, Mind-blowing Interludes, Extraordinary use of Guitar and Wonderful Singing – What else does it need to make it a great song? This songs breezes through your lighter vein. The Prelude and Interludes are true examples of how a guitar and violin should be used.. The last bit in the First Interlude just brings you Goosebumps.. This song is A Real Sedative!! It just Melts you down!!\n\nRating:- 5/5\n\n2. Kaatrai Konjam (Karthik)\n\nTypical Raaja Genre – The Reverse Bowing which Raaja had done it in the end of Pallavi is just brilliant. The Prelude and the Interludes just sets the mood right.. The Humming in the First Interlude and the violin version of the same is fabulous. Karthik has sung effortlessly with a wonderful backing of Clarinet(Or Saxophone?) which even makes this a duet between Karthik and Clarinet!! Lyrics by Naa. Muthukumar is simple and too poetic. “Ennai ingu Meetkathaan Unnai thedi Vanthene!! Meetathodu Meendum Naan Unnil Tholaiguren!!; Same applies to the song!!\n\nRating:- 4.5/5\n\n3. Mudhal Murai (Sunidhi Chauhan)\n\nThis just Flows Hard into your darker veins.. Be it orchestration or singing.. Both are just terrific.. Sunidhi Chauhan just gets everything right. Be it the words, accent, pronunciation – Everything. She just hits the note right. The Violin Interludes are really haunting. Again – Lyrics are too good. Veyila, Mazhaiya, Valiya, Sugama?? Neethane En Ponvasantham!!\n\nRating:- 5/5\n\n4. Vaanam Mella (Ilaiyaraaja, Bela Shende)\n\nPure Raaja.. A Cute Breezy Rich Romantic melody. Whatever be the reason – we all are addicted to this Man’s voice. The way he sings the Charanam – “Kaadhalaana Ullam Rendu Uyirile Inaiyum Tharunam Tharunam” – That’s when you think Music is God. Bela Shende backs him strongly in this duet. The Orchestration just melts you and takes you to a different world!! The Prelude has some Oboe’ish wind instrument(Doesn’t sound like Flute) followed by Violins in the interludes..\n\nRating:- 4.5/5\n\n5. Pudikale Maamu (Suraj Jagan, Karthik)\n\nWhat a Scintillating Start!! A Perfect Soft Rock!! Suraj Jagan doesn’t need an intro for Rock genre.. He has just sung with ultimate enjoyment.. A Real Rocker!! The interlude has an awesome foot tapping Guitar Piece.. Where was this Raaja?? Woooooow!! The choice of words in lyrics like Bucket, Ticket, Wicket is too good.. But somewhere halfway through the song – It shifts to folk abruptly for no reason. The tune is just ordinary in the folk part.\n\nRating:- 3.5/5\n\n6. Yennodu Vaa Vaa (Karthik)\n\nDamn Sure Chartbuster!! Karthik sings it beautifully. The expressions he gives all through the song is what that makes it stand out.. Awesome lyrics by Naa. Muthukumar.. The tune is a more of a melody with a little groove and funk!! The Charanams are beautifully composed.\n\nRating:- 5/5\n\n7. Pengal Yendral (YuvanShankar Raja)\n\nA Perfect Heavy Metal Genre Start – This is something which you don’t expect from Raaja!! He is just Breaking Boundaries.. He also mixes his usual melody in the Charanams. Yuvan’s Voice just suits the song.. And that too when he sings those lines “Enna Solli Enna Penne – Nenjam Oru kaathadi” as if he is made for it !! But somewhere down the song – You feel that there could have been a better singer.\n\nRating:- 3.5/5\n\n8. Sattru Munbu (Ramya NSK)\n\nA Female Pathos on a Darker Vein – Beautifully Rendered by Ramya with a strong backing of Chorus towards the end.. Seducing tune from Raaja.. The Orchestration is completely dominated by Violins. The Lyrics sets the mood right.\n\nRating:- 4/5\n\nOverall:-\n\nIf you ask me one of the Musically Rich albums in India – I would just say this. Just for its Beauty in Orchestration in Various genres ranging from Rock, Hard metal, Melody and Folk. Gautham Menon has got his life time opportunity!!"
