Recent Ilayaraja music was not so good IMO. He was churning out boring and repetitive tunes in Malayalam. Occasionally there were some gems. But I like the Raja of the 80s and 90s.

But it is nowhere compared to his hits in 80s.

Hope we compromised wit ARR's work in VTV even though Gautham+Harris were mass hits.\n\nRajs tried something different here, i cant specify its western impact, Coz Raja's Western Impact also sounds great like \"Punnagai Mannan\"\n\nVaanam- is is wonderful concern to BGM with great impact of Raja's original score but Raja\n\nSaaindhu saaindhu- its sounding okie mainly of Yuvan Voice\n\nSatru munbu, Pengal endral,Pudikala Manu- No comments\n\nHope Gautham would color the tracks with his camera, then we may feel good on visual\n\nAwaiting for the Video tracks for NEPV\n\narunlouie\n\nActive Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 27, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n409\n\nPoints\n\n43\n\nLocation\n\nBengaluru\n\nSep 5, 2012\n\n#12\n\nYes indeed such a disappointment. Only Saindhu Saindhu stays in head. I guess that is the reason to release it as promo song initially.\n\nStill hope in BGM, sounds great in the new official trailer.\n\nsabmohan\n\nNew Member\n\nJoined\n\nSep 17, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nchennai\n\nSep 17, 2012\n\n#13\n\nI was listening to the NEPV - album by Ilayaraja.\n\nThis is fantabulous..............

Why such a overdosage of the orchestration? Do Tamil film songs need a foreign orchestra?

And if there are suitable recording studios in India why would he go to London.\n\nmetalmickey\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 21, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n704\n\nPoints\n\n63\n\nLocation\n\nchennai\n\nSep 18, 2012\n\n#17\n\nI would say too much expectations leads to disappointment and the nepv ost is an classic example! Felt like raja sir was confused on which audience to cater to either his loyal hardcore devotees or the new confused hippy hop era a la yuvan shankar raja sort of stuff!the audio launch got me listening to 'uravugal thodarkathai' instead of the nepv ost!wow now that's an awesome composition!\n\nmetalmickey\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 21, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n704\n\nPoints\n\n63\n\nLocation\n\nchennai\n\nSep 18, 2012\n\n#18\n\n@ sunder-yeah man get you ears checked too ;p time to pay an visit to the ent specialist!\n\nbaijuxavior\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 7, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n4,392\n\nPoints\n\n113\n\nLocation\n\nKerala\n\nSep 18, 2012\n\n#19\n\nNo doubt the songs are catchy. But the hype will soon fade and It won't linger long unlike his golden oldies. Yuvan's tracks remind me of his own composition. Also too much western style. May be the movie demands that. In short, the songs are good but nothing to brag about or exceptional. I still feel he was the best in 80's and early 90s."
