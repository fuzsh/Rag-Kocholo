        "text": "When I was thinking about a topic for my first Spanish blog article, I wanted it to be something that doesnâ€™t exist in Spanish and also something that I really wanted to share with the Spanish speakers. That immediately led me to Ilayaraja â€“ The lege nd, the Maestro, and the soul of South Indian Music for decades. After I published it in Spanish, some of my friends wanted to see the English version ðŸ™‚ So here it is. I know nothing about Music except to enjoy it. I cannot even recognize a Mozart from a Bach. However I do enjoy Western classical music in general. These are only my thoughts that I would like to share with the reader and introduce them to a Music they probably never heard before. After hearing the music you can come to your own conclusions ðŸ™‚\n\nI often wondered if Ilayaraja would have become world renowned like the great modern day composers John Williams, Hans Zimmer etc. if only he did not get caught in the confines of Indian Movie industry . On the other hand considering his simple family background when he entered the movie industry, status of India as a country in the world arena at that time, nearly non-existent independent Music Industry (even today) etc I think the Indian Movie industry is the best possible platform he could have got and we need to be thankful for that.\n\nEven though the Indian Movie industry had its own limitations, he was able to do magic on the silver screen solely through his genius compositions. He brought International music with an Indian flavour to the Indian audience. He has composed approximately 5000+ Songs for the Indian Cinemas (1000+ released movies with an avg. of 5 songs each) + Background music for all those movies + Independent Musical albums + Symphony (First Indian to do it) + countless unreleased movies. Above all he has ruled (and continues to rule) the hearts of millions of his fans. If it takes one day to compose one song, the 5000 songs would have taken approximately 14 years assuming of course that there were no holidays and every single day was a working day. Thatâ€™s an monumental achievement! In the 80s Ilayaraja was recording (not just composing) 3 songs every single day for years together. Most of the songs from that era are still in the heart of the people. Hardly a day goes by when I donâ€™t hear some composition of Ilayaraja. His music is not confined to a specific genre. In his compositions, there is something for every mood. In the video below you can see how an average fan reacts to his music:\n\nTribute to Ilayaraja â€“ Thaikkudam Bridge from Hari MK on Vimeo.\n\nAs the title of the video makes it clear, itâ€™s a tribute to Ilayarajasâ€™s music. Itâ€™s a medley of multiple compositions. Every time I watch this video, as soon as the Violin starts my eyes well up. You can see similar reaction from the audience as well. And watch what happens at 4:46. The mood changes dramatically and the audience is ready to start dancing. It wonâ€™t be a stretch if I say his music has kept us sane! One would forget whatever worries he/she might have as they get transported to a different dimension.\n\nHe did not however let those limitations of Indian Cinema confine him for too long. He started experimenting even within those confines. Here is a beautiful demonstration of his genius during his concert in Italy:\n\nThe success he achieved in the Indian Movie industry is unparalleled. When I look at the videos of those songs most of the time the picturization looks so funny and even embarrassing to watch. However the music makes it worth sitting through those comical dance moves. Invariably there are exceptions. When Ilayaraja joins with Kamal Hassan who is a genius in his own right, the results are amazing. Kamal came in as a Child actor, went on to become Choreographer, actor, director and every role that you can think of in making a movie. When such a talented artist joins a genius like Ilayaraja, the output is bigger than the sum of parts. Here is an example:\n\nMany of the directors who have worked with him have no qualms in admitting that his background music has elevated their movies to a different level. His fans everywhere are celebrating every piece of his music. Here is one such video:\n\nWhen they play the music second time, you are reminded of the scenes you saw earlier!\n\nMultiple volumes of books could be written about his music and his life. My goal is to just introduce his music to you and let you explore on your own. I would like to end the article with yet another tribute to the Maestro (few years old). I hope you will discover Ilayaraja more and enjoy his music."
