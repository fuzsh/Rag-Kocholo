        "text": "The praise showered is on the phenomenon of Ilaiyaraaja. And for those who had the opportunity to move with him closely, the admiration for the person runs ahead of that for his music. In just over a decade, Ilaiyaraaja has scored music for more than 400 films in five languages — Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi. He has been commissioned to score music for the next English venture of the Metro Film Corporation. Acknowledged as one of the best professional composers India has produced, he is rated as a musician much ahead of his time.\n\nIt might take some time to understand the changes he brought in tonal quality and sound quality. Says his former guru G. K. Venkatesh: “He is so modern and simultaneously ahead of his time. He is not one who loves his own creation or is spellbound by it. That is the secret of his success. An Ilaiyaraaja number is overshadowed only by another Ilaiyaraaja number”.\n\nThe Ilaiyaraaja story is a story of hard and dedicated work by a man of unusual gifts. Born in the little hamlet of Pannaipuram in Madurai district, Ilaiyaraaja went to school in the nearby Kombai village. When he was in the eight standard, two astrologers, Palaniswamy and Santhanam, predicted that he would not study beyond that. In 1958, he enrolled himself in Thevaram High School for the ninth standard and felt that he had disproved the prediction. But owing to certain unforeseen circumstances, Ilaiyaraaja was forced to accompany his elder brother, Paavalar Varadarajan, a propaganda musician for the undivided Communist Party of India, to give concerts.\n\nThis musical mission proved the predictions right. “Between 1958 and 1968”, he recalls in his book ‘Sangeetha Kanavugal’ (Musical Dreams), “we travelled all over Tamil Nadu. There is not a single town or village in this State which hasn’t listened to our music.” In 1968, he moved to Madras along with his other elder brother Bhaskar and younger brother Gangai Amaran (who is also now a lyricist, composer and director).\n\nDespite the nagging poverty and starvation, he pursued his musical mission. He enrolled himself as a student of Western Classical music under “Master” Dhanraj. “Master” was able to immediately spot Ilaiyaraaja’s extraordinary gift and did not accept any fee from him. It was in his master’s room in Luz, Madras, that he was initiated to the various nuances of classical music. “Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Haydn, and Brahms used to visit our lodge everyday, you know”, says Ilaiyaraaja smilingly. This training made him take up an examination of the Trinity College of Music, London, in which he emerged a gold medalist in classical guitar.\n\nThen Ilaiyaraaja joined film music director G. K. Venkatesh as his assistant. His role as an assistant was so significant that the lyricist-cum-producer Panchu Arunachalam decided to have him as the music director for “Annakkili”. Ilaiyaraaja recorded six songs for that film in folk style. And the rest is cinema history.\n\nIlaiyaraaja’s modus operandi is unique in more than one sense. He writes down the tune in the form of notations; he doesn’t hum it or play it on his harmonium. The tune seems to flow spontaneously from his head. One has not at any time seen him worked up to produce a tune. It comes so naturally and effortlessly to him that an onlooker feels that composing might be the easiest profession in the world. As he writes the tune, he writes down the orchestration to the last detail. He does not miss even a single obbligato. When he goes recording, he embellishes his work by taking on the spot decisions which are “precise and flawless”.\n\nIlaiyaraaja approaches music in a most unorthodox manner. He is not cowed down by the dogmatic rules prescribed by self-styled guardians of “pure music”. He declares: “Music is nothing but sound and there is no place for value judgement among various sounds.” He adds: “I am not a musician. For a musician, raga is a hurdle; tala is hurdle; his musical training is a hurdle. Since I am not a musician, I have no parameters to restrict myself. Whatever comes to my mind, I have no hesitation in doing it. I am able to compose a song in aarohanam alone, while the whole spectrum of music vidwans believed for centuries that a song should essentially comprise aarohanam and avarohanam. This is because I have no bonds.”\n\nHe is India’s most prolific composer, yet there is no question of his music sounding stale or repetitive. This is a function of his extraordinary versatility. Most people in the field would acknowledge that film music has become richer after his entry. Ilaiyaraaja, who has firm roots in the soil in which he was born, has made folk music popular. The respectability he brought to the simple soul-stirring folk and tribal music is much more, in terms of both quality and quantity, than the results of several festivals put together.\n\nDespite two (three, now) national awards for the best music direction and a highly acclaimed non-verbal instrumental compact disc titled “How to Name It” released internationally by Oriental Label, U.S. (the first such for an Indian film composer) to his credit, little has been written about him and his music. The reason for this is Ilaiyaraaja’s self-imposed exile from the media glare.\n\nFrontline: There are various systems in music — like Carnatic, Hindustani, Western, Tribal, and Folk. And every system has its own schools. Which system do you think is the most well developed one?\n\nIlaiyaraaja: I do not like to make these types of value judgements. The person who assumes the role of a judge should be extremely well versed in the various systems of music which he compares. A person who compares and rates Carnatic music higher than light music should know both the systems. But people who dismiss light music here do not know both the systems. Saying Hindustani is superior is superior to Carnatic, and even in Hindustani, Drupad is superior to Thumri or Kayal, Opera is superior to Symphony, sounds utter nonsense. No one knows all the systems of music thoroughly and hence no one is qualified to be a judge. But every one of passes value judgements about one music or the other. Further, to me, at a different level, all these systems and schools appear imaginary. But before going into the value judgements of other musical systems, let us have a look at the attitude of our own vidwans towards our own classical music. If a musician sings a particular number very well, with excellent sangathis in the right places and right punctuations, we don’t praise him. On the other hand, our vidwans will say: “Seventeen years ago at the Music Academy, I rendered this number in a much better manner.” For me, the past is past; I am more concerned about what you are going to do. Talking about ancient glory never makes me happy. Now I am sure that a Thyagaraja Swamigal or a Dhikshitar is not going to be reborn, for obvious reasons. They just can’t live with this generation of musicians who torture music. (laughs)"
