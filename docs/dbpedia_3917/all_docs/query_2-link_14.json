        "text": "Music maestro Ilaiyaraaja will compose music for his own biopic, featuring Dhanush in the lead role. The film's first look was launched today, March 20, in the presence of Kamal Haasan, Vetri Maaran, Gangai Amaren and Bharathiraja. The biopic will be directed by Arun Matheswaran, with cinematography by Nirav Shah.\n\nThe music for Ilaiyaraaja's biopic will be scored by the legend himself. The film was launched in the presence of industry veterans such as Kamal Haasan, Vetri Maaran, and others. Starring Dhanush, the film will go on floors soon.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHere's a photo:\n\nHere's the video:\n\nDhanush, on X, shared the first-look poster and wrote, \"Honoured @ilaiyaraaja sir (sic).\"\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Dhanush said, \"I always say 'what you think is what you become'. Most of us listen to Ilaiyaraaja's songs at night to sleep. But, I had sleepless nights thinking how I'd act like Ilaiyaraaja. I manifested it. I've always dreamt of acting in two biopics - one is Ilaiyaraaja's and one is Thalaivar Rajinikanth. And one of them is coming true. It's a matter of pride for me.\"\n\nExplaining his admiration for Ilaiyaraaja, he said, \"I'm a fan and a devotee of Ilaiyaraaja. His music is my companion and it suits everyone. More than that, his music is my acting teacher. I used to listen to a song or BGM before a scene - and his music tells me how to act in the scene. That's how I act. Vetri Maaran has seen that. Many say that it's a huge challenge and responsibility. But, I don't think so. I know his music will guide me. He's been there with me and will always be there with me.\"\n\nOn a parting note, he said, \"As an artist, it's an honour to be part of this project. I'm immensely happy that the invite came from Isaignani himself. I'm blessed.\"\n\nDhanush also had a few words of wisdom for director Arun Matheswaran, with whom, he had worked for 'Captain Miller'. \"Arun, don't take too much pressure. We should enjoy working on this biopic. I don't think we should consider this as a huge challenge, but to approach it with joy,\" he said.\n\nKamal Haasan, speaking at the event, said, \"I don't know where to begin about Ilaiyaraaja. My relationship started as a fan, then became a brother and now we are equals. I become happy whenever he achieves anything and it's same for me as well. Everyone thinks 'Kanmani Anbodu' is a love song for Guna and Abirami. But, no, it was a song for us.\"\n\nThe 'Vishwaroopam' actor said, \"Just like Dhanush said, one should enjoy the process of making a film on him. Even those who hate Ilaiyaraaja could make a film on him. Whoever makes it, he will stand tall. There are so many aspects of Ilaiyaraaja's life that can be made into films. Even if I was born after several years, I'd still listen to him, because his music will always be alive.\"\n\nHe also advised Arun saying, \"You can tell the truth of what you see. Do not get pressurised. This film is not just about Isaignani Ilaiyaraaja but about Bharat Ratna Ilaiyaraaja. It's not our wish but our demand. His music will take us places.\"\n\nThe biopic of Ilaiyaraaja will be produced by Connekkt Media, PK Prime Production and Mercuri Movies."
