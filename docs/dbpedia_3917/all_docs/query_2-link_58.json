        "text": "R Parthiban is one of the most popular Tamil filmmakers who has always put in efforts to surprise the audience with each project he takes on. His 2022 film Iravin Nizhal is regarded as the world’s first single-shot non-linear film to be released. In a career spanning several decades, the filmmaker has earned respect for his excellent and long-lasting contributions to the growth and development of Tamil cinema. Apart from directing his films, he is also an actor and has impressed the masses with his performances.\n\nRecently, during a media interaction, R Parthiban revealed that he once went to meet musical maestro Ilaiyaraaja to have him on board for one of his films. But the legend refused to be a part of it.\n\nParthiban’s career started as an assistant director to K Bhagyaraj, who was a popular director in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1989, Parthiban made his directorial debut with the film Pudhea Paadhai. At that time, he was searching for a music director. Bhagyaraj has always been a mentor for Parthiban, and he suggested that he go to Ilaiyaraaja.\n\nWhen Parthiban went there and requested the music composer to be a part of the film, Ilaiyaraaja refused straight away. This happened because Bhagyaraj had also started composing music, and this angered Ilaiyaraaja. He felt that people can’t just become musicians in one go. They need years of practice. He knew that Parthiban was sent by Bhagyaraj and, hence, refused to give music to Pudhea Paadhai. Later, the music for the film was composed by Chandrabose.\n\nPudhea Paadhai was released on April 14, 1989, and became a box-office hit, earning multiple honours, including two National Film Awards and two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. Parthiban also acted in the film as the lead. It also starred Seetha, VK Ramasamy, Manorama, and Nassar in important roles.\n\nParthiban last essayed the role of Chinna Pazhuvettaraiyar in the Ponniyin Selvan franchise, directed by Mani Ratnam. He was also seen playing an important role in Dhruva Natchathiram and the hit web series Suzhal: The Vortex."
