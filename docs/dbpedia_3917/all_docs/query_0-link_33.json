        "text": "'How to name it?' This title of Ilayaraja's 1986 fusion album strikes our mind, as we attempt to classify his work in 'Neethanae En Ponvasantham' under a specific genre.\n\nFor Ilayarajaiites it's bliss. And for non-Ilayarajaiites it's a treat. This is how the songs from 'NEP' can be described, for the maestro has drenched the listeners with his musical rain.\n\nSaayndhu Saayndhu (Yuvan Shankar Raja, Ramya NSK)\n\nThe Rajas (Ilayaraja and Yuvan Shankar Raja) have woven musical magic in 'Saayndhu Saayndhu...' The maestro, with this modern song, proves that his music is timeless. While Yuvan adds value to Ilayaraja's composition in the first half of this song, Ramya takes care of the second half.\n\nKaatrai Konjam (Karthik)\n\nThe vintage Ilayaraja is in full form in this song, which takes one back to his golden era- the 1980s. In association with Ilayaraja's tune and Na Muthukumar's lines, Karthik has struck gold, one can say.\n\nPudikale Maamu (Suraj Jagan, Karthik)\n\nA college song, 'Pudikale Maamu...' is full of energy and exuberance. Ilayaraja's USP lies in sensing the situation right and he is at it again in this number. Suraj Jagan and Karthik chip in with their best\n\nYennodu Vaa Vaa (Karthik) For those who would like to listen a song that is quite typical to Ilayaraja's heydays, here comes 'Yennodu Vaa Vaa...' The maestro's firm grip over the medium is amazing and that's the magic of Ilayaraja.\n\nPengal Yendral (Yuvan Shankar Raja)\n\nYuvan sings for his father's tune once again, this time expressing the pain of love. Though the voice is appealing and the lyrics are convincing, it's the tune and orchestration that reflects the mood well than anything else.\n\nSattru Munbu (Ramya NSK)\n\nA song that is quite contrast to the earlier one. If 'Pengal Yendral...' is about a boy's unhappiness over his girl, 'Sattru Munbu...' is about a girl's disappointment over her boy. Two things stand universal in this song- they are love and Raja's music.\n\nMudhal Murai (Sunidhi Chauhan)\n\nThe already popular line 'Neethanae En Ponvasantham' is familiarized in this song, with Ilayaraja's music and Sunidhi Chauhan's voice adding more beauty to it. Ilayaraja, known for using violin to the best possible extent, has done just that in here.\n\nVaanam Mella (Ilayaraja, Bela Shende)\n\nFinally, the 'Isaignani' himself is here to croon this song. And needless to say, it turns out to be the highlight of the album. Bela Shende has accompanied well Ilayaraja and it's a mesmerizing effect to listen Ilayaraja's voice in his own music.\n\nIt's Ilayaraja all the way in 'Neethanae En Ponvasantham', as he gives one more reason to his fans to feel proud about. Raja rules, we say."
