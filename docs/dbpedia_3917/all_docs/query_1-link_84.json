        "text": "When I watched the film back in 2012, I hated it. I felt Nithya deserved someone better than Varun, who never reciprocated the same amount of love she had for him. I also thought Raja's music got wasted. And, I went around bitching about this film to people calling it GVM's worst film.\n\nFirstly, apologies to GVM for having a negative/wrong opinion about this film. On rewatching it ten years later, I changed my view about the film: I thought this was GVM's best work so far: an epic love story with two real characters who had their own imperfections, which affected their relationship in different stages of their life. I felt Varun was immature and had difficulty communicating his…\n\nthey've managed to tell such a grounded, realistic, ugly, yet compelling romance in the most epic, larger-than-life fashion. neethaane en ponvasantham was such a powerful, fascinating watch, despite its slightly fumbled conclusion (when i say slightly, i mean i had exactly one issue with it but i still cried so it's fine).\n\ngautham vasudev menon is like tarantino (bear with me) in that his characters all just speak like he does, but his best films are able to make you believe these conversations despite their artificial nature. vaaranam aayiram really did not work for me, for this very reason - i just couldn't buy into any of it, not only did the conversations feel fake, but the progression of the…\n\nWhat a difference casting can make. This is the exact same script as Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu or very close to it, with the exact same weaknesses, but this movie is near-great while that one's deeply flawed.\n\nThe supporting cast is better almost straight down the line, but the biggest difference is Jiiva vs. Nani. Where Nani's version of the lead comes off as a Reddit incel manbaby fueled by rage and entitlement, Jiiva's feels much moodier, much more empathetic, and much more vulnerable, fueled instead by doubt and sadness. There is still a scene or two that forces him into that incel-adjacent mode--and this is a GVM problem, not a Nani or Jiiva problem, based on his other films--but thanks…\n\nWhat’s the point of forgiving if you can’t forget?\n\nDoesn’t quite have the same cinematic flourishes as VTV and the main characters are so messy, vindictive, etc. that it is absolutely no surprise to me that a lot of people really disliked this when it came out but I found the narrative in this to be more complex and fascinating and part of me wonders if this was because of Reshma Ghatala’s influence who has story and screenplay credits. I am also a huge sucker for romance movies where the main couple meet for the first time onscreen after being estranged for years. Being unraveled at the mention of a name because years of memories flash before you (good and…"
