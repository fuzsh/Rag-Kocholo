        "text": "There were reports that Samantha has sung a song in her upcoming film, Neethane En Ponvasantham, which has music by maestro Ilayaraja. But the actor has said she’s not up to crooning and is unlikely to impress her fans with her singing talent\n\nSouthern beauty Samantha is gearing up for her upcoming film Neethane En Ponvasantham. However, the actor has denied all the rumours that suggested she'd be lending her voice for the music in the film. Being directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, the project is a trilingual, being made simultaneously in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. The Tamil version has Jiiva in the lead role, the Telugu version has Nani and Hindi has Aditya Roy Kapoor. Samantha is the heroine in all three languages.\n\nThe Bana Kathadi actor posted on her blog: “Guys I am sorry. I wish it were true and that I had a hidden talent that I was going to surprise you all with. But no, I am not singing in Gautham sir's film.” Gautham and Ilayaraja were recently in London, to record the songs and background score for the movie. “Working with Ilayaraja sir is a dream come true. He is the real maestro and it was an amazing experience,” says Gautham.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nAditya Roy Kapoor back in ‘Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau’\n\n‘Dookudu’ girl Samantha aims to be No.1\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
