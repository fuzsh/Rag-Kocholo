        "text": "CHENNAI: Neethane En Ponvasantham (NEP) has already made it to the annals of Tamil cinema history even before its release. That’s because it marks the coming together of two of the brightest minds the Tamil film industry has ever produced — Isaignani Ilaiyaraja and director Gautham Vasudev Menon.\n\nTalking to City Express, director Gautham Menon said, “I’ve always wanted to work with Ilaiyaraja sir. When I was in school and college, music, for me, was defined by his work. In fact, the title of this film is itself inspired by his song. I had this idea a month ago and I met him recently. I was a little nervous but the meeting went off beautifully. He was so patient and heard me out. I’ve already completed 60 percent of the movie which I screened for him. He liked it and agreed to compose the music. He is to begin work from today.”\n\nNo doubt, the director is living a dream and he seems to have recorded it on Twitter as well. “Oh that,” he says with a smile, “is because people were posting all sorts of messages, posing as me. I was advised by friends to begin an account to keep people posted about the truth.”"
