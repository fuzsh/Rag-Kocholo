        "text": "Mouna Ragam is a 1986 Indian Tamil romantic drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam, and produced by G. Venkateswaran. The film narrates the life of Divya Chandramouli, who is robbed of her carefree existence when she reluctantly marries Chandrakumar. Divya does not wish for a married life due to her grief over her former lover, Manohar, being shot to death. The rest of the story follows Divya's inner conflict between holding on to her past or coming to terms with the present and uniting with Chandrakumar. Mouna Ragam's development began when Ratnam wrote a short story titled Divya, while he was making his debut film Pallavi Anu Pallavi. As the script developed he renamed it. He did not plan to film until he finished writing the story, but he could not start actual production on it until after his fourth film, Idaya Kovil, was released. Mouna Ragam was mostly filmed in Chennai; additional filming took place in Delhi and Agra. The soundtrack album and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, cinematography was handled by P. C. Sreeram, and the art director was Thotta Tharani. The length of the film was 3,987 metres.\n\nNinaivellam Nithya is a 1982 Indian Tamil romance film directed by Tamil C. V. Sridhar. It brings to the limelight the true love that blossoms between two hearts without discriminating against caste and/or creed. The true love even sacrifices itself for the benefit of the beloved. The true love ensures the hearts unite beyond the mundane life without giving into the crazy worldly threats. This film brings out the true love beyond any infatuations and/or physical attractions. The lovers decide that they desist from any physical relationships until united through marriage though they live in the same place together.The life of lovers ended in a sorrow phase"
