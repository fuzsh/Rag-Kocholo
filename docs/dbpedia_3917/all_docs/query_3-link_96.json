What they say about Ilayaraja.\n\nTopic started by Raj (@ 203.124.234.166) on Wed Nov 27 01:19:19 EST 2002.\n\nAll times in EST +10:30 for IST.\n\nHi All, Music Lovers and Music Maestro Ilayaraja Fans, I am a die hard A R Rahman fan, but I thought I should share this article, which I found in a website. Please read and dont' fight, please have a healthy arguement: http://ilaiyaraaja_ragam.tripod.com/ilaiyaragam/id7.html\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT THEY SAID ABOUT ILAIYARAAJA.....\n\nSRI JAYENDRA SARASWATHI SWAMIGAL (Spiritual Guru, India),\" Ilaiyaraja has plans to bring about good changes in the society, through his music. His music is capable of putting the mind at peace and serenity.\"\n\nSEMANGUDI SRINIVASA AYYAR (Eminent Carnatic Vocalist, India) - \" Raja has that unique gift to please common man and carnatic experts alike.Until recently, I knew that Shri Ilayaraaja is a great film music director - his expertise in diluting Carnatic Ragas without diluting their native merits, is well known to me - but recently I had the oppurtunity to listen to him sing a few kirthanas - he sang a kirthana in Raag Abhogi - very well rendered - in Carnatic Sangeet, one needs to know the Sahityam - without knowing it, one should not sing it making it sound absurd - Isai gyani Shri.Ilayaraaja sang it very beautifully and his grasp of the Sahityam is commendable. After today, I realise that Shri.Ilayaraaja is a thorough expert in Carnatic music. May the God Almighty bless Isai Gyani with a long life so that he can render a long service to music \"\n\nLARY BAIN( England Based Composer)-\"He is unbelievable, genius and fantastic\"\n\nLALGUDI JAYARAMAN (Eminent Musician, India) - \" His talent is not the fruit of one single birth's efforts. This level of achievement is only possible to one who has lived with music for countless births. The speed with which he writes notations have always baffled me \"\n\nDr.BALAMURALIKRISHNA (Eminent Carnatic Vocalist, India) -\" As far as i am concerned, i would say Ilaiyaraja is the composer of the century. If there is one single authority on 'orchestration' it can only be ilaiyaraja.\n\nK.J.YESUDASS (Eminent Film/Carnatic Vocalist, India) - \"There are infinite music forms hidden in his heart. All that should flow-out for the good of mankind.\"\n\nVAALI (South Indian Lyricist/Poet, India) - \" Reethigowlai, Hamsanatham, Bilahari etc are some of the ragas that he has deftly handled for film music. He is not isaignani, he is swaragnani.\"\n\nZUBIN MEHTA (Music Conductor, Israel Philharmonic)- \" I was bewildered after listening to his 'nothing but wind' and 'how to name it'. He belongs to the 21st century and perhaps beyond.\"\n\nJOSEPH EAGER, (Conductor, World Symphony Orchestra, USA )-\"His music will be heard through the twenty-first century\" predicted at a function to release the CD of his album Nothing But Wind in New York in 1988.\n\nVICTOR RANGEL RIBEIRO,( musicologist and author of Baroque Music, USA ) - \"Your ears will hear music like they never heard before\"\n\nSTEPHEN DAVIS (of New Age, USA) - \"He is leading us to a very special world of music appreciation and has opened doors of new horizons of new age music\"\n\nSHERYAR OOKERJEE,( a Mumbai based musicologist, India) - ,\"Bach's influence is deep and all pervasive in his music. He is adept at using conventional western harmony and standard western techniques. Uses dialogue and imitation extensively. He has a competent grasp of the orchestra. His conspicuous quality is his ability to so integrate the Indian and western idioms that the seams can hardly be noticed and the result is usually pleasant, charming and satisfying. Ilaiyaraaja's music is enjoyable and worth taking very seriously. It grows on one with repeated hearings\".\n\nLASLOV KOVACH,(Conductor, Budapest Symphony Orchestra, Hungary) - ,\"He is Hollywood Kind. A very special composer. It seems he does not have to think at all to create music. Music just flows out .\"\n\nRAJKUMAR SANTOSHI (Noted Film Maker, India ) (on Background music by Maestro Ilaiyaraja for his film Lajja) - ,\"The discipline of the 90 musicians, the conductor and the recording engineers of the Budapest Symphony Orchestra in Hungary was overwhelming. The musicians gave a standing ovation after recording the scores written by Ilaiyaraja.\"\n\nMARK LAYCOCK, (Director of Orchestral Activities, Iowa State University, Iowa, United States of America) - ,\"A fascinating blend of Eastern and Western styles. The music is instantly appealing -- rhythmically, harmonically, formally. The use of traditional Indian instruments in a modern musical context makes for a rich palette of tone colors and creates a wide range of expressive possibilities.\"\n\nNAUSHAD ALI (doyen of hindi film music, India)- ,\"That this man has achieved is 100 times more than what any of us have achieved; only time can tell the quantum of his achievements.\"\n\nHARIPRASAD CHAURASIA, (exponent of Hindustani Classical Music, India) - ,\" It is a treat watching him (Mr.Ilayaraaja) work - he does everything, composing, arrangement of instruments, orchestration and conducting - that too without the help of any assistants and a stopwatch.\"\n\nL.SUBRAMANIAM (Violin Maestro, India)-,\"Ilayaraaja is as good as any composer in the world.\"\n\nSUDHA RAGUNATHAN (Eminent Carnatic Vocalist, India ),\" Yesterday, today or tommorrow, ilaiyaraaja will remain the unquestionable emperor of music...Period !!!!.\"\n\nMADHAN (Noted Cartoonist, Writer, film critic, India ) - ,\" As far as i am concerened, Ilayaraaja is the best bet when it comes to background music. He seems to fully understand as to what the film's situation demands and what impact should his music create in viewer's mind. More often, the usage of silent passages in his background music is more stunning than the music itself, and he creates the right mood every time. Amazing is the word.!! \"\n\nR.V.UDAIYAKUMAR (Noted Film Maker, India) - \"He was writing the background score for one of my films. In a particular scene i had made a very glaring error in designing the flow of shots. I told him that i have made a mistake in choosing the shots. He simply said - I just now corrected your mistake with the BGM...Listen to this !!\"\n\nPAARTHIBAN (Noted Film Maker, Actor, India) - \"Music alias ilaiyaraja, ilaiyaraj alias Music.\"\n\nKAMALHAASAN (Noted Actor, Film Maker, India) - \",Ilaiyaraja should be honored as Isai Vigyani (musical scientist) rather than Isai gyani.He has explored and analyzed virtually every type of music.I have worked with several composers. But this man is on his own trip - he is a colossal talent. We have worked together in around 70 films and we know each other's requirements and expectations very well. He saw the rushes of the film (Hey Ram!) just once and immediately decided the music to be scored for the song sequences that have already been picturised. I told my film crew to give me a week's time and that I will come back with one song in that time - instead I came back with seven songs.\"\n\nHARIHARAN,( Playback Singer, India),\"Ilaiyaraja's style is very different. He has been heavily influenced by the classical compositions of Mozart and Bach.\"\n\nCHANDRAHASAN,( Film Producer, India),\" His music is precious. Mere dishing out of money wont get you such quality music.\"\n\nA.R.REHMAN ( Music Composer, India),\" He is a genius by himself and is completely self-contained. \"\n\nKARTHIK RAJA ( Music Composer, India),\" He has composed in so many idioms, his work spans such a wide spectrum that there will always some resemblance to something he has already done.\"\n\nUTTAM SINGH (Music Composer, India) - \"Ilaiyaraaja is perhaps the only complete music composer in India.\"\n\nSUHASINI MANIRATNAM (Eminent Actress, India),\" Show me a composition matching legendary compositions like 'shenbagame shenbagame' & 'panivizhum malar vanam' by ilaiyaraja. Only then can you talk of someone overtaking him.\"\n\nTHANGAR BACHAAN (Cinematographer, Film Maker, India),\" Once I finish shooting my film, i just place it before ilaiyaraja, and from there on whatever he delivers is music. I dont need to worry about it anymore. I shudder to even think about Indian film music without ilaiyaraaja. \"\n\nVAMSY (Noted Film Maker, India) - \"While picturizing a song, iIaiyaraja's tunes inspire me more than the characters of the film themselves.\"\n\nBHARATHIRAAJA (Noted Film Maker, India) - \" I shoot scenes with a particular impact in mind. And even before i discuss about what i have in mind, he is already ready with mind boggling BGM bits.\"\n\nMANIRATNAM (Noted Film Maker, India) - \"Ilaiyaraja is absolutely prolific. He is an amazing talent who believes that the music written down by him should be stuck to totally. And then it is recorded which is just a matter of execution. I wish I could be like Ilaiyaraja and work out everything on paper.\"\n\nLinks:\n\nhttp://www.raajangahm.com - The official website of Ilaiyaraaja.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ilaiyaraaja/\n\nResponses:\n\nOld responses\n\nFrom: AYILUR RAMANATH (@ ) on: Sat Nov 1 03:57:13 EST 2003\n\nthe one and only one in the centuary.\n\nFrom: strummer (@ 202.9.168.159) on: Mon Nov 3 04:06:31 EST 2003\n\nI AM A MALAYALEE. but i enjoy tamil film music and knows as much about TFM as an average tamil guy knows. i am a great fan of SPB, TMS, AM Raja , KJY (in tamil) and the composers MSV, RMoorthy (the pair), MAHDevan, Pukazhendi, DAKSMoorthy, Ilayaraja and ARR.\n\n.\n\ni find it surprising that some ARR fans want to run down IR, by comparing him with ARR. to me, it is too early to compare ARR with IR. IR has already topped the pinacle of creativity, and is incomparable, truely non-pareil, not only in tamil, but in any indian language. ARR has shown flashes of brilliance, but many of those nice tunes we listened to has already faded, and would not go into a collector's bag of nostalgia, say 10 years hence.\n\n.\n\ni can faintly discern the echo (not influence) of some famous western songs in the BGM, and in the tunes of ARR. ARR's creativity has somehow reached a dead-end, and he keeps re-inventing (literally) himself, despite his protestations to the contrary in various interviews. the songs lack unity/harmony and easily slip out of ones memory. if we keep aside our inferiority complex which makes us rush to appreciate anything the West takes a fancy to (in this case ARR's music), our objectivity would tell us that ARR has to go a long way, and re-discover the creativity he displayed in Roja and a few of his earlier efforts, to aspire to be where IR is.\n\n.\n\nI find it strange that a number of Tamilians speak ill of Ilayaraja - a creator who happens in a thousand years, an apogee of originality, a true representative of the natural dravidian genius - whereas in malayalam (where he has composed for only a select few films) he is considered as an incomparable maker of music. we Malayalees like ARR too, but consider IR something special. non pareil.\n\n.\n\nstrummer\n\nFrom: strummer (@ 202.9.168.159) on: Mon Nov 3 04:21:28 EST 2003\n\nJust now i read an interview by ARR on his Lord of the Rings. i wish him all the best, and am proud of the recognition a fellow indian receives.\n\n.\n\nBut, my sense of objectivity makes me stand by what i wrote above. my fervent wish is ARR be not simply great, but as great as IR.\n\n.\n\nstrummer\n\nFrom: JK (@ 61.11.80.128) on: Fri Nov 7 04:27:07 EST 2003\n\nStrummer!\n\nWell said abt raja\n\nList all pages of this thread Back to the Forum\n\nPost comments"
