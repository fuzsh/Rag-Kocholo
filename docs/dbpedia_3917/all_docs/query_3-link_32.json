        "text": "Dear all,\n\nThis is AKBAR BASHA S, from Chennai.\n\nI do not know anything about music - technically.\n\nI do not know what is Indian Classical or Westren Classical or any form of music.\n\nSince, This is about Ilaiyaraaja. I do involve.\n\nIndeed, I do not know about RaviShankar or Zubin Metha, etc,.\n\nI was only exposed to film music. Dominant in South India is Ilaiyaraaja.\n\nHE is the only composer who writes scores using pen and paper only. He does not require a key board or any such musical instruments to write the score.\n\nhere I would like to higlight one thing - THE SPEED OF WRITING NOTES. THough I do not know ABC of music, I can say that no one can write such great and precise music score at the speed of Ilaiyaraaja. Such a confidence is provided for me, so people with great musical knowledge will very appreciate his highly expressive music.\n\nHis music is simple but nice & high-level music. Simple in sense everyone can understand easily.\n\nALso I need to mention about the FLOW - the musical notes to flow very fleuntly than any other fliud in nature.\n\nAbout music recently Ilaiyaraaja said that - music does not belong any place - if you talk about tones, it comes to frequencies and it is above the surface - once it comes to frequencies - you cannot find differences in music. This you can realise if listen for instance \"Polla Vinayen\" of \"Thiruvasagam - a symphonic oratoria - by Ilaiyaraaja\".\n\nThis I realised very long ago by listening to his film compositions.\n\nI would like add my experience of listening that Polla Vinayen for the first time.\n\n'I was not able to listen to lyrics or verses either in Tamil or English (due to my concentration on the orchestral sounds). I listened only the tune or melody (not technically) along with the orchestral backing. I started moving to music. I given myself completely to the notes. Tears came out of my eyes - they dried by the music itself. This kind of tears coming out and drying up, repeated for througout the song. At one stage I felt I am at very new place. I can only name that palce as eternal world. I felt the presence of God very close to me in the form of light-rays ( I cannot explain completely as this experience is sub-consious - only I write what I could retrive).\n\nYes, I saw GOD. This is really true feeling not anything else. Later only I heard the feeling of \"Balamurali Krishna - a great musician - master of Ilaiyaraaja also\", which completely coincided with my feelings.\n\nThis kind music is written by this simple Indian born homosapien.\n\nThis lfetime will not suffice to listen or explore his musical scores. But he has done all this with very schooling and other facilities.\n\nThanking You,\n\nYours,\n\nAKBAR BASHA S\n\nDear All,\n\nTo write about Ilaiyaraaja's music, this lifetime, is not enough.\n\nI do not know anything about music, kindly help me to learn about process of musical communication.\n\nBut, only I read about, the analogy between music and painting as Tone-painting, the analogy between music and architecture as \"stones in space whereas tones in time\" and the analogy between music and literature. And also heard about the metaphors used in music.\n\nNever realised all these things completely.\n\nOnly, I may understand a bit while I listen to Ilaiyaraaja. But, I feel much of those elements are there in his music.\n\nAnyhow I do move to music very well and I can realise so many things about the expressive quality of music.\n\nYes, I am a baby. Without any language of speech or music, the baby can communicate/express its feelings. Of course baby's communication is a kind of music.\n\nIlaiyaraaja has also said dogs do bark with different ragas (scales) depending on their mood.\n\nIlaiyaraaja's music is for all life-forms not only for rational beings.\n\nI do feel with music we can communicate to all kind of species in the universe (not only with human beings).\n\nAKBAR BASHA S"
