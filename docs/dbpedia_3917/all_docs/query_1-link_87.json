When we all thought that the film would be a bilingual with Raam playing the lead role in the Telugu version, it is now said that the film will also be made in Hindi simultaneously. According to sources, Aditya Roy Kapur (of Guzaarish fame) will play the lead role in the Hindi version while Samantha is likely to be the leading lady in all the three versions. RS Infotainment, the makers of the highly successful Ko is producing the Tamil version. Another added attraction for the movie is its music which will be created by Oscar winning composer A.R. Rahman! The movie, touted to be a romantic comedy, has been planned for release on February 14th 2012, as a gift for all lovers on Valentine's day! The highlight of the movie is that Gautham Menon is returning to comedy after a long while since Minnalae. Comedian Santhanam will also play a prominent role in the film. Promotional posters of the movie (with Jiiva with a new makeover as an engineering student and the beautiful Samantha as a psychology student) have now become the talk of the town!"
