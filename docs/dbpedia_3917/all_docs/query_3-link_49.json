According to Achille Forler, board member of the Indian Performing Right Society, the kind of stellar body of work that Ilaiyaraaja has created in the last 40 years should have placed him among the world's Top 10 richest composers, somewhere between Andrew Lloyd Webber ($1.2 billion) and Mick Jagger (over $300 million).Ilaiyaraaja is nicknamed Isaignani (The musical genius in English) and often referred as Maestro, the prestigious title conferred by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London.
