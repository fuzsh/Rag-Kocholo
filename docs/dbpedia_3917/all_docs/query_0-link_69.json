        "text": "Munnpaniya is one of my favorite YSR songs, and only today I realized the similarity after reading your article. I like YSR‚Äôs background score especially when he knows to apply, ‚Äúless is more approach‚Äù. I especially liked Peranbu and Super Delux(the various placement of nostalgia-inducing old songs into the mix).\n\nThe following comment perhaps belongs in another article, but while we are on Raja, thought would add here.. I am a huge Raja fan, but only in the last 15 years had the exposure to the classical music, especially symphonies and attending live classical/Baroque concerts and realized how much Raja has drawn influences from that era, sometimes even the melodic line is derived from. For eg: the song Chittu Kuruvi from the movie Chinna Veedu, will sound a lot similar to Symphony No. 9\n\nor take ABC Neevaasi from Bizet\n\nEvery composer has inspirations and influences, and how they adapt it to the local culture and make it their own is what that matters.. I always felt Raja married yesappattu with mozart so effortlessly, and made classical pieces approachable by a common man. So if Yuvan has inherited a silver tune, and has a DNA transfer, all the power to him to take some of his father‚Äôs template and introduce it to the next gen all the while being careful to imbibe his own sensibilities into the composition üôÇ\n\nGave it a couple of days but as nobody else has chimed in about Yuvan, I will pick up the thread from vivaciously yours‚Äô comment.\n\nGetting influenced by Western classical wasn‚Äôt what made Raja so unique. Everybody was getting influenced by it from at least the 1950s. On the lines of Chittukuruvi-Mozart, Salil da also borrowed from Mozart for the melody of Itna Na Mujhse Tu Pyar Bada. Naushad also listened to a lot of western classical. RD was into stuff like bossa nova iirc.\n\nWhat made Raja‚Äôs work so distinct while still operating very much within the conventional film song format (where Rahman tried to change the format itself often times to get to where he wanted) is how AUTHENTIC were the Western parts that he was writing. And not just the writing but that he got the musicians to play in a Western manner for the first time.\n\nIt‚Äôs not easy to perceive that difference until you have yourself heard a lot of Western music and not just classical but the multitude of genres like rock, funk, soul, jazz etc.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Raja understood for instance that drums in Western music can and often are played very fast without ever sounding LOUD. This is anathema to the way we use percussion. Because our percussion instruments (except molam which is inherently quite loud) are played by the fingers, the moment you ratchet up the tempo, the volume also goes up at least a little. There is less dynamic range, if you will. This gets transposed to the way our local musicians often play western percussion too. And further to an erroneous notion that using lots of instruments in Western means lots of cacophonous noise, that is that everyone should play together and raise the volume to deafening levels.\n\nThese are the things Raja changed. He gave the music so much space to breathe. People talk about how many different instruments he uses but nobody mentions the spaces where there is either silence or very few instruments/soft sections. He is masterfully orchestrating the building up and releasing of tension which is the very essence of Western music, at least from a modern classical/blues/rock perspective. And his listening, his preferences in Western clearly weren‚Äôt cliche and straight up but extended into the obscure and the arcane (which he somehow always found a way to make over into something accessible for a Tamil/Telugu audience).\n\nTake the section from 5:54 running for a minute or so, it fascinates me more that he knew about such music in the first place because Hindi as well as Tamil seemed then to be stuck in disco or bad copies of rock, blissfully unaware of these beautiful syncopated beats and grooves:\n\nNotice here too how gentle the drumming actually is even though it‚Äôs a busy pattern. That was a hallmark of a lot of 70s rock/funk/fusion etc. Raja did not judge it as hippie/drugged/countercultural/degenerate, he just heard something he liked and used it.\n\nThe greatness of Raja‚Äôs work does not lie so much in the mechanics. He could write straight fair copy at impossible speeds and do forty films a year and still have been making crap. He could know how to write counterpoint and still make very garish music, say something like the noisier, over-orchestrated numbers of Shankar Jaikishan (A Gale Lag Ja prelude is exhibit A).\n\nThe brilliance lies in how well he understood how these pieces fit. These pieces being pieces that had never been brought before together in many cases. He made juxtapositions sound like marriages because his sense of taste was so finely refined‚Ä¶without going all the way into high art snobbery and always being grounded in an endearing earthiness.\n\nAnd the thing I said about his openness to arcane stuff, this is what I still don‚Äôt get from Yuvan or even Rahman and maybe very occasionally from Santosh Narayanan. The arrangements are fine and very professionally done, far be it for me as an amateur to sneer at them. Why, on Taare Ginn, Rahman showed that working within well defined conventional boundaries, he can orchestrate a song to the same standards as Raja.\n\nIt‚Äôs the choices that sound, for want of a better word, boring, at least to me. The most exciting thing they are able to appropriate is hip-hop and I like it when they go there. But all this daring, ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô rebellious music, it‚Äôs as if it never existed when I listen to their music. Of course, it‚Äôs all subjective‚Ä¶"
