        "text": "Ilaiyaraaja is among the most reputed music composers in the country with over 7,000 songs to his credit.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nActor Dhanush will play the lead role in the biopic of Tamil music maestro Ilaiyaraaja. The makers have also unveiled the official poster of the highly anticipated biopic in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, in the presence of Kamal Haasan, Vetri Maaran, Gangai Amaren, and Bharathiraja.\n\nThe film, titled Ilaiyaraaja, will be directed by Arun Matheswaran, while Nirav Shah will handle the cinematography. Ilaiyaraaja will score music for the film, which will be produced under the banners of Connekkt Media, PK Prime Production, and Mercuri Movie.\n\nThe news was made official by Dhanush, who shared the official poster on X (formerly Twitter). In the poster, a young boy is seen with what appears to be a harmonium hanging from his shoulder, ready to take on the whole world. The poster also gave off a feeling of old Chennai, which was previously known as Madras. Sharing the poster, Dhanush wrote that he was honoured to be playing the role of Ilaiyaraaja in a film. See the poster below:\n\nWhile unveiling the poster for the film, Dhanush also interacted with the media and said, “I'm a fan and a devotee of Ilaiyaraaja. His music is my companion, and it suits everyone. More than that, his music is my acting teacher. I used to listen to a song or BGM before a scene - and his music tells me how to act in the scene. That's how I act. Vetri Maaran has seen that. Many say that it's a huge challenge and responsibility. But I don't think so. I know his music will guide me. He's been there with me and will always be there with me.” The actor also mentioned that he manifested this, adding he always wanted to play the role of Ilaiyaraaja in a film.\n\nWho is Ilaiyaraaja?\n\nTalking about music maestro Ilaiyaraaja's achievements, he is among the most reputed music composers in the country with over 7,000 songs to his credit. He has composed music for over 1,000 films. In a career spanning almost five decades, Ilaiyaraaja has received five National Film Awards: three for Best Music Direction and two for Best Background Score. Apart from that, in 2012, he was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest Indian recognition given to practising artists, for his creative and experimental works in the field of music.\n\nIn 2010, he was awarded a Padma Bhushan, which is the third highest civilian honour in the country, and a Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award by the government of India, in 2018.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
