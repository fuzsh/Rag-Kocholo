        "text": "This is the concluding part of my Ilayaraja v/s Rahman series (you can read pt3, pt4 and pt5 here). And yes, there are similarities!\n\nTo understand what, how and why, we need to look beyond the sound (which is very different) and at their fundamental strengths, the tools they are able to employ. And while many of these strengths too differ, and often radically as I have written about in the previous instalments, there are some interesting similarities. These similarities serve to highlight how they could together fundamentally change film music.\n\nAnd to understand why they changed it together (rather than Rahman acting alone, as some of his diehard fans may believe), we need to acknowledge that an Ilayaraja had to happen for a Rahman to be possible. That is, Rahman couldn’t have suddenly sprung up in a MSV/RD Burman dominated scene. The modernization or rather Westernisation that Raja had already carried out paved the way for Rahman. And this gets us to the similarities:\n\nAn equally active Western half as the Indian half: I have written about this before in my post on why Ilayaraja is underrated. Basically, Ilayaraja was the first film music composer who thought as much about not just what chords or riffs he wanted to use but also modes, counterpoint, etc, as he thought about how he wanted to devise the Indian melody. So…a Kannan Vanthu Paadugindran is as much about the lovely Indian melody as it is about the brilliant, baroque-meets-funk/jazz arrangements. Rahman carried this forward. A Kadhal Sadugudu is really about the bassline motif. You cannot imagine the melody without it. And that’s a very Western way of writing music, where previously our composers devised a self sufficient Indian melody and looked at arrangements as more of a way to enhance or decorate the song. In Ilayaraja and Rahman’s music, ‘arrangements’ don’t exist as an outside element (indeed one devised by a specialist arranger) but as an integral and inseparable part of the composition.\n\nThoughtful and uncluttered arrangements: Following from the above, because both have a strong vision and command over arrangements, they can use just as many or as few instruments as they need. Because, again, they are writing parts and not shooting for a general sound. It is deeply ironic here that one Mani Ratnam comment about clutter gets thrown about to malign Ilayaraja’s command over arrangements and to spread the canard that he drowns every song with a sea of violins. Because, if anything, he represented a clean break from the era of a 100 violins amounting to little more than shrill wallpaper (and with due respect to LP, Tere Mere Beech Mein with its shrill string sections is the posterboy of this phenomenon). RD Burman himself acknowledged this when he was composing the music for the Hindi remake of Sigappu Rojakkal and Ilayaraja demonstrated why he didn’t need a 100 violins to get the sound he desired (and in fact, a LOT of the original Tamil movie’s background score is not violin driven at all). Which brings me to the next point…\n\nDriving music through keyboard or guitar licks: In popular Western music, songs have been driven by/constructed around keyboard/guitar licks for the last 70 years or so. This was a break from the manner in which classical compositions were harmonized. These keyboard/guitar licks became the backbone of the songs. Both Raja and Rahman can write songs from the ground up starting with such licks. That is, they don’t NEED a huge orchestra though they know what to do with one, if given the opportunity.\n\nSupreme open-mindedness and willingness to experiment: In terms of their willingness to experiment, both Raja and Rahman surpassed everyone before them and only RD Burman could at least be said to share the same eagerness to experiment. But Burman fell into certain patterns by the mid 70s while Raja and Rahman were more successful in avoiding predictability.\n\nPromoting new singers: Rahman is the one we think of in terms of encouraging a plethora of new singers and indeed singing styles that were hitherto unthinkable in film music. But Raja did make efforts in that direction, both in a rustic mould and in Westernised settings. Raja’s own singing style would have been considered a misfit in any prior era of film music but it became hugely popular. He also used Malaysia Vasudevan extensively, especially in rural songs. On the Western ‘front’, check out songs like Darling I Love You or Baby. Or the Sharon Prabhakar-rendered You Are My Dream. Yes! Sharon Prabhakar sang for Ilayaraja. Also Latha Rajnikath sang on Netru Indha Neram. So while, unlike Rahman, he always gave the majority of his songs to a few singers, he had already begun dabbling with more unconventional voices and styles. And perhaps, if it had met with the same kind of success that Rahman’s experiments obtained, he would have gone further down that road too. Once again, RD Burman too made efforts to introduce new styles of singing though I understand that at times, the Mangeshkar sisters put paid to such efforts when it came to female singers!\n\nThere may be further similarities but I am stopping here. These are the essentials. They sum up why discerning listeners can sense something different about Ilayaraja’s arrangements that separates him from his predecessors (while Rahman is, of course, different in very apparent ways).\n\nNow, where do I land then? What is my gun-to-the-head choice? Or whose albums would I want in my ‘desert island collection’?\n\nBefore I spell it out, let me say that I don’t really believe in this concept. I don’t believe you have to choose one. And after all, my own musical preferences are hardly restricted to film music. When I have the choice of going from Fiona Apple to Joni Mitchell to Kate Bush (and that’s just three well known female songwriters in the West), why should I be obsessed about choosing just one between Ilayaraja and Rahman?\n\nBut if I had to…well, the answer is Ilayaraja. But why? Let me try to explain my preferences. I believe it is not interesting to either simply say “my tastes” or to try to force through one’s preferences as an objective fact. There is no right or wrong about this, but it is also not random.\n\nSo…to explain why I choose Ilayaraja, I have to go back to a quality of his music that I have covered in this series here and there as well in many of my writings on his music…and a quality that imo not many Rahman fans (the ones who aren’t also huge Raja fans) perceive in his music. Uncanniness.\n\nI have come to realize that my tastes in music have gravitated more and more towards the uncanny. The element of surprise, as Shere Khan puts it in Jungle Book. I like music to surprise me, jolt me as long as the surprises aren’t random and reveal instead a masterful hand at the wheel.\n\nWhen I consider this, it explains why even though I grew up on old Hindi film music and still love it very dearly, I don’t often return to it. When I do on occasion play those songs (as I did with a mini Asha-O P Nayyar run the other day), I love them as much as I used to. But those occasions don’t make me want to dive back into that era for days anymore.\n\nIt explains why I generally prefer jazz to classical and within that, more vigorous jazz rather than staid and (usually) vocal-oriented jazz. In classical too, I prefer the stuff starting from later Beethoven and going in a progressively darker and darker direction via Mahler, Shostakovich, Stravinsky etc.\n\nI also prefer Jeff Buckley’s violently cathartic, while still extremely melodic, songs like Grace or Forget Her to the bards like Dylan, Van Morrison or Leonard Cohen.\n\nAnd Ilayaraja loves that element of surprise. He may not take you to an extreme as explosive as the coda of Grace, but his music is full of tension. Take for instance the first interlude of Oru Kadhal Enbadhu (in case you check the official credits and find yourself confused, Gangai Amaran acknowledged on TV that it was an unused composition of Ilayaraja which he had been allowed to use for his film). I love how the flutes build up to a darker string passage. That shift sends shivers down my spine in the nicest sense of the phrase. That passage only lasts a few seconds but even as I write this, I can feel it vividly, like the first time I heard it.\n\nI find that as I grow older, it’s that building up and release of tension that leaves the greatest impact on me. It could be in very old-school music (and Oru Kadhal could be called that) or it could be Radiohead’s brilliant Decks Dark from 2016 or, for a more violent example, Bent Knee’s Being Human. But those cathartic moments stay with me for a long, long time. And there’s tons of such moments in Raja’s music. The wailing saxophone solo played on a fast tempo in Eduta Neeve is another. Or even the discordant string section that kicks off the first interlude in Priyatama Na Hridayama.\n\nAnd…I have to say, as someone who was there on the Rahman journey going back to 1993 and who loves his music deeply, that I don’t often get that from Rahman. I get gorgeous beauty and I get surprises that dazzle. But it seems to me that Rahman is more interested in bedazzling me than in stunning me. Unless I somehow score a tete-a-tete with him (make it happen, universe!), I cannot find out what’s on his mind, what he likes in his compositions. And perhaps not even then, as he may not want to reveal the innermost of his workings. But it does lead me to wonder if he is somewhere even uncomfortable with uncanniness in music. He likes to sweep you off the floor with the sheer, mindblowing creativity of his music, he likes to kick ass too, but maybe he still wants to do it all in the neat and organized way that is very much his wont.\n\nI said early in this series that Rahman is always in control and everything is where it should be in his music. But maybe, that quality is not so important to me anymore. And maybe that lends a notion of predictability too. Not predictable in the way that Talat Mahmood songs (and I do love his songs very much, mind you) would be if you listened to too many in a row. But predictable in the sense that I know even his surprises go only so far but no further. Maybe even in my childhood and teenhood, I subconsciously sensed this even if I couldn’t have put a finger on it then.\n\nSo…what was absolutely stunning on Ooh La La was already nice and easy by the time I got to Pachchai Nirame. I am talking about the money note he deploys on both songs. On Ooh La La, it’s a big fat exclamation mark arriving when the song has already built up to a crescendo. On Pachchai Nirame, it’s more subtle and gentle, slipped in through an interlude and resolving back to the original key (actually, I am not even sure if he changes the key at all but the effect is akin to a money note). But that subtleness also makes it maybe too pat. Not to say that it makes it bad, just that it doesn’t tingle my nerves. For what it’s worth, the reason I don’t dig Raja’s 90s and later work as much as his 80s work is also because he began to move away from the subversiveness that I found most appealing in his music.\n\nIn that sense, in a roundabout way, Rahman is much more like the Hindi oldies/MSV. It’s immensely satisfying when I do listen to my favourite Rahman songs as it is when I listen to old Hindi numbers or to, variously, Unnai Ondru Ketpen, Nilave Ennidam or Ilakanam Maarutho. But if it doesn’t transcend and have a visceral impact on me, where even my body seems to respond involuntarily to the music, it doesn’t beg me to get lost in that world again.\n\nAnd that’s why, as long as I crave that uncanny element in music, I will always prefer Raja."
