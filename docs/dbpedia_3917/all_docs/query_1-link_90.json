        "text": "Gautham vasudev meson is back in his comfortable forte-“An intense Romantic film”. Bad Reviews kept me away for a while but still I wanted to watch the movie only for “Illayaraja” who has given wonderful songs and GVM is one film maker who gives utmost importance for music. So I thought even if everything goes wrong, at least it will offer a musical treat. But much to my surprise, the movie worked for me exemplarily. I felt every bit of movie sensible and entertaining\n\nThe story is very simple which we have seen for ages. A boy and girl falling in love and later getting separated because of ego but GVM scores here with the presentation. He hasn’t created larger than life sequences. He has kept all the proceedings subtle and non dramatic with a realistic feel. Hero belongs to a middle class family and Heroine belongs to a rich family. Unlike other movies, he hasn’t brought neither the economic conditions of the family nor the problems created by parents. He has used to showcase the mindset and lifestyle differences of both the lead actors. The girl is madly in love with the boy. She doesn’t have any problems (thanks to her family’s economic condition) and want to spend the entire time with him whereas hero has got responsibilities, since his family members are dependent on him. He is under the pressure of need of a job and career path. So though he loves the girl equally, he couldn’t spent long hours with her. These differences result in verbal fights which in turn results in ego and possessiveness which ultimately leads to breakup.GVM also doesn’t blame anyone instead he has just shown both have shortcomings which result in problems.\n\nJilva though did his job well was average when it comes to body language and expressions. On the other hand, Samantha has given a spellbinding performance. She is charming and carries the character in an ease. Santhanam as usual brings the house done with his one liners but VTV spoof was unnecessary. Every character has been written in a simplistic way which anyone can relate easily.\n\nComparing to GVM’s previous movies, camera work is a letdown but still it is commendable. Instead of Background music, GVM has used songs. Illayaraja, an expert of conveying emotions through music has done a pretty neat job. Every song of him gels with the situation perfectly. GVM just wants his audience to buy his taste. There are so much of sparkling moments in the movie which can be created only if the filmmaker has a taste and no doubt GVM has it\n\nOverall NEPV turns out to be an excellent movie which can be enjoyed if you have patience and a relaxed mindset. The more you get immersed into the movie the more you enjoy it."
