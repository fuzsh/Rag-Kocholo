        "text": "Modes - Musical modes organize the distinct tonalities present within the sequence of notes in any parent scale. Modes in music are scale-like patterns that can begin on any note of the scale, not just the root. Every note in the parent scale holds its own chordal harmony. In Indian music system, the modes are called Ragas. Seven Modes Interpreted With Indian Classical Ragas/Thaat C to C = Ionian mode (Raag Bilawal) D to D = Dorian mode (Raag Kafi) E to E = Phrygian mode (Raag Bhairavi) F to F = Lydian mode (Raag Yaman) G to G = Mixolydian mode (Raag Khamaj) A to A = Aeolian mode (Raag Asavari) B to B = Locrian mode (Raag Todi) In this way, all these various modes resemble the one or the other basic Indian ragas which are also called ‘Thaats’.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gtRmpw_d Pandit Dishari Chakraborty on Santoor performed Raga Music Puriya Dhyaneshri Jhala Nishaant Singh Pakhawaji Puriya Dhanashree is a raga in Hindustani classical music. It belongs to the Purvi thaat and has been derived from the defining raga of that thaat – Raga Purvi. In Western terms, the notes of Puriya Dhyaneshri correspond to the double harmonic scale with an augmented fourth. Each sruti or the microtonal interval has a definite character; the names manda, candovati, dayavati, ranjani, raudri, krodha, ugra or khsobhini denote their emotional quality which dwells in combination or singly in the notes of the modal scale: thus, dayavati, ranjani and ratika dwell in the Gandhara and each of the notes ( swara ) of the scale in its turn has its kind of expression and distinct psychological or physical effect and can be related to a colour, a mood ( rasa or bhava ), a metre, a deity or one of the subtle centres ( chakra ) of the body. ...Thus for the sringara (amorous or erotic) and the hasya (laughter) rasa, the madhyama and the pancham are used; for the Vira (heroic), raudra (wrathful) and the adbhuta (wondrous), the shadja and the Rishabha; for the bibhatsa (repulsive) and the bhayanaka (fearsome), the dhaivata; and for the karuna (compassionate), the nisada and the Gandhara are used. Every swara stands for a particular definite emotion or mood and has been classified according to its relative importance. It forms a different part of the `person' of the modal scale.
