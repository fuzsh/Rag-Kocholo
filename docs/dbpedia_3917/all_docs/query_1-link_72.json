        "text": "There is a rumour being circulated in tinsel town about Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman opting out of ace filmmaker Gautham Menon’s tri-lingual Neethane En Ponvasantham.\n\nApparently, the director started his project by stating that ARR would be composing the tracks and even used the noted musician’s name in the promo material. However, now Rahman’s participation in the movie seems to be uncertain.\n\nRahman is busy with his other commitments and unlikely to find time for this one, an industry source reveals. It has come as a surprise to many, as the makers of the film had claimed that Rahman would be scoring the music.\n\nOne may recall that it was ARR’s magical touch which was a high point in the success of Gautham’s earlier film Vinnai Thaandi Varuvaaya.\n\nThe new romantic flick features Jiiva in Tamil, Nani in Telugu and Aditya Roy in Hindi, with Gautham’s favourite actress Samantha playing the female lead in all three versions.\n\nBuzz is that Gautham is considering going back to his old friend Harris Jayaraj as the film is in the final stages, with only the song picturisations left.\n\nNeethane… has been slotted for a Valentine’s Day release. Rahman could not be reached for comment."
