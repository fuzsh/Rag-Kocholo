Ada...testing.nggiren!!!\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\nAdmin Mon Oct 22, 2012 12:33 pm\n\nSomething I wrote:\n\nhttp://grouchydays.blogspot.com/2012/09/when-ilayaraja-dusts-his-44.html\n\nDecades after Clint Eastwood has done the last Dirty Harry movie, a reporter asked him what Harry would be doing now. Eastwood replied that he’d probably enjoying his retirement and probably fly-fishing. No more .44 Magnum, but a fishing rod. Sweet, though I feel the old man is chuckling to himself thinking of penile reference.\n\nThen he did Gran Torino, where you’d swear that that is old Dirty Harry and he picked up a gun again (granted it was not the Smith & Wesson) and gave us a hell of a treat. And went with a bang, saying that that might be his last acting role.\n\nThe truth is, he was never away. He was involved in more interesting projects, having had long left making mainstream thrillers, leaving them to the younger generation.\n\nWhen Ilayaraja unleashed his masterpiece album, Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham (NEPV) film songs, I was reminded of Eastwood. While he was away doing interesting projects, I turned away and was involved in my own exploration of music (listening, not playing), only indulging in his 70s/80s.\n\nThe truth is, Ilayaraja never went away. I say this because the media and the Netizens are roaring that he’s back.\n\nApart from personal projects, he was also involved in other film industries, namely Malayalam, Telugu and getting better recognition that he should have long time ago in Hindi. True loyal fans were following. Once hardcore fan like me had basically lost interest in entire Tamizh film songs and was pursuing other musical stuff and occasionally we’d go “oh, was it?” when reviews of one of his latest outing comes out.\n\n“We” here referring to those who abandoned him back in 90s, like this idiot writer. And the new album made my conscience hurt as hell.\n\nA very rich, layered, complexly composed album boasting great sound and awesome use of guitars, this album is to be cherished for years and should be sent to space in case for possible Alien invasion, so that they will go back in peace listening to it.\n\nNot that it is as great of his past works, but this is this is what would have happened to all the old songs if he had access to the resources and equipments (not that I want them to remastered, well, ….hmmm). For this, we need to thank Gautham Menon for taking the initiative of no expense spared and making Ilayaraja wear a goddam suit, finally.\n\nThe best part of the album is the use of guitars. If not mistaken, this would probably be the most use of guitar in an Ilayaraja album. And it has goddam heavy metal sound/guitar too! Hot damn. Who would have thought that the usually monotonous warbler Yuvan would be awesome!\n\nAs a great fan of Ilayaraja, I have a feeling that Gautham want Ilayaraja to not only to reach out to the younger generation, but also reconnect to old lost fans like this knucklehead owner of this blog site. Boy did he succeed or what.\n\nJust like Eastwood picked up that gun and proved who’s the real badass in Gran Torino, Ilayaraja picked up his own .44 and showed who’s the real maestro.\n\nOh, metal fans, listen to Penkal Endral. If someone were to question me asking if Ilayaraja can do Teutonic thrash metal, I ‘d say, “you betcha!”.\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\nkv Tue Oct 23, 2012 7:19 pm\n\nGrouchy, thanks for taking the initiative to start this!\n\n(I don't need to nitpick right away, but can you please change the pink background to something more sober? )\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\napp_engine Tue Oct 23, 2012 8:36 pm\n\nGreat work, groucho!\n\nAppreciate your initiative and I'll try to be as active as possible :-)\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\nV_S Tue Oct 23, 2012 8:40 pm\n\nDear app,\n\nWe are missing you so much.

Upgraded to all time classic this week, in my books.\n\nWish there was more of the title song. It ends just when it reaches its peak.

No wonder this is GPM's favorite out of all. Unbelievably imaginative. Wonder how did he even conceive this. So rich and wonderful. And he is not the kind who spends days on a single song trying various instruments rhythm patterns etc. to see what fits best and what's catchy - which is what other MDs invariably do.\n\nBut I am a little sad that the album has not caught on with the youth as much as I expected it to be. The movie becoming a hit is doubtful too which means the songs will be short lived among the general fublic. I don't think they deserve anything better. Their loss.\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\napp_engine Thu Oct 25, 2012 5:59 pm\n\nஎன்னய்யா நடக்குது இங்க?\n\nஜீவா சொல்றாரு \"என்னோடு வா வா\" பாட்டுக்கு இப்போ தான் ஷூட்டிங் நடக்குதாமாம்...\n\nLook at this link:\n\njiivafanpage.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/indiaglitz-winners-nep-shooting-spot/\n\nWinner of the contest announced earlier by IndiaGlitz got a chance to be at the shooting spot of Neethaane En Ponvasantham recently.\n\nThe contest was conducted a week ago and lucky winners spent an entire day with the Neethaane En Ponvasantham team. They were excited to meet the team including the likes of Jiiva, Nani, Samantha and Director Gautham Menon. The winners even had an opportunity to have a brief chat with the stars and also had a chance to take photos with them. The shooting was being done for the song ‘Yennodu Va Va’ which has been popular among listeners. Check out the gallery of NEP contest winners.\n\nAnd the blog has pictures as well\n\nThis throws an interesting possibility - of Gautam getting under pressure to re-shoot, after the tremendous response to the music. (IIRC, they showed some portions of the video of the 'ennOdu vA vA' song in the audio release concert...which was quite ordinary, Jeeva telling Santhanam about the song he heard in the corresponding Telungu film and some typical niRpu-nadappu kind of shots).\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\napp_engine Thu Oct 25, 2012 6:33 pm\n\nNerd wrote: The movie becoming a hit is doubtful too\n\n:-)\n\nI think Gautam fears the same and is possibly reworking. There were earlier rumors that it will be a Deepavali release (but then another set of rumors that \"shot down\" NEPV for Deepavali by thuppAkki).\n\nWell, two some-what-biggies have already got released (thANdavam, mARRAn). Three more remain -thuppAkki, viswaroopam, kOchchadaiyAn- with which Gautam won't want to compete. Of these, thuppAkki is advertised to be for Deepavali. The other two are not very clear of coming out in 2012.\n\nObviously Gautam may have more insider info on Viswaroopam / kOchachadaiyAn (or 3D Sivaji) and has to be planning to release his movie accordingly and not fight with biggies...\n\nRe: Neethane Enthan Pon Vasantham.\n\nplum Thu Oct 25, 2012 10:01 pm\n\nI think it is just another album for youththu.
