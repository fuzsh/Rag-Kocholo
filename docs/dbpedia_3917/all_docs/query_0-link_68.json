        "text": "Gautham Menon's movie without Thamarai's lyrics\n\nA promo song from Gautham Menon's Neethane En Ponvasantham was released last week on the eve of Ilayaraja's birthday. The songs are much expected because of a couple of key factors. One of the known factors is that Ilayaraja is composing the songs in a grand manner at London symphony orchestra with live recording.\n\nThe second important yet less discussed factor is that Thamarai will not be the lyricist in this movie. Ilayaraja's preferred Lyricist, Na. Muthukumar, has written all the songs. This is the first movie of Gautham Menon which will not feature Thamarai's lyrics.\n\nInitial Opinion about \"Saindhu Saindhu\"\n\nEver since the announcement of Ilayaraja as the composer for Gautham Menon's movie, the expectations have been scaling higher notes. The response for teaser trailer and making videos at London orchestra were truly exceptional. However, the just released teaser song has received varied response from fans. Many of them have appreciated the live sounds devoid of loops and synthesizers. While some fans have expressed hope that \"saaindhu saaindhu\" song doesn't turn out to be the better one among the total of 8 tracks in the album."
