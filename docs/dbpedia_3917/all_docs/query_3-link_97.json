        "text": "So this gets us back to Salil Chowdhuri, as both Ilayaraja and A.R.Rahman were influenced by him. It is not a coincidence that all these music directors try to bring western symphonies together with Indian music.\n\nGuys,\n\nI am not agree this..I dont know How many of you guys listened Ilayaraja's music like How I hardly hear bollywood..The truth is Ilayaraja and others mentioned over here are completely different in their basic...Yes..Ilayaraja's works are based on Carnatic and the others are Hindustani based..both are different format..So, you cannot compare him with Bollywood music directors..This is like comparing \"Roger federer\" with \"Ronaldo\" ...Ilayaraja mixed Carnatic with western ,Tamil folk with western and Carnatic with Tamil Folk....He has done various fusions like this and came up with wonderful results..He is very good in western also..\n\nAnd apart from this he has done wonderful albums like \"How to Name it\" and \"Nothing but wind\"..for your kind information....\"How to name it\" is a lesson for violinists in music colleges in london..\n\nThere are so many things are there to talk abt Ilayaraja..He is simply a Legend ,He is simply a Maestro..Unfortunately he is not in the right place with right people..\n\nSo, Please do not compare any Music directors and do not make any negative comments about others.....You gusy are crticising ARR ..He is different talented person and nobody can denie his works to the Indian Music...He took the Indian Music into new era..\n\nThis thread is not for criticising/comparing others...Please try to rate your Fav peoples only..\n\nThx,\n\nPandiyan\n\nHi,\n\nI like Ilayaraja too, and that is why I had bothered find out more about him a few years back.\n\nSalil Chowdhuri was not a 'Bollywood' music director. He composed music for movies in many languages. He did more work in South Indian movies than in Hindi, including about 30 Malayalam movies. Of course he was from Bengal (I am not). Music directors from all over the country have composed for Hindi movies, and sometimes reused some of their best tunes. If this makes them a 'Bollywood' music director, Ilayaraja is one too\n\nIn today's world nothing is true unless there is a website quoting that\n\nSo here are a few excerpts I could dig up right away:\n\n---------\n\nIlaiyaraaja\n\nIlaiyaraaja worked as a session guitarist and keyboardist/organist for film music composers and directors such as Salil Chowdhury from West Bengal, who often recorded music in Madras. Later, he was hired as an assistant to the Kannada film composer G K Venkatesh, an event that marked his entry into film music composition and direction. He assisted this music director in 200 film projects.\n\n​\n\n---------\n\nSalil Chowdhury\n\nThe Hindu : Magazine / People : Flawless harmony in his music\n\nThough his contribution to Tamil films appears to be little it is not an exaggeration to say that Salil da was a trendsetter on the scene. Both Ilayaraja and A.R. Rahman followed the path charted by him. Ilayaraja was introduced to the film industry as guitarist and combo organ player in Salil da's recordings and his influence on Ilayaraja is evident. R.K. Sekhar, Rahman's father, worked with Salil da as an assistant. Rahman himself testifies that attending Salil da's recording sessions at a young age left an indelible impression on him.​\n\n---------\n\nA R Rahman\n\n'Filmnews' Anandan, a well-known publicist, remembered in an interview some years ago how Rahman was initiated into the world of films while he was still a toddler and was called Dilip Kumar. The family embraced Islam after Sekhar's death and his widow's marriage to a Muslim businessman.\n\nAnandan remembered Rahman going to the film studios with his father Sekhar who was an assistant music director in Malayalam films.\n\n​\n\n---------\n\nI hope this opens up a few new windows...\n\nThe world of music is more connected and interlinked than it appears at the surface.\n\nHi smedhavi,\n\nI accept Salil was not from Bollywood..I know this and I know where he was from...\n\nHe has done few Tamil Films..If I am not wrong \"Thoorathu Idi Muzhakkam\" and \"Azhiyadha Kolangal\" were some of his Tamil films..I think in Malayalam the Famous \"Chemmeen\"..He was Great ..No doubt about it..Even I am a fan of his song \"Poo vannam\" from the movie \"Azhiyadha Kolangal\"..\n\nHere I mentioned abt Bollywood...Not from any other meanings..I just compared bollywood with Ilayaraja for its \"Hindustani based\" ..As I said we cannot say IR as a Bollywood Music director eventhough he has done few hit films in Hindi..Because he is \"Carnatic based\"..As you know till 1990 Most of the Bollywood music were based on Hindustani...Ok..this is not the topic of this thread..\n\nThe Point I wanted to mention over here is , This thread is not basically for Comparing/criticising other Music directors..Here i have seen \"overrated\" comments abt ARR..This is to rate your fav Music directors..not for anything..Thats what I tried to bring over here..\n\nCheers,\n\nPandiyan\n\nI wanted to add Jaidev too, an unsung hero if there ever was one.\n\nIf I hesitate, it's only because he has a very limited body of work as compared to some of the others (despite a reasonably long career span).\n\nBut check out 'Seene Mein Jalan, Aankhon Mein Toofan..' and 'Aap Ki Yaad Aati Rahi Raat Bhar'... and you'll know what I mean. Or any track from the movie 'Gharaonda'.\n\nSometimes I think the 80s did irreparable damage to Hindi film music, something it's never quite recovered from.\n\nThere is one more jewel from Jaidev - 'Dev Anand's 'Hum Dono हम द?न?? ' how one can forget the melodies from this movie...\n\n'Hum bekhudi main.. हम ब??ुद? म? तुम ?? पु?ार? ?ल? ?य?', ' main Jindgi ka saath.. म? ?ि?द?? ?ा साथ निपाता ?ला ?या', \"Abhi na Jao chhod ke ke dil abhi bhara nahin.. ?प? ना ?ा? ??ड ?र ?ि दिल ?प? परा? नह?' , and the master piece 'Alla Tero Naam Eshwar Tero Naam. ?ल्ला त?र? नाम ?श्वर त?र? नाम.'\n\nJaidev was assistant to SD for many years. Always remained in SD's shadow. It is rumored that ther SD cut Jaidev's wings so that he won't become a potential competition to his son RD.\n\nJaidev did try a come back through 'Gaman' and 'Gharonda' but again here too bad luck for Jaidev .. many leading artists refused to work with him .. he then had to bring in Runa Laila f(rom Bangaladesh) and Suresh Wadkar to keep going.\n\nSUhas\n\nHi smedhavi,\n\nI understand your points.I agree Ilaya Raja was Salil's arranger..everything is right...I dint take your point as a criticism..It is your right to rate Salil as a great M.D..Everybody has the right to list their fav are always best and they can give so many points infavor of them..You can include me also in that list\n\nI was talking about some of our guys criticised ARR as \"Over rated\" .I still beelieve the intention of this thread is not to criticise others fav..the intention was to list down the Fav M.D of the members...If somebody says ARR is great to them the others should not comment on that (or) they should not point out other M.D are not great...It happens in ARR case..Somebody said ARR is \"Overrated\" .Not only ARR...dont under rate any M.D...Music is not a common skill..\n\nThis thread is not to decide \"who is the Best in India?\" ..This is to list down members fav..I think this was the motive of himadri..If somebody wants to start a thread to decide who is the best?..Let them start and I still request you guys List your fav only and talk about their Strengths..Do not make any negative comments abt others in this thread..This may hurt others..\n\nHope everybody understand my concerns...Thx..\n\nEnjoy Music....\n\nCheers,\n\nPandiyan"
