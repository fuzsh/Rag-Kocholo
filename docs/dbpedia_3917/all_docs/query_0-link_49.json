        "text": "I once told a musician friend (and a fellow Ilayaraja fan) that Ilayaraja is popular but underrated because, notwithstanding the incredible adulation heaped on him (especially during his peak years), the full import of his work is much less widely grasped and he is regarded mostly as a highly successful film music director with manic productivity. I was reminded of this conversation again by a discussion on Baradwaj Rangan’s blog.\n\nIt is fairly easy to establish how and why A R Rahman’s work represents a clean break from everything that passed before him in film music. Starting with the sound engineering, everything sounds radically different to the point that you can’t confuse it with the older, pre-Rahman film music. With Ilayaraja, this is harder to grasp because (a) he stuck to the traditional pallavi-charanam format for the most part (b) he distinguished himself through subtle but important choices and (c) understanding the importance of these choices requires a high level of familiarity – at minimum – with Western music.\n\nNote: I say at minimum. Take me for instance. I could go for days without listening to any Indian music at all. That speaks to the amount of Western music in my collection and also to the level of comfort I have for it now. The other way to get to some reasonable level of understanding of Western music is to learn music theory and/or to proficiently play a Western instrument like guitar or keyboard (and, again, play Western genres like rock, blues, jazz on it). In short: I don’t think familiarity with a few mega popstars like Michael Jackson or Celine Dion is quite the same thing (and it won’t even acquaint you with those Western artists who most influenced Ilayaraja, but that’s another story).\n\nBut how many, at least in India, are there like me? Heck, I don’t know a whole lot of people who fall in my slot – of having an almost equal appreciation for both Indian and Western music. I know a bunch of guys online who listen to rock/metal like me and they (except the ones of a similar inclination as mine) are either openly contemptuous about Indian music or are respectfully indifferent towards it. Aka, how majority of listeners in India would react to Western music.\n\nNow why is all of this lengthy digression relevant here? Because Ilayaraja, likewise, was the first composer (in at least Hindi and Tamil/Telugu film music) who had a ‘Western half’ as active as the Indian one, whose command over both was equally good. Rahman followed in his lead and today the pendulum has perhaps swung the other way to some extent (but that, again, is a topic for another day). Ergo, to really get to grips with Ilayaraja’s work, you need to understand Western music as well as you do Indian music.\n\nBut first let’s talk about how and why he was the first to get there. Well, for one thing, most of the great composers of the 50s through to the 70s went through considerable hardship in their formative and ‘struggling’ years. They often did not have access to tutors on a sustained basis and the means to formally learn Western music were rarer still. Naushad and Salil Chowdhury had, in their time, no one else for company in their ability to write Western music notes for musicians to read and perform. Pyarelal of Laxmikant-Pyarelal would soon join this very exclusive club. But it would appear that he was the junior partner in the partnership and deferred to Laxmikant’s instincts. While Pyarelal would go on to write a symphony post Laximkant’s death, LP’s music only fleetingly flirted with ambitious Indo-Western synthesis or complex Western concepts. The others depended on arrangers to put together music apt to accompany the ‘tunes’ (vocal melodies) they composed. M S Vishwanathan likewise depended on arrangers. Through his prodigious natural talent, he would sing out the parts he wanted musicians to play. But he did not write them in Western vocabulary.\n\nAnd…to put this as politely as I can, it shows in the largely monophonic quality of their music. There are usually very elegant, even poignant instrumental parts in the interludes of the many, many great songs these giants wrote. Many of these parts in turn are beautifully rendered by the talented and passionate musicians who performed for them. But harmony is generally almost wholly absent in these songs. Through a desi jugad of the most elegant kind you could find, these composers devised a film music sound which would often evoke Western genres like rock-n-roll, bossa nova or jazz but wouldn’t have very much going on in terms of harmonic progressions. Verily an eighth wonder of the musical world – that’s what our film music was.\n\nThis is what Ilayaraja was equipped to change – in part because of his own talent and in part because he did receive a Western education from Dhanraj Master. And so, he was able to achieve a feat that ought to have been singularly difficult and yet it was a feat he duplicated at least a thousand times if not more (considering he has written over two thousand songs) – to write both an Indian song in terms of vocal melody and a Western song in terms of harmony and combine them together into one integrated composition. It is why his interludes don’t often end abruptly or with pauses but appear to be mathematically calculated down to the last decimal in how they flow from and to the vocal melody.\n\nBut he didn’t just have a mechanical, learned ability to write Western harmony but in fact developed his own distinct compositional voice. You can tell from the chords, the harmonizing of the violins, the counterpoint that it is Ilayaraja. But, you can also tell with equal ease from the pallavi that it is Ilayaraja. How is this achieved? Only Raja knows and hopefully some day, he will tell us how he does what he does. But it is this presence of an equally as dominant Western half that distinguishes Raja from the others before him. For, even the ones accomplished in Western music like Salil-da or Naushad still approached film music predominantly from the perspective of what they wanted to do with Indian melody. They then laid down arrangements that complemented these melodies well (there are exceptions like Naushad’s Husn-e-Jaana or Salil’s Guzar Jaaye Din) but these arrangements were necessarily subservient to the Indian aspect of the music. With Ilayaraja, it often becomes hard to tell which is subservient to what or whether anything is subservient.\n\nLet’s take an example with heavily chord based writing. Indeed, an example devoid of the ‘hundred violins’ that supposedly plagued every song of his and inflicted it with clutter.\n\nEnnaku Tha is driven by guitar, keyboard and some flute. That’s it. More importantly, you can see that the highly developed arrangement dictates what the vocal melody would be (and not the other way round, as is usually the case in Indian music). If you have the requisite equipment/software, try isolating just the harmony and you’ll find it is self-sufficient and has a story to tell of its own without clinging to the melody. Indeed, when a reviewer for AllAboutJazz was suggested the Neethane En Pon Vasantham album to review by another Ilayaraja fan, he wrote back saying he would love to be able to hear just the instrumental mixes for these songs. His words, not mine. As an American/European for whom that music is his bread and butter, he immediately perceived the strongly Western quality of much of Ilayaraja’s music.\n\nAnother, among many, example where this works is Netru Indha Neram:\n\nOr Uravenum:\n\nI could go on and on and on, all day…and maybe even that wouldn’t suffice to enumerate all the examples!\n\nWhen you understand, for the first time, the magnitude of what he has done in Western music, that he writes harmony just the way a rock/pop songwriter would (and with greater control over classical concepts than them, though not up to the level of classical composers themselves) and somehow integrates this with equally adept writing of Indian melody, you realize that the import of his work has not been fully appreciated…or at least widely. Because the dichotomy among listeners that I mentioned above is also seen among musicians, if to a lesser extent. Among the younger generation of rock musicians in India, especially those interested in progressive rock, Ilayaraja is often spoken of with respect. Otherwise, they operate as islands with rock musicians tending to not be that interested in film music and musicians playing for films not venturing out into Western genres independently.\n\nAnd so, you can only find a select few musicians like Prasanna who loves Coltrane and Ilayaraja just the same. For the typical Indian music listener, Coltrane could well be Greek and Latin. And for those Indians professing to love Coltrane, the mention of Ilayaraja might possibly elicit a chortle. Prasanna is able to see the beauty of the work of both…just as Ilayaraja in his time was equally captivated by both Thyagaraja and Bach.\n\nBut those who do not have much inclination towards Western music tend to see Ilayaraja’s work as merely an extension of what his predecessors did, finding only the creativity of his interludes as particularly noteworthy (and missing the stuff he does underneath the vocals). That is, they can see Rahman as bringing something totally different to the table (because it is so noticeably different) but they may not think there is even much of a gap between RD Burman and Ilayaraja.\n\nAs I said at the start, popular but underrated."
