        "text": "June 27, 2023\n\n&CenterDot;\n\nWritten by The Revolver Club\n\nMaestro. This title could not be more apt for Ilaiyaraaja. He is a composer, conductor, singer, lyricist, arranger and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nBorn in 1943 in Theni, Tamil Nadu, he started out as a part of a travelling musical troupe as a teenager. 10 years later, he was a skilled musician.\n\nHe learnt Western classical music, Carnatic music, and won a gold medal from the Trinity College of Music for his mastery of the guitar.\n\nHis breakthrough came in 1976 when producer Panchu Arunachalam entrusted him with composing the music for the film \"Annakili\" (Parrot). The soundtrack received acclaim for its skillful blend of Tamil folk poetry and Western classical music.\n\nIn the 1980s, Ilaiyaraaja became the most sought-after composer in Southern Indian cinema, collaborating with vocalists such as S.P Balasubramanyam, S. Janaki, and KJ Yesudas. Over time, he also gained wide recognition in Bollywood.\n\nBeyond film soundtracks, Ilaiyaraaja ventured into creating his own instrumental music. His first non-film album, \"How To Name It?,\" paid homage to Johann Sebastian Bach and the Carnatic composer-saint Tyagaraja. He fused Bach's Baroque-style partitas and fugues with Carnatic ragas.\n\nHe composed \"Thiruvaasakam: A Crossover,\" an oratorio featuring ancient Sangam Tamil poetry, which was set to music and translated to English by American lyricist Stephen Schwartz. It was performed by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra.\n\nRecently, he composed a song, Bharat Bhoomi, dedicated to essential workers of the COVID-19 pandemic. He has also used his music to raise awareness about children's rights and HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn 1993, he became the first Indian to compose a symphony. His Symphony No. 1 was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London.\n\nNow 80, Ilaiyaraaja has composed over 7,000 songs and scored over 1,000 films. He is considered one of the greatest composers in the world.\n\nThe former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu gave him the title of Isaignani (Musical genius). Also, he has been honored with the Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, and the Sangeet Natak Akademi award.\n\nIndian music would never be what it is today without Ilaiyaraaja; the maestro.\n\nRead more: Indiaâ€™s First Pop Queen - Gauhar Jaan\n\nBrowse our Pre-Owned Hindi Collection Here"
