        "text": "Bosses\n\nLike everyone else, they have individual quotes in Japanese and just edit teams in English.\n\nStory\n\nRugal Post-Stage 6\n\nMy translation Official translation Rugal: Heheheheh.... Hurry up. Win the tournament and come before me! You must be looking forward to it as well.... Hahahahahah! Rugal: Heh, heh, heh. Hurry up, I'm waiting for you! I know you can't wait. Yah, hah, hah!\n\nThis is mostly just simplified, like most of the story text. \"Yah, hah, hah!\" is a heckuva way to laugh, though.\n\nWin Quotes\n\nSaisyu\n\nEdit Teams\n\nMy translation Official translation My power springs from hatred, hatred deeper than anyone's! That power is infinite! My strength comes from hate! And no chemical substitutes! Is there no opponent that can satisfy me? How frustrating! Is there no one to match me? Oh, I'll just go mad! Fools! It's no wonder you were defeated! That's all you have? Get a life, pal. Now shove off!\n\nThe first two lines are similar, if considerably goofier in the English version.\n\nFor the first line, the concept of hatred bringing infinite power is dropped, in favor of Saishu telling the player that his hate is entirely organic with no additives. Good to know.\n\nFor the second, it's very similar, just the tone is slightly off. Saishu sounds weirdly British there. Then again, it's a bit more natural in English than my version, so credit where credit is due.\n\nThen for the third line, a generic Japanese line becomes a generic English SNK line. I...I can't really complain about that.\n\nI will say that I have no idea how \"get a life\" fits in this situation.\n\nSet Teams\n\nTeam My translation Hero Team Everything is as naught in the face of absolute power! Understand?! AoF Team It's been a long time, Takuma! What do you think my power? Wonderful, isn't it?! FF Team It seems like you're done in! How about giving up, right now? Ikari Team Do you hate me? Good! That is the source of all power! Now, come! PS Team Justice is nothing but a dream! In this world, there are the weak, and there are the strong! That's all! Kim Team You should be able to understand this, at least: power is justice! Women Team The difference in our strength is obvious, but it's still regrettable to have to ruin such talent. Rival Team Your hatred is incredible! Think the offer over; I don't want to smash you again.\n\n\"Everything is as naught\" might be a bit too high of a register, but I couldn't think of a better way to handle it.\n\nI like Saisyu directly addressing Takuma in the AoF line. That's a nice touch.\n\nHolding out the olive branch to the Rival Team is also pretty funny.\n\nRugal\n\nEdit Teams\n\nMy translation Official translation Not even a god can oppose me! I have already gone beyond godhood! I am more than a god! I'm a superstar! Hah, hah! You wish to be remembered in death? Very well! I will use my strongest art to destroy you! Try again. Next time I'll show you how tough I am. What a pathetic creature! Spend all eternity there, groveling on your knees! You never had a chance, blowhard. Good day!\n\nThe first line is grandiose in Japanese, jokey in English. Then again, given how rock stars were in that era...maybe Rugal was right after all.\n\nThe second line is just...bland in English. I'm not even sure it's with the right Japanese line, but it's bland either way. It's too bad, because the Japanese line is pretty cool.\n\nThe Japanese line has echos of Geese in Fatal Fury Special, but Rugal wants his opponent to spend eternity on their knees, not just their life. Harsh. Meanwhile, in English, it's a pretty generic line. \"Good day!\" makes me think of Gene Wilder in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nSet Teams\n\nTeam My translation Hero Team Both you and you father have served your purpose, Kyo! I'll send you to the afterlife together! AoF Team You can shout \"bring it on!\" as many times as you want; this is still game over! FF Team Geese and Krauser must be furious at this performance! Hahahaha! Ikari Team They're all waiting for you - your family and your men! Now, go to them! PS Team Your fate is to lose! Understand that as you die! Kim Team I can't stop laughing! You really were perfect ambassadors of justice! Women Team Flowers bloom as they die! Your flowers are certainly beautiful, ladies! Rival Team The nail that sticks out is hammered down! You'll likely hinder me in the future, so...die!\n\nI like all the story references here, that's the SNK touch. The AoF Team line is especially choice.\n\nI went with \"furious\", but the word is bitter/vexed. I think the idea is that the men who beat them went down so easily, so they'd be mad about it.\n\nRugal doesn't even try to recruit the Rival Team again. Harsh."
