        "text": "As has been the case for several Wednesdays now, a new gameplay trailer has been released for King of Fighters 15. This time, we get to closer look at how Kyo Kusanagi will look and play in SNK's upcoming 3v3 fighting game.\n\nBased on the trailer, it appears that Kyo and Iori's rivalry is as strong as ever. Though some fans have been speculating that Kyo and Iori might be teaming up in King of Fighters 15, Kyo's team was not revealed at the end of the trailer like with Benimaru, Shun'ei and Meitenkun â€” Team Hero.\n\nKyo has been one of the main protagonists of King of Fighters since the debut of the series. He is the heir of the Kusanagi clan, one of the three clans responsible for sealing the legendary snake entity, Orochi.\n\nLike Iori, Kyo has access to pyrokinetic abilities that enhance his attacks with fire as he fights. These abilities give neither him nor Iori immunity to fire.\n\nWhen Yuichiro Hiraki first designed Kyo, he was intended to be a contrast to Street Fighter's Ryu. As such, this means that Kyo dislikes training and is strong due to natural talent.\n\nCheck out Kyo Kusanagi's King of Fighters 15 gameplay trailer below:"
