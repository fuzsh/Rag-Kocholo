        "text": "Sometime this year we will get the next entry in the long running The King of Fighters franchise with the fifteenth installment. Steadily SNK has been releasing trailers for the game’s roster such as the recent reveals of Joe Higashi and Iori Yagami. Now it’s time for another classic character to make his debut.\n\nA new trailer was released for Kyo Kusanagi. The fighter has been in multiple entries in the franchise before. He’s the heir of the ancestral arts of the Kusanagi clan and uses pyrotechnic skills in battle. You can see a few of his skills alongside those fiery strikes in the trailer. He also has an eternal rivalry with Iori Yagami that seems like it will continue on here."
