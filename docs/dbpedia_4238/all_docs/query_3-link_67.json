        "text": "That would be Kyo in my opinion. Two guys who love to play fire with fire and share similar fighting abilities. Kyo would have both skill and strength - a good overall fighter. Iori would have speed and absolute chaos and madness. It'd be a close fight indeed, but I will have to still pick Kyo because I find him the better fighter of the two. It could be considered a coin toss to me.\n\nIori is way cooler than Kyo is. But it's like Celessa said, they basically have the same abilities, so it would be a matter of luck for one of them to win.\n\ni don't know who is the best but i prefer Iori Yagami, he is so stylish, and i prefer his violet flames, it is more stylish, and in game i always take him in my team :)\n\nIori. Would that include the enhanced evil Iori? :D\n\nThat guy is a madman, and combined with his unique strikes and combos, he's literally the winner. Whereas for Kyo, well I he'd just lose because he just cares about his smile. :nya:\n\noh man, Iori is my favorite but come on, He cant beat Kyo, not even Orochi Iori can. The thing is they have fought and Kyo has won, over and over and over. Kyo beat Orochi and Iori was weak enough to be controled by him.\n\nSorry but Iori wouldnt win and never has."
