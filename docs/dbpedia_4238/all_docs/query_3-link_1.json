Remilia Scarlet foresees more to this article's fate, and any and all information on it may be outdated.\n\nHelp improve this article by checking and updating its info wherever necessary.\n\nAnd now time resumes!\n\nHero Overview\n\n“ Heh, heh. You got burned! „ ~ Kyo.\n\n“ Don't let it get you down. You probably have some talent... Probably. „ ~ Kyo in The King of Fighters XIV.\n\n“ I am the champion! „ ~ Kyo's win quote.\n\nKyo Kusanagi is one of the main protagonists in SNK Playmore's The King of Fighters franchise of fighting games; he was first introduced in The King of Fighters '94 as the leader of the Japan team. He is one of the most iconic characters of the franchise and regularly appears on publicity material and merchandise. His name and abilities were designed in order to relate him with the Yamata no Orochi legend. Because he was highly popular and his outfit was changed along the series, the designers created a few clones with his old appearance. He is one of the three mascots for SNK, with the other two being Terry Bogard and Ryo Sakazaki.\n\nKyo is first introduced as a cocky delinquent high school student who is the heir to the Kusanagi clan, who can use pyrokineticpowers. In The King of Fighters universe, his clan is one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Yamata no Orochi. Due to his clan's past, Kyo fights against the Kusanagi's enemies; his rival Iori Yagami, the last member of the Yagami clan, and the Orochi's soldiers.\n\nHe enters every The King of Fighters tournament representing Japan and uses his clan's fighting style to combine fire with kenpo. Aside from the main series, Kyo also appears in several other media series such as spin-offs and crossover video games as well as comic adaptations of the series. Video games reviewers have praised his design and fighting style as one of the best from the series. Reviewers noted him to be a necessary character to have in every video game from the series and commented of him to have the best winning pose. Within Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character. A variety of collectibles based on Kyo have been created, including key chains and figurines.\n\nHe is voiced by Masahiro Nonaka between his debut, King of Fighters XIII and King of Fighters All Star in the audio, Ryōtarō Okiayu in The King of Fighters '94 Dengenki drama CD, Tomaki Maemo for the rest of his appearances, and Andrew Roth in the English versions of the Maximum Impact series. His live-action actor was Sean Farris in The King of Fighters movie, and is also voiced by Tomokazu Sugita (best known for voicing Kiyomasa Katō, Chrom, and Gintoki Sakata from Gintama) in the Japanese version of the movie and CR The King of Fighters, and by Peter Von Gomm in The King of Fighters XII.\n\nIn the VIZ dub, he is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook, who also voices Cat Noir, Rin Okumura, Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya, Eren Jaeger, Meliodas, Red, Masaomi Kida, Inosuke Hashibira, Makoto Naegi, Nagito Komaeda, and Shirou Emiya.\n\nIn the Cloverway dub, he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, who voices Yukio Okumura in Blue Exorcist, Ichigo Kurosaki in Bleach, Artemis in the Sailor Moon series, Kiba in Wolf's Rain, Lelouch vi Britannia in Code Geass, Giyu Tomioka in Demon Slayer, Genma Shiranui in Naruto, and Whittaker Reardon in Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures.\n\nBiography[]\n\nKyo begins as an high-school student who enters the first tournament both to prove his strength to the world (having already won the All-Japan Martial Arts Tournament) and to find his missing father Saisyu. After defeating Rugal for the first time, he encounters Iori Yagami who proclaims himself as Kyo's eternal enemy.\n\nKyo makes it to the finals again and fights his Brainwashed father, and then Rugal once again. He learns of his destiny to seal away Orochi from Chizuru Kagura, and in '96, defeats Goenitz along with Iori. In '97 he, along with Iori and Chizuru, battle the last remaining forces of Orochi and reseal him, but he disappears afterward, and he is found by NESTS and cloned.\n\nAfter having been missing for a year, he re-emerges and decides to invesitage NESTS, joining K' in combating the organization.\n\nIn the Tales of Ash saga, he joins with Iori and Chizuru once again to stop a group of people trying to resurrect Orochi, but Iori and Chizuru have their powers stolen by Ash Crimson, leaving Kyo as the final target. Due to Ash fully managing to unfurl his plan, however, Kyo never has his powers stolen.\n\nIn XIV, Kyo learns that a friend of Saisyu, Tung Fu Rue, is participating in the tournament with some new students. Kyo is asked to participate in order to 'show the ropes' to these newcomers.\n\nOther Media[]\n\nSuper Smash Bros.[]\n\nKyo appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a background character on the King of Fighters Stadium stage and one of the spirits of Terry's DLC spirit board, he is a ace primary attack spirit that increases the user's fire attacks. His spirit battle is on the King of Fighters Stadium stage against Captain Falcon with who have increased powers on explosion and fire attacks, Pikachu and Donkey Kong with all fighters decreased jump powers.\n\n[]\n\nKyo Kusanagi on the SNK Wiki\n\nKyo Kusanagi on the Inconsistently Admirable Wiki\n\nKyo Kusanagi on the Shonen Heroes Wiki\n\nNavigation[]\n\nHeroes\n\nMajor Heroes\n\nAsh Crimson |
