        "text": "All-Rounder: Kyo is good at pretty much everything in the midrange and closerange game. He has great normals, great close-range specials, solid confirms, and easy damage thanks to his rekkas.\n\nGreat Damage: Whether meterless or metered, Kyo can dish out great damage. His basic confirms often yield good damage and solid corner carry, while his meter burn routes allow to him to tack on high damage supers to anything for a big cash out.\n\nGreat Close Range Pressure: Once Kyo is next to his opponent, he becomes a real threat. Moves like j.2C, his rekka mixups and his EX command grab let him perform high damage conversions with knockdown consistently. Once his opponent is in the corner his game becomes even better, since he gains access to his devastating (but difficult) Orochinagi Loops.\n\nShiki Rekkas: Kyo's rekka's are his most valuable tool. They help him confirm, contest neutral, and muscle through his opponents offense. Good use of them is key to running his gameplan, and they always pay out well when used properly.\n\nGreat Punish Game: At the cost of 0.5 bars, Kyo can punish moves that might be safe thanks to distance with his 623AC since it travels forward and starts up at 4F. His 236AC also lets him push forward across neutral at high speed, which can be difficult for most characters to react to.\n\nFantastic Meter Battery: Kyo's heavy reliance on specials for conversions, pressure and mixups means he builds an insane amount of meter. It's not uncommon for him to be put at point and build anywhere from two to three bars by himself, which your mid can immediately take advantage of. If Kyo remains in play, he can also cash out the meter for fantastic damage in the corner.\n\nPunishable: Many of Kyo's specials lack either frame advantage or spacing when blocked, which makes him lose his turn off of a bad read. For example, all of Kyo's rekka enders are punishable if blocked, while his second-stage chains have immense pushback on block. While Kyo does get decent reward off of successful rekka reads, he must consistently win interactions or be punished for his mistake where other characters could simply back off.\n\nPrecise Timing: If you're the kind of player who doesn't like to leave any damage on the table, Kyo may be frustrating as he has many optimal combos that involve precise delays and timings. Thankfully, his combo flexibility means he has many easier combos you can opt for.\n\nMany Choices: Many of Kyo's listed upsides don't necessarily exist at the same time. Without meter, he loses out on oki, corner carry, defense, mixups, and his best punishment. As such, he must often make choices that other similarly powerful characters don't. Understanding when and how to use these choices is paramount in using Kyo to his fullest potential.\n\nfar A\n\nf.A\n\nf.A\n\nfar B\n\nf.B\n\nf.B\n\nDamagez (x+y) means the move has two hits.\n\nThe first does x,\n\nthe second does y,\n\nfor a total of z.Damage dealt by the move.\n\n10 is 1%.

A highly committal tool that Kyo can use to get around fireball zoning or pokes if he has the right read. Depending on the spacing and the stance in which the opponent blocks this move, the advantage can vary between punishable on block to even plus on block.\n\nThe B version is one of the faster versions and leaps about 1/3rd of a screen's distance. In most cases, it is generally minus or even unsafe on block and ends your turn. Can also be used in combos after a D Shiki Kai for a quick and easy hard knockdown ender. Can be useful for punishing fireballs.\n\nThe D version covers more distance (~2/3rds of the screen), but is slower and easier to react to. A little to safer to throw out due to always being safe on block or advantageous on block, regardless of character size or block stance, but at the same time more prone to being anti-aired or avoided on reaction. The startup makes it have absolutely no use in combos.\n\nThe EX version travels about the same distance as the D version, but at a more shallow arc and goes active a frame earlier than the B version, making it the fastest. Causes ground bounce on hit, leading itself to being a staple in Kyo's BNB combos as a way to start a juggle. This does more damage than his other EX combo starter, 236BD, so if you need to make a choice on where to spend half a bar, use this move. It's even more unsafe on block than the B version, leaving him point-blank with punishable frame advantage, and can only go over ground fireballs, limiting its applications in neutral.\n\n75 Shiki • Kai\n\n236B/D/BD\n\n236B/D/BD\n\nDamagez (x+y) means the move has two hits.\n\nThe first does x,\n\nthe second does y,\n\nfor a total of z.Damage dealt by the move.\n\n10 is 1%.

You can use Aragami as a poke, or as a relatively safe blockstring ender (it's \"unsafe\" on block, but has quite a bit of pushback, actually making you somewhat safe).

If you're learning Kyo, try to end most of your combos with this move if possible.\n\nThe EX version is a strong tool for Kyo's gameplan in the corner. While the Aragami mixups and hop mixups are what you should be relying on to open people up, conditioning with his normals and then going in for a command grab can make Kyo extremely scary in the corner. EX Kototsuki does decent damage on hit and is often worth the 0.5 bars spent on it, so make sure you layer it into your gameplan every once in a while to keep them scared.\n\nUra 108 Shiki • Orochinagi\n\n214236A/C/AC\n\n214236A/C/AC\n\nVersion Damagez (x+y) means the move has two hits.\n\nThe first does x,\n\nthe second does y,\n\nfor a total of z.Damage dealt by the move.\n\n10 is 1%.

This faster version will combo from the same setups as if the button was not held.\n\nWhile the AC version does more damage than the AC version of 182 Shiki, it is much trickier to combo into climax for full damage, especially away from the corner. Cancelling too early before the 3rd hit loses damage and too late may cause the climax to miss. If you're going for a Climax super, go for 182 Shiki instead for more consistent combos.\n\nKyo's signature super move. Kyo momentarily charges his flame powers to unleash a fiery prominence. Does rather high damage at all points in a combo, making it an effective choice when going for a metered ender.\n\nAn important element of Orochinagi is its ability to loop into itself. If Kyo has hit his opponent with Orochinagi after they've been launched (usually after 236D, D > 236C > 623C), then he can hit them while they're falling with 623C and launch them back into the move. This lets Kyo deal over 750 damage with four bars, giving him incredible kill potential as an anchor. These are called the Orochinagi Loops, and can be seen demonstrated in this clip.\n\nOrochinagi Loops are high damage and great reward, but are known for being pretty finnicky. They are also extremely hard to do if you perform the normal inputs of 623C~2141236C, so instead use KOF shortcuts and perform the setup as 632146C~236C to get the loops much easier.\n\n182 Shiki\n\n236236A/C/AC\n\n236236A/C/AC\n\nVersion Damagez (x+y) means the move has two hits.\n\nThe first does x,\n\nthe second does y,\n\nfor a total of z.Damage dealt by the move.\n\n10 is 1%.

They both have their pros and cons. Orochinagi will deal higher damage (especially if you loop it once) but 182 Shiki gives the better oki, so make a decision wisely.\n\nUra 1212 Shiki • Yakumo\n\n2141236CD\n\n2141236CD\n\nVersion Damagez (x+y) means the move has two hits.\n\nThe first does x,\n\nthe second does y,\n\nfor a total of z.Damage dealt by the move.\n\n10 is 1%.
