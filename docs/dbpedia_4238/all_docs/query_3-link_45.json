        "text": "Kyo Kusanagi\n\nFirst appearance: The King of Fighters 94 (1994)\n\nLatest appearance: The King of Fighters XIV (2016)\n\n----------\n\nWho is Kyo Kusanagi?\n\nKyo Kusanagi is the main protagonist of SNK's long-running King of Fighters series, which was one of the first games to utilize 3v3 fighting (albeit changing characters once you are knocked out similar to the new mode in Ultimate). He is a descendant of the Kusanagi clan, and as a result has the power to conjure flames in his hands. His clan has a strong rivalry with that of the Orochi clan, whose descendant Iori is obsessed with tracking down Kyo and defeating him in battle. Outside of his fighting activities, Kyo is a high school delinquent who eventually drops out of school. Unlike most FG protagonists who are often calm and reserved, Kyo is incredibly cocky and often insults his opponents in his win quotes.\n\nMore detailed bio about Kyo and his roles in the KoF games:\n\nOrochi Saga\n\nKyo's story starts in KoF 94, where he enters the King of Fighters tournament along with his friends Benimaru and Goro Daimon (composing the Japan team). They win the tournament in the end but must then face Rugal Bernstein, the powerful host of the tournament who wants to turn them into golden statues (he also helped popularize the term SNK boss syndrome due to how tough he is). Rugal is defeated but manages to escape. The Japan team wins the KoF 95 tournament and faces Rugal again, only this time Rugal is killed after he can't control the power of the Orochi clan.\n\nIt is later revealed in KoF 96 that Rugal's Orochi power was given to him by a man named Goenitz, who plans to revive Orochi. One day while training, Kyo is confronted by Goenitz and easily loses to him. This humiliating loss convinces Kyo to rework his Kusanagi flames from the projectile he always used into a brand new rekka moveset. Kyo's rekka moves would always be a part of his standard moveset from here on (aside from in XIII though the rekka moveset was available via DLC). At the climax of the 96 tournament, Kyo meets Chizuru who is a descendant of the Yata clan (essentially the 3rd clan that goes along with the Kusanagi and Orochi clans). As she explains why they must prevent the revival or Orochi, Goenitz crashes the tournament. Goenitz is defeated by Kyo, but before he parts to the afterlife gives a dire warning that the Kusanagi's fate is already sealed.\n\nIn KoF 97, Kyo eventually joins forces with Chizuru and his rival Iori to prevent the revival or Orochi. Although a very difficult fight, the three manage to seal off Orochi for good. Immediately after Orochi is sealed again, Iori challenges Kyo to a fight and the two clash.\n\nNESTS Saga\n\nAfter being knocked out as a result of his fight with Iori, Kyo is abducted by the organization known as NESTS and is used to create many clones of himself in KoF 99. The most notable of these clones is K', the protagonist of the NESTS saga. Bearing a hatred for NESTS, K' and his ally Maxima team up with Benimaru and Kyo's #1 fan Shingo to find Kyo and unravel the mystery of NESTS. Although they end NESTS' terror plot and track down the real Kyo, they are all separated from each other as the NESTS base starts to crumble. Kyo is able to escape and begins to track down NESTS by himself in KoF 2000. He eventually reunites with his old Japan team (along with Shingo) to end NESTS once and for all in KoF 2001. Kyo then teams up with Iori, K', and the artificial girl with ice powers named Kula to defeat the insane leader of NESTS known as Igniz.\n\nAsh Saga\n\n​\n\nA new threat emerges at the start of the Ash saga starting in KoF 2003, with a mysterious organization known as Those from the Past. The enigmatic Ash is able to steal Chizuru and Iori's powers and then proceeds to target Kyo in the KoF XIII tournament. Although Ash couldn't steal Kyo's flame like he did with the others, Kyo's battle in the tournament arena was used to open a gateway leading to the power of Gaia's will which was to be claimed by the leader of TftP, Saiki. After Saiki was defeated by Kyo, Ash was able to prevent Saiki from leaving the gateway to the past, thus causing a paradox that erased both Saiki and Ash.\n\nCurrent Saga (unnamed as of now)\n\nKoF XIV starts off with a brand new saga about a man named Antonov who wants to revive the hype of the KoF tournaments. He creates a brand new KoF tournament where the winners must face off with him. As Antonov is about to declare the winners of the KoF tournament, a mysterious entity known as Verse appears but is defeated by the tournament winners. It is heavily implied that Verse is the result of a paradox caused by Ash trapping himself in the past, and as a result many of the previous final bosses are to be resurrected. In Iori's ending, Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru are seen stopping a weakened Orochi being from being created.\n\nWatch the video below if you want to see Kyo in action:\n\n​\n\nKyo is one of SNK's most popular characters, as he is often in the top spots of many polls. In addition to being the main protagonist of the KoF series, Kyo was also shown facing off against Ryu in many promotional arts of the Capcom vs SNK games, further showcasing his significance to the series.\n\n​\n\nOh and he even got his own visual novel spinoff game for the PS1 (don't ask why).\n\n​\n\nReasons for Kyo's inclusion in Smash\n\nThe KoF series is insanely popular in China and Latin America countries while also finding a fair amount of popularity in Japan. The release of KoF XIV has also given the series a renewed interest in the west.\n\nNintendo has also recently proposed a deal to try and get Switches sold in China (due to China being very stingy on video games). If the Switch sells well there then they may add a character that could appeal to the Chinese fanbase such as Kyo.\n\nSNK is releasing their 40th anniversary collection this year exclusively to the Switch. They are also releasing SNK Heroines for the Switch, which might as well just be called KoF Heroines. Many KoF titles are also available on the Wii VC as well as the Switch.\n\nSmash is lacking fighters with a rekka-based moveset. The closest thing we have now is Marth's dancing blade but that doesn't really offer too much mix-up potential if you are caught in it.\n\nSince he originates from a 2D fighting game, he could have manual command inputs like Ryu does which would make him stand out from the other fighters.\n\nOriginating from a 2D fighter also means that he has a ton of moves that can be easily translated into Smash.\n\nWould beat out most other SNK reps due to his popularity. He'd beat Mai since her design most likely would not be allowed in Smash (making ZSS's look tame in comparison).\n\nTerry, Mai, Geese, and Iori (all popular SNK characters) have made guest appearances in other fighting-based games (EX Fighting Layer, Dead or Alive 5, Tekken 7, and Arcana Blood Million Arthur respectively). Kyo has yet to make a guest appearance in one, possibly meaning SNK has been waiting to add him to a specific game.\n\nReggie heavily implied following Joker's reveal that we will be seeing a lot of third party reps, so his competition with first party reps may be limited.\n\nAlso probably one of the biggest points in Kyo's favor...\n\nSakurai himself has played KoF in the past and was so good at it he would often win many times in a row.\n\nIn an interview with SourceGaming, Sakurai recounts an incident where he completely destroyed a couple in KoF 95 and felt guilty afterwards since they weren't really gamers. Some quotes from the article:\n\nSakurai said:\n\n\"A little time passed since then, to a time where I felt the fighting game [2] boom had leveled off a bit. I was slightly aimlessly playing “King of Fighters ‘95” when someone joined me, playing on the other side. Despite feeling that I’d really want to just play alone..the fight was on! I landed my moves cleanly, and quickly took the first two games. One more team member to go and victory was mine!\"\n\n\"At the time, when I was playing well I would win about 50 matches in a row, so I probably wasn’t too bad at fighting games.\"\n\nWho knows? Maybe Sakurai will want to pay tribute to this memorable moment by adding KoF's leading star to Smash.\n\nAdvantages Kyo has over other fighting game/SNK characters:​\n\nScorpion (Mortal Kombat): Sakurai has stated that for a character to be in Smash they must be represented faithfully from their games. MK is famous for its over the top violence, so if Scorpion were to be added then he'd need to be severely toned down and fatalities would have to be completely absent. Most people would probably find this lame so I don't even think they'd consider an MK fighter. Also MK is not that popular in Japan.\n\nHeihachi (Tekken): Again if a character is to be in Smash they must be faithfully represented to reflect on their games. Tekken uses a non-traditional left/right limb fighting system which Sakurai admitted would be a nightmare to properly implement into Smash (hence why Heihachi wasn't added to SSB4). Add in Heihachi's Japanese VA recently passing away, him appearing in Pac-Man's taunt, and having his own separate competition with Lloyd Irving and Heihachi doesn't seem that likely.\n\nOther SNK reps:\n\nMai Shiranui: There is a spirit of Camilla (Fire Emblem) in Ultimate that has been edited so that her cleavage is covered by her hair. Mai is famous for her sex appeal so if she were to be added then she'd most likely be censored which many would find lame.\n\nGeese Howard: While Geese is very popular he is an antagonist so it wouldn't make sense to add him over one of SNK's most prominent heroes.\n\nIori Yagami: Similar case to Geese. It would be like adding Shadow into Smash but not Sonic.\n\nAthena: One of SNK's older characters and is sort of represented in KoF through Athena Asamiya. Although she's older, Kyo is much more popular.\n\nTerry Bogard: Terry is admittedly Kyo's biggest hurdle as he can be seen as the mascot of SNK as a whole. Kyo does have one slight advantage in that the KoF series is still ongoing while the last Fatal Fury game was Garou which released in 1999.\n\nMoveset:​\n\nGeneral ideas of how Kyo would play:\n\nKyo's side-B would be his rekka based punches. Pressing a different direction between each punch will result in a different action. These actions range from regular hits to shield breaks. Visualization of what it could look like:\n\nKyo's other moves:\n\n:\n\nStandard projectile. Travels fast but only moves on the ground.\n\nSide :\n\nOR\n\nKyo's rekka moves. Different inputs can result in different actions, ranging from more damage to a possible shield break. This is probably Kyo's most complex move so there will be much more detail on this later.\n\nUp :\n\nStandard recovery/uppercut move.\n\nDown :\n\nKyo charges his meter like he could in the pre-97 games. When his meter is full, pressing down-B activates Max Mode which allows you to string together moves that you normally couldn't do. You can also use Max Mode activation to cancel a move for further combos.\n\ncombo:\n\n--> -->\n\nStandard jab combo.\n\nSide :\n\nDecent poke.\n\nUp :\n\nSends the opponent slightly upwards. Can be used to combo if the opponent doesn't DI correctly.\n\nDown :\n\nCan combo into each other like Ryu's down tilt.\n\nDash :\n\nThis is basically Ganondorf's side-B, except you can't hit blocking opponents and it sends them upwards. Very punishable on block.\n\nAerial :\n\nHits from everywhere though mainly deals damage from the front. Fairly safe to use on shield and has almost no landing lag.\n\nAerial side :\n\nBackwards version is a similar kick.\n\nAerial up :\n\nBasically this animation though the kick would cover more above Kyo.\n\nAerial down :\n\nSpikes the opponent if they get hit by the sweet spot.\n\nSide :\n\nOR\n\nHolding the smash button allows Kyo to hold the move like he does in the games.\n\nIf Kyo is in Max Mode, he will glow yellow like on the right gif while charging his smash attack. During this time you can get hurt by his flame similar to Corrin's side smash. This version has high KO potential like Cloud's down-B, but using it will cause you to lose Max Mode.\n\nDown :\n\nSends the opponent horizontally.\n\nUp :\n\nCovers mainly in front of Kyo and a bit above his head.\n\nTaunts:\n\nI imagine the second one would lead to a lot of salt.\n\nVictory animations:\n\nRolling:\n\nside : 99 Shiki\n\nup : 5 Shiki\n\nside up : Todorokiono Yo-u ? (not pretty sure how it called...)\n\nside down : 88 Shiki\n\nnote:The or attacks could be Kyo's unique system (like Cloud has his Limit gauge, and Joker has his Persona gauge...)\n\ndash : 101 Shiki or 77 Shiki\n\nThat's a hard one to choose from, but I prefer 77 Shiki more\n\nside smash : ??? Yo-u\n\nI'm surprised that Sari did't mention this one at all...\n\naerial : 48 Shiki\n\njust like Ryu's aerial\n\naerial up : 75 Shiki\n\njust like Lucario's aerial up\n\naerial front : 78 Shiki\n\naerial back : Tobi ??? (aerial version of side smash)\n\ndown : 90 Shiki\n\nNot only being a attack, it's also a very unique counter.\n\nThere are 2 types of counter, depanding on the frame Kyo is hit\n\nfront throw: ??tetsu\n\nback throw: Issetsu Seoi Nage\n\nup throw: 210 Shiki\n\nThe EX version of this move in KOFXIII is actually not moving forward when using it, so I think it's reasonble\n\ndown throw: Hiuchi tsuchi\n\nThis is originally his father, Saishu Kusanagi's move\n\ndodge: Kasumi (yep, even Kyo's dodging move has its name)\n\nfinal smash:Mu Shiki & 524 Shiki\n\nBoth are strong enough to be a FS, but... I maybe want to see a combination of these 2 moves\n\nshield broken:\n\nstamina KOed or Ryu's Focus Attack-ed\n\ntaunt:\n\nvictory pose:\n\nMoveset by CyberHyperPhoenix\n\nPossible alternate costumes:\n\nKirby hat (source):\n\nVictory theme:\n\nStage:\n\nEsaka 96\n\nBusy overpass and you can get hit by the cars underneath. The omega and battlefield versions would just be of the overpass itself.\n\nBonus alternate version similar to the Punch-Out stage (Athena's 96 stage):\n\nMusic:​\n\nSNK is well-known for their amazing music. Any of these tracks would be amazing additions to Ultimate:\n\nKoF 96: Esaka (the most iconic Kyo theme)\n\nKoF 96: Arashi no Saxophone (Iori's most iconic theme)\n\nKoF 97: Esaka Forever\n\nKoF 94: Esaka\n\nKoF 96: Rumble in the City (Ikari Warriors theme)\n\nKoF 99: K' Team Theme\n\nKoF 2000: Goodbye Esaka\n\nKoF XIII: Esaka Continues\n\nKoF XIII: Stormy Saxophone 5\n\nKoF XIII: Each Promise\n\nKoF XI: New Order\n\nKoF 99: Tears\n\nKoF 97: Bloody\n\nKoF 98: Rugal theme\n\nKoF XIV: Athena vs Kensou\n\nKoF XIV: Magical Sky\n\nCapcom vs SNK 2: True Love Making (London Stage)\n\nCapcom vs SNK 2: Stimulation (New York Stage)\n\nWant to show your support, offer ideas, or just talk about Kyo's possible inclusion in general?

Fairly safe to use on shield and has almost no landing lag.\n\nAerial side :\n\nBackwards version is a similar kick.\n\nAerial up :\n\nBasically this animation though the kick would cover more above Kyo.\n\nAerial down :\n\nSpikes the opponent if they get hit by the sweet spot.\n\nSide :\n\nOR\n\nHolding the smash button allows Kyo to hold the move like he does in the games.\n\nIf Kyo is in Max Mode, he will glow yellow like on the right gif while charging his smash attack. During this time you can get hurt by his flame similar to Corrin's side smash. This version has high KO potential like Cloud's down-B, but using it will cause you to lose Max Mode.\n\nDown :\n\nSends the opponent horizontally.\n\nUp :\n\nCovers mainly in front of Kyo and a bit above his head.\n\nTaunts:\n\nI imagine the second one would lead to a lot of salt.\n\nVictory animations:\n\nRolling:\n\nPossible alternate costumes:\n\nVictory theme:\n\nStage:\n\nEsaka 96\n\nBusy overpass and you can get hit by the cars underneath. The omega and battlefield versions would just be of the overpass itself.\n\nBonus alternate version similar to the Punch-Out stage (Athena's 96 stage):\n\nMusic:​\n\nSNK is well-known for their amazing music. Any of these tracks would be amazing additions to Ultimate:\n\nKoF 96: Esaka (the most iconic Kyo theme)\n\nKoF 96: Arashi no Saxophone (Iori's most iconic theme)\n\nKoF 97: Esaka Forever\n\nKoF 94: Esaka\n\nKoF 96: Rumble in the City (Ikari Warriors theme)\n\nKoF 99: K' Team Theme\n\nKoF 2000: Goodbye Esaka\n\nKoF XIII: Esaka Continues\n\nKoF XIII: Stormy Saxophone 5\n\nKoF XIII: Each Promise\n\nKoF XI: New Order\n\nKoF 99: Tears\n\nKoF 97: Bloody\n\nKoF 98: Rugal theme\n\nKoF XIV: Athena vs Kensou\n\nKoF XIV: Magical Sky\n\nCapcom vs SNK 2: True Love Making (London Stage)\n\nCapcom vs SNK 2: Stimulation (New York Stage)\n\nWant to show your support, offer ideas, or just talk about Kyo's possible inclusion in general?
