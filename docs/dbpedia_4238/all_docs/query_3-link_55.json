        "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first time posting in this forum.\n\nSo, Kyo Kusanagi, one of the major protagonists of the KoF series, descendant of the Kusanagi clan with pyrokinetic powers who enters in the King of Fighters tournament almost every year, and eventually fights some \"evil dude\" to save the world. \"Why should he enter in the Crusade project?\" you may ask. Well, as I said earlier, he is one of the major protagonists of the King of Fighters series, one of the most successful fighting games of all time. And yes, I've saw the Kyo Kusanagi post in the Wall of shame and trust me, my post is nothing like that, I've been thinking in how to port his trademark attacks a ton of times, trying to combine his fighting styles (moveset-wise there are 2 major Kyos: the \"Orochi saga\" Kyo and the \"NESTS saga\" Kyo, with a few tweaks between games, specially KoF XIII) in one. So, without further explanation, let's jump right into it!\n\nNeutral attacks, tilts and smashes:\n\nJab combo: A 3-hit combo combining his \"standing close\" (in KoF it means that you are next to your opponent) attacks from KoF XIII, starting with a light elbow attack (light punch), followed by a downwards kick (light kick) and finally a punch with his knuckles (strong punch), easy to jab cancel and decent knockback in the last hit.\n\nForward tilt: Geshiki: Goufu You (forward + strong kick command) from KoF games, a 2-hit kick which starts above Kyo and ends in front of him, moderate knockback and cancelable like in the games.\n\nDown tilt: His crounching light kick, fast and easy to start combos since it has very low vertical knockback.\n\nUp tilt: His \"standing close\" strong punch, low startup but decent vertical knockback.\n\nForward smash: His strong punch + strong kick command from KoF games, a shoulder charge which covers the front of his upper body , medium startup and good knockback, but short range.\n\nDown smash: His down-forward + strong kick from KoF games, also named 88-Shiki (Style 818), a 2-hit smash in which he attacks with both of his legs. The first hit has almost no knockback so the second hit can connect easily.\n\nUp smash: Strong version of 412 Shiki: Hikigane (half circle back + strong kick in NESTS saga), medium-low startup with few invincibility frames in his upper body at the beginning like its KoF counterpart, very powerful with great vertical knockback, however, unlike the original version he won't do a short hop before attacking.\n\nDash attack: First attack of 115 Shiki: Dokugami (quarter circle forward + strong punch in NESTS saga), but sped up a bit. Large hitbox and very powerful, however, unlike the game, you can't use the rest of the move (because a 4-hit dash attack which goes to the air is a little OP).\n\nGet-up attack: His crounching strong punch, good knockback and good range in both of his sides so he can keep opponents away.\n\nLedge attack: He rises from the ledge fast and then delivers his crouching strong kick, dealing horizontal knockback.\n\nAerials:\n\nNeutral aerial: His light punch aerial, a fast but weak attack with good priority.\n\nForward aerial: His aerial strong punch, it's fast has decent knockback.\n\nUp aerial: His side jump strong kick, an axe kick that starts above Kyo and ends in front of him. Not so good knockback but his foot is good as a meteor smash.\n\nDown aerial: Based on Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi (down + aerial strong punch command) from KoF games. Unlike the original attack starts a bit slow, but the attack itself is fast, with decent knockback and a good meteor smash.\n\nBack aerial: His neutral jump strong kick , but reversed. Good knockback and a reliable stage spike, but its hitbox last very few frames.\n\nNote: In some KoF titles there are two types of aerial attacks depending on the direction of the jump.\n\nGrabs:\n\nInitial grab: A fast but short ranged grab, just like in KoF games.\n\nPummel: A knee attack.\n\nFront throw: His forward throw from KoF, a punch with low knockback.\n\nBack throw: His back throw from KoF, slams the opponent to the ground and then do an elbow attack to his opponent when is still on the ground. Definitely not a good choice to throw someone, as it has poor knockback and almost no follow-ups.\n\nUp throw: Based on 212-Shiki: Kototsuki You (half circle back + kick) which Kyo uses in Orochi saga. Using both hands grabs his opponent in the air and then creates an explosion in front of him, with great knockback and ease to KO, becoming his kill throw.\n\nDown throw: Kind of an original move, throws the opponent downwards and catches his bounce with both hits of the weak version of 75 Shiki Kai (quarter circle forwards + light kick). The second hit is cancelable, has low knockback.\n\nSpecial attacks:\n\nNeutral special: 100-Shiki: Oniyaki (quarter circle forward + punch in Orochi saga), a fire projectile which moves on ground, similar to Pikachu's neutral special. His best use is to rack up damage and approach, however his aerial version is not good at all, being similar to Fox's blaster, however the gravitiy makes it fall, and if it touches any platform will disappear.\n\nNow, I have two ideas about how his side and down special might be (well actually the main problem is deciding one special lol), so I splitted them in two:\n\nSet 1:\n\nSide special: 114 Shiki: Aragami (quarter circle forward + light punch in NESTS saga), a Rekkaken style attack (Rekkaken is an attack which enables another attack to be used in a sequence, an example of this is Marth's Dancing Blade) with a few follow-ups. After the first hit you can either use side + B or down + B. Side + B strikes another punch in front of Kyo, while with down + B punches downwards, meteoring the opponent (like Ganondorf's grounded side special in Brawl) and then delivering a final punch with good knockback. If you use side + B you can now either use side + B again or up + B to finish the attack, side + B is an elbow strike with the same meteor effect as the first hit of the down + B variant and Up + B is a rising kick with low knockback.\n\nDown special: Strong version of R.E.D. Kick (back-down-back + strong kick in Orochi saga) a fast and ranged dive kick with a powerful meteor effect on grounded opponents, being able to KO by itself and dealing heavy horizontal knockback to aerial opponents (another meteor would be terribly broken), may improve his recovery if someone tries to edgeguard him. However it can't be canceled until he hits someone or touches a platform, so if you happen to fail it...\n\nSet 2:\n\nSide special: Strong version of 101 Shiki: Oboroguruma (back-down-back + strong kick in Orochi saga) a 3-hit move which involves him rise with two spinning kicks, delivering a third one to finish the movement. Has a fast startup, rising both horizontally and vertically (mostly horizontally), can combo into itself and the last hit has great knockback, also is a recovery move.\n\nDown special: 114 Shiki: Aragami (quarter circle forward + light punch in NESTS saga), a Rekkaken style attack (Rekkaken is an attack which enables another attack to be used in a sequence, an example of this is Marth's Dancing Blade) with a few follow-ups. After the first hit you can either use side + B or down + B. Side + B strikes another punch in front of Kyo, while with down + B punches downwards, meteoring the opponent (like Ganondorf's grounded side special in Brawl) and then delivering a final punch with good knockback. If you use side + B you can now either use side + B again or up + B to finish the attack, side + B is an elbow strike with the same meteor effect as the first hit of the down + B variant and Up + B is an upwards kick with average knockback.\n\nUp special: Strong version of 100 Shiki: Oniyaki (forward-down-forward + strong punch) Kyo rises vertically spinning, surrounded by a trail of flames. Hits 3 times and has medium knockback, with a good vertical distance, but low horizontal recovery.\n\nFinal Smash:\n\nUra 111 Shiki : Ama no Murakumo (quarter circle forward twice + both kicks), his Neo Max movement in KoF XIII. He launches a small flame thourgh the stage, paralyzing everyone on its path whitout invincibility/shield, and then Kyo creates walls of flames in a long distance (being able to cover an entire Final Destination with it) dealing heavy knockback and a lot of shield damage. Now some of you might ask \"But what about Ura 108 Shiki : Orochinagi? It's his first DM in the series\" and I agree with you, however it has very poor range and it's not THAT powerful, that's why I don't feel it would work correctly.\n\nMisc. stuff:\n\nOn-screen appearance:Kyo rushes to the stage surrounded by flames, then extinguish all of them and go to his stand pose.\n\nTaunt: Creates a small flame with his index finger, extinguish it with a blow and says \"He he, moetaro?\" (\"He he, you burned?\"), it's one of his taunts after winning a round in the KoF series.\n\n1st place: Thrusts his left arm upwards and says \"Ore no... kachi da!\" (I am... the winner!\"), like his taunt, it's one of his taunts after winning a round in KoF games.\n\n2nd to last place/No contest: He looks to the ground, clapping slowly.\n\nSadly, Kyo won't be able to activate specials with the original inputs of his attacks, since he uses quite a lot of them and some specials share inputs.\n\nKyo is a very powerful and unique fighter, I think he is a great contendant to be a Crusader, what do you think? Suggestions and opinions are always welcome. Thank you for reading!\n\nLast edited by FVNSPARTAN550 on Tue Jan 19, 2016 10:45 pm; edited 5 times in total"
