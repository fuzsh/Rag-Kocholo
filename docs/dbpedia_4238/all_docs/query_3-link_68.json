        "text": "It’s about time for Goodsmile Company to bring Kyo Kusanagi from The King of Fighters (KOF for short) series into a decent figure and now, I’m reviewing this Figma! Kyo Kusanagi is the main protagonist in SNK’s The King of Fighters video game series. He was first introduced in KOF 94 as the leader of the Japan team. He is the rival of Iori Yagami. Created as a hero who would fight the main characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting who were also present in the game, Kyo was highly popular. He became the SNK’s main hero which he beats Terry Bogard despite being the first original one to be created by SNK in their fighting game history. Kyo has appeared in every KOF games alongside his rival Iori, Terry, Ryo and several other characters they also had made appearance in several crossover games such as Capcom VS SNK and SNK VS Capcom which features many video game characters from the respective corporations. The Figma has the box designed simillar like the current Figma series above 200 numbering, Kyo’s box was printed fiery dark color and black with several promotional photos of the product with informations mainly written in Japanese, and inside the box there’s a red colored inner tray paper. The fiery colored box depicts Kyo’s Pyrokinesis fire element and there’s a logo of KOF 98 Ultimate Match which was the latest version of the original King Of Fighters 98 game. His product number is SP-04, making him as a special release. Well, let’s unbox this guy from the box!\n\nKyo comes up with 1 alternate faceplates, 3 Fire FX, 1 stand display and 7 alternate hands with 1 extra wrist joint.\n\nKyo wears his classic black colored Japanese high school uniform with loosened the buttons revealing his white T-shirt and he also folding his arm sleeves up to his biceps. The rests Kyo wears his white headband, his trademark Kusanagi clan gloves, brown belt, and white shoes, his uniform shirt has Kusanagi clan symbol on the back. With this design he was referred as Classic Kyo as in the overall series progressed, Kyo often changed his clothing and also his fighting style. Classic but, Gold… Frankly I like this design better than his later appearances. Judging from his getup, Kyo seems like a cocky delinquent high school student and over-confident but, well meaning protagonist of the series, more interested in enjoying life than having to partake in any particular responsibilities. Despite his seemingly arrogant and rude demeanor, he treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence. Kyo also got the same articulations style like other figmas so, you can do part swapping without any worries. The materials are mostly made from PVC and ABS, and he got approximately 30 points of articulations. Actual product has a little change compare to his promotional photos but, I have no complain for his quality since I like the actual product better than the promotional photos.\n\nLike most of his early KOF appearances, Kyo has his trademark middle part hairstyle and in this classic uniform he dons a white colored headband like Ryu, Sakura or Solid Snake with the exception there’s no tied and loose part of the headband. As for face, Kyo got sharp small eyes with black and brown yellow-ish with white shade irises. Kyo is given 2 faceplates in total, first would be his standard serious expression as his default face part. Which you can use the face for various scenes but, more fittable for recreating his battle stance pose. The alternate one was a shouting serious expression to recreate his battle scene or other posing you like. Frankly, I had a though time just to find an artwork of Kyo that resembles to this figure and all I found is this 1 which was closely resembles. In face and expression, this figma Kyo is looking exactly alike to one of his KOF XII artwork. What convinced me is that sharp small eyes and that long lined lips, imo these are pretty close to his promotional photos. But, pretty sure he wasn’t actually based from this artwork since the figma was originally referenced from his appearance in KOF98 UM. So, to think this Kyo is nowhere look alike from his original portrayal was a false to me because I did a research on looking many of Kyo’s artwork and depending on the artists, Kyo can be drawn either cute like, pretty boy, smug, cool, matured, macho, anime-ish and even realistic like Shinkiro did but, in overall I still like this Kyo, atleast he doesn’t looked cartoony nor western like character. Goodness, he needs 1 more faceplate, atleast a smirk like how artists drew most of his artwork but, more importantly to show Kyo’s overconfident side. Kyo’s head also got extra articulations like Figma Red and Rem had which we can lift his head and bend his head deeply using ball shaped joint. But, moving his head is pretty limited because of his large neck that stuck his face movement.\n\nKyo is an average man with slender build although he doesn’t really looked like an high school student for me. But, I still like how GSC did this because Kyo has never been an over bulked up person, Kyo’s approximate age would be either 16 or 17 judging from being a high school student during his earlier appearance. His uniform on vest and crotch side was made from a semi soft material but, some part was done very soft to help his posing especially the cut between his lower shoulder. Kyo’s paintjob is looking pretty standard without any paint problem. His uniform was painted black while there are several gold detailings on it, especially the gold Kusanagi clan symbol shaped like a solar eclipse. I really like this part, it shows the originality of Kyo’s design.\n\nThe only thing I don’t like no… Perhaps, all collectors is the round shape lower torso of him inside that uniform vest but, you can hardly see it since his torso almost fully covered with his uniform, I think this is the reason why they made the torso like this but, it’s still an awkward one to look at and what’s in their mind to came up with the torso like this? The back of his vest has Kusanagi clan symbol which was simply printed with gold paint. Kyo has his peg hole joint for his display stand on the center of his clan symbol.\n\nKyo got rotateable head 360 degrees and we can do rotate it without any worry due to his short hair.\n\nWe can also bend Kyo’s head and chest to the side, up and down but, couldn’t go extreme as Archetype-She Next.\n\nWe can swivel his chest and waist 360 degrees but, it’s very limited swivelling his chest due to his vest.\n\nI can make Kyo do crossing arm pose nicely although, not fully perfect pose since there’s no butterfly joint that allows us to make him crossing his arms….\n\nKyo’s articulations was done pretty standard like other Figmas so, we can create any dynamic pose on him. The very good thing from his simple getup, posing him is very convenient as you can make any pose whatever you like on Kyo including the extreme one.\n\nWOW… Aside his movable arms, wrists up and down to the side, his kicking posing is looking very generic like a real life person does a high kick! I totally like this part of Kyo, he’s very easy to play!\n\nNot only that, we can also recreate his crouching pose like how he did in the most games! But, he can only do 1 sitting pose which is looking good as well.\n\n114 Shiki Ara Gami\n\n128 Shiki Ko no Kizu\n\n125 Shiki Nanase\n\n127 Shiki Ya no Sabi\n\nGeshiki Migiri Ugachi\n\n115 Shiki Doku Gami\n\n411 Shiki Tsumi Yomi\n\n412 Shiki Batsu Yomi\n\n100 Shiki Oniyaki\n\nSince Kyo was a Pyrokinesis he was given with 3 kinds of fire effects, 1st would be a small one when he’s holding with his palm in order to recreate several of his iconic intro and winpose. You just attach the effect into his finger with a matching position left or right… 2nd would be like a fireball effect when he does his attacks such as 114 Shiki Ara Gami or 115 Shiki Doku Gami or you can recreate his other iconic attacks involving this effect. To attach this, you’ll need to remove one of his hand (left or right whatever you wish) then attach the fireball into his hand, this effect works as an alternate hand accessories for Kyo. 3rd would be a soaring fire effect that is attachable to Kyo’s arms/wrists and knees because the effect has 2 claws for attaching them, this effect was meant to recreate his trademark anti air attack 100 Shiki Oniyaki or you can also recreate other Kyo’s attacks using this effect. I actually did my own version of Kyo’s posing referenced directly from some of his games. In the photos, I recreated more expressionable 114 Shiki Ara Gami or 115 Shiki Doku Gami by adding the soaring fire effect to his arms followed of his other moves.\n\nKyo comes up with total 9 option hand parts. The one out from the box Kyo was already attached with fistful hands. The extras are 1 pair of light open splayed hands for like recreating some moves or any other kind of posing you wish to recreate, 1 pair of hand grip for holding any accessories or riding Figma Cycle, 1 pair of open splayed hands for holding one of his fire effect or any kind of purposes you like and 1 left hand with pointy finger for his trademark winning or taunting pose but, still can be handful for other purposes. There’s also 1 extra wrist joint included incase you miss or break it. Well, out from all of this hand grip was kinda uneeded imo, because Kyo never hold any object aside his fire in the games but, he’s skilled in motorcycle driving since he likes it but, this was never shown in the game….\n\n101 Shiki Oboro Guruma\n\nR. E. D. Kick (707 Shiki Koma Hohuri)\n\n100 Shiki Oniyaki\n\nOf course Kyo also comes with his own standard figma display stand, which allows us to maintain the figure from falling. We’re definitely need this so badly if we want to recreate Kyo’s variant moves.\n\nCOMPARISONS\n\nKyo is an average high school boy in his size, he’s taller than Archetype-She Next but, slightly shorter than SHF Dragon Ranger but, they’re almost stand equally. According to SNK’s official bio, Kyo’s height is 181 cm which stands close to Dragon Ranger’s US Counterpart, Tommy. But, once again he’s not a scaled figure so, it doesn’t really necessary to think whether he is accurate nor being inconsistent. Kyo’s skin color is slightly darker than Archetype-She Next but, he would probably close to Figma Red but, it doesn’t matter… I’m not interested on swapping Kyo’s part on Red….\n\n75 Shiki Kai\n\nHatsugane\n\nIssetsu Seoi Nage\n\n212 Shiki Kototsuki You\n\n108 Shiki Yamibarai\n\nUra 108 Shiki Orochi Nagi\n\n182 Shiki (KOF99-XIV)\n\n182 Shiki (KOF2000-2001-2002-2003-Snk VS Capcom-XI-NeoGeo Battle Coliseum-Maximum Impact)\n\nDespite how unwell the critics from most collectors but, I think differently… I had alot of fun posing and taking pictures of him, I even tooked too many photos!! Well, he’s perfect for posing, I can almost recreate all of his move list from the games perfectly accurate!! It was worth buying him despite the expensive price, if you like posing or a fan of KOF series then you won’t regret this but, if you want perfection looks of Kyo… Forget it lol! I really appreciated on GSC for recreating Kyo into a decent action figure, frankly it tooked quite a time for them to finally did KOF characters… Now, I’m expecting for GSC to recreate more of KOF characters, mainly Terry and Kim.\n\nPros:\n\nGood sculpt work, paintjob and materials.\n\nVery poseable!!\n\nFace is close enough to his KOF XII artwork counterpart.\n\nNicely done body proportions, I don’t spot any large gap on him.\n\nNice and fitting accessories.\n\nUser friendly on dealing several parts.\n\nCons:\n\nNeed atleast 1 more faceplate.\n\nSome paint issues but, tolerable enough.\n\nLimited head and shoulder’s movements.\n\nAwkward looking torso inside his uniform vest.\n\nExpensive price.\n\nOMAKE:\n\nPART. 01\n\nDamn right!!\n\nThis battle is about to explode!!\n\nGreen Ranger does his trademark kick but, it missed!\n\nKyo counters with Oniyaki attack but, Green Ranger managed to block it!\n\nFollowed by a kick but, also blocked!\n\nOwh… First hit from the Green Ranger!\n\nAnd 2nd hit with a kick on the gut!\n\nAnother hit from the Green Ranger!\n\nKyo successfully counter it!\n\nBut, the Green Ranger show no mercy!\n\n427 Shiki Hikigane Light Version\n\n427 Shiki Hikigane Hard Version\n\nWow, a blast like he did when fighting Ryu!!\n\nA direct heavy kick from the Green Ranger!\n\nLook out Kyo!!\n\nTommy’s trademark kick managed to hit Kyo severely!\n\nYou think he’s weak Kyo?\n\n212 Shiki Kototsuki You\n\nMan, that surely burns him! Atleast you’re still green!\n\nTommy now wields his trademark weapon: Sword of Darkness!!\n\nCan Kyo handle this?\n\nDamn! The Green Ranger has alot of advantage than Kyo!\n\nKyo eventually grab that sword!\n\nAnd…\n\nHe vaporized the Sword of Darkness that easy!\n\nDAMMIT!!\n\nHIDDEN SUPER DESPERATION MOVES!!\n\nWhat an impact!!\n\nThat surely beats him!\n\nKyo WINS!!\n\nWATCH OUT KYO!!\n\nOwh, shit… That’s a failed dirty trick from the Green Ranger….\n\n– Few moments later –\n\nWow! Another Power Rangers battle with Kyo Kusanagi! Who would win?\n\nHey, WHAT?!\n\nHoly Shit… Yagami’s here!\n\nHe effortlessly beats the Black Ranger!!\n\nTo be continued on Figma Iori Yagami review!!\n\nPART. 02"
