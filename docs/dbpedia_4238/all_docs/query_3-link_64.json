        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nFor more information about Kyo, see his King of Fighters (Orochi Saga) and King of Fighters (Nests Saga) entries.\n\nFirst appearance: The King of Fighters '94\n\nOther appearances: The King of Fighters series\n\nRelated characters: Benimaru, Iori Yagami\n\nKyo Kusanagi is one of the main characters in The King of Fighters series. In the games, Kyo's style of speech (pronouns and grammar style that are indicative of arrogance and even rudeness in Japanese culture), distinctive victory cry (Ore no... kachi da!, Japanese for \"This is my victory!\" and translated in KOF: Maximum Impact as \"I am... the champion!\"), and win quotes seem to indicate that he is arrogant, a little devil-may-care and very cocksure of himself. Despite this demeanor, he treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly doting on his girlfriend Yuki - a detail reflective of his heritage, as she is descended from the bloodline of Kushinada, the maiden that was nearly sacrificed to Orochi before the intervention of the Kusanagi, Yasakani and Yata clans. He and his often-absent father Saisyu tend squabble with and grumble over each other when they are together, but merely in jest. By contrast, he gets along well with his mother Shizuka and is very respectful to her.\n\nNormal Kyo plays very much like his appearance in The King of Fighters '98. Extra Kyo plays more like he originally did in The King of Fighters '95. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, he has complete access to all of the commands he has in the later KOF games.\n\nPro version changes[edit | edit source]\n\nR.E.D Kick performs differently, the version now travels in a shorter but at a much higher arc. It's best use seems to be if you happen to do the move at exactly the same time as the opponent jumps in (R.E.D. Kick will go over the top of them, hit and knockdown).\n\nKyo's standing has better priority and faster speed.\n\nHis crouching has less range than before, it will miss if just Kyo's white shoes overlap your opponents sprite (his pants have to overlap for the hit to connect).\n\nThe Yano Sabi comes out faster. It also has better recovery if you do not follow it up with the ground punch.\n\nMore priority against air attacks with the first hit of Kuno Kizu (especially the version), but less priority against ground attacks it seems.\n\nKyo's Oniyaki often misses if used as an anti air against opponents who don't attack, especially the version. It does however, knock down on the first hit meaning that Kyo is not punished if the second hit misses.\n\nExtra Kyo can no longer combo into his 75 Shiki Kai off of crouching .\n\nWhen juggling with the Level 3/MAX Orochi Nagi, the opponent flies higher after the first three hits and the second part comes out much faster. After the initial three hits you have to hold the button down a little longer than you used to for the last three hits to connect.\n\nYou can combo into Orochi Nagi in a few new ways if you do not hold down the button after executing it: jumping , standing (cancel) --> Level 3/MAX Orochi Nagi; With Extra Kyo, jumping , standing (cancel) --> 75 Shiki Kai --> Level 3/MAX Orochi Nagi for a mid air juggle.\n\nMoves[edit | edit source]\n\nCapcom vs. SNK, Pro[edit | edit source]\n\nNormal[edit | edit source]\n\nName Input Ge Shiki: Naraku Otoshi + Ge Shiki: Goufu You + 88 Shiki + 114 Shiki: Aragami + __128 Shiki: Kuno Kizu + during Aragami ____127 Shiki: Yano Sabi during Kuno Kizu ____125 Shiki: Nanase during Kuno Kizu __127 Shiki: Yano Sabi + during Aragami ____Ge Shiki: Migiri Ugachi during Yano Sabi ____125 Shiki: Nanase during Yano Sabi 100 Shiki: Oniyaki + R.E.D.
