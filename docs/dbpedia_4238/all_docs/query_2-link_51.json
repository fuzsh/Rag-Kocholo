        "text": "2D fighters, although showing their age, seem determined to keep pounding away. And people keep slamming their quarters into them at the arcades. One such popular game is King Of Fighters, which enjoyed hit status in Japan and America. Actually a combination of two SNK games, Fatal Fury and Art Of Fighting 2, King Of Fighters 95 brings 24 characters home to the PlayStation.\n\nOn first glance, Fighters looks a lot like Street Fighter Alpha. That s no surprise, as everyone knows the Street Fighter series are the most popular 2D fighters in the world. SNK seems aware of this, as they jokingly have Athena Asamiya start her battles in a Chun-Li school girl outfit. This is where the similarities end. Fighters is no where near as smooth as Street Fighter, nor does it have the ultra-responsive control. And even though these are difficult hurdles to jump, they re not impossible.\n\nOn the upside, there are those 24 characters, which means there s bound to be someone you like. Each fighter has 5 special attacks plus a Last Resort move, so when you do the math, that comes out to 144 special moves in all. Plus it does have that 2D anime look that everyone loves.\n\n2D fighter fans will undoubtedly like it, but the casual fighter fan, or fans of 3D fighters, may find it shallow."
