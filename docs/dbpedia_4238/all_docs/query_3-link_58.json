        "text": "Normal Combos\n\nAfter cr.B, you can use a few different normals. St.B does the most damage, has the most range, and is the easiest to input rdp+B from, but it leaves you at disadvantage on block in case you want to stop and do another mixup. For this purpose, st.A or cr.A are better. Both of them will connect on crouchers (even Chin), but st.A has less range. Personally I think cr.A is the best to use overall, although it might take a bit of practice to be able to cancel it into rdp+B if you see the opponent getting hit standing.\n\ncr.B (xN),[st.A or cr.A or st.B] xx rdp+B, dp+A - 176/181 damage (with 2x cr.B) (standing opponent only, doesn't work on Chin)\n\ncr.B (xN),[st.A or cr.A or st.B],d/f+D - 148/153 damage (with 2x cr.B)\n\nC,CD xx rdp+B, rdp+B, dp+C - 256 damage (delay 1st rdp+B a tiny bit from the CD, might be tricky off a jump-in)\n\nC,CD xx rdp+D - 199 damage (easy and reliable, just cancel CD into rdp+D immediately)\n\nC,CD xx qcb,qcf+P - 306\n\nC,CD xx qcf+D, rdp+B, dp+C - 282 damage (corner only)\n\nCritical Counter Combos\n\nKyo's CC combos are basically like building blocks. There are a few different starters depending on how much meter you have, and also specific ones for Chin and Athena. There are also a few enders that can be done on everyone, but vary in difficulty. Since they are so modular, I'll list the starters and enders separately.\n\nStarters (up until CC state ends):\n\nAnywhere, no super: [C] xx rdp+D, rdp+B, [rdp+B]\n\nAnywhere, super stocked: [C] xx rdp+D, qcb,qcf+P, [rdp+B]\n\nOn Athena and Chin, rdp+D will not connect, so use these starters:\n\nAnywhere, no super: [C]xx CD xx rdp+D, [rdp+B]\n\nAnywhere, super stocked: [C] xx f+B, rdp+B, qcb,qcf+P, [rdp+B]\n\nEnders (after CC state ends):\n\nMax damage, most difficult: CD xx qcf+D, CD xx qcf+D, rdp+B, rdp+B, dp+A - 686 damage max\n\nSub-max damage, still difficult: CD xx qcf+D, CD xx qcf+D, rdp+B, dp+C - 685 damage max\n\nLess damage, less difficult: CD xx qcf+D, qcf+D, rdp+B, dp+A - 633 damage max (actually this one is harder than the above IMO)\n\nEven less damage, even less difficult: CD xx qcf+D, qcf+D, dp+C - 628 damage max\n\nLeast damage, easiest: CD xx qcf+D, hcb+K - 621 damage max\n\nAdditional Critical Counter Combos\n\nThis is a combo in case you have about 80% meter before you land the CC:\n\n[C] xx rdp+D, rdp+B, [qcb,qcf+P], qcf+D, rdp+B, dp+A - 546 damage\n\nReally, the only difference here is that you can gain a bit more meter with another rdp+B. It's not far off from how much meter you need for the other combos. It really doesn't have an alternative that's worth it for Athena and Chin."
