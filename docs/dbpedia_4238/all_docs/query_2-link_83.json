        "text": "It's the year of our Lord, 1995. Once again invitations to the King of Fighters tournament have found their ways to the world's most powerful fighters. And their author is none other than the mysterious R! Could the R be that of Rugal, who supposedly blew himself up on his aircraft carrier a year ago?\n\nAmong the contestants for this year's tournament is the newly selected team of Billy, Yagami, and Kisaragi, who sent the American Team packing. But what in the end is Billy's scheme? What ambitions does Kisaragi cradle? And what evil designs for his old foe Kyo Kusanagi spur Iori Yagami on?\n\nThese new challengers join all of the previous tournament's contestants - except the American Team, of course - both in battle and the all-consuming intrigue that forms the core of King of Fighters '95."
