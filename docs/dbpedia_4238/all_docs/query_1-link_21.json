        "text": "[Source] The King of Fighters '95 / SNK Pony Canyon / Scitron PCCB-00187 Aug 19, 1995 Generated by MAME 0.152, modded by Valley Bell, using the Jukebox Player accessible with the Universe BIOs. The second in what would become SNK's longest- running series ever, \"The King of Fighters '95\" introduced Iori Yagami to the world with his then-unheard-of appearance, attitude and saxophone theme music. It also featured terrible damage balance to the point where one move did the same big damage when blocked that it did when it hit! But it continued to set a standard for graphical and musical prowress on the Neo Geo, up until the next KOF game redrew everything and put the game on the course toward the form we know today. The music continues to shape up, too, with a hint of the variety we would see in the next game. Apart from the saxophone music that plays for Iori and his team, there's the laid-back number played by the band in the Women Fighters Team's stage (\"Bass Crawling on the Ground\") and the funk style that accompanies Kyo and his friends in Japan. The samples are higher quality and the composition's improved, too. The soundtrack is overall great listening for any occasion. The trimming went okay except for \"Guitar, Omega and Rugal,\" whose loop point I had to use vgm2mid and vgm2txt to find. It felt like fighting Omega Rugal himself! Also, the ending themes were similarly difficult to trim for seemingly no reason other than perhaps the composers and music programmers rushing them to completion. A couple tracks (\"Funky Esaka\" and \"Prisoner\") are also set to loop earlier than vgmlpfnd says they do, because I felt the loop points I chose were more natural. Finally, there are two different versions of \"Weeping R - Sorrowful D\" in this pack that have different starting points but are otherwise identical. The first two cutscenes featuring Rugal are too short for the whole track to be heard, so in the second one, the second half of the piece is played (the \"Demo 2\" version). It's only in the third cutscene, which is long enough for the track to loop once, that you can hear the whole thing in one go. Enjoy!\n\n— The Golden Horse\n\nSource: VGMRips"
