        "text": "SNK's latest title in the KOF series, \" THE K ING OF FIGHTERS XV \" (KOF XV), is scheduled for release by the end of 2021.\n\nThe release of a new character trailer has become a weekly tradition every Thursday, and this week, another new trailer will be released on Thursday, February 18, 2021!\n\nSorry for the wait! Finally, \"Kyo Kusanagi\" is here!\n\nうっしゃぁあ！！KOF XVの新キャラクタートレーラー「ジョー・東」公開！\n\nEat me! Kyo Kusanagi joins the fray!\n\nThe character trailer for the first main character in the KOF series, Kyo Kusanagi, has just been released!\n\nHe has been involved in the story of the series since then as a semi-hero, so you could say that he is the honorary hero for life of the KOF series!\n\nThe CV is the same as in the previous KOF XIV, Tomoaki Maeno.\n\nHe also appeared in the official trailer that was released when KOF XV was announced, so there's no reason to think he won't be there, but it's a relief to hear that he's been officially announced.\n\nKyo Kusanagi is the heir to the flame-controlling Kusanagi-ryu kobujutsu, and is a stalish, cool, all-rounder type character with a wide variety of techniques, so if this is your first time playing KOF, I highly recommend you use him.\n\nHe looks cool again in his double black rider's jacket and bandana, a fusion of his early and recent designs!\n\nLet's see how they will be involved in the storyline of this new work.\n\nPR TIMES\n\nNo team announcement this time!\n\nAfter the trailers for \"Shun'ei,\" \"Meitenkun,\" and \"Nikaido Benimaru,\" the \"Hero Team\" was announced, so we can only assume that \"Iori Yagami\" → \"Joe Higashi\" →& I thought, \"Is it a team with these three? I thought so, but no team announcement was made this time.\n\nI was hoping to see Kyo and Iori on the same team, but... alas!\n\nAgain, at the end of the trailer, there was a \" Tune in next week for more info!\n\nLet's wait and see!"
