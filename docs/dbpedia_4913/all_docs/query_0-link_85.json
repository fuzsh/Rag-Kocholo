        "text": "Barcelona, Spain’s second city, but first in my heart. This coastal wonderland has amazing food, a diverse population, and a relaxed atmosphere. I spent two months in Barcelona last spring/summer and got to see Barcelona from another perspective. From rooftop bars to iconic landmarks, this is all the best things to do in Barcelona.\n\nThis list is divided into different neighborhoods throughout Barcelona.\n\nGothic Quarter\n\nThe Gothic Quarter is the center of Barcelona and where the famous La Rambla street is located. This is a big tourist hub and therefore a prime spot for pickpockets. But not to fret, keep your valuables close to you while walking these busy streets, avoid distractions, and you should see no problem. There’s plenty to do and see so here are some of the best things to do in the Gothic Quarter, Barcelona.\n\nBarcelona Cathedral\n\nTIP: The entrance is free to the church each day from 10 am-noon. It’s just an additional 3€ to go to the rooftop\n\nHotel Colón Rooftop\n\nThis is the best view of Barcelona cathedral! The view at the Barcelona Cathedral rooftop is beautiful but if you want a view of the cathedral itself go Hotel Colón.\n\nLa Boqueria Mercat\n\nThis popular market is a must if you’re looking for fresh produce, meats and cheeses, spices, tapas, wine, and more!\n\nEls 4 Gats\n\nThis Modernisme cafe was once frequented by Picasso and Guadí. Come for a coffee and stay for the architecture.\n\nErotic Museum\n\nThis is a bit of a tourist trap and definitely not for everyone but nonetheless a fun spot for anything with an open mind and sense of humor.\n\nEixample\n\nEixample is the Catalan word for ‘expansion’ and was once another small suburb town. The city expanded over time and the neighborhood is now full of amazing shopping streets, restaurants, and some of Antoni Guadí’s most famous masterpieces.\n\nCasa Batlló\n\nOnce of Guadí’s most famous buildings, Casa Batlló welcomes guests year around. The average visit is about an hour. To avoid large crowds come early or an hour before close. Tickets can be purchased online.\n\nEntrance 25€\n\nLa Pedrera (Casa Milá)\n\nAnother iconic Guadí masterpiece, La Pedrera is a stunner. Visit the rooftop around golden hour for the best lighting.\n\nEntrance 22€ (save 3€ when you book online)\n\nPasseig de Gràcia\n\nThis street is famous for its shops and restaurants. From Adidas to Zara and everything in between, get your shop on at Passeig de Gràcia.\n\nSant Antoni\n\nSant Antoni is a small neighborhood that is part of the Eixample District (have I confused you yet?). It’s the area around the Sant Antoni metro and boarders Poblesec, El Raval, and the neighborhood of Eixample (not to be confused with the district, and if you’re confused, that’s okay!). It’s small but has it’s own marketplace, the main street that hosts festivals and there are some amazing restaurants.\n\nMercat de Sant Antoni\n\nThe Mercat de Sant Antoni is the neighborhood’s marketplace for produce, meats, and more. There are also ready to eat food stalls. And if you don’t find everything you need inside there’s a Lidl supermarket on the basement level.\n\nSésamo\n\nSésamo is an amazing vegetarian/vegan restaurant. They have a multi-course special that is delicious, at a great price, and includes wine!\n\nMercat del Llibre de Sant Antoni (Sant Antoni Book Market)\n\nOpen every Sunday 8:30 am – 2:30 pm, this market is open to book lovers near and far. Score yourself used books at killer prices.\n\nEl Raval\n\nEl Raval is an interesting neighborhood, to say the least. This is where I lived during my 2-month stay in Barcelona and I got to see the good, the bad, and the ugly. It can be known as an unsafe area. Nothing bad had ever happened to me but I’ve seen some stuff. Nonetheless, I had some amazing times there. It’s a multicultural city with a large population of immigrants from around the world. It also quite artsy as it’s home to MACBA (the modern art museum) and numerous galleries.\n\nPalau Güell\n\nPalau Güell is the former home of the Güell i López family and one of the first important Antoni Gaudí received in his early career. The multilevel home is stunning and full of beautiful details. The rooftop is a picture-perfect spot with amazing views of the city. Palau Güell hosts a free day each month, find out about all the free entrance days in Barcelona here.\n\nMuseu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA)\n\nMACBA is Barcelona’s contemporary art museum and a popular spot for skateboarders. Go to the museum, hang out, and watch people skating while having some tapas at one of the cafes.\n\nCentre de Cultura Contempoània de Barcelona (CCCB)\n\nThe CCCB is a cultural center that focuses on the challenges of contemporary society through different mediums. The CCCB also hosts film screenings, music events, and more.\n\nBiblioteca de Catalunya\n\nThe Biblioteca de Catalunya is one of my favorite gems in El Raval. The library is a fun place to visit for all the bookworms. Then cheap out to the courtyard to hang out and get some fresh air. After, eat at El Jardí, an outdoor cafe that serves up amazing dishes.\n\nEl Jardi\n\nAs mentioned above, El Jardi’s outdoor space at the Biblioteca de Catalunya is quaint, romantic, and delicious. Come for dinner, drinks, or tapas.\n\nRambla del Raval\n\nLa Rambla de Raval is the neighborhood’s “main street.” It’s made up of lots of bars and restaurants and also home to the giant cat (El Gat de Botero).\n\nBars on Carrer de Joaquín Costa\n\nCarrer de Joaquín Costa is full of lively bars, restaurants, local shops, and more! The nights bring in a crowd and the bars are usually packed. I recommend checking out 33/45 and Bar Manchester.\n\nPati Manning Bar\n\nPati Manning is a cultural center located next door to CCCB. Their bar which is more like a cafe is a great place to grab some coffee. Admire their tiled walls as you sit out in the charming courtyard.\n\n360º at Hotel Barceló Raval\n\n360º is a rooftop bar at the Hotel Barceló Raval with a (you guessed it) 360º view of Barcelona.
