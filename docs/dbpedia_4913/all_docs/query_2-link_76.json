        "text": "The large influx of visitors to Sitges during the ‘puente’ holiday of 6th and 8th December caused pressure on the town’s waste collection system, which resulted in overflows and bulky items left on the Carrer de Joan Maragall.\n\nOne of the neighbours, fed up with the situation, made an official complaint to the OAC, to which he has not received a response. Josep Maria Tubau, who lives in front of a row of containers, said that ‘the problem is recurrent. It happens almost once a week’.\n\nThe neighbour believes that the problem was aggravated when the row of containers was removed from the same street with the corner of Rafael Llopart, causing all the residents in the area to throw their waste into the containers in front of his house.\n\nTubau believes that not all of the problem lies with the Sitges Town Council, although bearing in mind the cost of the cleaning contract, he said ‘the situation should be better managed’. He also attributes the problem to the uncivil attitudes of some residents, who leave everything next to the containers, instead of inside them. With the overflows being a ‘recurring problem’, he has asked for the service to be improved.
