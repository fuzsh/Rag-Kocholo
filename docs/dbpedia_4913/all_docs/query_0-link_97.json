        "text": "Summary of Antoni GaudÃ­\n\nIt is difficult for us today to believe that the most famous modern Spanish architect met his demise when, at age 73, he was run over by a tram and assumed to be an ordinary beggar for a full day before he was finally identified, too late to be nursed back to health. Yet Antoni GaudÃ­'s pious Catholicism and devotion to a spartan regimen had come to define his character almost completely by the last decade of his life, which he devoted almost exclusively to the construction of his arguably most famous work, the Sagrada FamÃ­lia church in Barcelona. Over GaudÃ­'s nearly fifty years of independent practice, he concocted and realized some of the most imaginative architectural forms in history, all of them in his native Catalonia, which have since become synonymous with the region's identity. The best-known - and most individualistic - representative of Catalan Modernisme (Art Nouveau), GaudÃ­ has fascinated and inspired generations of architects, designers, and even engineers. Today his work attracts a global following with some of the most distinctive, idiosyncratic, and recognizable designs of all time.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nGaudÃ­'s was highly innovative in terms of his explorations of structure, searching through a variety of regional styles before seizing on the parabolic, hyperbolic, and catenary masonry forms and inclined columns that he developed through weighted models in his workshop. These are often integrated with natural and highly symbolic religious imagery that encrust the structure with vibrant, colorful surfaces.\n\nGaudÃ­'s work is the most inventive, daring, and flamboyant of Catalan Modernisme (the Catalan strand of Art Nouveau) designers, but it is not uncharacteristic of the movement as a whole.\n\nGaudÃ­'s work is highly personal, in part due to his devout Catholicism, a faith that became increasingly fervent as his career progressed. In part because of this, his work contains many references to religious themes, and he increasingly led an ascetic existence towards the end of his life, even giving up all other commissions to focus on his designs for the church known as the Sagrada FamÃ­lia.\n\nGaudÃ­ often collaborated with several other Catalan designers, industrialists, artists, and craftsmen on his projects, most prominently Josep MarÃ­a Jujol, who was often responsible for the broken tilework (trencadÃ­s) that is common to much of GaudÃ­'s buildings. This helps to explain why GaudÃ­'s structures often feature such a wide variety of materials, used in inventive and clever ways.\n\nImportant Art by Antoni GaudÃ­\n\nBiography of Antoni GaudÃ­\n\nChildhood\n\nAntoni PlÃ cid Guillem GaudÃ­ i Cornet was born in Reus, Catalonia, south of Barcelona on the Mediterranean coast, in June 1852. His birthplace is the question of a small controversy, as precise documentation is nonexistent and sometimes it is claimed that he was born in the neighboring municipality of Riudoms, his paternal family's native village (though he was baptized the day after his birth in the church of Sant Pere ApÃ²stol in Reus). He was the youngest of five children born to Francesc GaudÃ­ i Serra, a coppersmith, and his wife, AntÃ²nia Cornet i Bertran. GaudÃ­'s family had roots in the Auvergne region of southern France.\n\nFrom the beginning, GaudÃ­ exhibited a great appreciation for nature and especially the environment of his native region of Catalonia. He eventually became a very enthusiastic outdoorsman, joining the club called the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya in 1879 (which took many trips into the countryside of the region and southern France). Despite his zeal for the outdoors, GaudÃ­ was sickly as a youth with various ailments, including rheumatism, which seem to have contributed to his reserved character.\n\nBarcelona and Architectural Education\n\nGaudÃ­ spent most of his time up to the age 16 in Reus, where he attended nursery school with Francesc Berenguer, who would become one of his assistants, and worked in a textile mill. In 1868 he moved to Barcelona to study teaching in a convent. While there he became interested in utopian socialist ideas and together with two of his fellow students he conjured up a plan to transform the Poblet Monastery into a utopian phalanstery, a communal, experimental institution proposed by Charles Fourier and other philosophers of the age.\n\nGaudÃ­ completed four years of compulsory military service starting in 1875, but poor health meant that he spent much of his time on sick leave, which enabled him to enroll at first the Llotja School and then the Barcelona Higher School of Architecture, from which he graduated with a degree in architecture in 1878. Health problems seem to have been pervasive in GaudÃ­'s family at the time, as in 1876 his mother died, as did his older brother Francesc, who, ironically, had just become a physician.\n\nNonetheless, the young GaudÃ­ quickly developed the rudiments and connections that would propel him to professional success. He became a draftsman for some of Barcelona's most renowned architects; including Joan Martorell, Josep FontserÃ¨, and Leandre Serrallach - employment which helped pay for his studies. During this time GaudÃ­ produced one of the few surviving handwritten documents attributable to him: the so-called \"Reus Manuscript,\" essentially a student diary in which GaudÃ­ recorded his impressions of architecture and interior decor, and setting forth his early ideas on these topics.\n\nIndependent Practice\n\nGaudÃ­ began to garner his own clients even before his graduation in 1878. That year, he produced a showcase for the glove manufacturer Camella at the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) in Paris, which caught the attention of the textile manufacturer Eusebi GÃ¼ell, who immediately asked GaudÃ­ to design the furniture of the pantheon chapel of the Palacio de Sobrellano in Comillas (the structure was being designed by GaudÃ­'s former employer and mentor, Joan Martorell). Eventually Eusebi GÃ¼ell would commission GaudÃ­ for no fewer than five major projects over the next thirty-five years.\n\nIn 1877, GaudÃ­ received his first significant commission, the Casa Vicens, a residence for Manuel Vicens i Montaner, a local brick and tile manufacturer, which effectively established GaudÃ­'s reputation in Barcelona. In 1883, the same year the Casa Vicens was completed, GaudÃ­ began his work on the Sagrada FamÃ­lia in Barcelona.\n\nThrough a commission in 1878 for the Workers' Cooperative of MatarÃ³ building, GaudÃ­ became attracted to Josefa Moreu, a teacher there, but she apparently did not return his affections. She was the only woman for whom GaudÃ­ ever expressed romantic interest, and thereafter he buried himself in work for the remainder of his life, with his Catholic faith gaining an ever-greater hold over his psyche after the rejection. In 1885, he moved briefly to the rural town of Sant Feliu de Codines in order to escape a cholera epidemic, staying in Francesc Ullar's residence. Grateful for the emergency lodging, GaudÃ­ designed a dinner table in return for the housing.\n\nThe 1888 World's Fair brought the spotlight to Barcelona, and the city received major improvements, including the expansion of electric service, which was exhibited prominently at night by arches of lights that spanned the width of the city's major boulevards. GaudÃ­ was awarded the job of designing the pavilion of the Compania Trasatlantica, a shipping company owned by the Marquis of Comillas, which was notable for its use of horseshoe arches and led to a few restoration jobs for GaudÃ­ from the Barcelona city council.\n\nPatronage by the GÃ¼ell Family\n\nGaudÃ­ received the bulk of his important commissions from Eusebi GÃ¼ell; the two men had much in common, including their devout Catholic faith. These began in 1884 with the designs for the GÃ¼ell Pavilions, the outbuildings for GÃ¼ell's summer house in Pedralbes, Catalonia, and continued with GaudÃ­'s work on the Palau GÃ¼ell (1886 - 88), the family home in central Barcelona, which is today open to the public for visits. In 1890, GÃ¼ell moved his factories to the town of Santa Coloma de CervellÃ³ and asked GaudÃ­ to design a community for his workers. GaudÃ­ worked on the project for nearly 30 years before GÃ¼ell's sons abandoned the project in 1918. Between 1895 and 1897, GaudÃ­ built the Bodegas GÃ¼ell, a winery and hunting lodge at La Cuadra de Garraf. And in 1900 GaudÃ­ began the large landscape development called the Parc GÃ¼ell that occupied him until 1914.\n\nGÃ¼ell was among GaudÃ­'s most prominent friends to describe him amicably, as a pleasant person to talk to, polite, and faithful to his close associates, a contrast with some reports that depict GaudÃ­ as gruff, aloof, and unsociable. Early in his career, GaudÃ­ played the part of a socialite, reputedly dressing in fancy suits and frequently attending events such as the theater, opera, indulging an appetite for gourmet food (apparently, despite his vegetarian diet), and arriving at his job sites in a horse-drawn carriage. This changed dramatically as time passed, as his faith prompted him to lead a far more ascetic lifestyle.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that GaudÃ­ did cultivate a much wider clientele than merely the GÃ¼ell family; he also designed numerous private houses, apartment blocks, industrial and office buildings, and a large number of church-related commissions, including several restorations. In 1908, GaudÃ­ was even asked by two American entrepreneurs, whose names remain a mystery, to design a skyscraper for New York, called the Hotel Attraction, distinguished by a parabolic central tower intended to be taller than the Empire State Building and topped by a star motif.\n\nCatalan Nationalism\n\nGaudÃ­ was rarely directly involved in political activities, despite his frequent use of Catalan motifs in his buildings, which disclose his deep allegiance to his native region. He maintained close links with regional artist societies, including the Catholic Cercle ArtÃ­stic de Sant Lluc (Artistic Circle of St. Luke), which he joined in 1899. But he steadfastly refused urgings from associates and friends to run for office, as a few of his fellow Modernisme architects had done. GaudÃ­ did, however, attend demonstrations. He was beaten by police during a riot in Barcelona in 1920, and in September 1924, the National Day of Catalonia, GaudÃ­ was beaten and arrested at a protest against the dictator Primo de Rivera's ban on the use of the Catalan language. He was briefly jailed, then released on 50 pesetas bail.\n\nLast Years and Death\n\nAfter 1914, GaudÃ­, whose devotion to his Catholic faith had become nearly his only interest outside of his architectural practice, ceased work on all other projects besides the Sagrada FamÃ­lia, which occupied him until his death in 1926. On June 7 of that year, he was walking from work to his daily prayer and confession at the church of Sant Filip Neri when he was struck by tram on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and lost consciousness. His shabby clothes and lack of identifying documents meant that he was assumed to be a beggar, and medical treatment was delayed almost a day as a result. He was finally identified by the chaplain of the Sagrada FamÃ­lia but his condition had taken a turn for the worse, and he passed on a few days later. GaudÃ­ was given a funeral attended by a very large crowd, and buried in the Sagrada FamÃ­lia's crypt, though the church remained far from completed at his death.\n\nThe Legacy of Antoni GaudÃ­\n\nGaudÃ­'s impact is difficult to quantify. His fame grew - even internationally - during his lifetime, but the appreciation of his work began to fade after his death. During the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), during which the city of Barcelona suffered significantly, as it was the last holdout against Franco's Nationalist forces, the workshop at the Sagrada FamÃ­lia was burned, and many of GaudÃ­'s extant drawings and famed models (his preferred working method of design) were lost. Work stopped for a time on the Sagrada FamÃ­lia, and well into the 1990s the question has been raised as to whether work on the structure should stop altogether.\n\nThe rise of the International Style, particularly in the 1940s and '50s, did much to turn public opinion against Art Nouveau, and GaudÃ­'s highly unusual works were often derided as fantastical and in some cases backwards. As late as 1993, the architectural historian Neil Levine characterized the gatehouses to the Parc GÃ¼ell as something that gnomes would jump out from to frighten passing visitors.\n\nThe appreciation of GaudÃ­'s work has only magnified, however, since 1960, with the writings of scholars such as George Collins, Judith Rohrer, Ignaci de Sola-Morales, and GaudÃ­'s students, including CÃ¨sar Martinell, and others that have helped bring GaudÃ­ and Catalan Modernisme even greater international renown. GaudÃ­ is respected today as an innovator in many ways. Though long described as an Art Nouveau architect, most recent appraisals have emphasized his singular genius amongst his Catalan and European contemporaries.\n\nThough well aware of the rich and varied architectural past in Catalonia due to its Mediterranean location, GaudÃ­ did not remain a revivalist. He was more daring with his experiments in parabolic structures that he studied using models in his workshop. These forms, combined with a richness of the decorative surfaces and materials common to many Catalan structures, mean that his buildings will continue to attract notice well into the future.\n\nToday GaudÃ­'s global fame as a designer is assured, and seven of his buildings in Barcelona are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. Numerous tributes to GaudÃ­ include his beatification by the Catholic Church in 2000; Christopher Rouse's guitar concerto GaudÃ­ (1999), a musical of the same title from 2002, the GaudÃ­ awards by the Catalan Film Academy, and an Iberia Airbus A340 jet named after him. Perhaps most significant is the anticipated completion of the church of the Sagrada FamÃ­lia (now projected for 2026) on the centenary of GaudÃ­'s death; such an event should bring the career of this legendary architect to an appropriate and dramatic conclusion.\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on Antoni GaudÃ­"
