        "text": "The Catalan language had survived for several centuries in the vernacular, spoken by peasants, labourers and artisans. The language of power was Castilian; and so administration, law courts and education were all conducted in that language. The nineteenth-century renaixença, at first cultural and then through political organisation, started with the recovery of Catalan as a written language. The annual Jocs florals, a mediaeval celebration of poetry re-established in 1859, became a major focus of this cultural renaissance.\n\nVerdaguer (1845-1902) was born in Folgueroles, a village just 4 kilometres from Vic, into a peasant family. A bright child, he was taken into the seminary at Vic for his education. The image of the peasant poet is both false, for Verdaguer was highly educated in classical and European literature, and true, in that the great power of his poetry (and his popularity) is based on his close observation of nature. Long passages of Atlantis (Atlàntida in Catalan) lyrically describe birds, mountains and flowers, contrasting with the poem’s narrative drive, which is the destruction of the legendary city and the slaughter of its inhabitants. This combination of myth and realism, written in a beautiful Catalan, inspired the youth of the renaixença.\n\nAtlàntida won a special prize at the Jocs florals of 1877. It is a poem of 2,591 lines, divided into 10 cantos of four-line stanzas of 12 to 15 syllables rhyming ABAB, though there are variations, particularly in the Introduction and Conclusion, which have six-line stanzas. Much of it was composed on Verdaguer’s trips criss-crossing the Atlantic as chaplain on his patron Antonio López’s trading ships. Ordained a priest in 1870, he had suffered a nervous breakdown in 1873 and was prescribed tobacco (!!) and sea air. With the heightened sensitivity that may follow illness and passing over where Atlantis had sunk, he returned to a poem he had previously set aside and completed his epic.\n\nHercules, God’s agent\n\nA hermit narrates the ferocious story of Atlantis’ destruction to the sole survivor of a shipwreck, the young Columbus. Alcides, or Hercules, reaches the Garden of the Hesperides to steal the “dazzling golden oranges” (p.65). He kills the guardian dragon, which signifies the woe and end of the Atlantean Empire. Through several cantos, Atlantis is destroyed by pagan Hercules with the support of God who, wrathful at the city’s corruption, punishes the “Babylon of the West”:\n\nYet – seeing her so lovely! – who would have said\n\nthe corrupt humors and cancerous strain\n\nof dark sins would be gnawing at her chest,\n\nand tomorrow’s sun would come to wake her in vain. (p.65)\n\nIn Canto Two, Verdaguer excels with his celebration of the beauty of the Garden of the Hesperides:\n\nBy green riverbanks, like a splash of pearls,\n\nthe bird of paradise leaps in fits and starts;\n\nmerry mockingbirds and bashful blackbirds are heard,\n\njoined, now and then, by thrushes sore at heart. (p.67)\n\nThis is just one stanza out of numerous, long descriptions of nature, based on the poet-priest’s youthful excursions through the Montseny and Pyrenees. This beauty and peace is constantly contrasted with “boil and chaos” as the city’s mighty marble towers are hurled down into the sea when Hercules wrenches Africa apart from Iberia at Gibraltar and creates the Mediterranean.\n\nHercules seizes Queen Hesperis as Atlantis and its Titans fall. Canto 6 sees the Queen’s long lament as her daughters and palace are drowned beneath the waves. The giant Titans erect a mighty tower to “mock the rising waters below” and hurl “great stones and bars of iron” (p.127) at the fleeing Hercules and his captive. The world is collapsing. Hercules slays the Titans and uses one of their huge bodies as a club to crush the three-headed dragon, Geryon. Verdaguer (not unlike a director of disaster movies) revels in the violence, while Hesperis recalls happier times with her children and husband.\n\nSpain’s creation myth\n\nbook review"
