His groundbreaking poetry is, on the surface, uncomplex – to the point of disarming his readers – but the poetry encapsulates both the turbulence of his time and place (the anarchist bomb attack in Barcelona’s Liceu Opera House, the spiritual cost of the Spanish-American War, the social meltdown of Barcelona’s 1909 Tragic Week), and at the same time there comes through clearly the serenity of his gaze into both world and soul. His late-life landmark poem “Cant espiritual” caught the eye of Albert Camus and Eugenio Montale, who then translated it into French and Italian; and his steadfast friendship with Miguel de Unamuno sheds light on their contrasting views about how Spain might be put on democratic track.\n\nThese translations of Maragall’s verse capture and recreate the straightforward, yet subtle, modern lyricism of Maragall, and are combined with the scholarly framework articulating and situating Maragall’s remarkable accomplishment in its multiple contexts: the specific literary and artistic movement of Catalan modernism (Modernisme); the broader Iberian cultures network of writers; and of course, Maragall’s own lifelong commitment to forging an empowering poetics, and yet also engaging boldly in the debates of his troubled times, and cutting an emerging figure, not unlike that of Émile Zola, of prototype for the twentieth-century intellectuel engagé.\n\nThere are poets and writers who walk us through the halls of history and peoples, and yet at the same time, they also walk us through ourselves, both as individual persons and as part of a larger human network. Congratulations, Fum d’Estampa Press. We can now walk with Joan Maragall in English.\n\n—\n\nRonald Puppo (editor and translator) (2020). One Day of Life is Life. Joan Maragall.
