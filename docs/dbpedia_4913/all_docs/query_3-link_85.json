        "text": "Joan Maragall's unretiling gaze into soul and society earned him an enduring place among Spain's pantheon of diverse literatures. Until now, no translator or specialist has taken on the multifaceted task of gifting English readers with a throughgoing, extensively annotated anthology of selected Maragall poems and prose of salient impact. From his disarmingly uncomplex poetics life over unfreedom, to his high-powered responses to the social and political convulsions of his day, the stature and caliber of Maragall and his riting have singled him out as a modern European classic."
