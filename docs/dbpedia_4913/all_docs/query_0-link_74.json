        "text": "In 1907, at forty-three years of age, Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo published his first book of poetry, titled simply Poesías (Poems). Already well known in Spain as a prominent intellectual and the rector of the University of Salamanca, by this time Unamuno had produced novels, essays, and works of philosophy. Yet in the verse of Poesías, the collection from which the two poems translated below have been taken, Unamuno’s thought finds perhaps its most natural manifestation. As the Nicaraguan bard Rubén Darío wrote in 1912, “Unamuno is a poet before all else, and perhaps only that.” Born in 1864 in Bilbao, Unamuno received his doctorate in philosophy and letters from the University of Madrid. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the origins of the Basque language—an early indication of his striking linguistic dexterity and affinity for languages. After graduating he taught some Latin and eventually took a position as professor of Greek at the University of Salamanca; he translated Leopardi, Carducci, Coleridge, and his Catalan contemporary Juan Maragall. One of the most often-cited facts about this prolific Spaniard is that he read Kierkegaard in the original, having taught himself Danish. In 1901 Unamuno was named rector of the University of Salamanca, and that old city in Castile was his home for the rest of his life—although he was forced to spend several years away from it. In 1924 his opposition to the military dictatorship of Primo de Rivera sent him into exile in France; he lived and wrote just across the Pyrenees from his beloved Spain until Rivera died in 1930. In 1936 Unamuno denounced another political regime—this time that of Francisco Franco—and was consequently placed under house arrest in Salamanca, where he died during the first year of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFor Juan Maragall,\n\nmost noble poet\n\nThe cathedral of Barcelona says:\n\nMy columns rise up naked, palms of granite;\n\nopening themselves in the vaults their branches\n\nintertwine, and from the enclosure in turn\n\ntheir thick foliage falls to fasten again\n\non the ground, leaving slashes in tall windows\n\nand closing off with blossoming masonry\n\na tent of peace pitched in a vast encampment.\n\nTo the miracle of faith deep in my core\n\nthe rock’s heavy grief gives way, from massive\n\nbulk my ideal structure is then relinquished,\n\nand it is all shadow, shadow set in forms\n\nof mystery amid humble light that falls\n\nthrough the muted colors of eternal dawn.\n\nCome here, troubled mortal, come into my chest,\n\nenter my chest and I’ll descend to yours;\n\nmy hands—hands of shadow in light, mother’s hands—\n\nwill mold your heart into a quiet temple\n\nand in it I’ll raise up tall naked columns\n\nof noble reflections crowned with vaults of faith.\n\nHappiness and sadness, love, hate, faith, despair,\n\nin my chest all things like light and shadow blend,\n\nand in the eternal crepuscule of hope\n\ndeath’s dark night approaches you all, while the Sun\n\ndivine, your source of life, unfolds upon you.\n\nI am the flesh of devotion, in my lap\n\nsleep loving kisses, angry shoves, sweet regrets,\n\nsad vows, flimsy promises, and sacred pains.\n\nPains above all; those pains are the crucible\n\nthat melts mortals down, like a mystical flux\n\nis my shadow, shadow of pain that binds us.\n\nHere underneath the silence in which I rest\n\nnoises from the avenues melt together,\n\nhere the darkness of my chest washes the wounds\n\ninflicted by the light of the crude heavens.\n\nHere my chest’s universal homeland reminds\n\nthe stranger of his country; my peace stifles\n\nechoes of the mindless fight between bloodlines\n\nwhere clans slash their common trunk to ugly shreds.\n\nSupplications brush against my breast of stone\n\ndressed in the tongues of various languages,\n\nand it’s a single, solitary whisper,\n\nit’s a collective psalm, a common lament.\n\nMy choir sings its songs in the sacred Latin\n\nfrom which the noble romance tongues came flowing,\n\nit sings in the old maternal dead language\n\nthat came down from Rome, the queen of the ages,\n\nthrough Italy, cradle and tomb of glory\n\nand of misfortune, came to impart her word\n\nto my dry Catalan earth, the austere\n\nfields of Castile, to the pampered Portuguese\n\nmeadows, and the mellow, verdant plain of France.\n\nThe catholic spirit abides within me,\n\nand my voice sounds in a Pentecostal tongue\n\nthat speaks to each of you in your own language,\n\nmy mouth’s edge caressing the ears of your hearts.\n\nMy shadow combines all people, their colors\n\nextinguish under the light of my stained glass;\n\nin me all are united, in my enclave\n\nthe crowd becomes water, eternal and pure.\n\nThe peoples filter through me, and forever\n\ntheir stream is the same, an enduring current,\n\nand if out there in the world it seems to change\n\nwhat changes are just the banks and riverbed\n\nover which it runs its rough, combative course.\n\nCome to me from the solitary struggle\n\nwhen wounds reach your hearts; my shade’s divine potion\n\nis for forgetting earthly hostilities,\n\na concoction of peace, eternal wellspring\n\nthat from heaven carries us consolations.\n\nCome to me, for here there’s room enough for all,\n\nenveloped in my arms you are all brothers,\n\nI am the tent of heaven pitched here on earth,\n\nof heaven, mankind’s universal homeland.\n\nTranslated from the Spanish by Leslie Harkema"
