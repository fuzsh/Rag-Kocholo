        "text": "Antoni Gaudi was born on the 25th of June 1852 in Catalonia on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. He went to school in Barcelona. He loved architecture from a young age.\n\nAs a child, Antoni Gaudí was very ill because he had rheumatism which brought to him becoming a vegetarian and fasting himself.\n\nIn his teens, he worked as an apprentice in a textile mill, learning skills that he would use later on in life for some of his creations. Gaudí then moved to study in Barcelona at a Convent in 1868.\n\nIn 1875, Antoni took part in the Spanish Military but because of his illness he as always on leave. This meant he had more time to study.\n\nIn addition to his architecture classes, he studied French, History, Economics, Philosophy and Aesthetics. His grades were average and he occasionally failed courses. Gaudí graduated from the Provincial School of Architecture in 1878. His entire life was devoted to his job as an architect so he stayed single.\n\nGaudi was devoted to his catholic faith and this provided him with a sense of peace and contentment.\n\nBy people who didn't know him that well, he was described as gruff, unsociable and unpleasant. But for those who were close to him described him as polite, friendly man and pleasant to talk.\n\nHe had a lot of patrons such as the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santaló and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Llorenç Matamala.\n\nAs a young man he like to dress up in costly suits, with well-groomed hair and a beard, and he visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí dressed in old, worn-out suits and neglected his appearance. He was sometimes he was taken for a beggar.\n\nOn 7 June 1926, Gaudí was taking his daily walk to the Sant Felip Neri church. While crossing streets, he was struck by a passing tram and lost consciousness. Assumed to be a beggar because of his lack of identity documents and shabby clothing, he did not receive immediate aid. Eventually a police officer transported him in a taxi to the Santa Creu Hospital, where he received limited care. By the time that the chaplain of the Sagrada Família recognised him on the following day, Gaudí's condition was too bad to benefit from additional treatment. Gaudí died on 10 June 1926 at the age of 73 and was buried two days later. A large crowd gathered to bid farewell to him."
