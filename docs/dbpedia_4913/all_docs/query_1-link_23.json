His work had a crucial impact on the Catalan cultural and artistic life of the time. This library is the central library of Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district. The building, designed by Baena Casamor BCQ Architects SLP, is semi-undergrounded in the garden of Villa Florida, and its structure is due, partially, to maintain the original existing trees. Is the last public library inaugurated in Barcelona.\n\nThe library collection encompasses more than 45,000 documents, on different supports and in different fields, which is increased each month by new acquisitions. A selection of newspapers and magazines is also available.\n\nThe Sant Gervasi – Joan Maragall library organises a wide range of different activities for all: book clubs, storytelling, seminars, children’s workshops… These activities are aimed at transmitting the pleasure of reading and encouraging users to discover new authors and learn more about current issues, linked always to the books and other materials in the library.\n\nThe programme Molt per aprendre (“Lots to Learn”) includes two seasons: Creacions (workshops devoted to writing, oral and visual arts) and the Aula Digital (introductory activities to computers, photography, self-access language learning, freeware and creating blogs).\n\nThe library also supports the education community by welcoming schools visits and providing facilities and services, as well as organising digital literacy programmes. Moreover, the library is a member of the Antenes Cibernàrium network of technology training points."
