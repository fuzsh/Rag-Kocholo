        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAfter the Olympic Games of 1992, Barcelona became known to the world and an international tourist destination; but a short touristic visit cannot account for the cultural complexities of the Catalan capital. In order to know any city, to ?dwell? in it, we need to become familiar with its oral history, paintings, architecture, sculpture, and literary texts.\n\nMore specifically, the more we learn about the literature of Barcelona, the more we shall know about its culture past and present. For this reason this course will explore the city through the eyes of its writers. We shall start in the nineteenth century with the rise of the modern metropolis that we know today and finish with the post-Olympic urban reality of the twenty-first century.\n\nStudents will encounter a wide variety of materials- poetry, novel, theater and essay- and will be expected to study them with a critical eye, applying additional historical, cultural and theoretical readings. Our goal will be to arrive at a greater knowledge of the city and its context, as well as the literature surrounding it.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n- Fluency in English\n\n- Interest in literature\n\nCONTENTS\n\nThe content of the course might be subject to minor changes depending on the class\n\ndynamic. ALL readings will be provided by the instructor."
