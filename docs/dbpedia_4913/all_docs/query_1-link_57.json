        "text": "Yes, you can certainly take a tour of the space before signing up for a membership. In fact, it’s encouraged, to help you get a feel for what your workday will look like. to set up a time to come and see the space.\n\nThe open desk is the way to go if you’re looking for a flexible workspace in an open environment where you can socialize with other members. Or, choose a dedicated desk if you want a designated space that also allows you to keep in touch with the community.\n\nA private office works wonders if you or your team need a quiet, secluded space to conduct your work and interact with people in your organization.\n\nIt’s important to understand the different types of coworking arrangements available to you, depending on the type of work that you do and its duration, and whether you’re a solo worker or part of a team.\n\nAbsolutely. Flexibility is one of the best parts of coworking. Most coworking memberships are month-to-month, so you can quickly adjust your space preferences according to your unique requirements and the size of your team. Whether that means upgrading the space or downsizing it or even completely changing the type of coworking subscription that you use, you always have the option to adjust as you go.\n\nIt may be possible to adjust your membership before current membership ends, but you will have to discuss and negotiate directly with Networkia Business Center, who is more than happy to help out."
