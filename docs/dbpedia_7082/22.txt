The Archibald McDougall Visiting Professorship in International Law allows experienced and expert faculty and practitioners with a comparative and international law focus to join the WVU College of Law for up to five weeks during the academic year. The position is made possible thanks to an endowed gift by the estate of Archibald McDougall.

Archibald McDougall was born in 1903 in Tasmania, Australia. He was the second of six boys. Though his father, D.G. McDougall, was Professor of Law at the University of Tasmania, Archibald was the only son to attend university, becoming a Rhodes scholar and attending Oxford University from 1924–1927. During his illustrious legal career Mr. McDougall served as a delegate to the League of Nations, legal counselor to the British Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, and was a Professor of International Law at the Iraq Law School in Baghdad.

Mr. McDougall eventually settled in the United States (in the 1950s) and died in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in 1984. Upon his death, Mr. McDougall bequeathed a portion of his estate to the WVU College of Law in honor of McDougall’s “old and revered friends Philip C. Jessup and Francis Desk.”
