The\n\nname \"Kinloch Moidart\" was pencilled on the back of the petition, perhaps a hint of where he came from.\n\nIn the 1818 census for Broad Cove he is listed as Alexr. McNeal, age 35, born Scotland, 6 years on the island,\n\nmarried with six children. He had at least two more after 1818. So far I have been able to identify only seven of\n\nthese.
