        "text": "Participants are asked to please email Vince MacNeil at vs.macneil@ns.sympatico.ca to up-date information in this list of genealogical summaries.\n\nDNA results are displayed in the Results table (see Y results or mt results) as soon as they are available. When reading the following notes, please refer, by kit number, to the results table. Distinctive Y-DNA signatures for the Hebridean islands of Barra and Sandray are now well established. Other signatures, from islands further to the south on the Argyll coast, are not yet well established geographically. Our sampling from this southern area is somewhat inadequate, we encourage all clansmen to participate. The notes below are organized by kit number. Thank you to all participants who have shared information regarding their early ancestry.\n\nParticipant 13774 descends from Jesse Nell, born in Dumfries, Virginia in 1755. He moved to Mobile, Alabama sometime before 1783 and worked as an assistant to the Indian agent Alexander Cameron. In 1783, he moved to Charleston South Carolina where he made ropes for 40 years and he married Ursula Rebecca Brown in 1795. He died in 1823 and is buried in the 2nd Presbyterian Church yard in Charleston.\n\nParticipants 15391 and 17875 are descendants of Joseph McNeill born about 1770 in County Down, Ireland. Joseph's son John (b.ca 1796) married first Elizabeth KYLE and second Martha LENAGHAN. Participant 17875 descends from John's first marriage and participant 15391 descends from John and his second wife. The two participants are half-second cousins and their results confirm their common paternal ancestry.\n\nParticipant 16257 is an mt-DNA testee. This participant descends from Thomas McNeill, son of Robert MacNeil and Mary Katherine (MacKinnon) MacNeil of Barra. Thomas was born in Londonderry, Northern Ireland around 1724. Robert had left Barra around 1720. Thomas married Ann Tolbert and they emigrated to North Carolina/Virginia around 1750.\n\nThe results for 21971 are for a man who descends from Malcolm \"Miller\" MacDougall of Barra (who was the miller for the Laird of Barra) through his son Hector Red. Hector Red settled in Northern Cape Breton.\n\nThe results for 24757 are for a man who descends from a George Johnston b. ca 1690. This man does not have known Barra roots but it would be interesting to see how the Barra Johnstons compare to this signature.\n\nThe results for 25620 are for a descendant of a Donald McDonald of Scotland. This individual has a close match at the 25-marker level with a number of the Barra R1a MacNeil men. But the match becomes more distant at the 37-marker level. He likely shares a common ancestor with the MacNeils in the distant past.\n\nThe results for 25762 are for a descendant of James s/o Malcolm s/o John s/o Rory \"The Piper\" MacNeil. Malcolm \"Piper\" MacNeil and his wife Christina MacLean lived at Hellisay, Parish of Barra before coming to Castle Bay, Cape Breton in 1817. James b. 15 May 1806, married Mary (Hector Ban, Hector Og) MacNeil. They had a son named Hector J. who married Annie (John) Murphy who was a blacksmith at North Sydney. The participant descends from this couple.\n\nThe results for 26867 are for a descendant of Malcolm “Calum Mor” MacNeil b. ca 1809 at Benacadie, Cape Breton. He was the son of John s/o Hector \"Piper\" s/o John s/o Rory \"The Piper\" MacNeil. Rory was the hereditary piper for the Laird of Barra. Malcolm \"Calum Mor a' Mhuilinn\" was a miller at Ironville in Cape Breton. He married Mary (John \"Mor, John \"Og\") MacKinnon. Hector \"Piper\" MacNeil settled at Piper's Cove, Cape Breton about 1802.\n\nThe results for 28082 are for a descendant of Archibald MacKinnon who likely was born at Allasdale, Barra, Scotland about 1808. He was the son of Neil MacKinnon and Mary MacPhee. This family emigrated to Shenacadie, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe results for 29286 are for a descendant of Michael MacInnis b ca 1845 at Benacadie Cape Breton who m. Mary d/o Archibald MacKinnon (see above), s/o Donald MacInnis b. ca 1806 Barra and Christy MacIntyre s/o Michael \"Saor\" MacInnis and Catherine Galbraith and who lived at Sandray, s/o Rory “Saor” MacInnis of Barra.\n\nThe results for 30172 are for a descendant of Neil MacNeill of Colonsay.

He married Mary Coats in Grayson County, VA.\n\nThe results for 30645 are for an mt-DNA participant who descends from Christy \"The Big Widow\" MacLean who was the wife of John \"Red\" MacDonald. She was the daughter of Alexander \"Gobha\" MacLean and Catherine Gillis of Barra. John \"Red\" MacDonald and Christy MacLean lived at Cliad, Barra, Scotland before emigrating to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. J1 is fortunately not the most common mt-haplogroup in Western Europe. It is a relatively small group and therefore we may be able to make something of it in consideration of the maternal lineages on Barra. In terms of \"The Seven Daughters of Eve\" this is the 'Clan of Jasmine' or a subdivision of it.\n\nParticipant 30866 descends for a Neill family with roots in County Down, Ireland.\n\nThe results for 31751 are for a descendant of Walter McInnes of Low Paisley, Renfrew, Scotland who was born about 1750.

He emigrated to Nova Scotia with his family and married Catherine (Alexander) MacNeil. They lived in the Boisdale, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia area. This individual is a 23/25 marker match for the other MacKinnon of Barra descent listed above, indicating that they likely share a distant common ancestor.\n\nThe results for 33650 are for a man who descends from Hector \"Posta\" MacNeil who settled at first at East Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia and later moved to the Glace Bay, Cape Breton area. Evidence exists which links this family to Barra but the parents of Hector \"Posta\" are unknown.

This participant has matched the DNA of a descendant of a Philip McNeill born 1795 in North Carolina. Philip McNeill moved to Tennessee and married Sarah Todd, then moved on to Arkansas. Angus McNeill married Susanna Graham (b. 1793 d. 1860/70). Susanna Graham died in Jasper County, Mississippi. Angus and Susanna's children were: Cornelius (b. 1819); Flora (b. 1821); Jane (b. 1832); John (b. 1823); Katherine (b.1815); Susan (b. 1833); William Malcolm (b. 11/18/1827, Wayne Co., MS. - d. 1864 Atlanta, GA.); Caroline (b.May 28, 1830 in Wayne Co., MS.). Susanna Graham's father was Zachariah Graham and her mother was Flora. Zachariah Graham was one of the founders of Union Presbyterian Church in Moore County, North Carolina.\n\nThe results for 35098 are for a man who descends from John “Ban” MacNeil who was likely born in Barra about 1760. John Ban and his wife Catherine settled in the Red Islands area of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. John Ban was a soldier in the 82nd regiment of Highland Foot, he died about 1835.\n\nThe surname McGreal is recognized by Clan MacNeil in Canada as a variant of the name MacNeil. Participant 35411 is a descendant of Lawrence McGreal, b. c 1780, County Mayo, Ireland.\n\nThe results for 35424 are for a man who descends from a Neilson. Nothing further is known about this participant’s ancestry.\n\nThe mt-DNA results for 35602 are for a descendant of Florence \"Flory\" MacInnis who was the wife of Rory (Eoin) MacNeil of Barra. Rory and Flory were married in Barra on 11 Feb 1816. Flory was described as the d/o Angus MacInnis of Bruthernish and she died at Glengarry, Big Pond on 10 Apr 1869. They had a daughter Sarah who married John (Charles) MacNeil. John and Sarah settled first at Glengarry, Big Pond and later at Glace Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. This maternal line belongs to mt-Haplogroup H. This is sometimes called the Clan of Helena, as in the book 'The Seven Daughters of Eve'. There are seven main clans in Europe and Helena is the most common; 40% of Europeans belong to it. This clan seems to have originated (about 20,000 years ago) in the area that is now southern France and adjacent Spain. It shows a similar pattern of dispersal to the male group R1b1 (the 'Celtic' group) to which most Scottish men belong.\n\nThe results for 35676 are for a descendant of Robert McNeill, b. ca 1797 in Scotland, who lived in Masstown, Nova Scotia, just outside Truro.
