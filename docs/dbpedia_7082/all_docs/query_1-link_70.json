        "text": "Mr. Macdonald was ordained as missionary minister at Berriedale in 1806. He had married some time before, and he now took up his abode in a humble cottage in that outlandish spot. There he remained not much more than a year, the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge having appointed him to the Gaelic Church in Edinburgh. The day on which he left his humble home at Berriedale was very stormy; and as, with his wife and his father beside him, he was taking the last look of the cottage, its roof was lifted by the strength of the gale and strewn in fragments on the ground.\n\nIn Edinburgh his manner in the pulpit underwent a great change. His action became most vehement, but it never seemed extravagant to any hearer who could sympathize with the views and feelings of the preacher. His melodious voice, though often very loud, was always under his control, and was pleasant in all its tones; chanting occasionally as he spoke, he added greatly to the effect of his preaching on Celtic sensibility. His sermons, always full of thought and bright with illustration, were delivered with the most intense and unaffected earnestness of manner.\n\nHe was translated to the parish of Urquhart in 1813. Forbes of Culloden, patron of the parish, presented him, on the petition of the parishioners. This was just the post for the minister who was destined to be the “Apostle of the North.” Urquhart was a highly cultivated field, for it had long enjoyed the ministry of an eminent man of God, Mr. Charles Calder. If Macdonald had been set down in a parish which had not enjoyed a gospel ministry, the immediate field of labour would have demanded all his care. But Urquhart could spare a portion of its minister’s time while he was labouring to evangelize the region around. When we learn what the Highland Moderate ministers were fifty years ago, we cease to wonder that the name of Moderate should be a stench in the nostrils of a pious Highlander to this day. They were great cattle dealers, leading dancers at penny weddings, toast-masters at farmers’ dinners, the most “seasoned” topers at drinking bouts. They felt no restraint from public opinion, or from the censures of the Church. They were utterly ignorant of the gospel, and vehemently hated to be disturbed with it. During the week preceding his first communion Sabbath at Urquhart he had to lay his beloved wife in the grave. His elders waited on him to suggest that the communion services should be postponed. “No, no,” he said, “let not the death of my wife interfere with commemorating the death of my Saviour.” An immense crowd assembled on the occasion. As many as ten thousand persons were in the hollow beside “the burn,” where the tent was set for field preaching. Mr. Macdonald preached. There was an unusual stillness in the congregation. They knew the preacher’s affliction, and they could not even look at him unmoved. His sorrow touched them keenly, and his self-denial and devotedness appealed powerfully to their hearts. He was marvellously helped by the Lord in his work. His soul was lifted as on eagle’s wings above his great sorrow. The power of the Lord wrought signally among the people. The hearts of many sinners were touched, and the excitement at last was very great, the groans and cries of the stricken ones sometimes drowning the voice of the preacher. A great and real awakening had begun. Fully realizing his call of the Lord to be a call to do the work of an evangelist rather than to be the stated pastor of one highly cultivated spot, Mr. Macdonald now more and more embraced every opening to preach the gospel throughout the Highlands. The Moderate ministers sullenly opposed his entrance into their parishes, and made his gospel contraband to the utmost of their power. Being invited by the parishioners of Dornoch to preach to them, he at once agreed, provided the consent of the parish minister was obtained. The minister resolutely refused. But the parish of Creich was friendly ground, and Creich touches the west boundary of Dornoch. Mr. Macdonald stood on Creich soil, and the congregation sat within the parish of Dornoch. He never preached with greater power. His animation and fervour were unusual even for him. When the sermon was over it was found that the spot on which he stood was worn by the action of his feet into a hollow, which was pointed out to visitors for many years. Some will have cause to bless God for that day to all eternity.\n\nIn 1817 Mr. Macdonald preached in a dissenting chapel in the Presbytery of Strathbogie. The Presbytery took up the conduct of “the vagrant preacher” from Ross-shire, and sent up a complaint against him to the General Assembly. The Presbytery of Aberlour did the same. To the chagrin of the Moderates, it was found when the case came before the Assembly that no ecclesiastical delinquency could be made out against Mr. Macdonald. The cautious Highlander had looked well to his steps, and it was found impossible to introduce his name into the deliverance which the Assembly pronounced, censuring the conduct of any minister of the Church “who exercises his pastoral functions after a vagrant manner.”\n\nIn 1827, upon the invitation and at the charges of Mr. Daly, then Rector of Powerscourt, now Bishop of Cashel, Mr. Macdonald went upon an itinerancy in the south of Ireland to preach to the Irish-speaking population. For this purpose his Gaelic, after a little trial, was found effectual. “I have succeeded,” he says, “in making myself intelligible beyond my anticipations. Some of my hearers tell me, ‘Sir, your Gaelic is different from ours, but yet we understand it pretty well; some say ‘the most of it;’ others say, ‘every sentence.'” On one occasion, while expounding the parable of the good Samaritan, he said, “I am not to inquire at present why the priest passed the poor man by.” At once a man rose up in the congregation and said, “Plase, your rivirence, I can tell you why the priest passed him.” “I shall be glad to hear,” the preacher said, “if you can tell.” “And that I can,” said the man; “it was because he knew that the thieves had left no money in his pocket.” It turned out that the man had very lately been obliged to part with his last penny to pay the priest for burying his wife. His own experience had enabled him, as he thought, to explain the conduct of the priest in the parable.\n\nThere was no man in his day more abundant in labours in the gospel than Macdonald. During three months of each year he preached on an average two sermons every day; and in no year of his life in Ross-shire did he preach fewer than three hundred sermons. He preached upwards of ten thousand times during the last thirty-six years of his life; and he never preached an unstudied discourse. This was not owing to his confining himself to a set of sermons which he constantly repeated, for he left among his papers skeletons of discourses on almost every text on which a sermon could be written. During the earlier years of his work in the north he rode on horse-back from place to place, the black mare which carried him being almost as well known as her master. Latterly a comfortable gig, drawn by his trusty “Paddy,” conveyed him on his frequent journeyings. He was fully more careful about Paddy’s comfort than about his own. He was seen oftener than once, after a fatiguing journey, to use the scythe in mowing a supper for the horse before looking out for a supper to himself.\n\nApproaching Auldearn one dark winter night, two men sprang upon him, seized his horse’s bridle and demanded his watch and his money. “This was not the reception I expected,” he said, “on coming to preach at Auldearn.” One of the men immediately said to his companion, “This is Macdonald, we had better let him alone,” and they suddenly disappeared in the darkness.\n\nAfter one of his journeys, on which he had suffered much cold and exposure, he became very unwell and lay with a dry burning skin, and pulse at fever pace. Means were employed to bring back moisture to the skin, but without success. An old friend, Hector Holm, the “Gaius” of “the Men” of Ross-shire, heard of his illness and came to visit him. After seeing him he went out among the houses near the manse and asked the people to assemble to hear a lecture from the minister. When the manse kitchen was full Hector went back to the bedroom and told him that the people were assembled and were expecting a lecture. “I cannot rise to speak to them,” he said. “But will it not be hard to send them away without a word?” “But how can I speak to them ?” Hector suggested that he should sit up in bed wrapped in blankets. He agreed; the people came into the room, and the minister began to address them. Becoming interested in his subject, his usual fervour warmed him up, and before the lecture ended he was wet with copious perspiration. He then lay down, slept well all night, and awoke nearly well next morning. Hector Holm cured him with “a dose of preaching.”\n\nIn the year 1842 the University of New York conferred on Mr. Macdonald the degree of Doctor in Divinity. None of the universities of his native land had sense or right feeling enough to award him this degree. But it was from themselves rather than from him that they withheld an honour.\n\nIn August 1844, when a General Assembly of the Free Church was held in Inverness, Dr. Macdonald was appointed Joint-Moderator along with Dr. Macfarlane of Greenock. At the opening of the Assembly he preached a Gaelic sermon from the words, “And these who have turned the world upside down are come hither also.”\n\nIn 1847, while he was on one of his preaching tours in Perthshire, and just before entering the pulpit of Glenlyon, a letter was put into his hand. Intent on his work, he put it unopened into his pocket. Next day, as he was travelling to Edinburgh, he recollected the letter, and on opening it read the tidings of his son’s death. It was his first-born and his best beloved son John, the devoted missionary of the Free Church in Calcutta. “A few groans from a father’s wounded heart, and a few tears from a fond father’s eyes, and the Christian triumphed over the man, and with his heart he said, ‘ It is well.’ On reaching home he preached from these words in his own pulpit. ‘It is well,’ he said, referring to his beloved John, ‘that he was born; it is well, that he was educated; it is better far that he was born again; it is well that he was licensed to preach the gospel; it is well that he was ordained as a pastor; it is well that he went to India; and above all it is well for him that he died, for thus, though away from us and absent from the body, he has secured the gain of being for ever with the Lord.’\n\nDuring the last years of his life, and till within a few weeks of his death, he continued his wonted work. There was no abridging of his labours, no decay of his mental vigour, and no waning of his fervour in preaching the gospel. In one of his last sermons he declared that looking back on his preaching there was nothing which he regretted more than that he had said so little regarding the love of God the Father. He preached his last sermon in the Free Church of Kiltearn on the words, “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.”\n\nHis death was the result of a strangely insignificant cause. An uneasy boot blistered his foot. Disregarding so slight an inconvenience he continued his usual work, till at length the foot became so inflamed that he could not leave his room. The suffering increased, medical advice was sought, but still the evil made way. Mortification set in. Six medical men met in consultation. Around the house in which they met were gathered scores of stalwart men, excited to the utmost pitch by the danger of their revered pastor. The prejudice against the surgeon’s steel is very strong in some parts of the Highlands, and these loving, simple-hearted men threatened to prevent by violence the hated knife from approaching their pastor. Uninfluenced by the threats of the excited crowd, the doctors decided against attempting amputation. The virus passed into his system, and he became unconscious. He lay for a few hours merely breathing, and then fell asleep in Jesus. This memorable servant of God entered into his rest on the evening of April 18, 1849.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. JOHN MACDONALD, M.A., BLACKBURN\n\n(Died June 1, 1899)\n\nAuthor: Rev. William Innes, Skene\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly, September, 1899, p.217\n\nBy the death of Mr. John Macdonald our church has lost one of its oldest ministers, his ordination dating a few months after the Disruption. He was born in Buckie, and his early education, begun at the parish school of Rathven, under Mr. Robertson, afterwards minister of Aboyne Free Church, was completed at the Aberdeen University, where he graduated in arts and studied theology. During his course at the Divinity Hall he had charge of the school in connection with Union Church, Aberdeen —a training that proved effective in his after ministry—and at its close was licensed to preach in 1842. Mr. Macdonald’s grasp of principle and decision of character were early manifested, and witnessed by his whole career.\n\nBravely facing the toil of collecting, building, and organizing involved in the Disruption, he joined the Free Church with about two hundred other probationers, to whom a tardy tribute is about to be paid by the erection of a memorial tablet to their honour in the Assembly Hall at Edinburgh. The temperance cause also won his admiration and support. Half a century ago he was one of about forty other ministers forming the Free Church Temperance Society, whose roll to-day numbers over eight hundred.\n\nMr. Macdonald was ordained at Blackburn in December 1843, and there he lived and laboured, filling the pastorate for nearly two generations, till relieved, between two and three years ago, by the appointment of Rev. J. A. Jaffray as colleague and successor. Mr. Macdonald’s sphere was limited, subject to the discouragements common to most rural parishes of a decreasing population; but his labours were abundant and fruitful among young and old. Two at least of his flock are gospel ministers—Mr. Angus, of the West Church, Stirling, and Mr. Moir, our missionary at Blythswood, South Africa. His style of preaching was of the older school—thoroughly biblical and evangelical, apt and copious in Scripture quotation; lacking, perhaps, in modern form and freshness, but excelling in substance and unction, and enjoyed by many beyond his own congregation.\n\nMr. Macdonald was a man of simple life, exact and methodical in his habits, of quiet and kindly disposition, firm in principle, yet sympathetic and broad-minded beyond many at his age, a good man, a pleasant neighbour, and an earnest preacher of Christ’s evangel. He lived to be for some years the father of the presbytery; and on the occasion of his jubilee the brethren acknowledged his merits in an illuminated address, his congregation at the same time testifying their interest by substantial gifts. Latterly, Mr. Macdonald retired to live with his family at Brockley in London, where he died peacefully at the ripe age of eighty-one.\n\nMay his bereaved widow and children find their comfort and consolation in “the God of all grace;” and may his flock and brethren be admonished by his removal to fresh diligence “while it is day,” for to them also “the night cometh.”\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. JOHN MACDONALD, FEARN\n\n(Died August 2, 1880)\n\nAuthor: Rev. W. Taylor, Editor of “British Messenger”\n\nSource: The Free Church Monthly, October 1, 1880, Biographical Notices, p.253\n\nNo one who witnessed the funeral of this “good minister of Jesus Christ,” on Friday the 6th day of August last, could fail to be impressed with the scene. The number of persons present could not have been less than three thousand. The assemblage was gathered not only from his own congregation and parish, but from the whole neighbourhood, and from still greater distances: as the procession passed along for two hours, between the Free Church Manse and the old Abbey of Patrick Hamilton, the dark band filled nearly the whole mile and a half; and companies of weeping women and awe-struck children awaited it along the road and at the grave,—all telling of the deep affection and wide-spread esteem with which the departed minister had been regarded.\n\nThere is perhaps not a parish in Scotland whose history is, in one respect, more representative than that of Fearn; that is to say, more suggestive and illustrative of the grand formative principles of the Free Church. This thought was strongly impressed on us in the churchyard, as we observed some of the women standing under a broken arch of the old abbey, while the remains of the first Free Church minister were being committed to the grave. In that sight, the Reformation and the Disruption joined hands before our eyes; the intervening history of the parish indicating strikingly the living principles by which they were connected.\n\nThat for which Patrick Hamilton (who was abbot in commendam of the Monastery of White Friars at Fearn ) died as protomartyr of the Scottish Reformation was the gospel of the grace of God, preached by him in obedience to Christ’s commandment, and in spite of the prohibitions of men. His martyrdom, doubtless, excited inquiry in the neighbourhood of his monastery into the cause for which he died; and his second successor, the last abbot of Fearn, voted in the Scottish Parliament of 1560 for the Reformation. The people of Fearn seem to have been favoured with the gospel almost ever since; and in recent times they have emphatically shown their desire to hear it preached in purity, and by men whom they believed really to feel the power of it. In the early part of this century there was presented to the parish an outwardly respectable, not unlearned, and, as far as we have heard, orthodox minister; to whom, however, the people would not commit the care of their own and their children’s souls, because they were not satisfied that he possessed the one essential qualification of a minister of Jesus Christ. Accordingly they did not sign his call, and the Presbytery, in consequence, refused to induct him until peremptorily ordered by the General Assembly. The induction took place in the presence of soldiers; but the people, almost all of them, asserted their evangelical liberty by resorting, as they could, to the preaching of ministers in neighbouring parishes, and partly, also, by attending meetings, held (generally on Sabbath evenings) by pious men in the villages of the parish, for prayer, reading of God’s Word, spiritual conference, and mutual giving and hearing of notes from the sermons of the godly ministers to whom they had listened during the day. One of the leaders of these meetings, Alexander Ross (better known in the district as Allister or Sandy MacHomash), has been immortalized by Hugh Miller, not only for his deep piety and for his eloquence in his native Gaelic tongue, but for his heroic self-devotion in ministering medically and spiritually to cholera patients, when that disease raged in the parish. Sandy MacHomash died about a year before the Disruption, but his example remained, and good men continued to follow in his steps; so that the people of Fearn were conscious of no change of principle when they recognized the Free Church at the Disruption as the true Church of Scotland, and hardly of any change of position in adhering to it; on the contrary, they rejoiced in being able now to carry out more advantageously their long, practical protest. The Free Church congregation had virtually been already formed; it comprised almost the whole population of the parish; and they at once sought among the adhering probationers of the Church for a pastor whom they could receive as from the Lord. Such a one they found in John Macdonald.\n\nHe was born at Dingwall in 1808; was parish schoolmaster of Dunnet, in Caithness, at the time of the Disruption; adhered to the Free Church, notwithstanding several offers of presentations to vacant livings; and having within a few months received the call to Fearn, was ordained on the 14th day of December 1843, in the open air, under a hurricane of wind, which did not, however, prevent the gathering of a large crowd to the solemn service. From that time forward he passed his ministerial life among his people. The congregation was what Dr. Chalmers would have judged a healthily constituted one, comprising almost all classes of society; and he won the esteem of all. He was himself one of the most loving and genial of men, and, being by grace one of the most humble, was altogether indisposed to quarrelsomeness or self-assertion; and this, combined with the sound evangelical character of his teaching (cast in the old Scottish type), with his solemn and affectionate pulpit manner and evident solicitude for the salvation of his people, with his laboriousness also as a faithful pastor, his practical sympathy in his people’s sorrows and joys, and his loving interest in the young, whose religious and educational welfare he constantly promoted, endeared him to his flock, until they came to regard him as their beloved father. This feeling was certainly not diminished among the great majority of them by his steady conservatism of old religious customs, which had contributed to the promotion of vital religion in the district for generations, against unnecessary and unwise innovations. Even the few Established Churchmen in the parish shared with his own people, and with the people of the surrounding district, in their feelings of esteem and love. A week after his last communion, at a prayer-meeting, he addressed a number of his people for the last time from the Twenty-third Psalm, thus closing his public ministry with the words, “I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.” His illness, which was frequently very severe, lasted for six weeks; again and again he expressed to his beloved family his longing to go home; and he finally took leave of them, with the apostolic benediction, on the 2nd day of August 1880. He has left a widow and six children, one of whom is a young minister of promise in the Presbyterian Church of Victoria.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nJOHN MACDONALD, KINLOCH, LEWIS\n\n(Died February 14, 1896)\n\nAuthor: Rev. Donald J. Martin, Stornoway\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly, October, 1896, Obituary, p.255\n\nMr. Macdonald was born at Knockchollie, in the parish of Kiltarlity, Inverness-shire, in September 1845. His father, William Macdonald, was married to Margaret Mackenzie, of the Mackenzies of Kinneries in the same parish, known in generations past for their piety. Born of pious parents, and early yielding to their religious influences, it may be said of him that from his youth he knew the Holy Scriptures. Not, however, until he had outgrown boyhood did he undergo that saving change without which there is no seeing the kingdom of God. He had been for a time deeply concerned about the nature of true repentance, and earnestly seeking it. A sermon on Christ, “exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and remission of sins,” was the means of showing him that repentance could only be reached through faith in Jesus, and that the Christ who died for him was the giver and worker of true repentance. So was he led into the peace of the gospel and shortly thereafter resolved to enter the ministry. With a view to this he resumed his studies, and attended the High School of Inverness for some time preparatory to entering on his university course. He entered the University of Glasgow in 1870, and afterwards studied at the Free Church College of that city. Thereafter he crossed over to Canada, where he was licensed in 1870. In February 1880 he received a unanimous call to Dundas, Prince Edward’s Island. In 1882 he was called, again unanimously to Cowbay. Cape Breton, where he laboured until his return to Scotland in 1885. On November 11, 1885, he was inducted into the then new charge of Kinloch, Lewis, where he laboured till his death, on February 14, 1896.\n\nIn Canada, as at home, Mr. Macdonald endeared himself to both his people and his presbytery. When the news of his death reached there it cast a gloom over the parts of the country where he was known. He was equally beloved and respected in his home charge. His preaching was more of the edifying than the rousing kind, and his ministrations were of the sort that grow upon the hearers. Solid, sound, and earnest, his discourses were greatly appreciated by the intelligent and the interested, and his people became increasingly attached to him, for his preaching was thoroughly backed up by daily practice. He lived out what he preached. During his ministry in Kinloch there were times of very special spiritual blessing, and since his decease several have expressed their indebtedness to him in spiritual things. He took a special interest in the young, both as regards day-school and Sabbath-school instruction. The church was a long distance—two miles at least—from his residence; By his own exertions and those of his wife a suitable manse was built close by the church, and none rejoiced more than he did in the proximity of the new manse to the church, as affording him more time and strength for Sabbath work amongst the young. Of this he availed himself, and during his last winter he held a large Bible class, to the teaching of which he gave much time and pains. His last year was marked by increasing earnestness in his work and anxiety for his people’s spiritual welfare. There was none of our ministers more respected, and by his brethren he was simply loved. To know him was to love him; and this regard grew with years, for Mr. Macdonald’s great power was the power of personal worth. In character he was a Nathanael; and though in his congregational work he had much to try and vex him, he never was heard to utter a severe sentence against or pass a harsh judgment on any, not even on those at whose hands he most suffered. And all this with great firmness of character and strength of individual conviction and purpose. Amidst all the turmoil and struggles of the land agitation, of which his own district was a distinct centre, he managed to maintain a thoroughly independent position, and to retain, amidst many severe strains, the confidence and esteem of both rich and poor. He was one of Nature’s gentlemen; a hater of meanness and falsehood; a lover of good and true men. He died as he had lived—at peace with God and man. A large concourse accompanied his remains to their last resting-place in Laxay graveyard; for at his own dying request he was buried amongst those to whom he had ministered for over ten years, whom he had loved, and who in turn had learned to love him. His widow, his people, and his presbytery mourn his loss, and it will be many a long day before the blank made by the absence of the kindly, genial, courteous presence of our late friend will be unfelt among us.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. JOHN MACDONALD, CALCUTTA\n\nThe Free Church Magazine, November, 1847, p.360\n\nlt is our melancholy duty to record the decease of this devoted missionary, which took place at Calcutta early on the morning of Wednesday, the 1st of September last. Mr. Macdonald was attacked by intermittent fever on the Thursday previous to his death. So late as the afternoon of the day preceding that sad event, no fear of a fatal termination to the illness was entertained, but “coma” and stupor supervened, in consequence of pressure on the brain. Medical aid, though affectionately and assiduously employed, was unavailing. Without a struggle or a sigh, he breathed his last on the morning which we have mentioned.\n\nMr. Macdonald was born at Edinburgh in the year 1807, when his father, Dr. Macdonald of Ferintosh, was the pastor of the Gaelic population in the metropolis. After finishing his preparatory studies, he entered as a student at Aberdeen, in the year 1821, where he was distinguished not less by his exemplary character than by his high attainments as a scholar. He secured by competition certain of the honours there which decide the standing of the students much like the exercises which decide the order of merit among the Wranglers in England; and among the wranglers of Aberdeen, John Macdonald was the Senior of his year.\n\nHe was licensed to preach the gospel in the year 1829; but even before that time he had begun the work in which he ever after delighted, and in prosecuting which he died — the work of winning souls to Christ. From the time that grace took possession of his heart, and transformed it, his chief joy lay in spreading the savour of the Redeemer’s name; and almost contemporaneously with his conversion, he formed the resolution of becoming a missionary to the heathen — a sphere of labour from which he was never wholly diverted, although, in the providence of God, events occurred which prevented him for some time from carrying his purpose into effect. During a residence in the neighbourhood of Elgin, about the period to which we now refer, from which he ever dated his conversion, his strong predilections to evangelistic work first showed themselves; and it was there, we believe, that he first became the means of reclaiming sinners from the error of their ways. So holy aud peculiar was the deportment of the young Christian there, that not a few still remember him with affection, aud bless God for his labours. His first production, “The Suffering Saviour” — a tract of exquisite beauty, and running over with Christian affection, though bearing the marks of the author’s youthfulness — was written for the good of a Sabbath-school which he kept at Pluscarden, in Morayshire.\n\nIn the year 1831, Mr. Macdonald was invited to minister for a season to a Scotch congregation then assembling in Chadwell Street, London, but subsequently worshipping in a new church erected in River Terrace, Islington. This visit ended in a call; and he laboured among the people of his first charge till the period of his sailing for India. We cannot tarry to detail the principles and views, as we have often heard them narrated by himself, with which the Scottish stripling entered on his labours in the metropolis of Britain. Once, when enjoying with him a sail on the Thames, he described his emotions at the first sight of London from the river, as the sphere of his future labours, in his own graphic way, by stating, that if he were sure he had God’s command to lift Ben Nevis, he would proceed to do it, looking to the Commander for strength; and in that spirit he entered on his labours in London. He continued there for a period of five or six years; that is, till he embarked for India in 1837. His labours extended not merely to his own flock, who were attached to him in a way that scarcely ever was equalled, but spread in one sense over the whole of the metropolis; and literally, wherever he found an open door he entered, and preached the gospel there. He co-operated largely with Mr. Nasmyth in forming the city mission. In large printing establishments, in mews, in breweries, in Magdalene asylums, in hospitals, as well as in churches and chapels, John Macdonald was instant in season and out of season in preaching the gospel to sinners. Nay, he did not confine his labours even to these spheres, all unwonted as they are. He had a station under the wall of the Coldbath Prison, in the field, where he once in each week addressed the loungers in what was then an open space. Other districts of the metropolis received similar visits; and there the young apostle might be seen, in his own placid manner, and most benignant tones and looks, beseeching men to be reconciled unto God. With no covering but the blue sky, and no companion but Him who said, “Lo, I am with you alway,” did John Macdonald go forth from day to day to these open-air preachings, literally spending and being spent in the work.\n\nIt will readily be supposed that he was grieved in his spirit at the extent of Sabbath desecration witnessed in London. To mitigate the wretchedness that flowed from it, as far as he could, Mr. Macdonald adopted the practice of resorting on the Sabbath mornings to the Farringdon, and other markets — at the earliest hour at which the people flocked to them; and there on the morning of the Lord’s-day, as under the Coldbath Prison walls and elsewhere throughout the week, this Christian indeed might be seen holding forth the word of life to the perishing around him. In his Lord’s name, he arrested them in the very act of violating his commandments, and sought, by the Spirit’s blessing, to reclaim them to holiness and God. Nor was he without success. We have seen the fruits of his labours, though we know not whether such things ever came to his knowledge —but his works will follow him.\n\nEven while thus engaged, Mr. Macdonald had not withdrawn his mind from the foreign missionary field. On the contrary, while he was unconsciously in course of preparation for occupying it with advantage and effect, he was from time to time revolving the important subject. To an observer of Providence so judicious and intelligent as he was, incidents were frequently occurring to fix his attention on heathen lands, and sometimes he was so exercised in spirit on the subject, that he feared his God might have a controversy with him for duty declined or delayed. Often was he on the eve of offering himself to various missionary bodies—to be instantly employed in the work; and these proceedings were spread over a period of four or five years. Neither presentations to parishes at home — of which he was offered more than one — nor what he called a “ready-made popularity” in his native land, ever lured him away from the great object of his heart’s desire and prayer — the preaching of the gospel to the heathen.\n\nDr. Duff’s visit to this country was the means of deciding him, about the yearl836. The fervent appeals of that devoted man brought matters to a crisis in Mr. Macdonald’s mind — or rather, they put the machine in motion which had previously been all constructed. A correspondence with the committee in Edinburgh, begun on their part, ended in Mr. Macdonald’s appointment as a missionary minister to Calcutta. The steps by which that was effected, and his reasons for accepting the call, we need not detail. Be it enough to say, that they were such as to silence, if not convince, one of the most loving and beloved congregations within the bounds of the universal Church. So holy and heavenly were the principles on which Mr. Macdonald acted, that his flock felt they durst not offer objections to his going; and though some other parties spoke of the proceedings in a tone and spirit on which subsequent events have thrown enough of light, yet none that were capable of appreciating high principle combined with a devotedness that was self-sacrificing, and had learned in spirit aud in truth to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified, but must have admired the calm intrepid zeal with which that devoted minister addressed himself to the work to which he believed that he was called of God. He sailed for India in the autumn of 1837, so that he has laboured there for just ten years. Previous to his embarkation, he was married to Miss Anne Mackenzie, a lady of respectable family in Ross-shire, and who has proved in all respects an help-mate for such a servant of God.\n\nHis labours in India we cannot trace — indeed, it is unnecessary. He transferred to the heathen and to godless Europeans there the same yearning affection and devoted zeal as had signalized him in London. In the pulpit, in the missionary Institution, and by the press, he laboured in season and out of season, in the work to which he was devoted. At the period of the Disruption, he was the very first of the devoted band in India to proclaim his adherence to the principles which were then contended for, and are now secured by the Free Church of Scotland. He never could understand how any Christian in this country could fail to see, or seeing, to be influenced in the whole soul by these principles. They formed to a large extent the life of his ministry, and no doubt, had the majority of the Church been allowed to falter, as they would have done had they been left to human strength, he would at once have severed his connection with us, and transferred his services to a body with a sounder constitution. Some of the most influential members of the Free Church in Calcutta were attracted to study, and prevailed on to embrace, the peculiar tenets of the Free Church of Scotland, by the singular holiness and the beautiful consistency of his life. In a word, in India, as in Scotland and England, this servant of Christ was about his Master’s work; and like others recently departed to their home and their rest, his transition was a gentle one — a translation rather than a death.\n\nOther opportunities may be taken to draw attention at once to the published works and the evangelistic labours of Mr. Macdonald. We have glanced already at the latter, and in regard to the former, he was the author of a volume of discourses and addresses, with the title, “A Pastor’s Memorial.” He edited Brown of Wamphray’s treatise, entitled “The Hope of Glory,” to which he prefixed a striking preface. In 1842, he edited “Isobar Hood’s Memoir and Manuscript” a most interesting memorial of a Christian woman in humble life, rendered yet more attractive by the interspersed sentiments of the editor. He was also one of the conductors of the Calcutta Free Churchman — an able periodical; and separate publications on the theatre, duelling, and kindred vices, emanated from his unwearied mind, in the hope of repressing their prevalence in the East. He has also published some detached sermons; and when we consider the enervating effects of the climate in the East, with his constant employments as a missionary and a minister, it is not the least surprising portion of his history, to record how much he wrote and published.\n\nBut his labours are for ever at an end. His Lord was with him on earth, and he has gone to be for ever with his Lord in heaven. All eulogy and panegyric he would shun, for humility was one of his most notable graces; yet the truth may be told — it should be told, to the glory of that life-giving Spirit who made him what he was. By nature he was gentle and reserved. His mind was exquisitely balanced in all its various powers, rather than signally pre-eminent in any, although the result of the whole was decided mental vigour. When he became a new creature in Christ Jesus (and none ever made a more decided transition than he, gentle and amiable as he was by nature), all the natural loveliness of his character was immeasurably enhanced. His faith was of the simplest, and therefore of the strongest kind. Love was the predominating grace in his soul. He was at all times cheerful, and even joyous as a Christian; so that in his case, Religion ever appeared in her most attractive forms. He was everywhere a Christian — a Christian minister; for, even in his most ordinary doings, it was his habit to remember whose and what he was. As a preacher, he was solemn and winning — the arrows which he shot at the sinner’s heart, being winged with love, penetrated and subdued, when a bolder marksman might have caused a revulsion; and in preaching to the people of God, he showed how well be had been trained by the Shepherd of Israel to guide them to the green pastures, and by the still waters. In prayer, the spirit of adoption pervaded all his sentiments; and yet his awe of soul in that exercise awed even the careless into a kind of sympathetic reverence for the duty, if not toward God. In brief, whether we think of a bereaved mission deprived of one of its sagest counsellors and most devoted members — of a widowed partner mourning over the delight of her eyes taken away with a stroke — of his seven fatherless children, among whom there are twins, Thomas Chalmers and Robert Gordon — or the Church of Christ, deprived of one of its holiest ministers — we must equally deplore his departure. But his work was done; and while we acquiesce in the award of the Supreme, be it ours to be followers of those who, through faith and patience, are now inheriting the promises.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. MURDOCH MACDONALD, LOGIE-EASTER\n\n(Died June 24, 1892)\n\nAuthor: Rev. John MacCallum, Kincardine\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly, September, 1892, Obituary, p.228\n\nMr. Macdonald was born in the island of Lewis, in the parish of Barvas, on the 24th of June 1811. His father was a farmer in comfortable circumstances, and was desirous that at least one of his sons should serve God in the ministry of the gospel.\n\nAt a very early period of his life Mr. Macdonald came under serious impressions, and was in the habit of retiring to a cave in the vicinity, for reading the Word of God, meditation, and prayer. His aptitude for learning, his thoughtful turn of mind, and his piety, disposed his father to have him educated for the work of the ministry. This he did not live to see, for he died in the prime of life, but bequeathed to his son the means necessary for prosecuting his studies, which he did first at Stornoway, and then at Inverness.\n\nFor a time, prior to his entering the university, he taught a school in the parish of Cross, where the late Rev. John Macrae was then minister. Between them a friendship sprung up that did not end while life lasted.\n\nAfter entering the Hall, Mr. Macdonald succeeded the Rev. Donald Murray as Inspector of the Gaelic Schools, and in this important work he continued for nine years, acquiring experience and knowledge, which afterwards proved very service-able to him—and also preaching the word of God in the different districts he visited. At the Hall he had the great benefit of the teaching of Drs. Cunningham, Duncan, Buchanan, and Black. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Lewis, and received a unanimous call from the Free Church congregation of Logie-Easter, which he accepted. There he was ordained in October 1853, and there he laboured faithfully and with great acceptance for the space of thirty-seven years. He preached “the word” clearly and faithfully. He was much respected by his own and neighbouring congregations as a faithful and able minister of the New Testament; and his services were in much request and greatly appreciated on sacramental occasions throughout the north. As a member of Presbytery, he was regular in his attendance, took a lively interest in all the business of the Court and Church in general, and towards his brethren studied the things that make for peace and edification. He was a loving man, and his love was cordially reciprocated by his brethren. He was affectionate and dutiful as a husband and father, and had the satisfaction of seeing his children begin their course in life in a manner fitted to inspire good hope that their lives will exemplify the Scripture declaration, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he shall not depart from it.” As might have been hoped for in the case of a man of his character and principles, who lived in the enjoyment of the divine favour, his closing days were full of comfort, and “his latter end was peace.”\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. ROBERT MCDONALD, BLANTYRE\n\n(Died October 20, 1881)\n\nAuthor: Rev. James Laing, M.A., Stonehouse\n\nSource: The Free Church Monthly, August 1, 1882, Brief Biographies, p.230\n\nMr. McDonald was born in the West Indies in the year 1825, and was the son of Major (now Colonel) McDonald of the 93rd Highlanders, a gentleman of the greatest worth, and an elder in the Established Church of Scotland. Like most men who have attained to positions of usefulness, especially in the Church of Christ, he had a mother of the most eminent piety, who seems to have largely moulded his youthful life with the power of vital religion. At an early age he removed to Canada, where he was for some time engaged in business; but although he was offered a partnership in a large and wealthy house, and had thus before him the almost certain prospect of great success in the commercial world, so strong and decided were his religious convictions that he made up his mind to devote himself to earnest study with a view to the work of the holy ministry.\n\nOn his father’s return to Scotland with his regiment, Mr. McDonald accompanied him, and began his studies in the University of Glasgow, in which he was recognized as one of the ablest and most successful students of his class, especially in the departments of logic and moral philosophy. To this fact is to be attributed the close, compact, and clear argumentation which afterwards characterized his pulpit discourses, as also the acumen of mental discrimination and accuracy of moral distinction which they displayed.\n\nHis studies in Arts past, he took his theological classes in the New College, Edinburgh, and gained a very high place of esteem and honour among his contemporaries, all of whom speak of him as one of the most vigorous and original thinkers of his course.\n\nHe was licensed by the Presbytery of Glasgow, and shortly after became minister at Blantyre, labouring there most assiduously for twenty-one years. With his fine gifts of head and heart, his strong constitution and active habits under the influence of a scrupulous conscientiousness in the discharge of all duty, he exhibited a beautiful combination of the preacher and the pastor, while a notable feature of his ministerial life was an ardent devotion to evangelistic work, into which he threw all his energies with a system and a spirit which powerfully enlisted the sympathy and co-operation of others, so that few congregations were better equipped than his, in this most important branch of Christian life and work.\n\nHis preaching was pre-eminently thoughtful, earnest, evangelical, practical, and withal attractive, bespeaking great natural ability, high culture, refined taste, freshness of thought, rare spiritual insight, and deep personal experience of the truth and power of the grand eternal verities he proclaimed. During the later years of his ministry it became highly spiritual, unctional, impressive, and instructive. This was very marked, and was spoken of wherever he officiated. After the lapse of a considerable time he assisted the writer of this notice in a series of special services a few months before his death, and all were struck with a deepened savour of holiness on his part, and a richer, sweeter realization of the mediatorial fulness of Christ. He seemed to be preaching as if from the border-land of heaven, with its light and glory already falling on him.\n\nIn private, Mr. McDonald was at once the Christian and the gentleman. He was modest almost to a fault. Indeed, had it not been for an innate modesty of a very peculiar character, he could and would have taken rank among the foremost of our ministers both in the pulpit, at the Presbytery, and on the platform. The entire absence, however, of the power of self-assertion unfitted him for rising to the place to which his abilities entitled him, and hence he was comparatively little known beyond his own immediate sphere of labour.\n\nToward the end of August last three members of his family were seized with blood-poisoning; and although they recovered so far as that the doctor advised him to go on his holidays, according to previous arrangements, he was soon recalled to the death-bed of one of them—a sweet girl of five years, to whom he was very much attached.\n\nImmediately after her funeral, he again returned to the coast with his whole family; but scarce three days elapsed when he began to show symptoms of the same disease, and after lingering on for five weeks, he succumbed to it on the morning of the 20th October.\n\nAbout a week before his death, he said to his wife that he would like to live a little longer for her and the children’s sake, as also for the sake of his congregation, adding, however, that if it was the will of God to take him away he was prepared to go. After this he was constantly praying for her and his family and congregation. When he became fully conscious that death was not far off, he remarked to Mrs. McDonald that God had service for him in another world, and that he felt his work was in a sense but beginning. He made her promise that when she saw him dying she would gather all the family around him and sing the twenty-third psalm, as also the hymn—\n\n“The cross! the cross! the blood-stained cross!\n\nThe hallowed cross I see,\n\nReminding me of precious blood\n\nThat once was shed for me.”\n\nOn the Thursday of his death he repeated the request, and accordingly the twenty-third psalm was sung, or rather sobbed out by breaking hearts. At the close he whispered, “That will do. That psalm I love and know well;” then, turning his head gently on the pillow, he gave, a slight quiver, and breathed his last without a single pang.\n\nMr. McDonald has left a widow and five children.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. ROBERT MACDONALD, D.D.\n\n(Died August 21, 1893)\n\nAuthor: Rev. Norman L. Walker, D.D.\n\nSource: The Free Church Monthly, May, 1894, Obituary, p.149\n\nIn Dr. Macdonald the last of the great actors in the Disruption struggle has passed away. Chalmers, by organizing the Sustentation Fund, enabled the Free Church to assume national dimensions, and to maintain ministers in the poorest districts of the country; Guthrie, in his Manse Scheme, gave additional security to our tenure of the districts which we occupied; while Macdonald, by establishing a nonconformist School System throughout the length and breadth of the land, gave an extraordinary impulse to education in Scotland, and contributed materially to the securing of that great Educational Act which has helped us to regain our ancient place among the nations of the earth.\n\nDr. Macdonald was born at Perth in 1813. After attending the Academy there he went to St. Andrews University, and from thence proceeded to Edinburgh, where he took his divinity course under Welsh and Chalmers.\n\nIt is said that, to begin with, Chalmers thought he himself had gifts which qualified him to be a military engineer. Macdonald also had his early aspirations—he wanted to be a soldier; but the death of his elder brother and of his father made a profound impression on his mind while he was in his second year at college, and his thoughts became finally turned in the direction of the ministry.\n\nAfter receiving license he spent something approaching to a year as minister of Logiealmond, a place which, like East Kilbride, has been rather famous as a stepping-stone in the career of notable men. But he was soon called to an important parish. In 1837 he was, with the cordial approval of the parishioners, presented by Mr. Oliphant of Gask to the parish of Blairgowrie, and in the same year he entered on the remarkable ministry which he fulfilled there.\n\nThe time, as we all know, was a stirring one. That revived interest in the Church and its work which had issued three years before in the passing of the Veto Act was affecting in a lively way those younger ministers who had come under the spell of Chalmers; and, as it happened, within no great distance of one another several men were settled whose earnestness and activity made them by-and-by well known throughout all the country. Among these were Macdonald of Blairgowrie, Milne of Perth, Andrew Bonar of Collace, and McCheyne of Dundee. The intimacy of Macdonald and McCheyne was very great. McCheyne was groomsman at Macdonald’s marriage. They often assisted each other at communion and other seasons, and frequent letters passed between them. They were of one mind and one heart in regard to all religious and ecclesiastical matters; and it was because there were so many of their class in the van of the great movement which culminated in the Disruption that so many of the best people of Scotland were found in the Free Church when the crisis of 1843 arrived.\n\nOne of the longest letters given in the biography of McCheyne was addressed to Dr. Macdonald. It was written on Carmel, and contains an account of the visit of the deputation to Jerusalem and to Sychar. In speaking of Sychar, Mr. McCheyne refers to the well-known incident of Dr. Andrew Bonar dropping his Bible into Jacob’s well. That Bible was afterwards recovered by Dr. Wilson of Bombay and restored to the owner; and it was a touching sight to see Dr. Bonar very long after bringing this precious relic out of his bosom and showing it to the meeting he was addressing. Our impression is that that meeting was on the occasion of Dr. Macdonald’s jubilee. If not then, there was certainly at that time exhibited another relic of the friend whom they had both loved —McCheyne’s walking-stick, which had been lost and found somewhere in the Holy Land.\n\nDuring the five or six years which elapsed between his induction and 1843, Dr. Macdonald made his mark in Blairgowrie and in the Church. He preached with extraordinary vivacity and power; his prayers were as bright and, one might almost say, as ringing as his preaching; his doctrine was intensely and warmly evangelical; and his church soon became so crowded that seats could not be secured in it. But he was not content with filling the pulpit. He took quite an unusual interest in the young, and for nineteen years he continued the habit of spending forty minutes every Sabbath in catechizing all the children of the Sunday school. We have heard him more than once describe this service, which he spoke of as even more remunerative in a spiritual sense than the ordinary diets of worship; and it has often seemed to us that this is a branch of work which many ministers are neglecting to their own serious hurt. There are men, we know, who never enter their own Sabbath schools from year’s end to year’s end. It is a fatal mistake, and no excuse can be offered for it; because, as one reads of what was done in earlier days, one blushes to think of what some are now content to regard as the limit of their daily labour. Might not something be done to revive the decaying second service in our churches by the minister devoting more attention to the instruction of the young?\n\nIt was not, however, in Blairgowrie alone that Dr. Macdonald made his influence felt before 1843. His name, even by that time, was noised abroad throughout the Church, and we have a distinct recollection of his being followed in Edinburgh wherever he was announced to preach. His light hair, his fresh complexion, and the sunny expression of his face attracted people to him, and the joyous spirit in which he proclaimed the gospel added greatly to the interest and power of his discourses.\n\nWhen the Disruption came, Dr. Macdonald had, of course, no difficulty in retiring from the Establishment. He had, in common with his brethren, to relinquish his church, his manse, his glebe, his stipend, and his official status. But his distinguishing feature was his faith, his confidence in God; and having had clearly pointed out to him, as he believed, what the will of the Lord was, he did not hesitate for a moment as to the propriety of going forward. And, happily, his faith was not long in calling forth a response. Almost all his people went out with him. A tent was immediately provided by a friend in which the worship of God could be continued. The building of a Free church, capable of holding many more people than that which he had left, was set about at once. He soon was provided with a beautiful manse; his stipend rose far beyond what seemed possible at the Disruption; while his status in the community was elevated to a far higher point by his consistent piety and the noble simplicity of his life. Thus his ministry, after the crisis was over, was continued with new heart and under better conditions.\n\nSoon, however, he was to move out of the provincial position which he had hitherto occupied, and to take a more conspicuous part in the public business of the Church.\n\nIt is not very pleasant, although it is very instructive, to recall what foolish things were done by the Established Church at the time of the Disruption. Its leaders and advisers seem to have shared the convictions of the lairds that the Free Church movement was a summer flood which would soon be over. In this belief they, among other things, tried to make it impossible for any Free Churchman to take any share in the education of the country. They drove the teachers who went out from the parish and other schools, and they did their best to render it impossible for any Free Churchman to be a professor in any of our universities. And what has been the consequence? It is this, that at the present moment the Established Church has no connection whatever with the national schools and comparatively little with the universities. If they had acted more wisely and in a more generous spirit it is absolutely certain that the cry for the abolition of university tests would not have arisen so soon, and that those steps would never have been taken by the Free Church which secured the passing of the Education Act under which we are now living.\n\nThe subject of providing schools as well as churches for the outgoing people was formally brought before the Disruption Assembly of 1843. Already it was known that a number of teachers were joining the Free Church, and that they were to be compelled to resign their livings. To provide for them was recognized as a manifest duty, and an Education Scheme accordingly became a necessity. But how was a new framework to be constructed? By an annual collection, incomes of some kind might be obtained; but what about the schools in which the teachers were to carry on their work, or the houses in which they were to dwell? It was a great and a grave question, and in reading about its solution one does not know whether most to admire the faith and ingeunity of the proposal for meeting it, or the courage and intrepidity with which the scheme was carried out. The Glasgow Assembly of 1843 came round. Mr. Lewis of Leith gave in the Education Report. From it, it appeared that, so far as the returns showed, at least 300 teachers had joined the Free Church. Of these 80 were parochial schoolmasters, 57 had been maintained by the Assembly, and 27 had received their support from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. Whatever might happen to others, there could be no doubt about the fate of the latter two classes. It soon transpired that the whole of them were to be cast on their own resources. The Church was face to face with one of its most stupendous undertakings. And here Mr. Macdonald of Blairgowrie stepped in. He undertook, by a process which he explained, to raise £50,000, and his offer of personal service was accepted without, it must be confessed, much enthusiasm or hope. But be was freed for a time from his charge. For a number of months he travelled the country, making his appeals to the people; and when the Assembly of 1844 came round, he was able to report subscriptions to the amount of £52,000. Largely by means of this fund schools were built all over Scotland, and the interests of education were at the same time greatly promoted. But more than that, when the Government addressed itself to the business of more adequately providing for the educational wants of the people, the position which the Free Church had secured made it necessary that it should be consulted; and, as has been already said, the Act which was passed would not have been what it is but for the shortsightedness of the Established Church and the noble enterprise of Dr. Macdonald. In 1857 Dr. Macdonald accepted a call to North Leith, where, as in Blairgowrie, the blessing of God continued to rest upon his ministry. The congregation increased under his oversight from 450 to 1,100 members, and the old church gave place to one of the handsomest structures in Edinburgh or its neighbourhood. But he did not confine his interest to his own flock. He took a large share in the general work of the Church; and it is somewhat notable that while his friends the Bonars and Dr. Moody Stuart all ranged themselves against the union with the United Presbyterian Church, he was heartily and even enthusiatically in its favour.\n\nThe honours he had earned came rather late to him. It was only in 1870 (after he had been thirty-three years in the ministry) that he received from his alma mater, St. Andrews, the degree of D.D., and it was not till 1882 that he was raised to the chair of the General Assembly. But he was not an ambitious man, and this slow recognition of his services may have been felt as a grievance by his friends, certainly not by himself.\n\nMy own earliest recollection of him is at a casual meeting of ministers in the house of Mr. Milne of Perth. It was proposed that we should have prayer together, and Dr. Macdonald was asked to lead. I shall never forget the impression then produced. One felt at once that here was a man who was well accustomed to pray, and who delighted in the exercise. There was a joyous confidence in the supplications which showed a persuasion that He to whom he was speaking was willing to give, and a fulness and freedom of utterance which spoke of a loving heart and a rich spiritual experience. In after years I had much pleasant intercourse with him, and I ought always to remember with gratitude that it was by him largely that I was encouraged to make use of the pen, which has been so much to me in life.\n\nHe wrote most on the page of the human heart. It was the saintliness of his life, the joyousness of his Christianity, his unfaltering faith, his hopefulness, his benignity and loving sweetness of disposition, that won for him the affection of so many, and will ever make his name fragrant to those who knew him. But his book From Day to Day will live, both in the original English form and in the various translations, and keep his name from being forgotten.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. WILLIAM MACDONALD, BALLAHULISH\n\n(Died May 13, 1876)\n\nAuthor: Rev John Kennedy, D.D., Dingwall\n\nThe Free Church Monthly December 1, 1876, p.300\n\nThe Rev. William Macdonald, Ballahulish, died on the 13th of May last. His death was the close of a life of conscientious labour and of patient suffering. Naturally modest and reserved, having learned, through looking on Jesus’ glory, that the Master alone deserveth praise, and quietly labouring in a secluded sphere, he was never much in the eye of the public, and was known only in a section of his Church. But such a name as his should not be left by others in the obscurity in which it was his choice to hide it, and is worthy of a place in the record of the men who served the Lord in the gospel as ministers of the Free Church of Scotland.\n\nBorn in the parish of Urray, Ross-shire, educated in the parish school there, licensed to preach the gospel by the Presbytery of Dingwall, he was, in 1867, ordained and inducted as the Free Church minister of Ballahulish and Glencoe. His health, never robust, was soon broken by his arduous labours in that his first and only charge. Having two preaching stations, he was often exposed to drenching rains, and was often jaded by long walks. After a few years of such work, symptoms of consumption began to appear; but in growing weakness he struggled on, attempting to perform all the services which made up the labour of healthier days. But he was soon compelled to escape for rest to a more genial climate. His disease, however, made sure, though insidious, progress, and with but little strength left in his wasted frame, he returned to Edinburgh, and pined on a sick-bed there till he died.\n\nDuring his last illness, he looked with calmness to his approaching death, and with hopefulness beyond it to the rest of the Father’s house, “continuing instant in prayer,” his sense of mercy often bursting into songs of praise, and still taking an unselfish interest in those who kindly ministered to him, and in the welfare of his family, of his flock, and of his church. One of his last prayers was,— “Lord, we are weak, but thou art strong. Deliver us from sin, its pollution, dominion, and consequences. Make us trophies of divine grace. Be with all our friends here and everywhere. May they be thy redeemed, trophies of thy grace.” After a fit of unusual pain, he exclaimed, “The Lord shall soon give me a triumphant entrance into glory.” His last words on the Saturday evening on which he died were, “I am tired. Is it Sabbath? The rest for which he pined his longing spirit found that night in heaven, and his worn and wearied body found it in the sleep of death.\n\nAmiable and modest as a man, devout and humble as a Christian, clear and solemn as a preacher, and assiduous, faithful, and kindly as a pastor, he was one of the Lord’s gifts to the Free Church; and though early recalled by his Master, He had given him some fruit of his labour which shall be to his joy for ever. His youthful wife, who so helped to brighten his last years of life, and whose affectionate tenderness he so often gratefully acknowledged, still survives, with two little boys, whom, with their mother, he who went away left in charge of Him who “relieveth the fatherless and widow.”\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. ARCHIBALD MACDOUGALL, ARGYLL CHURCH, GLASGOW\n\n(Died March 28, 1883)\n\nAuthor: Rev. John Isdale, Glasgow\n\nSource: The Free Church Monthly, June 1, 1883, Brief Biographies, p.181\n\nMr. Macdougall was a native of Tarbert on Loch Fyne; and after occupying several situations as a teacher, and attending college both cin Glasgow and Edinburgh, he was licensed as a probationer by the Presbytery of Edinburgh in the year 1842.\n\nIn 1843, he was ordained to the ministry by the Presbytery of Glasgow, in connection with a new Gaelic charge, a split from Hope Street, which met in what was called Kirkfield Church, Buchan Street. That was the year of the Disruption; and one very marked feature about Mr. Macdougall was his loyalty and steadfastness to the principles and cause of the Free Church. He began his ministry with about one hundred and fifty people; but such was his popularity and success, that, when Argyll Church was opened in 1847, it was nearly filled to the door. And for many years did he continue to gather around him a large and crowded congregation.\n\nIn 1859, he visited Ireland during the great awakening that took place there; and such was the quickening he himself received, that, returning home, he threw himself into his work with redoubled zeal and energy. His labours at this period were beyond measure abundant, and attended with the most blessed results. Not only was the spiritual life of his congregation in a general way quickened and revived, but many still speak of them as the means by which they were brought to the knowledge of the truth. Nor was it only in his own congregation that the excellence and power of Mr. Macdougall’s ministrations were recognized. Instances could be quoted of their effect in other congregations throughout the country, where tokens of the divine blessing appeared to accompany them.\n\nThe chief feature of his preaching, while he was in his vigour, consisted in the earnestness and affectionateness with which he sought to bring home the truths of the gospel to the souls of men. This gave it its force and power. And by this, though not a great preacher in the ordinary sense of the word, he commended himself to men’s conscience in the sight of God. By any one knowing Mr. Macdougall, it was not difficult to form a correct estimate of his character. His sincerity and uprightness were quite transparent. Steadily and faithfully to do his work was what he lived for. A beautiful trait of his character was his singular modesty and humility; and altogether it was a character fitted to win affection and command respect. I can testify to these being the sentiments with which he was regarded by his brethren in the Presbytery, and, I believe, by all who really knew him. By the congregation among whom he ministered he was especially beloved; and the good seed which he sowed amongst them is still bearing fruit.\n\nFor some years before his death his health was in a declining state, and he was obliged to retire from the active work of the ministry. And now that he has gone to his reward, his life leaves behind it this lesson to us—let us faithfully use the talent God has given us, and our labour will not be in vain in the Lord.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. JOHN RICHARDSON MACDOUGALL, D.D., FLORENCE\n\n(Died January 12, 1900)\n\nAuthor: Rev. Alexander Robertson, D.D., Venice\n\nSource: The Free Church Monthly, April, 1900, Obituary, p.91\n\nBy the death of the Rev. J. R. MacDougall, D.D., which took place in the manse, Florence, on the twelfth of January, the church has lost its oldest and one of its ablest ministers on the Continent, the Italian Evangelical Church its mainstay, and the city of Florence one of its best friends.\n\nDr. MacDougall was born in Glasgow in 1831. When his school-days were over, the question of a profession came up, and, as he himself told me, his saintly mother “prayed him into the ministry.” At the early age of twenty-four he had completed with distinction both his arts course at the University of Glasgow and his theological course at the Free Church College in that city, and was licensed to preach. He then went to Brighton, where he was ordained as assistant minister in the Presbyterian church there by two well-known men—Dr. James Hamilton, with whose life the Rev. William Arnot has made us all familiar, and Principal William Chalmers. Two years’ hard work in this fashionable resort brought on the threatening of a breakdown. In order to combine rest and change with instruction, he was planning a trip to the Holy Land, when a letter reached him from Dr. John Bonar, the Continental Secretary of the Free Church, asking him to go without delay to Florence for six weeks to assist the Rev. R. M. Hanna. Mr. Hanna had gone out from Scotland to Italy for his health ten years before, in 1847, and becoming comparatively well, had, at the request of the home committee, begun Presbyterian services in Florence in 1849. Dr. MacDougall responded to the call with the promptitude of a soldier, leaving Brighton for Italy within twenty-four hours. On reaching Genoa he learned that Mr. Hanna had died. Pushing on to his destination, Dr. MacDougall at once stepped into the breach, and found at Florence not a few weeks’ occupation, but his life’s work. He was inducted to the Florence charge in June 1857, when in his twenty-fourth year; so when he died on the twelfth of January last he was in his sixty-ninth year, and had almost completed the forty-third year of his pastorate in Florence, and the forty-fifth of his ministry.\n\nDr. MacDougall’s immediate work in Florence was to maintain the Presbyterian services established by Mr. Hanna for the English-speaking residents and travellers. The Grand Duke was still on the throne of Tuscany, so there was no religious liberty, and the services had to be conducted in an “upper room.” Very soon Dr. MacDougall chose for his house, and for his “church in the house,” a building on the Lung’ Arno Guicciardini. This building he afterwards purchased and altered, turning the ground floor into a large hall adapted for public worship, and there the Scottish Church of Florence meets to this day. At first, however, Dr. MacDougall only hired some rooms in it, which were sublet to him by the tenant, who was a shoemaker. One day, some fifteen years ago, when I was walking with Dr. MacDougall in Florence, this man passed us, when he told me the following story about him and the building. When Dr. MacDougall was his tenant, urged on by the priests, he used to give trouble by having his men work noisily whilst the services were going on, and by continually raising the rent. Dr. MacDougall said nothing, but quietly went to work to raise money to buy the building, which he soon succeeded in doing. By the old laws of Tuscany, purchase cancelled all leases. This man, meeting Dr. MacDougall when the next rent was about due, said to him, “By the way, I am going to add fifty francs to your rent next term; if you do not care to pay it, you can go.” Dr. MacDougall quietly said, “I have bought the building, and it is you that must go, and that immediately.” And he went.\n\nWork amongst the Italians had been going on in Tuscany since 1845, in which year Dr. Stewart was settled in Leghorn, where there were not a few Scottish residents engaged in business, the port being more important for shipping than it is now. The work was carried on under serious difficulties, both the Scottish ministers and merchants engaged in it, and their Italian converts, exposing themselves to banishment or imprisonment. Yet the work prospered, and when Dr. MacDougall went to Florence, some ten thousand converts existed in Tuscany. Two or three years before his arrival, however, (in 1853) a law had been passed authorizing the retention in prison of Italian Protestants for a period of five years before bringing them to trial. The result was that meetings had to be almost abandoned, and reliance placed more entirely on the distribution of the Scriptures and of Christian literature. History and historic novels, like The Gadfly, tell us of the heroic exploits of Italian patriots in smuggling arms into Tuscany for the liberation of the Duchy and of the Papal States; but rivalling some of these in daring were those of the Scottish ministers and the members of their churches in introducing secretly the weapons of their spiritual warfare. Bibles and Christian books were brought in thousands in Henderson’s ships to Leghorn, landed secretly there, and carried secretly, in small quantities at a time, to Florence, which was the centre for their distribution. Into this work Dr. MacDougall threw himself with all the fervour of his Highland nature, and was eminently successful not only in putting books into the converts’ hands, but in cheering and guiding them by wise counsel. A secret printing-press existed at this time in Florence; but when, in 1859, the Grand Duke fled, and Tuscany was the next spring annexed to Piedmont, the need for secrecy ceased to exist. It was then that Dr. MacDougall conceived the idea of the Claudian Press, and was mainly instrumental in founding it, and in carrying it on for upwards of six years. This press, as is well known, exists to this day in Florence in ever-increasing vitality and usefulness, and it is the one great Protestant printing-press for Italy.\n\nFrom 1860 onward, civil and religious liberty being now the prized possession of Tuscany as of other parts of Italy (though Venice and Rome had to wait a little longer), the Italian converts could breathe freely, and pursue their work without let or hindrance. Indeed, liberty was doubly secured in Tuscany, for its head, Baron Ricasoli, next to Cavour the ablest statesman in the country, was himself almost a Protestant. Dr. MacDougall took full advantage of the changed times to help on the work. He threw open his church for Italian services, and the Waldenses, who were now in the field, used it till Dr. Stewart gave them one for themselves. Dr. MacDougall also started numerous schools both for secular and religious teaching, some of which are still carried on in Via dei Benci. From 1860 till 1870 the evangelical Italian work made splendid progress. In this latter year Dr. MacDougall founded the Chiesa Libera, in order to utilize the services of such patriots as Padre Gavazzi, who, having helped to give their country civil liberty, were now anxious to see it possess that better liberty wherewith Jesus Christ makes His people free, and for whose services no outlet existed. At its first synod, held in Milan in June 1870, he became its treasurer, and generously undertook to find it material support, he did this, and much more, as we all know, for he organized and directed the whole work of the church. It grew and prospered, until it is now one of the most vigorous bodies in Italy, recognized by the government as a moral entity, and possessing churches and mission stations in almost every quarter of the land. For the purchase of its property, Dr. MacDougall has raised in all some £40,000, whilst latterly he was raising from £6,000 to £7,000 annually for the carrying on and extension of its work. The church is now no longer known by the name Chiesa Libera but by that of The Evangelical Church of Italy. This generic name was adopted some fourteen years ago, when Dr. MacDougall made heroic efforts to unite this church with the Waldenses and other Protestant bodies in Italy. It is, I believe, the old historic name by which the original Italian Protestants were known, and it was felt that, because of this and because of its breadth and simplicity, all evangelical churches in the land might, without much sacrifice, forego their own specific provincial names for it. The hope was not realized, but the name remains a standing protest against division, and a call to union.\n\nAnother branch of work that early engaged the thoughts of Dr. MacDougall concerned itself with the city poor. Year by year, as many of his friends in Scotland know, he issued his appeal headed, “Help to the Poor in Florence.” The one for 1899 bears the words, “Twenty-second year,” and tells us, what he often said, that nothing gave him greater joy than this branch of his work. In this connection, I may say that there was no more truly hospitable home in Florence than Dr. MacDougall’s. He and his wife, to whom he was married in 1861, and his daughter, so well known in musical circles on both sides of the Atlantic as an accomplished linguist and vocalist, were “given to hospitality.” Many Scotsmen who have been to Florence, and many Americans and strangers from other lands, as well as the resident Christian workers in Italy of all churches, can witness to this.\n\nNone knew better than Dr. MacDougall that to better men’s condition they must be made better men; that no external improvement was enough: they must be made better intellectually and spiritually; they must be regenerated, converted, born again; and a desire to effect this higher improvement, a desire to convert men, characterized his life. This was what he aimed at in the establishment of the Claudian Press, from which has issued forth continuously since its opening a stream of pure, invigorating, regenerating literature. Of course the book that it was started mainly to bring out was the Bible, and on putting this into the hands of the people in whole or in portions was what Dr. MacDougall chiefly relied on for enlightening and regenerating effects. The aim I am considering was that which he also kept steadily before him in his pulpit work — the enlightening, upbuilding, and quickening of the believer, and the turning to God of the unconverted. For Dr. MacDougall knew well that the divine Word tells to greatest effect not when presented to the mind by the written page, but by the living human voice, and by a life the outcome of its influence. To read a truth in a text-book is one thing; to learn it from the lips of a teacher is another and a very different thing. Dr. MacDougall knew this, and hence for spiritual results, for conversion, for quickening, he relied mainly, under God, on his pulpit work. His preaching was intellectual, vital, spiritual, “not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.” His congregations, Sunday after Sunday, were large, composed of residents in Florence and of travellers from different countries, belonging to different sections of the Church of Christ. Dr. MacDougall, with his broad and liberal mindedness, avoiding controversial matters, preached the truth in Christ common to all believers, to the comfort and edification of all. We Continental ministers are sowers more than reapers, for many of those who are present at our services to-day are away to-morrow. Yet we too have our reaping time. As travellers in the spring and summer come north to Venice from Florence in great numbers, many a good thing have I heard said of Dr. MacDougall, and valuable testimony borne to blessings received from his ministry; and writing to me on this subject, in a letter dated June 25, 1897, he says: “I have often told my family that I only wish printed after my death a selection from the thousands of kind and generous things my hearers have said of me in their letters as to the eternal good they have got in the church.”\n\nBy Dr. MacDougall’s death his family and friends, the Presbyterian Church in Florence, the poor of that city, and the Italian Evangelical Church have all sustained a severe loss; in the case of his family, an irreparable one. Yet, in our mourning, we can rejoice that numbers in these classes and churches can, and I believe do, gladly acknowledge and confess the influence he exercised over them for the bettering of their condition, and for the comfort and inspiration—it may be, in not a few cases, for the regeneration—of their hearts and lives. Nor does his influence cease now. It is continued in the lives of others, and in the work which he has bequeathed to his successors. The words of the Bishop of Durham, used with reference to the death of Dr. Lightfoot, and applicable to that of all Christians, we feel to have a special reference here: “What is lost to the eye rises transfigured in the soul, and we come to know that when the Lord said, ‘It is expedient for you that I go away.’ He revealed a divine law, by which each bereavement, each apparent loss, becomes through His grace the source of new spiritual blessing.”\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. WILLIAM S. MCDOUGALL, FODDERTY\n\n(Died March 31, 1892)\n\nAuthor: Rev. John S. Macphail, Benbecula\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly, December, 1892, Obituary, p.301\n\nWilliam McDougall was born at Downpatrick in December 1814. His parents were Argyllshire Highlanders. The father held a Government situation in Ireland, but having fallen into broken health, he retired with his family to his native county, and became tenant of a farm in Kintyre when the son was a boy of ten. William attended the Grammar School of Campbeltown, where he received a classical education, and from there he went to Glasgow University. His first intention was to qualify for the medical profession; but it was the stirring time of the “Ten Years’ Conflict,” when many a youthful mind in Scotland was led to consider the claims of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to decide for him and for his service. Whilst studying in Glasgow, and lodging with his friend D. McEachran, now of Melbourne, he became the subject of a saving change. All true Christians are not able to fix a date as the time of their conversion; but the subject of this notice records in a brief diary that on the 9th of March 1842 he was brought by the power of the Holy Spirit as a guilty, condemned, heavy-laden soul to the foot of the cross, and was enabled to lift uo his eyes to his bleeding Saviour.\n\nIn 1846 he entered the Divinity Hall in Edinburgh, and when prosecuting his theological studies, he gave a portion of his time, especially on Saturdays, to visiting families in the Grassmarket and Cowgate. His heart was drawn out greatly in compassion for the souls of those living in such wretchedness and ignorance.\n\nWhen in Edinburgh, he sat under the searching and refreshing ministry of Mr. Charles Brown and Mr. Moody Stuart. He found the students’ Saturday morning missionary meetings, and Dr. John Duncan’s solemn addresses to students on that same morning, very helpful to him as means of quickening spiritual life. From those meetings many another student as well as William McDougall retired to the solitude of his lodgings for self-examination and prayer. Perhaps no part of their training was of such permanent value to students as what they got on the Saturday mornings in the New College.\n\nHe finished his college course in 1850, and was licensed in June of that year by the Presbytery of Skye. The Rev. Roderick McLeod, being Moderator, addressed him impressively on the work of the ministry. Immediately after being licensed, he went to the island of Raasay, and passed his year of probation there and in Sleat, Lochcarron, and Kilmuir. He believed that the Lord had owned his labours in all these places, either in the conversion of sinners or in feeding the flock of God.\n\nA most harmonious call was given him by the Raasay congregation—proprietor and people joining heartily. He saw it to be his duty to accept this call. He was ordained on the 26th November 1851. During his first year in Raasay he went to St. Kilda along with Rev. Roderick McLeod. They were appointed to dispense the Lord’s Supper there, and they had the use of the Breadalbane yacht for the occasion. His first address at a communion table was in St. Kilda, which he regarded as a striking providence. His own heart was much enlarged in speaking to these poor islanders, and there were symptoms of deep and strong feeling among the people, many tears being shed.\n\nWhen in Raasay, Mr. McDougall married Miss Mary McPhail, who was his devoted helpmate during the remainder of his life. She made his home a happy one, and by her bright, cheerful disposition sustained and helped him in his work.\n\nAfter four years of fruitful labour in his first charge, he saw it to be his duty to accept a call from Appin and Ardchattan, then a united congregation. Here he laboured with much acceptance and many tokens of God’s blessing for eleven years. From Appin he was translated to the larger and more important sphere of Fodderty and Contin in 1866. God owned his servant’s ministry there also. Some are still left who remember him with affection as their spiritual father, and many of God’s saints were fed and strengthened by his ministry. As long as he had strength he laboured assiduously in this charge. But finding himself unable, through growing infirmities, to bear the strain of so large a congregation, he applied for a colleague and successor, and upon this being granted, he retired with his family to Portobello in May 1890. His last sermons were preached in Fodderty shortly before he left there, and he chose for his texts on the occasion 1 Cor. 15:58, and 2 Cor. 13:14. In Portobello he gradually became weaker, and he peacefully slept in Jesus on 31st March 1892, in his seventy-eighth year.\n\nHis preaching was very highly prized. Those capable of judging had no difficulty in giving him a place among the foremost of our Highland ministers. He gave himself to the ministry of the word and to prayer. What he delivered in public was carefully prepared and written out, and was the result of much meditation and prayer. His preaching was remarkable, not only for its scripturalness, but for clearness, simplicity, order, tenderness, and unction. Hearers felt that he spoke what he believed, and what had first gone through himself. The godly felt that his lips fed them with the finest of the wheat. “The broken and contrite” were specially drawn to him, for they found in him one to sympathize with them, and who knew from experience what a broken and contrite heart was.\n\nHis devotional exercises were always striking, whether in the pulpit or in the family. His prayers were pervaded with a heavenly unction; there was such reverence mingled with holy confidence, one was made to feel that he was on holy ground, and that God was very near. It was his habit to spend much time alone with God, and he was much in intercession for all classes of men, and especially for the household of faith in their trials and sorrows in the wilderness.\n\nHe was an excellent teacher of the young; his Bible-classes trained up many who are now doing good service in the Church, and who cherish his memory with lively gratitude.\n\nHe was a laborious pastor, and as long as his strength allowed he went from house to house carrying his message and dealing with souls individually. He believed that this part of his ministry was not only calculated to be useful, but was much acknowledged by God.\n\nHe took no very prominent part in church courts, but he was most regular in his attendance, and his opinion on matters under discussion was always regarded with much respect by his brethren, for they had confidence in his judgment and conscientiousness. He held decided views on the many questions that have been subjects of controversy in the Free Church, but he never allowed his views to interfere with private friendship. Some of his most familiar friends took opposite sides from him, but he never judged them harshly, nor supposed that they were less conscientious than himself.\n\nHe was a man greatly beloved by a wide circle of friends, and he has left with them a very fragrant memory. “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord … that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.”\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. ANDREW McDOWALL, KIRKCOLM, WIGTOWNSHIRE\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly Record, February 1, 1865, p.735\n\nMr. McDowall was in many respects a remarkable man. In early youth, on the occasion of his father’s death, by a distinct and solemn act of dedication he gave himself to the Saviour. As the labour of his life he chose the ministry, and, like many of the most able and useful among our Scottish ministers, he had to provide by teaching for his support and education. A student of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, he was licensed by that body in 1836. In 1843 he joined the Free Church of Scotland, and shortly after undertook the charge of a Home Mission sphere in Aberdeen. He threw himself with his whole soul into his work, and still is he spoken of in that city as one whose like in missionary labour is scarcely to be found. He remembered with devout gratitude the many instances in which the Lord established the work of his hands. Called to Kirkcolm in 1849, from the day of his ordination over that remote and secluded congregation he laboured assiduously in the pulpit and from house to house. He exhorted and rebuked with all authority, and let no man despise him. Among his people his memory will be warmly cherished.\n\nHe had a thorough acquaintance with the scheme of Christian doctrine. His knowledge of the Word of God was wide, full, and familiar, and his discourses eminently Biblical.\n\nHe was a man of great energy and straightforwardness of character, and was at the same time full of soft and deep sensibilities. He was greatly beloved and esteemed by his brethren in the Presbytery, and his own family clung to him as the vine to its supporting elm.\n\nIt was beautiful to see how, through Divine grace, under the pressure of infirmity and pain he grew in meekness and patience, in firmness of faith and fulness of joy. The vicissitudes of a hard and chequered life had stamped him prematurely with the appearance of age, and he sank at last under a complication of disorders. The memory of the grace bestowed on him, and the thought of the glory he now inherits, sustain and solace the heart of his widow and children. Thankfully and joyfully may it be said of him that he was “found of God in peace.”\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. P. C. MCEACHRAN, WALLS, SHETLAND\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly Record, September 1 1868, p.210\n\nMr. McEachran was born in the parish of Kilchoman, Islay, in the year 1832. Deprived of his mother very early, he was brought up under the care of an aunt, who resided in Greenock. Having entered the University of Glasgow, he passed through the usual course of study, and was licensed to preach the gospel on the 2nd September 1862 by the Free Presbytery of Irvine.\n\nAfter preaching at several places in the west of Scotland, he came to the Shetland Isles in March 1863, and was stationed at North Yell till the close of that year. He was settled in Walls about the end of March 1864. His short ministry ended in May last.\n\nIt would appear that for many years he had not enjoyed good health, but was frequently subject to severe illness. He was induced to remain in Shetland, having experienced a measure of relief from his complaint (disease of the heart) during his residence in Yell. Though he entered on his ministry at Walls hopefully, he was all along well aware that his tenure of life on earth was held by a peculiarly brittle thread. Often did he express to those with whom he was most intimate the likelihood of his sudden removal. His last texts at Walls and Sandness— “Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom,” and “Be ye therefore ready also,” &c.—indicate the direction of his thoughts, and are a token of the gracious Master’s loving-kindness in preparing him for the solemn change so near at hand.\n\nAfter giving directions to his servant relative to his proposed journey to Edinburgh to attend the meeting of the General Assembly, he retired to rest in his usual state of health. When this faithful domestic, after repeated calls at his door in the morning, received no answer, she at length entered the room, and found the body of her beloved master still in the arms of death. He had himself realized the truths which formed the subject of his last public addresses.\n\nThose who were intimate with him had learned to value him the more they knew him. For candour, integrity, and warmth of heart, he was peculiarly distinguished. Anything like duplicity or hypocrisy he abhorred; and when his state of weakness and repeated ailments are remembered, the wonder is that he retained so much cheerfulness and buoyancy of spirit.\n\nHis visits to the sick of all denominations were earnestly desired and highly prized. For all in affliction he felt deeply. Not a few will sorely miss him for the solace and help he so cheerfully bestowed. In the pulpit his manner was earnest, and his discourses, though cast for the most part in a doctrinal mould, were strikingly impressive, and pungent in their application.\n\nOccasionally during the time of conducting divine service, he had to pause when his ailment manifested itself. The weakness to which he was reduced after his work was over affectingly showed under what difficulties he was fulfilling his course. All this was much aggravated by the peculiarly laborious nature of the Walls ministry. The Lord in mercy grant that a suitable labourer may soon be thrust forth to that remote yet very interesting corner of the vineyard.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV. JOHN McFARLAN, GREENOCK\n\n(Died December 18, 1891)\n\nAuthor: Rev. Hugh Macmillan, D.D., LL.D.\n\nThe Free Church of Scotland Monthly, March, 1892, Obituary, p.72\n\nThe subject of this short notice was born in Linlithgowshire in 1815. His father was the well-known Dr. Patrick McFarlan, whose portrait is represented in the foreground of D. O. Hill’s picture of the Disruption, as signing away one of the largest stipends in Scotland, in proof of his devotion to the cause of the Free Church.\n\nThe son, who was carefully educated at home and college, was licensed to preach in 1839. His first charge was at Monkton, in the neighbourhood of Ayr, which he occupied with great acceptance and usefulness for several years, till he was transferred to Greenock in 1854.\n\nIn this town he found a sphere which suited him in every respect, and for which he was well adapted. His congregation was large and influential, and helped him very heartily in all the departments of Christian work which they carried on together. He did not spare himself, but gave of his best to the service which he loved for the long period of four-and-twenty years; and often his strength of body and mind must have been taxed to the utmost to satisfy the many demands made upon him.\n\nMr. McFarlan always gave one the feeling of a man who was deeply in earnest, who lived the atmosphere of pious meditation and prayer, and who had a single eye for the glory of his Redeemer and the salvation of souls. He had a shy, reserved manner, arising from great distrust of himself. His speech was slow and deliberate; he had about him a constitutional calmness which strangers might not have been able at all times to penetrate to see beneath the wise mind and the warm heart. But those to whom he unveiled his inner moments of confidence knew well that under his seemingly impassive exterior there was not a little of his father’s strength of character and sanguine temperament. He appeared always like a man who held himself in leash, who had reserves of intellectual and spiritual force which he did not call forth; and this calm, slow manner of his was often most effective in giving solemnity and weight to his preaching and conversation. It had a momentum which carried his words—few and well-ordered and memorable–straight to their point and fixed them there.\n\nMr. McFarlan was a well-read and well-cultured man, and had a mind richly furnished from many sources of knowledge; and he laid all his gifts and acquirements most conscientiously upon the altar which sanctifies the gift, and used them freely and effectually in the work of the ministry. His preaching was simple, natural, and unaffected; redeemed from commonplaceness by the beauty of his thoughts, the aptness of his images, and the unction of his manner. He was an excellent teacher of the young and his Bible-class trained up many men and who have since done valuable service to the Church and who cherish with lively gratitude the memory of the happy and profitable connection. In his pastoral work he was indefatigable, visiting all the members of his congregation in their homes, in times of sickness and sorrow, but on other occasions as well, making himself their friend, to cheer them in their dark, and to share their joy in their bright, experiences. By his efforts, ably aided by the office-bearers and members, the old brick church was superseded by the present large and beautiful church in a more suitable locality; and that admirable organization was formed which has made the congregation under the former and the existing ministry so strong, so united, and so enthusiastic in carrying on their numerous successful agencies. A ministry so long continued and so devoted as his was has left behind rich and abiding results. Obliged in 1878 by the breaking down of his health to give up his much-loved work, he spent the last years of his life in retirement; and by a slow and gentle, and in the end unconscious way, he was led like a little child down the dark valley, until it opened out for him upon the green pastures and the still waters to which the Good Shepherd whom he served so faithfully and so well conducted him. He leaves behind a widow and a son and daughter to mourn their great loss, and many friends to cherish the memory of a beautiful and consistent life.\n\nReturn to Index of Obituaries Return to Top of page\n\nREV.
