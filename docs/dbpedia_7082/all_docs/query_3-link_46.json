        "text": "This index covers the Schenectady Daily Gazette for July 1899 to June 1900, July 1901 to January 1, 1903, December 16, 1992 to September 5, 1995, November 1, 1995 to November 8, 1995, January 2003 to September 7, 2003, December 2005 to July 2, 2006, January 2008 to May 7, 2008, March 2010 to August 19, 2011, 2013 to June 2, 2014, January 2015 to February 2, 2015 and January 2024 to June 13, 2024, as well as other Schenectady papers for various periods dating back to 1795 and regional papers (covering the counties of Fulton, Hamilton, Montgomery, Saratoga, Schoharie, Warren and Washington) beginning in 2000 through August 5, 2024. See the newspaper list for specific coverage.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, this index includes all obituaries and death notices (labeled DN) in the newspaper. It also includes citations to related articles. Entries without page numbers generally indicate obituaries posted to the newspaper's Web site.\n\nThe form of the index is as follows: last name, first name, maiden name in parentheses if we can verify it, newspaper code, date and page, death date if known and notes. Entries from Thomas Reimer's index to Schenectady German-language newspapers also include a column number. Entries from the New York State Department of Health Genealogical Research Death Index (marked \"DOH\") do not have an obituary date; see the newspaper list for more information.\n\nTotal citations to date: 219,162, including 54,467 added entries for maiden names, plus 177,731 entries from the NYS DOH index for a total of 396,893.\n\nIn order to minimize the confusion caused by variant spellings and spacing, the normal sorting order has been modified. Names are filed without regard to case, spacing or punctuation, Mac and Mc are filed together as Mac, and names beginning with St. are under Saint."
