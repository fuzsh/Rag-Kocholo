The position is made possible thanks to an endowed gift by the estate of Archibald McDougall.\n\nArchibald McDougall was born in 1903 in Tasmania, Australia. He was the second of six boys. Though his father, D.G. McDougall, was Professor of Law at the University of Tasmania, Archibald was the only son to attend university, becoming a Rhodes scholar and attending Oxford University from 1924–1927. During his illustrious legal career Mr. McDougall served as a delegate to the League of Nations, legal counselor to the British Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, and was a Professor of International Law at the Iraq Law School in Baghdad.\n\nMr. McDougall eventually settled in the United States (in the 1950s) and died in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in 1984.

Jessup and Francis Desk.”\n\nFormer McDougall Visiting Professors at WVU Law include:"
