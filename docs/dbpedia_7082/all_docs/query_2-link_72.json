Ronald MacGillivray.\n\nJanet MacGillivray married Colin MacDonald West River – inherited farm at West River from Rev. Ronald MacGillivray.\n\n*In History of Antigonish Vol 1 which is the work of Rev. Ronald MacGillivray (Sargat Arisaig SA) he mentioned on page 54 that Andrew MacGillivray was his grandfather. In History of Antigonish Vol. 2 page 42 Charlie MacGillivray the writer does not mention that Rev. Ronald MacGillivray’s father John MacGillivray was one of the children of Andrew or Andra Ban MacGillivray and Janet MacDonald when he wrote about this family. Rankin offers no clarity to this quandary – except for a paragraph on SA he does not include the family of Andrew. .\n\nAlso on page 40 in Vol. 1 SA wrote of his “granduncle Capt. Alexander McGilivray of Dunmaglass”.\n\nIn Andrew Andra MacGillivray’s last will written July 9, 1827 he mentioned his children: Alexander, Hugh, John, Ronald, Donald and Marjory (Marcella).\n\nI believe that John – the father of SA was a son of Andrew and Janet.\n\nSA also wrote “my uncle John McGillivray, piper…” on page 40 Vol 1 and on page 66 Vol. 1 wrote that John the piper “was the eldest son of Andrew MacGillivray of Dunmaglass”. In Vol. 2 Charlie MacGillivray wrote that “Iain Probaire (John MacGillivray, piper) was the son of Andrew Ban MacGillivray, pioneer”..\n\nWhat I believe is that there were two Andrew MacGillivray families in the area – Andrew and Janet at Dunmaglass and Andrew at Maryvale (Highfield).\n\nI have found an obituary in The Casket from 1891 for a Mrs. Andrew (Catherine) MacGillivray born 1800 who lived at Malignant Brook. Maybe this was a brother of John the piper. I believe John the piper could be the son of a second Andrew MacGillivray son of Duncan who was a pioneer not the son of Andrew married to Janet. So I believe what Charlie MacGillivray meant when he wrote “Andrew Ban MacGillivray, pioneer” was to distinguish this Andrew from Andrew son of Donald who was the pioneer.\n\nAlso in the will for John the piper MacGillivray he appointed as executors Hugh MacGillivray, Andrew’s son Back Settlement Knoydart and Alexander MacGillivray, John’s son Malignant Brook. If John the piper was a son of Andrew and Janet then Hugh would have been his brother and the will likely would have made reference to that fact.\n\nMaybe SA was referring to John the piper as an uncle as a term of endearment – they were related – cousins once removed.\n\nAlexander MacGillivray “Captain Alex” married (1) Mary MacDonald\n\nMary MacGillivray married to Mr. Harris, Pictou\n\nIsabella MacGillivray (b. 1790-d.
