(a) Roderick married Mary Mclsaac daughter of Archibald Mclsaac who was one of the pioneer teachers of this country, with issue,\n\nANGUS R. of Port Hood, N. S. who married Mary Mclnnis of Judique,\n\nHugh of Antigonish who married Ellen Fraser of Port Hastings,\n\nJohn A. of Port Hastings married to Janet McDonald of Low Point.\n\nMary who married John D. McDougall of Troy.\n\nMargaret who married John McLellan of Creignish, and\n\nAnnie married to Angus Mclnnis of Low Point.\n\n[1]\n\nIn his youth, Angus R was seriously injured while splitting wood. Damage done to his kneecap caused him to be lame for the rest of his life. Also on that account, he got more education than the rest of the family. The reasoning being that he would be ill-equipped to do hard physical labour as an adult. According to Rita (his brother Hugh's daughter), he had Grade 8.\n\nIn 1900, he moved to Port Hood and became magistrate. Angus R was a strict man, known as \"Angus the Bear\" to the people in the Port Hood area. He was \"right down on liquor\" and would lecture offenders for their transgressions of the law.\n\nAngus R and his wife, Mary MacInnis, did not have a family of their own but brought up a niece of Mary's. This girl, Rebecca, was intellectually disabled.\n\nAngus R taught school (in Gaelic) prior to going to Port Hood.\n\nPhysically, Angus R was a heavy-set man with white hair and a moustache.\n\nOnce a year, Angus R visited Antigonish. His brother Hugh's family always looked forward to his visit, mainly because he gave each of the children $ .50 whenever he visited. John (Hugh's son), being the only boy, got $1. On one occasion, Florence (Hugh's daughter) remembers getting an additional $ .50 for walking the field with him. On another occasion, John was especially anxious for Uncle Angus to come. He was 16 years old and wanting to have a \"22\". When Angus R arrived, Ellen (Hugh's wife) told him about John wanting the gun and her own reluctance to see him have it. John did not receive a dollar that time.\n\nAngus R spoke Gaelic very well and spoke it whenever he visited Antigonish. since Hugh worked on the railroad, he was often away when Angus R arrived. Angus R was ambitious for Hugh's family to go on to gain an education. He would always ask the children to spell or do a little dance or song.\n\nThe nuns at school knew him. One time Betty (Hugh's daughter) did something wrong and was admonished with, \"If Angus MacDougall knew what you did.....\" Her schoolmates thought the Angus MacDougall being referred to was \"Angus the Nun\", their janitor, and could not see the connection.\n\nAngus' wife did not visit Antigonish when he did, so the family did not know her. She outlived her husband but died in the same year. She was born in 1863. When Angus R died, Hugh got his wagon and his copy of the \"History of Inverness\". He also got a sum of money which he used to raise the roof on the kitchen. Some of his money also went to St. Francis Xavier to educate priests.\n\nYears later, the MacDougall girls would hear stories of their uncle from friends and acquaintances in Montreal. Isabel (Hugh's daughter) remembers playing bridge at St. Veronicas's in Dorval with a Phonsie Sutherland, formerly from Port Hood. She knew Angus R and remembers as a child jumping on his sleigh to catch a ride home. He was aware of his passengers but never said anything. She was quite impressed by him. Margaret (Hugh's daughter) also encountered many people who met him. Generally speaking, the women felt he was a good, just man. Most of the men she met told stores of someone being caught drunk, going to court and ending up in jail for a day or so. The prospect of \"landing in front of Angus the Bear\" was not taken lightly.\n\n[2]\n\nBirth Record - not found\n\nCensus Year: 1871 Item Number: 1830067 Province: Nova Scotia District Name: Inverness Sub-District Name: Judique\n\nMcDougall, Rory, M, 50, b.
