        "text": "McDOUGALL FAMILY OF GIRVAN, AYRSHIRE, SCOTLAND\n\nThe McDougall family has been traced to Girvan, Ayrshire in Scotland and was settled here for many generations. In the late 1800's they began to disperse to other parts of Scotland and ultimately the world. My own branch of this family settled in Glasgow for several generations before some migrated to Australia. The spelling of the McDougall name has seen several variations, but it is interesting to note that the earlier records in Girvan relate to the name Dougal. I have recently been in contact with Jeanette Earl a fellow family historian who is also a descendant of this family who is now living in Canada. My direct line of descent is indicated in Bold typeface.\n\nFIRST GENERATION\n\n1. Andrew DOUGAL\n\n. Son of James DOUGAL & McCLYMONT. Born Circa 1768. Died 15 Apr 1861 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND. Occupation Cotton Weaver 5.\n\nUnfortunately, a record of Andrew's baptism has not been found at this time.\n\nA record of a marriage for Andrew and Jean has not been found either, however her maiden surname was recorded at the baptisms of their children.\n\n7\n\nNeither Andrew or his wife Jean appeared on the 1861 Census for Girvan, and it is likely that both were deceased at this time, however burial records have not yet been examined.\n\nDescendent Jeanette Earl has since confirmed that Andrew died in 1861. His father's name was James. 64\n\nHe married Jean EARL, daughter of James EARL & Janet COCHRANE. Born 26 Dec 1776 in Colmonell, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n63. Christen 27 Dec 1776 in Colmonell, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 63. Died Before 1861.\n\nJean is the only known child of James Earl and his wife, Janet Cochrane. Unfortunately, Parish Registers for Colmonell have not been examined at this time.\n\nThey had the following children:\n\n2 i. Jannet DOUGAL\n\n3 ii. Jean McDOUGAL\n\n4 iii. Andrew McDOUGAL\n\n5 iv. Jannet McDOUGAL\n\n6 v. Mary DOUGAL\n\n7 vi. Margaret McDOUGAL\n\n8 vii. David DOUGAL\n\n9 viii. Alexander DOUGAL\n\n10 ix. Elizabeth DOUGAL\n\nSECOND GENERATION\n\n2. Jannet DOUGAL\n\n. Daughter of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Christen 12 Jan 1799 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 7. Died Before 1805.\n\n3. Jean McDOUGAL. Daughter of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Christen 18 Oct 1800 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n8.\n\n4. Andrew McDOUGAL. Son of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Christen 7 May 1803 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n8. Died 18 Aug 1860.\n\nHe married Jean GRAY, 1 Jul 1832 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n8. Born Circa 1807 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 62. They had the following children:\n\n11 i. Thomas McDOUGAL\n\n5. Jannet McDOUGAL. Daughter of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Christen 3 May 1805 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n8.\n\nJannet is noted on the 1871 Census residing on William Dryanans Land. A woollen winder, she is unmarried and aged 65 years, born Girvan. Also residing with Jannet are her niece Jane, and nephews, Archibald and Alexander. Although they appear on the Census with the name McDougall, it is believed they are the children of her sister, Elizabeth, who married James McDowall.\n\n19\n\nJanet has not been identified on the 1881 Census, so it is believed she died between 1871-1881.\n\n6. Mary DOUGAL. Daughter of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Born 24 Jul 1807 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n8. Christen 26 Jul 1807 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 7. Died 5 Mar 1891 64.\n\nIt is possible that Mary married Samuel MURPHEY at Maybole on 3 Jul 1838.\n\n7\n\n7. Margaret McDOUGAL\n\n. Daughter of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Born 22 Dec 1809 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 8. Christen 29 Dec 1809 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 8.\n\nShe married Thomas McQUEEN, 10 Dec 1837 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n62. Born Circa 1809 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 62. Occupation Fisherman. They had the following children:\n\n12 i. Margaret McQUEEN\n\n13 ii. Thomas McQUEEN\n\n14 iii. Andrew McQUEEN\n\n15 iv. Jane McQUEEN\n\n16 v. David McQUEEN\n\n17 vi. James Kerr McQUEEN\n\nMargaret and her husband were residing in Dalrymple St, Girvan on the evening of the 1881 Census. Thomas, a fisherman, was aged 80 years and born in Girvan. Margaret was aged 70 years, also born in Girvan. Also residing with them were three of their unmarried children, Andrew, Jane and David together with their 4 year old grand-daughter, Agnes McQueen.\n\n20\n\n8. David DOUGAL\n\n. Son of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Born 18 Apr 1812 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 8. Christen 26 Apr 1812 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 7. Occupation Silk Weaver 18.\n\nDavid married Sarah McCONNEL/McCONNELL, 21 Jan 1838 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n7. Born Circa 1803 in Daily, Aryshire, SCOTLAND 19. Occupation Wool Winder 19. They had the following children:\n\n18 i. Jane McDOUGAL\n\n19 ii. Mary McDOUGAL\n\n20 iii. David McDOUGAL\n\n21 iv. Margaret McDOUGAL\n\n22 v. Helen McDOUGAL\n\n23 vi. John McDOUGAL\n\nDavid and his family are noted on the 1861 Census at Girvan at Wilson St (LDS Reel 0103802). David was described as the head of the household, aged 46 years, a Silk Weaver born in Girvan. His wife, Sarah, was 50 years and also born in Girvan. Their children included Jane, who was unmarried and aged 24 years was a Cotton Weaver, as was their son, David, aged 19 years. Daughters, Margaret aged 17 and Helen aged 15 were both Cotton Winders. Their son, John, aged 11 years was a scholar. All their children were born in Girvan. 18\n\nA Thomas McDougall and his wife Jane, were also residing at this address on the evening of the 1861 Census. It is believed this is David's nephew, as his brother Andrew had a son Thomas baptised at Girvan in 1833.\n\nDavid, his wife, Sarah and their daughter, Margaret were still residing at Wilson St, Girvan on the evening of the 1871 Census. David, a wool weaver, born in Girvan, was aged 59. His wife, Sarah, born Daily a wool winder was aged 67. Also residing in the home was son, John aged 9, however this conflicts with John's baptism details. Is it possible this is an illegitimate son of Margaret's who was being raised by her parents?\n\n19\n\nDavid and his wife Sarah have both been identified on the 1881 Census Index again at Wilson St, Girvan. David was described as a Woollen Weaver. Their ages given are 68 and 78 respectively and both were born in Girvan. Also in the house was their daughter Margaret aged 38, although listed as a McDougall she is noted as being married and her occupation is described as a weaver. Son, John aged 19, a joiner, is also still listed, however see notes for previous census.\n\n20\n\n9. Alexander DOUGAL\n\n. Son of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Born 25 Mar 1815 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND. Christen 9 Apr 1815 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 7. Died After 1882 13. Occupation Weaver 12.\n\nAlexander is the fourth known child of Andrew Dougall and Jean Earl. Alexander, his brother and sisters, and infact his own children were baptised as Dougall. The earliest instance of the spelling McDougall is the 1861 Census.\n\nThe Parish Registers for Girvan (LDS Reel 1041380) revealed that Alexander and Helen had banns proclaimed on 6th and 13th September and were duly married on 18th September, 1835. Their marriage is recorded in the Parish Register as DOUGAL and FORREST, however is recorded on the 1984 IGI as McDOUGAL and FOREST and the 1988 International Genealogical Index (IGI) as DOUGALL and FOREST.\n\nHe married Helena Annie FORREST, 18 Sep 1835 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND. Born Circa 1815 in Edinburgh, Midlothian, SCOTLAND\n\n12. Died After 1882 13.\n\nTo date, Helena's birth or baptism has not been found. The 1861, 1871 and 1881 Census all indicate she was born in Girvan, however her son, George's birth certificate indicates she was born in Edinburgh. A search of both counties on the IGI has failed to reveal an appropriate entry. Other census records may further clarify this.\n\nIt is possible that Helena's mothers name was Margaret as she had two daughters both named Margaret, the eldest dying in childhood. Her father may have been either David or James, although the family does not appear to have followed strict Scottish naming patterns. However, as Alexander had had a brother, David, it is more likely her father was James.\n\nThey had the following children:\n\n24 i. David McDOUGAL\n\n25 ii. James McDOUGAL\n\n26 iii. Andrew McDOUGAL\n\n27 iv. James Forest McDOUGAL\n\n28 v. Margaret McDOUGAL\n\n29 vi. Robert McDOUGAL\n\n30 vii. Alexander McDOUGAL\n\n31 viii. Thomas McDOUGAL\n\n32 ix. Margaret McDOUGAL\n\n33 x. George Graeme McDOUGALL\n\nAt the time of the 1861 Census Alexander and his family were residing in Wilson St, Girvan. Alexander was aged 42 years and his occupation given as Fancy Dress Weaver, born, Girvan. His wife's name is recorded as Elenor, she is aged 40 yrs and was also born in Girvan. Their children include Robert, 11 yrs, Fancy Dress Weaver, Alexander, 12 yrs, Scholar, Thomas, 10 yrs, Scholar, George, 8 yrs, and Margaret, 6 yrs, Scholar, all born Girvan.\n\n18 (LDS Reel 0103802)\n\nGiven the baptisms found to date, and the children listed on the 1861 Census it is likely that their son James born in 1837 and daughter Margaret born in 1844 both died as infants. This would also account for the one son and one daughter that are noted as deceased at the time of George's birth. It is also possible that the ages given on the census for George and Margaret are reversed, as George was only aged 6 at this time.\n\nAt the time of the 1871 Census, Alexander and Helen(a) were still living at Wilson St, Girvan. Both Alexander and Helen were aged 55 and born in Girvan. Alexander was described as a Wool Weaver, Helena a wool weaver's wife. Also residing with them were their children, Andrew aged 28, Alexander aged 22, Thomas aged 20, Margaret aged 18 and George, aged 15.\n\n19\n\nAlexander and his wife, have both been identified on the 1881 Census Index for Ayrshire at Wilson St, Girvan. Alexander, a woollen weaver, was aged 54, his wife, who was recorded, as Ellen is aged 55 years. These ages are approximately 10 years out, and may have been unclear on the original documents and are most likely, 64 and 65 years respectively. Their son, Robert, aged 32 years, a fisherman, was also residing with them at the time.\n\n38\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas is the only other of Alexander and Helena's children to have been identified on the 1881 Census in Girvan. As their youngest son, George was living in Glasgow, it is possible that other son's had moved there also.\n\nNeither Alexander nor his wife are noted as deceased at the time of their son George's marriage in 1882, so it is believed they were both still living at this time.\n\nAlexander and Helena do not appear to have been living in Girvan at the time of the 1891 Census. Whether this indicates they were deceased at this time or may have moved, it is not known. However a search of the Scottish Death Indexes could not positively identify deaths for either during the 1881-1891 period.\n\n21\n\n10. Elizabeth DOUGAL\n\n. Daughter of Andrew DOUGAL & Jean EARL. Born 31 Aug 1818 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND. Christen 27 Sep 1818 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 7. Died 12 Feb 1883.\n\nElizabeth married James McDOWALL, 22 Dec 1842 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND\n\n8. Born Circa 1814 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND. Occupation Shoemaker 20.\n\nJames and Elizabeth have been identified on the 1881 Census, residing at 1 Tennant Place, Old Monkland, Lanarkshire. James who was described as a shoemaker, was aged 59 and his birthplace was noted as Kirkolm, Wigtown. Elizabeth, aged 60 was born in Girvan. Four children were residing with them that evening, Jeanie, Elizabeth, Andrew and Janet along with two grandchildren, William aged 11 and Maggie aged 6.\n\n20\n\nOf their grandchildren, several possible baptisms for William were found but none for Maggie. It would be possible that William is the one who was baptised 5 May, 1868 son of Archibald and his wife Margaret Hutcheson. However, Archibald has been found on the 1881 Census in Girvan in Plumb St, with a wife named Janet and 3 children. Is it possible that his first wife, died, and this child went to live with grandparents? 20\n\nElizabeth and James had the following children:\n\n34 i. Jane McDOWALL\n\n35 ii. Archibald McDOWALL\n\n36 iii. Elizabeth McDOWALL\n\n37 iv. Andrew McDOWALL\n\n38 v. James McDOWALL\n\n39 vi. William McDOWALL\n\n40 vii. John McDOWALL\n\n41 viii. Andrew McDOWALL\n\n42 ix. James Wilson McDOWALL\n\n43 x. Alexander McDOWALL\n\n44 xi. Janet McDOWALL\n\nA descendant of this family, Jeanette Earl is also researching her family history - please contact me if you would like to make contact with her.\n\nTHIRD GENERATION\n\n11. Thomas McDOUGAL\n\n. Son of Andrew McDOUGAL & Jean GRAY. Christen 27 Jan 1833 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 7. Occupation Fancy Dress Weaver 18, Weaving Agent 20.\n\nThomas' baptism on the IGI is record as DOUGALD and his mother noted as Jane, not Jean.\n\nThomas married Jane.

Born 9 Nov 1855 in Girvan, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 1. Died Oct 1924 in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, SCOTLAND 4. Buried 31 Oct 1924 in Lambhill Cemetery, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, SCOTLAND 4. Occupation Slater 3.\n\nGeorge's birth occurred in 1855, the first year of Civil Registration in Scotland. During 1855 details of other children born are listed on birth certificates. George's birth certificate states that he was the 10th child and that there were 6 boys and 1 girl living, and 1 boy and 1 girl deceased. George was born at 9pm in the evening. Whilst his birth was registered as McDOUGAL, his marriage is registered as McDOUGALL, and the latter spelling has been noted on all official documents relating to this family since that time.\n\nGeorge appeared on the 1861 Census at Wilson St, Girvan with his parents, Alexander and Helena, together with his brothers Robert, Alexander, and Thomas and his sister, Margaret. He was described as being 8 years of age (which was infact incorrect), a scholar and born in Girvan.\n\n18 (LDS Reel 0103802)\n\nGeorge was still living in Wilson St, Girvan with his parents at the time of the 1871 Census. He was born in Girvan aged 15 years and described as a scholar.\n\n19\n\nAt the time of the 1881 Census George was residing at 19 Rodney St, Glasgow, the home of Agnes STEVEN. He was described as a boarder, unmarried aged 23, a slater born in Girvan.\n\n20 (LDS Reel 0203657).\n\nGeorge married Martha Murray a year later at Martnaham in the Parish of Dalrymple however was still residing at the Rodney St. address in Glasgow. It is believed that both his parents were still living in Girvan, Ayrshire at this time.\n\n3\n\nHe first married\n\nMartha Orr Campbell MURRAY, daughter of Alexander MURRAY & Sarah Cockburn CAMPBELL, 24 Nov 1882 in Dalrymple, Ayrshire, SCOTLAND 3.

Occupation Domestic Servant (Cook) 3.\n\nMartha was born at 2pm at the Old Knockjarder, Dalrymple. She was the sixth child of Alexander and Sarah Murray's thirteen children. Whilst she is the couple's third daughter, they appear to have not followed strict naming patterns, and it would seem most likely that she has been named after her mother's eldest sister, Martha Orr Campbell, not her mother which would have been usual practice. The two elder girls were named after their respective grandmother's and in fact the next girl, was named after her mother, Sarah.\n\nMartha is listed on the 1861 Census at Dalrymple with her parents, Alexander and Sarah and her brothers and sisters, Isabella, William, John, Janet and Sarah. She is aged 4 yrs and her birthplace is listed as Dalrymple.\n\nUnfortunately, although the 1871 Census has been consulted for Dalrymple, Martha was not living in the family home. It would seem likely that she may have been in service at this time as she would have been 13/14 years of age, or she may have been visiting, however she was not noted elsewhere in Dalrymple.\n\n19\n\nAt the time of the 1881 Census, Martha aged 23 years was in service as a cook in the home of Christina Miller at Racecourse Rd, Ayr.\n\n38\n\nIt would seem most likely that Martha was still at this address at the time of her marriage a year later. Her father was noted as deceased at this time, and he was not listed on the 1881 Census a year earlier either. Martha's 18 year old sister, Jane was a witness at her marriage along with an Alexander Barclay, possibly a friend of George's.\n\n3\n\nFollowing their marriage, George and Martha resided in Glasgow at 369 and later 378 Garscube Rd. They are believed to have had five children, Alexander, George, John, Helen and James.\n\n4 The names of Martha and George's children have been identified by their grandchildren, however their births, etc have not been confirmed at this time with the exception of Alexander's and Helen's. 25\n\nMartha died in her 39th year, just three months after the birth of her youngest child, James.\n\n4\n\nShe is buried in Liar No. 616 at Lambhill Cemetery, Glasgow. A further 4 relatives were later buried in this liar including her son, James, granddaughter, Cissie, her husband - and his second wife!\n\n4\n\nThey had the following children:\n\n58 i.

Buried 10 Apr 1928 in Lambhill Cemetery, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, SCOTLAND 4.\n\nFollowing the death of his first wife, Martha, George married Mary Cassidy, a widower. He predeceased her and died in 1924 just short of his 69th birthday. He is buried at Lambill Cemetery in Lair No. 616.\n\n4\n\nThe informant at Mary's death was her step-son, George McDougall. She died of senility and pneumonia.\n\n2\n\nMary is buried in Lair No. 616 at Lambhill Cemetery. Other members of the family buried in this lair include Martha McDougall, George's first wife; James McDougall, George and Martha's youngest son; Elizabeth McDougall, George and Martha's grand-daughter; and Mary McDougall, George's second wife.\n\n42\n\n34.
