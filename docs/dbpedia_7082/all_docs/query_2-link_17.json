He started his career as a journalist there at the Fond du Lac Commonwealth-Reporter at the age of fifteen. He received a BA in English from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1923. He went on to obtain a Master's from Northwestern University in 1926 and a Ph.D. in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin in 1933. After working at several newspapers, he joined the faculty of Northwestern University in 1935. During the depression, he served as state supervisor of the Illinois Writers Project, a WPA project of the New Deal, in which he edited the works of such Illinois authors as Saul Bellow, Nelson Algren, and Studs Terkel.\n\nMacDougall wrote several books, among them Gideon's Army, a three volume history of the Progressive Party movement that culminated in Henry A. Wallace's run for president in 1948.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThis collection is apparently the material the MacDougall collected for writing his book Gideon's Army.\n\nRelated materials\n\nManuscript materials\n\nThe Henry A.
