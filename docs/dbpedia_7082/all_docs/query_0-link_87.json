The seventh chapter represents an additional lecture to the students of these colleges.\n\nIn compliance with the desire of the Board the lectures, in somewhat enlarged form, are now brought before the public. The manner of its production accounts for the use of the direct address and other features in the form of the volume.\n\nAlthough the incidental illustrations have been drawn from a local field, and the situation in Ontario is most in evidence, and although one particular branch of the Church is occasionally referred to, the viewpoint of the book is national.\n\nThe writer begs that the volume will be regarded by no one as a treatise on its subject.

How stupid the people are who are rich and strong and do not give the children a chance! Inexpressibly stupid, no matter how they may pride themselves on motor cars and big ships and fine buildings, if the children of the poor as well as the rich have no chance to play on the grass and pick flowers and drink in the enriching vigor of good air. Such people do not match our land. They are like a degenerate, of an old ancestral stock, that was once strong before luxury and self-indulgence and all kinds of libertine behavior made him a despicable thing. As I have gone over this continent I have wondered when the man shall arise who will say, \"The Lord expects that these plains and mountains and forests and orchards will be occupied by people to reflect His image and match the setting of their homes.\"\n\nLet us consider the conservation of the resources of the land; not only to grow big crops, to increase the exports and make the balances of trade stand out with startling figures, but to have a better boy, to have a more beautiful girl, that the next generation for whom we are trustees should still more reflect back the grandeur of human life and have a fair chance to give expression to it through the wise use of our natural resources. Farming is gathering sunshine, forging wealth out of chaos,—gathering and humanizing into wealth for the service of the race the great unused powers of nature. It is one of the great fundamental occupations, and therefore the interests of the men who follow it are worth conserving. We have laid out our school system—that is, our rural public schools that we boast so much about—to train a boy to read and write and figure as the essential means of conserving and training for use his God-given powers and obligations to gather sunshine. Maybe the preparation does not qualify for the job, and the boy goes to town where he will find some job to suit his training.\n\nWhy has the Young Men's Christian Association gone on faster and more widely than some other organizations? It is not attempting to save men's souls apart from their bodies; it is not attempting to help men by appealing to their intellect only. By inclusion of the body, mind and spirit, with training for his occupation, the whole man may be saved into faith in a Christ who, as the perfect example, was Himself trained that way.\n\nAnd when we men who are responsible have done these things then we shall still be unprofitable servants; because no man can achieve more than a fraction of the service that will pay for what he came into, all unearned by his own labor or life. I wish the churches out in the rural districts ever-abounding success in making these things known to the youth—God's partner in the new earth; that it is worth while to be consciously a partner in the care of old Mother Earth, as a home for the race, bearing fine crops, with weeds suppressed, diseases and vile things under the restraining control of intelligent, educated man, and Earth herself becoming more beautiful and fertile; that, when he is far enough on to see and hope for the new heaven and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, he has no real gain from the vision unless he takes his part in making the earth new and righteous where he lives; and that he best gives expression to his life, as one of the partners, who helps to reveal and reflect God through his labor and his love.\n\nJames W. Robertson.\n\nHASTINGS COUNTY, ONTARIO, LOSING 3,138 IN RURAL POPULATION IN A DECADE.\n\n\"Oh, why should Canada's children roam?\"\n\nDEPLETION OF RURAL POPULATION\n\n—Charles Heavysege, \"Saul.\"\n\nRural Life in Canada\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nDepletion of Rural Population.\n\n\"The Poetic Genius of my country found me—as the prophetic bard Elijah did Elisha—at the plough, and threw her inspiring mantle over me. She bade me sing the loves, the joys, the rural scenes and pleasures of my native soil in my native tongue; I tuned my wild artless notes as she inspired.\" So wrote Robert Burns. That he was bred to the plow gave Burns his knowledge of rural life; his genius gave him insight into its significance. And thus in the poem which made the Plowman's fame, and in its most impassioned part, the patriot-poet prays:\n\nThe welfare of this \"wall of fire\" is fundamental in national well-being.\n\n\"Agriculture,\" says that keen-visioned watchman on the towers, Dr. James W. Robertson, in a masterly plea for the conservation of our agricultural resources, \"is not only an occupation which some individuals follow for profit: it is a great national interest determining in a dominant way the fortunes of this nation and the opportunities and the character of the population. So, while the improving of Canadian agriculture primarily concerns the farmer and his family, it affects the status of Canada, its outlook and its destiny.\"[1] Any widespread movement or persistent tendency which affects the status of the rural population is therefore a matter of concern to all, whether dwelling in city or in country, who have at heart the national welfare, and consequently sets a task for the Home, the School, the State, and the Church. Such a problem is given by the changing relations of city and country life. The rapid growth of urban population in comparison with rural is a phenomenon so pronounced, so widespread, and so persistent as to arrest universal attention.\n\nThe report of the Board of Social Service presented to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada in 1911 called that church's attention with emphatic force to the problem of the city. That report was an outcome of a two years' study of the situation—a study not only of the down-town problem, but of the up-town problem as well; not only of the congested centre, but also of the suburb. It stated in terse terms that the problem exists; asserted that in Canada it is just emerging as one of the most urgent of national questions; and claimed that it is THE problem of the twentieth century. A fuller study of the situation reveals that we have as vital and as urgent a problem of the country as of the city. It is the counterpart and correlative of the city problem. And though its moral outcrop is not so immediately obvious as in the case of the city, it is in its ultimate issues the more fundamental of the two.\n\nWe shall consider in our first chapter the depletion of rural life in three of its dimensions, physical, social, and moral, as seen in the numerical decline in population, the social strain upon the home and all the institutions of society, and the moral dangers incident to the situation.\n\nThe first or physical dimension, numerical decrease, is found throughout large districts of country. Let us glance first at some local illustrations.\n\nWithin a recent seven-year period seventy-six young persons left my pastoral charge for the cities or the West. A good proportion were from among our best church workers. They were not lost to the cause. One, for instance, trained in Christian work in the Young People's Guild at Spencerville, was the means of founding two congregations at Francis and its vicinity, in Saskatchewan. They were not lost to the cause, but what did their removal not mean to the church in Spencerville?\n\nSome few years ago a young Spencerville farmer said to me, \"When my father bought out the land we are now working he displaced thirty-eight persons. We are four, with four constant hired help.\" The change has meant no economic loss. While we were conversing he was on his way to Montreal in charge of two carloads of stall-fed cattle for the British market, all from his father's barns. Farming had improved under consolidation, but what of the social loss where eight persons replaced thirty-eight?\n\nThere is one school district within the bounds of my congregation where for four years past there have been but three children on the roll, and for three months of the last school year but one pupil was in attendance. Yet the school registers of forty years ago show an average attendance of forty-five pupils. What is the social significance of this fact?\n\nSpencerville, a hamlet of two hundred inhabitants, is situated on the Nation River between two concession roads. On the nearer of these concessions, right over against the village, are seven consecutive farms, once occupied, now without an occupant. What is the sociological bearing of this circumstance?\n\nThese incidents of the situation—these indications of a process of change—might be duplicated with variation in form or degree from the experience of every observer. They are evidences of a universal tendency, a world-movement. Population the world over is massing itself in cities. Cities are becoming congested, the country depleted.\n\nCanada during the last decennial census period increased in population by 1,833,523, yet her rural growth was only 574,878, while her urban expansion was 1,258,645. She added 34.13 per cent, to her total population during the decade, but only 17.16 to her people in the country, though 62.25 to those in town and city. We are apt to think of the prairies as purely agricultural regions, yet Saskatchewan, adding 389 per cent. to her rural population, added 648 per cent. to her urban population; and Alberta, increasing by 344 per cent. in rural growth, increased by 588 per cent. in urban growth.\n\nBritish Columbia gained 100,318 in rural, but 113,505 in urban, population in the decade. Manitoba, rich in still unoccupied land, won 70,511 for her farms and hamlets, but 129,802 for her villages, towns and cities. Quebec, although so largely agricultural, gained 39,951 in country population while advancing by 313,863 in city growth.\n\nOur country people formed, when the previous census was taken in 1901, 62.4 per cent. of the total population; when the recent one was taken in 1911 they had fallen to 54.4 per cent. Our city population, 37.6 in 1901, had grown to 45.6 in 1911.\n\nThe proportion of rural to total population has fallen in every Province during the decade; in Prince Edward Island from 85 per cent. to 84; in Saskatchewan from 80 to 73 per cent.; in New Brunswick from 76 per cent. to 71; in Manitoba from 72 to 56 per cent.; from 71 per cent. to 62 in Nova Scotia and in Alberta; from 60 to 51 per cent. in Quebec; in Ontario from 57 per cent. to 47; and in British Columbia from 49 to 48 per cent.\n\nBut it is not from relative increase merely, of city as compared with country, that the grave rural situation arises. Our addition of 34 per cent. in a decade does indeed present serious problems of several kinds, in evangelization, in assimilation, and even in transportation. But it does not give rise to the rural problem. Nor does the fact that we added 62 per cent. to the city and but 17 to the country population reveal the real heart of the problem. The country's loss is not relative merely, but absolute. The question is not one of slackened growth, but of waste begun. The country is not simply falling behind in the upward race; she is not even standing still; she is slipping downhill again and knows not how to stay her course.\n\nWe did not complete our survey of the Provinces a moment ago. We ceased with Quebec, whose gain as there given in figures we now notice was equal to 4 per cent. in her rural parishes, but 48 per cent. in her industrial centres. We have yet to consider that while New Brunswick had an accession of 22,262 to the inhabitants of her cities she suffered a diminution of 1,493 in her residents in the country; while Prince Edward Island towns simply maintained their ground, her townships fell back by some 9,546; while Nova Scotia's cities gained to the extent of 56,745 her farming districts lost by some 23,981; and that Ontario, adding 392,511 inhabitants to her cities and towns, parted with 52,184 from her rural homes.\n\nLet us look more particularly at Ontario's loss. Grenville, the county in which Spencerville is situated, had 21,021 people in 1901; now it has 17,545. Stormont numbered 27,042 a decade ago, but to-day 24,775. North Lanark by the previous census was credited with 17,236, by the recent one with 14,624. Frontenac, having then 24,746, now numbers 21,944. Lennox and Addington eleven years ago were given 23,346, one year ago 20,386. East Hastings, from 27,943 had fallen off to 24,978. Lambton East from 26,219 had dwindled to 22,223; North Bruce from 27,424 had diminished to 23,783.\n\nLooking at other counties from another angle, we find that North Wellington lost 14.6 per cent. in the decade; East Huron decreased 15.2 per cent. during the ten years; Dufferin's population diminished by 15.6 in the same period; North Middlesex fell away by 16.3; Grenville parted with 16.6 per cent. of her people, but was outclassed by South Bruce with a loss of 16.9 per cent. These three last-named counties saw just one-sixth of their population leave their bounds within the ten-year period.\n\nBut the loss is heavier still. These figures are for counties. The statistics for the counties include those for the towns. Now, with some few exceptions, such as Deseronto, with a loss of 42.9 per cent., Gravenhurst, of 24.3, or Almonte, of 18.9, the towns are holding their own. Consequently the percentage of loss is still higher for the townships than for the counties. Let us look at a few illustrative examples. Grenville lost 16.6 per cent., but her rural loss was 18.6 per cent., and the township of Edwardsburg, of which Spencerville is the centre, lost 21 per cent. The apparent loss in South Bruce is 16.9 per cent.; the real rural loss 19.3 per cent., and the actual loss in Kinloss township 23 per cent. The census informs us that Dufferin was a loser by 15.6 per cent.; the rural exodus was 18.5; but Garafraxa decreased 24 per cent. In North Bruce the rural loss was 18.2 per cent.; in East Grey and in East Lambton 18.9 per cent.; in South Grey 20.4 per cent., and in West Elgin 21.6 per cent. But what shall we say of such a case as that of North Grey, whose rural loss was 21.9 per cent. while her total gain was 7.8 per cent; whose townships of Keppel and Sarawak decreased by 34.3 and 48 per cent., while her urban population, in the towns of Owen Sound and Meaford and the village of Shallow Lake, increased by 48.5 per cent.? Or of Peterborough West, adding 20 per cent. to the total population, and 29 per cent. to her city of Peterborough, but losing 51.5 per cent. from her township of Galway?\n\nWhen the situation in Ontario is thoroughly canvassed we find that of the 526 townships in Ontario, exclusive of the immigration area—Algoma, Nipissing, Thunder Bay, and Rainy River—there has been a decrease of population in 423; and that of the 75 census districts containing rural as well as urban population, 60 suffered decrease in their rural population. If, again, we except the five districts in the New North, we find that in ten districts only is there growth of rural population.\n\nWe may perhaps realize the contrast more vividly still by placing rural loss over against urban gain in certain counties. Carlton lost 2,561 in rural population and gained 6,587 in urban; in Elgin the respective loss and gain were 3,302 and 4,128; in Grey, 10,782 and 7,083; in Haldimand 1,139 and 1,468; in West Hastings 1,586 and 1,063; in Kent, 2,701 and 1,502. West Lambton's rural loss of 2,594 stands over against an urban gain of 1,980; South Lanark's loss of 1,460 over against a gain of 1,215. Leeds suffered a rural loss of 2,150, but with an offset in urban gain of 1,118; Ontario—the county of that name—met with a rural loss of 2,091, but had an urban increase of 2,689; in Parry Sound the respective loss and gain were 1,970 and 3,581; in Perth, 3,792 and 3,013; in Renfrew, 2,724 and 1,961. Russell lost 1,204 in rural population; Wellington, 4,189; and Simcoe, 5,431 while gaining respectively 5,472, 3,035, and 5,472 in urban growth.\n\nThe census summary informs us that the rural decrease in Ontario is 52,184. This is 4.19 per cent. But the rural gain in the five new districts is 44,940. Therefore the rural loss in Old Ontario was 97,124, or 8.36 per cent. And the rural gain in the ten growing districts was 12,545. Therefore the rural loss in the sixty waning census districts is 109,669, or 10.82 per cent.\n\nIN PICTOU COUNTY, NOVA SCOTIA, LOSING 26.5 PER CENT. IN A DECADE.\n\nIs Acadia Arcadia no more?\n\nYet Ontario, with a net increase of 1.5 per cent. per annum through the excess of births over deaths, would have gained 200,183 in rural population in the decade. Moreover, fully 404,000 immigrants gave, at the ports of entry, Ontario as their destination, and of these fully 30 per cent. gave farming as their occupation. From this additional source the Province received an increase of rural population amounting to 121,200, without considering natural increase. The migration from her farms therefore amounts not to 52,184, but 373,567.\n\nNova Scotia's loss of 23,981 amounts to 7 per cent.; and the decrease is found in every district except two; in these the rural growth amounts to only seven-tenths of one per cent. In several counties the decline is severe; Colchester, 10.5 per cent.; Inverness, 11.9; Shelburne and Queen's, 14.8; North Cape Breton and Victoria, 15.8; Pictou, 26.6. The urban growth in Pictou, on the other hand, is 72 per cent. Severe as is this loss sustained by the counties, the townships in this case again alone reveal the real facts. The counties might be taken in almost unbroken succession to exhibit cases of severe declension in special townships. Advocate in Cumberland, for instance, loses 40 per cent.\n\nIn Prince Edward Island the diminution amounts to 10.8 per cent. and is general throughout the Island. In parts it is severe. In King's County, for instance, Township No. 40 loses 36 per cent.; in Queen's County, Township No. 20 loses 37 per cent.\n\nIn New Brunswick, because of expansion into new areas the loss is slighter, yet even here there is a loss in more than half the counties. In Westmoreland the falling off is 13 per cent.; in Charlotte, 13; in King's and Albert, 17. The loss in townships is startling. Hampton, in King's, loses 40 per cent.; Hillsborough, in Albert, 41; Sussex, in King's, 45; Madawaska and St. Francis, in Victoria, 47 and 53 respectively.\n\nIn Quebec, though there is a rural gain amounting over the whole Province to 4 per cent., yet there is a shrinkage in twenty-seven counties; in some severe: Montmorency, for instance, meets with a loss of 11.7 per cent.; Chambly and Vercheres, 11.9; Yamaska, 12; Richelieu, 20.2; and Laval, 23.7 per cent.\n\nThe contrast between rural loss and urban gain in certain counties is as vivid in other Provinces as in the case of Ontario. King's County, Prince Edward Island, lost 3,178 in rural population while gaining 1,089 in urban. In Nova Scotia the respective loss and gain were: in Cape Breton, South, 1,173 and 19,438; in Cumberland, 1,713 and 6,088; in Inverness 2,630 and 3,848; in Pictou, 5,885 and 8,284; in Shelburne and Queen's, 3,329 and 3,112; and in Yarmouth, 1,211 and 1,562. Charlotte, in New Brunswick, lost 2,999 in rural population and gained 1,713 in urban, while in King's and Albert the loss and gain were 5,666 and 3,371, and in Westmoreland, 4,319 and 6,880.\n\nIn Manitoba the receding of the tide has just set in. Lisgar records a loss of 7.5 per cent.; a score of districts show recession. Were it not for expansion over new territory towards the north, the whole Province would show decline in rural population.\n\nAssuming that the natural increase of population is 1.5 per cent. per annum, the rural population of the Dominion in 1901, 3,349,516, should have increased by 547,878 before the census was taken in 1911. Of the 1,715,326 immigrants who came to Canada during the decade, approximately one-third at the ports of entry gave farming as their occupation. These, with the same annual rate of increase, give a further augment of 670,258. The rural population thus received an accretion of 1,218,136. The actual growth was 574,878. Therefore 643,258 persons left our country districts during the decade. That all of these are not found in our Canadian cities does not alter the facts of the case.\n\nWinnipeg is not the third Canadian city, if we count by Canadian-born population; Boston is; 200,000 of her people are Canadian. There are several New England cities with a majority of their population Canadian born. When the figures of the Census Bureau were published a year ago, men asked in perplexity, \"Where is the other million?\" The Canadian nurses serving in American hospitals might be given as the first count in the answer. Canada set about making of herself a good place for manufacturers, and succeeded, but at the cost of becoming a less desirable place for farmers. Her manufacturers would in due time have arisen, because of her advantages, and would have been in an immensely stronger position eventually with a broader agricultural base.\n\nSuch is the record for a single decade. We must not, because of space, go into similar detail in regard to earlier periods. We should expect to find that in each decade the proportion of rural population grew less, and such is the case. We note the preceding one only. Between 1891 and 1901 the rural population of Prince Edward Island fell from 87 per cent. to 85; of New Brunswick, from 84 to 76; of Nova Scotia, from 82 to 71; of Manitoba, from 73 to 72; of Quebec, from 66 to 60; of Ontario, from 61 to 57, and of British Columbia, from 62 to 49; while throughout the Dominion the fall was from 72.3 per cent. to 62.4.\n\nBut the comparative rate of growth of the two sections of the population for the decade 1891-1901 is a fresh surprise. In Manitoba the tendency is least advanced; the rural gain was 65 per cent., while the urban was 71; in British Columbia it is much more marked, rural gain being 37 per cent. and urban 142; while in Quebec the rural gain was 0.39 per cent. and the urban 31. In Prince Edward Island a rural loss of 5.8 per cent. stands beside an urban gain of 4.7; in New Brunswick, a loss of 6.7 beside a gain of 36.7; in Nova Scotia, a loss of 11 per cent. beside a gain of 40; and in Ontario, a rural loss of 3.73 beside an urban gain of 12.49; while through all Canada a rural increase of 53,375 is offset by an urban increase of 484,701, or a gain of 1.01 per cent. in rural by a gain of 31.53 in urban population. But even yet we are scarcely prepared to find that in New Brunswick there was an actual decline in rural population in 84 per cent. of the census districts; in Nova Scotia of 95 per cent.; in Ontario, exclusive of the immigration areas in newly opened territory in Algoma, Muskoka and Nipissing, of 98 per cent., and in Prince Edward Island of 100 per cent. Let us present a few outstanding examples of retrogression covering longer periods, such as Durham East, with a total population, including the town of Port Hope, of 19,064 in 1871, of 18,710 in 1881, of 17,053 in 1891, of 14,464 in 1901, and of 14,301 in 1911; Durham West, including such a town as Bowmanville, with a total population for those decades respectively of 18,316, 17,555, 15,374, 13,106, and 12,112; of Frontenac, as formerly constituted—in all these comparative statements we are careful to include strictly the same territory—with 16,310, 14,993, 13,445, 12,008, and 11,044; or Lanark North, though such a town as Almonte is included, with 19,899, 19,855, 19,260, 18,180, and 15,456; or Lennox, 16,396, 16,314, 14,900, 13,421, and 12,023; Northumberland West, 17,328, 16,948,14,947, 13,055, and 12,965; or finally, Perth South, with 22,715, 21,608, 19,400, 17,861, and 16,038. Did considerations of space not forbid we should wish to add detailed examples of retrogression in the case of townships covering the same period, inasmuch as the percentage of loss would be much more striking; for example, the township of Chinguacousy in the county of Peel has this record—we go back ten years further—in 1861, 6,897; 1871, 6,129; 1881, 5,467; 1891, 4,794; 1901, 4,177; and 1911, 3,913; a loss of 46 per cent. in fifty years. An impressive array of similar histories might be given. We close with one additional presentation of these momentous facts. The rural population of Ontario in 1871 was 1,306,405. It is now 1,194,785. There has been a loss in forty years of 111,620. Her urban population was then 313,446. It is now 1,328,489. There has been a gain of 1,015,043. In all eastern Canada there was in 1871 a rural population of 2,898,486. There is now 2,864,713, a loss in 40 years of 23,773. There was then in all eastern Canada an urban population of 680,296. There is now 2,599,228. There has been an urban growth in forty years of 1,918,932.\n\nIn Quebec the problem assumes a special form. All of the forces at work elsewhere are at work there also, with an added one—racial dispossession. Originally all of that great triangle of territory between the United States border and the St. Lawrence River as far down as Quebec was, save for a fringe of counties along the St. Lawrence and of parishes along the Richelieu, settled by English-speaking people. To-day, through the action of a movement displacing and replacing one people by another, this great region, containing fifteen counties—one of the finest in all Canada—is overwhelmingly French-speaking.\n\nThis is not the first time in history that civilization has been confronted with a problem arising out of the displacement of one people by another. In ancient Britain it arose at the close of the first half of the fifth century. For a century and a half the problem pressed. Then it passed. It was not solved. It ceased. A race was extinguished. When Hengist landed on Thanet in 449 Roman culture stretched across Britain and reached the farthest shores of Ireland. It was the vigorous civilization which later made Ireland the chosen home of letters and arts. When Llywarch sang the death-song of Cyndyllan he sang the dirge of a passing people.\n\nIn one respect—that of race—we wish to draw a parallel between this movement and that now going on in Canada. The Saxon conquest was sheer dispossession The historian Green tells us that \"not a Briton remained as subject or slave on English ground.\" There was no massacre. But \"field by field, forest by forest, the land was won. As each bit of ground was torn away by the stranger, the Briton sullenly withdrew, only to turn and fight doggedly for the next.\" Elsewhere, in Spain and Gaul, though these lands were also conquered by Germanic peoples, there was no dispossession. Religion, social life, administrative order, remained Roman. But in Britain the laws, the manners and the faith which the Roman people had left behind vanished before the Saxon. Just such a race movement is going on in Canada in our time. Robert Sellar, in his valuable monograph, \"The Tragedy of Quebec,\" tells us that when he first went to Huntingdon, the county, save for one municipality, was as solidly English-speaking in population as any county in Ontario, but that he has witnessed the decline of the original people to the point of being in a minority. The same change, only in a more marked degree, has taken place in all the counties east of the Richelieu. Missisquoi, founded by U. E. Loyalists, has ceased to be English-speaking. Drummond, Wolfe, Shefford, may be said to be French-speaking. The transformation has been going on with startling rapidity during the past fifteen years. In 1891 there were eleven English-speaking counties in the Province of Quebec. Now English-speaking people are in a minority in every one. The writer is on familiar ground in discussing this problem. In his boyhood there were only two French-speaking families in the village of Ormstown. A few years ago he attended a political meeting there. Chairman and speakers were French. A fragment of the time was given to an address in English.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this matter has to be referred to in terms of race, inasmuch as it is not racial in essential character. There is absolutely no racial barrier to prevent our French and English-speaking peoples commingling. In the writer's mind one French-Canadian, who was throughout his boyhood and youth employed on his father's farm, stands as a type of a splendid race. He had the physical hardihood that enabled him to handle a logging-chain bare-handed in the woods in winter, the mechanical aptitude which made all his work artistic in finish, the bonhomie of spirit which kept him ever genial and sprightly, and the faithfulness of character which made every task, however remote from oversight, not eye-service, but goodwill. The respect and the affection with which the French-Canadian is regarded by the British-Canadian where he is intimately known is returned with reciprocal affection and respect. Witness Sir Wilfrid Laurier's tribute to Mr. Murray, his host in school days while he gained his rare mastery of the English tongue. Yet we have a race-movement in Canada planned with consummate skill and carried out with tenacity of purpose, affecting the population of wide extents of territory.\n\nThe problem given us by this race-movement is not simply one of ministering to the weakened remnant; not, for example, how to care for the 12,000 children of scattered English-speaking parents attending the French schools. It is rather how to stem the movement itself and hold our two races as one associated people. Quebec, apart from any question of population holds the future of the Dominion in her hands. By the incorporation of Ungava she is rendered permanent y our premier Province in extent. She is our greatest in resources. That province is the coming industrial centre of this continent. Of Canada's waterpower, estimated at twenty-six million horse-power, Quebec is reported to possess seventeen million.[3] A mutual understanding and collaboration is needed for the efficient development of material resources of such magnitude, as well as for the political and social well-being of our common country.\n\nNor is the problem confined to Quebec. In old Glengarry known to fame, the majority of the population is French-speaking. Father Le Bel, speaking at the Parle Français Congress in Quebec in June last, is reported in the press as having stated that there are now 250,000 French-speaking people in Ontario, and that there are over 50,000 children taught in French in the bilingual and the purely French schools of the Province. Mr. Frank Yeigh, the well-known publicist, informs us in \"Facts about Canada\" that they have the preponderant vote in fifteen counties; Father Le Bel claims that in twenty-two their vote is the decisive factor. Mr Yeigh estimates that by the end of this century they will number six millions in Ontario. Here in these beautiful Muskoka groves—if the present tendencies remain unchecked—before two generations shall have passed, French, save on the lips of tourists, will be the only language heard. In New Brunswick the French population now numbers 90,000, or more than one-fourth of the population. In Prince Edward Island, while the total population decreased by nine and a half thousand, the French people increased by over four thousand. This problem, then, is not a Quebec problem, but Canadian. It is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, before any English-speaking nation to-day.\n\nThe first and fundamental dimension of the problem is physical—the numerical diminution of the population. But the rural loss is not only quantitative; it is qualitative as well. The second dimension is social, and is measured by the strain on all social institutions and relations. Farm homes in Canada are farther apart than anywhere else in the world. Leaving out of consideration such districts as Algoma West, with 1.29 to the square mile, and Algoma East, with 0.91, we have in Ontario counties such as Lennox and Addington, 14.4; South Renfrew, 14.1; North Lanark, 13.9; Frontenac, 13.1; Peterborough, 13.2; Victoria, 9.22. In all these cases the towns are included. The rural population of the United States is 15 to the square mile, and even Russia, whose people, moreover, live in hamlets rather than on farmsteads, has 16. Yet in Nova Scotia, Annapolis, including the towns has only 14.04; Shelburne and Queen's, 11.97; and Guysborough, 10.29; and New Brunswick as a Province, including her cities, has but 12.61 to the square mile.\n\nIN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND, A TOWNSHIP LOSING 37 PER CENT. IN A DECADE.\n\nThe Garden of the Gulf, growing depleted.\n\nHow serious, therefore, is our situation when we find that under the first count in the social strain—the abandoned home—in Ontario, Lennox and Addington have 366 fewer dwelling houses than ten years ago, a loss of 6.9 per cent.; East Huron 310 less, a loss of 7.5 per cent.; North Lanark had 265 of its dwellings, or 7.7 per cent., go out of use in the decade; and Lambton East 491, or 8.3 per cent.; while in Grenville 352, or 9.17 per cent. became unoccupied—the largest loss, for a county, in the Province. But here again the county does not present the real facts; in towns the dwellings are increasing in number. The townships form the real test. Here are some of the outstanding instances. The historic township of East Zorra in Oxford County closed 13.6 per cent. of its homes; in Hastings, Madoc lost 13.7; Ashfield, in Huron, allowed 15 per cent. to fall into desuetude; in Grey, Egremont has 15.1 abandoned homes, and Glenelg, 16.2; Edwardsburg has 17 per cent.; Darling, in Lanark, 17.3; Cavan, in Durham, 18.8; Glenelg, also in Grey, 19.8 per cent. Were there space we might specify as well Arran, Culross, Huron, Wawanosh, Camden, Rochester, Greenock, Augusta, Brant, Tuscarora, Kinloss, Bruce, Haldimand, and Abinger, with empty farmhouses ranging from 10 to 20 per cent. But all of these are quite outclassed by Barrie, in Frontenac, with 25.4 of its dwellings abandoned in the decade; Morris, in Huron, with 25.5; Keppel, in Grey, 27.17, and Sarawak, in Grey, 45.8 per cent. The loss is as widespread in the Maritime Provinces as in Ontario. In New Brunswick, Hampton lost 36 per cent. of its homes, Hillsborough 39, Sussex 46, St. Francis 49, and Madawaska 58 per cent. Not poetic sentiment only but stern fact in fancy drest is given us in the lines:\n\nBut the abandoned dwelling is a lesser social evil than the weakened household. While engaged in pastoral visiting lately, a parishioner spoke to me of the number of houses in his neighborhood from which a multitude once went with him to the house of God to keep holyday. But the pathos of the situation was seen in this, that he himself was living in his well-found house alone. From Edwardsburg we lost in the decade one-eleventh of our families, but one-fifth of our population. The families which remain are depleted households in the midst of a depleted countryside. From the families which are still with us in Grenville there have gone away 1,303 persons. This does not mean that simply the redundant members of the household leave. It means that in many cases parents are left to carry on the farm alone. Let Grenville stand as our single and sufficient illustration. In 1901 the average number of persons per family in city and country throughout Canada was 5.16. In Grenville it was then 4.42. By 1911 the average for Canada in city and country had fallen to 4.84. But in Grenville it had fallen to 4.07. Family life that averages only four persons to a household throughout a community of over seventeen thousand persons can suffer little further diminution and continue.\n\nThe third line of social strain is seen in the relative numbers of the sexes in rural Canada. One of the most startling surprises given by the recent census was found in the lessened proportion of women in our country homes. The girls are even more dissatisfied with farm life than are the boys, and are leaving in larger numbers.\n\nThe general rule of population the world over is that females outnumber males. The usual proportion is about 105 to 100 at birth, and about 107 to 100 in adult life. This rule holds good of our urban population. In only 45 out of the 250 cities, towns and villages of older Ontario do males exceed females. But in our rural population this universal rule of human life is reversed, and the reversal is so general as to be astounding. In only 40 of the 920 townships and other rural divisions—exclusive of Indian reserves—enumerated by the census in all Ontario do females outnumber males.\n\nLet us take the county of Middlesex as an illustration. In the North Riding there are six townships. In every case males exceed females, and the total excess is 473. The riding contains also one town, Parkhill, and two villages, Ailsa Craig and Lucan. In all, women surpass men in number, the whole surplus being 188. East Middlesex is purely rural, consisting of the four fine townships of London, Dorchester, Nissouri, and Westminster. In each the male population predominates, the aggregate predominance being 518. The west riding embraces five townships; in every one more men than women are found, the plurality throughout the five being 469. In its town and villages, Strathroy, Glencoe, Newbury and Wardsville, men are everywhere in a minority, its total being 355. There is one city within the bounds of the county, London, with an excess of females over males of 2,498. In the townships of Middlesex there are 107 men to 100 women. In the city, towns and villages of Middlesex there are 112 women to 100 men. There is only one county in Ontario, this one of Grenville, in which females exceed males in the purely rural population.\n\nThe excess of females over males in the urban population of Ontario is 10,865. The excess of males over females in the rural population of Ontario is 85,940. In the cities, towns and villages, taken by themselves, there are 102 women to 100 men. In town and country taken together there are 106 men to 100 women. In the country alone there are 116 men to 100 women.\n\nThis anomaly holds true, not of Ontario only, but of all rural Canada. In New Brunswick males outnumber females in every census district except the city of St. John. There women outrank men by 2,013. In the rest of the Province men outrank women by 7,845. In Nova Scotia in every district outside of Halifax save two there is an excess of females. The overplus for the province is 9,700.\n\nHave all of our women the vagrant heart? We know that they have not. Then why so many fleeing from the country?\n\nBut where there is not the vagrant spirit, what impels our girls to leave?\n\nA fourth form of social strain ought perhaps to be discussed. It is said that leaders are leaving the country. Those who are drawn away include many of the ablest and most progressive. There are, however, higher qualities than ability and energy. I have known of more than one case where young men, and of still more cases where young women, remained on the farm through a sense of duty to others. Efficient help is given in the solution of more than one direct problem by actions such as this. Duty is the source of energy.\n\nThe drain meanwhile is real. Our question is only as to the validity of the principle. I visited recently a farm home in the county of Dundas. My host, after having—according to the farmer's manner—shown me something of his barns, brought me to his office. It was furnished with roll-top desk, desk telephone, safe, and reference library. Everything about home and farm was in keeping therewith. Yet the household consisted of husband and wife, hired woman and hired man. But there were three sons and two daughters in the city. The eldest son is a graduate—with honors in mathematics—of Toronto University, and has passed the examinations of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain. The other sons are graduates in Medicine and in Science of McGill University. The eldest daughter is a graduate of the Conservatory of Music at Toronto. The children will not consent to the sale of the farm. It is still the home of their pride, the scene of their happy vacations and reunions. Such cases are not uncommon. But does it follow that the country must deteriorate? Can we afford to obey the mandate:\n\nThat depends solely on the spirit of those who remain. If part go that they may achieve something worth while, their very going proves a spur to all who take pride in their success. For centuries the achievements of Scotland's sons abroad were the very pulse of life to her sons at home. But when hopelessness or dissatisfaction is the cause of the exodus, blight comes, not because of the exodus, but of abiding conditions. The country can obey the maxim, \"Send forth the best ye breed,\" provided that she \"take up the White Man's burden\"; can \"bind her sons to exile\" if it be \"to serve another's need.\" That call \"comes now, to search your manhood,\" not to impair it. What is needed is intense life—not labor, but life—upon the farm itself, so that the country shall not become the byway. The highway must lie free for all through city and country alike.\n\nThis is the law of the country and has been. Not hers \"the thriftless consumers of time.\" The virile country not only can \"bind her sons to exile to serve another's need\"; she \"dare not stoop to less.\" And if for the hour despondent, she is true at the heart to her past.\n\nThe third count in our problem amounts to the question: Is there a moral strain being placed upon rural life by our present situation? In this field it is more difficult to glean representative facts and present them fairly. No statistics are available on this aspect of the problem. Dr. W. L. Anderson, in his able volume dealing with our problem, writes: \"Our argument rests upon the favorable showing of the country as a whole compared with the city as a whole. As tested by the symptoms of degeneracy, the country is in as healthful a state as the city; where the advantages and wholesome influences of civilization are massed; where education is at its best; where eloquence finds its opportunity and art gathers its treasures; where wealth gathers all resources and taste has every gratification; where churches are powerful and every social institution co-operates in the exaltation of human life. That the country is not distanced by the city in social and moral development almost exceeds belief; or, to use the terms in which we began, the line of averages is at a surprising height in the country.\"[8] The question is, however, not one of comparative values in city and country, but of what tendencies are at work in the country.\n\nCountry life of late has made one marked advance. It has socialized, and to a large extent solved, the drink problem. It has taken hold of this evil as a community question and has therefore crowned its efforts with success. It has not only socialized the reform, but to some degree standardized it as well. The country newspaper has to a very large extent barred out the liquor advertisement. And to this standard the urban press must come.\n\nI might add that the country has made marked advance in regard to general practice concerning the use of tobacco. Last autumn seventeen farmers, chiefly young men, gathered at the home of one of my church managers on silo-filling day. Of the seventeen not one used tobacco in any form.\n\nBusiness integrity, in so far as tested by the older ethical standards, is high in the country. But it is not yet so in regard to the newer ethical imperatives. A daughter of the manse and a daughter of the farm were discussing some finer branch of cooking. \"But we use cream, not milk,\" said the daughter of the farm. \"Oh,\" was the response, \"do you keep the milk of a cow at home just for that!\" \"Pshaw, no,\" came the answer, \"we take a dipper or two from the factory can.\" This is suggestive of much that is lacking bearing upon the ethics of co-operation in the country.\n\nIn other fields having to do with graver moral evils I offer no attempt at generalization. But let me give single instances of actualities in several moral realms. Near a certain hamlet which shall be nameless a farmer sent his wife into the field to drive the team with the harrows. When, wearied, she sat down to rest, he rent a splinter from a fence rail and beat her. By night men forced his door, dragged him from hiding, rode him upon a fence rail, and informed him that if he beat his wife again treatment more drastic would be meted out to him. Here two grave crimes meet: wife-beating and lynch-law. What is the bearing upon our problem? A farmer of Canadian stock had sold and left that farm; he had been replaced by an immigrant of a stock morally lower than our Canadian farmers, among whom wife-beating is unknown.\n\nIn the home of another young man in that hamlet two women were frequently left alone—his wife and another. The public noticed with disapproval the occasional coming of some men of leisure from a neighboring city, the nation's capital. One night, while one of these was present, the men of the place turned out and gave the house a \"charivari,\" staining its walls with broken eggs, and withdrew. Soon afterwards the premises were sold, and the household went away into oblivion. Again the bearing upon our problem is this: The young husband, finding little occupation at his trade in the neighborhood, sought employment away from home in the town.\n\nAgain, the township of Edwardsburg has, like all other Ontario townships, been almost unstained by the crime of murder. Yet we had one sad case in recent years. A man who had purchased a farm raised his hand against the man from whom he had bought it. The verdict of the jury, with the full assent of the Attorney-General, was \"Insanity\"; and, what is more, the verdict of our people, a community of whom the great majority would never condone crime even to save one of their number from death, unanimously acquiesced in the verdict. But who was he who was thus acquitted of responsibility for his deed? The trend citywards had called away a son from that home to the city, for whose life he was unfitted; and the father, to bring him back from the city, made over to him the homestead, and purchasing elsewhere for himself that he might begin anew, had broken down under the strain.\n\nFor an illustration from another field of moral evil we shall go beyond our own borders. Mr. P. V. Collins, editor of the Northwestern Agriculturalist, of Minneapolis, advertised for a stenographer of the highest ability. From among the applications received he selected one from a young woman apparently of such qualifications as he desired. But when she came to his office he discovered that she had only a public school education and a rudimentary knowledge of shorthand. When asked why she had copied out the application she replied, \"I did not write that; the principal of the academy which gave me my diploma sent it.\" Investigation brought out the facts that there was a bogus college selling diplomas throughout the country to anyone who had been for a term at a business school; and then sending country girls to positions which they could not possibly fill, notifying those in charge of the traffic in immorality of the stranding of the girls in the city. This particular one met with a philanthropist and friend, but there are other cases. The longing to escape from country to town is being taken advantage of by designing men to lure girls to their ruin.\n\nBut the chief factor in the moral strain is not found in the direct evil results or the moral pitfalls incident to the situation, but in the fact that moral enthusiasms are lacking in the country owing to the present trend. No high incentive takes men away; no lofty passion abides with those who remain. Where people are discontent with their lot and seek to escape it, with no fine aspiration leading them to any other walk in life, there is an absence of the moral incentives which made rural morality so splendid a thing in the past.\n\nThere is the best of testimony to the existence of the moral strain. Professor Giddings writes: \"Degeneration manifests itself in the protean forms of suicide, insanity, crime and vice which abound in the highest civilization where the tension of life is extreme, and in those places from which civilization has ebbed away, leaving a discouraged remnant to struggle against deteriorating conditions. . . . Like insanity, crime occurs most frequently in densely populated towns on the one hand, and on the other in partly deserted rural districts.\"[9] Dr. H. B. MacCauley, Secretary of the Eastern Division of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, says: \"In my district of thirteen States I have an opportunity of seeing the condition of things in the country in a way that is very broad; and I am prepared to say that if there is a place anywhere that needs the remedy which Jesus Christ alone can give, that place is in the country.\"[10]\n\nIn the connection that obtains between the church and our problem there is a two-fold reference: the bearing of the situation upon the church, and the relation of the church to the problem.\n\nThe bearing of the situation upon the church is manifest. The church is sensitively sympathetic to every vital experience of the community. The immediate result of depopulation is the loss of numbers to the church. This has not as yet been proportionate to the decline in population. The church is holding her own better than other institutions in the country. But a glance shows the inevitable trend. That trend is common to all denominations. Surveys of rural conditions made recently in the United States show conclusively that the increase or the decrease of the churches is a communal experience. Where one suffers all suffer with it. Investigation would doubtless show the same to be the case in Canada. But let us look at representative facts as found in the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nWhen we open the Blue-book the first congregation found on the official list in the Statistical Tables is Boularderie, in Sydney Presbytery. Let us look over its record for a decade. Its households numbered in 1902, 290; in 1903, 274; in 1904, 270; in 1905 the pastorate was vacant and no returns are given; in 1906, 250; 1907, 249; 1908, 246; 1909, 246; 1910, 231; 1911, 161. The severe loss in the last year is doubtless due in some way to the extension of the plant of the Steel and Coal Company at Sydney; the steady decline for the decade reflects general conditions. This congregation was taken simply because it stood first upon the list. Let us take a larger unit, a Presbytery, by selection as a representative one. Lanark and Renfrew may fairly be called such. It lies in a fertile and progressive district. It has an excellent record in church activities. Its congregations are strong, the self-supporting ones averaging 130 households to the pastoral charge. The average stipend or salary of its rural ministers is above $1,000. It appears to increase. It contained 3,362 households in 1901 and 3,763 in 1911, an increase of 401 for the decade. Let us see how this increase is accounted for. Six mission fields have been founded in new districts, with an aggregate of 188 families. The increase of the Presbytery as it existed in 1901 is but 213 households. There were at that time—including missions—33 charges. Of these two now number just what they did in 1901; 13 show an increase—of these two only are purely rural; 18 show a decrease. But the increase in the congregations in the towns of Arnprior, Renfrew and Smith's Falls is 284 families. There is therefore a loss throughout the rest of the Presbytery, including the towns of Almonte, Carleton Place, Pembroke and Perth, of 71 households; while the falling off in the 18 congregations actually losing amounts to 215. The facts underlying the total figures when analyzed in this Presbytery would be found typical elsewhere. But let us take a wider unit still. The three central Synods increased in each case steadily from 1901 to 1909 in the number of families. Then there comes an ominous change in all three cases. The Synod of Montreal and Ottawa had in 1909, 21,720 households. In 1910 it had 21,276, a decline of 444. Toronto and Kingston in the former year had 42,507, in the latter 42,176, a decrease of 331. Hamilton and London in 1909 numbered 28,243; in 1910, 28,037, a falling off of 206. The latter recovers in 1911 to 28,784; Montreal and Ottawa recovers to 21,637, but is still short of the mark of two years before; Toronto and Kingston had still further fallen to 40,986, an added loss of 1,521 households. We may perhaps realize the trend most vividly by noticing that six Presbyteries suffered loss in the total number of households in the decade, namely Kingston, Lindsay, Barrie, Saugeen, Stratford, and Bruce, with an aggregate decline of 963 families; while the Presbyteries of Hamilton, Montreal, and Toronto, though each, while largely urban, includes a rural section, increased respectively by 1,780, 2,086, and 4,768 households. In each case the gain was considerably more than half of the total gain in the whole corresponding synod for the decade.\n\nPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, SPENCERVILLE.\n\nA village cathedral, built in better days.\n\nRural churches are not and cannot be filled with worshippers as they once were. The Presbyterian Church in Spencerville, a village cathedral built in better days, never puts its spacious gallery to use. The most easterly church in the Presbytery of Glengarry, in Ontario, and the most westerly one in the Presbytery of Montreal, in Quebec, are examples of churches whose auditoriums have been cut down in size since they were first built. Churches here and there are closed. Within six miles of Spencerville are two churches whose congregations dwindled until they disappeared. No statistics are available upon this aspect of the problem in Canada. But in the United States, where the strain upon the churches has proved much more severe than in Canada, accurate surveys show the situation. The Ohio Rural Life Survey of 1912, for instance, reveals 800 abandoned churches in that State. In no county in the State are one-half of the congregations holding their own. In several counties not 10 per cent. are growing. In 10 counties, with a total of 394 congregations, not one-twentieth of the number had resident ministers. The ministers live in towns and go to the country to preach. Ninety-six townships in these ten counties, comprising nearly 4,000 square miles, are without a resident minister in the country districts.\n\nOther bearings of the situation upon the church in addition to this fundamental one might be discussed; we confine ourselves to the falling off in students for the ministry. This is forcibly presented for one branch of the church by Professor Kilpatrick in his Introduction to Mr. Mott's volume, \"The Future Leadership of the Church.\" \"The Blue-book for 1908 presents facts worthy of careful consideration. In 1875 the church possessed 139 students; in 1907 this number had risen to 194, a gain of 55. In 1875 the church possessed 706 charges; in 1907 this number had risen to 1,984, a gain of 1,278. If it required 139 students to supply the needs of a church of 706 congregations, surely 194 are far too few to supply the needs of a church of 1,984 congregations. Again, compare 1907 with 1902. In 1902 the church possessed 230 students and 997 congregations. In 1907 the number of congregations had increased by 987, while the number of students had decreased by 36.\" The cause of this decline is found in the rural situation. Over 90 per cent. of our students have been drawn from the country. The increasing discontent and unrest, the lessening of optimism and altruism, have affected adversely the country's richest product, the heralds of the Cross.\n\nOf more importance is the church's relation to the problem. The church is a means, not an end. The question is not one of maintaining her numbers and recruiting her ranks. It is one of the efficacy of her service to the country in its need. There was a time when the chancelleries of Europe were hard pressed to provide revenue for their governments. Then the science of political economy had its birth. The chancelleries found that the best way to secure revenue was by making their people prosperous. There was a period when for ages the Christian Church thought the end of her existence was the perfection of her own organism, and the cathedrals of Europe form the magnificent monument of the ideal and of its failure. The purpose of our enquiry is not in the slightest degree, How can the Church save herself amid the country's peril? It is, How can she make rural life a happier and nobler life, how she can meet the unmet needs of Canada, until\n\nECONOMIC CAUSES OF DEPLETION\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nEconomic Causes of Depletion.\n\nOur survey of the rural problem thus far has been an essay in social description. The science of Sociology would bid us now proceed with social interpretation in order to advance later to social construction.\n\nThe decrease in rural population is not due to the departure from the country of farmers alone. The decline of two other classes contribute to the general result. First the village crafts decayed, and now village commerce is waning.\n\nA village forty years ago was industrially a better place than now. Each hamlet had its corps of trained and skilled workmen with sturdily independent homes, making the rich contribution to community life that skilled craftsmen bring. The essential industries were everywhere represented. The village had a fairly self-sufficing economic life. Spencerville fourteen years ago supported two tailors. My acquaintance with the locality is just sufficiently long-standing to have seen this handicraft disappear. Other tradesmen have gone since then, the shoemaker being the last to leave—within the present year. The flour-mill also has recently been dismantled of its machinery, and converted into a feed-supply depot for the produce of distant milling companies. My memory of the village where boyhood's years were spent, Ormstown, situated amidst the rich farm lands of the Chateauguay Valley in Quebec, goes vividly back to the year 1869. A shy and visionary boy, I watched the tradesmen at their work while other schoolboys strove upon the playground. In that year the ashery, unused for years, was dismantled—the scene of an earlier, already vanished industry. In the sawmill work was being urged with pressing haste. Night shifts were often employed. At the grist mill farmers contested for precedence as they brought great loads of fine-hulled white oats to be kiln-dried and ground into round Scotch oatmeal, with sleighloads of which they then drove to distant Montreal to market. This mill was a few years later enlarged to meet the increasing local demand for its output of flour. Near the centre of the village stood the tannery, one of our largest buildings. All manipulations, from flesher to currier, were by hand; and from the bark-mill in the broad shed to the harness-shop in the upper storey the establishment was a scene of busy industry. The portly tanner who then initiated his boy follower into the mysteries of bark-pit and ooze I learned in later years to know as an excellent Shakespearean scholar. Nearby was the principal cabinet-maker's shop. A sweep horsepower in the basement drove the turning-lathe at which bed-posts and spindles were fashioned. At the side benches apprentice and journeymen worked, while at the front bench the proprietor—a village philanthropist and the patriarch of the temperance forces of the Province—wrought in walnut or bird's-eye maple the bridal suites of furniture for the community. The six wood-working shops of the village were each distinctive in character. At the oldest of the house-carpenter shop the coffins for the dead of the countryside were also made, each as sad occasion called. And into the making of each went a loving sympathy unknown in an age of machine-made products. As if it were yesterday there comes hack the sense of the mystery of death and of fellow-feeling with bereavement which workman and little boy by his side, permitted to hold and pass the silvered nails, alike felt as the work went on in reverent silence. Another of the local carpenters was then building the spacious village church, portrayed at page 195 of this volume, producing every panel and moulding on the spot and by hand, save as a treadmill horse-power, set up temporarily on the premises, lent its aid. From the homes of each of these builders a youth afterwards entered the ministry. Another of our carpenters specialized in the exact work of the millwright, and showed himself in various ways a self-taught mathematical genius. In my university days I discovered that he, who had never seen a copy of Euclid, had, Pascal-like, wrought out at his bench many of the problems of Euclid. At the wheelwright shops all vehicles for pleasure-driving as well as for farm use were built. I can recall seeing farmers drive in with loads of split hickory bolts for spokes and rock-elm blocks for hubs, though already the machine-made spoke and hub were competing for favor. The ironwork on these vehicles was no assemblage of machine-made parts, but the product of genuine craftsmanship, elaborate and ornate. All the smiths of the neighborhood were master craftsmen. One, at Dewittville near by, specialized in forging steel, and for this service burned his own charcoal pits. As a lad of seven or eight I took delight in watching the neat conical piles of wood carefully laid, and seeing the strange gases ooze through the covering of clay, while creosote condensed and dripped from the inserted gun-barrel. How different the amount of labor bestowed on such products then and now! As we detrained at Longford to come over here to Geneva Park a day or two ago we passed one of the Canada Chemical Company's extensive plants, where by the carload wood is run, car and all, into the retort, and the car comes out at length with a load of charcoal upon it ready for shipment. Now, too, the distillates, formerly wasted, pay for both material and process, and the once costly charcoal is a clear-gain by-product.\n\nIn the open country on the other side of the village by the Chateauguay another smith—master alike of his trade and the situation—forged the long iron-frame plow, so heavy to turn at the furrow's end, but so light of draft upon the team because of true lines of design and fine workmanship. With that same long plow the plowmen of the days of my boyhood turned furrows so true in line and so clean in comb that a rifle bullet might be fired from end to end of the field on those level meadows without once rising above the crest of the furrow, yet without staining itself with touch of the clay. Presently there came to the village the machine-shop also, for local service, and for well-nigh a generation the threshing-machines for the locality were of home manufacture. Space forbids my describing other busy shops—those of the tailors, the shoemakers, the saddlers, and many another. In that small village of eight hundred people there were then over thirty-five such shop industries.\n\nCHURCH AT SHANLY, ONTARIO.\n\nAn abandoned church, Grenville County.\n\nTradesmen such as these have as a class almost disappeared from our present-day industrial world. Their going deprives the countryside of a variety of openings in life for persons of different tastes, and confines the choice of occupations to one, that of agriculture. It has removed varied types of life from the community, reducing social groups to the monotony of a single class. It has withdrawn an intelligent, capable, prosperous and contented population from the country.\n\nThis loss is reflected in our literature:\n\nOne of the chief steps in this process proved a serious blow to the prosperity of the Maritime Provinces—the cessation of the ship-building industry when the sailing vessel with wooden hull was replaced by the steel-built steamer. Before that time Canada had become fifth in rank among the mercantile maritime nations, Britain, apart from Canada, ranking first. Our poets then sang with pride:\n\nand the building of these vessels gave our sea-board cities economic and social wealth.\n\nThe cause of this loss lies in the genius of the modern industrial world. The processes which have wrought out this modern system destroyed an industrial order which had been in building since the destruction of the ancient Roman civilization. The characteristic mark of this vanished order was household industry engaged in local production for local use. The modern industrial world brought in the factory system and world-wide transportation, each of which owes its rise to the invention of machinery and the discovery of power, and by means of these has developed its characteristic and epitome, the modern city.\n\nThe year 1769, an even century before the date of our description of village crafts, marks an epoch in the world's history. In that year Arkwright patented his spinning frame and set up his first mill equipped therewith, driven as yet by horse-power, but marking the beginning of the factory system. In that year Watt patented his steam engine, which alone could have rendered the factory system effective. In the same decade, another genius, James Brindley, gave to the world the modern canal system. The means of communication thus begun, augmented by the advent of the steamboat in 1807, and the railroad in 1830, rendered possible the massing of factories in great cities. New York ranked ninth of the cities of the United States in 1820, with but 9,000 people to Albany's 96,000, and was being still further outclassed. Her true growth began with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, but her rapid expansion about 1839 with the advent of the modern steamship. The Bessemer process, 1856, giving the steel rail instead of the iron one, cut the cost of railway haulage in half. Power transmission in 1891 rendered possible a still greater concentration by placing factories, not at the place of the source of power, but at the foci of transport and centres of trade. The average cost of transport in 1800 was ten dollars per ton per hundred miles. As I write a carload of mill-feed has just come into Spencerville from Brandon. The cost of transport is four dollars per ton for one thousand five hundred miles. For wheat and flour the cost was then prohibitive at two hundred miles distance. Now they can be profitably carried by rail and sea the semi-circumference of the earth.\n\nAnother concurrent change has had an equally great effect in industrial organization. The incorporated company was called into being by the need for larger aggregations of capital; the corporate trust—of which the Standard Oil Trust, originating in 1881, was the prototype—was designed to eliminate the wastes of competition, but has been used to limit production, control prices, and monopolize markets. Thus has arisen an industrial economy which syndicates each form of production over the area of a continent and seeks to incorporate the world.\n\nThe direct result of these changes has been that articles in all lines of production are made more cheaply in large factories with power machines than in the small shops by hand labor. The demand for the latter, except in some lines of artistic production, has ceased. The master workman dismissed his journeyman and apprentices, and eventually betook himself with his household to the city, to become factory operatives.\n\nThe final outcome has been an almost inconceivably great increase in material production, together with a general advance in conditions of living, but with lamentable failure to reap the full advantage in human welfare of the new conditions. The strain of toil has been lightened, hours of labor have been shortened, scarcity of the necessities of life has largely ceased; men are housed and clad and fed with such comfort and plenty as our forefathers never knew. But at every step of the process the persons displaced have suffered hardship. Wealth has increased enormously, but an undue share of the reward has gone into the hands of the few. New realms are made subject to our command, but in the process the human element has been too much disregarded. A system which gives us the automobile, but which also gives us the rubber atrocities in Congo and Peru for the sake of our automobile tires—and wrongs more widespread if not so deadly here at home—demands control in some way by the Spirit of God through Jesus Christ.\n\nYet the modern industrial system is not the cause, but merely the occasion of such failure. It has furnished some with a greater engine of oppression than any had ever before possessed, only because it has afforded to all a greater means of service than any ever before known. In the material framework of the industrial world we have the structural lines supplied us upon which the finest spiritual development man has as yet conceived of shall presently take place. \"One music, as before, but vaster,\" shall yet arise from the modern world. The new is better than the old.\n\nMoreover, the change is not only for the better, it was also imperative. Malthus was entirely in the right in asserting, from his standpoint amidst the economic conditions of his time, that population was rapidly pressing upon the limits of the means of subsistence. Though the greater portion of the race was then engaged in agriculture, food production was insufficient for increase of population, whereas now greater abundance for all is furnished by the moiety of the population which still remains upon the land, and every prospect promises greater abundance for yet larger population for indefinite periods in the future.\n\nThe opening up of new lands under the old economic conditions would not have bettered matters, inasmuch as agricultural regions such as Saskatchewan now is could not have become the base of support for more densely populated distant regions apart from modern means of transportation; nor, indeed, could agricultural regions such as these have come into being, for their needed manufactured products could not have been transported to them. All expansion must have been expansion of the limits of the community organized as it then was.\n\nNot only so, but to Malthus's position we must add this—that population was pressing upon the limits of manufacture as well as of food supply, for man had come to the limits of available power. It could, we are persuaded, be shown from the records of the time that the amount of power derived from the muscular energy of the horse and the ox had begun to diminish in proportionate quantity, and that derived from human muscles to increase. And for this underlying cause, that the power drawn from the labor of the horse and ox calls for a greater extent of land surface for food supply than does the same amount of power derived from the muscles of men. This is the explanation of the use of human labor in the heaviest tasks in China and Japan. The tourist is shocked as he listens to the forced respiration of the coolies while they haul carts laden with builders' materials up the Bluff at Yokohama; the philanthropist is stirred to indignation as he sees the Chinaman carry, poised on the head cradle, the heavy timbers of the Yunnan forests to their place of use on the Great Plain. I have seen teams of a thousand men, with intensest strain of the muscles, spurred on by the crack of the lash, haul the heavy hulls of junks up the inclined planes of mud which form the locks of the Grand Canal of China. Such human toil is due to the relative dearness of animal labor amidst a dense population as its sole cause. This, and not indifference to human suffering, this, and not lack of inventiveness, lays such loads upon the coolies of the Orient.\n\nWhen the sedan chair was first used in England it was a common remark that men were made to do the work of beasts. The first letters patent for the keep of sedan chairs for hire in London were granted in order \"to prevent the unnecessary use of coaches.\" As England increased further in population she must have called other men from her looms to become porters of the webs woven; she must have bidden her plowmen become delvers of the soil. In China the mattock replaces the plow, and the roller is drawn, not by horses or oxen, but by men. To this pass Europe was coming, was perilously near, when the power of steam came to her rescue. The world had come to a pass where advance in civilization or regression towards savagery were the only paths possible. There was no middle way of stability. The new order came to relieve alike the weaver at the loom and the husbandman at the plow.\n\nThe loss of village commerce is following that of the village crafts. A quarter of a century ago the village storekeeper was a prosperous man. He was not uncommonly the wealthiest man in the community. His place of business served, in a way, as a social centre. His family, and he himself, were helpers and leaders in every social enterprise, including the church. Then in 1876 John Wanamaker organized the Departmental Store and the Mail Order System. He had earlier become a disciple of Ruskin in holding that chaffering had no legitimate place in trade, and that an absolutely one-price system must prevail. Cheap and rapid transit made the mail-order system possible. The one-price system and exact description in advertising, together with large turnover and direct service, made it efficient. Retail trading has in consequence been revolutionized. Wholesaling half a century ago was done over the counter. The country trader travelled to the city to place his orders. Then came the drummer, the modern \"commercial man.\" As completely as wholesale trade was thereby recast in new moulds, so fully is retailing now being made over. We are in the last hours of the older day. Here, again, as in the case of the village crafts, the outcome has been an ultimate economic benefit, but an immediate social loss. Severe distress is felt by the class displaced. And the community loses one more of its progressive elements.\n\nBut the decrease in rural population is chiefly due to the removal from the country community of farmers' households. What is the explanation of their removal?\n\nOne factor in Eastern Canada was the opening up to settlement of the rich wheat lands of Manitoba by the building of the Canadian Pacific Railroad in 1885. The beginning of marked depletion of population in Ontario occurs in the following year, 1886. But another and more universal factor had been already at work for a generation, and was, just at that juncture, attaining full force. For the art of farming also was revolutionized by the introduction of machinery and of power. True, it was as early as 1834 that McCormick invented the reaper. But it was not until the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London in 1861—that revealer of so many tendencies—that the utility of the reaper was demonstrated. The year 1835 gave us the most primitive form of the thresher, but in 1864 the first steam thresher was used. In 1874 the binder came, but not until 1886 did its usefulness begin, when its fingers learned to knot twine instead of, as before, twisting wire. That year, in which the marked exodus of farmers from the Maritime Provinces and Ontario to Manitoba began, may fairly be said to begin a new period in agriculture. The year which brought in the twine-binder brought also the gang-plow and the use of steam power in plowing. In that year came also the somewhat rapid adoption of the silo. Just before that date the first cream separator to be used on this side of the Atlantic had been set up in the Province of Quebec. About the same period also began the widespread adoption of the modern barn, with its trolley unloader and its installation of a water system. The introduction of improved field machinery, the hay-loader, the potato-digger, the manure-spreader; the employment of the traction engine and the gasoline motor, has kept pace with the remodelling of the barn. The outcome of these changes is that one man, with modern equipment, can accomplish the results achieved by many in the days of hand labor. The Census Bureau of the United States, in a report dealing with the census of 1890, published a comparative table covering the nine principal farm products in 1850, and showing that whereas 570,000,000 days' labor—that of 1,900,000 persons for 300 days—were required to produce them, the same amount of the same staples in 1890 were accounted for by 400,000 persons or 120,000,000 days' labor, slightly over one-fifth requisite forty years before. The ratio of change during the ensuing twenty years has doubtless been accelerated rather than slackened. We would probably be not far wrong in supposing that the efficiency of labor, in the major operations at any rate, is not far from seven times what it was two generations ago.\n\nBut with the increasing use of machinery on the farm has come, with almost equal pace, an increasing demand for farm produce due to increase of city population and to the more lavish consumption accompanying increased wealth. The setting free from farm labor of a certain number follows the introduction of machinery as a matter of course. But why has there not also come fuller satisfaction with farm conditions? Why have we not, while the city grows, at least a stable farm population, with greatly enlarged production per capita, with increasing rural wealth, together with decreasing prices of farm produce, and with greatly enhanced leisure for better living on the farm?\n\nThe world's markets are not glutted with farm goods: the reverse is the case. Prices of farm products have not decreased, but have risen greatly. The steady, general upward trend of all prices is ultimately due to the cheapening of the standard of value—gold. But the proportionate increase in price of one great class of products above another is due to subsidiary causes. The incidence of higher prices upon those with fixed earnings is so severe as to constitute the greatest economic difficulty of our time.\n\nNow, amidst all the increase in the cost of living, that due to enhanced prices of commodities from the farm stands easily first. In the year 1897, when the cost of living was at the lowest point reached for a generation, the index figure for all wholesale prices in Canada stood at 92.2. But the average index figure for all farm produce was still lower, namely, 86.7. Two years later, when the average index figure for all commodities throughout Canada stood almost exactly at par, 100.1, the figure for all farm produce throughout Canada had risen more rapidly and stood at 96.7. In 1903 the general index figure for all products and the index figure for all farm products had become almost identical, 110.5 for the former, and 110.9 for the latter. By 1907 the index figure for all commodities had mounted to 126.2, but that for agricultural commodities to 129.5. The sudden drop in textiles in the following year, from 126.1 in 1907 to 111.0 in 1908, brought down the average index figure for all commodities for the year to 120.8, while the figure for farm products had gone up to 131.1. In 1909, when the general figure was 121.2, that for agricultural productions had grown to 134.9. In 1910 the general index number reached 124, but the farm index number had soared to 136.9. In 1911 the figures had become 127.2 for all articles, and 139.4 for the farm's share. But in the bulletin issued for the month of June, 1912, when the cost of living throughout Canada, as indicated by the index number for wholesale prices in general, had reached the highest point since our records began to be kept, the highest since our prices were driven upward by the civil war in the United States, namely 136.9, the average index for all agricultural products throughout Canada had soared to the incredible height of 172.7. This is demonstrative evidence that the agricultural base of modern life is with us in Canada insufficient. A greater production on the farm is imperatively demanded for the nation's sake.\n\nOf equally absorbing interest is a detailed comparison of the factors in the cost of living due to the prices of different classes of goods for the month named, June, 1912. The index figure for beef is an even 200; that for poultry, 222; for all animals and meats, 178.9; for all grains and fodders, 189.5; for all dairy products—lowest among produce of the farm—137.4; for all other foods, 185.3. But the very highest of all lines apart from farm products is just on a level with the lowest of these, the index figure for boots and shoes being 137.9. That for all building materials comes next, 131.5; for all textiles, 120.7; for drugs and chemicals, 114.4; for housefurnishings of all kinds, 112.8; for all metals and implements, 112.7; for all fuel and lighting, 106.\n\nThat the agricultural base of supply in Canada is becoming insufficient, and that a more general production upon the farm is imperatively needed, is shown also by the falling off in the supply of several staple farm products. Canada in 1903 exported to Britain over 34,000,000 pounds of butter. During the last nine months of 1912 this export trade had entirely ceased; not a pound of butter was shipped to Britain. On the contrary, Canada now imports butter from New Zealand. During 1912 we imported in all 5,714,405 pounds, in value amounting to $1,511,654. Of eggs Canada imported during the year, chiefly from the United States, 11,007,345 dozen, paying for them $2,327,924, and paying upon them in customs duties $330,219. Of stall-fed cattle over 45,000 head were shipped from Montreal to Britain in 1911, but less than 6,000 head in 1912. In 1881 there were 3,048,678 sheep upon the farms of Canada; in 1901, 2,510,239; in 1911, 2,106,010. Were we to examine other smaller lines of farm produce we should find the same rule holding good. For instance, we exported in 1912 $6,541 worth of beans, and imported $210,145 worth. Were we to examine the output of each Province we should find the same record. Ontario, for instance, had in 1912 106,000 fewer dairy cattle upon her farms than in 1911. The receipts of fat cattle at the Toronto stock yards fell off from 317,000 head in 1910 to 273,000 head in 1911. Corresponding facts might be cited from every Province and in many fields of output. A fuller production upon the farm is needed and would bring sure reward.\n\nFINEST OF FOREST LAND, UNFIT FOR HUSBANDRY.\n\nHere throve the forest primeval; erosion followed removal.\n\nIn the face of such a showing as this concerning relative prices and lowered production, one may well ask in the interest of the general community, \"Why is there migration from the farm!\" and in the interest of the farmer, \"Why is there dissatisfaction with farm life?\" The replacing of hand labor by machinery cannot be the sole explanation. Many of our townships had reached their maximum of population before the chief developments in machinery had taken place. Many New England \"towns\" were becoming depleted as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century. Let us endeavor to search out some of the main causes.\n\nThe invariable rule is found to be that depletion shows itself first and works out most completely on the less fertile soils. I have stated that along the nearest concession road to Spencerville, right over against the village, are found seven adjoining farms without a resident farmer. That tract of land is high-lying, stony, thin-soiled over rock, and arid, beyond any adjoining areas. Yet on that now arid territory stumps of pine still remain as evidence of a heavy growth of white pine whose trunks were two and even three feet in diameter.\n\nWe thus reach the first of the economic causes of the migration from the farm, due to an error in the field of conservation of natural resources, namely the opening up to settlement and denuding of their forests of lands less profitable for agriculture than for forestry. Lands that are very valuable for forestry may be quite valueless for agriculture. A light soil of limited depth which when cleared washes with the rain, leaving exposed rock, but which is held by binding roots while under forest, is one example. Gravel which parts readily with its water in the open but remains moist when in woods is another. Sand which drifts with the wind is a third. \"It is a known fact that in certain upland parts of the Eastern United States the average level of the ground-water has fallen from ten to forty feet . . . while springs and wells have permanently failed.\"[14] In their original condition forests throve on these lands. Once cleared it was impossible to maintain conditions under which profitable agriculture could be carried on. Even re-afforesting has become difficult. This condition holds of a large part of the mountainous and hilly districts of the world. Yet upon these districts the waterflow of the streams, and consequently the humidity of the climate, and ultimately the productiveness of all lands depend. Yet the policy of our Governments long fostered exploitation of the forests upon such lands.\n\nA great economic wrong has been inflicted upon the world by the exploitation of all natural resources, a waste made possible by modern means of transportation and manufacture employed under control of the purpose of present gain alone, untempered by the thought of service or of responsibility for the future; a wrong of such magnitude as to amount to actual spoliation of coming generations, of such magnitude as to amount to actual defiance of the God of Providence.\n\nThe world of to-day is in the position of an heir who has come into possession of a great estate and is recklessly squandering his patrimony:\n\nEngineering science has made it possible for men to draw rapidly upon all resources; transportation has made it possible to seize the pristine wealth of all continents, and the foolish heir of the ages has not come to his senses in regard to the use of his new domain.\n\nMen are to-day becoming millionaires through selfish exploitation of forest and stream and field and mine and ocean, and of the toil of their fellow men until not only the blood of the poor innocents, but also the dried-up beds of the brooks, the bared rocks of the hillsides, the weed-covered, scrub-covered fields of our fathers, the shaft-and-tunnel trap-doors of forsaken mines, and the extinct genera of sky and earth and sea cry aloud to God who made all things very good, to the God who \"worketh even until now,\" that He might fashion this earth as a fit habitation for all men of all generations.\n\nI charge our farmers, who go to the West to exploit the virgin fertility of the prairies and have no thought of making a permanent home for themselves or their children there, with a dastardly crime against society;—yet it is a crime in which they are but feeble imitators of the objects of men's worship to-day, the millionaire exploiters of the world's wealth.\n\nOur fathers sinned, both in ignorance and wilfully, and we their children are paying the penalty in depleted communities, but even while paying the penalty we are sinners beyond our fathers.\n\nYet again, we have other unoccupied farms where substantial buildings, enclosed garden-plots and trim fields, as well as local history, attest the existence of profitable farming carried on in the recent past. Here we reach another error in the realm of conservation—unscientific farming that has depleted the fertility of lands which should have grown in productive capacity under tillage.\n\nAmong all recent movements one of the richest promise is that of the national conservation of natural resources. Of these, looked at in their widest range, human efficiency stands first; but next to it, in power for good or ill upon human welfare, undoubtedly ranks fertility of the soil. The Committee on Lands of the Dominion Commission of Conservation carried on in 1911 an investigation in the form of an Agricultural Survey of 1,212 farms throughout the Dominion, 100 in each of the Maritime Provinces, 200 in Quebec, 300 in Ontario, and 412 in the four western Provinces, to discover whether there was upon these farms conservation of fertility, of labor, and of health. The information received was neither second-hand nor superficial. The report of the chairman, Dr. J. W. Robertson, informs us that \"In most of the Provinces the farmers are living upon the accumulated capital which nature provided in the soil, leaving their lands poorer because they had been on them.\"[16] Yet a fair number are not only maintaining but increasing fertility, and in this fact is found the ground of hope for the future. They are of the type which survives upon the farm, the class to which all shall yet belong. In Prince Edward Island 51 per cent. report larger yields than they had formerly, the increase dating from 15 to 18 years ago. In Nova Scotia 46 per cent. of the farms examined show an increase; in Quebec, 39 per cent.; in New Brunswick and in Ontario 24 per cent., the increase dating from ten years ago, while in Manitoba not one farmer reports an increase, and 46 per cent. acknowledge a marked decrease. \"The decrease of yield per acre in that Province,\" says Dr. Robertson, \"must be concurrent with exhaustion of fertility.\"\n\nThe broadest inductions we can reach show that this loss is widespread. The area under cultivation in the West—Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta—increased 269 per cent. in the last decade; the amount of products increased only 185 per cent. In the United States the wheat area increased 56 per cent. between 1890 and 1900, the yield only 40 per cent.; the corn area increased 31 per cent., but the yield only 25 per cent.\n\nHere again, as in the case of the exploitation of the forest, the lure of the soil is addressed to the worst that is in man, the appeal of the soil to his best. \"The lure of the Prairies is like unto the lure of the Yukon and the lure of the Cobalt,—'Come and take something, ship it out, and make yourself rich.'\" But the appeal of the soil is that we treat the land with loving care so as to reap ever-increasing profits while preserving the crop-producing power of the soil for the benefit of our descendants. And the reward is not material only, whether present or prospective. \"When man exhausts the soil, what does he do? He helps to make the people more careless and less competent; he leaves them less power and more poverty in every respect. On the other hand, when he preserves and increases the fertility of the soil, the people thereby become increasingly efficient and capable. These two go together. It is for us to see that the fertility of our soil shall be maintained, and that there shall be continuously improving conditions for the rural population.\" \"Consider that report from a virgin Province with the accumulated wealth of 50,000 years of the Creator's deposits in that savings bank of soil; that not one farmer in a hundred has reported any increase over ten years ago, and that 46 per cent. of them have reported a decided decrease. That gives us much food for thought. It brings out a grave situation for consideration. It is to me, much more imminent of blessing or disaster than any other material question now before the West.\"[17]\n\nBut we have not only tracts that are springing up in scrub forest and other areas that afford pasturage for the stock of adjoining farmers; the major portion of the land in the township of Edwardsburg is for sale. Not that it is all so advertised, though much of it is. Leading Edwardsburg farmers assure me that three out of four of the farmers in the township are ready to accept any reasonable offer for their acres. Why should this be the case?\n\nThe Lands Committee of the Conservation Commission carried on in 1911 an investigation gleaning information fairly representative of the actual conditions in each Province in regard to the practice of well-planned farming as shown by systematic rotation of crops, the practice of sowing selected seed, and the application of manures; and also as to the inroads of weeds, insect pe"
