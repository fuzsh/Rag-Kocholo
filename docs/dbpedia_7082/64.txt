David Wilson Hart

David Wilson Hart passed away peacefully on 03 February 2021, at home in Botwood, Newfoundland, at the age of 75.

He was born on 04 May 1945 in Grantown-on-Spey, Inverness-shire, Scotland, to Mathilda Kemp (Bunty) Anderson of Aviemore, Inverness-shire, Scotland, and James Everett Hart of Botwood, Newfoundland. In the same year, Bunty and Jim emigrated along with their young sons, Everett and Dave, to Newfoundland and made their home there.

He met Charlotte Patricia (Pat) Smith in Toronto, and they later married on 03 August 1968, at St. Cuthbert’s United Church in Toronto. They adopted their son, James David (Jimmy) Hart, and a year later were blessed with a daughter, Kemp Patricia Hart.

Dave worked as a high steel tradesman and was part of the crew that built the TD bank centre in Toronto, Ontario. He also appeared in a CBC Canadian film that highlighted steel workers, where he played “himself!”

Some of his passions included boating on “Hart’s Content,” moose-hunting and fishing with family and friends. He loved playing his 12-string guitar and “ugly stick,” enjoying a sing-song, and dancing a “Newfie jig.” Born with many musical talents he shared his heart through music.

After retiring, Dave never slowed down, helping family and friends with their renovations, utilizing his skills as a finishing carpenter. Then, fulfilling his dream, he headed back to Newfoundland in 2015. He bought a cabin by the sea as well as a new truck, and shared “life on the Rock” with Beverley Gosse-Kinden.

Dave leaves behind his partner of many years, Patricia, and their two children, Jimmy and Kemp Hart, along with a granddaughter, Kelsey Emma Rumley. Also leaving behind his brothers, Everett (Colleen), Robert (Jean), Cecil (Ruth), Cyril (Gail), and sisters Mary (Jack), and Jeanette Hart, as well as many nieces and nephews, friends and neighbours, including close friend Gladstone Mercer (Hazel).

We will miss him greatly, but are comforted that he is with his mom and dad.

Michael Raymond Bridgeman

With heavy hearts and great sadness we announce the death of Michael Raymond Bridgeman on December 20, 2020. He passed quietly in his sleep. Mike was born on St. Brendan’s Island, Newfoundland on August 12, 1923, son to William and Mary Anne, brother to Jack, Martin, Bernard, Alice, Margaret (all predeceased). Beloved husband of 64 years to Mary. Dear father to Linda (Glen), Eileen (Chris), Doreen, Michael (Fawn), Bill (Fiona) and John (Catherine). Loved by his grandchildren Chris (Angela), Justin (Courtney), Ashley, Liam, Delaney, Sadie, Jack, Billy, Kaitlyn and Jacob, as well as great grandchildren Felicity, Isabelle, Madison, Charlotte and Peter. He was a much loved uncle to many nieces and nephews.

Mike grew up building and sailing schooners to fish cod and salmon on the Grand Banks and the Labrador, joining the crew when just 12 years old. He was very proud of his time at the splitting table. Like many a Newfoundlander before and since, he saw opportunity and a future for his family in Toronto, moving there in the 50s. After a few years in Scarborough, Mike and Mary moved to Pickering in 1967. Being the father of three boys, he was always happy to help with coaching duties in both WestShore and Holy Redeemer leagues, mostly hockey but baseball too. A devoutly religious man, he was very active in the Holy Redeemer church community, where he became involved in the Manresa Retreat House, captaining retreats for over 40 years. Mike was an active member with the Knights of Columbus, a charter member of the Holy Redeemer Council for over 60 yrs. Mike was also a proud member of Ironworkers Local 721, and only when his health stopped him did he cease marching with them in the Labour Day parade, some 50 years.

Joe was a very kind and good hearted man, husband, father, grandpa and friend. His door was always open to everyone. He loved to dance and entertain and there was always enough food to feed any friend that his kids would bring home. He loved his cottage and later home on Cordova Lake, golfing and enjoying early evening fishing. His strong values and consideration and respect for others was just who he was. His smile, happy demeanor and beautiful blue eyes will live in our hearts and memories forever.

We would like to thank the wonderful nurses and doctors at the Northumberland Hills Hospital in Cobourg for taking great care of Joe.

Van Horne, Calvin Rowe

“Calvin Rowe Van Horne, son of the late Bethune and Winston Van Horne was born on January 12,1950, in the parish of Westmoreland, Jamaica West Indies and passed on October 22, 2020.

Calvin attended Savanna La Mar Secondary School. After he graduated his passion was to be a plumber, and his dream was to travel. He was successful in accomplishing both. He was an excellent plumber and enjoyed helping his family and friends with their plumbing needs. He travelled to the Bahamas, Cayman Island and Canada as his final destination and home. He became a Canadian Citizen, and worked very hard to achieve all his goals, including going back to school (George Brown College) to attain another trade as a welder and became a proud member of the Iron Workers Union.

He met and married the love of his life Barbara Lashley. They shared 50 wonderful and inseparable years together.Their marriage produced six children combined, two sons and four daughters. Shelly, Ricky, Kathy, Davon, Dawn and Kevin.

Calvin was a loving, caring family man who worked very hard and provided for his family. He made sure that Barbara and the kids had all they needed and he was always there for the family. Calvin loved his family dearly and he cherished his grand-children. He was always there for them and his love and dedication for his family can be seen in the relationship they had with him even unto death. Calvin was loved by everyone who knew him, always willing to help, very seldom he would say no. No matter how sick he was or if he was in pain, he never complained he put his trust in God and prayed.

One of his greatest passions was cooking and eating. He loved good food and he loved to cook. As a family we always enjoyed many of his special dishes that he liked to prepare. Holidays were always fun because everyone looked forward going to Dad/Granddad as he was affectionately called, knowing he would have lots of good food for everyone (and drinks). The last thing he did for his beautiful wife was to make her favourite barbecue.

Calvin is survived by his wife Barbara, six children, grandchildren, great grandchildren. Three brothers and one sister all living in the USA, nephews, nieces, cousins countless family members ,and many friends all over the world.

He will be greatly missed by his family and all those who knew him.

May his soul rest in peace, Perpetual Peace.

He will be greatly missed by his wife of 27 years Patsy and son Daniel and wife Emily, grandchildren Alyssa and Breanna of Camrose, Alberta. He will be missed by many. David was a major Toronto Blue Jay’s fan and also loved music and took up guitar playing later in life, hosting many fun filled Friday night jams. David was able to live out his dream job of farming for most of his life in and around the Orangeville/ Grand Valley area. The last few years of his life he was an iron worker/ rod buster where he thoroughly enjoyed the comradely of everyone he worked with and actually looked forward to going to work. He also enjoyed grooming the snowmobile trails for the Huronia/ Orangeville club. He had great fun coaching ball hockey for the Orangeville New Hope Community Church. David was a true friend of rare character who treated everyone as his brother and right to the end was concerned about helping others.
