        "text": "31st – Ramón Fonst Cuban fencer was born today in 1883. Although born in Cuba, he spent most of his youth in France, where he received his fencing education, and aged just 16 years he entered the 1900 Olympics Men’s épée event. He was up against another 101 fencers from 10 other countries, in his first-round group he came out top against the five fencers from France, so advanced into the next round, where he only managed to finish third but was still good enough to advance to the semi-finals and again he would finish third in the group and so qualifying for the final. In the final, Fonst was up against seven French and one Argentine fencer, and against the odds (and the judges) he won four of his six matches to win the gold and so became the first Cuban and first Latin American medallist on the Olympic stage. A few days later, Fonst competed in the Men’s amateurs-masters épée which put the top four amateurs with the top four professionals at the Games, Fonst managed to win six of his seven contests and won the silver medal, his only defeat was against the French professional Albert Ayat who went on to win the gold medal. Four years later, Fonst was in St.Louis, Missouri, competing at the 1904 Olympics, and within two days he won three gold medals, he retained his Olympic title in the Men’s épée, and added the Men’s foil title and under the Mixed team banner he won the Men’s team foil event with fellow Cuban Manuel Díaz and American Albertson Van Zo Post. Cuba didn’t compete in the Summer Olympics again until 1924, which was again held in Paris. Now aged 40, Fonst again competed in the Men’s épée but this time only managed to reach the semi-final, he also competed in the Men’s team épée but they were knocked out of the competition in the quarter-finals. After his career as an active sportsmen Fonst became president of the National Olympic Committee fo Cuba, as well as an adviser for the Department of Physical Education and Sports, which he served until he died from a diabetic coma in 1959, aged 76 years old. The former England cricket captain GO ‘Gubby’ Allen was born in 1902. He was three months short of his 46th birthday when he played in his 25th and last Test match in the West Indies in 1948. He died in 1989 aged 87. In 1910 8th Tour de France was won by Octave Lapize of France. Indian cricketer and coach Hemu Adhikari was born in 1919, his career spanned three decades. A talented right-handed batsman and occasional leg spin bowler, he made his [first-class cricket first-class] debut as a teenager before the outbreak of World War II in the 1936/37 domestic season. He immediately demonstrated his abilities on the local stage but due to the war, and his role in the Indian armed forces, his career was interrupted. Adhikari made his Test debut as a 28-year-old in 1947 on India’s tour of Australia and immediately established himself as an important member of the squad, although his continued official role in the army restricted his availability for the team. He took to coaching after retiring from first-class cricket – with a very good batting average of 41.74 – and was in charge of the Indian team as they established themselves on the world stage. He helped guide India to their first series win in England in 1971 and was a major reason behind the development of such outstanding cricketers as Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri. Some felt his history with military helped him as a coach, with former national team spin bowler Bapu Nadkarni saying “Adhikari was a disciplined man. Being a military man, he would not bother about what anybody else thought.” On this day in 1928 Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female track and field Olympic gold medallist, when she broke her own world record with a throw of 39.62 metres to claim victory in the discus at Amsterdam.

Fellow driver Guy Edwards managed to avoid the blazing wreckage but Harald Ertl and Brett Lunger both hit it. All three drivers raced to the burning Ferrari and, with the help of the Italian driver Arturo Merzario, who also stopped, eventually managed to pull 27-year-old Lauda from his vehicle. Within six weeks of the accident Lauda was back behind the wheel. He fought for his life for several days following the accident and suffered horrendous burns to his head and face.

The Tour de France had proved a success when the first race was run in 1903 and both the competition between riders and the passion of the fans who supported them rose to sometimes dangerous proportions. Riders took trains and lifts in cars or had themselves towed by drivers, the 1903 winner, Maurice Garin received food from the race director, Géo Lefèvre when others were denied. Fans beat up riders on the col de la République outside St-Étienne and dispersed only when Garin fired his gun. Other spectators threw nails on the road on the last day and Cornet rode the last 40km on flat tyres. After many complaints about widespread cheating, the top four finishers were disqualified by the French cycling union. It declared Cornet the winner although he had taken three hours more than Garin, the winner, and receiving an official warning that suggests his own conduct was less than pristine. Desgrange said he would never run the race again. Cornet is the Tour’s youngest winner at 19 years 11 months and 20 days. Henri Cornet never had further success in the Tour, dropping out in 1905 on the fourth day. He won Paris–Roubaix and came second in Bordeaux–Paris in 1906, and came eighth in the 1908 Tour de France, in which he won a one-lap time-trial held at the end of the race in the Parc des Princes. It was a demonstration race and did not count for the overall result of the Tour. Cornet rode his last Tour de France in 1912, finishing 28th. He had repeated health problems, however, which brought his career to an end. He stopped racing with the start of World War I. He retired to work in the cycle business and died after a hospital operation at 56. Ernesto Maserati, Italian automotive engineer and racer was born in 1898. Working with Maserati of Modena since its inception in Bologna on 14th December 1914, with his brothers Alfieri Maserati (leader), Ettore Maserati, Bindo Maserati and others.

His racing career started in 1924, when he won the Italian drivers’ championship in 1927 in the Maserati Tipo 26, in 1930 using the Tipo 8C-2500. After his brother Alfieri Maserati died in 1932, Ernesto became the director, chief engineer as well as sole racing car driver of the company. The company was sold to Adolfo Orsi in 1937, but the brothers remained on a ten-year contract, Ernesto participating in the design of the Maserati A6 after World War II. He left with Ettore and Bindo (1947), to found the OSCA car company. He died at Bologna in 1975. The 5th running of the Tour de France was won on this day in 1907 by Lucien Petit-Breton of France. America distance runner and athlete, considered by many to be the greatest miler of all time, Glenn Cunningham was born in 1909. Cunningham was nicknamed the “Kansas Flyer”, the “Elkhart Express” and the “Iron Horse of Kansas”. Cunningham’s legs were very badly burned in an explosion caused when someone accidentally put gasoline instead of kerosene in the can at his school when he was eight and his brother Floyd was thirteen. Floyd died in the fire. When the doctors recommended amputating Glenn’s legs, he was so distressed his parents would not allow it. The doctors predicted he might never walk normally again. He had lost all the flesh on his knees and shins and all the toes on his left foot. Also, his transverse arch was practically destroyed. However, his great determination, coupled with hour upon hour of a new type of therapy, enabled him to gradually regain the ability to walk and to proceed to run. It was in the early summer of 1919 when he first tried to walk again, roughly two years after the accident. He competed in both the 1932 and 1936 Olympics and while on the ship travelling from the USA to Germany, he was voted “Most Popular Athlete” by his fellow Olympians. Cunningham won the Sullivan medal in 1933 for his various running achievements in middle distance. In the 1932 Olympics he was 4th in the 1500m, and in 1936 he took silver. In 1934, he set the world record for the mile run at 4:06.8, which stood for three years and in 1936, he set the world record in the 800m. In 1938, he set a world record in the indoor mile run of 4:04.4. He retired from competition in 1940. Cunningham’s goal, which he never achieved, was a four-minute mile. In 1945 American golfer Byron Nelson won the Canadian Open to notch up his 11th consecutive tournament victory. He finished fourth in this net tournament, the Memphis Open, but went on to win a further seven competitions in the year to give him a record 18 ‘firsts’ on the US Tour. In 1957 the Argentine racing driver Juan Manual Fangio won the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring to clinch his record-breaking fifth, and last, world title. The race was also the 24th and last Grand Prix win of his career, at record at the time. Unlike the other drivers, Fangio started the race with the fuel tank of his Maserati half full. He drove carefully until the halfway stage at which point he refuelled. He came out of the pits with a deficit of 45 seconds to make up. The 46-year-old proceeded to break the track record in lap after lap, eventually overhauling the race leaders to take the checkered flag. Mary Teresa Slaney (formerly Tabb, née Decker was born in 1958, she is a retired American middle-distance runner. During her career, she won gold medals in the 1500m and 3000m at the 1983 World Championships, and was the world record holder in the mile, 5000m and 10,000m. In total, she set 17 official and unofficial world records, including being the first woman in history to run less than 4:20 for the mile. She also set 36 US national records at distances ranging from 800m to 10,000m, and has held the US record in the mile, 2000m and 3000m since the early 1980s, while her 1500m record stood for 32 years. In 2003, she was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Decker is most remembered for the events surrounding the 3000m at the 1984 Olympics. Decker was heavily favoured to win and in the final, barefoot runner, Britain’s Zola Budd, side by side with Decker for three laps and moved ahead. In an attempt to put pressure on Budd, Decker remained close by in a crowded space. Decker stood on Budd, then shortly after, collided with the barefoot runner and fell spectacularly to the curb. As a result, Mary Decker did not finish the race, which was won by Maricica Puica of Romania (Budd finished seventh). Decker was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. At a press conference she said that Budd was to blame for the collision. While it is generally the trailing athlete’s responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead, it is also an accepted convention among most distance runners that the leader be a full stride ahead before cutting in. Track officials initially disqualified Budd for obstruction, but she was reinstated just one hour later once officials had viewed films of the race. Despite being behind Budd, Decker’s claim that Budd had bumped into her leg was supported by a number of US sports journalists, and Budd was hounded constantly in the press as a result, receiving a number of death threats. The claim was never accepted by the director of the games or the IAAF. Decker and Budd next met in July 1985, in a 3000m race at Crystal Palace, Decker won the race, and Budd finished in fourth place. After the race, the two women shook hands and made up. Decker later went on record as claiming that she was unfairly robbed of the LA 3000m gold medal by Budd, but said many years after the event “The reason I fell, some people think she tripped me deliberately. I happen to know that wasn’t the case at all. The reason I fell is because I am and was very inexperienced in running in a pack.
