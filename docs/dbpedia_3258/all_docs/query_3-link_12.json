        "text": "NEW YORK – The Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce hosted an event on June 11 at Norton Rose Fulbright Hall in Manhattan titled The Effect of Politics on New York City Real Estate and the Future of Energy in the United States and Abroad.\n\nThe Chamber’s special guest and the evening’s keynote speaker was former New York City mayoral candidate and chairman of the Red Apple Group, John Catsimatidis.\n\nChamber President Markos Drakotos told The National Herald, “we have gathered here today to listen to someone who has been very generous to the Greek community. Indeed, I do not think it is possible for anyone to find a more humble, generous, and noble person than Mr. Catsimatidis. He will talk today about contemporary issues, which makes the event even more interesting. I think listening to business speakers of Mr. Catsimatidis’ caliber benefits everyone. ”\n\nThere was an impressive turnout on Tuesday night at the Chamber’s reception, with representatives from the fields of politics, investment, and the business world attending. George Pataki, past Governor of New York, said to TNH, “The Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce is indeed a great organization and is constantly working to strengthen economic ties between two great countries. Tonight’s speaker is a great businessman but also an important leader. I am honored to be here today.”\n\nDrakotos thanked the attendees and those who helped organize the event. Atlantic Bank President Nancy Papaioannou presented biographical information and conveyed Catsimatidis’ achievements and diverse business life, adding that she expects that Catsimatidis will be the Mayor of New York one day.\n\nThe Greek-American businessman, radio producer and host, owner, President and CEO of the Gristedes Foods food chain and of the Red Apple Group, is a genuine embodiment of the American dream. Catsimatidis is known for his frank and direct style when he shares his views with his radio audience. He also tells personal stories about his birth on the island of Nisyros and his parents’ decision to pursue a better life by migrating to New York.\n\nHis family originally moved to western Harlem and his father worked in restaurants to support his family. Catsimatidis’ humble beginnings did not at all suggest that a few years later he would build an empire literally from scratch. While still a student at NYU, he became the owner of his first grocery store, and by the time he was 25 he owned 10 stores.\n\nDiving into contemporary issues, Catsimatidis made a comparison between the immigration practices at the time his family came to America and those of today, saying: “My father’s two siblings had to sign that in case my father would be unable to pay our rent, they would have to pay it instead of him. It was not like today, when border control is loose and everyone can get in and out of the country as they wish.”\n\nCatsimatidis praised President Donald Trump’s determination to recognize the migration problem and to his having courage to defend the country’s interests.\n\nHe clarified that he is in favor of immigration, because he himself is an immigrant as he said, but added, “we ought to control who is coming and who is leaving.” He also underlined that in the past, immigrants to America believed in the American dream, but that many immigrant groups today want to change America and make it conform to their own ideas.\n\nAddressing the Greek-Americans who were in the audience and emphasizing the value of education for young people, he recommended: “Never forget that our children are competing with peers from all over the world in New York. Being the best in Astoria is no longer enough.”\n\nSharing his business management philosophy, Catsimatidis said “people do what you inspect, not necessarily what you expect” – explaining that if nobody is watching some workers slack off.\n\nIn the 1970’s he realized that his best chance for achieving his financial goals was to expand from the supermarket business to the real estate market.\n\nIn the decades following, Catsimatidis also invested in aviation by acquiring 47 jets and bought the United Refining Company with 371 gas stations. In a self-critical moment, he said one of his main strengths was knowing when to stop and to be sure everything was under control before proceeding to his next strategic move. “You also need vision and courage,” he said.\n\nAt the end of his speech, Catsimatidis answered questions from the audience. Other issues discussed included income tax levels in New York and the recent failure of the deal with Amazon, which he described as an awful thing, attributing it to the failure of the Democratic party’s politicians.\n\nThe audience had the opportunity to witness a more intimate and sensitive side of the businessman at the time when, towards the end, he was obviously moved when talking about his children. Catsimatidis talked about the necessity of family love and the importance for young people to feel safe at home, but also to be free to make mistakes, as mistakes, he said, are of great pedagogical value.\n\nHe also advised parents that, “it is very important to teach your children to have mentors. Many of my mentors were hardworking common sense people, and many of them belonged to the Jewish community. My mentors have really helped me very much. ”\n\nPresent at the event were, among others, Catsimatidis’ wife Margo, Andre Gregory, Elias Katsos, George Pantelides, George Zapantis, Paul Lountzis, Zachary Lountzis, Olga Alexakos, John Stratakis, John Kuris, Athas Ioannou, Eraklis Diamataris, representatives of Southern Star and Brian Devine.\n\nThe post John Catsimatidis Featured Speaker at Hellenic-American Chamber of Commerce Event appeared first on The National Herald.\n\nASTORIA – Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, was the keynote speaker at the St. Demetrios Graduation on June 7. In his moving and inspiring speech, Dr. Yancopoulos shared his personal journey towards success and his family’s and encouraged the graduates to “go out, try to help your fellow man, and change the world for the better.”\n\nDr. Yancopoulos’ speech follows:\n\nYour Grace, Reverend Archimandrite, Dean Papazafiropoulos, Principal/Dr Koularmanis, honored guests, and to the soon-to-be graduates of this great school, and to their teachers, family and friends…. Thank you for the honor of addressing you at this most important moment in your lives…\n\nI also want to remember and honor all those who came before us, who suffered and fought and persevered just so we could be here celebrating your graduation today… My family comes from a town in the very north of modern Greece called Kastoria, a beautiful town built on a lake and surrounded by mountains… we consider ourselves Greek Macedonians – that is, the true Macedonians – and when I was small my father showed me the mountains around us, and he told me never to forget how much blood and sweat was spilled on those mountains, just so we could be standing there that day…. He told me to never forget that I owed so much to those untold generations that came before us, and that the way to repay them was to make sure I made something of my life and contributed to the world, so as to bring them honor….\n\nSo who am I? Well, I look back about 40 years, and I think I was just like many of you are now, just starting out. And then I got to live the great American Dream. Maybe you can hear a little of my story, and that can help you imagine the infinite possibilities of your futures…\n\nLet me start first at the end, before I come back to the beginning.\n\nI am a scientist, what they used to call a gene hunter… and people consider me pretty successful… in my thirties, I was ranked as one of the top ten scientists in the entire world… I started a biotechnology company with my long-time partner Len Schleifer, called Regeneron, which has become one of the biggest in the world… and I think we became successful the right way – that is, we didn’t do it by coming up with some devious business scheme, but by doing something very important for humanity – we invented more important new medicines over the last decade than anyone had over a similar period in history:\n\nOne is the leading drug in the world to cure blindness, from diseases like diabetes and age-related macular degeneration\n\nAnother is a new treatment to prevent heart attacks and heart disease\n\nA third is a breakthrough therapy for severe allergic disease, and diseases including asthma and atopic dermatitis\n\nAnd we came up with several new treatments for previously incurable forms of cancer….\n\nHow did we do this? I love superhero movies… how many of you have watched the X-Men movies? Well, X-men and women really exist… they are simply people who walk amongst us that have special mutations in their genes that give them special powers… well, our strategy at Regeneron was simply to find these X-men and women… we found X-men who were resistant to heart disease, who felt no pain, whose vision could resist blindness, whose bodies fought cancer, even X-men who had really large muscles… and we cloned their mutations and then made medicines that could give the power of these mutations to regular people… and that was our simple strategy, that led to all these important new medical breakthroughs… there was a lot of science around this approach, but it really was pretty much that simple… and our advantage was that others hadn’t really thought of this simple approach before, as a way to come up with important new medicines…\n\nAnd with all these new medicines has come incomprehensible riches… How many of you know who Bruno Mars is? You know his song about “wanting to be a billionaire so freakin’ bad” and “wanting to be on the cover of Forbes”… well, been there, done that… Forbes also every year selects the most innovative companies in the world, and we have been on the top ten of that list every year for the last 10 years… last year we were right behind TESLA, please don’t get me started on how wrong that is…. But anyway…\n\nThat’s where we are now… but let me go back to the beginning and tell you how I got there…. And to what I owe it all to….\n\nI am sure, like many of you, being GREEK defines me…\n\nGrowing up in a Greek immigrant family in NYC, we were very poor but I never even realized it… My parents came in the 1950’s after WWII and the Civil War in Greece, and because of that they never finished school, and we never had much money… I never realized we weren’t rich, because, most importantly, I was lucky to have the greatest parents and grandparents and sister in the world… and the greatest extended family of cousins and uncles and aunts…. And we all lived together and supported each other… there is for sure nothing better than growing up in a big Greek family….\n\nI was born in Manhattan, and then baptized in the Bronx, but when I was small we moved right here – this was my neighborhood for a while, and St Demetrios was my church, but we kept moving, and by high school my church was Transfiguration of Christ in Corona, where I was in the GOYA and played basketball….\n\nMy parents always insisted on only speaking Greek at home, and when I went to public school on the first day – a little kid walking into PS11 in Woodside on a beautiful fall day in 1964 – I’ll never forget that day – I didn’t even know that English existed. I was in shock, I had no idea what was happening. And I was very slow in learning a new language, and I actually failed the 1st grade. Back then they didn’t have programs like English as a 2nd language, and there was no such thing as “political correctness” – they just put all the kids who failed 1st grade into what they then called the MR class, for Mentally Retarded.\n\nBut my parents and grandparents wouldn’t let me think that there was something wrong with me. In fact, they made me believe the opposite, that even then, there was greatness inside of me. How did they make me believe this?\n\nThey told me about all the greatness in our Greek ancestry… from Homer to Herotodus, from Odysseus to Alexander, from Hippocrates to Socrates… and they told me that all that greatness still lived inside of me and inside of all Greeks… They told me that the blood of Alexander flowed in my veins, and so I could conquer anything… It does not matter whether any of that was true, it only mattered that they made a 7 year old boy believe it.\n\nMy father told me that America was the greatest country in the world, and if you were just willing to work for it, you could accomplish anything here… He told me that his role -because he had no education and training – was to work hard so his children could get a better education and then be able to do anything. And most importantly, he told me that Greeks were smarter, more creative, and harder working than other Americans, and that we were destined to succeed. Once again, it didn’t matter if any of that was true, the only thing that mattered is that I believed everything he told me.\n\nAnd the most important story he told me was about a hero and role model very close to home, which he claimed proved I could overcome anything. He told me my own “Founder Tale”. How many of you are named after your Grandfather??? I see by the raised hands that many of your families follow that tradition, and thus that many of you are named after your Grandfathers!\n\nSo am I, my Pappou’s name is my name, George Damis Damianos Yancopoulos. My father told me I was named after my grandfather for a reason. He told me my grandfather was born in 1883 – think of that, just imagine how long ago that is – as a Turkish slave in a little village. Many in his family were killed by the Turks, and he became a Freedom Fighter but was captured. He managed to escape and somehow found his way to Vienna, Austria. I can’t even imagine how someone from a small Xorio can escape and make it to Vienna. There, he saw the magic of electricity – he saw electric lights for the first time – there was nothing like it in his little village – and he was sure it was magic. And he wanted to learn everything he could about this magic. He didn’t even know how to read or write, and he couldn’t speak German – his job was sweeping the floors of the famous old Vienna Opera House – but he knew he wanted to devote his life to this magic. So he started taking the librettos about the opera home with him at night, and used them to try to learn German. And somehow he did, and somehow he got himself into University, and somehow and unbelievably he became an electrical engineer, learning how to build electrical power plants, because his dream was to go back to his homeland and bring back the magic of electricity. And he managed to do this. He went back to Greece and built many of Greece’s first electrical power plants, bringing light to his Patrida. And with this, he achieved incomprehensible wealth, becoming one of the richest Greeks at the time. Just to show how fragile life can be, and sometimes how we move in circles —- at the height of my grandfather’s success, the Nazis came, they nationalized his plants, and he was imprisoned and left penniless. And my father, who had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth and was now a teenager, joined the resistance and essentially became a freedom fighter just like his father had been.\n\nSo what’s the lesson in this? Once again, what mattered to me was that my father made me believe that if my grandfather could rise from being a slave to such heights, and that I was named after him, I could do anything as well. Whatever I achieved in life, it was only because my father made me believe that I could do it.\n\nSo what have I learned, and is there maybe something you can learn from my journey?\n\nI think 40 years ago I was maybe not that different from who you are now. I was a young Greek kid coming out of high school. Back when I was your age, I saw many problems in the world, and I was inspired to use the power of science to try to make a difference in the world by curing disease. I am sure you see many challenges facing our world, and you dream about offering hope and solutions, changing the world. You are at the beginning of the incredible adventure of life. And in your adventure you have an incredible advantage. I believe in the magic of the human spirit, and there is no greater human spirit than that of the Greeks. Your great Hellenic history flows through you, both empowering you but also obligating you to do honor to the sacrifices of your parents, as well as of all the others who came before you. You are all Hellenes, and its your turn to go out and conquer – whether it be disease, global warming, poverty, hunger, politics or business – go out, try to help your fellow man, and change the world for the better. It will not be easy, there will be many challenges and failures along the way, you will struggle and have to find a new way… but I encourage you to embrace these struggles as opportunities – to prove who you really are, to reinvent yourself, and to consider audacious new possibilities and paths.\n\nI’ll never forget the pride of my father, who was in the Greek army for years, and how proud he was that the Greeks brought the first victory against what at that time seemed an unconquerable evil empire – turning back the Nazis at the Albanian border in October of 1940. He always reminded me that because of that first victory against the Nazis, Winston Churchill said that from here on forward, that it will be said that all Heroes fight like Hellenes. Well, you are all Hellenes, you all have greatness inside of you, and it is time to go out and be Heroes.\n\nThanks for your attention.\n\nThe post Dr. Yancopoulos’ Speech at the St. Demetrios Graduation appeared first on The National Herald.\n\nJUNE 4-28\n\nMANHATTAN – The Consulate General of Greece in New York and Timarete Hellenic Art Festival are pleased to announce “Inside, Outside and Beyond” a group exhibition at the Consulate General’s premises, 69 East 79th Street in Manhattan, June 4-28.

Giannopoulos, age 59, of Exeter, Rhode Island, passed away on May 31 at home after a seven-year-long battle with cancer. Angelo was born in the village of Haravgi, Pogoniou, in Epirus, Greece to Hristos Giannopoulos and Parthenia (Goumenos) Giannopoulos. Evangelos was the husband of Sandy (Xanthoula) Giannopoulos for 27 years, and a loving father to Parthenia and Eleni. Angelo lived as a child in Greece, but immigrated to the United States at age 14 with his family and settled in New London, CT. He attended New London High School, and while he did not speak English, he excelled in math and science and a few great teachers gave him the confidence to pursue engineering in college. He went on to graduate from UConn in 1981 with a degree in engineering and furthered his education with a Masters Degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He immediately began work at NUSC/NUWC, and continued his work in New London and Newport over the next 37 years. During this time he also earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering from URI in 1999. He was a recognized expert, both in industry and academia, in the field of sonar signal processing and automation. His efforts directly supported all the current classes of U.S. Navy submarines with his last position being Chief Engineer for Submarine and Surveillance Sonar Systems, providing the technical oversight and quality assurance for a variety of projects. He was awarded the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) Bronze Award for outstanding achievement in the field of Undersea Warfare (USW) and the NUWC Decibel Award for his contributions in the field of underwater acoustics. Most importantly, Angelo was a highly-respected colleague, mentor, and friend who made a positive impact within the NUWC community and he will be deeply missed. Angelo was a devoted parishioner of the St. Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church. He served on the Parish Council for 10 years, and was dedicated to sharing Greek history and culture with the next generation as Director and Instructor of the Newport Hellenic Dancers and the Greek School. He volunteered his time to the Greek festival, and was the beloved announcer for the dancers. His trademark whistle and exclamation of “Aren’t they wonderful!?” was a hit with crowds and dancers alike. Angelo loved to travel, walk along the beach, and watch action movies. He was an expert on the grill and always enjoyed sharing good wine and food with family and friends. When he heard his favorite songs, he was the first to get up to dance. When he was diagnosed with Lymphoma in 2012, he approached it like a scientist, working with the doctors to participate in many trials over the past seven years, and learning as much as possible about his disease. He was always willing to take the extra step to advance the research that might lead to a cure. Evangelos is survived by his wife Sandy (his two daughters Parthenia and Eleni, and his brother Nikolaos Giannopoulos, his wife Panayiota and their children Hristos and Athena. He also leaves his mother-in-law Eleni Giannoutsos, his sister-in-law Eve Giannoutsos and her husband Armando Vivacqua, and their son Salvatore Vasili, of Astoria, New York City. The funeral was at St. Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church in New London, CT. Memorial donations may be made to the St. Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church, 390 Thames St, Newport, RI 02840.

Prof. Kitroeff spoke to The National Herald about his latest book, The Greeks and the Making of Modern Egypt which was published this year by the American University in Cairo Press.\n\nTNH: What inspired you to write the book?\n\nProf. Alexander Kitroeff: My relationship with the Greeks in Egypt is both familial and academic. My great grandfather Alexandros Th. Kitroeff moved from the island of Chios to Alexandria in the late 19th century in order to becoming involved in the cotton business. He was a member of the Boards of the Greek Community in Alexandria and the “Mikrasiatikos Syllogos.” He enjoyed great prosperity until the Wall Street Crash of 1929. My grandfather and my grandmother were born in Alexandria, so was my father. They all moved to Greece in the 1950s and 1960s when life in Egypt became difficult for the Greeks. I was born in Athens and grew up listening to stories of life in Egypt, how easy and wonderful it had been.\n\nI have an equally intimate connection in academic terms because as a graduate student at Oxford University I chose to write my doctoral dissertation on the history Greeks in Egypt during the period between the two world wars. I spent several months doing research in Alexandria, where I lived with my grandmother’s sister who had stayed there along with a few thousand Greeks. While I was there, I made an emotional visit to the Greek cemetery and the graves of my great grandfather Alexandros and his wife Polyxeni, who was from the Aegean island of Amorgos.\n\nMy dissertation was published as a book in England in 1989, by that time I had moved to the United States so my research turned towards the Greek Americans. Three years ago, somewhat out of the blue, the American University in Cairo Press asked me if I would be interested in writing a book on the history of the Greek presence in Modern Egypt from its beginnings in the early nineteenth century through the 1960s when that presence diminished substantially. It was a wonderful opportunity to return to my family and academic roots!\n\nTNH: How long did the book take from idea to publication?\n\nAK: It took only three years from the invitation from the AUC Press to the publication, which must be some sort of record. But I had already written about a small period of the history of the Greeks in Egypt, several colleagues in the meantime had published important works on the Greeks or the other foreign communities in Egypt, and also I was able to take year’s leave from teaching at Haverford College and I spent it in Greece writing the book. I should add that both the AUC Press acquisitions editor Nadia Naqib and the manuscript editor Katie Holland also contributed to the whole process being efficient and fast.\n\nTNH: What was the most surprising thing you found in your research on the Greeks in Egypt?\n\nAK: I was pleasantly surprised by the intense feelings of love and nostalgia towards Egypt of almost all the Greeks who lived there, along with their strong attachments to Greece. The Greeks had a special relationship with the Egyptians, and they loved the country they had settled in, without losing any of their strong Greek identity thanks to the presence of strong community organizations, community-run schools, many ethnic associations and the Greek Orthodox patriarchate of Alexandria and its many churches. Typically, one Greek who was leaving Egypt for Greece in the late 1940s wrote that he did not know whether he was leaving or he was travelling to his country.\n\nTNH: What was the most challenging aspect of researching and writing the book?\n\nAK: The greatest challenge I faced was striking the right balance between two things. The first was acknowledging that at least through the end of the 1940s the Greeks, as had the other foreign communities, enjoyed a set of privileges – immunity from local laws and taxation – in Egypt that gave them an advantage over the local population. The second was that despite those privileges, the Greeks contributed significantly to Egypt’s economic and social modernization and they maintained close and respectful ties with the local population.\n\nFor example, the wealthy Greeks who were dominant in Egypt’s economic mainstay, the cultivation and export of cotton, including the Benachi, Salvago and Choremi families, obviously owed the wealth they amassed to the presence of the British in Egypt which lasted from 1882 to 1951, and the privileges they enjoyed. Nonetheless, they also invested in other sectors of the economy which the British were unconcerned about, and their success attracted other entrepreneurs, such as cigarette manufacturers who also developed other sectors of the Egyptian economy. And the growth of the cotton sector they led, contributed to the work of several Greek agriculturalists who developed higher and higher quality types of cotton, thus benefitting Egypt. In many cases those developments troubled the British authorities because the textile owners in northern England did not want to adjust their machinery to accommodate new types of cotton.\n\nMany Greeks from Egypt who look back on their stay in that country with nostalgia, believe that when scholars mention the privileges the Greeks enjoyed that somehow detracts from the enormous contributions the Greeks made. I have tried to show that the Greek experience in Egypt was characterized by both privileges and contributions.\n\nTNH: What are you working on next?\n\nAK: I have just completed a book manuscript on the history of the relationship between Greek Orthodoxy and Greek America. It explores the ways Greek Orthodoxy has shaped Greek American identity in the twentieth century. I relied a great deal on the excellent archives of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese in New York, the help of archivist Nikie Calles and many others including Fr. Robert Stephanopoulos and Fr. Alex Karloutsos. The book will be published in 2020 in the Orthodox Christianity Series of the Northern Illinois University Press which is an imprint of Cornell University Press.\n\nThe post Alexander Kitroeff Talks to TNH about the Greeks in Egypt appeared first on The National Herald."
