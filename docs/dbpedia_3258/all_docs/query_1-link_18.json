The periodicity can be explained as arising from the excitation of short-range propagating surface plasmon polaritons, and the observed periods are in good agreement with the model calculation results.

We found that it exhibits enhanced electrochemical values and 3.7 times larger hydrogen production efficiency in comparison to untreated Nickel sheets. In a second step, further electrodeposition of nickel particles was performed. The resulting electrodeposited-laser-nanostructured (ELN) electrode exhibited further increased hydrogen evolution reaction activity and further improved electrochemical characteristics. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a dendrite-like morphology for the ELN electrode surface. Thus, the enhanced activity has been attributed to the concomitant enlargement of the electrode’s electrocatalytic area. The ELN electrode was measured to produce almost 5 times more hydrogen gas than a flat Ni electrode. Three dimensional electrodes have been also prepared using Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Nickel foam has been used as the base material and Nickel layers have been successfully deposited with PLD. The laser-treated electrode exhibits enhanced electrochemical characteristics when compared to the untreated Ni foam. The above results demonstrate the application of lasers in the preparation of efficient Hydrogen-producing electrodes thus significantly contributing to the green energy transition and global environmental concerns.\n\nMoS2 structures modified by laser irradiation for semiconductor-SERS sensing\n\nPresenter: Luisa D'Urso (Università di Catania)\n\nAuthors: Luisa D'Urso (Università di Catania), Antonio Brancato (University of Catania), Marcello Condorelli (University of Catania), Vittorio Scardaci (University of Catania), Enza Fazio (University of Messina), Carmelo Corsaro (University of Messina), Giuseppe Compagnini (University of Catania)\n\nAbstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a typical 2D-material attracting in the last years great interest for photocatalysis, optoelectronic and sensing applications. In the field of the chemical sensing, semiconductor surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has attracted more and more attention due to the possibility to overcome some deficiencies of noble metal nanostructures. A key goal in the employ of semiconductors like 2D-MoS2 for SERS, is the improvement of the chemical mechanism (CM) of enhancement, mainly based on charge transfer phenomena. Recent progresses in the sensitivity were reported for defective MoS2 nanosheets and for complex architectures, like MoS2-nanoflowers [1, 2]. However, MoS2 layers can easily suffer from aggregation phenomena that negatively influence the CM of enhancement. In this respect, hierarchical MoS2-based nanostructures provide a hopeful approach to overcome the problem of the self- aggregation, as they are characterized by more stable structures with high chemical sensitivity. Here, MoS2 nanosheets were proper modified by laser beam irradiation in aqueous dispersion. This is an easy, green and contaminant-free approach able to induce significant structural modifications. Highly defective MoS2 layers and hierarchical architectures, like flower, tube and assembled lamellar structures, were obtained by a Nd:YAG nanosecond pulsed laser and were chemically characterised by XPS, UV and PL spectroscopies. The morphology of samples was assessed by scanning transmission electron and atomic force microscopy. SERS properties were studied using the 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) as a standard molecule. By using a Micro-Raman spectrometer, it was possible to find quickly isolated hierarchical structures and study the signal enhancement of the surface adsorbed analyte. Different chemical sensitivities were found as a function of the shape and composition and were attributed to different contributions: (a) the formation of a 1T MoS2 phase, (b) the high surface area of the produced structures and (c) the presence of laser-induced defects. The as-developed strategy may therefore open up interesting perspectives for designing semiconductor materials in the field of SERS sensing.\n\n3D Photonic Crystal for Rainbow Trapping Fabricated via Two-Photon Lithography\n\nPresenter: Eulàlia Puig Vilardell (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania)\n\nAuthors: Darius Gailevicius (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania), Eva Otero Picón (Physics Department, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Rambla Sant Nebridi 22, Terrassa, Spain), Bertran Soria Pastor (Physics Department, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Rambla Sant Nebridi 22, Terrassa, Spain), José Trull (Physics Department, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Rambla Sant Nebridi 22, Terrassa, Spain), Eulàlia Puig Vilardell (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania), Crina Cojocaru (Physics Department, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Rambla Sant Nebridi 22, Terrassa, Spain), Vygantas Mizeikis (Research Institute of Electronics, Shizuoka University, 3-5-1 Johoku, Naka-ku, Hamamatsu, Japan), Kestutis Staliūnas (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania), Mangirdas Malinauskas (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania)\n\nAbstract: The study of photonic crystals (PhC), first proposed in 1987, remains a field of high interest given the wide number of possibilities to control and manipulate the flow of light in different ways, and mostly, given the recent advances on technologies and techniques that allow to realize and test these materials experimentally [1]. One of these techniques is two-photon lithography, which is a well-established Laser Direct Writing technique (LDW) used over the last decades for manufacturing high precision 3D micro and nanostructures [2], and which appears as a suitable and high desirable technique for the fabrication of 3D PhC. The goal of this study has been to fabricate a 3D PhC able to slow down the light propagation in the visible and near infrared range, and spatially separate its frequency components, leading to the so-called “Rainbow trapping” effect [3], which results in an increase of light intensity chromatically resolved along the crystal, and thus can be used for application in which enhanced light-matter interaction is required.\n\nLaser bioprinting of 3D structures in organ on chip devices\n\nPresenter: Maria Anna Chliara (School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens, Iroon Polytechniou 9, 15780, Athens, Greece.)\n\nAuthors: Maria Anna Chliara (School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens, Iroon Polytechniou 9, 15780, Athens, Greece.), Maria Dimadi (PhosPrint P.C., Lefkippos Technology Park, NCSR Demokritos Patriarchou Grigoriou 5’ & Neapoleos 27, 15341 Athens, Greece), Katerina Tsilingiri (Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece), Marianneza Chatzipetrou (School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens, Iroon Polytechniou 9, 15780, Athens, Greece.), Apostolos Klinakis (Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece), Antonis Hatziapostolou (Department of Naval Architecture, School of Engineering, University of West Attica, 12243 Athens, Greece.), Ioanna Zergioti (School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, National Technical University of Athens, Iroon Polytechniou 9, 15780, Athens, Greece.)\n\nAbstract: In this work, we report the use of Laser Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) for the development of complex cell structures of tumor and LN cells in organ-on-chip devices, in order to study the metastatic behavior of cancer cells in lymphatic vessels. LIFT is employed as a 3D bioprinting technique, utilizing multilayer printing of 2D layers, rapidly immobilizing cells and extracellular matrices, for better imitation of the cancer tissue microenvironment. The design of the microfluidic chip includes culture chambers, as well as microchannels, so as to replicate blood and lymphatic flows. For chip fabrication, an LCD 3D printer is utilized in combination with a biocompatible, translucent resin.\n\nIndane-1,3-dione-based push-pull dyes as low fluorescent and highly efficient photoinitiators for free radical polymerization\n\nPresenter: Michalis Stavrou (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas)\n\nAuthors: Michalis Stavrou (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas), Dimitra Ladika (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas), Gordon Zyla (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas), Frederic Dumur (Aix Marseille University), MARIA FARSARI (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas), David Gray (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas)\n\nAbstract: Over the past two decades, Multi-Photon Lithography (MPL) has emerged as a highly effective manufacturing technique for crafting complicated three-dimensional (3D) microstructures with sub-microns resolved features.[1] MPL has played a pivotal role in advancing a diverse range of fields including micro-electronics,[2] micro-optics/photonics,[3] biomedicine,[4] microfluidics,[5] and plasmonic devices,[6] among others. In a typical MPL process, a photosensitive material, composed of reactive oligomers and a photoinitiator (PI), is exposed to high-intensity radiation by a tightly focused fs laser pulsed beam. Due to the high laser intensities, the nonlinear optical process of multi-photon absorption is manifested. Consequently, the PI absorbs simultaneously two or more photons through virtual intermediate states, leading to its decomposition into radicals. These radicals induce a cross-linking reaction of the oligomers. Unlike single-photon absorption, multi-photon processes enable the localization of photochemically induced polymerization to the focal point of incident laser beam, resulting in the precise printing of structures with feature sizes below the diffraction limit of light. The effectiveness of the PI is widely recognized to significantly influence various critical aspects of the printing process, such as the resolution and fabrication time of the 3D microstructures. So far, different synthetic approaches have been proposed to tune the efficiency of PIs, which is generally expressed by their two-photon absorption cross section σ. These approaches involve manipulating different structural parameters of PIs, as for instance, the size, the planarity, the aromatic properties of the monomeric units (e.g., through selective doping of the carbon framework with heteroatoms) and the kind of the peripheral functionalization (e.g., by incorporating electron donating and/or accepting substituents). From the aforementioned strategies, the most successful motif for molecules orientated towards MPL consists of electron donating and accepting functionalities, bridged by a π-conjugated spacer. In that view, significant efforts have been dedicated to synthesize compounds acting as strong electron donors/acceptors to enhance the performance of MPL. The present work assesses the efficiency of newly synthesized indane-1,3-dione-based push-pull dyes as PIs, comparing the findings with previously studied triphenylamine-based aldehydes and standard PIs for MPL applications. The present PIs exhibit strong nonlinear optical properties (i.e., two-photon absorption cross section and second-order hyperpolarizability) resulting in 3D structures with low fabrication threshold and high resolution. Most importantly, the fabricated structures display low fluorescence quantum yield. These findings render them highly promise for advancing applications in photonics, optoelectronics, medicine, and other innovative fields.\n\nOxidation of metals during topographic functionalization upon ultrafast laser irradiation\n\nPresenter: Jean-Philippe COLOMBIER (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien)\n\nAuthors: Florence GARRELIE (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien ), Priya DOMINIC (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien), Mathilde PRUDENT (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien), Djafar IABBADEN (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien), Alejandro BORROTO (Université de Lorraine, IJL), Arnaud WECK (University Ottawa), Jean‑François PIERSON (Université de Lorraine, IJL), Florent BOURQUARD (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien), Jean-Philippe COLOMBIER (Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, Laboratoire Hubert Curien)\n\nAbstract: Ultrafast laser-induced surface texturing became a well-recognized technique of surface functionalization, with comparatively little work focused on the accompanying chemical changes. This paper reports a detailed investigation of the oxidation mechanisms induced on metals in the form of pure metal and metallic glass. Ultrafast laser irradiation was performed in ambient and high vacuum conditions on tungsten to generate so-called High Spatial Frequency Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (HSFL) with a sub- 100 nm period and sub-20 nm amplitude, as they are supposed to arise in a non-ablative regime. Scanning Transmission electron microscopy cross-sectional images, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal significant structural differences between the laser-generated oxides and the oxides accumulated over time from ambient exposure [1]. The oxidation mechanism during ultrafast laser interaction was examined with the help of Two Temperature Model and Molecular Dynamics simulations (TTM-MD) complemented by oxygen diffusion data, providing a predictive insight into the development of a thin oxide layer induced by the laser, a conclusion substantiated by the STEM images. This study is complemented by a detailed analysis of ultrafast laser irradiation of metallic glasses under conditions of generation in a one-step laser process of dense nanowell arrays with dimensions down to 20 nm spontaneously formed in the ultrafast laser irradiation spot [2]. In addition to the topographic functionalization, the laser-irradiated amorphous material exhibits structural changes analyzed by spectroscopic techniques at the nanoscale such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Results reveal structural changes consisting of nanocrystals of monoclinic zirconia that grow within the amorphous ZrCu matrix. The mechanism is highlighted by an atomistic simulation of the laser-induced nanowell formation.\n\nTHz beam profile shaping through linear and nonlinear superposition of two-color laser filaments\n\nPresenter: Ioannis Liontos (FORTH-IESL)\n\nAuthors: Anastasios Koulouklidis (FORTH-IESL), Ioannis Liontos (FORTH-IESL), Dimitra Pappa (Physics Department, University of Crete), Panagiotis Konstantakis (FORTH-IESL), Stelios Tzortzakis (FORTH-IESL)\n\nAbstract: We propose a novel approach to control the shape of a broadband THz beam and the energy redistribution within the beam profile by direct manipulation of the THz emitter.\n\nLocal Versus Global: Rethinking Incubation in Ultra-Short Pulse Laser Ablation\n\nPresenter: David Redka (Munich University of Applied Sciences HM)\n\nAuthors: David Redka (Munich University of Applied Sciences HM), Nicolas Thomae (Munich University of Applied Sciences HM), Maximilian Spellauge (Munich University of Applied Sciences HM), Ján Minár (New Technologies Research Center, University of West Bohemia), Heinz Huber (Munich University of Applied Sciences HM)\n\nAbstract: The study reevaluates the phenomenon of incubation in ultra-short pulse laser ablation, challenging the traditional understanding that primarily associates incubation with global material alterations. By focusing on the local field effects, particularly at crater edges, the research uncovers a more complex picture of incubation, where local enhancements play a significant role. Through a series of experiments and simulations on aluminum and stainless steel AISI 304, the research demonstrates that local field enhancements can lead to selective ablation and the formation of Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures, indicating a departure from uniform incubation processes. These findings suggest a need to consider both local and global effects to fully understand the dynamics of ultra-short pulse laser ablation, particularly for applications in precision material processing.\n\nLIPSS formation on transparent material by laser-induced plasma-assisted ablation (LIPAA) and its fundamental characteristics\n\nPresenter: Yasutaka Hanada (Hirosaki University)\n\nAuthors: Koji Sugioka (RIKEN), Kotaro Obata (RIKEN), Koshi Kudo (Hirosaki University), Muma Miura (Hirosaki University), Sohei Yamada (Hirosaki University), Yasutaka Hanada (Hirosaki University)\n\nAbstract: The laser-induced plasma-assisted ablation (LIPAA) achieves high-quality surface microfabrication of transparent materials [1]. In the LIPAA process, strong interactions between laser light and plasma results in ablation and selective metallization on the rear side of the transparent substrate in micrometer scale. We focused on the metal thin films deposited on the transparent substrate during LIPAA process and explored the possibility of transferring the laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on the substrate. In this presentation, we investigated the fabrication characteristics of LIPSS on a glass by the LIPAA process using a nanosecond laser.\n\nSecond Harmonic Nonlinear Microscopy as a diagnostic tool for fs-laser fabrication of photonic structures\n\nPresenter: Ignacio Lopez-Quintas (University of Salamanca)\n\nAuthors: Nuria Sevilla-Sierra (University of Salamanca), Carolina Romero (University of Salamanca), Javier R. Vázquez de Aldana (University of Salamanca), Xavier Mateos (University Rovira i Virgili), Ignacio Lopez-Quintas (University of Salamanca)\n\nAbstract: In this study, we explore the application of Second Harmonic Nonlinear Microscopy for characterizing various photonic structures inscribed with fs-laser pulses in different crystals, either with non-centrosymmetric structure leading to a high nonlinear response or with centrosymmetric structure, where second harmonic generation is not expected in bulk but is generated in the laser-damaged regions. The obtained results reveal Second Harmonic Nonlinear Microscopy as a suitable diagnostic technique to inspect the morphology of the fabricated photonic structures even in centrosymmetric samples, also serving to elucidate the nature of the changes induced in the material at the microscopic scale upon laser irradiation through their nonlinear response.\n\nStudy on the degradation of high reflection film performance induced by stray light irradiation of CFRP in high-power continuous laser facilities\n\nPresenter: Yuhai Li (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics)\n\nAuthors: Yuhai Li (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Tianran Zheng (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Jia Li (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Hongjie Liu (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Laixi Sun (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Fang Wang (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Junwei Zhang (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Xiaodong Yuan (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics), Qingshun Bai (School of Mechatronics Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology), Peng Zhang (School of Mechatronics Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology), Fei Wang (School of Mechatronics Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology), Qiang Yuan (Research Center of Laser Fusion, China Academy of Engineering Physics)\n\nAbstract: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) is widely used in aerial platform confinement of high-power continuous laser facilities due to its lightweight and high stiffness. In the high-power laser system, abundant random stray light is inevitably generated due to the surface scattering and the residual reflection, which may cause damage to the high-reflection film optical components. Thus, to realize the clean environment control in a high-power continuous laser system from the root, the degradation of high reflection film performance induced by contaminants induced by stray light irradiation of CFRP materials was studied. The damage threshold of a typical resin-based carbon fiber composite was investigated under continuous laser irradiation (λ=1064 nm). The results showed that the surface temperature rise effect of CFRP increased significantly with the increase of laser spot size at the same power, and the laser-induced damage threshold of CFRP decreased significantly. When the laser spot diameter is 8.4 mm, the damage threshold of CFRP after 30 s continuous laser irradiation is 14.07 W/cm2. The stray light energy in high energy continuous laser system is generally less than one thousandth of the main laser energy (kilowatt level). The stray light energy (1.44 W/cm2) far below the damage threshold of CFRP was adopted for irradiation experiment. After the highly reflective film optical components and CFRP were placed in the same sealed chamber for a week, the surface temperature rise effect was significantly increased under 3 kW laser irradiation. About 2°C can increase the maximum temperature, and the film layer ablative defects were accompanied, which was unacceptable for continuous laser systems with tens of millions of energies or higher. Thus, it is necessary to seriously consider the influence of stray light irradiation CFRP on the high reflection film optical component contamination damage in high-power continuous laser facilities.\n\nFs-laser scalpel for high-precision damage-free bone ablation\n\nPresenter: Laura Gemini (ALPhANOV)\n\nAuthors: Laura Gemini (ALPhANOV)\n\nAbstract: Femtosecond lasers have shown outstanding results in treating biological tissues thanks to their capability of minimizing thermal loads during the laser-matter interaction, allowing for high-precision and high-quality ablation in applications where highly localized intervention are needed. This specific property is of extreme importance when considering the interaction of light with biological tissues because the death of such tissues is a direct consequence of the tissue temperature increase and strongly prevents the tissue regeneration and the overall after-surgery recovery. In the frame of bone tissue removal in surgical operations such as craniomaxillofacial surgeries, it is favorable to reach high-precision ablation within the shortest ablation time, while keeping the surrounding tissue the healthiest in order to favor its regeneration. In this work, a comprehensive parametric study is presented in order to optimize the bone tissue ablation rate while maintaining the tissue health by avoiding excessive thermal loads. Different absorption regimes are investigated by employing fs laser sources at 3000 nm, 1030 nm, 515 nm and 343 nm in order to tailor absorption from the different tissue’s components, such as water, hydroxyapatite and its organic matrix (hemoglobin, proteins…), as shown in Figure 1a. The main differences in the different absorption regimes are discussed by comparing the evolution of the ablation rate and the calcination degree of the laser ablated tissue. The role of a cooling environment during laser ablation of the tissue is discussed. Results are being exploited currently to build the first Proof of Concept of a fs-laser robotic system for craniomaxillofacial surgeries.\n\nInfluence of MHz bursts on the ablation efficiency of thin metal foils\n\nPresenter: Rida Ahmed (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia )\n\nAuthors: Rida Ahmed (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia ), Peter Gregorcic (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia )\n\nAbstract: Ultra-short pulse laser bursts have attracted a lot of attention in industrial micromachining due to their advantages over conventional laser modes, especially their high ablation efficiency. In burst mode, a packet of multiple pulses with the same total energy replaces the single pulse with the energy Ep. The main feature is the intra-burst repetition rate within the burst, which is higher than the (inter-) pulse repetition rate of conventional single pulses. Burst-mode lasers usually operate at different repetition rates, either in the MHz or GHz range, with intra-pulse delays in the nanosecond or picosecond range, respectively. The high intra-pulse repetition rates lead to strong heat accumulation, which in turn promotes ablation efficiency. This high ablation efficiency, which cannot be achieved in conventional single-pulse mode, offers considerable advantages in material processing. Since Kerse et. al [1] introduced ablative cooling, many research groups have investigated the use of GHz bursting in metal processing [3-4]. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the less expensive and more accessible MHz burst mode. This motivates us to investigate the ablation efficiency of the MHz burst mode for industrial applications. In this contribution, we investigate the possibility of using MHz burst lasers (wavelength 1030 and 343 nm, intra-burst repetition rate 40 MHz, and inter-pulse repetition rate 333 kHz) to achieve similar advantages to GHz burst lasers in the processing of metal foils. Our experimental focus is on measuring ablation efficiency as the material removed per fluence (∆d/F = h/ft/F), calculated from the foil thickness (h), repetition rate (f), and time to drill through (t). The peak fluence is F = 2Ep/(w0), where Ep is the pulse energy and w0 is the beam waist radius. We investigated the ablation efficiency of the MHz burst mode by varying the parameters including the laser wavelength (1030 nm or 343 nm), the material of the foils (SS, Al, Ti, and Cu) with different thicknesses (25µm, 50µm, and 75µm), the pulse durations (300fs - 10ps) and the number of pulses in the bursts (1-43). In addition, the results obtained are compared with those obtained with ns pulses at pulse durations corresponding to the total burst durations. Our results show the potential of MHz bursts as a viable and cost-effective alternative to GHz bursts for wider use in industrial applications such as laser drilling and micromachining.\n\nInvestigating the Impact of Ultraviolet Laser Parameters on the Surface Characteristics of Silicon Carbide (SiC) Substrates\n\nPresenter: Yu-Hsuan Lin (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories)\n\nAuthors: Hsin-Yi Tsai (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Chih-Ning Hsu (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Yu-Hsuan Lin (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Kuo-Cheng Huang (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Ching-Ching Yang (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), J. Andrew Yeh (Department of Power Mechanical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University)\n\nAbstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a third-generation semiconductor material and known for its high-temperature resistance and wide bandgap characteristics. However, the poses challenges of SiC process was the inherent hardness, and it makes traditional grinding and polishing time-consuming and resource-intensive, then significantly elevating wafer production costs. Laser systems can be applied for material marking, drilling, cutting, and surface modification. In previous studies, several research presented that the femtosecond [1-2] and nanosecond [3] laser system was employed to ablate and polish the SiC surface, wherein the influence on surface roughness, ablation depth and oxidation of SiC have been computed. Therein, the laser parameters such as pulse energy, spot overlapping and defocus of laser spot were investigated. Furthermore, some studies discuss effect of the laser ablation and polishing for the following chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) [4-5] process. It is noteworthy that the majority of these studies employed femtosecond laser systems, but the system price of femtosecond laser was too high to be widely applied in the SiC manufacturing facilities. Therefore, the suitable laser treatment mechanism on SiC substrates was investigated in this manuscript, and the parameters such as the scanning speed, pulse repetition frequency, laser path and repetition times of laser system can be adjusted to find the suitable values for soften the hardness of SiC substrates. In this study, the ultraviolet laser system was employed to modify the characteristics of SiC surface. We investigated the effects of different processing path, speeds, frequencies, and power levels on modification depth, oxidation, and hardness changes in the SiC surface. By inducing the surface softening, the goal is to enhance the efficiency of subsequent CMP process. Preliminary test results indicated that laser treatment of SiC surfaces leads to the formation of oxides, causing the surface hardness to reduce to approximately 30% of the original value. This reduction facilitates subsequent CMP processes, accelerating material removal rates and minimizing tool wear. The development presented in this research has the potential to increase SiC wafer productivity and reduce production costs.\n\nFemtosecond UV laser enhancement of silver nanowires based transparent conductive electrodes\n\nPresenter: Denys Miakota (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark)\n\nAuthors: Denys Miakota (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Asbjørn Moltke (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Callum Smith (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Camilla Jektvik (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Ole Bang (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Stela Canulescu (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark)\n\nAbstract: Here, we present our findings on Ag nanowires plasmonic welding using a femtosecond supercontinuum pulsed laser with selected wavelength varied between UV-B and visible spectral range. As a result, this treatment increases nanowires contact area, reducing sheet resistance of the nanowires grid, while maintaining its high transmittance. Here, we will demonstrate TCEs based on optically welded silver nanowires, which exhibit both high transmittance of T > 85% and low sheet resistance Rs < 20 Ω/sq. Using conventional ITO and Al:ZnO (AZO) TCEs as our benchmarks, we will compare their electrical and transmittance performance to optically-welded Ag nanowires grid, and ZnO/AgNWs/ZnO hybrid electrodes\n\nFormation of ultra-low dielectric constant film by non-thermal laser deposition\n\nPresenter: Takuma Hamachi (Kyushu University)\n\nAuthors: Takuma Hamachi (Kyushu University), Keita Katayama (Kyushu University), Daisuke Nakamura (Kyushu University), Hiroshi Ikenoue (Kochi University of Technology)\n\nAbstract: We focused on pulsed laser deposition (PLD) as a new low-k film formation process, in which nanoparticles can be deposited to form nanoporous films. Theoretical calculations suggest that the smaller the nanoparticle size, the lower the dielectric constant owing to the quantum confinement effect. Therefore,we believe that ultra-low dielectric constant films can be formed by depositing smaller nanoparticles. We deposited nanoparticles by PLD using three combinations of lasers and materials and investigated the size of the deposited nanoparticles.The combinations are (a) F2 laser and SiO2, (b) ArF excimer laser and SiO2, and (c) ArF excimer laser.The ablation process in each combination was categorized as thermal or non-thermal ablation, and it was found that smaller particles were deposited in the non-thermal ablation combination.We calculated the Gibbs free energy of the nanoparticles and determined the critical particle size that separates the growth and decay of the particles in the thermal equilibrium process.The results showed that in the case of non-thermal ablation, the deposited particles were smaller than the critical particle size.\n\nInsight into pulsed laser deposition of selected oxynitride system. Oxidation control via plasma diagnostic tools\n\nPresenter: Stefan Irimiciuc (Physics Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences)\n\nAuthors: Stefan Irimiciuc (Physics Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences), Sergii Chertopalov (Physics Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences), Martin Vondracek (Physics Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences), Jan Lancok (Physics Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences), Valentin Craciun (National Institute for Laser, Plasma and Radiation Physics )\n\nAbstract: In recent years, there has been a significant surge in advancements in thin film technology aimed at fostering clean and renewable energy sources. However, a critical challenge that persists is the upscaling of manufacturing processes, thus a paradigm shift in the industrialization of certain technologies occurred focused on the automation of the process. Among the myriad of technological solutions, Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) stands out as an exceptionally versatile tool for producing a wide range of nanoscale materials with precisely controllable properties. Our research group has demonstrated in recent years that in-situ monitoring of the PLD process is crucial for establishing correlations between plasma behaviour and thin film characteristics, thus paving the way for process automation. In this study, we apply this approach to gain insights into the formation of oxynitride films. Beginning with a bottom-up approach, we characterize the deposition process of selected oxides and oxynitrides (such as TiOxNy, ZrOxNy, and HfOxNy) with the objective of elucidating plasma-thin film relationships to facilitate the upscaling of PLD technology. Our investigations employed angle and time-resolved Langmuir probe techniques coupled with real-time optical emission spectroscopy to scrutinize the deposition process. We identified distinct signatures in the charge particle density distribution for gas-phase oxidation processes involving metallic species. Time-resolved analysis unveiled the intricate dynamics of a two-temperature plasma with distinctive angular structuring. To account for the peculiarities of PLD, both on-axis and off-axis deposition geometries were employed to examine the influence of charge kinetic energy on defect and oxynitride phase formation. Subsequently, the deposited films underwent comprehensive characterization using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and electrical measurements. Finally, we established correlations between plasma properties during deposition and selected physical properties of the film, thereby identifying optimal conditions for the development of tailored oxynitride coatings\n\nLaser-Induced Crystallization: Enhanced predictability of urea crystallization by optimized laser repetition rate\n\nPresenter: Leon Geiger (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany)\n\nAuthors: Leon Geiger (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany), Ian Howard (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany), Neil MacKinnon (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany), Andrew Forbes (School of Physics, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa), Jan Korvink (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany)\n\nAbstract: Laser-induced crystallization is a novel alternative to classical methods for crystallizing organic molecules but requires judicious choice of experimental parameters for the onset of crystallization to be predictable. This study investigated the impact of the laser repetition rate on the time delay from the start of the pulsed laser illumination to the initiation of crystallization, the so-called induction time. A supersaturated urea solution was irradiated with near-infrared laser pulses with an intensity of 1E14 W/cm2 while varying the repetition rate from 10 to 20 000 Hz. The optimal rate discovered ranged from 500 Hz to 1 kHz, quantified by the measured induction time (median 2-5 seconds) and the mean probability of inducing a successful crystallization event (5E−2 %). For higher repetition rates (5 kHz to 20 kHz), the mean probability dropped to 3E−3 %. The reduced efficiency at high repetition rates is likely due to an interaction between an existing thermocavitation bubble and subsequent pulses. These results suggest that an optimized pulse repetition rate can be a means to gain further control over the laser-induced crystallization process.\n\nExploring nonlinear optical effects in NV-doped diamond\n\nPresenter: Krzysztof Dzierzega (Jagiellonian University)\n\nAuthors: Krzysztof Dzierzega (Jagiellonian University), Wojciech Talik (Jagiellonian University), Adam Wojciechowski (Jagiellonian University), Mariusz Mrózek (Jagiellonian University)\n\nAbstract: The optical properties of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in biology, medicine, quantum sensing and quantum information processing. In most cases, visible to near-infrared luminescence is recorded, upon the green laser excitation, and carries information on the NV spin which, in turn, may be manipulated using microwave fields. Although there is some research on nonlinear optical effects in bulk diamond and nanodiamonds, the impact of NV centers on such phenomena is far from being fully understood. Here, we investigate the influence of NV centers in high-quality crystalline diamonds (DNV-B1, B14, and electronic grade; Element Six / Thorlabs) on nonlinear optical effects using 230-fs-long laser pulses with a wavelength of 1030 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz. In particular, the optical Kerr effect (OKE) and multi-photon absorption were explored using the Z-scan technique. Our findings reveal that diamonds with NV centers generally exhibit a lower non-linear refractive index compared to pure diamond. However, unlike pure diamond, the NV-diamonds exhibit very strong nonlinear absorption effects, attributed to its bandgap energy level structure. As the energy of the laser pulse increases, we observe two-photon absorption (TPA) initially, followed by saturated absorption (SA), and finally reversed saturated absorption (RSA). These effects are also strongly enhanced with increasing NV concentration. To identify the underlying processes, fluorescence (FL) spectra excited by laser pulses of various energies were examined. These spectra consist of a zero-phonon line (ZPL) of NV0 observed at 575 nm and a broad band centered around 640 nm, which are associated with electron transitions between excited and ground states of NV0. The lack of NV- ZPL at 637 nm, a prominent feature under green light illumination, indicates the conversion of NV- to NV0 caused by multiphoton ionization. The spectrally integrated FL follows a quadratic dependence on laser pulse energy indicating the involvement of two-photon processes in the excitation of the FL spectra. In summary, our studies unveil intriguing optical nonlinearity in diamonds with NV concentrations of a few ppm, which holds significant interest for researchers in the field of quantum sensing. Figure: (from left to right) Bandgap energy level structure of NV-doped diamond.

The anisotropy consists in an oscillation of the induced carrier density with crystal orientation. Electron densities as low as 〖10〗^13 〖cm〗^(-3) are detected, due to the high coupling of THz electric field with free carriers. The anisotropy of TPA and its dynamics are analyzed in samples with smooth surfaces first and then with surfaces pre-structured with LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures). We show that pre-structuring the crystal surfaces clearly influences the intrinsic TPA-induced anisotropy.\n\nClassification of Soybean Paste Using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy and k-Nearest Neighbors Analysis\n\nPresenter: Sang-Ho Nam (Mokpo National University)\n\nAuthors: Sang-Ho Nam (Mokpo National University)\n\nAbstract: Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is one of the simple elemental analysis method using laser-ablation sampling [1]. In typical LIBS analysis, the sample preparation can be simply done without acid digestion and dilution process and thus allows a rapid analysis of multiple elements. In this study, we conducted elemental discrimination of soybean paste according to its geographical origin using LIBS. Soybean paste is a seasoning widely used in East Asian countries. It is characterized by its high protein and amino acid content, excellent storage stability, and distinctive flavor and aroma, making it widely favored in culinary practices. In South Korea, numerous food companies distribute soybean paste products, with a significant portion being produced in China. Distinguishing the origin of soybean paste is crucial for food distribution management. A total of 167 soybean paste samples were used in this study, with 101 being domestically produced and 66 from China. LIBS equipment measurements revealed the presence of elements such as C, Mg, Na, K, H, Ca, Cl, and P in soybean paste samples. The discrimination capabilities of the emission lines of these elements were investigated by using the concept of interclass distance. To evaluate the interclass distance, the difference between average of specific emission intensities measured for Chinese and Korean soybean paste samples was taken first and scaled by the common pooled standard deviation. The emission lines of Mg, P, and C showed relatively larger interclass distances (> 0.5). Thus, the three emission line intensities were considered in the k-NN modeling. Also, the classification performances of three 1-variable, three 2-variable, and one 3-variable models were evaluated following the leave-one-out validation process. Among the possible combinations of variables, the usage of both Mg and C emission intensities provided the best model. The highest classification accuracy (86.2%) was achieved by the Mg-C model at k = 13. Our research suggests that the classification methodology combining LIBS and k-NN can be an effective and practical choice for screening particular soybean paste products.\n\nUltraviolet Laser-Assisted Micropattern Fabrication and its Impact on Viral Activity Inhibition under Electrical Stimulation\n\nPresenter: Yu-Hsuan Lin (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories)\n\nAuthors: Hsin-Yi Tsai (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Liang-Chieh Chao (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Cheng-Ru Li (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Yu-Hsuan Lin (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), Kuo-Cheng Huang (Taiwan Instrument Research Institute, National Applied Research Laboratories), J. Andrew Yeh (Department of Power Mechanical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University )\n\nAbstract: Viruses and bacteria spread rapidly through saliva or droplets, and their prolonged viability poses a serious threat to human health, especially during the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, the inhibition of virus or bacteria activity play an important role in surface treatment technology. Traditionally, virus inhibition involves chemical substance spraying or physical methods such as heat or ultraviolet light, all of which potentially harm the respiratory system, eyes, or skin oh human body. The other virus inhibition method was also presented such as electrical stimulation [1], acoustics, plasma, and microwaves. In addition, the metal surface such as cooper surface can destroy the ester and protein surrounding virus [2]. Thus, we used the copper surface and given a variable-frequency electrical stimulation for the virus and bacterial [3]. The results showed that the activity of coronavirus 229E can be significantly inhibited under direct-current pulse stimulation with 25 mA current and specific frequency. The laser system can directly fabricate the electrode and pattern on flexible materials, and it had excellent opto-electrical properties [4]. The previous research [5] presented that the electrical field emission properties can be enhanced by surface structing of copper film fabricated by laser system. Therefore, we integrate the micropattern induced by laser system and electrical stimulation on conductive materials to investigate the inhibition effect of viral activity. Micropatterns are created on conductive films using by ultraviolet laser system, which can enhance the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in inhibiting of virus activity. The conductive films include copper film that originally had good viral inhibition effect and ITO film that have excellent optical transparent effect. In addition, the micropattern with circle and rectangle shapes, and different dimension and spacing ranged from 50 to 200 μm were designed. By utilizing variable-frequency electrical stimulation, we explore the inhibition rates of 229E coronavirus under different dimensions, spacings, and shapes of micropatterns, aiming to achieve an inhibition rate of over 90%. Through the fabrication of micropatterns on the surface of conductive substrates, the sharp electric field effect can be enhanced and even reducing the time and power consumption required for electrical stimulation in viral activity inhibition. This advancement significantly broadens the application scope, efficiently reducing virus activity and providing substantial assistance to public health.\n\nThe use of femtosecond UV laser for selective layer processing of CIGS thin-film solar cells\n\nPresenter: Denys Miakota (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark)\n\nAuthors: Denys Miakota (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Asbjørn Moltke (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Callum Smith (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Ole Bang (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark), Andreas Zimmerman (Sunplugged GmbH), Stela Canulescu (Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark)\n\nAbstract: Here, we will present our findings on high-precision CIGS solar cell processing P1, P2, and P3 using femtosecond (<100 fs) supercontinuum pulsed laser with a tunable UV wavelength. Femtosecond pulses enable highly localized heating due to a time scale shorter than the electron–phonon equilibrium time. This may offer a low heat-affected zone and prevent undesirable melting of CIGS, which causes phase transition and creates conductive channels [3], which cause shortcuts and reduce overall PV module performance. By using femtosecond laser operating at UV wavelength above the bandgap of Al:ZnO we can enable highly controlled P3 scribing due to strong absorption in all the layers. The dependence of ablation depth on laser fluence and overlap ratio will be experimentally studied, with discussions on the corresponding ablation mechanisms.\n\nTreatment of Gingival Melanin Pigmentation by CO2 and Nd:YAG laser ablation\n\nPresenter: Carla Raquel Fontana (UNESP)\n\nAuthors: Carla Raquel Fontana (UNESP), Vanderlei Salvador Bagnato (USP)\n\nAbstract: Melanin is an endogenous granular pigment that can present colors ranging from yellow to black and is produced by melanocytes present in the basal layer of the oral epithelium. Changes or disorders related to melanin and other pigments can be initiated by trauma, infection, habits (smoking, food), use of medications (antimalarials, minocyclines) and by some systemic factors such as Addison's disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and tumors. Physiological gingival melanin pigmentation (GMP), also called racial melanosis, is a non-pathological condition with variable prevalence in different ethnic groups. There are only a few reports in the literature [1] comparing the effects of lasers on GMP. This study was performed to compare and evaluate the effects of the Nd:YAG laser, CO2 laser at superpulse mode, and conventional surgery with Kirland scalpel applied for gingival depigmentation. Recently, several surgical techniques for gingival depigmentation have been proposed with the aim of removing physiological pigmented lesions from the gingival tissue. However, the decision and indication for its removal must be based mainly on a correct diagnosis of physiological pigmentation, determining differential diagnoses with other changes that can also manifest pigmented lesions in the oral cavity. After confirming the diagnosis of racial melanosis, the objective of this work was to present a clinical case in which we used different ablative forms of treatment using CO2 and Nd YAG lasers in the same patient. The removal of pigmented lesions in the oral mucosa was divided as follows: Upper right quadrant: CO 2 laser, upper left quadrant: Kirkland scalpel (conventional technique), lower region of the oral epithelium: Nd YAG. This division aimed to compare the results of the conventional surgical technique with ablative techniques. Ablation of the hyperpigmented gingiva with CO2 and ND:YAG laser was accomplished with minimal carbonization and almost no bleeding. Postoperative healing was uneventful, with no significant postoperative pain. Partial repigmentation was observed only in non-ablated areas, so additional treatment was performed in these regions regardless of the laser used. In conclusion, we have that the application of the superpulse mode of the CO2 laser or the Nd:YAG laser appears to be an effective and safe method for eliminating (GMP,) as it causes less bleeding, consequently less edema and less postoperative pain when compared to the conventional surgical method\n\nTime resolved mid-infrared absorption in silica: ultrafast heat transfer observed by direct probing of anharmonic vibrations\n\nPresenter: Vincenzo De Michele (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet))\n\nAuthors: Vincenzo De Michele (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet)), Arshak Tsaturyan (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet)), Jose Andrade (Max Born Institute), Elena Kachan (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet)), Ciro D'Amico (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet)), Jean-Philippe COLOMBIER (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet)), Alexandre Mermillod-Blondin (Max Born Institute), Razvan Stoian (Laboratoire Hubert Curien (Université Jean Monnet))\n\nAbstract: The ongoing progress in ultrafast laser technology has given a great impetus to material processing, enabling the realization of new photonic devices, with functionalities intimately related to the structuring scale. Here we propose an innovative approach based on the real-time probing of the activation of vibrational phonons as direct proof of molecular dynamics: monitoring the matrix evolution through the dynamics of anharmonic vibrational modes upon nonlinear excitation. The experimental investigations were conducted on amorphous silica, tracking the Si-O-Si antisymmetric stretching overtone located at 4415 nm. Upon nonlinear excitation, the rapid evolution of the molecular potential and the phonon population will be reflected in the absorption of the vibrational feature in the mid-infrared (MIR), such as inhomogeneous broadening and spectral shift. Our results emphasize the potential of this method, which can be easily extended to other local markers of vibrational coupling within the host glass structure.\n\nSelective laser assisted chemical etching of aluminum nitride\n\nPresenter: Tatsunori Shibuya (AIST)\n\nAuthors: Tatsunori Shibuya (AIST), Daisuke Satoh (AIST), Hiroshi Ogawa (AIST), Masahito Tanaka (AIST), Ryunosuke Kuroda (AIST)\n\nAbstract: Single crystal of aluminum nitride (AlN) has a high thermal conductivity and is an electrical insulator, and is great candidate material for UV-LED, UV-LD, power convertor, RF-HEMT and so on. In this research, we suggest the selective laser assisted chemical etching of aluminum nitride for high resolution material processing. The result is indicated that the processing from c-axis side is appeared a hexagonal shape and the sharpness is high. Also, as a parameter of laser output power and scanning speed, it is possible to control the size of the hexagonal shape.\n\nThe Size and Composition-dependent Mechanisms of High-Entropy-Alloy Nanoparticle Formation by Laser Ablation in Liquids\n\nPresenter: Christoph Rehbock (Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany)\n\nAuthors: Christoph Rehbock (Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany), Robert Stuckert (Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany), Felix Pohl (Institute for Material Science, Faculty of Engineering, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kaiserstraße 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany), Ulrich Schürmann (Institute for Material Science, Faculty of Engineering, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kaiserstraße 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany), Lorenz Kienle (Institute for Material Science, Faculty of Engineering, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Kaiserstraße 2, 24143 Kiel, Germany), Stephan Barcikowski (Technical Chemistry I and Center for Nanointegration Duisburg-Essen (CENIDE), University of Duisburg-Essen, Universitaetsstr. 7, 45141 Essen, Germany)\n\nAbstract: The mechanism of colloidal alloy nanoparticle (NP) formation by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) has been intensively studied e.g. for fully miscible alloy systems like AgAu forming solid solution[1], partially miscible systems like FeAu with trends for segregation and core-shell structure formation[2], and immiscible elements (CuAg), where segregation was observable even in the ablation plume during early stage formation[3]. Recently, this approach has been successfully transferred to multi-component high entropy alloy (HEA) systems, where crystalline solid solution NPs of CrMnFeCoNi were generated by ps-LAL in ethanol[4] and amorphous structures were found after ns-LAL in acetonitrile[5]. However, to what extent the composition and crystal structure of laser-synthesized HEA-NP is affected by target composition, pulse duration, and the solvent is underexplored. In this work, we investigate how crystal structures, particle diameter distribution, and elemental composition of CrMnFeCoNi and CuPdAgPtAu HEA NPs are affected by laser pulse duration (ps vs. ns) and solvent type (ethanol, acetone), and in particular whether and to what extent the excess of one element in the HEA base target leads to elemental segregation in the HEA-NPs. Particle characterization was conducted by TEM/EDX as well as XRD. Preliminary studies showed a high phase stability of the solid solution fcc structure of the HEA-NPs at the excess of specifically chosen elements (Cr, Mn, Ag, Cu, Pt) though individual NPs, particularly in the Mn-rich CrMnFeCoNi samples, displayed segregation due to oxide phase formation. Interestingly, CuPdAgPtAu HEA-NPs displayed two solid solution NP fractions divided into Ag-rich and Pt-rich individual particles of comparable particle diameters. These de-mixing tendencies could be a hint towards particles formed at different cooling rates and could offer interesting insights into the HEA-NP formation mechanism by LAL under thermodynamic and kinetic control.\n\nFemtosecond direct laser writing for fabricating structures with NV centers\n\nPresenter: Cleber Mendonca (IFSC/USP)\n\nAuthors: Cleber Mendonca (IFSC/USP), Lucas Nolasco (IFSC/USP), Filipe Couto (IFSC/USP), Lucas Andrade (IFSC/USP), Sergio Muniz (IFSC/USP)\n\nAbstract: This study investigates the use of femtosecond (fs) laser pulses to create nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and fabricate microresonators, by two-photons polymerization, with embedded nanodiamonds for photonics and quantum sensing applications. The results demonstrate the potential of fs-laser techniques for engineering diamond-based devices with applications in photonics and quantum information technologies.\n\nLaser-induced periodic surface structures on titanium alloy and zirconia ceramics formed by irradiation of femtosecond two-color double-pulse sequences\n\nPresenter: Masayuki Kakehata (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST))\n\nAuthors: Masayuki Kakehata (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)), Hideki Ohmura (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)), Hidehiko Yashiro (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST))\n\nAbstract: Titanium alloy and zirconia ceramics (3Y-TZP) are commonly used for medical implants because of their high-mechanical property and biocompatibility. We have observed fs-laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) on 3Y-TZP and confirmed positive effects on medical implant. To investigate the mechanism of LIPSS formation, we have carried out one-color double-pulse irradiation experiments. In this study, we report two-color double-pulse irradiation[4] on titanium alloy and 3Y-TZP with controlling polarization.\n\nCharacterization of the Nonlinear Optical Properties of Glass Using the Z-scan Technique for Advancing Laser-Glass Processing in Photovoltaics\n\nPresenter: Grigorios Boulogiannis (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE)\n\nAuthors: Grigorios Boulogiannis (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE), Lasse Bienkowski (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE), Anna Münzer (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE), Fabian Meyer (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE), Andreas Brand (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE), Jan Nekarda (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE), Katrin Dulitz (Institut für Ionenphysik und Angewandte Physik, Universität Innsbruck)\n\nAbstract: Laser processing of soda-lime glass, typically used as a cover in photovoltaic (PV) modules, to enhance mainly its optical, wetting and anti-soiling properties, is of significant importance for the PV industry. However, laser processing of a transparent, brittle and heat-sensitive material, such as glass, is challenging. Throughput and cost are still key issues and further improvements must be done to establish laser-glass processing as the standard processing method for PV module glass. Owing to the possibility of exploiting nonlinear light-matter interactions, the use of ultrashort pulsed lasers (USP) for laser-glass processing has already been proposed, offering excellent quality, when compared to any other conventional or laser processing technology. Nevertheless, the throughput of USP laser processing is still low in comparison to other laser technologies, such as nanosecond lasers. In this work, surface modification threshold experiments reveal ≈ 20 % increase in the ablation efficiency of soda-lime glass when heated from 20 °C to 200 °C. This stimulates currently conducted research to understand the temperature dependent absorption mechanism behind this effect, which can prove instrumental in increasing the throughput of USP laser processing. Motivated by this result, we use the Z-scan technique to determine the nonlinear optical properties of soda-lime glass. A fully automated Z-scan setup is designed and built to be capable of measuring over a wavelength range from 310 nm to 2600 nm with adjustable substrate temperatures from 20 °C to 1500°C. As an optical source, we use an Yb-doped regenerative amplifier, with an average power of 6 W, pulse duration of 180 fs and a central wavelength of 1030 nm. We calculate the four-photon absorption coefficient and nonlinear refractive index for soda-lime glass at room temperature and at 1030 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the four-photon absorption coefficient of soda-lime glass has been reported in the scientific literature.\n\nAdhesion strength of hydroxyapatite layer on zirconia substrates coated by droplets eliminated type pulsed-laser deposition\n\nPresenter: Hidehiko Yashiro (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology)\n\nAuthors: Masayuki Kakehata (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology Tsukuba Center Tsukuba Central), Hidehiko Yashiro (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology)\n\nAbstract: High crystalline hydroxyapatite coating layer was fabricated by a droplet elimination pulsed-laser deposition scheme. Adhesion of this coating layer becomes stronger as increasing the annealing temperature. This coating will survive long period in vivo and enhance the bone-formation on its surface and strong and early bone-bonding will be obtained.\n\nLIPSS formation on soda-lime glass by femtosecond laser beam : effect of repetition rate with two different wavelengths (1030nm and 515 nm)\n\nPresenter: Alex Capelle (Université d'Orléans)\n\nAuthors: Alex Capelle (Université d'Orléans), Nadjib Semmar (GREMI - CNRS UMR7344 - Université d'Orléans)\n\nAbstract: In this work, we investigate the laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) formation on soda-lime glass using a femtosecond (fs) laser source, with two different wavelengths are λ= 1030 nm and λ= 515 nm. Due to the nonlinear absorption behavior of the fs-laser beam in soda-lime glass, we introduce a framework featuring a combined thin metal film of silver and chromium (Ag:100 nm + Cr:30 nm) deposited onto soda-lime glass by DC sputtering, taht helps to absorb the laser beem on the material surface. This substrate is employed under green and IR light irradiations to induce the formation of LIPSS. Four different repetition rates (f) such as 10 kHz, 50 kHz, 100 kHz, and 250 kHz were employed.\n\nLaser induced forward transfer of cells towards engineered grafts\n\nPresenter: Stavroula Elezoglou (National Technical University of Athens, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Athens, Greece)\n\nAuthors: Stavroula Elezoglou (National Technical University of Athens, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Athens, Greece), Antonis Hatziapostolou (Department of Naval Architecture, School of Engineering, University of West Attica, 12243 Athens, Greece.), Apostolos Klinakis (Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece), Ioanna Zergioti (National Technical University of Athens, School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Athens, Greece)\n\nAbstract: The use of lasers in the life sciences has increased dramatically in recent years, most notably in the field of bioprinting, an additive manufacturing technique that makes it possible to precisely create living tissue. A laser-based bioprinting technique called Laser Induced Forward Transfer, can print cells in a wide variety of substrates, creating ex vivo grafts in terms of regenerative medicine.

Laser-induced graphitization is a direct write technique which offers the simultaneous synthesis and patterning of carbon complexes by simply scanning a laser beam over a polymeric precursor. By simply scanning the laser beam in three dimensions such materials can be rapidly structured into desired architectures, offering the laser direct writing (LDW) of various key applications, including sensors, unique identification tags, and energy devices. Despite the versatility and scalability of this technique, a deeper understanding of the underlying photothermal mechanisms is required to exquisitely control the resulting morphology and properties. The specific formation mechanism of the carbon complexes has been an issue of debate for many years with the prevailing notion of a simple photothermal conversion reaction that mainly depends on the laser fluence. In this study, we reveal that structural formation is a highly complex, temporally- and spatially-dependent phenomena which cannot be explained solely by the laser fluence, and further propose and validate a mechanism based on the formation of laser-induced defects. Our proposed formation mechanism is composed of 3 phases, (1) nucleation of laser-induced defects, (2) slow growth of defects and increase in defect number, and (3) the sudden growth of defects due to graphitization. The model is further validated by intentionally introducing controlled defects by femtosecond laser irradiation, and indicate the implications of a two-laser laser direct writing technique to go beyond the current processing limits.\n\nThree-dimensional carbon fiber networks with multiple self-orienting laser-induced periodic surface structures enabled by ultrafast laser processing.\n\nPresenter: Shu Hayashi (Princeton University)\n\nAuthors: Shu Hayashi (Princeton University), Amelia Sanchirico (Princeton University), Ankit Das (Princeton University), Craig Arnold (Princeton University)\n\nAbstract: While 3D-networks of nano-textured carbon fibers (CFs) are highly promising materials for electrochemical energy storage and tissue engineering applications, it is extremely difficult to perform wide-area nano-texturing using conventional methods without damaging the bulk structure. Therefore, nano-texturing is generally performed on delicate fibers by chemical processing, which relies on the use of highly toxic chemicals that are environmentally unfriendly and may cause unexpected reactions upon application (i.e., explosions for energy storage or cell-death for tissue engineering) unless carefully cleaned. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of an interconnected 3D network of CFs possessing periodic nano-scaled ripples, or laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) via femtosecond (fs) laser processing [1]. For the fs-laser-processed CFs, we observed the coexistence of two distinct types of LIPSS with different spatial periodicities of ~800 nm (low-spatial-frequency LIPSS, LSFL) and ~100 nm (high-spatial-frequency LIPSS, HSFL). Furthermore, it was indicated that the orientation of the LSFL was highly dependent on the structural-morphology and propagation direction of the fibers, while the orientation of the HSFL was solely dependent on the fundamental laser polarization direction. This suggests that the two LIPSS formed through different interference mechanisms; specifically, LSFL formed through the interference with Fresnel diffraction patterns projected by the fiber edges, while HSFL formed through the interference of surface plasmons leading to LSFL-splitting. The current findings not only open a new route for the preparation of nano-textured carbon materials for future energy and regenerative-medicine applications, but also reveals important fundamental insights into the underlining physical phenomena of LIPSS.

The potential of this technique has been thoroughly explored across various domains such as Food Industry, Energy sector, Automotive packaging, and Space exploration. Direct laser sintering facilitates the mass production of digital conductive and dielectric patterns. This innovative approach offers substantial benefits to existing additive manufacturing technologies, resulting in products characterized by reduced resistivities, enhanced adhesion, high aspect ratios, and high-resolution line patterns on flexible and temperature-sensitive substrates. The development of transformative, cost-effective technologies has been a central focus, aiming higher aspect ratios and finer patterning, in alignment with the prevailing trend towards sustainability and environmental stewardship. Illustrative examples of laser sintering applications within the energy sector, such as the fabrication of photovoltaic grid electrodes, will be presented. Additionally, insights will be provided into the utilization of this additive manufacturing method, alongside adaptive laser ablation and drilling, in the production of advanced compact automotive sensor packages for autonomous vehicles. Our efforts have been dedicated to the meticulous design and optimization of fabrication processes, achieving impressive speeds of up to thousands mm/sec, with the objective of seamless integration into a pilot line. The Food industry, encompassing crucial activities such as resourcing, production, processing, packaging, and marketing of edible goods, represents a cornerstone of the global economy. As global initiatives towards ensuring food safety and security gain momentum, there is a heightened interest in smart, \"active\" food packaging technologies. A notable highlight of our presentation will be the development of intelligent food packaging CO2 sensors capable of monitoring gas released during food shelf life, achieved through precise localized laser sintering techniques. Furthermore, international endeavors are focused on in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), aimed at minimizing costs associated with lunar and Martian missions. The utilization of indigenous space materials for fabricating objects, components, building blocks, or platforms utilizing additive manufacturing techniques assumes paramount significance. Preliminary findings in the laser sintering of regolith will be discussed in this context.\n\nSynthesis and study of YAG:Ln for multiphoton 3D lithography\n\nPresenter: Mangirdas Malinauskas (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania)\n\nAuthors: Arthur Harnik (Vilnius University), Ugnė Usaitė (Vilnius University), Greta Merkininkaitė (Vilnius University), Simas Šakirzanovas (Vilnius University), Mangirdas Malinauskas (Laser Research Center, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, Lithuania)\n\nAbstract: An increasing number of novel synthesized materials allows extensive studies for their use in additive manufacturing, especially offered by diverse optical 3D printing techniques. The structuring via laser multiphoton 3D lithography empowers miniaturization and integration for various applications. However, there is still a limited number of reports on the precise structurization of polycrystalline and transparent YAG (Y3Al5O12). Research discussed in this study experimentally proves the possibility to synthesize and 3D micro-structure pure, crystalline, and transparent YAG substances which are opening micro-/nano-engineering of optically active devices such as micro-lasers and photonic integrated circuits (PICs). XRD patterns have shown that pure YAG is only obtained when samples were heated at 1600°C, since when heated at 600°C no crystallized YAG is formed and when heated at 1500°C some impurities remain. Structurization study of the material was performed while shifting laser irradiation power on X-axis from 50 mW to 250 mW and translation speed on Y-axis from 5000 µm/s to 10000 µm/s, with size of each formed woodpile 3D structure being sized 50 µm x 50 µm x 30 µm. After structurization samples were rinsed in ethanol and Novec™ 7100 for contrasting. SEM images of sample obtained without heating showed that most of the fabricated structures were intact, with some missing during after wet chemical development. Later annealing the sample at 600°C more structures had disappeared while others have shrunk due to the removal of organic fraction from the material. Finally, after calcinating the sample at 1600°C structures have fallen apart and melted, most likely due to the temperature being too high or sintering lasting for too long. These results show, that while still further improvements of fabrication protocol are needed, it is already opening the pathway for additive manufacturing of optical grade active devices at micro- and nano-scales enabling geometrically non-restricted 3D architectures.

Key findings reveal that surface morphology of AISI 304 transitions to high- and low-spatial frequency LIPSS with increasing number of laser pulses, latter one attributed to surface plasmon polariton excitation and fast electron-phonon coupling. Conversely, the higher thermal conductivity of Al leads to microscale structures after the initial pulse, inhibiting coherent periodic modulations by causing stronger scattering in subsequent pulses, thus preventing LIPSS formation. This research underscores the critical influence of initial surface morphology and material properties on the possibility of LIPSS generation, advancing the understanding of optical scattering effects and their impact on surface evolution.\n\nHigh rate laser polishing using a polygon scanner\n\nPresenter: Linda Pabst (Laserinstitute Hochschule Mittweida)\n\nAuthors: Linda Pabst (Laserinstitute Hochschule Mittweida), André Streek (LLaserinstitute Hochschule Mittweida)\n\nAbstract: In this study, a ns-boost laser with an average power of 3 kW and a power of 6 kW in boost mode was combined with ultrafast beam deflection using a polygon scanner. The laser beam source had a square top-hat intensity distribution in the imaging plane. The influence of processing parameters such as the pulse energy, repetition rate, scan speed and track distance on the resulting surface roughness and morphology of stainless steel 1.4301 was investigated. The aim was to determine the ideal process window for achieving minimum roughness values with high surface rates at the same time. A high-quality surface was achieved with optimal processing parameters. The initial surface roughness of Sa = 0.275 µm was reduced to a minimum of Sa = 0.096 µm, a 65% reduction in initial surface roughness. Simultaneously, the surface gloss was increased from 125 GU to 400 GU, resulting in a 220% increase in gloss value. This transformation allowed the previously matt surface to become reflective, as shown in Figure 1, thereby enhancing the appearance of the material. The combination of the laser’s boost mode with the polygon scanner allowed the full average laser power to be used for the polishing process. Furthermore, the square top-hat intensity distribution enables higher area rates by significantly reducing the line overlap compared to Gaussian intensity distribution. As a result, a real area rate of up to 156 cm²/s could be achieved. The processing time was only 1.1 min/m², achieving industrial relevant process times for laser beam polishing.\n\nMulti points Calibration for Laser Ablation/ICP-MS imaging of biological tissues\n\nPresenter: Raphaëlle Escoube (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire )\n\nAuthors: Alexandre Legrand (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire ), Manon Raimbault (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire ), Céline Bouvier Capely (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire ), Raphaëlle Escoube (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire )\n\nAbstract: Comparaison of different biological materials for calibration\n\nUpconversion luminescence in Er-doped tellurite-phosphate glass during crystallization with femtosecond laser pulses\n\nPresenter: Wojciech Talik (Jagiellonian University)\n\nAuthors: Wojciech Talik (Jagiellonian University), Magdalena Leśniak (AGH University of Science and Technology), Dominik Dorosz (AGH University of Science and Technology), Witold Zawadzki (Jagiellonian University), Krzysztof Dzierzega (Jagiellonian University)\n\nAbstract: Crystallization through femtosecond direct laser writing (DLW) is a promising technique for inducing oriented nanocrystals and nanostructures in glass materials, including those with photoluminescent properties. Glasses doped with rare earth ions such as Er3+, Eu3+, or Yb3+ exhibit efficient luminescence, including upconversion luminescence (UCL). Furthermore, their spectra are highly sensitive to the ion host, making them valuable for monitoring the effects of the DLW process. While research in this field has been ongoing for several years, the UCL properties related to the irradiation of such luminescent materials with laser pulses are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigate the UCL properties of Er-doped TeO2-P2O5-BaF2-ZnF2-Na2O (TeP) glass during its crystallization induced by irradiation with 230 fs laser pulses at a wavelength of 1030 nm, with varying repetition rates and energies. A femtosecond laser beam was focused within the glass at a depth of 50 µm in air, using an achromatic lens (NA=0.25), resulting in a spot diameter of 3.9 µm (1/e2). The induced crystalline phase was confirmed each time by Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and is attributed to barium fluoride (BaF2) crystals. The recorded UCL spectra consist of several broad luminescence bands at 525 nm, 550 nm, and 660 nm, excited by two-photon processes corresponding to electronic transitions between Stark manifolds of the excited lower-lying Er3+ energy levels. These spectra exhibit significant variations depending on the laser parameters and exposure time. The intensity of these bands carries information about the concentration of Erbium ions, thus providing insights into the final outcome of the DLW process. Figure1: Evolution of UCL spectra during DLW in TeP glass with 230 fs laser pulses (a). Widefield (b) and fluorescence (c) microscopic images of irradiated areas of glass sample.

This trend in active ingredient development presents a challenge to the pharmaceutical industry, as poor solubility limits bioavailability in most cases. By reducing the particle size, the active surface increases, which generally improves the dissolution rate and transport characteristics, so that human cells can absorb the active ingredient faster and more efficiently. Our goal was to prove that pulsed laser ablation is suitable for increasing the effectiveness of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In our experiments we were able to significantly reduce the size of the particles of poorly water-soluble non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving active substances (ibuprofen, niflumic acid and meloxicam) by laser ablation in ambient air and distilled water. In this process, lasers with different wavelengths and pulse lengths were used to ablate tablets pressed from commercially available powders.\n\nProduction of composite nanoparticles by ablating along the contact line of silver and gold plates placed in V geometry\n\nPresenter: Tamás Smausz Kolumbán (University of Szeged)\n\nAuthors: Tamás Smausz Kolumbán (University of Szeged)\n\nAbstract: Silver and gold plates were placed in close contact in a V geometry in order to allow the mixing the two components produced by ablation.
