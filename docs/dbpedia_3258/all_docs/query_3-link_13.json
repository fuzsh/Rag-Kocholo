        "text": "This album is the first recording of Thracian composers of the modern Hellenic history, who put their personal stamp on the musical firmament of the urban centers of their time.A tour of the Western European, Byzantine and Oriental art music of the united Thrace of the Hellenes, which, together with traditional music, forms a mosaic of artistic expression, one of the richest in Europe. We visit all those excellent successors of Orpheus, who, with meagre resources, in adverse socio-political circumstances, created local wonders, establishing orchestras and choirs among the numerically limited but highly cultivated Hellenic communities, elevating their culture. Their teaching initiated thousands of young people into the musical art, who in their turn excelled as composers, ecclesiastical musicians, cantors, instrumentalists, singers, musicologists and others. With its epicentre in the city with the greatest Hellenic population up to the end of the 19th century, Constantinople (now Istanbul), we see a musical flowering which, when historical circumstances dictated, was disseminated to the rest of the Hellenic world, establishing new homes for it, while enriching the old ones. Other cities, however, such as Adrianople (now Edirne), Philippopolis (now Plovdiv), Sozopolis (now Sozopol), Saranta Ekklisies (now Kırklareli), Varna, Anchialos (now Pomorie), Xanthi, Dedeağaç (now Alexandroupolis), Komotini, Soufli, Raedestos (now Tekirdağ), Mesimvria, Silivria (now Silivri), Pyrgos (now Burgas) and others, had nothing to envy as regards musical wealth and artistic activity, which were cultivated by the parishes and the hundreds of cultural societies active within them.\n\nIn the wider geographic region of Macedonia and the Balkans trade and transport were developed in late 19th and early 20th century. This kind of development enabled Hellenic wealthy bourgeois to settle in central Europe so as to study and even find better living prospects at that time. Respectively, the well-off Hellenes of the Diaspora contributed to the education and development of their compatriots in their ancestral homes, transferring there the western culture. In this context, the region of Macedonia is a large and central area of the Balkan Peninsula, which encloses a coastal zone, lowland and a mountainous area. Consequently, it contains urban centres of all categories in terms of their location. The essay focuses on the study of the original proliferation of western music in the Hellenic population of Macedonia, which took place during the late Ottoman Empire. The cases of the Hellenic schools, in which music was taught, are examined from a historical and musical-pedagogical point of view. The proposal also examines the contributions of the Associations and Philharmonic Societies, where various musical groups were operating and with the help of specialized music instructors taught their members (adult and minors) music theory and practice. The study involves significant urban centres of Macedonia, in which Hellenic communities developed substantial educational and cultural activities such as Thessaloniki, Serres, Veria, Monastir, Kozani, Choristi, and Kavala, despite the fact of whether those cities were eventually incorporated into the Hellenic national space or not.\n\nMusicological discourse about the musical life of Thessaloniki during the Ottoman era has often been influenced by chauvinistic distinctions between mainstream and peripheral cultures and compromised by insufficient knowledge of the cultural practices within supposedly marginal territories. This bias has resulted in a marginalisation of mid-nineteenth-century indigenous composers and a sometimes disproportionate idealisation of later musicians. The current study addresses the dearth of previous research, focusing on Dimitrios Lalas (1844-1911) and Emilios Riadis (1880-1935). While Lalas’ artistic achievement has sometimes been narrowed down to that one of a Wagner epigone, Riadis’ fame widely rests on an alleged association with French impressionists on the one hand, and the creation of a genuinely national and ‘modern’ style of composition, on the other. This paper puts such points of view into perspective through a close examination of contemporaneous writings. At the same time, revealing light is thrown on the question of why past attempts of enriching indigenous music culture with Western models proceeded rather conscientiously in Thessaloniki, hampering Lalas’ and Riadis’ own artistic development and delaying a fair recognition of their work.\n\nThis study combines two elements related to music in ancient Greece: musicians and musical instruments of Classical Greece. The main research questions answered in this study are: \"What were the musicians of Classical Greece?\" and \"What were the most important musical instruments of Classical Greece?\". The study of the musicians of Classical Greece showed that the words \"music\" and \"musician\" are not entirely representative of the ones used in the antique context and therefore a clearer framein which we use these two terms for the purposes of a contemporary studyhas to be given. There are a lot of limitations in the research of musicians in early and late antiquity due to the fragmentary sources and the absence of sufficient and reliable archaeological evidence.\n\nIn the following paper, placing 19th century as central point, we are going to establish the submission about the existence of a Hellenic, cohesive musical history as a certain fact. We observe it to walk side by side with the broader history of Hellenic element for which historiography detects two crucial gashes (in 1204 and 1821 correspondingly) as well as a gash of less depth in 1922. Such supervisory has been achieved due to a corpus which the researcher managed to elevate from obscurity during the elaboration of her PhD dissertation, through which the submission of such history is conversely being proved. Further more, we will prove that it is not a peripheral musical civilization but a different aspect of the European musical civilization, deserving an equal, international care and research.\n\nThe presence of many young talented composers outside Greece, studying in prominent European music centres during the 1920s and 30s, set them free from the ideological compulsions of Greek musical nationalism prevailing in Athenian musical life during the first decades of the 20th century. The creative approach and adoption of aspects of musical modernism, having been established around the same period in western music, are subsequently commented upon in the works, style and ideology of four different Greek composers: the pioneer of atonality and twelve-note technique in Greece, Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960); the innovator and descendant of the Second Viennese School, Nikos Skalkottas (1904-1949); the ardent supporter of timbral innovation into new instruments and ensembles, Dimitrios Levidis (1886-1951); and, finally, the ascetical and secluded Harilaos Perpessas (1907-1995), another pupil of Schoenberg in Berlin.\n\nThe influence of Western music on art music in modern Greece, though granted, has not been studied but only occasionally, through the work of very few Greek composers. A complete study of the aforementioned relationship is therefore the main objective for the integration of Greek art music creation in the Western-European musical map. Aim of this proposal is the research, registration and presentation of Greek composers in the 20th century, who have studied in countries of the European Union. In this paper the following parameters will be examined: a) the preferences of Greek composers with regard to the place of their studies. An effort will be made to develop a relative argumentation for the justification of their choices (correlation with purely musical and aesthetic criteria regarding specific European schools, choices suggested by professors or imposed, e.g. by an establishment offering scholarships, etc.). b) the changes during the century in the aforementioned preferences, and eventually their correlation with socio-political phenomena (financial crisis, world wars etc.) c) the fluctuation of the number of composers who had studied in Europe during the century, related to the standard of living in the urban centres, the gradual development of the industry of sound and the resulting possibility for the dissemination of the art of music in wider social strata and, finally d) the influences they were subject to, depending on the country where they had studied, the Faculty, the Professor and the main streams that were prevailing.\n\nhe project titled “The Evolution of the Jewish Music Tradition in Greece” is a research study on the music of the Jewish population of various regions that nowadays constitute the Greek state. It has been accomplished after thorough bibliographical and on-site research. The final products of the research are a) the present essay that deals with the research, b) a compact disc with selected Greek Sephardic and Romaniote paraliturgical and secular songs, titled \"Unknown Musical Treasures of the Jewish Tradition of Greece', c) a booklet concerning the songs, which comes with the compact disc, d) the music sheets of the songs, and e) the incorporation of these songs into a special section of the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki, dedicated to the Jewish tradition in Greece."
