I have nothing noteworthy to promote, except for an album I made last year which I’m not gonna plug, because I don’t think it’s worth plugging (if you wanna listen to it you can find it on my band camp page, as it’s no longer on any streaming service). I spend most of the my precious time thinking about what types of songs I wanna write, and then, after I’ve procrastinated for way too long, I go on and make something completely different than what I had in mind. Although I am proud of the music I’ve made in the past, I’m in the middle of an artistic “overhaul”, partly because the COVID-19 pandemic, and the isolation it entails, has forced me to spend time with myself, thus making me to overanalyze every inch of my being. Fingers crossed that something good comes out of this shit!

I am Panos aka Blirp Blorp from ΜΠΡΙΤΖΟΛΙΤΣΕΣ. I am 20 years old and I live in the centre of Athens. I am playing music with my pal Thanassis aka Mr. Mayor in our basement. I am shouting, screaming and violating the guitar and your ears to express my rage. When I am not playing music, I like reading comics under the angry sound of farfisas and drawing like an armless child. (If you are interested in playing synths in a style like ours, feel free to contact us. We are a duo but we are looking for a new member) We have another band that is called POLITBEERO.

And will he die someday? It has happened to billions of people. Unruly life is nonsense… the greatest happiness is union with God. Is art a religion of an illusion? These and thousands of other thoughts reflect this spirit. So speaking realistically, Apostolos loved music and started writing poetry and music from adolescence. Influenced by philosophy, theology, literature, he shaped his world and a strong personal view. Perpetual musical change pervades his composing work to this day. He composes, orchestrates, plays, writes the lyrics, sings. Indifferent to the respective musical fashions, uses those colors of the palette, which can serve his respective vision. As an apprentice producer, he always chooses to keep the old imperfections recorded (in contrast to the inanimate polished music of the time) in terms of position and location. If you search for his work, you will find unexpected musical moments. In 2022 his new work with covers will be released.\n\nhttps://apostolos.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/6jHQzRql9yp8Ai8ROPOIRR?si=SyX2si9QTzuJHHtIqrU9-A&utm_source=copy-link\n\nhttps://apostolosmusics.wixsite.com/apostolos\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/apostolosmusics?ref=bookmarks\n\nDaphne Xanthopoulou\n\nΑ piece of music that needs to be played loud\n\nBłażej Kotowski - A - Amplify Raumschiff\n\nA piece of music that moves you forward\n\nFumbata Phiri - Epochal Silence\n\nA piece of music that gets stuck in your head\n\nAlexandra Spence - Bell, Fern\n\nA piece of music that makes you want to dance\n\nJean C.

They were formed in 2010 and their first line up was: Mario Muco on vocals and guitar, Kostas Klagkos on bass and Dimitris Filippou on drums. As a trio they played several live shows in Athens’s underground scene and recorded two demos. After a long period and many band member changes the band was put into hibernation for a while.\n\nMario, who is the main composer and lyricist of the band, kept the band idea alive for three years by playing solo acoustic live shows enriched with his compositions and many covers. In 2019 and after some random incidents the band took form again with the addition of George Avouris on bass/backing vocals, Dimos Kontovounisios on drums and Lefteris Kavouras on guitar/backing vocals. With this line up the four-piece continues until today. On April 2 of 2021 they released their first official album called “The Plan Is There Is No Plan ”. The album is a collection of recordings that took place from 2010 to 2019 and also including a Remix that was done to their song “It’s Insane” by the Canadian producer Zenchuk.\n\nSince then they continue to write new material which will soon be released and play live shows in the local scene.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/ThePigeonholeProject\n\nBill - Berdnturtle\n\nΑ piece of music that needs to be played loud\n\nThe Knife - Heartbeats\n\nA piece of music that moves you forward\n\nBroncho - Boys Got to Go\n\nA piece of music that gets stuck in your head\n\nThe Rolling Stones - Miss You\n\nA piece of music that makes you want to dance\n\nTalking Heads - This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\n\nA piece of music that makes you feel badass\n\nOasis - Live Forever\n\nA piece of music that you remember from your childhood\n\nBlack Sabbath - Paranoid\n\nA piece of music that reminds you your hometown\n\nSlayer - South of Heaven\n\nThe piece of music you’ve listened to the most\n\nTalking Heads - Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\n\nAs a band we are based in Athens, Greece and we formed in Chania on 2016.
