        "text": "We considered 351 patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), followed at the University Hospital of Padua and at the Veneto Oncological Institute. Of these, 72 (20.5%) suffered from bone metastases. The sample was divided according to the timing of presentation of bone metastases into synchronous (within 6 months of diagnosis of primary tumor) and metachronous (after 6 months). We collected data on the type and grading of the primary tumor and on the features of bone metastases. Our analysis shows that the group of synchronous metastases generally presents primary tumors with a higher degree of malignancy rather than the ones of the metachronous group. This is supported by the finding of a Ki-67 level in GEP-NETs, at the diagnosis of bone metastases, significantly higher in the synchronous group. Moreover, in low-grade NETs, chromogranin A values are higher in the patients with synchronous metastases, indicating a more burden of disease. The parameters of phospho-calcium met...\n\nNeuroendocrine tumors (NETs) metastasize to bone; however, a multi-institution evaluation of the natural history and complications of bone metastases across multiple NET subtypes has not, to our knowledge, previously been conducted. At two tertiary academic centers, we identified patients with bone metastases from databases of patients with a diagnosis of NET between 2004 and 2008. Detection of bone metastases, occurrence of skeletal-related events (SREs), and interventions were analyzed using summary statistics and categorical methods. Time-to-event data were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests. Between 2004 and 2008, 82 out of 691 NET patients (12%) were reported to have bone metastases. Of the 82 patients with bone metastases, 55% were men and their median age was 49. Bone metastases occurred in 25% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, 20% of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, 9% of carcinoid tumors, and 8% of pancreatic NETs. At time of detection of b...\n\nNeuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a rare tumor arising from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Most of these present in the advanced stage and palliative chemotherapy remains the only option. The prognosis remains poor with the standard chemotherapy regimen of platinum and etoposide (EP) providing modest survival benefit. The study was done for 3 years at a tertiary cancer center in South India. Patients with a diagnosis of metastatic NEC were analyzed for clinical and pathological characteristics. The treatment outcomes and prognostic factors were evaluated using appropriate statistical test. A total of 114 patients of metastatic NEC satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Gastrointestinal including hepatobiliary tract (33%) was the most common site of primary disease followed by lung (26%), genitourinary (15%), head and neck (14%), and unknown primary (9%). On analysis of pattern of metastasis, liver (65%) was the most common site followed by bone (54%) and lung (42%)....\n\nMetastatic neuroendocrine tumors (mNETs) are rare, heterogeneous tumors that present diagnostic and treatment challenges, with limited data on the management of mNETs in clinical practice. The present study was designed to identify current diagnostic and treatment patterns in mNET patients treated in the US community oncology setting. Patient-level data was collected from medical records of adults with mNETs from the Vector Oncology Data Warehouse, a comprehensive US community oncology network database. Of the 263 patients included (median follow-up, 22 months; range, 0.1-193.9), 30.4% (80/263) had intestinal tumors, 11.0% (29/263) had pancreatic, and 58.6% (154/263) had tumors of other or unknown location. Progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of first-line therapy differed significantly by tumor grade (log rank P = 0.0016) and location (P = 0.0044), as did overall survival (OS) (grade, P &lt; 0.0001; location, P = 0.0068). Median PFS and OS for patients with undocumented ...\n\nIntroduction Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with histological features varying from well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNETs) to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNECs). In this study, we investigated the clinicomorphological spectrum of NENs including tumor grade, site of origin, and metastasis. Methods We retrospectively studied 125 cases of NENs (at the Department of Histopathology, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi) between the years 2014 and 2020. Slides of these cases were retrieved from the departmental archives and were evaluated for the tumor type, grade, and site of origin. Results The mean age of the patients was 51.25±16.10 years. Overall, the liver was the most common site of the tumor (27.2%), followed by the small bowel (15.2%). Grade 2 was the most common tumor grade (40.8%), and most of the tumors were primary (68.8%). A total of 84.8% of the tumors were WDNETs/carcinoids, while 15.2..."
