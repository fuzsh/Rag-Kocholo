        "text": "Theorimata 2: On History\n\nTemporary Exhibitions Space (-1)\n\n1 October — 1 November 2020\n\nTheorimata, the exhibition / institution by AICA Hellas, the Greek Section of the International Association of Art Critics, AICA International, is presented for the second time at the National Museum of Contemporary Art Athens (EMST), from October 1 until November 1, 2020 in the EMST Temporary Exhibitions Space (-1).\n\nThe first exhibition was presented in 2018 with the aim to become a biennial event, providing the chance to curators, critics, art history scholars, and also artists to converse, collaborate and intervene in the artistic field; the theme of “Theorimata” will be differentiated each time, focusing on the characteristics and major issues of each period.\n\nFor the exhibition Theorimata 2: On History, 25 curators, scholars and art critics, members of the Greek Section of AICA, propose 56 artists who, with History as their axis, promote the function of art as an alternative educational tool and a means of dynamically intervening in the social fabric.\n\nThe idea that the knowledge of the past is an aid to the interpretation of the present and a guide to the future, asserted by Thucydides in his first book on the History of the Peloponnesian War, runs through the exhibition in which installations, constructions, sculptures, photographs, paintings, artists’ books, drawings, videos and happenings are presented.\n\nMarina Gioti, Aristeidis Lappas, Thanasis Chondros — Alexandra Katsiani as proposed by curator Sozita Goudouna\n\nCHONDROS/KATSIANI |HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH | EMST Participation\n\nCatalogue Text by Sozita Goudouna\n\nTime is an unsettling mechanism as it becomes suspended, inaccessible or even ahistorical, while history unfolds to reveal the relationship between temporality, physical reality, technological advancements and our body. In the realm of representation, layered and dense meanings, compositions and intimately narrated, visual, temporal experiences mostly refer to a deeper personal or social reality. Artistic endeavor persists in time and art history persists, almost exclusively, by documenting, archiving, and evaluating cultural activity.\n\nThe on-going importance concerning ‘liveness’ in visual artists’ work and the engagement with more recent investigations of the temporal and the historical within curatorial practice reveals not only the ephemerality of “liveness,” but also the evanescent nature of the artistic profession itself. The artistic duo, Katsiani and Chondros, and their withdrawal from artistic practice in 2004 cannot but raise questions about the significance of “disappearance” in a scene that is always focused on presence, recurrence and persistence.\n\nSixteen years following their disengagement from the art scene, Chondros and Katsiani, focus not on the etymological meaning, from the Greek verb “οἶδα,” of the word “History” that signifies knowledge, but on the “ignorance of history” and the “history of ignorance.” According to the artists, ‘events, big and small, always happen everywhere. Today, however, information on them is more abundant than ever before, capturing a shapeless image of the world. Information about institutions, economies, technologies, ideologies of the past, present, and even estimates of the future, gives us the illusion of knowledge, while knowledge is produced by combination, correlation, interpretation, in short by the assignment of meaning to events.’ In 2001, the artistic duo spread some flyers with the question “How do you deal with what you don’t understand?” They no longer remember the historical context that led them to this gesture, but that is exactly what happens with history. As if on a march, they single out a few heads at the front of the parade, which they then lose sight of in a downward slope of the road, while some others temporarily emerge. A blown-up version of this flyer lies at the core of their participation in the exhibition.\n\nChondros/Katsiani short bio\n\nThanasis Chondros was born in Thessaloniki, 1953. Alexandra Katsiani was born in Siatista, 1954. They met each other in 1973. Since 1974 they coordinate their behaviour. They worked as literature teachers in public schools. They presented their first performance in 1981. In 1980 started publishing “Tsamba (Gratis)” booklets. “Schedia” was their first alternative art venue in 1983. Under the same name, their pirate art radio station aired in 1985. In 1987 they enrolled in the Visual Poetry group. With friends, they formed the group “Dimosioypalliliko Retire” in 1984, a group taking a different name in each appearance in 1998, and the “Brotherhood of Immaculate Liberation” in 2001. They founded the religion of “Deus ex Machina;” introduced “Zoologicokipology,” the science of zoos; and founded the “Research Center for the Identification of Happiness.” In 2004 they announced their withdrawal from the visual arts scene. With their daughter, Danae, and their son, Constantinos, they formed the running team “Anonymous Rationalists” in 2014, and the “Oikoi2310,” a group of multiple activities in 2015.\n\nMARINA GIOTI | THE SECRET SCHOOL | EMST Participation\n\nCatalogue Text by Sozita Goudouna\n\nThe phenomenon of crossing the borders between archival material, traditional media (painting and photography) and contemporary media (cinema, television, video, computer and other hyper- media) has preoccupied media theory and the history of art, especially with regards to experimental moving-image appropriation art. Marina Gioti challenges the ways in which history is produced and disseminated by staging a ‘sabotaged’ version of a found propaganda film, produced during the Greek military junta in the 70s, supporting a largely debated fact — for many a national myth — related to the birth of the modern Greek nation and the construction of its ethnic identity.\n\nThe artist deploys strategies of appropriation not simply as a form of historical and political criticism but crucially as a mechanism through which to expose the ways media, archives and history are interweaved. In her filmic work, Gioti often manipulates found footage and makes use of pre-existing film or video material to compose new moving-image pieces. The Secret School (2009) depicts a family visit at the National Historical Museum of Greece in the early 70’s. As they wander among the exhibits of the 1821 Revolution, one of the paintings comes to life. The artist explores certain cardinal aspects of history and deploys media so as to compose a ritual of building and displaying the image. In some sense this is a kind of a cinematic wide-screen canvas; an image to be deciphered by the viewer, except that the image moves, has sound and political implications.\n\nMarina Gioti Short Bio\n\nMARINA GIOTI (Αthens, 1972) Filmmaker/ visual artist born and based in Athens, Greece. In her works, which comprise of films, installations and media art pieces, she often revisits historical eras and stories offering parallel and often tragicomic re-readings to dominant narratives. Archival and scientific research alongside observation are playing a crucial role in her practice, while objets trouvés and cultural ‘debris’ (objects, films, recordings, ruins) serve as raw material or situate themselves at the center of some of her works. Her work has been presented worldwide at festivals, including Berlinale, Toronto, Viennale, CPH: DOX, Transmediale, Donau Festival and museum shows and biennials such the 5th Thessaloniki Biennial, Wroclaw Media Art Biennial and the 1st Anren Biennial in China. In 2017 she was a participating artist at Documenta 14 in Athens and Kassel and a fellow at Akademie Schloss Solitude in Stuttgart, Germany. Through 2019 she worked on the audiovisual project Atlas- A Sound Cartography of Europe, a joint commission by IRCAM-Centre Pompidou, ZKM-Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe and Onassis Stegi. www.marinagioti.net\n\nARISTEIDIS LAPPAS | BYZAS | EMST Participation\n\nCatalogue Text by Sozita Goudouna\n\n“Byzas” is a commissioned piece for Theorems 2020, by Aristeidis Lappas; a visual artist who represents a generation of individuals whose voices are only starting to be heard, in Greece, yet which accounts for more than half of the world’s population. With a piece that references the founder of the multiethnic “Byzantion,” Lappas manages to draw a parallel between history and artistic form (both in terms of artistic process — particularly the attention to pattern — and medium) that becomes part of the work’s tensed complexity.\n\nThe artist is best known for his colorful, playful and unconventional paintings, sculptures and installations which often require an involvement of the audience. Without forecasting artistic trends or predicting future creation this contribution combines an irreverent and playful approach to (H)istory, the history of art and painting with an interest in motifs and textiles originated in Byzantine, Islamic, Arab, Ethiopian and Middle Eastern arts alluding to the diverse history of the Byzantium that included partly Hellenized and partly Romanized peoples of Egypt, the Near East, Anatolia, and the Balkans.\n\nHybrid forms provoke imaginative reactions and certain of his paintings resemble fragments of classical symbols. Lappas incorporates scenes and emotions from daily life, mythology, religion with abstract or obscure references and ideas. The artist avoids direct references to Greek folklore art or classical antiquity and uses patterns and composition as visual symbols independent of ethnic stereotypes. He achieves this by the seemingly spontaneous character of his painterly gesture that is ultimately determined by geometry and by the exploration of the relationship between painting and sculpture.\n\nPainted surfaces with material sensibility and tangibility are challenged by the geometry of the composition. The “color field” seems to extend in all directions, beyond the boundaries of the canvas, as the colorful surfaces push the painting and meaning beyond its boundaries, in the indefinite space. Lappas isolates the visual properties of color, to weaken illusion, emphasizing abstraction, purely geometric shapes, and the operation of the flat surface through the interface of color contrast. While “Byzas” evokes a sense of spirituality, it is abstracted from national identities or constructed historical narratives to reveal the emancipated, balanced and expanded identity that the artist is seeking to grasp.\n\nARISTEIDIS LAPPAS short bio\n\nAristeidis Lappas (Athens, 1993) lives and work in Athens. He holds a BA from the University of West England, Bristol, UK during which time he completed an exchange program at Academia De Belle Arti, Bologna, Italy. He has presented his work in exhibitions such as, Polymorphic Entrancing Topos, P.E.T Projects, Athens (2019) Ηοp On, Hop Off at Aetopoulos gallery, Part II, The Breeder, Athens (2019); Break Time Contemplations, Transformer, Washington D.C (2018); Athens and it’s Periphery in Regards to Contemporary Painting, Curated by Hugo Wheeler, The Breeder, Athens, Greece (2017). He is represented by The Breeder, Athens.\n\nSozita Goudouna Short Bio\n\nDr. Sozita Goudouna is a professor, curator and the author of “Beckett’s Breath: Anti-theatricality and the Visual Arts” published by Edinburgh Critical Studies in Modernism released in the US by Oxford University Press.
