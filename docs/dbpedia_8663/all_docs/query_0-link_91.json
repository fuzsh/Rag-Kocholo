        "text": "Cormac McCarthy — the celebrated American author of The Road and No Country For Old Men — has died at age 89.\n\nMcCarthy's death was announced by his publisher Penguin Random House after confirmation from his son John McCarthy.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, the publisher said McCarthy died of \"natural causes\" at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning author is best known for his dark and suspenseful novels The Road and No Country For Old Men, which were both made into movies.\n\nHis canon spans 12 novels, two plays, five screenplays and three short stories, many of which are violent tales of the American frontier and post-apocalyptic worlds.\n\nFellow American author Stephen King has remembered McCarthy as \"maybe the greatest American novelist of my time\".\n\nOne of six siblings, McCarthy was born in Rhode Island in 1933 to an Irish Catholic family.\n\nBut he spent most of his childhood in Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father worked as a lawyer.\n\nMcCarthy was said to be a very private man, rarely appearing in media interviews or on the red carpet.\n\nIn 2007, McCarthy told US talk show host Oprah Winfrey, \"I don't think [interviews] are good for your head\".\n\n\"If you spend a lot of time thinking about how to write a book, you probably shouldn't be thinking about it, you probably should be doing it,\" he said.\n\nMcCarthy published his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, in 1965 but it was not until 1992 that he broke through commercially with All The Pretty Horses, which won the National Book Award.\n\nHe also won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for The Road, which describes a father and son's arduous journey as they struggle to survive in the US after the apocalypse.\n\nHis other acclaimed works include Blood Meridian, which some have described as \"The Great American Novel\".\n\nIn a statement, Penguin Random House CEO, Nihar Malaviya, said McCarthy \"changed the course of literature\".\n\n\"For sixty years, he demonstrated an unwavering dedication to his craft, and to exploring the infinite possibilities and power of the written record,\" she said.\n\nMcCarthy, who was married three times, is survived by his two children Cullen and John."
