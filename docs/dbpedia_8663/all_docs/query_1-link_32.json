        "text": "GEOFF BENNETT: Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Cormac McCarthy died today at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nHis books often focused on loss and bloodshed, set everywhere from the American West, to the South, to a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nThroughout his long career, he wrote novels that could be bleak and violent, but that were also hailed for his beautiful prose.\n\nThey were often suffused with moral ambiguity.\n\nThat included some of his best-known works, such as \"No Country For Old Men,\" \"All the Pretty Horses,\" and \"The Road.\"\n\nCritics likened him to Faulkner, Hemingway, and Melville.\n\nJoining us now is writer Walter Kirn, the author of many novels, including up in the air, and he's also a literary critic himself.\n\nThank you for being with us.\n\nCormac McCarthy, as we said, was one of our greatest writers, known for his violent and bleak depictions, his sort of dark view of the human condition.\n\nBut in his own way, he never really wrote an uninteresting sentence.\n\nWhat informed his approach to writing?\n\nWALTER KIRN, Novelist and Critic: Well, Cormac McCarthy was kind of a hybrid of the great American novelists of the last 150 years.\n\nFor some reason, he channeled in an authentic way, not as though he were copying others, everybody, like you say, from Melville on, really.\n\nHe was a very masculine novel, I think -- novelist.\n\nI think that needs to be noted, though his last novel was narrated by a female character, something he'd been preparing for, for 50 years.\n\nSo he was very settled in his tradition.\n\nHe had absorbed all the great writing.\n\nAnd, somehow, he managed to channel it in a new way, as though it came from his deepest self.\n\nIt was as though he was a river that all the other rivers flowed into.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: He was relatively obscure for much of his career.\n\nAnd when fame and acclaim eventually found him, he really abhorred talking about his books.\n\nHe didn't do very many interviews.\n\nIs it fair to say that he was the most, I guess, celebrated, reclusive writer since J.D.\n\nSalinger?\n\nI mean, what accounted for it?\n\nWALTER KIRN: Well, we have got a few celebrated, reclusive writers, like Thomas Pynchon, in this country.\n\nBut McCarthy, who did get around -- he just lived a very private life.\n\nIt wasn't as though he was completely hiding out or he didn't want his photograph taken.\n\nBut he was hard to meet.\n\nYou had to go to Santa Fe.\n\nYou had to sort of seek him out.\n\nBut he wasn't pushing America away.\n\nHe just wanted to do his business.\n\nAnd his business was the page.\n\nAnd that was where he focused himself.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: You, as I understand it, reviewed all of his books.\n\nWhat lines or passages stuck with you, resonated with you?\n\nWALTER KIRN: Oh, no, I can't claim to have reviewed all of them.\n\nBut I have reviewed quite a few of them.\n\nMcCarthy wrote every genre.\n\nHe wrote a great suspense novel in \"No Country For Old Men.\"\n\nHe wrote a great sort of historical, almost horror novel in \"Blood Meridian,\" and he wrote a dystopian science fiction novel in \"The Road.\"\n\nAnd I think \"The Road\" is probably the novel that I think of most these days, because it dealt with war and an uncertain future and perhaps an apocalypse on the horizon for a country much like the United States.\n\nSo it's a very haunting book.\n\nAnd the very end of it, I think, where he looks back at the American landscape through a clear trout stream back into the primeval pre-civilization of this content -- continent, really sticks with me now.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: How do you think McCarthy in his body of work, how will it be remembered?\n\nWALTER KIRN: It's going to be remembered with extreme fondness, respect, and, I think, affection.\n\nHe was a popular novelist.\n\nOnce he got going with \"All the Pretty Horses\" in the early '90s, he became a bestselling American novelist, whose movies -- I mean, whose books were made into movies and whose work became familiar.\n\nAnd when he died today, it wasn't just literary people who started texting me and saying, oh, my gosh, can you believe it?\n\nIt was people of all kinds, the general reader.\n\nWe don't think that the general reader maybe exists in the United States anymore.\n\nBut she does, he does, and they do.\n\nAnd Cormac wrote for all of them.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: How then does his imprint, does his influence show up in contemporary writing?\n\nWALTER KIRN: Well, in some ways, he was a writer of ancient prose.\n\nHe sounded at times like the Bible.\n\nHe sounded at times like ancient philosophical texts.\n\nHe really combined knowledge of the past and present in a way few do here.\n\nAnd I think he will be remembered as a kind of gold standard for a very laconic, strong, minimalist American prose, though his early books were anything but minimalist.\n\nI mean, if you look at \"Blood Meridian,\" it was a book that might have been written by a mad prophet of the desert in the year zero.\n\n(LAUGHTER) GEOFF BENNETT: Walter Kirn, thanks so much for joining us, as we acknowledge and pay tribute to the many contributions of Cormac McCarthy.\n\nWALTER KIRN: Thank you."
