        "text": "Cormac McCarthy sat in the center of the otherwise empty Academy Awards theater, a white head like a single clover amid the rows of seats. It was 2008, and the author of Blood Meridian, Suttree, and The Road was making a vanishingly rare public appearance at the ceremony, where the film adaptation of his novel No Country for Old Men was poised to dominate. Famous for his reclusive tendencies, the author did not do interviews nor did he appear on The Tonight Show. He never walked red carpets, toured colleges on the lecture circuit, or did any of the public events that come with being one of the nation’s great writers.\n\nHe wrote elegant tragedies that at times became biblical in their sweep and intensity. Then he remained utterly quiet about them. (With few exceptions—he did a New York Times interview in 1992, a profile for this magazine in 2005, and a sit-down with Oprah Winfrey in 2007.)\n\nI first glimpsed him in the lobby before the ceremony in February 2008, just a face in the crowd gathered before the show in the three-story lobby of the (then named) Kodak Theatre, where Champagne flutes were being clinked by the beautiful and powerful in anticipation of Hollywood’s biggest night. At first, I wasn’t sure it was really him. A woman’s voice on the sound system announced that there were 45 minutes before the start of the telecast. Soon after that, I lost sight of him.\n\nMy job was to cover the goings-on backstage, to capture behind-the-scenes stories that no one sees in the theater or on television. After pacing in the wings, briefly interviewing host Jon Stewart, and making sure I didn’t miss Jack Nicholson’s annual pass-through (the previous year he showed up with a shaved head), I ducked into the main hall of the theater. I was one of the few reporters with a pass that opened pretty much all doors. At this point, everyone worth seeing was still in the lobby. The theater remained empty. A few dozen seat-fillers lined up along one aisle, getting instructions for the night from a production assistant, and some of the crew workers were checking the camera rigs near the foot of the stage.\n\nMcCarthy first appeared to be sitting by himself, but as I drew closer I saw he had a companion: his young son, John, (the inspiration, incidentally, for the survivalist father protecting his child in The Road). They had been seated about four rows from the front. One crew worker walked by and shook McCarthy’s hand, and the author seemed genuinely pleased to chat. Part of me thought I should leave him be. The New York Times, in its interview 15 years before this night, described him as a “gregarious recluse” who “has lots of friends who know that he likes to be left alone.”\n\nOn the other hand, when you are at these events as a reporter, you are constantly aware of your status as an outsider. In the glittering swirl of a setting such as the Academy Awards, you can’t help but have a little pang of squirming desperation. It’s easy to feel lonely in these crowds. McCarthy’s charming reaction to the crew worker who recognized him suggested to me that he was not shy or hostile. I didn’t think he needed company from the likes of me, but he was a human being—and one I admire—so I decided to just put away the notebook and take a chance on saying hello.\n\nI approached and said that I was a reporter, but not one who wanted to interview him. He smiled, stood up, and shook my hand. “What’s your name?” he asked, and I told him. “Bresnahan?” he asked. “Is that Irish?”\n\n“No, it’s Slovak,” I told him.\n\n“Breznican,” he repeated. “How is that spelled?”\n\nMomentarily unable to remember the order of the letters in my own name, I looked at my credential. He said, “Isn’t it interesting how it could sound so much like the Irish name Bresnahan and yet be from somewhere so far away?” I agreed that was a curious coincidence.\n\n“Is this your son?” I asked, leaning over to wave at the little boy. He reminded me of the kid from There Will Be Blood, another major contender that night. He had a round head with neatly combed hair and wise little eyes. He was around 10 then. Today he is 25.\n\n“This is John…John, this is Anthony,” McCarthy said, and I shook the child’s hand. A smile spread across his face, but he didn’t say much. McCarthy asked me which newspaper I was writing for, and I told him USA Today, gesturing back to the stage where I would spend most of the night, describing my duties in brief.\n\nI told him that I just wanted to shake his hand, to thank him for all the remarkable work and wish the both of them an enjoyable evening. He said, “It should be fun. It should be trippy,” and we both laughed.\n\n“Trippy.” It was funny to hear the great man of letters describe it that way.\n\nHe seemed fairly relaxed, so I took another chance. ”You know, I am writing about the scene here tonight, and…if you didn’t mind, could I quote you? Could I get your thoughts on all this?” If he’d said no, that he’d rather not, that would have been fine. I tried not to put the pressure on. I knew the guy’s reputation.\n\nBut McCarthy didn’t balk. He looked around and waved one arm from the stage to the lobby. “What’s there to say—I’m at the Oscars and I’m not even in the film business!” He said again that he thought it would be fun, and—knowing how stressed all the nominees had been—I said, yeah, it should.\n\nAfter all the snark and cynicism of Hollywood, it was a relief to hear some unadulterated cheerfulness for a change. I’m grateful he didn’t shoo me away, and hope he doesn’t regret chatting (or my describing the encounter here).\n\nI told him the thing that surprised me the most about the film was how similar the scenes in the movie seemed to those in the book. That the way I had pictured certain sequences were almost exactly as they appeared in the film—which means the Coens must have followed even the most subtle of descriptions from the novel.\n\nMcCarthy said, “Well, you can never put a whole book on the screen,” but said he admired the movie they made from it.\n\n“They got the heart of it,” I told him, and he nodded, saying that he was surprised anyone wanted to make the movie at all, since the book has such an unusual ending. “I’m just glad people didn’t run screaming from the theater,” he said, chuckling. I said it was the best kind of ending: one that gives you something to talk about later.\n\nWith that, I decided to cut the two fellows loose. I could have stood there and talked to him from then until the end of the three-and-a-half-hour show, grilling him about his stories, hearing the greater writer’s thoughts on his work. That, he really would have hated. And I knew that was never going to happen anyway.\n\nI wished them both a good evening and waved goodbye. Part of me wondered if it had not been a missed opportunity. So few people get to encounter him, should I not have gathered some thought or nugget from him, some insight into the mind that has so eloquently pondered the violent and cruel tendencies of our species? Where are we headed? Why are we this way? What’s next? Where did these tales originate in his synapses?\n\nBut that’s heavy business, and interesting to me, but probably not to him. Surely he would have hated it—and has said so in the past. I decided beforehand that I wasn’t going to talk to the great author, I was going to talk to a guy I respected. I only rolled the dice and asked to quote him because he ultimately did seem so friendly and happy to be there, and it seemed okay to ask. For someone whose writing explores our darkest natures, I enjoyed the opportunity to share an exchange about a happy moment. McCarthy doesn’t attend events that are held in his honor, and yet here he was at the Oscars—and he was the first one standing and clapping in honor of the Coens when they won best picture."
