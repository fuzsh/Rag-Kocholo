        "text": "Cormac McCarthy died on Tuesday, June 13, at the age of 89 at his estate in Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to his publisher. The death of this towering figure of American literature marks the end of one of the most influential writers of his time, cited as a model by novelists as diverse as Daniel Kehlmann, Junot Diaz, David Vann and Marcus Malte.\n\nThe author of a dozen novels, as well as film and TV scripts, he never sought notoriety and detested media exposure and literary circles more than anything else. Instead, he preferred the company of the scientists at the Santa Fe Institute, an independent research center in New Mexico, where he had lived since 1999, and of which he was a full member.\n\nRefusing to take part in literary festivals or book signings and reluctant to explain the content of his works on the grounds that everything there was to understand was already there, he gave few interviews, including a single televised one with Oprah Winfrey on the occasion of the publication of The Road (2006). The post-apocalyptic novel, a sort of long metaphysical poem and inspired by his conversations with his young son John, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2007.\n\nThe broadcast introduced many Americans to this reserved, soft-spoken writer with gray-green eyes, who admitted, uncomfortably to the popular host, that this tale of a father and son's odyssey through desolate landscapes was also, despite its catastrophic theme, a \"love story.\" The novel became a huge hit worldwide (48 translations and 4 million copies sold in the US alone), paving the way for a new dystopian vein in literature, cinema and even the world of video games.\n\nJust as he shunned the public sphere, McCarthy scorned any paid activity outside his writing. He systematically turned down all offers of collaboration from universities, thus deliberately cutting himself off from intermediaries and subsidies. This led to years of poverty, much to the chagrin of his wives (of whom he had three). It is reported that he lived in filthy shacks and motels, bathed in lakes, washed his clothes in laundromats and cut his own hair.\n\nFor a long time, the man who has often been compared to J. D. Salinger (1919-2010), Thomas Pynchon or Don Delillo for his legendary reserve, was only recognized by a few die-hard fans, albeit with a circle that widened from book to book, and by academics, who devoted numerous papers to him.\n\nUnfazed by his weak sales (never more than 5,000 copies for each of his first five books), fascinated as much by his harsh, poetic writing as by the darkness of his universe, they were convinced that he was one of America's great voices, on a par with Faulkner and Melville, two of his favorite authors. Far from denying their influence (\"The novel depends for its life on the novels that have been written,\" he humbly acknowledged), he shared with Faulkner a particular attention to the decadence of the American South; a virtual absence of punctuation in his sentences, including dialogue; and a narrative grounded in a landscape all his own. Like Faulkner with his Yoknapatawpha, McCarthy's recurring, almost obsessive setting was the mountainous regions of Tennessee, and later, the great desert spaces on either side of the Texas-Mexico border."
