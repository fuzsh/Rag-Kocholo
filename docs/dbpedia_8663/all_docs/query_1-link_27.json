        "text": "McCarthyâs fiction took a dark view of the human condition and was often macabre. âââThereâs no such thing as life without bloodshed,â he told The New York Times Magazine in 1992 in a rare interview. âI think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea.â\n\nFrom the start his writing drew comparisons to novelists as different as William Faulkner and Mark Twain, but his themes were always and recognizably his own: justice, despair, the futile but urgent need for hope in a fallen world."
