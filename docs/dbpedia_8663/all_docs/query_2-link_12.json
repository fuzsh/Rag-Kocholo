        "text": "Legendary writer Cormac McCarthy died at age 89, his family confirmed.\n\nThe No Country for Old Men author died of natural causes at his home in Sante Fe, New Mexcico, on Tuesday.\n\n\"Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy died today of natural causes at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico,\" a statement from publisher Knopf said.\n\nTo get the best of Irish history, culture, and folklore sent straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletter.\n\n\"He was 89 years old. His death was confirmed by his son, John McCarthy.\"\n\nThe writer was best known for penning the book on which the Oscar-winning 2007 film No Country for Old Men was based. His 2006 novel The Road also won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\nAs a critically acclaimed author, McCarthy was an icon of modern American literature. While his work may be action-packed, dystopian and all-American, McCarthy's own upbringing was typical of the Irish American experience.\n\nThe author was born Charles Joseph McCarthy in Providence, Rhode Island, to a large Catholic family. He moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, when he was four years old. He was one of six children born to Irish American parents Gladys Christina McGrail and Charles Joseph McCarthy Sr.\n\nMcCarthy's maternal grandmother is said to have emigrated from Cobh in Co Cork and married a first-generation Irish American. On his mother's side, he had an Irish grandmother and two sets of Irish great-grandparents.\n\nThe Irish heritage is harder to trace on his father's side given the popularity of the McCarthy name in both Ireland and the US. Nevertheless, the Irishness of the name he inherited from his father confirms strong Irish roots on his paternal side.\n\nMcCarthy was raised as a Catholic. He received his education at Catholic schools and was an altar boy for his local church.\n\nThough born Charles Joseph Jr, the author later went by Cormac in order to avoid confusion and comparison with the ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy. Some reports say Cormac was a nickname initially given to Charles Sr by his Irish aunts, while others claim it was to honor Gaelic chieftain Cormac MacCarthy.\n\nHis connection to the Emerald Isle goes beyond an honorable name change. In young adulthood, he first expressed an interest in visiting his ancestral homeland and tracing his heritage. He returned to Ireland several times over his lifetime.\n\nCritics claim McCarthy's writing was visibly influenced by Irish mythology and the work of Irish literary greats like William Butler Yeats and James Joyce. Irish America also has a strong presence in his work, from Appalachia to the fictional characters reportedly inspired by real-life members of the Knoxville Irish community he grew up in."
