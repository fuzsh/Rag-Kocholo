        "text": "This piece first ran in the Telegraph Magazine on April 16 1994, and has been republished following the death of Cormac McCarthy, aged 89\n\nEven before John Grady Cole and his partner Lacey Rawlins have crossed the border into Mexico you are riding by their side, the Texan sun warming your brow, the promise of adventure surging in your veins. And by the end of it all, when John Grady, true to Western myth, goes riding into the sunset, it is as if a part of you is riding off too, so that all you want to do is turn back to the beginning and start all over again, because you don’t want the adventure ever to end.\n\nBooks as good as All the Pretty Horses, which turn you inside out and take you somewhere you’ve never been before, happen along every 20 years; 10 if you’re lucky. It is a book that makes you feel glad to be alive, and which raises one nagging, insistent question. If this is one of the greatest American novels of the past 20 years, which it unquestionably is, and if Cormac McCarthy, who wrote it, is one of the greatest living American authors, then why have so few people heard of him?\n\nIn the past 30 years, McCarthy has written six novels. But until the publication of All the Pretty Horses in 1992, not one of his books had sold out its first printing in America, and only three had been published in Britain at all. When All the Pretty Horses appeared in America, among those few literary critics and academics who knew of McCarthy, the superlatives gushed like a fountain. McCarthy has been described as being in the great tradition of Faulkner, Melville and Hemingway. Saul Bellow, who sat on the panel that in 1981 awarded McCarthy a MacArthur Fellowship – the so-called ‘genius grant’ – in recognition of his work, rhapsodised about his ‘absolutely overpowering use of language, his life-giving and death-dealing sentences.’.\n\nAll the Pretty Horses, the first part of what McCarthy calls the Border Trilogy, went on to sell almost 200,000 copies in hardback, and to win the National Book Award for fiction. For a period immediately after the publication of the paperback in America, McCarthy was being outsold only by John Grisham and Michael Crichton. In this country, the book was virtually ignored on its publication in February 1993. By the end of the year, however, it had rated the highest number of commendations in the literary critics’ ‘best fiction of the year’ lists.\n\nWhat makes All the Pretty Horses so special? It is, after all, a variation on a perennial theme – a young man’s rite of passage. Sixteen-year-old John Grady Cole lights off on horseback with his best friend Lacey Rawlins, across the border into Mexico, in search of adventure. They fall foul of the law and seek refuge on a hacienda, where they work breaking horses. Grady wins the heart of a beautiful Mexican girl, then loses her again; he fights for his life in a Mexican jail, and rides back across the border, a wiser man.\n\nBut McCarthy redeems these stock motifs from cliché with a book that sings in a muscular, lyrical prose about integrity, the dawning of self-awareness and the need for moral responsibility. It also has some of the best writing about horses you will ever read. As the critic Hugh Kenner once described Moby Dick as ‘a story about how to catch a whale’, so All the Pretty Horses might at one level be described as a story about how to sweet-talk and ride a wild horse.\n\nA wonderfully eloquent, stirring, romantic book, it makes you want to saddle a horse yourself and ride across the border into Mexico. More than this, it makes you want to seek out Cormac McCarthy, shake him by the hand, and find out what sort of man could have written something as evocative and heart-felt, as heroic and powerful, as wise and affecting. Which is where the problems begin.\n\nIn the three decades that he has been writing, Cormac McCarthy can hardly be said to have helped in promoting his own career. Shortly before the publication of All the Pretty Horses, he was interviewed by the New York Times. It was the first interview he has ever given. This was done reluctantly, it was explained, as a mark of appreciation to his publishers, Alfred A. Knopf, for their years of perseverance with his work, and on the condition that he would never be asked to give another one. Ever.\n\nNor does McCarthy attend literary conferences, banquets or book-signings, or take part in any of the usual ploys and devices required to sell books. He has never taught, nor joined the lucrative gravy-train of the lecture circuit. For most of his career, he did not even have a literary agent.\n\nThis makes McCarthy unusual. Such are the requirements of publishing that nowadays writers are frequently obliged to promote themselves like film stars, whether they like it or not. With a more compliant author than McCarthy, the London publication of All the Pretty Horses would doubtless have been with a blitz of newspaper interviews, the obligatory party at the Groucho club and a Late Show special. None of this happened. Shortly before the publication of the book in Britain, Peter Straus, the publishing director of Picador, McCarthy’s British publishers, received a telephone call. It was Cormac McCarthy, calling from a public phone box.\n\nHe was in England, visiting friends, he explained, and had called to say ‘hello’. Straus was thrilled. He had visions of introducing McCarthy to key publishing and media figures, ‘But he said he wasn’t interested in that.’ McCarthy did, however, come into the office. ‘He was charm personified,’ said Straus. They talked about poetry and art. ‘‘He didn’t seem interested in talking about his own books. But he did tell me that he read Moby Dick eight times a year, and the last book he’d read was by Ron Hansen, about stigmata.’ McCarthy left, and Straus has never heard from him again.\n\nIn all of this, McCarthy might be seen to be continuing another great American tradition: the pursuit of anonymity. A previous National Book Award winner, the legendarily reclusive Thomas Pynchon, author of V and Gravity’s Rainbow, has given no interviews at all in his career, and was last sighted by a publishing executive in 1984. He reported only that Pynchon had a moustache. J. D. Salinger, author of The Catcher In The Rye, has lived in seclusion in New Hampshire since 1953, and published nothing in the last 29 years. He last gave an interview in 1980, stating that he liked movies and organic food, and wanted to be left alone.\n\nIn his novel Mao 11, about the nature of literary celebrity, Don DeLillo imagines a conversation between a famous and reclusive author and a woman photographer who has sought him out. A writer who doesn’t show his face, says the author wearily, “becomes a local symptom of God’s famous reluctance to appear... He’s playing God’s own trick.’\n\nMcCarthy’s personal recalcitrance aside, it is not hard to see why he should for so long have been American literature’s best kept secret Until All the Pretty Horses, he was hardly an easy read. His narrative style can be dense, with a Byzantine sentence structure, echoing William Faulkner and the King James Bible by turns, freighted with interminable sub-clauses, a cavalier disdain for punctuation, and a taste for recondite words: a mouth is ‘puckerstrung’; eyes ‘cold-glinting, accipitral’.\n\nHis subject matter has been no less daunting, incest and necrophilia in the Appalachian backwoods, bloodletting in the badlands of the American south-west. McCarthy’s central protagonists are invariably social outcasts, hick loners and ne’er-do-wells. Scraping a survival from the woods or the desert, they are constantly in conflict with the elements, and can often seem like outgrowths of nature itself, in its most brutish and Darwinian aspect.\n\nIn his earlier novels, McCarthy describes an America before urbanisation, immune to the tempering elements of culture, progress or mercy. Blood Meridian, his evocation of the frontier West in the 1850s, is a vision of barbarism and hell. By comparison, All the Pretty Horses, the book that finally secured McCarthy’s commercial breakthrough, seems almost wilfully sweet-tempered and populist.\n\nWhen Esquire magazine in America published an extract from All the Pretty Horses in 1992 they prefaced with a list of rumours about the author. That he lives under an oil derrick in west Texas. That he never talks. That he used to be a vagabond, roaming the decrepit back streets of Knoxville, Tennessee. That he was a truck driver, a ditchdigger. That he composes his fiction in motel rooms, walling himself in with stacks of arcane reference books. That he’s got a floor piled high with unpublished novels... ‘Apocryphal?’ it went on, ‘Who knows? Who, in the end, really cares? It’s his work that has inspired such legend-mongering. Nobody talks about bad novelists this way.’\n\nIn fact, Cormac McCarthy lives in El Paso. The short biographical note on the dust-jacket of his books tells you this much. Determined to meet him, I headed for Texas.\n\nEl Paso sits on the Rio Grande river, a stone’s throw from the Mexican city of Juarez on the other side. It is town that favours the lone wolf. In the 19th century, its close proximity to the border made it a refuge for those fleeing from the law. Cormac McCarthy has lived here for 15 years, in a state of apparently contented anonymity, maintained by his own famous reluctance to appear, and by the fierce protectiveness of his friends.\n\nWhen, in 1991, it was suggested that McCarthy should be inducted into the local El Paso Herald-Post’s Writers’ Hall of Fame, which honours local authors, there was a moment of consternation. Nobody on the newspaper had ever heard of him. The fact that a man who has been acclaimed as America’s greatest living author had been living in the town for some 15 years came as a revelation. At length, and with some difficulty, McCarthy was contacted and informed about the honour. He politely informed the Herald-Post that he wasn’t the slightest bit interested and that he would not be attending the awards dinner. His lawyer turned up to collect the plaque instead.\n\n‘Cormac’s not hermetic,’ says the New York Times writer, Richard Woodward, ‘but he wants nothing to do with the literary world or any of that stuff. He views all that with a kind of detestation.’ Woodward is the only man to have interviewed Cormac McCarthy in 30 years and is thus, for McCarthy followers, an invaluable source of information. He visited the author in El Paso shortly before the publication of All the Pretty Horses. They hung out together in restaurants, played pool and became friends. Woodward describes McCarthy as ‘a world-class talker, funny, opinionated, quick to laugh’, a man who would talk ‘about everything under the sun’. Talking to Woodward just makes you want to meet Cormac McCarthy all the more, but when I asked him how I could find McCarthy, there was a pause. ‘He lives near a shopping mall,’ Woodward said.\n\n‘Cormac’s a terrifically personable and interesting fellow,’ says Gary Fisketjon, McCarthy’s editor at Knopf in New York. ‘And he’s not reclusive in the least. Every myth needs false assumptions at its base, and Cormac’s reclusiveness is one of those.’ This sounded encouraging. So how could I find Cormac McCarthy? Fisketjon gave a strange laugh. ‘Maybe you’d better contact his agent...’\n\nI phoned New York and requested an interview. More laughter came down the line. ‘Cormac doesn’t give interviews.’\n\nI drove around El Paso. There were a lot of shopping malls.\n\nAs befits an author shy of the press and the camera, pictures of Cormac McCarthy are rare. The photograph on the jacket of All the Pretty Horses shows a handsome, square-jawed man, with a high forehead and greying hair, cropped short. He gazes squarely into the camera, no sign of diffidence.\n\nCormac is a family nickname. He was born Charles McCarthy in Rhode Island in 1933, the eldest of sue children. When he was four, the family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee. His father was a lawyer with the Tennessee Valley Authority. By comparison with most of their neighbours, the McCarthys were prosperous. McCarthy entered the University of Tennessee, but he was not a diligent student. He either dropped out or was pushed, according to rumour, and served four years in the US Air Force. He went back to university, and again dropped out. In 1961 he married Lee Holleman. They had a son, Cullen, who is now an architect, but the marriage did not work out and they quickly separated. For many years, McCarthy lost all contact with his son, although he is said to have attended his wedding in Spain two years ago.\n\nThe disturbing morbidity of both books sits somewhat uneasily with DeLisle’s description of McCarthy as ‘a very gentle, sweet, fun-loving, giving sort of man’. But there’s always two people aren’t there?’ she says. ‘When Cormac was writing he was.. in a trance almost. In another world. He used to say that just because people push these things into the background, it doesn’t mean they aren’t happening.’\n\nNot surprisingly, perhaps, neither book was a commercial success. (Atlantic Monthly published a review of Child of God under the heading, ‘Depraved’.) But McCarthy never took a job to supplement his writing. The couple scraped by on what he could muster from publishers’ advances and literary awards.\n\n‘He’s had every award known to man. And some of them twice,’ recalls DeLisle with a laugh. ‘But we never had any money. Someone would call up and offer him $2,000 to come and speak at a university about his books. And he would tell them that everything he had to say was there on the page. We were totally penniless.’ The couple lived in a dairy barn which McCarthy rebuilt himself. ‘And the work was perfect,’ says DeLisle. ‘He built one room out of hand-hewn stones – drywall; chinked it all himself. But that was Cormac. If he was going to do something, he was going to do it in the best way it had ever been done.’ She describes McCarthy as ‘a Renaissance man. He lives everything he writes. If he writes about setting traps or dismantling guns, it’s because he’s done it himself.’\n\nSomething of the circumstances of McCarthy’s life in Knoxville can be gleaned from his book Sutree, published in 1979. Cornelius Sutree is a man who has turned his back on his family, the world of commerce and learning, and lives on a crumbling houseboat on the river among a collection of drunks, misfits and petty criminals, ‘a fellowship of the doomed, where life pulsed obscenely fecund’. It was a book that contained strong echoes of McCarthy’s rejection of his own middle-class upbringing, and of a period in his life when he was drinking heavily.\n\nIt was the culmination of almost 20 years’ thinking and writing – ‘He must have rewritten it three times,’ Annie DeLisle remembers. I typed it out twice’ – but Sutree enjoyed no more success than its predecessors.\n\n‘Cormac’s not a resentful man,’ says Richard Woodward of the New York Times. ‘But I think he felt some resentment over Sutree. He’d worked so hard on that and received no attention at all. He was said to be bitter that lesser works received more attention.’\n\nMcCarthy headed West. ‘Cormac always said he would write the great Western novel,’ says DeLisle. Loading his possessions into a U-Haul trailer, he set off for Arizona, leaving Annie behind. For a while he lived in Tucson, before finally settling in El Paso – ‘as far West as he could go, and still be in the South,’ according to Woodward. DeLisle joined him there for a short time, but by then the marriage was over. She returned to Knoxville, where she remained for some years before moving to Florida.\n\nWhy, I asked, had she and McCarthy separated? ‘You’ll have to ask him that, and he’ll never tell you. He didn’t tell me.’ This was said with a note of fatalism, rather than rancour. When she thinks of McCarthy, Delisle says, ‘I just well up with love for him. I just think what a beautiful, extraordinary man he is.’\n\nMcCarthy’s ‘great Western novel’, Blood Meridian, was eventually published in 1985. It tells of the adventures of ‘the kid’ – a nameless orphan, who ‘can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless violence’. Written in a stentorian, quasi-Biblical prose, heavy with the whiff of brimstone, it is a book that strips the conquest of the West, and the American dream of manifest destiny, of any residual vestige of glamour or nobility. Death comes arbitrarily from every quarter (one critic calculated that the book averages a murder every five pages), with no hint of redemption or moral retribution.\n\nWhile notionally settled in El Paso, McCarthy led a peripatetic life, travelling frequently, living out of motel rooms. He bought the house where he now lives in 1982, but he is said still to head for the solitude of two ‘bolt-holes’ – a motel room in Texas, another across the state border in New Mexico-when he wants the peace to write. When the MacArthur Foundation voted to award him a fellowship in 1981, they finally tracked him down to a hotel in Knoxville. ‘The MacArthur award has had a big effect on Cormac,’ says the film-director Richard Pearce, who collaborated with McCarthy in 1976 on a television film called The Gardener’s Son, about a murder in South Carolina. ‘Winning that award allowed Cormac to enter a community of minds,’ says Pearce. ‘He is fantastically well read. As a Fellow he’s had years of being in contact with scientists. He’s very interested in speculative areas of science and talking about things that have nothing to do with his work as a novelist.’ Discussions with writers about writing hold no great appeal for McCarthy, adds Pearce. ‘The literary world has no interest for him. Cormac is an artist of a very confident and self-contained variety. He wouldn’t care if just two people knew about him.’\n\n‘I remember him once talking to another young writer who was asking all those questions about why and how,’ says Anne Delisle, ‘and Cormac said, “Look, unless you have to write, don’t do it.”’ She sighs. ‘Some people are just chosen, I guess.’\n\nAmong his friends, McCarthy’s craving for privacy is well known, his displeasure at those who might compromise it unforgiving. When a friend at whose wedding he had served as best man offered a few innocuous quotes about the writer to a Knoxville newspaper, McCarthy allegedly cut him dead. When Tennessee Illustrated ran a small photograph and a caption in an article entitled ‘Tennessee’s Best-Kept Secrets’, McCarthy was said to be furious. ‘It’s almost like superstition,’ his brother Dennis was quoted as saying at the time. ‘He’s afraid he’ll ruin whatever he has going. He tends to be Salingeresque.’\n\n‘El Paso is not exactly a writing mecca,’ says James Drake, a painter friend of McCarthy’s, who lives in town. ‘It’s a place where you can be left alone and get on with your work. That’s why people come here.’\n\nFor years, McCarthy lived in El Paso with nobody paying much attention, falling into an established routine: writing in the mornings, reading or visiting friends in the afternoons. But with the success of All the Pretty Horses anonymity has been harder to maintain. He has become – albeit reluctantly – a local celebrity, a subject of speculation and rumour, some of it inevitably scurrilous. ‘He lives like white trash,’ somebody told me. ‘He drinks cheap bourbon, and doesn’t pull the weeds in his yard.’ In fact, McCarthy gave up drinking years ago. But this story about his garden seemed to flourish like the weeds themselves. Somebody else told me that neighbours had actually complained to the city about the state of McCarthy’s infamous yard.\n\nThe tit-bits multiplied. Two days before I arrived in El Paso, McCarthy had been seen at a chamber music recital (Ponce, Mozart and a two-piano ‘Fantasy on Gershwin’) with a young blonde on his arm – ‘He likes ’em young.’ He played world-class pool and a good game of golf. He ate economy, and had a taste for Mexican food. He took a lively interest in Native American archaeological sites, in painting and in the workings of the car engine.\n\n‘Cormac’s a real nice, hard-working guy,’ says James Drake. ‘He has a lot of interests. In art, music, fast cars. He’s probably one of the brightest guys I’ve ever met, but I wouldn’t tell him that.’ He laughed. ‘It’d just go to his head and then he wouldn’t buy me lunch.’\n\nThe more I heard about Cormac McCarthy, the more I wanted to meet him. The closer I got, the further away he seemed.\n\n‘If you want to find Cormac,’ someone advised me, ‘look in a bookstore.’ El Paso is not blessed with a surfeit of good ones. The best bookshop for miles around was in Mesilla, 40 miles away over the state line in New Mexico. I left El Paso on Highway 10, the Franklin mountains etched out on the horizon against a clear blue sky. The road ran past a ranch, cattle penned in stock-yards as far as the eye could see.\n\nMesilla was a town that had preserved its Western flavour and dressed it for tourism. The single-storey buildings around the town square had been turned into restaurants and gift shops selling Indian jewellery. It was a Sunday, and the bookstore didn’t open until lunchtime. I sat in the square, watching worshippers spill out of church. A plaque said the Butterfield Overland mail had stopped here between 1858-61 – the forerunner to the Pony Express. Four bikers pulled up in a cloud of dust, and parked their Harleys next to the sidewalk – modern-day outlaws, hitching their horses.\n\nThe bookshop owner confirmed that McCarthy was a customer. He bought non-fiction mostly, particularly American frontier history. ‘But we haven’t seen him in quite a while. I think he must be writing. We never see him when he’s writing.’\n\nFriends and acquaintances were almost as evasive as McCarthy himself, practised, it seemed, in the art of laying smokescreens. ‘He may be about to leave El Paso,’ Richard Pearce warned me. ‘He may have already left. You never know with Cormac.’\n\nSeveral people said this. The fact that the world now knew that he lived in El Paso would be just the encouragement McCarthy needed to leave. ‘Cormac likes his peace and quiet,’ says Annie DeLisle. ‘The more he gets to be known, the more private he’ll want to be.’\n\nA photographer whom McCarthy had dated for six months refused to talk. Bobby Perle, McCarthy’s lawyer and a close friend, was polite and unforthcoming. ‘Cormac likes to be private about things. I’m not sure why, because he’s a pretty interesting guy. But I don’t think he’d appreciate my talking about him.’\n\nI made a joke about having come 5,000 miles on the off-chance. ‘You could have phoned me from London, Mick,’ said Perle with a laugh, ‘and saved yourself the air fare.’ But he promised that he would find out whether McCarthy was in town, and ask if he would meet me. Next morning, the reply was unequivocal: ‘It’s not going to happen.’ Perle didn’t explain why.\n\nThere was no listing for Cormac McCarthy in the El Paso telephone directory, but I finally discovered that he lived in Kern, a middle-class, residential neighbourhood, close by the university. I drove around, past neat, rancho-style houses set in tidy lawns, looking for a house with weeds in the yard. I found out where he ate: breakfast at The Village Inn (the best I’ve ever tasted), late lunch or dinner at Luby’s, a quiet, family restaurant, much favoured, it seemed, by El Paso’s gerontocracy. A local reporter had established that McCarthy favours ‘the Lu-Ann plate’ – an entree and two vegetables, ‘for the smaller appetite’. But Cormac McCarthy never came.\n\nPeople said he was sometimes seen in the old quarter, close by the river, playing pool or eating Mexican food. I sat in the San Jacinto Plaza, watching the buses turn and the hawkers selling trinkets from trays. Once I saw a man with cropped grey hair and wearing a beaten leather jacket, walking along the street, carrying some books under his arm. I moved to follow him. But he turned a comer and was swallowed up in the crowds. I would have to look elsewhere.\n\nAmong those who had followed Cormac McCarthy for years, the sweeter tone of All the Pretty Horses occasioned some rumblings of discontent, with accusations that he had tempered his work for a wider audience. One critic, in search of a low-alcohol metaphor, described it as ‘McCarthy lite’.\n\nI asked Gary Fisketjon at Knopf whether McCarthy had said anything to suggest that All the Pretty Horses was the book that would finally bring him commercial recognition. Fisketjon thought for a moment. ‘I think he said, “I’ll be sending it to you next week”.’\n\nThat’s all?\n\n‘That’s all. I don’t think he’s one of those authors who think of their books as children.’\n\nThe second part of the Border Trilogy, called The Crossing, tells the story of another young man, Billy Parham, who, like John Grady Cole, crosses the border into Mexico, on a mission to save a wolf. The Crossing promises to do for wolves what All the Pretty Horses did for horses, but the sweetness of the last book may be a misleading portent ‘There’s one section of the book which just causes you to walk around the room muttering for a while and thinking, “Jesus Christ...”,’ says Fisketjon. ‘It just punches you in the gut. But it’s as beautiful a piece of writing as I’ve ever read.’\n\nThe concluding part of the trilogy which, apparently, will bring the protagonists of the first two together, promises to be darker still. Richard Pearce told me that after their collaboration on The Gardener’s Son, McCarthy had written another screenplay, which Pearce described as ‘very dark, and very difficult’, and for which it had proved impossible to get financing. It is this screenplay, says Pearce, which will form the basis for the third part in the Border Trilogy.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, The Southern Quarterly, a prestigious arts journal published by the University of Mississippi, published a special edition devoted to scholarly theses on McCarthy’’s work: Blood Meridian: A Gnostic Tragedy, and The Use of the Double or Doppelganger in the works of Cormac McCarthy."
