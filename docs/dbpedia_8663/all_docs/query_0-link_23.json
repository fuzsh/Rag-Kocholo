        "text": "[on Terrence Malick, whom he admires] It's so strange; I never knew what happened to him. I saw Richard Gere in New Orleans one time, and I said, \"What ever happened to Terry Malick?\" And he said, \"Everybody asks me that.\" He said, \"I have no idea.\" But later on I met Terry. And he just - he just decided that he didn't want to live that life. Or so he told me. He just didn't want to live the life. It wasn't that he didn't like the films. It's just, if you could do it without living in Hollywood...\n\n[on All die sch√∂nen Pferde - All the Pretty Horses (2000)] It could've been better. As it stands today it could be cut and made into a pretty good movie. The director had the notion that he could put the entire book up on the screen. Well, you can't do that. You have to pick out the story that you want to tell and put that on the screen. And so he made this four-hour film and then he found that if he was actually going to get it released, he would have to cut it down to two hours. [2009]\n\n[on his novel \"Blood Meridian\" being regarded as 'unfilmable'] That's all crap. The fact that's it's a bleak and bloody story has nothing to do with whether or not you can put it on the screen. That's not the issue. The issue is it would be very difficult to do and would require someone with a bountiful imagination and a lot of balls. But the payoff could be extraordinary. [2009]"
