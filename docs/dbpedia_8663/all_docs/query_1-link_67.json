If you‚Äôll attend, let me know and I‚Äôll see you there for an evening of fun! ü•≥ https://lnkd.in/ePjMWBiH\n\n‚ÄúAs the nation has struggled to respond to mass shootings, often carried out by teenagers still living at home, focus has turned to the parents of the gunmen and whether they bear responsibility for the horrific acts of their children. That has been the question at the center of a civil trial now taking place in a small county courtroom in Galveston, along the Gulf Coast of Texas. The defendants are the parents of a 17-year-old gunman who killed eight of his classmates and two teachers at Santa Fe High School in 2018. The trial is the first such case since a jury in Michigan found the parents of a 15-year-old gunman guilty this year of involuntary manslaughter in a mass shooting that their son committed at Oxford High School outside of Detroit in 2021. Prosecutors presented evidence that the parents had ignored warning signs andfailed to lock up the handgun that they purchased for their son, which he used in the shooting. The difference in Texas is that the parents of the gunman, Antonios Pagourtzis and Rose Marie Kosmetatos, have not been accused of any crime. Instead, the case is among the first in which those victimized by a school shooting are trying to hold the gunman‚Äôs parents liable in civil court.‚Äù"
