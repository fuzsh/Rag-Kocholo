        "text": "McCarthy was an author who always wrestled with the big issues. His novels raise serious questions about life and death, the nature of evil, moral choice, the allure of violence, the passing of traditions and the future of the planet. He wrote humanely about misfits and twisted outsiders. His books, peopled by bootleggers, drug-runners, swindlers, incestuous siblings, child-killers, scalp-hunters, mass-murderers and necrophiliacs, have examined some of the very darkest deeds human beings are capable of. But McCarthy was a writer who refused to paint the world in simple binaries. His novels are often blood-soaked with bad things happening to seemingly good people and the bad, mad and dangerous to know appearing to come good in the end.\n\nAn inheritor of the grand Southern Gothic tradition in American letters and the radical re-inventor of the Western, his early novels were judged the equal of the literary giants William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. But from the outset McCarthy was an author with a voice and a vision that was uniquely his own and a writer who was determined to succeed entirely on his own terms.\n\nMcCarthy was something of a literary outlaw, eschewing the trappings of fame and the book world from the outset, refusing to grant almost any interviews, or teach or give any public talks about or readings from his novels. For years he toiled in visual obscurity, sustained by the faith in his abilities and the belief in the power of his stories to reach an audience, eventually. That faith and his continued commitment to his craft even through periods of genuine financial hardship paid off handsomely. And partly what makes McCarthy such a compelling author to read today is the refreshing lack of compromise that runs through his wide-ranging output of novels, plays and film scripts, his vision singular and his fiction writing courageous in form and in the topics it addresses.\n\nWhat is Cormac McCarthy's most recent book?\n\nSixteen years after The Road, 2022 saw the arrival of not one but two new novels from Cormac McCarthy. The paperback editions were published in September 2023.\n\nWhat is the best Cormac McCarthy book to start with?\n\nThere is no 'right' place to start with Cormac McCarthy's books, but if we had to choose one, our vote goes to All The Pretty Horses. This book captures the best of McCarthy's essence and style, providing a great introduction to the literary great. It is also the first book in his Border Trilogy, followed by The Crossing and Cities of the Plain.\n\nA guide to Cormac McCarthy's books in order\n\nCormac McCarthy's screenplays\n\nCormac McCarthy's plays"
