        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning novelist Cormac McCarthy died today at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His books often focused on loss and bloodshed, set everywhere from the American West, to the South, to a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nThroughout his long career, he wrote novels that could be bleak and violent, but that were also hailed for his beautiful prose. They were often suffused with moral ambiguity. That included some of his best-known works, such as \"No Country For Old Men,\" \"All the Pretty Horses,\" and \"The Road.\" Critics likened him to Faulkner, Hemingway, and Melville.\n\nJoining us now is writer Walter Kirn, the author of many novels, including up in the air, and he's also a literary critic himself.\n\nThank you for being with us.\n\nCormac McCarthy, as we said, was one of our greatest writers, known for his violent and bleak depictions, his sort of dark view of the human condition. But in his own way, he never really wrote an uninteresting sentence.\n\nWhat informed his approach to writing?\n\nWalter Kirn, Novelist and Critic: Well, Cormac McCarthy was kind of a hybrid of the great American novelists of the last 150 years.\n\nFor some reason, he channeled in an authentic way, not as though he were copying others, everybody, like you say, from Melville on, really. He was a very masculine novel, I think — novelist. I think that needs to be noted, though his last novel was narrated by a female character, something he'd been preparing for, for 50 years.\n\nSo he was very settled in his tradition. He had absorbed all the great writing. And, somehow, he managed to channel it in a new way, as though it came from his deepest self. It was as though he was a river that all the other rivers flowed into.\n\nWalter Kirn:\n\nOh, no, I can't claim to have reviewed all of them. But I have reviewed quite a few of them.\n\nMcCarthy wrote every genre. He wrote a great suspense novel in \"No Country For Old Men.\" He wrote a great sort of historical, almost horror novel in \"Blood Meridian,\" and he wrote a dystopian science fiction novel in \"The Road.\"\n\nAnd I think \"The Road\" is probably the novel that I think of most these days, because it dealt with war and an uncertain future and perhaps an apocalypse on the horizon for a country much like the United States. So it's a very haunting book.\n\nAnd the very end of it, I think, where he looks back at the American landscape through a clear trout stream back into the primeval pre-civilization of this content — continent, really sticks with me now."
