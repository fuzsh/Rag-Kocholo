        "text": "Cormac McCarthy, the Pulitzer Prize-winning genius behind such indelible American novels as Suttree, Blood Meridian, and The Road, along with his most accessible work, The Border Trilogy, has died in Santa Fe at age 89.\n\nToo often touted as a successor to the gothic modernism of William Faulkner, McCarthy plotted his own unique linguistic routes through the American south, from the littoral miasmas of the Tennessee River to the high shimmering dread of the western salt plains. His fictions seethed with ornate brutality, shifting in register from the biblical to the profane and back again as he superimposed American mythologies over the lowliest of American characters.\n\nFor more on McCarthy’s life, work, and legacy, read on.\n\n*\n\nRare Thoughts on Writing from Cormac McCarthy in This Unlikely Interview\n\nBeowulf Sheehan on What It Was Like to Photograph Cormac McCarthy\n\nHarold Bloom on Cormac McCarthy, True Heir to Melville and Faulkner\n\nCormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian Was Almost a Plain Old Western\n\nBlood Meridian’s 10 Most McCarthian Sentences\n\nIs Cormac McCarthy’s The Passenger a Thriller in Disguise, or Something Deeper?\n\nThe First Reviews of Every Cormac McCarthy Novel\n\nOn War, Fatherhood, and the Half-Life of Cormac McCarthy’s Literary Fission\n\nHiking Cormac McCarthy’s Western Wilderness During an Immigration Crisis"
