This study assessed the anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanolic extract obtained from Bromelia balansae fruit (EEBB) as well as the toxicological potential of this extract after single and repeated exposure. Male rats (Wistar) were gavaged with 2000â¯mg/kg of extract from the fruit of B. balansae for the acute toxicity test and with 25, 100, or 400â¯mg/kg of EEBB for the subacute toxicity test. The anti-inflammatory effect of EEBB was evaluated in vivo (30, 100, or 300â¯mg/kg) by carrageenan (Cg) induced-oedema and pleurisy in Swiss mice. A single oral dose of EEBB did not result in toxicity, demonstrating that the LD 50 of this extract was greater than 2000â¯mg/kg. In the subacute toxicity test, the tested doses produced no significant changes in the haematological, biochemical or histopathological parameters of treated animals. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in the sperm parameters. A dose of 300â¯mg/kg of EEBB significantly reduced oedema formation, Cg-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and cold sensitivity, as well as leukocyte migration in the pleurisy model. These results show that EEBB has an anti-inflammatory potential without causing acute or subacute toxicity. These data may contribute to the advancement of biopharmaceutical applications for this species. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Quebrachos are found in forests that have been exploited very intensively. The object of this work was the identification of biotic and abiotic factors specially fungal pathogen that affect the quality of both species and its relation with germination. Seeds where evaluated through germination test and the percentage of the incidence of fungal agents in two different years of harvest was determined. In S. balansae the germination rate was 77% and of 27% in 2000 and 2001 harvests, respectively. Associations fungi-germination were found in 2001 for Alternaria spp., Curvularia spp., and Fusarium spp., showing an coefficient of correlation = -0.84; -0.85 and -0.73 (p < 0.00004), respectively. A high percentage of vane seeds (55%) was also found in 2001 harvest, due to adverse environmental factors, specifically higher precipitations during flowering. In A. quebracho-blanco seeds, the germination rate was 50% and 90% in 2000 and 2003 respectively, with a 42% of immature seeds in 2000 harvest that was associated to high precipitations and high temperatures during flowering and ripping of fruits. The incidence of pathogens was low and did not have association to germination.\n\nInfusing and selecting V&V activities\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFeather, M. S.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe evolving nature of software development poses a continuing series of challenges for V&V. In response, the V&V community selectively adapts the use of existing V&V activities, and introduces new and improved ones.\n\nV&V Within Reuse-Based Software Engineering\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAddy, Edward A.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nVerification and Validation (V&V) is used to increase the level of assurance of critical software, particularly that of safety-critical and mission-critical software. V&V is a systems engineering discipline that evaluates the software in a systems context, and is currently applied during the development of a specific application system. In order to bring the effectiveness of V&V to bear within reuse-based software engineering, V&V must be incorporated within the domain engineering process.\n\nVvGONST-A and VvGONST-B are Golgi-localised GDP-sugar transporters in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.).\n\nPubMed\n\nUtz, Daniella; Handford, Michael\n\n2015-02-01\n\nPlant nucleotide-sugar transporters (NSTs) are responsible for the import of nucleotide-sugar substrates into the Golgi lumen, for subsequent use in glycosylation reactions. NSTs are specific for either GDP- or UDP-sugars, and almost all transporters studied to date have been isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana L. In order to determine the conservation of the import mechanism in other higher plant species, here we report the identification and characterisation of VvGONST-A and VvGONST-B from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Thompson Seedless), which are the orthologues of the GDP-sugar transporters GONST3 and GONST4 in Arabidopsis. Both grapevine NSTs possess the molecular features characteristic of GDP-sugar transporters, including a GDP-binding domain (GXL/VNK) towards the C-terminal. VvGONST-A and VvGONST-B expression is highest at berry setting and decreases throughout berry development and ripening. Moreover, we show using green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged versions and brefeldin A treatments, that both are localised in the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, in vitro transport assays after expression of both NSTs in tobacco leaves indicate that VvGONST-A and VvGONST-B are capable of transporting GDP-mannose and GDP-glucose, respectively, but not a range of other UDP- and GDP-sugars. The possible functions of these NSTs in glucomannan synthesis and/or glycosylation of sphingolipids are discussed. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Four main topics are addressed: 1) Program planning based on expert elicitation of the modeling physics requirements, 2) experimental design for model assessment, 3)moreÂ Â» uncertainty quantification for experimental observations and computational model simulations, and 4) assessment of the model predictive capability. The audience for this document includes program planners, modelers, experimentalist, V &V specialist, and customers of the modeling results.Â«Â less\n\nExpert system verification and validation study: ES V/V Workshop\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFrench, Scott; Hamilton, David\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe primary purpose of this document is to build a foundation for applying principles of verification and validation (V&V) of expert systems. To achieve this, some V&V as applied to conventionally implemented software is required. Part one will discuss the background of V&V from the perspective of (1) what is V&V of software and (2) V&V's role in developing software. Part one will also overview some common analysis techniques that are applied when performing V&V of software. All of these materials will be presented based on the assumption that the reader has little or no background in V&V or in developing procedural software. The primary purpose of part two is to explain the major techniques that have been developed for V&V of expert systems.\n\nAntifungal metabolites from Schinopsis balansae Engl (Anacardiaceae): isolation, identification and evidences of their mode of action on Fusarium graminearum Schwabe.\n\nPubMed\n\nAristimuÃ±o Ficoseco, MarÃ­a Eugenia; Sequin, Christian Javier; AceÃ±olaza, Pablo Gilberto; Vattuone, Marta Amelia; CatalÃ¡n, Cesar Atilio N; Sampietro, Diego Alejandro\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAn antifungal activity-directed fractionation of leaf constituents from Schinopsis balansae on Fusarium graminearum yielded a fraction mainly made of a mixture of four 3-n-heptadec(en)ylcatechols (PALK). The PALK fraction showed on macroconidia germination a MIC 100 value of 500Â Î¼g/mL which was twofold higher than that required for prothioconazole (MIC 100 Â =Â 250Â Î¼g/mL). Sublethal concentrations of PALK modify the morphogenesis in germinating macroconidia, and decreased fungal production of H 2 O 2 and deoxynivalenol biosynthesis at early fungal growth. Mixes of PALK and prothioconazole showed a synergic interaction. Our findings suggest that PALK constituents might restrict the adherence of F. graminearum to the surface of its hosts and its virulence on susceptible cereals. They deserve further research as additives of azole fungicides against F. graminearum.\n\nInterference of Nonstandard Interactions with Standard Model in {B^0} \\\\to {Ï ^0}\\\\bar vv, B_c^ - \\\\to {D^ - }\\\\bar vv and \\\\bar B_s^0 \\\\to {K^0}\\\\bar vv Decays\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahmood, Shakeel; Tahir, Farida; Mir, Azeem\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe study the contributions of nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) to the rare decays of pseudoscalar mesons involving neutrinos in the final state {B^0} \\\\to {Ï ^0}\\\\bar vv, B_c^ - \\\\to {D^ - }\\\\bar vv and \\\\bar B_s^0 \\\\to {\\\\bar K^0}\\\\bar vv, It is pointed that dominant contribution comes from the interference between standard model and nonstandard interaction We predict limits on NSIs free parameter É uL ÏÏ and compare them with experimental data.

Several plasma membrane (PM) proteins with opposing roles in powdery mildew infection, including Arabidopsis thaliana PENETRATION1 (PEN1) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO), are localized to the site of powdery mildew attack. PEN1 contributes to penetration resistance to nonadapted powdery mildews, whereas MLO is a susceptibility factor required by adapted powdery mildew pathogens for host cell entry. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the vesicle and endosomal trafficking inhibitors, brefeldin A and wortmannin, have opposite effects on the penetration rates of adapted and nonadapted powdery mildews on grapevine. These findings prompted us to study the pathogen-induced intracellular trafficking of grapevine variants of MLO and PEN1. We first identified grapevine (Vitis vinifera) VvPEN1 and VvMLO orthologs that rescue Arabidopsis Atpen1 and Atmlo2 mlo6 mlo12 null mutants, respectively. By using endomembrane trafficking inhibitors in combination with fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that VvMLO3/VvMLO4 and VvPEN1 are co-trafficked together from the PM to the site of powdery mildew challenge. This focal accumulation of VvMLO3/VvMLO4 and VvPEN1 to the site of attack seems to be required for their opposing functions during powdery mildew attack, because their subcellular localization is correlated with the outcome of attempted powdery mildew penetration.\n\nGibberellin application at pre-bloom in grapevines down-regulates the expressions of VvIAA9 and VvARF7, negative regulators of fruit set initiation, during parthenocarpic fruit development.\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, Chan Jin; Hur, Youn Young; Yu, Hee-Ju; Noh, Jung-Ho; Park, Kyo-Sun; Lee, Hee Jae\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFruit set is initiated only after fertilization and is tightly regulated primarily by gibberellins (GAs) and auxins. The application of either of these hormones induces parthenocarpy, fruit set without fertilization, but the molecular mechanism underlying this induction is poorly understood. In the present study, we have shown that the parthenocarpic fruits induced by GA application at pre-bloom result from the interaction of GA with auxin signaling. The transcriptional levels of the putative negative regulators of fruit set initiation, including Vitis auxin/indole-3-acetic acid transcription factor 9 (VvIAA9), Vitis auxin response factor 7 (VvARF7), and VvARF8 were monitored during inflorescence development in seeded diploid 'Tamnara' grapevines with or without GA application. Without GA application, VvIAA9, VvARF7, and VvARF8 were expressed at a relatively high level before full bloom, but decreased thereafter following pollination. After GA application at 14 days before full bloom (DBF); however, the expression levels of VvIAA9 and VvARF7 declined at 5 DBF prior to pollination. The effects of GA application on auxin levels or auxin signaling were also analyzed by monitoring the expression patterns of auxin biosynthesis genes and auxin-responsive genes with or without GA application. Transcription levels of the auxin biosynthesis genes Vitis anthranilate synthase Î² subunit (VvASB1-like), Vitis YUCCA2 (VvYUC2), and VvYUC6 were not significantly changed by GA application. However, the expressions of Vitis Gretchen Hagen3.2 (VvGH3.2) and VvGH3.3, auxin-responsive genes, were up-regulated from 2 DBF to full bloom with GA application. Furthermore, the Vitis GA signaling gene, VvDELLA was up-regulated by GA application during 12 DBF to 7 DBF, prior to down-regulation of VvIAA9 and VvARF7. These results suggest that VvIAA9 and VvARF7 are negative regulators of fruit set initiation in grapevines, and GA signaling is integrated with auxin signaling via VvDELLA during\n\nGibberellin Application at Pre-Bloom in Grapevines Down-Regulates the Expressions of VvIAA9 and VvARF7, Negative Regulators of Fruit Set Initiation, during Parthenocarpic Fruit Development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJung, Chan Jin; Hur, Youn Young; Yu, Hee-Ju; Noh, Jung-Ho; Park, Kyo-Sun; Lee, Hee Jae\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFruit set is initiated only after fertilization and is tightly regulated primarily by gibberellins (GAs) and auxins.

Lately, the performance of some of these systems is enhanced by embedded adaptive components in order to cope with environmental changes. Although the ability of adapting is appealing, it actually poses a problem in terms of V&V. Since uncertainties induced by environmental changes have a significant impact on system behavior, the applicability of conventional V&V techniques is limited. In safety-critical applications such as flight control system, the mechanisms of change must be observed, diagnosed, accommodated and well understood prior to deployment. In this paper, we propose a non-conventional V&V approach suitable for online adaptive systems. We apply our approach to an intelligent flight control system that employs a particular type of Neural Networks (NN) as the adaptive learning paradigm. Presented methodology consists of a novelty detection technique and online stability monitoring tools. The novelty detection technique is based on Support Vector Data Description that detects novel (abnormal) data patterns. The Online Stability Monitoring tools based on Lyapunov's Stability Theory detect unstable learning behavior in neural networks. Cases studies based on a high fidelity simulator of NASA's Intelligent Flight Control System demonstrate a successful application of the presented V&V methodology. ,\n\nThe Need for V&V in Reuse-Based Software Engineering\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAddy, Edward A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nV&V is currently performed during application development for many systems, especially safety-critical and mission-critical systems. The V&V process is intended to discover errors, especially errors related to entire' domain or product line rather than a critical processing, as early as possible during the development process. The system application provides the context under which the software artifacts are validated. engineering. This paper describes a framework that extends V&V from an individual application system to a product line of systems that are developed within an architecture-based software engineering environment. This framework includes the activities of traditional application-level V&V, and extends these activities into the transition between domain engineering and application engineering. The framework includes descriptions of the types of activities to be performed during each of the life-cycle phases, and provides motivation for activities.\n\nOn É-mechanism driven pulsations in VV 47\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSowicka, Paulina; Handler, Gerald; Jones, David\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe report new observations of the central star of the planetary nebula VV 47 carried out to verify earlier assertions that the short-period pulsation modes detected in the star are driven by the É mechanism. In our data, VV 47 was not variable up to a limit of 0.52 mmag in the Fourier amplitude spectrum up to the Nyquist frequency of 21.7 mHz. Given this null result we re-analyzed the data set in which oscillations were claimed. After careful data reduction, photometry, extinction correction, and analysis with a conservative criterion of S/N â¥ 4 in the Fourier amplitude spectrum, we found that the star was not variable during the original observations. The oscillations reported earlier were due to an over-optimistic detection criterion. We conclude that VV 47 did not pulsate during any measurements at hand; the observational detection of É-driven pulsations remains arduous.\n\nSilencing of grapevine pectate lyase-like genes VvPLL2 and VvPLL3 confers resistance against Erysiphe necator and differentially modulates gene expression\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nBroad-spectrum resistance against powdery mildew (PM) has been reported by silencing susceptibility genes in the model plant Arabidopsis.

The V&V process is intended to discover errors, especially errors related to critical processing, as early as possible during the development process. Early discovery is important in order to minimize the cost and other impacts of correcting these errors. In order to provide early detection of errors, V&V is conducted in parallel with system development, often beginning with the concept phase. In reuse-based software engineering, however, decisions on the requirements, design and even implementation of domain assets can be made prior to beginning development of a specific system. In this case, V&V must be performed during domain engineering in order to have an impact on system development. This paper describes a framework for performing V&V within architecture-centric, reuse-based software engineering. This framework includes the activities of traditional application-level V&V, and extends these activities into domain engineering and into the transition between domain engineering and application engineering. The framework includes descriptions of the types of activities to be performed during each of the life-cycle phases, and provides motivation for the activities.\n\nV&V of Fault Management: Challenges and Successes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFesq, Lorraine M.; Costello, Ken; Ohi, Don; Lu, Tiffany; Newhouse, Marilyn\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the results of a special breakout session of the NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Workshop held in the fall of 2012 entitled \"V&V of Fault Management: Challenges and Successes.\" The NASA IV&V Program is in a unique position to interact with projects across all of the NASA development domains. Using this unique opportunity, the IV&V program convened a breakout session to enable IV&V teams to share their challenges and successes with respect to the V&V of Fault Management (FM) architectures and software. The presentations and discussions provided practical examples of pitfalls encountered while performing V&V of FM including the lack of consistent designs for implementing faults monitors and the fact that FM information is not centralized but scattered among many diverse project artifacts. The discussions also solidified the need for an early commitment to developing FM in parallel with the spacecraft systems as well as clearly defining FM terminology within a project.\n\nExtended mid-infrared emission from VV 114: Probing the birth of a ULIRG\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe Floc'h, E.; Charmandaris, V.; Laurent, O.; Mirabel, I. F.; Gallais, P.; Sauvage, M.; Vigroux, L.; Cesarsky, C.\n\n2002-08-01\n\nWe present our 5-16 mu m spectro-imaging observations of VV 114, an infrared luminous early-stage merger of two galaxies VV 114E and VV 114W, taken with the ISOCAM camera on-board the Infrared Space Observatory. We find that only 40% of the mid-infrared (MIR) flux is associated with a compact nuclear region of VV 114E, while the rest of the emission originates from a rather diffuse component extended over several kpc in the regions between VV 114E and VV 114W. This is in stark contrast with the very compact MIR starbursts usually seen in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies. A secondary peak of MIR emission is associated with an extra-nuclear star forming region of VV 114W which displays the largest HÎ± equivalent width in the whole system. Comparing our data with the distribution of the molecular gas and cold dust, as well as with radio observations, it becomes evident that the conversion of molecular gas into stars can be triggered over large areas at the very first stages of an interaction. This extended star formation along with the extreme nuclear starburst observed in VV 114E can easily lead to the heating of dust grains found in the tidally disturbed disks of the progenitor galaxies and subsequently traced via their MIR emission. The presence of a very strong continuum at the 5-6.5 mu m range in the spectrum of VV 114E indicates that an enshrouded active galactic nucleus (AGN) may contribute to ~ 40% of its MIR flux. We finally note that the relative variations in the UV to radio spectral properties between VV 114E and VV 114W provide evidence that the extinction-corrected star formation rate of similar objects at high z, such as those detected in optical deep surveys, cannot be accurately derived from their rest-frame UV properties. Based on observations with the ISO satellite, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and with the participation\n\nDetailed Chemical Composition of Condensed Tannins via Quantitative (31)P NMR and HSQC Analyses: Acacia catechu, Schinopsis balansae, and Acacia mearnsii.\n\nPubMed\n\nCrestini, Claudia; Lange, Heiko; Bianchetti, Giulia\n\n2016-09-23\n\nThe chemical composition of Acacia catechu, Schinopsis balansae, and Acacia mearnsii proanthocyanidins has been determined using a novel analytical approach that rests on the concerted use of quantitative (31)P NMR and two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. This approach has offered significant detailed information regarding the structure and purity of these complex and often elusive proanthocyanidins. More specifically, rings A, B, and C of their flavan-3-ol units show well-defined and resolved absorbance regions in both the quantitative (31)P NMR and HSQC spectra. By integrating each of these regions in the (31)P NMR spectra, it is possible to identify the oxygenation patterns of the flavan-3-ol units. At the same time it is possible to acquire a fingerprint of the proanthocyanidin sample and evaluate its purity via the HSQC information. This analytical approach is suitable for both the purified natural product proanthocyanidins and their commercial analogues. Overall, this effort demonstrates the power of the concerted use of these two NMR techniques for the structural elucidation of natural products containing labile hydroxy protons and a carbon framework that can be traced out via HSQC.\n\nAutonomy Software: V&V Challenges and Characteristics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchumann, Johann; Visser, Willem\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe successful operation of unmanned air vehicles requires software with a high degree of autonomy. Only if high level functions can be carried out without human control and intervention, complex missions in a changing and potentially unknown environment can be carried out successfully. Autonomy software is highly mission and safety critical: failures, caused by flaws in the software cannot only jeopardize the mission, but could also endanger human life (e.g., a crash of an UAV in a densely populated area). Due to its large size, high complexity, and use of specialized algorithms (planner, constraint-solver, etc.), autonomy software poses specific challenges for its verification, validation, and certification. -- - we have carried out a survey among researchers aid scientists at NASA to study these issues. In this paper, we will present major results of this study, discussing the broad spectrum. of notions and characteristics of autonomy software and its challenges for design and development. A main focus of this survey was to evaluate verification and validation (V&V) issues and challenges, compared to the development of \"traditional\" safety-critical software. We will discuss important issues in V&V of autonomous software and advanced V&V tools which can help to mitigate software risks. Results of this survey will help to identify and understand safety concerns in autonomy software and will lead to improved strategies for mitigation of these risks.\n\nVEGA Launch Vehicle: VV02 Flight Campaign Thermal Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoroni, D.; Perugini, P.; Mancini, R.; Bonnet, M.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nA reliable tool for the prediction of temperature trends vs. time during the operative timeline of a launcher represents one of the key elements for the qualification of a launch vehicle itself.The correct evaluation of the thermal behaviour during the mission, both for the launcher elements (structures, electronic items, tanks, motors...) and for the Payloads carried by the same Launcher, is one of the preliminary activities to be performed before a flight campaign.For such scope AVIO constructed a Thermal Mathematical Model (TMM) by means of the ESA software \"ESATAN Thermal Modelling Suite (TMS)\" [1] used for the prediction of the temperature trends both on VV01 (VEGA LV Qualification Flight) and VV02 (First VEGA LV commercial flight) with successfully results in terms of post-flight comparison with the sensor data outputs.Aim of this paper is to show the correlation obtained by AVIO VEGA LV SYS TMM in the frame of VV02 Flight.\n\nGene Cloning, Expression and Enzyme Activity of Vitis vinifera Vacuolar Processing Enzymes (VvVPEs)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGong, Peijie; Li, Shuxiu; Wang, Yuejin; Zhang, Chaohong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nVacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) have received considerable attention due to their caspase-1-like activity and ability to regulate programmed cell death (PCD), which plays an essential role in the development of stenospermocarpic seedless grapes ovules. To characterize VPEs and the relationship between stenospermocarpic grapes and the VPE gene family, we identified 3 Vitis vinifera VPE genes (VvÎ²VPE, VvÎ³VPE, and VvÎ´VPE) from the PN40024 grape genome and cloned the full-length complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from the âVitis vinifera cv. Pinot Noirâ and âVitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedlessâ varietals. Each of the VPEs contained a typical catalytic dyad [His (177), Cys (219)] and substrate binding pocket [Arg (112), Arg (389), Ser (395)], except that Ser (395) in the VvÎ³VPE protein sequence was replaced with alanine. Phylogenetic analysis of 4 Arabidopsis thaliana and 6 Vitis vinifera VPEs revealed that the 10 VPEs form 3 major branches. Furthermore, the 6 grapevine VPEs share a similar gene structure, with 9 exons and 8 introns. The 6 grapevine VPEs are located on 3 different chromosomes. We also tested the enzymatic activity of recombinant VPEs expressed in the Pichia Pastoris expression system and found that the VvVPEs exhibit cysteine peptidase activity. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that VvÎ´VPE is only expressed in flowers, buds and ovules, that VvÎ³VPE is expressed in various tissues, and that VvÎ²VPE was expressed in roots, flowers, buds and ovules. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) suggested that VvÎ²VPE in seeded grapes increased significantly at 30 days after full-bloom (DAF), close to the timing of endosperm abortion at 32 DAF. These results suggested that VvÎ²VPE is related to ovule abortion in seedless grapes. Our experiments provide a new perspective for understanding the mechanism of stenospermocarpic seedlessness and represent a useful reference for the further study of VPEs.

Previous studies highlighted a key regulatory role for grapevine 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase 1 (VvDXS1), the first enzyme of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis. Here, the parallel analysis of VvDXS1 genotype and terpene concentration in a germplasm collection demonstrated that VvDXS1 sequence has a very high predictive value for the accumulation of monoterpenes and also has an influence on sesquiterpene levels. A metabolic engineering approach was applied by expressing distinct VvDXS1 alleles in the grapevine model system \"microvine\" and assessing the effects on downstream pathways at transcriptional and metabolic level in different organs and fruit developmental stages. The underlying goal was to investigate two potential perturbation mechanisms, the former based on a significant over-expression of the wild-type (neutral) VvDXS1 allele and the latter on the ex-novo expression of an enzyme with increased catalytic efficiency from the mutated (muscat) VvDXS1 allele. The integration of the two VvDXS1 alleles in distinct microvine lines was found to alter the expression of several terpenoid biosynthetic genes, as assayed through an ad hoc developed TaqMan array based on cDNA libraries of four aromatic cultivars. In particular, enhanced transcription of monoterpene, sesquiterpene and carotenoid pathway genes was observed. The accumulation of monoterpenes in ripe berries was higher in the transformed microvines compared to control plants. This effect is predominantly attributed to the improved activity of the VvDXS1 enzyme coded by the muscat allele, whereas the up-regulation of VvDXS1 plays a secondary role in the increase of monoterpenes.\n\nCase Studies for Enhancing Student Engagement and Active Learning in Software V&V Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nManohar, Priyadarshan A.; Acharya, Sushil; Wu, Peter; Hansen, Mary; Ansari, Ali; Schilling, Walter\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTwo critical problems facing the software (S/W) industry today are the lack of appreciation of the full benefits that can be derived from Software Verification and Validation (V&V) and an associated problem of shortage of adequately trained V&V practitioners.

E.; Privon, G. C.; KÃ¶nig, S.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nContext. The galaxy NGC 4418 harbours a compact (<20 pc) core with a very high bolometric luminosity ( 1011Lâ). As most of the galaxy energy output comes from this small region, it is of interest to determine what fuels this intense activity. An interaction with the nearby blue irregular galaxy VV 655 has been proposed, where gas acquired by NGC 4418 could trigger intense star formation and/or black hole accretion in the centre. Aims: We aim to constrain the interaction hypothesis by studying neutral hydrogen structures that could reveal tails and debris connecting NGC 4418 to the nearby galaxy VV 655. Methods: We present observations at 1.4 GHz with the Very Large Array (VLA) of the radio continuum as well as emission and absorption from atomic hydrogen. Gaussian distributions are fitted to observed HI emission and absorption spectra. We estimate the star formation rates (SFRs) of NGC 4418 and VV 655 from the 1.4 GHz radio emission and compare them with estimates from archival 70 Î¼m Herschel observations. Results: An atomic HI bridge is seen in emission, connecting NGC 4418 to the nearby galaxy VV 655. An HI tail is also seen extending south-west from VV 655. While NGC 4418 is bright in continuum emission and seen in HI absorption, VV 655 is barely detected in the continuum, but shows bright HI emission (MHI 109 Mâ). We estimate SFRs from the 1.4 GHz continuum of 3.2 Mâ yr-1 and 0.13 Mâ yr-1 for NGC 4418 and VV 655, respectively. Systemic HI velocities of 2202 Â± 20 km s-1 (emission) and 2105.4 Â± 10 km s-1 (absorption) are measured for VV 655 and NGC 4418, respectively. Redshifted HI absorption is seen (vc = 2194.0 Â± 4.4 km s-1) towards NGC 4418, suggesting gas infall. North-west of NGC 4418, we detect HI in emission, blueshifted (vc = 2061.9 Â± 5.1 km s-1) with respect to NGC 4418, consistent with an outflow perpendicular to the galaxy disk. We derive a deprojected outflow speed of 178 km s-1, which, assuming a simple cylindrical model, gives an order\n\nRecovery of V(V) from complex vanadium solution using capacitive deionization (CDI) with resin/carbon composite electrode.\n\nPubMed\n\nBao, Shenxu; Duan, Jihua; Zhang, Yimin\n\n2018-05-25\n\nThe resin-activated carbon composite (RAC) electrodes were fabricated and applied in capacitive deionization for recovery of V(V) from complex vanadium solution. The adsorption capacity of the RAC electrode for V(V) is extremely low and the reduction of V(V) is significant in low pH solution, but the adsorbed V(V) on the electrode increases obviously and the reduction of V(V) gradually diminishes with the rise of pH. However, as the pH is increased to 10, the adsorbed V(V) on the RAC electrode declines. The higher applied potential is beneficial to the adsorption of V(V) and 1.0â¯V is appropriate for the adsorption. The impurities ions (Al, P and Si) are mainly adsorbed in the electric double layers on the RAC electrode and V(V) is dominantly adsorbed by the resins in the electrode. The adsorbed impurity ions can be easily removed by diluted H 2 SO 4 and V(V) can be effectively eluted by 10% NaOH solution. The vanadium-bearing eluent can be recycled to recover and enrich vanadium from the complex solution. The performance of the RAC electrode keeps stable during the cyclic operation. This study may provide a promising and novel method for the recovery and separation of metals from aqueous solution. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n[Professor V.V.

Calcium is an essential plant nutrient with important regulatory and structural roles in the berries of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). On the other hand, the proton-cation exchanger CAX proteins have been shown to impact Ca 2+ homeostasis with important consequences for fruit integrity and resistance to biotic/abiotic stress. Here, the CAX gene found in transcriptomic databases as having one of the highest expressions in grapevine tissues, VvCAX3, was cloned and functionally characterized. Heterologous expression in yeast showed that a truncated version of VvCAX3 lacking its NNR autoinhibitory domain (sCAX3) restored the ability of the yeast strain to grow in 100-200Â mM Ca 2+ , demonstrating a role in Ca 2+ transport. The truncated VvCAX3 was further shown to be involved in the transport of Na + , Li + , Mn 2+ and Cu 2+ in yeast cells. Subcellular localization studies using fluorescently tagged proteins confirmed VvCAX3 as a tonoplast transporter. VvCAX3 is expressed in grapevine stems, leaves, roots, and berries, especially at pea size, decreasing gradually throughout development, in parallel with the pattern of calcium accumulation in the fruit. The transcript abundance of VvCAX3 was shown to be regulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), Ca 2+ , and Na + in grape cell suspensions, and the VvCAX3 promotor contains several predicted cis-acting elements related to developmental and stress response processes. As a whole, the results obtained add new insights on the mechanisms involved in calcium homeostasis and intracellular compartmentation in grapevine, and indicate that VvCAX3 may be an interesting target towards the development of strategies for enhancement of grape berry properties.\n\nThe grape berry-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor VvCEB1 affects cell size.\n\nPubMed\n\nNicolas, Philippe; Lecourieux, David; GomÃ¨s, Eric; Delrot, Serge; Lecourieux, Fatma\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe development of fleshy fruits involves complex physiological and biochemical changes. After fertilization, fruit growth usually begins with cell division, continues with both cell division and expansion, allowing fruit set to occur, and ends with cell expansion only. In spite of the economical importance of grapevine, the molecular mechanisms controlling berry growth are not fully understood. The present work identified and characterized Vitis vinifera cell elongation bHLH protein (VvCEB1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor controlling cell expansion in grape. VvCEB1 was expressed specifically in berry-expanding tissues with a maximum around veraison. The study of VvCEB1 promoter activity in tomato confirmed its specific fruit expression during the expansion phase. Overexpression of VvCEB1 in grape embryos showed that this protein stimulates cell expansion and affects the expression of genes involved in cell expansion, including genes of auxin metabolism and signalling. Taken together, these data show that VvCEB1 is a fruit-specific bHLH transcription factor involved in grape berry development.\n\nThe grape berry-specific basic helixâloopâhelix transcription factor VvCEB1 affects cell size\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLecourieux, Fatma\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe development of fleshy fruits involves complex physiological and biochemical changes.

Acetate supported highest maximum power density of 589.1mW/m(2), with highest V(V) removal efficiency of 77.6% during 12h operation, compared with glucose, citrate and soluble starch. Exorbitant initial V(V) concentration led to lower V(V) removal efficiencies and power outputs. Extra addition of organics had little effect on the improvement of MFCs performance. V(V) reduction and bioelectricity generation were enhanced and then suppressed by the increase of conductivity. The larger the external resistance, the higher the V(V) removal efficiencies and voltage outputs. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis implied the accumulation of Enterobacter which had the capabilities of V(V) reduction, electrochemical activity and fermentation, accompanied with other functional species as Pseudomonas, Spirochaeta, Sedimentibacter and Dysgonomonas. This study steps forward to remediate V(V) contaminated environment based on MFC technology. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They are produced through a multistep pathway that is controlled by MYB transcription factors. VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 activate anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and are nonfunctional in white grapevine cultivars. In this study, transgenic grapevines with altered VvMYBA gene expression were developed, and transcript analysis was carried out on berries using a microarray technique. The results showed that VvMYBA is a positive regulator of the later stages of anthocyanin synthesis, modification, and transport in cv Shiraz. One up-regulated gene, ANTHOCYANIN 3-O-GLUCOSIDE-6â³-O-ACYLTRANSFERASE (Vv3AT), encodes a BAHD acyltransferase protein (named after the first letter of the first four characterized proteins: BEAT [for acetyl CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase], AHCT [for anthocyanin O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase], HCBT [for anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase], and DAT [for deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase]), belonging to a clade separate from most anthocyanin acyltransferases. Functional studies (in planta and in vitro) show that Vv3AT has a broad anthocyanin substrate specificity and can also utilize both aliphatic and aromatic acyl donors, a novel activity for this enzyme family found in nature. In cv Pinot Noir, a red-berried grapevine mutant lacking acylated anthocyanins, Vv3AT contains a nonsense mutation encoding a truncated protein that lacks two motifs required for BAHD protein activity. Promoter activation assays confirm that Vv3AT transcription is activated by VvMYBA1, which adds to the current understanding of the regulation of the BAHD gene family. The flexibility of Vv3AT to use both classes of acyl donors will be useful in the engineering of anthocyanins in planta or in vitro.

In addition, we have obtained simultaneous ground-based optical photometric observations of VV Pup during part of the FUV observation. The shapes of the FUV and optical light curves are consistent with each other and with those of past observations at optical, extreme-ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths. Time-resolved FUV spectra during the portion of VV Pup's orbit when the accreting magnetic pole of the white dwarf can be seen show an increasing continuum level as the accretion spot becomes more directly visible. The most prominent features in the spectrum are the O VI Î»Î»1031.9, 1037.6 emission lines. We interpret the shape and velocity shift of these lines in the context of an origin in the accretion funnel near the white dwarf surface. A blackbody function with Tbb>~90,000 K provides an adequate fit to the FUV spectral energy distribution of VV Pup.

The P-8A Poseidon Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) Program Modeling and Simulation Accreditation Strategy documents the P-8A program's approach to VV&A. The P-8A strategy tailors a risk-based approach and leverages existing bodies of knowledge, such as the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office Recommended Practice Guide (DMSO RPG), to make the process practical and efficient. As the program progresses, the M&S team must continue to look for ways to streamline the process, add supplemental steps to enhance the process, and identify and overcome procedural, organizational, and cultural challenges.

We identify 26 stable structures out of 54 2D V-V compounds based on various assessments of stabilities: total energy, thermodynamics, and mechanics. Among them, 12 2D V-V compounds are previously unrecognized structures. For each class V-V isomer, the most stable structures are found to be Î²-AsP, Î²-SbAs, Î±-BiAs, Î±-BiSb, Î± 2-SbP, and Î± 2-BiP. For all isomers of the AsP, they are always stable, and hence PAs monolayer is most likely to be prepared experimentally. All the stable structures are semiconductors with bandgaps ranging from 0.06 eV to 2.52 eV at the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof level. Therefore, they are potential materials for versatile semiconductor devices. Our findings provide a new clue to facilitate the design of 2D materials for potential applications.\n\nThe vacuolar channel VvALMT9 mediates malate and tartrate accumulation in berries of Vitis vinifera.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Angeli, Alexis; Baetz, Ulrike; Francisco, Rita; Zhang, Jingbo; Chaves, Maria Manuela; Regalado, Ana\n\n2013-08-01\n\nVitis vinifera L. represents an economically important fruit species. Grape and wine flavour is made from a complex set of compounds. The acidity of berries is a major parameter in determining grape berry quality for wine making and fruit consumption. Despite the importance of malic and tartaric acid (TA) storage and transport for grape berry acidity, no vacuolar transporter for malate or tartrate has been identified so far. Some members of the aluminium-activated malate transporter (ALMT) anion channel family from Arabidopsis thaliana have been shown to be involved in mediating malate fluxes across the tonoplast. Therefore, we hypothesised that a homologue of these channels could have a similar role in V. vinifera grape berries. We identified homologues of the Arabidopsis vacuolar anion channel AtALMT9 through a TBLASTX search on the V. vinifera genome database. We cloned the closest homologue of AtALMT9 from grape berry cDNA and designated it VvALMT9. The expression profile revealed that VvALMT9 is constitutively expressed in berry mesocarp tissue and that its transcription level increases during fruit maturation. Moreover, we found that VvALMT9 is targeted to the vacuolar membrane. Using patch-clamp analysis, we could show that, besides malate, VvALMT9 mediates tartrate currents which are higher than in its Arabidopsis homologue. In summary, in the present study we provide evidence that VvALMT9 is a vacuolar malate channel expressed in grape berries. Interestingly, in V. vinifera, a tartrate-producing plant, the permeability of the channel is apparently adjusted to TA.\n\nValidation and Verification (V&V) of Safety-Critical Systems Operating Under Off-Nominal Conditions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBelcastro, Christine M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLoss of control (LOC) remains one of the largest contributors to aircraft fatal accidents worldwide. Aircraft LOC accidents are highly complex in that they can result from numerous causal and contributing factors acting alone or more often in combination. Hence, there is no single intervention strategy to prevent these accidents. Research is underway at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the development of advanced onboard system technologies for preventing or recovering from loss of vehicle control and for assuring safe operation under off-nominal conditions associated with aircraft LOC accidents. The transition of these technologies into the commercial fleet will require their extensive validation and verification (V&V) and ultimate certification. The V&V of complex integrated systems poses highly significant technical challenges and is the subject of a parallel research effort at NASA. This chapter summarizes the V&V problem and presents a proposed process that could be applied to complex integrated safety-critical systems developed for preventing aircraft LOC accidents. A summary of recent research accomplishments in this effort is referenced.\n\nAbsolute properties of the eclipsing binary VV CORVI\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFekel, Francis C.; Henry, Gregory W.; Sowell, James R., E-mail: fekel@evans.tsuniv.edu, E-mail: gregory.w.henry@gmail.com, E-mail: jim.sowell@physics.gatech.edu\n\n2013-12-01\n\nWe have obtained red-wavelength spectroscopy and Johnson B and V differential photoelectric photometry of the eclipsing binary VV Crv = HR 4821. The system is the secondary of the common proper motion double star ADS 8627, which has a separation of 5.''2. VV Crv has an orbital period of 3.144536 days and a low but non-zero eccentricity of 0.085. With the Wilson-Devinney program we have determined a simultaneous solution of our spectroscopic and photometric observations. Those orbital elements produce masses of M {sub 1} = 1.978 Â± 0.010 M {sub â} and M {sub 2} = 1.513 Â± 0.008 MmoreÂ Â» {sub â}, and radii of R {sub 1} = 3.375 Â± 0.010 R {sub â} and R {sub 2} = 1.650 Â± 0.008 R {sub â} for the primary and secondary, respectively. The effective temperatures of the two components are 6500 K (fixed) and 6638 K, so the star we call the primary is the more massive but cooler and larger component. A comparison with evolutionary tracks indicates that the components are metal rich with [Fe/H] = 0.3, and the system has an age of 1.2 Gyr. The primary is near the end of its main-sequence lifetime and is rotating significantly faster than its pseudosynchronous velocity. The secondary is still well ensconced on the main sequence and is rotating more slowly than its pseudosynchronous rate.Â«Â less\n\nThe Role of Independent V&V in Upstream Software Development Processes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEasterbrook, Steve\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the role of Verification and Validation (V&V) during the requirements and high level design processes, and in particular the role of Independent V&V (IV&V). The job of IV&V during these phases is to ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent and valid, and to ensure that the high level design meets the requirements. This contrasts with the role of Quality Assurance (QA), which ensures that appropriate standards and process models are defined and applied. This paper describes the current state of practice for IV&V, concentrating on the process model used in NASA projects. We describe a case study, showing the processes by which problem reporting and tracking takes place, and how IV&V feeds into decision making by the development team. We then describe the problems faced in implementing IV&V. We conclude that despite a well defined process model, and tools to support it, IV&V is still beset by communication and coordination problems.\n\nEmerging technologies for V&V of ISHM software for space exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFeather, Martin S.; Markosian, Lawrence Z.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSystems1,2 required to exhibit high operational reliability often rely on some form of fault protection to recognize and respond to faults, preventing faults' escalation to catastrophic failures. Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) extends the functionality of fault protection to both scale to more complex systems (and systems of systems), and to maintain capability rather than just avert catastrophe. Forms of ISHM have been utilized to good effect in the maintenance phase of systems' total lifecycles (often referred to as 'condition-based mainte-nance'), but less so in a 'fault protection' role during actual operations. One of the impediments to such use lies in the challenges of verification, validation and certification of ISHM systems themselves. This paper makes the case that state-of-the-practice V&V and certification techniques will not suffice for emerging forms of ISHM systems; however, a number of maturing software engineering assurance technologies show particular promise for addressing these ISHM V&V challenges.\n\nThe Grapevine VvPMEI1 Gene Encodes a Novel Functional Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Associated to Grape Berry Development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLionetti, Vincenzo; Raiola, Alessandro; Mattei, Benedetta; Bellincampi, Daniela\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPectin is secreted in a highly methylesterified form and partially de-methylesterified in the cell wall by pectin methylesterases (PMEs). PME activity is expressed during plant growth, development and stress responses. PME activity is controlled at the post-transcriptional level by proteins named PME inhibitors (PMEIs). We have identified, expressed and characterized VvPMEI1, a functional PME inhibitor of Vitis vinifera. VvPMEI1 typically affects the activity of plant PMEs and is inactive against microbial PMEs. The kinetics of PMEI-PME interaction, studied by surface plasmon resonance, indicates that the inhibitor strongly interacts with PME at apoplastic pH while the stability of the complex is reduced by increasing the pH. The analysis of VvPMEI1 expression in different grapevine tissues and during grape fruit development suggests that this inhibitor controls PME activity mainly during the earlier phase of berry development. A proteomic analysis performed at this stage indicates a PME isoform as possible target of VvPMEI1.

Thirty-two patients with heart failure (six females, ages 68 +/- 7.8 years) had a CRT device implanted. After implantation of the atrial, right and a left ventricular lead, the optimal V-V interval was calculated using the QuickOpt formula (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) applied to the respective IEGM recordings (V-V(IEGM)), and also determined by invasive measurement of LVdP/dt(MAX) (V-V(dP/dt)). The optimal V-V(IEGM) and V-V(dP/dt) intervals were 52.7 +/- 18 ms and 24.0 +/- 33 ms, respectively (P = 0.017), without correlation between the two. The baseline LVdP/dt(MAX) was 748 +/- 191 mmHg/s. The mean value of LVdP/dt(MAX) at invasive optimization was 947 +/- 198 mmHg/s, and at the calculated optimal V-V(IEGM) interval 920 +/- 191 mmHg/s (P < 0.0001). In spite of this significant difference, there was a good correlation between both methods (R = 0.991, P < 0.0001). However, a similarly good correlation existed between the maximum value of LVdP/dt(MAX) and LVdP/dt(MAX) at a fixed V-V interval of 0 ms (R = 0.993, P < 0.0001), or LVdP/dt(MAX) at a randomly selected V-V interval between 0 and +80 ms (R = 0.991, P < 0.0001). Optimizing the V-V interval with the IEGM method does not yield better hemodynamic results than simultaneous BiV pacing. Although a good correlation between LVdP/dt(MAX) determined with V-V(IEGM) and V-V(dP/dt) can be constructed, there is no correlation with the optimal settings of V-V interval in the individual patient.\n\nNEAMS SOFTWARE V&V PLAN FOR THE MARMOT SOFTWARE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMichael R Tonks\n\n2014-03-01\n\nIn order to ensure the accuracy and quality of the microstructure based materials models being developed in conjunction with MARMOT simulations, MARMOT must undergo exhaustive verification and validation. Only after this process can we confidently rely on the MARMOT code to predict the microstructure evolution within the fuel. Therefore, in this report we lay out a V&V plan for the MARMOT code, highlighting where existing data could be used and where new data is required.\n\nGenetic characterization of bank vole virus (BaVV), a new paramyxovirus isolated from kidneys of bank voles in Russia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlkhovsky, Sergey; Butenko, Alexander; Eremyan, Aykaz; Shchetinin, Alexey\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA genome of bank vole virus (BaVV), isolated from kidney tissues of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in Russia in 1973, was sequenced. The genomic organization of BaVV (3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-G-L-5', 16,992 nt in length; GenBank accession number MF943130) is most similar to that of Mossman virus (MoV) and Nariva virus (NarPV), two ungrouped paramyxoviruses isolated from rodents in Australia and Trinidad, respectively. The proteins of BaVV have the highest level of sequence identity (ranging from 23-28% for G protein to 66-73% for M protein) to proteins of MoV and NarPV. The results of genetic and phylogenetic analysis suggest that BaVV represents a new species and, together with MoV and NarPV, belongs to a new, yet not established genus of the family Paramyxoviridae.\n\nRight Ventricle Dysfunction and Pre Implantation Vasopressors in Refractory ARDS Supported by VV-ECMO.\n\nPubMed\n\nLazzeri, Chiara; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Cianchi, Giovanni; Batacchi, Stefano; Guetti, Cristiana; Cozzolino, Morena; Bernardo, Pasquale; Peris, Adriano\n\n2017-10-31\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be frequently associated with haemodynamic instability requiring the use of vasopressors. To date, there is still some uncertainty in the use of veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in haemodynamically unstable ARDS patients. We therefore assessed whether patients receiving pre ECMO vasopressors had a worse prognosis and, furthermore, we reviewed the factors associated with the use of pre ECMO vasopressors in 92 consecutive patients with refractory ARDS treated with VV-ECMO. All patients were submitted to an echocardiogram before implantation. In our series, 55 patients (59.7%) were given a vasopressor. Septic shock is the main cause of vasopressor requirement (45.5%). When compared with patients without vasopressors, the subgroup under vasopressors showed a significantly higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (p=0.040), a lower pH (p=0.013), lower pO2 values (p=0.030) and higher lactate levels (p=0.024). A higher incidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and of biventricular dysfunction were observed in patients under vasopressors (p=0.018 and p=0.036, respectively). The intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate was 43.4% (40/92) with no difference between the two subgroups. In refractory ARDS requiring VV-ECMO infusion of vasopressors is needed in a high proportion of patients, who did not exhibit a worse prognosis when compared to haemodynamically stable patients. Pre ECMO echocardiography helps in characterising these patients since they showed a higher incidence of RV (and biventricular) dysfunction. According to our data, in ARDS patients refractory to conventional treatment, haemodynamic instability should not be considered a contraindication to VV-ECMO support.

For example, the longitudinal polarization fractions RL of the B0â(D*+s,D*+,Ï+)D*- and B+â(D*+s,D*+,Ï+)Ï0 modes increase as the masses of the mesons D*+s,D*+,Ï+ emitted from the weak vertex decrease. The subleading finite-mass or finite-energy corrections modify these simple estimates only slightly. Our predictions for the BâD*(s)D* polarization fractions derived in the perturbative QCD framework, especially RLË1 for B0âDÂ¯*0D*0 governed by nonfactorizable W-exchange amplitudes, can be confronted with future data. For penguin-dominated modes, such as BâÏ(Ï)K*, the polarization fractions can be understood by the annihilation effect from the (S-P)(S+P) operators, plus the interference with a small tree amplitude. At last, we comment on the various mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain the abnormal BâÏK* polarization data, none of which are satisfactory.\n\nEffects on fibrinogen, fibrin, and blood coagulation of proteolytic extracts from fruits of Pseudananas macrodontes, Bromelia balansae, and B. hieronymi (Bromeliaceae) in comparison with bromelain.\n\nPubMed\n\nErrasti, MarÃ­a E; Prospitti, Anabela; Viana, Carolina A; Gonzalez, Mariana M; Ramos, MÃ¡rcio V; Rotelli, Alejandra E; Caffini, NÃ©stor O\n\n2016-06-01\n\nExtracts rich in cysteine proteases obtained from fruits of Pseudananas macrodontes (Pm), Bromelia balansae (Bb), and B. hieronymi (Bh) have previously shown an anti-inflammatory effect on animal models. Given the close relationship between hemostasis and inflammation, it is attractive to investigate therapeutic agents capable of modulating both systems. The aim of this work was to study the effect of Pm, Bb, and Bh on fibrin(ogen) and blood coagulation compared with stem bromelain (Bro). Action on fibrinogen was electrophoretically and spectrophotometrically evaluated, fibrinolytic activity was measured both electrophoretically and by the fibrin plate assay, and the effect on blood coagulation was studied by conventional coagulation tests (PT and APPT). All extracts showed the same proteolytic preference for fibrinogen subunits, that is AÎ±â>âBÎ², whereas Î³ was partially hydrolyzed by 100-fold concentration increase. Unlike Bro, cysteine proteases of Pm, Bb, and Bh increased absorbance at 540ânm of fibrinogen solution, suggesting thrombin-like activity, which was time-dependent and reached maximum values at lower concentration. All extracts showed the same proteolytic preference for fibrin subunits; however Pm, Bb, and Bh showed lower fibrinolytic activity than Bro at the assayed concentrations. Although Bb acted only as anticoagulant, Pm, Bh, and unexpectedly Bro showed dual action on blood coagulation: at low concentration showed procoagulant effect and at high concentration anticoagulant effect. Results reveal new plant species as potential sources of pharmacological agents for the treatment of a wide range of hemostatic disorders as well as to wound healing.\n\nMolecular, genetic and transcriptional evidence for a role of VvAGL11 in stenospermocarpic seedlessness in grapevine\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Stenospermocarpy is a mechanism through which certain genotypes of Vitis vinifera L. such as Sultanina produce berries with seeds reduced in size. Stenospermocarpy has not yet been characterized at the molecular level. Results Genetic and physical maps were integrated with the public genomic sequence of Vitis vinifera L. to improve QTL analysis for seedlessness and berry size in experimental progeny derived from a cross of two seedless genotypes. Major QTLs co-positioning for both traits on chromosome 18 defined a 92-kb confidence interval. Functional information from model species including Vitis suggested that VvAGL11, included in this confidence interval, might be the main positional candidate gene responsible for seed and berry development. Characterization of VvAGL11 at the sequence level in the experimental progeny identified several SNPs and INDELs in both regulatory and coding regions. In association analyses performed over three seasons, these SNPs and INDELs explained up to 78% and 44% of the phenotypic variation in seed and berry weight, respectively. Moreover, genetic experiments indicated that the regulatory region has a larger effect on the phenotype than the coding region. Transcriptional analysis lent additional support to the putative role of VvAGL11's regulatory region, as its expression is abolished in seedless genotypes at key stages of seed development. These results transform VvAGL11 into a functional candidate gene for further analyses based on genetic transformation. For breeding purposes, intragenic markers were tested individually for marker assisted selection, and the best markers were those closest to the transcription start site. Conclusion We propose that VvAGL11 is the major functional candidate gene for seedlessness, and we provide experimental evidence suggesting that the seedless phenotype might be caused by variations in its promoter region. Current knowledge of the function of its orthologous genes, its expression\n\nThe R2R3MYB VvMYBPA1 from grape reprograms the phenylpropanoid pathway in tobacco flowers.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasseri, Valentina; Martens, Stefan; Carvalho, Elisabete; Bianchet, Chantal; Damiani, Francesco; Paolocci, Francesco\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis work shows that, in tobacco, the ectopic expression of VvMYBPA1 , a grape regulator of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, up- or down-regulates different branches of the phenylproanoid pathway, in a structure-specific fashion. Proanthocyanidins are flavonoids of paramount importance for animal and human diet. Research interest increasingly tilts towards generating crops enriched with these health-promoting compounds. Flavonoids synthesis is regulated by the MBW transcriptional complex, made of R2R3MYB, bHLH and WD40 proteins, with the MYB components liable for channeling the complex towards specific branches of the pathway. Hence, using tobacco as a model, here, we tested if the ectopic expression of the proanthocyanidin regulator VvMYBPA1 from grape induces the biosynthesis of these compounds in not-naturally committed cells. Here, we show, via targeted transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of primary transgenic lines and their progeny, that VvMYBPA1 alters the phenylpropanoid pathway in tobacco floral organs, in a structure-specific fashion. We also report that a modest VvMYBPA1 expression is sufficient to induce the expression of both proanthocyanidin-specific and early genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Consequently, proanthocyanidins and chlorogenic acids are induced or de novo synthetised in floral limbs, tubes and stamens. Other phenylpropanoid branches are conversely induced or depleted according to the floral structure. Our study documents a novel and distinct function of VvMYBPA1 with respect to other MYBs regulating proanthocyanidins. Present findings may have major implications in designing strategies for enriching crops with health-promoting compounds.\n\nQuestions Addressed to V.V.

These peptides were functionally characterized as full agonists with unique specificity albeit low affinity for hBRS-3 compared to other bombesin receptors. VV-H-7 and LVV-H-7 induced a dose-dependent response in hBRS-3 overexpressing CHO cells, as well as in NCI-N417 cells expressing the hBRS-3 endogenously. The affinity of VV-H-7 was higher in NCI-N417 cells compared to overexpressing CHO cells. In detail, the EC50 values were 45Â±15 Î¼M for VV-H-7 and 183Â±60 Î¼M for LVV-H-7 in CHO cells, and 19Â±6 Î¼M for VV-H-7 and 38Â±18 Î¼M for LVV-H-7 in NCI-N417 cells. Other hemorphins had no effect. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB) showed similar EC50 values of 13â20 Î¼M (GRP) and of 1â2 Î¼M (NMB) on both cell lines. Structure-function analysis revealed that both the N-terminal valine and the C-terminal phenylalanine residues of VV-H-7 are critical for the ligand-receptor interaction. Endogenous hBRS-3 in NCI-N417 activated by VV-H-7 couples to phospholipase C resulting in changes of intracellular calcium, which is initially released from an inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive store followed by a capacitive calcium entry from extracellular space. VV-H-7-induced hBRS-3 activation led to phosphorylation of p42/p44-MAP kinase in NCI-N417 cells, but did not stimulate cell proliferation. In contrast, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) was not observed.

We used this approach to evaluate internal validity of three VV optimization methods by three criteria. Twenty patients (16 men, age 75 Â± 7) in AF were optimized, at two paced heart rates, by LVOT VTI (flow), non-invasive arterial pressure, and ECG (minimizing QRS duration). Each optimization method was evaluated for: singularity (unique peak of function), reproducibility of optimum, and biological plausibility of the distribution of optima. The reproducibility (standard deviation of the difference, SDD) of the optimal VV delay was 10 ms for pressure, versus 8 ms (p=ns) for QRS and 34 ms (p<0.01) for flow. Singularity of optimum was 85% for pressure, 63% for ECG and 45% for flow (Chi(2)=10.9, p<0.005). The distribution of pressure optima was biologically plausible, with 80% LV pre-excited (p=0.007). The distributions of ECG (55% LV pre-excitation) and flow (45% LV pre-excitation) optima were no different to random (p=ns). The pressure-derived optimal VV delay is unaffected by the paced rate: SDD between slow and fast heart rate is 9 ms, no different from the reproducibility SDD at both heart rates. Using non-invasive arterial pressure, VV delay optimization by parabolic fitting is achievable with good precision, satisfying all 3 criteria of internal validity. VV optimum is unaffected by heart rate. Neither QRS minimization nor LVOT VTI satisfy all validity criteria, and therefore seem weaker candidate modalities for VV optimization. AF, unlinking interventricular from atrioventricular delay, uniquely exposes resynchronization concepts to experimental scrutiny. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It also contains several examples of results using the models at energies below 150 MeV, down to 10 MeV, where data libraries are normally used. This report can be considered as the forth part of a set of MCNP6 Testing Primers, after its first, LA-UR-11-05129, and second, LA-UR-11-05627, and third, LA-UR-26944, publications, but is devoted to V&V with the latest, 1.1 beta version of MCNP6. The MCNP6moreÂ Â» test-problems discussed here are presented in the /VALIDATION_CEM/and/VALIDATION_LAQGSM/subdirectories in the MCNP6/Testing/directory. README files that contain short descriptions of every input file, the experiment, the quantity of interest that the experiment measures and its description in the MCNP6 output files, and the publication reference of that experiment are presented for every test problem. Templates for plotting the corresponding results with xmgrace as well as pdf files with figures representing the final results of our V&V efforts are presented. Several technical âbugsâ in MCNP 6.1.1 beta were discovered during our current V&V of MCNP6 while running it in parallel with MPI using its event generators. These âbugsâ are to be fixed in the following version of MCNP6. Our results show that MCNP 6.1.1 beta using its CEM03.03, LAQGSM03.03, Bertini, and INCL+ABLA, event generators describes, as a rule, reasonably well different intermediate- and high-energy measured data.

However, the process requires considerable time of expert staff. The BRAVO study is a non-inferiority trial comparing echocardiographic optimization of atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delay with an alternative method using non-invasive blood pressure monitoring that can be automated to consume less staff resources. BRAVO is a multi-centre, randomized, cross-over, non-inferiority trial of 400 patients with a previously implanted cardiac resynchronization device. Patients are randomly allocated to six months in each arm. In the echocardiographic arm, AV delay is optimized using the iterative method and VV delay by maximizing LVOT VTI. In the haemodynamic arm AV and VV delay are optimized using non-invasive blood pressure measured using finger photoplethysmography. At the end of each six month arm, patients undergo the primary outcome measure of objective exercise capacity, quantified as peak oxygen uptake (VO2) on a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Secondary outcome measures are echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular remodelling, quality of life score and N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro BNP). The study is scheduled to complete recruitment in December 2013 and to complete follow up in December 2014. If exercise capacity is non-inferior with haemodynamic optimization compared with echocardiographic optimization, it would be proof of concept that haemodynamic optimization is an acceptable alternative which has the potential to be more easily implemented.

Expression of VvPIP2;4N in Xenopus laevis oocytes increased their swelling rate 54-fold. Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that VvPIP2;4N is the most expressed PIP2 gene in root. In situ hybridization confirmed root localization in the cortical parenchyma and close to the endodermis. We then constitutively overexpressed VvPIP2;4N in grape 'Brachetto', and in the resulting transgenic plants we analyzed (1) the expression of endogenous and transgenic VvPIP2;4N and of four other aquaporins, (2) whole-plant, root, and leaf ecophysiological parameters, and (3) leaf abscisic acid content. Expression of transgenic VvPIP2;4N inhibited neither the expression of the endogenous gene nor that of other PIP aquaporins in both root and leaf. Under well-watered conditions, transgenic plants showed higher stomatal conductance, gas exchange, and shoot growth. The expression level of VvPIP2;4N (endogenous + transgene) was inversely correlated to root hydraulic resistance. The leaf component of total plant hydraulic resistance was low and unaffected by overexpression of VvPIP2;4N. Upon water stress, the overexpression of VvPIP2;4N induced a surge in leaf abscisic acid content and a decrease in stomatal conductance and leaf gas exchange. Our results show that aquaporin-mediated modifications of root hydraulics play a substantial role in the regulation of water flow in well-watered grapevine plants, while they have a minor role upon drought, probably because other signals, such as abscisic acid, take over the control of water flow.\n\nIsolation and characterization of a Vitis vinifera transcription factor, VvWRKY1, and its effect on responses to fungal pathogens in transgenic tobacco plants.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarchive, ChloÃ©; Mzid, Rim; Deluc, Laurent; Barrieu, FranÃ§ois; Pirrello, Julien; Gauthier, Adrien; Corio-Costet, Marie-France; Regad, Farid; Cailleteau, Bernard; Hamdi, SaÃ¯d; Lauvergeat, Virginie\n\n2007-01-01\n\nPathogen attack represents a major problem for viticulture and for agriculture in general. At present, the use of phytochemicals is more and more restrictive, and therefore it is becoming essential to control disease by having a thorough knowledge of resistance mechanisms. The present work focused on the trans-regulatory proteins potentially involved in the control of the plant defence response, the WRKY proteins. A full-length cDNA, designated VvWRKY1, was isolated from a grape berry library (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon). It encodes a polypeptide of 151 amino acids whose structure is characteristic of group IIc WRKY proteins. VvWRKY1 gene expression in grape is regulated in a developmental manner in berries and leaves and by various signal molecules involved in defence such as salicylic acid, ethylene, and hydrogen peroxide. Biochemical analysis indicates that VvWRKY1 specifically interacts with the W-box in various nucleotidic contexts. Functional analysis of VvWRKY1 was performed by overexpression in tobacco, and transgenic plants exhibited reduced susceptibility to various fungi but not to viruses. These results are consistent with a possible role for VvWRKY1 in grapevine defence against fungal pathogens.\n\nThe grapevine VvWRKY2 gene enhances salt and osmotic stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum.\n\nPubMed\n\nMzid, Rim; Zorrig, Walid; Ben Ayed, Rayda; Ben Hamed, Karim; Ayadi, Mariem; Damak, Yosra; Lauvergeat, Virginie; Hanana, Mohsen\n\n2018-06-01\n\nOur study aims to assess the implication of WRKY transcription factor in the molecular mechanisms of grapevine adaptation to salt and water stresses. In this respect, a full-length VvWRKY2 cDNA, isolated from a Vitis vinifera grape berry cDNA library, was constitutively over-expressed in Nicotiana tabacum seedlings. Our results showed that transgenic tobacco plants exhibited higher seed germination rates and better growth, under both salt and osmotic stress treatments, when compared to wild type plants. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrated that, under stress conditions, transgenic plants accumulated more osmolytes, such as soluble sugars and free proline, while no changes were observed regarding electrolyte leakage, H 2 O 2 , and malondialdehyde contents. The improvement of osmotic adjustment may be an important mechanism underlying the role of VvWRKY 2 in promoting tolerance and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Principal component analysis of our results highlighted a clear partition of plant response to stress. On the other hand, we observed a significant adaptation behaviour response for transgenic lines under stress. Taken together, all our findings suggest that over-expression of VvWRKY2 gene has a compelling role in abiotic stress tolerance and, therefore, would provide a useful strategy to promote abiotic stress tolerance in grape via molecular-assisted breeding and/or new biotechnology tools.\n\nCharacterization of a putative grapevine Zn transporter, VvZIP3, suggests its involvement in early reproductive development in Vitis vinifera L\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Zinc (Zn) deficiency is one of the most widespread mineral nutritional problems that affect normal development in plants. Because Zn cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes, it must be transported into intracellular compartments for all biological processes where Zn is required. Several members of the Zinc-regulated transporters, Iron-regulated transporter-like Protein (ZIP) gene family have been characterized in plants, and have shown to be involved in metal uptake and transport. This study describes the first putative Zn transporter in grapevine. Unravelling its function may explain an important symptom of Zn deficiency in grapevines, which is the production of clusters with fewer and usually smaller berries than normal. Results We identified and characterized a putative Zn transporter from berries of Vitis vinifera L., named VvZIP3. Compared to other members of the ZIP family identified in the Vitis vinifera L. genome, VvZIP3 is mainly expressed in reproductive tissue - specifically in developing flowers - which correlates with the high Zn accumulation in these organs. Contrary to this, the low expression of VvZIP3 in parthenocarpic berries shows a relationship with the lower Zn accumulation in this tissue than in normal seeded berries where its expression is induced by Zn. The predicted protein sequence indicates strong similarity with several members of the ZIP family from Arabidopsis thaliana and other species. Moreover, VvZIP3 complemented the growth defect of a yeast Zn-uptake mutant, ZHY3, and is localized in the plasma membrane of plant cells, suggesting that VvZIP3 has the function of a Zn uptake transporter. Conclusions Our results suggest that VvZIP3 encodes a putative plasma membrane Zn transporter protein member of the ZIP gene family that might play a role in Zn uptake and distribution during the early reproductive development in Vitis vinifera L., indicating that the availability of this micronutrient may be relevant for\n\nCharacterization of a putative grapevine Zn transporter, VvZIP3"
