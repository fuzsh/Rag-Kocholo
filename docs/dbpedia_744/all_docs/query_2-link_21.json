        "text": "The province of Fermo has ancient origins dating back to when it was one of the ancient capitals of the Picini people. During the middle ages it was well established and very powerful.\n\nThe province is served by Aeroporto di Ancona-Falconara in Ancona. Aeroporto di Ancona-Falconara (AOI) is located in Falconara Marittima to the west of Ancona and is around 50km from the town of Fermo. This airport is also known as Aeroporto Raffaello Sanzio. Website\n\nThe nearest ferry port is Ancona, around 50km from the town of Fermo. The port, one of the main ports on the Adriatic Sea, is located near the centre of Ancona and is a busy passenger port with ferries running to Greece, Turkey, Croatia, Albania and Montenegro. It has good facilities with a caf√©, shop, restrooms and both short and long term car parks. Website\n\nTrains running to Fermo from major Italian cities usually require a change of train in Ancona.\n\nThe main road serving Fermo, along with the rest of the region of Le Marche, is the A14 motorway (Autostrada A14 or Autostrada Adriatica).This motorway runs between the cities of Bologna and Taranto, mostly hugging the Adriatic coastline. The A14 motorway is 743.4 km in length and mainly consists of two lanes, three in parts of the north and has many hills, tunnels and bridges.\n\nFermo is the capital of the province of Fermo and is an ideal town centre for those wanting a holiday which is off the beaten track. The town sits on top of a hill and provides a wonderful panorama of the surrounding countryside and the river Tenna. The town is old and has a wonderful array of examples of its fascinating history with the remains of its cyclopean walls and many interesting examples of architecture.\n\nUnderneath the town is an intricate system of well-preserved Roman cisterns (le cisterne Romane) dating back to around 40 AD. They were built to conserve and purify the water for the people of the town and are considered to be one of the finest examples of their kind in Italy. These cisterns are located underneath Via Paccarone near Chiesa di San Domenico but the entrance is difficult to find due to the building of houses.\n\nDuomo di Fermo (Fermo cathedral) which is made of Istrian stone and has a Gothic facade was reconstructed in 1227. It has many interesting features and a collection of items inside including a chasuble which belonged to Thomas Becket who was murdered in Canterbury (UK) in 1170."
