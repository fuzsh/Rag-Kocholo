Discovering historical ancient villages “… The emotion that you can get from one of these seldom visited places is even stronger than the magic aroused by a celebrated place. It’s here that we can ﬁnd again those sounds, scents and perspectives of a past, that have been clouded in our memory. Mostly, it’s in these villages, in these often abandoned places, where we ﬁnd ourselves again.” Tonino Guerra
