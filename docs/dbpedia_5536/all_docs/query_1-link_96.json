        "text": "GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador &\n\nMaria Esther de Capovilla, the oldest person on Earth according to Guinness World Records, was laid to rest yesterday in a simple ceremony after dying from pneumonia at the age of 116.\n\nCapovilla died Sunday in a hospital in the coastal city of Guayaquil two days after getting sick, said her granddaughter Catherine Capovilla. She was interred in a family tomb in a marble-columned mausoleum within the city limits.\n\nBorn on Sept. 14, 1889 &\n\nthe same year as Charlie Chaplin and Adolf Hitler &\n\nCapovilla traced her lineage to Spanish nobility, but enjoyed drinking donkey milk in her youth. She was married in 1917 to an Austrian sailor who visited Ecuador, and was widowed in 1949.\n\nShortly before she died, she kept repeating, \"I want to be young again\" and at times called to a dead daughter, asking her \"to come, take me with you,\" another granddaughter Cecilia Icaza said.\n\nRobert Young, senior consultant for Gerontology for Guinness World Records, said Elizabeth Bolden, of Memphis, Tenn., is the likely successor as the oldest person.\n\n\"Guinness World Records will have to make an official announcement from London,\" he said. \"For all practical purposes, the next oldest person is going to be presumed to be Elizabeth Bolden. She is 116, but she was born 11 months after Capovilla.\"\n\nSponsor Ad\n\nDate of Publication August 29, 2006 on Page A02"
