        "text": "The Queen of Soul, the man who first broke the four-minute mile, a Hollywood legend, children's TV favourites and one of the greatest scientists of all time - here's remembering the stars and notable faces we have said goodbye to in 2018.\n\nJanuary\n\n'Fast' Eddie Clarke\n\nFormer Motorhead guitarist Fast Eddie (pictured left) was the last surviving original member of the band, after the deaths of frontman Lemmy and drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor in 2015.\n\nHe passed away peacefully in hospital after being treated for pneumonia.\n\n\"Keep roaring, rocking and rollin' up there as goddamit man, your Motorfamily would expect nothing less!\" his remaining band members said in their tribute.\n\nDolores O'Riordan\n\nThe Cranberries singer, who joined the Irish rock band in 1990, helped them become a household name, with hits including Dreams, Linger and Zombie.\n\nShe was found dead at a hotel in central London, aged 46, having drowned as a result of alcohol intoxication.\n\nHer boyfriend Ole Koretsky paid tribute to the love of his life, saying: \"The energy she continues to radiate is undeniable.\"\n\nMark E Smith\n\nBorn in Salford in March 1957, Mark E Smith wrote music in his lunch breaks while working on the Manchester docks as a shipping clerk.\n\nAfter attending a Sex Pistols gig in 1976, he quit the docks for The Fall, and their first two albums were released three years later.\n\nHe said he decided to pursue music because \"whatever I did would have to be better than most of the so-called punk s***e I was hearing at the time\".\n\nHe died aged 60, after The Fall were forced to cancel a string of shows in 2017 because of his health.\n\nCyrille Regis\n\nAlongside Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson, former West Brom and England striker Cyrille Regis was part of the \"Three Degrees\" trio and played an integral role in the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues.\n\nHe made 614 league appearances and scored 158 league goals during his 19-year professional playing career.\n\nThe Professional Footballers' Association announced his death at the age of 59, with reports saying he had suffered a heart attack.\n\nFebruary\n\nEmma Chambers\n\nThe British actress was best known for her roles in TV comedy The Vicar Of Dibley, starring alongside Dawn French, and the Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts film Notting Hill.\n\n\"I loved her. A lot,\" said French following her death.\n\nJohn Mahoney\n\nThe actor played one of TV show Frasier's most beloved characters, portraying Frasier and Nile Crane's cranky father Martin for 11 years.\n\nThe role earned him legions of fans and a Screen Actors Guild award, as well as two Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations.\n\nTitle star Kelsey Grammar led the tributes to his co-star, saying: \"He was my father. I loved him.\"\n\nMarch\n\nStephen Hawking\n\nGiven just two years to live when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21, Stephen Hawking went on to become one of the most renowned scientists of all time, and lived until he was 76.\n\n\"A Brief History of Time\" was published in 1988 and entered the Guinness Book of Records after staying on The Sunday Times bestseller list for 237 weeks.\n\nThe book sold 10m copies and was translated into 40 different languages, but is famously referred to as one of the \"greatest unread books in history\".\n\nAs well as his incredible mind, Professor Hawking was known for his humour and wit, using his illness to help others believe that anything is possible.\n\nRead some of his best quotes here.\n\nBill Maynard\n\nHe played small parts in several Carry On films, and took on the title role in Oh No, It's Selwyn Froggitt! in the 1970s, but Bill Maynard was best known as Heartbeat's lovable rogue Claude Greengrass.\n\nThe actor, whose real name was Walter Williams (his stage name a reference to the makers of Wine Gums) died in hospital at the age of 89, after breaking his hip in a fall from his mobility scooter.\n\nJim Bowen\n\n\"You can't beat a bit of bully!\" Jim Bowen, presenter of cult darts gameshow Bullseye, was known for his catchphrases.\n\nThe show, which ran between 1981 and 1995, was watched by more than 12 million viewers, and made him a household name.\n\nHe died with his wife Phyllis by his side after being ill for several weeks. Read Bullseye commentator Tony Green's tribute here.\n\nSir Ken Dodd\n\nMaster of tickling sticks Ken Dodd died just days after leaving hospital and marrying his partner of 40 years, Anne Jones. The comedy legend, who was 90, died in the same house in Liverpool that he grew up in.\n\nFamed for his quickfire one-liners, you can read some of his best here.\n\nSir Roger Bannister\n\nThe record-breaking Roger Bannister ran the world's first ever sub-four minute mile in Oxford in May 1954.\n\nWhen announcer Norris McWhirter declared \"the time was three...\" the crowd cheered so loudly his exact time was not heard.\n\nHe died peacefully, surrounded by his family, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011.\n\nApril\n\nVerne Troyer\n\nBest known for his role as the evil Mini Me in the Austin Powers series, Verne Troyer also featured in films such as Harry Potter, and Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus.\n\nHis cause of death was not disclosed at the time, but the star struggled with alcoholism and had been admitted to hospital and placed on \"involuntary psychiatric hold\" in the days before he passed away.\n\nAvicii\n\nSwedish DJ Avicii, real name Tim Bergling, was best known for singles Wake Me Up, Hey Brother and Levels.
