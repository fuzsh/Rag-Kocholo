        "text": "2023\n\nDemand for tickets this year was the highest ever and were all sold within hours! People came dressed to boogie and so did our celebrity guests which included: Tim Matheson (Animal House, West Wing & Virgin River), Corbin Bernsen (LA Law, Major League), Chris Knight (Brady Bunch), Ian Ziering (90210), Deney Terrio (Dance Fever) & Joe & Melissa Gorga (RHONJ). Our musical guest “The Sugarhill Gang” sang their hit “Rappers Delight” which was the first rap song to ever chart on the Billboard Top 40 list. After this past year’s event our donation total is 7.9 million and we look forward to seeing everyone at this year’s event on Nov 30th, 2024!\n\n2022\n\nWe were back to full capacity & had our fastest sellout ever! Dance floor was packed with lots of great outfits. This years celebrity guests included; Marilu Henner (Taxi), Kristy McNichol (Family), Jill Zarin (Real Housewives of NY), Kyle Viljoen & Aesha Scott (Below Deck), Deney Terrio (Dance Fever). Musical Guest Evelyn Champagne King performed her smash hits “Love Come Down” & “Shame”. We’ve reached over 7.3 million donated to charity and looking forward to celebrating our 30th anniversary on Nov 25th, 2023!\n\n2021\n\n2021 brought us back together in person for the first time since 2019. There were a lot of changes in restrictions and policies for large events but we pulled it off. General admission tickets sold out on the first day of sales and the VIP party sold out in just over an hour. Guests included George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) , Sandy Yawn, Ben Robinson, Kate Chastain (from Bravo TV’s # 1 show “Below Deck”), Deney Terrio (“Dance Fever”), and musical guest Rose Royce who performed their hit song “Car Wash” . Donation total is now over 6.8 million !\n\n2020\n\nThe 2020 edition of the Disco was virtual and included our first ever commemorative T-shirt . The virtual event was a bit hit with over 10,000 WLD fans logging on to watch 4 hours of videos and pictures we’ve taken since 1979. We sold over 1400 T-shirts and with the backing of our fans and corporate sponsors we raised over $100,000 during a pretty tough time.\n\n2019\n\nOne of the fastest sellouts ever, thank you! This year’s guests included: John Schneider (Dukes of Hazzard), Joyce DeWitt (Three’s Company), Mindy Cohn (Facts of Life), Deney Terrio (Dance Fever) along with Dolores Cantania & Margaret Josephs (Real Housewives of NJ). Musical Guests were Anita Ward (Ring my Bell) & The Hues Corporation (Rock the Boat). Proud to announce that we surpassed 6M in donations and look forward to seeing everyone on Nov 28th, 2020!\n\n2018\n\n25 years of Disco in Buffalo, THANK YOU!! We had our usual sold out crowd of over 7000 who were joined by our celebrity guests: Barry Williams, Chris Knight , Mike Lookinland , Susan Olsen and Geri Reischl (Greg, Peter, Bobby, Cindy and Fake Jan) from the Brady Bunch, Howard Hesseman (Dr Johnny Fever) and Lonnie Anderson from WKRP, Lisa Whelchel (Blair) from Facts of Life, Deney Terrio (Dance Fever) and Dorinda Medley & Margaret Josephs from the Real Housewives. Musical Guests Luci Martin, Norma Jean Wright & Alpha Anderson (formerly of CHIC) sang “LeFreak”, “Good Times” & “We are Family” while Maxine Nightingale sang “Right Back Where We Started From” just after the Sabres scored to win in overtime. We’re well on our way to the $6,000,000 mark and announced the event will return Thanksgiving weekend in 2019.\n\n2017\n\nAnson Williams (Potsie from Happy Days), Jimmie Walker (JJ from Good Times), Willie Aames (Tommy Bradford from Eight is Enough) & Priscilla Barnes (Three’s Company) spent time with our guests along with Dolores & Teresa for RHONJ. Musical guest Grammy winner Yvonne Elliman sang “If I can’t have you” and Martha Wash performed “It’s raining men” with Buffalo’s best Drag Queens as stagemates. Although we’re still paying bills we’ll be over the $5,000,000 mark… thank you again!\n\n2016\n\nThis year’s SOLD OUT event included: Parker Stevenson (Hardy Boys, Falconcrest), Larry Wilcox (Jon from CHIPS), Ted Lange (Love Boat) , Deney Terrio (Dance Fever) and Musical Guests Shalamar with Jody Watley. Our attendee list included people from all over the world but our favorite guests were Lucan & Melanie Shortis who traveled from Melbourne Australia to attend. 7000 guests danced the night away and we almost crossed the $5 million dollar mark but it looks like we’ll have to wait until 2017. Stay tuned and thank for your support!\n\n2015\n\nYear 22 included special guests Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky & Hutch), Donnie Most (Happy Days), Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear) & Erin Murphy (Bewitched) joined Musical guest Peaches and Herb who performed their # 1 hits “Reunited” & “Shake your Grove Thing”. We crossed the $4,400,000 mark and are closing in on 5M!! Thanks for continuing to come out and support us!!\n\n2014\n\nThis year’s crew included Cindy Williams (Laverne & Shirley), Lorenzo Lamas (Grease and Falconcrest) & Henry Winkler (The Fonz). Musical Guest Tavares was introduced by legendary Disco weatherman Kevin O’Connell and they performed their hits “More than a Woman” & “Heaven Must be Missing an Angel”. The general admission event sold out again and The VIP sold out in a record 2.5 hrs. We inched closer to the $4,000,000 mark in donations but are still waiting for some bills to pay. Thanks again for your support!\n\n2013 – 20th Anniversary\n\nOur 20th anniversary brought back old friends and we met many new ones. Barry, Chris, Mike & Susan (Greg, Peter, Bobby & Cindy Brady) along with Deney Terrio (Dance Fever) attended. They were joined by Kristy & Jimmy McNichol & Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Freddie “Boom Boom” Washington). Our Surprise musical guest has been in the works since we started back up in 1994. We said if we ever made it to 20 years she would return to headline the event like she did in 1979. Gloria Gaynor performed on the main stage and took down the house. The event again sold out and everyone agreed it was our best party to date. We crossed the $3,500,000 mark in donations and appreciate everyone’s support!\n\n2012\n\nWe crossed the $3,000,000 in donations this year… thank you! 2012 featured a wide array of Celebs including Tom Wopat & John Schneider (Bo & Luke from The Dukes of Hazard) and Jerry Houser (Summer of 42, Brady Brides & Dave “Killer” Carlson from Slap Shot). The Grammy winning 70’s group Heatwave sang their hits “Groveline” & “Always and Forever” on the main stage. We expanded our VIP Lounge and the room was again a quick sell as VIP Tickets were all gone in 3 hrs and the main event sold out the first day tickets went on sale. Looking forward to our 20th anniversary on Nov 30th 2013!\n\n2011\n\nWe inched closer to the $3,000,000 mark falling less than 100k short! This year’s event featured David Cassidy whose fan club in the 70’s had more members than Elvis or The Beatles. Our musical guests Norma Jean Wright & Luci Martin (the former lead vocalists of Chic) performed their hits “Good Times” & disco anthem “LeFreak” . The VIP lounge expanded and now occupies two ballrooms on the lower level. Our VIP area now exceeds 25,000 sq. feet! All 7000 Tickets to our event sold out the day they went on sale & we continue to appear on many folks “bucket list” as a “must do” event. Thanks for 18 years of supporting our event!!!\n\n2010\n\nOur best year ever as we crossed the $2,000,000 mark in funds donated to charity. Cindy Morgan(“Lacy Underalls” from Caddyshack) & Henry “The Fonz” Winkler stole the show . Although Cindy looked as good as she did in the movie, The Fonz was voted “the nicest Celebrity” to ever grace our event with their presence. Both enjoyed a night at The Sabres game and WWE wrestler “Disco Inferno” joined in the fun as well. Evelyn “Champagne” King took the stage to perform her hit song “Shame” and received a huge response. This years event sold out in a few hours and the expanded VIP room was a huge hit. Thanks again for supporting our event!\n\n2009\n\nLou “The Hulk” Ferrigno headlined our list of celebrity guests that also included WWF star Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka and longtime friend of Camp Good Days Chris Kirkpatrick from *NSYNC. Tix went on sale to our presale customers and the event sold-out in 2 days, 4 months before the event. VIP tix were gone within hours. This years event featured even more lights, more video and more polyester than has even been witnessed in once place since the 70’s. The party raised over $300,000 for charity with the $2,000,000 mark within reach. We can’t thank you enough for coming back year after year!\n\n2008\n\nTo help celebrate our 15th anniversary we invited the Brady’s back for the party (Barry “Greg” Williams, Chris ”Peter” Knight, Mike “Bobby” Lookinland & Susan ”Cindy” Olsen). Also seen in the crowd were VH-1 President Tom Calderone, WWE stars “The Honky Tonk Man” & “Virgil”…. You never know who you’ll see at The Disco. Lots of changes this year including a million dollar sound and light show and our first major price increase since 1994. The result: tickets sold out faster than ever during our presale, which meant there were no tickets left for sale to the general public….sorry. The Party was featured in a new book called “Party Across America”. Lastly, the event raised over $300,000 for charity. Cheers to you!\n\n2007\n\nErik “Ponch” Estrada makes good on his promise to attend this year’s event and is beloved by our guests. The expanded liquor bar and new ticket booth eliminated lines for the entire event. National media was on the scene as we were featured on CNN, Fox News and over 50 ABC news affiliates. Better yet, the event raised over $200,000 for Camp Good Days. Thanks again!\n\n2006\n\nDanny “Partridge Family” Bonaduce fills in for last minute cancellation by Erik Estrada and is a huge hit. Couple gets engaged on main stage and fiancé gets lecture from Danny on the virtues (and reality) of marriage in front of capacity crowd of 7000. The event sells out 2 months in advance. Conesus Fest officially crosses the $1,000,000 in donations. Thanks for your support!!\n\n2005\n\nChris Knight (Peter Brady) and his lovely fiancée Adrian Curry (America’s Next Top Model) join the Hanson Brothers (Slap Shot) as our 70’s celebrity icons. 7000 tix to the main event are gobbled up by the disco nation in a little over a week (new record). 1000 tickets to the VIP party sell out after being on sale to the public for only 2 days! The outfits continue to amaze (think those platforms with goldfish in the heels are something special??? Over 40 guests showed up with them in 05) and the event is featured on National Public Radio, Entertainment Magazine, and the Washington Post. Total donations to Camp Good Days now exceed $850,000. Thanks for your support !!\n\n2004\n\nLeif Garrett (musician/teen idol), Anson Williams (Potsie from Happy Days) & Charlene Tilton (Lucy Ewing from Dallas) visit “The Disco” for it’s most successful year ever. General Admission tix sold out 2 weeks before the event & the now famous VIP party sold out 4 days after tickets went on sale to the public! To date, the party has raised & donated over $650,000 to cancer related charities. Disco may be dead, but it’s alive and well every Thanksgiving weekend in Buffalo !!\n\n2003\n\nSusan Olsen (Cindy Brady) joined her Brady Bunch brothers to help make this event one to remember. VIP Tickets sold out 3 weeks before the event & general admission ticket sales were halted 3 days before this years’ party. With this years contribution Conesus Fest for Charity passed the $500,000 in donations since it’s inception in 1994. And they said Disco was dead ??? Thanks again !!\n\n2002\n\nAll the Brady Boys: Greg (Barry Williams), Peter (Chris Knight) & Bobby (Mike Lookinland) made a very rare appearance together at this year’s event. Grey Goose officially became a sponsor & the event raised a record amount for Camp Good Days. To date almost $350,000 has been donated to charity in the name of Fun & Philanthropy. Thanks for coming back year after year !!\n\n2001\n\nThe French Connection (Gil Perrault, Rick Martin and Rene Robert) joined forces with Chris Knight (Peter Brady) and Deney Terrio (Dance Fever) for our most successful event to date. The party also continued it’s sellout attendance record. Since the World’s Largest Disco’s inception in 1994, over $250,000 has been donated to charity. Thank You!!\n\n2000\n\nChris Knight (Peter Brady)lead this years group of celebs, Deney Terrio returned & danced with guests in the VIP room for over 90 minutes!! A couple from Florida got engaged in front of the Hanson Brothers & five lucky people won two round trip airline tickets on Southwest Airlines. Despite a state of emergency snowstorm three days before the party, the event was again a sellout. 2000’s event was our most successful event to date.\n\n1999\n\nLive music returns for the first time since 1979, featuring performances by The Trammps, Otis Day and The Knights & Barry Williams (Greg Brady). The Hanson Brothers (Slapshot), Erin Murphy (Tabitha) and Ernie D (Buffalo Braves) appeared as celebrity guests. One lucky guest in our sold out crowd of 7000+ won a two year lease on a 2000 Retro Beetle.\n\n1998\n\nMore bathrooms and bars are added resulting in no lines to drink or pee! VH-1 films and Erin Murphy (Tabitha) joins our roster of celebrities. Attendance is limited to 7,000. Event receives great reviews from the media and guests.

Thank you!\n\n1997\n\nVH-1 films the event while Deney Terrio (Dance Fever), Barry Williams (Greg Brady), and the Hanson Brothers (’70s movie Slap Shot) entertain the guests. The event sells out with a crowd of 11,000. More than 3,000 people without tickets show up in an effort to gain entry. Buffalo Police are forced to close down streets surrounding the Convention Center to disperse the crowd. All goes well inside!!! The event raises $30,000 for Camp Good Days and Special Times.\n\n1996\n\nTed Lange (Isaac from The Love Boat) joined in the fun along with Barry Williams. The entire Convention Center is used (only half was used in previous years) and the event draws a record 6,000 people.\n\n1995\n\nBuilding on the success of the event in 1994, Conesus Fest for Charity solicits corporate sponsors for the event and adds Barry Williams (Greg Brady). The event receives national media exposure; all three local Buffalo news stations broadcast live from the event. Attendance tops the 4,000 mark and people are turned away at the door.\n\n1994\n\nConesus Fest for Charity stages the 15th anniversary of the World’s Largest Disco with the blessing of the original promoter. The group was overwhelmed when the anticipated crowd of 600 turned out to be 1,800.\n\n1979"
