        "text": "Estate planning isn’t something that lots of us want to think about but it’s a right that often requires careful consideration and expertise. In the United Kingdom, estate planning is shaped by the unique legal systems of its constituent countries, with notable distinctions between Scottish law and English succession law. Additionally, when individuals possess assets in different jurisdictions, such as France, it becomes imperative to understand the intricacies of each legal framework to ensure that one’s wishes are upheld and assets are passed on smoothly. In this article, we will explore the differences between estate planning in various jurisdictions, emphasising the significance of having wills in place, especially where immovable assets are involved. Understanding Jurisdictional Differences 1. English and Welsh Succession Law: In England and Wales, estate planning is guided by a principle known as “testamentary freedom.” This means that individuals have a considerable degree of autonomy in deciding how their assets should be distributed upon their death. This freedom allows you to choose beneficiaries, allocate assets, and even specify conditions for inheritance. However, if one fails to exercise this right by creating a valid will, their assets will pass according to the laws of intestacy. 2. Scottish Law: In Scotland, the legal landscape differs substantially from that of England and Wales. The concept of “testamentary freedom” is less pronounced, and the law imposes certain legal rights on spouses and children, which limit the extent to which an individual can disinherit them. As a result, estate planning in Scotland may involve more complex considerations to ensure that your wishes are realised. 3. French Succession Law: When dealing with immovable assets abroad, such as property in France, it’s essential to understand the local succession laws. French succession law follows the principle of “forced heirship,” meaning that a portion of an individual’s estate must be reserved for certain close relatives, such as children. This may limit your freedom to distribute assets as you see fit. To navigate this, it is advisable to seek legal advice and consider creating a separate will for assets located in France. Importance of Having Wills for Immovable Assets An immovable asset, as the term suggests, refers to a property or real estate that cannot be moved. This includes land, buildings, and any fixed structures on the land. When you own immovable assets in different jurisdictions, ensuring their smooth transition to your chosen beneficiaries becomes crucial. 1. Maintaining Control: Having a will in each relevant jurisdiction allows you to maintain control over the distribution of your immovable assets, even when local laws may impose restrictions. It ensures that your wishes are respected and minimises potential conflicts among heirs. 2. Reducing Legal Complications: Without a valid will in place, the process of transferring immovable assets across borders can become cumbersome and legally complex. By proactively addressing these issues in your will, you can streamline the process for your beneficiaries. What does this all mean? Estate planning is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour, particularly when dealing with assets in different jurisdictions. The differences between Scottish and English succession laws, as well as the unique aspects of French succession law, highlight the importance of tailored and expertly crafted wills. To make the most of your testamentary freedom in England and Wales and ensure your immovable assets are managed efficiently worldwide, consult with a legal professional well-versed in international estate planning. By doing so, you can safeguard your assets and provide for your loved ones in accordance with your wishes, regardless of where those assets are located.\n\nWhen it comes to legal documents, they rarely make for glamorous reading but Wills hold a unique and often poignant significance. They are the tangible expression of one’s final wishes, serving as a legacy and a guide for loved ones. At SLS Wills and More, a leading specialist Will writing firm based in the south of England (with a head office in Aylesham but covering South London and the South East, we understand the importance of creating Wills tailored to our clients’ needs. Today, we delve into the intriguing world of Wills, exploring the longest and shortest Wills ever recorded. The Lengthy Epic: The Guinness World Record Holder The Longest Will in the World The title for the longest Will in recorded history belongs to Frederica Evelyn Stilwell Cook, an Englishwoman who passed away in 1924. Her remarkable Will stretched to a staggering 1,066 pages, comprising more than 95,940 words. Mrs. Cook’s extraordinary document was not a mere list of possessions and beneficiaries, but a detailed account of her personal history, philosophies, and memories. Her Will included intricate descriptions of her travels, relationships, and the experiences that shaped her life. It featured heartfelt anecdotes, letters, and even a poem composed by Mrs. Cook herself. Her Will’s extraordinary length was a testament to her desire to leave behind not just her assets but also her life story. It took the legal community several years to decipher and execute her wishes fully. This would have come at considerable expense to the estate and is one downside to the length of the document. While Mrs. Cook’s Will is an exceptional case, it reminds us that Wills can be more than just legal documents; they can be a legacy in themselves. The Pithy Record: The World’s Shortest Will The Shortest Will in the World On the opposite end of the spectrum, we find the world’s shortest Will. In 1906, Frederick Handel, a renowned English composer, and musician, left behind a will that has gone down in history as the briefest ever recorded. It consisted of a mere three words: “All to wife.” Handel’s succinct Will could be argued that it left no room for ambiguity. His intentions were clear: he wanted his entire estate to go to his wife, Ann. This minimalist approach to estate planning might seem unconventional, but it demonstrates that a Will need not be lengthy to be effective. In fact, a concise and unambiguous Will can often prevent disputes and ensure a smooth distribution of assets. Naturally, professional advise is always advisable.

On July 26th, a significant change in statutory legacy gifts took effect, increasing the amount from £270,000 to £322,000. A statutory legacy gift refers to the portion of an individual’s estate that is legally protected and reserved for their close family members, usually their spouse or civil partner, and is effective where an intestacy occurs. This simply means when someone dies without a Will. The increase from £270,000 to £322,000 means that now, if an individual passes away without leaving a Will, a larger sum of their estate will automatically be granted to their surviving spouse or civil partner. This change aims to provide greater financial protection and security for widowed partners, ensuring they receive a more substantial portion of their deceased loved one’s estate. By raising the statutory legacy gift amount, the government seeks to reflect the changing economic landscape and the increasing costs of living, enabling surviving partners to maintain a higher standard of living and potentially easing financial burdens during a difficult time. This adjustment in statutory legacy gifts is likely to have implications for inheritance distributions and legal considerations in cases of intestacy, offering more significant benefits to surviving spouses or civil partners in the event of their partner’s death without a valid Will. If this doesn’t reflect your wishes, we advise that you book in an appointment to discuss your estate planning with us. We’ll talk to you about what could stand in the way of your wishes being carried out and explain how a Will could provide greater flexibility as to how your estate can be distributed helping you to remain in control. This is the new intestacy flowchart reflecting these changes and demonstrating what could happen should you pass away without a Will. Should you have any questions, please let us know:"
