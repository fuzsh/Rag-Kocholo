        "text": "03.31.02\n\nA bad day\n\nJoey reports: Kathy Wren called us on the cell phone this afternoon to tell us that she and Danielle were in an ambulance on the way to the UCSF emergency room. Danielle had had a seizure while she and Kathy were waiting in line at Ben and Jerry's, where they'd gone to get Danielle a large vanilla milkshake. Danielle fell and hit her head. She suffered a nasty knock to the forehead, but fortunately, that was the extent of the incidental injuries.\n\nThe people at Zen Hospice spoke to a doctor on the scene at the ice cream shop, told him that they were on the way, and urged him not to allow anyone to take Danielle away. But someone had already dialed 911. We hurried to the emergency room to collect Danielle before she was pulled too far into the medical system.\n\nLuckily, Mila was able to get Danielle released very quickly. (At right: Danielle and Kathy at the ER.) We, of course, swung by the ice cream shop on the way home and got Danielle her large vanilla milkshake. But then, as we neared the hospice, Danielle had another intense seizure in the passenger seat of the car. As severe as it was, she still managed to do a bit of her back-seat driving while her body was shaking; she pointed very clearly in the direction she wanted Mila to drive.\n\nThis second seizure lasted about three minutes. Soon after she got to her room, she had a third one. All of this left her extremely fatigued. The right side of her body remained immobile for the rest of the evening, and her comprehension was pretty seriously affected. She spent the evening in a wheelchair, and we stayed on hand to keep things calm for her and help her with food and medication.\n\nTell you what, though: She drank that whole goddamn vanilla milkshake.\n\nEvery last drop.\n\n03.31.02\n\nFrom somewhere near Russia, with love\n\nKat reports: Kat Fotovat here, from Moldova. My week with Danielle was full of smiley cookies from Tags, music, dominoes, laughs, and meeting many of the wonderful people from Danielle's life, whom I had heared so much about but never met. My first day in town, Danielle was busy being the superstar: She had about 10 visitors over at the hospice. The staff and volunteers were amazed by all the love and support Danielle receives from visitors and through letters and packages, which she loves. The hospice is an absolutely amazing place. The love there is strong, and it's easy to feel at home with the great food, nice surroundings and the wonderful staff.\n\nOn Saturday, Danielle's friends Jon and Tammi put on the Lord Lava and the Lush (Danielle's high school band) video for us so we could watch Danielle's rockin' drum skills. Sunday morning we all went to Glide Methodist Church, where Danielle was dancing and rockin' out to their incredible choir. We played a bazillion games of dominoes. Domino-matrix Danielle whipped my butt. Tuesday, Danielle's mom, Sandy, came in and we watched Danielle's friend Jonathan on TV. Wednesday was Danielle's spa day. She had accupressure and a massage at the same time. You should have seen her face as these two women worked their magic. Later we played dominoes with Mila at a nearby cafe and blew magic bubbles.\n\nThursday Danielle's childhood friends Doug and Mark Tisdahl came to town, and Mila took us all for a picnic on a beachside cliff. We watched the hang gliders take off and played more dominoes. That night we were treated to a seder that Sandy hosted at the hospice. Sandy fixed enough food to feed an army and led us thorugh the Haggadah. It was Joey and my first seder and one of the most beautiful celebrations I have ever seen. Danielle got in some great jokes, and to make our evening complete, Kate and Susan brought over dessert.\n\nOn my last night, Danielle, Kathy Wren and I went to a Giant's and A's baseball game. Danielle sang along to all the songs and cheered at all the great plays. She also really liked the big, bright, full moon shining down on us.\n\nThe week was wonderful. Just what a Peace Corps volunteer needed- -to spend time with a dear friend who always makes my life seem beautiful. Danielle has a lot of visitors, so be sure to call before you come. I am truly amazed by all her fans, most of all by Mila. We can only hope for that kind of love in all of our lives.\n\nThanks to my Dear Bubbula. You are my special angel!\n\nAbove left: Kat and Danielle blowing bubbles at the Laguna Street Cafe. At right: Danielle and Doug Tisdahl at Fort Funston.\n\n03.30.02\n\nSeder Tots\n\nJoey reports: Kat has a much more complete and meaningful description of the seder we had in the spaciously appointed dining room of the Zen Hospice. However, Mila finds herself temporarily disconnected and unable to add Kat's update just yet, so I'm taking the liberty of inserting my own impressions.\n\nNeither Kat nor I had ever been to a Seder, so everything was new to us. Sandy \"Doc\" Drumke outdid herself with her patented Doc Drumke Matzo Ball Soup Â¨. She also proved a very compelling reader of the Haggadah. The gathered company thrilled to the story of the plagues (frogs were the big favorite) and the cinematic escape from Egypt.\n\nAt the end of the table, the beitzah (egg), maror (bitter herbs), chazeret (bitter root), karpas (vegetable), charoset (apple mixture) and zeroa (shankbone), sat in their respective places in a lovely Seder plate, which we had courtesy of Kate and Susan. Some Hebrew characters were inscribed in the center of the plate. The letters appeared to spell \"GOV,\" and we joked about this, not knowing what they really spelled, until someone mentioned that Danielle could read Hebrew.\n\nA slight feeling of awkwardness descended on the table. It's become so difficult for Danielle to communicate, I think we all felt a little guilty for having pointed this out. She was smiling slightly, and it seemed that she was confirming our fears that she'd be frustrated -- able to understand the writing, but unable to translate out loud.\n\nHesitantly, Doug Tisdahl asked, \"Danielle, can you...do you know what these symbols stand for?\"\n\nWithout a pause, Danielle wiped her lips with her napkin, nodded, and reached for the plate. She plucked up the egg.\n\n\"Egg,\" she said. Then the maror: \"Parsley.\" Then the charzeret: \"Horseradish.\"\n\nWe all laughed because she wasn't really translating, just saying the English names of things. We thought that was the joke. And we were so amazed that the words were coming smoothly for her, that it took us until the charoset to realize that the English translation for each item was written right on the plate -- which no one but Danielle had even noticed!\n\nAbove left: Danielle and Joey show off their matching glow-in-the-dark pajamas after telling Mila that she always takes these wierdly angled pictures because she thinks they are funny. But let's face it, they are funny."
