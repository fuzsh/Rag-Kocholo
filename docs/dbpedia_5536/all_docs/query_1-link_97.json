He was 115.\n\n“He died like a little angel,” Martinez said.\n\nMercado del Toro never married and had no children.\n\nIn the seaside town of Isabela, he became a local celebrity after he was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for his longevity.\n\n“We’re all crying, but we knew this day would come,” said town spokeswoman Rosa Luciano.\n\nMercado del Toro became the oldest known person in the world last month when 116-year-old Elizabeth “Lizzie” Bolden died in December in a nursing home in Tennessee.\n\nA 114-year-old Connecticut woman, Emma Faust Tillman, is now believed to be the oldest living person. She was born Nov. 22, 1892."
