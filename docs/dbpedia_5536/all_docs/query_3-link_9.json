        "text": "Music stars are mourning the loss of Cranberries singer Dolores O’Riordan, who has died at age 46.\n\nMusicians like Hozier, Diplo, Josh Groban and many others expressed their condolences on social media after learning the sad news on Monday (Jan. 15). O’Riordan died suddenly in London, where she was recording.\n\n“Dolores O’Riordan inspired me early on, to go out and brave my own songs in front of people. Zombie was one of the first covers I ever sang live. I always felt such raw emotion singing her songs. Sad to lose her and am endlessly grateful for her influence,” Kiesza tweeted.\n\nThe Cranberries became international stars in the 1990s with hits including “Zombie” and “Linger.” In 2017, the band released the acoustic album, Something Else, and was scheduled to tour Europe and North America.\n\nRead tributes to O’Riordan below."
