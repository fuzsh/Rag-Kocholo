        "text": "“Facing adversity is working 50 hours a week and still struggling to feed your kids. Facing third and fifteen without your best receiver with tens of millions in the bank, is not.” – Kyle, White Lake, Michigan\n\n“From the world of sports comes the latest example of word inflation. What’s wrong with the word ‘fans’?” – Paul, Canton, Michigan\n\n“A technical term for a useful means of categorizing content in social media, the word is abused as an interjection in verbal conversation and advertising. #annoying!” – Bob, Grand Rapids, Michigan\n\n“Typed on sites that use them, that’s one thing. When verbally spoken, hashtag-itgetsoldquickly. So, hashtag-knockitoff.” – Kuahmel, Gardena, California\n\n“Used when talking about Twitter, but everyone seems to add it to everyday vocabulary. #annoying #stopthat #hashtag #hashtag #hashtag .” – Alex, Rochester, Michigan\n\n“It’s #obnoxious #ridiculous #annoying and I wish it would disappear.” – Jen, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan\n\n“#sickoftheword” – Brian, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\n“It was a funny movie in its time, but the phrase should refer only to the film, not to men in the real world. It is an insult to the millions of dads who are the primary caregivers for their children. Would we tolerate calling working women Mrs. Dad?” says Pat, of Chicago, Illinois, who suggests we peruse the website captaindad.org, the manly blog of stay-at-home parenting.\n\n“I am a stay-at-home dad/parent. And if you call me ‘Mr. Mom,’ I will punch you in the throat. – Zachary, East Providence, Rhode Island\n\n“Society is changing and no longer is it odd for a man to take care of his children. Even the Wall Street Journal has declared, “Mr. Mom is dead” (Jan. 22, 2013). I think it is time to banish it.” – Chad, St. Peters, Missouri\n\n“People have taken pictures of themselves for almost as long as George Eastman’s company made film and cameras. Suddenly, with the advent of smartphones, snapping a ‘pic’ of one’s own image has acquired a vastly overused term that seems to pop up on almost every form of social media available to us … .A self-snapped picture need not have a name all its own beyond ‘photograph.’ It may only be a matter of time before photos of one’s self and a friend will become ‘dualies.’ LSSU has an almost self-imposed duty to carry out this banishment now.” – Lawrence, Coventry, Connecticut. and Ryan, North Andover, Massachusetts\n\n“Named ‘Word of the Year’ by Oxford Dictionary? Give me a break! Ugh, get rid of it.” – Bruce, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Myselfie disparages the word because it’s too selfie-serving. But enough about me, how about yourselfie?” – Lisa, New York, New York\n\n“It’s a lame word. It’s all about me, me, me. Put the smartphone away. Nobody cares about you.” — David, Lake Mills, Wisconsin\n\nDayna of Rochester Hills, Michigan, laments how many people observe “Selfie Sunday” in social media, and Josh of Tucson, Arizona, asks, “Why can’t we have more selflessies?”\n\nCassidy of Manheim, Pennsylvania said, “All evidence of Miley Cyrus’ VMA performance must be deleted,” but it seems that many had just as much fun as Miley did on stage when they submitted their nominations.\n\n“Let’s just keep with ‘shake yer booty’ — no need to ‘twerk’ it! Hi ho, hi ho, it’s away with twerk we must go.” – Michael, Haslett, Michigan\n\nBob of Tempe, Arizona says he responds, “T’werk,” when asked where he is headed on Monday mornings.\n\n“I twitch when I hear twerk, for to twerk proves one is a jerk — or is at least twitching like a jerk. Twerking has brought us to a new low in our lexicon.” – Lisa, New York, New York\n\n“Time to dance this one off the stage.” – Jim, Flagstaff, Arizona\n\n“The fastest overused word of the 21st century.” – Sean, New London, New Hampshire\n\n“The newest dictionary entry should leave just as quickly.” – Bruce, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\n“You can’t turn on the news without hearing this. I’m equally worried about the River of Debt and Mountain of Despair.”Christopher Loiselle, Midland, Michigan\n\n“(We’ve) lost sight of the metaphor and started to think it’s a real place, like with the headline, ‘Obama, Boehner meeting on fiscal cliff’.” Barry Cochran, Portland, Oregon\n\n“Tends to be used however the speaker wishes to use it, as in falling off the fiscal cliff, climbing the fiscal cliff, challenged by the fiscal cliff, etc. Just once, I would like to hear it referred to as a financial crisis.” Barbara CLIFF, Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Continually referred to as ‘the so-called fiscal cliff,’ followed by a definition. How many times do we need to hear ‘fiscal cliff,’ let alone its definition? Please let this phrase fall off of a real cliff!” Randal Baker, Seabeck, Washington\n\n“Fiscal cliff, fiscal update, fiscal austerity … whatever happened to ‘economic’ updates? Fiscal has to go.” Dawn Farrell-Taylor, Ontario, Canada\n\n“Makes me want to throw someone over a real cliff,” Donna, Johnstown, New York\n\n“If only those who utter these words would take a giant leap off of it.” Joann Eschenburg, Clinton Twp., Michigan\n\n“One of the most overplayed buzz terms of the 2012 presidential campaign. Apparently ‘lowering unemployment’ doesn’t have the same impact.” Dennis Ittner, Torrance, California\n\n“Since jobs are only created by demand, consumers are the real job creators.” Scott Biggerstaff, Redlands, California\n\n“It’s been overused and pigeon-holed into political arguments left, right, and center to the point that I don’t believe it has any real meaning.” Adam Myers, Cumming, Georgia.\n\n“To belong to this tax-proof club, you don’t have to create a single job. All you need to do is be rich. In fact, many people who call themselves ‘job creators’ make their money by laying off people.” S. Lieberman, Seattle, Washington\n\n“Uttered by every politician who wants to give big tax breaks to rich people and rich businesses …” Jack Kolars, North Mankato, Minnesota.\n\n“If these guys are capitalists, as claimed, they are focused on reducing expenses and maximizing profit. Jobs are a large part of expenses. So, if anything at all, they minimize employment to maximize profits. Up is down, black is white. Job creators are really employment minimizers.” Bob Fandrich, Fredericksburg, Virginia\n\n“I’m surprised it wasn’t on your 2012 list — were you just kicking the, um, phrase down the road to 2013?” T. Jones, Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\n“I thought that perhaps you weren’t ready to deal with it. You just kicked that can down the road.” Rebecca Martz, Houston, Tex.\n\n“I would definitely like to kick some cans of the human variety every time I hear politicians use this phrase to describe a circumstance that hasn’t gone their way.” Christine Tomassini, Livonia, Mich.\n\n“Much the same as ‘put on the back burner,’ these two phrases still have heat and are still in the road. Kick this latest phrase down the road.” Michael F. Raczko, Swanton, Ohio\n\n“I can’t turn on the TV any more without being informed that can-kicking has occurred. What’s wrong with the word ‘postpone’?” Kathryn, West Chester, Ohio\n\n“It’s amazing that you haven’t added that word to your list over the years. Totally, absolutely, really amazing. Not quite astounding, but still amazing.” – Charles Attardi, Astoria, New York\n\n“Although I am extremely happy to no longer hear the word ‘awesome’ used incorrectly and way too often, it appears to me it is quickly being replaced with ‘amazing.’ Pay attention and you will no doubt be amazingly surprised to find that I am right.” – Gregory Scott, Palm Springs, California\n\n“People use ‘amazing’ for anything that is nice or heartwarming. In other words, for things that are not amazing.” – Gitel Hesselberg, Haifa, Israel\n\n“Every talk show uses this word at least two times every five minutes. Hair is not ‘amazing.’ Shoes are not ‘amazing.’ There are any number of adjectives that are far more descriptive. I saw Martha Stewart use the word ‘amazing’ six times in the first five minutes of her television show. Help!” – Martha Waszak, Lansing, Michigan\n\n“Banish it for blatant overuse and incorrect use … to stop my head from exploding.” – Paul Crutchfield, Norwich, Norfolk, United Kingdom\n\n“The word which once aptly described the process of birth is now used to describe such trivial things as toast, or the color of a s-hirt.” – JP, Comox, British Columbia, Canada\n\n“Anderson Cooper used it three times recently in the opening 45 seconds of his program. My teeth grate, my hackles rise and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse. I don’t even like ‘Amazing Grace’ anymore. – Sarah Howley, Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\n“The word has been overused to describe things only slightly better than mundane. I blame Martha Stewart because to her, EVERYTHING is amazing! It has lost its ‘wow factor’ and has reached ‘epic’ proportions of use. It’s gone ‘viral,’ I say! ‘I’m just sayin’!’ – Alyce-Mae Alexander, Maitland, Florida\n\n“This is a phrase we need to finally give birth to, then send on its way.” – Mary Sturgeon, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n\n“I’m tired of a pregnancy being reduced to a celebrity accessory. Or worse, when less-than-six-pack abs are suspected of being one.” – Afton, Portland, Oregon\n\nI am so sick of that phrase! It makes pregnancy sound like some fun and in-style thing to do, not a serious choice made by (at the very least) the woman carrying the child.” – Susan, Takoma Park, Maryland\n\n“Why can’t we just use the old tried-and-true ‘pregnant?’ I never heard anyone complain about that description.” – Eric, Poca, West Virginia"
