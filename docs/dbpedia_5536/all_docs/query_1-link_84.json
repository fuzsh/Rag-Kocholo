        "text": "In his poem “Alumnus Football,” legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice closed out his epic with these immortal words:\n\n\"For when the One Great Scorer\n\nComes to mark against your name,\n\nHe writes – not that you won or lost –\n\nBut how you played the Game.”\n\nEach year, we begin our annual tribute the exact same way.\n\nAnd those same words could also be penned for many of the sporting immortals and athletic dignitaries from the local scene who we sadly said good-bye to during the year 2019.\n\nFrom the Boston sports scene, several notables who passed included NBA Hall of Famer and Celtics hero John Havlicek, Bruins defenseman Teddy Green, Patriot greats Nick Buoniconti and Larry Garron, and former Red Sox stars Pumpsie Green, Gene Stephens, Tex Clevenger, Jerry Casale, Lenny Green and Bill Buckner.\n\nWe also bade farewell to Boston Globe sportswriter Nick Cafardo, the ignominious Rosie Ruiz, who claimed to win the 1980 Boston Marathon only to be caught cheating, and Pete Frates, the face of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, who lost his battle with the insidious disease at the age of 34.\n\nSince last year’s column, we also paid a fond farewell to many sporting personalities and dignitaries from the Gardner sporting scene over the past 12 months.\n\nIn our first segment of the Passing Scene for 2019 our first list includes:\n\nNorman Abare — a one-time member of the Gardner Merchants semi-pro football team of the early 1950s.\n\nRay “Pete” Ambrose — had the distinction of being the youngest player to ever play for the semi-pro football Gardner Merchants from 1945 to 1947, when he was age 15. He later played for the Gardner Merchants baseball team from 1952 to 1953.\n\nDolores (Berlo) Zimmerman — a former NASCAR licensed stock car driver during her younger years spent in Gardner, she was the first woman stock car driver to win at Monadnock Raceway in New Hampshire in the early 1980s.\n\nBrandon Bonk — a local athlete who was actively involved in local men’s softball leagues.\n\nGeorge Bousquet — a longtime groundskeeper at Murdock High School, he was inducted into the school’s hall of fame in 1999 as an outstanding contributor to the sports programs there.\n\nRussell Brooks — one of the local softball players who was part of the Guinness Book of World Records setting marathon held in Gardner back in 1981.\n\nRev. Alston R. Chace — a retired Chaplain and Colonel in the United States Air Force, he was a Wildcat lineman of the 1940s. In later years, he was a frequent visitor to the Gardner High Athletic Hall of Fame and football banquet, always willing to give his time for an invocation or inspiring word.\n\nPaul Collette — A 1998 inaugural Oakmont Athletic Hall of Famer, he held the school record in the 120 yd. high hurdles at 14.6 second. He also played end on the undefeated 1972 football team which finished with an 8-0-1 record. In the spring, he was a state champion in the 120-yard low hurdles and twice competed in the New England track championships.\n\nDavid “Butch” Derby — a three-sport athlete at Murdock from the 1960s, who once held the school track record in the shot put.\n\nPaul DesBois — Better known to one and all as one of the West Gardner square’s foremost barbers, he was a champion diver at Gardner High School in the early 1940s. In his junior and senior years, he competed in the Meehan Championships of New England, winning the gold medal as a junior and finishing runner-up in his senior year.\n\nHenry “Hank” Doody — the former ice hockey coach at Murdock High School in the early years of the sport.\n\nManfred “BG” Drewski — a rugged Wildcat lineman and member of the famed GHS Hall of Fame 1954 team that went 9-0 and captured the 1954 North Worcester County championship.\n\nGeorgia (Erikson) Owen — a champion swimmer with the Greenwood Memorial, she attended the 1960 Olympic trials and was the second woman to break the one-minute mark in the 100 freestyle. Once ranked as the number one female swimmer in New England, she later coached the Gardner High School Swim Team from 1981 to 1993.\n\nJohn Hess — He was an outstanding running back with the 1977 Oakmont Super Bowl champions, rushing for over 100 yards and a touchdown in the victory over Palmer. He finished his career with 30 touchdowns and 194 points, and was an inaugural member of the Oakmont Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nPeter Janhunen — a former Oakmont catcher and quarterback whose 20-yard touchdown pass to Ray Valiton was the first scoring play in Spartan football history in a 22-6 loss to Murdock on Oct. 3, 1964.\n\nJohn Kiosses — one of the last members of the local sporting fraternity known as The Jackson Eagles, he performed on their basketball and softball teams over the years. However, he was better known as a beloved Gardner elementary school teacher.\n\nThey shall all be missed.\n\nOn Saturday: Part 2 of “The Passing Scene, 2019.”\n\n(Comments and suggestions for The Gardner Scene can be sent to Mike Richard at mikerichard0725@gmail.com or in writing Mike Richard, 92 Boardley Rd.
