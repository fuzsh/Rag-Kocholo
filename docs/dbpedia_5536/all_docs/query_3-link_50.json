Attending St. Michael’s school in Bridgeport, Dottie developed an active imagination and a talent for making friends, something that would serve her well in life. At a time when most were under significant economic strain, her mother worked tirelessly to build a thriving bar and grill called the Bon Ton, while providing Dottie and her sister, Florence (Allard), with unwavering love, support, and encouragement at home.\n\nDottie attended Bassick High School where she made lifelong friends who turned into a weekly meeting of the “the bridge club” for the next 50 years. We fondly remember the living room re-arranged to accommodate three card tables and the room filled with laughing ladies in animated conversation under a light pall of cigarette smoke. After Bassick our mother attended Weylister Secretarial College in Milford and trained as a Medical Record Librarian. She first worked at St Vincent’s Hospital, which was all she had hoped – glamourous, exciting, and demanding, followed by Milford Hospital where she became the first Tumor Clinic Secretary. Unfortunately, her career didn’t last long for she soon met Gregory F. Doyle, also of Bridgeport, and was immediately smitten. Given that Gregory was six years her senior, she tried her best to appear sophisticated and mature by ordering a fancy cocktail and lighting up a cigarette on their first date. The relationship almost ended before it began as Greg disapproved of both vices. Fortunately, her kindhearted nature, genuine ability to connect, and her dancing skills left Gregory captivated, such that both realized that neither needed to put on airs. They were married for 59 years.\n\nOnce married, Dottie urged Greg to enter the funeral business. After attending embalming school, they moved to Lynchburg Virginia with their first child (Gregory). Living so far away from family became an ever-increasing burden and soon they were headed back North to see if they could make a go of it on their own. They opened the Gregory F. Doyle Funeral Home in 1951. In the spirit of partnership, Dorothy soon became one of Connecticut’s first female Funeral Directors assisting her husband while raising a family that would soon grow to five. With the support of family, she raised five children, led funerals and joined every women’s civic organization in the area. Driven by kindness and purpose, coupled with a desire to help those in need, she eventually became president of every organization she joined including the Ladies Auxiliary of Milford Hospital, the Lady Lions, and St. Ann’s Guild. In addition, Dottie was an active participant in the Legion of Christ.\n\nOur mother’s altruistic nature was an integral part of our lives: as children we were regularly brought into area nursing homes to “visit those without family”, and every holiday we had at least one person around our table who would otherwise have been alone. Though driven by faith, our mother possessed the unique ability to adapt, take in new information and grow at every stage of her life. In her 30’s she attended parenting courses; in her 40’s she learned Transcendental Meditation; her 50’s saw her become part of the first Bereavement team in the US’s first free-standing hospice in Branford; in her 60’s she took up golf; her 70’s saw her go to a gym and work with a personal trainer; in her late 80’s she travelled solo on a cruise ship to Europe and in her 90’s she discovered Tai Chi.\n\nThe most enduring legacy our mother left was her overwhelming sense of gratitude and appreciation. While losses piled up, as they do for everyone in advanced age, she remained philosophical. Rather than lamenting she would say “It’s another time”. At the end of her life, it was this gift that endeared her to her two carers, Teresea and Yadja, and also to the staff at Carlton Rehab and Bridgeport Hospital where she referred to all as “angels”.\n\nOur mother will be greatly missed, and though we are sad we withhold tears on her orders for as she often said she had had the most wonderful life one could ever expect, filled with awe and wonder. “What more can I want?” she would ask us, quite sincerely.\n\nIn the end, Dottie was hesitant to leave this earth, but her vibrant Catholic faith and belief that she would once again see her daughter Colleen and her husband Greg in heaven provided solace. Despite being predeceased by her beloved Colleen, Dottie leaves behind a large and loving family. Her surviving children include Greg and his wife Susan Coan in Leyden Mass; son-in-law William Britt along with Kiley, Adam, and Moriah Doyle Monsif; Conan and his wife Mary Kate Halpin and their children Jack and Lorena in Dublin, Ireland; Dody in Lasdon, South Carolina and her children Devin and Adrienne; and “her baby” Kerry in Somerville, Mass. As a final gift towards the end of her life Dottie was blessed with six great-grandchildren, the eldest of whom are old enough to miss their dear Grandmama.\n\nFriends and family may call on Wednesday, December 6th from 4:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. in THE GREGORY F. DOYLE FUNERAL HOME, 291 Bridgeport Avenue, Milford.

She loved any Danielle Steel book, every sunset at a beach, and a nice walk whenever and wherever possible. Her walks with her husband were always her hand in his until Bob passed in 1986. Now she can wrap him in her arms once again.\n\nAnnette, known to some as Mommy and to others as Mere-Mere, was the most humble and loving person in all the lives that she touched. Raising five boys is no easy task, but she excelled at it. Devoted to her children, family, and friends – she always rallied to get everyone together to share a meal, tear up the dance floor, or simply have a cup of coffee in the morning or tea in the evening. As the grandchildren grew up, she was there to watch a baseball game, a karate class, observe a dance recital, play catch in the backyard, or read a story to whomever was sitting in her lap. She was of modest taste and simple style, but always looked like a million dollars. Her smile was worth two million.\n\nAnnette will be truly missed by her loving children, Robert (Darlene), Mark (Debbie), Brian (Nancy), Paul (Lisa) and daughter in law Niki. Annette also leaves behind her adoring grandchildren, Robert (Sarah), Christopher (Emily), Matthew, Stephen, Timothy, Jessica (Tim), Kaitlin (Steve), Emily (Jon), Alec (Caitlin), Grace (Paul), Anne and Nicole.

Marietta, 98 (that’s not a typo), a seven-decade resident of Milford, died on December 24, 2023 at Milford Hospital after a brief illness.\n\nMary was born in Plains, Pa., on September 17, 1925 to Enrico and Filomena Balestrini and graduated from Sunbury High School, where she played in the marching band, in 1943. While many of the girls in her class took homemaking classes, Mary signed up for welding, so when she then followed her beloved older sister and best friend Josephine to Connecticut, Mary was snapped up by Chance Vought to weld a part on the wing of the Marine fighter-bomber F4U Corsair. It was the plane flown by “Pappy” Boyington and his Black Sheep Squadron. As her grandson Joseph said, her building planes that helped win the war was bada–. You can read about her Corsair exploits in Mary’s exhibit at the Connecticut Air and Space Center in Stratford.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Diana Dunna of Milford, who cared for her mother the last few years, allowing Mary to realize her wish to remain In her home as her mobility declined; her son, Jim, and his wife, Christine Negroni of Old Greenwich; granddaughter, Marian Schembari, her husband, Elliot Speed, and daughter, June Schembari of Oregon; grandson Antonio Schembari and his wife, Dr. Jenae Linville of Arizona; grandson Samuel Schembari of Michigan; grandson Joseph Schembari of Michigan; goddaughters Kathryn Balestrini and Janet Sanders, both of Milford; and several special nieces and nephews.\n\nShe is predeceased by Jimmy, her heart-throb husband. Together they ran the Beach Dry Cleaners, near St. Gabriel Church in Milford, where she was the seamstress. Somewhere in the back of an old gent’s closet must still hang a pair of trousers that she had to let out; by nine siblings, more Balestrinis that you can shake a stick at; and her son-in-law and best buddy, Craig Dunna.\n\nAlthough churning out Corsairs and helping to run a small business were major accomplishments, Mary was also a magician in the kitchen. The extraordinary Italian dinners she would produce fed the boisterous extended family that worked in the defense factories and fought in some of the major battles of the war that historians are still writing about. Harry was at Guadalcanal, Jim was in D-Day, Angelo was in Italy, Leo was a paratrooper who helped relieve Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge, and her husband proudly rode a battleship salvaged from Pearl Harbor into Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender. You can applaud now.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on December 28, 2023 at St. Gabriel Church, 26 Broadway, Milford, at 11 a.m. There will be no calling hours and interment will be private.
