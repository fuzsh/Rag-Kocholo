        "text": "Clu Gulager was born William Martin Gulager in Holdenville, Hughes County, Oklahoma. His nickname was given to him by his father for the clu-clu birds (known in English as martins, like his middle name) that were nesting at the Gulager home at the time Clu was born. He grew up on his uncle's ranch as a cowhand and when he was old enough he joined the United States Marine Corps for a stint from 1946-1948. He got the acting bug being in army plays so when he left he used the GI Bill of Rights to study acting. During this time he met his wife, actress Miriam Byrd-Nethery. They wed in 1952 and had two children: John (born 1957) and Tom (born 1965) The couple was married for more than 50 years until her death in 2003 from cancer.\n\nGulager's career started off as bit parts on popular western shows usually playing the heavy. Shows like Wanted Dead or Alive, Have Gun Will Travel, Laramie, Riverboat. He scored big with The Untouchables as \"Mad Dog Coll\", which led to him being offered the role of \"Billy the Kid\" on The Tall Man from 1960-1962, which also starred Barry Sullivan as \"Pat Garrett\". The show was pulled after two seasons reportedly because the powers that were didn't like kids seeing Billy the Kid as a hero.\n\nHis next big break was playing Deputy Emmett Ryker on The Virginian from 1964-1968. During this time he also fared very well as Lee Marvin's sidekick in the 1964 TV film The Killers, which was considered too violent for TV so it went to theaters. Having being burned out being a TV star he tried to break into films, mostly as a character actor. His stand out films were The Last Picture Show (1971, playing Ellen Burstyn's lover), McQ (1974) with John Wayne, and A Force of One (1979) with Chuck Norris, with whom he would later work in the 1990s on Walker, Texas Ranger.\n\nGulager was also cast in San Francisco International Airport, with Lloyd Bridges, which failed big time. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he was in almost every show around, playing bit parts. Then the unthinkable happened: he found a second career as a horror film actor; he followed the footsteps of other TV actors who were stuck in TV hell, like Doug McClure (his costar from The Virginian) and Christopher George. Both men found new careers in B-movies and late night horror films. Gulager finally got a lead part in Dan O'Bannon's cult classic The Return of the Living Dead (1985). He also was in A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, he appeared in TV and in the occasional horror flick. In 2005 he started acting in his son's horror films -- the Feasts movies and Piranha DD in his 80s. Not letting age get in his way, he was a horror fan favorite and still showed up at conventions at almost 90.\n\nCarmen Miranda was born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha on February 9, 1909, near Porto, Portugal, in the town of Marco de Canavezes. Not long after her birth her family moved to Brazil, where her father was involved in the produce business. The family settled in the then-capital city of Rio de Janeiro. ' After leaving school, Carmen got a job at a local store, and often began singing on the job. Before long she was discovered and got a singing job on a local radio station. She ultimately got a recording contract with RCA. By 1928 she was a genuine superstar in Brazil. As with other popular singers of the era, she eventually made her way into the film world. She made her debut in the Brazilian documentary A Voz do Carnaval (1933). Two years later she appeared in her first feature film, Alô, Alô, Brasil (1935).\n\nHowever. it was Estudantes (1935) that seemed to solidify Carmen in the minds of the Brazilian movie audiences. Now they realized she could act as well as sing. Although there was three years between \"Alo, Alo Carnaval\" and Banana-da-Terra (1939), Carmen continued to churn out musical hits in Brazil. The latter film would be the last in her home country.\n\nIn late 1939 Carmen arrived, with much fanfare in the press, in New York City. She was now ready to capture Americans' hearts with her talent. She appeared in some musical revues on Broadway and, just as everyone thought, was a huge hit. In 1940 Carmen was signed to appear in the Twentieth Century-Fox production Galopp ins Glück (1940), with Betty Grable and Don Ameche. The only complaint that critics had was the fact that Carmen was not on the screen enough.\n\nIn 1941 she was, again, teamed with Ameche in addition to Alice Faye in Carioca (1941). The film was extremely popular with the theater patrons. Her unique songs went a long way in making her popular. It was after Week-End in Havana (1941) that American cartoon artists began to cash in on Carmen's ever-growing popularity. In the 1930s and 1940s cartoons were sometimes shown as a prelude to whatever feature film was showing. Sure enough, the cartoon version of Carmen came wriggling across the screen, complete with her trademark fruit hat and wide, toothy grin.\n\nIn 1942 Carmen starred in Springtime in the Rockies (1942) with Betty Grable and Cesar Romero, both of whom she had worked with before. It was shortly after this that America began adopting her style of dress as the latest fad. 1944 saw her in three films: Something for the Boys (1944), Four Jills in a Jeep (1944) and Greenwich Village (1944). The first two did well at the box-office, but the last one left a lot to be desired. It was her last busy year in film. Carmen made one film each in 1945, '46, '47 and '48. After that she didn't make a film for two years, until Nancy Goes to Rio (1950), a production for MGM. Once again didn't make a film for several years, returning with Starr vor Angst (1953).\n\nShe did stay busy, singing on the nightclub circuit and appearing on the relatively new medium of television. However, \"Scared Stiff\" was her final performance on the silver screen. On August 4, 1955, she suffered a heart attack, although she didn't realize it at the time, during a video taping of The Jimmy Durante Show (1954). She went home after attending a party.\n\nEarly the next morning, on August 5, Carmen suffered a fatal heart attack. She was just 46 years old. Her body was flown to her adopted country of Brazil, where her death was declared a period of national mourning.\n\nCharlotte Rae was born Charlotte Rae Lubotsky in 1926, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the middle daughter of three sisters, between Beverly and Mimi. Her parents, Esther (nee Ottenstein) and Meyer Lubotsky, were Russian Jewish immigrants. Her father owned an automobile tire business. Her mother had been a childhood friend of Milwaukee-reared Golda Meir, future Prime Minister of Israel.\n\nRae wanted to be a dramatic actress, but eventually wound up being a comedienne, all because of her stand-up comedy routines. Her family moved to the village of Shorewood, Wisconsin (Milwaukee County) in 1936. After graduating from Shorewood High School, she attended Northwestern University, where she met future actress Cloris Leachman; the two would be lifelong friends. She dropped out of college and moved to New York City, and began a career as a stage actress, performing in such plays as \"Pickwick\", for which she was nominated in 1966 for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and, in 1969, for Best Actress in a Play for \"Morning, Noon and Night\". She co-starred with Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in Wagen 54, bitte melden (1961). She would live there until 1974 when she moved to Southern California.\n\nShe was nominated for an Emmy Award for her supporting role in Die Ballkönigin (1975). After guest-starring on numerous shows, including Norman Lear's Es bleibt in der Familie (1971) and Good Times (1974), Lear hired her old friend to co-star on Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978) as Gary Coleman's housekeeper, \"Edna Garrett\". Within a year, she gained popularity with her character, which eventually led her to having her own series, The Facts of Life (1979). Between Norman Lear and NBC, they gave her the green-light to star in her own show, which focused primarily on the housekeeper of an all-girls school. The spinoff series featured newcomers including Kim Fields as \"Tootie\" and Lisa Whelchel as rich spoiled brat \"Blair Warner\".\n\nBefore then, she approached young Mindy Cohn at Westlake School in Los Angeles, and suggested that she take the role of smart \"Natalie Green\", a character Rae created for her and named after one of her best friends from high school. Cohn stayed on the show for eight seasons. Rae left the show in 1986 reportedly owing to a health issue. She reportedly created the role of \"Beverly\" for her old friend, Cloris Leachman, to play on The Facts of Life (1979) after she left the show.\n\nShe returned to the stage. In 1992, she was the voice of \"Aunt Christine Figg\" in Tom und Jerry: Der Film (1992) and appeared in \"The Vagina Monologues\" in New York. In 2000, she starred as \"Berthe\" in the Paper Mill Playhouse production of \"Pippin\". In 2007, she appeared in a cabaret show at the Plush Room in San Francisco for several performances. In the 2008 movie, Leg dich nicht mit Zohan an (2008), she played a mature woman who has a fling with Adam Sandler's character. On February 18, 2009, she appeared in a small role as \"Mrs. Ford\" on the \"I Heart Mom\" episode.\n\nRae's older sister, Beverly, died from pancreatic cancer in 1998, while Rae's ex-husband of 35 years, John Strauss, died in 2011, following a long battle with Parkinson's disease. A pancreatic cancer survivor, Rae continued to act while making guest appearances everywhere, especially TV Land, where her show, The Facts of Life (1979), won the 2011 award for Pop Culture Icon.\n\nCharlotte Rae died on August 5, 2018 at her home in Los Angeles, aged 92, from bone cancer, which had been diagnosed a year earlier. She also suffered from asthma and scoliosis, and had been fitted with a pacemaker.\n\nCorwin Anthony Hawkins was born in Houston, Texas on March 12, 1965. He attended St. Peter's Catholic School and graduated in 1982.\n\nCorwin was well known throughout Texas for his hilarious two hour stand up comedy routine which he performed in front of standing room only crowds every Tuesday night for four years. His many memorable characters like: Kelly Kelly, Debra Debra, Fanisha Poontane and Miku Waka were favorites to the Dallas natives, he also impersonated many famous stars like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Mariah Carey and of course Grace Jones.\n\nWhile every performance was totally improvised he held the attention of the audience with many wardrobe changes of beautiful dresses and expensive shoes. As Amazing Grace, Hawkins went against the grain with wardrobe. Opting against the traditional long, flowing, evening gown that was prevalent to many female impersonators of the day, Amazing Grace was known for her immaculate Bob hairstyle, Chanel two-piece suits, and Ferragamo shoes. The look was less pageant queen, and more 'ladies who lunch'. Yet the look was a clever contrast to the wild, untamed fireball comedy that would unfold over the course of a show.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to get a table near the front you can be sure to be brought up on stage as a prop for the rest of the night. You would be held prisoner to his wild and zany antics and may be forced to sing, dance or even talk you into taking off your clothes to the delight of everyone. Many famous people who attended his shows while they were visiting Dallas included Keith Carradine, Lucy Arnaz and Grace Jones to name a few.\n\nCorwin won many female impersonator competitions. In 1991, as Amazing Grace, was crowned Miss Gay Texas. The next year he took the title of Texas Entertainer of the Year and went on to capture the 1992 National Entertainer of the Year title in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCorwin was discovered by Keenan Ivory Wayans while appearing on Def Comedy Jam, B.E.T. and HBO Comedy specials. Corwin accepted the role of (Wayman), a part originally written for Ms. RuPaul. He was also awarded an invitational tryout at the L. A. Improv.\n\nCorwin passed away on August 5, 1994 at Baylor Hospital in Dallas Texas of Pneumonia. He was 29 years old.\n\nGeorge Cole OBE was a veteran British film, television and stage actor whose impressive career spanned over 60 years. For many, he will perhaps be best remembered for playing one of the most endearing characters of recent times on British television, \"Arthur Daley\", the shifty but very likable \"business man\" in the hit ITV drama series, Der Aufpasser (1979).\n\nHowever, Cole had long been a household name well before \"Minder\" aired on television. His successful film career began in the 1940s, appearing with Alastair Sim and Sir John Mills in the film Cottage to Let (1941). Further success came throughout the 1950s and 1960s, where he played the part of \"Flash Harry\" in the popular \"St Trinians\" films, alongside his close friend and mentor, Alastair Sim. By 1963, Hollywood had recognized the talents of Cole and he was cast in the iconic film, Cleopatra (1963), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison. During the 1970s, George continued to star in films and television programmes, becoming a regular and sought after actor. It is interesting to note that, in 1971, he appeared with Dennis Waterman (who would later become his Der Aufpasser (1979) co-star) in the horror film, Die Nacht des kalten Grauens (1971). In 1979, Cole was cast as the hapless \"Arthur Daley\", a self-professed entrepreneur in the ITV drama Der Aufpasser (1979), a role he played until 1994. The role showcased Cole's acting prowess and brought him to the attention of a younger audience.\n\nAs well as starring in Der Aufpasser (1979), George continued with other projects in film and television, including Root Into Europe (1992), An Independent Man (1995), Mary Reilly (1996), Dad (1997), Station Jim (2001), Bodily Harm (2002) and, alongside his good friend Dennis Waterman, in the BBC hit drama, New Tricks - Die Krimispezialisten (2003). He also starred in several stage productions. It is hoped that Cole will not be be remembered simply for portraying \"Arthur Daley\", but instead for being one of Britain's most enduring actors, one of only a handful of actors who can claim to have had a 60-year career and for being an extremely likable, charismatic man."
