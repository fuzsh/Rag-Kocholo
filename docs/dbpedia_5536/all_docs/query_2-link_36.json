        "text": "On a recent trip to visit extended family, Cjala Surratt ’22, Syracuse University alumna and founder of the Black Citizens Brigade, was presented with a gift– her late grandmother’s boiler room jacket. Surratt’s grandmother had been a ship-fitter in Norfolk, Virginia, and the clothing item had been a welcome surprise for Surratt, a vintage clothing fanatic.\n\nEven more surprising than the jacket, however, was the history behind the woman who wore it. “Did you know she was the first Black female union leader for the shipyard?” a relative asked Surratt during her visit. Surratt’s grandmother, who had stepped up to do the job no one else wanted, had been trailed by a security detail at the time, as the owners of the commercial port were against unionization.\n\n“I was like, wait, what?” says Surratt. “This is exactly what I mean– that clothes can be the prompt for these broader stories.”\n\nFor Suratt, clothes have always been a conduit for storytelling. Following her graduation from Syracuse University and ten subsequent years spent as the Director of Marketing for Light Work, the University’s nonprofit photography studio, Suratt opened the Black Citizens Brigade, a downtown storefront dedicated to amplifying Black history through clothes, books, and art.\n\n“For Black and brown people, or those who’ve historically experienced economic disparity, upcycling has always been an economic imperative,” says Surratt. “I think I’m part of continuing that legacy.”\n\nLegacy is the through line of Surratt’s work. Her love of vintage clothing came from growing up in a family of seamstresses, milliners, and creatives. During the early days of COVID-19, Surratt and her daughter would peruse the racks of Goodwill, one of the few businesses open at the time. With many elders being pushed into nursing homes, the pandemic made thrift stores abundant with discarded clothes from families cleaning out their parents’ closets, says Surratt.\n\nOnce her home began overflowing with garments from thrifting trips, she decided it was time to finally take the leap and pursue establishing her own shop. After months of working with the Syracuse Downtown Committee, scouring listings for vacant storefronts, and organizing her collection, Surratt opened the Black Citizens Brigade in June of 2023 and has been providing downtown Syracuse with an eclectic mix of clothing, culture, and community ever since.\n\nToday, Black Citizens Brigade sells hard-to-find items that center on Black history, specializing in clothes from the 1950s-1980s, along with vintage books, magazines, and records. The time period of the clothes is an ode to Surratt’s fascination with the aesthetics of that time, while the book selections represent her commitment to education.\n\n“The clothes and the books are prompts for larger conversations about race, culture, history, and gender,” says Surratt. “And so, the books all center on Black community, Black history, Black culture.”\n\nSurratt’s blending of learning through culture stretches back to her time at Syracuse University, where she studied Stage Theatre through the College of Visual and Performing Arts and minored in Cultural Anthropology and Psychology. Later on, she came back as a continuing education student to finish credits part-time through the College of Professional Studies. She credits specific parts of her education, such as doing character studies that involved thinking about the history of trends, as helping her in her current career.\n\n“The common thread is understanding people– a desire to know why people arrive at the choices they make, and also a deep curiosity about culture and community,” she says.\n\nSince its opening, Black Citizens Brigade has Surratt’s community to thank for the store’s success. She’s leveraged her upbringing in Syracuse and attendance and former job at the University to bring more attention to her space.\n\nDowntown, where businesses founded by BIPOC owners statistically don’t last as long as businesses with white business owners, is where the physical storefront is located, Surratt says. However, Surratt knows that being a visible part of the community beyond the brick-and-mortar is crucial, as it shares the message that Black and brown businesses are here to stay.\n\n“We’re at a very pivotal time in our city to bring the message,” says Surratt.\n\nLooking forward, Surratt hopes to expand her storefront and host interactive events, such as poetry workshops and listening sessions. In her store lined with archival photos of Black domestic life, Surratt is aiming to cultivate a feeling of homecoming for all who enter.\n\n“I want it to feel like you’re coming into a Black family photo album.”\n\nBy Isabel Bekele\n\nThe next time you spread a pat of butter on toast, smile then give a nod to local artist and sculptor Sharon BuMann, VPA ‘84. Over many years, the Syracuse University graduate used the malleable, edible element to form numerous beloved sculptures commissioned by the New York State Fair.\n\nDriving around Syracuse, keep your eye out for mammoth figures chiseled in bronze or other hearty materials. Sharon’s expert, compassionate hands have either restored existing pieces or created new works to reflect the city’s rich history.\n\nOn Oct. 25, Syracuse Deputy Mayor Sharon Owens presided over a proclamation ceremony at the Jerry Rescue Monument in Clinton Square to honor Sharon in recognition of her lifetime achievements and contributions to the Central New York community.\n\nFrom Butter to Bronze\n\nThe creator of many of Syracuse’s best-known pieces of public art, Sharon earned a Bachelor of Fine Art from Syracuse, conferred by the College of Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) and administered through the College of Professional Studies, in 1984. Previously, she had earned an associate degree in graphic arts from Onondaga Community College. She’s also pursued post graduate study at the Lyme Academy and the University of Hartford in Connecticut.\n\nAlmost 40 years later, “Sharon BuMann Day” was proclaimed by the City of Syracuse. October is the month in which the Jerry Rescue occurred 172 years ago, reinforcing the date and location of the ceremony. Sharon has deep family and artistic roots in Central New York, having been raised in Central Square, just north of Syracuse near Oneida Lake. Her grandmother, also an artist, gave 11-year-old Sharon her first sketch book.\n\nYears later, Sharon designed and created the Jerry Rescue Monument, commemorating the rescue of fugitive slave William “Jerry” Henry when citizens of Syracuse stormed his jail cell in 1851 and helped him escape to freedom in defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nAmong other works in Syracuse, she also created the Elizabeth “Libba” Cotten statue on the city’s southside, honoring the world-renowned folk and blues singer from North Carolina who decided to live out her days in the city. Sharon formed the Mountain Goat Monument in Upper Onondaga Park that celebrates the annual 10-mile run and was involved in the exterior structural design of the Onondaga County War Memorial that pays tribute to veterans in Syracuse and around the world, for which she and her team received the ACI Grand Award of Excellence.\n\nArtistic Values and Virtues\n\nIn addition to creating her artistic works, Sharon and her husband grew their family to include two children — daughter Amy, a healthcare professional in Western New York, and son George, also a sculptor — who attended the presentation. A graduate of SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry with a B.S. in Environmental and Forest Biology, George, who also earned a M.S. in Wildlife Science from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, shared thoughts during the ceremony.\n\nHe talked about values and virtues Sharon has created throughout her career. “As much of what my mother modeled through her work speaks to liberty, equality, women’s suffrage, and abolitionism, she also wove these elements among her everyday life,” he said. “These still live in the bricks and mortar of the Jerry Rescue monument and other works, but my mother’s ‘invisible moments’ have become cherished memories for those who’ve been able to work with her or share her company.”\n\nInclusivity and Diversity\n\nGeorge further remarked, “Inclusivity has always been a central part of my mother’s personal philosophy, her career, and our family. My sister and I absorbed many of these lessons passively without realizing them, often around the dinner table that served as the impromptu story time for our family. Not until years later would we understand how fortunate we were, as our world was one that did not distinguish between people based upon color, creed or any other orientation. This came with the implicit understanding that we are infinitely more productive, creative and resilient when we work together as one.”\n\nSharon’s Syracuse University experience came first as a student and then as an art instructor in VPA. College of Professional Studies Dean Michael Frasciello notes that Sharon’s outlook about life and relationships align perfectly with the philosophy of the University and the College. “We strive to provide access to the university experience to all people to expand the thinking, understanding and respect we need to survive — and thrive — locally and globally,” he says.\n\nCommunity Partnerships to Create Art\n\nSharon has worked diligently to share her artistic vision in Syracuse and across the country, crediting many individuals with her success as a prolific contributor to the Central New York landscape: Syracuse University faculty and administrative leadership; those in local government who’ve seen the value of the public art scene; and community volunteers and cheerleaders, including John Marsellus and Chet Whiteside, who paved the way for many of the projects that reflect her creative spirit.\n\nThroughout the years, she has continually attended workshops and prides herself on the vast amount of independent study and research that informs her work. Sharon says that “life-long learning is a philosophy I live by,” in keeping with the mission of the College of Professional Studies.\n\nNow in her later years, Sharon is enjoying life at a more relaxed pace, though art and sculpture remain part of her daily existence. “My dream and my choice have been, from a very young age, to work as a professional artist,” she says.\n\nWhile Sharon has created many works using many media, never underestimate what the talent — and passion — of one woman can do as you spread that tiny pat across your bread.\n\nThe Syracuse University-trained, Central New York native holds the Guinness World Record for the largest butter sculpture ever assembled, a model of Big Tex, an icon of the Texas State Fair, that was displayed at that venue weighing in at 4,077 pounds. As monumental as this task may seem, Sharon sums it up simply: “I just love what I do.”\n\nAre you interested in helping to nurture artistic expression in those who are studying through Syracuse University’s College of Professional Studies?

Touted as a “brilliant and moving” story, her book is a testament to what can happen when you don’t give up on your dreams, no matter what stage of life you’re in.\n\nIn this Q&A with Roxanne, learn more about her upcoming novel, why she chose the College of Professional Studies, and what she says is the most important thing she learned at Syracuse University.\n\n1. When did you first realize you wanted to be a writer?\n\nWhen my children went to elementary school, they needed someone to put together the Parent-Teacher Organization newsletter and communicate to parents what was going on at the school. I volunteered. This led me to writing newsletters/articles/training materials for jobs I had. Then, I discovered the opportunity to write for a weekly newspaper. I learned I enjoyed educating and communicating with people with the written word.\n\n2. What year did you graduate?\n\nI graduated in 2010 from the College of Arts and Sciences through the College of Professional Studies. I was the school bus driver who went “back to school.”\n\n3. What did you study?\n\nWriting and Communications. I had been authoring articles for weekly newspapers in my hometown of Phoenix, NY. I very much enjoyed writing and informing people about community events. When I would apply for a job as a professional writer, the person with the college degree would get the position over me. That’s when I knew I needed to get my college degree!\n\n4. Why did you choose the College of Professional Studies?\n\nI looked at several colleges locally in my area, but they didn’t have a degree program for adults returning to school, meaning, many classes for BA degree programs were only offered during daytime hours.\n\nAs a working mom, this was not feasible for me. A friend suggested we visit Syracuse University because her niece was in a writing program there. I was skeptical, but when I found out they offered part-time studies for non-traditional college students through the College of Professional Studies, I started to believe it was possible. The classes were not only offered in the evening, but I could also go on the weekends, and they had online classes as well. In addition, the College of Professional Studies had their own degree program in communications (which included writing). It seemed like a perfect fit!\n\n5. What is the most important thing you learned while studying at Syracuse University?\n\nThe most important thing I learned while studying at Syracuse University is the importance of believing in myself and my abilities. It wasn’t easy going back to school as an adult who was working and raising a family, but I did it! I also learned the importance of volunteering and giving back, not only to my community, but to institutions like Syracuse University that offer scholarships to non-traditional college students. There were times when I thought of giving up, but then I would receive a scholarship to pay for my classes for the next semester; someone believed in me, I wasn’t giving up now!\n\n6. In your program, what did you learn about your industry that has aided you in your career growth?\n\nThe importance of connections. In many of my classes, there would be guest speakers and opportunities to meet people who were in the writing/communications field. Also, there were always talks on campus from alumni who had careers in writing. This gave me the opportunity to understand the importance of knowing what you want and acting on your goals. There is always someone who can help you, all you must do is ASK.\n\n7. Your debut novel, Catherine’s Dream, is set to release on November 21. What inspired you to write this book?\n\nWhat inspired me to write this book was a story I learned about my grandmother when I was going to Syracuse University as a part-time student in 2006. I always knew my grandmother immigrated from Poland to America in 1921, but I wasn’t aware of the circumstances that brought her here. Also, to learn she had a life in a paper mill town on the foothills of the Adirondacks before she came to Syracuse fascinated me. On top of that, something happened to her during the early 1920s in that paper mill town, and it was all over the newspapers from that area. Being a student at Syracuse University gave me access to databases of old newspapers (although there was the internet in 2006, it didn’t have the capabilities it has now).\n\nI used the microfiche machine to find the newspaper articles! When I read the newspaper stories I thought, “I need to write this story one day!”\n\n8. Did you self-publish or go the traditional publishing route and why?\n\nI knew I didn’t want to self-publish because I wanted a professional book to help me build my career as a writer. I wanted the experience of working with a publisher. I even hired a writing coach to help me outline the story and teach me how to author a story people will want to read and a publisher would want to publish. He is a Syracuse University alumni too!\n\n9. How long did it take you to write Catherine’s Dream?\n\nI started working with David Hazard in January of 2021 and finished in July of 2022. Then, I had input from beta readers, did some revisions, and in September of 2022 started to query the story to agents/publishers. I signed my contract in December of 2022!\n\n10. How did your time at the College of Professional Studies prepare you to write this book?\n\nBeing part of the writing program at the College of Arts & Sciences helped me to experience different types of writing, such as technical, video, short stories– I even had the opportunity to do some playwriting. These writing experiences taught me how to research, use new technologies, and organize my thoughts.\n\n[I learned] the importance of telling a good story that people would be interested in, like when I volunteered at WAER radio to report special interest stories. Also, all of the 30-40-page papers I had to research and write for my classes helped too!\n\n11. Every author has their own writing process. What was your process like while writing Catherine’s Dream?\n\nAt first, it was easy to get distracted. I was used to working at a place of business, not from my house. I soon learned the importance of having my own workspace in my home. Having a writing coach helped keep me accountable. Because I had outlined the story, it was natural for me to start from the beginning, for example, chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. A chapter can be anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 words.\n\nEventually, I learned to break my chapters up into scenes, which helped me to finish a chapter sooner. I also learned that I didn’t have to author my book in order. For example, I knew there would be winter scenes later in the book, so I would write those during winter months. I would go outside and feel the icy rain on my face or write about the sound of the snow as I walked through it. I would file those scenes away for later chapters. Oftentimes when I write, I like to use paper and pen, then type it up on the computer.\n\n12. How do you navigate writer’s block?\n\nGreat question! Several ways… like I said earlier, having an outline helped. I learned to break chapters into scenes. When I would write a scene, there was no making it perfect, just writing what comes to my head, then editing afterwards. Sometimes a sentence would stick out and from that sentence would come a paragraph, which led to another paragraph. Another thing I do is journal what’s on my mind (this usually leads to ideas to write about), or I go for a ride in the car. Sometimes I need to pull over (in a safe place) to get my thoughts down!\n\n13. Did you have any challenges when writing Catherine’s Dream? How did you overcome them?\n\nOne of my biggest challenges was overcoming the need to earn a paycheck. If my husband and I hadn’t gotten out of debt and had savings, I would have never been able to write this book. Having financial freedom enabled me to live my dream of becoming a published author. Now that my book is available, I am seeing the fruits of my labor. Through my publisher I was able to order advanced copies of my book and people are eager to purchase them. It seems so surreal to hold it in my hands. If I would have gone to get another job after I lost mine to the pandemic, I’m sure my file of the newspaper stories about my grandmother would still be in a folder on my computer.\n\n14. What did you learn when writing the book?\n\nI learned about the journey across the Atlantic in the steerage of the ship and immigration through Ellis Island. How people lived in America in the early 20th century and what the city of Syracuse was like in 1921 and 1922. I refer to many historical landmarks, including the Mizpah and other buildings in Syracuse that are no longer there. I even reference Syracuse University!\n\nHowever, just like when I went to Syracuse University through the College of Professional Studies, I learned a lot about myself. Such as what motivates me to do what I do and what I am capable of when I set a goal.\n\n15. What is your definition of success?\n\nI used to think success was a number followed by a lot of zeros. It was having a fancy car or large house. But then after I went to Syracuse University, I learned success is about giving back. It’s not about making money; it’s about being able to give the money to people and causes that educate and inspire. Success is about health and relationships. It’s taking care of yourself first so you can take care of others. It’s about having a goal or a dream and acting on it.\n\nTo put all of that into one sentence I would say: Success is about giving back, having the freedom to live a life you love so you can help others live a life they love.\n\nPre-order Catherine’s Dream today.\n\nBy Isabel Bekele\n\nLeondra Tyler takes in the lush landscape at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. She pops into the campus café and orders her usual coffee before walking through the forest path that leads to her classes. It’s her first time studying abroad, but she’s adjusted to campus life with ease. On the weekends, she explores South Korea, while weekdays are reserved for studying sociology, psychology, and Korean literature and language.\n\nTyler, a student of the University’s part-time Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP), is the first part-time HEOP student to receive the Our Time Has Come (OTHC) scholarship. Back home, Tyler is a part-time neuroscience and psychology student at Syracuse University, but scholarships like the OTHC scholarship have allowed Tyler to push the limits of post-traditional learning and take part in studying abroad.\n\n“What drew me into the OTHC scholarship program was that I really wanted an academically focused program for Black and brown students. This has given me a great opportunity to connect with Black and brown alumni and hear about their experiences and their post-academic lives,” Tyler says. “Although I just got the scholarship this semester, it’s been really nice knowing that I have a support system, not only at Syracuse but also here at Yonsei.”\n\nA Diverse Learning Experience\n\nScholarships have not only offered Tyler access to an abundance of networking opportunities, but they have also opened doors that diversify her learning portfolio.\n\nWhen Tyler wraps up classes for the day, she heads across campus to a PC café, a popular hangout spot for people to eat while they play computer games. While she waits for a game to download, Tyler orders lunch and reviews notes from her class about the history of Korean cinema. For Tyler, studying abroad has allowed her access to an array of engaging academic experiences and even expanded her viewpoint.\n\n“We’re learning Korean history through film,” Tyler says. “I took the course because I wanted to learn more analytic skills, because that can translate into my research. But also, I wanted to learn more about Korea outside of pop culture.”\n\nHowever, South Korea’s pop culture has also given Tyler a chance to analyze sociology and psychology from a new perspective. As the popularity of K-pop and K-dramas trickles their way into American media, Tyler uses K-pop artists like SHINee and 2PM in the course “Understanding K-pop” to examine global trends and parasocial relationships.\n\n“Studying abroad has given me more opportunities to be creative with different projects,” Tyler says. “Sociology courses I’ve taken in the past have been about Western culture, so it’s been nice to learn about it through the lens of Korean society.”\n\nEmbracing Communities and Cultures\n\nFrom attending K-pop concerts to taking part in traditional Korean practices, Tyler has also learned the value of community and the importance of embracing different cultures. Students from 53 different countries gathered at Yonsei University to participate in the study abroad program, giving Tyler the chance to learn about a myriad of cultures.\n\n“I’m not just experiencing Korean culture but also culture from my friends that I met here that are from Australia, New Zealand, and Germany,” Tyler says.\n\nOn the weekends, Tyler and her friends take public transportation across South Korea and learn about the history of the country through its landscape. From visiting the coastal city of Busan to exploring the assortment of districts throughout Seoul, Tyler documents it all on her instant film camera and soaks up the unforgettable moments. While studying on the other side of the world has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, friendship has made Tyler’s study abroad trip an even richer experience.\n\n“Even though we’re all from different parts of the world, I’m going to stay connected with the people I’ve met here for years to come,” Tyler says. “That’s what makes this experience so special.”\n\nAbout the College of Professional Studies\n\nThe College of Professional Studies is a global, inclusive and future-facing college, providing access to diverse students and learners seeking a Syracuse University degree, credential, certificate or education experience.\n\nAbout the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP)\n\nThe College of Professional Studies at Syracuse University is the home of New York State’s only Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) program for part-time students. The program provides economically and educationally disadvantaged students from New York State with access to Syracuse University through academic support and financial assistance.\n\nBy Hope Alvarez"
