        "text": "SHIPYARD STORIES BIG NEWS IN 2012\n\nBy DAVE KIFFER\n\nJanuary 15, 2013\n\nTuesday AM\n\nKetchikan, Alaska - Much of the significant news in 2012 revolved around Alaska Ship and Drydock, one of the community’s largest employers.\n\nEarly in the year, ASD announced that it had received a large contract from the Alaska Longline Company to build an 136-foot longliner to be delivered in 2013. The news was hailed as an example of ASD’s future as a major player in the private sector shipbuilding that is expected to boom as development expands in the Arctic.\n\nThen the State of Alaska, long ASD’s biggest patron, announced that it was negotiating with the shipyard to the finish the design on the much anticipated first Alaska Class Ferry, a 350-foot, $120 million replacement for the aging ferry system mainliners. This was good news because a role in the final design meant that ASD would have a leg up in the competition to build at least three of the Alaska Class ferries over the next decade meaning the potential of hundreds of millions of dollars being pumped into the local economy.\n\nPhoto rendering of current and planned development.\n\nPhotograph courtesy Vigor Industries\n\nIn 2012, ASD also completed a $31 million ship assembly hall which is now the tallest building in Ketchikan at just under 110 feet.\n\nThen there was a real shocker, when ASD announced it was being sold to Vigor Industrial, the largest shipyard company in the Pacific Northwest. Vigor, which had earlier absorbed industry leader Todd Shipyards, met several times with community leaders and the state officials to discuss the sale.\n\nCompany officials assured all concerned that it would build the Alaska Class ferries in Ketchikan if awarded the final contract by the state. The deal was completed and Vigor became the owner of ASD. Vigor employee Adam Beck, a former employee of ASD, was brought in as President of ASD, while former ASD owner Randy Johnson stayed on as vice president.\n\nBut that was just a prelude to the final surprise involving the shipyard in 2012.\n\nIn December, with no advance warning, Governor Sean Parnell announced he was “downsizing” the Alaska Class Ferry project because of cost concerns. Parnell told Ketchikan officials that he had determined that the cost of the first ship was going be at least $30 million above the budgeted $120 million cost and that the state needed to refocus its efforts to a way to get more bang for the state’s buck.\n\nParnell announced that he had instructed the state Department of Transportation to scrap the past four years of design work on the Alaska Class ferry and come up with a new design for smaller vessels that would allow the state to build two ferries for the $120 million already approved by the state Legislature.\n\nParnell said that he hoped the new design would be finished within one calendar year and that he continued to support the idea of building the new ferries in Alaska.\n\nResponse to the new direction of the Alaska Class project was muted in some Southeast communities such as Ketchikan and Wrangell and openly angry in others, such as Haines and Petersburg. Meetings were scheduled for January, 2013 to discuss the changes.\n\nOther local news in 2012 was a bit more predictable.\n\nKetchikan’s first newborn of 2012, Kyle Izaac Walker Jasinski ,was born at 3:13 p.m. Jan. 1 at Ketchikan Medical Center, weighing 7 pounds, 10 ounces.\n\nSchoenbar 8th grader Max Oaksmith won the District-Wide spelling bee by correctly spelling “harpsichord.”\n\nSkip LeCornu, Donna Frank, Rob Sanderson Jr. and Delores Churchill were elected to seats on the Ketchikan Indian Community Tribal Council in January.\n\nDevin Rossiter, 19, was found guilty by jury on January 24 of second degree murder in the stabbing death of Nick Stachelrodt, 45, at the Vallenar View Mobile Home Park in March of 2011.
