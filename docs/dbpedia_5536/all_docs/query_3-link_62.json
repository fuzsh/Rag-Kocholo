        "text": "The world's oldest man, Juan Vicente Perez Mora, passed away at the age of 114, merely two months before his anticipated 115th birthday. Hailing from Venezuela, he peacefully departed from this world, leaving behind a legacy that traversed through two World Wars and the formidable challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the adversities, Juan's resilience shone brightly until the very end. Juan Vicente Perez Mora's extraordinary lifespan garnered him recognition from the Guinness Book of World Records (GBWR) in May 2022, affirming his status as the oldest living man. A former farmer, Juan's life was a testament to the endurance of the human spirit and the profound impact of familial bonds. His passing marks the end of an era, celebrated not only within his family but also within the broader community that revered him. Freddy Bernal, the governor of Juan's native state Tachira, Venezuela, confirmed his passing and paid tribute to him in a heartfelt statement. Describing Juan as a quintessential figure from Tachira—humble, hardworking, and deeply devoted to family and tradition—Bernal's words echoed the sentiments of many who had the privilege of knowing Juan. Despite his departure, Juan Vicente Perez Mora's legacy lives on, etched in the memories of those whose lives he touched and in the annals of history as a symbol of resilience and longevity. #Oldest #Man #Dies #114 .#247updatenew #LatestUpdate #NewsUpdate\n\nHappy Cinco de Mayo to all my connections! What Is Cinco de Mayo? Cinco de Mayo is a holiday celebrated on May 5 in parts of Mexico and the United States. The day commemorates the victory of the outnumbered Mexican army over the French army at the 1862 Battle of Puebla during the Second Franco-Mexican War. Contrary to popular opinion, Cinco de Mayo is not a celebration of Mexico’s independence. The actual Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16 and celebrates the ‘Cry of Dolores’, the call to arms that launched the Mexican War of Independence. Today in Mexico, Cinco de Mayo is actually a relatively minor holiday, according to History.com. It’s mainly celebrated in the state of Puebla, where the battle occurred, but other parts of the country do not typically mark the day in any major way. In the United States, on the other hand, Cinco de Mayo has evolved into a more widespread celebration of Mexican culture and traditions. Cities around the U.S. celebrate the holiday with events highlighting traditional Mexican dancing, music and cuisine.\n\nIntroducing “Collor d’ Melo,” 244x244 cm a piece that explores the profound and turbulent history of Angola, focusing on a critical turning point during José Eduardo dos Santos’s visit to Brazil. This event marked a pivotal moment influenced by the Brazilian president, which escalated corruption in Angola to the dire levels we witness today. This work delves into the concepts of red and black, the defining colors of the Angolan flag. Red symbolizes the bloodshed during our struggle for independence and the ongoing sacrifices, while black represents the African continent and our people’s enduring spirit. “Collor d’ Melo” is one of my favorites because it encapsulates a personal narrative intertwined with our national history. Growing up in Angola, I witnessed firsthand the impact of these political shifts on our society. This piece is my way of processing and sharing that experience, using art to reflect on our past and provoke thought about our future. I hope this artwork resonates with you and sparks meaningful conversations about our shared history and the power of resilience.

Conquistadors or conquistadores were the explorer-soldiers of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires of the 15th and 16th centuries. During the Age of Discovery, conquistadors sailed beyond Europe to the Americas, Oceania, Africa, and Asia, colonizing and opening trade routes. 2. The story of the Spanish conquest, as it has been commonly understood for 500 years, goes like this: Montezuma surrendered his empire to Cortés. Cortés and his men entered Tenochtitlán and lived there peacefully for months until rebellious Aztecs attacked them. Montezuma was killed by friendly fire. The surviving conquistadors escaped the city and later returned with Spanish reinforcements. They bravely laid siege to Tenochtitlán for months and finally captured it on Aug. 13, 1521, with the Spanish taking their rightful place as leaders of the land we now know as Mexico. Conquest accomplished. 3. During Spain’s 200 years of hegemony, the geography, culture, cuisine, art, and architecture of the New World were permanently shaped, altered or influenced by Spain. Meanwhile the preexisting cultures in the Americas were so thoroughly uprooted, overhauled, or eradicated that we may never gain a full picture of what pre-Columbian times were like. Though Spain is no longer a world power and may never be again, the lasting effects of her influence will like be apparent for centuries to come. #Indonordicassociation(dot)org Indo Nordic Strategic Association, India https://lnkd.in/dDR3r6gt\n\nHAPPY ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST MICROCON — APRIL 11 On this date in 2015, 36 attendees representing 17 micronations gathered in Anaheim, California, for the first MicroCon. This event, which included a trip to Disneyland, became a biennial summit or conference of micronationalists, who represent micronations, described by Encyclopedia Brittanica as “an entity that claims to be an independent state but whose sovereignty is not recognized by the international community.” How easy (or difficult) is it to start your own nation? I examine the modern micronation phenomenon in an article that is excerpted from my new book (publishing date May-June 2024) Quests: Searching for Heroes, Scoundrels, Star-Gazers, and a Mermaid Queen. The article starts by recounting the history of Alexander Hare, who, in modern terms, might be considered a renegade micronationalist. Hare, a diplomat during the British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies (1811–1816), was the self-styled first White Rajah of Borneo. I then ask the reader: How Can You Become King or Queen (Your-Name-Here) the First? Here's the lead: THE REAL FIRST WHITE RAJA OF BORNEO How Can You Become King or Queen (Your-Name-Here) the First? MALUKA, Kalimantan, Herman Indonesia I belong to a small group of people curious about the life and times of Alexander Hare. When we get together, we ponder an improbable question: How did an ambitious 19th-century slave owner, harem-builder, and political arriviste become the First White Rajah of Borneo? The bigger question: How does one become king or queen numero uno? More specifically, how might I become the first Supreme Leader with Wisdom Like Solomon Whose Eyes Spot Prey Like an Eagle and Whose Courage Rivals That of a Tiger of my own country? Turns out it’s a bit like becoming a star baker. Follow the instructions, have some innate talent and creativity, hire a good PR agent, and create a made-for-TV backstory that preferably involves wondrous miracles, military victories, and a direct line of descent from a notable divinity. Add a dollop of anti-establishment vigor, a rambunctious sense of humor, and a bucket of curmudgeon chutzpah, and you’re on your way. The full article can be read here (https://lnkd.in/eaiCfq3S), or in Quests. Quests will be published in May-June 2024."
