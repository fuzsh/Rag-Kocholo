        "text": "It seems that the STARS 2LP (transparent vinyl) will be available in many other countries than the UK as part of the Record Store Day 2021 second drop, due on July 17th.\n\nRelease was announced yesterday on:\n\n– French “Disquaire Day” website here\n\n– German “Record Store Day” website here\n\n– “Record Store Day Ireland” website here\n\n– “Record Store Day Italia” website here\n\n– “Record Store Day NL” website here (apparently available in Belgium too)\n\n– “Record Store Day w Polsce” website here\n\n– Spanish “Record Store Day” website here\n\nLet’s note German website features a negative version of the cover artwork when all other websites are showing the regular artwork; maybe just a mistake:\n\nNo sign of the release yet on the Australian, Canadian, Japanese and US Record Store Day websites.\n\nWe’ll keep you updated if this appears in the upcoming hours.\n\nAs announced today on the Record Story Day UK website, The Cranberries will be releasing a limited edition vinyl of their best of Stars to raise money for War Child:\n\nThe Cranberries – Stars: the best of 92-02 – UK stores only\n\nFollowing on from the reissues of ‘Everybody Else is Doing it… ‘ and ‘No Need to Argue’ – and 30 years after their debut release – UMC are proud to issue for the first time on vinyl a special transparent edition of the band’s greatest-hits collection ‘Stars: The Best of 1992–2002’. The Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with global smashes such as ‘Zombie’, ‘Dreams’ and ‘Linger’ – collected here alongside tracks from their five albums for Island – plus two tracks unavailable on other albums ‘New New York’ and ‘Stars’.\n\nThis vinyl shall only be available on the shelves of participating independent record shops on 17th July 2021 as part of the second Record Store Day UK Drop event.\n\nSpeaking on their involvement in the campaign, Fergal Lawler of The Cranberries said, “We are very honoured that Universal have chosen Stars as a special Vinyl release for Record Store Day. The proceeds from sales are going to the War Child foundation, a charity that do incredible work to help vulnerable children in war-torn countries.”\n\nIndeed the Record Store Day website recalls that, “War Child UK is the only specialist charity for children affected by conflict. They work to support children through their recovery – keeping them safe, helping them learn and cope with their experiences, as well as equipping them with skills for the future. They also campaign for changes to policies and practices to support children in conflict, working with children and young people themselves to demand their rights.“\n\nAlso announced by The Cranberries on their website and socials (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)\n\nAnother happy day for our fellow collectors as our researches led us to discover a 54:22 min audio recording of the concert The Cranberries performed on 9 August 1995 at Nissan Pavillon in Manassas, VA. The recording was uploaded in January 2018 as a tribute to Dolores on Mixcloud’s Jerry Hoyt Radio,\n\nWe were aware this show had been recorded and broadcast on a local radio back in the days but had never managed to lay our hands on this recording before.\n\nJerry Hoyt explains that the show was, “recorded by WHFS and played back on Thanksgiving Day, 1995″. He adds that he, “rescued [the recording] from an old reel to reel tape headed for the dumpster in 2009″. A small miracle that allows us to hope that the full show will one day surface.\n\nThat’s not all, though! Jerry Hoyt brings us some more treats as he also uploaded the WHFS radio interview of the band recorded on 28 April 1999 before the band’s performance at 9:30 Club on that same night in Washington.\n\nThe interview, as we know, also features live performances of “Shattered” and “Animal Instinct”. A lovely treasure not many of us had heard before.\n\nHow not to love Dolores offering the person who stole the band’s guitar at the National Sylvan Theater 4 years earlier to bring it back and come share a big bowl of ice cream with the band backstage after the show.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, in an interview with Kyle Meredith from Consequence of Sound, an anecdote from Fergal grabbed our attention (28:12 on the video) as he was mentioning owning an award that did not sound familiar to us, “There was an award we got actually once, which was like a mini couch, where the button holes would be at the back of the couch were two cds, for No Need To Argue it was.“\n\nTime passed and we assumed Ferg was likely speaking of the US NNTA 5x platinum award, although the description did not quite exactly fit.\n\nTo our greatest delight and surprise, Mike shed light on this mystery a few days ago as he randomly came across his copy of the so called “mini couch” and shared a preview of this gem on Instagram (stories).\n\nAs you may have noticed, we’re not used to sharing the content of the lads’ personal social media accounts, but as a collector database, we decided to break our rule for once as this was much too exciting not to be shared! So here is the photo of Mike’s amazing trophy that was presented to the band members back in the 90s:\n\nAnd this larger view makes us now realize years after that we already knew it before (without having understood what it was exactly) back in 2003… when Dolores’ shoes were throning on it!\n\nWe can easily imagine that we’re not the only ones today who wish we owned a mini Alf Garnett Suite… are we? 😀\n\nThat being said we trust our readers to show respect and common sense, and to refrain from trying to contact Mike who’s unlikely to sell/give his awards…\n\nSpecial thanks to our favorite bass player for sharing this with fans!\n\nAs the Cranberries World team was investigating as to where exactly some scenes of the Just My Imagination video were filmed in order to add this information to the map section, we tried to get in touch with Rick Fuller, producer of the video, who very kindly shed light on this mystery for us and invited director Philip Harder to join in the discussion.\n\nRick explained that the video was filmed over two days, on 27 July 1999 in Poolbeg, Dublin in the area around the Pigeon House Hotel near the old Poolbeg Generator Plant, and on 28 July 1999 in the Ardmore Studios, Wicklow\n\nThe two of them went out of their way to answer our questions and sent us never seen before pictures of the making of the video, as well as pictures of the CD and the microphone used on set, even including the STORYBOARDS. We can’t thank these two gentlemen enough for their kindness and availability.\n\nDo you know what the band’s expectations were for this music video?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – Dolores wanted a visual fantasy, where she can magically step out of a rough Irish setting and into a playful fantasy. But each time she goes there and loses herself in her imagination, she is interrupted by reality.\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind the video for Phil Harder and yourself?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – My wife Isabelle told me a story of walking with a Walkman, listening to music and imagining a surreal world.\n\nHow was the location (Poolbeg Power Station, Pigeon House Hotel etc…) chosen for the shoot?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – Since the Cranberries are Irish, and I recently lived in Dublin, we knew these areas would offer great locations with an industrial edge, all within a few blocks of each other.\n\nWhy did you choose to use such old cars?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – The Citron that the guys drove was a very rare car that one of the crew members had access to. The microphone Dolores uses was designed for the video to match the shape of that car. The rest of the vehicles in the background were designed to make the video feel out of time which reminded me of Ireland in the early 1980’s, or perhaps a classic Cranberries-style music video like the vintage stock footage in Zombie.\n\nHow would you describe your collaboration with the band?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – I spoke with Dolores on the phone after she read the treatment which described her listening to music and falling into an imaginary world. Dolores was really excited to shoot the video with this concept in mind. Dolores is a pro. She made many videos before this. On the shoot we were very collaborative, discussing scenes in detail, including the settings and background actors as well as cameos by her band mates. Dolores seemed to love acting and playing a “character” in the video. She gave it her all to act out the part and always gave feedback on how she wanted to be portrayed. On set I followed her lead to make her feel comfortable in the role. As I recall we discussed in detail every scene we shot.\n\nPhilip & Dolores\n\nHow was the atmosphere on set? Dolores once explained she declined to shoot a scene where a car would have stopped right before hitting her [Interview for German NBC show GIGA].\n\nDirector Philip Harder – Dolores actually shot the car scene and I explained how to do it, (there’s a photo of me directing her for that scene) but for safety we used a long lens and editing to make the car appear closer than it was. Dolores really liked the fantasy we were creating and loved acting the part. She also really enjoyed working with cinematographer Matty Libatique, who shot films for Spike Lee, A Star Is Born and many other well known movies. Matty and Dolores really hit it off on set. At one point we were using an experimental, high contrast black and white film for the band performance. The film quality is either black or white with no gray scale. I was concerned the film would exaggerate Dolores’s freckles and could become black dots all over her face. I brought this up but she referred to Matty for advice. Dolores said that since she and I both have freckles I might be bias. Matty told Dolores her freckles were beautiful and we should exaggerate them. She in turn looked at me and winked, as if to say I told you so.\n\nPhilip & Dolores\n\nDP Matthew Libatique\n\nWhat’s the best memory you have from this experience working with The Cranberries?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – After the shoot Dolores invited my wife and I to her home in Limerick. When we arrived she showed us around her entire property. She was an amazing, gracious host. (I think it’s an Irish trait!) Later we drank Guinness in her private western bar, sitting on saddle bar stools. That night Dolores set us up in one of her guest cottages. In the morning she was leaving for a tour so called us from her helicopter to wake us and let us know there was a servant with breakfast waiting outside our door.\n\nPhilip Harder (center) and Rick Fuller (back) with the band\n\nDo you know how the video was received by the band?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – The band loved it. We saw Dolores on tour in the states. After the show we met up again, Dolores went on and on about the fantasy world we created in the video. She could only imagine the imagery when we were shooting so she was very pleased what we were able to create through our fantasy images and experimental film techniques.\n\nWhat does the song mean to you, and how does the imagery of the video represent that?\n\nDirector Philip Harder – I think the feeling comes not only comes from the lyrics but from Dolores’s unique vocal delivery. Even though this is more of a pop song, I felt the images needed a contrast between edgy or perhaps grungy industrial settings, smoke stacks, rough neighborhoods etc. which can magically disappear by just using your imagination. Reality transforms into animated fantasies of color.\n\nProducers Seamus Byrne (left) and Rick Fuller (right)\n\nAll photos courtesy of Producer Rick Fuller.\n\nA very heartfelt thank you to both Philip and Rick for providing us with all these materials and info, it was a pleasure to (re)discover all these gems!\n\nPlease note that none of the items shown above are for sale, we’d be grateful if our readers could behave well, show respect, and refrain from sending inquiries to these already very generous gentlemen.\n\nSince October 9th, The Cranberries have published on their socials three mysterious teasers stating that something is “coming soon” on October 23rd.\n\nSince many of you have been questioning us as to what we believe is going to see the light of day on October 23rd, we’ve decided to make our thoughts public.\n\nLet it be clear straight away, we do not believe this could be the documentary the band has mentioned several times.\n\nA month away from the release of the “No Need To Argue” 25th Anniversary Edition, we believe that we will be presented with a new video that will serve in promoting this anniversary release.\n\nThe first teaser published on October 9th clearly hints that there is a new “Zombie” video coming out.\n\nThe second teaser, published on October 13th, shows live images from the “Beneath The Skin – Live in Paris 1999” video, which seems to point out that the video is to be a live video of “Zombie”.\n\nIn the end, third teaser, published yesterday, obviously features shots of the homecoming Theatre Royal performance of the band in Limerick in December 1993.\n\nThe video is quite easy to identify as The Cranberries had already released “How” from this show as bonus on their “Beneath The Skin” DVD.\n\nWe also know that the full show was filmed by the promoter of the gig, who is the source of the “How” video, so we have no doubt the footage seen on this new “Zombie” teaser are from the same source.\n\nLast but not least, the promoter of the concert tweeted back in April 2020 that he had found his old Cranberries video files he had been looking for and that we “might see it and some other rare footage at some stage”, hence why we have reason to believe that the band is going to publish a new live video of “Zombie” on October 23rd featuring some never before seen footage from the Theatre Royal concert in order to promote their upcoming anniversary release of “No Need To Argue”.\n\nThat being said, given this video was recorded with one camera only and shows only one single angle, it is likely this “Zombie” live video could feature footage from other shows in order to make it look more dynamic.\n\nTime will tell…\n\nUPDATE – OCTOBER 23\n\nThe Cranberries – Zombie (Lyric Video)"
