        "text": "The skaters and their fans would not be deterred on Saturday, and instead of doing the traditional hill bomb on the Dolores Street hill between 19th and 21st, they just bombed down Church Street from 20th.\n\nHere’s a nice volunteer opportunity: You can win free tickets to Outside Lands by volunteering to help clean up Dolores Park this Saturday. But it will be sunny with a chance of riots and mass arrests, because the infamous Dolores Hill Bomb might be the same day.\n\nThe annual, unsanctioned skate punk joyride known as the Dolores Hill Bomb might be happening this Saturday, and at a community meeting to discuss police plans, neighbors were split on whether the event should be welcomed, or cracked down upon even harder.\n\nThe annual, unpermitted and outlaw Dolores Hill Bomb event is being advertised as happening on Saturday, July 6, and neither police nor event organizers appear to be changing their approach after last year’s fiasco that saw 81 minors arrested.\n\nA freak accident happened Saturday in Dolores Park in which a vendor's pushcart rolled away down a steep embankment and into a crowd of people.\n\nA man was fatally shot in Dolores Park Wednesday night, in a rare event for the area but neighbors say they have been asking for more police presence around the park.\n\nSF is trying to get a class-action civil case thrown out that was brought by teens arrested for the Dolores Hill Bomb last year; the Joe Simitian/Evan Low recount is down to one vote again; and another United Airlines jet had to divert to SF, this time over smoke in the cabin.\n\n‘Barbie’-mania had one more hurrah at Easter Sunday’s Hunky Jesus Contest in Dolores Park, with a perfectly Mattel-produced Jesus Ken winning the title and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence honoring their 45th anniversary.\n\nParents said they would sue over July’s draconian mass arrest of 117 people (83 of them minors) during this year’s Dolores Hill Bomb skateboarding meetup, and that lawsuit against the SFPD has now arrived.\n\nIt's a predictable ending to the mass arrest of everyone who happened to be standing near last month’s Dolores Hill Bomb skateboard rally — the DA is dropping the charges against all but two of the 34 adults arrested in the roundup.\n\nThe controversial mass-arrest of 81 minors (and 32 adults) at the year's unsanctioned Dolores Park Hill Bomb has some parents alleging brutal treatment of teens, but SFPD and Mayor Breed are doubling down on the need for that heavy response.\n\nHundreds of police officers in riot gear shut down the notorious Dolores Hill Bomb event Saturday night, arresting and detaining dozens of adults and teenagers in a chaotic scene.\n\nThe Light House condominiums — the four units that were carved out inside of the domed former Second Church of Christ, Scientist on Dolores Park — have been a thing of fascination for everyone who's looked at the building from the park and heard about its conversion almost a decade ago.\n\nJFC, there were more than 50 Jesuses competing for the coveted Hunky Jesus title Sunday at the annual Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence Easter party, including several ensemble-cast groups with puppets and stage productions.\n\nA 60-year-old San Francisco man is being charged with a hate crime after allegedly chasing and yelling threats at a woman of color in Dolores Park on Sunday.\n\nA couple walking on 18th Street outside Mission High School on Sunday says they were set upon and assaulted by two female suspects, allegedly for no reason, or because they were blocking the path of the suspects' electric scooters.\n\nThe neighbors must be thrilled that the Chan-Zuckerbergs have unloaded their Dolores Heights area home for a reported $31 million, but Google Maps has blurred the residence, because Big Tech does respect certain people’s privacy.\n\nThings really went downhill at the notorious annual Dolores Hill Bomb skater celebration Saturday, and while it appears there were no human injuries, a passing Waymo self-driving car got mobbed, jumped on, and tagged.\n\nWeeks after a golden retriever puppy was mauled to death by a dog at Mission Dolores Park, the puppy’s owners are demanding the attacker be held responsible.\n\nA one-block street in SF's Mission District, just two blocks away from Dolores Park and near the location where two gay men donned nun's habits in the late 1970s and birthed a drag-activist movement and culture, is set to be renamed in honor of a founder of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.\n\nFor parents of young kids in SF, playgrounds have been central to life and sanity in the last year. But one prominent playground, the one at Dolores Park, is closing for renovations beginning in mid-June.\n\nNow that over 40% of San Franciscans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, some of the city's most popular parks were inundated with warm bodies Saturday — sparking mild concern from some local medical experts.\n\nCruelty, subjugation, and much worse took place centuries ago at what we now call Dolores Park, and Supervisor Hillary Ronen wants that remembered as part of the park."
