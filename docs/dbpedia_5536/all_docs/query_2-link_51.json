        "text": "Cirque du Soleil’s International Headquarters (IHQ), located in Montreal, is the unique world-class creative laboratory where creators from all disciplines and hailing from the four corners of the world gather to collaborate on various creative projects. Because of its role as a catalyst in bringing talent together, Cirque du Soleil is able to continually renew itself.\n\nGeneral information\n\nThe IHQ is located in Montreal’s Saint-Michel district, (one of the most sensitive neighbourhoods in Canada), adjacent to the former Miron quarry and the Montreal waste sorting and disposal centre. Construction of the IHQ was part of a major urban development project, the Saint-Michel Environmental Complex, in which Cirque du Soleil represents the cultural pole.\n\nINSIDE THE IHQ – THE CREATION STUDIO\n\nArtists training\n\nUpon being hired by Cirque du Soleil, performers come to the Studio at the International Headquarters in Montreal for a few weeks or months of preliminary training before joining a show. The majority of the artists undergo artistic and acrobatic training while at the Creation Studio.\n\nPerformers come from a variety of backgrounds, including artistic and acrobatic gymnastics, tumbling, acrosport, swimming, diving, dance, singing, music and, of course, circus arts. Some fifty nationalities are represented among Cirque du Soleil artists.\n\nTo supervise performer training programs, the Studio employs close to one hundred trainers from around the world. These trainers specialize in such fields as dance, theatre, singing, and acrobatics. In addition to these coaches and trainers, an interdisciplinary team of highly qualified specialists is made available to each artist, ensuring his physical and psychological well-being. The presence of these experts helps create a controlled and safe environment.\n\nThe training rooms\n\nIn addition to a physical fitness training room, the Studio houses various acrobatic and artistic training rooms to address the various training needs of the artists.\n\nThree acrobatic training studios:\n\nStudio A/B: a 1,425m2 acrobatic training studio that is 23m high. The room is equipped with a technical “trampoline” 18 m above the ground from which acrobatic and technical equipment can be safely hung. The trampoline is made of 38 km of woven metal cabling;\n\nStudio C: a 720m2 acrobatic training studio that’s also 23m high, adjacent to the first room;\n\nStudio E: a 785m2 acrobatic training studio containing a pit filled with 25,000 Styrofoam cubes (instead of a traditional net), a trampoline and a fast track.\n\nOne artistic training studio:\n\nStudio D: a 361m2 dance studio divided into four small all-purpose rooms;\n\nINSIDE THE IHQ – THE ATELIERS\n\nCostumes and their props needed for the various Cirque du Soleil shows are created in Montreal, in the production workshops (ateliers) at IHQ. Specialists of every description (including master shoemakers, milliners, textile experts, sewers, lace makers, carpenters, etc.) devote their painstaking labour to making all of the items needed for the shows.\n\nThe second IHQ building, called the Workshops, was inaugurated in early 2001. In addition to office space, it houses the production workshops: a large costume shop that includes sewing and fitting rooms as well as space for shoemaking, hat making, textile design and a workshop for costume props and special effects.\n\nApproximately 300 artisans are employed in the workshops making some 16,000 or so items (hats, shoes, dresses, bodysuits, etc.) required for Cirque’s shows. It takes close to 50 kilometres of fabric just to make the costumes, 80% of it is processed and dyed right in the shop by the textile design team.\n\nINSIDE THE IHQ – LE MÂT\n\nIn 2007, Cirque du Soleil added a third wing to its international headquarters, to quell a pressing need for more administrative space. The expansion, dubbed Le Mât (the mast), houses eight floors of uniquely-designed office spaces and relaxation areas conducive to inspiration. The building is equipped with a rainwater collection system, which will recover enough water for one part of the complex to function independently.\n\nTHE LANDSCAPING\n\nThe landscaping at IHQ is highly original. Constantly in motion with seasons, the look of the vegetables garden and other gardens evolve just like the company. In addition to shrubs, apple trees and rosebushes, the gardeners also sowed a vegetable garden in front of the building, complete with various vegetables and herbs. Of course the harvest goes to prepare meals at the cafeteria, and any surplus is given to staff.\n\nARTISTS RESIDENCE\n\nSince the summer of 2003, Cirque du Soleil’s International Headquarters complex has included a residence to house artists who are in Montreal for short periods for their acrobatic and artistic training. The building was designed as part of the development of “TOHU,” the circus arts complex in which Cirque du Soleil is a partner.\n\nTOHU\n\nTOHU is the name of the circus arts complex and the non-profit organization behind it. The organization was created in November 1999 through the initiative of En Piste (the umbrella organization for circus arts professionals, organizations, and institutions in Quebec), Montreal’s International Circus School, and Cirque du Soleil.\n\nTOHU’s main mission is to make Montreal an international circus arts capital, but the organization has broadened its mission over time to include environmental and community components: to actively participate in the revitalization of the Saint-Michel Environmental Complex (the second largest urban landfill site in North America) and to contribute to the cultural, social and economic development of the Saint-Michel neighborhood in Montreal.\n\nMore than 15 years after the organization was created, a true “circus arts village” took shape around the perimeter of the Saint-Michel Environmental Complex. TOHU has become one of the world’s foremost hubs for circus arts training, creation, production, and performance. TOHU is sure to make its mark, both for its infrastructure and for its international profile.\n\nAbout Cirque du Soleil international headquarters:\n\nArchitects: Dan S. Hanganu (the Studio), Éric Gauthier (the Ateliers and Le Mât)\n\nInauguration: Feb. 1997 (the Studio), Jan. 2001 (the Ateliers), May 2007 (Le Mât)\n\nTotal area of main buildings: 387,500 square feet\n\nArea of grounds: 807,293 square feet\n\nAddress: 8400, chosen to echo 1984, the year of Cirque du Soleil’s creation\n\nCreation of Cirque du Soleil\n\nIt all started in Baie-Saint-Paul, a small town near Quebec City, in Canada. There, in the early eighties, a band of colourful characters roamed the streets, striding on stilts, juggling, dancing, breathing fire, and playing music. They were Les Échassiers de Baie-Saint-Paul (the Baie-Saint-Paul Stiltwalkers), a street theatre group founded by Gilles Ste-Croix. Already, the townsfolk were impressed and intrigued by the young performers – who included one Guy Laliberté who became founder of Cirque du Soleil.\n\nThe troupe went on to found Le Club des talons hauts (the High Heels Club), and then, in 1982, organized La Fête foraine de Baie-Saint-Paul, a cultural event in which street performers from all over met to exchange ideas and enliven the streets of the town for a few days. La Fête foraine was repeated in 1983 and 1984. Le Club des talons hauts attracted notice, and Guy Laliberté, Gilles Ste-Croix and their cronies began to cherish a crazy dream: to create a Quebec circus and take the troupe travelling around the world.\n\nIn 1984, Quebec City was celebrating the 450th anniversary of Canada’s discovery by Jacques Cartier, and they needed a show that would carry the festivities out across the province. Guy Laliberté presented a proposal for a show called Cirque du Soleil (Circus of the Sun), and succeeded in convincing the organizers. And Cirque du Soleilhasn’t stopped since!\n\n1984\n\nCirque du Soleil is born with the assistance of the Quebec government, as part of the celebrations surrounding the 450th anniversary of Jacques Cartier’s arrival in Canada. The first production, Le Grand Tour debuts in the small Quebec town of Gaspé, and is then performed in 10 other cities throughout the province. The first blue-and-yellow big top seats 800.\n\n1985\n\nAfter performing in Montreal, Sherbrooke and Quebec City, with Le Grand Tour, Cirque du Soleil leaves its home province for the first time to take its show to neighbouring Ontario. It performs in Ottawa, Toronto and Niagara Falls and the show is simply named Cirque du Soleil.\n\n1986\n\nCirque du Soleil takes La Magie Continue across Canada, including Vancouver, where it puts on several performances at the Children’s Festival and Expo 86 and in seven other Canadian cities. The big top now has room for 1,500 spectators.\n\n1987\n\nHaving triumphed in five cities in Quebec, We Reinvent the Circus is performed at the Los Angeles Art Festival and then moves on to San Diego and Santa Monica. Exhilarated by the Californian public's response, Cirque du Soleil is an overnight success. The participation of Cirque du Soleil at the L.A Art Festival is not only an important milestone in its history but also its first visit to its American neighbours.\n\n1988\n\nWe Reinvent the Circus continues its North American tour, after a brief appearance at the Calgary Winter Olympics. Wherever it goes, the result is the same: the performances sell out, and the critics rave.\n\n1990\n\nMontreal is the setting for the world premiere of a brand-new production, Nouvelle Expérience, in a new, 2,500-seat big top. With this new production, Cirque du Soleilshatters all previous records for ticket sales. Meanwhile, Cirque makes its first foray into Europe, staging We Reinvent the Circus in London and Paris.\n\n1992\n\nFascination, a collage of the best acts from past shows, enables Cirque to make a name for itself in Japan. The show opens in Tokyo and then moves on to seven other cities. Meanwhile, in Europe, Cirque du Soleil joins forces with Switzerland's Circus Knie and stages a show in over 60 towns throughout the country. In North America, 1992 sees Cirque du Soleil make its Las Vegas debut when Nouvelle Expérience kicks off a year-long engagement under a big top at the Mirage Hotel. Cirque du Soleiladds a monument to its repertoire of shows: Saltimbanco. Premiering in Montreal, this latest production begins a lengthy tour of North America.\n\n1993\n\nFollowing the successful Las Vegas run of Nouvelle Expérience, Cirque du Soleil moves into a theatre built to its specifications at the new Treasure Island Hotel. A 10-year contract is signed with Mirage Resorts to stage Mystère, a gigantic production befitting this show business capital.\n\n1994\n\nCirque du Soleil celebrates its 10th anniversary with another production, Alegria. True to tradition, the world premiere is held in Montreal. Saltimbanco embarks on a six- month run in Tokyo that attracts a great deal of attention.\n\n1995\n\nCirque du Soleil responds to a request from the Canadian government and creates a show for the heads of state gathered at the G7 Summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Also in 1995, Saltimbanco sets out to open officially the European market. Cirque's spectacular white big top with seating for 2,500 spectators makes its first stop in Amsterdam, followed by Munich, Berlin, Düsseldorf, and Vienna.\n\n1996\n\nIn April, Cirque launches Quidam in Montreal. After finishing its hometown run, Quidam heads off on a North American tour. Meanwhile, Alegria sets out to tour Japan for a few months.\n\n1997\n\nIn Montreal, the inauguration of the brand new International Headquarters is held; the Studio is now where all of Cirque's shows will be created and produced.\n\n1998\n\nIn October, the second resident show for Cirque du Soleil, “O”, takes to the stage of a new theatre at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. This production is Cirque's first aquatic show and an important milestone in the company history. With this show, Cirque is now known internationally. In December of the same year, Cirque inaugurates yet another permanent show, La Nouba, at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida.\n\n1999\n\nA brand-new Cirque du Soleil production, Dralion, launches its North American tour in Montreal. With Saltimbanco, Cirque sets up shop in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n2000\n\nMovie fans come out in droves to see Cirque du Soleil on the IMAX screen for the first time ever, as its large-format film production Journey of Man (Passages in French), distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, premieres worldwide.\n\n2001\n\nCirque du Soleil keeps on growing with the inauguration of a 15, 000-square-metre addition (Les Ateliers) to its International Headquarters in Montreal.\n\n2002\n\nIn April, a fifth touring show is added to the seven Cirque du Soleil shows already performing simultaneously in 2002. Varekai premieres in Montreal, and from there begins a tour of North America. Cirque du Soleil made its first stop in Mexico this year with Alegriá. Cirque’s Multimedia Division, called Cirque du Soleil Images at the time, produces its first television series, Cirque du Soleil Fire Within, for the Canadian and American television market.\n\n2003\n\nThe newest addition to the Cirque family, Zumanity is born in August. It is an adults- only resident show at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. The filming of a new television series—the first to be produced entirely by Cirque du Soleil Images—is wrapped up in the late summer. This unique family TV series brings together acrobatic acts within a dramatic comedy framework. The series is aimed at international television markets, including Canada and the United States.\n\n2004\n\nCirque du Soleil celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2004. A number of events mark the occasion: among other things, a book is launched, entitled 20 Years Under the Sun, which recounts the unusual history of Cirque du Soleil step by step, and Cirque sets the first Guinness World Record for the largest number of stilt-walkers (544) at the same time and place. Cirque du Soleil launches a new resident show, KÀ, in the fall at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\n2005\n\nThe year 2005 is marked by the Montreal launch and world premiere of Corteo, Cirque’s latest touring show.

After having toured for 14 years and being performed before more than 9.5 million spectators, Saltimbanco is reborn in July as it takes off on an arena tour of more than 40 cities in Canada and the U.S.\n\n2008\n\nThis was an historical year for Cirque du Soleil as the company launched three new permanent shows that year: ZAIA at The Venetian Hotel in Macau (China), ZED at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Tokyo (Japan) and CRISS ANGEL Believe at The Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas (United States). Cirque du Soleil also created a show-event presented at Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City in the scope of the 400th anniversary of the city.

For at the end of the day, it is the spectators who spark the creative passions of Cirque du Soleil."
