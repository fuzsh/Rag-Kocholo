        "text": "The American fast fashion company “Urban Outfitters” is selling 5 Cranberries t-shirts instore and online with international delivery available to 70+ countries. 3 for the US market and 2 for the UK/Europe market.\n\nJust like the other fast fashion stores selling Cranberries tees, theirs are all for women and under license to Nylon Merchandising LTD as well… it seems the UK (London based) merchandising company has licensed a lot of Cranberries tees this year (and counting?)\n\nUS\n\nThe Cranberries Graphic Tee\n\nPrice: $39.00\n\nThe Cranberries T-Shirt Dress\n\nPrice: $45.00\n\nNo Need To Argue Tour Tee\n\nPrice: $35.00\n\nUK\n\nUO The Cranberries T-Shirt 1\n\nPrice: £35.00\n\nUO The Cranberries T-Shirt 2\n\nPrice: £29.00\n\nThe American fast fashion company “Hot Topic” is selling 3 Cranberries t-shirts instore and online with international delivery available to 150+ countries.\n\nJust like H&M, they are under license to Nylon Merchandising LTD and one-side print only… and still girls t-shirts (boyfriend fit).\n\n“Paper Dolls” Red T-Shirt\n\nFrom XS to XXXL\n\nPrice: $24.90\n\nThanks one more time to cranfandy for the info and pics (tag and instore)\n\n“Zombie • 1994 World Tour” Black T-Shirt\n\nFrom XS to XXXL\n\nPrice: $23.90\n\n“Film Strip” Light Beige T-Shirt\n\nFrom XS to XXXL\n\nPrice: $24.90\n\nThanks to Fairiris for the photo in real life (notice the very very light beige)\n\nThe Canadian clothing store Sirens/Urban Planet is selling a Cranberries t-shirt as well… unfortunately for Canadian residents only! It’s unclear whether you can buy it online only or in-store as well.\n\nThe Cranberries are part of the “Graphic Boyfriend T-Shirt” collection with the artwork/cover of “Zombie” and featuring among bands like Blondie, The Beatles, Metallica, Sex Pistols, Bon Jovi, The Rolling Stones… to name just a few. The collection is for women and pretty much in the same style of the H&M one. One-side print and notice the tag with the band logo!\n\nUnlike H&M, their Cranberries tee has no copyright (just like most of their band shirts by the way), so we are not too sure this one is 100% official and under license. However, let’s note that the fashion brand is now quite big in Canada with 100+ shops across the country, hence we can’t imagine this t-shirt being a counterfeit one!\n\nColor: White\n\nSize: S to XL\n\nPrice: $16.00 (2 for $25)\n\nSpecial thanks to cranfandy for the info and the last photo.\n\nThe full soundtrack for Netflix series “One Day” featuring “Dreams” by The Cranberries will be released on double vinyl on 25 October 2024 via UMR.\n\nYou can already pre-order it on Amazon UK\n\nPrice: £29.99\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nSide 1\n\nJamie Principle – Your Love\n\nInner City – Good Life\n\nSoul II Soul Ft.

After hesitation and fear of not being able to do it, Fergal said yes… and soon after his very first piece for full orchestra “The Curragower Falls” was born (Fergal finished in late 2023).\n\nNote: Curragower Falls is found in the heart of Limerick city under the shadow of King John’s castle. The falls are formed when the river Shannon drops over a rock ledge at the right tide. When the river is high the volume of water and the combination of low tide turn the falls into a freestyle playground. The waves are usually surfable 2 hours before low tide.\n\nAccording to Fergal’s recent interview published on RTÉ Guide this week, the piece reflects on memories of childhood by the River Shannon, celebrates a city (Limerick) and memories of loved ones, including his father the late Myles Lawler who was a massive fan of classical and opera music, his mother Audrey who passed away at the end of January this year and the late Dolores O’Riordan…\n\n“The Curragower Falls” will be performed on 1 May 2024 at the University Concert Hall in Limerick as part of the radio’s 25th birthday concert. Fergal won’t be performing that day, he was asked to but declined the invitation, hence he can relax, enjoy the show, and hear the piece for the very first time in concert from the audience!\n\nIt’s unclear whether the concert will be live or later broadcast on the radio; possibly live as there’s a mention “Listen, Lyric fm, Wednesday” on the top of the page of the RTÉ Guide interview.\n\nEDIT (1st May): The concert is live broadcast tonight (Wednesday) from 7:30pm to 9pm. Listen here.\n\nIf you’d like to be part of the audience, more details, tickets, and performing artists on uch.ie\n\nSpecial thanks to daffodillament1995 for the RTÉ Guide.\n\nUPDATE – 2 MAY\n\nFergal yesterday at the 25th anniversary concert with Scarlett Griffin O’Sullivan (a musician? or someone from the audience?). Special thanks to her for the pics shared on Instagram\n\nVIDEO: “A moment of appreciation for Fergal Lawler” shared on Twitter/X by @RTElyricfm\n\nThe 2 vinyls in real life, still the front covers we already know and no images of the inner discs and inserts yet. Published on Instagram by user @actionrecords and to be released on 20 April 2024.\n\nUPDATE – 19 APRIL\n\nThere are 2 editions (US & EU) of Bury The Hatchet TCS so far. Exact same content.\n\nThe US edition has a UMe logo and the New York address. The European edition has a different universal logo and the Netherlands address plus a “made in czech republic” sticker.\n\nFront sticker is almost the same on both editions, just a slightly different catalog number (plus or minus double zero).\n\nFirst images of the US version were posted yesterday on ebay.com\n\nUS\n\nEU\n\nUPDATE – 20 APRIL\n\nUnlike BTH it seems there is only one edition for AYL wherever you are in the world, a MADE IN GERMANY edition.\n\nA rare interview with Dolores on the radio show “The Morning X” on 9 August 1999 was rebroadcast on the radio recently (22 March) during the “Best of The Morning X” and shared on YouTube by Cumulus Podcasts, the official account of one of the largest podcast networks in America. The podcast is also available directly on the official website 99xatl.com (look for March 22 – 18:09).\n\nDescription on YouTube mentions, “an interview and performance…” but only the interview (18min long) has resurfaced for now. Let’s hope for the performance to be rebroadcast as well!\n\nTo be released on 20 April 2024 for Record Store Day.\n\nMore info on recordstoreday.com\n\nTracklist\n\nSIDE A:\n\n1.

Not Madonna… and not Dolores for sure!\n\nBelow the cover of a new book/biography written in French, printed by Amazon (France) and released last month. Price: 11 euro. And yes the book really is about The Cranberries. Well…\n\nCW is trying to let fans know everything about The Cranberries… everything… and this book is no exception so we had to mention it. We also never give our opinion as much as possible but this is a bit too much here and to make it simple: DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!\n\nThis book, belonging to the “Culture Rock” series on Amazon France, is very possibly another AI shit, both the only one (fake?) photo and the whole text… even if we can’t confirm it. No author credited anywhere which is some kind of proof. Probably AI generated in 30 seconds just to make easy money like they did with many other artists for that series before. SHAME!\n\nThe online videogame “Fortnite” by Epic Games has a brand new game mode or place (or island in fact, that’s how the different locations/games seem to be named in the game) featuring The Cranberries. Sorry, we are not experts in that game at all, let’s hope we don’t say too much bullshit 🙂\n\nThat new island, just released a couple of days ago, is named “Fortnite Festival” and entering it is like playing games such as “Guitar Hero” or “Rock Band” where you have to play the notes appearing on the screen. Well… pressing the correct buttons in fact, nothing really close to real instruments… everyone knows that right?!\n\nThere are different layouts for the different instruments, alongside several difficulty settings, giving lots of replayability, etc…\n\n“Fortnite Festival” has 30+ licensed songs and includes “Zombie” by The Cranberries\n\nThe base game “Fortnite” and the brand new one “Fortnite Festival” are available free on different platforms (MacOS, Windows, Playstation 4, Playstation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, iPadOS) and include in-app/in-game purchases.\n\nBetter than words, just have a look at this YouTube video, “Zombie” starts at 4:55:33\n\nTracklist:\n\nBad Guy by Billie Eilish\n\nBad Romance by Lady Gaga\n\nBell Biv Devoe by Poison\n\nBlinding Lights by The Weeknd\n\nBrace for Chaos by Epic Games\n\nBuddy Holly by Weezer\n\nButter Barn Moedown by Epic Games\n\nCake by the Ocean by DNCE\n\nCounting Stars by One Republic\n\nCradles by Sub Urban\n\nDirty Little Secret by The All-American Rejects\n\nEmo Girl by Machine Gun Kelly\n\nGangnam Style by PSY\n\nGo With the Flow by Queens of the Stone Age\n\nHighway Tune by Greta Van Fleet\n\nI by Kendrick Lamar\n\nMr. Brightside by The Killers\n\nMy Songs Know What You Did in the Dark by Fall Out Boy\n\nNine Inch Nails by The Hand That Feeds\n\nNothing’s Alright by Witch Gang\n\nParty Rock Anthem by LMFAO\n\nRun It by Epic Games\n\nSave Your Tears by The Weeknd\n\nSuddenly I See by KT Tunstall\n\nSwitch Up by Epic Games\n\nTake Me Higher by Epic Games\n\nTake My Breath by The Weeknd\n\nThe Hills by The Weeknd\n\nThe Search by NF\n\nThe White Stripes by Seven Nation Army\n\nThunder by Imagine Dragons\n\nVampire by Olivia Rodrigo\n\nZombie by The Cranberries\n\nSpotted on thesoundofvinyl.us The Cranberries first album (25th Anniversary Edition) to be released on gold vinyl in early December 2023.
