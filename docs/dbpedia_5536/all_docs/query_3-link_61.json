        "text": "Watanabe was born in the Urakawahara suburb of Joetsu, Niigata Prefecture, Japan on 5 March 1907. He was the first of eight children born to Haruzo and Miya Watanabe, who were farmers. After graduating from an agricultural high school, Watanabe worked for Dai-Nippon Meiji Sugar and moved to Taiwan to help conclude sugar cane plantation contracts there.\n\nDuring his 18 years in Taiwan, Watanabe married his wife, Mitsue, and four out of their five children were born there. He also served in the military towards the end of the Pacific War in 1944. He returned to Niigata after the war and worked for a departure agency.\n\nIn 1974, Watanabe and his son Tetsuo built a new family home, which had about a hectare worth of farm next to it. He also worked on his bonsai until he was set to live in a nursing home. He also presented his work at local exhibitions until 2007.\n\nAfter retiring, Watanabe lived with one of his son’s family until the age of 108, when he moved to a care facility in Joetsu, Niigata, Japan. As of 2019, he had 12 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. In January 2019, in an interview for a local newspapers, he said that the secret to his longevity was to “not to get angry and keep a smile on your face”.\n\nOn 11 December 2018, following the death of 111-year-old Tora Kosugi, he became the oldest living person in Niigata Prefecture. He was less than a month younger than her.\n\nOn 20 January 2019, following the death of 113-year-old Masazo Nonaka of Hokkaido, Japan, he became the oldest living man in Japan, and a candidate for the title of the world’s oldest living man, at the age of 111 years, 321 days. Though several men claimed to be older than Watanabe (including Gustav Gerneth of Germany), none of the claims were officially validated at the time. On 1 June 2019, Watanabe’s age was validated by the Gerontology Research Group.\n\nSubsequently, after his death, it was determined that several men were probably older than him. In August 2020, Domingo Villa Avisencio (of Mexico) was validated by the Latin American Supercentenarians (LAS), he was more than six months older than Watanabe. In 2022, the LAS discovered how Tomas Pinales Figuereo (of Dominican Republic), who outlived Watanabe, was almost a year older than him (though his age is not fully validated yet)."
