        "text": "You have a very distinctive signature look. How did Lynn Yaeger become “Lynn Yaeger”? Describe your fashion philosophy.\n\nIt evolved over the years. It is a very flapper look. Originally, I wore a lot of vintage clothes. I thought that as I got older, I would get more and more conservative, but the opposite happened.\n\nIt was a way of working out my obsession with clothing and style without actually having to pay attention to trends, because most of the time they didn’t suit me. It’s hard to say how these things happen. It’s a very organic process.\n\nI have a two-part style philosophy, and it may seem like the two parts contradict each other but they don’t. The first part is that you should really feel free to invent yourself and wear whatever you want. And the second part is that you should spend a lot of time in front of the mirror to make sure this is the perfect rendering of what you think you want. I really like it when people make a huge effort.\n\nYou are known for your hilarious observations about fashion and everything that influences it. How has humor shaped your view of fashion?\n\nIt’s ALL humor! I mean not all, but I really do try to take the long view of the things, see what’s fun about it, and the absurdities. It’s a question that cuts both ways. I think people like to read things that are funny.\n\nHow do you think you have influenced the New York fashion scene?\n\nI always hope to inspire young people who may be feeling like they are not accepted, or they are a little funny, or they are a little off the mainstream. My hope is that by being so out-there and so much of an individual myself, that will inspire them. Also, every time I see a tulle petticoat on the runway I’m like, “They copied me!”\n\nWhat are your favorite shopping destinations in New York?\n\nI love the Fifth Avenue department stores. I would be lying if I said I didn’t. I love both Bergdorf and Barney’s. I like the Comme des Garçons store. I like the Garage flea market on the weekends on 25th street. I go there every weekend. I’m a really compulsive shopper. I’m in stores all the time. I’m a daily shopper, let’s face it. I don’t buy that much. I feel like I’m there just for the experience.\n\nIf I only had a day in New York, what are the things I must do? Eating, relaxing, anything.\n\nI’m not much of a eater. I would go shopping in the morning at the department stores, and if it was the weekend I would go to the flea market on 25th street. I think it’s fun to just walk around downtown in the Village or Nolita. It’s a great walking town. If you have never been to Century 21, you should go there.\n\nWhat’s your pick for the best fashion people-watching in New York?\n\nWhen the fashion shows are on, outside the shows is great, but the whole town is a fabulous array of people watching. It also depends on what you are looking for: Madison Avenue for rich people all dressed up in the latest styles; Union Square for cute kids.\n\nWhat are your must-haves when you travel? Do you have a pre-packed suitcase?\n\nI have a pre-packed bag with my cosmetics and miniature toothpaste and things, but I don’t have a pre-packed suitcase. I don’t bring the sort of clothes that seem like they would be easy to travel with – I bring all my tutus and everything, and this is further complicated by the fact that I don’t check my clothes because they are too precious to me. I would have to cram all my clothes into my carry-on, and check the other bag with the things that can be replaced. It’s a bit of a nightmare packing-wise.\n\nWhen I was in Paris last spring, it was really cold and I had my one coat with me. All the Frenchies had their cute little fur coats. I was like: “Damn it! It’s not fair!” I was stuck with the same green coat everyday. I don’t plan my outfits for everyday, but the items I have with me are usually fairly elaborate.\n\nWhat is your number one travel destination?\n\nThis is the most boring answer in the whole world. I like Paris, France. I know it’s ridiculous. I like everything about it: the way it looks, the things you can buy, hearing people speak French. I even like it that the French are so mean — it’s more of a challenge. I also like it when it’s not fashion week, arguably even more.\n\nWhat inspires you when you travel?\n\nI like looking at the people when I go to a new city. I travel a lot because I also write for Travel + Leisure. A lot of times I’ll be in the taxi from the airport going to Buenos Aires or Amsterdam, I look out the window and realize I packed all the wrong things – this is how people look and I’ve got this all wrong. I would see people riding their bikes with a big sweater on. And of course I didn’t pack a big sweater. I love to observe these regional differences.\n\nHow about any favorite travel finds?\n\nTons. That’s what I do. I go shopping and buy things. I had a rule for a while to not buy clothes, only accessories, because I would buy clothes and it would not be the right thing. Lately, I’ve going off that rule and bought clothes, some more successful than others.\n\n.\n\nLynn Yeager asks some questions….\n\nStyle Icons Suzanne Golden, Patricia Fox, Lynn Yeager, Iris Apfel and Tziporah Salamon came together for tea and a discussion about their fashion sense…."
