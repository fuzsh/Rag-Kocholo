        "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - Emiliano Mercado del Toro was born when Puerto Rico was still a Spanish colony and trained as a soldier the year World War I ended.\n\nOn Wednesday, having spent just a month as the world's oldest person, he died at his home on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, his grandniece, Dolores Martinez told The Associated Press.\n\nHe was 115.\n\nMercado del Toro never married and had no children.\n\nIn the seaside town of Isabela, he became a local celebrity after he was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for his longevity.\n\n\"We're all crying, but we knew this day would come,\" said town spokeswoman Rosa Luciano.\n\nMercado del Toro, who was born on Aug. 21, 1891, became the oldest known person in the world last month when 116-year-old Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Bolden died in December in a nursing home in Tennessee.\n\nA 114-year-old Connecticut woman, Emma Faust Tillman, is now thought to be the oldest living person. She was born Nov. 22, 1892."
