She now resides at the Kingsley Manor Nursing Home near Hollywood. She had one brother, 2-years younger, who died at age 70. Her Mother, Jessie, died at age 87, while her Father Addison, who was a farmer and a pilot during World War I, died at age 48 of severe arthritis. She was married, and her husband, who was in the Navy in San Diego in 1918 during World War I, worked in Los Angeles as a linotype operator. He died in 1956. They had just one son, Russell, who married for the first time to his wife Mandel when he was 53 and she was 52, so they have no children of their own.\n\nAfter graduation from college in 1912, Elma taught Home Economics in a local high school. Once she moved to Los Angeles, she worked as a house keeper and for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Assistance. She is relaxed, easy going, and doesn’t worry much. “I’m too busy to do exercises,” she said. She never smoked or drank much, but she really enjoys bacon and coffee, and pie or cake for desert. She played the organ for the Presbyterian Church in Ohio when she was 16. She served as an Officer in the Congregational Church since 1935 and was President of their Woman’s Association. Her secret to a long life is “to work hard and have a great desire to accomplish something.”\n\nHer son, Russell of San Rafael, California (North of San Francisco), who is now 78, provided us\n\nwith this Oskaloosa High School Year-Book Cast Photo of Elma in her school play Mrs. Temple’s Telegram performed in the year 1910 when she was 17 years old. She is on the far left.\n\nWe are sad to report that Mrs. Elma Corning passed away on July 12, 2004 at age 112 years, 141 days.\n\nGretchen Cross, 110\n\nThe woman in the middle:\n\nPhoto sourced from ancestry.com.\n\nMay 5, 2018; Gretchen Cross was born in Colorado, United States on September 23, 1892 and died in Vermont, United States on May 26, 2003 at the age of 110 years, 245 days.\n\nLucy d’Abreu, 113\n\nLucy Victoria d’Souza was born on May 24, 1892 into a Mangalorean Catholic family in Dharwar, British Raj (now India). She married Abundius d’Abreu, a surgeon, and moved to Ireland a couple of years before the commencement of WWI. She spent 74 years in Ireland before moving to Scotland in 1985 to be near one of her six children. Her husband was a cousin-in-law of the Queen Mother.\n\nAfter a fall at the age of 106, she moved to Annfield House nursing home in Stirling. In June 2001, at the age of 109, Lucy d’Abreu became the oldest person in Scotland following the death of Agnes Kinnear. She was visited by the British Royal Family on her 110th birthday, in May 2002. On April 28, 2004, within one month of her 112th birthday, d’Abreu became the oldest person in the United Kingdom, following the death of Gladys Hawley. She died peacefully on December 9, 2005, at the age of 113 years, 197 days. At the time of her death she was the 10th oldest verified person in the world. Friends said that until the last she enjoyed food, books and conversation. She attributed her long life to the grace of God and a “customary sun-downer of brandy and dry ginger ale”.\n\nAnna Tecco-Di Felice, 111\n\nPhoto sourced from http://www.supercentenariditalia.it.\n\nDecember 3, 2015; Anna Tecco-Di Felice was born in Abruzzo, Italy on March 10, 1892 and died in Pennsylvania, United States on September 30, 2003 at the age of 111 years, 204 days.\n\nRuby Drakeford, 112\n\nOctober 21, 2003; Mr. Allan Markham, sent us this photo of his Aunt\n\nMrs. Ruby M. Drakeford, who is 111 years old and was born on January 25, 1892. She was born and lives in Durham, North Carolina. The oldest of six children of James William Markham and Ianna Rebecca Leigh Markham, she graduated from Durham High School in 1908 and attended Trinity College (now Duke University) graduating in 1912. She taught school for one year in Mt. Olive, NC before returning to Durham, where she taught 5th-grade at Edgemont Elementary School until her retirement in 1958. In May 1933, she was married to William W. Drakeford who died in November 1957. Ruby’s hobbies included playing bridge, reading, decoupage (decorating a surface with paper cutouts in a collage), and working crossword puzzles. She was writing letters to her sister above as late as 1996. She still enjoys visits from her sister-in-law, nieces, nephews, cousins, former students and her friends from the First Baptist Church, who arrange for her birthday celebration each year at the nursing home where she has lived since May 1991.\n\nIn the left of the photo above is Ruby’s sister, Katherine Markham Johnson of Fuquay Varina, NC. At the time, Mrs. Johnson was 93 years old, but she died unexpectedly on December 24, 2002.

Thus, he is the oldest Swedish man on record (discounting emigrants to the USA). The second picture on the right shows him being interviewed on the occasion of his 110th birthday by a reporter from Radio Holland.\n\nThe above black-and-white photo taken sometime between [1900 – 1910] shows Anders as a young man along with his siblings standing in back of their parents: Severin and Josefina. Anders is the taller boy. His brother is Gustaf. Sisters are Anna, Jenny, Emma, Alvina, and Selma from left to right. Their country house in back of them burned down in 1952. Also, Anders has a son named Evald.\n\nNovember 6, 2003; Anders Engberg died today at age 111 years, 128 days.

Despite feeling tired for some months, he nevertheless gave interviews to the media to mark his 111th birthday, surrounded by family and friends. Although his eyesight was failing, he was able to follow what was going on in the world by listening to the radio. Born into a family of eight, he earned his living as a farmer. His wife Gerda died in a traffic accident in 1966, and two of his four sons have died of cancer. He is survived by two Sons, eight Grandchildren, and nine Great Grandchildren.\n\nsa/ss/jfs\n\nMabel Frary, 111\n\nMay 28, 2015; Mabel Frary was born in Caistor, England, United Kingdom on September 16, 1892 and passed away in Grimsby, England, United Kingdom on March 13, 2004 at the age of 111 years, 179 days.\n\nSumi Fujiki, 111\n\nAged 109:\n\nOctober 23, 2016; Sumi Fujiki was born in Japan on September 10, 1892 and died in Hyogo, Japan on August 27, 2004 at the age of 111 years, 352 days.\n\nLilla De Geronimi Zinara, 111\n\nAugust 6, 2003; Mr. Giovanni Alunni, our correspondent from Italy, has sent us this photo by way of Ms. Deiva Marina of….\n\nSra.

He lives at a nursing home near Arendal, Norway. Olav reportedly goes to bed around 9:00 PM. He is reported to be astonished that his cousin Nils Neslaud, age 102, still lives on his own farm. Last December, Olav sent a Christmas card to Mr. Engberg in Sweden (see photos of Anders Engberg above). I don’t know if they can read each other’s languages, however, so some translation from Norwegian to Swedish may have been needed!\n\n[ Editor’s Note: Mr. N. B. Macdonald informs us that translation between Norwegian and Swedish is not really necessary; since with a little exposure to the ‘other’ language, they are mutually understandable. “When these two men were born, the two countries still shared one King (Swedish). Norway will celebrate its independence (100th-year Anniversary) in a couple of years.”]\n\nOlav is reported to have an exceptionally good memory and told everyone how he felt on New Year’s Day January 1, 1900 and vividly remembers the Boer War (c. 1902).

Therefore, Mr. Robert Young has just sent us this photo of\n\nCamille Loiseau, France’s oldest person since at least March 27, 2005 (after the passing of Anne Primout, 114).

Russell, age 110. Madge was born on October 31, 1892 (Halloween) in Guthrey, Oklahoma. She has lived in the Los Angeles Area for over 55 years and at the Solheim Lutheran Home since 1989. Her documentation is sparse, however, so it will take us some time to validate her based on data from her only living relative, a Niece. Mrs. Norma Heaton, Executive Director of the Solheim Lutheran Home in the photo above was very helpful, since Madge is blind and nearly deaf, as well as bound to a wheel chair. Madge has a strong personality, nevertheless, and she did appreciate having me as a visitor. She made me spell my name three times, until she got it right.\n\nMay 29, 2005; We have just learned that Madge Russell passed away today at the age of 112 years, 210 days.\n\nSusie Shaffer, 110\n\nWith her husband on their 50th wedding anniversary, aged 71:\n\nThis photo was sourced from ancestry.com.\n\nJune 10, 2019; Susie Shaffer was born in Ohio, United States on April 29, 1892 and died in the same state on October 2, 2002 at the age of 110 years, 156 days.\n\nHaru Shimazu, 112\n\nMay 28, 2015; Haru Shimazu was born in Japan on July 7, 1892 and passed away in Kanagawa, Japan on December 14, 2004 at the age of 112 years, 160 days.\n\nJulia Sinedia-Cazour, 113\n\nAn undated photo:\n\nAged 109:\n\nMay 28, 2015; Julia Sinedia-Cazour was born in Reunion (an overseas department of France) on July 12, 1892 and passed away in the same department on October 6, 2005 at the age of 113 years, 86 days. At the time of her death, Sinedia-Cazour was the oldest verified African person ever and the second oldest living French person, after Camille Loiseau. Her African longevity record was broken by Maria Diaz in 2011 but she remains the oldest person ever born in Reunion.\n\nSinedia-Cazour married Pierre Sinediain 1915 and had two children. Marked by a strong religious conviction, Marie-Julia SinÃ©dia was a very devout woman who regularly walked to mass until the age of 98. She was also a courageous political activist and militant for the Reunion Communist Party. Her professional career covered an array of jobs including periods working in the fields, as a maid for aristocratic landowners, as a dressmaker and as a seamstress at the Saint Louis Hospital. Marie-Julia SinÃ©dia also was an activist and militant for the Communist Party of Reunion.\n\nAt the age of 112, Sinedia-Cazour still remained lucid, retained an excellent memory and kept abreast of the news. Her longevity might be partially attributed to a personal optimism: “This is someone who has given a lot of love in her life and who always positive,” said one of the nurses at her nursing home. “She has very strong family values. She is modest, devout, shows wisdom and solidarity with other residents of the nursing home.” Sinedia-Cazour outlived both her children.\n\nAnna Stephan, 111\n\nAs a young woman:\n\nIn 1923, sitting on a chair whilst accompanied by her brother and oldest daughter:\n\nAs an older woman:\n\nAged 111:\n\nThe first three photos were sourced from http://wenzel-orf.de and the final two photos were provided by Robert Young.\n\nMarch 17, 2017; Anna Stephan was born in Altenteich, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic) on March 25, 1892 and died in Bavaria, Germany on August 3, 2003 at the age of 111 years, 131 days.\n\nShe had 11 siblings when her father died in 1898.

Zion Church in Hartford, this week officially became the oldest living American and the third oldest living person in the world, according to church officials. At the time of her inclusion earlier this year in The 2007 Guinness Book of World Records, she was the third oldest living American and the sixth oldest living person in the world. Tillman, born November 22, 1892, became the oldest living American following the death of Elizabeth Bolden of Tennessee on December 11th.\n\nCurrently residing in East Hartford, Tillman has been a member of the church for 91 years. Occasionally, she still attends worship services at Metropolitan. John B. Stewart of Hartford, the first African-American Fire Chief in New England, is her Grandnephew.\n\nWe regard her as the mother of the church, indeed the A.M.E. Zion Church. Having attained this milestone, Mrs. Faust is the oldest member of our denomination. We can all benefit from the lessons of her exemplary life, her longevity, and her contributions to Connecticut and our community life,” said The Rev. Terry L. Jones, Sr., Senior Pastor of Metropolitan.\n\nTillman joined the church in 1915. She served as President of the Chancel Choir for 15 years and church Secretary for 13 years. Born to sharecroppers on a plantation in Sedalia, NC, she moved to Connecticut with her family in 1900. In her earlier years, she worked as a servant for the late actress Ms. Katharine Hepburn.\n\nTillman is featured in the church’s 2005-2006 Pictorial Journal. She is described as a sharp witted, energetic woman who never minced words. When asked about the secret of her longevity, Tillman replied, “If you enjoy doing the things you do and do the things you enjoy, that’s a good life!\n\nJanuary 1, 2006; We have just received this photo of\n\nMrs. Emma Tillman born November 22, 1892 in North Carolina and currently, at age 113 years, lives in Hartford, CT.\n\nMrs. Emma Faust Tillman rests as her daughter, Marjorie Tillman, helps prop her head back, at the Riverside Health and Rehabilitation Center in East Hartford, CT on Wednesday, January 24, 2007.
