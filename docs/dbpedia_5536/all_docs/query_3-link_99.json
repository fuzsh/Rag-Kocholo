Interment was held in the Washington Cemetery in Gravity. In lieu of flowers the family requests memorials be given in his name. Memories can be shared with the family on our website at www.ritchiefuneralhome.com under Obituaries. Arrangements were entrusted to the Ritchie Funeral Home of Bedford.\n\nOtis \"Odie\" was born July 6, 1940 to Leonard and Marie (Jackson) Perdew in Gravity, Iowa. The second child of six, he lived in and attended school throughout southwest Iowa, graduating in 1959 from the last graduating class at Conway High School. As the oldest boy of the brood, Odie's childhood is riddled with stories of mischief and orneriness and many times, he was the ringleader. A favorite childhood story always told on Odie was when he and his siblings nearly burned down the barn by burning away cobwebs inside the hay tunnels - rest assured, yet another spanking was had by all.\n\nAfter graduation, he went off to work, and in his travels met his future bride, L. Jeanette Small, in northeast Missouri. They married September 22, 1963 and began a family that spanned five children over 21 years. To this loving couple, a brood was born, Chris Annette, Curtis Lee, Lana Renee, Torrie Tee and Amber Colette. His biggest accomplishment as a father was raising five independent free thinkers that followed his example by working hard, doing the right thing, and standing up for what they believe in.\n\nOdie worked his entire career as a heavy equipment operator primarily as a bulldozer driver. He spent several years in different parts of the country working, but returned to Iowa to settle his family. He worked for several years for United Construction in Missouri building roadways, where he acquired numerous lifelong friends. In 1978, he began working for Perdew Construction, owned by his younger brother, Dennis where they worked side by side for 13 years. In 1991, he went to work with his son, Curtis, at Con-Struct in Ames, Iowa where Curtis continues to work to this day. Odie was very proud of the skill that Curtis developed operating heavy equipment and was not afraid to brag about his accomplishments doing so. Odie worked there until a heart attack forced his retirement in 2002.\n\nOutside of work, Odie was an avid hunter and fisherman. His family regularly feasted on pheasant, quail, deer, and catfish. Everyone would have to admit, that turkeys were his favorite. He loved to ice fish and other winter activities included coyote hunting with his brothers, kids and friends. Otis and Jeanette liked hunting together, so one morning they went out to hunt, with only two shells left. Otis said, âthat will get us three pheasants!â You can guess what Jeanette said . . .well, guess what, they came home with three pheasants!\n\nOdie loved old cars and John Deere tractors, however, he probably most prized his Harley Davidson, and road a lot of miles with his brothers and buddies on the open road. Years later, he spent many hours getting his Harley back into riding shape with his girls, Torrie and Amber, at his side.\n\nOdie appreciated a fine western movie and was probably most fond of John Wayne. He also enjoyed spending time with Jeanette especially their evenings spent playing Bingo. He wouldn't ever admit his soft spot for animals, but his three dogs were with him up until his very last moments.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents Leonard and Marie Perdew and two brother-in-laws Dale Beemer and Dennis O. Small, Jr.\n\nLeft to treasure his memory is his wife of 44 years, L.

She was a very good cook and shared her good food with many. She was an avid reader, enjoyed gardening, shopping, knitting and crocheting. She also enjoyed doing puzzles, watching Iowa sports, Cubs baseball and good âole country music! By far, her greatest pleasure was being with and sharing with the family she had taught to Love.
