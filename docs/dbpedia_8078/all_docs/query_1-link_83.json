Rebirth\n\nOriginal music score for the theatrical play &quot;Ghost Sonata&quot;.\r\nComposed and performed by K., Viola performed by Dimitra Kationi\r\nInstruments used: El. guitar, el. bass, ac. guitar, viola, musical saw, daouli, bells, ashtrays, chains, samples.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost Sonata (Sp√∂ksonaten) is a play in three acts by Swedish playwright August Strindberg. It is a key text in the development of modernist drama and a vivid example of a chamber play. In it, Strindberg creates a world in which ghosts walk in bright daylight, a beautiful woman is transformed into a mummy and lives in the closet, and the household cook sucks all the nourishment out of the food before she serves it to her masters.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost Sonata relates the adventures of a young student, who idealizes the lives of the inhabitants of a stylish apartment building in Stockholm. He makes the acquaintance of the mysterious Jacob Hummel, who helps him to find his way into the apartment, only to find that it is a nest of betrayal and sickness. The world, the student learns, is hell and human beings must suffer to achieve salvation. The play centers on a family of strangers who meet for the sake of meeting. They exchange no dialogue, nor gestures, they simply sit and bask in their own misfortune.",

        "text": "A collective led by K. and comprised of greek talented musicians, 2L8 is a bold project that has come to be categorized by their radical stylistic shifts between albums, while retaining a consistent interest in rhythm and distinct sonic accents and textures. Their music is rewarding, challenging and lurches deftly between emotional intimacy, ambition and uncompromising experimentation. ... more"
