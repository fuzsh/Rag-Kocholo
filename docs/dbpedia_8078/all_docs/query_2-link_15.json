        "text": "Swedish playwright, novelist, and short-story writer, who combined in his works psychology, self-analysis, naturalism, and later elements of new literary forms. August Strindberg was married three times – several of his plays drew on the problems of his marriages. A controversial writer, who suffered from hostile reviews, Strindberg represented the 19th-century ideal of artist as a free personality, unconstrained by bourgeois conventions.\n\nMy souls (characters) are conglomerations of past and present stages of civilization, bits from books and newspapers, scraps of humanity, rags and tatters of fine clothing, patched together as is the human soul. And I have added a little evolutionary history by making the weaker steal and repeat the words of the stronger, and by making the characters borrow ideas or \"suggestions\" from one another. (Author's foreword to Miss Julie, in Six Plays of Strindberg, translated by Elizabeth Sprigge, New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1955, p. 65)\n\nAugust Strindberg was born in Stockholm. His father, Carl Oscar Strindberg, proud of a trace of aristocratic blood, was a shipping agent, but his business success was relatively modest. Strindberg's mother, Ulrika Eleanora Norling, had a proletarian background. She was a tailor's daughter, who had been a domestic servant and become Carl Oscar's mistress. August was their third son; the couple had nine more children. To the poet and writer Birger Mörner Strindberg once claimed that he is a Mongol. He was proud of his cheekbones, \"they were an inheritance from Lappish ancestors.\" (Selected Essays by August Strindberg, selected, edited and translated by Michael Robinson, 1996, p. 242)\n\nUlrika Eleanora died when Strindberg was 13 years old. After his father remarried, Strindberg came to hate his stepmother. To underline his sympathies with the lower-classes, Strindberg entitled his autobiography The Son of a Servant (1886). Strindberg's childhood was poor and miserable – he was shy and family tensions depressed him. Verner von Heidenstam once said that he never heard him laugh. His habitual expression was so severe, he described, that if you met him on a mountain path you would hand him your purse before he asked for it.\n\nIn 1867 Strindberg entered the University of Uppsala, where he failed to pass the preliminary examination in chemistry. He was employed for a short time by the Royal Dramatic Theatre, writing for the stage three plays that were rejected. Strindberg returned to his studies in Uppsala and completed in 1872 a senior candidacy. Back in Stockholm, Strindberg worked as a journalist and finished the historical drama Mäster Olof, about the introspective Swedish Protestant reformer Olaus Petri. It was written in the spirit of Shakespeare but Strindberg also adopted influences from Schiller.\n\nStrindberg became in 1874 an assistant librarian at the Royal Library, serving until his resignation in 1882. He married in 1877 Baroness Siri von Essen, who had been wife of Baron Carl Gustaf Wrangel, and was a member of the Swedish aristocracy in Finland. By the time of the marriage Siri was seven months pregnant; the child died and they had later three more children, one of whom, Kristin, wrote an account of her parents' stormy life together. In En dåres försvarstal (1887, A Madman's Defense) Strindberg returned to his first marriage in a story in which the narrator is torn between adoration and revulsion. However, first the marriage brought some balance into Strindberg's life.\n\nStrinberg´s first published novel, Röda rummet (1879, The Red Room), a satirical story about early capitalism and corruption in Stockholm, made him nationally famous. Arvid Falk, the central character, is an aspiring writer who loses all his illusions, and finally accepts bourgeois family life. With this book Strindberg started his career as one of the most prominent figures in Nordic literature and culture. Master Olof, which first had been rejected, was produced in 1881 and received with enthusiasm.\n\nSvenska folket (1880-82) was an excursion into the history of Sweden. Far from trying to establish himself as Sweden's national writer, Strindberg attacked the nation's central values, official history writing, and made himself unpopular among academic historians. Strindberg's revenge on his critics was Det nya riket (1882), a dissection of Oscarian Sweden. In Denmark he was accused of antisemitism.\n\nTo escape the uproar which he had stirred up, and partly to follow the example of many other Scandinavian writers, Strinberg decided to travel abroad. He first moved in 1883 to France with his family and between the years 1884 and 1887 he lived with short interruptions in Switzerland. During this time he corresponded with Friedrich Nietzsche, and became interested of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Under financial and marital difficulties, Strindberg started to show symptoms of emotional crisis. Feelings of persecution were suppressed by heavy drinking of absinthe. Eventually he started to believe his wife wanted to have him locked away in a mental institution.\n\nWhile staying with his wife Siri in Grez-sur-Loing, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, Strindberg met there Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Other members of the Scandinvian artists' colony included Carl Larson, Jonas Lie, Karl Nordström, Ville Vallgren, and Anders Zorn.\n\nThe publication of the first part of his scenes of marital life Giftas (1884, Getting Married), outraged the Swedish establishment, especially the short story 'Reward of virtue,' in which Strindberg mocked the Holy Communion. The book was confiscated, Strindberg was prosecuted for blasphemy. The trial continued for thirteen days. Strindberg conducted his own defence. Gustaf af Geijerstam assured Siri that her husband won't be imprisoned: the King himself gave orders to appoint liberal jurors. Strindberg, calm and pale, was acquitted. In Sweden the younger generation hailed him as a hero. Getting Married was inspired by Ibsen's play A Doll's House (1883), but Strindberg was more on the side of Nora's husband. However, Strindberg's egalitarian vision of gender roles was radical for its day and age, although at the same time he accepted the idea that celibacy could lead to physical debility.\n\nStrindberg's friendship with Bjørnson eventually grew very sour. Bjørnson first adviced him to go into exile and then urged him to return to Sweden and face the charges. (He tought that the prosecution is the best advertisement for the book.) Strindberg's letter crushed Bjørnson's hopes that his younger colleague would be his ally: \"Ers Majestät! Ert Kejserliga reskript har jag mottagit och skall ha ärän att alldeles förbise detsamma. Kärä bror! Din oförskrämdhet gör dig liten. Behöver du mig för någon politisk humbug, så har jag andra och större upgifter i livet. . . . Var sann! Björnson! Du är falsk som en festtalare.\" (August Strindberg by Olof Lagercrantz, 1982, p. 157)\n\nFröken Julie (1888, Miss Julie), Stridberg's next major drama after Fadren (1887, The Father), coupled one of his favorite themes, the Darwinian battle between the sexes, with a social struggle and love-hate bond. Strindberg wrote it durring his stay in Denmark. The protagonist, Julie, a daughter of a count, allows herself to be seduced by her father's servant Jean. She must then confront the situation, in which Jean, a man on the rise, turns out to be the stronger person. Julie causes her own tragic fate. Unable to arrive at any reasonable plan, she orders Jean to hypnotize her into committing suicide. Miss Julie had its premiere at Strindberg's Experimental Theater in Copenhagen in 1889.\n\nAlf Sjöberg's film adaptation of the play from 1951 was faithful to Strindberg's dislike of fragmentation into the acts. He had already staged Strindberg's play and had experimented with \"simultaneous theatre,\" where the stage was shared by the actors and their visions, or with ghosts. The cinematographer Göran Strindberg was the author's grandson. From 1954-61 he worked mostly in West Germany photographing 11 films, notably Kurt Siodmak's Die Ratten (1955), Horst Hächler's Liebe (1956), based on Vicki Baum's novel Danger from Deer, and Gottfried Reinhardt's Menschen im Hotel (1959), also from a novel by Baum.\n\nAfter completing Miss Julie, Strindberg wrote in 1889 with Antoine's Théâtre Libre a group of one act plays, Paria, Den starkare, and Samum, and returned to Sweden. He divorced from Siri von Essen and moved to Berlin, where he met an Austrian journalist Maria Uhl, known as Frida Uhl, his second wife, whom he married in 1893. Their honeymoon the couple spent in London, but after disagreements Strindberg escaped to the island of Rügen. The marriage became the subject of his autobiographical sketch, Klostret (1966, The Cloister), but he also dealt with marital problems in some minor works, as in the short story 'An Attenmpt at Reform'. In the ironic picture of \"a model marriage\" a young couple try to live together but maintain at the same their independence. They have separate rooms, share expenses and household work equally, and throw away the double bed, \"that abomination which has no counterpart in nature and is responsible for a great deal of dissipation and immorality.\" (Married by August Strindberg, translated by Thomas Selzer, 1917, p. 105) After the birth of their baby, the husband asks himself: \"Didn't she do her full share of of the work by mothering the baby? Wasn't that as good as money?\" And the wife soon gets over the fact that he had to keep her.\n\nHaunted by guilt about deserting his children and attacked by his critics, Strindberg became possessed of a persecution mania. He also suffered from insomnia and psoriasis, and spent some weeks in the St. Louis Hospital in Paris. Between the years 1892 and 1897 Strindberg experienced several psychotic episodes, and recorded his tormented thoughts later in Inferno. Like many other writers and artists of his generation, he was drawn to occultism. At the opening of his Occult Diary, Strindberg wrote his motto, taken from the Talmud: \"Om du vill lärä känna det osynliga, så iaktag med öppen blick det synliga.\" (If you would know the invisible, look carefully at the visible.) ('Mit namn skall vara August Strindberg tiden ut' by Björn Ranelid, in Om Strindbeg, edited by Lena Einhorn, 2010, p. 352)\n\nTurning to painting, Strindberg created in the 1890s seascapes, which have been compared to the works of Turner. His favorite motifs included a vision from a cave toward the outside world and a wave breaking in open sea. With the help of Swedenborgian studies, and adopting the idea that certain people are destined to suffer, he emerged from the crisis.\n\nWhile spending the summer of 1892 on Dalarö, he produced about thirty paintings. His first exhibition Strindberg held in the same year. It was not a success; only two canvases were bought. Alone in Paris in the mid-1890s, Strindberg became interested in alchemy and tried to prove that it is possible to make gold. He was permitted to work in the laboratory of the Sorbonne, and his paper on the nature of sulphur was reported in Le Petit Temps (January 30, 1895). For a time he was respected by the scientific community. He was also interested in monkeys, developing a theory that the gorilla was descended from a shipwrecked sailor and an ordinary female monkey.\n\nFor his neighbor, Paul Gauguin, Strindberg wrote a an insightful letter which the artist uses as a preface to his catalogue. \"I cannot grasp your art and I cannot like it,\" Strindberg said. \"But I know that this confession will neither surprise nor injure you, for you seem to me to be thoroughly fortified by the hatred of others; in its desire to be left alone, your character takes pleasure in the antipathy that it provokes.\" (Paul Gauguin: The Calm Madman by Beril Becker, 1935, p. 259) After stopping painting in 1905, Strindberg built with the photographer Herman Andersson the \"Wunderkamera\", with which he made photographic portraits.\n\nIn the novel I havsbandet (1890, By the Open Sea) Strindberg expressed his fascination with the sea and Swedish archipelago, which he had depicted in Hemsöborna (1887, The Natives of Hemsö), a return to his favorite place of his youth, the island of Kymmendö, where he had began to write Mäster Olaf. \"Now a dark cliff appeared behind the headland of the last rocky island. It was coal-black, the effect of the volcanic mineral diorite. As he drew near, a feeling of uneasiness came over him. The black, chrystallised mass looked as if it had been thrown up from the bottom of the sea, and as soon as it had begun to grow rigid, engaged in a titanic fight with the water, or a thunder-cloud, for it was split into eight parts; sea and ice had washed away the fragments; or, perhaps, they had sunk to the bottom of the sea.\"(By the Open Sea by August Strindberg, translated by Ellie Schleussner, 1913, p. 104)\n\nStrindberg moved to Stockholm and wrote during the following productive years from 1898 to 1909 thirty-six plays. In the Damascus trilogy 1898-1901, Påsk (1901, Easter), and Ett drömspel (1901, A Dream Play) Strindberg made use of details of his second marriage. The protagonist of the trilogy is called the 'Stranger' or 'The Unknown One,' a man on a journey to discover his fate. He has left his wife and children and goes through a series of trials. Påsk dealt with the theme of death and resurrection: a woman lives with her children in fear of the coming of the creditor, who, in fact, brings reconciliation and the remission of debt.\n\nEvery beginner seems to me to be able to write one good act; in that one he is true to life, every word is straightforward, and the action is honest. As soon as he embarks on the writing of long plays, everything becomes labored, contrived, affectedm and false. ('On Modern Drama and Modern Theatre' by August Strindberg, translated by Børge Gedsø Madsen, in Playwrights on Playwriting: From Ibsen to Ionesco, edited by Toby Cole, 2001, p. 20)\n\nIn A Dream Play Strindberg attempted to imitate the logical form of a dream. Time and space are not important in the dramaturgy, the characters split, all thoughts and perceptions emanate from a single individual's unconscious, the dreamer's. Behind the character of the luminous protagonist, Daughter of Indra, who descends to earth, was the young actress Harriet Bosse, who became the author's third wife. The emphasis on subjectivity in the play foreshadowed Freud's theories about the gap between the conscious and unconscious.\n\nStrindberg's series of historical plays from this period included Gustav Vasa (1899), Erik XIV (1899), a portrait of a man who was half-genius, half-psychopath, and Gustaf Adolf (1900), said to be unplayable, in which the king is an instument of the ideal of religious freedom. In the novel Svarta fanor (1904, Black Banners) Strindberg took his revenge after decades of negative critic and condemned with a Biblical fury his colleagues, wrong prophets, and parasites of culture. Strindberg continued his religious and natural philosophical speculations in Zones of the Spirit (1907-1912) and its sequels. Götiska rummen (1904) was written as a companion piece to Röda rummet from 1879, but Strindberg's youthful vigour had gone, and had been replaced by bitterness and misantrophy.\n\nDuring 1907-08 Strindberg undertook a series of experiments in order to establish an intimate theater, based on his innovations on the form of chamber music. He discharged the single protagonist in favor of a small group of equally important characters, creating a drama that would impress by its mood and atmosphere. In contrast to the ill and corrupt characters who people the dramas, Strindberg created an individual, who is capable of perceiving supernatural phenomena, and of stripping away the facades of lies and deceits.\n\nAmong Strindberg's works from 1907 were such chamber plays as Oväder (1906, The Thunderstorm), Brända tomten (1907, After the Fire), in which everything is worse that the protagonist expects, Spöksonaten (1907, The Ghost Sonata), an unmasking of a middle-class pretensions, and Pelikanen (1908, The Pelican), in which the final purgation happens through fire. Strindberg called his plays \"kammerspiel\" after Max Reinhardt's \"Kammerspiel-Haus\" in Berlin. Stora landsvägen (1909, The Great Highway) was Strindberg's final allegorical self-portrayal. Ofter characterized as the author's literary testament, Strindberg himself appeared in the figure of the hunter who climbs down from the mountain – like Zarathustra.\n\nIn 1908 Strindberg settled into a house he called \"the Blue Tower\" and lived there until his death from stomach cancer on May 14, 1912. According to his wish, Strindberg was buried beneath wooden crucifixes with the inscription O Crux Ave Spes Unica. Faithful to his role as an iconoclast and a disturber, Strindberg fuelled the so-called Strindberg Feud from 1910 to his death with a series of newspaper articles on social, literary, and political issues. His major adversary was Heidenstam, whom he called \"Sweden's most unintelligent man.\" Strindberg described Heidenstam's friend, the critic and author Oscar Levertin as his \"greatest enemy\" in his Occult Diary. On the day when Levertin died, he noted that something that had been oppressing him had gone and he fell into a holiday mood.\n\nLike Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), Strindberg never received the Nobel Prize for literature. He had high hopes in 1909 that he would receive the honor. For Strindberg's disappointment, Selma Lagerlöf won the Nobel. However, he had actively supported the Trade Union movement and was awarded its alternative Nobel Prize. The campaign to collect the money, that eventually amounted to 50,000 Swedish crowns, was denounced in the right-wing press. Strindberg wrote more than 70 plays as well as novels, short-stories and studies of Swedish history. His influnce has been wide. As a dramatist he was a source of inspiration to the German expressionists, and to Eugene O'Neill, Eugène Ionesco, and Tennessee Williams, and his impact is seen among others in the works of such playwrights as Harold Pinter, Samuel Beckett, John Osborne, and John Arden.\n\nPär Lagerkvist said of Strindberg: \"And it is a fact that he has meant the renewal of the modern drama, and thereby also the gradual renewal of the theatre. It is from him and through him that naturalism received the critical blow, even though it is also Strindberg who gave naturalism its most intense dramatic works.\" (Modern Theatre: Seven Plays and an Essay by Pär Lagerkvist, translated by Thomas R. Buckman, 1966, p. 24)\n\nFor further reading: Strindbergs Paintings by Göran Söderström (2024); Käre Strix!
