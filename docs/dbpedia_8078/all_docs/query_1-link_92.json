        "text": "Oil on canvas, titled \"Slätprick\", signed \"August Battle Mountain\", 26x32 cm. During a search of Mr. \"M.Sz.\" home in October 2007 was found six counterfeit artwork. An oil painting picturing Edvard Munch, this oil painting picturing August Strindberg and four artworks picturing Egon Schiele. On the reverse has been affixed an envelope from a major auction house. In the envelope was kept a book about Strindberg, which together with the handwritten text on the back of the painting leads to the impression that the painting is \"Slätprick No. 19\" as well as a statement from the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce where the name August Strindberg been written in with pen. Mr. M.Sz. states that he can not remember, but \"probably\" bought the painting in 1975 from an antique dealer in Stockholm and that he later gave a \"guy\" in the task of trying to sell the painting. the Court: Mr. MSZ has provided the painting with fake provenance, texts, labels, notes, and documents with the intent to make the painting appear to be genuine. Of inquiry and investigation that both the painting as a signature is not an original work of August Strindberg. The crime is serious fraud with intent to lull prospective buyers that this is an authentic works of August Strindberg. Criminal sanctions, one year in prison.\n\nThis painting, signed \"A. Strindberg,\" has nothing to do with the artwork that föfattaren and painter August Strindberg performed. The motif of the sea and sky meet in a horizon has been carried out for the artist completely different way in terms of technology and color planning. The painting is not a painting of Arnold Strindberg. After Experts investigation and judgment declared that the painting not genuine. It is a forgery."
