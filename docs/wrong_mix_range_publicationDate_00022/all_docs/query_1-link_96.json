        "text": "Rain may have postponed the Classic Golf Car Butte Creek Spring Opener back in March, but a little heat didn’t deter it from being held last Saturday. First on the agenda was the Shootout Friday afternoon prior to the evening dinner, followed by the tournament on Saturday. The field was divided into three flights, based on total team handicap, for the Modified Stableford, Two-Man Better-Ball format. However, players could select the tees they desired to play, either black or white, with handicaps adjusted accordingly.\n\nStableford points are shown. First flight low gross: Brian Jones and Steve Sundquist, 47. Net: 1, Michael Lafaye and Eric Blofsky, 58; 2, Justin Bowman and Andy Poyner, 53; 3, Royal Hawkley and Ben Pollock, 51; 4, tie, Derek Minetti and Dom Benedet, Rob Sylvester and Brian McGovern, Mike Janke and Brandon Harris, 50.\n\nSecond flight: 1, Jeff Mimbs and Bodie Shepherd, 55; 2, Kevin Milliken and Michael Neuliep, 53; 3, Chas Gower and Mike Wear, 51; 4, Jerry Hight and Steve Gonsalves, 50. Third flight: 1, Chad Parker and Tanner Parker, 65 (overall net winner); 2, Scott Hamm and Alex Hamm, 59; 3, Matt Davis and Mike Sohnrey, 56.\n\nClosest to pin contest: Hole No. 3: 1, Tom Lando (way to go Tom); 2, Pollock. Hole No. 6: 1, Hawkley; 2, Pat Goodwin. Hole No. 12: 1, Hight; 2, McGovern; Hole No. 17: 1, Gonsalves; 2, Alex Hamm.\n\nFriday shootout results: First flight black tees , 6,600 yards: 1, Justin Bowman and Andy Poyner; 2, Mike Bechtol and Mark Blofsky; 3, Royal “Aire” Hawkley and Ben Pollock. Second flight black tees: 1, Michael Lafaye and Eric Blofsky; 2, Aaron Rogers and Billy Rogers; 3, tie, Kevin Milliken and Michael Neuliep along with Bob Collier and Rodney Henry. White tee flight, 5,500 yards: 1, Chad Parker and Tanner Parker; 2, Bob Leckinger and Bodie Shepherd; 3, Chas Gower and Mike Wear.\n\nNote: In medal or stroke play the goal is to have the lowest score. In a Stableford format the incentive is to get the highest score. The difference between Stableford scoring and Modified Stableford scoring is as follows: Stableford: Double Eagle, 5 pts.; Eagle, 4 pts.; Birdie, 3 pts.; Par, 2 pts.; Bogey, 1 pt.; Double Bogey or higher, 0 pts. Modified Stableford: Double Eagle, 9 pts.; Eagle, 7 pts.; Birdie, 4 pts.; Par, 2 pts.; bogey, 1 pt. Double Bogey, minus 1 pt.; Triple Bogey or higher, minus 3 pts. However, the point allocations for a Modified Stableford format can be adjusted a little at the option of the tournament director. The Modified version encourages the players to play more aggressively, because the rewards are greater.\n\nThe “Spring” Opener results shuffled the Player-of-the-Year standings around a little. The top six leaders are currently: 1, Aaron Rogers; 2, Andy Poyner; 3, Steve Christophel; 4, Ben Knight; 5, Brian Jones; 6, Chas Gower.\n\nThe Butte Creek Senior Men’s Club enjoyed another good turnout for its weekly outing and played a 4-Man, 2-Best Ball format. The field was divided into two flights based on handicap. First flight: 1, Jim Westcott, Dave Harrison, Dave Smith and Steve Haws, 125; 2, Ed Anderson, John Olsen, Cliff Kitayama and Don Krysakowski, 126; 3, Randy Holt, Greg Martin, Jeff Fontana and Henry Brown, 127. Second flight: 1, Scott Chalmers, Denny Varley, Carl Martellaro and Art Gausemel, 130; 2, Ray Parker, Mike Strick, Lew Sanchez, Mike Lim and Marc Richmond (5-some), 134.\n\nBidwell Park Golf Course\n\nThe Bidwell Park Women’s Golf Club added a little spice to its weekly tournament last week, playing a Two-Player Chapman format. Low gross over the field was the team of Debi McDermont and Gayle Aylward, with a score of 82. Overall low net was a tie between the teams of Sue Blizman and May Gallaway, along with the team of Barbara Albers and Pam Coleman at 63.5. First flight: 1, Pat Van Dyke and Cheryl Vermillion, 64; 2, tie, Gail Johnson and Barbara Joronen, along with the team of Liz Mosher and Tammie Cook, 66.5. Second flight: 1, Susan Pease and Sandy Fortino, 68 2, Jolene Nixon and Molly Barnum, 72. Closest to pin on hole No. 2: 1, Van Dyke; 2. Fortino.\n\nIn a Two-Player Chapman format, both players hit tee shots, the players then hit each other’s drive and play alternate shot from the preferred second shot. In a Modified Chapman format, both players hit from the preferred opening tee shot lie, and continue to play alternate shot following the second shot.\n\nChico-Paradise SIR’s Golf Club\n\nForty Chico-Paradise SIR’s Golf Club members got off to an early start last week at Bidwell, trying to beat the heat, if possible, and played a Four-Man Scramble format for its semi-monthly tournament, and the scores were close. The team of Norm Atkin, Kurt Himmler, Steve Velasco and Joe Velasquez took the top spot with a net team score of 55.5. Others cashing in with Bidwell golf shop gift cards were: 2, Jim Barger, Bob Mabrey, Dennis McNamara and Gary White, 56.0; 3, Dave Barnum, Larry Hildenbrand, Charles Staser and Bob Wessels, 56.7; 4, Jeff Eber, Mark Hyder, Richard Nussbaum and Glen Pertuit, 57.7.\n\nClosest to pin contest. Hole No. 2: 1, Wessels; 2, Velasco. Hole No. 4: 1, Cap Porterfield; 2, Barnum; Hole No. 7: 1, Wessels; 2, Dennis Bruggman. Hole No. 12: 1, Mike Gross; 2, McNamara. Hole No. 16: 1, Norm Atkin; 2, Velasquez.\n\nCanyon Oaks Country Club\n\nThe Canyon Oaks Women’s Golf Club held a two-player, 6-6-6 format for a regularly scheduled tournament last Saturday. Taking first was the team of Mary Wallmark and Kim Chappell with a score of 64.9. The other top finishers was as follows: 2, Kathy Sullivan and Sally Pearson, 65.5; 3, Robin Manna and Cathy Edgar, 66.2; 4, Karen Escott and Konnie Marskey, 66.3; 5, Fran Wedow and Gina Snider, 66.4, all close scores. Closest to pin on No. 3: 1, Karen Olson; 2, Marskey; 3, Linda Arellano.\n\nThe club also held its weekly game in addition the above tournament. The turnout was small for the Canyon Oaks Women’s Golf Club weekly outing, but that’s to be expected in this heat. The game was even holes, subtracting one-half a player’s handicap. Cynthia Paulo was low gross on the day, and settled for a tie to share low net. Low net, tie, Paulo, Nancy Taylor and Joan Wagoner, 73. Game: 1, tie, Paulo and Cathy Edgar, 34; 2, Fran Wedow, 34.5. Closest to pin on hole 11: 1, Gina Davis; 2, Wagoner; 3, Wedow.\n\nTable Mountain Golf Course\n\nThe Table Mountain Women’s Golf Club is also experiencing a lower turnout of its members for its weekly outing, for the same reason most of the clubs are…..it’s too HOT! The format was stroke play for low gross and low net. Dana Blanton was low gross on the day with a score of 93. Lynn Sutherland was overall low net t 75. Flight scores: 1, Karen Scurlock, 76; 2, Kris McGee, 78, card-off; 3, Sherry Sue, 78; 4, Janett Ott, 79.\n\nSignificant achievement\n\nShooting at or under your age seems to be a goal for a lot of players. Once done, it’s a stimulus to do it again, and again. The first time turns the light on and tells you, hey, this isn’t all that difficult. So it was for Mike Lim last week at Butte Creek. Seventy-seven-year-old Lim played two stellar front and back nine scores of 37-38 at Butte Creek to beat his age by two strokes. And, the good news, he helped his team, big time, to pocket some green stuff from the other teams. Way to go Mike.\n\nEd Anderson’s local golf column appears Tuesdays.
