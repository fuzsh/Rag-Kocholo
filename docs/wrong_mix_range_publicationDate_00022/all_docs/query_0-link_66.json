        "text": "Like many of you, I woke up last Friday morning to the news that my local MP had been caught up in the great wave of change that swept our country at the general election. As it happens my new MP is an ex-Network Rail colleague. Congratulations Olly Glover MP. We start a new week with a new government, a new team at the Department for Transport (DfT), United Kingdom and hundreds of new MPs across the nations and regions of the UK. I have contacted the new Transport Secretary Louise Haigh MP , congratulating her on her appointment and offering our support to her and her team to implement their plans for rail as set out in the Labour Party’s Getting Britain Moving plan published in April. I have been hugely encouraged by the discussions I have had with Louise as Shadow Transport Secretary over the past year. She is passionately committed to public transport and to putting passengers and freight customers first. And she shares our understanding not only of what is wrong with today’s railway, but also what can be made right – not least by bringing track and train back together under a new Great British Railways. And of course I am chuffed to bits that the Prime Minister has appointed our chair, Peter, Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill, as Minister of State for Railways in the DfT. In my opinion, Peter is the outstanding transport professional of his generation and I have been hugely privileged to work alongside him during my time at Network Rail. Our loss is very much the country’s gain and I know he will be a relentless champion for passengers and freight users, for the railway, and for rail’s contribution to economic growth, jobs and homes. So I am optimistic that the coming weeks and months hold enormous opportunity for us and for the railway. Equally, I am conscious that to fully seize that opportunity we must hold the public’s trust – and we are only ever as good as our customers’ last journey. Too often that hasn’t been good enough so it’s essential we maintain a relentless focus on improving train service performance, safely. We will doubtless hear more from the new government about its detailed plans for rail over the weeks ahead. As we approach next year’s 200th anniversary of the railway, I look forward to working with new Ministers and industry partners as the railway adapts again to the needs of its users and the nation in the years ahead. Network Rail"
