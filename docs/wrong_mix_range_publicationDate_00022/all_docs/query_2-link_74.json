        "text": "How My Work Will Benefit You\n\nI’m an advocate for useful ideas. The central question I explore through my work is, “How can we live better?”\n\nIn other words, I want to find great ideas and explain them in a way that is easy to use and apply to daily life.\n\nMy writing focuses on topics like…\n\nHow to start (and stick to) good habits\n\nHow to make good choices and avoid bad ones\n\nHow to accomplish more in less time\n\nHow to create better systems and processes\n\nHow to achieve meaningful results without overwhelming yourself\n\nMost of all, I write about how to put these ideas into practice in daily life.\n\nMost of the concepts I write about aren’t my own. They are ideas I discover and build upon after many hours of reading and research. I look for insights from all fields: architecture, biology, economics, history, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and more. I consider it my job to find the best ideas and explain them in a way that is actionable and easy-to-understand.\n\nHumankind progresses by adding layer upon layer of knowledge. We all benefit from the insights of our ancestors. I like the idea of leaving a great “intellectual inheritance,” and I’m trying to add a little bit of knowledge to the pile by creating this website and sharing my work.\n\nI don’t claim to have all the answers and I still have a lot to learn, but I’m happy to share what I’ve discovered so far. My work isn’t the only way to think about life, but it’s how I think about it. Hopefully, you’ll find it useful as well.\n\nYou can start by reading my articles or check out my books.\n\nAbout Me\n\nHere are a few notable things about me…\n\nAuthor of the international bestselling book, Atomic Habits.\n\nOver 20 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nOver 200+ weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nTranslated into 60+ languages.\n\nCreator of jamesclear.com and the popular 3-2-1 weekly newsletter.\n\nOver 250 articles published.\n\nOver 3 million email subscribers.\n\nOver 10 million visitors per year to jamesclear.com.\n\nSpeaker at major companies and events.\n\nI deliver 1-2 speeches per month about habits and continuous improvement.\n\nPrevious clients include American Express, AT&T, Cisco, Disney, ESPN, Google, Honda, IKEA, Microsoft, State Farm, and many more.\n\nIf you are interested in having me speak at your event, please click here to submit a request.\n\nFormer athlete and weightlifter."
