        "text": "Notes on et al.:\n\n\"Et al.\" is short for \"et alia\" - which means \"and others\". Note this is plural - \"others\" - you only use it when there is more than one \"other\" (which is why you never use it for a work with two authors - always name both authors). Never use et al. to replace one person.\n\nIf you have the same first author and date for two works, but the other authors are not the same for both works, keep listing authors until the citations are clearly different, and then use et al. for the remaining authors.\n\nFor example:\n\nChan, G. C., Leung, J., Quinn, C., Kelly, A. B., Connor, J. P., Weier, M., & Hall, W. D. (2016). Rural and urban differences in adolescent alcohol use, alcohol supply, and parental drinking. The Journal of Rural Health, 32(3), 280-286. https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12151\n\nChan, G. C., Kelly, A. B., Connor, J. P., Hall, W., Young, R. M., Toumbourou, J. W., & Williams, J. (2016). Regional versus urban differences in teenage alcohol use: Does parental disapproval account for these differences? Australian Journal of Rural Health, 24(1), 3-8. https://doi.org/10.1111/ajr.12177\n\nIf you used both of these works for your paper you would cite them like this:\n\n(Chan, Leung, et al., 2016)\n\n(Chan, Kelly, et al., 2016)\n\nIf the first two or three (etc) authors are the same, keep adding authors until they are different.\n\n(Chan, Kelly, Smith, et al., 2016)\n\n(Chan, Kelly, White, et al., 2016)\n\nRemember, you don't use et al. for only one person, so if there were only three authors and you needed to name the first two authors in your in-text citation, you would name all three authors. If you had only four authors, and you had to include the first three authors to make the citation clear, then you would include all four authors.\n\nWhen this happens, use an & between your last two authors:\n\n(Smith, Jones & Brown, 2016)\n\n(Taylor, Brown, Gwyrdd & Schwarz, 2016)\n\nThere are circumstances where you cannot find a person to use as your author because the \"author\" is a group, a company or an organisation. Some times there is no author, in which case see \"No author or anonymous\" below.\n\nIs the author a company or organisation?\n\nGovernment bodies (such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics or the Department of Education and Training) are often the official \"author\" of the works they publish.\n\nCompanies are usually the authors of their web pages\n\nWrite the company's name in full, the first time you use them, in text, then you can use an acronym. Always write the name in full in the reference list.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn text, the first time:\n\nNarrative: The American Psychological Association (APA, 2012) noted that...\n\nParenthetical: The consumer price index is collated by using around a million pricing structures (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2018).\n\nIn text, subsequent times:\n\nNarrative: As noted by the APA (2012)...\n\nParenthetical: New weights were used to maximise transaction data (ABS, 2018).\n\nIn the reference list:\n\nDo not use acronyms unless the acronym is the official name of the company/organisation - and even then try to find the full version (e.g. CSIRO is Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation). Check the legal information or copyright pages of the organisation's web site.\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association. (2012). How to write an APA style reference when information is missing. http://blog.apastyle.org/files/missing-pieces---apa-style-reference-table.pdf\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics. (2018). Consumer price index, Australia, Dec 2017 (No. 6410.0). http://www.abs.gov.au\n\nN.B. Write author names \"as is\" to the best of your ability. Use their capitalisation, spacing and punctuation. If they use an \"and\" or and \"&\" in their name (e.g. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) retain the version of \"and/&\" they have used.\n\nIs there a corporate body (like a government department or a company) who is responsible for the work? They're probably your author. Take a look at \"When the Author isn't a person\" above.\n\nIs the work anonymous, or without a byline?\n\nSometimes newspaper articles and dictionary or encyclopedia entries don't have an author attributed. Editorials in peer reviewed journals may not have a byline. These works are unattributed, but they are not \"anonymous\".\n\nOnly list the author as \"anonymous\" if the article/work has been attributed to \"Anonymous\" or \"Anon\". If there is no attribution, follow the advice below.\n\nWhen there is no attributed author, move the title of the article (or encyclopedia entry, etc) to the first position in the reference list. In text, use the title of the document in \"quotation marks\" where you would use the author's name. For long titles, it is okay to use only the first few words.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn text:\n\nNarrative: In the Nature editorial, \"On the March\" (2017), it was suggested that crowds might be \"painted as hostile\" (p. 137) by the media.\n\nParenthetical: During the 2017 presidential inauguration, there were some moments of awkwardness (\"Mrs. Obama Says ‘Lovely Frame’\", 2018).\n\nPlease note: In text, the title of the article is given title case - that is, major words are capitalised. You do not use title case in the reference list.\n\nIn the reference list:\n\nOn the march. (2017). Nature, 554, 137. https://www.nature.com/articles/544137a.pdf\n\nMrs. Obama says ‘lovely frame’ in box during awkward handoff. (2018, February 1).
