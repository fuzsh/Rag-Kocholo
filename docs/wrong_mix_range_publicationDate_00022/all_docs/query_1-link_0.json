        "text": "American science fiction author (born 1947)\n\nJohn Herbert Varley (born August 9, 1947) is an American science fiction writer.\n\nVarley was born in Austin, Texas. He grew up in Fort Worth, moved to Port Arthur in 1957, graduated from Nederland High School—all in Texas—and went to Michigan State University on a National Merit Scholarship. He started as a physics major, switched to English, then left school before his 20th birthday and arrived in Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco just in time for the \"Summer of Love\" in 1967. There he worked at various unskilled jobs, depended on St. Anthony's Mission for meals, and panhandled outside the Cala Market on Stanyan Street (since closed) before deciding that writing had to be a better way to make a living. He was serendipitously present at Woodstock in 1969 when his car ran out of gas a half-mile away. He also has lived at various times in Portland and Eugene, Oregon, New York City, San Francisco again, Berkeley, and Los Angeles.\n\nVarley has written several novels (his first attempt, Gas Giant, was, he admits, \"pretty bad\") and numerous short stories, many of them in a future history, \"The Eight Worlds\". These stories are set a century or two after a race of mysterious and omnipotent aliens, the Invaders, have almost completely eradicated humans from the Earth (they regard whales and dolphins to be the superior Terran lifeforms and humans only a dangerous infestation). But humans have inhabited virtually every other corner of the solar system, often through the use of biological modifications learned, in part, by eavesdropping on alien communications.\n\nVarley's \"Overdrawn at the Memory Bank\" was adapted and televised for PBS in 1983. In addition, two of his short stories (\"Options\" and \"Blue Champagne\") were adapted into episodes of the short-lived 1998 Sci-Fi Channel TV series Welcome to Paradox.\n\nVarley spent some years in Hollywood but the only tangible result of this stint was the film Millennium. Of his Millennium experience Varley said:\n\nWe had the first meeting on Millennium in 1979. I ended up writing it six times. There were four different directors, and each time a new director came in I went over the whole thing with him and rewrote it. Each new director had his own ideas, and sometimes you'd gain something from that, but each time something's always lost in the process, so that by the time it went in front of the cameras, a lot of the vision was lost.[1]\n\nVarley is often compared[by whom?] to Robert A. Heinlein.[citation needed] In addition to a similarly descriptive writing style, similarities include a libertarian political perspective and advocacy of free love. Two of his connected novels, Steel Beach and The Golden Globe, include a sub-society of Heinleiners.[2][unreliable source?] The Golden Globe also contains a society evolved from a prison colony on Pluto and a second society evolved from it on Pluto's moon, Charon, similar to the situation found in Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Unlike Heinlein's lunar society, Varley's convict society on Charon maintains its criminal ways and is similar to the Mafia or the yakuza. His Thunder and Lightning series plays on his connection with Heinlein by deriving its main characters' names from many of Heinlein's characters, including Jubal, Manuel Garcia, Kelly, Podkayne, Cassie, and Polly, and by frequently dropping titles of Heinlein's novels in the dialogue.\n\nYear Title Series Notes 1977 The Ophiuchi Hotline Eight Worlds Locus SF Award nominee, 1978[3] 1979 Titan Gaea Trilogy Nebula Award nominee, 1979;[4] Locus SF Award winner and Hugo nominee, 1980[5] 1980 Wizard Gaea Trilogy Hugo and Locus SF Awards nominee, 1981[6] 1983 Millennium Philip K.
