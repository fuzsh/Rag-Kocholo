John Varley Cover Gallery

John Varley struck like a hurricane in the mid-1970s and immediately became one of my favourite writers with a run of fantastic stories: "In the Hall of the Martian Kings", "The Barbie Murders", "The Phantom of Kansas", "The Persistence of Vision", "Press Enter []" and many more. When I put together these little galleries, I like to think that they bring back a few happy memories for people who have read some of the books by the author's covered. Secretly, I'm hoping that if you've not read anything by one of the authors, you'll take a chance and pick up one of their books. If I have to limit myself, I'd have to suggest you get The John Varley Reader, which has a fine selection of stories. Read "Tango Charlie and Foxtrot Romeo" and tell me you don't want to read more. Then try to find a copy of The Barbie Murders so you can also read "Lollipop and the Tar Baby", which is one of his best, and "Bagatelle" which opens brilliantly and just gets better.

He's also written some fine novels. The Ophiuchi Hotline is set in a background partly shared with some of his shorter stories; Titan, Wizard and Demon are a trilogy with a giant alien artifact called Gaea; Steel Beach and Golden Globe are linked to the Eight Worlds background; Millennium was based on a short story which became a rather so-so movie; Mammoth is a stand-alone; but if you're going to start somewhere, try Red Thunder which has all the exuberance of Robert Heinlein's Have Spacesuit, Will Travel and you don't need to be into "sci-fi" to enjoy it. It's the first of a linked series (the stories are each set some time apart) which has reached three novels.

As with all these cover galleries, most of the images are British paperback editions. A few random other editions appear where there was no UK edition and I have the books. And one or two images are from Amazon.
