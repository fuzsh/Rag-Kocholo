Zoetermeer, Centrum West, 25 November 2011.

The RandstadRail is a project which converted the railways from Den Haag to Rotterdam Hofplein and the Zoetermeer Stadslijn to light rail operation. Here on the Zoetermeer Stadslijn are 3 trams at the junction station at the beginning of the circuit. When these trams get into Den Haag they will then continue on to the tram network of that city.
