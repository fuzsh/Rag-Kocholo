This week on the podcast, Andy and I are taking what might be the shortest mailbag question that we have ever gotten. And that doesn't mean that there isn't plenty for us to get into. We had a great time answering this question of how do we get the team to care about their whole job, even the pieces that are not so much fun?\n\nWe'll tell you more about it when we get into it. Let's get into this, shall we?\n\nDr. Andy Roark: And we are back, it's me, Dr. Andy Roark! And the one and only Stephanie, all the small things, Goss!\n\nStephanie Goss: I can't, I can’t with you.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: I totally did this introduction without a microphone, and then I just pulled the microphone up and just immediately did it again and Stephanie just..\n\nStephanie Goss: That’s fine. We're off the rails already.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, it was not the most graceful launch. Have you ever seen a pelican? Have you ever seen a pelican take flight? That's kind of what it looked like. It was not graceful. Got like a fish flopping around in his mouth. Like that's that's what this launch session is looking\n\nStephanie Goss: Andy, the Pelican Roark.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: That’s right.\n\nStephanie Goss: How's it going, Andy Roark?\n\nDr. Andy Roark: It's good. It's really good. Oh yeah. Heck yeah. Stayin busy havin a good time. yeah, it's funny, I, I'm feeling real validated right now. I'm feeling really validated. There's a, there's a book, there's a book that came out recently called Bad Therapy.\n\nAnd it's about kids in therapy. And, it's not anti therapy at all. But it's about you know, maybe not all therapy is good. And maybe some people who call themselves therapists, just like people who call themselves mechanics or veterinarians, are not the best. Yeah, exactly right. And, one of the big things that it hammers on, which I have felt for a long time, is the idea that maybe rumination over hard things, or bad things, without a plan, is a bad idea.\n\nLike, maybe, just bringing up painful memories and sitting with them, if you don't have a plan to do something with them it might be a bad idea. And, it's super validating, because I figured that out a year or two ago, and was just like, this is, I'm not doing this anymore. And, at that time, I stopped reading the news.\n\nAnd Allison was like, you're not gonna stop reading. And I was like, I am, and I did. Like, last September, I stopped reading the news because I'm like, this is not actionable. Like, I will read news on things that I actually have a voice in, or that I can intervene in, but I'm not reading it other than that.\n\nAnd my life has been so much better. And ask me how many major news stories I have been unaware of. Zero. I don't live in a bubble. I just don't have to go and wait around in a lot of the awfulness, so. Anyway, that's– I just feeling real validated today when I was like, yeah. I figured that out. I don't need to sit in angry hurtful emotions or stuff like that.\n\nIf, if I don't have a reason to do that and it's not actionable. And so anyway, feeling, feeling just validated. How about you? How are you, how are you doing? Good.\n\nStephanie Goss: You know, you know, I am great. The sun is out in Washington again, and..\n\nDr. Andy Roark: You're in your, you're back in your closet, brought, where you record?\n\nStephanie Goss: I am back in the cloffice and I am, I am back in the cloffice and I am actually contemplating ripping out a wall and putting in a window this weekend. So, you know, we'll see where that goes.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: In the closet? You're gonna put a window in the closet?\n\nStephanie Goss: in the, in the cloffice.\n\nI need, I need a window. I need some light. I need some sunshine. So I'm, I'm contemplating, I'm contemplating tackling putting in a window myself this weekend. So we'll see how that goes.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: I like the cloffice. It just, when you first said it, it made me think of where vampires work, like the coffice. But it's nice, the cloffice.\n\nStephanie Goss: I have it's interesting. So we have this, this is kind of, kind of a mailbag. We, we got a mailbag question that was maybe the shortest question we've ever gotten.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: We got a one sentence mailbag question. I was like, bam, deal with this.\n\nStephanie Goss: And it's..\n\nDr. Andy Roark: It was like a mic, it was like a mic drop mailbag question. Boom.\n\nStephanie Goss: It was interesting because I'd been reading some posts in some of the groups that I'm in around the same time that I had read this mailbag and I saw some conversation that linked to it. So even though this was. The shortest mailbag we've ever gotten.\n\nI think there's some serious legitimacy here. And I know that as a manager and a practice leader, like I have felt this, but basically, if someone was like, how do I have the team know that the little things matter, like the little pieces of their job that are their job. It might not be fun, but it's still really important and it matters.\n\nAnd so how do I get them to care about the little things? And it's so, I thought it was so funny because we generally have this conversation a lot with practice, I mean, I think anybody who's in charge of managing people feels it because of the difference between what you expect and what you get.\n\nAnd so I was like, Oh, there's a lot of, even though this is the shortest email we've ever gotten. I think there's a lot of meat on this bone for you and I to go after.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah. I am, I'm super fired up about this. So, yeah, this is, this is a good one. How do you have the team know that the little things matter? headspace, we start with headspace just, and again, I don't know exactly what this refers to.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say, I love when there is like a, a battle on the internet, just the whole vet internet gets into a fight and then we, and then we get a mailbag question that's just like kind of, kind of vague, but if you're looking at the internet, you're like, I know exactly what this is about.\n\nAnd so I, I always love that. And so it just,\n\nStephanie Goss: Oh, I, I, well, I'll give us a great example right off the bat. The first thing that came to my mind when I read this was my own experience over the years when you have someone who is VA, who's training to be a licensed technician, or you have someone who has gone from being unlicensed to licensed and so now they can all of a sudden help in surgery and they can you know, do all the blood draws and place catheters and do all of those things. And it is, I have had to wage, battle here when it comes to, I hear you and I know that surgery is fun for you and I know that you want to place all the catheters and do all the things and you still have to clean up after yourself because that's part of your job.\n\nAnd so I think that's the first example that came to my mind is like shining of this is the fun shiny thing. And so of course you want to do that piece of your job and this is the other side of that piece of your job. And just because it's not fun and shiny doesn't mean that you don't have to do it.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah. Okay, cool. Alright, so let's start with headspace here. Now, I, because this is the headspace section of the podcast, I am going to say some things. It's just kind of what I would say to the person who's writing to roll around in their mind. The first thing that I always want to put forward here is just a little bit, this is a case of possibly making sure I don't need to check myself before I wreck myself. Meaning this is one of those angry manager thoughts, right? It's not the flaming raging sword of justice necessarily, but there's something there when you're like, “Why aren't these people following the rules? Details matter, people! Details matter” And like, you can hear this, and maybe they're right, but also there's a reason that you can, like, totally hear this in manager voice details matt. Am I the only one who pays attention to standards and…?\n\nStephanie Goss: Can you please rephrase that and say that that's like the nitpicky, irritated manager voice? Cause I don't think I sound like that all the time.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: No, not all the time. Not all the time, but just when you’re having a bad day.\n\nStephanie Goss: Or just, just a lot of the time.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Just most of the time. No, just when you're having a bad– It usually comes, it usually comes when things are hard. Again, this is like\n\nStephanie Goss: Sure.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: We're just goofing off here. But this is often what I hear when the straw breaks the camel's back. You know what I mean? There's like\n\nStephanie Goss: Yeah, you're at the end of your rope.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: There's seven real problems and someone left a fecal loop in the sink and don't standards matter anymore? And that's, that's where this disco says. So anyway, I just want to put that for us first. Put that up front and say let's make sure let's just take some deep breaths. Is this really about standards or is there other stuff going on?\n\nOkay, so let's just say that there's stuff there really is stuff going on and people are you know, not doing the basic stuff. Okay, Flaming raging sword of justice check. We always talk about that. We talk about pulling the flaming raging sword of justice and taking heads. Do not allow yourself to get into a mindset.\n\nThe person asking this question has already kind of probably taken a bunch of little things and then rolled them together into a big thing. And now we're reacting to a big thing. And so you always got to be careful with that. And again, I'm so guilty of this too. And so, you know, let's just say that we, you know, we wake up in the morning and we get to the clinic and there's trash in the parking lot.\n\nAnd then we go inside and I hear somebody telling like an inappropriate joke and there's no pet owners around or anything but they I catch the end of an inappropriate joke and laughs in the treatment room and then I go and sit down and there's a note to call somebody back because a client yesterday didn't feel like the invoice was explained clearly and those are those are three annoying little things And I can say, like, okay, these are the three things I have to work through.\n\nOr I can roll them together and say, our practice doesn't care about quality. These people are not doing their jobs. And it's catastrophizing. But you just have to be careful about rolling those things together. When, like, I always say, you know, the difference between a struggling business and a thriving business, the struggling business has the same damn problem every day, and the thriving business has a different damn problem every day, and that's the only difference.\n\nAnd so, we're always going to have these headaches. Just be careful about rolling them together into something bigger than they are, and, and, and like ascribing this, the team doesn't uphold standards idea to it. And I'm not saying that's what this person is doing, but, but I, I want to be wary of that and so that's just my first opening sort of cautionary position is let's just look at this and maybe have a snack let's maybe have a snack first and then let’s make sure..\n\nStephanie Goss: Make sure we're not Snickers\n\nAndy Roark: yeah exactly right just make sure that we're not we're not just just hangry\n\nuh if if we also feel like everyone is mad at us then that like I don't know maybe there's something going on here we should just put a pin in this for a couple of days see how we feel so let's start with that.\n\nStephanie Goss: Yeah. And I think the other piece of that, that I try and ask myself is, am I rolling these things together? And the other, the other piece of it for me is, am I mad because this is a repeat thing or am I mad because. I'm hangry, or today just sucks, or whatever. Because if I'm not, if I'm not mad because it's a repeat thing then I can, it's much easier to set that aside.\n\nAnd like you said, go, okay, maybe I'm hangry, maybe I'm rolling these things together, whatever. If it is a repeat thing, that helps me get into a much healthier headspace of, Okay, if this is a repeat thing, how have I handled it to this point? And start asking my questions about the rest of the headspace, like, am I assuming good intent?\n\nHave I talked to them? Have I, you know, made myself clear? All of those things that we normally get into when it comes to headspace. And, and so I think that that for me asking myself, is this, is this a repeat? Really helps me know which direction to go in.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: This is fertile ground for telling ourselves stories\n\nStephanie Goss: Mm-hmm.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: You know what I mean? It's like, and so, so the question I would ask myself is, what story am I telling? And it's like, well, this happened, and this happened, and this happened, and\n\nStephanie Goss: So she doesn't care about her job.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: That means that. And again, I don't know that's what this person is writing about, but that's what I have seen, and I've done that. I mean, we've all done that. Just check, check yourself real quick. Are we, are we telling ourselves stories? Okay, cool. Now, let's wade into this. So let's say that this is going on, and we sort of checked ourself. We say, nah, it was just, you know, Standards aren't aren't getting upheld the way they should okay cool the first thing for me, and this is cliche But it's a cliche for a reason, Seek first to understand um like hey guys umm What's, what's going on?\n\nLike, why is this not getting done? Like, it's like, I'm making the assumption they don't care. They don't, their, their standards, their quality standards aren't as high as mine. Those are all assumptions. Like, what's, go, go with curiosity and compassion in your heart. And patience. And again, snack. If you haven't had the snack, you should have the snack. Have the snack. And then, and then just, but then go, the first thing is seek, seek first to understand. What do I not know? How have these people been set up to fail? What can I take ownership of? Like, what's my fault? What has not been communicated? And again, this is the open hearted, like, let's really figure out what's going on.\n\nIt reminds me of the movie Office Space, which I just love, but the old Office Space movie where they're always filling out TPS reports, and everybody's filling out TPS reports, and TPS reports are a system, and they were probably created with a good intention, and they're supposed to keep things organized, but now we've built this system in this movie where you have TPS reports have to be done all the time on everything, and it's, it's just, It's just perfect.\n\nIt's a busy work, and it's an obstacle to actually getting the real work done, or at least that's how they perceive it. Seek first to understand, like, what is the perception here? What is the reality? What's going on? How did, how did we get here? And just don't tell yourself stories, and related to that is of course assuming good intent.\n\nAssume that these, don't, do not assume these people don't care as much as you do. Don't assume that they're lazy. Just assume there's something that you, that you don't know about, that there's a legitimate problem that we kind of have to address here. But that, I think that gets that gets you into that right headspace.\n\nSo that's, I think that's the opening place for me with headspace. And then I've got a couple of little bits after that, but I don't know. So assuming good intent, are you on board with that?\n\nStephanie Goss: Yeah, for sure. And I think the the, you know, our, our friend, Erika Cartwright tells I think she was doing a mic drop about, you know, the client's side of the story. And she told this story about how she's a very charismatic and outgoing personality. For those of you who have not experienced, Erika. She's crazy and, and loud and fun and all of the things that would go along with that. And she and I are trucker mouth friends. And so you can imagine her driving along in her, she's like, you know, barely five feet. And you can imagine her driving along in her big giant SUV just getting irritated and yelling at people who are driving like idiots or cutting people off or whatever. And the road rage is a real thing. And she was talking about how the way that she kind of cured herself of the road rage and really like brought her blood pressure down, cause it was real concern was to just force herself to look at the other car and say, Hmm. I wonder if they might be having diarrhea today.\n\nAnd she just started asking herself that, like, what if that was happening? You know, it's like when you're driving and you see someone speeding and you ask yourself, maybe the person in the car with them is in labor. It's that same kind of thing of like, what is happening with them? And so I think the thing that Like you know, if you don't want to think about, is this person having diarrhea today?\n\nThe thing that I ask myself is like, you said this is ripe ground for us to make up stories in our head. And I think part of the way that I helped stop that in my own brain was to ask myself, could I tell another story here? And could I tell the story that they do care about the job? They just don't understand.\n\nAnd whether it's understand what I want, understand what is expected of them, understand what the protocol is, what the process is… there's a, you know, a million different options that come at the end of that sentence. And it's the same kind of thing as like, what if that driver who's being a total a hole and just cut me off?\n\nWhat if they're driving to the hospital because there's an emergency, you know, it's asking yourself that same kind of question. And when we say assume good intent, I've had people. I've had people who listen to the podcast go, I know you guys walk us through, you know, the steps that I know you walk us through safe.\n\nAnd I know you, you know, I know you guys have talked about, assume good intent a million times and I don't know how to do that because, you know, because the stories that I'm telling myself in my head are X, Y, and Z. And so I I, that resonates with me because it is, it is a hard thing to do cause, you know, it's so the thing you should do, but that doesn't mean that getting yourself to that side is any easier.\n\nAnd so I think one of the tools that I've really learned for myself is, if there's a possibility that I'm making up a story in my head about the situation, is to ask myself, what could the other story be here?\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, I agree. Okay. I want to make I want to end headspace here with a caveat I've got a little section of headspace here for my perfectionists in the audience or People who are maybe managing someone who is a perfectionist who's coming with us and again, this doesn't play everybody. But I will tell you the way I've seen this go down.\n\nSo one there's the person who goes these people are upholding standards. There's the other person who's in a management role. That has someone who comes to them and says these other people are upholding standards and it's driving me nuts. And so I, I think I've seen it. I have been the person who has been frustrated that people are upholding standards.\n\nAnd I have been managing someone who's frustrated when I'm maybe not frustrated. And so those are different things. But anyway, just hear this out as I kind of roll it together. For my perfectionist people out there, one question that you want to think here when you're like, people aren't upholding these standards.\n\nStephanie Goss: Mm-hmm.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Remember to ask yourself sometimes. Is this a hill I want to die on? Is this a hill worth dying on? And I, I hate it. I have always, when I was young, I imagined the perfect team and the perfect business and everything runs smoothly and instead, you know what I got, Stephanie Goss. I got Stephanie Goss. That's what I got. It's the Muppet show over here. That's the, that's the business that I run. It’s Tyler Grogan and Ron Sosa, Stephanie Goss, Maria Pirita, just the list goes on. God, Dustin Bays, it is the absolute chaos and pandemonium in our business.\n\nStephanie Goss: I was gonna say the, the biggest offender on our team is probably Kelsey Beth Carpenter.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Kelsey Beth Carpenter. She’s like…\n\nStephanie Goss: Steph, Steph D is probably the closest to following all the rules on the team.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: It’s a battle, it’s a battle of Order Muppets and the Chaos Muppets. But anyway, all joking aside there are, there are things that are worth fighting the battle with your team over, and there are things that are not worth fighting the battle with your team over. And just maybe let them not park as far away from the building as possible.\n\nMaybe just give up on that dream. And maybe they can't park in front of the front door. But maybe just don't fight with them about parking as far from the building as possible and just let that one go. And so anyway, if that's you just think about is this a hill you want to die on.\n\nStephanie Goss: Mm-hmm.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: And then the other thing that I will say now again, switching back to a little bit more serious tone here, too.\n\nWhen I hear people come to me or they'll come to management or leadership and they're like these people aren't following the rules. Sometimes they have a legitimate point and corners are getting cut and we need to fix that and that's true. There's a couple other things that sometimes happen number one.\n\nThere are times when people want to feel like they have control by enforcing the rules and so they want to enforce a feeling of power or a feeling of control not in a malicious way. But they're like these things are supposed to happen and these people aren't doing the things that are written down and for them it's a feeling of these people need to be made to behave in the way that the rules are written and It's almost like a moral battle for them like this cannot stand this represents anarchy. And so I don't know if that makes sense or but if you've seen that but I I've definitely seen there's some people who have really really don't like it when they feel like the rules aren't being followed and it's not really about the rules and it's not even about the impact of not following the rules. It's about the fact that rules should be followed and that's not happening And so there's kind of that mentality.\n\nStephanie Goss: Right. And I think, I think, I'm glad you brought that up because I think as a manager part of, I like that you, you know, you brought up picking your battles. I think as a, as a manager, certainly, and as the leader of the hospital, if you cannot find a healthy place between the facts that. Some rules are going to be broken, and things are always not going to be perfect, and sometimes it's very messy, because veterinary medicine is a place where we live in the shades of gray.\n\nIf you cannot wrap your head around that as a manager, like, you are going to have a hard time, because we, we do have a lot of managers who in particular, who are, process and order people and they need there to be structure and they really struggle here with the team members who are like yeah, and I let go of that patient and immediately went to go help with this patient and so I felt like the patient care was a bigger priority than taking the fecal loop out of the sink and cleaning it, Right?\n\nLike there are always, there's always going to be that battle. And if you can't– on either side of the equation, if you can't find that place of peace to be able to ask yourself, is this the hill I want to die on? You're gonna, you're gonna be super, super miserable. And so I think the thing for me, because on, on the other side of this, let me just say and acknowledge and validate, I have been that person who gets very frustrated with the fact that rules are not being followed because I'm like, why do we have the rules? If they're not gonna be followed like just do the damn thing so there I see that side of it and I have also been the person on the other side of it who is like I just need the job to get done.\n\nLike, I know that there's a process, but can you just do this thing? Like, get it done. And so, I think for me, one of the tools here to overcome the, the perfectionist tendencies or the need for it to be so black and white on either side is to ask myself, why is this a rule, or a system, or a process? And if I can't answer that question, like really, truly, and the answer can't just be, well, because that's the way we've always done it. If I can't tell you why we're doing something, and if the other person involved can't tell you why we're doing something, then there's a breakdown in communication, and that's That's the thing that I really need to work on, not the fact that they left the fecal loop in the sink, right?\n\nLike that, I need to be able to answer that to not only assume good intent, but also to do my job as far as training the team and making sure that they have all the resources to do their job.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, you want to be careful about rule enforcement as a brake pedal against change and I've seen that a lot as well. So there are people who don't like change and they don't want your business to change or they don't want to innovate or do things differently. They like the way things were and they want to stay that way and I have seen people who with that mentality.\n\nAnd again, I don't think it's malicious. They like rules because rules entrench the current state into the into the culture. And they make change much harder because now change involves breaking rules or changing rules, which is a bureaucratic process, as opposed to just like, no, you know what, we're going to do a little bit differently today.\n\nWell, if, if I say, you know what, guys, we're going to run, we're going to run dentistry's a little differently today in our, in our, in our general prep. If that's against the rules, then you have a weapon to shut that down and say, Oh, no, we're not Andy. We're going to do it the same way we always do. Cause those are the rules. And so again, just not to vilify, but again, I just, I do see those behaviors and I don't think people are malicious. I think some people really don't like change and the rules make them very comfortable. And so enforcing rules can be a brake pedal when things are starting to change or evolve or adapt, which is something to be aware of.\n\nAnd then last is just be careful of rules as an enemy to autonomy, meaning like, like you said, it was a perfect example of I left the fecal loop in the sink because I saw a patient that needed help and so that seemed to me in the moment, looking around using my eyes and my training and my judgment that was the right call and you say well the rules would go against the call that you made and you go well, that's that's taking away this person's autonomy and so we want to be careful about having rules that are that nitpicky. And the last thing is if rules show your team that you don't trust them. Yeah, you have rules because I don't trust you to make common sense decisions.\n\nI would say yeah, that's a little it's a little sticky. So anyway, I'm sorry. I've talked all about headspace. I've talked all about headspace and a lot about checking ourselves and checking complaints about rules but it's just because I I do see that stuff a lot and seek first to understand, don't be, be aware of the stories you're telling yourself, and all that to say, if we come down to a place and the standards are not being met, we're going to fix it.\n\nAnd so let's let's take a break, Stephanie, and then we'll come back, and let's get into the action steps of actually getting, getting the small things done.\n\nStephanie Goss: Okay. That sounds good.\n\nHey friends. If you're listening to today's podcast and you happen to be in a medical director role. Listen up because this one's for you on May 29th, we are doing our second annual Uncharted Medical Director Summit. That is, we are bringing together medical directors from all walks of veterinary life. Doesn't matter whether you are in private practice, corporate practice, nonprofit GP, ER shelter, medicine, academia, and so much more. If you are in a medical director role, we have got something that you are not going to want to miss. So, if you've never experienced an Uncharted Summit, you're going to want to check this out because it's different from a usual conference. We'll have an awesome general session presented by our friend, Dr. Addie Reinhard from MentorVet. We also will have a workshop session with three different workshops being presented by myself, Dr. Andy Roark and our dear friend, Dr. Erica Pounds, who is a multi-site medical director and all of them are going to be on topics relevant to the medical director role specifically.\n\nAnd then what makes it a summit? Giving you time to network and collaborate with your peers on the challenges that are unique to the veterinary medical director role. So it's going to be a jam packed day. It's one day it's on zoom. It's fast and it’s furious. It's not your usual zoom where you're sitting there listening to people talk at you, camera's on, we're going to talk to each other. We're going to engage. We're going to problem-solve real-world challenges that happen in your practices. So if this sounds like something you don't want to miss, head over to the website at unchartedvet.com/events. And sign up today now back to the podcast.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: We're back from our break. Okay\n\nStephanie Goss: We gotta actually get serious.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: We gotta get serious here and get some work done. All right, so for me, action steps, if you want people to actually do the small things and pay attention to the details, the first thing is, you have to talk about why the details matter. Like why is this important? And there are some people who are like, it's a rule. It's written down. That's good enough, and I will tell you that is not good enough for a segment of people. I don't know how big a segment it is, but there are some people who are like, I don't, What, what are we, why is this important? Like why does it, why can't the fecal loop sit in the sink while I finish up with this patient and get this client out the door?\n\nWhy can't it just be there? And I'm not saying there's not a right answer, but that's their honest to God question is, why? What is the concern about this? And oftentimes, oftentimes, we can meet these people in the middle. And you say, well, because what happens is, all the fecal loops pile up, and then one person gets stuck doing them, and blah, you know, and blah, blah.\n\nMaybe there's a, there, maybe there's a way to meet in the middle between, you need to make the client wait while you do this, and these have piled up and now there's a bunch of them and people are cleaning up other people's fecal loops and it feels, you know, they feel resentful and blah, blah, blah. Maybe, maybe, maybe there's a, maybe there's a healthy middle another way we could do this, but, but we gotta start off with, with why.\n\nStephanie Goss: It's so funny that you said that because I was talking to some so when I was reading some of the, the threads around the time we got this, and there was one in particular, that was someone who was struggling with this scenario I gave at the, at the beginning of this, which is like, they have a newly promoted technician and they're leaving parts of their job for other people to do because they're like, well, I am qualified now to do this job, all of these other things. And so that should be my first priority. And other people who are not licensed should be able to do some of these tasks. And that's, some of the managers, like the first set of responses was, well, you need it, you need to have it written down in their job description that they have to do this, or you need a protocol that says they have to do this, this piece of it.\n\nAnd it was so funny because that's where the like, what you were saying in the headspace about that you're trying to enforce rules to have control. Like that was the response from a bunch of the managers who were like, we'll put it in writing and then it will solve the problem.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, put it in writing and make them do it! Enforce your control! Flaming raging sword of justice! Like yeah, I get it.\n\nStephanie Goss: And it's so, and it's so funny because I was like, okay, for me, it's a yes, and because if it is really important, it absolutely should be in writing, it should be written down. And if you can't answer the why, it goes back to what I said, if you can't answer why, and the other people on your team don't understand or can't answer why, don't write it down.\n\nBecause it's not actually important enough to be included in protocols or processes or policies if everybody on the team doesn't understand the why.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah. Well, look, look I mean hear this if you have an idea you have a thing that you want and your way of implementing it is not explaining it and not getting people to buy into it, your way of implementing is writing it down and make it a rule and then punish people who break the rule, you're going to have a shitty culture, pardon me. You're going to have a, you're going to have a, beatings will continue until morale improves culture, that is not, it's not how you make people want to work at your place by creating rules that seem arbitrary to them and then saying it's written down and so you're out of line, like that's not, it's a terrible place to work and again, I get it.\n\nAnd I've seen this, but this is the, this is one of the frustrating things in leadership. If you want to be good, sometimes you have to slow down to go fast. And what that means is you have to have the conversation with people about what we're doing and why we're doing it. And then you can write it down and then you can hold people accountable to it and you can remind them of why we're doing this, but if you don't have a compelling reason why your rule is what it is, I'm not sure that person's in the wrong. I think maybe you should think about whether or not this rule really makes sense.\n\nStephanie Goss: Right. And, and I think that it's, this is one of those things that you know, when, when I read it, it hurts my heart because I know that for the vast majority of people who I see reading it, responding in this way of, I need to write it down because then I can enforce the rule and I can hold people accountable.\n\nThey don't have the malicious intent. They don't have the intention to have the, the, you know, the beatings will continue until culture improves morale. Right. They're using the tool that someone has shown them, and it's like, it's like, you know, when you're taught that giving someone feedback means you give them the compliment sandwich, and you give them a compliment, and then you smash the feedback in the middle as the crappy part, and then you give them another compliment to soften that blow.\n\nWe do it because we do it because maybe we don't know any different or because that's the tool that we've been given. And I see this style of, I'm going to write it down and I'm going to incorporate it into our processes or protocols or handbook or whatever. I see that from a lot of young managers. And that was when, for, for me, that was a tool that I was given in the beginning of my career, my practice owners were like, yeah, this is unacceptable, so write it down, and then if somebody does it, then we have a reason to let them, let them go, right? Like that, that was,\n\nDr. Andy Roark: That’s a hard tool.\n\nStephanie Goss: It is a hard tool. And when you're, you don't know, you don't have the training. I always say, you know, veterinarians go to vet school to become veterinarians.\n\nThey don't go to vet school to become business leaders. Most of them. And it's the same for, for managers. Like so many of us have come up and, and leaders on the floor have come up. And so, you know, I think it's important to recognize, like, I, I see you and I hear you. I have been that person who's like, Oh, well, this is the tool that I'm going to apply.\n\nAnd I think your point, Andy, is super, super valid, which is, you can absolutely do that. And, having done it, and having screwed it up, I can say, I think both you and I can safely say, this is a way that we have royally screwed this up. And so,\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Well, let me, I think, I think this really summarizes the core belief, the core philosophy of Uncharted right here. And so a lot of people listen to this podcast and they're like, well, what exactly is Uncharted? I mean, Andy and Stephanie talk about business stuff, but what is, what is Uncharted relative to everything else?\n\nThis is, this is what Uncharted is. So Uncharted is taking this tool, which is a good tool. It works. And Uncharted's philosophy is, this is a good tool. You are not going to use this tool until you sit down with people and look at them in the eye and talk to them about why this is important. And listen to them.\n\nStephanie Goss: Give them time to learn.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Give them time to learn and listen to them. And have an honest conversation about why this is important. What we want the experience of working here to be and what our values are and and and how we care for our patients and what experience we want to create for our clients.\n\nStephanie Goss: And hear, and hear their feedback, because they may have, they may have an experience that is completely different from yours, and if you can't listen to anything that they have to say, and, and the, I know that the first thing that comes out of a lot of people's mouths is, well, but what happens when it's just an excuse? Like what happens if they're just using it as an excuse to not do their job? You have to remind yourself. That's the, that's the angry, that's the angry manager headspace that we were talking about at the very beginning of this podcast. You're in that headspace because the reality is people don't come to work every day wanting to do a bad job.\n\nAnd if, and if that is your gut reaction is like, well, they're just giving me an excuse. Like I am listening to them. I'm asking them why it happened. And cause this is part of the learning process. Like it takes time to get there. And you get into the space of, okay, well, I asked them and I listened and then their feedback was, well, I just went to do this other thing, but this is still important. And so they're still not doing their job. You have to like, really, really listen,\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, you do.\n\nStephanie Goss: You know, because it may be in the moment, they didn't do it. And it and it is somewhat of an excuse. And if there is feedback there, like, This may not be realistic because dot, dot, dot. And then they tell you something to your point, Andy, like that's how you learn the middle ground to meet them in the middle.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah. You can't discount the idea that perhaps the person who's working on the floor actually doing the thing has some insight into it that you in your manager's office or in your doctor's office don't have. And so, again, don't, I mean, again. Maybe they are making excuses too. What is the worst case scenario?\n\nThe worst case scenario is, you end up doing what you were planning to do anyway, but at least you have tried to engage this person, and you have an understanding of what their feedback is, and you're still going ahead and doing it. But at least you tried the easy way and so that's that's the first thing is you've got to get a foundation in why why do we and again it doesn't people like I have to have this conversation for every little rule. No, no, you don't you need.\n\nStephanie Goss: Cause if there is a clear why you don't have to have the\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Exactly if you say so again, so so. Let's just explore this why a little bit. Generally I'm not gonna have a conversation with the team about every little rule but all of the little rules come together to create the overall experience.\n\nAnd so if you haven't sat down with your team and said to them, Hey guys, let's, let's, I want to have a conversation with you guys. I want you to imagine a really great veterinary team. I want you to imagine that. What does that team look like? How do they behave? What does their clinic look like? And they're going to say things like, well, they treat each other with respect, and they smile, and the clinic is clean, and the equipment is well maintained.\n\nYou go, yep, and you're going to write all those things down. And then you're going to say, what do they sound like? They give each other positive feedback, and they encourage each other, and they don't badmouth the clients. You say, okay, cool. What does it feel like to work in that team, guys? At the end of the day, what does that feel like?\n\nAnd they're going to say, it feels like, it feels rewarding. It feels like we're working hard, and we're getting things done. It feels like we're making a difference. They're going to say whatever they're going to say. And every team is going to be different. There's not a right answer, but they're going to tell you what that is. And then at the end of that conversation, you're going to say, are some things that we can do, or what are some things that we can agree to as a team so that we can look like and sound like, and feel like a great veterinary team, and then you're going to shut up and you're going to let them tell you what they want to do and what they're excited about.\n\nAnd then you're going to lean in and you're going to support them. Then we're gonna get started, and we're gonna, and we're, this is our time to say, hey, we've got some, we've got some rules in place, we're agreeing that we're gonna do this, and, and this is, and now we're gonna start, we're gonna go forward, and I wanna support you guys in this, and it shouldn't all be stick either, like, that's the other thing, is\n\nStephanie Goss: Yes.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: It should not be, it should not be a punishment culture. It should be a positive, are you celebrating them when they live the values? Are you celebrating them when they do the good work? Oftentimes, you know, I use this example all the time. People are simple animals. I don't care how many degrees you have, how smart you are, you're a simple animal. And we don't train people, we don't train simple animals with negative reinforcement, do we?\n\nLike, we figure out how to positively reinforce and we do it. And humans are the same way. And so if you want people to follow the rules, what are you doing to positively reinforce them following the rules? Like, how do you, how do you do that? And anyone who tries to push back and say, well, it's their job.\n\nI go, all right, seriously, let's think about this. My job, my dog's job is to be a good dog. He ain't doing it. If he doesn't get positive reinforcement, you know, it's just, you've got to, if you want to have a good culture, you have to build it with positivity, you\n\nStephanie Goss: It can't be, it can't be a transactional. It can't be the, you just show up and do your job and I give you a paycheck. And that's why we have a relationship because that is, no one wants to work in that environment.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Well, even the example that you gave earlier, I think is a good one, right? So we've got this person. Let's say that they were a VA and they have finished their training and now they're a vet tech. Right. So they've gotten credentialed and they're doing it now. And they're like, well, I shouldn't have to do those things because other people are more capable of doing those things.\n\nThat person is not necessarily wrong. You can run your business in different ways. You could a hundred percent, like it's not heresy or stupid to say, I want my credit credentialed vet techs doing things that only credentialed vet techs could do. That's not a bad business model and that's not wrong, but if everyone's expectation is no, we all, we all take cases from start to finish and that's how we run our business. That's not wrong or bad either. Not at all. But you can't have one person whose philosophy is credential vet techs only do things credential vet techs can do. And another person who says, no, we all take a case and we stay with that case from beginning to end.\n\nThose are conflicting systems. And so sitting and talking with them is not bad, but hear them, hear what they say, and talk about the decision that was made and talk about, Hey, you know, here's the thing. We, we look at that model, the downside, and I would, I, I always like to ask the other person the question.\n\nWhat do you think the downside of that model is? Think about, think about where, where does that model, why do some people not like that model? Well, because when you're new, you're cleaning fecal loops all the time while the experienced people are doing all the fun stuff. Like, yeah, that's the answer. And we want, we have a, and if it's on growing and training.\n\nAnd so that's why we decided this is not because we don't think your skills are valuable. Not because we think that you couldn't do other things or we don't have enough work. We want to grow and develop people, which means we don't want to have people who can only do the most basic of work because other people get to do all the fun stuff.\n\nAnd so that's just what we decided. And that's the why. And if they, if they hate that why, they go, I fundamentally don't agree. Unfortunately, they might not be a good person for your practice because that's, yeah, That's, that's your, how you decide to grow your business. But at least we're having conversation about the purpose and, and why things are the way they are.\n\nAnd, that person can feel heard and I'm going to do my best job to be a good active listener. And then ultimately we're going to say, well, this was the decision that was made and this is how we need to go forward. And now we're going to switch over and start holding people accountable.\n\nStephanie Goss: And I think when you, the other thing that I would say is a lot of the time, and I don't know about you, Andy, but I feel like a lot of the time I get asked the question of like, I don't want to have to be the one to mediate these conversations. Like, how do I get them to talk to each other? Like when somebody is, you know, when somebody is leaving their mess for other people to clean up, how do I get them to talk to each other about that instead of coming to me and being like, well, you know, now that Avery's a, you know, an RVT, she's not finishing her cases. She's just bailing and leaving our mess for, you know, Sarah to clean up as the, as the VA. When you have a culture where you consistently have everybody involved in creating the why, and they understand it from both sides, it makes it easier for them to hold each other accountable.\n\nIt makes it easier for Sarah to be able to say, hey Avery, you know, I know you wanted to get that next patient into, you know, into surgery and I know that you were, you know, just trying to get, get things going and this is how it impacted my case cause you know, then Dr. Sarah asked me to bring a patient in and there was no clean space and so, hey next time would you, you know, be able to just finish your case from start to finish because we all, we all agreed that that was how we were going to do cases in the hospital.\n\nLike, would that, you know, can you, can you help me out there? Those conversations only happen in an environment where there is the psychological safety, but also where there is the trust and the trust comes from what, when everyone understands the why. And so for me, the Jedi place as a leader is to get to the, the team has those easy, hard conversations, if you will, of talking to each other because they all know the why and they can have, they can say that to one another.\n\nAnd I have to deal as the leader with the ones where they're like, hey, we've had these conversations and this is consistently still happening. And the reason I've been given is just because I don't agree with that. And so I'm going to do it my way because that's something they can't deal with as a team member.\n\nThat's something that's for me to deal with as a leader, to your point, to say, Hey, maybe this is not the right hospital for you. I want to deal with those kinds of conversations, but that only comes when we create that space where they're all involved in the why. And it's just as easy for one of them to say, hey, I need your help. Can, can we, can we do this? Like that comes naturally when they're involved in the why.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, that, that is the Uncharted way. Like, that is the uncharted way. It's not about me policing people. I hate that. It's about us having a good conversation with the group and having them encourage, support, appreciate, praise, and sometimes gently correct.\n\nStephanie Goss: Right.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: And, but that only happens with this conversation.\n\nOkay. Once you get through that step, which I think is really important, and there's a million ways to do it, it depends on, on what we're talking about. Once you get through that step, the internet advice is probably fairly accurate from the basic blocking and tackling. Set clear, set clear expectations, have clear metrics that people can see, so they know that there, if I thought I cleaned the exam room and I didn't meet your standards of cleaning the exam room, I don't know that because I thought I cleaned it and you're like, he didn't clean it. And so, that's, those are, the expectation may be clear to some, that the exam room has to be cleaned, but the metric you're using for cleanliness, I'm, I'm not understanding.\n\nStephanie Goss: Yeah. What does clean look like? Yeah.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Exactly yeah, and so, clear expectations, clear metrics, and then, and then, this again, this is also uncharted territory right here. Feedback. Culture. You cannot police culture. You cannot catch people breaking the rules until you have a good culture. You have got to celebrate culture. You have to celebrate the people who are showing the values that you care about, that are making your hospital the place you want it to be. Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate. And a lot of us, we don't do that because it takes a lot of work.\n\nStephanie Goss: Yes.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: But that is, that is where the rubber meets the road. And so, talking to people about not meeting expectations should be a small part of the feedback you give. The majority should be saying, Hey, I saw you grabbing those fecal loops and cleaning everything up, and I know that those probably were not all your cases, and I just want you to say, I saw you, and I appreciate you.\n\nThank you for doing that. You know, or write a thank you note and just say, Hey, I just wanted you to know, I've noticed recently how much you do around here, and it really matters to me. And again, that is time well spent, but a lot of us, we say, if it's not broke, I'm not going to touch it. That's, that's, that's not a, it's not the investment you think it is.\n\nSo anyway, so there's that. Document mistakes. And then manage the wrong people out, you know, so if we had the conversation and we said these are the expectations and people fail to meet the standards or they don't follow the rules or they continue to cut corners and you say, you're cutting corners in a way that is not acceptable, we are going to be a higher quality practice than the medicine that you are determined to practice.\n\nThere's no reconciling that. You know, if I have communicated it and I'm holding someone accountable and they refuse to change, there's, there's only one way out of this. Again, you always, you pick your poison. You always pick your poison. Do you want to be a practice that practices that quality of medicine?\n\nOr do you want to part ways with that person who's determined to practice that way? Those are the only two options after you've had conversations and managed. If they're not changing, pick your poison. Those are your two paths.\n\nStephanie Goss: Mm hmm. And I think where you, where you started in the very beginning with the idea of, is this the hill you want to die on? That's really important here because do you want to fire someone because they're leaving fecal loops in the sink? You, as a manager, you have to ask yourself questions that seem nuts like that.\n\nIt's like, this seems really, I can't, it's surreal that I would fire somebody for leaving fecal loops in the sink. If your answer, if you don't understand why your answer would be yes, probably not the hill you want to die on. And so if your answer is yes, then you, from an action set perspective, absolutely have to ask yourself, like, did I make it clear?\n\nDo they know how to do, to your point, do they know what clean looks like in the exam room? Have we trained them? Have we practiced? Have we done all of the things? And that, that comes with the documentation. And for, again, for a lot of us, this is where our tools as managers was, well, you just tell them that they didn't do it.\n\nAnd then after you've told them once, then you write them up and then you write them up again, and then you fire them the third time. Well, okay. But telling someone, hey, you didn't do this thing is vastly different from actually making sure that they understand not only what does that mean, but to your point, how to do it right.\n\nAnd then giving yourself, like if you on the other side of that equation are not working harder to recognize them doing it right, then you are working at catching them doing it wrong again, then you're not doing your job ass a leader. And I think that that's one of the hard realities because for a lot of us, we, that's the tool we're given.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: I, no, I agree with that. That's, that's the tool we're taught and we're given. It's just, I don't know, that's not, that's not the relationship you want to have. That's not the job you want to have. You know, it's just it's sad. But here's, here's the other reason it doesn't work, too. And I'll say this and everybody will be like, oh, yeah.\n\nYou know, so you're given that tool and so let's say that you've got this technician who just became a technician and now she's doing these things and she's doing other things. Let's just say that she's busting her butt. Say that she's not doing fecal loops. She's not cleaning up exam rooms, but she's everywhere else doing all sorts of stuff.\n\nYou're telling me you're gonna fire this person because she doesn't clean fecal loops. That's what you're gonna tell me and again, I see people in that boat all the time. They're like, she has failed to follow this rule, and now she's being written up. And I'm like, yeah, now what you gonna do?\n\nYou're gonna fire her over this rule that's kind of dumb, or that's not really that big a deal, even though she has this massively positive impact in all these other areas? How about you just talk to her instead, you know, but, but that is when people realize, I think that's when people feel really powerless is because someone said, this is the tool.\n\nAnd when you first hear it, you're like, yep, that makes sense. And then you find yourself in the position I just described where you've got someone who did not buy into the why for this specific rule or these specific sets of rules, but otherwise are a good person who works hard and matches the values of the practice.\n\nAnd you're like, what are you going to do? You're going to continue to hammer on this person that's 85 percent good for your practice and your patients that the clients like or are you going to step back and have a conversation and just sort of like try to try to reach a middle ground here and try to try to understand each other but people skip that step and it's just it ends up in a sad place.\n\nStephanie Goss: I think it's really important to be able to ask yourself about the hill and, and whether this is, whether this is a hill to die on, because for some people and for some practices, it may be, it may be the fecal loops in the sink are absolutely unacceptable. And there may be a reason in that practice that that is the case. And that may be a choice that you want to make is like, if you cannot do this, you cannot work for our team. Okay. That's, you know, it's, it's your business and it's your choice and you, you can absolutely do that. And where I see this come up a lot to your point, Andy, of If they're doing everything else great and it has to do with being late. I see it so much where people are like, well, I have a doctor or I have a technician and they're amazing and they're always like 15 or 20 minutes late or they're always 10 minutes late.\n\nIf you are, and this is where it gets dicey for the people who, our can, our process people and systems people and control people is like, well, if you're going to hold everybody else accountable to this rule, but you're going to let them slide because they're doing everything else right, then how is it actually A, fair, and B, a rule. And I think this is where you have to ask yourself that question as a leader, which is, have I done my part? Because if there is a really strong why to having that, it is important that the team all be here so that we can be on time for our clients. That's a super valid why. And if you have a team member that you cannot hold accountable to that, it doesn't matter if they're a licensed technician or a doctor.\n\nIf you, if there is a strong why and there's buy in from the entire team, if you don't hold them accountable, that's how you help as a leader create a toxic environment in your practice. And so the flip side of this is, would I as a leader choose to have fecal loops be my thing? Probably not, man. I'm going to be honest with you.\n\nI'm going to let that one slide if they're doing everything else right. I'm going to try and find some middle ground. If it's something that the whole rest of the team agrees in, is bought in on, and there's a really strong compelling why. You absolutely have to, to work on that and deal with the person.\n\nAnd it may mean if you actually have told them and you actually have walked through the process and you have helped them, you can say, I've done everything I can to help them understand the why, that's a, that's a slippery slope if you don't do something about it.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, I agree. That's all I got.\n\nStephanie Goss: Whew, man! This one was a fun one. And look at that. It was our, it was our shortest episode, but yet we still managed to find lots to chat about.\n\nDr. Andy Roark: Yeah, sure. Our shortest, shortest question. Not our shortest episode.\n\nStephanie Goss: Our shortest question. Our shortest question. All right.

Guys, we got a great one for you today. The one and only Stephanie Goss is off today, but I am pulling in an amazing guest, a mentor of mine, someone I look up to. I'm just going to keep her secret here for a moment until I introduce her.\n\nBut we have a great episode about a doctor who is really slow in the exam rooms. Really slow. He's been there for nine months. The practice owner just really doesn't want to write him up because, hey, we don't want to take off the doctors, but he's falling behind and he's not getting his medical records done.\n\nAnd he's doing phone calls instead of coming to staff meetings. And worst of all, The other doctors are having to do some of his phone calls because people are waiting all day and he's not getting to them. And so other doctors are getting pulled in to help clean up and juggle these clients. And this is not good, but he just doesn't seem to see a problem with it.\n\nGuys, this is going to sound real familiar for a lot of you. And we got a fresh take on tackling it today. So it's going to be a great one. Let's get into it.\n\nAndy: And we are back. It's me, Dr. Andy Roark, and the one and only Dr. Amanda Donnelly. How are you, Amanda?\n\nAmanda: I am great, Andy! How are you?\n\nAndy: I am so great. I am thrilled to have you as my wingman and co host on today's episode. I have admired you for years. You've been someone who's been a mentor to me in my career. You are, for those who do not know you, you are a, you're a second generation veterinarian. You are a well renowned, world renowned, well renowned speaker. You've been the Practice Management Educator of the Year at the Western Vet Conference. You write a wonderful column in today's Veterinary Business Magazine that runs with the column that I write. And I always pull your stuff and want to read and see and see what you're doing and see what you're talking about.\n\nYou have probably written, probably I don't think I don't think I'm trying to think of anything that might compete with it. You have written probably my favorite book in veterinary veterinary leadership, veterinary management. It's called ‘Leading and Managing Veterinary Teams‘. I am thrilled to have you here. Have you been?\n\nAmanda: I’ve been good. And thank you for all those wonderful accolades. I really appreciate it. I've been super busy. That's it. That's a good, that's a good thing. It's a good time to be in veterinary practice management and speaking.\n\nAndy: It is. To you, number, so just a side before we get started, when, when you're talking about looking at practices and working with them, are you, are you. How much emphasis are you getting on going faster? Is this, are you getting a big push for increasing efficiency? Cause well I just came back from the VMX conference and that's what I heard about again and again was people saying, how do we go faster?\n\nAnd I thought that was kind of odd, it wasn't what I was expecting. Do you, have you had that experience?\n\nAmanda: Well, you know, what's interesting, what I have found is that yes, increasing efficiency is still incredibly relevant even now that we've come out of the pandemic years. But I am hearing a lot more reports about practices slowing down. So the efficiency point, you know, really That needs to happen But some of the practices at least some of the ones that i'm working with and that I talk to The, they're concerned about making sure that they are getting more clients in, you know?\n\nAndy: That's why that's why I was surprised. So, so in Uncharted, you know, we always watch trends and talk, talk with our practices that are, that are members and things. And we had, in the last quarter of the year, we saw a pretty marked slowdown. It's very regional. Some people were like, we see no change, but we were having some that were having pretty substantial drops in their, in their clients coming in.\n\nIt was, it was, that's why it was so interesting at, at VMX. I would talk to groups that were like, oh, we really beating the demand. It's going to be huge. And I. I thought, man, that's, that's not what I'm, what I'm sort of seeing. That's kind of why I was sort of fishing to see, see where your head was at.\n\nI'm really sort of talking to people about go ahead, making sure you're gearing up your client reminders. You're getting your, your marketing back on point because we didn't have to deal with that for a long time. We had more work than we could do. But I think we're, it's time to start reengaging our client communications to make sure that if a demand for vet services starts to dip, the individual practices is, is taken care of as they can be.\n\nAmanda: Yeah. Yeah. No, I couldn't agree more. And I have gotten a surge in the last six months of people asking me to help with client service and client communications. And nobody had time for that, you know, from 2020 to 2022.\n\nAndy: do think that fell off. Yeah, I think I think you're spot on I think I think everything swings like a pendulum, you know, I think there's when everybody was swamped and trying to doggy paddle keep their head above water The client service part was not high on their priority list and you are swinging that swinging back.\n\nI think clients are a bit more discerning right now. I think that they're kind of looking for reasons to keep their wallet in their pocket, not just in that medicine, but in everything. And I think that client service communication part, the education importance is climbing back up, which is good to see, but always changing.\n\nHey, I got a I got a case for you from our mailbag. And I thought you would be uniquely suited to come in and help me sort of break it down. Is that okay?\n\nAmanda: Hit me with it.\n\nAndy: All right, cool. So there's a little bit to it, but basically here goes so so we got an email from a practice manager and they're in a four doctor practice and they say they have a great culture and they got a fantastic team but they're having a hard time with one of the Doctors.\n\nThey said he's an excellent vet when it comes to clients. Most of them love him and he's pretty good producer too. He can sometimes run behind because he has his quote special clients unquote. That while they do spend a lot of money at the clinic, he ends up chatting with them for a long time. So I don't know.\n\nMaybe you can make an argument that's concierge care. I don't know. We'll come back to it. We've tried extending his appointment times for those certain clients, but then he's still like whatever time he has, he just takes that time. Plus 30%. Like, so if you give him more time, it just seems like it gets, it gets longer.\n\nHe also has a bad habit of not finishing up his charts, and he runs behinds on phone calls, so he ends up using like, if they have a staff meeting, he's never there, because he's always trying to get his charts done or his phone calls. Stuff like that. It's frustrating to some of the other doctors. I think one of the things that would frustrate me is that some of the phone calls are falling on other doctors because clients are mad because he's not getting back to them, so the other doctor's having to call.\n\nAnd so that's a problem. It sounds like these guys are running a really good ship. When they, when they talk to him about, about it, and they talk to him about running behind, he says that if he had more technicians, he'd be able to do more. But, but they've got a three to one tech to doctor ratio, which again, sounds really solid.\n\nAnd the other doctors are making it just, just fine. And so anyway, I think that that's the main thing. They've brought up dictation softwares and, and he says he just, he, he thinks it's faster to type and it just, it seems like I've got a frustrated manager here who's really trying to throw everything at this doctor.\n\nTo get him get him out of the rooms and get him back on track And he's just not I don't know if it's a self awareness thing, but he's he just doesn't seem motivated. Now, I will also say, I know you see this a lot doctor retention is important at practices. Right now doctors are very hard to find and we all have the interest of keeping our cultures good and we want to motivate people the nice way and we like to retain our doctors if we can because it does sound like this guy generally is doing a good job and is popular.\n\nIt's just this point of frustration that's dragging them down. So. When I tell you all that, Amanda, sort of lay it down, let's, let's start with head space here. So, so put yourself in the shoes of the manager. What, what are you going to think of so that you can be productive in this situation? What do you think?\n\nWhat do you think people need to kind of understand about positions like this?\n\nAmanda: Well, this is an awesome question. First of all, I've just got to say, because I have heard similar challenges from other managers. So I love that we're talking about this and clearly it sounds like she's super frustrated and understandably so and, and stressed, you know, because now she has a doctor who should be doing his work, but she's having to spend all of this time trying to get him to be more efficient.\n\nWhich, you know, if he was doing his job, she wouldn't have to be spending time on that. And so that's a problem. Um, so, I mean, if I think about, you know, like, what is she thinking in her perspective, I'm assuming that she sees this as a lack of accountability. He's not doing the same thing that the other doctors are doing.\n\nYou know, maybe she even feels he's not being a good role model you know, for the rest of the team. So, but I think the main thing, you know, for the manager is just this frustration about how do I get this guy to do– this doctor to do what he's supposed to do,\n\nAndy: I think you touched on one of the big ones for me is it's really easy to tell yourself stories about this. You know what I mean? Like, he's lazy. He doesn't, especially when you talk to the person, their behavior doesn't change and start to be like, he's, he's acting like he cares, but he doesn't care. He's not taking this seriously.\n\nAnd My, sort of my, that's my part for Headspace, is I look at this and say, I really appreciate how this person wrote into the mailbag, because it does not feel like they have, they're frustrated, it does not feel like they have tipped over into the point of being just, enraged or, or just going down an aggressive sort of toxic path.\n\nAnd it's again, you can be, one of my friends calls it justifiable anger. It's like you can easily justify this anger and also know that carrying that anger around when you plan to deal with this is probably just going to get in your way and reduce your chances of being effective.\n\nAmanda: Yeah, it sounds like the manager has actually been incredibly helpful to try to help this doctor. So I agree with what you're saying.\n\nAndy: I also, you know, I think they mentioned the team a number of times and you get into headspace and You know, I think one of the big things for me when we talk about Just management in general. I'm a big fan of the idea that we're all trying to achieve balance, which is I do want to support this doctor. But also I can't have my other doctors being mad because they're doing calls to frustrated clients who've been waiting all day to be talked to like that's not Okay.\n\nAnd I'm a big deal. I'm a big fan of like medical records are part of being on the team, especially if we're in doing modern medicine, where we pass cases around, where we try to leverage our technicians, where the front desk is doing communication for us. You can't not write up your charts because you're really letting down the whole team.\n\nAnd again, I don't think this comes from a, I have never seen an evil doctor. That's just like, I don't care. I just, I know that they're. busy, and I know they're getting behind. I just, for me you can hold two things in your mind at the same time. You can decide that this person's behavior is not okay, and also empathize and be like, hey, I know what it's like.\n\nWe're all, we're trying to do a good job. I suspect oftentimes when I see doctors like this, like relationships are a big motivator for them. You know, it's, it's, it's their, it's their love languages, relationships, and maintaining relationships, and so the idea of cutting people short. It's just, it's, it's very hard for them and it can also be unacceptable to our team.\n\nBoth of those things can be true.\n\nAmanda: Yeah. I think what really jumps out at me when you talk about this case is, you know, what, what is the doctor thing? Cause they keep asking him to, to, to be on time and, you know, and he's, he's not wanting to change his behavior. And so what jumps out at me is that he probably doesn't think this is a big problem, or, or presumably he would have made some changes.\n\nAnd what is fascinating to me, and I've seen this with other doctors in my entire life and career, is that they'll help one client and go overboard to help them, or I've had other doctors that run behind. Either because they don't have good communication skills or they chat too much with clients or whatnot.\n\nAnd so, like you said, they have this desire to have this great relationship, but then what they forget is what about all the other clients that they're not taking care of? So, not doing the callbacks, not having the charts done. That is hurting those clients. And what about the clients that are waiting?\n\nYou know, so, you know, because you're running behind so we're really not, you know, serving all of the clients Well with his type of behavior and as you also said there's an impact on the team So I think that is I don't think he's really appreciating the impact on the team, the other clients, and then of course the business at large\n\nAndy: Yeah. You're speaking at the Uncharted Practice Manager Summit on February 28th. It's a virtual conference that is only for practice managers. And so it's a one day event, you're doing a workshop called how to create a culture of accountability. And you mentioned accountability here as well.\n\nTalk to me a little bit about what that culture of accountability would look like. So I think that's good headspace before we actually address this doctor. How does that, how does that sort of start to come together in the mind of the practice manager?\n\nAmanda: Well, I think that, yes, you're right. I love talking about accountability and I'm happy to be able to talk about this at your conference. I think that so much of accountability is the doctor doesn't, is, is trying to figure out what is the underlying cause and, you know, with him, I think it's, it's a little different, you know, being in a doctor situation, maybe, but I think he doesn't understand the ramifications of his behavior, but also made, I don't know, maybe the expectations were never clearly established at the very beginning.\n\nSo we've got, you know, so one of the causes of lack of accountability can be lack of clarity. Now, they keep saying. You need to do your records on time, or you need to be on time, or we're going to pull you out of the room, you know, those kinds of things. But fundamentally, he's been practicing for whatever period of time and, and, and another cause of lack of accountability can be lack of consequences.\n\nSo if there's not any. ramifications or consequences for him continuing this behavior, he's going to keep doing it. And then I think what happens is the lack of clarity here might be maybe he doesn't have written job expectations. Maybe, you know, the parameters he has to work within haven't been established.\n\nBut also what happens so often is what I find is that managers or medical directors, they might talk to an employee, in this case, it's the doctor, but it starts to really sort of just be tuned out and sound like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah to the person who's receiving it because they're like, yeah, they're nagging me.\n\nBut, you know, I'm doing, you know, people like me, you know, I'm making the practice money. I'm helping these clients. And so they just, they don't see the big picture. So part of it is figuring out maybe from a lack of accountability is we have to set those what are the policies and protocols that a person needs to work within and what are the consequences of not doing it.\n\nBut I also think in this case, especially since he's a doctor, Andy, is he's in a leadership position and I don't, I think a lot, a lot of times associates don't necessarily think, oh, wait a minute, you know, I, I got that DVM and along with it, I got, I also had this leadership certification, whether I want it or not.\n\nAnd so, that's where part of the lack of accountability piece also, you know, dovetails into self leadership and getting him to identify, you know, some of the things that he needs to do, which we can talk about some of the solutions, but I do think that that's a lot of what's going on here, too, is not just the lack of accountability, although there is that, that he's not taking ownership of, but then there's also a lack of leadership skills on his part.\n\nAndy: I agree with that. I think that's a really good point. I like– you put your finger right on the doctor as the leader and sort of, you know, people, people have a responsibility because of their title. And so I think that's interesting. I want to unpack the self leadership part with you in a second. But have you so you I think you're spot on about a possibly just say a lack of clarity, clear job expectations. I think it's fair to say, Hey, our expectation is that clients get called back within a certain time that you write your charts up. That's a very easy expectation to set things like that, that other doctors don't have to step in and do parts of your work for you. Are there, are there other expectations? How do you set expectations for staying on time, Amanda? Because it's kind of, at least for me and my career, it's always kind of been a willy nilly thing of nobody really, it wasn't ever like, I'm sorry, Andy, if you have a 30 minute appointment.\n\nAnd it starts at 2:30, at 3 p. m. you need to be out of that room. And I've never, I've never been held to that standard. And I think, you know, different cases involve different things. How do you set expectations for people staying on time? Have you ever seen something like that where there's a metric where, I mean, honestly, I, they have already done the thing of sending the technician in with a code to say, really, we need to move on.\n\nBut is, how do you set clarity around, hey, this is the pace we would like for you to keep up? Have you seen that?\n\nAmanda: Well, yes, and no, I guess it's, I'm going to waffle a little bit because yes, I've seen the expectations be put in place, but, and I've seen people that run on time and people who don't because this reminds me, this reminds me of a relatively young doctor that I worked with a couple of years ago, who was, who was always 30 minutes or more behind and the rest of the practice was not.\n\nAnd it was definitely how he managed his time, but all, but it was very specifically how he communicated with clients. So, the fix wasn't to say just the expectations are for you to run on time because he just, he couldn't, he couldn't adhere. I mean, he basically couldn't meet the expectations. So the fix wasn't just about setting expectations, it became helping him with some client communication skills and a few other strategies for how he could\n\nbe on time. You know, how he could change his client conversations maybe leverage the staff up a little bit, but I think part of this is going to be with this particular doctor is helping him with some leadership coaching and some client communications training and also. I think the question is, well, why do these expectations, you know, even exist?\n\nAnd I still think too, another thing that we didn't really hit on is why can the other doctors all run on time pretty much? And he can't like, what is the difference? And I'm guessing that the difference is that he spends too much time in the room, but see, it might just not be chitchat. Maybe the staff thinks it's chitchat, but maybe he doesn't run an organized appointment.\n\nMaybe he's all over the map. See, maybe he's like, Oh, we could do this. We could do that. And I don't know, you know, so there, there, there could be an organizational flow issue that we need to, you know, videotaping his appointments might be really helpful, but I think you have to drill into that. Yeah. And determine if there is something missing here that he needs help or training with why he can't do it, why he can't adhere to the same time limitations as the other doctors.\n\nSo I think there's that piece to maybe dissect a little bit. But then fundamentally, very much, this is going to be, I think, a coaching opportunity.\n\nAndy: I, I, I like that a lot. I think that's a, I think that's a really good call out. Again, I said, you know, we yeah, be careful what the stories we tell ourselves. I think your idea of what if he's what if it's not chit chat? What if he really just does not have an organized way to approach his appointments or he's not he's not good at creating, you know treatment plans that are concrete and presenting them in an actionable way I think that's a really good call. So, you talked about Self leadership.\n\nYou said, you know, so I'm totally with you on the idea that, that the doctor is looked up to and, and is sort of setting a precedent and a tone sort of for the team. And by the role of doctor, you have certain leadership responsibilities. And so talk to me a little bit about the term self leadership, and ike, what is that? How is that different from just saying the doctor is a leader? Unpack that for me.\n\nAmanda: Well, if you look at definitions, and I try to keep this pretty simple, but if you look at, like, what's the definition of self leadership, it's going to be that process of influencing your own thoughts and actions towards achieving your goals. And the goals, some of the goals here, of course, that we're referencing would be the hospital goals of seeing not only seeing all of our patients and taking care of them, but also excellent client care.\n\nBut it is that it's that process. It's that self process. So it's the process of influencing your own thoughts and actions towards achieving. You know, whatever the goals are your own personal goals or the goals that, you know, have been put upon you. So, in this instance, it would be looking at the piece that I think might be missing here for him is that I'm not sure there's any self reflection going on.\n\nSo, self leadership requires self reflection. What's working well for me? What's not working so well for me? How am I impacting others? You know, how am I how can I change? See, I don't think he, I don't think he sees the, from what we know, it doesn't appear that he sees the need fundamentally to change. He, he knows they want him to change, but I don't think he really feels the need.\n\nAnd I think with self leadership what, what the action about is, is identifying, well, okay, what, what needs to change, you know, that would make everything better, you know, would help the team, would help my coworkers, would help the clients, would help. Cause see, he could actually see more patients.\n\nIf he was able to be more efficient. So it's, it's the self reflection of, oh, wait a minute. Okay. Maybe there is something here. They're not just nagging me and, and getting him to self-reflect. I think that's going to be a real important for him to see that his leadership, see doctors.\n\nAssociate doctors may think that their self leadership or their leadership role at the practice is just to direct traffic, which is, of course, true. You know, I need you to call this client. I need you to set this IV catheter, whatever, but it's also about. bringing a team together and, and he's creating chaos, you know, sometimes for the team, he's not bringing the team together.\n\nHe's not being a role model. So the self leadership part of that is helping him understand that, that it's not only about the medicine. And that's the part I think that associates miss is that whether they want to have the leadership role or not. They do have it as it relates to the team. It's not just about patient care and client care.\n\nIt's how they interface with, with helping the team and getting the best client service, the best patient care throughout the day. And that's the piece that I think he's not seeing that some of these individual actions have a greater, broader impact on the business. And specifically, you know, when I say the business, I mean, client care, potentially patient care, but very much the efficiency of the practice, the stress of the team, you know, now somebody is having to try to pull them out of a room.\n\nAnd I think the biggest thing here, and we can get into this more, but I feel that this manager is perhaps thinking that this is like her problem to solve. And I'm like, wait a minute. It's like if they're if they're saying, oh, we could do dictation software and oh, we could, you know, we could give you more staff or oh, we could change this protocol or oh, we could get have, you know, pull you out of a room.\n\nIt's like the practice is doing all this work to try to help him. What is he doing? I mean, he's not taking ownership is what I'm saying.\n\nAndy: Oh, I, I, you just blew my mind. I, I love that you called that out at some point. We've all probably been in a relationship where we work too damn hard to make the relationship work and we just didn't feel like the other person was, you know, was coming with their half of the relationship. And so I think, I think that's, I think that's a really good headspace.\n\nI am chomping at the bit to dive into this a little bit and start to say, well, how do we actually move this case forward? Let's take a quick break and we'll come back and then we'll get into the action steps. Sound good?\n\nAmanda: Yeah, that sounds great.\n\nStephanie Goss: Did you know that we offer workshops for our Uncharted members and for our non members? So if you're listening to today's podcast and you are not a member of Uncharted yet, you should be, but this is not a conversation about joining Uncharted. This is a conversation about all of the amazing content that we have coming at all of you, whether or not you're a member through our workshop series.\n\nYou should head over to the website at unchartedvet.com/events and check out what is coming. We have got an amazing lineup on the regular. We've got something every month, sometimes two or three things in a month coming at you to expand your brain, to talk about leadership, to talk about practice management and dive into the kind of topics that Andy and I talk about on the podcast every week.\n\nSo now's your chance. Stop what you're doing. Pick up your cell phone. I know it's not far from you and type in unchartedvet.com/events. See what's coming and sign up. They are always free to our uncharted members and they have a small fee attached to them. If you are not currently a member, you can get all of the details, pricing, dates, times, and register head over to the website.\n\nNow I want to see ya there.\n\nAndy: Alright, so let's, let's get in this unpack what our actual strategy is going to be.\n\nSo we've got this manager who's asked us, and I may not have mentioned at the beginning, this doctor has only been there nine months. It's not 90 days, but in their practice, it's fairly new. I feel a sense of urgency here. And I don't know if you would agree and you would say, no, that's not, it's not a problem for me.\n\nI'm going. This feels like an important time, and if we kind of take our foot off the gas here, or just let it ride for a while, then some of these behaviors are going to really crystallize and be a problem later on. So I, I'm wondering if you're feeling a sense of urgency, but as we, we sit down and we've got this manager and we say, all right, let's decide what we're going to actually do.\n\nWhere, where do you start with this, Amanda? Kind of what's the first thing you'd say? This is on the action plan.\n\nAmanda: Well, I think the first is so often we don't have a job description for veterinarians and that's going to be pretty streamlined because it's going to say the obligatory information about. You know, their patient care and if they do surgery and all of that, but what I'm talking about is what we want to put in writing, what are the job expectations?\n\nAnd I'm, I'm referring to these types of job expectations that records will be written up in a timely manner. And of course you have to define, well, what is a timely manner? So you can't just say, you know, timely, cause that might be a week to them.\n\nAndy: Sure, that's, that's, that's seven days, in my mind.\n\nAmanda: But I do, I do think we need to start with putting the expectations in writing so that that could be given to him.\n\nAnd of course, key point here, that expectation should be given to all the associates, not just him. But then I think the core crux of all of these action steps are mostly. Going to be coaching sessions with him and recognizing that it won't be a one and done. I don't see this as 1 conversation and oh, that's magically going to fix everything.\n\nSo I think it's going to be a series of conversations, which I would love to talk about some of those. The nuances of those conversations, but, but the reason I say that it's mostly going to be about conversations with him is this seems to be a people problem, not a systems problem because everybody else apparently is running on time.\n\nAnd this is, this is a doctor, you know, whatever this doctor you know, it's their problem. So that's where we get into these one on one sessions and and I think with those one on one sessions, there are. Really two key components. One, we already hit on, which is that rather than coming at him and saying, we need you to do this, we need you to do that, which is going to sound like the nagging and it's kind of puts the, it's like, it's the practices job to solve this instead.\n\nFundamentally, that conversation needs to be about what will you do? What will you do to be on time? What will you do to get your charts written, you know, in a timely manner, just like all the other doctors? What will you do? So now he may not have all those answers in the first meeting. And in fact, I'm all forgiving someone time, you know, a day or two.\n\nYou know, a couple of days to think about that because they might, you know, and, and, and they might, this manager might get pushback. He might be, well, what do you mean? What am I going to do? I've, you know, I'm going to try to type faster, which we know doesn't work. So, that's one thing. But another awesome part of this that I think has to be touched on Andy.\n\nIs to make this conversation about alignment with the core values of the practice. Now, you probably know I'm a huge fan of leading and managing by core values. I think most of chapter two in my book is about that. So hopefully this is a practice that already has core values in place. But even if they don't have them written and, and well defined, they still know what they are.\n\nSo, in this case, the core values that I would say most practices, if not all, have, whether they're clearly defined or not, the three that immediately would come to mind in this scenario are going to be teamwork, respect, and client care. So I would come up with, you know, what's 1 or 2 of the core values that they either already have or fundamentally know that they have and get him to see that his behavior is not aligned with a core value because he's not fulfilling his role of the team.\n\nHe's you know, the team can't operate, you know, effectively because of his actions. Client care is suffering because now we've got clients that are mad that they're not getting their lab results on time or he's not they're having to wait because he's, you know, spending so much time with the first client.\n\nAnd then all of that, you know, respect becomes an issue, you know, cause it's like I fundamentally just to be clear. I do not think this is a bad doctor in any way, shape, or form. I think he just doesn't appreciate, maybe, the ramifications and impact that he's having on this, on this team. And so, when I say, you know, respect, that's what he's got to, has to understand is that it is a lack of respect, though, when he just keeps on keeping on doing what he wants to do without regard to how it affects the rest of the team.\n\nWhen you change the conversation to talk about the core values, Now all of a sudden it's a different conversation that takes it out. It takes away that nagging. So we're not just saying, Oh, you need to do this, which sounds like nagging. It's like, gosh, we need everybody to adhere to our core values. These are the ways in which your behavior is not aligned with those.\n\nAnd then that, you know, so that's kind of the drop back. I guess is what I'm saying to the coaching conversations that we want to have with him.\n\nAndy: Yeah, well, before the break, you were talking about getting him to sort of self-reflect and my question to you was really going to be, how do you do, how do you do that? How do you, how do you get that self awareness? I think there's a lot of people who struggle with doctors, but, but honestly, anybody on your team who just lacks self awareness, and you say, how do you do this?\n\nIt sounds like you're going to try to use the core values to push that self awareness component to say, this is, this is how you're being perceived, or this is the actions, this is what, this is the impact that your actions are having, trying to get them to trigger a look at their, at their own behavior.\n\nIs that as, am I right on that?\n\nAmanda: Yes. And to your– to the 1st, half of your question there, which I'm so glad you ask the really key part of this to get him to self anybody to self reflect. The beauty of that is through the open ended question, so you could have the open ended question has to be inviting them to tell you their story or inviting them to give you input or feedback.\n\nSo, if you say, you know, do you appreciate the negative impact this is having on the team? See, that's closed ended, right? Because they can go, well, no, but that's not what you want. We've got to change that and say, how do you think you running behind is affecting our other clients? How do you think you having to be called out of rooms or not running on time? You know, how do you think that affects our clients who are waiting?\n\nHow do you think that affects the team and then also part of the self reflection is you kno"
