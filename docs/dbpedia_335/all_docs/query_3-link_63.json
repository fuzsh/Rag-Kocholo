        "text": "32:1 -- Boethius's first wife was Elpis, daughter of Festus: his second was Rusticiana, daughter of Symmachus, a senator and consul, A.D. 4 85. His second wife was the mother of the two sons mentioned below. (See Appendix,, p. 169.) Page 33\n\nthereby glory for your talent and your eloquence: when in the circus you sat in the place of honour between the c onsuls, and by a display of lavishness worthy of a triumphing general, you pleased to the full the multitude who were crowded around in expectation.\n\n'While Fortune then favoured you, it seems you flaunted her, though she cher ished you as her own darling. You carried off a bounty which she had never granted to any citizen before. Will you then balance accounts with Fortune? This is the first time that she has looked upon you with a grudging eye. If you think of your happ y and unhappy circumstances both in number and in kind, you will not be able to say that you have not been fortunate until now. And if you think that you were not fortunate because these things have passed away which then seemed to bring happiness, t hese things too are passing away, which you now hold to be miserable, wherefore you cannot think that you are wretched now. Is this your first entrance upon the stage of life? Are you come here unprepared and a stranger to the scene? Think you that there is any certainty in the affairs of mankind, when you know that often one swift hour can utterly destroy a man? For though the chances of life may seldom be depended upon, yet the last day of a lifetime seems to be the end of Fortune's power, th ough it perhaps would stay. What, think you, should we therefore say; that you desert her by dying, or that she deserts you by leaving you? '\n\nPage 34\n\n'When o'er the heaven Phoebus from his rose- red car begins to shed his light abroad, his flames oppress the paling stars and blunt their whitened rays. When the grove grows bright in spring with roses 'neath the west wind's warming breath, let but the cloudy gale once wildly blow, and their be auty is gone, the thorns alone remain. Often the sea is calmly glistening bright with all untroubled waves, but as often does the north wind stir them up, making the troubling tempest boil. If then the earth's own covering so seldom constant stays, if its changes are so great, shalt thou trust the brittle fortunes of mankind, have faith in fleeting good? For this is sure, and this is fixed by everlasting law, that naught which is brought to birth shall constant here abide.'\n\n&n bsp;Then I answered her,' Cherisher of all the virtues, you tell me but the truth: I cannot deny my rapid successes and my prosperity. But it is such remembrances that torment me more than others. For of all suffering from Fortune, the unhappiest mis fortune is to have known a happy fortune.'\n\n'But,' said Philosophy,' you are paying the him penalty for your mistaken expectations, and with this you cannot justly charge your life's circumstances. If you are affected by thi s empty name of Fortune's gift of happiness, you must listen while I recall how many and how great are your sources of happiness: and thus, if you have possessed that which is the most\n\nPage 35\n\nprecious among all Fortun e's gifts, and if that is still safe and unharmed in your possession, you will never, while you keep these better gifts, be able to justly charge Fortune with unkindness. Firstly, your wife's father, Symmachus, is still living and hale; and what more p recious glory has the human race than him? And he, because your worth is undiminished and your life still so valuable, is mourning for the injustice you suffer, this man who is wholly made up of wisdom and virtue. Again, your wife lives, a woman whose character is full of virtue, whose modesty excels its kind; a woman who (to put in a word the gifts she brought you) is like her father. She lives, and, hating this life, for your sake alone she clings to it. Herein only will I yield to allow you unh appiness; she pines with tears and grief through her longing for you. Need I speak of your sons who have both been consuls, and whose lives, as when they were boys, are yet bright with the character of their grandfather and their father? Wherefore, sin ce mortals desire exceedingly to keep a hold on life, how happy you should be, knew you but your blessings, since you have still what none doubts to be dearer than life itself? Wherefore now dry your tears. For- tune's hatred has not yet been so great as to destroy all your holds upon happiness: the tempest that is fallen upon you is not too great for you: your anchors hold yet firm, and they should keep ever nigh to you confidence in the present and hope for future time. Page 36< br>\n\n'And may they continue to hold fast,' said I,'that is my prayer: while they are firm, we will reach the end of our voyage, however things may be. But you see how much my glory has departed.'\n\n&nbsp ;And she answered,' We have made some progress, if you are not now weary entirely of your present lot. But I cannot bear this dallying so softly, so long as you complain that your happiness lacks aught, so long as you are full of sorrow and care. Whos e happiness is so firmly established that he has no quarrel from any side with his estate of life? For the condition of our welfare is a matter fraught with care: either its completeness never appears, or it never remains. One man's wealth is abundant , but his birth and breeding put him to shame. Another is famous for his noble birth, but would rather be unknown because he is hampered by his narrow means. A third is blessed with wealth and breeding, but bewails his life because he has no wife. Ano ther is happy in his marriage, but has no children, and saves his wealth only for an heir that is no son of his. Another is blessed with children, but weeps tears of sorrow for the misdeeds of son or daughter. So none is readily at peace with the lot h is fortune sends him. For in each case there is that which is unknown to him who has not experienced it, and which brings horror to him who has experienced it. Consider further, that the feelings of the most fortunate men are the most easily affected, wherefore, unless all\n\nPage 37\n\ntheir desires are supplied, such men, being unused to all adversity, are cast down by every little care: so small are the troubles which can rob them of complete ha ppiness.\n\n'How many are they, think you, who would think themselves raised to heaven if the smallest part of the remnants of your good fortune fell to them? This very place, which you call a place of exile, is home to those wh o live herein. Thus there is nothing wretched unless you think it to be so: and in like manner he who bears all with a calm mind finds his lot wholly blessed. Who is so happy but would wish to change his estate, if he yields to impatience of his lot? W ith how much bitterness is the sweetness of man's life mingled! For even though its enjoyment seem pleasant, yet it may not be surely kept from departing when it will. It is plain then how wretched is the happiness of mortal life which neither endures for ever with men of calm mind, nor ever wholly delights the care-ridden. Wherefore, then, O mortal men, seek ye that happiness without, which lies within yourselves? Ye are confounded by error and ignorance. I will shew you as shortly as I may, th e pole on which turns the highest happiness. Is there aught that you value more highly than your own self? You will answer that there is nothing. If then you are master of yourself, you will be in possession of that which you will never wish to lose, a nd which Fortune will never be able to take from you. Yet consider this further, that you may\n\nPage 38\n\nbe assured that happiness cannot be fixed in matters of chance: if happiness is the highest good of a man who lives his life by reason, and if that which can by any means be snatched away, is not the highest good (since that which is best cannot be snatched away), it is plain that Fortune by its own uncertainty can never come near to reaching happiness. Further, the ma n who is borne along by a happiness which may stumble, either knows that it may change, or knows it not: if he knows it not, what happiness can there be in the blindness of ignorance ? If he knows it, he must needs live in fear of losing that which he cannot doubt that he may lose; wherefore an ever-present fear allows not such an one to be happy. Or at any rate, if he lose it without unhappiness, does he not think it worthless? For that, whose loss can be calmly borne, is indeed a small good. You, I know well, are firmly persuaded that men's understandings can never die; this truth is planted deep in you by many proofs: since then it is plain that the happiness of fortune is bounded by the death of the body, you cannot doubt that, if death can carry away happiness, the whole race of mortals is sinking into wretchedness to be found upon the border of death. But we know that many have sought the enjoyment of happiness not only by death, but even by sorrow and sufferings: how then can the pres ence of this life make us happy, when its end cannot make us unhappy? Page 39\n\n'He that would build on a lasting resting-place; who would be firm to resist the blasts of the storming wind; who se eks, too, safety where he may contemn the surge and threatening of the sea; must leave the lofty mountain's top, and leave the thirsting sands. The hill is swept by all the might of the headstrong gale: the sands dissolve, and will not bear the load u pon them. Let him fly the danger in a lot which is pleasant rest unto the eye: let him be mindful to set his house surely upon the lowly rock. Then let the wind bellow, confounding wreckage in the sea, and thou wilt still be founded upon unmoving peace , wilt be blessed in the strength of thy defence: thy life will be spent in calmness, and thou mayest mock the raging passions of the air.\n\n'But now,' she continued,' the first remedies of reasoning are reaching you more dee ply, and I think I should now use those that are somewhat stronger. If the gifts of Fortune fade not nor pass quickly away, even so, what is there in them which could ever be truly yours, or which would not lose its value when examined or thought upon?\n\n'Are riches valuable for their own nature, or on account of your and other men's natures? Which is the more valuable, the gold itself or the power of the stored up-money? Surely wealth shines more brightly when spent than whe n put away in masses. Avarice ever brings hatred, while generous spending brings honour.\n\nPage 40\n\nBut that cannot remain with one person which is handed over to another: therefore money becomes valuable to its possessor wh en, by being scattered, it is transferred to others, and ceases to be possessed. And if all that is heaped together among mankind comes to one man, it makes the others all poor. A voice indeed fills equally the ears of all that hear: but your riches c annot pass to others without being lessened: and when they pass, they make poor those whom they leave. How strait then and poor are those riches, which most men may not have, and which can only come to one by making others poor!\n\n&nb sp;'Think again of precious stones: does their gleam attract your eyes? But any excellence they have is their own brilliance, and belongs not to men: wherefore I am amazed that men so strongly admire them. What manner of thing can that be which has no mind to influence, which has no structure of parts, and yet can justly seem to a living, reasoning mind to be beautiful? Though they be works of their creator, and by their own beauty and adornment have a certain low beauty, yet are they in rank lowe r than your own excellence, and have in no wise deserved your admiration.\n\n'Does the beauty of landscape delight you? '\n\n'Surely, for it is a beautiful part of a beautiful creation: and in like manner w e rejoice at times in the appearance of a calm sea, and we admire the sky, the stars, the sun, and the moon.\n\nPage 41\n\n'Does any one of these,' said she,' concern you? Dare you boast yourself of the spl endid beauty of any one of such things? Are you yourself adorned by the flowers of spring? Is it your richness that swells the fruits of autumn? Why are you carried away by empty rejoicing. Why do you embrace as your own the good things which are outs ide yourself? Fortune will never make yours what Nature has made to belong to other things. The fruits of the earth should doubtless serve as nourishment for living beings, but if you would satisfy your need as fully as Nature needs, you need not the a bundance of Fortune. Nature is content with very little, and if you seek to thrust upon her more than is enough, then what you cast in will become either unpleasing or even harmful\n\n'Again, you think that you appear beautiful i n many kinds of clothing. But if their form is pleasant to the eyes, I would admire the nature of the material or the skill of the maker. Or are you made happy by a long line of attendants? Surely if they are vicious, they are but . a burden to the h ouse, and full of injury to their master himself; while if they are honest, how can the honesty of others be counted among your possessions?\n\n'Out of all these possessions, then, which you reckon as your wealth, not one can re ally be shown to be your own. For if they have no beauty for you to acquire, what have they for which you should grieve if you lose them, or in keeping which you should rejoice? And if\n\nPage 42\n\nthey are beautiful by their own nature, how are you the richer thereby? For these would have been pleasing of themselves, though cut out from your possessions. They do not become valuable by reason that they have come into your wealth; but you have desired to count them among yo ur wealth, because they seemed valuable. Why then do you long for them with such railing against Fortune? You seek, I believe, to put want to flight by means of plenty. But you find that the opposite results. The more various is the beauty of furniture , the more helps are needed to keep it beautiful;and it is ever true that they who have much, need much; and on the other hand, they need least who measure their wealth by the needs of nature, not by excess of display.\n\nIs ther e then no good which belongs to you and is implanted within you, that you seek your good things elsewhere, in things without you and separate from you? Have things taken such a turn that the animal, whose reason gives it a claim to divinity, cannot s eem beautiful to itself except by the possession of. lifeless trappings? Other classes of things are satisfied by their intrinsic possessions; but men, though made like God in understanding, seek to find among the lowest things adornment for their h igher nature: and you do not understand that you do a great wrong thereby to your Creator. He intended that the human race should be above all other earthly beings; yet you thrust down your honourable place below the lowest.\n\nPage 43\n\nFor if every good thing is allowed to be more valuable than that to which it belongs, surely you are putting yourselves lower than them in your estimation, since you think precious the most worthless of things; a nd this is indeed a just result. Since, then, this is the condition of human nature, that it surpasses other classes only when it realises what is in itself; as soon as it ceases to know itself, it must be reduced to a lower rank than the beasts. To ot her animals ignorance of themselves is natural; in men it is a fault. How plainly and how widely do you err by thinking that anything can be adorned by ornaments that belong to others! Surely that cannot be. For if anything becomes brilliant by additi ons thereto, the praise for the brilliance belongs to the additions. But the subject remains in its own vileness, though hidden and covered by these externals.\n\n'Again, I say that naught can be a good thing which does harm to its possessor. Am I wrong? \"No,\" you will say. Yet many a time do riches harm their possessors, since all base men, who are therefore the most covetous, think that they themselves alone are worthy to possess all gold and precious stones. You therefore, who now go in fear of the cudgel and sword of the robber, could laugh in his face if you had entered upon this path with empty pockets. 43: 1 -- This is an application of Juvenal's lines (Sat. x. 19)which contrast the terror of the money-laden traveller Page 44\n\nsurpassing blessing of mortal wealth! As soon as you have acquired it, your cares begin!\n\n'O happy was that early age of men, contented with their trusted and unfailing fields, nor ruined by the wealth that enervates. Easily was the acorn got that used to satisfy their longwhile fast. They knew not Bacchus' gifts, nor h oney mixed therewith. They knew not how to tinge with Tyre's purple dyes the sheen of China's silks. Their sleep kept health on rush and grass; the stream gave them to drink as it flowed by: the lofty pine to them gave shade. Not one of them yet clave the ocean's depths, nor, carrying stores of merchandise, had visited new shores. Then was not heard the battle's trump, nor had blood made red with bitter hate the bristling swords of war. For why should any madness urge to take up first their arms up on an enemy such ones as knew no sight of cruel wounds nor knew rewards that could be reaped in blood? Would that our times could but return to those old ways! but love of gain and greed of holding burn more fiercely far than &Etna's fires. Ah! who w as the wretch who first unearthed the mass of hidden gold, the gems that only longed to lie unfound? For full of danger was the prize he found.\n\n'What am I to say of power and of the with the careless happiness of the man who meets highwayman with no purse and empty pockets.\n\nPage 45\n\nhonours of office, which you raise to heaven because you know not true honoured power? What fires belched forth from &Etna's flames, what overwhelming flood could deal such ruin as these when they fall into the hands of evil men? I am sure you remember how your forefathers wished to do away with the consular power, which had been the very foundation of liberty, because of the overbearing pride of the cons uls, just as your ancestors had too in earlier times expunged from the state the name of king on account of the same pride. But if, as rarely happens, places of honour are granted to honest men, what else is delightful in them but the honesty they prac tise thereby? Wherefore honour comes not to virtue from holding office, but comes to office from virtues there practised.\n\n'But what is the power which you seek and esteem so highly? O creatures of the earth, can you not think over whom you are set? If you saw in a community of mice, one mouse asserting his rights and his power over the others, with what mirth you would greet the sight! Yet if you consider the body, what can you find weaker than humanity? Cannot a tiny gna t by its bite, or by creeping into the inmost parts, kill that body? How can any exercise right upon any other except upon the body alone, or that which is below the body, whereby I mean the fortunes? Can you ever impose any law upon a free spirit? Can you eyer disturb the peculiar restfulness which is the property of a mind that hangs together\n\nPage 46\n\nupon the firm basis of its reason? When a certain tyrant thought that by tortures he would compel a free manl to betray the conspirators in a plot against his life, the philosopher bit through his tongue and spat it out in the tyrant's face. Thus were the tortures, which the tyrant intended to have cruel results, turned by the philosoph er into subjects of high courage. Is there aught that one man can do to another, which he may not suffer from another in his turn? We have heard how Busiris, who used to kill strangers, was killed by Hercules when he came to Egypt. Regulus,2 who had cast into chains many a Carthaginian captive, soon yielded himself a prisoner to their chains. Do you think that power to be any power, whose possessor cannot ensure his own escape from suffering at another's hands what he inflicts upon some other?\n\n'Further, if there were any intrinsic good in the nature of honours and powers themselves, they could never crowd upon the basest men. For opposites will not be bound together. Nature refus es to allow contraries to be linked to each other. Wherefore, while it is un- doubted that for the most part offices of honour are enjoyed by bad men, it is also manifest that those things are not by nature good, which\n\n46:1 -- This story is told of Anaxagoras and Nicocreon, king of Cyprus, c. B.C. 323.\n\n46:2 -- Regulus was the Roman general in Sicily in the first Punic War, taken prisoner in 255 B.C., and put to death in 250.\n\nPage 47\n\nallow themselves to cling to evil men. And this indeed may worthily be held of all the gifts of fortune which come with the greatest success to the most unscrupulous. And in this matter we must also think on thi s fact, that no one doubts a man to be brave in whom he has found by examination that bravery is implanted: and whoever has the quality of swiftness is plainly swift. So also music makes men musical, medicine makes men physicians, oratory makes men orators. The nature of each quality acts as is peculiar to itself: it is not confused with the results of contrary qualities, but goes so far as to drive out those qualities which are opposed to it. Wealth cannot quench the insatiable thirst of avari ce: nor can power ever make master of himself the man whom vicious passions hold fast in un- breakable chains. Honours, when joined to dishonest men, so far from making them honour- able, betray them rather, and show them to be dishonourable. Why is t his so? It is because you rejoice to call things by false ¤ames which belong not to them ­ their names are refuted by the reality of their qualities: wherefore neither riches, nor that kind of power, nor these honours, can justly so be called. Las tly, we may come to the same conclusion concerning all the aspects of Fortune: nothing is to be sought in her, and it is plain she has no innate good, for she is not always joined with good men, nor does she make good those with whom she is joined.' Page 48\n\n'We have heard what ruin Nero wrought when Rome was burnt and senators were slain. We know how savagely he did to death his brother,l how he was stained by the spilling of his own mother's blood, and how he looked upon her cold body and yet no tear fell upon his cheek: yet could this man be judge of the morals that were dead. Nay, he was ruler of the peoples whom the sun looks upon from the time he rises in the east until he hides his rays beneath the waves, and those whom the chilling northern Wain o'errules, and those whom the southern gale burns with its dry blast, as it heats the burning sands. Say, could great power chasten Nero's maddened rage? Ah! heavy fate, how often is the sword of high injustice given where is already most poisonous cruelty!'\n\nThen I said,' You know that the vain-glory of this world has had but little influence over me; but I have desired the m eans of so managing affairs that virtue might not grow aged in silence.'\n\n'Yes,' said she,' but there is one thing which can attract minds, which, though by nature excelling, yet are not led by perfection to the furthest bound s of virtue; and that thing is the love of fame and reputation for deserving well of one's country. Think then thus upon it, and see that it is but a slight\n\n48:1 -- Britannicus, son of Nero's father, the Emperor Claudi us, put to death A.D. 55.\n\nPage 49\n\nthing of no weight. As you have learnt from astronomers' shewing, the whole circumference of the earth is but as a point compared with the size of the heavens. That is, if you compar e the earth with the circle of the universe, it must be reckoned as of no size at all. And of this tiny portion of the universe there is but a fourth part, as you have learnt from the demonstration of Ptolemæus,l which is inhabited by living beings known to us. If from this fourth part you imagine subtracted all that is covered by sea and marsh, and all the vast regions of thirsty desert, you will find but the narrowest space left for human habitation. And do you thi nk of setting forth your fame and publishing your name in this space, which is but as a point within another point so closely circumscribed? And what size or magnificence can fame have which is shut in by such close and narrow bounds? Further, this na rrow enclosure of habitation is peopled by many races of men which differ in language, in customs, and in their whole scheme of living;and owing to difficulty of travelling, differences of speech, and rareness of any intercourse, the fame of cities can not reach them, much less the fame of men. Has not Cicero written somewhere that in his time the fame of Rome had not reached the mountains of the Caucasus, though the Republic was already well grown and\n\n49:1 -- A mathe matician, astronomer, and geographer of Alexandria. Fl. 140-160 A.D. Boethius translated one of his works. Page 50\n\nstriking awe among the Parthians and other nations in those parts? Do you see then how narrow and clos ely bounded must be that fame which you wish to extend more widely? Can the fame of a Roman ever reach parts to which the name of Rome cannot come?\n\nFurther, the manners and customs of different races are so little in agreement , that what is make his name known, because he takes pleasure in a glorious fame. So each man shall be content if his fame travels throughout his own countrymen, and the immortality of his name shall be bounded by the limits of one nation. But how ma ny men, the most famous of their times, are wiped out by oblivion because no man has written of them! 1 And yet what advantage is there in much that is written? For with their authors these writings are overwhelmed in the length and dimness of age. Yet when you think upon your fame in future ages, you seem to think that you are prolonging it to immortality. But if you think upon the unending length of eternity, what enjoyment do you find in the long endurance of Boethius is thinking of Horace, Od es iv. 9. Ere Agamemnon saw the light, There lived brave men: but tearless all Enfolded in eternal night, For lack of sacred minstrels, fall. (Mr.. Gladstone's translation.)\n\nPage 51\n\nyour name? For though one moment be ars but the least proportion to ten thousand years, yet there is a definite ratio, because both are limited spaces of time. But even ten thousand years, or the greatest number you will, cannot even be compared with eternity. For there will always be r atio between finite things, but between the finite and the infinite there can never be any comparison. Wherefore, however long drawn out may be the life of your fame, it is not even small, but it is absolutely nothing when compared with eternity. You k now not how to act rightly except for the breezes of popular opinion and for the sake of empty rumours; thus the excellence of conscience and of virtue is left behind, and you seek rewards from the tattle of other men. Listen to the witty manner in wh ich one played once upon the shallowness of this pride. A certain man once bitterly attacked another who had taken to himself falsely the name of philosopher, not for the purpose of true virtue, but for pride of fame; he added to his attack that he wou ld know soon whether he was a philosopher, when he saw whether the other bore with meekness and patience the insults he heaped upon him. The other showed patience for a while and took the insults as though he scoffed at them, until he said, \" Do you n ow see that I am a philosopher? \" \" I should have, had you kept silence,\" said the other stingingly. But we are speaking of great men: and I ask, what do they gain from fame, though they seek Page 52\n\nglory by virtue? what have they after the body is dissolved at death? For if men die utterly, as our reason forbids us to believe, there is no glory left to them at all, since they whose it is said to be, do not exist. If, on the other hand, the mind is still conscious and working when it is freed from its earthly prison, it seeks heaven in its freedom and surely spurns all earthly traffic: it enjoys heaven and rejoices in its release from the of this world.\n\n'The mind that rushes headlong in its search for fame, thinking that is its highest good, should look upon the spreading regions of the air, and then upon the bounded tracts that are this world: then will shame enter it; that, though fame grow, yet can it never fill so small a circle. Proud men! why will ye try in vain to free your necks from the yoke mortality has set thereon? Though fame may be wide scattered and find its way through distant lands, and set the tongues there talking; though a splendid house may draw brilliance fr om famous names and tales; yet death regards not any glory, howsoever great. Alike he overwhelms the lowly and the lofty head, and levels high with low.\n\n'Where are Fabricius's1 bones, that h onourable man? What now is Brutus?2 or 52:1 -- Fabrici:s -- was the Roman general whom Pyrrhus could neither bribe nor intimidate, B.C. 280.\n\n52:2 -- L. Juni us Brutus, who led the Romans to expel the last of the kings, and was elected the first consul, B.C. 509. Page 53\n\nunbending Cato?1 Their fame survives in this: it has no more than a few slight letters shewing forth an empty name. We see their noble names engraved, and only know thereby that they are brought to naught. Ye lie then all unknown, and fame can give no knowledge of you. But if you think that life can be prolonged by t he breath of mortal fame, yet when the slow time robs you of this too, then there awaits you but a second death.\n\n'But,' she said,' do not think that I would urge implacable war upon Fortune. There are times when her decept ion of men has certain merits: I mean when she discovers herself, unveils her face, and proclaims her ways. Perhaps you do not yet understand what I would say. It is a strange thing that I am trying to say, and for that reason I can scarcely explain myself in words. I think that ill fortune is of greater advantage to men than good fortune. Good fortune is ever lying when she seems to favour by an appearance of happiness. Ill fortune is ever true when by her changes she shews herself inconstant. T he one deceives; the other edifies. The one by a deceitful appearance of good things enchains the\n\n53:1 -- Probably Cato Major, the great censor, B.C. 184, the rigid champion of the stern old Roman morals; or possibly Ca to Minor, who committed suicide at Utica after the battle of Thapsus, B.C. 46, because he considered that Cæsar's victory was fatal to the Republic and the liberty of Rome.\n\nPage 54\n\nminds of those who enjoy them: the other frees them by a knowledge that happiness is so fragile. You see, then, that the one is blown about by winds, is ever moving and ever ignorant of its own self ; the other is sober, ever prepared and ever made provident by the undergoing of i ts very adversities. Lastly, good fortune draws men from the straight path of true good by her fawning: ill fortune draws most men to the true good, and holds them back by her curved staff.\n\n'And do you think that this should be reckoned among the least benefits of this rough, unkind, and terrible ill fortune, that she has discovered to you the minds of your faithful friends? Fortune has distinguished for you your sure and your doubtful friends; her departure has taken away her friends and left you yours. At what price could you have bought this benefit if you had been untouched and, as you thought, fortunate? Cease then to seek the wealth you have lost. You have found your friends, and they are the most precious of all riches.\n\n'Through Love1 the universe with constancy makes changes all without discord: earth's elements, though contrary, abide in treaty bound: Phoebus in his golden car leads up the glowin g day; his sister rules the night that\n\n54:1 -- Boethius in this passage is probably thinking of Empedocles's doctrine of Love which unites, and Strife which divides, the two primal forces in the universe.\n\n< tt>Page 55\n\nHesperus brought: the greedy sea confines its waves in bounds, lest the earth's borders be changed by its beating on them: all these are firmly bound by Love, which rules both earth and sea, and has it s empire in the heavens too. If Love should slacken this its hold, all mutual love would change to war; and these would strive to undo the scheme which now their glorious movements carry out with trust and with accord. By Love are peoples too kept bou nd together by a treaty which they may not break. Love binds with pure affection the sacred tie of wedlock, and speaks its bidding to all trusty friends. O happy race of mortals, if your hearts are ruled as is the universe, by Love!1'\n\n55:1 -- C p. Bk. I. Prose iv, p. 10. Page 56\n\nBook 3\n\nBOOK III\n\nWhen she finished her lay, its soothing tones left me spellbound with my ears alert in my eagerness to listen. So a while afterwards I said, 'Greatest comforter of weary minds, how have you cheered me with your deep thoughts and sweet singing too! No more shall I doubt my power to meet the blows of Fortune. So far am I from terror at the remedies which you did lately tell me were sharper, that I am longing to hear them, and eagerly I beg you for them.'\n\nThen said she,'I knew it when you laid hold upon my words in silent attention, and I was waiting for that frame of mind in you, or more truly, I brought it about in you. They that remain are indeed bitter to the tongue, but sweet to the inner man. But as you say you are eager to hear, how ardently you would be burning, if you knew whither I am attempting to lead you! '\n\nWhither is that? ' I asked.\n\n'To the true happiness, of which your soul too dreams; but your sight is taken up in imaginary views thereof, so that you cannot look upon itself.'\n\nPage 57\n\nThen said I,' I pray you shew me what that truly is, and quickly.'\n\n'I will do so,' she said,' fo r your sake willingly. But first I will try to picture in words and give you the form of the cause, which is already better known to you, that so, when that picture is perfect and you turn your eyes to the other side, you may recognise the form of tru e happiness.\n\n'When a man would sow in virgin soil, first he clears away the bushes, cuts the brambles and the ferns, that the corn-goddess may go forth laden with her new fruit. The honey, that the bee has toiled to give us, is sweeter when the mouth has tasted bitter things. The stars shine with more pleasing grace when a storm has ceased to roar and pour down rain. After the morning star has dispersed the shades of night, the day in all its beauty drives its rosy chario t forth. So thou hast looked upon false happiness first; now draw thy neck from under her yoke: so shall true happiness now come into thy soul.'\n\nShe lowered her eyes for a little while as though searching the innermost rece sses of her mind; and then she continued: -- ' The trouble of the many and various aims of mortal men bring them much care, and herein they go forward by different paths but strive to reach one end, which is happiness. And that good is that, to which i f any man attain, he\n\nPage 58\n\ncan desire nothing further. It is that highest of all good things, and it embraces in itself all good things: if any good is lacking, it cannot be the highest good, since then there is left outside it something which can be desired. Wherefore happiness is a state which is made perfect by the union of all good things. This end all men seek to reach, as I said, though by different paths. For there is implanted by nature in the minds of men a desire for the true good; but error leads them astray towards false goods by wrong paths.\n\n'Some men believe that the highest good is to lack nothing, and so they are at pains to possess abundant riches. Others consider th e true good to be that which is most worthy of admiration, and so they strive to attain to places of honour, and to be held by their fellow- citizens in honour thereby. Some determine that the highest good lies in the highest power;and so they either d esire to reign themselves, or try to cleave to those who do reign. Others think that renown is the greatest good, and they therefore hasten to make a famous name by the arts of peace or of war. But more than all measure the fruit of good by pleasure a nd enjoyment, and these think that the happiest man is abandoned to pleasure.\n\n'Further, there are those who confuse the aims and the causes of these good things: as those who desire riches for the sake of power or of pleasure , or those who seek power for the sake of money or celebrity. In these, then, and\n\nPage 59\n\nother things like to them, lies the aim of men's actions and prayers, such as renown and popularity, which seem to afford some fame, or wife and children, which are sought for the pleasure they give. On the other hand, the good of friends, which is the most honourable and holy of all, lies not in Fortune's but in Virtue's realm. All others are adopted for the sake of power or enjoy ment.\n\n'Again, it is plain that the good things of the body must be accounted to those false causes which we have mentioned; for bodily strength and stature seem to make men more able and strong; beauty and swiftness seem to gi ve renown; health seems to give pleasure. By all these happiness alone is plainly desired. For each man holds that to be the highest good, which he seeks before all others. But we have defined the highest good to be happiness. Wherefore what each man desires above all others, he holds to be a state of happiness.\n\n'Wherefore you have each of these placed before you as the form of human happiness: wealth, honours, power, glory, and pleasure. Epicurus1 considered these forms alone, and accordingly determined upon pleasure as the highest good, because all the others seemed but\n\n59:1 -- Epicurus (B.C. 342-270) was the famous founder of the Epicurean school of p hilosophy. His school had a large following of Romans under the Empire. His own teaching was of a higher nature than might be supposed from this bare statement that he thought 'pleasure was the highest good.'\n\nPage 60\n\nto join with it in bringing enjoyment to the mind.\n\n'But to return to the aims of men: their minds seem to seek to regain the highest good, and their memories seem to dull their powers. It is as though a drunken man were seek ing his home, but could not remember the way thither. Can those people be altogether wrong whose aim it is to lack nothing? No, there is nothing which can make happiness so perfect as an abundant possession of good things, needing naught that belongs to others, but in all ways sufficing for itself. Surely those others too are not mistaken who think that what is best is also most worthy of reverence and respect. It cannot be any cheap or base thing, to attain which almost all men aim and strive. And is power not to be accounted a good thing? Surely it is: can that be a weak thing or forceless, which is allowed in all cases to excel? Is renown of no value ? We cannot surrender this; that whatever is most excellent, has also great renown. It is ha rdly worth saying that happiness has no torturing cares or gloom, and is not subject to grief and trouble; for even in small things, the aim is to find that which it is a delight to have and to enjoy. These, then, are the desires of men: they long for riches, places of honour, kingdoms, glory, and pleasure;and they long for them because they think that thereby they will find satisfaction, veneration, power, renown, and happiness. It is the good then which men seek by their different desires;\n\nPage 61\n\nand it is easy to shew how great a force nature has put therein, since in spite of such varying and discordant opinions, they are all agreed in the goal they seek, that of the highest good.\n\n'I would to pliant strings set forth a song of how almighty Nature turns her guiding reins, telling with what laws her providence keeps safe this boundless universe, binding and tying each and all with cords that never shall be loosed. The lions of Carthage, though they bear the gorgeous bonds and trappings of captivity, and eat the food that is given them by hand, and though they fear their harsh master with his lash they know so well; yet if once blood has touched their b ristling jaws, their old, their latent wills return; with deep roaring they remember their old selves; they loose their bands and free their necks, and their tamer is the first torn by their cruel teeth, and his blood is poured out by their rage and wrath.\n\n'If the bird who sings so lustily upon the high tree-top, be caught and caged, men may minister to him with dainty care, may give him cups of liquid honey and feed him with all gentleness on plenteous food; yet if he fl y to the roof of his cage and see the shady trees he loves, he spurns with his foot the food they have put before him; the woods are all his sorrow calls for, for the woods he sings with his sweet tones.\n\n'The bough which has b een downward thrust by force of strength to bend its top to\n\nPage 62\n\nearth, so soon as the pressing hand is gone, looks up again straight to the sky above.\n\n'Phoebus sinks into the western waves, but by his unknown track he turns his car once more to his rising in the east.\n\n'All things must find their own peculiar course again, and each rejoices in his own return. Not one can keep the order handed down to it, unless i n some way it unites its rising to its end, and so makes firm, immutable, its own encircling course.\n\n'And you too, creatures of the earth, do dream of your first state, though with a dim idea. With whatsoever thinking it may b e, you look to that goal of happiness, though never so obscure your thoughts: thither, to true happiness, your natural course does guide you, and from the same your various errors lead you. For I would have you consider whether men can reach the end they have resolved upon, namely happiness, by these ways by which they think to attain thereto. If money and places of honour and such-like do bring anything of that sort to a man who seems to lack no good thing, then let us acknowledge with them th at men do become happy by the possession of these things. But if they cannot perform their promises, and there is still lack of further good things, surely it is plain that a false appearance of happiness is there discovered. You, therefore, who had lately abundant riches, shall first answer me. With all that great wealth, was your mind never\n\nPage 63\n\nperturbed by torturing care arising from some sense of injustice? '\n\n'Yes,' I said; ' I cann ot remember that my mind was ever free from some such care.'\n\nWas it not because something was lacking, which you missed, or because something was present to you which you did not like to have? '\n\n'Yes ,' I answered.\n\n'You desired, then, the presence of the one, and the absence of the other? '\n\n'I acknowledge it.'\n\n'Then,' said she,'such a man lacks what he desires.'\n\n&n bsp; 'He does.'\n\n'But while a man lacks anything, can he possibly satisfy himself? '\n\n'No,' said I.\n\n'Then, while you were bountifully supplied with wealth, you felt that you did not satisfy yourself? '\n\n'I did indeed.'\n\n'Then,' said she,'wealth cannot prevent a man from lacking or make him satisfied. And this is what it apparently professed to do. And this point to o I feel is most important: money has in itself, by its own nature, nothing which can prevent its being carried off from those, who possess it, against their will.'\n\n'It has not,' I said.\n\n'No, you canno t deny that any stronger man may any day snatch it from them. For how come about the quarrels of the law-courts ? Is it not because people try to regain money that\n\nPage 64\n\nhas been by force or by fraud taken from them? ' ' Yes,' I answered.\n\n'Then,' said she,' a man will need to seek from the outside help to guard his own money.'\n\n'That cannot be denied,' I said.\n\n'And a man will not need that unless he possesses money which he can lose.'\n\n'Undoubtedly he will not.'\n\n'Then the argument turns round the other way,' she said.' The riches which were thought to make a man all-sufficient for himself , do really put him in need of other people's help. Then how can need be separated from wealth? Do the rich never feel hunger nor thirst? Do the limbs of moneyed men never feel the cold of winter? You will say, \" Yes, but the rich have the wherewithal to satisfy hunger and thirst, and drive away cold.\" But though riches may thus console wants, they cannot entirely take them away. For, though these ever crying wants, these continual requests, are satisfied, yet there must exist that which is to be satisfied. I need not say that nature is satisfied with little, greed is never satisfied. Wherefore, I ask you, if wealth cannot remove want, and even creates its own wants, what reason is there that you should think it affords satisfaction to a man?\n\n' Though the rich man with greed heap up from ever-flowing streams the wealth that cannot satisfy, though he deck himself with pearls from the Red Sea's shore, and plough\n\nPage 65\n\nhis fertile fi eld with oxen by the score, yet gnawing care will never in his lifetime leave him, and at his death his wealth will not go with him, but leave him faithlessly.'\n\n'But,' I urged,' places of honour make the man, to whom they fa ll, honoured and venerated.'\n\n'Ah! ' she answered,' have those offices their force in truth that they may instil virtues into the minds of those that hold them, and drive out vices therefrom? And yet we are too well accustome d to see them making wickedness conspicuous rather than avoiding it. Wherefore we are displeased to see such places often falling to the most wicked of men, so that Catullus called Nonius \"a diseased growth,\"1 though he sat in the highest chair of office. Do you see how great a disgrace high honours can add to evil men? Their unworthiness is less conspicuous if they are not made famous by honours. Could you yourself have been induced by any dangers to think of be ing a colleague with Decoratus, 2 when you saw that he had the mind of an unscrupulous buffoon, and a base informer? We cannot consider men worthy of veneration on account of their high places, when we hold them to b e unworthy of those\n\n65:1 -- Probably Boethius makes a mistake in his interpretation of Catullus (Carm. 52), as Nonius's surname was very likely ' Struma ' (which also means a wen); in which case Catullus cannot at most have intended more to be understood than a play upon the man's true name.\n\n65:2 -- Decoratus was a minion of Theodoric.\n\nPage 66\n\nhigh places. But if you see a man endowed with wisdo m, you cannot but consider him worthy of veneration, or at least of the wisdom with which he is endowed. For such a man has the worth peculiar to virtue, which it transmits directly to those in whom it is found. But since honours from the vulgar crowd cannot create merit, it is plain that they have not the peculiar beauty of this worth. And here is a particular point to be noticed: if men are the more worthless as they are despised by more people, high position makes them all the worse because it cannot make venerable those whom it shews to so many people to be contemptible. And this brings its penalty with it: wicked people bring a like quality into their positions, and stain them with their infection.\n\n'Now I would hav e you consider the matter thus, that you may recognise that true veneration cannot be won through these shadowy honours. If a man who had filled the office of consul many times in Rome, came by chance into a country of barbarians, would his high posi tion make him venerated by the barbarians? Yet if this were a natural quality in such dignities, they would never lose their effective function in any land, just as fire is never aught but hot in all countries. But since they do not receive this qualit y of veneration from any force peculiar to themselves, but only from a connexion in the untrustworthy opinions of men, they become as nothing as soon as they are among those who do not consider these dignities as such.\n\nPage 67\n\n'But that is only in the case of foreign peoples. Among the very peoples where they had their beginnings, do these dignities last for ever? Consider how great was the power in Rome of old of the office of Præfect: now i t is an empty name and a heavy burden upon the income of any man of Senator's rank.'The præfect then, who was commissioner of the corn-market, was held to be a great man. Now there is no office more despised. For, as I said before, that which has no intrinsic beauty, sometimes receives a certain glory, sometimes loses it, according to the opinion of those who are concerned with it. If then high offices cannot make men venerated, if furthermore they grow vile by the infection of bad men, if ch anges of time can end their glory, and, lastly, if they are held cheaply in the estimation of whole peoples, I ask you, so far from affording true beauty to men, what beauty have they in themselves which men can desire?\n\n'Thoug h Nero decked himself proudly with purple of Tyre and snow-white gems, none the less that man of rage and luxury lived ever hated of all. Yet would that evil man at times give his dishonoured offices to men who were revered. Who then could count men b lessed, who to such a villain owed their high estate?\n\n'Can kingdoms and intimacies with kings make people powerful? \" Certainly,\" some The may answer, \" in so far as their happiness is lasting.\" But antiquity and our times too are\n\nPage 68\n\nfull of examples of the contrary; examples of men whose happiness as kings has been exchanged for disaster. What wonderful power, which is found to be powerless even for its own preservation! But if this kingly power is really a source of happiness, surely then, if it fail in any way, it lessens the happiness it brings, and equally causes unhappiness. However widely human empires may extend, there must be still more nations left, over whom each king d oes not reign. And so, in whatever direction this power ceases to make happy, thereby comes in powerlessness, which makes men unhappy; thus therefore there must be a greater part of unhappiness in every king's estate. That tyrant 1 had learnt well the dangers of his lot, who likened the fear which goes with kingship to the terror inspired by a sword ever hanging overhead. What then is such a power, which cannot drive away the bite of cares, nor escape the stings of fear?\n\n' Yet these all would willingly live without fear, but they cannot, and yet they boast of their power. Think you a man is powerful when you see that he longs for that which he cannot bring to pass? Do you reckon a man powerful who walks abroad with digni ty and attended by servants? A man who strikes fear into his subjects, yet fears them more himself? Damocles, what it was to be a tyrant, by setting him in his own seat at a sumptuous banquet,'but hung a sword above him by a hair.\n\nPage 69\n\nA man who must be at the mercy of those that serve him, in order that he may seem to have power?\n\n'Need I speak of intimacies with kings when kingship itself is shewn to be full of weakness? Not only when ki ngs' powers fall are their friends laid low, but often even when their powers are intact. Nero compelled his friend and tutor, Seneca,l to choose how he would die. Papinianus,2 for a long whi le a powerful courtier, was handed over to the soldiers' swords by the Emperor Antoninus. Yet each of these was willing to surrender all his power. Seneca even tried to give up all his wealth to Nero, and to seek retirement. But the very weight of thei r wealth and power dragged them down to ruin, and neither could do what he wished.\n\n'What then is that power, whose possessors fear it? in desiring to possess which, you are not safe, and from which you cannot escape, even tho ugh you try to lay it down? What help are friends, made not by virtue but by fortune? The friend gained by good fortune becomes an enemy in ill-fortune. And what plague can more effectually injure than an intimate enemy?\n\n'Th e man who would true power gain, must needs subdue his own wild thoughts: never\n\n69:1 -- Seneca, the philosopher and wise counsellor of Nero, was by him compelled to commit suicide, A.D. 65.\n\n69:2 -- Papinianus, the greatest lawyer of his time, was put to death by the Emperor Antoninus Caracalla, A.D. 212.\n\nPage 70\n\nmust he let his passions triumph and yoke his neck by their fou l bonds. For though the earth, as far as India's shore, tremble before the laws you give, though Thule bow to your service on earth's farthest bounds, yet if thou canst not drive away black cares, if thou canst not put to flight complaints, then is no true power thine.\n\n'How deceitful is fame often, and how base a thing it is! Justly did the tragic poet cry out,1 \"O Fame, Fame, how many lives of men Of naught hast thou puffed up! \" For m any men have got a great name from the false opinions of the crowd.-And what could be baser than such a thing? For those who are falsely praised, must blush to hear their praises. And if they are justly won by merits, what can they add to the pleasure of a wise man's conscience? For he measures his happiness not by popular talk, but by the truth of his conscience. If it attracts a man to make his name widely known, he must equally think it a shame if it be not made known. But I have already said th at there must be yet more lands into which the renown of a single man can never come; wherefore it follows that the man, whom you think famous, will seem to have no such fame in the next quarter of the earth.\n\n'Popular favour s eems to me to be unworthy even of mention under this head, for it comes not by any judgment, and is never constant.\n\n70:1 -- Euriped, Andromache,.319-320.\n\nPage 71\n\n& nbsp; 'Again, who can but see how empty a name, and how futile, is noble birth? For if its glory is due to renown, it belongs not to the man. For the glory of noble birth seems to be praise for the merits of a man's forefathers. But if praise cre ates the renown, it is the renowned who are praised. Wherefore, if you have no renown of your own, that of others cannot glorify you. But if there is any good in noble birth, I conceive it to be this, and this alone, that the highborn seem to be bound in honour not to show any degeneracy from their fathers' virtue.\n\n'From like beginning rise all men on earth, for there is one Father of all things; one is the guide of everything.'Tis He who gave the sun his rays, and horn s unto the moon.'Tis He who set mankind on earth, and in the heavens the stars. He put within our bodies spirits which were born in heaven. And thus a highborn race has He set forth in man. Why do ye men rail on your forefathers? If ye look to your be ginning and your author, which is God, is any man degenerate or base but he who by his own vices cherishes base things and leaves that beginning which was his?\n\n'And now what am I to say of the pleasures of the body? The desi res of the flesh are full of cares, their fulfilment is full of remorse. What terrible diseases, what unbearable griefs,\n\nPage 72\n\ntruly the fruits of sin, do they bring upon the bodies of those who enjoy them! I know not wha t pleasure their impulse affords, but any who cares to recall his indulgences of his passions, will know that the results of such pleasures are indeed gloomy. If any can shew that those results are blest with happiness, then may the beasts of the field be justly called blessed, for all their aims are urged toward the satisfying of their bodies' wants. The pleasures of wife and children may be most honourable; but nature makes it all too plain that some have found torment in their children. How bitt er is any such kind of suffering, I need not tell you now, for you have never known it, nor have any such anxiety now. Yet in this matter I would hold with my philosopher Euripides,l that he who has no children is happy in his misfortune.\n\n'All pleasures have this way: those who enjoy them they drive on with stings. Pleasure, like the winged bee, scatters its honey sweet, then flies away, and with a clinging sting it strikes the hearts it touches.\n\n'There is then no doubt that these roads to happiness are no roads, and they cannot lead any man to any end whither they profess to take him. I would shew you shortly with\n\n72:1 -- Referring to lines in the Andromache (419-420), where Euripides says: 'The man who complains that he has no children suffers less than he who has them, and is blest in his misfortune.'\n\nPage 73\n\nwhat great evils they are bound up. Would you heap up money? You will need to tear it from its owner. Would you seem brilliant by the glory of great honours? You must kneel before their dispenser, and in your desire to surpass other men in honour, you must debase yourself by setting asid e all pride. Do you long for power? You will be subject to the wiles of all over whom you have power, you will be at the mercy of many dangers. You seek fame? You will be drawn to and fro among rough paths, and lose all freedom from care. Would you sp end a life of pleasure? Who would not despise and cast off such servitude to so vile and brittle a thing as your body? How petty are all the aims of those who put before themselves the pleasures of the body, how uncertain is the possession of such? In bodily size will you ever surpass the elephant? In strength will you ever lead the bull, or in speed the tiger? Look upon the expanse of heaven, the strength with which it stands, the rapidity with which it moves, and cease for a while to wonder at ba se things. This heaven is not more wonderful for those things than for the design which guides it. How sweeping is the brightness of outward form, how swift its movement, yet more fleeting than the passing of the flowers of spring. But if, as Aristotl e says, many could use the eyes of lynxes to see through that which meets the eye, then if they saw into the organs within, would not that body, Page 74\n\nthough it had the most fair outside of Alcibiades,1 seem most vile within? Wherefore it is not your own nature, but the weakness of the eyes of them that see you, which makes you seem beautiful. But consider how in excess you desire the pleasures of the body, when you know that hows oever you admire it, it can be reduced to nothing by a three-days' fever. To put all these points then in a word: these things cannot grant the good which they promise; they are not made perfect by the union of all good things in them; they do not le ad to happiness as a path thither; they do not make men blessed.2\n\n'Ah! how wretched are they whom ignorance leads astray by her crooked path! Ye seek not gold upon green trees, nor gather precious stones from vines, nor set your nets on mountain tops to catch the fishes for your feast, nor hunt the Umbrian sea in search of goats. Man knows the depths of the sea themselves, hidden though they be beneath its waves; he knows which wate r best yields him pearls, and which the scarlet dye. But in their blindness men are content, and know not where lies hid the good which they desire. They sink in earthly things, and there they seek that which has soared\n\n74:1 -- Alcibiad:s was the most handsome and brilliantly fascinating of all the public men of Athens in her most brilliant period.\n\n74:2 -- Compare Philosophy's first words about the highest good, p. 58.\n\nPage 75\n\nabove the star-lit heavens. What can I call down upon them worthy of their stubborn folly? They go about in search of wealth and honours; and only when they have by labours vast stored up deception for themselves, do they at last know what is their true good.\n\n'So far,' she continued,' we have been content to set forth the form of false happiness. If you clearly understand that, my next duty is to shew what is true happiness.'\n\n& nbsp; 'I do see,' said I,'that wealth cannot satisfy, that power comes not to kingdoms, nor veneration to high offices; that true renown cannot accompany ambition, nor true enjoyment wait upon the pleasures of the body.'\n\n&nbsp ; 'Have you grasped the reasons why it is so? ' she asked.\n\n'I seem to look at them as through a narrow chink, but I would learn more clearly from you.'\n\n'The reason is to hand,' said she; 'human error takes that which is simple and by nature impossible to divide, tries to divide it, and turns its truth and perfection into falsity and imperfection. Tell me, do you think that anything which lacks nothing, can be without power? '\n\n'Of course not.'\n\n'You are right; for if anything has any weakness in any part, it must lack the help of something else.'\n\n'That is so,' I said.\n\nPage 76\n\n&n bsp; 'Then perfect satisfaction and power have the same nature? '\n\n'Yes, it seems so.'\n\n'And do you think such a thing contemptible, or the opposite, worthy of all veneration? '\n\n'There can be no doubt that it is worthy.'\n\n'Then let us add veneration to that satisfaction and power, and so consider these three as one.'\n\n'Yes, we must add it if we wish to proclaim the truth.'\n\n'Do you then think that this whole is dull and of no reputation, or renowned with all glory? For consider it thus: we have granted that it lacks nothing, that it has all power and is worthy of all veneration; it must not therefore lack the glory which it cannot supply for itself, and thereby seem to be in any direction contemptible.'\n\n'No,' I said,'I must allow that it has glory too.'\n\n'Therefore we must rank this glory equally with the other three.'\n\n'Yes, we must.'\n\n'Then that which lacks nothing from outside itself, which is all-powerful by its own might, which has renown and veneration, must surely be allowe d to be most happy too?'\n\n'I cannot imagine from what quarter unhappiness would creep into such a thing, wherefore we must grant that it is full of happiness if the other qualities remain existent.'\n\n'T hen it follows further, that though perfect\n\nPage 77\n\nsatisfaction, power, glory, veneration, and happiness differ in name, they cannot differ at all in essence?'\n\n'They cannot.'\n\n'This then,' said she,'is a simple, single thing by nature, only divided by the mistakes of base humanity; and while men try to gain a part of that which has no parts, they fail both to obtain a fraction, which cannot exist, and the whole too a fter which they do not strive.'\n\n'Tell me how they fail thus,' I said.\n\n'One seeks riches by fleeing from poverty, and takes no thought of power,' she answered, 'and so he prefers to be base and unknown, and even deprives himself of natural pleasures lest he should part with the riches which he has gathered. Thus not even that satisfaction reaches the man who loses all power, who is stabbed by sorrow, lowered by his meanness, hidden by his lack of fame. Another seeks power only: he scatters his wealth, he despises pleasures and honours which have no power, and sets no value upon glory. You see how many things such an one lacks. Sometimes he goes without necessaries even, sometimes he feels th e bite and torture of care; and as he cannot rid himself of these, he loses the power too which he sought above all things. The same argument may be applied to offices, glory, and pleasure. For since each one of these is the same as each other, any m an who seeks one without the others, gains not even that one which he desires.'\n\nPage 78\n\n'What then? ' I asked.\n\n'If any man desires to obtain all together, he will be seeki ng the sum of happiness. But will he ever find that in these things which we have shewn cannot supply what they promise?' 'No.\n\n'Then happiness is not to be sought for among these things which are separately believed to suppl y each thing so sought.'\n\n'Nothing could be more plainly true,' I said.\n\n'Then you have before you the form of false happiness, and its causes; now turn your attention in the opposite direction, and you will quickly see the true happiness which I have promised to shew you.'\n\n'But surely this is clear even to the blindest, and you shewed it before when you were trying to make clear the causes of false happiness. For if I mist ake not, true and perfect happiness is that which makes a man truly satisfied, powerful, venerated, renowned, and happy. And (for I would have you see that I have looked deeply into the matter) I realise without doubt that that which can truly yield any one of these, since they are all one, is perfect happiness.\n\n'Ah! my son,' said she,' I do see that you are blessed in this opinion, but I would have you add one thing.'\n\n'What is that? ' I asked.\n\n'Do you think that there is anything among mortals, and in our perishable lives, which could yield such a state? '\n\nPage 79\n\n'I do not think that there is, and I think th at you have shewn this beyond the need of further proof.'\n\n'These then seem to yield to mortals certain appearances of the true good, or some such imperfections; but they cannot give true and perfect good.'\n\n&nbsp ; 'No.'\n\n'Since, then, you have seen what is true happiness, and what are the false imitations thereof, it now remains that you should learn whence this true happiness may be sought.'\n\n'For that,' said I,' I have been impatiently waiting.'\n\n'But divine help must be sought in small things as well as great (as my pupil Plato says in his Timoe;us);1 so what, think you, must we d o to deserve to find the place of that highest good? '\n\n'Call,' I said,' upon the Father of all, for if we do not do so, no undertaking would be rightly or duly begun.'\n\n'You are right,' said she; and t hus she cried aloud: -- 2\n\n'Thou who dost rule the universe with\n\n79:1 -- Plato, Timoe;us, 27 C. (ch. v.) -- ' All those who have even the least share of moderatio n, on undertaking any enterprise, small or great, always call upon God at the beginning.\n\n79:2 -- This hymn is replete with the highest development of Plato's theory of ideas, as expressed in the Timoe;us, and his theory of the ideal good being the moving spirit of the material world. Compare also the speculative portion of Virgil, Æneid, vi.\n\nPage 80\n\neverlasting law, founder of earth and heaven alike, who hast bidden time stand forth from out Eternity, for ever firm Thyself, yet giving movement unto all. No causes were without Thee which could thence impel Thee to create this mass of changing matter, but within Thyself exists the very idea of perfect good, which grudges naught, for of what can it have envy? Thou makest all things follow that high pattern. In perfect beauty Thou movest in Thy mind a world of beauty, making all in a like image, and bidding the perfect whole to complete its perfect functions. All the first principles of nature Thou dost bind together by perfect orders as of numbers, so that they may be balanced each with its opposite: cold with heat, and dry with moist together; thus fire may not fly upward too swiftly because too purely, nor may the weight of the solid earth drag it down and overwhelm it. Thou dost make the soul as a third between mind and material bodies: to these the soul gives life and movement, for Thou dost spread it abroad among the members of the universe, now working in accord. Thus is the soul divided as it takes its course, making two circles, as though a binding thread around the world. Thereafter it returns unto itself and passes around the lower earthly mind; and in like manner it giv es motion to the heavens to turn their course. Thou it is who dost carry forward with like inspiration these souls and lower lives. Thou dost fill these weak vessels Page 81\n\nwith lofty souls, and send them abroad throughou t the heavens and earth, and by Thy kindly law dost turn them again to Thyself and bring them to seek, as fire doth, to rise to Thee again.\n\n'Grant then, O Father, that this mind of ours may rise to Thy throne of majesty; gra nt us to reach that fount of good. Grant that we may so find light that we may set on Thee unblinded eyes; cast Thou therefrom the heavy clouds of this material world. Shine forth upon us in Thine own true glory. Thou art the bright and peaceful res t of all Thy children that worship Thee. To see Thee clearly is the limit of our aim. Thou art our beginning, our progress, our guide, our way, our end.\n\n'Since then you have seen the form both of the imperfect and the perf ect good, I think I should now shew you where lies this perfection of happiness. In this I think our first inquiry must be whether any good of this kind can exist in the very nature of a subject; for we must not let any vain form of thought make us miss the truth of this matter. But there can be no denial of its existence, that it is as the very source of all good. For if anything is said to be imperfect, it is held to be so by some loss of its perfection. Wherefore if in any kind of thing a pa rticular seems imperfect, there must also be a perfect specimen in the same kind. For if you take away the perfection,\n\nPage 82\n\nit is impossible even to imagine whence could come the so-called imperfect specimen. For nature do es not start from degenerate or imperfect specimens, but starting from the perfect and ideal, it degenerates to these lower and weaker forms. If then, as we have shewn above, there is an uncertain and imperfect happiness to be found in the good, then there must doubtless be also a sure and perfect happiness therein.'1\n\n'Yes,' said I,' that is quite surely proved to be true.'\n\n'Now consider,' she continued,' whe re it lies. The universally accepted notion of men proves that God, the fountain-head of all things, is good. For nothing can be thought of better than God, and surely He, than whom there is nothing better, must without doubt be good. Now reason she ws us that God is so good, that we are convinced that in Him lies also the perfect good. For if it is not so, He cannot be the fountain-head; for there must then be something more excellent, possessing that perfect good, which appears to be of older origin than God: for it has been proved that all perfections are of earlier origin than the imperfect specimens of the same: wherefore, unless we are to prolong the series to infinity, we must allow that the highest Deity must be full of the highest , the perfect good. But as we have laid down that true happiness is perfect\n\n82:1 -- This reasoning hangs upon Plato's theory of ideas and so is the opposite of the theory of evolution.\n\nPage 83\n\ngood, it must be that true happiness is situated in His Divinity.'\n\n'Yes, I accept that; it cannot be in any way contradicted.'\n\n'But,' she said,' I beg you, be sure that you accept with a sur e conscience and determination this fact, that we have said that the highest Deity is filled with the highest good.'\n\n'How should I think of it? ' I asked.\n\n'You must not think of God, the Father of all , whom we hold to be filled with the highest good, as having received this good into Himself from without, nor that He has it by nature in such a manner that you might consider Him, its possessor, and the happiness possessed, as having different esse ntial existences. For if you think that good has been received from without, that which gave it must be more excellent than that which received it; but we have most rightly stated that He is the most excellent of all things. And if you think that it is in Him by His nature, but different in kind, then, while we speak of God as the fountain-head of all things, who could imagine by whom these different kinds can have been united? Lastly, that which is different from anything cannot be the thing f rom which it differs. So anything which is by its nature different from the highest good, cannot be the highest good. And this we must not think of God, than whom there is nothing more excellent, as we have agreed. Nothing in this world can have a n ature which is better than\n\nPage 84\n\nits origin, wherefore I would conclude that that which is the origin of all things, according to the truest reasoning, is by its essence the highest good.'\n\n'Most tr uly,' I said.\n\n'You agree that the highest good is happiness? '\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Then you must allow that God is absolute happiness?\n\n'I cannot deny what you put forward before, and I see that this follows necessarily from those propositions.'\n\n'Look then,' she said,'whether it is proved more strongly by this too: there cannot be two highest goods which are different. For where two g ood things are different, the one cannot be the other; wherefore neither can be the perfect good, while each is lacking to the other. And that which is not perfect cannot be the highest, plainly. Therefore if two things are highest good, they cannot be different. Further, we have proved to ourselves that both happiness and God are each the highest good. Therefore the highest Deity must be identical with the highest happiness.'\n\n'No conclusion,' I said,' could be truer in fact, or more surely proved by reason, or more worthy of our God.'\n\n'Besides this let me give you corollary, as geometricians do, when they wish to add a point drawn from the propositions they have proved. Since men become ha ppy by\n\nPage 85\n\nacquiring happiness, and happiness is identical with divinity, it is plain that they become happy by acquiring divinity. But just as men become just by acquiring the quality of justice, and wise by wisdo m, so by the same reasoning, by acquiring divinity they become divine. Every happy man then is divine. But while nothing prevents as many men as possible from being divine, God is so by His nature, men become so by participation.'\n\n&nbsp ; 'This corollary,' I said,' or whatever you call it, is indeed beautiful and very precious.'\n\n'Yes, but nothing can be more beautiful than this too which reason would have us add to what we have agreed upon.'\n\n&nbs p; 'What is that? ' I asked.\n\n'Happiness seems to include many things: do all these join it together as into a whole which is happiness, as though each thing were a different part thereof, or is any one of them a go od which fulfils the essence of happiness, and do the others merely bear relations to this one .? '\n\n'I would have you make this plain by the enunciation of these particulars.'\n\n'Do we not,' she asked,' hold that happiness is a good thing? '\n\n'Yes,' I answered,' the highest good.'\n\n'But you may apply this quality of happiness to them all. For the perfect satisfaction is the same, and the highest power , and veneration, and renown, and pleasure; these are all held to be happiness.\n\nPage 86\n\n'What then? ' I asked.\n\n'Are all these things, satisfaction, power, and the others, as it were, members of the body, happiness, or do they all bear their relation to the good, as members to a head? '\n\n'I understand what you propose to examine, but I am waiting eagerly to hear what you will lay down.'\n\n&n bsp; 'I would have you take the following explanation,' she said.' If these were all members of the one body, happiness, they would differ individually. For this is the nature of particulars, to make up one body of different parts. But all these have been shewn to be one and the same. Therefore they are not as members; and further, this happiness will then appear to be joined together into a whole body out of one member, which is impossible.'\n\n'That is quite ce rtain,' said I,' but I would hear what is to come.'\n\n'It is plain that the others have some relation to the good. It is for that reason, namely because it is held to be good, that this satisfaction is sought, and power likewis e, and the others too; we may suppose the same of veneration, renown, and pleasure. The good then is the cause of the desire for all of these, and their consummation also. Such a thing as has in itself no real or even pretended good, cannot ever be sought. On the other hand, such things as are not by nature good, but seem to be so, are sought as though they were truly good. Wherefore we may justly believe that\n\nPage 87\n\ntheir good quality is the cause of the desire f or them, the very hinge on which they turn, and their consummation. The really important object of a desire, is that for the sake of which anything is sought, as a means. For instance, if a man wishes to ride for the sake of his health, he does not so much desire the motion of riding, as the effect, namely health. As, therefore, each of these things is desired for the sake of the good, the absolute good is the aim, rather than themselves. But we have agreed that the other things are desired for the sake of happiness, wherefore in this case too, it is happiness alone which is the object of the desire. Wherefore it is plain that the essence of the good and of happiness is one and the same.'\n\n'I cannot see how any one can think otherwise.'\n\n'But we have shewn that God and true happiness are one and the same.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Therefore,' said she,'we may safely conclude that the essence of God also lies in the absolute good and nowhere else.\n\n'Come hither all who are the prey of passions, bound by their ruthless chains; those deceiving passions which blunt the minds of men. Here shall you find rest from your labours; here a haven lying in tranquil peace; this shall be a resting-place open to receive within itself all the miserable on earth. Not\n\nPage 88\n\nall the wealth of Tagus's golden sands, nor Hermus's gleaming strand,1 nor Indus, nigh earth's hottest zone, mingling its emeralds and pearls, can bring light to the eyes of any soul, but rather plunge the soul more blindly in their shade. In her deepest caverns does earth rear all that pleases the eye and excites the mind. The glory by which the heavens move and have their being, has nought to do with the darknesses which bring ruin to the soul. Whosoever can look on this true light will scarce allow the sun's rays to be clear.'\n\n&nb sp; 'I cannot but agree with that,' I said,' for it all stands woven together by the strongest proofs.' Then she said,'At what would you value this, namely if you could find out what is the absolute good? '\n\n'I wou ld reckon it,' I said,'at an infinite value, if I could find out God too, who is the good.'\n\n'And that too I will make plain by most true reasoning, if you will allow to stand the conclusions we have just now arrived at.'\n\n'They shall stand good.'\n\n'Have I not shewn,' she asked,' that those upon the things which most men seek are for this reason not perfect goods, because they differ between the highest themselves; they are lacking to one another, and so cannot afford full, absolute good? But\n\n88:1 -- The modern Sarabat, in Asia Minor, formerly auriferous.\n\nPage 89\n\nwhen they are gathered together, as it were , into one form and one operation, so that complete satisfaction, power, veneration, renown, and pleasure are all the same, then they become the true good. Unless they are all one and the same, they have no claim to be reckoned among the true object s of men's desires.'\n\n'That has been proved beyond all doubt.'\n\n'Then such things as differ among themselves are not goods, but they become so when they begin to be a single unity. Is it not then the ca se these become goods by the attainment of unity? '\n\n'Yes,' I said,' it seems so.'\n\n'But I think you allow that every good is good by participation in good? '\n\n'Yes, I do.'\n\n'Then by reason of this likeness both unity and good must be allowed to be the same thing; for such things as have by nature the same operation, have the same essence.'\n\n'Undeniably.'\n\n&n bsp;'Do you realise that everything remains existent so long as it keeps its unity, but perishes in dissolution as soon as it loses its unity? '\n\n'How so? ' I asked.\n\n'In the case of animals,' she said, ' so long as mind and body remain united, you have what you call an animal. But as soon as this unity is dissolved by the separation of the two, the animal perishes and can plainly be no longer called an animal. In the case of the body, too,\n\nPage 90\n\nso long as it remains in a single form by the union of its members, the human figure is presented. But if the division or separation of the body's parts drags that union asunder, it at once ceases to be what it was. In thi s way one may go through every subject, and it will be quite evident that each thing exists individually, so long as it is one, but perishes so soon as it ceases to be one.'\n\n'Yes, I see the same when I think of other cases.'\n\n'Is there anything,' she then asked,' which, in so far as it acts by nature, ever loses its desire for self-preservation, and would voluntarily seek to come to death and corruption? '\n\n'No,' I said; ' while I think of animals which have volition in their nature, I can find in them no desire to throw away their determination to remain as they are, or to hasten to perish of their own accord, so long as there are no external forces compelling them t hereto. Every animal labours for its preservation, shunning death and extinction. But about trees and plants, I have great doubts as to what I should agree to in their case, and in all inanimate objects.'\n\n'But in this case t oo,' she said,'you have no reason to be in doubt, when you see how trees and plants grow in places which suit them, and where, so far as nature is able to prevent it, they cannot quickly wither and perish. For some grow in plains, others on mountain s; some are nourished by marshes,\n\nPage 91\n\nothers cling to rocks; some are fertilised by otherwise barren sands, and would wither away if one tried to transplant them to better soil. Nature grants to each what suits it, and works against their perishing while they can possibly remain alive. I need hardly remind you that all plants seem to have their mouths buried in the earth, and so they suck up nourishment by their roots and diffuse their strength through their pith and bark: the pith being the softest part is always hidden away at the heart and covered, protected, as it were, by the strength of the wood; while outside, the bark, as being the defender who endures the best, is opposed to the unkindness of the we ather. Again, how great is nature's care, that they should all propagate themselves by the reproduction of their seed; they all, as is so well known, are like regular machines not merely for lasting a time, but for reproducing themselves for ever, a nd that by their own kinds. Things too which are supposed to be inanimate, surely do all seek after their own by a like process. For why is flame carried upward by its lightness, while solid things are carried down by their weight, unless it be that these positions and movements are suitable to each? Further, each thing preserves what is suitable to itself, and what is harmful, it destroys. Hard things, such as stones, cohere with the utmost tenacity of their parts, and resist easy dissolution; while liquids, water, and air, yield easily to division, but quickly slip back to mingle their parts Page 92\n\nwhich have been cut asunder. And fire cannot be cut at all.\n\n'We are not now discussing t he voluntary movements of a reasoning mind, but the natural instinct. For instance, we unwittingly digest the food we have eaten, and unconsciously breathe in sleep. Not even in animals does this love of self-preservation come from mental wishes, but from elementary nature. For often the will, under stress of external causes, embraces the idea of death, from which nature revolts in horror.1 And, on the other hand, the will sometimes restrains what nature alwa ys desires, namely the operation of begetting, by which alone the continuance of mortal things becomes enduring. Thus far, then, this love of self- preservation arises not from the reasoning animal s intention, but from natural instinct. Providence h as given to its creatures this the greatest cause of permanent existence, the instinctive desire to remain existent so far as possible. Wherefore you have no reason to doubt that all things, which exist, seek a permanent existence by nature, and simi larly avoid extinction.'\n\n'Yes,' I said,'I confess that I see now beyond all doubt what appeared to me just now uncertain.'\n\n'But,' she continued,'that which seeks to continue its existence, aims at un ity; for take\n\n92:1 -- Boethius is possibly thinking here of passages in Plato's Republic, Bk. iv. (439-441) where Socrates points out the frequent opposition of reason and instinct.\n\nPage 93\n\nthis away, and none will have any chance of continued existence.'\n\n'That is true.'\n\n'Then all things desire unity,' she said, and I agreed.\n\n'But we have shewn unity to be identical with the good? '\n\n'Yes,' said I.\n\n'Then all things desire the good; and that you may define as being the absolute good which is desired by all.'\n\n'Nothing could be more truthfully reasoned. For either everything is brought back to nothing, and all will flow on at random with no guiding head; or if there is any universal aim, it will be the sum of all good.'\n\n'Great is my rejoicing, m y son,' said she, 'for you have set firmly in your mind the mark of the central truth. And hereby is made plain to you that which you a short time ago said that you knew not.'\n\n'What was that? '\n\n'What was the final aim of all things,' she said,' for that is plainly what is desired by all: since we have agreed that that is the good, we must confess that the good is the end of all things.\n\n'If any man makes search for trut h with all his penetration, and would be led astray by no deceiving paths, let him turn upon himself the light of an inward gaze, let him bend by force the long-drawn wanderings of his thoughts into\n\nPage 94\n\none circle; l et him tell surely to his soul, that he has, thrust away within the treasures of his mind, all that he labours to acquire without. Then shall that truth, which now was hid in error's darkening cloud, shine forth more clear than Phoebus's self. For th e body, though it brings material mass which breeds forgetfulness, has never driven forth all light from the mind. The seed of truth does surely cling within, and can be roused as a spark by the fanning of philosophy. For if it is not so, how do ye men make answers true of your own instinct when teachers question you? Is it not that the quick spark of truth lies buried in the heart's low depths? And if the Muse of Plato sends through those depths the voice of truth, each man has not forgotten a nd is but reminding himself of what he learns.'1 When she made an end, I said,'I agree very strongly with Plato; for this is the second time that you have reminded me of these thoughts. The first time I had lost them through the material influence of the body; the second, when overwhelmed by this weight of trouble.'\n\n'If,' said she,' you look back upon what we that have agreed upon earlier, you will also soon recall what you just now said you knew not.'\n\n'What is that? ' I asked.\n\n94:1 -- Plato's doctrine of remembrance is chiefly treated of in his Phæ;do and Meno.\n\nPage 95\n\n'The guidance by which the universe is directed.'\n\n'Yes, I remember confessing my ignorance, and though I think I foresee the answer you will offer, I am eager to hear you explain it more fully.' < /p>\n\n'This world,' she said,' you thought a little while ago must without doubt be guided by God.'\n\n'And I think so now,' I said,'and will never think there is any doubt thereof; and I will shortly explain b y what reasoning I arrive at that point. This universe would never have been suitably put together into one form from such various and opposite parts, unless there were some One who joined such different parts together; and when joined, the very vari ety of their natures, so discordant among themselves, would break their harmony and tear them asunder unless the One held together what it wove into one whole. Such a fixed order of nature could not continue its course, could not develop motions tak ing such various directions in place, time, operation, space, and attributes, unless there were One who, being immutable, had the disposal of these various changes. And this cause of their remaining fixed and their moving, I call God, according to th e name familiar to all.'\n\nThen said she,' Since these are your feelings, I think there is but little trouble left me before you may revisit your home with happiness in your grasp. But let us look into the matter we\n\nPage 96\n\nhave set before ourselves. Have we not shewn that complete satisfaction exists in true happiness, and we have agreed that God is happiness itself, have we not? '\n\n'We have.'\n\n'Wherefore He needs no external aid in governing the universe, or, if He had any such need, He would not have this complete sufficiency.'\n\n'That of necessity follows,' I said.\n\n'Then He arranges all thi ngs by Himself.' Without doubt He does.'\n\n'And God has been shewn to be the absolute good.'\n\n'Yes, I remember.'\n\n'Then He arranges all things by good, if He arranges them by Him self, whom we have agreed to be the absolute good. And so this is the tiller and rudder by which the ship of the universe is kept sure and unbreakable.'\n\n'I feel that most strongly,' I said; 'and I foresaw that you would say s o before, though I had a slight uncertainty.'\n\n'I believe you,' she said,' for now you bring your eyes more watchfully to scan the truth. But what I am going to say is no less plain to the sight.'\n\n'Wh at is that; '\n\n'Since we may reasonably be sure that God steers all things by the helm of goodness, and, as I have shewn you, all things have a natural instinct to hasten towards the good, can there be any doubt that they are guided according to\n\nPage 97\n\ntheir own will: and that of their own accord they turn to the will of the supreme disposer, as though agreeing with, and obedient to, the helmsman? '\n\n'That is so,' I s aid,'and the government would not seem happy if it was a yoke upon discontented necks, and not the salvation of the submissive.'\n\n'Then nothing need oppose God's way for its own nature's preservation.'\n\n&nbs p;'No.'\n\n'But if it try to oppose Him, will it ever have any success at all against One whom we have justly allowed to be supremely powerful in matters of happiness? '\n\n'Certainly not.'\n\n&n bsp; 'Then there is nothing which could have the will or the power to resist the highest good? ' I think not.'\n\n'Then it is the highest good which is guiding with strength and disposing with gentleness? '\n\n& nbsp; Then said I,'How great pleasure these things give me! not only those which have been proved by the strongest arguments, but still more the words in which you prove them, which make me ashamed that my folly has bragged so loudly.'\n\n& nbsp; 'You have heard in mythology how the giants attacked heaven. It was this kindly strength which overthrew them too, as was their desert. But would you care to put these\n\nPage 98\n\narguments at variance? For pe rhaps from such a friction, some fair spark of truth may leap forth.'\n\n'As you hold best,' I said.\n\n'Nobody would care to doubt that God is all-powerful? '\n\n'At any rate, no san e man would doubt it.'\n\n'Being, then, all-powerful, nothing is beyond His power? '\n\n'Nothing.'\n\n'Can, then, God do evil? '\n\n'No.'\n\n&nbs p;'Then evil is nothing, since it is beyond His power, and nothing is beyond His power? '\n\n'Are you playing with me,' I asked,' weaving arguments as a labyrinth out of which I shall find no way? You may enter a labyrinth by th e way by which you may come forth: come now forth by the way you have gone in: or are you folding your reason in some wondrous circle of divine simplicity? A little while ago you started from happiness, and said that happiness was the highest good; a nd you shewed how that rested in the highest Deity. And you reasoned that God too was the highest good, and the fullest happiness; and you allowed, as though granting a slight gift, that none could be happy except such as were similarly divine. Agai n, you said that the essence of God and of happiness was identical with the very form of good; and that that alone was good which was sought by all nature. And you argued, too, that God guided this universe by the helm of\n\nPage 99\n\ngoodness; and that all creatures with free will obeyed this guidance, and that there was no such thing as natural evil; and all these things you developed by no help from without, but by homely and internal proofs, each gaining its credence from that which went before it.'\n\nThen she answered,' I was not mocking you. We have worked out the greatest of all matters by the grace of God, to whom we prayed. For the form of the divine essence is such that it is not dif fused without, nor receives aught into itself from without. But as Parmenides says of it, \" It is a mass well rounded upon all sides.\"1 But if you examine it with reasoning, sought for not externally but by lying w ithin the sphere of the very thing we are handling, you will not wonder at what you have learnt on Plato's authority,2 that our language must be akin to the subjects of which we speak.\n\n'H appy the man who could reach the crystal fount of good: happy he who could shake off\n\n99:1 -- This is a verse from the poems in which Parmenides embodied his philosophy: this was the doctrine of the unity which must have been in Boethius's mind above. Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic school (495 B.C.) was perhaps, considering his early date, the greatest and most original of Greek philosophers. Boethius probably did not make a clear distinction between the philo sopher's own poems and the views expressed in Plato's Parmenides.\n\n99:2 -- Plato in the Timoeus says,' The language must also be akin to the subjects of which its words are the interpreters' -- -(29 B.).\n\nPage 100\n\nthe chains of matter and of earth. The singer of Thrace in olden time lamented his dead wife: by his tearful strains he made the trees to follow him, and bound the flowing streams to stay: for him the hind would fea rlessly go side by side with fiercest lions, and the hare would look upon the hound, nor be afraid, for he was gentle under the song's sway. But when the hotter flame burnt up his inmost soul, even the strains, which had subdued all other things, co uld not soothe their own lord's mind. Complaining of the hard hearts of the gods above, he dared approach the realms below. There he tuned his songs to soothing tones, and sang the lays he had drawn from his mother's1< /a> fount of excellence. His unrestrained grief did give him power, his love redoubled his grief's power: his mourning moved the depths of hell. With gentlest prayers he prayed to the lords of the shades for grace. The three-headed porter2 was taken captive with amazement at his fresh songs. The avenging goddesses,3 who haunt with fear the guilty, poured out sad tears. Ixion's4 wheel no longer swi ftly turned.

At last the lord of the shades2 in pity cried: \"We are conquered; take your bride with you, bought by your song; but one condition binds our gift: till s he has left these dark abodes, turn not your eyes upon her.\" Who shall set a law to lovers? Love is a greater law unto itself. Alack! at the very bounds of darkness Orpheus looked upon his Eurydice; looked, and lost her, and was lost himself. < p> 'To you too this tale refers; you, who seek to lead your thoughts to the light above. For whosoever is overcome of desire, and turns his gaze upon the darkness 'neath the earth, he, while he looks on hell, loses the prize he carri ed off.'\n\n101:1 -- Tityos for his crimes was for ever fastened to the ground while a vulture devoured his entrails.\n\n101:2 -- Pluto. Page 102\n\nBook 4\n\nBOOK IV\n\nTHUS gently sang the Lady Philosophy with dignified mien and grave countenance; and when she ceased, I, who had not thoroughly forgotten the grief with in me, interrupted her as she was about to speak further.' Herald of true light,' I said,'right clear have been the outpourings of your speech till now, seeming inspired as one contemplates them, and invincible through your reasonings. And though th rough grief for the injustices I suffer, I had forgotten them, yet you have not spoken of They what I knew not at all before. But this one thing is the chief cause of my grief, namely that, when there exists a good governor of the world, evils should exist at all, or, existing, should go unpunished. I would have you think how strange is this fact alone. But there is an even stranger attached thereto: ill-doing reigns and flourishes, while virtue not only lacks its reward, but is even trampled un derfoot by wicked doers, and pays the penalties instead of crime. Who can wonder and complain enough that such things should happen under the rule of One who, while all-knowing and all-powerful, wills good alone? '\n\nThen she answered: ' Yes, it would be most terrible, monstrous, and infinitely amazing if\n\nPage 103\n\nit were as you think. It would be as though in a well-ordered house of a good master, the vilest vessels were cared for while the p recious were left defiled. But it is not so. If our former conclusions are unshaken, God Himself, of whose government we speak, will teach you that the good are always powerful, the evil are always the lowest and weakest; vice never goes unpunished; virtue never goes without its own reward; happiness comes to the good, misfortune to the wicked: and when your complaints are set at rest, many such things would most firmly strengthen you in this opinion. You have seen now from my teaching the form of true happiness; you know now its place: let us go quickly through all that must be lightly passed over, and let me shew you the road which shall lead you to your home. I will give wings to your mind, by which it shall raise itself aloft: so shal l disquiet be driven away, and you may return safe to your home by my guidance, by the path I shall shew you, even by myself carrying you thither.\n\n'Yea, airy wings are mine to scale the heights of heaven; when these the min d has donned, swiftly she loathes and spurns this earth. She soars above the sphere of this vast atmosphere, sees the clouds behind her far; she passes high above the topmost fires which seethe above the feverish turmoil of the air,1 until she rises\n\n103:1 -- This and some of the following lines allude to some of the theories of the early Physicists.\n\nPage 104\n\nto the stars' own home, and joins her path unto the sun's; or accompanies on her path the cold and ancient Saturn, maybe as the shining warrior Mars; or she may take her course through the circle of every star that decks the night. And when she has had her fill of journeying, then m ay she leave the sky and tread the outer plane of the swift moving air, as mistress of the awful light. Here holds the King of kings His sway, and guides the reins of the universe, and Himself unmoved He drives His winged chariot, the bright disposer of the world. And if this path brings thee again hither, the path that now thy memory seeks to recall, I tell thee, thou shalt say, \" This is my home, hence was I derived, here shall I stay my course.\" But if thou choose to look back upon the earth ly night behind thee, thou shalt see as exiles from light the tyrants whose grimness made wretched peoples so to fear.'\n\n'Wondrous,' I cried; 'what vast things do you promise! and I doubt not that you can fulfil them. I onl y beg that you will not hold me back with delays, now that you have excited me thus far.'\n\n'First, then, you must learn that power is never lacking to the good, while the wicked are devoid of all strength. The proofs of these two statements hang upon each othe"
