Many parents will go out and buy their child a 2,000 page book profiling over 3,000 schools. Such guidebooks provide information about included schools, but the number of choices is overwhelming and there is no clear direction on how to gain a list of schools that are best for the student. Some parents may pay for their child to get private college admissions counseling, which can be very helpful, but typically is only available to families that can afford to pay the many thousands of dollars that these services often can cost. Some students may take the initiative to meet with their guidance counselors at school, and who often are overseeing too many students to give a substantial amount of time in helping students find the right schools.\n\n[0004] There are numerous books and websites that can help students narrow their college choices. For example, in his book, My College Finder, Dr. Steven Antonoff has created lists of schools according to topics. For example, there are lists of schools under topics, such as \"Colleges that admit many students early,\" or \"Colleges with excellent theater programs.\" Dr. Antonoff gives the example of a student with average grades who desires a Catholic college with a good tennis team. Dr. Antonoff states that this student could look at the different lists under these categories and find schools that are mentioned in each of the lists. However, the problem with this approach is that a student may choose factors that bear very little on the experience the student will have at a chosen school. If the student makes a decision to go to such a Catholic school with the good tennis team, but finds that the size of the school is overwhelming or the student is getting homesick from being too far away from home, the student will not have a positive experience in college.\n\n[0005] There are several websites that generate lists of schools according to preferences entered by students. For example, at embark.com, which recently merged with the Princeton Review, a student is asked to answer approximately seventeen questions. Some examples of the questions asked are: \"What annual out-of-state tuition levels are you interested in?\" \"Are you interested in schools based on the percentage of undergraduates who receive financial aid?\" \"What percentage of applicants accepted interests you?\" \"Are you interested in schools based on the racial and ethnic diversity of the student body?\" \"What activities interest you?\" \"How important to you is a fraternity or sorority presence on campus?\" Similarly, at petersons.com, students are asked about ten questions, including questions, such as their preference for faculty/student ratio and religious denomination.\n\n[0006] However, such surveys can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Also, the sheer number of questions is often confusing, as typically there is no prioritizing of the many questions asked of the student. Another serious flaw of these systems is the resulting list of schools that are generated. For example, the lists are random in total number, ranging from zero to several hundred or even a few thousand colleges.\n\n[0007] Another flaw in the above-mentioned programs is that typically they do not provide a systematic method of screening out unreliable schools. For example, the college selection program at embark.com typically is the only one that asks what level of freshman retention rates a student would prefer. However, the problem is that the student is left unguided as to an appropriate retention rate for schools at various levels of competitiveness. In addition, leaving such decisions to the uninstructed preference of students can lead to unreliable and often random results. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0008] Therefore, there is a need for a system and method that directs students to look at factors that will have the greatest impact on their experience in college. There also is a need for a system and method that is simple to use, time efficient, and that generates a list with a reasonable number of recommended schools (e.g., between six and twenty schools) for the student to consider. There further is a need for a college selection system and method to set standards of freshman retention rates based on a comprehensive review of the norms and averages of retention rates at colleges throughout a country, such as the United States.\n\n[0009] The above and other needs are addressed by the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, which provide a system and method for selection of an educational institution, including a student choosing a preferable region for the educational institution, choosing a preference for type and size of the educational institution, and choosing a selectivity level that is most appropriate to the grades and test scores of the student. An index that is provided lists the groupings of educational institutions that satisfy the specified criteria according to one or more states in the selected region. Advantageously, the educational institution selection system and method of the exemplary embodiments provides a simple and yet profoundly effective and economical system and method for identifying lists of potential schools of interest, for example, by focusing a student on important factors in choosing schools, and then generating a list of schools that fit such criteria and that have a proven record of helping students succeed.\n\n[0010] Accordingly, in exemplary aspects of the present invention, a system, method, and computer program product for selecting an educational institution are provided. The system, method, and computer program product include determining selection criteria for an educational institution, including a location of the educational institution, a type and size of the educational institution, and an admission selectivity of the educational institution; and generating a list of one or more recommended schools satisfying the selection criteria, wherein the recommended schools satisfy predetermined freshman retention rates and graduation rates and financial costs.\n\n10011] Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of exemplary embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The present invention also is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0012] The embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:\n\n[0013] FIG. 1 is a map illustrating the United States of America divided into four regions, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0014] FIG. 2 is a map illustrating the states in the Northeast region of the map of\n\nFIG. 1, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0015] FIG. 3 is a map illustrating the states in the South region of the map of\n\nFIG. 1, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0016] FlG. 4 is a map illustrating the states in the Midwest region of the map of\n\nFIG. 1, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0017] FIG. 5 is a map illustrating the states in the West region of the map of FIG.\n\n1 , according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0018] FIG. 6 illustrates selectivity levels and grade point average (GPA) and scholastic assessment test (SAT) ranges associated with each level, including screening standards used for each selectivity level in terms of percentages of freshman retention and students graduating, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0019] FIG. 7 illustrates a portion of an index listing possible combinations of selection factors for educational institutions, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0020] FIG. 8 illustrates detailed information for educational institutions corresponding to the possible combinations of selection factors of FIG. 7, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0021] FIG. 9 is a flow chart for illustrating a educational institution selection process, according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0022] FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary system that can be configured to perform the exemplary educational institution selection processes of FIGS. 1-9; [0023] FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary computer system, which can be programmed to perform one or more of the processes of the described exemplary embodiments;\n\n[0024] FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary freshman year checklist for preparing for college;\n\n[0025] FIG. 13 illustrates an exemplary sophomore year checklist for preparing for college;\n\n[0026] FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary junior year first semester checklist for preparing for college;\n\n[0027] FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary junior year second semester checklist for preparing for college;\n\n[0028] FIG. 16 illustrates an exemplary checklist for preparing for college during the summer prior to senior year;\n\n[0029] FIG. 17 illustrates an exemplary senior year first semester checklist for preparing for college;\n\n[0030] FIG. 18 illustrates an exemplary senior year second semester checklist for preparing for college;\n\n[0031] FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary table of content for resource materials according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0032] FIG. 20 illustrates an exemplary selection box according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0033] FIG. 21 illustrates an another exemplary selection box according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0034] FIG. 22 illustrates an another exemplary selection box according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0035] FIG. 23 illustrates a listing of system-side state university applications contact information according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0036] FIG. 24 illustrates a first page of an exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment; [0037J FIG. 25 illustrates a second page of an exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0038] FIG. 26 illustrates a third page of an exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n10039] FIG. 27 illustrates a fourth page of an exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0040] FIG. 28 illustrates a fifth page of an exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0041] FIG. 29 illustrates a first page of another exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0042] FIG. 30 illustrates a second page of another exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0043] FIG. 31 illustrates a third page of another exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0044] FIG. 32 illustrates a fourth page of another exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0045] FIG. 33 illustrates a fifth page of another exemplary completed undergraduate application according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0046] FIG. 34 illustrates an on-line financial web page according to an exemplary embodiment;\n\n[0047] .

A study done between 1997 and 1999 by the U.S. Census Bureau compares the average annual earnings of workers with some college education and those with a college degree. Those with some college education who were working full time earned $36,800 a year while those with a college degree who were working full time earned $52,200. This is a difference of over $15,000 a year. This emphasizes the importance of not just getting into college, but being able to graduate from college.\n\n[0072] Typically, conventional systems and methods do not screen schools using both freshman retention rates and graduation rates. While independent college admissions counselors may have the expertise to steer students away from unreliable schools, there is a need to make this information available to a larger portion of the college-applying population, which, even just counting high school seniors in 1999, was over 1.7 million people a year.(See Hunter Breland, et al., Trends in College Admissions, A Report of a Survey of Undergraduate Admissions Policies, Practices and Procedures (2002), available on the world wide web (www) atnacac. com/do wnloads/research_summaryreport.pdf.\n\n{0073] The present invention further includes recognition that that there is a need to set standards that are correlated to the competitiveness of a school. In recent years, at Georgetown University, for example, about 13,000 students apply for admission annually and only 3,000 are accepted. Thus, the students who are accepted are extremely bright and accomplished students. If after the first year, however, 15% of these capable students dropped out or if after six years a total of only 60% of the original freshman class had graduated, this would be inexcusable. If a school with an open admissions policy, on the other hand, has a lower freshman retention or graduation rate, it is more understandable, as there was a much less competitive selection.\n\n[0074] Accordingly, several objects and advantages of the exemplary educational institution selection system and method can include getting students thinking about the high- priority factors that will have the biggest impact on their experience in school, generating a manageable list of schools based on preferences of the students within the high-priority factors, providing a list of recommended schools that have been pre-screened, for example, taking into account both freshman retention rates and graduation rates, the selectivity of the school, and the like, and adjusting standards accordingly. The exemplary educational institution selection system and method, advantageously, can be simple, time efficient, and affordably priced, so as to be widely used by a large segment of the population.\n\n[0075] In an exemplary embodiment, the educational institution selection system and method can employ various factors in determining a student's prospective school experience, for example, including the location, type/size, and the selectivity of the educational institution. The location of the educational institution typically can be an important factor, as the location can determine the student's distance from home, and homesickness felt by the student, which, incidentally, is one of the main reasons students leave college in their first year. The location also can determine the climate and the type of outdoor activities the student can do, such as skiing or swimming at the beach, and the like. There are also distinctive regional cultural characteristics that could impact on the student's total college experience.\n\n[0076] The type and size of the educational institution also can be a key factor that determines educational elements, such as the average size of classes, access to professors, diversity of course offerings, and the like. The type and size factor also can often have a defining impact on the social aspects of the student's experience. The selectivity level of the educational institution also can be extremely important in choosing a college. First and foremost, the selectivity level can indicate the likelihood of acceptance. The selectivity level also can determine the academic pressure once enrolled that a student can expect to experience. For example, if a student barely is accepted into a most selective school that is academically very demanding, such a student may find themselves in the bottom half of the class and not enjoying the pressures of such an environment. Such a student may very well do better at a very selective school, which makes fewer demands and puts less pressure on its students to perform.\n\n[0077] The exemplary embodiments can be used to zero in on the above-noted factors, whereas conventional systems and methods typically do not. The exemplary embodiments further generate a manageable list of schools, for example, numbering no fewer than six and no more than twenty-six. An exception can preferably be made, for example, for the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which can be listed in a single list regardless of region and by state.\n\n[0078] The exemplary embodiments further can pre-screen the recommended schools, so as to include schools having a proven track record of keeping and graduating its students. For example, a recommended school is pre-screened for freshman retention rates and graduation rates based on a comprehensive review of the norms and averages of retention and graduation rates at colleges throughout the United States. The rates used to screen the schools can follow a sliding scale according to the selectivity of the school. By contrast, conventional system and methods typically do not employ such an extensive screening process. Advantageously, the exemplary embodiments protect the consumer, the student, and his or her family, from institutions that fail to help students persist in a degree program all the way to graduation.\n\n[0079] One of the unexpected results of the exemplary embodiments is that some schools that are widely known and respected regionally and even nationally may be screened out. In the Northeast, for example, Temple University, Adelphi University, and Emerson College did not make the list of recommended schools based on such screening process. In the south, George Mason University, Moorehead State University, and The University of North Carolina at Greensboro did not make the list either. In the Midwest, Indiana University South Bend, Wichita State University, and University of Michigan-Flint were all cut from the list. Lastly, in the West, California State University Bakersfield, San Diego State University, and University of Colorado at Denver, among others, were eliminated from the list. Although such schools are well regarded and competitive, such schools did not have an equally high standard for keeping and graduating their students. [0080] For example, Temple University, to take just one school, which was cut from the list, was nonetheless listed in AntonofPs book, My College Finder, under 22 different topics, such as, \"Colleges with Outstanding Music Departments,\" \"Colleges with Fine Women's Studies Programs\" and \"Colleges with Strong Lacrosse Programs,\" driving home the distinction between the present invention and conventional systems and methods. Thus, the exemplary educational institution selection system and method can yield completely different results from conventional college recommendation systems and methods. The exemplary embodiments can yield different results than conventional college recommendation systems and methods, for example, because in addition to the student's expressed preference for the specified factors, a given recommend school on the list is determined by explicit standards of adequacy in keeping and graduating its students.\n\n[0081] The exemplary embodiments further provide an educational institution selection process that, advantageously, can be performed in a matter of minutes, easing the sense of being overwhelmed that a lot of students feel when they first begin the selection process. In addition, the entire program of the exemplary embodiments can cost less than a fraction of what private counseling costs, making the exemplary educational institution selection system and method accessible to a large segment of the population.\n\n[0082] In an exemplary embodiment, the educational institution selection system and method can be configured into parts, for example, in the form of software modules or manuals that can be part of a larger software module or manual set. For example, one module or manual (e.g., called Find My College in 28 Minutes) can be configured to focus on factors in selecting an educational institution, such as where the educational institution is located, the type and size of the educational institution, admissions selectivity of the educational institution, and the like. Another module or manual (e.g., called My College Finder) can be configured to provide a list of the educational institutions grouped according to possible combinations of the different factors.\n\n[0083] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to FIG. 1 thereof, there is illustrated a map 100 of the United States of America divided into four regions, according to an exemplary embodiment. In FIG. 1, the Find My College in 28 Minutes module or manual, for example, can be configured to allow a student to choose a region in a country, such as the United States, where the student wishes to attend college. In an exemplary embodiment, the United States can be divided into four regions, for example, including a Northeast region 102, a South region 104, a Midwest region 106, and a West region 108. As shown in FIGs. 2-5, each of the four regions 102-104 can include the states that are listed therein for determining educational institutions within a given region.\n\n[0084] In an exemplary embodiment, the Find My College in 28 Minutes module or manual can be configured to ask the student to choose the type and size of the educational institution the student wishes to attend. For example, educational institutions, such as colleges, universities, and the like, can be broken down into basic types and sizes, including research/large universities, liberal arts colleges, small/medium universities, specialized colleges, schools with special characteristics, community colleges, the top 21 private and public institutions, which are so prestigious and sought after that they constitute a category of their own, and the like.\n\n[0085] In an exemplary embodiment, research universities can include universities that emphasize not only undergraduate education, but graduate education as well (e.g., Masters and Doctoral programs, etc.) Large universities can be similar to research universities in that they have big enrollments (e.g., over 10,000 students), but differ in that they have fewer graduate programs (e.g., especially at the Ph.D. level) and little research activity. For example, the large universities can include public universities.\n\n[0086] In an exemplary embodiment, liberal arts colleges can include colleges having several hundred to a few thousand students, their main focus being undergraduate education, and carrying a broad range of courses in the arts and sciences. Small/medium universities can include a cross between a large research university and a liberal arts college, and, for example, having between 3,000-6,000 undergraduate students.\n\n[0087] ' In an exemplary embodiment, specialized colleges can include art/music schools, engineering/architectural schools, business schools, health science schools, military schools, trade schools, and the like. Community colleges can include colleges that include two-year schools (e.g., also called junior colleges), colleges that offer two-year associates degree programs, and the like.\n\n[0088] hi an exemplary embodiment, schools with special characteristics can include historically black colleges and universities, women's colleges, religious schools, and the like. For example, religious schools can include schools that are similar to typical colleges, but require religious observance or a significantly higher than usual number of religion courses needed for graduation. [0089] In an exemplary embodiment, the Find My College in 28 Minutes module or manual can be configured to ask the student to decide the most fitting level of selectivity for an educational institution. FIG. 6 illustrates a page or screen 600, including selectivity levels and grade point average (GPA) and scholastic assessment test (SAT) ranges associated with each level, including screening standards used for each selectivity level in terms of percentages of freshman retention and students graduating, according to an exemplary embodiment, hi FIG. 6, such selectivity levels, for example, can include most selective 602, very selective 604, selective 606, less selective 608, and the like. The exemplary selectivity levels can be described in terms of GPA and SAT score ranges, as shown in FIG. 6.\n\n[0090] In an exemplary embodiment, such standards can be applied in a context- sensitive way, for example, according to region and state. For example, the range of GPA and standardized test scores within a given level of selectivity 602-608 can tend to the higher end of the range in the Northeast region 102, whereas in the South region 104 the range of GPA and standardized test scores within a given level of selectivity 602-608 can tend toward the lower end of the range.\n\n[0091] In an exemplary embodiment, the various combinations of the above factors can be indexed. FIG. 7 illustrates a portion of an index page or screen 700 configured for listing possible combinations 702 of selection factors for educational institutions, according to an exemplary embodiment. In FIG. 7, such an index can be configured to refer to links or page numbers 704 in the My College Finder module or manual. For example, for the combination 706 (Northeast, Small/Medium Universities, Very Selective), a page 708 or screen from the My College Finder module or manual can be accessed, either by accessing the noted page of the My College Finder manual directly or by providing a link (e.g., a hyperlink) in the screen 700 thereto.\n\n[0092] FIG. 8 illustrates a detailed information page or screen 800 for educational institutions corresponding to the possible combination 706 of selection factors of FIG. 7, according to an exemplary embodiment, hi FIG. 8, the page or screen 800 from the My College Finder module or manual can be configured to list the names 810, website addresses 804, admissions office addresses 806 and phone numbers 808, and the like, of the schools that fit into the selected category 706. In an exemplary embodiment, the My College Finder module or manual can be configured to list each school under the state 810 in which the school is located, and can include an indication 812 of a private or public status of a given school, and selection fields 814 for entering the consideration status (e.g., Yes, Maybe, No, etc.) for a given school by the student.\n\n[0093] In an exemplary embodiment, because of the insufficient number of\n\nSmall/Medium universities, for example, in the South region 104, the West region 108, and the Midwest region 106, the list of the most selective and very selective schools can be combined in such regions. Due to the limited number of Art and Music schools, Engineering and Architecture schools, Women's Colleges and Religious Colleges, a location preference need only be made available for such categories. Due to the even smaller number of Business Colleges, Health Science Colleges, and Military Colleges, such schools can be listed without additional preference options. Historically Black Colleges and Universities also can be given in a single list, as the overwhelming majority of such schools are located in the South region 104.\n\n[0094] In an exemplary embodiment, the two-year colleges can be listed with just the location preference. In the My College Finder module or manual, however, such schools can be listed not only by state, but also by city, because most students will only go to a two year school that is in the surrounding area and that allows the student to commute from work or home.\n\n[0095] In an exemplary embodiment, the criteria to become a recommended school can be based, for example, on pre-screening each school so as to recommend schools with a record of helping students succeed at such institution. In addition, each school can be pre-screened for freshman retention rates and graduation rates. Further, schools can be judged by a standard that is correlated to one of the four competitive levels in which the school can be placed. For example, schools in the selective category 606 can include schools having a freshman drop-out rate of 25% or less and a graduation rate of 55% or more (e.g., after six years). The schools in the most selective category, on the other hand, can include schools having a freshman drop-out rate of 10% or less and graduation rates of 70% or more. FIG. 6 shows the percentages for each selectivity level, according to an exemplary embodiment. For example, after reviewing over 2,000 accredited four-year U.S. colleges and universities, only 900 schools can be recommended based on the above recommendation criteria.\n\n[0096] In an exemplary embodiment, there may be schools that are recommended that do not meet the standards shown in FIG. 6 for retention and graduation. Such schools can be included, for example, because there are no other alternatives in a given region, and can be designated with the letter \"C\" next to such schools in the My College Finder module or manual to indicate to the student to apply to such schools with caution.\n\n[0097] FIG. 9 is a flow chart for illustrating an educational institution selection process, according to an exemplary embodiment. In an exemplary embodiment, the educational institution selection system and method can be configured as an interactive system. For example, at step 902, starting with the Find My College in 28 Minutes module or manual, a student can choose a preferable region from the regions 102-108 for selecting one or more educational institutions to apply. At step 904, the student can choose a preference for type and size of educational institution, for example, after being provided with a clear and simple explanation of the various options. At step 906, the student can choose one of the selectivity levels 602-608 that are most appropriate to grades and test scores of the student. In a further exemplary embodiment, the Find My College in 28 Minutes module can be configured to automatically select one of the selectivity levels 602-608 based on grades and test scores entered by the student.\n\n[0098] At step 908, after determining a preference for the above-noted areas, the student can refer or be linked to the index page or screen 700 from the Find My College in 28 Minutes module or manual. The index page or screen 700 then can be used to refer or link to the pages or screens 800 from the My College Finder module or manual, which can list the groupings of schools that fit the specified criteria, according to the corresponding state. At step 910, the student can use the information from the pages or screens 800 to apply at one or more of the recommended schools.\n\n[0099] In an exemplary embodiment, the educational institution selection process of FIG. 9 can be repeated over and over by the same student using different preferences, for example, when a student is not sure about location, type or size, and/or selectivity criteria. In a further exemplary embodiment, the educational institution selection system and method can be configured to automate the process for applying to one or more of the recommended schools.\n\n[00100] In an exemplary embodiment, for example, if a student wanted to consider schools that are in the Northeast, that are Small/Medium universities, and that are very selective, the index page or screen 700 can be configured to direct the student to page 16 or screen 800 of the My College Finder module or manual, where the student can find a list of schools (e.g., ten) that are recommended. As shown in FIG. 8, for example, under Massachusetts, Brandeis University can be listed, under Connecticut, Fairfield University can be listed, under New York, Clarkson University, Ithaca College, Marist College and State University of New York College at Geneseo can be listed, under New Jersey, Drew University, and Richard Stockton College of New Jersey can be listed, under Pennsylvania, St. Joseph's University, and University of Scranton can be listed, and the like.\n\n[00101] The exemplary embodiments, advantageously, provide a novel system and method for making the best choice in selecting an educational institution. The exemplary embodiments focus on various factors when choosing a college or university, for example, including location, the type of school (e.g., ranging from small college to large research university), the admissions selectivity of a school, and the like. Such factors and the possible combinations thereof then can be used to generate a list of recommended schools that satisfy such criteria, hi addition, each of the recommended schools can be pre-screened to include schools with a record of helping students succeed, for example, based on freshman retention rates and graduation rates.\n\n[00102] In an exemplary embodiment, a sliding scale standard can be employed for the freshman retention rates and graduation rates, for example, according to the selectivity of the school. For example, for schools that have higher admissions standards, such schools can be required for school recommendation to have proportionately higher standards of freshman retention rates and graduation rates. Likewise, for schools with lower admissions standards, the freshman retention and graduation rates required for school recommendation can be correspondingly lower.\n\n[00103] FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary system 1000 that can be configured to perform the exemplary educational institution selection process of FIGs. 1-9. In FIG. 10, the exemplary system 1000, for example, can include one or more user devices 1002 coupled over a communications network 1010 to a computer system, such as server 1004, and the like. The server 1004 can include a computer 1006 and a college finder database 1008, for example, for storing the educational institution information, and the like, employed by the exemplary educational institution selection process. Students can connect, via the user devices 1002, over the communications network 1010, such as the Internet, to the server 1004, which can be configured to perform the exemplary educational institution selection process of FIGs. 1-9 by accessing the college finder database 1008 and displaying the exemplary pages or screens on a web browser of the user devices 1002. In further exemplary embodiments, the functions performed by the server 1004 and the college finder database 1008 can be implemented, for example, as stand-alone windows software running on the user devices 1002, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s).\n\n[00104] In an exemplary embodiment, a set of materials may be provided for facilitating educational institutional selection. These materials may include a set of one or more manuals and products from Getting Started with My College AdvisorÂ®. Accordingly, these materials provide instructions which, in one example, may include the following instructional steps:\n\n[00105] Begin with Manual 1 : Find My College in 28 Minutes, which directs you to choose your preferences for location, type/size and selectivity level. Your selections here will refer you to a page number in My College Finder. It also takes you through the steps to narrow down your Preliminary List of Schools.\n\n[00106] Notice the inserts included in this manual, especially How to Prepare for\n\nCollege During Your High School Career, which provides valuable academic and extracurricular activity guidance beginning from the freshman year.\n\n[00107] Turn to the appropriate pages in My College Finder where you will find your customized list of potential colleges. Remember that all these schools have been pre- screened for freshman retention rates and graduation rates so that you can rest assured these schools do a good job of helping you succeed and graduate.\n\n[00108] Notice in the back you will also find 1,000 two-year schools which have been selected for their excellence in helping students transfer to four-year schools with full credit.\n\n[00109] Insert the My College Guidebook CD-ROM into your computer to read the profile of each school on your Preliminary List.\n\n[00110] Read Manual II; How to Succeed in the College Admissions Process which shows you how to fill out a great application and write a winning essay. It also gives you a step-by-step formula for getting fantastic recommendations and nailing the college interview. Follow it carefully and you can't go wrong!\n\n[00111] Both you and at least one of your parents should read Manual III. How to\n\nPay for College, which shows you how to get the most financial aid and creative ways to cut down on costs. [00112] Along with Manual III, use the My College Financial Facts CD-ROM which features My Financial Facts, where you can see which of your schools tend to meet most of students' financial need. The CD also contains a directory of Federal/CSS School Codes, which contains both the federal and CSS school codes; a list of State Higher Education Agencies; and a list of College Savings Plans (\"529s\") by state.\n\n[00113] Along with Manuals I and III, you may find it helpful to visit www.mycollegenow.com and use our online College Finder and calculator to compare college costs. In order to access this information, you must first register your serial number, which is located on the back cover of the My College Financial Facts CD-ROM. Please remember that 60% of accredited four-year colleges have been eliminated because they did not meet our criteria.\n\n[00114] A comparative chart of colleges may be provided to compare the characteristics of colleges, for example, on a preliminary list. It may be especially useful in comparing schools with similarities. The comparative chart may include one or more categories such as \"College Name\", \"Setting\", \"Type\", \"Total Number of Undergrads\", \"Admission Deadline\", \"My Possible Majors\", \"Diversity of Student Body\", \"My Student Activities\", \"Special Academic Programs\", and \"Costs\". The category \"Setting\" may be further described, for example, as very large city, large city, small city/large town, small town, and rural community. The category \"Type\" may be further described, for example, as research university, liberal arts college, small/medium university, specialized college, and community college. The category \"Diversity of Student Body\" may be further described, for example, as very diverse, diverse, and not diverse. The category \"Special Academic Programs\" may be further described, for example, as honors programs, study abroad programs, \"3-2\" B.A./M.A. programs, and cooperative program.\n\n[00115] FIGS. 12 -18 illustrate a checklist to prepare for and apply to college throughout various stages of a student's high school career. In some instances, the checklist may include additional referrals to other materials such as appropriate sections in Manuals I, II and III of the exemplary embodiment.\n\n[00116] The exemplary materials provided for facilitating educational institutional selection may further include an index of schools categorized within the area regions shown, for example, in FIGS. 1-5. The schools within these regions can be categorized according to location, size and type (from small colleges to large research universities), competitive level, and specialties such as business, art/music, health sciences and engineering. These sets also include schools with special characteristics such as women's colleges, and religious or historically black colleges and universities, etc. The exemplary materials can facilitate choosing the right kind of school for a prospective student and guide them to a set of schools in that matches their preferences.\n\n[00117] Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a review of over\n\n2,000 accredited four-year U.S. colleges and universities, of which 900 schools may be carefully selected. The present invention may provide additional criteria such as ensuring that only schools that have a record of helping students succeed at their institutions are recommended. For schools that have high admissions standards, it is preferable that they have a correspondingly high success ratio in keeping and graduating students. Many schools not meeting a standards for keeping students beyond the first year or graduating enough of their students may be excluded.\n\n[00118] The present invention may further employ standards for selectivity such as in a context-sensitive way by region and state. Thus, in one example, GPA refers to high school grade point average. Freshman drop-out rates include student transfers to other schools after the first year:\n\n[00119] Most selective: GPA=3.6-4.0, SAT= 1950-2400; ACT=29-36; freshman drop-out rate= 10% or less; graduation rate=70% ox more;\n\n[00120] Very selective: GPA=3.0-3.6; SAT= 1695- 1950; ACT=25-29; freshman drop-out rate=15% or less; graduation rate=60% or more;\n\n[00121] Selective: GPA=2.5-3.0; SAT=I 500-1695; ACT=21-25; freshman dropout rate=25% or less; graduation rate=55% or more;\n\n[00122] Less selective: GPA=2.0-2.5; SAT=I 050- 1500; ACT=14-21; freshman drop-out rate=30% or less; graduation rate=50% or more;\n\n[00123] Hence, for each college or university, a respective category of \"most selective\", \"very selective\", \"selective\" and \"less selective\" may be utilized to assist a student in choice a school of preference .\n\n[00124] The present invention preferably includes 1,000 two-year institutions that are divided regionally and then listed by state and town in alphabetical order. Preferably schools that have an established transfer policy for their graduates to go on to four-year institutions were also included. Any private two-year colleges that are higher-priced are preferably excluded.\n\n[00125] Thus, a comprehensive list of colleges and universities within the aforementioned regions corresponding, for example, to FIGS. 1-5 may be provided. As shown, for example, in the chart below, each list of colleges and universities may include categories including, for example, \"yes\", \"maybe\", and \"no\" as possible choices indicating a level of interest for respective schools.\n\nYes Maybe No\n\nRobinson\n\nIllinois Eastern Community www.iecc.cc.il.us/ltc\n\nColleges: Lincoln Trail College\n\n11220 State Highway I, Robinson, IL\n\n62454-5707\n\nPhone: (618) 544-8657 Public\n\n[00126] The present invention may also provide a set of materials to facilitate a selection of a college or university. For example, one set of materials may include a set of one or more products or manuals such as the Getting Started with My College AdvisorÂ®. These materials may offer the My College AdvisorÂ® system which simplifies the college selection process and provides a prospective student with the tools necessary to choose a school. The system provides a systematic approach within a predetermined time for aiding in selection of a college or university. In one preferred embodiment, My College AdvisorÂ® will aid you in developing a customized list of schools that match a student's personal preferences in approximately 28 minutes and three steps. Thus, in order to generate a selection in accordance with the present invention, one disclosed set of materials includes a table of contents as shown, for example in FIG. 19. The exemplary materials may also include information which reads within a manual, for example, as follows:\n\n[00127] The manual provides a step-by-step process to assist you in finding the right college. Follow each of our 1-10 steps carefully and thoughtfully and in just a short time you will have developed your own personal list of potential schools!\n\n[00128]\n\n[00129] Why Choosing the Right College is Important\n\n[00130] Your college choice will decide: [00131] â¢ The students you'll be with for four years and the friends you'll make\n\n[00132] Each college has its own \"personality,\" Some are \"intellectual,\" some are\n\n\"artsy,\" some are \"politically active\" or \"career-driven.\" Decide what personality fits you and you'll have an easier time developing friendships, and more importantly, ensuring a positive and rewarding four-year experience for yourself.\n\n[00133] â¢ What you can study\n\n[00134] Each college has its own educational focus. If you know what field of work you want to pursue, then it's important to choose a college which is strong in that field. If you want to be a scientist, choose a college that's strong in the sciences, whether it's physics, chemistry, or biology, At this point in your life, you may not know what you want to major in and that is okay. In this case, we strongly recommend choosing a school that can provide you with a broad education for the first two years, then provide several options of majors, which can be decided by you. Choose a school that offers a range of majors you might be interested in.\n\n[00135] Where you will be for four years\n\n[00136] Every school comes with its own environment, College will be your space for studying, socializing, and living for four or more years. The neighborhood around the college will be your new environment. You will need to decide what kind of environment you want to live in. To make this decision, some questions you need to ask yourself are:\n\n[00137] Can you handle the pace of a large city university?\n\nDo you prefer a small college in the countryside?\n\nCan you see yourself attending this school for four straight years?\n\n[00138] Choosing a college with the right \"personality\" and environment, which also offers very broad educational opportunities, is extremely important to ensure an enjoyable and successful college experience.\n\n[00139] You will have an opportunity to explore, in depth, your potential major, personality of your schools, and their various environments in Steps 5, 7, and 9.\n\n[00140] Step 1\n\n[00141] Choose the Key Factors You Want in a College [00142] There are three key factors to keep in mind when choosing a college or university to attend: where it is located; what type of school it is; and, the school's admissions selectivity.\n\n[00143] WHERE: Which region of the country?\n\n[00144] In terms of where you will go to school, begin by looking at the big picture. As you can see in the map below, the U.S. is divided into four\" regions: Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. The states in each region are listed after the map (e.g., see FIG. 1 and the chart below).\n\nNortheast South Midwest West\n\n1. Maine 1. Maryland 1. Michigan 1. Montana\n\n2. New Hampshire 2. District of 2. Ohio Wyoming\n\n3. Vermont Columbia * 3. Indiana Colorado\n\n4. Massachusetts 3. West Virginia 4. Wisconsin New Mexico\n\n5. Rhode Island 4. Virginia 5. Illinois Arizona\n\n6. Connecticut 5. North Carolina 6. Minnesota Utah\n\n7. New York 6. South Carolina 7. Iowa Idaho\n\n8. New Jersey 7. Kentucky 8. Missouri Nevada\n\n9. Pennsylvania 8. Tennessee 9. Kansas California\n\n10. Delaware 9. Georgia 10. Nebraska Oregon\n\n10. Florida 11. South Dakota Washington\n\n11. Alabama 12. North Dakota Alaska\n\n12. Mississippi Hawaii\n\n13. Louisiana\n\n14. Arkansas\n\n15. Oklahoma\n\n16. Texas\n\n[00145] Here's what to consider when choosing the region where you will go to school.\n\n[00146] Things to consider about region:\n\n[00147] â¢ Distance from home\n\n[00148] Do you want to go to a college that's close to home or far away? How often do you want to come home? How easy or difficult is it to get home? Is there public or private transportation available? And what are the costs of transportation?\n\n[00149] * Climate [00150] Climate can differ even within a state, not just within a region. You need to be aware at least of what general climate you'd prefer when looking for your colleges. Some questions to consider are: Do you want to spend four years in a climate with four distinct seasons? Then look at the Northeast and Midwest. Do you want to be where it's always warm and sunny? Then go South. Do you want to go skiing in your free time? Then parts of the Northeast, West, and Midwest will probably suit you. Do you like to swim at the beach? Then the South and parts of the West might be right for you. If you have a hard time with weather that's too cold, too hot, or humid, keep that in mind when considering region and state.\n\n[00151J â¢ The people and local culture\n\n[00152] People and local culture also differ by region. The pace of life varies from region to region. What's popular to eat or to play as a sport in one region may not be so in another. Ask people who've traveled or use the Web to learn more about what a place or state is like.\n\n[00153] Wherever you go to school, its still America but there will be noticeable differences, especially if you go to school far from home. So, take a moment and identify now where in the country you would like to go to school (see FIG. 20).\n\n[00154] What TYPE of college or university?\n\n[00155] The majority of colleges and universities in America are private, meaning they are supported by tuition, fees, and gifts. But a large number are public: they are run by state or local governments and partially supported by tax dollars. Every state has one or more public four-year universities. There are also numerous two-year community colleges that are usually run by states, counties, or cities.\n\n[00156] Public colleges and universities are usually cheaper to attend than private ones, especially if you are a resident of that state or locality. Many public universities have reputations that rival the best private schools, so you may be able to get a great bargain.\n\n[00157] My College Advisor' has divided all colleges and universities into six basic types:\n\n[00158] 1. Research/large university\n\n[00159] These are universities where there can be several tens of thousands of students. Research universities emphasize not only undergraduate education, but graduate education as well (master's and doctoral programs). They are supported not only by tuition and gifts, but by research dollars from government contracts and private sources. Some examples are New York University and Boston University (private universities), and Texas A&M University and the University of Colorado at Boulder (public universities).\n\n100160] Large universities are similar to research universities in that they have big enrollments (over 10,000 students), but differ in that they have fewer graduate programs (especially at the doctoral level) and little research activity. Usually these schools are public universities.\n\n[001611 2. Small/medium university\n\n[00162] This type of university is a cross between a large research university and a liberal arts college. It usually has between 3,000-6,000 undergraduate students. It emphasizes undergraduate education, but does have some graduate and research programs. Some examples are Pepperdine, Brandeis, and Rice universities.\n\n[00163] 3. Liberal arts college\n\n[00164] These colleges can have from several hundred to a few thousand students.\n\nTheir main focus is undergraduate education and they carry a broad range of courses in the arts and sciences. They are funded usually from tuition and alumni contributions. In a liberal arts college, you can usually get more personal interaction with professors. Some examples are Amherst, Swarthmore, Oberlin, and Reed colleges.\n\n[00165] Does school size matter to you? If you came from a small high school and always felt it was too limited, you may want to look at large or at least small/medium universities. On the other hand, if you really liked your small school or you felt lost and unhappy in your big high school, then a liberal arts college may be just right for you.\n\n[00166] 4. Schools with special characteristics\n\n[00167] Whether a university or a college, there are three kinds of schools with special characteristics. The advantage of each is that you can be with other students who are mostly of the same gender, race, or religious background as yourself. For some, this kind of environment may be more nurturing than a school with a broader student body. A few schools combine several of these characteristics.\n\n[00168] â¢ Historically Black Colleges and Universities: These schools are found primarily in the South. Many of them have been around for up to 150 years. In My College Finder, we also include among Historically Black Colleges and Universities those schools that are overwhelmingly African- American in student population.\n\n[00169] â¢ Women's Colleges: Many women's schools went officially co-ed over the last 30 years, but there are still several women's schools in each region. (My College Finder considers institutions to be women's schools even if a small minority of men are enrolled).\n\n[001701 Religious colleges and universities: These schools are not seminaries that train ministers, or schools that are simply affiliated with a particular religious organization. For My College Finder, we define a \"religious school\" as similar to a typical college, but requiring regular religious observance or a higher than usual number of religion courses. Usually, this kind of school will have mostly students of the same faith.\n\n[00171] 5. Specialized colleges\n\n[00172] For a vast majority of students, you can get a good education in your major at a Research/large university, Small/medium university, or Liberal Arts college. That is the best way to prepare for your career. For instance, even if you want to be a business leader the best MBA programs prefer students with a strong liberal arts education over those with a more narrow professional college degree. Furthermore, many universities and colleges offer an undergraduate business degree and may even have a school of business. The same may be said of degrees in art, engineering, and the health professions,\n\n[00173] However, if you already have a strong feeling about your career path, there are five basic specialized colleges you could consider:\n\n[00174] â¢ Art/music school: These are schools in the fine and performing arts. You may want to go to such a school if you are strongly interested in pursuing a career in the fine arts, such as painting, sculpting, music, or theater.\n\n[00175] â¢ Engineering/architectural school: If you know you want to be a computer scientist, electrical engineer, or architect, these are colleges that can prepare you well for those fields.\n\n[00176] â¢ Business school: You don't need to go to a business school just because you want to be a senior executive at a corporation someday. But if business is your passion, this type of school will specifically provide you with training in management, finance, accounting, and other business fields. [00177] â¢ Health sciences school: If you are interested in the health professions, such as dental hygiene, nursing, pharmacy, medical technology, etc., health science schools will provide you with specialized education for these careers. However, the best preparation for those wishing to become medical doctors would be to attend a small liberal arts college, or a small, medium, or large university with strong science programs.\n\n[00178] â¢ Military school: These schools prepare you for a career in the military,\n\nThe best-known are the federal service academies for the Army West Point), Navy,\n\n[00179] Air Force, and Coast Guard. But there are also several state-run and private four-year military schools. Upon graduation, you are commissioned as an officer, but serve in the military for a period of time. If you want a career as an officer in the military, a military school is an excellent choice.\n\n[00180] 6. Community college: Two-year community colleges (also called junior colleges) serve local residents and offer two-year associate's degree programs. They often enroll several thousand students, including a good number of working adults taking evening classes. In most cases, students attending a community college commute from home or work to school.\n\n[00181] If you're a C student, you may want to consider first attending a community college, and then transferring to a four-year school of your choice. It will be easier to succeed in a community college environment than in a large competitive four-year school. Community colleges have dedicated teachers who focus on students' needs, provide a very good education, and are also the least expensive type of school you could attend.\n\n[00182] Many community college students transfer to a four-year school after completing their associate's degree. State universities often have transfer agreements with local community colleges and automatically admit graduates who have completed their two- year program. Community college students do successfully transfer into the best schools in the country (see FIG. 21).\n\n[00183] In My College Finder, you will also find two additional lists: Top 21\n\nPublic Institutions and Top 21 Private Institutions. These \"Top 21\" Schools have the highest name recognition in the United States and abroad, and often have long and cherished histories. They generally have outstanding research faculty and facilities and a high caliber student body. They are mostly very difficult to get into. However, there are many schools not on these two lists that may offer an equal or better undergraduate education. [00184] SELECTIVITY: How tough are admissions and how good is the school at keeping its students?\n\n[00185] Believe it or not, except for the top 100 or so schools, all other colleges and universities accept more than 50% of applicants! Some schools even have open admissions-they are required by state law to admit all applying residents with a high school diploma. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those prestigious universities that admit only 1 out of 10 applicants - and will even reject some high school valedictorians! (Also, several specialized programs, such as in music, theater or film, can be even tougher to get into than the most competitive schools overall).\n\n[00186] Some schools do a much better job than others in taking care of and keeping the students they've admitted. Many schools that are difficult to get into lose a lot of students after their freshman year; sometimes a surprisingly small percentage of the entering class remains until graduation,\n\n[00187] My College Finder only includes four-year schools that have acceptable rates of keeping the students they admit. It also defines four levels of selectivity, a standard which indicates the level of admissions difficulty and how well a school keeps and graduates its students. Here are our four levels of selectivity (which are defined more precisely in the gray box below).\n\n[00188] â¢ Most selective schools: These schools have the highest entering class test scores and high school grades (mostly A's), the highest academic standards, and are the hardest to get into.\n\n[00189] â¢ Very selective schools: These schools are very competitive in the test scores of entering freshmen with a mixture of A's and B's in high school, have high academic standards, and are fairly tough to get into,\n\n[00190] â¢ Selective schools: These schools are competitive in entering class test scores with mostly B's and Cs in high school, have average academic standards, and are not too difficult to get into.\n\n[00191] â¢ Less selective schools: These are the least competitive schools. They accept the largest percent of applicants (if not nearly all), and their entering class test scores are in the lowest range. Just the same, you can get a quality college education at any of these schools because we include only those that do a good job keeping and graduating their students. [00192] IMPORTANT: Choose the competitive level that best suits you. You should take into account your high school record and standardized test scores, as well as whether you want to be at the top, middle, or bottom of your college freshman class.\n\n[00194] NOTE:\n\nOut of state student applying to a public institution must often meet higher admission requirements than in-state students. This is especially true of student applying to the more popular California public universities.\n\n[00195] Step 2\n\n[00196]\n\n[00197] View Your Three Choices\n\n{00198] Write down in the box below the choices made in Step 1 for the three key factors you want in a college. If you found it hard to make a choice in any category, give it your best shot.\n\n[00199] If your preferred school type is a two-year college, a specialized school\n\n(like a music school), or school with special characteristics (like a women's college), just write down your region and college type, but skip selectivity. My College Finder does not apply selectivity to these types. Historically black colleges and universities, business colleges, health science colleges, and military colleges are listed nationally, not by region.\n\n-My Choices\n\nMy preferred region: I\"\n\nMy preferred college type: * -Â»\n\nMy preferred school selectivity: \"\n\nV - i j t C\n\n[00200] NOTE:\n\nIf you want to chose a second region, college type, or selectivity level, the you can do so when you get to the box titled \"My Second Preliminary List of Schools\" on page 25. For now, just make a list with your first choices.\n\n[00201] Step 3\n\n[00202]\n\n[00203] Use My College Finder to Locate the Set of Colleges that Corresponds to\n\nYour Three Choices\n\n[00204] My College Finder is not a typical thick college directory you buy in a bookstore. It deliberately does not contain every school in America. But it does contain those schools that have been individually screened to meet certain standards as already defined.\n\n[00205] My College Finder not only categorizes schools according to the level of admissions difficulty, but also includes only those schools that have a proven track record for retaining a high percentage of their students from freshman to sophomore year. My College Finder also includes only those schools that meet our standards for graduation rates. These are schools where students are most likely to remain until they graduate (see the box on page 16).\n\n[00206] By only giving you lists of schools with good rates of keeping and graduating students, My College Finder helps you choose schools where you are most likely to succeed and earn a degree,\n\n[00207] How to use My College Finder\n\n[00208] The next three pages provide an index, with corresponding page numbers, of the 70 sets of schools in My College Finder. Find your set below by first identifying your desired region, then go to those pages in My College Finder that contain the list of schools matching your choices for type and school selectivity (from Step 2).\n\n[00209] * If you are interested in schools that are in more than one region, then you will need to do this twice. You will then have two sets of schools that match your preferences of type and selectivity, but differ in region.\n\n[00210] * Within each set, schools are listed by state in alphabetical order (see the map on page 9 that shows the states in each region).\n\n[00211] * Some specialized schools and schools with special characteristics are listed together by region (for example, Art/Music Colleges). Others are listed nationally (for example, Women's Colleges). Two-year colleges are listed by region and within each region by state and city in alphabetical order. Our lists of Top 21 Public and Private institutions are national and can be found at the end of the four-year college section in My College Finder. [00212] HINT: Once you have found your set in My College Finder, you can go directly to the state that you are most interested in.\n\n[00213]\n\n[00214] Step 4\n\n[00215]\n\n[00216] Create Your Preliminary List of Schools\n\n[00217]\n\n[00218] After you have located your set (or sets) of schools in My College Finder, review the list (or lists) of schools. Even though the list matches your three preferred choices of region, type, and selectivity, there may be schools you want to immediately rule out for various reasons (for example, because they're in states where you don't want to live, or are too far from home), In My College Finder, you will see three check boxes for \"yes, \"maybe'; and \"no\" next to your list of schools. Check off \"no\" next to those schools you are eliminating from consideration. For the rest, leave the \"yes\" and \"maybe\" boxes blank for now.\n\n[00219] In the gray box on the next page, write down all those schools that remain on the list (there's room for 20). Also, add any school you may have already had in mind - even if it's in a different region, of a different type or different selectivity level than the rest. Also, write down the state each school is located in, Once you're done, you will have completed your Preliminary List of Schools.\n\n[00220] My Preliminary List of Schools\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n14.\n\n[00221] My Second Preliminary List of Schools\n\n[00222] You may wish to do a second Preliminary List by repeating Steps 1 and 2- perhaps choosing a different type of school or region. You may want to choose a lower level of selectivity to make sure you have some \"safety\" schools.\n\n[00223] You've done it!\n\n[00224] You now have a Preliminary List of Schools. The next step is to shorten the Preliminary List and develop your Final List. To develop the Final List, you will need to obtain more information on each of the chosen schools in your Preliminary List. From Step 5 on, we show you how to narrow down your Preliminary List.\n\n[00225]\n\n[00226] Step 5 [002271\n\n[00228] Use My College Guidebook to Learn More About Your Schools\n\n[00229]\n\n[00230] Now it's time to learn a lot more about each of the schools on your\n\nPreliminary List. We recommend that you use My College Guidebook, a directory of important facts about each of the four-year schools listed in My College Finder, included on the CD that comes with this manual.* Guidebook information is given under standard headings on admissions, academics, and activities, among others, containing essential up-to- date facts that answer basic questions you'll have.\n\n[00231] My College Guidebook does not list two-year colleges. If you have any on your Preliminary List, the best bet to answer your basic questions is to go to the two-year college's Web site D listed in My College Finder or call the school and order its catalog.\n\n[00232] Questions that My College Guidebook answers:\n\n[00233] My College Guidebook provides the following information, when available, on the four-year schools listed in My College Finder. Note that the Guidebook lists colleges by state and alphabetically within a state. The Guidebook provides answers to the following questions, in order:\n\n[00234] Basic information:\n\n[00235] Is the school public or private?\n\n[00236] What is the setting: urban, suburban, rural? In or near what major city is it located?\n\n[00237] Students:\n\n[00238] How many undergraduates are there, both full-time and part-time? How many freshmen? What percent men and women? Are there graduate students as well?\n\n[00239] What is the campus make-up: what percent of students are from in-state versus out-of-state? What percent of the student population is minority and international?\n\n[00240] What religious affiliations are represented on campus?\n\n[00241] Admissions:\n\n[00242] How many students applied for admission versus how many were accepted? (This is one indicator of how selective a school is).\n\n[00243] What are the dates for regular admissions, and Early Decision or Early\n\nAction, if available? Does the school use rolling admissions?\n\n[00244] What is the application fee?\n\n[00245] Is the SAT or ACT required for admission?\n\n[00246] Are one or more SAT subject tests required?\n\n[00247] Do you have to write an essay as part of the admissions application?\n\n[00248] Is an interview required or recommended?\n\n[00249] How do my SAT/ ACT scores and high school grades compare to those of students accepted recently at this school? [00250] What is the minimum TOEFL test score required for international students?\n\n[00251] Note: the admissions process is discussed in detail in My College\n\nAdvisor\" Manual II, How to Succeed in the College Admissions Process.\n\n[00252] Activities:\n\n[00253] What activities are available on campus? For example, can you write for a student newspaper, or work for a campus radio or TV station? What sort of clubs are on campus? What opportunities are there to participate in the performing arts? Can you. join a volunteer group?\n\n[00254] Are there fraternities and sororities? What percent of students join in\n\nGreek life?\n\n[00255] How many intercollegiate and intramural sports are available?\n\n[00256] Academic:\n\n[00257] What percent of faculty members teach undergraduates?\n\n[00258] In what subjects is tutoring available (like writing or remedial math)?\n\n[00259] What majors does the school offer?\n\n[00260] What majors are the school's \"strongest\" academically?\n\n[00261] Which majors do the most students pursue?\n\n[00262] What options are there for \"special study\"? Here are some examples: a combined bachelor's/master's program; cross-registration at another nearby college; opportunity for double majors; honors programs; study abroad; teacher certification program; and ROTC,\n\n[00263] Housing:\n\n[00264] What kind of housing is available: Coed, single-sex? On-campus and off- campus? Married student housing?\n\n[00265] Are freshmen allowed to keep cars on campus?\n\n[00266] Annual Costs:\n\n[00267] What were the most recent tuition and fees? Room and board costs?\n\nBooks, supplies, transportation, and estimated personal expenses? [00268] Financial Aid:\n\n[00269] How many students applied for financial aid?\n\n[00270] How many students applying were awarded financial aid?\n\n[00271] . How many students actually received financial aid (that means they accepted the school's financial aid package)?\n\n[00272] What percent of admitted students had their average need met? How much was in gift aid, how much as self-help aid?\n\n[00273] Contact information:\n\n[00274] For your convenience, My College Guidehook gives you the address and phone number of the school's admissions office. The school Web site is given at the top of each listing. When viewing the Guidebook while connected to the Internet, the Web address for each school's homepage will be a live link. Just click on it to visit the school's homepage for further information.\n\n[00275]\n\n[00276] Step 6\n\n[00277]\n\n[00278] Narrow Down Your Preliminary List\n\n[00279] After finding answers to your questions about your schools in My College\n\nGuidebook, you're ready to narrow down your list.\n\n[00280] , Several sets contain only a small number of schools, so narrowing them down will be easy. But 27 sets in My College Finder have more than 15 schools each, so you will have to narrow those sets down.\n\n[00281] Go to My Preliminary List of Schools in Step 4 and cross out those schools that no longer interest you. Those are schools that you want to eliminate because they don't meet some of your important criteria.\n\n[00282]\n\n[00283] Step 7\n\n[00284]\n\n[00285] Get Answers Deeper Questions [00286] My College Guidebook can tell you a lot of the important basics about colleges. But you may need to get answers to some questions that aren't covered in it. Without answers to certain questions, you may not feel confident at this point to apply to some schools, no matter how good they look in the Guidebook.\n\n[00287] In the section below, we provide suggested questions in five different areas that you'll need to look beyond the Guidebook to answer. These areas are:\n\n[00288] The human side of college [00289] The living side of college [00290] Campus facilities and services [00291] The environment outside campus [00292] The learning side of college\n\n[00293] The key immediately below provides four different ways to find answers to your questions.\n\n[00294] Review the questions below and check the ones you want answered. Each question is followed by a symbol from the key, which will indicate the best place to go to obtain the information necessary to answer the question.\n\n[00295] 1. The human side of college\n\n[00296] When you choose a college, you're also choosing the kind of people who will be your peers, classmates, roommates, and friends. College campuses all have different personalities, just like people. You need to find out what a college's main student culture is. Here are some questions you can ask:\n\n100297] Dress: Do students dress \"preppy,\" \"grungy,\" \"gothic,\" \"retro,\" \"hip-hop,\"\n\n\"urban,\" or something else? V\n\n[00298] Music: Are they into alternative rock, punk rock, heavy metal, rap, or classical? V\n\n[00299] Political orientation: Is the campus ultra-liberal or conservative? Or are most students apathetic about politics? V\n\n[00300] Ambience: What's the general atmosphere on campus? Most have a \"vibe\" which you can feel. Is it intellectual? Artsy? Careerist? Jocks? V\n\n[00301] You may want to ask the school's admissions office about what happens to their graduates:\n\n[00302] What percentage of graduates get jobs in their fields? T\n\n[00303] What percentage of graduates go on to graduate and professional programs? T\n\n[00304] 2. The living side of college\n\n[00305] Going to college isn't just about taking classes â it's a life experience, The social life, campus activities, and sports are important. You'll want to know:\n\n[00306] What's the school's reputation for partying? Is there a lot of pressure to drink? To take drugs? V T\n\n[00307] Is political activism a major part of campus life? Some campus cultures encourage students to be politically active, others don't. V T\n\n[00308] Are there any volunteer service programs available on or near campus?T [00309] For intercollegiate sports, what's the GPA requirement of the team you're interested in? How many student athletes graduate with a degree? What support is available for athletes, both academic and financial? T\n\n[00310] 3. Campus facilities and services\n\n[00311] When you choose a college, you buy not only an education, but where you will live, eat, and sleep for four years (or more). The school will be your new home, so you may want to ask:\n\n[00312] Housing:\n\n[00313] How many roommates do you want? If you want a \"one-person\" room, does the school have them? V T\n\n[00314] How noisy are the dorms? Is there a curfew for visitation or lights out?\n\nDoes the music blare until 2 a.m.? V\n\n[00315] Is the university housing old or new? Clean or shoddy-looking? Spacious or cramped? Air-conditioned for hot weather? Poorly heated in the winter? Enough washers and dryers to do your clothes? V\n\n[00316] Is off-campus housing (where you can live usually only after your freshman year) plentiful or hard to find? V\n\n[00317] Dining options:\n\n[00318] What's the quality of food served? Are the dining hours short and inconvenient or acceptable? Are the dining facilities clean and pleasant? V\n\n[00319] What meal plans are available for freshmen? T W\n\n[00320] Does the school also have a food court for fast food, a mini-mart for basic necessities, and a coffee house? V T\n\n[00321] Are you allowed to cook in your dorm? Are there grocery or at least convenience stores nearby? V T 007/015H0\n\n[00322] Library:\n\n[00323] What are the library's regular hours? How late can you study there at night? Is there 24-hour study available during exam periods? W V\n\n[00324] Is the library spacious or cramped? Is it well-lighted or dingy? Is it dusty or is there a musty smell?

V\n\n[00326] Is the school's periodical collection sufficient for you? Does it subscribe to several full-text online databases so you can easily do a lot of research for papers? W V\n\n[00327] Is inter-library loan or borrowing privileges at a neighboring school available if you can't find a given book? W V T\n\n100328] Labs and studios:\n\n[00329] What's the quality of science equipment and facilities if you're thinking of majoring in biology, engineering, or industrial design? V\n\n[00330] In the fine, visual, and performing arts, are there good studios and other facilities, whether a kiln for ceramics, an editing studio for film or video, or piano practice rooms? V T\n\n[00331] Technology:\n\n[00332] Is the school well-wired for Internet access or barely so? Are dorms wired?\n\nDoes it have general use computer labs? Macs as well as PCs? Are some of the computers or printers in the labs broken? V T\n\n[00333] Are the personal computers available less than two-years old? V\n\n[00334] Are printers available in the computer labs? Can they handle the heavy printing load that students generate (are they network printers)? V T\n\n[00335] Is there a good range of software available in computer labs, like an office suite, e-mail program, and specialized programs for CAD, programming, and high-end graphics? V\n\n[00336] Career counseling: [00337] Does the school have a career counseling office? Do they really get involved in job placement for seniors or just tell students to check the bulletin boards? V T\n\n[00338] Are there job fairs? What companies recruit on campus, if any? V T\n\n[00339] Health services:\n\n[00340] Is there a student health center?

W V T\n\n[00343] Student support services:\n\n[00344] Is there a student support services office or another opportunity program on campus? T W\n\n[00345] If so, is a separate application required? Who is eligible? What is the application procedure? T\n\n[00346] Religious services:\n\n[00347] Is there a chapel on campus, or churches, mosques, synagogues, or temples nearby? W V T\n\n[00348] Is religious counseling available on campus?

V\n\n[00351] If you will commute, does the campus run out of parking spaces in the morning, even if you paid for one? V T\n\n[00352] What is the crime report from campus? How safe is it at night? Are there emergency phones around campus? Do dorms have 24-hour video surveillance? V T [00353] 4. The environment outside campus\n\n[00354] Whatever college or university you attend, the village, town, or city in which it is located is part of the picture you should consider.\n\n[00355] Is the neighborhood surrounding campus comparatively safe? Or is the school in a high-crime area? V\n\n[00356] Is there a decent college town off-campus with plenty of eating and entertainment establishments within walking distance? V\n\n[00357] What are the cultural and recreational opportunities in the surrounding area? W V\n\n[00358] 5. The learning side of college\n\n[00359] There are also some academic questions that you may need answered:\n\n[00360] How strong are the departments in the majors you are interested in? Are instructors well-qualified to teach the courses you would want to take for a given major? W V C\n\n[00361] Are you able to get the classes that you need to graduate in four years? Are most of the courses in the catalog offered every year or at least every other year? Courses listed in a catalog may not always be offered. To find out, it helps to compare the school catalog with the current and previous semester class schedules of course offerings. W V C T\n\n[00362] Are professors usually available to students outside class, or are they hard to get hold of? Do they really keep their office hours? V\n\n[00363] â Are the textbooks assigned too hard, too easy or just right? Is too much reading assigned by professors or is it manageable for you? On a campus visit, you can visit the bookstore and ask for some course syllabi from a department. V T\n\n[00364]\n\n[00365] Step 8\n\n[00366]\n\n[00367] Make Your Preliminary List Even Shorter\n\n[00368] By using the Web, the school catalog, and the phone, you should have been able to get answers to many of the questions you had in Step 7.\n\ni 45 [003691 Now, go to your Preliminary List on page 24 and cross out the schools you're no longer considering,\n\n[00370] As Step 7 showed, many questions are best answered by making campus visits. Visiting even one or two schools will help you develop a strong Final List,\n\n[00371] Now go to Step 9 where you will learn how to make the most of your campus visit. (If you are not able to visit, then go directly to the final step, Step 10.)\n\n[00372]\n\n[00373] Step 9\n\n[00374]\n\n[00375] Make Campus Visits: See for Yourself\n\n[00376] Your image of a campus through its Web site or viewbook may be totally changed (or be confirmed) when you see and explore a campus. See and hear things for yourself, talk with students, professors. Eat the cafeteria food. Stay overnight in a dorm. Walk around the neighborhood outside of campus. Most of all, imagine living on that campus and in those surroundings.\n\n[00377] It's best to take someone with you - a parent, brother, sister, or friend; another opinion always helps. Take the official tour, but also walk around on your own. If you visit on a weekday, be sure to stop by the admissions and financial aid offices. If you want, you can arrange for an interview by an admissions officer (see Manual II for more information). Avoid visiting on special weekends or the summer; when campus activity is not like it normally is.\n\n[00378] If you can only visit one or two schools on your Preliminary List, then go to those closest to where you live. Even visiting a nearby college where you don't intend to apply can still be beneficial because it gives you an idea what a college campus is like and how it differs from your high school environment.\n\n[00379] If visiting any of the schools on your Preliminary List is not possible, there are useful alternatives, such as making a virtual visit at the school's Web site, or sending for a school's free video or DVD (if available). They don't replace a campus visit (in the end, they're really just commercials), but do give you a feel for the school. If visits are out of the question, just proceed to Step 10. 100380] But, if you can do one or more visits, use the Campus Visit Checklist on the following page. Make copies of it, and fill it out each time you visit a school. Then refer to these records to help you create your Final List.\n\n[00381]\n\n100382] Step 10\n\n[00383]\n\n[00384] Create Your Final List\n\n[00385] Based on any campus visits you made, or other considerations you now have, go back to your Preliminary List of Schools and cross out the schools that no longer interest you.\n\n[00386] We recommend 5-8 schools as a Final List of colleges to apply to, but no more than 10.\n\n[00387] Now, copy the schools remaining on your Preliminary List onto My Final\n\nList of Schools at the end of this Step.\n\n[00388] Whether you have five or ten schools on your Final List, it's important to have one or more safety or sure thing schools on your list:\n\n[00389] A safety school is basically where you exceed all criteria for admission, including GPA, class rank, and test scores. It is a school which you feel almost certain would admit you, that is like a safety net in case more selective schools don't admit you. Be sure you would feel comfortable about going to your safety school.\n\n[00390] - A target or level school is where you would fit in as an average student.\n\nSome admitted students would have a higher GPA and test scores than you, others lower. You would have at least a 50-50 chance of being admitted to this kind of school.\n\n[00391] A reach school may be your first choice but is a long shot. We recommend your Final List include no more than two reach schools. Your chances of admission are far less likely. Your GPA and test scores will place you in the bottom one-third of your reach school.\n\n[00392] Remember you have to fit these categories to you.

This manual guides you step-by-step in successfully completing the admissions process, including:\n\n[00420] filling out your schools' admissions applications (\"apps\")\n\n[00421] writing a winning essay\n\n[00422] securing great college recommendations\n\n[00423] and, having successful interviews.\n\n[00424] I. The College Application\n\n[00425] Kinds of College Apps\n\n[00426] There are three kinds of college apps:\n\n[00427] 1. Each school's own admissions app (institutional app). You can only use it for that school, nowhere else.\n\n[00428] 2. The Common App (see below).\n\n[00429] 3. Statewide university apps (see below).\n\n[00430] We recommend you use the last two apps wherever possible.\n\n[00431] The Common Application:\n\n[00432] The Common App is accepted by hundreds of schools, mostly private, including many top schools. You can get a copy from your high school guidance office, or download and print out a paper version of the app from its Web site (see page 12 for the link). With the paper version, you fill it out once and send photocopies to each college that accepts it. Some schools, though, may ask you to fill out supplemental forms. If you're applying to six schools and four accept the Common App, you save a lot of time and effort by using it. Schools do not penalize you for using the Common App as long as they accept it. (See Appendix II, where we list all the schools that are members of the Common Application association for the 2005-2006 academic year).\n\n[00433] Statewide university apps: 007/015H0\n\n[00434] Several states allow you to use one form to apply to most or all of their public colleges and universities (after applying, an individual state school might ask you for more information).\n\n[00435] If several schools on your Final List are public schools in the same state, you may be able to fill out just one application for them all.\n\n[00436] The following state university systems allow you to use one application for several schools. You can also apply online to most of them. We provide, when available, the phone numbers to obtain their apps. The systems are listed by state in alphabetical order (see FIG. 23).\n\n[00437] HINT\n\n[00438] If you finish two years at a community college with the required minimum\n\nGPA, a number of state university systems guarantee your admission into their public four- year colleges. This way, you begin at an easier school and get your degree from a better school. (For a list of recommended two-year colleges see My College Finder).\n\n[00439] Applying Online and on Paper\n\n[00440] Online apps:\n\n[00441] (Skip this section if you plan to use a paper application)\n\n[00442] You can now apply online to many colleges and universities (essays included) and even pay the application fee online. This is becoming an increasingly popular way of applying because it's fast and easy. A school's Web site will tell you clearly if you can apply online, and if so, will link you to the appropriate page.\n\n[00443] More and more, students prefer to fill out the Common App online. It's interactive, easy to use and you are reaching several schools at once. Go to: http://app.commonapp.org.\n\n[00444] When filling it out, you can save your work so you can take a break and come back to complete the app later.\n\n[00445] You can apply online using the Common App to the schools that are officially members of the Common App association (277 schools, listed in Appendix II). There are many more schools that accept the Common App but are not members. Call a school's admissions office to see if they will accept it and if supplemental forms are also 7 015110\n\nrequired. Then send them the paper Common App (which you can obtain from your high school guidance office or download and print out - see the next page for how).\n\n[00446] You can also go to \"one-stop online college application\" Web sites and apply online to the schools of your choice. These sites have links to school web sites and admissions office e-mail addresses:\n\nOne-Stop Online College Admissions Apps\n\nCollegeboard.com www.colleqeboard.com /article/0,3868,5-25-0-\n\n27012, 00. html\n\nCollegeNet.com http: / /cnsearch.colleqenet.com/cqi- bin/APPLY/index\n\nPrinceton Review wwvtf.princetonreview.com /college/default. asp\n\nXap.com www.xap.com /apply\n\nDownloadable apps:\n\n[00447] Even if you can't apply online, many more schools enable you to download and print out their regular application from their Web sites, which saves you the trouble and time of having it mailed to you from the school. When printed out, downloaded application forms are the same as the ones you would get from the schools.\n\n[00448] You can also download a copy of the Common App at: http://app.commonapp.org/index.cfm? APP= AppOnline&ACT=Display&DSP=Forms\n\n[00449] Be sure you download not only the Common App, but also the other forms listed on that page (most are separate PDF downloads).\n\n[00450] Getting paper apps:\n\n[00451] If a school doesn't let you apply online or download their application form\n\n(which is increasingly unlikely nowadays), you must request the regular paper application from the school. Here are several ways to do that:\n\n[00452] 1. Call the school's admissions office (they will usually send you their view book and other materials as well).\n\n[00453] 2. Fill out an application request form online, if available, on the school's\n\nWeb site. [00454] 3. Send an application request by e-mail if the school's Web site gives you the e-mail address of the admissions office.\n\n(00455J 4. Send a letter or postcard by regular mail to the school's admission office requesting the application.\n\n100456] We advise that you call the school to be sure they received your Common\n\nApp, whether online or by mail. You should especially do this if you don't receive a confirmation e-mail from the school a few days after submitting the Common App.\n\n[00457] Parts of the College App.\n\n[00458] College apps differ and some are longer than others- but they are very similar in the basic information they ask. The most important advice we give is to take the directions on the apps seriously and follow them carefully!\n\n[00459] Filling out a college app is not hard, but does take some thought and care.\n\nWe'll use the Common Application as our example. Even if you won't or can't use the Common App for your schools, most of the questions will be very similar.\n\n[00460] Before you start filling out any college app, make several photocopies of the app (or print extra copies). Fill out one or two rough drafts using the copies. Make sure what you put on the final app is just the way you want it. It is important to keep the final application neat and clean. Do not cross out anything on the final app.\n\n[00461] FIGS. 24-33 provide sample illustrations of how two students completed the first several pages of the 2005-2006 Common Application. The Common Application will be very similar from year to year. Look carefully at how they are filled out. The girl is an honors student while the boy is an average student who still makes a strong case for acceptance to his chosen college. We also give an essay written by the male student for one school's supplement to the Common Application. See Appendix 1 for tips on filling out the Common Application.\n\n[00462]\n\n[00463] Supplementary material, etc.:\n\n[00464] For many schools, you can submit more than just the college application when applying. If you wrote for a student newspaper, enclose a few clippings of your best stuff. If you programmed a new computer game as a hobby, send them a CD of what you did. But keep in mind, some schools are not happy to get material they didn't ask for. Before sending extra things, call the admissions office to see if they would accept specific supplemental material.\n\n[004651 If you are applying to a specialized school, you may be required to send in tapes of your music, a portfolio of your artwork, or a video of your theater performances or a film you made. If the school's application doesn't clearly say so, call the admissions office to check what you must submit.\n\n100466] Also, for programs in music or drama, you will be very likely to be asked to come in for an audition in addition to submitting your app.\n\nNOTE:\n\nWe strongly recommend that you get the most up-to-date info from each school's web site. Colleges and universities frequently change their admissions requirements and procedures.\n\n7 015110\n\n[00467] Kinds of Admissions Plans\n\n[00468] There are four kinds of college admissions plans. You should be aware of the differences.\n\n[00469] 1. Regular admissions\n\n[00470] 2. Early admissions: Early Decision, Early Action, and Early Action\n\nSingle Choice (EASC)\n\n[00471] 3. Rolling admissions\n\n[00472] 4. Deferred admissions\n\n[00473] Regular admissions:\n\n[00474] In regular admissions, the deadline to submit your application can be from\n\nDecember 15 to May 1. You can apply to as many other schools as you want. Most colleges will notify you of their decisions by April 1 ; financial aid decisions usually come a little later. Once all these decisions are in, you choose which school to attend, usually by May 1 , and notify the others that you won't attend.\n\n[00475] Among your Final List of Schools, the deadlines will probably vary. What would be on time for one school, will be late for another, so always be aware of each school's application deadline. Fill in each school's application deadline on the form on page 30 to help remind you.\n\n[00476] Early admissions:\n\n[00477] Ab"
