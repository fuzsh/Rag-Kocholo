Well, I hear you, but also, if you pay attention to any of these days we mark on social media, I hope it's this one. I hope today is the day you give to organizations that support women and girls. It matters. Here is why: Being female is the quickest path to poverty in the U.S. Just BEING FEMALE. Being a single mom simply amplifies the likelihood. But there is hope: By investing in women, you pave the way for a stronger economy for us all. From the Gates Foundation in the Economist - https://lnkd.in/gjYzKp-n “Decades of research have shown that when women can fully participate in economies, it increases financial stability for their households, helps families recover more quickly from shocks and supports a country’s resilience. The data show a correlation between women’s economic agency and reduced poverty, and experts consider such agency essential to food security. What’s more, it fuels growth: new figures from Eurasia Group indicate that if policymakers prioritised investments in women’s economic power, the global economy could grow by an additional 7%, or $10trn, by 2030.” That means that investing in women and girls isn't just about being a good person, or helping women and girls out of the kindness of your heart — it's a strategic investment in our collective futures. Why wouldn’t we want women to have more access to money as women make the majority of household purchases (big and small). Today is about action. Make today the day you invest in women and girls, and in turn all of us. And thank you to all of the businesses and people who already realized this is a good investment and have joined the Working for Women community. To name a few with presence here on Linked In.
