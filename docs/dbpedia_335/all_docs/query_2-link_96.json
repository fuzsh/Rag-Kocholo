It is something we are not trained to do at all under any circumstance.”\n\nOfficers never want to use force in detaining a suspect, but sometimes have to, Roke said.\n\n“The best thing that could happen is if people comply. The best thing would be if they just sat in the car, but that’s not always the case,” Roke said.\n\nPlains Twp. police Chief Dale Binker said chokeholds have never been a part of his training.\n\n“You use the necessary force to make a lawful arrest, but that is not a tactic we’re trained in,” Binker said.\n\nEdwardsville police Sgt. Hal Bond said sometimes it’s difficult to subdue a suspect and even stun guns don’t always work. Yet still, neck restraints are not acceptable, he said.\n\n“You have to use enough force to overcome the resistance, but a chokehold isn’t necessary. We have other means,” Bond said\n\nFormer Wilkes-Barre police Chief William Barrett, a Wilkes-Barre councilman who recently was appointed to the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission, said he’s never seen neck restraints written into a use of force policy “anywhere.”\n\n“It’s not part of any training. It’s not part of any use of force training or defensive tactics,” Barrett said. “It’s never been taught as part of any take-down tactic. People are taught to take individuals down for their safety and for that of the individual.”\n\n6/12/2020\n\nLocal police struggling to fill out their ranks\n\nbkalinowski@citizensvoice.com\n\nEven prior to the civil unrest due to the police killing of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis, local police departments had been struggling to fill their ranks.\n\nIt’s only gotten harder, local police officials say.\n\nIn Nanticoke, for example, the department is advertising for full-time openings and has yet to get an applicant leading up to Monday’s deadline to apply.\n\nNanticoke police Chief Mike Roke said he and top officials in the department recently went on a “recruiting” mission around the county seeking out some part-time officers who are hoping to get a break with a full-time job.\n\nThey learned there’s few officers available to apply.\n\n“We are putting out feelers — do any of your part-time guys want a job? Come see us,” Roke said. “You know what? Every chief up the line told me the same thing. Join the club. We have the same problem.”\n\nAfter an aggressive advertising campaign, eight officers came to pick up an application packet at Nanticoke’s police station, but as of Thursday none have been returned. The application is due by 4 p.m. Monday. Those who apply will be tested and screened to possibly become part of the civil service commission hiring list.\n\nIn recent months, Nanticoke’s force lost two full-time officers after Roke was promoted to chief and Capt. Robert Lehman left to be a Luzerne County detective. It’s not immediately clear if both spots will be filled from the list of upcoming applicants, but at least one will be, city officials said.\n\nWhile it’s a tough job, a small city like Nanticoke can offer a new full-time officer around $70,000 a year, full medical benefits, generous numbers of paid days off and a retirement pension, Roke said. Yet, it’s still hard to hire cops in this day in age, he said.\n\n“Certainly, the recent events aren’t going to help. A lot of factors come into play, like the education and time that it takes to go into the police academy,” Roke said.\n\nThose wishing to become a police officer must pay to attend the Act 120 academy themselves with no guarantee of a job afterward, Roke said.\n\nThe increased scrutiny of police officers and unwarranted negative attitude toward cops also plays a role, he said.\n\n“It’s definitely thinned the herd of potential applicants. They aren’t pumping out the recruits like they used to. Maybe people don’t want these types of jobs,” Roke said.\n\nThe Lackawanna College Police Academy, the region’s Act 120 training school for police officers, graduated 511 people between January 2014 to December 2019, according to college spokeswoman Sharon Lynett.\n\n“We had to pause our program due to the coronavirus pandemic, but we currently have 33 cadets enrolled. We are able to start a new class beginning June 24, 2020, and have 22 enrolled students and expect that number to increase,” Lynett said.\n\nSeveral top police officials in the area say those class numbers are down from when they entered the academy.\n\nRoke said one of the departments Nanticoke police visited on recruiting trips was Edwardsville police. Edwardsville police told them they didn’t have anyone available to apply.\n\n“They wanted to know if we had any part timers,” Edwardsville Sgt. Hal Bond said. “All of our part-time cops are full-time cops in other towns, believe it or not, and one is a full-time firefighter.”\n\nBond said Edwardsville, which has no full-time positions open currently, is also struggling to fill part-time positions.\n\n“We are getting no applications for part-time anymore. One here, one there. It’s tough,” Bond said.\n\nBond noted when he first applied in Edwardsville in the 1990s, there were 40 applicants. For the most recent test, there were seven applicants, he said.\n\nKingston police Chief Rich Kotchik said nearly 100 people took Kingston’s test when he applied in 1998. Only seven people took Kingston’s most recent test. The active civil service list is expiring soon, so Kingston will be testing soon in coming months, he said.\n\n“The problem is right now nobody wants to be a police officer. It’s because of how the public looks at police officers. A lot of the younger generation think it’s a thankless job. There are people who still do it, but it’s not like it used to be,” Kotchik said. “If you’re looking at what’s going on, you might say, ‘Why would I want to go in that field?’ You don’t get treated well and there’s a lack of respect.”\n\nFormer Wilkes-Barre police Chief William Barrett, a Wilkes-Barre councilman who recently was recently appointed to the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission, said the vast majority of police officers are good and their reputations are being tarnished by “the actions of a very few.”\n\nThe “negative publicity” about police is sure to lead to less people wanting to do the job, he said.\n\n“Most do their jobs and do them well. Unfortunately, someone comes along and does something blatantly wrong and it reflects on the entire profession,” Barrett said. “Maybe some people wonder why they would even want to get involved.”\n\n6/10/2020\n\nSafety patrol work earns Greater Nanticoke Area student award\n\nmguydish@timesleader.com\n\nNANTICOKE — It may be hard to believe, but the organization behind those iconic (at least for some) brightly-colored shoulder belts with AAA Safety Patrol badges turned 100 this year.\n\nOld timers may remember orange belts, or even white ones before that. These days they lean toward fluorescent lime (or chartreuse, maybe, depending on your tastes).\n\nAnd this year when AAA Mid-Atlantic picked winners of its “Outstanding School Safety Patrol Students, only one local student received the honor, according to the organization: Kiele Maday, a fifth-grader from Greater Nanticoke Area’s Elementary Center.\n\nThe honor earns more than a plaque, which Maday received during a Zoom call with representatives from AAA Mid-Atlantic, her principal and safety patrol advisor. She also got a Visa Gift Card.\n\n“Maday is described as determined with a great work ethic,” according to a media release. “She always exceeds expectations with each task that is asked of her and consistently places the needs of her peers and teachers in front of her own to truly embody the meaning of an outstanding safety patrol.\n\nMaday works with the “morning helper crew,” assisting kindergarten students with morning routines. She splits her school commute with a bus ride in the morning — where she assumes the duties of safety patroller — and rides a car in the afternoon, according to the release. At least, that’s how she used to do it.\n\n“This year, Maday realized the need for her presence on the bus in the afternoon due to the limited number of patrollers available and volunteered to ride the bus home even though her ride is the longest in the district.”\n\nAnd lest you think the AAA safety patrol program has gotten a little old fashioned after a century, AAA Mid-Atlantic notes more than 1,400 students participated in the program in nearly 70 area elementary schools. “It is the largest school-based safety program in the world with more than 679,000 patrollers in 35,000 schools across North America and 30 countries.”\n\nThose who may have actually strapped on the belt and badge decades ago may recall doing things like standing at a corner near the school and holding both arms out to stop students from crossing the street until no cars were in site. The basic idea hasn’t changed. The goal is to offer one of their own to help fellow students learn and follow traffic and bus safety.\n\nAs the release notes, “AAA School Safety Patrols direct children, not traffic. As school-age leaders in traffic safety, patrol members teach other students about traffic safety on a peer-to-peer basis. They also serve as role models for younger children.\n\n“Patrols complete training in traffic safety so they can protect students from the hazards of crossing roads and highways on their way to and from school; assist bus drivers in safely transporting students to and from school; teach fellow students about traffic safety; and serve other leadership functions under the direction of school officials.”\n\nOK, the arms are up, stop here.\n\n6/6/20\n\nNanticoke barber defies Wolf’s order\n\njhalpin@citizensvoice.com\n\nThe owner of a Nanticoke barber shop opened his doors to customers Friday in defiance of Gov. Tom Wolf’s order banning such businesses from reopening during the yellow phase of his coronavirus recovery plan.\n\nJason Croughn, owner of Croughn’s Cuts at 1 W. Broad St., said he decided to open up after seeing Wolf marching in a large Black Lives Matter demonstration earlier in the week.\n\n“I see signs in the background: ‘Blue Lives Murder,’ ‘Kill Cops,’ and he’s congregating with these people,” Croughn said. “No. 1, he’s in the yellow phase in Dauphin County, in Harrisburg, and he’s not supposed to be with anybody where there’s 25 or more people indoors or outdoors. So he’s breaking his own law. And I’m sitting here suffering? No way. That’s it. I was done.”\n\nThe imagery of Wolf’s march was even more upsetting to Croughn because many of his customers are correctional officers and police officers, he said.\n\n“Their lives matter too,” Croughn said. “I have a problem with that.”\n\nCroughn said times have been tight for his business during the lockdown. He received a government stimulus check and applied for unemployment benefits, although he has not received them, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, rent and utility bills have been piling up, he said.\n\n“Enough’s enough,” he said.\n\nSo at 11:30 a.m. Friday, Croughn opened his doors to customers, who were allowed in one at a time. He described business Friday as steady, with customers waiting outside for their turn.\n\n“Word got out and then people showed up,” he said.\n\nSeveral other Luzerne County businesses have flouted or defied Wolf’s closure order and been cited for violating the Disease Prevention and Control Act of 1955.\n\nNanticoke Police Chief Mike Roke said police cited Croughn on Friday afternoon for violating the administrative code and will continue doing so if he continues to open.\n\n“He stated his intentions are to continue to be open with the exception of Sunday,” Roke said. As long as the governor’s order is in effect, we are going to cite him on a daily basis.”\n\nCroughn said he had been aware of the possibility that he could be fined for opening but said he was willing to take his chances.\n\n“I’ll just have to do what I have to do,” Croughn said.\n\n5/25/2020\n\nBoy Scouts commemorate Memorial Day by replacing flags at veterans’ graves\n\nbkalinowski@citizensvoice.com\n\nBoy Scouts Troop 418 in Nanticoke halted all activities months ago due to the coronavirus shutdown, but with Memorial Day approaching there was one duty they could not neglect: replacing and retiring flags at veterans’ graves around the city.\n\nWearing masks while social distancing, the Scouts last week resumed their civic service by trekking through cemeteries to replace nearly 4,000 American flags.\n\n“The boys are honoring our veterans — from the Spanish-American War to the Iraq war and current conflicts around the world,” said Scoutmaster Matt Matyas. “Despite the fact we have COVID to deal with, we’re trying to teach these boys that these men and women went through a lot and some paid the ultimate sacrifice for us.”\n\nMatyas said all Scouting activity has stopped due to the coronavirus lockdown, including important Eagle Scout projects.\n\nBut replacing flags prior to Memorial Day is one of the Scouts’ mandatory projects and continued to be necessary despite the coronavirus shutdown, Matyas said.\n\nAll 21 Scouts in Troop 418 participated in last week’s flag-replacing project.\n\n“This is the most important thing we do all year,” Matyas said.\n\nNationwide, the Veterans Administration this year prohibited the Boy Scouts from replacing flags at national cemeteries because of the pandemic, instead relying on VA staff to perform the task.\n\nMatyas said the regional chapter of the Boy Scouts allowed area troops to replace flags in local cemeteries, as long as they practiced social distancing.\n\nUsually, the Nanticoke Scouts operate in a big group to replace the flags in a series of eight cemeteries off Washington Street in the city and the Holy Trinity Cemetery in Newport Twp.\n\nThis year, they were asked to bring family members along, so most Scouts performed the task with people who they live with, Matyas said.\n\nThomas Kane, representing the Nanticoke American Legion Post 350, which sponsors the Nanticoke Scouts, said there was some concern the Boy Scouts wouldn’t be able to replace the flags this year. But he wasn’t worried.\n\n“We’re so glad the Boy Scouts are doing what they are doing,” Kane said. “I had people calling me, saying, ‘If the Boys Scouts can’t do it, I will.’ So they were going to get put up either way.”\n\nOne of the Scouts, Paul Cooper, 16, said he is always proud to replace the flags.\n\n“It’s a great thing to do — get all the old flags out and put up new ones in remembrance for what they did for us and what they did for our county,” Cooper said.\n\nDenise Williams of Wanamie accompanied her 11-year-old son, Brandon, on the mission.\n\n“We have our masks. We are social distancing,” Williams said. “This is a good thing to do for the veterans. As you could see, the flags are in bad shape.”\n\nAfter the Scouts collected all the old flags, they put them in a huge pile and performed a dignified retirement ceremony by lighting them on fire with the help of the Nanticoke Fire Department. The Scouts saluted as the pile burned.\n\nAs the pile smoldered, Matyas dismissed them and made a joke about finally seeing everyone for the first time in weeks, though everyone was wearing masks.\n\n“It was good seeing half your faces today,” Matyas joked. “It’s been awhile.”\n\n5/23/2020\n\nThe Greater Nanticoke Area community recently honored the GNA Senior Class of 2020. On Friday, May 15, members of the Nanticoke City Fire Department, Nanticoke City Police Department, Mayor Kevin Coughlin, Nanticoke/Newport Township Fire Police, and the GNA High School Administration coordinated and assisted in the raising of a banner on Nanticoke’s East Main Street to recognize the graduating seniors. From left, are Mayor Kevin Coughlin, Police Chief Mike Roke, Fred Kraft, fire police; Tyler Park, Amy Scibek, principal; Dave Park, Len Paczkowski, fire police; Dave Wojciechowicz, firefighter; Fire Chief Kevin Hazleton, Eric Speece, assistant principal; Brian Zegarski, firefighter; Deputy Chief Tom Sadowski, and Captain Mark Boncal.\n\n5/17/2020\n\nLuzerne County engineer explains why weight limit is required on Nanticoke/West Nanticoke bridge\n\njandes@timesleader.com\n\nTwo concerns prompted officials to impose a new 15-ton weight limit on the Luzerne County-owned Nanticoke/West Nanticoke Bridge over the Susquehanna River, county Engineer Lawrence Plesh said Sunday.\n\nThe first involves bridge components known as bearings that are designed to absorb pressure and vibrations from vehicles crossing the span, Plesh said.\n\nAn inspection concluded the bearings are not “moving with the bridge” the full extent required, putting more stress on other components, Plesh said.\n\n“The bearings are not completely functioning properly,” Plesh said.\n\nThe second issue relates to pins that secure eye bars. Some of the pins are now less than the recommended diameter due to rust and other conditions, he said.\n\n“There’s a lot of force on those pins. If a pin snaps, that truss is useless,” he said.\n\nHe stressed that the bridge, which is a combination concrete and steel crossing, still meets safety requirements. The weight limit imposed by the county and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is designed to reduce further damage until the county can figure out what repairs will cost and identify funding, he said.\n\n“It’s not going to fall in the water,” he said of the span. “We’re trying to be proactive and cautious.”\n\nThe problems with the 2,072-foot bridge, which links Nanticoke and Plymouth Township, were discovered during a state grant-funded study of the structure to identify needed rehabilitation work, he said.\n\nPlesh said a bid should be released next month to determine what it will cost to fix strip seals on top of the bearings and further examine and replace worn pins.\n\nBased on preliminary estimates, the work could cost several million dollars, he said.\n\n“It’s going to cost a lot of money, so I need to know how much,” Plesh said. “The county doesn’t have that kind of money.”\n\nThe state may be willing to help fund the project, but that option is “problematic” because the state would have to postpone another planned project elsewhere in its roster to free up the funds for this one, he said.\n\nBecause it will take time to round up funding and complete the actual work, the weight limit will allow the county to keep the bridge operational, he said.\n\nVehicles weighing more than 15 tons should use the Route 29 bridge as an alternate route to cross the Susquehanna, he said.\n\nExamples of vehicles over 15 tons would be tri-axle trucks carrying loads, fire ladder trucks and tractor trailers, he said.\n\nSchool buses “should probably be OK” to use the span, although he said further review is required to confirm that.\n\nDue to safety concerns, ladder trucks would be able to cross the bridge in emergencies if crews are able to block other motorists on both sides from using the span until the fire vehicle has crossed, he said.\n\nPlesh anticipates some complaints about the inconvenience but said it would be more troublesome to accelerate damage and temporarily have no bridge available to any motorists.\n\nSigns announcing the new weight limits should be installed early this week, he said.\n\nReplacing the bridge instead of investing in repairs has been raised as an option, but Plesh said a new span at that site could cost $20 million or more.\n\nCounty officials estimated over a decade ago that the Nanticoke/West Nanticoke Bridge would cost at least $25 million to replace.\n\nThe Nanticoke/West Nanticoke Bridge is among 80 county-owned bridges that are eligible for federal and state bridge funding because they span more than 20 feet.\n\nBut it can take years to get a new bridge on the state plan, and several more years to complete the design and finish construction due to government specifications and requirements, Plesh has said.\n\n5/17/2020\n\nNanticoke Area considers 2 options for graduation\n\nBob Kalinowski – Citizens Voice\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area High School officials are considering two options for graduation, which will be held 6 p.m. July 24, Superintendent Ronald Grevera said.\n\nThe type of ceremony depends on what coronavirus restriction level the county remains under at the time.\n\nThe first option is a “traditional graduation ceremony” at the school’s sports stadium with strict social distancing recommendations in place based on recommendations by the state and the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Graduates would only be allowed two guests for the commencement ceremony.\n\nThe second option would be a parade on campus. Students would receive their diplomas by stepping outside of their vehicle in the front of the high school.\n\n“We remain hopeful to be able to provide our students with a dignified graduation ceremony that recognizes all of their accomplishments,” Grevera said. “Personally, I hope the state and local government will approve the first option because our graduates deserve it but health and safety comes first.”\n\nOn Friday, the Nanticoke Fire Department hung a banner over East Main Street in the city in honor of the Class of 2020.\n\n5/17/2020\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area looking at 2 graduation options, passes budget with no tax hike\n\nmguydish@timesleader.com\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area passed a “proposed final budget” Thursday with no property tax hike but also with a $1.5 million shortfall that must be resolved by the end of June. After the meeting, Superintendent Ron Grevera also briefly explained the two graduation ceremony options under consideration for July 24.\n\nThe budget sets spending at $32.5 million and property tax at 11.9113 mills. A mill is a $1 tax on every $1,000 of assessed property value. After the meeting, Grevera said via email that the budget has a $1.5 million deficit and “we will be working hard to close the gap between now and the June meeting.” By state law, school districts must pass a balanced budget by June 30.\n\nGrevera also said the budget assumes no increase in state money, noting the district gets about 60 percent of its funding from the state. The state is grappling with a huge deficit created by responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, casting all budgeting into uncertainty. Gov. Tom Wolf’s proposed budget released in February did include increases for public education, but that was prior to the pandemic.\n\nGrevera also said in his email that graduation is set for July 24 at 6 p.m. on the Nanticoke Campus. “Depending on the level that the county is under at that time, we are looking at two options. The first option is a traditional graduation ceremony at the stadium with strict social distancing guidelines based on CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and state recommendations. Graduates will only be allowed two guests for the commencement ceremony.\n\n“The second option will be a parade on campus. Students will receive their diplomas by stepping outside of their vehicle in the front of the high school,” Grevera wrote. “Personally, I hope the state and local government will approve the first option because our graduates deserve it but health and safety comes first!”\n\nDuring the meeting, the board granted approval for the Luzerne County Bureau of Elections to use the High School gym on June 1, 2 and 3 for in-person voting. The county has sought to set up polling places at area schools, reversing a long-standing policy in most districts of not allowing such use. While schools were common sites for voting in the past, safety concerns prompted many districts to stop the practice because students were often in the schools on election day.That’s not a problem this year because Wolf has ordered schools closed through June.\n\nAnd the board awarded a contract to Northeast Counseling Services for a Student Assistance Program Worker for the 2020-21 school year, at a cost of $40,000. Grevera said the money is from a Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency Grant, and that the person will provide a range of mental health services to students dealing with things like anger management, social skills or parental and family issues.\n\n5/16/2020\n\nNanticoke/West Nanticoke Bridge posted for 15 tons\n\nTimes Leader News\n\nThe Nanticoke/West Nanticoke Bridge carrying Broadway Street over the Susquehanna River, also known as Luzerne County Bridge No. 2, BMS # 40-7302-0204-0002, is now posted for 15 tons as directed by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Luzerne County, a notice released Friday by County Engineer Larry Plesh stated. Vehicles weighing in excess of 15 tons should use the SR 0029 Bridge as an alternate route, he added.\n\n5/13/2020\n\nScholastic Superstars 2020: Andrew Stratton\n\nAndrew Stratton\n\nQ.

Everybody is looking for an outlet. What better than to spend some time with a lot of music,” said Joe Nalepa, singer for the Rhythm and Booze duo.\n\nHe said all the bands involved are Nanticoke-based or have Nanticoke roots, so they’ve often played during the same events over the years.\n\n“It’s neat. It has a little Nanticoke feel to it,” Nalepa said. “We love going out and entertaining and we are going a little stir crazy, too.”\n\nThe schedule of performers is: 5 to 6 p.m., Mellifluous Duo; 6 to 7 p.m., Rhythm and Booze; 7 to 8 p.m., Doug and Sean; and 8 to 9 p.m., Gone Crazy.\n\nDuring the performances, the bands will encourage people to go to the Valley with a Heart organization’s website to raise money. There is a “Donate now” link. The performers have set a goal of $2,020 in donations for the evening.\n\nValley with a Heart is a charitable organization that donates thousands of dollars each year to sick children of the region. Much of the money is raised from its annual motorcycle ride and day-long concert every Labor Day weekend — an event that is in jeopardy this year.\n\nRick Temarantz, the president of the organization, said he was moved by the surprise offer.\n\n“I think it’s a great idea,” Temarantz said. “Anything that could help us, since we help others.”\n\n5/3/2020\n\nPandemic plays havoc with school budgets\n\nmbuffer@citizensvoice.com\n\n​\n\nThe school closure that began March 16 in Pennsylvania is expected to reduce some costs in the current budget year, but the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in big revenue losses in 2020-21.\n\n“Most school districts are looking at no increases in revenue from federal, state and local resources,” Lake-Lehman School District Superintendent James McGovern said. “People are financially hurting. This is evident as the demands in food distribution steadily increases. In cases such as this, districts can expect a shortfall in revenue collection percentage. This may become fiscally more volatile than 2008.”\n\nThe last economic recession in the U.S. was in 2008, and McGovern said revenue projections for 2020-21 are looking “bleak at best.” A major concern is a potential $2 billion shortfall in education funding, McGovern said.\n\nThe House State Government Committee approved a bill to freeze school district property taxes next year. School districts statewide collect about $18 billion in total local revenue, and the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials is projecting a loss of 4% to 5% in total local revenue due to the pandemic and economic struggles.\n\nSchool boards are required to propose 2020-21 budgets by the end of May and adopt final budgets by the end of June. The state Legislature allocates education funds to school districts in the annual state budget, which also is required to be adopted by the end of June.\n\nThe Dallas School Board has already proposed its budget for the next school year, and it would not increase the property tax rate. The proposed budget would allocate nearly $42.6 million, and the district can now spend nearly $2.2 million that had been reserved for capital projects on operational expenses.\n\nDallas could also end up saving $600,000 in operating costs this budget year because of the closure, Business Manager Grant Palfey said.\n\nSporting event cancellations and reduced utility costs are expected to lower spending this year, but that amount will be significantly less than “predicted shortfalls in the state budget,” Dallas Superintendent Thomas Duffy said.\n\n“The rippling economic impact of the pandemic has the potential to significantly negatively affect revenue for school districts, and we evaluate those potentials very closely,” Duffy said.\n\nThe Crestwood School Board held a virtual meeting on its budget Wednesday. Officials reviewed projected savings in the current budget.\n\nThe athletics budget is $125,517, and expenditures were at $106,739. Savings in athletics will come from reduced transportation costs, Business Manager Peter Bard said.\n\nThe maintenance budget is nearly $1.1 million, and expenditures were at $805,728. A factor there is reducing the temperature on thermostats due to building beings closed, Bard said.\n\nThe technology budget is $571,362, and expenditures were at $419,657. The district has transferred $100,000 to buy Chromebooks for students who need them to participate in online remote instruction.\n\nA reason that savings from the closure are not more significant is Gov. Tom Wolf signed into law Act 13 of 2020 on March 27. Act 13 significantly revised the Pennsylvania Public School Code and added a new section — “Pandemic of 2020” — to addresses a variety of issues involving the pandemic.\n\nThe law says employees of school entities who were employed as of March 13 must continue to receive the same compensation they would receive had the pandemic not occurred. Act 13 “guaranteed school employees payment as if school never closed,” Pittston Area Superintendent Kevin Booth said.\n\nThe law also assures that contractors’ fixed, personnel, administrative, and equipment costs are maintained during the school closure, and school districts can negotiate interim agreements or contract amendments to pay school bus contractors.\n\nThe Wilkes-Barre Area School District expects to save $75,000 a month due to a renegotiated contract with its primary transportation provider. The transportation contract was adjusted to only pay up to 82% of the original contract, and the pay adjustment takes into account a two-week period the district was closed, Superintendent Brian Costello said.\n\nSavings from the closure in Northwest Area have been “minimal at best,” and the district has had added costs during the closure, Superintendent Joseph Long said. The new costs are from distance learning, the development of packet production, repairs on Chromebooks, the purchase of technology infrastructure to increase WiFi power, and the state did not provide the district with a Continuity of Education and Equity Grant to help cover those costs, Long said.\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area is “in the process of figuring out savings from the closure” and expects “minimal savings” from lower utility costs, Superintendent Ronald Grevera said.\n\nThe district will see some savings in transportation because smaller transporters laid off employees and allowed them to receive unemployment compensation, Grevera said. But that also results in a reduction of reimbursement funding from the state, Grevera added.\n\nThe district may have savings from a reduction in payments to coaches of spring sports teams, Grevera said.\n\n“In order for our coaches to be paid, they must complete a minimum of 75% of the season, so I don’t see coaches getting paid for the spring season other than maybe a minimal amount, but we haven’t made any final decisions on paying of coaches yet,” Grevera said.\n\n5/3/2020\n\nDJ helps cheer up nursing home residents\n\ndallabaugh@citizensvoice.com\n\nA local DJ joined the owner of Pizza Bella restaurants and members of Cross Creek Community Church in Trucksville on Saturday to cheer up residents and employees at Birchwood Nursing and Rehabilitation Center.\n\nDonnie Evans, who owns DJ Donnie Evans Entertainment, played inspiring tunes outside the Nanticoke nursing home during the COVID-19 shutdown.\n\n“It gives people some spirit and some hope,” Evans said.\n\nAs the music played loudly outside, Danny Claherty, who owns Pizza Bella restaurants in Ashley, Nanticoke, Forty Fort and West Pittston, donated 20 large pies to the nursing home’s workers.\n\nDebbie Kearney, a member of Cross Creek Community Church, organized the event held as COVID-19 has been ravaging nursing homes.\n\n“We just got together and decided we want to do this,” Kearney said. “We play religious songs to bring them the word of God and to let them know there’s hope and there’s support and so they can see us out here when they look through their windows.”\n\nShe joined other church members like Shellene Clark of Tunkhannock, who wrote “Trust in the Lord with all your heart” in chalk.\n\nMary Joyce Stefanowicz of Hanover Twp. held a sign reading, “Sending love and prayers.” She said her 86-year-old mother, a resident of Timber Ridge Health Care Center in Plains Twp., has COVID-19 and the group previously visited that nursing home.\n\n“The people at the nursing home said what a great encouragement it was to the residents and to the staff,” Stefanowicz said. “It’s a good church outreach so the people know we’re praying for them. We’re praying for health care workers. We’re praying for everybody with the virus.”\n\nMembers of the group also visited other nursing homes and they said they plan to visit more in the future.\n\n5/3/2020\n\nTwo area students accepted to Geisinger Primary Care Scholars Program\n\nSubmitted\n\nGeisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine announces the first cohort of students accepted to the Geisinger Primary Care Scholars Program, in which selected scholars receive a monthly stipend and pay no tuition or fees in exchange for an obligation to work in a primary care area (family medicine, internal medicine or medicine-pediatrics) at Geisinger once they finish residency.\n\nIn addition to the tuition relief and stipend, the scholars will also receive mentorship and training in Geisinger’s newly redesigned practices where primary care is emphasized as the most important place doctor-patient relationships are built. The redesign has elevated primary care and provided clinicians with more time and resources to focus on patients, not administrative tasks.\n\nThe students were chosen through a competitive application process. Those selected for the program will receive a monthly stipend and will pay no tuition, in exchange for an obligation to work in a primary care field at Geisinger once they finish residency.\n\nPreference is given to students who express a desire to care for the communities Geisinger serves. Selection criteria includes commitment to primary care, demonstrated financial need, academic merit, diversity and predictors of whether the applicant is likely to stay in the region Geisinger serves.\n\nUp to 40 awards will be made annually. The first Geisinger Primary Care Scholars are Christopher Kropiewnicki, of Nanticoke, and a member of GCSOM’s Class of 2022, and Kara Romanowski, of Swoyersville, and a member of GCSOM’s Class of 2023.\n\n4/22/2020\n\nName dispute between kielbasa competitors sparks federal lawsuit\n\ntpkernan@timesleader.com\n\nThe owner of a Nanticoke kielbasa shop filed a federal lawsuit earlier this year against a competitor with a similar name, claiming the name infringes on his trademark.\n\nThe dispute between Tarnowski’s Kielbasa and the unaffiliated Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasa appears to be a family battle over use of the surname. The relationship between the litigants was not immediately clear.\n\nThe suit was filed in February by John T. Vishnefski, who owns Tarnowski’s Kielbasa, located at 579 E. Main St., Nanticoke. Vishnefski filed the suit against Mark Tarnowski, owner of the unaffiliated Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasi, which is based on Union Street.\n\nVishnesfski’s business Facebook page states: “Tarnowski’s Kielbasa has been made for 70 years using the same family recipe Grandpa Tad and his brothers created. John and Anastasia Vishnefski are proud to carry on the family tradition in our new location on Main St. in Nanticoke.”\n\nMeanwhile, Tarnowski Bros.’ Facebook page says it is “original since 1946,” adding in a recent post: This is our family name! Mark and Mike Tarnowski. Our father always told us “Don’t be afraid to use your name.”\n\nVishnefski is claiming in his suit that Tarnowski is attempting to confuse customers into buying his kielbasa, noting that Vishnefski’s shop has won several awards for its kielbasa.\n\n“He intentionally confuses customers by using this name, ‘Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasi,’” Vishnefski writes in his suit.\n\nVishnefski, who has been selling kielbasa under the name of Tarnowski’s Kielbasa in late 2011, is seeking for an injunction to be issued against Tarnowski’s business, preventing him from using the names “Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasi” or “Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasi on Wheels.”\n\nVishnefski applied for a trademark for the name Tarnowski’s Kielbasa in 2017, and was granted the trademark in 2018.\n\n“Mark Tarnowski’s actions have diluted the name ‘Tarnowski’s Kielbasa,’ misrepresented his product in relation with distribution and advertising, and injured the business reputation of John T. Vishnefski,” Vishnefski wrote in his filing.\n\nVishnefski initially represented himself in the case, but is now represented by William L. Byrne.\n\nA response from Tarnowski, filed by his attorney Thomas J. Killino last week, denies that customers are confused by the names.\n\n“It is specifically denied that there is any confusion as to the source of products between the parties and consumers,” the response reads in part. “It is further denied that (Tarnowski) misrepresented his product in relation with distribution and advertising. By way of further denial, (Tarnowski) operates a business filed under the name of the owner, (Tarnowski), that is profitable in its own right and in now way is confused with, competes with, infringes upon, or in any way is harmful to (Vishnefki’s) business.”\n\nA telephone conference is scheduled for Monday before U.S. District Magistrate Judge Joseph F. Saporito.\n\n4/22/2020\n\nKielbasa rivalry heats up with trademark infringement suit\n\nThe Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasa food truck is alleged to be a trademark violation.\n\njhalpin@citizensvoice.com\n\n​\n\nThe owner of an award-winning Nanticoke kielbasa shop has filed a federal lawsuit alleging a competitor is illegally infringing on the business’s trademarked name.\n\nJohn T. Vishnefski, owner of Tarnowski’s Kielbasa Inc. at 579 E. Main St., alleges in the complaint that Nanticoke resident Mark Tarnowski is violating his trademark by running an unaffiliated business called Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasa at 14 E. Union St.\n\nIn his complaint, Vishnefski notes his brick-and-mortar shop has won numerous awards for its products, including taking first prize in the smoked kielbasa contest last year at the Plymouth Alive Kielbasa Festival.\n\n“Mark Tarnowski owns a food trailer which he calls ‘Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasa,’” Vishnefski wrote. “He intentionally confuses customers by using this name.”\n\nThe complaint said under Vishnefski’s ownership, his business first produced kielbasa under the name Tarnowski’s Kielbasa in November 2011. Vishnefski subsequently applied for a trademark in November 2017 and the name was registered in September 2018, the complaint says.\n\nThe name is an “important and valuable business asset,” and Tarnowski’s use of a similar name for products Vishnefski cannot control has caused unfair competition and a loss of business, the complaint alleges.\n\n“Mark Tarnowski’s actions have diluted the name ‘Tarnowski’s Kielbasa,’ misrepresented his product in relation with distribution and advertising, and injured the business reputation of John T. Vishnefski,” Vishnefski wrote in the complaint.\n\nVishnefski originally filed the complaint himself, but is now represented by Wilkes-Barre attorney William L. Byrne, according to court records.\n\nThe suit seeks a permanent injunction blocking Tarnowski from using the name.\n\nIn an answer to the complaint filed on behalf of Tarnowski, Pittston attorney Thomas J. Killino denies that the similar name has harmed Vishnefski’s business and seeks dismissal of the lawsuit.\n\n“It is specifically denied that there is any confusion as to the source of products between the parties and consumers. It is further denied that (Tarnowski) misrepresented his product in relation with distribution and advertising,” Killino wrote. “(Tarnowski) operates a business founded under the name of the owner, (himself), that is profitable in its own right and in no way is confused with, competes with, infringes upon, or in any way is harmful to (Vishnefski’s) business.”\n\nIn a Facebook post this week, Tarnowski Bros. Kielbasa publicly responded to the lawsuit.\n\n“This is our family name! Mark and Mike Tarnowski. Our father always told us ‘Don’t be afraid to use your name,’” the post read. “We appreciate your business and will continue to provide you with great tasting kielbasi.”\n\nThe matter is currently scheduled for a case management conference before Magistrate Judge Joseph F. Saporito Jr. on April 27.\n\n​\n\n4/14/2020\n\nMore schools adjust online learning plans\n\nmbuffer@citizensvoice.com\n\nMore adjustments to online education plans for public schools are on the way.\n\nThe Greater Nanticoke Area School District will roll out a new online curriculum next week for grades 6-9, Superintendent Ronald Grevera said Monday.\n\nAll schools in Pennsylvania closed March 16 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Greater Nanticoke Area began online education two weeks ago to “review and enrich” learning.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf announced last Thursday all schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.\n\nGreater Nanticoke has also applied for a grant to buy more Google Chromebooks to students, Grevera said.\n\n“We are asking for parents to assist us in collaborating to deliver new instruction to our students,” Grevera said. “Our fear is that it will be very difficult to fill in the learning gaps if we do not provide new material.”\n\nThe district is “in the process of mandating” that students “log in and attempt the various assignments that are posted,” but the district is not grading assignments at this time, Grevera said.\n\nPittston Area is also changing its continuity of education plan because of the closure for the remainder of the academic year.\n\n“Students will continue to receive review and enrichment activities for the week of April 14th,” Superintendent Kevin Booth said in a message on the district website. “The week of April 20th, we will begin to transition from a review and enrichment model to the introduction of new material. As of April 20th, the work will no longer be optional. Students will be required to log-in and complete assignments or hand-in their pencil and paper assignments to be given credit.”\n\nThe Dallas School District is emphasizing “to students and parents the importance of students logging on to each Google Classroom each school day to maintain contact with school,” Superintendent Thomas Duffy said.\n\n“Student participation is being recorded,” Duffy added.\n\nDallas has distributed more than 400 Chromebooks to date and has “a hotline for families in need of devices,” Duffy said.\n\n“We have a limited number of families who are in need of internet connectivity and are working with third providers to assist those families,” Duffy said.\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area students can access Google Classroom, which the district is using for grades 3-12, through Xbox or PS4 games systems, Grevera said. He added he is hoping the high school is able to hold a graduation ceremony “at some point over the summer” perhaps at the football stadium for the first time “in a long time.”\n\nDallas has not altered graduation plans as of Monday.\n\n“We remain hopeful and optimistic that we will be able to hold a traditional graduation for our seniors,” Duffy said.\n\n4/10/2020\n\nDistricts mull options for graduation\n\nJames Halpin and Stephanie Panny, Staff Writers - Citizens Voice\n\nDallas superintendent Thomas Duffy said his district will wait until graduation day draws closer for the most up-to-date information before making a decision.\n\nLocal schools are now figuring out how to hold graduation following Gov. Tom Wolf’s announcement to close schools for the remainder of the school year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Thursday, Crestwood superintendent Bob Mehalick said the district is still waiting to see how things play out before making a decision on a ceremony. He added a ceremony will take place when it’s safe to do so, whether that be in August or over Christmas break.\n\n“We will certainly graduate them on June 11, and that will be remotely,” Mehalick said. “We are working with our students to find a way for the ceremony.”\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area Superintendent Ronald J. Grevera Jr. said it’s too soon to set a date for a graduation ceremony but added that even when it takes place the district will employ social distancing guidelines.\n\n“We are looking at having our graduation outside this year and returning it to our football stadium which was a past tradition in our district,” Grevera said. “We will be looking at a traditional graduation ceremony but we are not going to release a date at this time until we can get a look at the COVID-19 cases of infection in the county.”\n\nDallas superintendent Thomas Duffy said the administration will wait until the date draws closer for the most up-to-date information before making a decision.\n\nNorthwest Area superintendent Joseph F. Long Jr. said the administration will discuss options virtually with senior class officers so they can have input.\n\nPittston Area superintendent Kevin Booth said he plans to hold out on making any plans, as he wants seniors to have a traditional graduation to make up for their year being “turned over.”\n\n“If we can have a traditional ceremony we’d want to do that first,” Booth said. “If that opportunity doesn’t present itself, we have to move to plan B, and currently we don’t have a plan B.”\n\n​\n\n4/10/2020\n\nSenior stars Farrell, Butczynski miss out on ending\n\nSteve Bennett - Citizens Voice\n\n​\n\nColby Butczynski was looking forward to being the ace of the Nanticoke Area pitching staff. Jack Farrell was looking forward to the challenges of facing Archbishop Wood, a perennial state power in the quarterfinals of the state basketball tournament.\n\nThose hopes and dreams came to a crashing end Thursday when the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Association, the governing body of sports in the state, announced it was canceling the remainder of the sports season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFarrell, a forward/center on the Dallas boys basketball team, played for a state championship as a tight end/defensive end on the football team, and helped lead the basketball team to the quarterfinal round.\n\n“It was a little mix of emotions,” Farrell said when he heard the news the season was over. “Obviously there was some sadness knowing the school year is over and the basketball season is over. It is for the best. Just to protect the fans and athletes. You can’t be mad at that.”\n\nFor Butczynski, a senior who announced he will play at Northampton Community College next year, it brought an end for his chance to try and help lead the Trojans in a season where the hopes were to play for a district title. The Trojans returned all but two players from last year’s team, including shortstop Derek Cease, a junior who has already given a verbal commitment to Penn State.\n\n“It hurts that I can’t play with all my friends that I have been playing with since Little League,” said Butczynski, who played on the football team and was a member of the basketball team that made four consecutive trips to the state tournament. “I can’t graduate with them on stage or see all my teachers. It really hurts.”\n\nBut for the pair of seniors who were at the top of their class in terms of their athletic accomplishments, they realize they are experiencing a part of history, something they can look back upon and tell their children about down the road.\n\nMore importantly, while both were robbed of a part of their senior year, they both can sympathize with their friends who just play spring sports, and did not have the opportunity to participate in athletics in the fall or winter seasons.\n\n“I feel bad for the kids who focused on one sport and that sport being one that is played in the spring,” Butczynski said. “I was lucky, I got to play football and basketball, experience the bus rides with the team and all the memories you make. Just thinking about the community support we received during football and basketball, that is something we will miss out in the spring.”\n\nFarrell, who has committed to East Stroudsburg University where he will play basketball, can start getting ready to begin his collegiate career. But still, he is holding onto the memories of his final year of high school.\n\n“I realize I am part of the lucky few that got to play sports for a full season in the fall and winter and I can’t imagine how those kids are feeling now,” Farrell said. “Especially the one sport only baseball kids.\n\n“They trained all offseason to get to this point and it is taken away from them. I just hope they can keep their heads up and realize that it is best for the safety of everyone.”\n\n​\n\n4/10/2020\n\nButler Twp. woman describes COVID-19 testing process\n\nbkalinowski@citizensvoice.com\n\nPatricia Slusarczyk wanted to get tested for the coronavirus for a week, but felt so awful she couldn’t even bear to visit a testing site.\n\n“I could not go. I couldn’t move. I was just too weak,” the Butler Twp. woman said earlier this week while leaving a Geisinger Health System testing clinic in Nanticoke. “I never felt so bad in my life. I felt like I was on death’s door.”\n\nSlusarczyk, 55, was confident she has the virus after being exposed to it at her workplace, a meatpacking plant in Hazle Twp. where she works as a nurse.\n\nOn the same day Slusarczyk was tested, the company, Cargill Meat Solutions, announced it was temporarily closing its plant, which employs about 900 people, due to a coronavirus outbreak.\n\nNow, she’s awaiting the results and has been ordered to social distance from her husband, Ed, at their home in Drums.\n\n“That’s going to be really hard, living in the same house,” he said.\n\nGeisinger and other hospitals previously erected screening and treatment tents outside emergency rooms as a quarantine measure.\n\nGeisinger took the extra step recently by turning its Nanticoke clinic into a COVID-19 testing site, and temporarily moving some services to its Mountain Top clinic. An outpatient clinic on Wildflower Drive in Plains Twp., near Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center, also was converted into a testing center.\n\nSlusarczyk said her symptoms included a bad fever, a lingering cough, extreme weakness, and gastrointestinal problems.\n\nShe said she got tested just hours after she called to request a test.\n\nWhile some people assume the tests are painful, she said it’s not that bad.\n\n“They take a swab up your nose and put it up there, all the way back there and they swirl. And they go into the other side and do it again. It makes you uncomfortable. It makes you want to gag and cough,” Slusarczyk said.\n\nSlusarczyk said few others were in the testing site at the time she was but she assumes that was on purpose to limit cross exposure.\n\nTesting is done by appointment only.\n\nGeisinger officials wouldn’t say how many people have been tested at the off-site facilities.\n\n“If you’re having symptoms you think are related to COVID-19, before visiting a doctor’s office, clinic or emergency department, you should first contact your primary care physician, who can advise on proper treatment and, if necessary, recommend further testing,” Geisinger spokesman Matt Mattei said in a statement. “You can also call our nurse triage line at 570-284-3657 with questions about symptoms or the need for further evaluation or testing at one of these locations.”\n\nHe noted not everyone will be tested.\n\n“Because there are strict guidelines for who should be tested, Geisinger will not test anyone who does not meet CDC screening criteria. Doing so is neither a reliable way to identify exposure nor predict future symptoms,” Mattei said.\n\n​\n\n4/10/2020\n\n#GetMePPE protests planned today at local facilities\n\neshultz@citizensvoice.com\n\nThere hasn’t been cause for Hunter Yale to panic yet.\n\nBut, should the coronavirus outbreak ever reach his place of work at Guardian Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center in Nanticoke, Yale wants to make sure he can remain calm then, too.\n\n“I want to know that we are prepared to take this on,” Yale said over the phone Wednesday.\n\nYale, a dietary aide at Guardian, and co-workers will try to work toward achieving that peace of mind when they take part in the #GetMePPE National Day of Action protests today. Other local health care and nursing home workers in the SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania union will also participate in calling for the federal government to use the Defense Production Act to ensure personal protective equipment for all healthcare workers throughout the pandemic.\n\nThe movement also aims to ensure health care coverage, paid sick time and paid leave for all frontline workers across the nation, according to an SEIU news release.\n\nWorkers plan to protest while staying at least six feet apart at around 3 and 4 p.m., when shifts are finished or about to begin. In addition to Guardian, other union members from Mountain City Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Hazle Twp., the Meadows at Scranton for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Scranton and Dunmore Health Care Center in Dunmore intend to make their voices heard.\n\n“You really don’t understand until you’re on the frontline and you’re experiencing it,” Yale said. “That’s when you get the true feeling of, ‘We really need this equipment.’ We need to be protected.”\n\n“It’s very scary,” he added. “It would be reassuring to know that we would have abundant (equipment) to keep us protected.”\n\nYale said he and others at Guardian are equipped with homemade masks right now, and there’s access to an N95 mask that has to be re-used.\n\nHe hopes proactive steps assure the staff “proper equipment” now, not later. He could be working around others with compromised immune systems, or who can’t afford to stay away from work for long.\n\n“The government needs to act on it, and we want to make it known that we need the protection to not just protect ourselves, but protect our families,” Yale said.\n\n4/5/2020\n\nNanticoke woman brightens neighborhood\n\nsmocarsky@citizensvoice.com\n\nLoretta Chmura has decorated her home for most holidays since she was 15 years old, but for this Easter, she added something a bit unusual to her outdoor display.\n\nAmong the eggs, bunnies, peeps and baskets are four brown stuffed teddy bears.\n\n“People probably think I’m nuts putting out teddy bears for Easter, but they make the kids happy. That’s why I put them out,” said Chmura, 70.\n\n“I didn’t do as much as usual because of the (corona)virus, but I put the teddy bears up because they make kids feel better,” she said. “And at a time like this, everyone needs some extra hope and happiness.”\n\nChmura’s home is one of the few on Grand Street with an Easter display, let alone one of that magnitude, with holiday lights strung everywhere, illuminated plastic bunnies and peeps and even 40-year-old flowery Easter eggs custom-made by the late Nanticoke florist Stanley Olszewski.\n\n“I just love to decorate. It’s my hobby,” Chmura said.\n\nShe’s happy she can brighten up her neighborhood, and so are her neighbors.\n\n“They love to come outside and see how Loretta does her house,” Jayme Kocher said as her three sons, Giovanni, 7, Jacob, 5, and Joseph, 3, scampered across the street and onto Chmura’s front lawn for another close-up look at the display.\n\n“She always does such a good job,” Kocher said.\n\n“And not just for Easter, for all the holidays,” added Joseph Kirschner, the boys’ father.\n\nChmura said it took her about three days to decorate the house and side yard for Easter. Decorating for Christmas takes her about seven.\n\nEven inside the house, a basket of Pysanki — ornately decorated eggs in the Polish or Ukrainian styles — and a few other Easter decorations sit on her dining room table, with her pet macaw Cocomo, wearing a frilly Easter collar of soft pastels while perched in his cage nearby.\n\nChmura said she’ll have an Easter dinner with a friend of hers who resides in the nursing home where she works, since nursing homes have restricted even family from visiting residents because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShe’ll have another Easter dinner with her husband later that day.\n\nHer church’s services have been canceled because of the pandemic.\n\n“This will be a little bit different of an Easter,” she said.\n\n4/4/2020\n\nGeisinger testing for coronavirus at two clinics\n\ndallabaugh@citizensvoice.com\n\nGeisinger now has two new locations where patients can be tested for the coronavirus, Geisinger spokesman Matt Mattei said.\n\nThe sites are its clinic at 128 E. Main St. in Nanticoke and a clinic on Wildflower Drive in Plains Twp.\n\nTests will be done by appointment only, he said.\n\nAccording to Mattei, a nasal swab and a phlegm sample are needed for the test.\n\nGeisinger in-house testing is done at its on-site laboratory in Danville.\n\n“Right now, Geisinger is complementing its on-site laboratory testing by partnering with commercial laboratories such as Quest to offer additional options for COVID-19 laboratory testing,” Mattei said.\n\nResults from Geisinger’s on-site laboratory typically return between 3 and 24 hours depending on time of specimen collection. Results from Quest can take between 3 and 10 days to return, he said.\n\nBecause there are strict guidelines about who should be tested, Geisinger will not test anyone who does not meet screening criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.\n\n“If you’re having symptoms you think are related to COVID-19, before visiting a doctor’s office, clinic or emergency department, you should first contact your primary care physician, who can advise on proper treatment and, if necessary, recommend further testing,” Mattei said.\n\nTo slow the spread of COVID-19 in communities, Mattei said Geisinger is rescheduling non-urgent appointments and offering patients other options, such as telephone or telemedicine visits.\n\nA list of Geisinger clinics and hours of operations can be found at www.geisinger.org.

James Nash of St. Faustina’s Parish in Nanticoke had planned to hold a drive-by event in the church’s parking lot Sunday to hand out palms to mark the beginning of Holy Week.\n\n“That was the plan until yesterday,” Nash said Tuesday.\n\nPriests of other churches had other Palm Sunday plans to distribute already-purchased and delivered palms, like allowing those who come in for private worship to take some.\n\nBut Diocese of Scranton Bishop Joseph Bambara on Monday sent a letter to priests around the 11-county diocese informing them that any distribution of palms this year due to the coronavirus outbreak was prohibited.\n\n“While time honored and appreciated by many members of the faithful, the distribution of palms in any way risks the unnecessary spread of the coronavirus,” Bambera said in his letter, which included updated guidelines on how churches should operate now and during Holy Week.\n\nPalm Sunday commemorates Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem and Christians use the palm during ceremonies because in ancient times palm branches were a symbol of goodness and victory.\n\nNash said he understands the decision, despite the fact those distributing them outside St. Faustina’s would have been wearing gloves and masks\n\n“It’s the right decision. You can’t be too cautious,” Nash said.\n\nFour boxes — containing approximately 1,000 palms — sit in the church’s garage. They will be blessed and later distributed should Masses resume sometimes soon.\n\nNash said he wasn’t immediately sure how much the palms cost, but said it was minimal.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Verespy, of St. Nicholas Church in Wilkes-Barre, said the palms could dry out before masses resume.\n\n“We ordered them. What can you do?” Verespy said. “We’ll see what shape they are in when we reopen.”\n\nThe Rev. John Terry, of Our Lady of Hope Parish in Wilkes-Barre, said the parish was looking forward to Palm Sunday Mass. As of Tuesday, he said he was still wondering if he could have palms located in the church for parishioners who come in for private worship on Palm Sunday. The Park Avenue church will be open 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.\n\n“Nobody would handle them except for the person taking them.” he said.\n\nAnother change due to the coronavirus, is a relaxation on the prohibition of eating meat this Friday.\n\nBambera has granted a special dispensation to Catholics in the 11 counties of the Diocese of Scranton, allowing them to eat meat this Friday, a diocesan spokesman said.\n\nThe dispensation is the result of the difficulties some of the faithful are having in leaving their homes to get food amid the coronavirus outbreak, spokesman Eric Deabill said.\n\nThe obligation of fasting and abstinence still applies on Good Friday, April 10, Deabill said.\n\nIn his Monday letter, Bambara updated his list of directives to churches and parish leaders, such as:\n\nThe decision to maintain access to a church for private prayer remains a decision of the pastor or the parish life coordinator. Strict sanitization required.\n\nAll “private Masses” or prayer groups must cease\n\nNo funeral Masses or services, inclusive of those at funeral homes, are to be conducted. Priests, deacons and parish life coordinators may conduct grave-side burial services when appropriate for immediate family members only.\n\nAll public gatherings for the celebration of confessions or the Anointing of the Sick are suspended. In the gravest circumstances, priests may make themselves available for these sacraments, taking care to follow CDC guidelines for personal protection.\n\nThe celebration of baptism is to be suspended for the health and safety of all. In case of emergency (danger of death), the sacrament may be administered.\n\nAll weddings scheduled are to be postponed until further notice.\n\n4/1/2020\n\nNanticoke bar stripped of liquor license\n\nJames Halpin - Citizens Voice\n\nLacey's Bar and Catering has been stripped of its liquor license.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board shuttered a Nanticoke bar Wednesday for allegedly failing to comply with Gov. Tom Wolf’s business closure order.\n\nAccording to a sign posted at Lacey’s Bar and Catering, the board suspended the business’ license effective immediately until further notice for “not adhering to the governor’s mandate to cease the sale of food and alcohol for on-premises consumption.”\n\nWolf’s order closing non life-sustaining businesses allows restaurants to continue offering take out food but bars the sale of food and drink being consumed on site.\n\nThe bar is owned by James and Mary Lacey, whose home is attached to the building. Their son, Jim Lacey Jr., said that trouble began after the bar got a notice saying it was “recommended” that it close.\n\nWhen the bar stayed open on St. Patrick’s Day, an agent from the Liquor Control Board showed up saying it was required to close, he said.\n\n“He wasn’t too happy that we kept the bar open, I know that,” Lacey said.\n\nThe agent has been returning to the bar since, documenting people coming and going, he said.\n\nHowever, Lacey maintained that beginning March 18 the bar, which is located at 444 E. Main St., began offering take-out only services. The people coming and going since then include a home nurse to care for his parents and bartenders who have been assisting with other services, such as cleaning and bookkeeping, he said.\n\nAsked if anyone had been drinking at the bar, Lacey said he had not seen it happening when he’s been there in the morning and at night.\n\n“Now, what went on during the day, I really don’t know,” Lacey said. “I know at one point one of the friends that was here was back and forth (running errands) and they said he had a beer in his hand when he was coming out to see the bartenders. But as far as anybody actually sitting at the bar, as far as I know, no. And if they were, they shouldn’t have been.”\n\nLacey said he didn’t think he and his parents would try to challenge the suspension.\n\n“I don’t think an appeal would do anything,” Lacey said. “I just think they’re going to have to wait it out and do the best that they can with what they currently have.”\n\n3/31/2020\n\nOnline learning starts as school closures become indefinite\n\nmbuffer@citizensvoice.com\n\nAll Pennsylvania schools will remain closed until further notice, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday.\n\nWolf closed all schools in the state starting March 16 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last week, Wolf said all schools will remain closed for students through April 8.\n\nPublic schools in Luzerne County began moving ahead Monday with online education for students. The state Department of Education will be providing schools with updated guidance and resources “in the coming days” on the continuity of education for students, Wolf said Monday.\n\nHanover Area School District started online classes Monday, and roughly 400 high school students logged in early Monday morning, Superintendent Nathan Barrett said.\n\n“Teachers were very motivated to create their online classrooms,” Barrett said. “We experienced a low volume of technology issues as we had been preparing and building toward this day for nearly two weeks.”\n\nThe district will be reaching out to families unable to access online information and will be providing assistance, Barrett said. Hanover Area teachers are monitoring student work between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. and post assignments with flexible deadlines, according to an online message.\n\nStudents don’t have to be engaged throughout the entire school day and are encouraged to log-in daily for teacher updates, assignments & important information. Instruction is “Review & Enrichment,” so students are very familiar with the content. There will no report cards or cumulative averages established in the distance learning environment.\n\nThe Dallas School District provided more than 350 Chromebooks to students in need on Friday and Saturday, Superintendent Thomas Duffy said. Teachers were reaching out to parents and families by email and phone over the weekend and Monday, Duffy said.\n\n“Teachers will be reporting the number of students who have logged on by midday (today),” Duffy said, adding the district is “also in the process of working to establish opportunities for students and parents who need assistance with the social and emotional impacts of the pandemic or related support.”\n\nWilkes-Barre Area’s plan for the continuity of education also is “Enrichment and Review,” Superintendent Brian Costello said.\n\n“We are not replacing the type of education a child would receive in our classrooms,” Costello said. “That quality of education can only be achieved once we are back in school. What we are providing is an opportunity for our students to continue the learning process, throughout this closure, by reviewing specific content and providing enrichment.”\n\nWilkes-Barre Area administrators have been contacting families and students for them to pick up the necessary resources they may have requested, such as Chromebooks, Costello said. Service Electric and Comcast are both offering free internet service for a limited time for families in the district, Costello noted.\n\nGreater Nanticoke Area School District also started providing “review and enrichment” Monday, and teachers last week attended a Zoom session “to prepare the process of reaching out to their students,” Superintendent Ronald Grevera said.\n\n“ ... we emphasized that the material is simply to be used for review and enrichment and should be fun for students.” Grevera said in an email. “In these uncertain times, it is more important for students to take their mind off of the COVID-19 crisis and focus on enjoying learning rather than burdening them with new material. Because our students enjoy technology, we hope they can realize that technology can be used for learning and that it can be fun too!”\n\nLake-Lehman began online activities for students in grades 3-12 Monday.\n\n“These activities are not mandatory, but they are a great way to help keep your child engaged in learning while home,” Superintendent James McGovern said in a message posted online.\n\nAll Lake-Lehman students in grades 3-12 have Chromebooks from the district, McGovern said. Lake-Lehman students were able to get Chromebooks and work packets at district schools Monday.\n\nWyoming Valley West’s plan “Remediation and Review” today and “involves two to five hours per day of meaningful enrichment, review, and remediation driven by web-based means,” the district said on its website. Students are currently not mandated to participate, and assignments will not be graded. Attendance for students will not be taken.\n\nPittston Area teachers are reaching out to students and parents to identify access online resources, Superintendent Kevin Booth said in an online message.\n\n“It will be extremely important to establish structure and routine in the upcoming weeks,” Booth said, suggesting parents create study space free of distractions for students.\n\nCrestwood’s plan for “Enrichment and Review” began Monday and is moving forward in biweekly increments. An online message noted assignments are not mandatory and won’t be graded. The district recommends two to five hours a day of student engagement, and attendance will not be taken.\n\n3/30/2020\n\nCommunity helping local family whose home was damaged by fire\n\nBob Kalinowski – Citizens Voice\n\nImagine a family of 13 living together in a modest, three-bedroom house in Nanticoke, where the mother sleeps on the couch and the breadwinner father, who works 80 hours a week, sleeps in a makeshift bedroom in the basement.\n\nNow, imagine family life after their house is consumed by a fire, they are displaced, and are trying to get by in a local hotel while much of life is shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMeet the Atkins family.\n\nThe family, whose house on Pine Street in the city’s Hanover section caught fire last Sunday, remains incredibly upbeat despite their ordeal. However, family, friends and neighbors are rallying to help them. Henry Turoski, one neighbor who adores the family and says they are great people, has set up a fundraiser on GoFundMe.com, titled “Family of 13 in need after a house fire.”\n\n“I’m just trying to help this beautiful family in a time of need and anything at all will help,” Turoski wrote.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, donors contributed $5,800.\n\n“The community support has been amazing. It’s really touching,” said Tammy Atkins, 43, the mother of the 11 children and wife of Jason Atkins. “We have a place to stay, even if it’s at the hotel. It could have been so much worse. Thank God everyone got out OK.”\n\nThe couple said the fire started in a bedroom shared by their two teenage daughters after a candle was left burning overnight because they disliked the odors emitting from the recently remodeled and painted room, a fact confirmed by the Nanticoke Fire Department. Each of the girls sustained burns to their legs before fleeing the burning room, but are recovering.\n\nJason Atkins, a professional fence installer who works various side jobs to support the family, said he was in town from Georgia in 2004 doing work at a local state prison when he met his future wife. He and Tammy Atkins fell in love and he adopted her son, who happened to also be named Jason. Over the years, they had 10 more children and they named each child so that the first letter of their names, in order from oldest to youngest, spelled out his full name.\n\nTheir children include: Jason Jr., 25, Alexis, 15, Savannah, 14, Owen, 13, Natalee, 11, Amanda, 10, Tabitha, 9, Karlie, 7, Isaiah, 5, Nathan, 4, Spencer, 3.\n\n“All my kids get straight A’s,” Jason Atkins said. “People ask me all the time how can you afford all those kids? I say you can’t buy what I got.”\n\nThe couple is working with their insurance company to help fund repairs of their home, hopefully sooner rather than later, though they known the coronavirus could be an impediment.\n\n“We’re here in a hotel and the world is shut down,” Jason Atkins said. “We’re ready to go back home.”\n\nTHE ATKINS FAMILY\n\nJason and Tammy Atkins have 11 children. They named each child so that the first letter of their names, in order from oldest to youngest, spells out his full name. They are:\n\nJason Jr., 25, Alexis, 15, Savannah, 14, Owen, 13, Natalee, 11,\n\nAmanda, 10, Tabitha, 9, Karlie, 7, Isaiah, 5, Nathan, 4, Spencer, 3\n\n​\n\n3/29/2020\n\nMunicipal officials open new lines of communication with residents\n\nspanny@citizensvoice.com\n\nLast week, Wilkes-Barre City Councilwoman Beth Gilbert McBride put a request on Facebook looking for residents to submit questions that she will answer during an online Q&A session on Monday.\n\nThis is just one way she is trying to communicate with constituents while also practicing social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“These are unprecedented times and it’s critical that the public remains educated and informed of the issues we are facing, while continuing to provide our usual day-to-day services as well,” said Gilbert McBride, who is hoping to have at least one virtual town hall meeting. “I believe keeping an open line of communication with residents has helped everyone cope a little bit better by being informed.”\n\nIn lieu of person-to-person interaction, many municipalities have shifted their focus to online communication methods to reach their residents. Although they still allow people to call the borough or township buildings, which have been closed to the public, local municipalities have placed a greater emphasis on using social media to quickly get information out to residents.\n\nFor most local governments, City of Pittston Mayor Michael Lombardo said the situation is “uncharted waters.” Lombardo said his initial steps were to turn potential roadblocks into jumping off points to figure out what he and his staff needed to do to make sure residents remained informed.\n\nLombardo reached out to Mary Kroptavich, the city’s Main Street director, to utilize her social media skills and has been sending information out to local news outlets to reach those residents who don’t know how to access or use social media or online communication effectively.\n\nLombardo has been using a bilingual employee to translate messages for Spanish-speaking residents, and put auditory capabilities on online messages for those who are visually impaired.\n\nIn Nanticoke, Mayor Kevin Coughlin has done similar things to reach his residents. Coughlin said the city has enabled each employee to have remote access to the municipal building’s systems and both their website and Facebook page are being used regularly.\n\nHowever, for both Pittston and Nanticoke, the shift to communicating online was harder because they didn’t have communication protocols already in place.\n\nForty Fort Mayor Andy Tuzinski said already having a plan in place made it easier for his borough to shift platforms of communication for both municipal employees and residents.\n\nAfter the floods of 1972 and 2011, Tuzinski said he prepared emergency plans of action in case another disaster were to hit where residents could not physically reach government officials. Developing an alternative method of communication was one of those plans.\n\nTuzinski said the borough uses social media and the website to get word out to residents. Having a plan of action made the shift easier for both residents and government officials, he said.\n\n“There’s been some great suggestions and we’ve made some tweaks here and there,” Tuzinski said. “And everything’s been geared toward helping keep residents informed, but also to continue to maintain the services that the residents deserve.”\n\nOne of the road blocks a municipality can face is the technology — and training on that technology — itself.\n\nLombardo and Coughlin said a municipality’s financial situation itself dictates the infrastructure and technological allocation.\n\nLombardo said it’s “problematic” that there are places that don’t have that right now. Lombardo added his deputy director of community development had just submitted a request for a grant of $100,000 for tech upgrades.\n\n“I think we’ve recognized some deficiencies,” Lombardo said. “What this crisis has done is really put them right in our face.”\n\nGilbert McBride said city government systems are often antiquated and people are used to making the shift to online communication in general, much less solely online communication. As a millennial, Gilbert McBride said her adjustment was easier.\n\n“City Council was not prepared to shift,” Gilbert McBride said, “but we moved quickly to accommodate to this new reality.”\n\nGilbert McBride added that city council is looking at ways to live stream meetings beginning as soon as April.\n\nLombardo and Coughlin said they have been keeping in contact with each other as well as Wilkes-Barre City Mayor George Brown, Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, and Hazleton Mayor Jeff Cusat to share methods of communication and information. Lombardo said after the crisis, they all plan to meet for a post-analysis of their response and said communication methods will be one of the topics that comes up.\n\n3/29/2020\n\nDriver topples tombstones during pursuit through Newport Twp. Cemetery\n\nBob Kalinowski – Citizens Voice\n\nA suspect leading police on a wild vehicle chase Sunday afternoon in Nanticoke and Newport Twp. veered into a cemetery, where he toppled multiple tombstones and tore up grass gravesites before plowing through a metal fence and back onto residential streets.\n\nPolice eventually cornered the driver in his mangled car a short distance away on Alden Road in Newport Twp. and took him into custody.\n\nInvestigators said the 29-year-old suspect was taken to the hospital for a mental health evaluation and charges are pending consultation with county prosecutors.\n\n“It was pretty wild. There were a bunch of police cars chasing him,” said eyewitness Joe Bargella, 66, whose Newport Twp. backyard faces Holy Trinity Cemetery. “I heard, ‘bang, bang, bang,’ from him knocking over the headstones I guess.”\n\nPolice said the incident started when police were called to a home on College Street in Nanticoke on the report of a person throwing furniture from a second story window.\n\nThe man fled the home and led responding officers on a pursuit through city streets. State police, along with officers from Newport Twp. and Hanover Twp., soon responded as well.\n\nAfter the chase entered the cemetery, the man initially was on a paved road that loops around the cemetery and, at one point, it looked like police had the driver boxed in, Bargella said. But the driver reversed, made a quick maneuver, and drove into the grass in between and over tombstones. The driver drove through the cemetery, knocking over grave markers, and then plowed through the cemetery’s metal fence.\n\nPolice caught the man moments later, ending the chase.\n\nThe Rev. James Nash, of St. Faustina Church, the city’s consolidated Catholic parish that includes the former Holy Trinity Church, toured the cemetery destruction shortly afterward.\n\n“Vandalism is always sad, but when it occurs at a sacred spot like a cemetery, it takes on a special sadness,” the Rev. Nash said. “We will do all we need to do to restore the cemetery to its original dignity.”\n\n3/26/2020\n\nDistricts move to online education next week\n\nMichael P. Buffer – Citizens Voice\n\nPublic schools in the region are planning to start online education next week when the statewide school closure goes into its third week.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf closed all schools in the state starting March 16 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and schools will remain closed for students through April 8.\n\nDallas School District students begin online learning Monday. Superintendent Thomas Duffy said “our approach will be slow and deliberate,” noting the state has announced students could return to classrooms April 9.\n\n“We will work to equip students in need with devices between today and Monday and provide support for our teachers, students, and parents throughout this historic time,” Duffy said in an email. “Communication will be updated and frequent for the school district community.”\n\nCrestwood begins online instruction Monday to “review material already covered,” Superintendent Robert Mehalick said.\n\n“We will not introduce new material,” Mehalick said.\n\nTeachers will work remotely from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., but each student will not be completely engaged during that time, Mehalick said.\n\n“We have been preparing for some time,” Mehalick said, noting he is expecting “some glitches.”\n\nCrestwood conducted a survey of students, and less than 5% do not have devices or working WiFi, Mehalick said. The district will try to provide them with devices.\n\nPublic schools in Luzerne and Wyoming counties are working with the Luzerne Intermediate Unit 18 and the state Department of Education on their continuity of education plans.\n\n“These opportunities to review and enrich our students will never replace the constancy of face-to-face instruction with teachers in brick and mortar schools but are simply an opportunity to keep students engaged over the time period of the closure,” Greater Nanticoke Area Superintendent Ronald Grevera said.\n\nGrevera said “the great majority” of parents and students have internet access however, and said students who don’t took hard copies of textbooks and workbooks home with them.\n\nSpecial-needs education students “will have the same opportunities with adaptations to enrich and review material learned before the break,” Grevera said, explaining special education teachers “will continue to adapt and modify to the needs of our students.”\n\nEducators working on Individualized Education Programs for students “will work proactively over the period of the closure” to provide parents and guardians with students’ documents and “will provide the opportunity for a phone conference with IEP team members,” Grevera said.\n\nHanover Area is using Google Classroom to start online classes Monday. The district has identified students who need devices and will be working them “on a case-by-case basis,” Superintendent Nathan Barrett said, noting the amount was initially around 5% and has been reduced.\n\nPittston Area is still formulating a plans, and teachers “will begin to reach out to students starting on Monday,” Superintendent Kevin Booth said.\n\nWyoming Area “had been providing educational ‘online resources’ for our students,” and administrators will contact families “to provide them with an understanding of our online opportunities for enrichment and review as per the district’s continuity of Education plan,” Superintendent Janet Serino said.\n\n3/25/2020\n\nGNA donates equipment to Geisinger Wyoming Valley\n\nMichael Buffer – Citizens Voice\n\nThe Greater Nanticoke Area School District donated personal protective equipment, commonly referred to as PPE, to Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Plains Twp.\n\nThe school district acquired extra PPE to protect its cleaning and maintenance staff prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Superintendent Ronald Grevera said. The district donated the PPE because the hospital “was experiencing a shortage” and “it became evident that we wouldn’t use it,” Grevera said.\n\nThe donated PPE includes 185 coveralls with attached hoods, 100 booties, 15 respirator/full-face masks and 30 respirator filters.\n\n3/25/2020\n\nSchool districts prepare continuity plans\n\nMichael P. Buffer - Citizens Voice\n\nSchool districts in Luzerne and Wyoming counties will roll out continuity of education plans “in the coming days and weeks,” according to a letter signed by superintendents and administrators in the region.\n\n“As each of our school communities are unique, so will each individual district’s continuity of education plan,” officials said in the letter released Tuesday. “We believe these plans to be the most appropriate and reasonable way to engage with our students at this time.”\n\nGov. Tom Wolf closed all schools in the state starting March 16 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and schools will remain closed through at least April 6 with students returning to schools April 9 at the earliest.\n\nRead the letter\n\nThe Luzerne Intermediate Unit 18 has assisted its member school districts and career technology schools with developing continuity of education plans for an extended closure.\n\nThe member school districts of LIU 18 are Wilkes-Barre Area, Wyoming Valley West, Hanover Area, Greater Nanticoke Area, Northwest Area, Lake-Lehman, Dallas, Tunkannock Area, Wyoming Area, Pittston Area, Crestwood and Hazleton Area.\n\n“As with any good education plan, we will need your support at home, as we look at alternative ways of continuing your sons and/or daughters education in these unprecedented times. We are committed to doing the very best we can for each one of our students,” officials said in Tuesday’s letter.\n\nPlans “may change as we receive further guidance on implementation from our state leadership,” officials added.\n\nLIU 18 has provided a toolkit with “resources for districts to utilize in assisting them in finalizing their continuity of education plans and resources that they can use for review and enrichment,” Executive Director Anthony Grieco said. The toolkit will include information on service delivery models, legal perspectives, special education processes, technology Access, free online resources and paper and pencil resources.\n\nThe Dallas School District will begin “online opportunities” for students beginning Monday, the district announced in a text message to parents and students Tuesday morning.\n\n“We are finalizing plans to engage students online and will provide further information related to online opportunities for students this week,” Dallas Superintendent Thomas Duffy said in a letter posted on the district website.\n\nThe district conducted “online faculty meetings affirming communication capabilities within our district,” Duffy said. He also invited all students and families to participate in an online concert at 1 p.m. today “to uplift every spirit during this difficult time.”\n\nHanover Area students will continue academic work by accessing their assignments on Google Classroom, and arrangements will be made for students who don’t have access to appropriate technology, Superintendent Nathan Barrett said in a letter posted on the district website.\n\nNorthwest Area School District “is in process of finalizing the plan for continued instruction and will have all of the information to our families by week’s end,” Superintendent Joseph Long said Tuesday. Greater Nanticoke Area Superintendent Ronald Grevera said he expects to finalize plans with staff today.\n\n​\n\n3/24/2020\n\nBusinesses donate to local hospitals\n\nspanny@citizensvoice.com\n\nOn Monday, Nanticoke ceiling supplier Malishchak Brother Inc. donated 100 N95 face masks to Geisinger Nanticoke.\n\nCo-owner Jake Malishchak said they found the masks, apparently left over from job sites, when his father, Jerry, came home from an appointment at Geisinger and opened a closet.\n\nAfter conferring with his son about what to do with the masks, Jerry took the boxes, turned around, and donated the masks to the hospital.\n\nJake said he had purchased “a whole bunch” of masks a while ago and never used them. Jake said that because masks are such a rare commodity now, whatever businesses who have them can do to help is going to make a huge difference in the long run.\n\n“Me holding onto those masks isn’t doing me any good,” Jake said. “In the current situation we’re in that we have never faced, you have to do what you can to help your neighbor out.”\n\nStudent loan company Navient also announced it is donating 1,400 N95 face masks to the Geisinger Medical System through its Wilkes-Barre office.\n\nNavient said it had an “excess supply” and will be donating them to hospitals, American Red Cross chapters and other organizations across the nation that are in need of them.\n\n3/24/2020\n\nSchool closures extended into April\n\nmbuffer@citizensvoice.com\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Education announced Monday all public schools in the state will remain closed through at least April 6 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe closure order could be extended beyond April 6 if necessary. After a determination that students can return to school, staff will be given two days to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return on the third day.\n\nThe Diocese of Scranton has also announced its schools will remain closed until April 14. Gov. Tom Wolf initially announced closed public schools for two weeks, allowing them to potentially reopen March 30.\n\nSecretary of Education Pedro A. Rivera said the decision to close all schools for the additional period aligns with Wolf’s stay-at-home directive announced Monday for seven counties — Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Monroe, Montgomery and Philadelphia.\n\n“Protecting the health and safety of students, families, teachers and all employees who work in our schools is paramount during this national health crisis and we must continue our efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus,” Rivera said in a released statement. “The number of positive cases increases daily and we’re seeing it spread to more counties. We must adhere to the social distancing guidelines. Extending the closure will help every community in its efforts to mitigate the spread.”\n\nTo assist schools during the extended closure, Rivera said the state’s 29 intermediate units are ready to provide technical assistance to help develop continuity of education plans for all students.\n\n“We know students are eager to engage with their teachers and return to learning,” Rivera said. “Beginning tomorrow, all schools will be able to work with their local intermediate unit to develop instructional plans for all students, including those with disabilities and English language learners.”\n\nThe Luzerne Intermediate Unit 18 plans to “roll out a toolkit” today with “resources for districts to utilize in assisting them in finalizing their continuity of education plans,” Executive Director Anthony Grieco said Monday.\n\nThe toolkit will include information on service-delivery models, legal perspectives, special-education processes, technology access, free online resources and paper and pencil resources.\n\n“All districts have been working together over the last 10 days in preparing resources to be available to students,” Grieco said in an email.\n\nThe member school districts of LIU 18 are Wilkes-Barre Area, Wyoming Valley West, Hanover Area, Greater Nanticoke Area, Northwest Area, Lake-Lehman, Dallas, Tunkannock Area, Wyoming Area, Pittston Area, Crestwood and Hazleton Area.\n\nConstruction work on the $121 million Wilkes-Barre Area High School project has stopped due to Wolf’s order that all “non-life-sustaining” businesses close their physical locations, Wilkes-Barre Area School Board President Joe Caffrey said.\n\n“I don’t know where we are at,” Caffrey said, explaining the district is not focussing on the construction project right now.\n\nDistrict administrators and staff are focussing on delivering lunches to students during the school closure and preparing to resume student instruction, Caffrey said.\n\nThe state Department of Education has received a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that allows schools to serve grab-and-go meals during the closure. Wilkes-Barre Area has been providing 500 meals daily at various locations, and they also includes breakfast food for the next day, Caffrey said.\n\nWilkes-Barre Area is building a new high school on a 78-acre former mining site between South Main and Maffett streets in Plains Twp. The district was planning to open the new high school when the 2021-22 school year begins and merge the district’s three highs schools — GAR, Meyers and Coughlin.\n\n3/20/2020\n\nLBC Distillery turning vodka into hand sanitizer to combat shortage amid coronavirus pandemic\n\neshultz@citizensvoice.com\n\nIt’s last call for alcohol at LBC Distillery for now.\n\nAt the start of the week, Jonathan Lang was ready to “corner the market” on spirits as Pennsylvania announced the shutdown of all its Fine Wine & Good Spirits stores in an effort to combat the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nLang, co-founder and distiller of what’s billed as “Pennsylvania’s smallest distillery,” learned he was an exception to the measure and could continue selling his own rum, gin and vodka.\n\nBy Thursday, though, Lang had begun preparing to turn his vodka into hand sanitizer.\n\nAs hand sanitizer stocks have been depleted in stores around the area due to the coronavirus pandemic, special exemptions made Wednesday now allow distilleries like LBC to produce and sell their own products to the public.\n\nLang already had supply orders placed by Thursday morning and is hopeful he can begin selling hundreds of hand sanitizer bottles to the community in as early as two weeks.\n\n“I really love doing this. I really love making rum, gin, vodka. That’s truly our passion here,” Lang said. “But seeing the shortage and being given the opportunity to help out when it’s needed, we’re definitely going to take advantage of that, step in and do what we can.”\n\nLang received an email Wednesday evening from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau outlining the relaxed rules on hand sanitizer production.\n\nDistilled spirits permittees such as Lang were allowed immediately to produce hand sanitizer with their alcohol supplies. The TTB said the exemptions are “initially approved through June 30, 2020, with the possibility for extension as necessary.”\n\n“Prior to (Wednesday), we were allowed to make something you could drink,” Lang said, “but not allowed to make something you could rub on your hands, which I got a kick out of.”\n\nLang said the actual manufacturing is rather straightforward, and he’s concocted sanitizer for home use in the past.\n\nLang already has the water and ethanol (distilled spirits) needed, and he’s placed orders for glycerol, hydrogen peroxide and individual bottles for sale. He’s anticipating all the shipments to arrive by the end of next week.\n\nOnce all his supplies are delivered, he expects to need only a day or two to whip up his first batch. LB"
