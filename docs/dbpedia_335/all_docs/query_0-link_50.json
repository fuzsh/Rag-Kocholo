        "text": "Want to know how I unlocked San Francisco when I first arrived? One of the first things I did after arriving was set up a monthly founders' dinner to bring together people building interesting companies. It very quickly made the city feel like home, but motivated me to carry on hosting them for 3 reasons: 🤫 It became a safe place to back-channel Fundraising is tough - especially at the moment. It’s hard for VCs (dealing with LPs) and it’s hard for founders to raise the cash they need to grow. So being able to sense check with other founders and carry out ‘founder due diligence’ is vital. 🤗 It’s supportive Being a founder is often lonely - but it doesn’t need to be. Most founders I know are actively trying to support other founders, we’re all just too scared to ask. These monthly dinners have become a safe space to ask for help without judgment. 🕺 We need to have fun As a founder, you’ll often be spending 60+ hours a week building - blowing off steam with people who have shared interests as you is key to a healthy mind. Plus I often start the next day full of creativity. While I’ve been back in London - I’ve been doing the exact same thing - monthly dinners with small groups of incredible founders, sharing ideas, supporting each other, and having fun. If you’re a founder based in San Francisco or London - and want to join either of the last dinners of 2023 I’ll be hosting at the end of the month in both cities - drop me a message. Here’s one from the last dinner in London.\n\nHere is a short sum up! 🤯 💻 California is the tech superstar, 🙌 Texas is the business-friendly hangout, 🤑 New York is where finance meets creativity, & 😎 Colorado is the outdoorsy innovator's dream. ------------------------------------------------------------- California (especially Silicon Valley) is like the global HQ for tech. - Lots of big players, lots of cool ideas. - It’s a Networking Central. Everyone knows everyone - But its cost of living is very high. ------------------------------------------------------------- Texas isn't all about tech but a melting pot of businesses. - From energy to health, you've got a shot no matter your niche. - It's the new favorite place to invest for investors. - Good if you're not a tech startup, but might feel a bit left out if you are. - And not too many rules. Good or bad, depends on your perspective. ------------------------------------------------------------- New York is like the Wall Street of startups. - It's not just about dollars; it's about ideas. A creative hub. - But, again expenses are high & not every industry shines equally. ------------------------------------------------------------- Colorado - Nature Lovers' Paradise. Quality of life is a big deal here. - Denver & Boulder are like mini startup powerhouses — Lots of innovation brewing in these pockets. - It's not as crowded as the big shots. - Certain industries cozy up better here – like outdoor stuff. Each state had its vibe. Now, Where do you want to go as an entrepreneur?

This business would require a tech platform, a brand… and a nationwide transport network. These things cost money, so I spent much of my life from 2016-2019 visiting the offices of angel investors, family offices and venture capitalists. London’s a curious city: tech firms are typically in Old Street, angels in the City, family offices in Mayfair and VCs in Soho or Clerkenwell. So a typical day would involve quite a bit of traveling round London. London has some of the highest rates of VC investment in Europe. There will be many reasons for this. But one of them is that founders and investors can meet each other easily and quickly; thanks to the Tube. #tube160 Here’s Friday’s on Oxford Circus: https://buff.ly/3Z62Fvq\n\nI spent 2 months in the USA. For my entire life in Sydney, it’s been a goal to visit the US and experience its startup culture first-hand. After graduating and selling my last company, I booked a ticket to the US and spent time in San Francisco and New York Here’s what I took away from the experience. 1. The harm of echo chambers: Walking through SF was unlike anything I’d experienced in Australia, the amount of founder noise was intoxicating. As soon as I landed in SFO, I saw billboards promoting the newest dev tools and Voice AI platforms Nothing like I’d ever experienced before. Being from a country where startups are not nearly as prevalent, I couldn’t help but feel like there was a tremendous amount of value in experiencing both extremes. For one, being in SF can stunt external views of the world. The echo chamber of being a founder and building a startup in SF tends to lend itself to startups building for other startups, and rarely having experience in more antiquated industries. YC is an excellent example of this, in which companies are most often selling to each other. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I believe there's a tremendous opportunity to succeed if you are targeting more fresh startup markets. 2. The Value of American Ambition Why do people move to the US to start a company? Compared to Australia, the willingness to accept risk, potential failure and back inexperienced founders is magnitudes higher than what we experience domestically. Access to capital, networks and clients is also larger by any measurement. While it's not a necessity to build in the USA, these reasons are appealing. However, For my latest company, we’ve deliberately chosen to tackle Australia first, take these learnings, and progress into the wider market. Seeing the bright lights for myself, staying with Zach Laberge, Eric Zhu, Marc Baghadjian and Nikolas Ioannou opened my eyes, and I’m excited to continue to take these learnings into my current journey. This pizza with the guys was great, however, so maybe I’ll move to SF just for that :)\n\n#Bankruptcy Update via Bill Siegel: >Good article in the WSJ regarding WeWork & how it rode the venture-capital wave, building a global real estate empire worth more than any other U.S. startup before buckling & laying off thousands when funding ran dry under its turbulent co-founder & former CEO Adam Neumann leading to a historic office market bust that doomed company. https://lnkd.in/e3A-69wp >WeWork plans to file bankruptcy having missed an interest payment to bondholders on October 2, which kicked off a 30-day grace period. Despite a 7-day extension to negotiate with stakeholders before default is triggered, expectations are low that anything can be worked out. Stunning reversal for the venture once valued at $47B. https://lnkd.in/gkZsFc8p #banrkuptcy #retail #landlords >US economy added 150K jobs in Oct.; hiring slowed sharply, unemployment increased from 3.8% to 3.9%, the highest level since Jan. 2022. https://lnkd.in/geW7j4hD >The value of distressed US commercial real estate neared $8B in the Q3, its highest level in a decade, as rising interest rates &sagging office demand shook the property market. Of note, the value of buildings in bankruptcy, repossessed by lenders or in the process of liquidation increased by a net $5.6B in Q3. https://lnkd.in/g3yHmsjy >Unlike other opioid bankrupt defendants who had deals lined up with some opioid plaintiffs, bankrupt pharmacy Rite Aid has chosen to file Ch. 11 to address the cost of dealing with over 1600 opioid lawsuits, as well as closing stores & cutting billions in financial debt. https://lnkd.in/e7xfbSHk >Per the Federal Reserve, commercial real estate debt increased $320B over the year or 5.9% from Q2 2022 to $5.8 trillion in Q2 2023. https://lnkd.in/d2mCiDRN >The U.S. economy grew at a 4.9% annual rate for Q3, powered by a surge in consumer spending. Again, this defies predictions of a slow down prompted by the Federal Reserve interest rate increases & is a far cry from the forecasted recession. Go figure. https://lnkd.in/gZxSFiYP >The chance for persistent inflation to keep interest rates higher and potential losses in the commercial real estate market are among the top concerns of respondents to a Federal Reserve survey on financial stability. https://lnkd.in/g7KmY6wu #landlords #bankruptcy #retail #economy\n\nWhen we think about interest rates, we traditionally think about large companies, bond issuers, and the large banks that make loans or trade bonds. We don’t often think of startups given their sweat equity and private funding. But when interest rates are hiked up 300 to 400 basis points in a year, suddenly, the ripples are felt everywhere, even in startup land. A popular startup bank failed, startups it served are reeling from multiple rounds of layoffs and now the company that housed many of them is going bankrupt. The loud sucking sound coming out of Silicon Valley has all but been silenced. While nobody wishes for failures, there are certain business lessons and good things that can come out of this high-rate environment: Over expansion is a symptom of poor forecasting, or carelessness. Neither is a flattering reputation. CFOs and accountants should never have been secondary hires. If you’re asking for money, job #1 is to keep track of that money. Some of the most successful companies in the world started off in a garage, with just a few friends and credit card debt. Scarcity of capital and a frugal mindset forced these founders to focus on the job instead of creating a god-complex and fan club. The unsustainable ecosystem of advisors, startup consultancies and accelerators will feel shockwaves. Dyed in the wool entrepreneurs don’t need these accoutrements because they are born salespeople, savvy, with connections. Knowing when to stop is a sign of wisdom and integrity. When your business isn’t gaining traction after multiple tries, that is the market’s invisible hand diverting capital elsewhere. As Coco Chanel once said, “Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.” #investmentbanking #strategy #restructuring #womenonboards\n\nI try not to be an \"I told you so\" kind of person, but...... This isn't that surprising if you think about it. While SF and the Bay Area in general have taken longer to emerge from the impact and disruption of the pandemic, the fundamentals of what has made this a historically attractive place for decades haven't really changed. Some of the social issues (that also plague most urban areas in the country to some degree) ebb and flow on the surface and the entire country needs to deal with the root causes of those not just the Bay. That's for another conversation. However, the Bay is still ideally located with many important trade routes, you've got major ports; Stanford, #Cal, UCSF, etc. haven't moved producing a many well educated ambitious folks; you've got a diverse population that generate ideas and create a dynamic culture; mild climate without as many extremes that enables you to be outdoors 9 - 10 months a year and really all year if you are even a little hardy; things to do and a great food scene; the natural beauty hasn't changed; and a ton of money is still in the area. It is really just a matter of time before another industry rediscovers these features and things change again."
