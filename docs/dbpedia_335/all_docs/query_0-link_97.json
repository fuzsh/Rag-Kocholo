        "text": "Optical Observations of Space Debris\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSeitzer, Patrick; Abercromby, Kira; Rodriquez, Heather; Barker, Edwin S.; Kelecy, Thomas\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis viewgraph presentation reviews the use of optical telescopes to observe space debris. .It will present a brief review of how the survey is conducted, and what some of the significant results encompass. The goal is to characterize the population of debris objects at GEO, with emphasis on the faint object population. Because the survey observations extend over a very short arc (5 minutes), a full six parameter orbit can not be determined. Recently we have begun to use a second telescope, the 0.9-m at CTIO, as a chase telescope to do follow-up observations of potential GEO debris candidates found by MODEST. With a long enough sequence of observations, a full six-parameter orbit including eccentricity can be determined. The project has used STK since inception for planning observing sessions based on the distribution of bright cataloged objects and the anti-solar point (to avoid eclipse). Recently, AGI's Orbit Determination Tool Kit (ODTK) has been used to determine orbits, including the effects of solar radiation pressure. Since an unknown fraction of the faint debris at GEO has a high area-to-mass ratio (A/M), the orbits are perturbed significantly by solar radiation. The ODTK analysis results indicate that temporal variations in the solar perturbations, possibly due to debris orientation dynamics, can be estimated in the OD process. Additionally, the best results appear to be achieved when solar forces orthogonal to the object-Sun line are considered. Determining the A/M of individual objects and the distribution of A/M values of a large sample of debris is important to understanding the total population of debris at GEO\n\nSpace Debris and Observational Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSeitzer, Patrick\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSince the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, astronomers have faced an increasing number of artificial objects contaminating their images of the night sky. Currently almost 17000 objects larger than 10 cm are tracked and have current orbits in the public catalog. Active missions are only a small fraction of these objects. Most are inactive satellites, rocket bodies, and fragments of larger objects: all space debris. Several mega-constellations are planned which will increase this number by 20% or more in low Earth orbit (LEO). In terms of observational astronomy, this population of Earth orbiting objects has three implications: 1) the number of streaks and glints from spacecraft will only increase. There are some practical steps that can be taken to minimize the number of such streaks and glints in astronomical imaging data. 2) The risk to damage to orbiting astronomical telescopes will only increase, particularly those in LEO. 3) If you are working on a plan for an orbiting telescope project, then there are specific steps that must be taken to minimize space debris generation during the mission lifetime, and actions to safely dispose of the spacecraft at end of mission to prevent it from becoming space debris and a risk to other missions. These steps may involve sacrifices to mission performance and lifetime, but are essential in today's orbital environment.\n\nThe INAF contribution to the ASI Space Debris program: observational activities.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPupillo, G.; Salerno, E.; Bartolini, M.; Di Martino, M.; Mattana, A.; Montebugnoli, S.; Portelli, C.; Pluchino, S.; SchillirÃ², F.; Konovalenko, A.; Nabatov, A.; Nechaeva, M.\n\nSpace debris are man made objects orbiting around Earth that pose a serious hazard for both present and future human activities in space. Since 2007 the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) carried out a number of radar campaigns in the framework of the ASI ``Space Debris'' program. The observations were performed by using bi- and multi-static radars, composed of the INAF 32-m Italian radiotelescopes located at Medicina and Noto (used as receivers) and the 70-m parabolic antenna at Evpatoria (Ukraine) used as transmitter. The 32 m Ventspils antenna in Latvia also participated in the last campaign at the end of June 2010. Several kinds of objects in various orbital regions (radar calibrators, rocket upper stages, debris of different sizes) were observed and successfully detected. Some unknown objects were also discovered in LEO during the beam-park sessions. In this paper we describe some results of the INAF-ASI space debris research activity.\n\nObserving orbital debris using space-based telescopes. I - Mission orbit considerations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nReynolds, Robert C.; Talent, David L.; Vilas, Faith\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIn this paper, mission orbit considerations are addressed for using the Space Shuttle as a telescope platform for observing man-made orbital debris. Computer modeling of various electrooptical systems predicts that such a space-borne system will be able to detect particles as small as 1-mm diameter. The research is meant to support the development of debris- collision warning sensors through the acquisition of spatial distribution and spectral characteristics for debris and testing of detector combinations on a shuttle-borne telescopic experiment. The technique can also be applied to low-earth-orbit-debris environment monitoring systems. It is shown how the choice of mission orbit, season of launch, and time of day of launch may be employed to provide extended periods of favorable observing conditions.\n\nExploiting Orbital Data and Observation Campaigns to Improve Space Debris Models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBraun, V.; Horstmann, A.; Reihs, B.; Lemmens, S.; Merz, K.; Krag, H.\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) has been developing the Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference (MASTER) software as the European reference model for space debris for more than 25 years. It is an event-based simulation of all known individual debris-generating events since 1957, including breakups, solid rocket motor firings and nuclear reactor core ejections. In 2014, the upgraded Debris Risk Assessment and Mitigation Analysis (DRAMA) tool suite was released. In the same year an ESA instruction made the standard ISO 24113:2011 on space debris mitigation requirements, adopted via the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS), applicable to all ESA missions. In order to verify the compliance of a space mission with those requirements, the DRAMA software is used to assess collision avoidance statistics, estimate the remaining orbital lifetime and evaluate the on-ground risk for controlled and uncontrolled reentries. In this paper, the approach to validate the MASTER and DRAMA tools is outlined. For objects larger than 1 cm, thus potentially being observable from ground, the MASTER model has been validated through dedicated observation campaigns. Recent campaign results shall be discussed. Moreover, catalogue data from the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) has been used to correlate the larger objects. In DRAMA, the assessment of collision avoidance statistics is based on orbit uncertainty information derived from Conjunction Data Messages (CDM) provided by the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). They were collected for more than 20 ESA spacecraft in the recent years. The way this information is going to be used in a future DRAMA version is outlined and the comparison of estimated manoeuvre rates with real manoeuvres from the operations of ESA spacecraft is shown.\n\nImage processing improvement for optical observations of space debris with the TAROT telescopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThiebaut, C.; Theron, S.; Richard, P.; Blanchet, G.; Klotz, A.; BoÃ«r, M.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nCNES is involved in the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and is observing space debris with two robotic ground based fully automated telescopes called TAROT and operated by the CNRS. An image processing algorithm devoted to debris detection in geostationary orbit is implemented in the standard pipeline. Nevertheless, this algorithm is unable to deal with debris tracking mode images, this mode being the preferred one for debris detectability. We present an algorithm improvement for this mode and give results in terms of false detection rate.\n\nActivities of JAXA's Innovative Technology Center on Space Debris Observation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYanagisawa, T.; Kurosaki, H.; Nakajima, A.\n\nThe innovative technology research center of JAXA is developing observational technologies for GEO objects in order to cope with the space debris problem. The center had constructed the optical observational facility for space debris at Mt. Nyukasa, Nagano in 2006. As observational equipments such as CCD cameras and telescopes were set up, the normal observation started. In this paper, the detail of the facilities and its activities are introduced. The observational facility contains two telescopes and two CCD cameras. The apertures of the telescopes are 35cm and 25 cm, respectively. One CCD camera in which 2K2K chip is installed can observe a sky region of 1.3 times 1.3-degree using the 35cm telescope. The other CCD camera that contains two 4K2K chips has an ability to observe 2.6 times 2.6-degree's region with the 25cm telescope. One of our main objectives is to detect faint GEO objects that are not catalogued. Generally, the detection limit of GEO object is determined by the aperture of the telescope. However, by improving image processing techniques, the limit may become low. We are developing some image processing methods that use many CCD frames to detect faint objects. We are trying to use FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) system to reduce analyzing time. By applying these methods to the data taken by a large telescope, the detection limit will be significantly lowered. The orbital determination of detected GEO debris is one of the important things to do. Especially, the narrow field view of an optical telescope hinders us from re-detection of the GEO debris for the orbital determination. Long observation time is required for one GEO object for the orbital determination that is inefficient. An effective observation strategy should be considered. We are testing one observation method invented by Umehara that observes one inertia position in the space. By observing one inertia position for two nights, a GEO object that passed through the position in the\n\nSpace-based detection of space debris by photometric and polarimetric characteristics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPang, Shuxia; Wang, Hu; Lu, Xiaoyun; Shen, Yang; Pan, Yue\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe number of space debris has been increasing dramatically in the last few years, and is expected to increase as much in the future. As the orbital debris population grows, the risk of collision between debris and other orbital objects also grows. Therefore, space debris detection is a particularly important task for space environment security, and then supports for space debris modeling, protection and mitigation. This paper aims to review space debris detection systematically and completely. Firstly, the research status of space debris detection at home and abroad is presented. Then, three kinds of optical observation methods of space debris are summarized. Finally, we propose a space-based detection scheme for space debris by photometric and polarimetric characteristics.\n\nAugmentation of UK Space Debris Observing Capabilities Using Univiersity Optical Telescopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerridge, Philip; Brown, David; Crowther, Richard\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe study of space debris requires a range of different sensors. Debris population monitoring requires survey, follow-on and characterisation capable sensors. In order to fully participate in space debris measurement the range of sensors available to the UK Space Agency needs to be augmented with additional capability. One source of untapped resource resides within the UK university sector. This paper discusses investigation into extending the optical sensor diversity available to the UK for participation in study of the debris environment through a collaboration between Space Insight Limited, a commercial company providing Space Situational Awareness (SSA) services to the UK Space Agency, and the Astronomy Group at the University of St Andrews.\n\nSpace Debris Senso\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-11\n\nOrbital debris poses a risk to all spacecraft in Earth orbit, so the International Space Station is getting a new debris impact sensor to provide information on the micrometeoroid orbital debris environment in low Earth orbit. The Space Debris Sensor, launching on the next SpaceX Dragon cargo vehicle, will monitor impacts caused by small-scale orbital debris for a period of two to three years. That data will improve station safety by generating a more accurate estimate of the amount of small-scale debris that cannot be tracked from the ground and helping define better spacecraft shielding requirements. _______________________________________ FOLLOW THE SPACE STATION!

It also can be used to observe space debris. The orbit determination process was planned with batch least square orbit estimator for every week. The optical tracking window is very narrow, several times per week. Sequentialbatch type estimation strategy was attempted for more reliable orbit prediction. We compared the test operation results with Two Line Elements and CPF files to validate the system. This results can be used to estimate the performance of the OWL-Net operations. And also we had observation of the Astro-H debris. We got the dozens of photometric data of the Astro-H debris main part for a few seconds with the chopper system.\n\nHubble Space Telescope Observations of the HD 202628 Debris Disk\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKrist, John E.; Stapelfeldt, Karl R.; Bryden, Geoffrey; Plavchan, Peter\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA ring-shaped debris disk around the G2V star HD 202628 (d = 24.4 pc) was imaged in scattered light at visible wavelengths using the coronagraphic mode of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The ring is inclined by approx.64deg from face-on, based on the apparent major/minor axis ratio, with the major axis aligned along PA = 130deg. It has inner and outer radii (> 50% maximum surface brightness) of 139 AU and 193 AU in the northwest ansae and 161 AU and 223 AU in the southeast ((Delta)r/r approx. = 0.4). The maximum visible radial extent is approx. 254 AU. With a mean surface brightnesses of V approx. = 24 mag arcsec.(sup -2), this is the faintest debris disk observed to date in reflected light. The center of the ring appears offset from the star by approx.28 AU (deprojected). An ellipse fit to the inner edge has an eccentricity of 0.18 and a = 158 AU. This offset, along with the relatively sharp inner edge of the ring, suggests the influence of a planetary-mass companion. There is a strong similarity with the debris ring around Fomalhaut, though HD 202628 is a more mature star with an estimated age of about 2 Gyr. We also provide surface brightness limits for nine other stars in our study with strong Spitzer excesses around which no debris disks were detected in scattered light (HD 377, HD 7590, HD 38858, HD 45184, HD 73350, HD 135599, HD 145229, HD 187897, and HD 201219).\n\nHubble Space Telescope Observations of the HD 202628 Debris Disk\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrist, John E.; Stapelfeldt, Karl R.; Bryden, Geoffrey; Plavchan, Peter\n\n2012-08-01\n\nA ring-shaped debris disk around the G2V star HD 202628 (d = 24.4 pc) was imaged in scattered light at visible wavelengths using the coronagraphic mode of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.

Some spacecraft, like the International Space Station, are now armored to deal with this hazard but armor and mitigation measures can be prohibitively costly when trying to protect satellites or human spaceflight vehicles like the shuttle. This paper describes the current orbital debris environment, outline its main sources, and identify mitigation measures to reduce orbital debris growth by controlling these sources. We studied the literature on the topic Space Debris. We have proposed some methods to solve this problem of space debris. We have also highlighted the shortcomings of already proposed methods by space experts and we have proposed some modification in those methods. Some of them can be very effective in the process of mitigation of space debris, but some of them need some modification. Recently proposed methods by space experts are maneuver, shielding of space elevator with the foil, vaporizing or redirecting of space debris back to earth with the help of laser, use of aerogel as a protective layer, construction of large junkyards around international space station, use of electrodynamics tether & the latest method proposed is the use of nano satellites in the clearing of the space debris. Limitations of the already proposed methods are as follows: - Maneuvering can't be the final solution to our problem as it is the act of self-defence. - Shielding can't be done on the parts like solar panels and optical devices. - Vaporizing or redirecting of space debris can affect the human life on earth if it is not done in proper manner. - Aerogel has a threshold limit up to which it can bear (resist) the impact of collision. - Large junkyards can be effective only for large sized debris. In this paper we propose: A.

Remote sensing, earth observation, and communication are among the areas in which this growing industry is facing competition and declining government money. A project like International Space Station, which draws from public money, has not only opened a window of real multinational cooperation, but also changed space travel from a mere fantasy into a real world activity. Besides research activities for sending man to moon and Mars and other outer planets, space travel has attracted a considerable attention in recent years in the form of space tourism. Four countries from space fairing nations are actively involved in the development of space tourism. Even, nations which are either in early stages of space technology development or just beginning their space activities, have high ambitions in this area. This is worth noting considering their limited resources. At present, trips to space are available, but limited and expensive. To move beyond this point to generally available trips to orbit and week long stays in LEO, in orbital hotels, some of the required basic transportations, living requirements, and technological developments required for long stay in orbit are already underway. For tourism to develop to a real everyday business, not only the price has to come down to meaningful levels, but also safety considerations should be fully developed to attract travelers' trust. A serious hazard to space activities in general and space tourism in particular is space debris in earth orbit. Orbiting debris are man-made objects left over by space operations, hazardous to space missions. Since the higher density of debris population occurs in low earth orbit, which is also the same orbit of interest to space tourism, a careful attention should be paid to the effect of debris on tourism activities. In this study, after a\n\nSpace Shuttle Debris Transport\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGomez, Reynaldo J., III\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis slide presentation reviews the assessment of debris damage to the Space Shuttle, and the use of computation to assist in the space shuttle applications. The presentation reviews the sources of debris, a mechanism for determining the probability of damaging debris impacting the shuttle, tools used, eliminating potential damaging debris sources, the use of computation to assess while inflight damage, and a chart showing the applications that have been used on increasingly powerful computers simulate the shuttle and the debris transport.\n\nObservations of Human-Made Debris in Earth Orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCowardia, Heather\n\n2011-01-01\n\nOrbital debris is defined as any human-made object in orbit about the Earth that no longer serves a useful purpose. Beginning in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1, there have been more than 4,700 launches, with each launch increasing the potential for impacts from orbital debris. Almost 55 years later there are over 16,000 catalogued objects in orbit over 10 cm in size. Agencies world-wide have realized this is a growing issue for all users of the space environment. To address the orbital debris issue, the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) was established to collaborate on monitoring, characterizing, and modeling orbital debris, as well as formulating policies and procedures to help control the risk of collisions and population growth. One area of fundamental interest is measurements of the space debris environment. NASA has been utilizing radar and optical measurements to survey the different orbital regimes of space debris for over 25 years, as well as using returned surfaces to aid in determining the flux and size of debris that are too small to detect with ground-based sensors. This paper will concentrate on the optical techniques used by NASA to observe the space debris environment, specifically in the Geosynchronous earth Orbit (GEO) region where radar capability is severely limited.\n\nHarnessing Orbital Debris to Sense the Space Environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMutschler, S.; Axelrad, P.; Matsuo, T.\n\nA key requirement for accurate space situational awareness (SSA) is knowledge of the non-conservative forces that act on space objects. These effects vary temporally and spatially, driven by the dynamical behavior of space weather. Existing SSA algorithms adjust space weather models based on observations of calibration satellites. However, lack of sufficient data and mismodeling of non-conservative forces cause inaccuracies in space object motion prediction. The uncontrolled nature of debris makes it particularly sensitive to the variations in space weather. Our research takes advantage of this behavior by inverting observations of debris objects to infer the space environment parameters causing their motion. In addition, this research will produce more accurate predictions of the motion of debris objects. The hypothesis of this research is that it is possible to utilize a \"cluster\" of debris objects, objects within relatively close proximity of each other, to sense their local environment. We focus on deriving parameters of an atmospheric density model to more precisely predict the drag force on LEO objects. An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used for assimilation; the prior ensemble to the posterior ensemble is transformed during the measurement update in a manner that does not require inversion of large matrices. A prior ensemble is utilized to empirically determine the nonlinear relationship between measurements and density parameters. The filter estimates an extended state that includes position and velocity of the debris object, and atmospheric density parameters. The density is parameterized as a grid of values, distributed by latitude and local sidereal time over a spherical shell encompassing Earth. This research focuses on LEO object motion, but it can also be extended to additional orbital regimes for observation and refinement of magnetic field and solar radiation models. An observability analysis of the proposed approach is presented in terms of the\n\nActivities on space debris in Europe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFlury, W.\n\n2001-10-01\n\nActivities on space debris in Europe are carried out by ESA, by national space agencies such as ASI (Italy), BNSC (United Kingdom), CNES (France) and DLR (Germany) and by various research groups. The objectives of ESA's activities in the field of space debris have been defined by the Council of ESA in 1989, and were updated in 2000 with the adoption of the Resolution for a European policy on the protection of the space environment from debris. ESA's debris-related activities comprise research, application of debris mitigation measures and international cooperation. The research activities address the knowledge of the terrestrial particulate environment, risk assessment, hypervelocity impacts and protection, and preventative measures. In all these areas substantial progress has been achieved. Examples are the MASTER 99 model, the DISCOS database, beam-park experiments with the FGAN radar, the discovery of a small-size debris population in GEO with the Space Debris telescope at the Teide observatory, and the GORID dust detector in the geostationary orbit. The ESA Space Debris Mitigation Handbook was issued, and in a joint effort of ESA and the national agencies ASI, BNSC, CNES and DLR the European Space Debris Safety and Mitigation Standard (draft) was established. This standard will be harmonized with standards of other agencies through the deliberations in the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). In order to strengthen the European cooperation, the pilot network of centers - Working Group on Space Debris was created in 2000. The members are ESA, ASI, BNSC, CNES and DLR. An integrated work plan has been established for the period 2001-2003. Global cooperation among the space-faring nations is achieved through the IADC. ESA and its Member States strongly support the deliberations on space debris within the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS).\n\nSpace Debris Mitigation CONOPS Development\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-06-01\n\nSPACE DEBRIS MITIGATION CONOPS DEVELOPMENT THESIS Earl B.

Accumulation of objects in earth orbit threatens space systems through the possibility of collisions and runaway debris multiplication. The amount of debris in orbit is uncertain due to the lack of information on the population of debris between 1 and 10 centimeters diameter. Collisions with debris even smaller than 1 cm can be catastrophic due to the high orbital velocities involved. Research efforts are under way at NASA, United States Space Command and the Air Force Phillips Laboratory to detect and catalog the debris population in near-earth space. Current international and national laws are inadequate to control the proliferation of space debris. Space debris is a serious problem with large economic, military, technical and diplomatic components. Actions need to be taken now to: determine the full extent of the orbital debris problem; accurately predict the future evolution of the debris population; decide the extent of the debris mitigation procedures required; implement these policies on a global basis via an international treaty. Action must be initiated now, before the loss of critical space systems such as the space shuttle or the space station.\n\nOrbiting space debris: Dangers, measurement, and mitigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcNutt, Ross T.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nSpace debris is a growing environmental problem.

Space debris is a serious problem with large economic, military, technical, and diplomatic components. Actions need to be taken now for the following reasons: determine the full extent of the orbital debris problem; accurately predict the future evolution of the debris population; decide the extent of the debris mitigation procedures required; implement these policies on a global basis via an international treaty. Action must be initiated now, before the the loss of critical space systems such as the Space Shuttle or the Space Station.\n\nElectron microscope observations of impact crater debris amongst contaminating particulates on materials surfaces exposed in space in low-Earth orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMurr, L. E.; Rivas, J. M.; Quinones, S.; Niou, C.-S.; Advani, A. H.; Marquez, B.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nDebris particles extracted from a small sampling region on the leading edge of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) spacecraft have been examined by analytical transmission electron microscopy and the elemental frequency observed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and compared with upper atmosphere (Earth) particle elemental frequency and the average elemental compositions of interplanetary dust particles. A much broader elemental distribution was observed for the exposed spacecraft surface debris milieu. Numerous metal microfragment analyses, particularly aluminum and stainless steel, were compared with scanning electron microscope observations-of impact crater features, and the corresponding elemental spectra on selected LDEF aluminium tray clamps and stainless steel bolts. The compositions and melt features for these impact craters and ejecta have been shown to be consistent with microcrystalline debris fragments in the case of aluminum, and these observations suggest an ever changing debris milieu on exposed surfaces for space craft and space system materials.\n\nSpace Debris Modeling at NASA\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nSince the Second European Conference on Space Debris in 1997, the Orbital Debris Program Office at the NASA Johnson Space Center has undertaken a major effort to update and improve the principal software tools employed to model the space debris environment and to evaluate mission risks. NASA's orbital debris engineering model, ORDEM, represents the current and near-term Earth orbital debris population from the largest spacecraft to the smallest debris in a manner which permits spacecraft engineers and experimenters to estimate the frequency and velocity with which a satellite may be struck by debris of different sizes. Using expanded databases and a new program design, ORDEM2000 provides a more accurate environment definition combined with a much broader array of output products in comparison with its predecessor, ORDEM96. Studies of the potential long-term space debris environment are now conducted with EVOLVE 4.0, which incorporates significant advances in debris characterization and breakup modeling. An adjunct to EVOLVE 4.0, GEO EVOLVE has been created to examine debris issues near the geosynchronous orbital regime. In support of NASA Safety Standard 1740.14, which establishes debris mitigation guidelines for all NASA space programs, a set of evaluation tools called the Debris Assessment Software (DAS) is specifically designed for program offices to determine whether they are in compliance with NASA debris mitigation guidelines. DAS 1.5 has recently been released with improved WINDOWS compatibility and graphics functions. DAS 2.0 will incorporate guideline changes in a forthcoming revision to NASA Safety Standard 1740.14. Whereas DAS contains a simplified model to calculate possible risks associated with satellite reentries, NASA's higher fidelity Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool (ORSAT) has been upgraded to Version 5.0. With the growing awareness of the potential risks posed by uncontrolled satellite reentries to people and property on Earth, the\n\nSpace Debris: Its Causes and Management\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nOrbital debris is internationally recognized as an environmental issue which needs to be addressed today to preserve near-Earth space for future generations. All major space agencies are committed to mitigating the growth of the debris environment. Many commercial space system operators have responded positively to orbital debris mitigation principles and recommendations. Orbital debris mitigation measures are most cost-effective if included in the design development phase.\n\nSpace Debris Environment Remediation Concepts\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.; Klinkrad, Heiner\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLong-term projections of the space debris environment indicate that even drastic measures, such as an immediate, complete halt of launch and release activities, will not result in a stable environment of man-made space objects. Collision events between already existing space hardware will within a few decades start to dominate the debris population, and result in a net increase of the space debris population, also in size regimes which may cause further catastrophic collisions. Such a collisional cascading will ultimately lead to a run-away situation (\"Kessler syndrome\"), with no further possibility of human intervention. The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) has been investigating the status and the stability of the space debris environment in several studies by first looking into space traffic management possibilities and then investigating means of mitigating the creation of space debris. In an ongoing activity, an IAA study group looks at ways of active space debris environment remediation. In contrast to the former mitigation study, the current activity concentrates on the active removal of small and large objects, such as defunct spacecraft, orbital stages, and mission-related objects, which serve as a latent mass reservoir that fuels initial catastrophic collisions and later collisional cascading. The paper will outline different mass removal concepts, e.g. based on directed energy, tethers (momentum exchange or electrodynamic), aerodynamic drag augmentation, solar sails, auxiliary propulsion units, retarding surfaces, or on-orbit capture. Apart from physical principles of the proposed concepts, their applicability to different orbital regimes, and their effectiveness concerning mass removal efficiency will be analyzed. The IAA activity on space debris environment remediation is a truly international project which involves more than 23 contributing authors from 9 different nations.\n\nSmall satellites and space debris issues\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYakovlev, M.; Kulik, S.; Agapov, V.\n\n2001-10-01\n\nThe objective of this report is the analysis of the tendencies in designing of small satellites (SS) and the effect of small satellites on space debris population. It is shown that SS to include nano- and pico-satellites should be considered as a particularly dangerous source of space debris when elaborating international standards and legal documents concerning the space debris problem, in particular \"International Space Debris Mitigation Standard\". These issues are in accordance with the IADC goals in its main activity areas and should be carefully considered within the IADC framework.\n\nExternal tank space debris considerations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElfer, N.; Baillif, F.; Robinson, J.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nOrbital debris issues associated with maintaining a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) on orbit are presented. The first issue is to ensure that the ET does not become a danger to other spacecraft by generating space debris, and the second is to protect the pressurized ET from penetration by space debris or meteoroids. Tests on shield designs for penetration resistance showed that when utilized with an adequate bumper, thermal protection system foam on the ET is effective in preventing penetration.\n\nStreakDet data processing and analysis pipeline for space debris optical observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVirtanen, Jenni; Flohrer, Tim; Muinonen, Karri; Granvik, Mikael; Torppa, Johanna; Poikonen, Jonne; Lehti, Jussi; Santti, Tero; Komulainen, Tuomo; Naranen, Jyri\n\nWe describe a novel data processing and analysis pipeline for optical observations of space debris. The monitoring of space object populations requires reliable acquisition of observational data, to support the development and validation of space debris environment models, the build-up and maintenance of a catalogue of orbital elements. In addition, data is needed for the assessment of conjunction events and for the support of contingency situations or launches. The currently available, mature image processing algorithms for detection and astrometric reduction of optical data cover objects that cross the sensor field-of-view comparably slowly, and within a rather narrow, predefined range of angular velocities. By applying specific tracking techniques, the objects appear point-like or as short trails in the exposures. However, the general survey scenario is always a âtrack before detectâ problem, resulting in streaks, i.e., object trails of arbitrary lengths, in the images. The scope of the ESA-funded StreakDet (Streak detection and astrometric reduction) project is to investigate solutions for detecting and reducing streaks from optical images, particularly in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) domain, where algorithms are not readily available yet. For long streaks, the challenge is to extract precise position information and related registered epochs with sufficient precision. Although some considerations for low-SNR processing of streak-like features are available in the current image processing and computer vision literature, there is a need to discuss and compare these approaches for space debris analysis, in order to develop and evaluate prototype implementations. In the StreakDet project, we develop algorithms applicable to single images (as compared to consecutive frames of the same field) obtained with any observing scenario, including space-based surveys and both low- and high-altitude populations. The proposed processing pipeline starts from the\n\nSpace program: Space debris a potential threat to Space Station and shuttle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchwartz, Stephen A.; Beers, Ronald W.; Phillips, Colleen M.; Ramos, Yvette\n\n1990-01-01\n\nExperts estimate that more than 3.5 million man-made objects are orbiting the earth. These objects - space debris - include whole and fragmentary parts of rocket bodies and other discarded equipment from space missions. About 24,500 of these objects are 1 centimeter across or larger. A 1-centimeter man-made object travels in orbit at roughly 22,000 miles per hour. If it hit a spacecraft, it would do about the same damage as would a 400-pound safe traveling at 60 miles per hour. The Government Accounting Office (GAO) reviews NASA's plans for protecting the space station from debris, the extent and precision of current NASA and Defense Department (DOD) debris-tracking capabilities, and the extent to which debris has already affected shuttle operations. GAO recommends that the space debris model be updated, and that the findings be incorporated into the plans for protecting the space station from such debris. GAO further recommends that the increased risk from debris to the space shuttle operations be analyzed.\n\nOptical Observation of LEO Debris Caused by Feng Yun 1C\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKurosaki, Hirohisa; Yanagisawa, Toshifumi; Nakajima, Atsushi\n\nMany pieces of space debris are in low earth orbit (LEO), and may be a serious problem in the near future. They are very hazardous to spacecraft such as the ISS, in which humans stay for long periods. In January 2007, China performed an experimental destruction of the meteorological satellite FengYun-1C in low earth orbit using a ballistic missile. Optical instruments for space debris observation were installed on Mt. Nyukasa in Nagano Prefecture by JAXA, and the resulting low earth orbit debris was observed with the small telescope there. We have developed an image-processing technique, the line-detection method, to extract such effects as the streaks created by meteors, LEO satellites, and LEO debris. We succeeded in detecting the trajectories of specified FengYun-1C debris whose TLE were known. In this paper, the detection and observation of low earth orbit debris are discussed.\n\nMicrochemical Analysis Of Space Operation Debris\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCummings, Virginia J.; Kim, Hae Soo\n\n1995-01-01\n\nReport discusses techniques used in analyzing debris relative to space shuttle operations.

A review of the current (and near-future) mitigation guidelines, handbooks, standards and licensing procedures has identified a number of areas where further work is required. In order for space debris mitigation to be implemented in spacecraft manufacture and operation, the authors suggest that debris-related criteria need to become design parameters (following the same process as applied to reliability and radiation). To meet these parameters, spacecraft manufacturers and operators will need processes (supported by design tools and databases and implementation standards). A particular aspect of debris mitigation, as compared with conventional requirements (e.g. radiation and reliability) is the current and near-future national and international regulatory framework and associated liability aspects. A framework for these implementation standards is presented, in addition to results of in-house research and development on design tools and databases (including collision avoidance in GTO and SSTO and evaluation of failure criteria on composite and aluminium structures).\n\nSpace Shuttle Main Engine Debris Testing Methodology and Impact Tolerances\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGradl, Paul R.; Stephens, Walter\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn the wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster every effort is being made to determine the susceptibility of Space Shuttle elements to debris impacts. Ice and frost debris is formed around the aft heat shield closure of the orbiter and liquid hydrogen feedlines. This debris has been observed to liberate upon lift-off of the shuttle and presents potentially dangerous conditions to the Space Shuttle Main Engine. This paper describes the testing done to determine the impact tolerance of the Space Shuttle Main Engine nozzle coolant tubes to ice strikes originating from the launch pad or other parts of the shuttle.\n\nActivities on Space Debris in U.S.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn the U.S. space debris activities are addressed at all government levels, from the Executive Office of the President to the individual federal agencies to specialized centers, laboratories, organizations, and research groups. U.S. Space Policy specifically challenges government agencies to seek to minimize the creation of space debris and to promote debris minimization practices both domestically and internationally. A set of space debris mitigation standard practices has been developed and adopted by relevant US government agencies, and their application by the commercial aerospace community is highly encouraged. A growing number of US government agencies have issued their own space debris mitigation policies, directives, regulations, and standards. Space debris research, including the definition and modeling of the current and future near-Earth space environment and the development of debris protection technologies, is principally conducted by NASA and the Department of Defense. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network continues to provide the most complete and timely characterization of the population of space debris larger than 10 cm. During the past several years major advancements have been achieved in extending this environment definition in LEO to include particles as small as only a few millimeters. The inspection of returned spacecraft surfaces continues to shed light on the even smaller debris population. With improvements in computer technology, new and more capable programs have been and are being developed to solve a number of operational and research problems. Finally, the academic and industrial sectors of the U.S. are also increasing their participation in and contributions to space debris operations and research. The cooperation of satellite and launch vehicle developers and operators is essential to the U.S. objective of promoting the preservation of the space environment for future generations.\n\nActivities on space debris in U.S.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.\n\n2001-10-01\n\nIn the U.S. space debris activities are addressed at all government levels, from the Executive Office of the President to the individual federal agencies to specialized centers, laboratories, organizations, and research groups.

The instruments onboard MSX include an infrared telescope, an infrared interferometer, a visible telescope, an ultraviolet telescope and a spectroscopic imager. The spacecraft carries calibration spheres for instrument calibration and atmospheric drag studies. The experimental program, the implementation aspects, the data reduction techniques and the preliminary results are described.\n\nThe International Space Station and the Space Debris Environment: 10 Years On\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas; Klinkrad, Heiner\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFor just over a decade the International Space Station (ISS), the most heavily protected vehicle in Earth orbit, has weathered the space debris environment well. Numerous hypervelocity impact features on the surface of ISS caused by small orbital debris and meteoroids have been observed. In addition to typical impacts seen on the large solar arrays, craters have been discovered on windows, hand rails, thermal blankets, radiators, and even a visiting logistics module. None of these impacts have resulted in any degradation of the operation or mission of the ISS. Validating the rate of small particle impacts on the ISS as predicted by space debris environment models is extremely complex. First, the ISS has been an evolving structure, from its original 20 metric tons to nearly 300 metric tons (excluding logistics vehicles) ten years later. Hence, the anticipated space debris impact rate has grown with the increasing size of ISS. Secondly, a comprehensive visual or photographic examination of the complete exterior of ISS has never been accomplished. In fact, most impact features have been discovered serendipitously. Further complications include the estimation of the size of an impacting particle without knowing its mass, velocity, and angle of impact and the effect of shadowing by some ISS components. Inadvertently and deliberately, the ISS has also been the source of space debris. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network officially cataloged 65 debris from ISS from November 1998 to November 2008: from lost cameras, sockets, and tool bags to intentionally discarded equipment and an old space suit. Fortunately, the majority of these objects fall back to Earth quickly with an average orbital lifetime of less than two months and a maximum orbital lifetime of a little more than 15 months. The cumulative total number of debris object-years is almost exactly 10, the equivalent of one piece of debris remaining in orbit for 10 years. An unknown number of debris too small to be\n\nSpace Debris and Space Safety - Looking Forward\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAilor, W.; Krag, H.\n\nMan's activities in space are creating a shell of space debris around planet Earth which provides a growing risk of collision with operating satellites and manned systems. Including both the larger tracked objects and the small, untracked debris, more than 98% of the estimated 600,000 objects larger than 1 cm currently in orbit are âspace junkâ--dead satellites, expended rocket stages, debris from normal operations, fragments from explosions and collisions, and other material. Recognizing the problem, space faring nations have joined together to develop three basic principles for minimizing the growth of the debris population: prevent on-orbit breakups, remove spacecraft and orbital stages that have reached the end of their mission operations from the useful densely populated orbit regions, and limit the objects released during normal operations. This paper provides an overview of what is being done to support these three principles and describes proposals that an active space traffic control service to warn satellite operators of pending collisions with large objects combined with a program to actively remove large objects may reduce the rate of future collisions. The paper notes that cost and cost effectiveness are important considerations that will affect the evolution of such systems.\n\nDevelopment of the Space Debris Sensor (SDS)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamilton, Joe; Liou, J. -C.; Anz-Meador, P.; Matney, M.; Christiansen, E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDebris Resistive/Acoustic Grid Orbital Navy-NASA Sensor (DRAGONS) is an impact sensor designed to detect and characterize collisions with small orbital debris: from 50 microns to greater than 1millimeter debris size detection; Characterizes debris size, speed, direction, and density. The Space Debris Sensor (SDS) is a flight demonstration of DRAGONS on the International Space Station: Approximately 1 square meter of detection area facing the ISS velocity vector; Minimum two year mission on Columbus External Payloads Facility (EPF); Minimal obstruction from ISS hardware; Development is nearing final checkout and integration with the ISS; Current launch schedule is SpaceX13, about September 2017, or SpaceX14, about Jan 2018.\n\nFirst laser measurements to space debris in Poland\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLejba, PaweÅ; Suchodolski, Tomasz; MichaÅek, Piotr; Bartoszak, Jacek; Schillak, StanisÅaw; ZapaÅnik, StanisÅaw\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe Borowiec Satellite Laser Ranging station (BORL 7811, Borowiec) being a part of the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences (SRC PAS) went through modernization in 2014-2015. One of the main tasks of the modernization was the installation of a high-energy laser module dedicated to space debris tracking. Surelite III by Continuum is a Nd:YAG pulse laser with 10 Hz repetition rate, a pulse width of 3-5 ns and a pulse energy of 450 mJ for green (532 nm). This new laser unit was integrated with the SLR system at Borowiec performing standard satellite tracking. In 2016 BORL 7811 participated actively to the observational campaigns related to the space debris targets from LEO region managed by the Space Debris Study Group (SDSG) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS). Currently, Borowiec station regularly tracks 36 space debris from the LEO regime, including typical rocket bodies (Russian/Chinese) and cooperative targets like the inactive TOPEX/Poseidon, ENVISAT, OICETS and others. In this paper the first results of space debris laser measurements obtained by the Borowiec station in period August 2016 - January 2017 are presented. The results gained by the SRC PAS Borowiec station confirm the rotation of the defunct TOPEX/Poseidon satellite which spins with a period of approximately 10 s. The novelty of this work is the presentation of the sample results of the Chinese CZ-2C R/B target (NORAD catalogue number 31114) which is equipped (probably) with retroreflectors. Laser measurements to space debris is a very desirable topic for the next years, especially in the context of the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) activity. Some targets are very easy to track like defunct ENVISAT or TOPEX/Poseidon. On the other hand, there is a big population of different LEO targets with different orbital and physical parameters, which are challenging for laser ranging like small irregular debris and rocket boosters.\n\nSpace Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Debris Assessment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKendall, Kristin; Kanner, Howard; Yu, Weiping\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Space Shuttle Columbia Accident revealed a fundamental problem of the Space Shuttle Program regarding debris. Prior to the tragedy, the Space Shuttle requirement stated that no debris should be liberated that would jeopardize the flight crew and/or mission success. When the accident investigation determined that a large piece of foam debris was the primary cause of the loss of the shuttle and crew, it became apparent that the risk and scope of - damage that could be caused by certain types of debris, especially - ice and foam, were not fully understood. There was no clear understanding of the materials that could become debris, the path the debris might take during flight, the structures the debris might impact or the damage the impact might cause. In addition to supporting the primary NASA and USA goal of returning the Space Shuttle to flight by understanding the SRB debris environment and capability to withstand that environment, the SRB debris assessment project was divided into four primary tasks that were required to be completed to support the RTF goal. These tasks were (1) debris environment definition, (2) impact testing, (3) model correlation and (4) hardware evaluation. Additionally, the project aligned with USA's corporate goals of safety, customer satisfaction, professional development and fiscal accountability.\n\nUniSat-5: a space-based optical system for space debris monitoring\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDi Roberto, Riccardo; Cappelletti, Chantal\n\n2012-07-01\n\nMicro-satellite missions, thanks to the miniaturization process of electronic components, now have a broader range of applications. Gauss Group at School of Aerospace Engineering has been a pioneer in educational micro-satellites, namely with UNISAT and EDUSAT missions. Moreover it has been long involved in space debris related studies, such as optical observations as well as mitigation. A new project is under development for a compact digital imaging system. The purpose will be in situ observation of space debris on board Unisat-5 micro-satellite. One of the key elements of observing on orbit is that many atmospheric phenomena would be avoided, such as diffraction and EM absorption. Hence images would gain more contrast and solar spectral irradiance would be higher for the whole visible spectrum Earlier limitations of power and instrument size prevented the inclusion of these payloads in educational satellite missions. The system is composed of an optical tube, a camera, C band and S band transceivers and two antennas. The system is independent from the rest of the spacecraft. The optical tube is a Schmidt-Cassegrain reflector, and the magnitude limit is 13. The camera is equipped with a panchromatic 5Mpix sensor, capable of direct video streaming, as well as local storage of recorded images. The transceivers operate on ISM 2.4GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands, and they provide stand-alone communication capabilities to the payload, and Unisat-5 OBDH can switch between the two. Both transceivers are connected to their respective custom-designed patch antenna. The ground segment is constituted of a high gain antenna dish, which will use the same transceiver on board the spacecraft as the feed, in order to establish a TCP/IP wireless link. Every component of this system is a consumer grade product. Therefore price reduction of cutting edge imaging technology now allows the use of professional instruments, that combined with the new wireless technology developed for\n\nMan-made space debris - Does it restrict free access to space\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWolfe, M.; Chobotov, V.; Kessler, D.; Reynolds, R.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nConsideration is given to the hazards posed by existing and future man-made space debris to spacecraft operations. The components of the hazard are identified as those fragments resulting from spacecraft explosions and spent stages which can be tracked, those fragments which are too small to be tracked at their present distances, and future debris, which, if present trends in spacecraft design and operation continue, may lead to an unacceptably high probability of collision with operational spacecraft within a decade. It is argued that a coordinated effort must be undertaken by all space users to evaluate means of space debris control in order to allow for the future unrestricted use of near-earth space. A plan for immediate action to forestall the space debris problem by activities in the areas of education, debris monitoring and collection technology, space vehicle design, space operational procedures and practices and space policies and treaties is proposed.\n\nThe 1999 UNCOPUOS \"Technical report on space debris\" and the new work plan on space debris (2002 - 2005): perspectives and legal consequences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBenkÃ¶, Marietta; Schrogl, Kai-Uwe\n\n2001-10-01\n\nIn February 1999, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee (STSC) of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) adopted a \"Technical Report on Space Debris\". This was the result of intensive negotiations during a multi-year workplan on space debris, which had been the centerpiece of the technical work of the STSC during these years. The Report is the first document on space debris, presenting the status of space debris research and the problems resulting from space debris. It has the status of an analysis accepted by all governments. Following its adoption, the Report was presented to UNISPACE III and provided the basis for discussions in this Inter-governmental Conference as well as in the Technical Forum, which - at the same time - dealt with the technical as well as the legal aspects of the exploration and use of outer space. The adoption of the Conference Report finalized the workplan in the STSC, but the subject of space debris still remains on the agenda, where until now every year a special aspect is discussed in detail. The Report does not suggest the establishment of an agenda item \"space debris\" in the UNCOPUOS Legal Subcommittee (LSC). It is very reluctant in even mentioning legal aspects of the space debris issue. The strict and full concentration on technical aspects was a precondition made by a number of Member States for their constructive participation in the elaboration to establish an agenda item on space debris there, were completely detached from that process. Those, who had expected that the adoption of the Report would inevitably lead to formal negotiations in the LSC were deceived so far. Nevertheless, the Report provides a number of starting points for drafting regulation concerning the prevention of space debris as well as debris mitigation measures which also built on work already done by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and its member agencies.

To reduce the risks to future space missions different debris mitigation measures and spacecraft protection techniques have been investigated during the last years. However, the economic efficiency has not been considered yet in this context. Current studies have the objective to evaluate the mission costs due to space debris in a business as usual (no mitigation) scenario compared to the missions costs considering debris mitigation. The aim is an estimation of the time until the investment in debris mitigation will lead to an effective reduction of mission costs. This paper presents the results of investigations on the key issues of cost estimation for spacecraft and the influence of debris mitigation and shielding on cost. Mitigation strategies like the reduction of orbital lifetime and de- or re-orbit of non-operational satellites are methods to control the space debris environment. These methods result in an increase of costs. In a first step the overall costs of different types of unmanned satellites are analyzed. A selected cost model is simplified and generalized for an application on all operational satellites. In a next step the influence of space debris on cost is treated, if the implementation of mitigation strategies is considered.\n\nLegal Consequences of the Pollution of Outer Space with Space Debris\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStubbe, Peter\n\n2017-07-01\n\nSpace debris has grown to be a significant problem for outer space activities. The remnants of human activities in space are very diverse; they can be tiny paint flakes, all sorts of fragments, or entirely intactâbut otherwise nonfunctional spacecraft and rocket bodies. The amount of debris is increasing at a growing pace, thus raising the risk of collision with operational satellites. Due to the relative high velocities involved in on-orbit collisions, their consequences are severe; collisions lead to significant damage or the complete destruction of the affected spacecraft. Protective measures and collision avoidance have thus become a major concern for spacecraft operators. The pollution of space with debris must, however, not only be seen as an unfavorable circumstance that accompanies space activities and increases the costs and complexity of outer space activities. Beyond this rather technical perspective, the presence of man-made, nonfunctional objects in space represents a global environmental concern. Similar to the patterns of other environmental problems on Earth, debris generation appears to have surpassed the absorption capacity of the space environment. Studies indicate that the evolution of the space object environment has crossed the tipping point to a runaway situation in which an increasing number of collisionsâmostly among debrisâleads to an uncontrolled population growth. It is thus in the interest of all mankind to address the debris problem in order to preserve the space environment for future generations. International space law protects the space environment. Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty obligates States to avoid the harmful contamination of outer space. The provision corresponds to the obligation to protect the environment in areas beyond national jurisdiction under the customary \"no harm\" rule of general environmental law. These norms are applicable to space debris and establish the duty not to pollute outer space by limiting\n\nMicro-satellite for space debris observation by optical sensors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThillot, Marc; BreniÃ¨re, Xavier; Midavaine, Thierry\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this theoretical study carried out under CNES contract is to analyze the feasibility of small space debris detection and classification with an optical sensor on-board micro-satellite. Technical solutions based on active and passive sensors are analyzed and compared. For the most appropriated concept an optimization was made and theoretical performances in terms of number of detection versus class of diameter were calculated. Finally we give some preliminary physical sensor features to illustrate the concept (weight, volume, consumption,â¦).\n\nInstrumentation development for space debris optical observation system in Indonesia: Preliminary results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDani, Tiar; Rachman, Abdul; Priyatikanto, Rhorom; Religia, Bahar\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAn increasing number of space junk in orbit has raised their chances to fall in Indonesian region. So far, three debris of rocket bodies have been found in Bengkulu, Gorontalo and Lampung. LAPAN has successfully developed software for monitoring space debris that passes over Indonesia with an altitude below 200 km. To support the software-based system, the hardware-based system has been developed based on optical instruments. The system has been under development in early 2014 which consist of two systems: the telescopic system and wide field system. The telescopic system uses CCD cameras and a reflecting telescope with relatively high sensitivity. Wide field system uses DSLR cameras, binoculars and a combination of CCD with DSLR Lens. Methods and preliminary results of the systems will be presented.\n\nCanadian Activities in Space Debris Mitigation Technologies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNikanpour, Darius; Jiang, Xin Xiang; Goroshin, Samuel; Haddad, Emile; Kruzelecky, Roman; Hoa, Suong; Merle, Philippe; Kleiman, Jacob; Gendron, Stephane; Higgins, Andrew; Jamroz, Wes\n\nThe space environment, and in particular the Low Earth Orbit (LEO), is becoming increasingly populated with space debris which include fragments of dysfunctional spacecraft parts and materials traveling at speeds up to 15 km per second. These pose an escalating potential threat to LEO spacecraft, the international space station, and manned missions. This paper presents the Canadian activities to address the concerns over space debris in terms of debris mitigation measures and technologies; these include novel spacecraft demise technologies to safely decommission the spacecraft at the end of the mission, integrated self-healing material technologies for spacecraft structures to facilitate self-repair and help maintain the spacecraft structural and thermal performance, hypervelocity ground test capability to predict the impact of space debris on spacecraft performance, and ways of raising awareness within the space community through participation in targeted Science and Technology conferences and international forums.\n\nComparison of national space debris mitigation standards\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKato, A.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nSeveral national organizations of the space faring nations have established Space Debris Mitigation Standards or Handbooks to promote efforts to deal with the space debris issue. This paper introduces the characteristics of each document and compares the structure, items and level of requirements. The contents of these standards may be slightly different from each other but the fundamental principles are almost the same; they are (1) prevention of on-orbit breakups, (2) removal of mission terminated spacecraft from the useful orbit regions, and (3) limiting the objects released during normal operations. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee has contributed considerably to this trend. The Committee also found out by its recent survey that some commercial companies have begun to adopt the debris mitigation measures for their projects. However, the number of organizations that have initiated this kind of self-control is still limited, so the next challenge of the Committee is to promote the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines world-wide. IADC initiated this project in October 1999 and a draft is being circulated among the member agencies.\n\nSpace debris protection: A standard procedure in future?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYasaka, Tetsuo\n\n2003-08-01\n\nThe near earth orbital environment is getting hazardous due to increasing space debris accumulated as a result of human space activities. Man tended facility is being designed so that the main structure may be protected from a collision with a limited size debris. Other space systems are generally found inadequate to possess protection shields because of functional requirement of space-viewing faces and cost burden in terms of added mass. In the future, where the debris hazard is expected to become severer, the situation is not expected to change and most space systems will be left unprotected. The present situation and future projection of the orbital debris environment will be first reviewed. The possible hazard to space systems will be described in terms of colliding debris size at various orbits.

Five objects were associated with this breakup and this is the fourth breakup known for this class of object. There are likely many more objects associated with this event that are not within the Space Surveillance Network's ability to detect and have not been catalogued. Several months after the breakup, observing time was obtained on the Magellan Baade 6.5 meter telescope to be used for observations of geosynchronous (GEO) space debris targets. Using the NASA Standard Satellite Breakup Model (SSBM), a simulated debris cloud of the recent Transtage breakup was produced and propagated forward in time. This provided right ascension, declination, and tracking rate predictions for where debris associated with this breakup may be more likely to be found in the sky over Magellan for our observing run. Magellan observations were then optimized using the angles and tracking rates from the model predictions to focus the search for Transtage debris. Data were collected and analysed and preliminary comparisons made between the number of objects detected and the number expected from the model. We present our results here.\n\nOrbiting Debris: a Space Environmental Problem. Background Paper\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1990-01-01\n\nArtificial debris, deposited in a multitude of orbits about the Earth as the result of the exploration and use of the space environment, poses a growing hazard to future space operations. Unless nations sharply reduce the amount of orbital debris they produce, future space activites could suffer loss of capability, loss of income, and even loss of life as a result of collisions between spacecraft and debris. This background paper discusses the sources of debris and how they can be greatly reduced.\n\nDevelopment of the Space Debris Sensor\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamilton, J.; Liou, J.-C.; Anz-Meador, P.

The SDS is the first flight demonstration of the Debris Resistive/Acoustic Grid Orbital NASA-Navy Sensor (DRAGONS) developed and matured by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. The DRAGONS concept combines several technologies to characterize the size, speed, direction, and density of small impacting objects. With a minimum two-year operational lifetime, SDS is anticipated to collect statistically significant information on orbital debris ranging from 50 micron to 500 micron in size.

To reduce the risks to future space missions different debris mitigation measures and spacecraft protection techniques have been investigated during the last years. However, the economic efficiency has not been considered yet in this context. This economical background is not always clear to satellite operators and the space industry. Current studies have the objective to evaluate the mission costs due to space debris in a business as usual (no mitigation) scenario compared to the missions costs considering debris mitigation. The aim i an estimation of thes time until the investment in debris mitigation will lead to an effective reduction of mission costs. This paper presents the results of investigations on the key problems of cost estimation for spacecraft and the influence of debris mitigation and shielding on cost. The shielding of a satellite can be an effective method to protect the spacecraft against debris impact. Mitigation strategies like the reduction of orbital lifetime and de- or re-orbit of non-operational satellites are methods to control the space debris environment. These methods result in an increase of costs. In a first step the overall costs of different types of unmanned satellites are analyzed. The key problem is, that it is not possible to provide a simple cost model that can be applied to all types of satellites. Unmanned spacecraft differ very much in mission, complexity of design, payload and operational lifetime. It is important to classify relevant cost parameters and investigate their influence on the respective mission. The theory of empirical cost estimation and existing cost models are discussed. A selected cost model is simplified and generalized for an application on all operational satellites. In a next step the influence of space debris on cost is treated, if the implementation of mitigation strategies is considered.\n\nRemoval of cellular debris formed in the Disse space in patients with cholestasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDubuisson, L; Bioulac-Sage, P; Boussarie, L; Quinton, A; Saric, J; de Mascarel, A; Balabaud, C\n\n1987-01-01\n\nUsing electron microscopy, we investigated how cellular debris, formed in the Disse space during cholestasis, was cleared. Ten patients with cholestasis of varied origin and severity were studied and compared with 10 controls without liver disease. In cholestatic patients, sinusoidal cells contained variable amounts of amylase PAS-positive material. In clean perfusion-fixed sinusoids the endothelial cells often appeared swollen and active, with few fenestrations. Hepatocyte blebs and cellular debris were sometimes seen in the Disse space. Two mechanisms were apparently involved in the clearing process: phagocytosis by macrophages either infiltrated into the Disse space, or forming the barrier; and the passage of debris from the Disse space into the sinusoidal lumen through the endothelial wall. Debris was either forced through enlarged pores or through the wall, with a progressive invagination followed by an outpouching in the lumen. The force, possibly provided by endothelial massage, may not be sufficient to push out cellular debris from the Disse space; morphological data seemed to indicate that endothelial damage may be a necessary factor. Debris present in the lumen was phagocytized by numerous active macrophages. Cellular debris was not observed in the Disse space of control patients.\n\nDevelopment of the Space Debris Sensor (SDS)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamilton, J.; Liou, J.-C.; Anz-Meador, P.

Different orbital regions and object's physical properties lead to different attitude states and their change over time. Since 2007 the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB) performs photometric measurements of space debris objects. To June 2016 almost 2000 light curves of more than 400 individual objects have been acquired and processed. These objects are situated in all orbital regions, from low Earth orbit (LEO), via global navigation systems orbits and high eccentricity orbit (HEO), to geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). All types of objects were observed including the non-functional spacecraft, rocket bodies, fragmentation debris and uncorrelated objects discovered during dedicated surveys. For data acquisition, we used the 1-meter Zimmerwald Laser and Astrometry Telescope (ZIMLAT) at the Swiss Optical Ground Station and Geodynamics Observatory Zimmerwald, Switzerland. We applied our own method of phase-diagram reconstruction to extract the apparent rotation period from the light curve. Presented is the AIUB's light curve database and the obtained rotation properties of space debris as a function of object type and orbit.\n\nESA Technologies for Space Debris Remediation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWormnes, K.; Le Letty, R.; Summerer, L.; Schonenborg, R.; Dubois-Matra, O.; Luraschi, E.; Cropp, A.; Krag, H.; Delaval, J.\n\n2013-08-01\n\nSpace debris is an existing and growing problem for space operations. Studies show that for a continued use of LEO, 5 - 10 large and strategically chosen debris need to be removed every year. The European Space Agency (ESA) is actively pursuing technologies and systems for space debris removal under its Clean Space initiative. This overview paper describes the activities that are currently ongoing at ESA and that have already been completed. Additionally it outlines the plan for the near future. The technologies under study fall in two main categories corresponding to whether a pushing or a pulling manoeuvre is required for the de-orbitation. ESA is studying the option of using a tethered capture system for controlled de-orbitation through pulling where the capture is performed using throw-nets or alternatively a harpoon. The Agency is also studying rigid capture systems with a particular emphasis on tentacles (potentially combined with a robotic arm). Here the de-orbitation is achieved through a push-manoeuvre. Additionally, a number of activities will be discussed that are ongoing to develop supporting technologies for these scenarios, or to develop systems for de-orbiting debris that can be allowed to re-enter in an uncontrolled manner. The short term goal and main driver for the current technology developments is to achieve sufficient TRL on required technologies to support a potential de-orbitation mission to remove a large and strategically chosen piece of debris.\n\nRecent Developments in Space Debris Mitigation Policy and Practices\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nIn recent years, emphasis has shifted from national efforts to control the space debris population to international ones. Here, too, great progress has been made, most notably by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) and the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) of the United Nations. Today, a firm international consensus is rapidly building on the principal space debris mitigation measures. The IADC is an association of the space agencies of ten countries (China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the European Space Agency, representing 17 countries of which four (France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom) are also full IADC members. At the 17th meeting of the IADC in October 1999, a new Action Item (AI 17.2) was adopted to develop a set of consensus space debris mitigation guidelines. The purpose of the activity was to identify the most valuable space debris mitigation measures and to reach an international agreement on common directives. The IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines (www.iadc-online.org/index.cgi?item=docs_pub) were formally adopted in October 2002 during the Second World Space Congress in Houston, Texas. Two years later a companion document, entitled Support to the IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines, was completed to provide background and clarification for the guidelines.\n\nAnalysis of a space debris laser removal system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGjesvold, Evan; Straub, Jeremy\n\n2017-05-01\n\nAs long as man ventures into space, he will leave behind debris, and as long as he ventures into space, this debris will pose a threat to him and his projects. Space debris must be located and decommissioned. Lasers may prove to be the ideal method, as they can operate at a distance from the debris, have a theoretically infinite supply of energy from the sun, and are a seemingly readily available technology. This paper explores the requirements and reasoning for such a laser debris removal method. A case is made for the negligibility of eliminating rotational velocity from certain systems, while a design schematic is also presented for the implementation of a cube satellite proof of concept.\n\nNeed for a network of observatories for space debris dynamical and physical characterization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPiergentili, Fabrizio; Santoni, Fabio; Castronuovo, Marco; Portelli, Claudio; Cardona, Tommaso; Arena, Lorenzo; ScirÃ©, Gioacchino; Seitzer, Patrick\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSpace debris represents a major concern for space missions since the risk of impact with uncontrolled objects has increased dramatically in recent years. Passive and active mitigation countermeasures are currently under consideration but, at the base of any of such corrective actions is the space debris continuous monitoring through ground based surveillance systems.At the present, many space agencies have the capability to get optical measurements of space orbiting objects mainly relaying on single observatories. The recent research in the field of space debris, demonstrated how it is possible to increase the effectiveness of optical measurements exploitation by using joint observations of the same target from different sites.The University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", in collaboration with Italian Space Agency (ASI), is developing a scientific network of observatories dedicated to Space Debris deployed in Italy (S5Scope at Rome and SPADE at Matera) and in Kenya at the Broglio Space Center in Malindi (EQUO). ASI founded a program dedicated to space debris, in order to spread the Italian capability to deal with different aspects of this issue. In this framework, the University of Rome is in charge of coordinating the observatories network both in the operation scheduling and in the data analysis. This work describes the features of the observatories dedicated to space debris observation, highlighting their capabilities and detailing their instrumentation. Moreover, the main features of the scheduler under development, devoted to harmonizing the operations of the network, will be shown. This is a new system, which will autonomously coordinate the observations, aiming to optimize results in terms of number of followed targets, amount of time dedicated to survey, accuracy of orbit determination and feasibility of attitude determination through photometric data.Thus, the authors will describe the techniques developed and applied (i) to implement the multi-site orbit\n\nSpace Debris Mitigation Guidelines\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnson, Nicholas L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of national and international space debris mitigation guides is to promote the preservation of near-Earth space for applications and exploration missions far into the future. To accomplish this objective, the accumulation of objects, particularly in long-lived orbits, must be eliminated or curtailed.\n\nUSA Space Debris Environment, Operations, and Research Updates\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLiou, J.-C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSpace Missions in 2017 Earth Satellite Population Collision Avoidance Maneuvers Post mission Disposal of U.S.A.

The Chinese anti-satellite test in January 2007 and the accidental collision of two spacecraft in February 2009 created more than 4000 new cataloged debris, representing an increase of 40% of the official U.S. Satellite Catalog. The frequency of collision avoidance maneuvers for both human space flight and robotic operations is increasing along with the orbital debris population. However, the principal threat to space operations is driven by the smaller and much more numerous uncataloged debris. Although the U.S. and the international aerospace communities have made significant progress in recognizing the hazards of orbital debris and in reducing or eliminating the potential for the creation of new debris, the future environment is expected to worsen without additional corrective measures.\n\nSpace debris measurement program at Phillips Laboratory\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDao, Phan D.; Mcnutt, Ross T.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nGround-based optical sensing was identified as a technique for measuring space debris complementary to radar in the critical debris size range of 1 to 10 cm. The Phillips Laboratory is building a staring optical sensor for space debris measurement and considering search and track optical measurement at additional sites. The staring sensor is implemented in collaboration with Wright Laboratory using the 2.5 m telescope at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio. The search and track sensor is designed to detect and track orbital debris in tasked orbits. A progress report and a discussion of sensor performance and search and track strategies will be given.\n\nElectromagnetic absorption properties of spacecraft and space debris\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMicheli, D.; Santoni, F.; Giusti, A.; Delfini, A.; Pastore, R.; Vricella, A.; Albano, M.; Arena, L.; Piergentili, F.; Marchetti, M.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nAim of the work is to present a method to evaluate the electromagnetic absorption properties of spacecraft and space debris. For these objects, the radar detection ability depends mainly on volume, shape, materials type and other electromagnetic reflecting behaviour of spacecraft surface components, such as antennas or thermal blankets, and of metallic components in space debris. The higher the electromagnetic reflection coefficient of such parts, the greater the radar detection possibility. In this research an electromagnetic reverberation chamber is used to measure the absorption cross section (ACS) of four objects which may represent space structure operating components as well as examples of space debris: a small satellite, a composite antenna dish, a Thermal Protection System (TPS) tile and a carbon-based composite missile shell. The ACS mainly depends on geometrical characteristics like apertures, face numbers and bulk porosity, as well as on the type of the material itself. The ACS, which is an electromagnetic measurement, is expressed in squared meters and thus can be compared with the objects geometrical cross section. A small ACS means a quite electromagnetic reflective tendency, which is beneficial for radar observations; on the contrary, high values of ACS indicate a strong absorption of the electromagnetic field, which in turn can result a critical hindering of radar tracking.\n\nThe bistatic radar capabilities of the Medicina radiotelescopes in space debris detection and tracking\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMontebugnoli, S.; Pupillo, G.; Salerno, E.; Pluchino, S.; di Martino, M.\n\n2010-03-01\n\nAn accurate measurement of the position and trajectory of the space debris fragments is of primary importance for the characterization of the orbital debris environment. The Medicina Radioastronomical Station is a radio observation facility that is here proposed as receiving part of a ground-based space surveillance system for detecting and tracking space debris at different orbital regions (from Low Earth Orbits up to Geostationary Earth Orbits). The proposed system consists of two bistatic radars formed by the existing Medicina receiving antennas coupled with appropriate transmitters. This paper focuses on the current features and future technical development of the receiving part of the observational setup. Outlines of possible transmitting systems will also be given together with the evaluation of the observation strategies achievable with the proposed facilities.\n\nSpace Transportation System Liftoff Debris Mitigation Process Overview\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMitchell, Michael; Riley, Christopher\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLiftoff debris is a top risk to the Space Shuttle Vehicle.
