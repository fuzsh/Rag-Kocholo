I've been there, feeling the weight of managing my health alone, navigating the highs and lows of HbA1C levels for nine years. But I have learned there's no one-size-fits-all solution for diabetes management. It's a personal journey, often filled with uncertainty and frustration. Yet, it doesn't have to be this way. Diabetes shouldn't be a taboo topic. It affects millions of Americans, yet many shy away from discussing it. It's time to change that narrative. That's why I've dedicated myself to spreading awareness and offering support to those at risk of developing diabetes and other chronic conditions and disorders.\n\nNew York, NY\n\nFounded in 2023\n\nTechnology\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nImperfect Action, LLC »\n\nMichael Blumberg '98\n\nPersonal Coaching & Development\n\nMichael Blumberg '98\n\nOwner\n\nCompany Overview\n\nAt Imperfect Action, my mission is simple...

Our search for wholesome pet nourishment revealed a market saturated with pet food brands all offering the same variety of food with ingredients of artificial additives and chemicals. The food led to health woes for Skipper. Determined to provide better, we started crafting nutritious homemade meals for him, armed with insights from vets, pet nutritionists, and diligent research. This initiative blossomed into a range of recipes and treats that have significantly enhanced Skipper's health over time. We started to observe higher energy levels, better digestion, and healthy skin and coat. Soon, Kona entered our lives, and both our pups enjoy daily homemade meals and treats. Yes, our dogs are the inspiration behind our name: Skipper + Kona = Skona! The word Skona is also a Swedish verb that translates to ‘protect’. We strongly believe it is our duty as pet parents to protect and save our pets from harm by providing the best nutrition. At Skona Pet Food, we aspire to share our nutritious recipes and knowledge with all pet owners who seek nothing but the best for their furry companions.

Over time, our vision has evolved, and we are now dedicated to extending our support to a broader range of minority communities. At Mega3 Firm, we offer invaluable advice and strategic support across a spectrum of specialties. We take pride in sharing our expertise in technology, business and career consulting with individuals, as well as small and medium-sized business owners in the West Indian, Caribbean, and diverse immigrant communities. We are committed to making a positive impact and contributing to the growth and success of these vibrant and dynamic communities.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nUpon our founder's arrival to America from Jamaica, Thalia first settled in South Florida before moving to New England. South Florida has always had a spot in her heart as it shares many similarities to her homeland, being heavily Caribbean influenced. During a heartfelt conversation with a mentor about facing harassment, racism and retaliation from a previous employer, it was suggested that she leverage her experience to advise businesses in Florida. She didn't understand the magnitude of clients that would benefit greatly from her expertise prior to even establishing her LLC. Thalia would be approached often in public while being a consumer at small business fairs and out at local restaurants by people asking for business advice. Her natural entrepreneurial ways, which she credits to her parents and an academic background in social and cultural studies, were itching to be intermixed. This fusion has given birth to what is now known as Mega3 Firm, where we genuinely embody the motto, \"Providing personal and patient expertise from people like you.\"\n\nMiami, FL, USA\n\nFounded in 2022\n\nProfessional Services, Technology\n\nBlack-Owned, Women-Led\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nCommunications, Ink »\n\nCara Hutchins MBA'93\n\nA marketing agency powered by imagination and supported by strategy\n\nCara Hutchins MBA'93\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCommunications, Ink is a certified woman-owned, marketing company that believes powerful marketing relies upon creative ideas grounded in a strategic approach.

Initially, we were hiding bracelets shaped like Cape Cod in geocaches, sharing the locations on social media and encouraging people to explore our favorite places. We started receiving inquiries to buy the bracelets, which nudged us to create a website and build a non-profit partnership model with the CC National Seashore. Since then, we've evolved into a purpose-driven brand with the mission to #makewaves for marine life causes. Over the years, our offering has expanded to include three distinct lines: Cape Clasp, Tikós, and the Tides Program. Tikós, launched in 2016, features 100% recycled ocean plastic bracelets and sunglasses, offering a daily reminder to be mindful of your plastic use. This line has led to collaborations with organizations like the National Park Foundation and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In 2020, we introduced the Tides Program, offering limited edition apparel that captures the spirit of the ocean in everything from hand tie-dyed tees to pop-culture-inspired collections. 15% of our profits flow directly to our growing list of marine life non-profit partners, summing up to over $200,000 in donations. You've been instrumental in this success—your shared passion keeps us anchored to our mission and inspires every new collection, collaboration, and charitable contribution we make.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nWhat inspired me to create Cape Clasp was a profound love for Cape Cod's unique natural beauty and a desire to see it preserved for future generations. After attending Babson, I returned to the Cape and began hiding bracelets shaped like Cape Cod in geocaches. The idea was simple: encourage people to explore, appreciate, and ultimately protect this special place. The overwhelming response to those bracelets showed me there was an opportunity to create a venture that combined entrepreneurship with purpose. We started Cape Clasp with a commitment to #makewaves for marine life causes, partnering with local nonprofits like the Cape Cod National Seashore. The venture has since evolved, but that initial inspiration—our love for the ocean and the life it supports—continues to guide everything we do.\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nHillman Homes »\n\nRachel Foy MBA'01\n\nA boutique residential real estate firm focusing on Massachusetts and New Hampshire\n\nRachel Foy MBA'01\n\nOwner\n\nCompany Overview\n\nHillman Homes is a boutique real estate firm helping buyers, sellers, investors and renters with their residential real estate transactions.

We do this in 3 ways: Period Palooza is an engaging initiative that brings together student groups, businesses, and organizations to raise funds directly on our website, contributing $10 for each kit made. This exciting team bonding experience focuses on creating sustainable period kits comprising reusable pouches, eco-friendly pads, tampons, and panty liners. We have successfully assembled 800 kits, benefitting schools in Massachusetts as well as earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria, and communities in Kenya and Nigeria. Fihri's Student Sponsorship Program presents an opportunity for individuals to make a meaningful impact by personally supporting a student in need with a monthly $15 sponsorship. We recognize and respect that menstruation is a unique experience for each individual, which is why we offer a range of choices. Once a sponsor submits their $15, we collaborate with dedicated school nurses in areas with the greatest need to identify a deserving student. Based on the student's preferences, we carefully assemble and mail sustainable period products tailored to their specific needs. To uplift their spirits, we also include PMS candy and an inspiring note, reminding them that they are not alone. In Fihri's One for One Program, we believe in the power of giving back. For every product purchased by an individual, we commit to donating a pad and tampon to a menstruator in need.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nWhen my daughter began her menstrual journey, I wanted her to have sustainable access to period products. However, I soon realized that there were girls her age right here in Massachusetts who were struggling to afford these necessities. Shockingly, I discovered that 8th graders were teaching 6th graders how to use toilet paper as makeshift period pads. Motivated by this injustice, I developed the concept during my International Business class and subsequently applied to the WinLab. After being accepted, I successfully launched Fihri to ensure that my daughter and her peers had sustainable access to period products.\n\nMassachusetts, USA\n\nFounded in 2021\n\nHealthcare\n\nWomen-Led\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nKokoBerna »\n\nBelinda Ephraim M'11\n\nAn integrative medicine and sustainable wellness lifestyle brand\n\nBelinda Ephraim M'11\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nCompany Overview\n\nKokoBerna is a portmanteau that implies \"mother's daughter – brave one.” It is a journey of evidence-based health and well-being that transcends the sands of time.

By building a stronger pipeline of Black financial services & advisory professionals, we move closer to a world where the Black community has the opportunity to work with bankers, loan officers, investment professionals, and other financial services & advisory representatives who understand the nuances of their cultures and their unique needs.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nWithout equipping youth with the proper knowledge and resources, the industry will continue to maintain underweight representation of Black Americans and widen the already large wealth gap.\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nFounded in 2022\n\nFinance & Investments\n\nBlack-Owned\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nVantra Lighting »\n\nManish Raichandani MBA'13\n\nYour one-stop solution for all your luxury lighting needs\n\nManish Raichandani MBA'13\n\nDirector\n\nCompany Overview\n\nVantra is one of the India’s largest decorative lighting brands.

Let me rewind a bit. Earlier this year, I discovered that coffee is a fruit. This simplistic revelation sparked an obsessive curiosity. How could I not know this about the second-most traded commodity (behind crude oil) and a drink that I consumed every single day! What else did I not know? As it turns out, there was a lot that I did not know! For starters, coffee should be thought of like wine instead of like a commodity. Also, there is a massive transparency problem within the coffee world. And thus, Who Is Coffee was born. Our goal is to change the traditional coffee narrative and open a window into the lives of those that share a passion for coffee. I wrote all about the inspiration in our first blog post: https://whoiscoffee.com/blogs/from-the-coffee-world/we-may-be-crazy-but-we-have-a-mission\n\nBoston and Medellín, Colombia\n\nFounded in 2021\n\nFood & Beverage\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nBack Deck Restaurant »\n\nBradley Fredericks '82\n\nProfessional backyard grilling brought to downtown Boston\n\nBradley Fredericks '82\n\nOwner\n\nCompany Overview\n\nBack Deck offers professional backyard grilling in a laid-back city setting seven days a week.

The sweet treats are sold online and at four trendy cafés in Istanbul, Turkey. Influenced by global trends and seasons, Butterfly features new chocolate creations throughout the year.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nRight after graduation, I started working for Chase Manhattan Bank in Istanbul. After 2 years, I realized that I didn’t enjoy working in an established company repeating similar tasks all the time. I was urged to create something from zero and grow it without any boundaries. After searching for a gap in a niche market, I noticed that there were no cookbooks published in Turkey which had pictures for recipes. So I found myself a partner who graduated from Cordon Bleu and who wanted to write a cookbook as well. After our second cookbook, we decided to create a trademark which would help sell our cookbooks and vice versa. At that point, we noticed that there were no artisanal chocolate shops in Turkey. Butterfly Chocolate was born to fill this need.\n\nIstanbul, Turkey\n\nFounded in 2003\n\nFood & Beverage\n\nWomen-Led\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nCAMUS Cognac »\n\nCyril Camus '91\n\nA family-owned business specializing in the production of cognac\n\nCyril Camus '91\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nCompany Overview\n\nThe leading family-owned cognac house, the House of CAMUS has been operating independently since 1863, upholding the same uncompromising philosophy of a family five generations strong. CAMUS produces the most aromatic cognacs, sold in most countries in the world, in almost every international airport, and on board a large number of airlines. In addition to cognac, the House of CAMUS also produces LOUDENNE Medoc wine and LAMBAY Irish Whiskey.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nIn 1863, the founder Jean-Baptiste Camus understood that his quest for the utmost refinement in his Cognac required the creation of a dedicated, independent House.\n\nCognac, France\n\nFounded in 1863\n\nFood & Beverage\n\nFamily Business\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nCoconut Cartel »\n\nDanielle Zighelboim '13\n\nPremium Coconut Rum\n\nDanielle Zighelboim '13\n\nCo-Founder\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCoconut Cartel imports premium Latin American foods and beverages via the Port of Miami. In 2013, the first smuggle of products was coconuts from El Salvador, inventing the “branded coconut” sensation. Today, Coconut Cartel supplies South Florida with fresh, branded coconuts and produces a self-titled line of premium rum, Coconut Cartel Special, available nationwide.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nA key and a coconut. When we popped open a coconut and stuck a straw in it to drink real fresh coconut water we realized what we were being sold in the U.S. was not the real deal. So we stuffed our luggage with a bunch of them, brought them back to Miami and the craze caught flame! We were inspired to expand our product line into premium rum because we believe rum is a spirit that many people haven’t had the pleasure of enjoying the right way. Much like we have seen happen with tequila and whiskey, rum is the next category to “premiumize” and to offer new, exciting brands from all over the world.\n\nMiami, FL\n\nFounded in 2013\n\nFood & Beverage\n\nFamily Business, Women-Led\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nDetraPel, Inc »\n\nDavid Zamarin '19\n\nPowerful, non-toxic coatings that prolong the life of your favorite belongings by protecting against the damages caused by spills and stains\n\nDavid Zamarin '19\n\nFounder & CEO\n\nCompany Overview\n\nAt DetraPel we know that life can get messy, and we want to help.

I grew up watching my mother hustling daily to provide me with the best possible life. I learned very early on that success meant hard work and sacrifice. So at an early age I started dabbling in different business ideas in an effort to contribute, which included selling popular headphones and watches. In high school I started a shoe cleaning business. This business ran for 4 months and we generated significant revenue. I was ecstatic. After just 4 months I was given an offer to sell. The decision was easy. I sold my first business and invested all of the money into starting DetraPel. The idea for DetraPel started from the conditioning service we were offering with my shoe cleaning business. I was using a competitor’s product, which I later found out was extremely carcinogenic, caused birth defects, dried white and ruined fabric. On top of that it was extremely expensive. By having used the toxic formulas, I exposed myself to harmful chemicals, but more importantly an industry-changing idea. I knew I wanted to create protective formulas that were safe enough to apply at home, without a mask, and in the presence of babies and puppies.\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nFajitas & 'Ritas »\n\nBradley Fredericks '82\n\nTexas-Mexican restaurant specializing in fajitas and margaritas\n\nBradley Fredericks '82\n\nOwner\n\nCompany Overview\n\nEstablished in 1989, Fajitas & 'Ritas is an award-winning, good-vibe, “unabashedly fun” restaurant and bar featuring fresh Texas cuisine.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nExperiencing the food and drink of Texas while working for Exxon, just after graduating from Babson.

House Bear Brewing uses raw, unfiltered honey to make dry, crisp meads, which are sold in ~130 stores across the state, as well as at their tasting room at their Newburyport meadery location.\n\nCompany Inspiration\n\nI’ve been making mead since college. On my 30th birthday I decided to stop in to the Sunset Grill and treat myself to something different. They had mead there: $5 for 2oz and it was the worst mead I’d ever tried. I said that I could do better than that. The seed was probably planted then although I didn’t realize it. It wasn’t until I was at Babson that I started to think about this more seriously. I would brew mead when I needed to decompress. I started to think there could be a future here and started to research the market. When I tracked 5 meaderies over a 4 year data period and saw that mead was growing at 700% / year, I knew that it was on the cusp of a craft mead explosion like the craft beer explosion of the '90s. I wanted to be ready when that happened.\n\nNewburyport, MA\n\nFounded in 2013\n\nFood & Beverage\n\nLGBTQ Owned, Women-Led\n\nCopy Sharing Link\n\nPrevious company Next company Close the current slide\n\nKannoa »\n\nPhilip Boulton '97\n\nOutdoor furniture designed to harmoniously integrate with the environment\n\nPhilip Boulton '97\n\nCo-Founder & CFO\n\nCompany Overview\n\nAn outdoor furniture company, Kannoa designs functional pieces that harmoniously integrate with the environment.

When I began looking for opportunities, I began a conversation with my best friend about what we could do together. Outdoor Furniture was beginning to be an exciting new area, poised for growth, and we set out to build an outdoor furniture company based on four pillars: Design, Functionality, Durability and Harmony. From the beginning, we had an innate sense that these concepts had to guide not only the furniture we manufactured, but the company itself. We decided to"
