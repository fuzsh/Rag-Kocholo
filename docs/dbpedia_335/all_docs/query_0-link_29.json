(to Ceramic Showcase) I painted new pedestals and repainted our wall display in Mom's garage. Gr'Ma & Michael figured a unique and thrifty way to save our rug. Dave upped production: he has me doing leaf-rubbing, latexing, shading, leaf stenciling. I need to price, and pack pots and stuff for our booth.\n\nAm doing a visual inventory in Adobe Illustrator, it's pretty fun, and easy to see how pieces will look in our booth. Drawing booth, pedestals, pots and wall pieces -- much easier moving em around on the screen than real life -- some of our pots are huge like rearranging furniture.\n\nWe're trying to work lots but not get too tired or sick. We keep up morning walks/runs and Dave makes wonderful veggie breakfasts. Hope we get enough sleep to feel perky greeting people at our booth. Good friends are praying all goes well, and that's the best!\n\n04/01/10 • Preparing a Show\n\nour booth 2009\n\nB draws on platter\n\nRaku notecards\n\nD cuts firewood today\n\nCountdown... a month til Ceramic Showcase at Oregon Convention Center. Tons of preparation for a 3-day show. Our 20-foot wide booth space (!) will need extra lights, pedestals, rugs... AND lots of good raku pieces! Details about the show on our Shows page, and on the official OPA Ceramic Showcase site.\n\nBesides scrounging firewood, Dave is working hard throwing pots. Today I'm drawing herons on large wall-platters, assembling raku notecards, starting new \"coffee theme\" pieces, and designing business cards. (Is your list also longer than what gets done?)\n\n03/15/10 • Gallery Exhibit Opening Night Fun\n\nJazz trio\n\nJanice's plate, weird artists\n\n48\" tall \"Heron Urn\"\n\nB. H. Gallery exhibit\n\n\"Salmon\" Lampbase, 15\"h \"batik raku\" large wallplatter, 24\"dia. \"Leafprints & Fern\" pot Vashon roadside art Opening night\n\nOur new show is successfully launched! 30 pieces are exhibited at a beautiful place with gracious people. I fell in love with Vashon, an artsy island in Puget Sound. We've lived in the same place forever, but if we move, this island's on my list (and Michael's land on Big Island!)\n\nOpening night at Blue Heron Gallery was perfect! Well displayed, well attended, good food and wine, a fun jazz trio, several sales, and some friends new and old. What more could we ask? Blue Heron Gallery is part of Vashon Allied Arts, a non-profit organization with a theater, galleries, dance, classes, and all kinds of events. Vashon Island is a short ferry boat ride from Seattle or Tacoma.\n\nThe show is up through March 25. A variety of sizes and forms, and different firing techniques are included: traditional raku, saggar-fired pieces, naked raku pieces, and a large platter done with what I call \"batik raku.\"\n\nThe \"ARTSY COUPLE\" on our home page, true identity: our friends Jude and Lindsy Larson of Fox Island. Good to see you guys!"
