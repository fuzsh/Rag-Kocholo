        "text": "The luxury list: A neighborhood-by-neighborhood ranking of Manhattan resale brokers on $5 million-plus deals\n\nThe Real Deal\n\nBy Staff\n\nIt’s always been difficult to rank the city’s top real estate agents, given the lack of publicly available information about their performance — at least when measured by cold, hard data.\n\nBut for the first time ever this month, The Real Deal compiled a ranking of luxury sellers’ agents based on the dollar volume of their closed sales, rather than listings. And we’ve drilled down even farther, discovering who reigns supreme in different corners of Manhattan. We looked at sales of $5 million and up, below 96th Street, which were closed and recorded in 2011. Then we used the new “Shop for a Broker” tool from listings aggregator Street\n\nEasy to match up the transactions with the seller’s agents. Lastly, we did our own research to help ensure we weren’t missing any transactions, ultimately matching nearly 90 percent of sales. (A portion of the remaining sales were off-market deals that never officially had listings.)\n\nSince the identity of buyers’ brokers is not publicly available, the rankings include only listing brokers. The ranking also does not factor in sponsor sales at new developments, since it’s difficult to compare the process of selling condominium units for a developer to working with individual homeowners.\n\nFor most of the luxury brokers on the list, the key to dominating in a particular neighborhood was securing one mammoth sale. But a select few — Serena Boardman of Sotheby’s, John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens and Robby Browne of Corcoran, for example — seem to have cornered both the volume business and the megadeals.\n\nThese three brokers are household names in the residential real estate world, but they’re not the only ones. However, some familiar names are absent from this list, partly because we’re looking at a snapshot of closed deals from 2011, and partly because some brokers had deals spread across Manhattan, and didn’t dominate in a specific neighborhood.\n\nUpper East Side\n\nMore than any other Manhattan neighborhood, the Upper East Side is home to soaring deals. As a result, the competition for the top broker spot is at its fiercest.\n\nHigh-society broker Serena Boardman, who ranked as the neighborhood’s top luxury broker, closed over $45 million in deals in 2011 — the most expensive being a $12.5 million townhouse at 13 East 94th Street. The home — sprawling over 15 rooms and five stories — was owned by Maren Properties LLC, an entity that has been linked to Mark and Renee Rockefeller, fourth-generation members of the prominent family.\n\nBoardman is no stranger to clients with names ripped from the society pages. She also helped Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist and art collector, sell a full-floor co-op on the top floor of the Sherry-Netherland hotel on Fifth Avenue for $8 million.\n\nBoardman rarely, if ever, speaks with the press, and it seems that many of her deals also take place out of the public eye. Take, for example, the $36 million sale of Limited Brands founder Leslie Wexner’s co-op at 834 Fifth Avenue — one of the priciest to close in 2011 —where Boardman reportedly made hush-hush calls to other brokers to secure the buyer, real estate developer Larry Heyman of Heyman Properties. (The deal was not included in her total because there was never an official listing.)\n\nRobert Schulman, an executive managing director at Warburg, ranked second with two Park Avenue co-op sales totaling $44 million last year.\n\nFirst, he represented Irving and Judith Shafran, a matrimonial lawyer and book editor, respectively, in selling their 18th-floor, four-bedroom home at 778 Park. The Shafrans originally listed the apartment in December 2009, mere days before Bernard Madoff was arrested for running an epic Ponzi scheme in which the couple had invested, according to court documents. The property was on the market until this past November, when it was sold to Zygmunt Wilf, a real estate developer and owner of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nWilf faced criticism for paying $19 million for the residence while simultaneously seeking municipal tax breaks for a new football stadium in Minneapolis.\n\nSchulman also helped David Matlin, an investor known for his interest in distressed assets, and Lisa Matlin, who runs a Carnegie Hill gift shop, sell a sizeable spread at 625 Park Avenue. The 7,500-square-foot home was made up of two units — one “completely renovated to the highest standards and specifications” and another that “awaits your personal touch.”\n\nDavid Simon, the CEO of Indianapolis-based mall giant Simon Property Group, bought the whole shebang for $25 million.\n\nKathy Sloane — who took third place on the ranking with two deals worth a combined $36 million — has also worked with a cadre of business bigwigs.\n\nA senior vice president at Brown Harris Stevens, she handled the sale of a third-floor co-op at 640 Park Avenue for Peter Smith, a retired Lazard Frères executive, and his wife, Marie. The four-bedroom, six-bathroom residence fetched $20.5 million and went to hotel scion Alexander Tisch.\n\nSloane worked with another financier on the sale of a full-floor unit at the Carlyle Hotel at 35 East 76th Street. Peter Schoenfeld, the head of P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, and his wife, Charlotte, sold the home for $15.5 million to Brad Grey, the chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures.\n\nBy our count, almost 100 agents listed and sold properties of $5 million or more on the Upper East Side last year.\n\nThat means that some notable top producers are absent from our ranking. Corcoran’s Carrie Chiang, for example, sold nearly $58 million of residential real estate in the neighborhood, but many of her deals didn’t make the $5 million cutoff. Brown Harris Stevens’s John Burger sold William Lie Zeckendorf’s co-op at 927 Fifth Avenue for $34.6 million, but that wasn’t quite enough to make the top three — at least on the eastern side of Central Park.\n\nAnd, one of the most talked-about deals of the year — Johnson & Johnson heiress Libet Johnson’s $48 million sale of the Vanderbilt Mansion at 16 East 69th Street to Beauty\n\n.com founder Roger Barnett — was an off-market deal between friends. Similarly, it’s unclear whether brokers were involved in J. Christopher Flowers’s $36 million mid-renovation sale of the Harkness Mansion to art mogul Larry Gagosian, and there was never a public listing.\n\nUpper West Side\n\nBrown Harris Stevens broker and senior vice president John Burger dominated sales on Central Park West in 2011 with a stunning $54.1 million in closed deals. That includes three $5 million-plus deals at the Eldorado, the co-op where Burger said he has brokered the majority of the trades for the last 20 years.\n\nBurger’s clients in the building last year included Thomas Tierney, a director of eBay and former CEO of Bain & Co., an affiliate of GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney’s former employer Bain Capital. Tierney sold a 19th-floor penthouse for $6.25 million. Burger later helped him into another one of his Eldorado listings — a larger unit that Silicon Valley entrepreneur Richard Yanowitch sold for $8.95 million.\n\nBurger, who moonlights as the broker specialist at the Dakota at 1 West 72nd Street, also handled a $14.5 million sale at the San Remo at 145 Central Park West — his priciest in the neighborhood — and a $10.25 million sale at the Park Millennium on West 67th Street. He said he had a record year in 2011. “A lot of that comes from hard work, understanding of the marketplace and a strong pipeline of satisfied clients over a quarter-century,” he told The Real Deal.\n\nElliman’s Raphael De Niro sold two pricey properties in the Time Warner Center at 59th Street last year for a combined $48.05 million, easily catapulting him onto the Upper West Side ranking. The smaller of the two was a $17.5 million condo atop the Mandarin Oriental hotel owned by a trust reportedly backed by football star Tom Brady (whose agents signed the deed).\n\nBut De Niro’s biggest sale was the penthouse two floors up, No. 76B, owned by Todd Wagner, cofounder of website Broadcast.com, which sold for nearly $30.6 million. The buyer was reportedly Taek Jho Low, a Malaysian financier. The $6,331-per-square-foot deal broke price-per-square-foot records in the building, De Niro said. (It also outranked other powerbrokers who handle listings there, including the Sotheby’s duo Elizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers.)\n\nStill, De Niro doesn’t consider himself a neighborhood specialist. “Modern-day brokers are not constrained by specific geographies,” he said. “That’s the old way of doing it.”\n\nMoving down the rankings, among Cathy Taub’s four $5 million-plus sales were two idiosyncratic deals, one at the Eldorado and another at the Majestic at 115 Central Park West, where she’s lived since 1994.\n\nTaub and her Stribling colleague Rosette Arons listed an eighth-floor unit there for CBS medical correspondent Emily Senay and Avery Seavey, head of Manhattan-based real estate developer the Seavey Organization. An investment banking executive and his wife paid $5.7 million for the three-bedroom in January 2011, but before they moved in, the couple “had a change of heart and bought something completely different,” Taub said. They promptly drafted Taub and Arons to relist the apartment.\n\nTaub then found a buyer, a Bank of America investment banker, who knew exactly what he was willing to pay: $5.7 million. “Talk about having an immediate comp,” Taub said. “It was easy to justify the price.”\n\nAt the Eldorado, Taub and Elliman’s Oren Alexander sold two adjacent units owned by separate sellers to a single buyer.\n\nInitially, the two brokers listed the apartments separately, with Taub marketing unit 7G for the estate of Gregoire C. R. B. MacArthur, a member of the family whose eponymous foundation awards so-called genius grants. Alexander had the listing for unit 7F, owned by architect Bernard Marson, a 30-year resident of the Eldorado. But they wagered that a potential combination would reel in a better deal.\n\nRichard Barasch, the head of Universal American Corp., a health benefits administrator based in Rye Brook, N.Y., nabbed both for about $13.25 million.\n\nAlso worth noting is Upper West Side powerhouse Lisa Lippman of Brown Harris Stevens, who racked up an impressive number of deals in the neighborhood. Some were not included because they were sponsor sales.\n\nMidtown\n\n(including Central Park South, Midtown South, Midtown West and Clinton)\n\nIf off-market deals were included in rankings, Lisa Simonsen’s $48 million sale at the Plaza would top any list. But the seller, still unidentified, apparently chose a less public route to off-load the 6,000-square-foot spread.\n\nThat leaves Corcoran veteran Leighton Candler at the top in Midtown with one mega $30 million sale. Hedge fund manager Scott Bommer first enlisted Candler to help sell his apartment at the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton in November 2008, just a few months after he bought it for $28.5 million. The 5,800-square-foot unit, one of 12 residences above the hotel at 50 Central Park South, jumped on and off the market until it sold for $30 million in October 2010. The sale was recorded in August. It was not immediately clear what accounted for the lag.\n\nMeanwhile, Emilie O’Sullivan’s sale of two units at the Plaza may not have broken city records, but at $19 million, it was hefty nonetheless.\n\nO’Sullivan, of Corcoran, represented Gigi Mahon, an author and interior decorator who bought the adjacent apartments in 2007 for roughly $3.8 million and $10.3 million. “It just seemed crazy not to buy two [apartments] since their terraces were so close together,” Mahon told The Real Deal.\n\nA New Jersey native who visited the Plaza as a child, Mahon was initially wary of developer El-Ad Properties’ plan to convert the upper levels to condos. But she eventually came to think of it as the property’s salvation.\n\nMahon, who is currently living in Palm Beach, Fla., sold the apartments to afford her a financial cushion. “It just gave me a whole heck of a lot of security,” she said. The buyer was reportedly Barbara Garza, a director of Mexican bottler Coca-Cola Femsa S.A.B. de C.V.\n\nRanking third was Elliman’s Victoria Shtainer, who has handled numerous deals at One Beacon Court. The deal that landed her on the list was her sale of the 34th-floor, four-bedroom condo owned by Wvc Holdings, an undisclosed entity, to Berkshire Hathaway executive Ajit Jain for almost $14.7 million.\n\nAlso known as the Bloomberg Tower, the 105-unit building has welcomed numerous celebrities, including pop star Beyoncé, NBC newsman Brian Williams, baseball star Johnny Damon and two attorneys convicted of financial fraud, Scott Rothstein and Marc Dreier. In fact, Jain purchased Dreier’s former home at auction in 2009 for $8.3 million. That unit is adjacent to the more recent purchase, which Shtainer listed for $16.5 million.\n\nMidtown East\n\n(including Sutton Place, Turtle Bay, Kips Bay and Murray Hill)\n\nThe Midtown East designation is a tricky one, since it encompasses the exclusive prewar co-ops of Sutton Place, such as the Sovereign and River House, as well as the more moderately priced homes of Kips Bay and Murray Hill, where local brokers say first-time homebuyers are fueling the market.\n\nNot surprisingly, it’s the agents finding buyers for the former who are pulling in the highest dollar volume of sales in the area.\n\nIn 2011, Kathy Sloane — one of only three brokers to make the top-three list in more than one neighborhood — finally sold Broadway producer Marty Richards’ 14-room maisonette at River House. Richards first listed the two-level residence in 2007 at $22.7 million; the unit went into contract in January 2008, but the deal fell apart. The Art Deco building at 435 East 52nd Street is one of the city’s strictest co-ops.\n\nThen, in October 2008, as the world was reeling from an economic tailspin, the apartment went back on the market for a more austere $13.9 million. It finally sold for $11.65 million in February to the Chilean investment advisor Manuel Balbontin.\n\nDeborah Grubman and David Dubin, who also made the list in Tribeca, sold an apartment at River House owned by Goldman Sachs executive Roy Zuckerberg, who also sits on the board of the Mack-Cali Realty Corp, for $10.1 million. Evidently, buyers Firoozeh Foulon and Christopher Toub, a bigwig at the investment firm AllianceBernstein, passed the River House co-op board’s test. The deal was the Corcoran duo’s biggest Midtown East deal of 2011 and their only one above $5 million in the neighborhood.\n\nMeanwhile, Ann Jeffery, a senior vice president and managing director at Brown Harris Stevens, brokered the $8 million sale of a co-op at 1 Sutton Place South, which was first listed at $8.5 million.\n\nThe owners were Gavin McFarland, a banker, and Hannah Griswold, a fund-raising consultant who formed the Young Lions fund-raising program for the New York Public Library. They paid $5.6 million for the home in June 2008. Charles Moss Jr., the head of Bow Tie Partners, a New York and Aspen, Colo.-based real estate and entertainment business, bought the residence.\n\nJeffery also sold a Park Avenue co-op and a Fifth Avenue co-op on the Upper East Side for $24.9 million and $6.5 million, respectively, which were not counted toward the Midtown East total.\n\nFlatiron District and Gramercy Park\n\nThe Flatiron District has undergone some serious changes in recent years, with additions like Mario Batali’s Eataly food complex, the renaissance of Madison Square Park and new developments like 15 Union Square West and the Cammeyer bringing condo dwellers to the area. When it comes to Gramercy Park, however, the luxury sales are clustered around that exclusive stretch of green that gives the neighborhood its name.\n\nIn February of last year, Corcoran senior vice president Tim Cass sold a duplex penthouse at 50 Gramercy Park North belonging to the Icelandic retail tycoon Jon Asgeir Johannesson for $22 million. Now, the Icelandic LLC–like entity that bought the apartment appears to be attempting to flip it, looking to Cass again to help. Johannesson listed the unit in June for $21.4 million. It was then taken off the market, and then relisted in January after a 12 percent price cut. Cass declined to discuss the transaction.\n\nMeanwhile, Aligned Real Estate founders Jonathan Isaacs and Steven Ganz, formerly of Core, handled the $14.6 million sale of the 10,000-square-foot duplex penthouse at 31 West 21st Street featured in the film “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” The seller was financier Richard Weissman, who paid $1.4 million for the pad in 2003. While the unit’s star turn garnered some attention, it didn’t bump up the price, Isaacs explained. “Somebody at that price point isn’t buying based on the movie,” he said.\n\nSpeaking of star power, at least when it comes to real estate, Lisa Simonsen got her fair share of attention last year for brokering the apparently off-market $48 million sale of a combination unit at the Plaza acquired by Igor Krutoy, the founder of Russian MTV, touted as the most expensive condo sale in New York’s history (see above). But it was a smaller deal at 50 Gramercy Park North that put her on the ranking in this neighborhood.\n\nSimonsen sold a three-bedroom unit for money manager Thomas Marsico, who was twice named to Forbes’ list of the 400 Richest Americans, for $7 million. The buyer was an LLC, but news reports indicated that actor Jennifer Aniston was behind the purchase. She had toured an apartment in the building in the summer.\n\nLike Johannesson’s former home, the residence sits atop the Gramercy Park Hotel, the posh conversion backed by Ian Schrager and designed by John Pawson that bestows upon owners a key to the private park. Simonsen, who touts her “highly discreet” service on her firm profile, did not return a request for comment.\n\nChelsea\n\nn recent years, Chelsea has been a breeding ground for new condominiums, and some of the neighborhood’s highest-grossing agents are working at the sales offices of these developments, such as the Jean Nouvel–designed 100 Eleventh Avenue, 305W16 and +aRt at 540 West 28th Street.\n\nMeanwhile, the high-powered Elliman team of Leonard Steinberg and partner Hervé Senequier were busy closing these, and other, kinds of deals. They sold two units over the $5 million mark in the neighborhood, totaling $12.6 million.\n\nIn August, the two sold a T-shaped four-bedroom loft with a 1,000-square-foot outdoor terrace at the Eagle, an almost 12-year-old condo building at 532 West 22nd Street, and fetched $6.65 million.\n\nSteinberg remained tight-lipped about his clients, but said that last year none of them were tabloid fodder. “We don’t want Kardashianism in our real estate — although if they did come along with the right check, we might succumb,” he joked.\n\nCore’s Emily Beare spent much of 2011 in the Flatiron District, heading up the sales office at Savanna Partners’ 141 Fifth Avenue, where the last remaining unit, the $13.3 million cupola penthouse, sold in April. Said Beare, “141 was my baby.”\n\nThat sale, however, did not count toward her total because it was a sponsor sale. Instead, it was the early sale of a penthouse at 252 Seventh Avenue that put her on the ranking — and in Chelsea no less. Known as the Chelsea Mercantile, the building is home to Montreal Canadiens hockey player Scott Gomez. Rungravee and Larry Wienman sold their 3,800-square-foot four-bedroom there for $7 million in January 2011.\n\nElliman’s Richelle Spindell ranked third with a nearly $6.4 million unit in the Steiner building at 257 West 17th Street for financier Jonathan Copplestone and Lisa Pomerantz, a fashion marketing executive.\n\nThe 4,000-square-foot apartment was fashioned out of two units, one of which the couple bought for less than $750,000 in 1996, before the building was converted to lofts. “Their architect did, really, an incredible job,” Spindell said.\n\nThe result was featured in the Best of Elle Décor Book, and spiritual guru Deepak Chopra was among the would-be buyers who came to check out the spread, Spindell said. Ultimately it went to Raphael Marquez, a member of the New York Red Bulls soccer team.\n\n“My entire business is built on referrals and repeat business,” said Spindell, who lives on Sutton Place but enthuses about Chelsea. “I’ve had a lot of people who’ve moved to different areas of the city.”\n\nWest Village and Greenwich Village\n\nCorcoran’s Robby Browne may live on Central Park West, but he racked up several high-priced West Village deals last year with his three team members. Browne closed four $5 million-plus deals worth a combined $33.11 million in the neighborhood.\n\nAt 147 Waverly Place, Browne sold two three-bedroom lofts: one belonging to Chipotle founder Stephen Ells for $6.1 million, and another (two floors up) belonging to Alastair Tedford, cofounder of the investment firm Albion Investors, for $7.5 million. (Browne also represented Ells and Tedford when they originally bought the apartments.)\n\nPlus, he also handled the sale of the townhouse at 64 Perry Street — next door to the fictional home of Carrie Bradshaw on “Sex and the City” — for the estate of Wheaton Galentine, a documentary filmmaker, and Harold Eliot Leeds, an architect and professor. After 27 days on the market at $8.5 million, the home sold for just over $9 million. “We never said no to a showing, so everyone was able to get in and see the house,” Browne said.\n\nStill, there were pricier townhouses on offer in the neighborhood.\n\nLast spring, Corcoran’s Eileen Robert represented the Malaysian-born media mogul Clive Ng and model Farrah Summerford in selling their 25-foot-wide townhouse at 20 East 10th Street. The buyers are rumored to be actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.\n\nBut not all townhouses fared so well when it came to getting their asking price. Tim Desmond, Alexa Lambert and Linda Melnick of Stribling and Serena Boardman of Sotheby’s secured about $16.8 million for the sale of 47 West 9th Street — just over half what the seller hoped to get.\n\nAndre Singer, a Belgian real estate developer, bought the property for $12.7 million when he moved to New York in August 2008. At the time, the dilapidated building housed four market-rate rental units, but Singer planned a massive renovation.\n\n“This was a house that was a prime candidate for what he was looking to do,” said Desmond, who represented Singer in both deals.\n\nThe developer outfitted the 28-foot wide townhouse with an elevator, screening room, gym and 1,000-bottle wine cellar.\n\nHe put the 9,000-square-foot home on the market for $28.5 million in February, and cross-listed it with Stribling and Sotheby’s to get the widest exposure, Desmond said, though he added that the brokers advised pricing it in the low 20s.\n\n“He wanted to shoot for the moon,” Desmond said. “He probably was disappointed, but that is the nature of this business.”\n\nSoho\n\n(including Little Italy, Noho and Nolita)\n\nThe luxury sales in Soho in 2011 exemplified the breadth of housing stock there, from the renovated artist lofts in Soho proper to the new developments rising to the north.\n\nElliman’s Dennis Mangone helped hotelier Ian Schrager sell an $11 million four-bedroom duplex penthouse at 285 Lafayette Street that boasts 23-foot ceilings in the living room and a sky-lit private gym. (He co-listed it with Kirk Rundhaug of Core.)\n\nAt 40 Bond Street, the Herzog & de Meuron–designed development where both Schrager and Mangone own condos, the broker also sold a $5.6 million unit, reportedly to the same London-based family that purchased two other units in the building.\n\nMangone, who joined Elliman from Brown Harris Stevens about a year ago, has a roster of boldface names on his client list, including Ricky Martin, Beyoncé and fashion photographer Mario Testino. Despite his Downtown address, he said his business is focused on lifestyle, not geography.\n\n“I work with developers that have a proven track record, and I see who they hire to be the architect of the building and where the land is located, and I look at the floor plans and the views and the finishes,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sotheby’s Meg Siegel handled four listings on Soho’s Wooster Street, a cobblestone road of fin-de-siècle loft buildings. Two deals topped $5 million.\n\nThe priciest sale was a penthouse at No. 102 owned by investor Erik Postnieks and his wife, Lynn, for $8.2 million in July. The home, first listed at $10.5 million in March 2010, spent more than a year on the market, and the Postnieks sliced the price five times before signing a deal.\n\nThat kind of tinkering was par for the course in the neighborhood, said Soho-based Siegel. “I had sellers who were really uncertain where the market was, so we found the market, and some of the deals took a little time to do that.”\n\nSiegel also sold a $5.25 million loft at No. 104.\n\nArlene Weidberg, an executive vice president at Halstead, helped Susan Bloomberg, Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s ex-wife, off-load two adjacent penthouses at One Kenmare Square for a total of $11.6 million in November. Bloomberg, the mother of the mayor’s two daughters, bought the units in 2006 for $10.3 million. Painted in eye-popping pinks and yellows, the apartments come with a 4,000-square-foot private rooftop terrace, but they were never combined. The buyer, an LLC, purchased both.\n\nTribeca\n\nFor Deborah Grubman, 2011 marked a full year without former partner Carol Cohen, who was allegedly forced out of Corcoran in December 2010 in response to (now dismissed) allegations that she scammed a rent-stabilized apartment. Now working with David Dubin, Grubman’s biggest Tribeca sale of the year — by a long shot — was the three-level penthouse at 25 North Moore Street, also known as the Atalanta. The seller was Craig Nevill-Manning, a top Google engineer and New Zealand native, who bought the spread for $8.25 million in 2005.\n\nAdditionally, the pair brokered the sale of a $5.9 million condo in the Hubert at 7 Hubert Street. The seller, Nuprop Owner LLC, purchased the unit for just under $2.7 million in 2004. The buyer was also an LLC.\n\nPlatinum Executive Vice President Daniel Hedaya handled two sales for the same client, T Sky LLC, in two different parts of the River Lofts condominium complex. One was in the tower portion at 92 Laight Street and sold for $11.5 million to ex-Deutsche Bank executive Michael Cohrs. (The other was a two-bedroom at 416 Washington Street that fetched $2.5 million, but was not included in The Real Deal’s ranking because it fell under the $5 million marker.)\n\nRanking third in the neighborhood for 2011 was Dolly Lenz — a familiar name on top broker lists. Last year, the Elliman vice chair and powerbroker swooped in to help Alexis Stewart, daughter of Martha, sell a penthouse at the Ice House that had been languishing on the market since 2007. The 3,884-square-foot, two-level unit at 27 North Moore Street, a 1905 refrigeration building converted to 58 lofts, sold for $8.6 million. The buyers were hedge-funder James Flynn and his wife, Kerianne, who are reportedly planning to combine the home with an adjacent penthouse they own in the building.\n\nThat’s not to say that Lenz didn’t score deals in other parts of Manhattan, including the $18.3 million sale of Winick Realty Group Executive Vice President Lori Shabtai’s Upper East Side townhouse.\n\nOther brokers made strong showings in Tribeca, among them Raphael De Niro, whose actor father Robert founded the Tribeca Film Festival. However, some of the broker’s more high-profile deals didn’t quite make the cutoff, such as a unit at 195 Hudson Street that sold for a hair under $5 million, and director M. Night Shyamalan’s penthouse at 45 Walker Street, which closed too late for our ranking.\n\nOther neighborhoods\n\nThe ranking excludes sales below $5 million in an effort to use the most accurate and comprehensive data. However, that meant effectively eliminating certain neighborhoods — among them the East Village, the Lower East Side, the Financial District, Harlem and Inwood — because there weren’t enough deals that met the criteria.\n\nNaturally, top brokers working in these areas are still selling a hefty amount of real estate.\n\nElliman’s Ariel Cohen, for example, brokered nearly $19 million worth of resales at 15 Broad Street in the Financial District, the 382-unit condo conversion where he helped with pre-construction sales in 2004 and has lived since 2007.\n\nKelly Cole, a senior vice president at Corcoran, sold 23 properties in Inwood and Washington Heights. And, at Co-Op Village, a collection of 12 co-op buildings clustered on the far east corner of Grand Street, two teams of brokers — Neal Young and Jeremy Bolger of Halstead and Jacob Goldman, the founder of Loho Realty — each sold close to $15 million in co-ops.\n\nFurthermore, brokers who have done the difficult work of selling out new condo projects may not appear here, since the list does not include sponsor sales. That effectively cuts out Elliman’s Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes, who work at new developments across Downtown; Warburg’s Richard Steinberg, who was responsible for a slew of deals at Twenty9th Park Madison in Midtown South; and Brown Harris Stevens’s Shlomi Reuveni, who handily spearheaded sales at the Laureate on the Upper West Side, among others.\n\nAbout This Broker"
