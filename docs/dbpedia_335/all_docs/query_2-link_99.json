        "text": "Save The Children (STC)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 213890\n\nIn over 100 countries, we support children to transform their lives. We’ve been working for a fairer world for a century. Discover the values, history and people that make us who we are.\n\nWe work alongside children in 115 countries, including the UK.\n\nWith global Save the Children members, our shared ambition is that by 2030;\n\nno child dies from preventable causes before their fifth birthday\n\nall children learn from a quality basic education\n\nviolence against children is no longer tolerated.\n\nBy providing live-saving short-term help, and pushing for deep-rooted social change, we help children take their future into their own hands.\n\nEvery child has the right to learn.\n\nEvery child should have good food to fuel their bodies.\n\nEvery child should have medicine when they’re sick.\n\nFor over 100 years, we’ve fought for a fairer world for children.\n\nTogether with families, supporters and partners, we work to help every child get the future they deserve.\n\nIn Britain, we’re using apps to help parents support early learning. In Rwanda, we’ve kickstarted a reading revolution. With GSK, we’ve developed an antiseptic gel that could save half a million babies’ lives.\n\nSave the Children’s work is only possible thanks to our 5 million UK supporters and their amazing commitment – from wearing a Christmas jumper to running our local shops to organising fundraising events.\n\nWild Horses of America Foundation (WHOA)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 87-0685187\n\nThe Wild Horses of America Foundation was established in 2001 as a 501(c)3 charity with the goal of bettering the lives of America’s wild horses and burros.\n\nWhen we started there were 10,000 horses and burros that had been removed from their native ranges and were being held in BLM facilities and pastures. Today, with approximately 61,000 in corrals and pastures (as of October 2023), our work focuses on keeping America’s wild horses and burros on the range.\n\nSince 2015 we have partnered with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to treat the Onaqui Mountain Herd with contraception. Our work has been successful, and the herd’s reproductive rate has been reduced to about 5% per year. (Wild horse herds typically reproduce at a 15-20% rate, which means any given herd can double in size every 4-5 years.)\n\nYour support is crucial to sustain this humane approach and extend similar programs to other herds. Join us in ensuring the best quality of life for America’s wild horses and burros.\n\nWe are also working with the BLM to administer GonaCon to a select number of mares. It is being administered to some of the more difficult to dart mares, and those that are no longer living within the Herd Management Area. The goal is to see if this longer-acting contraceptive can be an effective tool in controlling the growth rate of mares that are difficult to treat annually with PZP.\n\nPlease consider making a contribution to help advance this work.\n\nEgyptAid (KAAF) (a project of KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION FOUNDATION)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1201875\n\nWe are a group of students from the West (UK, US, France, Holland, Canada, & Australia) currently studying in Cairo, Egypt. Having been moved by the poverty in the surrounding areas.\n\nEgyptAid (KAAF) is a charitable organization with a 100% donation policy, operating in Egypt for the past 10 years. Directed by Sheikh Ala, we have a few local scholars at the helm, and it is supported by a number of students of knowledge who volunteer with their free time.\n\nThe people being supported are the poor and disadvantaged of Cairo, and some village districts south of the country. The recipients predominantly range from orphans, widows, divorcees, families of prisoners, and the disabled and terminally ill.\n\nWe distribute food parcels and cash support to the needy on a weekly basis, we provide monthly sponsorship of a number of orphanages and charitable centres including students of knowledge from poor backgrounds, we annually support Quran memorisation centres and purchase essential stationary supplies for children. We also assist the sick and ill with medical expenses and cover the costs of the medicine required.\n\nIn Ramadan we hand out hot meals to nearly 2000 people daily, and bless the children with Eid clothing and toys on the day of Eid.\n\nMany families live on less than $2/£1.63 a day, no donation is too small.\n\nMay Allah Ø¹Ø² ÙØ¬Ù reward you for your help and accept it from you and us.\n\nMisool Foundation (umbrellaed by Wildlife Conservation Network)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 30-0108469\n\nMisool Foundation is an Indonesian Charity with projects in Raja Ampat, East Flores and Sorong\n\nMisool Foundation (called Yayasan Misool Ekosistem Regenerasi in Indonesian) is the registered charity arm of the private island resort, Misool. The organisation has a proven track record of delivering measurable conservation results in some of the most remote and challenging locations in the world.\n\nIn our home base in Raja Ampat, our joint mission is to safeguard the most biodiverse reefs on Earth through the empowerment of local communities, providing a structure by which they are able to reclaim their traditional tenureship of reefs. The Foundation maintains a broad approach to conservation, combining environmental, social, and educational elements.\n\nAt the core of our operation is the belief that sustainable tourism and community-based conservation are mutually beneficial. We seek to demonstrate to our local hosts, government, guests, and ourselves that sustainable tourism can provide a better life than logging, mining, or overfishing.\n\nOur Story:\n\nMisool Foundation’s work began in 2005, when we leased 100,000 acres/425 sq km of sea from the local community in South Raja Ampat, Indonesia. At the centre of this area was a stunning uninhabited island called Batbitim. Its white beach was strewn with the carcasses of dead baby sharks, whose fins had been removed to supply the shark fin soup trade.\n\nIn 2006, construction work began on the site of the former shark-finning camp. The primary objective was to establish a conservation centre. But a funding vehicle was necessary to keep the conservation work happening. And so Misool Resort, was born. The resort was built entirely of reclaimed wood, and not a single tree was cut down in the process. You can read more about that story here.\n\nCharity Intelligence (Ci)\n\nCA Regulator (CRA) — Charity Number: 803407956\n\nCharity Intelligence Canada (Ci) began out of frustration in 2006. We wanted more information about charities we supported. Not stories but rather facts and figures. We struggled to find high quality evidence-based research to help guide our giving decisions. Nor could we find an independent third party to turn to for advice. And so we began calling charities from across Canada, asking hard questions and seeking excellence and shared our research reports.\n\nOur approach to charitable giving is different. Just as a financial analyst researches potential stocks to find the best investment opportunities, Ci uses similar research methods to find exceptional charities for donors. As a result, donors have the tools they need to be better informed and make donations based on evidence. This means that more of what donors can afford to give makes a bigger difference, it has higher social impact.\n\nCharity Intelligence’s analysis goes beyond plain subjectivity or narrow financial analysis to dig deeper to arrive at those charities proven to be the best in their field: not just ’do gooders’ but ’good doers’, too.\n\nHuman Appeal\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1154288\n\nWho we are and what we do: Human Appeal is a non-profit organisation working across the globe to strengthen humanity’s fight against poverty, social injustice and natural disaster.

Innovative solutions make endless possibilities for innovative lives.\n\nAdditionally, we are providing a safe, healthy, fulfilling environment for post-service and medically challenged monkeys for the rest of their lives at our state-of-the-art Monkey Living Center or in one of our special care homes/foster homes.\n\nYouth On The Move (London) (YOTM)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1171778\n\nOur Projects\n\nEmpowering Young People to Be a Better Version of Themselves.

Endowed by the gaming community, Child’s Play is devoted to improving the lives of children and teens in children’s hospitals.\n\nChild’s Play was born in 2003 when Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of Penny Arcade wanted to change the negative perception of gaming and gamers in the media. In response, they challenged their fans to support Seattle Children’s Hospital through an Amazon Wishlist. In less than one month, they raised over $250,000 in cash and toys.\n\nSince then, Child’s Play has expanded to 190+ network hospitals across the globe, and contributions reach far beyond just games and technology. In 2015 Child’s Play debuted the therapeutic video game guide, enabling Child Life to be intentional when choosing specific games to provide a child.

The bond between many homeless people and their dogs is profound and the health and wellbeing of their canine companions is often a major priority for their owners.\n\nLife on the streets makes it difficult to access the fundamental vet care required to ensure the health and vitality these dogs deserve. StreetVet is a registered practice with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and has been established by a dedicated team of professional vets and veterinary nurses to bring that essential care to homeless people and their dogs across the capital. Together the StreetVet team take their experience out onto the streets of ever expanding locations, seeking out people; their dogs living rough, and delivering care and support required to ensure their combined wellbeing.\n\nCombined with the critical support of a host of renowned organisations backing our team of qualified professionals, StreetVet is changing the future for homeless dogs who may otherwise have to go without the care they need and deserve.\n\nProject Dynamo (Liberty Aviation International Rescue Inc.)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 87-2362688\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 87-2362688\n\nProject Dynamo is an umbrella term encompassing two operations — Digital Dunkirk and Dynamo II. Both efforts are being run by extraordinary civilians with no ties to the U.S. government attempting to do the impossible — saving Americans and Afghan allies who are fearing for their lives as the Taliban regains control of Afghanistan.\n\nWhat Is Digital Dunkirk?\n\nDigital Dunkirk is a veterans coalition locating at-risk individuals and transporting them to temporary safer locations. Once relocated, they await being rescued and taken out of the country.\n\nThe name of the group is a reference to the evacuation of allied forces in Dunkirk during WWII with the help of civilians who volunteered their boats. You can read more about our efforts by using the hashtag #DigitalDunkirk on social media and by browsing our Press page.\n\nWhat Is Dynamo II?\n\nDigital Dunkirk is being assisted by an air branch, known officially as Dynamo II. This is a group of veterans who were contacted for help by their former Afghan interpreters and other people whose lives are at risk. The name is a reference to Operation Dynamo, the movement that evacuated allied soldiers during World War II from the beaches of Dunkirk.\n\nHelp Us Save Americans and Our Allies Abroad\n\nEurasia Foundation (EF)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 52-1780162\n\nWhat We Do\n\nEurasia Foundation equips citizens to build resilient communities.

Our core approach is based on the following guiding principles:\n\nAdaptability\n\nWe adapt our programs to the distinct contexts in which we operate. From addressing barriers to women’s workplace entry to creating platforms for youth participation, we examine individual experiences and use our in-country networks to channel resources that are relevant and useful in the daily lives of our beneficiaries.\n\nCollaboration\n\nWe are committed to building genuine and long-lasting partnerships based on trust and mutual respect. We brainstorm, design, and implement initiatives jointly with our partners on the ground. We consistently seek to improve the quality of our work by listening to stakeholders, partners, and beneficiaries.\n\nInclusivity\n\nWe amplify the voices of marginalized groups, particularly women, youth, minority populations, people with disabilities, and the economically disenfranchised. Our programs reach individuals and groups that reside beyond major cities and hubs and lack access to training opportunities, resources, and networks.\n\nPracticality\n\nWe support the creation of local solutions by building leadership and subject matter expertise within communities. Our programs emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, reinforced with practical applications that help participants apply new skills in real-life settings.\n\nSustainability\n\nWe are committed to developing programs and solutions that can live on beyond our direct engagement. We balance the needs of the present within the context of a complex social, economic and environmental landscape.

We consider human dignity and freedom to be fundamental values. We believe that people anywhere in the world should have the right to make decisions about their lives and to share the rights expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nWe strive for a society that is open, informed, engaged and responsible with respect to problems at home and around the world. We want to actively participate in shaping a society where cultural, ethnic, racial and other differences are a source of enrichment rather than conflict.\n\nWe are an intrinsic part of civil society. Our work is based on the personal initiative and activity of hundreds of our employees and volunteers, both in the Czech Republic and in the dozens of other countries where we operate, as well as the trust and support we are endowed with by individuals, businesses, governments and international institutions.\n\nRead the full text about us...\n\nPolska Akcja Humanitarna (PAH)\n\nPL Regulator (MOJ) — Charity Number: 0000136833\n\nPL Regulator (MOJ) — Charity Number: 0000136833\n\nPL Regulator (MOJ) — Charity Number: 0000136833\n\nWhen an armed conflict breaks out or a natural disaster strikes, the local community is not always able to react to the crisis on its own. State authorities do not have sufficient funds, the people afflicted by disaster suddenly lose their possessions and are deprived of access to safe drinking water and other resources which they might find useful in a crisis. In such cases, immediate humanitarian response is needed.\n\nConflicts and disasters force people to leave their safe homes and to flee and seek shelter far from danger. Shifting frontlines or an unstable socioeconomic situation in the region prevent them from settling safely in one place.\n\nFood and water prices are rising exorbitantly. Some zones are hardly accessible and very often there is no way of delivering any non-food items to them.\n\nAt POLISH HUMANITARIAN ACTION our aim is to provide immediate and effective help to people whose life or health is in danger due to a humanitarian crisis. The principle of humanitarianism, to which we are firmly committed, provides that human suffering must meet with a reaction in any circumstances. We engage in activities intended to immediately provide safe drinking water, food, shelter and the bare essentials to the afflicted people.\n\nWhat we do: https://www.pah.org.pl/en/what-we-do/\n\nAbout Us: https://www.pah.org.pl/en/about-us/\n\nLaw for Life: the Foundation for Public Legal Education\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1143589\n\nLaw for Life: the Foundation for Public Legal Education is an education and information charity that aims to increase access to justice by providing everyone with an awareness of their legal rights together with the confidence and skills to assert them.\n\nWe believe that everyone should understand their legal rights and obligations, and know how to gain redress through the legal system. Yet most people struggle to cope with legal issues, and often don’t know where to go for help.\n\nBeing able to cope with family and housing issues, sorting out employment and benefit matters or difficulties with goods and services is crucial. These issues are the cornerstones of everyday life that can become drivers of poverty and inequality if left unresolved.\n\nWe have the expertise, the practical experience, and the tools to work with any organisation that wants to support the legal needs of their service users.\n\nAdvicenow is a service provided by: https://www.advicenow.org.uk/\n\nFoundation for International Medical Relief of Children (FIMRC)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 20-0274889\n\nFIMRC is a 501(c)(3), nonprofit organization dedicated to improving access to healthcare for families around the world through the implementation of innovative and self-sustaining health programs. Through its network of outpatient clinics and partnerships, FIMRC asserts a multidimensional strategy that includes clinical services, extensive community outreach efforts, and health education programs.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, 90% of FIMRC’s revenue was generated through international global health volunteer travel. Each year, more than 900 volunteers traveled to FIMRC sites around the world, contributing time and resources to FIMRC’s program in exchange for a comprehensive, hands-on global health experience. Since COVID-19, international volunteer travel has been paused and FIMRC’s clinical and preventive health services are entirely funded through donations and participation in virtual volunteer programs.\n\nFIMRC was founded in 2002, is incorporated in Washington, DC and headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The FIMRC team includes more than 3,000 dedicated staff and volunteers worldwide who provide the leadership and support necessary to achieve our mission of improving access to healthcare for children in medically underserved communities.\n\nCountries\n\nCosta Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines, Uganda\n\nChildren\n\nFIMRC focuses on children within all 10 sites, providing services for children whether that is through health promotion and education in local schools, nutrition programs, mental health support, and orphan and vulnerable children programs.\n\nRenewable World\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1119467\n\nCan you imagine your day without power?\n\nFor many communities living in difficult to reach and low-income areas around the world, governments and private companies do not provide the energy services that we often take for granted.\n\nAt Renewable World, we exist to serve alongside these marginalised communities, while also serving our planet as stewards of a carbon-neutral and prosperous future for all.\n\nWe do this by working within a network of talented local partners and remote energy-poor communities to develop affordable and innovative renewable energy solutions that service families living without any means of safe and reliable power.\n\nWhy Energy?\n\nWe believe that access to affordable and reliable energy is critical to providing everything a community needs to thrive: from healthcare to water, to education, to jobs. And yet, more than 840 million people worldwide do not have access to clean, safe energy sources.\n\nIn addition to providing transformative power for communities, energy is also at the centre of a new global challenge: the climate crisis. Unpredictable weather and environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel emissions continue to threaten livelihoods around the world.\n\nSadly, it is often the remote, energy-poor communities that are also most impacted by climate breakdown. It is this joint urgency – to service the most underserved families while working to solve the climate crisis – that we dedicate ourselves.\n\nOur Goal\n\nEvery person deserves the right to determine their own future. Access to energy and a clean environment makes this possible.\n\nWe envision a world where renewable energy is readily accessible to all, helping to end extreme poverty and reduce climate change.\n\nWe are developing and deploying effective solutions that bring renewable energy to scale for poor communities, (em)powering thousands to achieve sustainable and resilient livelihoods.\n\nYou too can (em)power the world.\n\nRead up on this: The energy and climate crisis\n\nTransform Drug Policy Foundation (TDPF)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1100518\n\nPolicy on working with drug, alcohol, pharmaceutical and tobacco (DAPT) industries\n\nTransform believes that drugs should be legally regulated, with retail placed under a system of\n\nstate licensing. Inevitably, this implies that a legitimate commercial market in currently illegal\n\ndrugs will emerge. While our policy models allow for a range of different licensing options, all\n\nwould involve some degree of commercialization. However, Transform also believes that the\n\ngoal of drug policy should be the promotion of public health, social justice and human rights.\n\nThere is, inevitably, a tension between these goals and the pursuit of profit that motivates the\n\nactions of commercial actors in this market.\n\nTransform also highly values its independence and ability to speak truth to power. Therefore, it\n\nis critical that Transform remains, and is seen to remain, unswayed by the influence of\n\ncommercial interests in its work. This can only be achieved by retaining a clear distance\n\nbetween its financial interests and those of the commercial sector.\n\nThe opportunity to enter into financial relationships with DAPT companies has only grown with\n\nthe emergence of large companies engaged in the production and retail of legal cannabis.\n\nTransform recognizes that such enterprises are a valid and inevitable aspect of a regulated\n\nmarket; however, we also believe that public health policy should be designed without the\n\nundue influence of those who primary purpose is profit-maximisation. Therefore, despite the\n\npotential attraction of income, we should strive to remain independent of such influence.\n\nRead more here\n\nDream Foundation (The Dalmatian Dreams Foundation)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 77-0405779\n\nDream Foundation serves terminally-ill adults and their families by providing end-of-life Dreams that offer inspiration, comfort and closure.

BDMLR were founder members of the Marine Animal Rescue Coalition (MARC), an affiliation of organisations with an active interest and involvement in the management of marine mammal strandings in the UK, with a primary focus of improving the response to live cetacean strandings. This has been achieved through sharing information and opinions, encouraging training and equipment, and consideration of the options available for the disposition of beached animals in the context of UK strandings patterns.\n\nEvery year, BDMLR trains over 1000 volunteer Marine Mammal Medics and has 20 whale rescue pontoons located at strategic points throughout the UK, waiting to help stranded whales and dolphins.\n\nEnvironmental Defense Fund (EDF)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 11-6107128\n\nEDF is one of the world’s leading environmental organizations.

In this new field of medicine, modern technology is used alongside natural medicine to produce a holotropic treatment plan, effecting positive change on every level of human existence. This paradigm shift back towards the indigenous worldview will not just alter the way medicine is practiced, but will change the way economies are structured, governments operate, companies are monitored, and how people relate to one another. When we once again see this planet as one living organism of which we are all a part, then we will reverse the negative impact of humankind and cocreate a healthy and happy planet, a true paradise.\n\nThe Ayahuasca Foundation was conceived in the spring of 2008 by Carlos Tanner, an American and student of curanderismo. After living and studying with a curandero for over four years, Carlos worked to provide a safe and effective way for people to not only receive treatment in the healing tradition of the Amazon but also to study the tradition, the way he had with his maestro. The idea for the Ayahuasca Foundation was born from a desire to spread the science of plant medicine back into the world. The Foundation supports the preservation of indigenous wisdom and culture, offering healing retreats and educational courses, and conducting research focused on the ayahuasca healing tradition used for millennia by indigenous healers of the Peruvian Amazon. The Ayahuasca Foundation also supports the preservation of the Amazon rainforest, and promotes educational efforts to raise awareness about sustainability, permaculture, and harmonious environmental relationships. The Foundation participates in community outreach programs and cultural reeducation projects.\n\nThe Travel Foundation\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1065924\n\nWhat we do:\n\nWe tackle the huge environmental and social challenges that global tourism brings.\n\nTourism can bring much needed economic opportunities for local communities and funds for conservation.

We do, however, work on the promotion of mainstream political and social participation and work with the main political parties and democratic institutions to support this agenda.\n\nOur core beliefs\n\nDemocracy is a force for good and politics is the greatest way to deliver change.\n\nYoung people have the potential to shape the present and define the future.\n\nThe quality of decision-making depends on the experiences that inform it.\n\nChange only exists when it is real, measurable and felt\n\nOur values\n\nCOURAGE: We have the courage to stand up and speak; to sit down and listen; and to do what is right, not what is easy.\n\nEMPATHY: We always do our best to stand in someone else’s shoes; feel with their heart; and see through their eyes.\n\nOPENNESS: We are receptive to and respectful of new ideas and ways of thinking, even if they challenge our own.\n\nCURIOSITY: We are constantly questioning and learning as we always seek to better understand the world around us.\n\nCOLLABORATION: We always work together because we know that alone we can do so little, while together we can do so much.\n\nChanging Lives\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 500640\n\nWE ARE CHANGING LIVES\n\nAt Changing Lives we believe that everyone deserves a safe home, a rewarding job and a life free from addiction or abuse.

So why are we helping little molossers? Because it is they who pay a high price because of their popularity.\n\nThis is our everyday life.\n\nCute French and English bulldogs, pugs are almost everywhere - on TV, on gadgets, their images adorn their clothes. Watching these beautiful pictures, bulldogs are often bought carelessly, under the influence of fashion, from pseudo-breeding aimed at quick profit ... Such dogs come to us - those who are often victims of inbreeding and are born with many genetic defects, not immediately visible in first contact, or are improperly farmed - inanimate, without proper medical care, vaccinations. 80% of SAB dogs, that is, those we constantly look after due to their health condition, came to us as puppies. This is largely the opposite of most shelters.\n\nDogs that end up for adoption are often dogs whose breed has outgrown their owners. They suffer from allergies or other skin diseases, are inadequately nourished, or are expensive to maintain, etc.\n\nOur statutory goals are direct help to animals in need, counteracting pseudo-breeding, carrying out adoptions, education in the field of proper treatment of animals.\n\nSince the beginning of SAB’s existence, we have saved 1000 dogs from pseudo-kennels, shelters, interventions, we want to save another 1000 and more. If it wasn’t for the hard, team work of good people, many of these sweet faces that touch the heart would not be in the world anymore. They have a happy life by working together. Let us stay together, let us help, let us be happy that we save these beautiful and beloved creatures.\n\nMedical Detection Dogs (MDD)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1124533\n\nMedical Detection Dogs trains dogs to detect the odour of human disease with the aim of developing faster, more efficient and less invasive diagnostics that lead to better patient outcomes.\n\nWe are at the forefront of the research into the fight against cancer and other life-threatening diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and bacterial infections. Our Bio Detection Dogs are trained to find the odour of those diseases in samples such as urine, breath and sweat and our work has the potential to benefit millions.\n\nWe already apply what we know about the science of canine olfaction to benefit people by training Medical Alert Assistance Dogs to detect minute changes in an individual’s personal odour triggered by their disease and alert them to an impending medical event, helping them manage complex, life-threatening medical conditions and improving their quality of life.\n\nWe take the welfare of our Medical Detection Dogs extremely seriously. From the moment they come to us as puppies we ensure the highest standards of care for our dogs. We have a strict no kennel policy and all our dogs live in the homes of our staff or fantastic local volunteers where they are loved and cared for as part of the family.\n\nWe rely on the generosity of our supporters, charitable trusts and foundations and members of the public to fund our life-saving work.\n\nPencils of Promise (PoP)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 26-3618722\n\nCan you imagine not being able to read this sentence?\n\n250 million children can’t.\n\n250 million children of primary school age lack basic reading, writing and math skills.\n\nWhat does 250 million mean, exactly?\n\n75%. Up to 75% of children in more deprived regions of poor countries can’t read a single word even after several years in school.\n\n$129 Billion. The cost of 250 million children around the world not learning basic skills translates into a loss of an estimated US$129 billion per year\n\nEducation impacts every area of life\n\nA lack of quality education can lead to:\n\nHealth and sanitation issues.\n\nGender inequality\n\nLack of qualified teachers\n\nFinancial economic instability\n\nInfrustructure challenges\n\nWhy education?\n\nEducation leads to higher income, improved health, gender equality and a better future.\n\nEducation provides higher income\n\nA quality education breaks the cycle of poverty. Globally, every year a child completes of primary school increases earnings by 10% and raises the average annual gross domestic product by 0.37%. Children who receive an education are more likely to send their own children to school, preventing the transmission of poverty through generations.\n\nEducation leads to improved health\n\nIf all women completed primary education, the under-5 mortality rate would fall by 15% in low and lower middle income countries, saving almost a million children’s lives every year. Going to school also allows students to learn about healthy hygiene practices, which they can bring into their daily lives.\n\nEducation breaks down the gender gap\n\nGirls who go to school are less likely to marry early or against their will. Education empowers women to make life choices and strengthens girls’ beliefs in their ability to achieve goals.\n\nEducation brings about a better future\n\nWhen all children have access to quality education rooted in human rights and gender equality, it creates a ripple effect of opportunity that influences generations to come. Education continues to be identified as one of the key conditions for determining peace within societies.\n\nCoral Restoration Foundation (CRF)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 65-1054647\n\nWELCOME TO THE BIGGEST CORAL REEF RESTORATION EFFORT ON THE PLANET.\n\nWe are actively restoring coral reefs on a massive scale, educating others on the importance of our oceans, and using science to further coral research and coral reef monitoring techniques.\n\nWe work to support the reefs’ natural recovery processes through the large-scale cultivation, outplanting, and monitoring of genetically diverse, reef-building corals.\n\nWe engage and empower the community to join us to save our planet’s coral reefs with dive programs, educational activities, scientific collaborations, and outreach.\n\nRESTORATION\n\nWE ARE ACTIVELY RESTORING CORAL REEFS ON A MASSIVE SCALE\n\nWe grow corals in offshore Coral Tree™ Nurseries, and then rehome them on carefully selected sites.\n\nSince 2007, we have returned more than 130,000 critically endangered corals back to Florida’s Coral Reef.\n\nMany of these corals have now grown into thriving colonies with the ability to spawn, kick-starting the reefs’ natural process of recovery.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nOUR APPROACH IS GUIDED BY RESEARCH AND COLLABORATION\n\nWe work with 415 coral genotypes across 11 species, to ensure that we are restoring the reefs’ genetic diversity and resilience.\n\nWe rigorously monitor our outplanted corals and use data to inform our strategic development.\n\nWe collaborate with universities, aquariums, NGOs, and government agencies including NOAA and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nWE ARE ENGAGING AND EMPOWERING THE COMMUNITY\n\nRecreational Dive Programs let all ocean lovers make a difference.

As early as 1995, WICGR scientists recognized the need to bring the power of genomics to the understanding of human disease. It launched pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among scientists from across MIT and Harvard who pioneered new approaches to cancer and human genetics.\n\nIn parallel, Harvard Medical School-based scientists established the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB) in 1998, to facilitate the pursuit of chemical genetics as an academic discipline and a tool to further understand human biology and disease. In 2002, the ICCB was awarded an Initiative for Chemical Genetics (ICG) grant from the National Cancer Institute, and its successful Investigator-Initiated Screening Program facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.\n\nThese projects demonstrated the power of enabling scientists to collaborate to tackle the major challenges in molecular medicine. It was clear that a new type of formal organization was required — open, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and able to organize projects at any scale. In addition, it was important that the complementary expertise of the genomic scientists and the chemical biologists across MIT and Harvard be brought together in one place to drive the transformation of medicine with molecular knowledge.\n\nYoungMinds\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1016968\n\nSC Regulator (OSCR) — Charity Number: SC039700\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe’re leading the fight for a future where all young minds are supported and empowered, whatever the challenges.\n\nDid you know?\n\n3 children in every classroom have a mental health problem.

Anyone making serious claims in public debate—fact checkers included—should be prepared to:\n\nGet their facts right\n\nBack up what they say with evidence\n\nCorrect their mistakes.\n\nWhat we do\n\nWe fight bad information in different ways. First, we fact check claims made by politicians, public institutions and journalists, as well as viral content online. We all deserve information we can trust.\n\nWe follow up on our fact checks.

Founder, Spencer Beebe, set out to work with Indigenous people in the world’s largest intact coastal temperate rainforest, located in northwestern BC. He soon realized that he needed a Canadian partner organization and, in 1994, asked one of his Canadian Ecotrust board members, Jacqueline Koerner, to take the lead on founding Ecotrust Canada. Jacqueline became Founding Chair and soon environmental journalist, Ian Gill, became the organization’s first executive director. In 1995, Ecotrust Canada received charitable status, marking the beginning of its journey toward building resilient economies in rural, remote, and Indigenous communities.\n\nOur Mission\n\nBuilding an Economy that Provides for Life. Ecotrust Canada works with rural, remote and Indigenous communities toward building an economy that provides for a healthy and resilient natural environment; sustainable and abundant energy, food, and housing; prosperous and meaningful livelihoods; and vibrant cultures and inclusive societies. We call this approach,\n\nA System in Need of Change\n\nWe assert that our current economy, which is dependent on ever-increasing growth, resource extraction, and unrestrained consumption, is fundamentally at odds with the social and environmental needs of the world. Climate change, global financial instability, and an ever-widening gap between rich and poor, are just the latest indicators of capitalism’s mounting failures. Unfortunately, this system has behind it the weight and momentum of several centuries of relentless growth across an entire planet. It is a system so dominant in our lives that we can no longer bring ourselves to imagine there are viable alternatives. We have lost sight of the fact that an economy can, and should, be changed to suit the needs of people and planet.\n\nONE\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 01-0593565\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 02-0544768\n\nONE is a global movement campaigning to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, so that everyone, everywhere can lead a life of dignity and opportunity.\n\nWe believe the fight against poverty isn’t about charity, but about justice and equality.\n\nWhether lobbying political leaders in world capitals or running cutting-edge grassroots campaigns, ONE pressures governments to do more to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa, and empowers citizens to hold their governments to account.\n\nONE’s supporters are crucial to this work.

A mother bear would never willingly part with her cub, meaning most cubs traded have already witnessed their mother's death.\n\nFree the Bears has become a world leader in rescued cub care. Some of the cubs we receive are as young as a month old. They cannot crawl and require 24 hour care, as well as 7 feeds a day.\n\nFree the Bears hopes that one day rehabilitated bears will be able to be released back to the wild. This huge undertaking involves studies of bear behaviour and welfare as well as research on protected areas for safe release.\n\nMeanwhile, these bears need to be looked after at our world-class sanctuaries. They need rehabilitation, food, living space, enrichment activities, medical provisions and lots of care. We rely on your support to help us help these bears. Learn more about sun bears and moon bears with our FAQ fact sheet.\n\nWithout protected forest for release and lifespans of 30-40 years, we're providing lifelong care to hundreds of rescued sun bears and moon bears. Both species are listed as Vulnerable to Extinction. We can only provide this care with your help.\n\nDue to COVID-19 fundraising sources have disappeared and we're really struggling. PLEASE HELP by becoming a BEAR CARER (Bear Buddy is less than the cost of a coffee per week) or BEAR SPONSOR.\n\nVolunteering at Free the Bears sanctuaries offers an amazing and unique opportunity to join our experienced team and look after sun and moon bears rescued from the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nMore on this can be found at: https://freethebears.org/pages/volunteer-at-our-sanctuaries.\n\nA fun and fascinating behind-the-scenes tour of our gorgeous Bear Rescue Centre.\n\nReservations can be made by calling: +856 (0) 209 556 1025 or +856 (0) 205 691 9988.\n\nMore info on this can be found at: https://freethebears.org/pages/bear-care-tour-laos\n\nA fun and fascinating behind-the-scenes tour at the world’s biggest sun bear sanctuary!\n\nReservations can be made please call: +855 (0)92 434 597 or learn more at: https://freethebears.org/pages/bear-care-tour-cambodia\n\nGlobal Child Nutrition Foundation (GCNF)\n\nUS Regulator (IRS) — Charity Number: 20-5094658\n\nMISSION\n\nWe expand opportunities for the world’s children to receive adequate nutrition for learning and achieving their potential.\n\nVISION\n\nWe envision a future where school meals sustainably nourish all children and help them, their families, communities, and nations to thrive.\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe GCNF team is a high-caliber group of engaged domestic and international leaders with public and private sector experience in child nutrition and related fields. GCNF’s Board of Directors and Senior Staff work closely together to support school meal programs that help children and communities thrive.\n\nWhy is GCNF's work needed?\n\nUnfortunately, coverage is the weakest in the very situations where the need is the greatest; in low-income countries, only about 18% of school children are provided school meals as opposed to 49% in upper-middle-income countries.\n\nThe Mission to Seafarers\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1123613\n\nWhat are Seafarers?\n\nA seafarer is defined as anyone who works onboard a seagoing ship.\n\nCollectively, there are over 1.5 million seafarers across the world made up of various nationalities. These are men and women often spend up to 9 months at a time far away from their family, friends and loved ones. This can often lead to loneliness and mental health issues, with limited access to internet onboard ships.\n\nSeafarers are responsible for transporting over 90% of the world’s goods and fuels, making them essential key workers who often go unrecognised by the general population.\n\nWorking in 200 ports and 50 countries\n\nThe Mission is open night and day, 365 days a year. We work in 200 ports across 50 countries, caring for seafarers of all ranks, nationalities and beliefs.\n\nThroughout a long and distinguished history, The Mission to Seafarers has grown to become one of the largest sea port-based welfare operators in the world.\n\nOur International Headquarters in London supports over 70 front line staff and around 100 Honorary Chaplains. We also rely heavily on volunteers, who visit ships, drive minibuses and help us run our Seafarers Centres.\n\nWithout the help and support of our dedicated volunteers, we wouldn’t be able to respond to as many Seafarers as we do.\n\nTo find out which ports we work in, take a look at our ports page.\n\nThe Mission to Seafarers\n\nThe Mission to Seafarers is here to support the men and women working at sea when they need us most.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of facilities available, all of our Seafarers Centres, spread across 50 countries, aim to provide Seafarers with:\n\nAccess to WiFi Internet and SIM cards\n\nA comfortable place to rest and relax\n\nThe chance to get food and toiletries\n\nTransport to shops and local amenities\n\nAnd it’s not just practical support the Mission offers. We know that seafarers need emotional and frequently spiritual support too.\n\nThat’s why we have a large network of ordained Port Chaplains who come on board ships, giving seafarers a listening ear and offering prayer, if needed. They can also connect seafarers to other organisations, or speak to them on their behalf.\n\nOur mission is to care for the shipping industry’s most important asset: its people.\n\nWe are here for Seafarers.\n\nShareAction (registered as Fairshare Educational Foundation)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1117244\n\nOur vision is a world where ordinary savers and institutional investors work together to ensure our communities and environment are safe and sustainable for all.\n\nOur mission is to unleash the positive potential of the mainstream investment system.

It requires dogged work by journalists, and often, the courage of whistleblowers and others who work to ensure that the public actually learns what it has a right to know.\n\nOperation Encompass\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1169147\n\nNB: During COVID-19\n\nOperation Encompass is a police and education early information sharing partnership enabling schools to offer immediate support for children and young people experiencing domestic abuse. Information is shared by the police with a school's trained Key Adult (DSL) prior to the start of the next school day after officers have attended a domestic abuse incident thus enabling appropriate support to be given, dependent upon the needs and wishes of the child.\n\nChildren experiencing domestic abuse are negatively impacted by this exposure; domestic abuse has been identified as an Adverse Childhood Experience and can lead to emotional, physical and psychological harm. Operation Encompass aims to mitigate this harm by enabling immediate support, making a child's day better and giving them a better tomorrow.\n\nOperation Encompass directly connects the police with schools to secure better outcomes for children who are subject or witness to police-attended incidents of domestic abuse. Rapid provision of support within the school environment means children are better safeguarded against the short, medium and long-term effects of domestic abuse.\n\nIt is our aim to ensure that Operation Encompass is in every Force, in every school, for every child.\n\nThe Operation Encompass website is designed to:\n\nProvide training for Key Adults and a register of Key Adults.\n\nProvide a register of Police Forces taking part in Operation Encompass.\n\nProvide resources so that a school can participate successfully in Operation Encompass.\n\nAllow schools and police forces to actively share good practice.\n\nOperation Encompass ensures there is a simple phone call or notification, to a trained member of school staff, before a child arrives in school. The call or notification is triggered by police recently attending the child’s home or being involved in a domestic abuse incident, that the child has experienced.\n\nGlobal Justice Now Trust (GJN)\n\nUK Regulator (CCEW) — Charity Number: 1064066\n\nWe are a democratic social justice organisation working as part of a global movement to challenge the powerful and create a more just and equal world.
