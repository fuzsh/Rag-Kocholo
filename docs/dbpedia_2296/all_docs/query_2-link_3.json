        "text": "Typhus is caused by two types of bacteria: Rickettsia typhi or Rickettsia prowazekii.\n\nRickettsia typhi causes endemic or murine typhus.\n\nEndemic typhus is uncommon in the United States. It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor, and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called \"jail fever.\" The bacteria that cause this type of typhus is usually spread from rats to fleas to humans.\n\nMurine typhus occurs in the southern United States, including California and Texas. It is often seen during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly. You are more likely to get this type of typhus if you are around rat feces or fleas, and other animals such as cats, possums, raccoons, and skunks.\n\nRickettsia prowazekii causes epidemic typhus. It is spread by lice.\n\nBrill-Zinsser disease is a mild form of epidemic typhus. It occurs when the bacteria become active again in a person who was previously infected. It is more common in older adults.\n\nSymptoms of murine or endemic typhus may include:\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nBackache\n\nDull red rash that begins on the middle of the body and spreads\n\nFever, can be extremely high, 105째F to 106째F (40.6째C to 41.1째C) and can last up to 2 weeks\n\nHacking, dry cough\n\nHeadache\n\nJoint and muscle pain\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nSymptoms of epidemic typhus may include:\n\nHigh fever, chills\n\nConfusion, decreased alertness, delirium\n\nCough\n\nSevere muscle and joint pain\n\nLights that appear very bright; light may hurt the eyes\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nRash that begins on the chest and spreads to the rest of the body (except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet)\n\nSevere headache\n\nThe early rash is a light rose color and fades when you press on it. Later, the rash becomes dull and red and does not fade. People with severe typhus may also develop small areas of bleeding into the skin.\n\nDiagnosis is often based on a physical examination and detailed information about the symptoms. You may be asked if you recall being bitten by fleas. If the health care provider suspects typhus, you will be started on medicines right away. Blood tests will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTreatment includes the following antibiotics:\n\nDoxycycline\n\nTetracycline\n\nChloramphenicol (less common)\n\nTetracycline taken by mouth can permanently stain teeth that are still forming. Tetracycline is usually not prescribed for:\n\nChildren until after all of their permanent teeth have grown\n\nPregnant women\n\nPeople with epidemic typhus may need oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids.\n\nPeople with epidemic typhus who receive treatment quickly should completely recover. Without treatment, death can occur, with those over age 60 having the highest risk of death.\n\nOnly a small number of untreated people with murine typhus may die. Prompt antibiotic treatment will cure nearly all people with murine typhus.\n\nAvoid being in areas where you might encounter rat fleas or lice. Good sanitation and public health measures reduce the rat population.\n\nMeasures to get rid of lice when an infection has been found include:\n\nBathing\n\nBoiling clothes or avoiding infested clothing for at least 5 days (lice will die without feeding on blood)\n\nUsing insecticides (10% DDT, 1% malathion, or 1% permethrin)"
