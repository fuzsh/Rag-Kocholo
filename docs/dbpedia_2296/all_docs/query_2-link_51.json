        "meta_description": "Author summary Murine typhus is an acute febrile, flea-borne bacterial disease that has been reported worldwide and continues to cause significant morbidity when untreated. The often self-limiting, non-specific clinical symptoms of the disease resemble that of common viral illnesses, suggesting that the disease is underdiagnosed. While the mortality in treated cases is estimated to be very low, disease complications in one-fourth of all patients and a prolonged duration of fever in untreated cases have been reported. We systematically searched the literature to identify articles describing laboratory diagnostically confirmed clinical cases of untreated murine typhus and summarized disease outcomes, including mortality, of patients in eligible studies. Of the 12 studies containing 239 untreated patients that matched the eligibility criteria, only one study reported a single death amongst 28 untreated patients, resulting in a patient series fatality rate of 3.6% and an overall untreated fatality rate of 0.4%. Disease complications were mentioned in 10 of 12 studies and the mean duration of fever in untreated cases was 15 days in two studies and 12.7 days in one study, demonstrating the significant morbidity caused by untreated murine typhus and highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of this neglected disease.",

        "text": "Results\n\nStudy selection\n\nScreening of search results identified 148 potentially eligible articles for which full-texts were sought. Of these, 134 articles did not match the eligibility criteria after reviewing the full-text and for further two articles full-text was not retrievable, which resulted in a total of 12 studies included for analysis. A summary of the study selection process is given in Fig 1, for a list of articles excluded after full-text review see S2 Table.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008641.g001\n\nStudy characteristics\n\nThe 12 included studies contained a total of 239 untreated patients, with the smallest series containing five and the largest 60 untreated patients. The series cover a time span from 1942 to 2016. Three studies were conducted in the years before efficacious antibiotic treatment was available, which includes the only study with a reported death attributed to untreated murine typhus [9]. This study retrospectively reviewed patients in the British Army Middle East Forces. The other included studies were a prospective study of an outbreak in Panama in 1947 [10], a trial of drug therapy with para-aminobenzoic acid compared with no treatment in Puerto Rico [11], a retrospective chart review of patients presenting at a hospital in Israel from 1976 to 1985 [12], another reviewing patients at four hospitals in southern Texas from 1980 to 1987 [13], a prospective and retrospective study of patients in a hospital in Spain from 1979 to 1995 [14], a second study from Spain reviewing patients presenting at a hospital in the Canary islands from 2000 to 2002 [15], a prospective study of Bedouin children presenting at a hospital in Israel from 2003 to 2005 [16], a retrospective study of patients diagnosed in a district in New Zealand in 2006 [17], a retrospective outbreak investigation in Texas conducted by the CDC and Texas authorities in 2008 [18], a retrospective study of patients diagnosed in Tunisia from 2006 to 2008 [19] and a retrospective chart review of patients presenting at two hospitals in Texas from 2013 to 2016 [20]. All included studies were published in English.\n\nApart from the studies in New Zealand, Tunisia and the outbreak investigation in Texas all studies were hospital-based. Treated patients were encountered in 83% (10/12) of the included studies and these were excluded from the untreated patient series. The geographic distribution of the included studies is shown in Fig 2 and a summary of the characteristics of the included studies is given in Table 1. Demographic and clinical characteristics were often only available for the entire study population, and this information was provided in the table when there was no specific information available for the untreated patient group. In summary, for the untreated group, information on age and sex was available for 17% (2/12) and on fever duration and complications for 33% (4/12) of the studies.\n\na Three studies. b Two studies. c Study in the Middle East Forces, countries not specified.

Of the 12 included studies, three were prospective, seven retrospective, one pro- and retrospective and for one study it was not specified. In 10 of 12 studies patients had to be excluded because of efficacious treatment, which resulted in the exclusion of 367 patients. Only one of the 12 included studies specified measuring R. prowazekii titers for all patients to differentiate endemic from epidemic typhus. Ten studies did not differentiate from R. prowazekii and in one study three of 13 patients were diagnosed only using the Weil-Felix test. There was a high frequency of missing clinical and patient information across the included patient series, only one study had no missing information. Details of the bias assessment for each study can be found in S3 Table.\n\nPrimary outcome\n\nThe primary outcome was available for all included studies. The only death among all untreated patients diagnosed with murine typhus occurred in the study of 28 patients in the Middle East Forces, resulting in a fatality rate of 3.6% for this patient series. The patient died on the 16th or 17th day of disease and the post-mortem study showed a haemorrhagic bronchopneumonia with abscess formation in the lung and microscopic haemorrhages with scanty cellular nodes in the brain.\n\nWhen combined with all other patient series that reported no deaths, there was one death in 239 untreated patients, corresponding to a fatality rate of 0.4%.\n\nDemographics and secondary outcomes\n\nSpecific information on age and sex was available only for 17% (40/239) of the untreated patients. In this group, the age range was 15–60 years, with a mean age of 30.6 years specified in one study, and the male percentage was 73% (29/40). When combined with findings from studies that reported demographic information inclusive of treated patients, 59% (231/389) of diagnosed patients with murine typhus were male. The study among the Middle East forces did not give demographic information but likely further skewed the sex distribution. Only one study reported an excess of female patients.\n\nDuration of fever\n\nIn the studies that provided information on the duration of fever in untreated patients, the minimum specified duration of fever was 12 days, with the maximum ranging from 17 to 22 days. The mean duration of fever was 15 days in two studies while one study reported a mean of 12.7 days. This latter study noted a mean duration of fever of 12.5 days when treated patients were included. Specific information on fever duration in untreated patients was available in 46% (111/239).\n\nComplications\n\nTable 2 gives an overview of the key outcome findings in untreated patients of the included studies. Of the seven studies which examined complications in untreated patients, only the study conducted among Bedouin children recorded no complications. Two studies reported no complications in the untreated, but described significant complications in the treated patients: in one study three of 14 treated patients had renopulmonary or central nervous system (CNS) complications and in the other study complications included renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and CNS involvement, with seven of 72 treated patients admitted to an intensive care unit and three deaths due to shock, renal and multisystem failure. Of the studies that specified complications in a cohort inclusive of treated patients, three studies noted hospitalisation rates of 84% (36/43), 75% (9/12) and 70% (23/33), with nine of the 33 patients (27%) admitted to an intensive care unit because of pneumonia, coagulopathy or renal failure, one study stated complications including pneumonitis, cerebellitis and multiorgan failure in nine (8.6%) out of 104 patients with murine typhus, in four (3.8%) of those classified as severe and one study reported complications in 25 of 90 patients (28%) including pulmonary, CNS, gastrointestinal and muscular involvement, with 13 of 90 (14%) requiring ICU care.\n\nFive of the 12 studies had all patients hospitalised, more than 50% of the patients were hospitalised in a further five studies, 1.3% in one study and in one study it was not specified.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008641.t002\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis review of 239 untreated murine typhus patients found a low fatality rate of 0.4% but reported significant morbidity, including a mean fever duration of up to 15 days, hospitalisation rates above 50% and complications in 6–30% with pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, muscular and CNS involvement. No complications were found in a study among 47 Bedouin children [16], potentially indicating a possibly milder course in the younger age group. Similarly, another study not eligible for inclusion in this review found a usually mild to moderate systemic illness but rarely severe complications in 97 children in Texas [21].\n\nInformation on demographics and secondary outcomes for untreated patients was limited since 10 of the 12 studies also contained treated patients and information was often only available for the entire study population. The review suggested a predominance of male patients and only one study reported an excess of female patients.\n\nNine of the 12 included studies were from a period in which antibiotic treatment was widely used and all of them included treated patients. None of these were randomised clinical trials, and in the antibiotic era only patients with a mild and self-limiting course remained untreated while patients with more severe disease received antibiotics. Additionally, reporting of severe complications or deaths in untreated patients in these antibiotic era studies would have caused ethical concerns. Since today efficacious treatment is often available, it is therefore unlikely that complications and fatalities in untreated murine typhus patients will be reported in the literature, apart from in retrospective case series. Two studies in this review reported no complications in the untreated, but significant complications in the treated patients including three deaths. This may be because those with severe disease had a higher probability of receiving antibiotics.\n\nThis study tried to limit the possibility of including confounding R. prowazekii infections in the studies reviewed by only including laboratory assay confirmed patient series of murine typhus. However, the exclusion of studies that used the Weil-Felix test as the only diagnostic method significantly restricted the number of eligible studies. The Weil-Felix test was the major diagnostic test in the decades before efficacious antibiotic treatment was available and a substantial number of studies from this period reporting deaths from untreated murine typhus had to be excluded–whether they represented epidemic or murine typhus is unknown. The Weil-Felix test is still commonly used in low resource settings today, where infrastructure for modern laboratory assay confirmed diagnosis is not available. This setting is especially encountered in poorer countries from which studies are expected to be underrepresented in this review. Furthermore, the requirement of a laboratory assay confirmed diagnosis likely led to a tendency of selecting studies that were hospital-based, in which the necessary infrastructure was available and where patients likely received better care. Alternatively, only patients with a more severe disease course might have sought hospital care. In this review nine of the 12 included studies were hospital-based.\n\nBut even with contemporary serological assays, differentiation of R. typhi from R. prowazekii, which has an estimated mortality of ~20% in untreated patients [22], is difficult. Human antibody response to R. typhi antigen cross-reacts with R. prowazekii antigen and while the two diseases can sometimes be distinguished by comparing the titers against R. typhi and R. prowazekii, a definite differentiation often requires additional techniques such as Western blotting and cross-adsorption, which is costly and restricted to laboratories with facilities for safe culturing of rickettsiae [7]. Only one of the 12 included studies specified measuring R. prowazekii titers for all patients to differentiate from epidemic typhus and no study reported using additional techniques for differentiation, therefore it cannot be excluded that some cases in this review might have been due to R. prowazekii infection.\n\nThe first more widely used serological test with better accuracy at identifying infection with R. typhi was introduced in 1942 [23], but widespread use of effective antibiotic therapy started soon after its discovery in the beginning of the nineteen-fifties [24]. This leaves a small window of a few years when diagnostic methods were available to exclude epidemic typhus but effective treatment was still unknown. Unfortunately, for this period, few studies were encountered that described patient series of untreated murine typhus with outcome measures, and later studies had to deal with the ethical issue of reporting untreated patients in an era when effective antibiotic treatment was available. Although a better powered estimate of the untreated mortality of murine typhus could be obtained from historic records that used the Weil-Felix test for diagnosis, this would require subjective linking of test results with clinical, epidemiological and environmental information, including knowledge of local historic occurrence of R. prowazekii. However, especially in older studies, there might be confusion with Brill-Zinsser disease, a recrudescent form of epidemic typhus with usually milder symptoms that may resemble those of murine typhus.\n\nFatality rates are likely to be influenced by multiple factors, including clinical syndrome, age, nutritional status and intensity of supportive care but our sample size does not allow such analysis. In one study the hospital mortality of R. typhi/Rickettsia spp. central nervous system infections was estimated at 18% [25].\n\nThe estimated untreated mortality of murine typhus in our review is low when compared with other findings in the literature. Civen et al. stated a fatality rate of 4% in untreated patients and 1% in patients with antibiotic treatment [2]. In one of the included studies in our review, the fatality rate among treated, hospitalised murine typhus patients was 3.8% [13] while in another study, not included here, a fatality rate of 0.4% was reported in a patient series of 3,048 murine typhus cases from 1985 to 2015 in Texas, a time period in which effective antibiotic treatment was available [26]. Possible explanations for these differences in reported fatality rates might be differences in patient demographics and clinical features, including age and comorbidities, differences in time from symptom onset until effective treatment is given, variability in pathogen virulence and a bias towards more severity in hospital-based studies."
