        "text": "What it is\n\nEpidemic typhus, also called louse-borne typhus, is an uncommon disease caused by a bacteria called Rickettsia prowazekii. Epidemic typhus is spread to people through contact with infected body lice.\n\nThough epidemic typhus was responsible for millions of deaths in previous centuries, it is now considered a rare disease. Occasionally, cases continue to occur in areas where extreme overcrowding is common and body lice can travel from one person to another.\n\nIn the United States, rare cases of epidemic typhus, called sylvatic typhus, can occur. These cases occur when people are exposed to flying squirrels and their nests.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nSymptoms of epidemic typhus begin within 2 weeks after contact with infected body lice. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\nFever and chills\n\nHeadache\n\nRapid breathing\n\nBody and muscle aches\n\nRash\n\nCough\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nConfusion\n\nBrill-Zinsser disease\n\nSome people can remain infected, without symptoms, for years after they first get sick. Rarely, these individuals can have a relapse in disease, called Brill-Zinsser disease, months or years following their first illness. When this happens, it often occurs when the body's immune system is weakened due to certain medications, old age, or illness. The symptoms of Brill-Zinsser disease are similar to the original infection, but are usually milder than the initial illness.\n\nPrevention\n\nNo vaccine is available to prevent epidemic typhus.\n\nBody lice thrive in areas that are overcrowded and where people aren't able to bathe or change clothes regularly.\n\nTo avoid body louse infestations:\n\nBathe regularly and change into clean clothes at least once a week.\n\nWash louse-infested clothing at least once a week.\n\nMachine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using hot water (at least 130Â°F), and dry on high heat when possible.\n\nClothing and items that are not washable can be dry-cleaned OR sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks.\n\nDo not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person who has body lice or is infected with typhus.\n\nTreat bedding, uniforms, and other clothing with 0.5% permethrin. Permethrin kills lice and may provide long-lasting protection for clothing for many washings. See product information to learn how long the protection will last. If treating items yourself, follow the product instructions carefully. Do NOT use permethrin products directly on skin. They are intended to treat clothing.\n\nAvoid contact with flying squirrels and their nests.\n\nTesting and diagnosis\n\nThe symptoms of epidemic typhus are similar to symptoms of many other diseases. See your healthcare provider if you develop the symptoms listed above following travel or contact with animals. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had contact with flying squirrels or their nests.\n\nYour healthcare provider will order a blood test to look for epidemic typhus and other diseases. Laboratory testing and reporting of results can take several weeks. Your healthcare provider may start treatment before results are available.\n\nTreatment\n\nEpidemic typhus should be treated with the antibiotic doxycycline. Doxycycline can be used in persons of any age.\n\nAntibiotics are most effective when given soon after symptoms begin. People who are treated early with doxycycline usually recover quickly."
