        "text": "Overview\n\nTyphoid fever, also called enteric fever, is caused by salmonella bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in places where few people carry the bacteria. It also is rare where water is treated to kill germs and where human waste disposal is managed. One example of where typhoid fever is rare is the United States. Places with the highest number of cases or with regular outbreaks are in Africa and South Asia. It is a serious health threat, especially for children, in places where it is more common.\n\nFood and water with the bacteria in it cause typhoid fever. Close contact with a person who is carrying the salmonella bacteria also can cause typhoid fever. Symptoms include:\n\nHigh fever.\n\nHeadache.\n\nStomach pain.\n\nConstipation or diarrhea.\n\nMost people who have typhoid fever feel better about a week after they start treatment to kill bacteria, called antibiotics. But without treatment, there is a small chance of death from typhoid fever complications. Vaccines against typhoid fever can provide some protection. But they can't protect against all cases of illness caused by other strains of salmonella. Vaccines can help lower risk of getting typhoid fever.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms are likely to start slowly, often showing up 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the bacteria.\n\nEarly illness\n\nEarly symptoms include:\n\nFever that starts low and increases throughout the day, possibly reaching as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).\n\nChills.\n\nHeadache.\n\nWeakness and fatigue.\n\nMuscle aches.\n\nStomach pain.\n\nDiarrhea or constipation.\n\nRash.\n\nPeople also may have a cough, loss of appetite and sweating.\n\nLater illness\n\nA few weeks after symptoms start, the illness can cause problems in the intestines. People may have:\n\nStomach pain.\n\nVery swollen stomach.\n\nAn infection caused by gut bacteria spreading throughout the body, called sepsis.\n\nIn very serious cases, people may:\n\nBecome confused.\n\nNot be able to pay attention to anything around them.\n\nNot be able to react to the world around them.\n\nThese are life-threatening complications.\n\nIn some people, symptoms may return up to a few weeks after the fever has gone away.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nSee a health care provider right away if you think you might have typhoid fever.\n\nIf you get sick while traveling in a foreign country, know who to call for a list of providers. For some that might be the closest embassy or consulate.\n\nIf you have symptoms after you return home, consider seeing a provider who focuses on international travel medicine or infectious diseases. This might help get typhoid fever diagnosed and treated more quickly.\n\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\n\nSign up for free and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips, current health topics, and expertise on managing health.

Other strains of salmonella bacteria cause a similar disease called paratyphoid fever.\n\nPeople pick up the bacteria most often in places where outbreaks are common. The bacteria passes out of the body in the stool and urine of people who are carrying the bacteria. Without careful hand-washing after going to the bathroom, the bacteria can move from the hands to objects or other people.\n\nThe bacteria also can spread from a person who carries the bacteria. It can spread on food that isn't cooked, such as raw fruits without a peel. In places where water isn't treated to kill germs, you can pick up the bacteria from that source. This includes drinking water, using ice made from untreated water, or by drinking unpasteurized milk or juice.\n\nTyphoid carriers\n\nEven after antibiotic treatment, a small number of people who recover from typhoid fever still have the bacteria living in their bodies. These people are known as chronic carriers. They no longer have symptoms of the disease. But they still shed the bacteria in their stools and spread it.\n\nRisk factors\n\nTyphoid fever is a serious worldwide threat and affects millions of people each year. Places with the highest number of cases or with regular outbreaks are in Africa and South Asia. But cases are recorded worldwide, often due to travelers to and from these areas.\n\nIf you live in a country where typhoid fever is rare, you're at increased risk if you:\n\nWork in or travel to areas where typhoid fever is established, especially if you travel to visit family or friends. People visiting loved ones may have higher social pressure to drink or eat foods that present a higher risk.\n\nWork as a clinical microbiologist handling Salmonella enterica serotype typhi bacteria.\n\nHave close contact with someone who is infected or has recently been infected with typhoid fever.\n\nComplications\n\nDamage to the intestines\n\nTyphoid fever complications can include damage and bleeding in the intestines. Typhoid fever also can cause cells in the walls of the small intestine or large bowel to die off. This allows the contents of the gut to leak into the body. That can cause severe stomach pain, vomiting and infection throughout the body called sepsis.\n\nDamage to the intestines can develop in the later part of the illness. These life-threatening complications require immediate medical care.\n\nOther possible complications include:\n\nInflammation of the heart muscle, called myocarditis.\n\nInflammation of the lining of the heart and valves, called endocarditis.\n\nInfection of major blood vessels, called mycotic aneurysm.\n\nPneumonia.\n\nInflammation of the pancreas, called pancreatitis.\n\nKidney or bladder infections.\n\nInfection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, called meningitis.\n\nPsychiatric problems, such as delirium, hallucinations and paranoid psychosis.\n\nPrevention\n\nPeople can get a vaccination against typhoid fever. This is an option if you live where typhoid fever is common. It is also an option if you plan to travel to a place where the risk is high.\n\nWhere typhoid fever is common, access to treated water helps avoid contact with the Salmonella enterica serotype typhi bacteria. Management of human waste also helps people avoid the bacteria. And careful hand-washing for people who prepare and serve food is also important.\n\nVaccines\n\nTwo vaccines are available in the United States for people age 2 and older.\n\nOne is given as a single shot at least one week before travel.\n\nOne is given orally in four capsules, with one capsule to be taken every other day.\n\nThe effectiveness of these vaccines wears off over time. So repeat immunization is needed.\n\nBecause the vaccine won't provide complete protection, follow these guidelines when traveling to high-risk areas:\n\nWash your hands. Frequent hand-washing in hot, soapy water is the best way to control infection. Wash before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for times when soap and water aren't available.\n\nAvoid using untreated water. Contaminated drinking water is a problem in areas where typhoid fever is common. For that reason, drink only bottled water or canned or bottled carbonated beverages, wine and beer. Carbonated bottled water is safer than noncarbonated bottled water. Ask for drinks without ice. Use bottled water to brush your teeth, and try not to swallow water in the shower.\n\nAvoid raw fruits and vegetables. Because raw produce may have been washed in contaminated water, avoid fruits and vegetables that you can't peel, especially lettuce. To be safe, you may want to avoid raw foods.\n\nChoose hot foods. Avoid food that's stored or served at room temperature. Freshly made, steaming hot foods may be less risky than uncooked foods.\n\nKnow where the health care providers are. Find out about medical care in the areas you'll visit. Carry a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of health care providers.\n\nJan 28, 2023\n\nLoscalzo J, et al., eds. Salmonellosis.
