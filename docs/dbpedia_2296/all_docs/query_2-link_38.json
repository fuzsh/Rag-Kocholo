        "text": "Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs. Without prompt treatment, it can cause serious complications and can be fatal.\n\nIt's caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi, which is related to the bacteria that cause salmonella food poisoning.\n\nTyphoid fever is highly contagious. An infected person can pass the bacteria out of their body in their poo or, less commonly, in their pee.\n\nIf someone else eats food or drinks water that's been contaminated with a small amount of infected poo or pee, they can become infected with the bacteria and develop typhoid fever.\n\nRead more about the causes of typhoid fever.\n\nWho's affected?\n\nTyphoid fever is most common in parts of the world that have poor sanitation and limited access to clean water.\n\nWorldwide, children are thought to be most at risk of developing typhoid fever. This may be because their immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) is still developing.\n\nBut children with typhoid fever tend to have milder symptoms than adults.\n\nTyphoid fever is uncommon in the UK, with around 300 infections confirmed each year.\n\nMost of these people became infected while visiting relatives in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. But you're also at risk if you visit Asia, Africa or South America.\n\nSymptoms of typhoid fever\n\nThe main symptoms of typhoid fever are:\n\na persistent high temperature that gradually increases each day\n\nheadache\n\ngeneral aches and pains\n\nextreme tiredness (fatigue)\n\ncough\n\nconstipation\n\nAs the infection progresses, you may lose your appetite, feel sick, and have a tummy ache and diarrhoea. Some people may develop a rash.\n\nIf typhoid fever isn't treated, the symptoms will continue to get worse over the following weeks and the risk of developing potentially fatal complications will increase.\n\nRead more about the symptoms of typhoid fever and the complications of typhoid fever.\n\nHow typhoid fever is treated\n\nTyphoid fever requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.\n\nIf typhoid fever is diagnosed early, the infection is likely to be mild and can usually be treated at home with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotic tablets.\n\nMore severe typhoid fever usually requires admission to hospital so antibiotic injections can be given.\n\nWith prompt antibiotic treatment, most people will start to feel better within a few days and serious complications are very rare.\n\nDeaths from typhoid fever are now virtually unheard of in the UK.\n\nIf typhoid fever isn't treated, it's estimated that up to 1 in 5 people with the condition will die.\n\nSome of those who survive will have complications caused by the infection.\n\nRead more about treating typhoid fever.\n\nTyphoid fever vaccination\n\nIn the UK, 2 vaccines are available that can provide some protection against typhoid fever.\n\nThese involve either having a single injection or taking 3 capsules over alternate days.\n\nVaccination is recommended for anyone planning to travel to parts of the world where typhoid fever is widespread.\n\nThe areas with the highest rates of typhoid fever are:\n\nthe Indian subcontinent\n\nAfrica\n\nsouth and southeast Asia\n\nSouth America\n\nIt’s important to get vaccinated against typhoid fever if you’re travelling to a high risk area because some strains of the typhoid bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics.\n\nVaccination is particularly important if you're planning to live or work closely with local people.\n\nBut as neither vaccine offers 100% protection, it's also important to follow some precautions when travelling. For example, you should only drink bottled or boiled water, and you should avoid foods that could potentially be contaminated.\n\nRead more about the typhoid fever vaccination."
