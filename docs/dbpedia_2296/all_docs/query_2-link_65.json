        "text": "CHAPTER VII\n\nThe Typhus Fevers\n\nChris J. D. Zarafonetis, M.D.\n\nPart I. Epidemic Typhus\n\nEpidemic typhus fever is an acute febrile disease caused byinfection with Rickettsia prowazeki. It is a louseborne infection and ischaracterized clinically by sustained high fever, headache, malaise, and lateran exanthem. It has been known under many names including exanthematous typhus,jail fever, ship fever, war fever, camp fever, Old World typhus, Fleckfieber(German), typhus exanthematiqu? (French), el tabardillo (Spanish), and hassinchifusu (Japanese).\n\nFor centuries, epidemics of typhus fever have been associatedwith war, revolution, and famine, and have indeed, in the past, been a factoraffecting the outcome of wars. The death toll exacted in some epidemics has beenestimated in millions of lives. An account of the historical role of typhusfever has been written by Zinsser,l and Strongand his associates2 have documentedthe great Serbian epidemic of 1915.\n\nClinically, no differentiation was made between typhoid feverand louse-borne typhus fever until 1837. In that year, Gerhard, in Philadelphia,noted differences between the two, and was the first to call attention to thepresence of typhus in the New World. That typhus is transmitted by Pediculushumanus var. corporis was discovered by Nicolle, Comte, and Conseilin 1909. The causative agent, R. prowazeki, was first described in 1916 by DaRocha-Lima. For many years, it was believed that there was only one form oftyphus fever, but it is now known that the epidemic louseborne form and theendemic fleaborne typhus are caused by different micro-organisms. It has beenfurther shown that epidemic typhus fever may be recrudescent in a patient yearsafter the original illness, in the disorder known as Brill's disease.\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nTyphus fever exists in many parts of the world, with important foci in theBalkans, North Africa, China, and Mexico, and it presumably occurs in Poland,the U.S.S.R., and elsewhere. Man is the reservoir of epidemic typhus (p. 201).It is transmitted from man to man by body lice which become infected by feedingupon typhus patients during the febrile period. The rickettsiae multiply in thecells lining the intestinal tract of the louse. A week\n\n1Zinsser, Hans: Rats, Lice and History. New York: Little, Brown and Co., 1934.\n\n2Strong, Richard P., Shattuck, George C., Sellards, A. W., Zinsser, Hans, and Hopkins, J. Gardner: Typhus Fever With Particular Reference to the Serbian Epidemic. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1920.\n\n144\n\nor 10 days after the vector has become infected, theparasitized cells rupture and large numbers of rickettsiae begin to appear inits feces. Lice prefer the normal temperature of the body and usually remainclose to their human host. If the temperature is raised by fever or lowered bydeath, however, they will migrate to a new host. Here, lice suck blood anddefecate as they feed, and when the site of the bite is scratched, the infectedfeces are rubbed into the skin. This appears to be the principal means by whichthe infection is passed from man to man. It is also possible to acquire it bycrushing an infected louse upon the skin, or by having dried infected feces comeinto contact with the conjunctivae or the mucous membranes of the respiratorytract. Infection with typhus rickettsiae is eventually fatal to the louse.\n\nConditions that predispose to louse infestation naturallypredispose to epidemics of typhus fever. The scene is set by crowding,inadequate housing, lack of bathing facilities, lack of fuel, and such continuedcold weather that people wear their garments for long periods of time. Oncelouse infestation is prevalent, introduction of the infection, either from apatient with typhus or from one with the recrudescent (Brill's) disease, may setoff an epidemic. The chaotic effects of war and famine, shifting populations,and the breakdown of orderly processes of government contribute conditions thatfavor spread of the infection.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, it was evident thatAmerican troops would be exposed to typhus fever in most oversea theaters ofoperations. It was recognized that few physicians in the Armed Forces would havehad experience with a disease conspicuous by its absence from the continentalUnited States. Against this background, the United States of America TyphusCommission was created by the Secretary of War on 22 October 1942 in response toa staff-approved recommendation of The Surgeon General, initiated by Col. (laterBrig. Gen.) James S. Simmons, MC, and established by Executive order ofPresident Roosevelt on 24 December 1942.3 Theorder provided for a joint attack upon the problems of the disease by the Army,the Navy, and the U.S. Public Health Service. As a result of the comprehensivemandates and authorizations of this broadly conceived Executive order, and ofthe impetus given to the work by the director, field director, and members ofthe Commission, typhus investigation was intensified, leading to the developmentof specific diagnostic procedures, improved methods of treatment, thelarge-scale production of a potent vaccine, and excellent louse-controlmeasures. For detailed information regarding epidemiology and preventivemeasures, and a history of the Typhus Commission, the reader is referred to thebrilliant account by Stanhope Bayne-Jones in another volume in the history ofthe Medical Department in World War II.4\n\n3Bayne-Jones, S.: The United States of America Typhus Commission. Army M. Bull. No. 68, pp. 4-15, July 1943.\n\n4Bayne-Jones, Stanhope: Typhus Fevers. In Medical Department, United States Army. Preventive Medicine in World War II. Volume VII. Communicable Diseases: Arthropodborne Diseases Other Than Malaria. [In preparation.]\n\n145\n\nCLINICAL EXPERIENCE\n\nAlthough epidemic typhus fever posed a constant threat tosoldiers in several oversea theaters (table 13), the remarkable fact remains,however, that there were only 104 cases in U.S. forces and not a single death(table 14). Bayne-Jones has described the extraordinarily effective measuresthat were implemented for the protection of U.S. troops in areas where epidemicsof louseborne typhus were prevalent among civilian populations. As one result ofthis splendid record, there was no opportunity for medical officers in variousstation and general hospitals to accumulate extensive experience with epidemictyphus in our troops. The clinical studies to be recorded here are, therefore,largely those performed by members of the Typhus Commission, and are generallyconcerned with the disease as observed in civilian populations. This is incontrast to the observations on scrub typhus in the several excellent studiesmade by other medical officers and units in addition to the contributions of theU.S.A. Typhus Commission (pp. 116-138).\n\nTABLE 13.-Epidemic typhus in French North Africa, Egypt, and Iran, 1930-44\n\nYear\n\nNumber of reported cases\n\nFrench North Africa\n\nEgypt\n\nIran1\n\n1930\n\n529\n\n288\n\n(2)\n\n1931\n\n930\n\n265\n\n1,167\n\n1932\n\n965\n\n2,298\n\n1,544\n\n1933\n\n1,671\n\n7,865\n\n327\n\n1934\n\n1,456\n\n7,536\n\n1,212\n\n1935\n\n1,977\n\n3,151\n\n619\n\n1936\n\n2,182\n\n2,757\n\n202\n\n1937\n\n8,921\n\n2,083\n\n116\n\n1938\n\n11,377\n\n2,867\n\n16\n\n1939\n\n9,353\n\n4,239\n\n86\n\n1940\n\n3,547\n\n4,135\n\n397\n\n1941\n\n21,726\n\n9,324\n\n245\n\n1942\n\n77,335\n\n23,941\n\n1,102\n\n1943\n\n27,340\n\n40,084\n\n12,885\n\n1944\n\n6,226\n\n18,533\n\n6,436\n\n1Data pertain to cities only.\n\n2Data are not available.\n\nSource: (1) Stowman, K.: Typhus During the War.

During the 1943 and 1944 seasons, 159 patients with typhus feverwere admitted to this ward, and numerous other cases were observed in otherwards of the hospital. With three exceptions, all of the patients studied on theCommission ward were males. Their ages ranged from 10 to 70 years, the greatmajority falling in the 21- to 35-year age group. In general, the patients wereselected as early in the disease as possible. The majority were admitted betweenthe 5th and 10th day of illness. A few were admitted on the first day ofdisease, while in four instances, patients were actually under observationbefore the onset of illness.\n\nTABLE 14.-Incidenceof epidemic typhus fever (louseborne) in the U.S. Army, by area and year, 1942-45\n\n[Preliminary data based on sample tabulationsof individual medical records]\n\n[Rate expressed as number of cases per annum per 1,000 average strength]\n\nArea\n\n1942-45\n\n1942\n\n1943\n\n1944\n\n1945\n\nNumber of cases\n\nRate\n\nNumber of cases\n\nRate\n\nNumber of cases\n\nRate\n\nNumber of cases\n\nRate\n\nNumber of cases\n\nRate\n\nContinental United States\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\nOverseas:\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nEurope\n\n10\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n---\n\n0.00\n\n10\n\n0.00\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nMediterranean1\n\n16\n\n.01\n\n1\n\n.04\n\n12\n\n.03\n\n3\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nMiddle East\n\n14\n\n.10\n\n1\n\n.17\n\n8\n\n.15\n\n---\n\n0\n\n6\n\n.12\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nChina-Burma-India\n\n63\n\n.14\n\n1\n\n.11\n\n25\n\n.63\n\n12\n\n.07\n\n25\n\n.11\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nSouthwest Pacific\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nCentral and South Pacific\n\n1\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nNorth America2\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\nÂ Â Â Â\n\nLatin America\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\n---\n\n0\n\nTotal overseas\n\n104\n\n0.01\n\n3\n\n0.01\n\n46\n\n0.03\n\n15\n\n0.00\n\n40\n\n0.01\n\nTotal Army\n\n104\n\n0.00\n\n3\n\n0.00\n\n46\n\n0.01\n\n15\n\n0.00\n\n40\n\n0.01\n\n1Includes North Africa.\n\n2Includes Alaska and Iceland.\n\nThis section of the chapter will be restricted to aconsideration of the unvaccinated subjects who received no special therapybeyond supportive measures. There were 64 such \"untreated\" casesstudied on the Commission ward. The severity of the clinical course of thedisease was estimated for each patient after discharge from the hospital. Theprincipal factors which influenced the estimation of severity were the intensityof subjective symptoms (headache, generalized bodily aches and pains, tinnitus,deafness), the degree of prostration, the extent of neurological involvement(mental dullness, stupor, coma, incontinence of urine and feces, signs referableto the central nervous system), the severity of cardiovascular involvement (hypotension,tachycardia, peripheral vascular failure, myocardial damage), and, finally,occurrence of urinary retention, oliguria, nitrogen retention, bronchopneu-\n\n147\n\nmonia, otitis media, parotitis, furunculosis, and gangrene.6On the basis of these criteria, these cases were grouped as follows:\n\nB. Cases with minimal signs and symptoms, yet definitely diagnosed as typhuson clinical evidence.\n\nC. Cases of moderate severity, showing slight prostration, involvement of thecentral nervous system, cardiovascular changes, or mild complications.\n\nD. Severe typhus cases with pronounced prostration, involvement of thecentral nervous system, cardiovascular changes, or serious complications.\n\nE. Cases of such severe illness that at some point in the clinical course afatal outcome was expected.\n\nF. Fatal cases.\n\nOf the 64 cases of \"untreated\" typhus fever, therewere 2 in the B group, 14 in C, 26 in D, 7 in E, and 15 in F, the fatal cases, amortality of 23 percent. It was of particular interest that 33 (52 percent) ofthe patients developed nitrogen retention (nonprotein nitrogen over 45 mg.percent) during the disease.Â All 15 fatal cases were in this group, and nopatient died who throughout his illness had normal concentration of nonproteinnitrogen in the blood.\n\nThe following case histories, taken from a Commission publication,7will serve to illustrate typhus fever classified as severe (E or F):\n\nCase 1 (classified as E; severe, withneurological involvement)-The patient, male,aged 25, was admitted on the sixth day of disease with headache as his chiefcomplaint. Temperature 40.7? C. p.r. Pulse 108. Respirations 36. Blood pressure126 mm. Hg systolic and 66 mm. diastolic. Weight 121 pounds. The patient wasmoderately well developed and nourished. He appeared mentally clear and notacutely ill. There was no tinnitus or deafness. The skin was dark; no evidenceof a typhus rash was seen. The conjunctivae were negative. The tongue was whitecoated and moist. The chest was clear to percussion and auscultation.Examination of the heart showed nothing remarkable.\n\nLaboratory data on admission-Hemoglobin83 percent (CuSO4); erythrocytes 4,500,000; leukocytes 7,550, with 81percent polymorphonuclear cells. Urine was amber in color, cloudy, reactionacid, and specific gravity 1.028. A few squamous epithelial cells, 1-2 granularcasts per low-power field, 1-3 leukocytes per high-power field were seen in thecentrifugated sediment. The concentration of nonprotein nitrogen was 46 mg. per100 cc. of blood. The plasma proteins were 6.8 gm. per 100 cc.\n\nHospital course (chart 4).-Throughoutthe first week of hospitalization the patient's fever remained high and the rashappeared, with intense conjunctival injection and the development of petechiaein the left conjunctival sac. The patient, actively delirious, became verytalkative and attempted to get out of bed. Intake by mouth continuedsatisfactorily until the 12th day of disease when subcutaneous injections of 5percent dextrose in saline and normal saline became necessary for the next 12days.\n\nOn the 13th day he became more stuporous andthen semicomatose. He lay with half-opened eyes, breathing quietly. Facialgrimaces and grinding of the teeth were noted. Fluid intake by mouth practicallyceased. He was put on constant bladder drainage on this day because of urinaryretention. His condition remained much the same to the\n\n6Yeomans, A., Snyder, J. C., Murray, E. S., Zarafonetis, C. J.

The rash gradually faded out during thisperiod and the conjunctival suffusion disappeared.\n\nOn the 17th day slight improvement was noted in his mentalstate. He stared about the ward, his mouth open in a wide grimace. When spokento he replied in a series of unintelligible whining sounds. There was noindication that he recognized people. The rash was no longer visible.\n\nIn the next 2 days he was able to obey simple commands. It wasevident that he was almost totally deaf. On the 20th day his temperature reachednormal levels. Examination showed hyperactive knee jerks and ankle jerks butnormal plantar response. An area of skin necrosis appeared over the coccyx.\n\nOn the 22d day the catheter was removed. When he was spoken toit was obvious that he was attempting to reply, but he could not articulate andthe facial expressions were similar to those of a crying baby.\n\nThe area of necrosis over the lower back continued to enlarge.The patient was placed in a chair on the 24th day. A low-grade fever continued.He was by that time able to eat solid food and the oral fluid intake graduallyincreased.\n\nOn the 27th day the patient was found to have not onlyhyperactive knee and ankle jerks but a bilateral positive Babinski reaction.Voluntary motion of the extremities was uncoordinated.\n\nFrom this time onward improvement in his general condition wassteady but slow. The ability to stand and walk unassisted returned before theability to form words. At the time of discharge 68 days after the onset of thedisease, the lesion over the coccyx was healed. Speech was slow, expressionless,and labored. Hyperactive reflexes were still present in the lower extremities,but the positive Babinski phenomenon had disappeared.\n\nOn followup examinations during the next 4 months the patientshowed progressive improvement. Mentally he appeared alert. There was noresidual deafness. The reflexes in the lower extremities remained hyperactive,however, and speech was still slow, labored, and monotonous in tone. Examinationof the urine showed normal concentrating power, no albumin, and a negative urinesediment. The anemia that had developed during the disease was no longerpresent.\n\nCase 2 (classified as F; fatal, with postmortem)-The patient, male, aged 30,was admitted on the fourth day of disease complaining chiefly of headache.Temperature 40.0? C. p.r. Pulse 88. Respirations 36. Blood pressure 118 mm. Hgsystolic and 64 mm. diastolic. Weight 116 pounds. The patient appearedmoderately ill, mentally clear, with rapid respirations, and no cough. A fewpoorly defined maculopapular lesions were noted over the chest, abdomen, andarms. The conjunctivae appeared moderately injected. The tongue was moist. A fewcrepitant rales were heard in the right midlung field posteriorly. Examinationof the heart showed nothing remarkable. The spleen was enlarged, but not tender;its tip was felt 7 cm. below the costal margin. The liver was not palpable, butwas found enlarged 3 cm. below the costal margin by percussion.\n\nLaboratory data on admission-Hemoglobin72 percent (CuSO4); red cells 4,110,000; white cells 4,300, with 76percent polymorphonuclear cells. Urine was amber in color, reaction acid,specific gravity 1.023, albumin 2+, 8-10 white cells per high-powerfield, and an occasional granular cast was seen in the centrifugated sediment.The concentration of nonprotein nitrogen was 30 mg. per 100 cc. of blood. Theplasma proteins were 6.5 gm. per 100 cc.\n\nHospital course (chart5).-In spite of frequent sponging, the patient continued to runa high fever from the fourth to the ninth day of disease. On the fifth day, themaculopapular rash increased, but the macules were still scanty and poorlydefined. On the sixth day, the patient became disoriented. On the eighth day hewas quite drowsy and vomited twice. His general condition, however, appearedsatisfactory. On the ninth day he became semicomatose. The pulse rate hadincreased to between 130-140 beats per\n\n150\n\nCHART 5.-Clinical and laboratory findings in a fatal caseof epidemic typhus fever\n\nminute. The blood pressure fell. The respirations were rapid. The neck wasresistant to passive flexion. Examination of the heart and lungs was negative.Spinal puncture revealed an initial pressure of 90 mm., and the dynamics werenormal. Seven cubic centimeters of spinal fluid was withdrawn. The finalpressure was 60 mm. The cell count of the spinal fluid was 5 per cu. mm. The Pandy test was negative. An electrocardiogram showed lowvoltage of the QRS complexes. The patient was given 1,000 cc. of 5 percentdextrose in saline subcutaneously.\n\nOn the morning of the 10th day, his general condition had become critical.There was oliguria; the blood pressure was low; the heart rate still rapid. Hewas given 100 cc. of concentrated human albumin intravenously. Subcutaneousinjections of 0.5 gm. of caffeine with sodium benzoate were given every 2 hours.Slight improvement in his general condition was noted throughout the day, with adecrease in heart rate and a rise in blood pressure. The state of oliguriacontinued, however. There was no increase in the rash from the fifth day.\n\nOn the morning of the 11th day the patient had a generalized convulsiveseizure and died.\n\nAt post mortem examination 1 hour after death, the interesting findings wereas follows: The rash, which had been scanty throughout his illness, was notdiscernible. No gross areas of pneumonitis were noted in the right lung; theleft lung was crepitant throughout; the bronchi appeared normal. The heartweighed 330 gm.; no gross abnormalities were seen on the epicardial orendocardial surfaces; the ventricular walls were\n\n151\n\nof normal thickness; the coronary arteries were patent. Theliver weighed 2,430 gm.; its was grayish in color, firm and rubbery inconsistency; the surface was lobulated, with numerous white fibrotic areas inthe depressions between the lobules. On section the cut surface was gray. Areasof dense fibrosis were present throughout the organ. Numerous adult schistosomeswere obtained from the blood in the portal vein. The spleen weighed 770 gm.; thesurface was mottled with numerous white, bluish, and reddish areas, some ofwhich were firm in consistency. On section the pulp was firm and deep red incolor. The surface patches extended a few millimeters into the spleen substanceand appeared to be demarcated by a narrow zone of hemorrhage.\n\nThe right kidney weighed 210 gm.; there were a few pinpoint hemorrhagicspots on its surface. On section the cortex appeared to be slightly pale. Thekidney pelvis appeared normal. The left kidney weighed 190 gm., with findingssimilar to those seen in the right kidney. The ureters appeared normal andpatent. The mucosa of the bladder was of light yellowish tint and was thickened.Small areas of hemorrhage were present in the region of the trigone.\n\nThe mucosa of the large intestine and rectum showed mottled areas of bluishand brownish discoloration. There were numerous elevated nodules of 0.5 to 0.7cm. in diameter with smooth surfaces. These were not pedunculated andwere pale green to blue black in color. The findings in the liver, bladder, andlarge bowel were secondary to an extensive Schistosoma infection.\n\nPathological physiology-The observation that there was ahigh incidence of nitrogen retention in their typhus cases led Yeomans and hisassociates to analyze the factors that might contribute to its development. Theyreasoned that-\n\n* * * a fundamental consideration * * * [is] that the caloric and proteinintake of nearly all typhus patients is grossly insufficient. There is goodreason to believe that the destruction of the body tissues must be considerable* * *. In order to prevent the accumulation of nitrogenous metabolites in theblood, the excretion of an adequate [amount] of urine * * * is necessary. In thepresence of a greatly increased protein catabolism it is apparent thatdehydration with a diminished output of urine will have considerable effect uponthe degree of azotemia observed.\n\nAnother factor * * * in the more critically ill patients * * * is the onsetof renal insufficiency, most often associated with a rapid fall in bloodpressure. [This] * * * is of serious prognostic import. In our experience * * *the majority of these patients died with evidences of overwhelming rickettsialinfection or complicating conditions, such as pneumonia, [but] a rapiddiminution in kidney function was almost without exception the first indicationthat the patient would probably succumb to the disease. The * * * renalinsufficiency itself was of more significance than a fall in blood pressure,since at times such a fall was not observed or occurred in the absence of renalfailure. At present we have no evidence to indicate that the loss of renalfunction observed in these critically ill patients was due to other thanextrarenal factors.\n\nIn French Morocco, Maj. Theodore E. Woodward, MC, of the U.S.A. TyphusCommission collaborated with Maj. (later Lt. Col.) Edward F. Bland, MC, 6thGeneral Hospital, in a study of 30 native patients with typhus fever.8 Theydraw a composite picture of the pathological physiology of severe typhus asfollows:\n\nThe patient is acutely ill and very toxic, with a significantly low arterialtension and a labile pulse. Usually, unless actively supported, the patientbecomes dehydrated, the\n\n8Woodward, T. E., and Bland, E. F.: Clinical Observations in Typhus Fever,With Special Reference to the Cardiovascular System. J.A.M.A. 126: 287-293, 30Sept. 1944.\n\n152\n\nred cells decrease and plasma proteins fall with aconsiderable loss of the albumin fraction, indicating a reduced colloidalosmotic pressure. All factors indicate a drop of blood volume with the patternof hypoproteinemia, hypochloremia, and hemodilution without blood destruction.The unstable circulation results in lowered glomerular filtration pressure, andhence oliguria and anuria occur. The kidney, partially damaged by the specificpathologic condition and called on to eliminate an increased amount ofnitrogenous waste, is unable to function normally unless adequately supported byfluids. Lowered blood volume means less adequate filling of the heart duringdiastole and hence lowered cardiac output. Each beat of the heart is lessefficient. The use of cardiac stimulants under these conditions is ineffectual,but when the volume of the blood is restored the organ can operate moreefficiently.\n\nWoodward and Bland note that the typhus lesion had been demonstrated byWolback and his associates in heart muscle, in the kidney, and in almost everyother organ. However, the degree of both cardiac and renal changes they observedwas not disproportionate to the pathological changes occurring elsewhere, andfrom their clinical studies it appears \"unlikely that cardiac failure assuch is often a significant factor in the outcome of the fatal case.\" Intreatment, they advocate \"general supportive measures to increase thecirculating blood volume.\"\n\nMetabolic studies-These observations focused attention on the azotemiaand hypochloremia associated with a high proportion of typhus fever cases. Sincea better understanding of electrolytes and protein metabolism was deemedessential for appropriate supportive treatment, Tierney and Yeomans9 undertookmetabolic studies in cases of typhus fever on the Commission ward in Cairo.\n\nTierney and Yeomans determined the carbon dioxide content andthe chlorides of the serum in 34 cases. They found the serum chlorides to be lowin 62 percent of the patients during the first 2 weeks of disease, but the serumcarbon dioxide content was appreciably reduced in only four cases. Explanationwas sought for the low serum chlorides in the early stages of typhus. The dietsof these patients were probably poor in salt prior to hospitalization, but thiswas not an important factor since there was no conspicuous chloride deficit inpatients admitted to the Commission ward with relapsing fever and typhoid fever.Perspiration was not a factor, as it was rarely observed; indeed, failure toperspire was noted in typhus patients not only in the dry climate of Egypt butalso in moist climates. The salt was not lost in the urine, for urinaryexcretion was in relation to the concentration of chlorides in the serum; whenserum chlorides fell below normal levels, the urinary chlorides diminishedmarkedly. The fact that the serum chlorides returned to normal spontaneously inspite of a poor salt intake was taken as evidence that the salt was notlost by the body and that the lowered chloride concentration was therefore dueto expansion of the extracellular fluid volume. During the early stage oftyphus, the patients frequently have nonpitting\n\n9Tierney, N. A., and Yeomans, A.: Metabolic Studies inLouse-Borne Typhus; Observations on Serum Electrolyte Pattern, Serum ProteinPartition, and Nitrogen Balance. J. Clin. Investigation 25: 822-837, November1946.\n\n153\n\nedema; in the later stage, shortly before defervescence thereis often a fairly marked diuresis. These observations are in keeping with thesuggestion that early in the disease there is an increase in extracellularfluids, which would lower the serum chlorides, and later in the disease there isa loss of extracellular fluid by diuresis with a resultant increase in serumchlorides. The pH was normal in all of the patients except one who had renalfailure and acidosis. The total base was also normal in all but one of thesubjects studied. In all instances, the quantity of undetermined acid anions wasincreased in the majority of cases equaling that found in severe metabolicacidosis.\n\nThe total serum proteins were normal in approximately 75 percent of thepatients, but the majority showed a depression of the albumin fraction and avery striking elevation of the globulin fraction to over 40 percent in theaverage case. An electrophoretic analysis10 of sera obtained from aseverely ill patient on the ward of the Cairo Unit of the Typhus Commissionshowed that the relative proportion of albumin and the albumin to globulin ratiowas markedly reduced on the fourth day of fever and through convalescence. Thealpha and beta globulins were practically unaffected, but the gamma globulin wasstrikingly increased on the fourth day and was even higher in convalescence.\n\nNitrogen balance studies were performed on 21 subjects. Eight of the patientswere given high-protein, high-caloric diets; ten, low-protein, low-caloric diets;and three were given a combination of these. It was found that there was norelationship between nitrogen output and intake or between protein destructionand azotemia. A high-protein, high-caloric diet decreased nitrogen wastage andloss of body weight during the acute phase of typhus. Indeed, positive nitrogenbalance was achieved in five of the patients studied.\n\nDietary management-From these and other observations on the Commissionward, the following recommendations were made with regard to management of diet,electrolytes, and fluids in the typhus patient:\n\n1. A liquid diet high in protein and calories should be given. With diligentnursing, the average patient will ingest at least 90 gm. of protein and 2,500calories a day. If the patient is too ill to take the diet, Amigen may be givenintravenously.\n\n2. The routine administration of large amounts of sodium chloride withoutdetermining the serum chlorides should be avoided. By including in the diet orin the parenteral fluids 4 to 6 gm. of sodium chloride a day, the serumchlorides should be kept within normal limits and good state of hydrationachieved. Usually, the fluid intake should be maintained between 3 and 4 litersdaily.\n\n3. The urine output should be at least 1 liter a day, and preferably 1.5liters. As a marked drop in the urine output is an ominous sign, particularly\n\n10Dole, V. P., Yeomans, A., and Tierney, N. A.: Electrophoretic Changes inthe Serum Protein Pattern of a Patient With Typhus Fever. J. Clin. Investigation26: 298-300, March 1947.\n\n154\n\nif associated with a fall in the arterial blood pressure, plasma or bloodtransfusions in such cases are urgently required.\n\n4. In cases of shock or impending shock, plasma or bloodtransfusions are indicated. The effect of plasma or blood transfusions onhypoalbuminemia is transient. In order to produce any significant change, verylarge amounts of plasma over a period of days would be required.\n\n5. Acid salts, such as ammonium chloride, are obviously contraindicatedbecause of the increase in undetermined acids in the blood.\n\nEpidemic in Italy-The clinical observations that havebeen described were carried out under relatively ideal conditions. However,members of the Typhus Commission and other physicians of the U.S. Army Medical Service saw thousands of additional cases under epidemic, andoften chaotic, conditions throughout Europe and the Far East. In a fewinstances, efforts were made to glean clinical data even under the most adverseof circumstances. These reports will be mentioned briefly.\n\nThe epidemic at Naples, Italy, during 1943 and 1944 involvedsome 1,407 cases within the city itself and 492 cases outside Naples. Vigorousapplication of delousing measures quickly brought this epidemic under control.This historic accomplishment has been detailed by Bayne-Jones.11 Here, itwill suffice to note that the case fatality rate was about 22.6 percent.Woodward,12 in his report of the activities of the flying squadrongroup for typhus control outside Naples, recorded brief observations on 257cases diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, along with serological tests.Of interest was the relatively high incidence in children, many of whom showed acharacteristic rash and were moderately ill.\n\nObservations in concentration camps-Maj. William A.Davis, MC, while serving as liaison officer from the U.S.A. Typhus Commission tothe 21st Army Group, recorded the typhus fever epidemic that occurred at theBelsen Concentration Camp, Belsen, Germany.13 This camp was taken by theBritish Second Army on 15 April 1945. Among the 61,000 inhabitants, there waswidespread suffering from starvation, typhus, dysentery, tuberculosis, and otherdiseases. Typhus had been prevalent in the camp for 4 months, and there wereapproximately 3,500 cases at the time of liberation. Practically all of theinternees were heavily infested with lice.\n\nDavis stated that the appraisal and diagnosis of cases was peculiarlydifficult in this group. Prostration, semistupor, dehydration, loss of weight,weakness, tremors, and a petechial rash, which are considered characteristic oftyphus, were so common in the starving, louse-infected people that he\n\n11Bayne-Jones, Stanhope: Epidemic Typhus in theMediterranean Area During World II.

The rash was mild; very few had ecchymoses, and the usual finding was a scattered petechialexanthem best seenafter the patient had been washed. Gangrene was common, particularly drygangrene of the toes. Pleuritic pain was a frequent complaint in the post-typhusperiod. About 30 cases of parotitis were observed that required incision.Several patients had polyneuritic leg pains, which may have reflected vitamin Bdeficiency exacerbated by the increased metabolic demands of fever. Nostatistics were available on the death rate from typhus fever at Belsen.\n\nEpidemic typhus fever was also prevalent at the Dachau Concentration Camp,Dachau, Germany, when it was liberated by the Seventh U.S. Army on 29 April1945. Measures were taken to control the disease, and special clinicalfacilities were made available to the Typhus Commission14at the 116thEvacuation Hospital. On 16 May 1945, six nurses from the 59th EvacuationHospital arrived and began their duties on the Typhus Commission Service, aspecial ward of 64 beds which admitted patients, 83 in all, until 30 May 1945.The ward was closed 9 June 1945. Most of these patients were treated with PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) or serumtherapy as discussed in the section ontreatment (p. 192). Here, the data on 121 untreated controls are of interest.These were male patients of various nationalities in the wards of the 116thEvacuation Hospital, ranging in age from 17 to 58 years, with an average age of28 years. The duration of fever averaged 16.2 days in this group.\n\nOf particular interest is the observation that the typhus fever encounteredat Dachau was clinically a mild disease. Fewer patients were seen withfull-blown rashes than in other epidemics. There appeared to be less prostrationand delirium, and a shorter convalescence. To be sure, there were some severecases, but not so many as had been expected. The comparative mildness of thedisease was surprising to Commission observers who had seen patients in Cairo,Naples, and elsewhere, and had anticipated that the general debility of theDachau patients would predispose them to a considerable mortality. The fatalityrate from typhus for all Dachau hospitals during 9 May to 9 June 1945, was,however, 9.1 percent.\n\nAdditional serious outbreaks of typhus fever were encounteredamong civilian populations in other areas of the European Theater of Operations,U.S. Army,15 and in Japan and Korea,16 butcircumstances prevented the undertaking of special clinical studies during theseepidemics.\n\n14A Report on the Activities of the U.S.A.

One of the most important was the compulsory immunization of all soldiers going to areas where epidemic typhus was present or suspected. Accordingly, those few cases that did occur in troops, along with those encountered in certain special studies, offer an unusual opportunity to analyze the modifications of clinical course resulting from vaccination. The value of serological tests in the diagnosis of typhus in vaccinated individuals is implicit in the clinical material to be summarized, although particular consideration of these tests will be left for the section on laboratory methods (p. 179).\n\nThe Cox (U.S. Army) vaccine-Earlywork by Da Rocha-Lima(1918) and Weigl (1920) suggested that killed suspensions of typhus-infectedlice or infected louse feces could endow some immunity as vaccines. However,these and other methods advanced for vaccine preparation up to 1938 were notpractical for large-scale production. It was a highly significant discovery,therefore, when Cox17 demonstrated in 1938 that rickettsiae could begrown in the yolk sac of the developing chick embryo. Cox and Bell18 soonprepared an epidemic typhus vaccine which consisted of a killed suspension ofmicro-organisms grown in yolk sacs and purified by centrifugation. Subsequentmodifications included an ether-extraction technique devised by Craigie19 andthe incorporation of soluble antigen in the vaccine.20 The resultantproduct was not only satisfactory from the standpoint of potency but was alsofeasible for commercial production. The final product used by the U.S. Armyconsisted of a 10-percent yolk-sac suspension of the Breinl strain of R.prowazeki, extracted with ether; it contained both killed microorganisms andsoluble substances. Up through 1943, the initial vaccination for U.S. Armypersonnel consisted of three injections of the vaccine, 1.0 cc. each,administered subcutaneously at intervals of 7 to 10 days, with stimulating dosesgiven every 6 months in endemic areas. As the vaccine was improved in potencythrough improvement in production, the initial immunization series was reducedin mid-1944 to two doses of vaccine, with\n\n17Cox, H.

Thisstudy was continued through the epidemics of 1943 and 1944. The subjects wereemployees of the Cairo Fever Hospital at Abassia and the Embaba Hospital.Because of the exceptionally large numbers of patients with typhus beingadmitted to these hospitals, the hospital staff was unusually exposed to theinfection, and in addition many of the employees lived in areas of the citywhere attack rates were high. Before 1943, these workers had not been vaccinatedagainst typhus. During 1943 and 1944, vaccine of the Cox type was, accordingly,administered to all employees who desired it. Careful records were kept on morethan 800 employees at Abassia and over 500 at Embaba. Most of those whocontracted febrile illnesses, whether vaccinated or not, were seen by one ormore of the Commission members. During the course of these two typhus seasons, agroup of 61 postvaccination cases were observed.\n\nDespite the mild course that distinguished many of thesecases, Ecke and his associates23 usually found it possible to recognize thedisease on clinical grounds alone, and laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosisin almost every case. In some patients, however, the diagnosis of typhus wasmade only by a rise in titer in the Weil-Felix and complement fixation testsduring illness or in early convalescence. The diagnostic significance of theselaboratory aids had been worked out by Zarafonetis in studies of 100 knownfebrile illnesses other than typhus and 16 definite cases of postvaccinationtyphus. In brief, he found that, on the one hand, nontyphus febrile illnesses donot evoke high complement fixation titers in the sera of patients who have hadmultiple doses of vaccine of the Cox type. On the other hand, typhus infectionsregularly do stimulate high complement fixation titers in the sera of vaccinatedpatients. Similar results were usually obtained with the Weil-Felix test. Sointerpreted, these laboratory aids could be relied upon in those cases where theclinical evidence alone was inadequate for diagnosis, either because ofinconspicuous symptoms or insufficient observation (p. 179).\n\n21Sadusk, J.

Male, aged 45 years. This patient had a severe chill the firstday combined with frontal headache and, later, joint pains. Rash was moderate.His mild course was marked latterly by the development of bilateral costovertebral painand microscopic hematuria. After12 days of moderate elevation of temperature he continued to maintain alow-grade fever until the 21st day. (The importance of his hematuria in relationto typhus is not clear: Bilharzia infection is widespread in Egypt.)Clinical classification of severity: B.\n\nCase 2-Five doses of vaccine, the last dose 117 days before onset. Male,aged 26 years, Typhus Commission field worker. He had rather severe headache andmalaise. The rash was fleeting but definite. With the history and the rash nodifficulty was experienced in making the diagnosis, though the course was mild.Fever lasted 9 days. Clinical classification of severity: B.\n\nCase 3-Three doses of vaccine, the last dose 87 daysbefore onset. The patient, male, aged 45 years, appeared to be at least 55. Hewas never especially ill during his course. He developed a tremor of his limbs,almost parkinsonian in character. This disappeared during convalescence. Feverlasted 12 days. Clinical classification of severity: B.\n\nCase 4-Three doses of vaccine, the last dose 103 days before onset.Male, aged 18 years. This case was a problem in diagnosis. Moderately ill; saidhe felt \"weak,\" but had no specific complaint. There was nothing tobe found but a very few fleeting macules requiring careful search. There was noconjunctival injection. Fever lasted 10 days. Clinical classification ofseverity: B.\n\nCase 5-Five doses of vaccine, the last dose 79 days before onset. Anobese male, aged 33 years. He complained of generalized body pains, especiallyin the knees, and said he felt \"feverish.\" He had severe headache.There was some tinnitus and slight deafness. His course was mild. Fever lasted 8days. Clinical classification of severity: B.\n\nThe average duration of fever for all the patients in group 1 was 10? days.The cases were classed as follows: 1 in A, 20 in B, 5 in C, none in D, E, or F.Fifteen of the patients were females, average age 22.7 years; 11 patients weremales, average age 31.8 years.\n\nGroup 2 (two doses of vaccine at least 21 days prior to onset).-The sevenpatients in group 2 had an average duration of fever of 12 days. The cases wereclassed as follows: 4 in B, 3 in C. Four patients were females, average age 19years. Three patients were males, average age 28 years.\n\nGroup 3 (one dose of vaccine at least 21 days prior to onset).-The 11patients in group 3 had an average duration of fever of 12.7 days. The cases\n\n159\n\nwere classed as follows: 2 in B, 8 in C, and 1 in D. Five patients werefemales, average age 21 years. Six patients were males, average age 34 years.Â\n\nGroup 4 (onset of typhus less than 12 days after first dose of vaccine).-Therewere 17 patients in group 4. The average duration of fever in the nonfatal caseswas 15 days. The cases were classed as follows: 4 in B, 8 in C, 4 in D, and 1 inF. There were 12 females, average age 23.6, and 5 males, average age 27.8years.\n\nIn discussing these results, Ecke and his coworkers pointed out that, beforethe vaccination program was undertaken, typhus fever among the employees of theCairo Fever Hospital was characteristically severe. The relatively few employeeswho remained unvaccinated and contracted typhus during the study period werelikewise severely stricken. By contrast, among those who had received two ormore doses of Cox vaccine 21 days or more before the onset of illness (groups 1and 2), there were no severely ill patients, that is, D, E, or F cases, whereastwo-thirds of the unvaccinated patients in the same age groups fell into thesevere groups, D, E, or F. (Compare with the 64 nonvaccinated cases summarizedon p. 147.) On the basis of these observations, and insofar as attenuation ofclinical course is concerned, it was postulated that adequate vaccinationagainst typhus could be defined as two or more doses of Cox-type vaccine ofstandard potency administered more than 21 days before the onset of typhus.\n\nOn the basis of their observations during this study, Ecke and his coworkersrecommended that vaccination be included in epidemic control programs.\n\nSadusk24 consolidated much of the information regardingepidemic typhus fever that occurred in U.S. Army personnel subsequently toimmunization. His report contains details of five cases, three in members of theTyphus Commission. These case histories will illustrate the course of typhusfever in vaccinated Americans and, at the same time, will serve as a reminder ofthe added health hazards to which medical officers are at times exposed in lineof duty.\n\nCase 1-A 41-year-old male officer, member of the U.S.A.TyphusCommission, for almost a month before the onset of illness was engaged in typhusresearch work in Cairo, Egypt, together with the officer described in case 2.They were both daily exposed to infection with typhus by examining patients,picking infected lice off rabbits and patients, and handling and grindinginfected louse feces for injecting into experimental animals. During thepreceding 2 years, this officer had received a total of 22.0 cc. of vaccine insingle 1.0 cc. doses. Five cubic centimeters of this vaccine was of anexperimental lot and contained both epidemic and murine virus. The last dose ofvaccine was given on 1 March 1944.\n\nOn 21 May 1944, the patient had a mild headache, generalmalaise, and felt feverish. Although the headache became more severe and thetemperature ranged between 100.0? and 101.0? F. during the next 3 days, hecontinued his work. On the sixth day, 26 May,\n\n24See footnote 21, p. 157.\n\n160\n\nhe took to his bed because of headache, fatigue, andmalaise. Backache was marked. The next day he reported to a medical dispensarywhere physical examination revealed a few pink papules on the left palm andwrist, a temperature of 99.2? F., and a pulse rate of 100. The rash haddisappeared by the following morning and except for a mild headache, anorexia,and sense of fatigue, the patient did well on bed rest in his quarters,reporting daily to the dispensary. He was afebrile by 27 May (7th day) and waspermitted to remain out of bed on 31 May (11th day).\n\nPrior to the onset of typhus, on 21 March and 4 April 1944, the Weil-Felixreaction was negative with both Proteus OX-19 and OX-2 antigens and thecomplement fixation titer was 1:8 with epidemic antigen and 1:4 with murineantigen. By the end of the first week of disease the Proteus OX-19 titer roseto 1: 20, and in the second week it rose to 1: 80. It reverted to negative inthe fourth week. The complement fixation titer rose rapidly to a high of 1:1,024 in the second week. More than 2 years later, the complement fixation (withepidemic antigen) was still positive with a titer of 1: 10.\n\nCase 2-A 35-year-old male officer, member of the U.S.A.Typhus Commission, was engaged in typhus research work in Cairo with thepatient described in case 1, for a month prior to onset of illness. Althoughexposed daily, he recalled that he was dangerously exposed on 11 June 1944 whenhe assisted with the handling and grinding of infected louse feces in largeamounts. During the period from 23 December 1941 to 10 October 1943, he receiveda total of 12.0 cc. of typhus vaccine in 1.0 cc. increments. On 22 November 1943he received 1.0 cc. epidemic typhus vaccine and on 10 April an additional andfinal dose of 1.0 cc. of vaccine. Although the Weil-Felix reaction wasnegative with both Proteus OX-19 and Proteus OX-2 antigen, the complementfixation titer with epidemic antigen was 1: 8, 3 days before and 11 days afterthe last dose of vaccine.\n\nOn 23 June 1944, the patient awakened in the morning with amild but troublesome frontal headache which persisted through most of the day,and the following day recurred together with malaise and easy fatigability. Histemperature was 101.0? F. As these symptoms persisted with an increase in bothseverity and extent of the headache, he was admitted to the hospital late in theafternoon of the next day, 25 June. The following day his temperature was100.4? F., pulse rate was 80, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure was 106systolic and 60 diastolic. Although he did not appear acutely ill, he complainedof headache, chilly sensations, and nausea. Physical examination revealed only amarked injection of the scleral conjunctivae. Later in the afternoon histemperature rose to 102.0? F. and a diffuse macular eruption appeared over theanterior chest, arms, shoulders, and flanks with an erythematous blush thatdisappeared upon pressure. He continued that afternoon and night to have slightchills. By the next morning the rash had definitely faded but his headache,which was now generalized, became exceptionally severe. Chills continued, and heappeared quite ill. There were intermittent, drenching sweats, and he complainedof severe backache and general malaise. The temperature rose to 103.2? F. thatnight with a pulse rate of only 90. The respiratory rate was normal. Althoughthe temperature fell to 99.2? F. the following morning (28 June) and remainedbelow 100.6? F. throughout the course of the day, severe headache, malaise,sweating, and occasional chills persisted. He vomited several times and on oneoccasion there was a transient amnesia. During the course of the next 2 days,these symptoms persisted but the temperature remained relatively low and therash became increasingly less evident, and disappeared completely by 1 July. On29 June the physician reported that the patient appeared to be disoriented for abrief period but this was not confirmed and was later denied by the patient.From 30 June on, there was rapid and progressive improvement, as illustrated inchart 6, with rapid fall in temperature by lysis, subsidence of headache,malaise, nausea, and vomiting, and rapid increase in serological titers fortyphus fever. On 30 June, there was a left earache which disappeared within 48hours without specific\n\n161\n\nCHART 6.-Clinical course and early serologicalfindings in a moderately severe case of epidemic typhus in a vaccinatedindividual\n\ntherapy. Temperature was normal by 3 July. On 5 July he was permitted out ofbed and was discharged on the following day as an ambulatory patient.\n\nDuring the course of the patient's stay in the hospital,there was no marked hypotension. On 25 June, the day of admission, the red cellcount was 4,600,000, the hemoglobin was 95 percent, and the leukocyte count wassaid to be 6,300 with 45 percent stab cells, 33 percent polymorphonuclearneutrophils, 20 percent lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes. On 3 July theblood count was as follows: red cells 4,650,000, hemoglobin 95 percent,leukocytes 5,600 with 15 percent stab cells, 53 percent polymorphonuclearneutrophils, 18 percent lymphocytes, and 14 percent monocytes. Urine examinationon 26 June was negative. It was clear amber and specific gravity was 1.010.Tests for albumin and sugar were negative.\n\nSerological tests were performed daily during the acute phaseof the disease. The Weil-Felix reaction with Proteus OX-19 antigenremained negative until the eighth day when it became positive in a titer of 1:20. It then rose rapidly reaching a top figure of 1:1,280 on the 19th day. Itwas still positive at 1:80 on the 124th day but when next checked, almost 2years after the onset of the disease, it was found to be negative. Complementfixing antibodies began to rise by the end of the first week of disease,reaching a peak with epidemic antigen of 1: 512 by the 19th day. Thetiter began to fall after the\n\n162\n\n31st day and when last checked almost 2 years later, the titer was stillpositive at 1: 20. Specific rickettsial agglutinations were negative at thattime. The temperature and pulse record, along with other pertinent findingsduring the acute phase of this patient's disease, are shown in chart 6.\n\nCase 3-A 36-year-old male officer, memberof the U.S.A.Typhus Commission, was engaged in typhus control work in Hokkaido, Japan. On10 November 1945, he was heavily exposed in the room of a Japanese hospital todust containing suspended louse feces from the clothing of a patient with activetyphus. From 17 February to 28 July 1944 he had received a total of 4.0 cc. oftyphus vaccine in 1.0 cc. doses. On 9 May and 1 October 1945, he receivedadditional 1.0 cc. doses of the vaccine. On 6 June and 4 August 1945, serology was as follows: Weil-Felix negative,complement fixation 1: 10 with epidemic antigen and negative with murineantigen, and rickettsial agglutination 1: 40 with epidemic antigen and negativewith murine antigen.\n\nOn 22 November 1945, the patient experienced chilly sensations andgeneralized malaise. The following day headache, apathy, anorexia, andirritability appeared. These persisted during the next 2 days with chilliness,and although he felt feverish he did not take his temperature. On the fifth day,his temperature was 101.8? F., pulse rate was 88, and respiratory rate was 20.Headache became more severe and was predominately bitemporal. A persistent dryhacking cough set in and he vomited once. The next day, sixth day of disease, herefused hospital admission but finally took to bed in his quarters. Headachebecame excruciating in severity, temperature rose to 102.2? F., and nausea andcough persisted. Although the temperature rose to 103.8? F. the night of theseventh day and he became drowsy, there was suddenly a feeling of relative wellbeing the following day with sudden resolution of fever by crisis and profusesweats. He was afebrile by the 9th day, and was out of bed on the 10th day, andback to work on the 13th day, although he tired easily on exertion. The bloodpressure remained normal throughout and there was no rash. The lungs were clear.\n\nThe leukocyte count on the seventh day was 5,000. On the 13th day completeblood count at an outpatient clinic showed 4,620,000 red cells, 90 percenthemoglobin, and 6,600 leukocytes with a differential of 64 percent segmentedneutrophils, and 36 percent lymphocytes. On the 12th day, urine was negativeexcept for a faint trace of albumin with a few leukocytes in the microscopicexamination. These findings had disappeared by the following day. On the 21stday, electrocardiographic tracing was normal in all four leads. The heart ratewas 84, the PR interval was 0.16 second, sinus rhythm was present, QRS complexeswere 0.06 second, T waves were upright in all leads, and there were no STchanges.\n\nThe serological changes are given in detail in table 15.Briefly, Weil-Felix reaction became positive on the 7th day with a titer of 1:40 and reached as high as 1: 80 by the 14th day. The complement fixation withepidemic antigen began to rise by the end of the first week, reached its peak at1: 1,280 at the end of the third week, and was still positive by the ninthmonth. Rickettsial agglutination did not rise until the second week but reachedits peak at that time with a titer of 1: 640 with epidemic antigen. It was stillpositive by the ninth month.\n\nThe pertinent serological data on the three cases just mentioned are given intable 15, and the essential clinical features of these and two other vaccinatedcases are summarized in table 16. Of particular interest is the method ofinfection. In each instance, there was evidence to indicate inhalation orconjunctival absorption of infected louse feces.\n\n163\n\nTABLE 15.-Serologicalfindings and immunization record in three cases of epidemic typhus feverincurred subsequent to immunization with typhus fever vaccine\n\n164\n\nTABLE 16.-Clinicalsummary of five cases of epidemic typhus fever incurred subsequent toimmunization with typhus fever vaccine\n\n165\n\nSadusk's report was in keeping with other observations thatthe clinical course of epidemic typhus is greatly modified when infection occurssubsequently to vaccination (chart 7). Fever is much lower and of shorterduration than in nonvaccinated cases, the extent and duration of rash arediminished, circulatory and nervous symptoms are lessened, and the incidence ofcomplications is minimal. If hospitalization is necessary, the length of it isreduced. The only symptom that is regularly present in vaccinated cases issevere headache.\n\nCHART 7.-Clinicalcomparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated groups of typhus fever cases amongemployees of the Cairo Fever Hospital, El Abbasa, Egypt\n\nFollowing is the only case known to have occurred in our troops in Sicily.25The patient, a private with the 77th Field Artillery, was admitted to the 59thEvacuation Hospital, Palermo, Sicily, in the summer of 1943.

Reilly, MC,Chief of Medical Service, as follows:\n\nA private claimed he was immunized against typhusin June 1941, and a recall dose was given in June 1943. No record wasobtainable.

He does notknow of having been bitten by ticks, lice, or fleas.\n\nHe was taken ill on 23 August with headache, injected eyes,and fever. Fever disappeared by lysis on 2 September (chart 8). On the third dayof disease, 26 August, a maculopapular rash appeared on the trunk, thighs, andarms, gradually increasing in amount, intensity and distribution for the next 5days and being heaviest on the limbs (fig. 11). In spots it was petechial andhemorrhagic and did not fade on pressure. No tache noir or regionallymphadenitis was detected. There was a macular rash on buccal mucosa. Thepharynx was slightly reddened. Between the fourth and eighth day, the enlargedspleen was palpable. On the third and seventh day, he had 5,100 and 7,500 WBCnormally differentiated and urine specimens were negative except for lowspecific gravity. The boy was very ill, lost weight and strength. There were afew loose bowel movements between the seventh and ninth days. A blood culture onthe fifth day was negative. Weil-Felix tests with the three Proteus typeswere entirely negative on the ninth day in an Italian laboratory. On the 11thday, the Proteus OX-19 was positive 1: 40, Proteus OX-2 waspositive 1: 160, and Proteus OX-K was negative. A third Weil-Felix test,on the 18th day of disease (10 September) showed a rising titer: OX-19 waspositive 1: 640, OX-2 was positive 1: 1,280, and OX-K was negative. A guinea piginoculated on the 11th day, when temperature was normal for the first time, didnot develop scrotal reaction. After fever subsided, the patient graduallyrecovered strength, weight, and appetite. No complications or sequelae werepresent 1 month after onset.\n\nOnly three confirmed cases of typhus occurred among U.S. troops serving inthe European theater, despite its prevalence among the civilian populations.26Two infections were contracted in the Rhineland and one in the Inner Reich. Allthree patients had mild attacks of the disease, as indicated by the followingbrief case summaries:27\n\nCase 4.-A captain of the Medical Corpsinvestigated a typhus outbreak at Fischbach, Germany, on 23 March 1945. He wasintimately exposed to the disease while examining and disinfecting patients butdoes not recall ever having found lice on his person. On 9 April, he developed amacular rash. He was never delirious, stuporous, or disoriented. Hisconvalescence was rapid and uneventful. A Weil-Felix test on 17 April waspositive in a serum dilution of 1: 640. The patient had not received astimulating dose of typhus vaccine since the original course in April 1944.\n\nCase 5-A lieutenant colonel,Medical Corps, accompanied the officer noted in case 4 (above) and both becameill on the same day. This patient's illness was even less severe, with no rashat any time. He remained on quarters status, and returned to duty 15 April. Astimulating dose of typhus vaccine had been administered on 23 March 1945, theday previous to his exposure to the disease. The stimulation antedating that wasin September 1944.\n\nCase 6-A sergeant of the15th Infantry became ill 4 April 1945 complaining of pains in the legs,headache, and fever of 102? F. He was admitted to hospital and observed forseveral days. On 22 April he was transferred to a general hospital with thediagnosis still undetermined. The patient had daily chills with fever up to 104?F. for 11 days and at one time developed a slight rash on the wrists, ankles,and abdomen. A Weil-Felix test performed 5 May was positive in dilution of 1:320. No likely source of infection could be determined and there was clinicaldifference of opinion as to the identity of the disease.\n\n26See footnote 15, p. 155.\n\n27Gordon, John E.: A History of Preventive Medicine in the European Theater of Operations, U.S. Army, 1941-45, vol.

Britishtroops, on the other hand, were inoculated with the Craigie vaccine, whichconsisted of two parts of epidemic (R. prowazeki) and one part ofmurine typhus (Rickettsia mooseri) antigens. Soluble substances as wellas killed micro-organisms were included in the Craigie vaccine. In Germany,observing the typhus epidemic at Belsen, Davis28also had an opportunity to estimate the value of this vaccine under epidemicconditions, collecting data on 14 cases of typhus in British personnel who hadbeen vaccinated more than 24 days before the onset of their fever. Theirclinical courses were milder and shorter than is seen in typical epidemic typhusin nonvaccinated persons, with no deaths and no serious complications. He notedas significant \"the absence of serious complications * * *. Parotitis,gangrene, conjunctivitis, deafness due to typhus, epistaxis, pulmonaryconsolidation, and pleuritic pains were never observed in the British, althoughall were to be seen in the typhus patients from the concentration camp. Theirrash was never extensive, rarely developed into true petechiae which would notblanche on pressure, and never formed ecchymoses. Delirium was observed in only2 cases, and in these it was brief. Roentgenograms of the chest were reported asnormal or 'marked increase in bronchovascular markings throughout bothlungs.'\" Determinations of blood nonprotein nitrogen were made on 10patients about a week after the onset of fever. Values ranged from 21 to 42 mg.percent in these cases.\n\nDavis also made observations on 16 cases of typhus in Hungarian soldiers whohad only one or two doses of Craigie vaccine after exposure to typhus at Belsenand 41 cases of typhus in well-nourished Germans who had no vaccine. From acomparison of the three groups as shown in table 17, and other data, it wasconcluded that Craigie vaccine was of definite value in shortening the courseand reducing the severity of epidemic typhus fever when given in two or moredoses from 24 to 100 days before the onset of the disease.\n\nThe course of epidemic typhus fever was thus shown to bemodified favorably by prior vaccination with vaccine of either the Cox or theCraigie type. The observations regarding the effectiveness of these twovaccines, however, were not made under controlled or even similar conditions,and it is not possible to draw conclusions as to their relative effectivenessfrom these data.\n\n28Davis, W.

Med. 34: 448-465, February 1951.\n\nPATHOLOGY\n\nTwo important studies of the pathology of epidemic typhusfever were undertaken during World War II. The first of these,29by Maj. Arthur C. Allen, MC, and Dr. Sophie Spitz, at the Army Institute ofPathology (now Armed Forces Institute of Pathology), Washington, D.C., entaileda comparison of the histological preparations and protocols of 78 cases of scrubtyphus (tsutsugamushi disease), 24 cases of epidemic (louseborne) typhus, 12cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and lung sections of 2 cases of AmericanQ fever. Since the principal emphasis of this study was placed on the changesinduced by scrub typhus, the main findings of the authors are given in thechapter dealing with that infection (p. 132). However, a number of otherobservations were made which are relevant here. The histology of the cutaneouslesion is described, as follows:\n\nThe macule of epidemic typhus histologicallywas essentially similar to that of scrub typhus, although several differenceswere found. In the first place, although capillary thrombi were present in allof the available sections of macules of scrub typhus as against only 15, or 65percent, of the macules in epidemic typhus, the thrombi were considerably moreconspicuous in the latter disease. They were more prominent not only becausemore thrombi occurred in a single section, but because they were larger and wereassociated with more pronounced endothelial changes. In epidemic typhus, theaffected endothelial cells tended to be larger, more hyperchromatic, and moreoften disintegrated into chromatin dust, the last being a feature observed alsoin the capillaries of other organs, including the glomerular capillaries.Secondly, there was a tendency to the occurrence in epidemic typhus of anecrotizing arteritis and thrombo-arteritis, not found in scrub typhus. Thenecrosis might extend through the entire wall of the artery, unlike the lesserdegree of involvement that is stated to occur in the experimental animalinfected with\n\n29Allen, A. C., and Spitz, S.: A Comparative Study of the Pathology of Scrub Typhus (Tsutsugamushi Disease) and Other Rickettsial Diseases. Am. J. Path. 21: 603-681, July 1945.\n\n170\n\nthe rickettsiae of epidemic typhus. Indeed, inthe human skin of cases of epidemic typhus there may be infarct-like hemorrhagicsuppurative necrosis of the portions of corium in association with severearteritis. Thirdly, whereas no significant changes were noted in the epidermisof the macule of scrub typhus, minor changes consisting of focal spongiosis,patchy parakeratosis and focal \"liquefaction degeneration\" of thebasal layers were infrequently observed in the skin of patients with louse-bornetyphus.\n\nThe interstitial myocarditis and interstitial pneumonitis of epidemic typhuswere intermediate in intensity between that produced by scrub typhus and byspotted fever.\n\nChanges in the adrenal glands of patients with epidemic typhus were similarto those of scrub typhus, except that there was a more conspicuous focalmononuclear reaction. In addition, a few cases of epidemic typhus exhibitedinflammatory and degenerative changes of capillaries and arterioles of bothparenchymal and adventitial tissues.\n\nSimilarly, lesions in the kidneys from patients with epidemic typhusqualitatively resembled those of scrub typhus but were considerably morepronounced. \"Acute diffuse glomerulonephritis was found in 18, or 78percent, of the cases; acute focal glomerulitis in 3, or 13 percent, andessentially normal glomeruli in 2, or 9 percent. The glomerular alterations werebasically those of scrub typhus, differing in more marked swelling andhyperchromasia of the endothelial cells, more frequent occurrence of thrombosisof the glomerular capillaries and fragmentation of the endothelial cells.Similarly, focal interstitial infiltrations, calcific bodies, hemoglobin castsof the distal convolutions, and phlebitis, arteritis, and arteriolitis were moreconspicuous in epidemic typhus.\"\n\nA comparison was made between reactions in the brain and meninges in epidemicand scrub typhus. It was found that-\n\n1. Although the meningitis of scrub typhus is slightly morefrequent and extensive than the qualitatively similar reaction in epidemictyphus, the involvement of the substance of the brain is considerably greater inthe latter disease.\n\n2. The distribution of lesions in the gray and white matter inthe two diseases is the same: in both the white matter is spared, in contrastwith Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\n\n3. In the current series the case incidence of involvement ofthe cortex in epidemic typhus is much greater than in scrub typhus. The actualconcentration of nodules in the pons, medulla, and basal ganglia in epidemictyphus is more pronounced than in the cortex. The pons and medulla are sites ofpredilection also in scrub typhus.\n\nSeveral distinct histologic differences between scrub typhusand epidemic typhus are noted:\n\n4. The nodules tend to be larger in epidemic typhus, averaging55 to 75 cells as against 15 to 40 cells, and about 120 to 180 Î¼ asagainst 60 to 120 Î¼.\n\n5. There is somewhat greater cellular pleomorphism in thenodules of epidemic typhus, especially in the larger. Karyorrhexis is common inthe cells of the nodule of epidemic typhus and rare in that of scrub typhus.\n\n6. In epidemic typhus, the capillaries of thenodules show much more obvious evidence of damage in the form of markedlyenlarged endothelial cells, karyorrhexis of endothelial cells, and thrombosis ofcapillaries. Similar changes are found in arterioles without associated nodules.\n\n171\n\nThe character of the tissue reaction in these cases, such as fibrinoiddegeneration of collagen, necrosis of lymph nodes and spleen, the predominanceof plasma cells and basophilic macrophages, and the acute glomerulo-nephritis,led these observers to postulate that rickettsiae may exert hyperergic effectsin addition to the better known diffuse vascular phenomena caused by them.\n\nThe second important investigation of the pathology ofepidemic typhus was initiated by the collection of material from 23 fatal casesstudied by the U.S.A. Typhus Commission in Cairo, Egypt, during 1943-45, whichwas reviewed by Spitz and Allen. This, along with material from additionalcases, was subsequently studied by members of the Committee on Pathology,Division of Medical Sciences, National Research Council, in collaboration withthe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The splendid report30of this group was not issued until 1953 but because of its broad scope andpertinence to other work discussed in this chapter, the summary statement ofthis study is quoted, as follows:\n\nThis paper describes the lesions encountered in an epidemic oftyphus which occurred in Cairo during 1943-1945. The findings have been comparedto those observed by Wolbach, Todd, and Palfrey in the Warsaw epidemic of 1918and by others since that time in order to bring together in one report all theknown facts abort the pathology of epidemic typhus.\n\nThe patients studied in the Cairo epidemic were Egyptiansbetween the ages of 10 and 70 years. Some of them were undernourished, but therewas no clinical or pathological evidence of avitaminosis, and some hadclinically inactive schistosomiasis. The patients were admitted to the hospitalduring the first 2 weeks of their disease, and the clinical diagnosis oflouse-borne typhus was confirmed in many cases by the Weil-Felix and complementfixation tests. In same instances rickettsiae were recovered from blood or fromnormal lice fed on the patients, and each strain isolated showed thecharacteristics of louse-borne typhus. Two patients were given para-aminobenzoicacid, without clinical or pathological effects. The other patients received nospecific antityphus treatment, and none had been vaccinated against typhus. In14 patients special efforts were made to reduce secondary bacterial infection byusing sulfonamides and penicillin when necessary. This paper and the reports ofthe United States of America Typhus Commission on the clinical and laboratoryfeatures constitute one of the few comprehensive accounts of an epidemic oftyphus in Egypt or, indeed, in any tropical country. It seems likely, in view ofthe discovery of antibiotics that may be effective in the treatment of thedisease and of the development of satisfactory vaccines, that there may neveragain be a similar opportunity to study an epidemic of typhus which has not beensignificantly modified either by treatment or by complicating infection.\n\nThe lesions discovered in the Cairo patientswere essentially the same as those described in other epidemics in differentparts of the world and in experimental animals. The wide dissemination ofvascular and other lesions in the skeletal muscles, which was well illustratedby the frequent involvement of the muscles of the tongue, was more apparent inCairo cases than in others, probably because abundant material was available formicroscopic examination. Evidence was obtained by the demonstration ofrickettsia-\n\n30Pathology of Epidemic Typhus; Report of Fatal Cases Studied by the United States of America Typhus Commission in Cairo, Egypt, During 1943-1945.

Interstitial orchitisand prostatitis of a type not ordinarily seen in other infectious diseases wasalso observed.\n\nNew information has been obtained concerning the topography oflesions in the central nervous system and the effect of the duration of theillness on the intensity of the reaction. So-called microinfarcts have beendemonstrated for the first time in the brains of patients who died from epidemictyphus.\n\nGlomerulonephritis did not occur in the Cairo patients, and areview of published articles has led to the conclusion that its occurrence hasnot been proved. The bulk of the evidence supports the idea that renal failurein epidemic typhus is probably due to extrarenal factors, such as increasedprotein catabolism, dehydration, and reduction of arterial blood pressure,rather than to primary renal damage brought about by direct action of therickettsiae. We have not been able to convince ourselves that lower nephronnephrosis occurs.\n\nThe pathological observations that have been briefly described here are wellillustrated in the Committee's report; selected prints are reproduced as figures12 through 32, through the courtesy of the Archives of Pathology.\n\nÂ 173\n\nFIGURE12.-(Top) Capillary in derma showing swelling and proliferation of endotheliumto point of occlusion.

The most active work in this connection was performed at the Division ofVirus and Rickettsial Diseases, Medical Department Professional Service Schools,Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C., at the Cairo Unit of the U.S.A. TyphusCommission, and at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.\n\nWeil-Felix test-In 1916, Felix31 demonstrated that sera from patients with epidemic typhus fever wouldagglutinate suspensions of Proteus microorganisms. Although it was soonrecognized that these bacteria were not etiologically related to typhus fever,the agglutination of Proteus organisms was quickly developed into adiagnostic test for typhus. Further study revealed that Proteus vulgaris organismscould be dissociated into a motile flagellated \"H\" type and anonmotile unflagellated \"O\" type. The diagnostic agglutinin thatappears in the blood of typhus fever patients is the somatic \"O\" type.Additional experience prior to World War II indicated that suspensions of the ProteusOX-19 strain were agglutinated by sera from typhus fever cases; that OX-19 andanother strain, Proteus OX-2, were often agglutinated by Rocky Mountainspotted fever sera; and that suspensions of still another variant, ProteusOX-K, were agglutinated by scrub typhus sera (p. 133). There remained, however,conflicting statements as to the time of appearance of the agglutinins duringthe course of illness, and concerning what constituted a significant ordiagnostic titer. Accordingly, early in 1943, Plotz sought to determine the riseand fall of the various types of demonstrable antibodies in cases of epidemictyphus fever. Serial serum specimens were obtained from 32 untreated andunvaccinated typhus fever cases studied by members of the Typhus Commission inCairo. Blood specimens were obtained early in the disease, during the course ofillness, and as long after convalescence as possible. It was thus possible toestablish patterns of antibody dynamics in cases confirmed, in 21 instances, asepidemic typhus by isolation of the strain. The results of the variousserological tests performed on these sera were summarized in an important seriesof papers from the Army Medical School.32\n\n31Felix, A.: Die Serodiagnostik des Fleckfiebers.

A rise in titerwas found in all cases when early and late specimens were compared. A test wasregarded as having diagnostic significance when the titer rose fourfold,occurring, in this group of cases, by the 5th to the 13th day of disease. Testson followup sera showed that the titer had fallen to insignificant levels withinabout 3 months after the onset of illness. Table 18 shows the characteristicpattern as observed in one of these patients.\n\nTABLE 18.-Weil-Felix Proteusagglutination tests in epidemic typhus (case 1344) strainisolated\n\nDay of disease\n\nSerum titer with Proteus-\n\nOX-19\n\nOX-2\n\nOX-K\n\n4th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8th\n\n1:20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10th\n\n1:320\n\n1:20\n\n0\n\n12th\n\n1:1,280\n\n1:40\n\n0\n\n14th\n\n1:640\n\n1:40\n\n0\n\n19th\n\n1:640\n\n1:160\n\n0\n\n20th\n\n1:640\n\n1:80\n\n0\n\n23d\n\n1:640\n\n1:80\n\n0\n\n25th\n\n1:320\n\n1:80\n\n0\n\n27th\n\n1:160\n\n1:40\n\n0\n\n115th\n\n1:20\n\n1:20\n\n0\n\n286th\n\n1:20\n\n1:10\n\n0\n\n713th\n\n1:40\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSource: Wertman, Kenneth: The Weil-Felix Reaction.

An agglutination titer of 1: 160 or more developed in 191 (or 94 percent) ofthese subjects. Sera in five cases were entirely negative, sera in four othersgave complete agglutination only to a dilution of 1: 40, and in three more, to1: 80. Of interest was the finding that the complement fixation tests yieldeddiagnostic titer changes in all of these patients. Thus were the Weil-Felix andcomplement fixation reactions found to be dissociated phenomena. A similardissociation was also demonstrated for the Weil-Felix and rickettsialagglutination responses. (See p. 185.) This significant observation isillustrated in table 20.\n\nTABLE 19.-Weil-Felix ProteusOX-19 agglutination results on1,002 sera from 203 patients with typhus fever\n\n1Complete agglutination in dilution given.\n\nSource: Zarafonetis, C.

He pointed out that, despite the introduction of specific diagnosticreagents, the Weil-Felix reaction remained a valuable laboratory aid, asfollows:\n\n* * * The value of the Proteusagglutination test is that these antibodies appear somewhat earlier than thespecific ones. The antigen is easy to prepare and the technic can be performedin any diagnostic laboratory. It should be emphasized, however, that asignificant test is one in which a rise in antibody titer can be demonstratedand no single titer should be regarded as significant. Since one rickettsialdisease cannot be differentiated from another by means of this test, it must beregarded as only a diagnostic aid. The demonstration of the presence of specificantibodies, either complement fixing or rickettsial agglutinating, is necessaryto establish a final serologic diagnosis.\n\n34Wertman, Kenneth: The Weil-Felix Reaction.

In aseries of serological studies at the Cairo laboratory of the Typhus Commission,35it was demonstrated, first, that a 1.0 ml. stimulating dose of typhus vaccine in100 multivaccinated individuals resulted in no significant change in Weil-Felixagglutination titers in tests with suspensions of Proteus OX-19, OX-2,and OX-K on sera taken before and 2 weeks after the injection. Secondly, noanamnestic reactions were detected when these tests were performed on sera from104 febrile patients who had previously been vaccinated. Finally, serologicaltests were performed on serial serum specimens from 29 cases of suspectedepidemic typhus developing subsequently to vaccination. Here, it was found thatthe titer changes in Proteus OX-19 agglutination tests were greater thanthose in the first and second groups and were, furthermore, of sufficientmagnitude to have diagnostic significance. Examples of results in typhus casesoccurring after vaccination are given in table 15.\n\nComplement fixation tests with rickettsial antigens-Numerousinvestigators were aware of the limitations of the Weil-Felix tests and stroveto develop specific rickettsial antigens for use in complement fixation andagglutination tests. The preparation of pure suspensions of rickettsiae insufficient quantity was an obstacle until, in 1938, Cox introduced the yolk-sacculture method. Using this method of rickettsial cultivation, Bengtson36prepared antigens and successfully performed complement fixation tests upon serafrom murine typhus cases. In 1942, Craigie37 demonstrated that rickettsiae could be separated from yolk-sac suspensionsby ether extraction, thereby eliminating most of the embryonic egg materials.This made available essentially pure suspensions of rickettsiae for use asantigens in serological tests and vaccines. Indeed, Wertman38later showed that this method actually increased the specificity of therickettsial suspensions by removing about half of the syphilitic antigensnormally present in tissues of the embryonic chick. Plotz and his associates39soon noted that sera from both epidemic and murine typhus patients gavecomplement fixation titers with both epidemic and murine antigens. Theseinvestigators found that by repeated washing and centrifugation of therickettsial suspensions a \"soluble substance\" present in thesupernatant fluid could be removed.

Theresuspended rickettsial suspensions were then shown to be essentially specificfor homologous sera. Thus was made possible the serological differentiationbetween epidemic and endemic typhus, with obvious epidemiological as well asclinical significance.\n\nThis specific complement fixation test was used in severallaboratories, but comprehensive data for nonvaccinated cases were recordedprimarily at the Army Medical School and by the Cairo Unit of the TyphusCommission. At the Army Medical School, Plotz and his coworkers performedsystematic complement fixation tests on the sera from the Cairo series of 32unvaccinated patients with typhus fever (p. 179). All of these patients showed arise in titer in tests with epidemic antigen; 56 percent gave positivecomplement fixation by the 10th day, 78 percent by the 12th day, and 100 percentby the 16th day of illness. Most of them gave fixation with epidemic antigen andno fixation with murine antigen (table 22). Where cross-fixation did occur, thetiter with homologous (epidemic) antigen was always higher than with murineantigen. All cases showed persistence of complement fixing antibodies, even whenspecimens taken many months after onset of the disease were examined.\n\nTABLE 22.-Complementfixation test results in case 1344, epidemictyphus-strain isolated\n\nDay of disease\n\nSerum titer with-\n\nEpidemic antigen\n\nMurine antigen\n\n4th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8th\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10th\n\n1:20\n\n0\n\n12th\n\n1:1,280\n\n0\n\n14th\n\n1:1,280\n\n0\n\n19th\n\n1:640\n\n0\n\n20th\n\n1:640\n\n0\n\n23d\n\n1:640\n\n0\n\n25th\n\n1:640\n\n0\n\n27th\n\n1:640\n\n0\n\n115th\n\n1:80\n\n0\n\n286th\n\n1:40\n\n0\n\nSource: Plotz, H., Wertman, K., and Bennett, B.

[Official record.]\n\nEmploying the same technique and antigens prepared by theDivision of Virus and Rickettsial Diseases, Zarafonetis40performed complement fixation tests on 1,002 sera from 203 cases of typhusfever, with results sum-\n\n40See footnote 33, p. 180.\n\n185\n\nmarized in table 23. Almost all of the cases were epidemictyphus fever, confirmed in many instances by isolation of the strain. In onlytwo patients did the complement fixation titer with murine antigen equal orexceed that obtained with epidemic antigen. Sera from two of the cases failed todevelop titers in complement fixation tests with either epidemic or murinetyphus antigens, while both showed good responses in Weil-Felix OX-19 andrickettsial agglutination tests. From the serological findings in these twocases (table 24), it appears that the rickettsial agglutination response isdissociated from the antibody that gives rise to complement fixation. From thisand from similar observations with the Weil-Felix test (p. 181), it is seen thatall three of the serological reactions occur independently of one another, andone test may be negative while the other two give a positive finding for typhusfever.\n\nTABLE 23.-Complementfixation results on 1,002 sera from 203 patients with typhus fever\n\nSource: Zarafonetis, C.

Tests were made on sera taken before and 2weeks after a 1.0 ml. stimulating dose of typhus vaccine in 100 multivaccinatedsubjects (p. 183). Sera from 21 of these individuals gave epidemic complementfixation titers ranging from 1:4 to 1:32 before the stimulating dose, while 2weeks later sera from 70 of the subjects were positive in dilutions ranging from1:4 to 1:128. Where there was an increase in complement fixation titer as aresult of booster vaccination, there was a tendency to return to the previouslevel within 8 weeks after the booster injection.\n\nThe question of anamnestic reactions was studied in 104 persons who had beenimmunized with vaccine of the Cox type at some time before the\n\n186\n\nTABLE 24.-Serologicalfindings in two cases of typhus fever with negative results in complementfixation tests\n\n1End point titer was not reached.\n\nSource: Zarafonetis, C.
