        "text": "Diseases > Fleas > Murine Typhus\n\nMurine Typhus\n\nMurine typhus, also known as \"endemic typhus,\" \"Mexican typhus,\" and \"flea-borne typhus,\" is a flea-borne infection of humans worldwide. Symptoms are similar to those of epidemic typhus fever (transmitted by the human body louse), but typically much less severe. If untreated, patients with murine typhus can require hospitalization, but the case fatality rate is only about 2% in the U.S. However, travelers to Asia and African should note that the case fatality rate is thought to approach 70% in certain areas in which murine typhus occurs.\n\nIn the U.S., 20-80 cases of murine typhus are reported each year, but many more cases go undiagnosed. The vast majority of cases occur in Texas, but several are reported each year in California and Hawaii. The causative agent is a bacterium that exists primarily in rodents in urban areas. However, murine typhus also exists in rural areas in a transmission cycle that involves opossums, feral cats, feral dogs, and the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis.\n\nRickettsia felis and the Cat Flea\n\nA disease very similar to murine typhus appears to be caused by a closely related species of bacterium with the scientific name Rickettsia felis. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is thought to be the vector to humans, and the mode of transmission may be via flea bite instead of by contact with infected flea feces.\n\nCausative agent\n\nA bacterium with the scientific name Rickettsia typhi (R. mooseri in older literature).\n\nIt is an intracellular parasite that infects cells lining the walls of small blood vessels.\n\nGeographical distribution of cases\n\nWorldwide.\n\nIn the U.S.: nearly all cases reported from southern Texas, southern California, and Hawaii.\n\nSymptoms of infection\n\nHeadache, backache, joint pains, and nausea.\n\nSpotted rash appearing initially on the body, which subsequently may develop on arms and legs.\n\nReservoir hosts of Rickettsia typhi in the U.S.\n\nIn urban areas: several species of rodents including mice and rats (especially the Norway rat).\n\nIn rural areas: opossums and feral cats.\n\nNOTE: Reservoir hosts of Rickettsia typhi typically show no signs of the infection.\n\nVectors of Rickettsia typhi in the U.S.\n\nIn urban areas: the Oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis.\n\nIn rural areas: the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis.\n\nModes of Transmission\n\nPrimarily via infected flea feces scratched into skin or rubbed into an eye.\n\nNOTE: Transovariole transmission has been documented in female Oriental rat fleas.\n\nNOTE: Laboratory research suggests that transmission is possible via bites of the cat flea.\n\nDiagnosis of infection\n\nDifficult because initial symptoms are similar to several other diseases, including epidemic typhus fever.\n\nSerological tests are needed to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nTreatment of infection\n\nA physician prescribed antibiotic.\n\nPrevention of infection\n\nThere is no vaccine available in the U.S.\n\nDo not provide foods that attract reservoir animals such as rodents, opossums, and feral cats.\n\nDo not provide places for reservoir animals to hide or live.\n\nControl of vectors\n\nConsult with a veterinarian regarding flea control on pets."
