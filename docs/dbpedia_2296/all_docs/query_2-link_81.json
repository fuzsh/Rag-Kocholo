        "text": "PASADENA, Calif.— Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD) has received an elevated number of reports of typhus fever infections in Pasadena compared to in other years (as of May), and would like to encourage the community to take action to prevent further infections.\n\nTyphus fever is a disease spread to humans by infected fleas and can cause high fever, chills, headache and rash in people. Generally, one to five cases are reported in Pasadena per year, and most cases occur in the summer or fall. However, in 2024, eight Pasadena residents have already been reported with typhus fever. All reported cases have received treatment and recovered.\n\nIn Pasadena, infected fleas are primarily carried by feral cats and opossums. People who regularly interact with these animals are at risk. Pet dogs and cats that are allowed outside can encounter infected fleas and expose their owners to these fleas. Typhus is treatable with antibiotics with good recovery, however three deaths from typhus were reported in 2023 in Los Angeles County. Pets and animals do not get sick from typhus.\n\nThere are simple ways to prevent the spread of typhus:\n\nReduce yard debris and trim overgrown vegetation to discourage the presence of wild animals like feral cats and opossums\n\nDo not leave pet food outdoors\n\nDo not provide food or water for wild animals\n\nKeep garbage containers tightly covered\n\nSeal all openings and crawl spaces under the home\n\nRoutinely treat pet dogs and cats with flea control medication\n\nTyphus is diagnosed by clinical symptoms and a blood test. Local health providers are required to report any Pasadena residents with a suspected or confirmed typhus diagnosis within one working day to PPHD at (626) 744-6089 Monday to Friday 8 A.M. – 5 P.M., or (626) 744-6043 after hours.\n\nFor more information on typhus prevention:\n\nSan Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District: https://www.sgvmosquito.org/fleas-and-flea-borne-typhus\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/index.html\n\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health: http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/vectortyphus.html"
