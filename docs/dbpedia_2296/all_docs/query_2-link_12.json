        "text": "Flea-Borne (Endemic) Typhus\n\nTyphus refers to a group of infectious diseases that are caused by rickettsial organisms and result in an acute febrile illness. The principle diseases of this group are epidemic (or louse-borne) typhus, flea-borne (or endemic) typhus, and scrub typhus.\n\nFlea-borne typhus (sometimes called murine typhus) is the only one of these diseases naturally occurring in LA County and is caused by Rickettsia typhi bacteria. Flea-borne typhus can spread to humans from bacteria found in infected fleas. Infection happens when the feces from infected fleas are rubbed into cuts or scrapes in the skin or rubbed into the eyes.\n\nSymptoms can start within two weeks after contact with the infected flea and include high fever, headache, chills, and body aches. A rash can appear on the chest, back, arms, or legs. In rare cases, there may be swelling at the lining of the brain (meningitis) and heart valves (endocarditis). Fatalities are uncommon, occurring in less than 1% of cases. The disease is typically mild in young children. Typhus infection is not vaccine preventable, but can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nNews and Updates:\n\nLetter to Physicians: Vector-borne Disease Risk for Los Angeles County Residents, August 2023\n\nReport: Fleaborne TyphusAssociated Deaths  Los Angeles County, California, 2022\n\nLAC DPH Health Advisory: Increases of Flea-Borne Typhus (11-16-22)\n\nLAC DPH Health Alert: Outbreaks of Flea-Borne Typhus (12-2-21)\n\nLetter: Letter to Mayors and City Managers--Guidance on actions for cities to help prevent endemic flea-borne typhus infections (3-22-19)\n\nPress Release: Update on Flea-Borne Typhus in Los Angeles County (2-7-19)\n\nLAC DPH Health Alert Update: Outbreaks of Flea-Borne Typhus Los Angeles County (10-12-18)\n\nLAC DPH Health Alert: Outbreak of Flea-Borne Typhus in Downtown Los Angeles (10-4-18)\n\nPress Release: Public Health Reports Several Cases of Flea-Borne Typhus (10-4-18)\n\nTyphus Data:\n\nResources:\n\nTyphus Frequently Asked Questions\n\nEnglish / Spanish\n\nTyphus Tips for Prevention\n\nEnglish / Spanish\n\nOccupational Health FAQs\n\nEnglish / Spanish\n\nFlea-Borne Typhus Flyer English / Spanish\n\nReporting\n\nFlea-borne typhus and other rickettsial infections are reportable in California. Reporting of cases guides the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to target surveillance activities and health education. A Confidential Morbidity Report (CMR) can be used to file a report. The report is available as an online fillable PDF. The CMR may be faxed to the DPH Morbidity Unit at (888) 397-3778 or (213) 482-5508. You may also report cases by telephone during normal business hours from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. to (888) 397-3993.
