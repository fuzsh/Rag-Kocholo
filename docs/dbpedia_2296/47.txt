ACCORDING to the Lancet of October 16, there have been 23 deaths from an outbreak of typhus during the past eight months in Palestine. The southern districts were chiefly affected, and the Department of Health has prepared special delousing units and portable showers for use in future cases. The disease is thought to have been introduced from neighbouring countries, especially Egypt. Murine typhus conveyed by rats is endemic in Palestine, but the present epidemic, which is more serious, is lice-borne and has not been seen in Palestine since the end of the War of 1914-18. A vaccine has been used with good effect, and a special laboratory for research and control of typhus has been opened under the charge of Prof. Kligler, head of the Department of Bacteriology and Hygiene(see also NATUBE of November 27, p. 627).
