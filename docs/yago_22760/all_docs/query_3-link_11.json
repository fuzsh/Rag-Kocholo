        "text": "Tiy (Tiye) married the Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III (ruled circa 1390–1352 B.C.E.) and had six children, one of whom, Akhenaten, became pharaoh after his father and married Nefertiti. Amenhotep III seems to have relied on Tiy’s political advice, being more interested in sports and the outdoors than in his pharaonic duties. She was an important power during her son’s reign as well. Between Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, who may have had an incestuous relationship with his mother, many shrines were built for Tiy, mostly during her lifetime."
