Although she was not of royal blood, Tiy became the favoured wife of Amenhotep III (reigned 1390–53 bce), a powerful king of the 18th dynasty, who gave her considerable prominence in state affairs and in public ceremonies; her name appeared with the king’s on official documents. She was the mother of Amenhotep IV, or Akhenaton, and remained prominent after his accession. Her mummy, which is kept in the Egyptian Museum at Cairo, was identified in 1976."
