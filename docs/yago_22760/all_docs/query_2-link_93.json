        "text": "Tuthmosis IV left his son an empire of immense size, wealth, and power: the 18th Dynasty of Egypt.\n\nAt 12 years old, Amenhotep III (c. 1386–1353 BCE) came to the throne and married Tiye in a royal ceremony. Tiye, who was among several of Amenhotep’s wives, would bear seven children. However, immediately after the marriage she became the one—the great royal wife, an honor that her own mother-in-law never held. Tiye could then outrank her in courtly matters.\n\nAlthough Amenhotep and Tiye were by today’s standards still in their youth, Egypt’s wealthy and powerful often ruled at an early age. According to Egyptologist Zahi Hawass, “Amenhotep III was born into a world where Egypt reigned supreme. Its coffers were filled with gold, and its vassals bowed down before the mighty rulers of the Two Lands [Egypt].”\n\nAfter his marriage to Tiye, Amenhotep continued his father’s work in implementing new building programs throughout Egypt. During his reign, he ordered the construction of more than 250 buildings, temples, and stone slabs erected as monuments. All were immense in size and boasted intricate details. Today, the statues known as the Colossi of Memnon, are all that is left of Amenhotep III’s mortuary temple. According to historians, Amenhotep envisioned an “Egypt so splendid that it would leave one in awe.”\n\nA master of diplomacy, Amenhotep placed surrounding nations in his debt by giving them gold. Doing so encouraged loyalty and made them followers. These relationships soon grew profitable and his generosity to friendly kings became well established.\n\nAmenhotep was known for his hunting skills which were noted in inscriptions: “the total number of lions killed by His Majesty with his own arrows, from the first to the tenth year [of his reign] was 102 wild lions.” He was also an adept military leader. Some historians say that he “probably fought, or directed his military commanders, in one campaign in Nubia and he had inscriptions made to commemorate that expedition.”\n\nMany foreign rulers wanted Amenhotep to provide them Egyptian wives. Respecting the women of his land, he swore that “no daughter of Egypt had ever been sent to a foreign land and would not be sent under his reign.”\n\nAmenhotep was also humble in his practice of the ancient Egyptian religion, which proved to be the foundation for his interest in the arts as well as construction. His greatest contribution to Egyptian culture was his ability to maintain peace and prosperity, which enabled him to devote his time to the arts.\n\nAmenhotep suffered from severe dental problems, arthritis, and possibly obesity in his later years. After ruling Egypt for 38 years, he died in 1353 BCE.\n\nLetters penned by foreign rulers expressed their grief and condolences to Queen Tiye. The letters confirmed that these monarchs hoped to continue the same good relations with Egypt under the new king as they had with Amenhotep III. With Amenhotep’s passing, his son, then called Amenhotep IV, began his reign.\n\nIsabelle Price\n\nBy Emil Guillermo\n\nI know the Olympics are over. Consider this me just running through the tape. You know, the one at the finish line.\n\n(Remember as the 100-meter gold medalist Noah Lyles found out, a leg can beat you, but it’s the first torso to cross that counts).\n\nI’m still savoring all of the Olympics highlights.\n\nMy favorite moment — even more than the wild Stephen Curry three that nailed the gold in men’s basketball–was the Women’s 4×100 relay and Sha’Carri Richardson. Far behind, as she got the baton for the anchor leg, Richardson was magic in motion. With a phenomenal burst of speed, she made up the lost ground in seconds. But it was her glance back at the smoked competition as she crossed the finished line that got me.\n\nUnforgettable.\n\nTo top it off was the closing ceremony that included H.E.R., singing the “Star Spangled Banner,” our country’s national anthem. It was H.E.R. representing all of us — the Asian American Filipino/African American pop star a/k/a Gabriella Sarmiento Wilson of Vallejo, Calif.\n\nShe was the face of America, welcoming the next games to our nation where in 2028, the entire country will be closer to what California already is, a minority-majority state. Seeing the multiracial singer was the extension of an ideal theme that a world where people have a love interest in one another, will get along with each other.\n\nIt’s the hope of a world at peace beyond the Olympic zone.\n\nKAMALA IN THE BAY AREA FOR $13 MILLION\n\nAs the closing ceremonies were relayed from Paris, another biracial icon was continuing her Olympian sprint to the presidency. Kamala Harris was back in the Bay Area to share her campaign joy with rich homies.\n\nAt the Fairmount in San Francisco, the tickets ranged from $3,300 to up to $500,000 — a sliding scale for the well-heeled. Far from the $5 dollar internet pitches that end up in your inbox daily.\n\nThere were some who gladly paid at the low-end forgoing a vacation to support a historic run to save democracy. Nearly 700 attendees offering up more than $13 million were reported on the inside, including high tech folks and politicos like attorney general Rob Bonta.\n\nOutside of the event, Harris also drew the same type of Pro-Gaza protestors who have dogged her at events in Las Vegas and Detroit. “Killer Kamala, you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide,” was the chant, according to reports.\n\nThe protestors accuse Israel of genocide against the Palestinians but hold the Biden/Harris administration just as accountable for the tens of thousands who have died in Gaza.\n\nHarris never saw the protestors on Nob Hill. But she saw them in Detroit, where she let the protestors have their First Amendment right, and then spoke directly them.\n\n“If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that, otherwise, I’m speaking,” Harris said to cheers from supporters who drowned out the protestors.\n\nIt was as tough and as candid as Harris has been on any issue since she began her campaign.\n\nFor now, she is the joyful, feelgood Kamala, raising millions, staying on message, and “moving forward not backward.”\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEmil Guillermo is a journalist and commentator.

According to him, the 90-minute ceremony was organized to honor all who died in the blasts and officially announce absolving Black men who were unjustly court-martialed for refusing to load bombs on naval cargo ships during World War II due to safety concerns.\n\n“This event marks a turning point in our nation’s history, a moment when we confront the ghosts of the past and embrace the promise of more justice,” Del Toro said. “For eight decades, the story of Port Chicago has been a stark reminder of a grave injustice. We as a nation will never be able to express our full gratitude to all deceased and their families for their dedication, service, and sacrifice.”\n\nOn July 20, a diverse group of 500 people were shuttled from the Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO) to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine Memorial where two deadly explosions occurred on the night of July 17, 1944.\n\nThe ceremony was hosted in partnership with the National Park Service (NPS), Friends of Port Chicago National Memorial, and the U.S. Army’s 834th Transportation Battalion.\n\nThe event also marked the 30th year the site was established as a memorial.\n\nAlong with Del Toro, dignitaries and elected officials in attendance were U.S. Congressmen John Garamendi (D-CA-08) and Thurgood Marshall Jr., whose father, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, sought justice for the Port Chicago 50, the Black men who were wrongfully convicted in the fall of 1944 of insubordination during World War II.\n\nKelli English, the NPS’s service-wide program manager for Cooperating Associations and Partnerships, said tears from colleagues were flowing the day they heard about the exoneration of the men. English is part of the NPS crew that conducts tours of the National Memorial and shares the history of the tragedy.\n\n“They never should have been court-martialed in some cases and convicted of other cases, but it does provide some closures for the families and descendants of those men,” English told California Black Media. “It’s so important to us. It’s the only amount of justice delivered years after the fact.”\n\nThe blasts resulted in the death of 320 sailors, 202 of them Black American sailors who were loading nearly 5,000 tons of munitions from a train into the naval cargo ships. About 400 more people were injured and the cargo train and both ships – SS Quinault Victory and SS EA Bryan – were destroyed.\n\nOakland Post\n\nBy Tanu Henry, California Black Media\n\nLast week, California State University (CSU), Sacramento (Sac State) celebrated 80 students who are enrolled in the inaugural class of its Black Honors College (BHC).\n\nDubbed a “college within a college,” the BHC program is the first of its kind in the United States.\n\n“Using the honors college model as a way to create a unique experience for students who are interested in Black history, life and culture,” said Dr. J. Luke Wood, President of Sacramento State. Wood was speaking at the event organized to celebrate the students and launch the program, held the afternoon of Aug. 8 in the university ballroom.\n\n“While in our minds we were creating this with the intention of serving students from the Black community, we also want you to know that we are open to anyone and everyone. We do not want to be inclusive by being exclusive,” continued wood, who also challenged the students to leave Sacramento “better than they found it.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama was featured in a video sharing a congratulatory message with the Sac State family for launching the BHC.\n\nObama said the BHC told the students in the BHC’s first cohort that they are “uniquely poised for success.”\n\n“Channel your energy to a cause higher than yourself,” he encouraged them.\n\nCSU Chancellor Mildred Garcia said the BHC serves a model that could be replicated at other campuses.\n\n“Sac State is exemplifying what we can do across the CSU,” said Garcia, adding that she is confident the BHC students will emerge as “courageous leaders” in California and around the world.\n\nAccording to the Sac State, the BHC is “an enhanced co-curricular college for students providing specialized coursework, distinctive research opportunities and creative arts, residential living and learning programs, scholarships, and distinguished recognition.”\n\nIt is “designed for students who are interested in Black history, life, culture, and contributions. All incoming students who have a GPA of 3.5 or higher are encouraged to apply,” the program’s description continues.\n\nSeveral state leaders, university leaders, elected officials, education advocates, Sacramento officials and international guests attended the event, including Assemblymember Steven Bradford (D-Inglewood), Assemblymember Akilah Weber (D-La Mesa), Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, Tani Cantil-Sakuye, President and CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California, Morakane Mosupyoe, Speaker of the Guateng Provincial Legislature in South Africa, among others.\n\nStephen K. Benjamin, Senior White House Advisor to President Biden and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement delivered the keynote and read a statement from Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“May you always dream with ambition and lead with conviction,” Harris was quoted in the statement read by Benjamin.\n\nIn his own words, Benjamin said, “History is indeed being made today with “this bold vision.”\n\n“I hope that you are both humbled and excited,” he said, reminding them that “titles don’t make leaders.”\n\n“Leaders are servants,” Benjamin continued. “Leaders give. Leaders build other leaders. Within each one of you is the power to change this world.”\n\nDuring the event, Wood thanked Sacramento’s Tsakopoulos family, for a $2.5 million donation to the BHC.\n\nThe college “will give us a voice, a way to make change, and a family,” said Savanna Beattie, a student in the BHC’s inaugural class, who told guests that she will study nursing and hopes to work in a neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nOakland Post"
