There are 63 tombs which have been discovered in the Valley of the Kings belonging to the Pharaohs and leading dignitaries. Many of the tombs were discovered by the Egyptian tomb robbers of antiquity but during the 19th and 20th centuries renewed interest in Egyptology led European Egyptologists, such as Edward Ayrton, to make further excavations in the Valley of the Kings, hoping to find undiscovered tombs, complete with fabulous treasures.\n\nAncient Egyptian Tomb numbering system\n\nAll tombs are and numbered and the legends KV, QV, WV & TT indicate their location as follows:\n\nKV (e.g. KV no.35) refers to the King Valley\n\nQV (e.g. QV no.66) refers to the burial of Nerfertari in the Queen Valley\n\nWV (e.g. WV no.23) refers to the burial of the Pharaoh Ay in the Western Valley\n\nTT (e.g. TT no.55) refers to the burial of Ramose designated to the category of Theban Tomb\n\nThere are at least 415 catalogued tombs, designated TT for Theban Tomb which are burial places of nobles and important court officials"
