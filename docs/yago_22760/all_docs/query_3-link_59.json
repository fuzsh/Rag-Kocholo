        "text": "Mother of Amenhotep IV / Akhenaten.\n\nBut perhaps her biggest effect on the history of Egypt was being the mother to the heretic king Amenhotep IV - later Akhenaten. Was it Tiye who first encouraged her son to follow her religious yearnings no matter how controversial they were? Maybe Akhenaten inherited his mother's strong personality and this gave him the strength to go on and revolutionise the religion of Egypt.\n\nscene from Akhetaten, showing Akhenaten leading Tiye\n\nTiye did have other children - two daughters and another son, the son, Tuthmose, was originally the heir to the throne of Egypt but died whilst still a child. One of the daughters, Sitamun, was later married to her father (a common practice in Egypt at that time, as was the marriage of the Pharaoh to his own sister), Tiye's other daughter, Baketaten, was often shown accompanying Tiye on her visits to Akhenaten's city of Akhetaten.\n\nThe Mummy of Queen Tiye"
