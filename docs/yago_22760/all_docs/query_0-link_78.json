        "text": "Limited edition fine art print of my painting 'Queen Tiye'\n\nQueen Tiye, a key figure in ancient Egyptian history, was one of the most influential queens of Egypt, reigning during the 18th dynasty. She was married to Amenhotep III and played a significant role not only as his consort but also in the diplomatic and religious affairs of the time. Tiye is remembered for her intelligence, political acumen, and the strong influence she wielded both during her husband's reign and in the upbringing of her son, Akhenaten, who would go on to instigate a religious revolution in Egypt.\n\nFor the tarot card \"The High Priestess,\" depicting Queen Tiye, I envisioned a portrait that embodies her wisdom, authority, and the mystical aura that surrounds her legacy. The High Priestess card symbolizes intuition, mystery, and understanding that goes beyond the mundane world.\n\nThese high-quality museum prints are made using premium 310gsm archival cotton rag paper, ensuring that they will last for years to come. If you're a collector, you'll be pleased to know that this print is now also available in a fine art canvas format. The canvas prints are created with the finest materials available, featuring a shiny, glossy finish that highlights the vivid, brilliant colors. They're also inkjet-coated, which means they dry quickly, are water-resistant and smudge-proof.\n\nTo maintain the exclusivity and value of this collection, each print will be produced in a limited run, with each piece individually numbered and signed by me.\n\nThis collection is the culmination of my passion, dedication, and hard work, and I'm thrilled to share it with you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.\n\nHere are some reasons to consider purchasing my art:\n\nYou get a 30-day trial period and can return the artwork if you're not satisfied.\n\nChoose from a wide range of sizes to fit your space perfectly, all at accessible prices.\n\nThey are handmade in Germany and feel and look like my original paintings.\n\nGift your loved ones with an exceptional and personal piece of art that's sure to inspire and impress.\n\nBring a touch of sophistication and beauty to your space with my museum-quality fine-art reproductions\n\nWith influences from Art Nouveau, Japan, and ancient mythology, each painting offers a unique aesthetic that you won't find in mainstream art, making your space truly one-of-a-kind.\n\nSmall Size (Edition of 100)\n\nPaper size: ~ 21 x 30 cm\n\nRegular Size (Edition of 100)\n\nPaper size: ~ 30 x 42 cm\n\nOversized (Edition of 100):\n\nPaper size: ~ 42 x 59 cm\n\nCanvas (Edition of 50):\n\nPrint size on Canvas: 60 x 80 cm\n\nThe Canvas has an 11 cm border on each side for stretcher bars (stretcher bars not included)."
