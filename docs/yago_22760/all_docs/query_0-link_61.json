        "text": "Queen Tiye\n\nFamily\n\nYuya, the father of Tiye, was a wealthy non-royal landowner from the Upper Egyptian town of Akhmim. Where he also held positions as a priest and oxen-superintendent or chariot-commander. As evidenced by her several titles (Singer of Hathor, Chief of the Entertainers of both Amun and Min. ), Tiye’s mother, Thuya, belonged to numerous religious cults and may have been a part of the royal family. Get to Know all about Queen Tiye Death, Mummy, and Tomb.\n\nDue to the characteristics of his mummy and the numerous ways his name has been spelled, Egyptologists have hypothesized that Tiye’s father, Yuya, was not Egyptian in origin.\n\nSome contend that the queen’s strong political and unusual religious beliefs may not only have been a result of her strong character but also may have been a result of her foreign ancestry.\n\nAnen, Tiye’s brother, was the Second Prophet of Amun. Although there is no specific date or monument that proves a relationship between the two, Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamen as pharaoh following the latter’s death, is thought to be yet another brother of Tiye.\n\nQueen Tiye Marriage\n\nEgyptologists assumed this relationship based on Ay’s ancestry (also from Akhmin), as he is known to have constructed a chapel there honoring the local deity Min and as the recipient of the majority of the titles Yuya, Tiye’s father, had at the court of Amenhotep III while he was alive.\n\nBy the second year of Amenhotep III’s rule, Tiye was wed to him.\n\nHe need a greater link to the royal family because he was the offspring of his father’s second wife. The release of commemorative scarabs declaring Tiye as Great Royal Wife and listing her parents served to mark their union. Perhaps between the ages of six and twelve, he appears to be crowned when still a young child. At least seven, and possibly more, children were born into the marriage.\n\nMonument\n\nShe was venerated as a combination of the goddesses Tefnut and Hathor in Sedeinga, Nubia, where her husband built a temple just for her.\n\nIn his Year 12 he also had an artificial lake colossi statue for her. She is equally tall as her husband on the enormous statue that is currently on display in the Egyptian Museum. It is well known that this queen erected a number of monuments for herself and her relatives.\n\nThe “Secret Room” is a tiny tomb that she constructed for herself. Akhenaten, her son, also constructed the “Secret Tomb,” a tomb at Thebes. She was a referee in the inscriptions of numerous temples and monuments.\n\nShe is believe to have possessed a number of estates in different parts of Egypt, including Amarna and Fayoum. The same is true of Amenhotep III, a talented ruler who oversaw the expansion of numerous temples, including the Temple of Amen-Re at Karnak and Ramesses II’s temple at Abu Simbel.\n\nDeath of Queen Tiye\n\nWhen Queen Tiye became ill, her history took a turn for the worse since she was more worried about her husband and sons than anything else. After crowned king, she outlived all three of her sons: Ankhesenpaaten, Meketaten, and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. She was excellent in foreign relations in addition to helping the crown-bearers rule the nation. So it was assumed that the kingdom would fall following her death.\n\nThe dynasty experienced a number of problems following the passing of queen Tiye. An illustration of that would be the city starting to lose influence after the passing of Akhenaten, the pharaoh’s son. Although historians are still looking into the historical incidents. The pertinent information there enables us to understand how important queen Tiye’s life was to the royal court. After the passing of queen Tiye, history as we know it came to an end. During her reign, Queen Tiye improved the connection between Egypt and other nations. Get to know more about Queen Tiye Tomb and Mummy.\n\nBurial And Mummy Of Queen Tiye"
