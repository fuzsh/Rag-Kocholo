        "text": "The Great Royal Wife of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III and the grandmother of the famous Tutankhamun, Queen Tiye was an intelligent and fierce woman who wielded a lot of influence at her husband's court and became his trusted adviser. Foreign rulers were often willing to deal directly with her despite coming from more male-dominated cultures.\n\nI've decided to give my rendition of Tiye an Afro based on a yew bust of her hosted at Berlin's Egyptian Museum. Afros are among my favorite hairstyles on women, but unfortunately searching for recent Afro artwork on DeviantArt turns up too many iterations of that annoying &quot;Circus Afro&quot; meme for my taste."
