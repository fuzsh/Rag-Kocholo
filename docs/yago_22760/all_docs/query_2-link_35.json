        "text": "Amenhotep III, was the king of ancient Egypt (reigned c. 1390–53 bce) in a period of peaceful prosperity, who devoted himself to expanding diplomatic contacts and to extensive building in Egypt and Nubia.\n\nIn the fifth year of his reign, Amenhotep conducted campaigns against a territory called Akuyata in Nubia. Thereafter his reign was peaceful, except for some disturbances in the Nile River delta, which Amenhotep, son of Hapu, the king’s most prominent official, quelled by carefully regulating access into Egypt by land and sea.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 18 Things to Know About Ancient Egypt\n\nAmenhotep III in his early years enjoyed hunting in the tradition of his father, Thutmose IV, and grandfather, Amenhotep II, and on two occasions issued large commemorative scarabs to proclaim several of his feats. Early in his reign he married Tiy, a commoner and a shrewd and able woman. She became the chief queen and was the mother of the reforming king Akhenaton. In the 11th year of his reign, Amenhotep ordered the excavation of a large inland basin, the location of which remains unknown.\n\nUtilizing the talents of Amenhotep, son of Hapu, the king engaged in a great construction program, which included his own mortuary temple in western Thebes, of which the Colossi of Memnon remain the most prominent feature, and a major temple at Soleb in Nubia. His palace complex at Malkata in western Thebes was linked to the Nile by a large artificial harbour, the Birket Habu. The king also built the main portions of the temple at Luxor and a pylon in the temple at Karnak, both in ancient Thebes. He also constructed many buildings in Memphis."
