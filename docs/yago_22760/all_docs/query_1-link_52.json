        "text": "In my opinion, marrying your relatives is quite immoral and this affects my view of Amenhotep III greatly. He had many wives and concubines and I find this quite appalling. He seemed to treat the women with respect which is good and he also seemed to be a powerful ruler, husband, and Pharaoh. He took charge in a time of power for Egypt and didn’t care that Tiye was a commoner which is admirable.\n\n– Renee\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, there were no marriage ceremonies. For a woman to be married she would enter into the man’s house and agree upon the marriage. Marriages were typically organized by the parents for a specific price. The groom and the bride’s father would draw up a marriage settlement to be signed by witnesses before they two were married. In most cases, the marriages occurred within the bloodline, in hopes to keep the blood as royal as much as possible. The Egyptians did not realize that this caused major deformities in their children, which is one of the main reasons the pharaohs would die young.\n\nAmenhotep the Third became Pharaoh after his father, Thutmosis IV who died in the 14th century BCE. He resumed this role at only 12 years of age. He then married Tiye, who was not of royal descent or family, but rather the daughter of a commoner. He made her chief queen once he had taken the throne. This ranking was higher than his mother ever had.\n\nTiye was only six or seven when she married Amenhotep, who was most likely six or seven years older than her at the time. She was credited for being extremely helpful throughout the duration of his reign and often made sure things were running when he left. Tiye was also involved throughout various royal affairs. Her relationship with Amenhotep propelled further than being a political relationship, but rather a companionship and long lasting friendship.\n\nAmenhotep also had several wives as well as concubines alongside Tiye. However, Tiye was always the favored one.\n\nSecondary to Tiye, Amenhotep had 4 other wives.\n\nGILUKHIPA\n\nGilukhipa was the daughter of Shuttarna II who was king of the Hurrian Kingdom in the early 14th century BC. The Amana letters were partly addressed to her father from her husband Amenhotep III. Her father and husband had great diplomatic relations and she was sent to Egypt for political reasons to get married to the Pharaoh in his 10th regal year. She was known as the ‘Secondary King’s Wife’.\n\nTADUKHIPA Tadukhipa was the daughter of Hurrian King, Tushratta, who ruled Mitanni in the final years of Amenhotep III reign. She married the Pharaoh in his 36th regal year, almost 3 decades after her aunt, Gilukhipa had married him. Tushratta sent his daughter to be married to further cement their countries diplomatic relations. Shortly after her arrival in Egypt, Amenhotep III died. She later married his son, Amenhotep IV.\n\nSITAMUN\n\nSitamun was an Ancient Egyptian princess and eventually queen consort during the 18th dynasty. She was the eldest daughter of chief royal wife Tiye and Amenhotep III. She later married her own father to keep Egyptian blood in the royal family. Not much is known about her life other than that she was queen consort and daughter of two powerful rulers.\n\nISET\n\nIset also was an Ancient Egyptian princess and eventually queen consort during the 18th dynasty. She was also the daughter of chief royal wife Tiye and Amenhotep III and sister of Sitamun. She married her own father to keep Egyptian blood in the royal family."
