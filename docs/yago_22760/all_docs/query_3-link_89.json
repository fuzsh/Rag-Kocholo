She was known to be a devoted monarch, a faithful scholar, and an extraordinary musician and composer, whom composed over 150songs in her life time. Her most famous piece is “Aloha ‘Oe.” Queen Lili’uokalani was known to never falter in her commitment to the people. She was known for her generosity as she entrusted her estate to provide for orphan children of Hawaiian blood, which was amended later to include other destitute children. She symbolizes the link between traditional Hawaiian culture and society\n\nLet’s start with Pharaoh Hatshepsut. This amazing pharaoh was the first girl pharaoh. This pioneer ruled during the new kingdom, otherwise known as the Golden age. She ruled from about 1473 B.C.E to about 1458 B.C.E. This pharaoh encouraged trade in Egypt and in other civilizations. She made her government stronger by filling her government with royal advisers. She also wanted the same respect that people gave to rulers that are men. Some fun facts about her is that sometimes she wore a fake beard and she shared her rule with male\n\nShe was the only child of king Thutmose the I, and wife/queen Ahmose. Hatshepsut was expected to be queen. After Her father died at age 12, Hatshepsut married her half-brother, Thutmose II. During the reign of Thutmose II Hatshepsut ruled as a normal kind, not a pharaoh. Thutmose II died after a 15 year reign, making Hatshepsut a widow before the age of 30. Hatshepsut had only 1 child with Thutmose the II, and she was named Neferure. The male air was in infant, Thutmose III, so he was too young to assume the throne without any aid. Hatshepsut, was this role, even though she was a girl. Technically Hatshepsut was not the official king of Egypt but it was clear to all that she was the one with power. She began having shown herself in a traditional\n\nQueen Tiye was an important influence on new kingdom Egypt and was the key wife of Amenhotep III and they ruled a peaceful reign. Tiye was the daughter of Yuya which was a officer in the chariotry, priest of min and Tuya (chief of harem of Amun and min) which both had Nubian royal blood origins. Married at a young age, one year after he became pharaoh and gave her the title Great royal wife. Also gave birth to arkhenaten and other children. She greatly shaped foreign relations,\n\nAmenhotep IV better known as Akhenaten is one of the most interesting pharaohs to have ever ruled over Egypt (BBC). He changed his name to Akhenaton, which means 'the servant of Aten' early in his reign (ehistory). He came into power around 1353 BCE and stayed in power for 17 years (BBC). His wife was queen Nefertiti and they had six daughters, he also fathered king Tut (BBC). Akhenaten was a true visionary as he made revolutionary changes to the religion and art of Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe row of hieroglyphics on the side of the throne reads “the perfect goddess”, “Bodily Daughter of Ra”, and “Lady of the Two Lands” meaning ruler of both Upper and Lower Egypt. The nicknames given to her really showed how revered she was by others and the way she influenced society at that time.\n\nHatshepsut, also known as the first female pharaoh to obtain full power and one of the most successful rulers of ancient Egypt. Hatshepsut accomplished many things during her reign. She successfully re-established trade routes and construction projects. She also had a successful military career and claims she fought alongside soldiers in battle. Thus making Hatshepsut one of the most successful rulers in ancient Egyptian history.\n\nA woman becoming Pharaoh had been almost unheard of in ancient Egypt until Hatshepsut was born. Hatshepsut was the second daughter of the pharaoh, Thothmes I. After her sister, Neferu-khebit, died, Hatshepsut was the next heir to the throne unless a male married her and became Pharaoh. After Thothmes passed away, Hatshepsut fearfully, yet confidently, claimed the throne and commenced one of the most successful She-Pharaoh reigns ever recorded. Pauline Gedge’s Child of the Morning explained the social, political, economic, and cultural aspects of ancient Egypt’s society during Hatshepsut’s reign as Queen and Pharaoh.\n\nTausert was one of the few queens who ruled Egypt as pharaoh. She was the second wife of Seti II. It was Seti II that ordered her tomb to be built. This was an honor given to very few queens. She was the last ruler of Dynasty 19.

She had three sisters Cleopatra VI, Berenice IV, Arsinoe IV two of them were older than her and one younger, and two younger brothers named Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV too. Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII inherited the kingdom of their father as it was written his will. Because of the law in Egypt of that time Cleopatra was unable to rule by her own without the presence of a male coruler, a brother or son. As a result she ruled together with her brother who she get married to although he was only twelve years old.\n\nQueen Merytnit of the first dynasty was most likely the first woman to rule Egypt, unfortunately however, her name is nowhere to be found in any of the surviving king lists. “Although the textual support for her rule may be scanty, the archaeological evidence is plentiful.
