        "text": "Queen Tiye of ancient Egypt was more than just a royal consort. She was a woman of remarkable influence and intelligence, wielding immense power during the reigns of both her husband, Pharaoh Amenhotep III, and her son, Pharaoh Akhenaten. Born around 1398 BC, she entered into marriage with Amenhotep III at the tender age of eleven or twelve, and her impact on Egyptian history and politics would be felt for decades to come.\n\nTiye’s significance lies not only in her royal lineage, but also in her remarkable abilities and strong personality. She was not content to simply be a decorative figure in the royal court; instead, she became her husband’s trusted adviser and confidant. Known for her intelligence and assertiveness, Tiye gained the respect of foreign dignitaries, with foreign leaders willing to deal directly with her. Her influence extended beyond the borders of Egypt, as evidenced by her correspondence with foreign kings such as Tushratta of Mitanni and Kadashman-Enlil I of Babylon. She was the first Egyptian queen to have her name recorded on official acts, a testament to her unprecedented impact on the political landscape of her time.\n\nEven after the death of Amenhotep III, Tiye’s influence did not wane. She continued to be mentioned in the Amarna letters and in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king, demonstrating the enduring legacy of her power and influence. Some scholars suggest that she may have continued to advise her son, Akhenaten, when he ascended the throne, a testament to her enduring influence within the royal family.\n\nTiye’s death, believed to have occurred shortly after the twelfth year of Akhenaten’s reign, marked the end of an era. Her passing was not only a personal loss for her family, but also signified the conclusion of an unparalleled chapter in the history of ancient Egypt. The shrine created for her by Akhenaten, bearing the later form of the Aten’s name, provides tangible evidence of the profound impact she had on the religious and cultural developments of her time.\n\nHer life and legacy offer a glimpse into the often overlooked role of women in ancient Egypt. Tiye, with her wisdom, strength, and political acumen, set a precedent for the influential position that royal women could occupy. Her story continues to fascinate historians and enthusiasts alike, serving as a testament to the enduring power of a remarkable woman who defied convention and left an indelible mark on the ancient world."
