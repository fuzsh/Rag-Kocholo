        "text": "It is true to a signiﬁcant extent that the reign of Egyptian leader, Amenhotep III was one of the most signiﬁcant tenured of all New Kingdom pharaohs. Although individual aspects of Amenhotep III’s rule vary in their own importance, it is undeniable that his reign was extremely signiﬁcant, presiding over an almost unbroken 40 year period of relative stability and prosperity from.\n\nOf most signiﬁcance in Amenhotep III’s reign was his peaceful and diplomatic foreign policy. In stark contrast from both previous and successive pharaohs, Amenhotep III’s foreign policy centred not on waging war, but instead on careful diplomacy. As evidenced through the Amarna Letters, of particular importance was the manner in which Amenhotep III played a noteworthy …show more content…\n\nAlthough the military forays of Amenhotep III’s predecessors had secured Egypt’s borders and left little need for war, Amenhotep III nevertheless sought to prove himself a strong and capable warrior. Thus, the pharaoh commissioned numerous monuments depicting himself as veteran warrior, in spite of the fact that no evidence exists the conﬁrm these campaigns. For instance, a victory tablet discovered in his mortuary temple depicts him driving a chariot while conquering Syrians, despite no evidence existing of any military campaigns taking place there. In another example, a marriage scarab described him as the ‘smiter of the Asiatics’, despite being issued when he was barely a teenager with no evidence of any extensive Asiatic campaign. These depictions are no only uncorroborated by any archeological evidence but further, contradict Amenhotep III’s more conciliatory diplomatic attitude. However, this military propaganda does illustrate the signiﬁcance of Amenhotep III’s reign, highlighting a certain shrewdness in being able to anticipate public desire for a well-seasoned military leader and an ability to mould public perception around this. Thus, the signiﬁcance of Amenhotep III’s reign via his policy of systematic military propaganda is clearly …show more content…\n\nReferred to as the ‘Great Royal Wife’ by Amenhotep III himself, Tiye actively participated in Egypt’s administration alongside her husband. This occurred despite running counter to the orthodoxy of the time which emphasised women’s role as one that was largely relegated to domestic duties. As Hurley suggests, ‘The notion that Amenhotep was willing to discard such entrenched tradition showcases the trust and importance he placed in his wife…’ Nevertheless, Tiye was especially proliﬁc in foreign affairs, with rulers of vassal states often addressing their messages directly to her. As the Amarna Letters indicate, Tiye was afforded great respect by foreign leaders, exempliﬁed by King Tushratta of Mitanni, who wrote to Tiye upon Amenhotep III’s death, requesting that warm relations be continued. Tiye was so well-respect that Amenhotep III even constructed a mortuary temple purely and utterly for Tiye at Soleb in Nubia. Hence, the preeminence of Queen Tiye as a women of unique importance underscores the importance of Amenhotep III’s rule.\n\nIn essence, it is abundantly clear that the reign of Amenhotep III was an immensely consequential period for New Kingdom Egypt. Over his many decades in power, Amenhotep III oversaw a prosperous and stable Egyptian society; an empire that was enjoying unprecedented growth and peace during a signiﬁcant"
