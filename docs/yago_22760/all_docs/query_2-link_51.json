        "text": "Was it possible to see simple love in ancient Royal families of the Great Egypt?\n\nIt seems so ...\n\nAmenhotep III Nebmaatre begun pharaoh in a very pleasant moment of the history of the country. Peace and prosperity were the base on which to build a great kingdom for a great pharaoh.\n\nHis domain begun in around 1400 b.c. Some calculations say 1387-88 b.c., the most known, but researchers like Gardiner and Hayes indicate a date before of 1400 b.c.\n\nNote about the personage: Amenhotep III was an orphan when he was very young.\n\nAlso about the accurate determination of the duration of his kingdom there are some troubles. Anyway in this topic I will talk about the tale of the couple as we are able to revive it from documents and finds.\n\nDuring the first years of his reign the administration issued a series of scarabs with a lot of details. They were issued in great quantity, 5 issues, until the year 11 of the kingdom of Amenhotep III.\n\nThey were bulletins of information and news. The 2nd series tells how the young pharaoh killed 94 wind bulls in the Fayum region during a hunting organized by his protector Hekhernekhekh. This series is basilar for the subject of this topic. It mentions Tiye already as the Great Royal Wife. There is an other series which begins just with the marriage of the couple.\n\nThe annunciation was \"The Great Royal Wife Tiye, may she be given the life. The name of her father is Yuya, the name of her mother is Thuya. She is wife of a strong king, his southern borderline is Karoi, the northern one at Naharina\"\n\nTiye â€“ the titles and the love\n\nResearchers have interpreted the titles attributed to the Queen on statues and walls also at the pure real feeling of the husband.\n\nIn the Museum of Hildesheim, in Germany, you can read, on the base of a wooden statue of the Queen, this title:\n\n\"Hereditary Princess, great in prais, .... of the Two Lands, tender in feelings, sweetly lovable, .... of the North and of the South, rich in wonders, delicious in ornaments, Great Royal Wife Tiye, may she be given the life. \"\n\nWas it love?\n\nOr tradition. The Pharaohs and their Queens had titles passed on from generation to generation. Example: .... of the Two Lands, Great Royal Wife ______, etc. etc. It's late, and I can't think of any hard evidence off the top of my head, but such titles were customary. They were used of both Tuthmosis the First and Second, as well as Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten). You can check out this book: William Murane. Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995. 20-21. It has some inscriptions from the time of Amenhotep III and a little earlier, if memory serves me correctly. Hope it helps a little."
