Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye got married in the second year Amenhotep III came to the throne, and she lived long after him as a powerful Queen and mother of the King.

Queen Tiye was almost an equal to her husband, King Amenhotep III, that her name was signed on the official documents, even that of his marriage to different women.

The era of their rule is the most documented in ancient Egypt; they even built 250 monuments they made sure their names were carved into history.
