        "text": "Winter 2011, Vol. 43, No. 4\n\nBy Lopez Matthews, Zachary Dabbs, and Eliza Mbughuni\n\nThe Japanese navy's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941, is etched in the memories of generations of Americans. The story has been told many times in print and on film.\n\nSeventy years ago, even as Japan's envoys to Washington were receiving last-minute instructions from Tokyo for their meeting with the U.S. secretary of state, Japanese aircraft carriers and battleships stealthily moved into position in the Pacific northwest of Hawaii.\n\nMost of the U.S. battleships in the Pacific were in port at Pearl Harbor, and U.S. fighter planes were clustered together on their airfield—making easy targets for an enemy. American soldiers and sailors had enjoyed another peaceful Saturday night, and early risers were waking up to a sunny Sunday morning.\n\nA sighting of unidentified planes by radar station operators minutes before the attack was discounted by an officer at the command center headquarters, squandering time that could have been used to prepare defenses. Suddenly, planes bearing the red sun swept in, and the bombing began. Before the day was over, 2,403 Americans were dead, and our Pacific Fleet was in ruins.\n\nEven in this time of crisis, however, records were being created on board the ships docked in Pearl Harbor—records that are now part of the holdings of the National Archives. These are firsthand accounts from the logbooks of the U.S. Navy's ships and stations compiled from 1941 to 1978. And they provide some insight into the events of the day—before, during, and after the attack— through the eyes of those who witnessed it.\n\nThe day—the one that President Franklin D. Roosevelt said would \"live in infamy\"—started out routinely, as the deck logs show. To maintain an accurate description of events as they happened, the assigned officer placed entries into the log every four hours. The intervals are found at the beginning of each entry as seen in the excerpts below. For instance, before the first entry from each ship you will see the number 4–8 or a variation thereof. This represents the time period from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.\n\nNavy ship deck logs are the \"running record\" of all events that occur aboard a naval vessel. Deck logs were, and are, kept for both legal and administrative reasons. Generally, the deck logs document a ship's movements and encounters along with the accidents, injuries, deaths, disciplinary actions, and provisions of her crew.\n\nIn addition, the names of the ship crew members were also included in the logs when mustered in or when charged with a crime. The vast majority of these entries document routine functions carried out aboard a ship, yet those entered at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, also capture elements of the shock and confusion brought by the Japanese attack.\n\nOn the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, the logs begin with routine entries, noting the reception and inspection of provisions. The USS Chew, USS Conyngham, USS Cummings, and USS Maryland were loading provisions, mostly ice cream, milk, and ice. The Chew received 10 gallons of milk and 4½ gallons of ice cream; the Conyngham received 6 gallons of ice cream; the Cummings received 15 gallons of milk and 7 gallons of ice cream; and the Maryland received 2,000 pounds of ice.\n\nAt around 7:55 a.m., crew members of the Conyngham reported an attack by Japanese planes and had to conduct emergency repairs on the main engines. By 8:08 a.m., crew members had opened fire on the Japanese planes, using all of their machine guns. The deck log reports that they shot down at least three enemy planes. A cease-fire was reported at 11:04 a.m., and between noon and 4 p.m., crew members of the Conyngham rescued their comrades whose ships were destroyed, pulling more than 30 people from the waters.\n\nAlthough heavily damaged, the USS Maryland was also active in the rescue efforts. The ship was able to rescue 25 survivors from the USS Oklahoma, transferring some to the USS Solace. Meanwhile, the USS California was nearly destroyed, and its crew was ordered to evacuate as burning fuel oil on the surface of the water threatened the ship. However, the flaming oil slick cleared the ship, and the crew returned to battle mode.\n\nLog entry for the USS Conyngham\n\n4–8\n\nMoored as before. 0630 Received the following provisions for use in general mess, inspected at [sic] to quantity by Lt (jg) J.R.

The USS Maryland received erroneous reports that a group of Japanese troops had parachuted into Barbers Point Naval Air Station and onto the North Shore of Oahu island. In this log, the crew even gave descriptions of the mysterious group, describing them as wearing blue overalls with red emblems.\n\nMany of the logs contained detailed accounts of the damage caused by the attack. In the two-hour attack, the U.S. Pacific Fleet was left nearly in ruins, with 8 battleships, 3 cruisers, and 188 airplanes destroyed. The log of the USS Medusa notes that the USS Utah settled on its port side after being attacked. It also reported ships that were hit by air torpedoes and sank. Many also reported their own success, including the USS Dale, which recorded prominently that the ship was able to shoot down an enemy aircraft. The Maryland reported crew members performing several diving efforts to repair damaged parts to save the ship.\n\nLog Entry for the USS Maryland\n\n04–08\n\nMoored as before. 0640 Received aboard from Oahu Ice and Cold Storage Co., of Honolulu, T.H. 2000lbs. of ice for use in ships ice boxes. 0750 Japanese planes commenced bombing attack on yard.

Radel\n\nEnsign, U.S. Navy\n\nOne thing missing from the logs, are the many acts of heroism that reflect the spirit of patriotism among nearly all who served the military during this period. One sure example of heroism missing from the logs is that of Cook Third Class Doris \"Dorie\" Miller, assigned to the USS West Virginia. Like many of the African Americans who joined the Navy, Miller was stationed in a position where he would never engage in a combat situation.\n\nHowever, during the attack, Miller became more than just a cook. After retrieving his ship's mortally wounded captain, Miller manned a 50-caliber Browning antiaircraft machine gun. Miller fired at the Japanese planes until he was ordered to abandon ship. The inexperienced Miller shot down between four and six Japanese planes. For his efforts, Miller was awarded the Navy Cross, becoming the first African American to receive that citation. Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, the commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, personally presented the award to him.\n\nFollowing the devastating attack, Congress declared war on Japan, bringing America officially into World War II. All of the Pearl Harbor battleships save three, the USS Arizona, the USS Oklahoma, and the USS Utah, were raised, rebuilt, and put back into service during the war.\n\nLog Entry of the USS Chew\n\n4 to 8.\n\nMoored as before.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was one of those rare galvanizing events that united the nation behind a single cause. Such an episode was not to be repeated in American history until the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nThrough these entries drawn from deck logs—created as routine administrative documents—modern readers can get a sense of the shock, surprise, and confusion felt by the soldiers and sailors who experienced this pivotal moment in American history firsthand.\n\nThe authors, members of the Holdings Management Division, were part of the team that processed Navy Deck Logs, 1941–1979, between October 2009 and October 2010 at the National Archives at College Park.\n\nLopez D. Matthews, Jr., joined the National Archives and Records Administration in 2009. He earned his bachelor's degree in history from Coppin State University in 2004, a masters degree in public history in 2006, and his Ph.D. in U.S. history from Howard University in 2009.\n\nZachary Dabbs joined the National Archives and Records Administration in 2009. He received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2007 and earned a masters degree from New York University's archival management program in 2009.\n\nEliza Mbughuni joined the National Archives and Records Administration in 2008 as a student while working for a masters degree at the University of Maryland College, College Park. She received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2004.\n\nNote on Sources\n\nThe deck logs of vessels at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, are part of the Records of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, Record Group 24. The records are located at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in College Park, Maryland, in the Modern Military Branch. Logs included in this article were from the following ships: USS Chew (DD-106), USS Conyngham (DD-371), USS Cummings (DD-365), USS Dale (DD-353), USS Maryland (BB-46), USS Medusa (AR-1), and USS California (BB-44).\n\nEvery effort has been made to produce a faithful transcript by retaining the capitalization, punctuation, and overall structure of the document. However in order to preserve space and improve readability the authors have silently corrected spelling errors and have omitted long technical descriptions and long lists of names.\n\nIn addition to the deck logs, the authors consulted Alan Brinkley, The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People, 6th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009); Lawrence Dunbar Reddick, \"The Negro in the United States Navy During World War II,\" Journal of Negro History 32 (April 1947): 204; and the Naval History and Heritage Command web site (www.history.navy.mil).\n\nArticles published in Prologue do not necessarily represent the views of NARA or of any other agency of the United States Government."
