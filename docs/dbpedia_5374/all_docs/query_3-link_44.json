        "text": "State Dining Room\n\n2:24 P.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon.\n\nYou know, there are moments in this life — and I mean this literally — when the pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world.\n\nThe people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend. The bloody hands of the terrorist organization Hamas — a group whose stated purpose for being is to kill Jews.\n\nThis was an act of sheer evil.\n\nMore than 1,000 civilians slaughtered — not just killed, slaughtered — in Israel. Among them, at least 14 American citizens killed.\n\nParents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children.\n\nStomach-turning reports of being — babies being killed.\n\nEntire families slain.\n\nYoung people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace — to celebrate peace.\n\nWomen raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies.\n\nFamilies hid their fear for hours and hours, desperately trying to keep their children quiet to avoid drawing attention.\n\nAnd thousands of wounded, alive but carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds and the memory of what they endured.\n\nYou all know these traumas never go away.\n\nThere are still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones, not knowing if they’re alive or dead or hostages.\n\nInfants in their mothers’ arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage — hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality.\n\nIt’s abhorrent.\n\nThe brutality of Hamas — this bloodthirstiness — brings to mind the worst — the worst rampages of ISIS.\n\nThis is terrorism.\n\nBut sadly, for the Jewish people, it’s not new.\n\nThis attack has brought to the surface painful memories and the scars left by a millennia of antisemitism and genocide of the Jewish people.\n\nSo, in this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with Israel. We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack.\n\nThere is no justification for terrorism. There is no excuse.\n\nHamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination. Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.\n\nThey use Palestinian civilians as human shields.\n\nHamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price.\n\nThe loss of innocent life is heartbreaking.\n\nLike every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond — indeed has a duty to respond — to these vicious attacks.\n\nI just got off the phone with — the third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I told him if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive, and overwhelming.\n\nWe also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law.\n\nTerrorists purpo- — purposefully target civilians, kill them. We uphold the laws of war — the law of war. It matters. There’s a difference.\n\nToday, Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart. A lot of us know how it feels. It leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family, feeling like you’re being sucked in. The anger, the pain, the sense of hopelessness.\n\nThis is what they mean by a “human tragedy” — an atrocity on an appalling scale.\n\nBut we’re going to s- — continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism.\n\nMy team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this crisis began.\n\nWe’re surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome.\n\nWe’re going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens.\n\nMy administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis. And when Congress returns, we’re going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners.\n\nThis is not about party or politics. This is about the security of our world, the security of the United States of America.\n\nWe now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas.\n\nI’ve directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise the Israeli counterparts on hostage recover- — recovery efforts, because as president I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world.\n\nThe United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence.\n\nThe Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence. And we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed.\n\nLet me say again — to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don’t. Don’t.\n\nOur hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear.\n\nYesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, and the UK to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our united response.\n\nThis comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region.\n\nWe’re also taking steps at home. In cities across the United States of America, police departments have stepped up security around centers for — of Jewish life.\n\nAnd the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks.\n\nThis is a moment for the United States to come together, to grieve with those who are mourning.\n\nLet’s be real clear: There is no place for hate in America — not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody. We reject — we reject — what we reject is terrorism. We condemn the indiscriminate evil, just as we’ve always done.\n\nThat’s what America stands for.\n\nYou know, just over 50 years ago — I was thinking about it this morning, talking with the Secretary of State, the Vice President in my office and — over 50 years ago, as a young senator, I visited Israel for the first time, as a newly elected senator.\n\nAnd I had a long, long trip — or meeting with Golda Meir in her office just before the Yom Kippur War. And I guess she could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced — they were facing.\n\nWe walked outside in that — that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photos. She looked at me and w- — all of a sudden and said, “Would you like to have a photograph?” And so, I got up and followed her out.\n\nWe were standing there silent, looking at the press. She could tell, I guess, I was concerned. She leaned over and whispered to me — she said, “Don’t worry, Senator Biden. We have a secret weapon here in Israel” — my word this is what she said — “We have no place else to go.” “We have no place else to go.”\n\nFor 75 years, Israel has stood as the ultimate guarantor of security of Jewish people around the world so that the atrocities of the past could never happen again.\n\nAnd let there be no doubt: The United States has Israel’s back.\n\nWe will make sure the Jewish and democratic State of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have. It’s as simple as that."
