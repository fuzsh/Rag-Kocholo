        "text": "Felix E. Feist | The Man Who Cheated Himself | Tomorrow Is Another Day | The Man Behind the Gun\n\nClassic Film and Television Home Page\n\nFelix E. Feist\n\nFelix E. Feist started out doing comedy shorts. Then he graduated to a few features. Finally, the bottom fell out of feature film making for him, and he switched over to directing TV in the 1950's and 1960's. He is a little known director today. I did not at all enjoy his grim film noir about hitchhiking, The Devil Thumbs a Ride (1948).\n\nThe Man Who Cheated Himself\n\nThe Man Who Cheated Himself (1950) is a film noir.\n\nA Semi-Documentary?\n\nThe Man Who Cheated Himself has key features of the semi-documentary crime films of the era:\n\nProtagonists belonging to some elite government institution: in this case the San Francisco Police Department (S. F. P. D.).\n\nTechnology used by the institution: in this case ballistics and police radio.\n\nA finale in a spectacular technical location: in this case Fort Point near the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe above characteristics are documented in detail, for a wide variety of films, at my Chart showing the History of the Semi-Documentary Detective Film.\n\nHowever, the tone of The Man Who Cheated Himself is quite different from most semi-docs. The semi-docs usually glorify their Government heroes. The Man Who Cheated Himself has its lead policeman get corrupted, and try to cover up the crime. And there are no sinister villains, unlike typical semi-docs.\n\nTwo Women\n\nCobb's girlfriend is a rich woman, who has inherited money and doesn't work. She is contrasted with Dall's wife, who works at a job. This working woman is seen as more virtuous than the heiress.\n\nAn Inverted Mystery\n\nThe Man Who Cheated Himself is a standard kind of crime fiction, known as an inverted mystery. In inverted mysteries, first we see the criminal commit the crime, often covering up the events skillfully. Then we see the detective investigate and uncover the villain's scheme. The format goes back at least to \"The Case of Oscar Brodski\" (1910) by R. Austin Freeman. It is most famous in the TV series Columbo.\n\nIn The Man Who Cheated Himself the criminal is played by Lee J. Cobb, the detective by John Dall. Dall's character differs from Columbo's. Unlike Columbo, Dall has no idea of the criminal's identity until the end of the film. And therefore, he is not tormenting or taunting the criminal, the way Columbo does.\n\nThis is Dall's first case as a newly promoted homicide detective. His motive for his enthusiastic pursuit of the case seems to be \"making good\" as a detective. And as a newly married man, he needs the extra pay.\n\nPhilip MacDonald\n\nMystery writer Philip MacDonald contributed to the screenplay.\n\nSuch prose mystery novels by MacDonald as The Rasp (1924) (Chapter 4) and The Link (1930) (last part of Chapter 8) make a big deal about the corpse having been moved to a new location by the killer. The good guy detectives eventually deduce this, from evidence.\n\nSimilar events happen in The Man Who Cheated Himself:\n\nThe corpse is also moved in The Man Who Cheated Himself.\n\nThe film contains a clue that helps detective hero Dall figure out this fact: the blood stains in different directions.\n\nDall is also interested in the timetable of the crime. Such timetables play a role in The Link.\n\nText\n\nThe close-up of the ticket in The Man Who Cheated Himself anticipates the close-up of the identity card in The Man Behind the Gun. Both are small items, that mix printed text with a small addition that is handwritten.\n\nModular Architecture\n\nArchitecture in The Man Who Cheated Himself tends to be composed of repeated small modules:\n\nThe repeated booths at the Art Deco toll gate.\n\nThe rows of repeated windows on the building with the fire escape ladder.\n\nThe modules in Fort Point.\n\nThere are also several windows made up of repeated small panes.\n\nModular architecture occurs in the films of directors Fritz Lang, Edgar G. Ulmer, and Robert Mulligan. See also the \"repeated objects\" in the films of Jacques Tourneur.\n\nOdd Architecture\n\nThe outside entrance to the heroine's apartment looks like a small drawbridge. Inside the apartment is entered through an upper level, and a staircase leading down to the main floor.\n\nThe husband's revolving closet is an unusual feature too.\n\nCostumes\n\nJohn Dall's suit and the end and fancy topcoat are double-breasted, like those of a 1940's film noir hero. They give him glamour. So do his well-shined black leather shoes, which he puts up on his new desk at the start.\n\nBy contrast, the square-looking Lee J. Cobb is in single-breasted clothes. This is a more working class look. It also aligns Cobb to the dull-looking 1950's men styles to come.\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day\n\nThe title Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951) always evokes a film noir in which Scarlet O'Hara tracks down hired killers in the back alleys of Atlanta. Unfortunately, no such film exists, although it might be fun... Instead, the real film Tomorrow Is Another Day seems to have no connection with Margaret Mitchell's Civil War novel, Gone With the Wind (1936).\n\nLinks to Stagecoach\n\nThe young hero of Tomorrow Is Another Day has just been let out of prison after serving a long term for murder, a murder he committed while in his teens. In this he resembles the hero of John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), the Ringo Kid. Both are young men who have had almost no real experience of the adult world. Although they look grown-up physically, neither has actually lived in society as a grown-up. Both are underdeveloped people with little experience in the ways of the world. Both are outsiders in the often corrupt society around them.\n\nHowever, Tomorrow Is Another Day is a film noir that takes place in modern times, while Stagecoach is a Western. The Ringo Kid at least had plenty of ranching skills that would help him survive in the society of his day, while the young hero of Tomorrow Is Another Day is really lost at all levels.\n\nA later Western TV episode has a similar premise: The Evil That Men Do (Stuart Heisler, 1963), an episode of The Virginian TV series. This is an outstanding work.\n\nChild Abuse\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day deals with an issue that has gained in political prominence over the years. While still a child, the hero killed his father, a man who physically abused both his wife and children. Today there would be more sympathy for what this kid did. In the 1950's, abuse was not seen as a political issue. The young man is treated as a murderer, pure and simple. He is sentenced to a long prison term, and when he gets out, his status as an ex-con keeps him from getting a job. Tomorrow Is Another Day does not explicitly make child abuse a political issue, either. Yet it shows it as a major life experience for people, at a time in the 1950's when the subject was rarely discussed in public.\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day also violates what many people believe to be the norm of 1950's entertainment: that families were always happy and untroubled in Hollywood film and television. It is clearly a glaring counterexample to this idea.\n\nMirrors\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day features that staple of film noir, mirrors:\n\nThe warden has a mire behind his desk. The hero is seen exiting the warden's office in this mirror.\n\nThe hero is seen in the rear-view mirror in a car.\n\nA mirror is in the hat shop window.\n\nSuch mirror shots help give Tomorrow Is Another Day a film noir feel.\n\nCar Culture\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day shows car culture:\n\nThe hero experiments with high tech windows on a car, after his release from prison.\n\nA truck carrying numerous cars offers refuge to the hero. This enables some complex shots.\n\nThe Man Who Cheated Himself is also full of shots of characters in their cars. It shows a toll booth, where drivers have to stop and pay tolls.\n\nLinks to The Man Who Cheated Himself\n\nTomorrow Is Another Day shares features with Feist's The Man Who Cheated Himself:\n\nHeroes entering the adult world. In The Man Who Cheated Himself, Dall is getting married and starting his first case as a homicide detective.\n\nA woman who somewhat inadvertently kills a man, getting the hero in trouble.\n\nDull looking offices for civic authorities: the warden here, the cops in The Man Who Cheated Himself.\n\nA watch tower at the prison recalls the fort in The Man Who Cheated Himself.\n\nA hero getting tailed by a tough man in a car.\n\nDeep focus shots through car windows.\n\nThe Man Behind the Gun\n\nComplex Plot\n\nThe Man Behind the Gun (1952) has one of the most complex plots of any 1950's Western. In fact, the less you know about the plot, the more enjoyable the film might be. One of its chief pleasures is watching its endlessly complex plot unfold.\n\nThe film mixes the personal with the political: both the personal relationships of the characters are important, as well as their connection to the political drama in which they are caught.\n\nThe title The Man Behind the Gun has little relationship to the movie. It is a generic Western title that could have been slapped on any film.\n\nFamily Life: the Dark Side\n\nThe Man Behind the Gun shows skepticism about family life, again. The relation of the heroine to her boyfriend is troubled, as is the relationship between the Senator and his sister.\n\nLos Angeles in the 1850's\n\nThe setting of The Man Behind the Gun is unusual: Los Angeles in the 1850's. Los Angeles is already a well-developed city by this time, but one drastically different from today's metropolis.\n\nMost Westerns take place in a sort of never-never land. They might describe themselves as being set in Dodge City or Cheyenne, but little attempt is made to relate these places to the modern cities of the same name. These cities are just abstract Western towns, which could be given any name.\n\nBy contrast, the Los Angeles of this movie is recognizably both similar to and different from the city of today. The geography is the same, the all important issue of water rights is the same.\n\nBut the city also has an entirely different look and feel from today's city. The sets also do not look like the generic \"Western town\" sets of so many movies. Instead, they have a Spanish feel, crossed with an Old West look. They also look extremely prosperous and bustling. Many Western towns in the movies have a \"primitive\" look; but LA here looks sophisticated, even glamorous, and fairly well developed and booming. This makes this film as much a historical drama, as it is any sort of Western."
