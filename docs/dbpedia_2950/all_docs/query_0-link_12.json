        "text": "Felix E. Feist (February 28, 1910 - September 2, 1965) was a film and television director born in New York City. Feist was the son of MGM sales executive, Felix F. Fiest (1884â€“1936), and nephew of publishing house magnate, Leo Feist. He was educated at Columbia University. He is probably best remembered today for Deluge (1933), for writing and directing the film noirs The Devil Thumbs a Ride (1947) and The Threat (1949), and helming the second screen version of the Curt Siodmak sci-fi tale Donovan's Brain (1953). He directed Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin in their first significant screen appearances, in the short film Every Sunday. Feist was the adoptive father of noted fantasy author Raymond E. Feist.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Felix E. Feist, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."
