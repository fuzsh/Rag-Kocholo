        "text": "American film director\n\nFelix Ellison Feist ( ; February 28, 1910 – September 2, 1965) was an American film and television director and writer born in New York City. He is probably best remembered for Deluge (1933), for writing and directing the film noirs The Devil Thumbs a Ride (1947) and The Threat (1949), and for helming the second screen version of the Curt Siodmak sci-fi tale Donovan's Brain (1953), which starred Nancy Davis before she became known as Nancy Reagan.\n\nHe directed Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin in their first significant screen appearances, in the 1936 short film Every Sunday.[1]\n\nLife\n\n[edit]\n\nFeist was the son of a MGM sales executive, Felix F. Feist (1884–1936), and nephew of a publishing house magnate, Leo Feist. He was educated at Columbia University. In the late 1920s he found work as a newsreel cameraman, and he was on staff at MGM from 1929 to 1932, directing screen tests and producing one-reel travelogues.[2]\n\nIn 1931, Feist married Dorothy Hart Jacobs.[3] The two met in New York, NY, and traveled to Los Angeles together where Feist began his career with MGM. They had two daughters, Marjory and Jacqueline Ellison.\n\nHis second marriage was to Lisa Howard, a pioneering female journalist and television news anchor, who briefly had an acting career. She appeared in a few of his films such as The Man Who Cheated Himself, Guilty of Treason, and Donovan's Brain. They had a daughter, Fritzi.\n\nIn 1955, he married Lulu Estelle \"Barbara\" Allen, whose son, Raymond, he adopted. Raymond became a fantasy author.[4]\n\nFeist died of cancer on September 2, 1965, at the age of 55. In his obituary, it was reported that he had three sons and three daughters.[5]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Functioned as Director Producer Screenwriter Music Actor 1930 The Sea Bat Yes 1932 Football Footwork Yes 1933 Deluge Yes 1934 My Grandfather's Clock Yes Yes Yes Strikes and Spares Yes MGM's March on in 1934-35 with Metro Goldwyn Mayer: Convention of the Century Yes 1935 Football Teamwork Yes 1936 Every Sunday Yes Hollywood Extra!
