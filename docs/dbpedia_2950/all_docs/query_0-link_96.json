        "text": "Blinded by love, homicide lieutenant Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb, fresh off originating the role of Willy Loman on Broadway in Death of a Salesman) goes to great lengths to cover up a murder. His coquettish girlfriend Lois (Jane Wyatt, best known as the mother in Father Knows Best) has killed her scheming husband before he could bump her off. John Dall (Gun Crazy) co-stars as Ed’s kid brother Andy, a rookie on the force who is determined to break his first big case. These accomplished actors are nearly eclipsed by the incandescent star power of San Francisco and especially the world’s most photographed bridge, the Golden Gate.\n\nIn the hard-boiled film noir tradition, reminiscent of the work of James M. Cain, greed, unstoppable sexual attraction, and betrayal set off a doomed course in which a femme fatale leads a once upstanding citizen down a dark path. The first independent production of Phoenix Films, the company run by Jack M. Warner, son of Warner Bros. Studios mogul Jack L., and a highlight in the lengthy career of director Felix E. Feist (Deluge), The Man Who Cheated Himself \"goes all the way\".\n\nFlicker Alley is excited to present this world-premiere Blu-ray/DVD dual-format edition of The Man Who Cheated Himself, restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive, with support from the Film Noir Foundation and special thanks to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s Charitable Trust (The HFPA Trust). This is the third collaboration between Flicker Alley and the Film Noir Foundation, following the deluxe 2016 home video releases of Too Late for Tears and Woman on the Run—two previously lost highlights of the genre saved from oblivion.\n\nBonus Materials Include:"
