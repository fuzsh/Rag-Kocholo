        "text": "Raymond E. Feist, internationally best-selling author? What a fantasy!\n\nOr so it seemed in the 1970s, when Feist was trying to sell his first novel. His résumé — failed businessman, former car salesman, “Dungeons & Dragons” devotee, unemployed and living in his mother’s El Cajon home — didn’t exactly scream America’s Next Great Writer of Genre Fiction. On paper, he looked like a dud.\n\nUnless that paper was the manuscript of “Magician.” The novel — which The Washington Post’s critic called “totally gripping” — cast a spell with its sorcery, swordplay and promise.\n\nConsider that promise fulfilled. On May 14, the 29th and final installment of Feist’s Riftwar Cycle, hits stores. “Magician’s End” will bring this saga’s page count past 12,000 and its sales over the 20-million-volume mark. “End” is a victory lap for a writer whose yarns about the warring worlds of Midkemia and Kelewan have scaled The New York Times and The Times of London best-seller lists. While none of his works have become movies or lavish TV productions like HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” they inspired two popular video games.\n\nFeist may be the most successful living American fantasy writer who isn’t named “George R.R. Martin.”\n\nEven so, he’s no fan of fantasy — in his own life.\n\n“If I’m lucky, really lucky, I’ve got 25 good years left,” said Feist, 67, a divorced father of two who lives in North County’s Del Sur neighborhood. “You get to a place in your life where you have a lot more yesterdays than tomorrows, you have to stop thinking about fantasy futures and have to start thinking about making the most of now.”\n\nGame of Unknowns\n\nAs a boy, Ray devoured books by Robert Louis Stevenson, H. Rider Haggard, Rafael Sabatini and other masters of hairbreadth escapes and cliffhanger plots. Years later, when asked why he wrote fantasy, he replied, “Because no one writes boys’ adventures any more.”\n\nFull of fateful twists, his own boyhood reads like fiction. He was born in Los Angeles as Raymond Elias Gonzalez III, the son of a professional musician. But his father died when Ray was a youngster of 4 and his brother just a toddler. Five years later, their mother married a scriptwriter and director.\n\n“I remember my father picking me up and I remember his laugh,” Feist said. “But it was our stepdad who raised us.”\n\nFelix E. Feist was a jack-of-all-Hollywood-trades, working on everything from film noirs to science-fiction. He directed the 1953 movie, “Donovan’s Brain,” and episodes of television’s “Outer Limits” and “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.” Cancer cut short his life and career. He died at the age of 55, leaving his 19-year-old stepson a small inheritance.\n\nDropping out of college, Ray bought a photography studio in the San Fernando Valley. He had a good eye, but lacked a more critical quality: business savvy. When the shop failed, Ray sold cars, peddled products door-to-door and threw himself into a passionate but ill-advised love affair, “a real meatgrinder of an emotional relationship.”\n\nIn 1971, at the age of 26, he returned to school. Living in East County with his mother, Barbara Feist, he completed a year at Grossmont College, then transferred to UC San Diego. One day on campus, the communications major saw several students playing a game with polyhedron dice. He stopped, and his destiny was sealed.\n\nRay joined this group’s regular sessions of “Dungeons & Dragons,” an intricate role-playing game. His new friends had created a planet for their adventures: Midkemia. They also introduced aliens that invaded Midkemia, infiltrating via a tear in the fabric of space and time, the Rift — elements that would become the backdrop to Feist’s 29-book cycle.\n\n“The game actually takes place about 600 years after Ray’s books,” said Steve Abrams, who met Feist when both were UC San Diego gamers. “We suggested that he could write the history of this world.”\n\nUpon that suggestion, Feist built a career. His fellow Triton Wargaming Society members graduated from UC San Diego, found jobs, acquired real-world responsibilities. “Dungeons & Dragons” lost its central place in their lives.\n\nBut it never completely disappeared.\n\n“Everyone is getting old and busy,” Abrams noted. “But we still occasionally play.”\n\nNo worries\n\nFeist owed his “D&D” friends — literally. His first job out of college, marketing a government-funded health project, vanished in the post-Prop. 13 budget cuts. Feist, who had been moonlighting on a novel-length adventure, was tempted to shelve the manuscript and focus on job-hunting.\n\nBut his friends enjoyed the chapters that Feist shared with them. To keep him writing, they loaned him money.\n\n“I’ve since paid them back, several times,” he said. “But they subsidized me for three months, chipping in $200, $300 each.”\n\nHis luck continued when he caught the attention of Harold Matson, a book agent whose clients ran the literary gamut from Waugh, Evelyn, to Wouk, Herman. No fan of fantasy, Matson nonetheless fell for “Magician’s” breakneck pace and intriguing characters. He won Feist a $10,000 advance and, after “Magician” debuted with good sales, a $50,000 advance for his next two books.\n\nEver since, Feist has averaged a book a year, only one of them — “Faerie Tale” — unconnected to the Riftwars. He works quickly, enjoying the yarn-spinning process, juggling a hundred plot strands and a thousand characters. He’s been rewarded with a passionate army of readers — occasionally, too passionate. While he teamed with co-authors on six of the novels, Feist angered some readers by discouraging them from writing and sharing their own “fan fiction” about his imaginary universe.\n\nMidkemia is reminiscent of Westeros, the mythical setting of George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” and the HBO series based on that epic, “Game of Thrones.” Feist has been approached several times by Hollywood, proposing something similar for his work. “I take meetings all the time,” he said.\n\nNothing’s come of these talks, yet, but the author’s not worried: “It took, what, 30 years to get ‘Lord of the Rings’ to the screen?”\n\nWith his books in print in 25 languages, Feist can indulge in the hobbies of the rich and famous — fine wine, beautiful horses, Chargers season tickets. Still, friends say he is unspoiled by success.\n\n“He’s changed very little, if any,” said Abrams, 62, now a computer scientist for a defense contractor. “He’s pretty much the same guy I knew in the ’70s.”\n\nWith the Riftwar Cycle finally concluded, Feist is starting a new, unrelated project. What’s this one about?\n\n“It’s just like ‘Game of Thrones,’ ” he said, “with show tunes.”\n\npeter.rowe@utsandiego.com • (619) 293-1227 • @peterroweut"
