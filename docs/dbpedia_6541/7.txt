Roc Nation is a global record label founded by Jay Z, and representing some of the biggest artists on the planet. I worked with their team to design a powerful and interactive Command Center that takes center stage at their NYC headquarters and offices in London and Los Angeles.

Displaying up-to-the-minute social statistics, artist conversations and trending content, the massive 9-screen video wall is also an interactive touchscreen, enabling deep dives into conversations and critical business objectives.

A unique Artist-view allows Roc Nation to easily flip specific scenes on their top artists, from Alicia Keys to Mariah Carey, etc.

I was thrilled that Jay Z personally gave glowing feedback on my design.
