        "text": "NEW YORK, March 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Roc Nation, a full-service entertainment company founded by Shawn \"JAY Z\" Carter, announced an innovative new platform, ARRIVE, that will partner with a select group of early stage start-ups by providing them with brand services, business development, advisory and capital to drive growth in their organizations.\n\n\"ARRIVE was created to leverage our experience and resources in building brands, developing consumer facing businesses, managing artists and representing athletes. We've opened that diversified, global range of expertise to a new vertical: entrepreneurs and their early stage businesses\" said Neil Sirni, Head of New Ventures at Roc Nation. ARRIVE also anticipates the launch of a traditional venture fund in order to, among other activities, support existing portfolio companies through their subsequent growth stages.\n\nARRIVE was formed through a collaboration with Primary Venture Partners (\"Primary\") and GlassBridge Asset Management (\"GlassBridge\"). Primary will serve as a venture advisor and GlassBridge, a subsidiary of GlassBridge Enterprises Corp. (NYSE: GLA), will provide institutional and operational support.\n\nPrimary Venture Partners co-founder and General Partner, Ben Sun, said, \"What Roc Nation has built so far is a true testament to their vision, capabilities and willingness to dig in and take their companies to the next level.
