        "text": "Music producer and artist Timbaland signed this week with Roc Nation, the multi-faceted music org founded by fellow artist-producer Jay-Z in 2008.\n\nPosts on both Roc Nation’s website and Jay-Z’s Life + Times blog confirm the signing, with a photo of both artists sitting in a recording studio with the caption: “Roc Nation Welcomes Timbaland To The Family.” At the time of the announcement, it was not made clear what role Timbaland will have at the company — a record label, management company and publishing firm.\n\nTimbaland has previously worked with artists including Missy Elliot, Destiny’s Child, Ludacris and Snoop Dogg. He also produced the majority of tracks on Justin Timberlake’s 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds.\n\nVIDEO: Gwyneth Paltrow Dancing at Jay-Z Concert Captures Internet’s Attention\n\nAs for Jay-Z and Timbaland collaborations, the two can trace their past to 1998, when Tim produced two tracks on Jay-Z’s album Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life. From there, he’s been a producer on four of Jay-Z’s last eight albums.\n\nThe headline on the photo that was run on the Life + Times website reads, “And I Won’t Surrender It With Beats By TIMBALAND,” lyrics from a Jay-Z rapped, Timbaland-produced track titled Hola’ Hovito.\n\nThe two artists’ most recent collaboration was with Timberlake on his new single, “Suit & Tie.”"
