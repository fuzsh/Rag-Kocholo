        "text": "Victor Kwesi Mensah, better known by his stage name Vic Mensa, is an esteemed American hip-hop recording artist and record producer from Chicago, Illinois. He has made his mark in the industry through his collaborations with high-profile artists, including Kanye West, Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams, Pusha T, Wyclef Jean, and Skrillex.\n\nBorn to an African father from Ghana and a Caucasian mother, Mensa developed an interest in rap and hip-hop music in fifth grade. Despite early distractions, his musical aspirations overtook him, leading him to the successful career he has today. Celebrated for his artistry, Mensa has been recognized by The Dean's List as one of the Top 25 Artists of 2013 and was featured in Forbes' list of Hip-Hop's Future Moguls in 2018.\n\nAfter the break-up of his first band, Kids These Days, in 2013, Mensa pursued a solo career, releasing his debut solo project titled \"Straight Up.\" This was followed by the mixtape \"INNANETAPE,\" which was downloaded over 35,000 times in the first month after its release. Mensa has since released multiple successful works, including his debut studio album, \"The Autobiography,\" in July 2017, which debuted at #27 on the US Billboard 200 chart. His second album, \"Victor,\" was released in September 2023, demonstrating his ongoing dynamic presence in the music scene.\n\nMensa was signed to Roc Nation in 2015 and has worked with several music labels, including Virgin EMI Records, Def Jam Recordings, and Capitol Records. His contributions to the music industry have been recognized with nominations for mtvU Woodie Awards, NAACP Image Awards, and a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Song at the 58th Grammy Awards. Beyond his music, Mensa has made his acting debut in the TIFF film \"Akilla's Escape\" in 2020, showcasing his diverse talents.\n\nThe founder of the hip-hop collective Savemoney and the SavemoneySavelife Foundation, Mensa uses his platform for political activism and charitable efforts. He has been especially vocal about issues such as gun violence in Chicago and mental health, working tirelessly to foster sustainable change in these areas. In 2024, Mensa collaborated with his cannabis brand 93 Boys and The Delta in Chicago to initiate the Feed the Block / Warm the Block program, a community support program to provide high-quality meals and winter apparel to the local unhoused population throughout the winter."
