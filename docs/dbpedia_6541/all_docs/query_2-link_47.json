        "text": "Infinity’s Song is a sibling band and music collective formed in 2014 in New York City. In the beginning, the group was comprised of Victory, Abraham, and Angel Boyd, performing simple songs with just acoustic guitar and their voices. Younger siblings Israel and Thalia “Momo” Boyd, later joined the group and significantly added to the band’s rich intricate harmonies. Raised by parents who were musicians themselves, the siblings grew up in a home where musical and creative expression was fostered and encouraged at a young age. Infinity’s Song members are not only singers but also songwriters, arrangers, instrumentalists, and music producers.\n\nSince its formation Infinity’s Song has consistently performed around NYC, cultivating a grassroots fanbase through pop up street performances in Central Park and the NYC subway stations. Singing on stages both small and great, the group has toured the U.S., been featured on National Television (NBC’sThe Today Show and ABC’s The View), and frequently collaborates with other musical acts, most recently Kanye West, Jon Batiste, Tori Kelly and more. In the summer of 2015, the group released their first EP and in the fall of 2016 were officially signed to RocNation records by Jay Z.\n\n​\n\nThe group is set to release their debut album in the spring of 2020.\n\nAbraham Victor Boyd is a 27-year-old singer, songwriter, and producer. He began singing when he was 5 years old and considers himself a crooner through and through. He is one of five members of the sibling band, Infinity’s Song. Abraham takes after and studies artists like Sam Cooke, Donny Hathaway, Frank Sinatra, and Nat King Cole.\n\nAbraham loves art of all kinds including theater, visual art, movies, and music. He has a wide-ranging taste in music starting with the late 60s and early 70s - which the singer considers one of the most remarkable times in music - and includes legends like The Stylistics, The Beegees, Marvin Gaye, and Nina Simone. Then there’s Gospel music including greats like Kirk Franklin, The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Andre Crouch. He loves Rock music as well including artists like Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith, Radiohead, and Coldplay. And last but not least, he is also a Hip hop fan including artists like Jay Z, Kanye, Travis Scott, and Pharrell Williams. There are so many people that inspire him it’s impossible to boil it down to just a handful. Other interests of his are exploring and researching political topics and historical figures.\n\nAbraham wants to create music that encourages, speaks to and empowers people. At some point in his life, Abraham plans to help create infrastructures that push musicians and artists to discover their dreams, whether that be through artist management and development or through label ownership.\n\nHe is also a very spiritual person and the love of God is his biggest motivation. Abraham wants to discover that love in new and deeper ways every day and to then spread those revelations through music, art, and business to as many people as possible.\n\nVictory is a Detroit-native who has been performing since the young age of four years old. She was raised in a musical family of nine children and two loving parents. Victory’s parents made it their mission to educate her and her siblings in the wonders of music. As a result, she has performed all over the country and on national television. Victory’s music is a fusion between Soul music and Folk Music. Whether Victory is performing classics or original compositions, she has a way of tailoring each song with her voice and guitar to fit her unique style. Some people say that Victory is in the lane of Tracy Chapman, Roberta Flack, and Nina Simone. But beyond those three, Victory brings an entirely new youthful element to the music world, an indescribable spiritual depth mixed with her youthful interpretation of sound influencing her artistic expressions. Moreover, Victory colors a lot of her musical arrangements with rich jazz chords as she is rooted and grounded in Jazz tradition.\n\nAngel Marie Boyd is a 23-year-old singer, songwriter, and creative director. She began singing at four years old and is one of five members of the sibling band, Infinity’s Song.\n\nOutside of the group Angel spends her time creatively contributing to visual artwork for other artists. Visual presence is such a large part of being a musician in the 21st century, therefore she loves helping artists coordinate their visual brand with their sonic identity.\n\nAngel’s musical inspirations change constantly. Artists like Alice Smith, Solange, Brooke Fraser, Tori Kelly, and Toni Braxton are women whose lyrics, voices and melodies most inspire her. Every day Angel’s ultimate goal is the same - seek God first. She believes that everything else will come and go, but God’s love remains.\n\nIsrael David Boyd is a 22-year-old singer, songwriter, producer, and guitarist. He’s been singing since birth and is one of five members of the sibling band, Infinity’s Song. He considers his vocal style that of a male pop artist.\n\nIsrael has many musical inspirations and people that he admires but would consider his current top 5 favorite artists to be Michael Jackson, Kanye West, John Mayer, Pat Metheny, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. His favorite music genres are hip hop, gospel, pop, classical, and jazz.\n\nIsrael’s interests include dancing, working out and playing sports. He also enjoys reading and playing video games.\n\nHis ultimate goal in music is to be one of the greatest inspirers of all time, and his goal in life is to accomplish God’s ultimate plan for him.\n\nThalia Mozia Boyd, aka Momo, is a 20-year-old singer, songwriter, producer, and instrumentalist. She plays the guitar and the bass, she officially started singing with her family at the age of 5 and is one of five members of the sibling band, Infinity’s Song.\n\nSome people say Momo’s vocal style sounds like Billie Holiday, others say she sounds like Adele, and some say, Nina Simone or Amy Winehouse.\n\n​\n\nMusically, Momo has always looked up to artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Ms. Lauryn Hill, and Donny Hathaway to name a few. In the past few years, she’s really enjoyed listening to artists like Solange, Kendrick Lamar, Pink Floyd, Sly, and the Family Stone, Tyler the Creator, Brandi Carlile, the 70s band \"Bread\", Frank Ocean, Hiatus Kaiyote, and Paramore will always be a favorite.\n\nMomo’s favorite music genres are Soul, Gospel, R&B, Rock, Hip Hop, Jazz, and some Classical. When Momo is not creating music she likes to read, write non-fiction pieces, listen to music that replenishes her spirit, skateboard, study human nature and watch skincare and haircare videos. Outside of music, she wants to write and publish a couple of books in the future.\n\nMomo’s ultimate goal in music is to resonate with as many people in this world as possible and to help them know that they're not alone. It's very easy to feel alone in this world, and from experience, music can be one of the few things that pull you back in and makes you feel like you have an ally. She wants to be that ally for people and to make them feel understood, appreciated and seen most of all.\n\nMomo’s ultimate goal in life is to die free. Free of pain, regret, bitterness and to have lived a life so full that at the end of it all, she is proud."
