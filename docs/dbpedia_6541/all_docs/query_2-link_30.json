        "text": "Did you catch Jay Z on the Grammys? He had the audacity to use the Grammys stage to call out the Grammys while accepting one of the biggest awards of the night. Now I understand being audacious, like Jay Z, I am Brooklyn born and bred. But let's dig deeper into his message. ~‚ÄúSome of you are going to go home tonight and feel like you‚Äôve been robbed.‚Äù ~\"Some of you don‚Äôt belong in the category.‚Äù That last comment got a lot of gasps from the audience, but sometimes the truth is tough to hear. I'm sure many of us have felt like we didn't get our just due. Like we were robbed of the accolades we deserved. If you are a person from a marginalized group, this probably resonated even more. The feeling of having to work twice as hard to get half as far. That is even more frustrating when you see others in the same category, who may have gotten there through social capital above talents. Here's the thing, awards are nice to have. It is always an honor to be recognized, but it cannot be your driving force. You have a duty to share your talents, treasures, and gifts with the world. Winning is a bonus, but should not be the goal. You don't need external validation to be great, give your all, and live your purpose. If the powers that be choose to recognize you, that's a plus. If not, you keep doing what you were put on this earth to do. #diversityequityandinclusion #DEI #BeGreat #Grammys #JayZ\n\nI am going to have a conversation around FAILURE'. 2022 was difficult as it involved a project where I lost over ¬£100,000 and still paying on that. In 2023 I had to postpone the Excellence Awards. It is funny how people will stop at these moments of failure and build a monument of worship there and decide they can define who you are by those moments. At this stage of my life, I know not to spend too much time at these moments. Learn the lessons if you can and move right on. Sometimes the lessons don't even show up at the moment, they come later. I simply know I will not join anyone to build monuments of worship at these places. No never. Let's build monumnets to my successes instead. They are many. They are a mountain. Take a look. Let's worship there and define me by those. I have learned failure has come to teach three things: 1. Not this way, 2: Not yet and 3. Not for you. None of these is a death sentence or a reason to put my head down or slump my shoulders. I look at the Excellence Awards which I had to postpone and yet moving it to January means I now have the first Award Ceremony in the city each year. Yep we enter the new year into the Award Ceremony I created. Second by moving it from October and Black History Month I can enlarge it from the Black Excellence Awards to the Ethnic Diversity Excellence Awards and bring in more people and groups. So my futher lessons from failure; 1. I am brave. Courage is my name. If I think it, I imagine I can and I do it. I will not be stopped by fear of failure or people's opinions the most irrelevant in this equation. Failure builds my confidence that I can, that I dare.. 2. I am God's own. He has me. There is always a reason and it will all work out in the end to my good and His glory. 3. I am becoming the person I need to be, changing, growing, stretching. 4. I will never get to 80 years of age and say 'I wish I had done that' never. Happy Sunday! #unstoppable #fearless #dreamer #doer #failure #winner #noregret #success\n\nHonoring Black History Month üñ§Inspired by JAY Z's powerful Grammy acceptance speech, I'm reminded of the resilience within our community. From unequal opportunities to systemic biases, underrepresented individuals face challenges across industries‚Äîgetting overlooked for promotions and roles, not receiving accolades, even with stolen ideas that they then pass as their own. Jay's words echo the importance of showing up and staying encouraged, even when their actions and words try to tell you that you're not worthy. Keep showing up until they get it right! We love you. We just want you to get it right. It wasn't until witnessing his speech that I found the words I wanted to share this Black History Month. To my fellow trailblazers, keep pushing, keep striving ‚Äì whether it's navigating unequal access, combatting stereotypes, or overcoming the hurdles of being overlooked. Your voice matters, your dreams are valid. Let Jay's success be a testament to the strength that lies within us. In every endeavor, from music to business, we navigate uncharted territories. So, to my community, stay up, stay resilient, and keep breaking barriers. Your journey is part of the rich tapestry of Black history, of American history, of world history, and your success is a beacon of hope for the generations to come. üåü (the opinions expressed within the content are solely the author‚Äôs and do not reflect the opinions and beliefs of any organization that I may be associated with) #BlackHistoryMonth #StayEncouraged #RepresentationMatters #Inspiration #InSolidarity https://lnkd.in/eQRE7eMD"
