        "text": "Known professionally as Jay Z, Shawn Carter is well known rapper originating from a poor and drug infested neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY. Making his debut in rap in the early 21st century, he first got his foot in the door when he featured on Big Daddy Kane's album \"Daddy's Home\" but despite the popularity behind the album he still wasn't able to get signed until he teamed up with two of his friends to form Roc-a-Fella Record Labels in 1995. Since the release of this record label, he was able to distribute his albums and eventually gain the leverage he needed to get in touch with mainstream artist such as Puff Daddy ( aka Sean Diddy Combs) who helped advance his career in rap leading to his songs becoming hits year after year. As he progressed in Rap he soon became one of the most influential Rap artist in history and continued that legacy by passing the torch to the generations after him with Roc Nation."
