        "text": "The metaverse is getting groovier. Justin Bieber, J Balvin, Rihanna, Shawn Mendes and an array of other artists are embracing their avatar likenesses as a result of a new, expanded partnership between Universal Music Group and Genies.\n\nThe agreement expands on earlier digital collaborations between the world’s largest music company and the tech firm, and is hitting as the Internet is abuzz with discourse around Web3, short for Web 3.0, a next-generation, decentralized Internet where services run on blockchain.\n\nGenies is equipping artists on UMG labels including Capitol, Def Jam, Motown, Republic and Roc Nation with official digital identities that will provide a consistent virtual representation of themselves as they engage with fans across gaming, NFT and other realms. UMG’s artists will also have the ability to release exclusive avatar wearables for their fans to collect and use to outfit their own avatars.\n\nActivations are rolling out now.\n\n“In addition to our artists who already created Genies, Republic worked with Kim Petras to release a Genie this week and Interscope recently collaborated with LilHuddy on his,” says Celine Joshua, UMG’s EVP of commercial innovation & artist strategy.\n\nA number of UMG artists have released NFTs with new albums or singles. Kendra Jae, who’s jointly signed to the label 10:22PM and Def Jam, just announced a collaboration with World of Women creator Yam Karkai on a series of NFTs “that will coincide with new music and provide collectors with early access to experiences throughout Kendra’s career,” Joshua says. 10:22PM also recently announced the creation of KINGSHIP, the first metaverse group to consist of NFT avatars.\n\n“Our partnership, structure and ecosystem allows us to scale across the entire global UMG roster,” she adds.\n\nGenies inked a similar deal with Warner Music Group in April. The addition of UMG further signals the commitment of the music industry’s biggest players to embrace the virtual realm well beyond one-off artists with crypto interest—and, at least for the near term, to partner up for metaverse ventures that aren’t in their primary wheelhouse.\n\n“That’s one of the great things about Genies. Our artists will be able to create an avatar that they can use across a growing number of metaverse platforms, creating a single representation of themselves in the metaverse to engage with fans,” Joshua says. “This is a natural progression into the digital universe where they create experiences with their Avatar and wearables that look and feel like a videogame.”\n\nNotes Genies CEO Akash Nigam: \"We’re not bringing culture to NFTs and crypto. Genies and UMG together are bringing the power of NFTs and crypto to culture. This next era of the Internet is about empowering people with more ownership and capabilities.”\n\nAvatars and Web3 provide a more complex canvas for storytelling than in the physical world or current incarnation of the Internet, says Jake Becker, head of talent relations at Genies.\n\n“Why does an artist’s merchandise have to be limited to their album artwork? What did that album mean? What did they want their listeners to know and feel? The big opportunity is not only with the existing fan bases but tapping into much wider global audiences that will connect with these stories and expressive moments so much that they turn into an entirely new group of superfans,” Becker says.\n\n“The Justin Biebers, the Drakes, the Billie Eilishes of Web3 don’t exist yet… the same way the Republics, the Spotifys and the UMGs don’t exist yet either,” he adds. “Now all of those individuals and groups have the opportunity to have that size of brand and impact in Web3, but so do the small developing acts or even the undiscovered talents. The opportunity is there for everyone.”"
