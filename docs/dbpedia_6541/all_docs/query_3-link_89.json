Reardon is a veteran producer and executive who had served as exec VP and co-head of Weinstein Co.’s TV department since 2015.\n\nRoc Nation’s recent TV and film projects include Spike TV’s “Time: The Kalief Browder Story,” which has earned a Peabody award this year, and the upcoming “Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story,” which just premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Both were executive produced by Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter. Future television endeavors include an unscripted series with Amazon.\n\n“Roc Nation is such an influential and dynamic company. I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to work with them as they expand their brand into television,” Reardon said.\n\nPopular on Variety"
