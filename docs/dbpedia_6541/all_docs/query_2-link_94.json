        "text": "Key additions further expand Wasserman Music's accelerating global growth\n\nLeading global talent agency Wasserman Music has announced the addition of four accomplished executives to its worldwide agent team. Josh Dick joins Wasserman Music as a Vice President based in New York; Jonathan Insogna joins as a Vice President based in Nashville; Rebecca Prochnik joins as a Director based in London; and Shay Royale joins as a Director based in New York.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Josh, Jonathan, Rebecca, and Shay to our growing global team of outstanding agents and career strategists,” said Lee Anderson, EVP and Managing Executive, Wasserman Music. “Their unique backgrounds and experience will help to drive Wasserman Music’s accelerating growth across global territories, emerging genres, and innovative new ways to serve our valued clients around the world.”\n\nIn a career that has spanned over 20 years in the music industry, Josh Dick began as a booking agent at The Agency Group, working with artists including A$AP Rocky, Danny Brown and YelaWolf. He then shifted to artist management, where for the last decade he has guided the careers of artists including Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Flatbush Zombies. In addition to management, Dick ran independent record labels for each artist, overseeing four albums that reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart. In his new role, he will continue to represent Flatbush Zombies as their agent for North America, among other artists. A graduate of Binghamton University, Dick has also served as an adjunct professor at Long Island University’s Roc Nation School of Music, Sports and Entertainment.\n\nJonathan Insogna joins Wasserman Music after 17 years at WME, where he represented many prominent Country and Americana artists. His clients at Wasserman Music include Morgan Wade, Yola, Cam Whitcomb, Drew Erwin, Joshua Quimby, Max McNown, and Theo Kandel. He is a member of the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music and served on the Founding Board of Advisors for the To Nashville, With Love Fund, created to help raise vital funds after the devastating March 2020 tornadoes that struck Middle Tennessee. Insogna graduated from the University of Georgia and earned his MBA from Belmont University.\n\nRebecca Prochnik has extensive experience working across the independent music sector, helping to propel numerous underground artists into the broader market. She founded the London-based boutique Earth Agency in 2014, growing it into one of the U.K.’s most successful independent agencies before she joined UTA in 2021. At Wasserman Music, she will represent artists including AJ Tracey, Black Lips, Calibre, CASISDEAD, Decius, Fat Dog, Frost Children, Ghetts, Jme, Kode 9, Mala, Paranoid London, Warmduscher, and others.\n\nGideon “Shay” Royale is a seasoned executive and thought leader in music, entertainment, and technology who began his career as an advisor under the umbrellas of Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, and MJ Capital Partners. He later joined the Global Sports and Entertainment Division at Morgan Stanley to expand their efforts in guiding sports and entertainment professionals through holistic financial planning. He has since worked with music artists as a manager and A&R consultant, most recently leading the indie incubator and artist development company, All Season, where he advised labels, global distributors, and artist teams on growing Afro-music markets worldwide. Royale also co-founded the community-based ticketing platform TBA, a new model created to foster better dialogue between independent artists, creators, and venues through inclusive pricing with offer-based ticketing. At Wasserman Music, he will lead the agency’s growth in the Afro-music space, with clients including Victony, Black Sherif, Gabzy, Blxckie, melvitto and WurlD.
