        "text": "Pop star Kylie Minogue has signed a management deal with Jay-Z's music label Roc Nation.\n\nThe surprise announcement was made on the label's website on Tuesday night.\n\nBased in New York, the company will give Minogue a permanent foothold in the US, where she has never managed to achieve sustained success.\n\nUS trade paper Billboard said a new single from the Australian singer was due \"soon\", after more than a year spent working on her 12th studio album.\n\nMinogue parted company with British label EMI last year, after it was taken over by rival music company Universal.\n\nThe European Commission only approved the takeover on the condition that Universal sold Parlophone, which was also home to Blur and Lily Allen.\n\nIt is understood that Parlophone will continue to release Minogue's music, while Roc Nation will handle her management.\n\nAlthough she has worked with several record labels over her 25-year career, this is the first time the star has changed her management, after amicably parting from fellow Australian Terry Blamey in January.\n\nRoc Nation is also home to Rihanna, Rita Ora, MIA and Calvin Harris - and last week signed hip-hop producer Timbaland.\n\nMinogue and Timbaland will appear on stage together at Roc Nation benefit concert this weekend, following the Grammy Awards."
