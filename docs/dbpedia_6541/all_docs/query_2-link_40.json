        "text": "Jay Electronica is a gifted lyricist on the mic and an entertaining presence outside of the booth.\n\nThe New Orleans rapper starred in a Periscope session last night (February 5) across a series of sessions while in Miami where he shouted out many and took aim at a few.\n\nElect shouted out Lupe Fiasco and Chicago, and spoke about his appreciation for Drake. But the Roc Nation artist had some mixed feelings when it came to Kendrick Lamar. He called the TDE star family, but not before he said he didn’t play his music beyond his collaboration on a record by Gunplay.\n\nThe elusive MC also had some strong words for 50 Cent, calling him a good rapper at one point, however, now he’s worthy of threats and taunts.\n\nWhen asked about his forthcoming, long-delayed debut album, he told viewers his favorite song on the project is an as-yet-titled collaboration with Jay Z."
