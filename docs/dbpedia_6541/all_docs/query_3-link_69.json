According to a release on Monday (March 6), the hip-hop mogul announced the creation of Arrive, a platform that will focus on promising start-up companies.\n\n“Arrive was created to leverage our experience and resources in building brands, developing consumer facing businesses, managing artists and representing athletes. We’ve opened that diversified, global range of expertise to a new vertical: entrepreneurs and their early stage businesses,” said Neil Sirni, Roc Nation’s head of new ventures.\n\nThrough a collaboration with Roc Nation, Primary Venture Partners and Glassbridge Asset Management, Arrive will aid existing portfolio companies through their developmental stages. While teaming up with Glassbridge, Arrive will also provide institutional and operational support.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nPrimary Venture Partners co-founder Ben Sun also expressed his excitement regarding the new partnership with Roc Nation. “What Roc Nation has built so far is a true testament to their vision, capabilities and willingness to dig in and take their companies to the next level.
