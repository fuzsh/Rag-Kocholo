        "text": "üì¢ Insiders! It‚Äôs time for another episode of the ‚ÄòMUBUTV Insider Video Series‚Äô. Join us today as we sit down with our special guest Janine Kerr VP, Fox Sports Promo. ‚ö°Ô∏èWhat you‚Äôll learn in this episode‚ö°Ô∏è üëâ The benefits of having your music used in a sports promo üëâ Some of the most significant changes in the usage of music in sports and promo üëâ and much much more...\n\nLeadership lessons for corporate executives from the world of jazz music: We live in a very fast-changing world. With the intersection of AI and technology in our day-to-day lives being an inexorable event, our management style also needs improvision and change. The world of Jazz gives us a lot of ideas and we can learn from it as the brilliant attached post from Harvard clearly elucidates. I experienced this first-hand when I recently saw Chris Botti live at Dubai Opera. The music was absolutely mesmerizing and took you into a different stratosphere. The improvision of Frank Sinatra‚Äôs epic song - I Got You Under My Skin - was music at its very best. The collaboration between the saxophone, trumpet and the human voice was nothing like I‚Äôve heard before. The beauty of the music was that everyone in the audience were engaged with the musicians on the stage; emotional quotient was at its zenith. Jazz music epitomizes what management techniques we need to imbibe in our new world - ICEEEQ - innovate, collaborate, experiment, engage, emotional quotient. (Credit: Harvard Business School)"
