It's an enticing proposition in an age where artists can't rely on income from record sales alone. With Jay-Z's new multi-million dollar deal with Live Nation, he resigns as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, where he had launched the careers of hot R&B artists like Rihanna and Ne-Yo, and forms Roc Nation. The entertainment company will manage a slew of artists, like Big Sean, Kanye West, Demi Lovato, and Shakira, while also functioning as a record label. One of the first signees to the label is British singer Rita Ora. But some critics warn that a 360 deal takes much more than it gives. Need proof? Look no further than Motown in the '60s, says Panos Panay, CEO of the music platform Sonicbids: \"Motown was the pioneer of a 360° deal... They owned your likeness, your touring, publishing, record royalties, told you what to wear, told you how to walk... It made for great entertainment but if you look at every one of those artists, what happened? Sooner or later they said, 'I’m not going to go on the road for 200 shows because you tell me so. I'm an artist! I'm a creative person!' Eventually all these artists left... There's two things we know about creativity: you can't force it and you can't really control it.\"\n\nCategories\n\nInnovations\n\nLotsa Money\n\nRecord Deals"
