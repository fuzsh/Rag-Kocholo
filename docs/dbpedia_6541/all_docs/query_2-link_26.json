They draw on the city’s collaborative spirit and cultural traditions while reaching beyond its country bent into rock and indie music, among other genres.\n\nAfter a recent resurgence of vinyl record sales, United Record Pressings, which produces a large percentage of all American-made records, is doubling in size. The popular television series Nashville shows off the city and, being filmed locally, helps provide new jobs and attract talent. Rolling Stone has a bureau in the city, Jay Z's Roc Nation management firm has an office there, and even the tech industry is laying down roots in Nashville, with Spotify and a variety of startups borne of the incubator Project Music setting up shop."
