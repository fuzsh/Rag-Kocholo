        "text": "From the infectious club classic “Yeah!” to the nostalgic single “DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love,” Usher’s relevance in pop culture and our childhoods is timeless, in contrast to some public opinion. The news of his upcoming performance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show was announced across the social media accounts of the NFL, Roc Nation, Apple Music and his own Sept. 24 and followed up by a flurry of comments.\n\nSome perceive Usher as outdated and a \"downgrade\" from previous halftime performers to have graced the stage — Prince, Michael Jackson, Dr Dre & friends, Beyonce and Rihanna amongst those highly praised. On the other end of the spectrum, Usher fans and those alike remain enthusiastic about his ability to deliver a lively show enjoyable for all audiences.\n\nSeveral big names, from Los Angeles Lakers player Lebron James to rapper and Roc Nation founder Jay-Z, have expressed their unwavering support for Usher. James reposted ESPN and SportsCenter’s announcement on his Instagram story with the caption, “AYYYYYYEEEEEE Let's Go!”. In a heartfelt statement, Jay-Z said, “Beyond his flawless singing and exceptional choreography, Usher bares his soul. His remarkable journey has propelled him to one of the grandest stages in the world. I can't wait to see the magic.”\n\nSuper Bowl headliners have traditionally derived from the genres of rock and pop, with hip-hop and rap spotlighted for the first time during the 2022 halftime show that featured Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige and 50 Cent. Past R&B halftime performers include Diana Ross, Janet Jackson, Beyonce and Destiny’s Child.\n\nThe 2024 Super Bowl Halftime Show will be Usher's second time on the Super Bowl stage, as he performed his hit song, “OMG,” alongside Will.i.am, who headlined with other members of the hip-hop musical group Black Eyed Peas in 2011. Of course, this year is like no other, with millions tuning in as he joins the brief list of R&B stars to take center stage.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with his path to the Super Bowl LVIII stage, here is a closer look into Usher’s rise to fame.\n\nThe singer's musical background traces back to his youth, where he actively sang in church choirs. By entering talent shows, Usher connected with the mainstream music industry, eventually moving to Atlanta and securing a recording contract with LaFace Records two years later.\n\nAfter its 1994 release, Usher's self-titled first album, Usher, was not considered a commercial success. However, it was followed by his sophomore work My Way in 1997, which instilled his status as one of R&B's brightest. Within this period of his new-found fame, Usher established his dynamic presence beyond buttery smooth vocals through onstage performances as he celebrated his musical success with a world tour."
