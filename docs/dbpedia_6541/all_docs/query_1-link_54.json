        "text": "Track: Tinashe “Nasty” Released: 12 April 2024Label: Nice Life Tinashe’s song “Nasty” has been everywhere in the last few months and is the artist’s highest charting single as a lead artist […]\n\nWith 2023 being the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip-hop, Roc Nation wanted to mark this milestone. Using the idea of the mixtape, they created three separate sneaker designs […]\n\n‘The Harder They Fall’ has just launched on Netflix: a Western film with an all-Black cast, and a buzzy soundtrack.\n\nStartup Sensorium Corporation is preparing to launch its Sensorium Galaxy virtual world – or rather a series of virtual worlds, including some with music as their focus. It’s also persuading music […]\n\nWe’ve been writing about popular children’s gaming platform Roblox for some time, including its desire to work with the music industry. It’s not the only platform of its type.\n\nManticore Games is the company behind Core, which is a similar “digital playground and community designed to unleash imagination and explore new play experiences”.\n\nIt came onto our radar this week with a $15m funding round led by Epic Games – and according to Forbes “the first outside investment that the Fortnite maker has made”.\n\nHere’s a legal question for you: if someone creates a deepfake audio recording of an artist or public figure – for example them reading Hamlet’s ‘To Be Or Not To Be’ […]\n\nBritish music/VR startup MelodyVR has announced its latest licensing deals, with Roc Nation and Roc Nation Publishing.\n\nThe global, multi-year deals will “license the creation and distribution of virtual reality content featuring Roc Nation artists, covering both record label and publishing rights” according to MelodyVR’s announcement for investors this morning.\n\n“As part of the relationship, MelodyVR will receive the right to create and distribute content created with Roc Nation artists for an exclusive period, followed by a period of joint-exploitation by both parties.”\n\nIt shouldn’t be a surprise that Jay Z and Roc Nation are launching a new venture focused on startups: rumours in February suggested that the artist, entrepreneur and Tidal co-owner was launching his own VC fund.\n\nYesterday we found out its name – Arrive – and a little more about what it’s planning to do.\n\nAccording to Roc Nation, Arrive isn’t just about investing. It will “partner with a select group of early stage start-ups by providing them with brand services, business development, advisory and capital to drive growth in their organisations” – so somewhere between a VC fund and a startup incubator / accelerator program.\n\nUniversal Music Group has secured its second deal with the Prince estate in a matter of months.\n\nIn November, Universal Music Publishing Group was revealed as the global administrator of the late star’s publishing catalogue, and now UMG’s Bravado division will handle branding and licensing for Prince.\n\nWhile Amazon’s Echo, Google’s new Home and established firm Sonos tend to get most of the headlines around connected speakers, new models and companies are emerging too. French startup Devialet […]\n\nThe dispute between Tidal and Prince’s estate is stepping up a notch, with NPG Records and NPG Music Publishing filing a lawsuit against Roc Nation for copyright infringement.\n\nThe filing confirms that in August 2015 Prince and Tidal signed a “letter of intent” to grant the latter a 90-day exclusive on his ‘HitnRun: Phase 1’ album, but claims that the plaintiffs “are not aware of any agreements with Roc Nation or Tidal by NPG Records or NPG Publishing other than the Letter of Intent”.\n\nWhat reason could Jay-Z have for visiting Samsung’s US headquarters other than to talk about selling Tidal? Actually, quite a good one: negotiating a $25m sponsorship deal for Roc Nation artist Rihanna.\n\nThe New York Post suggests the meeting that sparked rumours of a Tidal sale to Samsung was more likely focused on Rihanna’s upcoming album and tour."
