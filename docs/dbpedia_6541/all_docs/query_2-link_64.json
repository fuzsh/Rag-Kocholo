        "text": "AD\n\nInfinity Song, the enchanting soft rock band from New York City, has captured the hearts of millions with their celestial harmonies and genre-defying sound. Consisting of four talented siblings – Abraham, Angel, Israel, and Momo Boyd – the group’s journey is a testament to the power of family, dedication, and musical innovation.\n\nRaised in a musical family, their parents homeschooled the Boyd siblings, who founded the Boys & Girls Choirs of Detroit. From a young age, they were immersed in various musical genres, including classical, gospel, and jazz, which would later influence their unique sound.\n\nIn an exclusive HYFIN-verified interview, the band shared insights into their upbringing and artistic vision. “Growing up, it was definitely like the family farm, like the family store,” youngest member Momo reflects. “It was just very much the culture. I personally didn’t even really think about it. It was just what we did.”\n\nThe family’s relocation to New York City in 2006 marked a turning point in their musical journey. The siblings began performing at iconic locations across the city, eventually making Central Park’s Bethesda Fountain their permanent stage for the next 12 years. This period of public performance laid the foundation for their later success, as they honed their craft and developed a loyal fanbase.\n\nInfinity Song’s big break arrived when a video of Victory singing Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” in Central Park caught the attention of Jay-Z. Signed to his label, Roc Nation, in 2016, the band found a supportive environment that encouraged them to stay true to their artistic vision. “It was scary, but at the same time, it felt very welcoming and very warm,” Angel recalls of their first meeting with Jay-Z. “Like, Jay-Z, he had the biggest smile. He had such a warm, like presence.”\n\nSince then, Infinity Song has made waves in the music industry. Their debut album, “Mad Love,” released in 2020, was accompanied by viral videos that garnered millions of views and support from Hollywood celebrities. The band’s latest single, “Haters Anthem,” has reached over 200 million people worldwide and received an endorsement from pop star Doja Cat.\n\nInfinity Song’s music is characterized by tight vocal harmonies, dreamy lyrics, and sublime guitar riffs, creating a transcendent experience for their audience. Abraham explains, “Everything kind of comes from that choral tradition. It was interesting because a lot of it was steeped in classical music and then also merging that with our gospel roots.” This distinctive sound has drawn comparisons to legendary 1970s groups like Fifth Dimension, The Mamas and The Papas, and ABBA..\n\nWith the release of their EP, “Metamorphosis,” Infinity Song continues to solidify their place among the most compelling artists of our time. As they collaborate with award-winning musicians and perform on prestigious stages, the band remains grounded in the values and work ethic instilled by their musical upbringing. Their story is one of passion, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to uplifting others through honest, heartfelt music.\n\nRelated\n\nAD"
