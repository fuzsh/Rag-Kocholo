" * "Strange Hearts" - Written by Liam. Mentioned in a 2008 Q interview. Features the lyrics "Your heart is strange/But your soul is true/There are many things/I would like to say to you". Noel jokes that he intended to sue his brother for copyright infringement.

* "To Love" - Written by Noel and according to studio sources, will feature on the forthcoming album. Heavily orchestral and sung by Noel, this song will confirm the 'collosal' approach for the album with orchestras that Noel had in mind.

* "Gold Fire" - Written by Noel, it has several trumpet solos. Was leaked to the internet in late January 2008."

I take it this is false?

I'd say yes because you can basically write anything on Wiki

Before the release of DBTT, HMV was listing the new oasis album as "The Ear Has No Memory"

All the rumors are contradicting themselves as well.

Each day is getting more and more interesting. For example, a summation of all of the "reports" that have been posted on this forum in the last few days reveals around 25 total songs that are slated to be on the album. I'd say that's one hell of an album.

It's fake if only for the reason that "Gold Fire" - if that song even exists - clearly hasnt been leaked on the internet, because if it was, this forum would be one of the first

At least make up believable shit if you're gonna invest your time. FFS

We need to get Mr. Monobrow or somebody to clean up that Oasis wikipedia page. That garbage on there is stupid.

Edit- somebody did delete that garbage, it's no longer on there. I thought it was funny that it says this about STC:

"Stop the Clocks" - written by Noel. Possibly the most awaited new song by fans due to a number of comments by Noel in 2002 calling it "the greatest song I've ever wrote." Written in 2002 and recorded during sessions for Don't Believe the Truth, but not considered complete enough for release. Noel has since confirmed that the song will definitely be on the record.

Yeah, he has confirmed it through the tennis spies.

I personally do believe STC will be on this album. But you're right, Noel hasnt confirmed it or said anything about the tracklisting whatsoever.

dont like wikipedia, because its taken as being gospel. i could post that Noel has written a song for my daughter on it and someone would read, and believe it! i think it should be monitored to a greater extent (someone should be responsible for ensuring the content is accurate) and not taken as the truth by people that read it.

exactly, in the early days of wikipedia i fell for a few falseys, as i had no idea it could be edited, its not worth checking there now, as most stuff comes through here first, whether its true or not

It is monitored and many articles have sources for their claims.

Of course, with things that involve speculation information should be taken with a (large) grain of salt.

some of them have sources, yes, some don't. that's my point - people read it and take it as gospel, whereas it's not and it's not monitored well enough, imo.

A large majority of them have sources, unless you're looking at really obscure items.

check out the site now, it has been changed. I am going to search the site for other inaccuracies. In the case that I find information that has been proven incorrect I will edit the site. Just Like InspiredCarpet stated, anyone can edit this site. Reliable information about Oasis can be found on Oasisinet.com or the Live4ever newsroom.

I'm the one who deleted all those BS songs our favorite tennis player put up on Wiki, so feel free to do the same...
