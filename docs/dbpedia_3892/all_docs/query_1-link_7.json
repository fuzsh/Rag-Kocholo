Features the lyrics \"Your heart is strange/But your soul is true/There are many things/I would like to say to you\". Noel jokes that he intended to sue his brother for copyright infringement.\n\n* \"To Love\" - Written by Noel and according to studio sources, will feature on the forthcoming album. Heavily orchestral and sung by Noel, this song will confirm the 'collosal' approach for the album with orchestras that Noel had in mind.\n\n* \"Gold Fire\" - Written by Noel, it has several trumpet solos. Was leaked to the internet in late January 2008.\"\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis%27_seventh_studio_album\n\nI take it this is false?\n\ncaro\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nCHILLI DOGS CLUB\n\nPosts: 24,871\n\nPost by caro on\n\nI'd say yes because you can basically write anything on Wiki\n\nBefore the release of DBTT, HMV was listing the new oasis album as \"The Ear Has No Memory\"\n\nAll the rumors are contradicting themselves as well.\n\nPlantpot\n\nOasis Groupie\n\nIt's Just Rock and Roll.\n\nPosts: 769\n\nPost by Plantpot on\n\nEach day is getting more and more interesting. For example, a summation of all of the \"reports\" that have been posted on this forum in the last few days reveals around 25 total songs that are slated to be on the album. I'd say that's one hell of an album.\n\nBeady’s Here Now\n\nOasis Manager\n\nGood evening, Town!\n\nPosts: 34,915\n\nPost by Beady’s Here Now on\n\nIt's fake if only for the reason that \"Gold Fire\" - if that song even exists - clearly hasnt been leaked on the internet, because if it was, this forum would be one of the first\n\nAt least make up believable shit if you're gonna invest your time.

That garbage on there is stupid.\n\nEdit- somebody did delete that garbage, it's no longer on there. I thought it was funny that it says this about STC:\n\n\"Stop the Clocks\" - written by Noel. Possibly the most awaited new song by fans due to a number of comments by Noel in 2002 calling it \"the greatest song I've ever wrote.\" Written in 2002 and recorded during sessions for Don't Believe the Truth, but not considered complete enough for release. Noel has since confirmed that the song will definitely be on the record.\n\nYeah, he has confirmed it through the tennis spies.\n\nBeady’s Here Now\n\nOasis Manager\n\nGood evening, Town!\n\nPosts: 34,915\n\nPost by Beady’s Here Now on\n\nI personally do believe STC will be on this album.
