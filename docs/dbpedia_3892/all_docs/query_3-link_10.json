        "text": "Song form is more valuable than you might think. Don’t make the mistake of underestimating how important awareness of song form can be when you are writing a song.\n\nWhen you’re vibing to those songs that hit the top of the charts, you’ll notice they often have awesome lyrics and melodies you can’t forget. This is even more likely when you think about those all-time greats. But there’s another piece of the puzzle you might not spot right away: the song structure or its form. When songwriters are creating a new track they don’t just throw words and tunes together; they also think about the music genre they’re aiming for and pick a song structure that fits like a glove. This article gives you a rundown of the most common song forms they use.\n\nThis song form overview provides an introduction to song form, commonly used song forms and examples of those song forms being used in popular songs. It provides a basic understanding of the structure and use of common modern song forms. For simplicity, some of the root musical forms or classifications of musical forms have only been referenced rather than explored completely\n\nSong Form describes the structure of songs in an easy to understand framework. When using a song form, letters are assigned to the different sections of a song, where repeated section types are assigned the same letter as was assigned on the first occurrence of that section type. The letters then create a map of the overall song, or the song architecture of the key feature of that type of song. Thinking of song form helps song writers retain an overview of songs and how the sections of music that make up the song are organized.\n\nDerived song forms are often based upon strophic form (AAA song form), 32-bar form (AABA song form), verse-chorus form (AB song form) and 12-bar blues form (AAB song form). Songs with a different melody and chord progression for each stanza, in other words there are no repeated sections (called ‘through composed form’), are far less common in western popular music.\n\nIt should be noted that the meaning of some terms such as “verse” and “chorus” has changed over the years.\n\nSome confusion exists, partly due to changes in terminology over the years, and partly due to one word meaning different things in different contexts, such as what the word means in the context of genre, location and what that word means to different groups of people.\n\n“Chorus” originally derives from the notion of “multiple-voices” singing a particular section of the song, while the name “chorus” is used for music sections where multiple voices sang together. In classical music the massed voices in opera, or massed voices accompanying an orchestra in any setting, is still termed “the chorus”. The second main use of the name “chorus” is the modern understanding of the section of a song called “a chorus”, which may or may not be sung by multiple voices.\n\nRefrain lines can be sung by multiple voices, and using older terminology it is a chorus, in the sense that it can be performed by multiple voices, but can also be sung by a solo voice. However, a refrain is not the chorus section from the verse-chorus song form that we all know and love.\n\nA refrain is part of a verse that is repeated from verse to verse. Commonly the refrain is in the last line of the verse, but it doesn’t need to be. It could just as easily be the first line of the verse or, far less commonly, any other line.\n\nTo make it even more confusing, “the verse” hasn’t always meant what we now understand it to mean. “Verse” used to be the name for a 32 bar introduction, before getting to the main piece of music, which was typically AABA in structure (ie a second 32 bar section).\n\nConflicts in terminology come from a variety of reasons. For example, classical musicians interpreting a term in one way and popular musicians using the term for something different. Or, simply musicians in one area calling a section of music with a name that was already used for another section of music elsewhere. Time passing also brings about change in the meaning of a term as new generations apply the term to something new, or use it in a new, derived way.\n\nWhat do Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’“, The Animal’s “House of the Rising Sun” and Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” all have in common? They all rock the AAA song structure.\n\nStrophic Form is also called AAA Song Form or One-Part Song Form. AAA song form is one of the oldest sectional song forms. It originates in the adaption of poems, with composers setting the poems to music to perform them for the entertainment of the royal courts of Europe.\n\nThis song form is all about different sections or verses (that’s the A part) coming together without a chorus or a bridge in sight. The melody is repeated, in Strophic Song Form, and each time the melody repeats different words are sung to the melody. This makes it an ideal song form for story telling.\n\nAAA form songs are comprised of several verses.\n\nThey often feature a refrain – think of it as a catchy line that gets repeated in the same spot in every verse. The refrain is commonly the title of the song and it is usually included at the end of each verse. Its repetition emphasizes the line, driving it home each time with the same melody.\n\nTo find out the details on AAA Song Form please read our article AAA Song Form.\n\nThe 12-bar form used in the AAB song form is strongly associated with the blues. Many Blues songs are in the AAB format. 12-bar” relates to the number of bars of music, or measures, making up the theme of typical Blues songs. Almost all Blues music is written in a 4/4 time signature, i.e. there are four beats in every measure or bar with each quarter note (crotchet) being equal to one beat.\n\nThe fundamental structure of 12 Bar Blues is three four-bar lines or sub-sections. Often the first two and a half bars of each 4 bar section are vocal melody, while the last one and a half bars contains an instrumental melodic hook that gives a sense of completion for the line.\n\nThe common variants for 12-Bar blues are 8-Bar form and 16-Bar form.\n\nTo find out the details on AAB Song Form please read our article AAB Song Form\n\nCommonly referred to as the American Popular Song Form or Ballad Form, AABA Form structure kicks off with two opening sections or verses (marked as ‘A’), followed by a bridge (‘B’) that contrasts both musically and lyrically with the verses, and wraps up with a final ‘A’ section. Examples of AABA form would be the song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” by Judy Garland, “Yesterday” by The Beatles, and “Georgia On My Mind” by Ray Charles.\n\nThis is one of the most commonly used forms in both jazz and early to mid-twentieth century popular music. The AABA format was the song form of choice for Tin Pan Alley songwriters of American popular music, an East Coast USA songwriter scene based in New York City, in the first half of the 20th century. Tin Pan Alley song writers included song writing greats like Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen, Sammy Cahn, Hoagy Carmichael, Dorothy Fields, Johnny Mercer, George and Ira Gershwin.\n\nThe dominance of the AABA song form faded during the 1960s. The rise in popularity of rock ‘n’ roll and the rise of groups like The Beatles changed the popular music landscape. Before The Beatles broke off into other song writing formats, they heavily used AABA song form in many songs.\n\nThis song form is used in several music genres including pop, jazz and gospel.\n\nTo find out the details on AABA Song Form read our article AABA Song Form\n\nOften seen in love ballads, pop, country, and rock music, this song arrangement typically features verses that change in content while maintaining a consistent chorus both musically and lyrically. Hits such as Adele’s “Rolling In The Deep”, Ed Sheeran’s “Shape Of You” and The Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” showcase this structure perfectly. When writing a song with a verse/chorus format, it’s common to get to the chorus swiftly, which means that the verses should be kept pretty short.\n\nAB format has been the song writing format of choice for modern popular music since the 1960s. It is often used in love songs, pop, country, rap and rock music. Unlike the AABA form or AAA, which both highlight the verse, AB format puts emphasis entirely on the chorus. Although the AB Song Form has been around since the mid-nineteenth century, most popular songs from the classic rock period forward are written in the AB Song Form.\n\nMost popular songs from the classic rock period forward are written in the AB Song Form that has been around since the mid-nineteenth century. The AB Song Form consists of two or three verses that alternate with a second musical section referred to as the chorus. The chorus usually contains the song’s main message and title. It is differentiated from a bridge in that it sounds complete on a stand-alone basis. As with blues progressions, not all AB Song Form songs are found in the typical 32-bar length. Verses and choruses can be any length, however, most are four, eight, twelve, sixteen, or twenty-four bars long.\n\nThe first and most obvious form derived from AB is that of ABA’ Song Form, also called VERSE/CHORUS/BRIDGE Song Form. This is essentially AB song form with the addition of another third section, a bridge.\n\nTo find out the details on AB Song Form, ABA’ Song Form and other AB derived song forms, please read our article AB Song Form.\n\nAre you an experienced songwriter?
