        "text": "The Music You Love Tells Me Who You Are\n\nEver been a bit judgey when you hear someone’s taste in music? Of course you have.\n\nAnd you were right — music tells you a lot about someone’s personality.\n\nResearch has learned a great deal about the power of music:\n\nYour musical taste does accurately tell me about you, including your politics.\n\nYour musical taste is influenced by your parents.\n\nYou love your favorite song because it’s associated with an intense emotional experience in your life.\n\nThe music you enjoyed when you were 20 you will probably love for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd, yes, rockstars really do live fast and die young.\n\nBut enough trivia. It also turns out music affects your behavior — and much more than you might think.\n\nStudies show music can lead you to drink more, spendmore, be kind, or even act unethically.\n\nNo, rock and heavy metal don’t lead people to commit suicide — but it’s possible that country music might:\n\nThe results of a multiple regression analysis of 49 metropolitan areas show that the greater the airtime devoted to country music, the greater the white suicide rate.\n\nMusic is so powerful it’s even possible to become addicted to music.\n\nEric Barker: What 10 things should you do every day to improve your life?\n\nBut can we really use scientific research on music to improve our lives? Absolutely.\n\nHere are 9 ways:\n\n1) Music Helps You Relax\n\nYes, research shows music is relaxing.\n\nI know, I know, obvious, right? But what you might not know is the type of music that helps people relax best.\n\nNeed to chill out? Skip the pop and jazz and head for the classical.\n\nVia Richard Wiseman’s excellent book 59 Seconds: Change Your Life in Under a Minute:\n\nBlood pressure readings revealed that listening to pop or jazz music had the same restorative effect as total silence. In contrast, those who listened to Pachelbel and Vivaldi relaxed much more quickly, and so their blood pressure dropped back to the normal level in far less time.\n\n(More things that relieve stress are here.)\n\n2) Angry Music Improves Your Performance\n\nWe usually think of anger as something that’s just universally bad. But the emotion has positive uses too.\n\nAnger focuses attention on rewards, increases persistence, makes us feel in control and more optimistic about achieving our goals.\n\nWhen test subjects listened to angry music while playing video games, they got higher scores.\n\nVia The Science of Sin: The Psychology of the Seven Deadlies (and Why They Are So Good For You):\n\nWhat Tamir and her colleagues found was that people preferred to listen to the angry music before playing Soldier of Fortune. Faced with a task in which anger might serve a useful function, facilitating the shooting of enemies, participants opted for an anger boost. What’s more, listening to the angry music actually improved performance…\n\n(More on how to boost productivity here.)\n\n3) Music Reduces Pain\n\nWhen ibuprofen isn’t doing the job, might be time to put on your favorite song.\n\nResearch shows it can reduce pain:\n\nPreferred music was found to significantly increase tolerance and perceived control over the painful stimulus and to decrease anxiety compared with both the visual distraction and silence conditions.\n\n(More research based tricks for reducing pain here.)\n\nEric Barker: 4 Lifehacks From Ancient Philosophers That Will Make You Happier\n\n4) Music Can Give You A Better Workout\n\nWhat’s the best thing to have on your iPod at the gym?\n\nThe weight room is no place to try new genres. Playing your favorites can boost performance:\n\nThe performance under Preferred Music (9.8 +/- 4.6 km) was greater than under Nonpreferred Music (7.1 +/- 3.5 km) conditions. Therefore, listening to Preferred Music during continuous cycling exercise at high intensity can increase the exercise distance, and individuals listening to Nonpreferred Music can perceive more discomfort caused by the exercise.\n\n(More ways to improve your health here.)\n\n5) Music Can Help You Find Love\n\nWant to get the interest of that special someone? Put on the romantic music.\n\nWomen were more likely to give their number to men after hearing love songs:\n\n…the male confederate asked the participant for her phone number. It was found that women previously exposed to romantic lyrics complied with the request more readily than women exposed to the neutral ones.\n\n(More on how science can make you a better kisser here.)\n\n6) Music Can Save A Life\n\nDo you know the proper way to give CPR chest compressions? Turns out timing is key.\n\nAnd how can you best remember that timing during an emergency?\n\nSing “Stayin’ Alive” by the BeeGees. Yes, I’m serious:\n\n…Dr. John Hafner of the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Peoria had 15 physicians and med students perform the 100-compression procedure (on mannequins) while listening to the Bee Gees classic “Stayin’ Alive.” As Hafner reports in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, their mean compression rate was an excellent 109.1. Five weeks later, they repeated the exercise while singing the song to themselves as a “musical memory aid.” Their mean rate increased to 113.2. The medical professionals reported that the “mental metronome” improved both “their technical ability and confidence in providing CPR.”\n\n(More things that can improve your health and happiness here.)\n\n7) Music Can Improve Your Work — Sometimes\n\nDoes music at the office make you work better or just distract you? It’s a much debated issue and the answer is not black and white.\n\nFor the most part, it seems music decreases work performance – but makes you happier while you work:\n\n…a comparison of studies that examined background music compared to no music indicates that background music disturbs the reading process, has some small detrimental effects on memory, but has a positive impact on emotional reactions…\n\nThat said, a little bit of music can make you more creative. If you have ADHD, noise helps you focus:\n\nNoise exerted a positive effect on cognitive performance for the ADHD group and deteriorated performance for the control group, indicating that ADHD subjects need more noise than controls for optimal cognitive performance.\n\nAnd music with positive lyrics makes you more helpful and collaborative.\n\n(More on what will make you successful here.)\n\nEric Barker: How To Make Your Life Better By Sending Five Simple Emails\n\n8) Use Music To Make You Smarter\n\nThere is a ton of evidence that music lessons improve IQ.\n\nBut there’s even research that sayslistening to classical music might boost brainpower as well:\n\nWithin 15 minutes of hearing the lecture, all the students took a multiple-choice quiz featuring questions based on the lecture material. The results: the students who heard the music-enhanced lecture scored significantly higher on the quiz than those who heard the music-free version.\n\n(More on the most powerful way to easily get smarter here.)\n\n9) Music Can Make You A Better Person\n\nNeed to soften someone’s heart? Maybe even your own?\n\nPlaying music can make you more compassionate:\n\nIn a year-long program focused on group music-making, 8- to 11-year old children became markedly more compassionate, according to a just-published study from the University of Cambridge. The finding suggests kids who make music together aren’t just having fun: they’re absorbing a key component of emotional intelligence.\n\nVenezuela made music lessons mandatory. What happened? Crime went down and fewer kids dropped out of school:\n\nA simple cost-benefit framework is used to estimate substantive social benefits associated with a universal music training program in Venezuela (B/C ratio of 1.68). Those social benefits accrue from both reduced school drop-out and declining community victimization. This evidence of important social benefits adds to the abundant evidence of individual gains reported by the developmental psychology literature.\n\n(More on how to be a better person here.)\n\nSum Up\n\nSo music not only says a lot about you, it provides a myriad of easy ways to make your life better:\n\nMusic Can Help You Relax\n\nAngry Music Improves Your Performance\n\nMusic Reduces Pain\n\nMusic Can Give You A Better Workout\n\nMusic Can Help You Find Love\n\nMusic Can Save A Life\n\nMusic Can Improve Your Work — Sometimes\n\nUse Music To Make You Smarter\n\nMusic Can Make You A Better Person\n\nMost importantly: Music makes us feel good, and in the end, that’s worth a lot.\n\nSpeaking of music that makes you feel good, ever wondered what English sounds like to people who don’t speak it?\n\nThen you’ll love this song.\n\n“An Italian singer wrote this song with gibberish to sound like English. If you’ve ever wondered what other people think Americans sound like, this is it.”\n\nJoin 45K+ readers. Get a free weekly update via email here."
