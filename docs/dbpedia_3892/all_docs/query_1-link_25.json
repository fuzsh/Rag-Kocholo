        "text": "Original song written and composed by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman; first recorded by the Drifters\n\nThis article is about the song. For other uses, see Save the Last Dance for Me (disambiguation).\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\"Single by The Driftersfrom the album Save the Last Dance for Me B-side\"Nobody But Me\"ReleasedAugust 1960Recorded1960GenreLength2:34LabelAtlanticSongwriter(s)Doc Pomus, Mort ShumanProducer(s)Jerry Leiber and Mike StollerThe Drifters singles chronologyOfficial audio on YouTube\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" is a song written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, first recorded in 1960 by American musical group the Drifters with Ben E. King on lead vocals. It has since been covered by several artists, including Dalida, the DeFranco Family, Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Michael Bublé.\n\nDrifters' version\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 1990 interview,[1] songwriter Doc Pomus tells the story of the song being recorded by the Drifters and originally designated as the B-side of the record. He credits Dick Clark with turning the record over and realizing \"Save the Last Dance\" was the stronger song. The Drifters' version of the song, released a few months after Ben E. King left the group, would go on to spend three non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the U.S. pop chart, in addition to logging one week atop the U.S. R&B chart.[2] In the United Kingdom, the Drifters' recording reached No. 2 in December 1960.[3] This single was produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, two noted American music producers who at the time had an apprentice relationship with a then-unknown Phil Spector. Although he was working with Leiber and Stoller at the time, it is unknown whether Spector assisted with the production of this record; however, many Spector fans have noticed similarities between this record and other music he would eventually produce on his own.[4] Damita Jo had a hit with one of the answer songs of this era called \"I'll Save The Last Dance For You\".\n\nIn the song, the narrator tells his lover she is free to mingle and socialize throughout the evening, but to make sure to save him the dance at the end of the night.[5] During an interview on Elvis Costello's show Spectacle, Lou Reed, who worked with Pomus, said the song was written on the day of Pomus' wedding while the wheelchair-using groom watched his bride dancing with their guests. Pomus had polio and at times used crutches to get around.[6] His wife, Willi Burke, however, was a Broadway actress and dancer. The song gives his perspective of telling his wife to have fun dancing, but reminds her who will be taking her home and \"in whose arms you're gonna be.\"[7]\n\nMusicians on the Drifters' recording included Bucky Pizzarelli and Allen Hanlon (guitar), Lloyd Trotman (bass) and Gary Chester (drums).[citation needed]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United Kingdom (BPI)[15] Silver 200,000‡\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nEmmylou Harris version\n\n[edit]\n\nEmmylou Harris covered the song in a country/bluegrass style in 1979, including it on her Blue Kentucky Girl album. Also released as a single, her version reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles chart in mid-1979.[citation needed]\n\nDolly Parton version\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1983, Dolly Parton recorded \"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" releasing it as a single in late November; the song subsequently appeared on Parton's album of 1950s and 60s covers The Great Pretender, released in January 1984. Reaching the top ten on the country singles chart in late February, the single also crossed over, reaching No. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States.\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1983–1984) Peak\n\nposition Canadian RPM Country Tracks 2 U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles 3 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 45 U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks 12\n\nThe DeFranco Family version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\"Single by the DeFranco Familyfrom the album Save the Last Dance for Me B-side\"Because We Both Are Young\"ReleasedApril 1974Length2:58Label20th CenturySongwriter(s)Doc Pomus, Mort ShumanProducer(s)Walt MeskellThe DeFranco Family singles chronology\n\nThe DeFranco Family (featuring Tony DeFranco) released \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" in 1974 as a single and the title track of their 2nd album (20th Century Records); the single peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 8 on Canada's RPM 100 chart. The B-side of the single is \"Because We Both Are Young,\" written by Tom Bahler and Harry Shannon.\n\nMichael Bublé version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Save The Last Dance For Me\" was later covered by Canadian crooner Michael Bublé, and released as the third and final single from his second studio album, It's Time. The song was heavily remixed for its release as a single.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nFor its release as a single, the song was heavily remixed, with mixes from producers including Ralphi Rosario and Eddie Baez. All of the chart positions for the single are for each of the remixed versions of the song respectively. The single first peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart in September 2005.[16] After Bublé performed the album version of the song during the closing credits of the film The Wedding Date,[17] this version was released to radio, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, as well as reaching No. 99 on the Billboard Hot 100.[18]\n\nThe music video for the track was once again directed by Noble Jones, who directed the videos for both of the album's previous singles – Home and Feeling Good. The music video was choreographed by Raymondo Chan, a Salsa Latin dance coach and performer. It was shot in Vancouver, Canada.[citation needed]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCD / DVD single[19]\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (album version) – 3:38\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (Starcity remix) – 3:20\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (live version – video) – 4:14\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (music video) – 3:42\n\nDigital download[20]\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (album version) – 3:38\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (Ralphi's Anthomic vocal) – 9:36\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (Eddie's Anthem mix) – 9:53\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me\" (Ralphi's Hydrolic dub) – 8:29\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (2006) Peak\n\nposition US Billboard Hot 100 99 US Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks 5\n\nYear-end charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (2006) Rank US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)[21] 7\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United States (RIAA)[22] Gold 500,000*\n\n* Sales figures based on certification alone.\n\nOther versions\n\n[edit]\n\nBuck Owens released a cover version in 1962 that peaked at No. 11 on the US country charts and appeared on his album Together Again.[23]\n\nIn 1977, John Davidson reached No. 22 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart[24] and No. 44 on the Canadian AC chart.[25]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1960, American female R&B singer Damita Jo recorded an \"answer record\" to \"Save the Last Dance for Me\". Her song, entitled \"I'll Save the Last Dance for You\", built around the original song's melody and thus credited to Shuman and Pomus, peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in December 1960.[26]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Hot 100 number-one singles of 1960 (U.S.)\n\nList of number-one R&B singles of 1960 (U.S.)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
