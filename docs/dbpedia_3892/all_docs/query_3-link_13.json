Lengths of phrases can vary.\n\nRelated to rhythm:\n\nbeat: pulse\n\nmeasures or bars: a metrical unit separated by lines in musical notation\n\nmeter: groups of beats in a recurring pattern with accentuation on strong beats\n\nnon-metric, unmetrical: free rhythm, no discernable time\n\nsimple meters: beats subdivided into two parts (2/4, 3/4, 4/4)\n\ncompound meters: beats subdivided into three parts (6/8, 9/8, 12/8)\n\nasymmetrical meters: meters with an uneven number of subdivisions (7/4, 5/8)\n\nmixed meters: shifting between meters\n\nmensurations: used in music from 1300-1600, the ratios of rhythmic durations\n\nRelated to harmony:\n\nchords: three or more pitches sounding simultaneously\n\ntriads: three notes that can be arranged into superimposed thirds\n\nextended chords: thirds added above the triad, usually as a 9th, 11th or 13th\n\nconsonance: a harmonic combination that is stable, usually in thirds\n\ndissonance: a harmonic combination that is unstable, often including seconds or sevenths\n\nparallel motion: two or more parts moving in the same direction and same intervals, as in parallel fifths\n\ncontrary motion: two or more parts moving in the opposite direction\n\noblique motion: occurs when one voice remains on a single pitch while the other ascends or descends\n\ncanon: (meaning rule) one melody is strictly imitated by a second part after a delay in the entrance of the\n\nsecond part. In order for the parts to end simultaneously, the canon may break down at the end of the\n\ncomposition. The canonic parts may occur at the unison or some other interval.\n\nround: an exact canon, ending at different times, as in ?Row, row, row your boat.?\n\nimitation: two or more parts that have the same or similar phrase beginning and with delays between\n\nentrances (as in a round or canon), but after the beginning of the phrase, the parts diverge into separate\n\nmelodies\n\nRelated to tonality:\n\ndiatonic: a seven-note scale with a regular pattern of 5 whole and 2 half steps. Diatonic intervals are found\n\nwithin this type of scale.\n\nchromatic: using pitches outside of a particular diatonic scale, or using a succession of half steps.\n\nmajor tonality: pitches are related to a central pitch called the tonic. Major scales are used.\n\nminor tonality: pitches are related to a central pitch called the tonic. Minor scales are used.\n\nmodal: refers to music using diatonic scales with Greek names (Western) or non-Western scales\n\nmodulation: moving from one key area to another key\n\natonality: music that is not tonal or not based on any system of keys or modes\n\nbitonality: the simultaneous use of two key areas.\n\npolytonality: the simultaneous use of two or more key areas.\n\nRelated to texture:\n\nmonophony (noun; monophonic = adjective, as in monophonic texture): literally ?one sound? - one melodic line,\n\nwithout harmony or any accompaniment, which can occur when one person or many people sing a\n\nmelody simultaneously. Singing in octaves is considered a monophonic texture.\n\nhomophony (noun; homophonic = adjective): one melodic line with a harmonic accompaniment that supports\n\nthe melody.\n\npolyphony (noun; polyphonic = adjective): two or more parts sung or played simultaneously.\n\nheterophony (noun; heterophonic = adjective): multiple voices singing a single melodic line, but with\n\nsimultaneous melodic variants between the singers. Heterophony often occurs in non-Western music and\n\nsometimes in folk music.\n\nhomorhythms: the same rhythms in all parts, as in the singing of a hymn.\n\ncounterpoint (noun; contrapuntal = adjective): like polyphony in that it has two or more compatible melodies\n\nperformed simultaneously.\n\nRelated to tempo: consult the Oxford Music Online\n\ncommonly in Italian from the 17th-18th c., and then increasingly in other vernacular languages\n\nlargo, lento, adagio, andante, moderato, allegretto, allegro, presto, prestissimo\n\nqualifying terms: meno (less), pi (more), molto (very or much) poco a poco (little by little), assai (very) mosso (motion), sostenuto (sustained), non troppo (not too much)\n\nRelated to expression:\n\ncrescendo\n\ndecrescendo/diminuendo\n\npiano\n\nforte\n\nmezzo\n\nterraced dynamics: a sudden and dramatic shift from loud to soft or soft to loud\n\naccelerando\n\nrubato\n\nReleated to timbre: classifications of instruments\n\nchordophone: string instruments\n\naerophones: wind produces the sound (woodwinds and brass instruments)\n\nmembranophone: a vibrating membrane produces the sound (drums)\n\nidiophone: sound is produced from the material (wood, glass, stone, metal)\n\nRelated to ensembles:\n\nchoir: vocal ensemble\n\nvoice ranges: bass, tenor, alto, soprano (from lowest to highest)\n\nchoral: music written for a choir\n\na cappella: choral music without instrumental accompaniment, literally ?at the chapel?\n\npolychoral: two or more choirs in a composition, usually with an antiphonal or echo effect\n\norchestra: large instrumental ensemble with strings\n\nband: large instrumental ensemble without strings\n\nchamber ensembles: trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, octet\n\nStandard ensemble combinations:\n\nstring trio: three string instruments\n\npiano trio: piano, violin, cello\n\nstring quartet: two violins, viola, cello\n\npiano quintet: piano and a string quartet\n\nbrass quintet: 2 trumpets, french horn, trombone, tuba\n\nwind quintet: flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, french horn\n\nRelated to text and music:\n\nsyllabic: one syllable sung to each note\n\nmelismatic: one syllable sung to several notes\n\nsacred: religious music, often for the church liturgy (services)\n\nsecular: worldly, non-religious music, usually in the vernacular\n\nvernacular: texts in the language of the people (English, French, Spanish, German, etc.)\n\nRelated to musical forms:\n\nGenerally capital letters are used to distinguish different sections of a composition. A capital refers to an exact repetition. A lowercase letter refers to the same music but new text. A prime number after the capital refers to a variation of the music from the original section.\n\nrepetitive forms:\n\nstrophic: a vocal form consisting of several phrases. The musical form is repeated using different verses\n\nof text, as in a hymn or folksong.\n\nmodified strophic: simply means that the repetitions of the sections are varied slightly, but not so much\n\nthat they are a significant variation or the original.\n\nbar form: two sections of music, with only the first section A repeated. Many hymns use the far form.\n\nbinary form: two sections of music, usually with each A and B section repeated. This is typically used in\n\ndances. When a group dances are combined into a suite, the dances generally all stay in the same key.\n\nprocessive forms: variation forms:\n\ncontinuous variations: includes an ostinato -- a repeated bass line or set of chords (usually 4-8 measures)\n\nwith continuous variations above the bass pattern. This term is also called a ground bass, a chaconne,\n\nand a passacaglia. These are common in the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nsectional variations: a theme and variation set, where usually each section is clearly marked. Generally\n\nin a theme and variations, the theme itself is identifiable. Variation sets are commonly used in the Classical\n\nperiod as the slow movement of a string quartet or symphony.\n\nfugue: a one-subject (also called monothematic) composition in which the subject is continually restated on\n\ndifferent pitches and in various keys, processing the modulations, fragments or registers of the subject.\n\nLike the other variation forms, there is usually a return to the subject in the original key.\n\nreturn forms: the initial section returns following a contrasting middle section.\n\nrounded binary: two sections, with a return of A in the second section: |: A :|: B A :| This form is typical of\n\nlate Baroque dances and of minuets/scherzos and trios of the Classical period.\n\nternary: ABA, with new material in the middle section and a return to the first A material (exactly or\n\nvaried). The return to the final A section can be recopied in the music, denoted by a phrase above the\n\nmusic (da capo), or a sign (da capo al segno), which is common in da capo arias.\n\nrondo forms: ABACA, ABACADA, etc. the initial section is contrasted with episodes in different keys and\n\nstyles from the original A material. Rondos are typically used as the last movement of a Classical sonata,\n\nstring quartet or symphony.\n\nrondeau: a medieval song/dance, ABaAabAB\n\nvirelai: a medieval song/dance, AbbaA\n\nsonata form: two contrasting key areas in the first section (exposition) are developed in the middle section\n\n(development) and return in the final section (recapitulation) in the tonic key. The sonata form emerges\n\nfrom an expanded rounded binary form in the Classical period.\n\ncompound forms: any two forms combined to make a new, large form.\n\ntwo binary forms can be combined (Minuet ? Trio - Minuet) to produce a larger ABA structure\n\nsonata-rondo: combines the contrasting rondo sections ABA-C-ABA with the sonata principles of an\n\nexposition, development and recapitulation.\n\nconcerto-sonata form: derived from sonata form, but with two expositions (1. orchestra, 2. orchestra and\n\nsoloist) and a solo cadenza between the recapitulation and the coda.\n\nadditive form:\n\nthrough-composed: continuous contrasting sections are composed together without repetitions of\n\nprevious material. Ballad songs and improvisatory instrumental pieces, like the fantasia, toccata or prelude\n\nare examples of additive compositions. Some Renaissance genres (mass, motet, madrigal) are typically\n\nthrough-composed.\n\nRelated to genres: compositional types or categories of works\n\nexamples of sacred vocal genres:\n\nchant, plainsong or Gregorian chant\n\nmass\n\nmotet\n\noratorio\n\nchorale cantata\n\nexamples of secular vocal genres:\n\nopera\n\nsolo cantata\n\nmadrigal\n\nsong\n\nLied\n\nchanson\n\ncanion\n\nsong cycle\n\nexamples of instrumental genres:\n\ndance\n\nfantasia\n\nprelude\n\ntoccata\n\nfugue\n\nsonata\n\nsuite\n\nconcerto\n\nsymphony\n\ntone poem/symphonic poem\n\nprogram symphony\n\nNota bene: Instruments, terms, concepts, tempi and expressions often go by different names in foreign languages. It is best to look up unfamiliar words when they are encountered.\n\nHistorical periods, musical styles and principal genres\n\nMiddle Ages (also referred to as medieval music): 600-1420. Generally called the Middle Ages, this long historical era can be broken into several distinct developmental periods and falls between Classical Antiquity and the Renaissance."
