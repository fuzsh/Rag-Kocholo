        "text": "Tips on learning to identify birdsongs and bird calls\n\n1.Â Pick your spot. Choose somewhere easily accessible. Gardens and parks can be excellent spots, especially near fruiting trees and bushes, but street trees or any dense foliage can also attract songsters. Put up seed, nut and fat feeders if you have your own outdoor space, and see who turns up for breakfast. They're likely to sing nearby.\n\n2.Â The early bird catches the worm. Early morning and the hour before sunset are the times of day when bird song is at its most intense.\n\n3.Â Listen then look. Focus on the most frequent calls you hear - identifying birds is easier when you are only dealing with a few species. Once you have learned the most common sounds it will help you differentiate them from the less common. When you have noticed where a particular call is coming from, try and get a sighting of the bird to help you identify it. Most of the birds mentioned here will sing from a perch - a tree branch, fence, rock or roof - rather than from the ground.\n\n4.Â Use mnemonics and rhymes. These techniques for remembering sounds will help you differentiate the songs and calls of different species. We've included some examples below, but you might find making up your own helps you to remember them even better. Also think about the rhythm, tone and pitch of the sounds. Does the bird sound cheerful, cross or mournful? Does it sound relaxed or in a rush to get through its tune?\n\n5. Keep it simple. Don't try to identify too many birds at once when you are learning. Focus on one or two each day. Listen to recorded examples online and then come back to the area to listen again. Bird song identification apps can help get you started if you're struggling to see the singing bird.\n\nRobins have a delicate song with warbling notes, whistles and clear pauses. It is sometimes written as 'twiddle-oo, twiddle-eedee, twiddle-oo twiddle'. In the autumn and winter, the song is soft and mournful, becoming clearer and more powerful in the spring and summer months. You're also likely to hear it making a 'tic' sound, often repeated over and over, which is one of its calls.\n\nListen to the robin's songÂ andÂ its 'tic' call, and discover more audio recordings of robinsÂ on xeno-canto.\n\nWood pigeon\n\nIt is very likely you will have heard magpies chatting in the neighbourhood. They have a distinctive rattling call which is powerful and abrasive, as well as a 'ker-chock' contact call.\n\nListen to more audio recordings of magpies on xeno-canto.\n\nCollared dove\n\nThe cooing of the collared dove is similar to the sound of the wood pigeon but more persistent (lasting 10-20 seconds to the wood pigeon's 6-10 seconds) and with shorter, three-note 'I-LOOOVE-you' phrasing - appropriate, as they're often spotted in pairs. They are paler, smaller and less common than their woodland-dwelling counterparts.\n\nListen to the collared dove's song and discover more audio recordings of collared dovesÂ on xeno-canto."
