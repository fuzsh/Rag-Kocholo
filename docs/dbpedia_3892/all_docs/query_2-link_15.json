        "text": "\"Stronger Than You\" is a song featured in \"Jail Break\". It was written by Rebecca Sugar and sung by Estelle. Garnet sings it while she fights against Jasper on the Gem Warship after Steven helps her reform.\n\nThe song is available to stream on Spotify and the demo is available on Jeff Liu's SoundCloud stream.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nThis is Garnet.\n\nBack together.\n\nAnd I'm never going down at the hands of the likes of you because I'm so much better.\n\nAnd every part of me is saying \"Go get her\".\n\nThe two of us ain't gonna follow your rules.\n\nCome at me without any of your fancy tools.\n\nLet's go, just me and you.\n\nLet's go, just one on two.\n\nGo ahead and try and hit me if you're able.\n\nCan't you see that my relationship is stable?\n\nI can see you hate the way we intermingle.\n\nBut I think you're just mad 'cause you're single.\n\nAnd you're not gonna stop what we made together.\n\nWe are gonna stay like this forever.\n\nIf you break us apart, we'll just come back newer.\n\nAnd we'll always be twice the gem that you are.\n\nI am made\n\nO-o-o-o-of\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nO-o-o-o-of\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nThis is who we are.\n\nThis is who I am.\n\nAnd if you think you can stop me,\n\nThen you need to think again.\n\n'Cause I am a feeling,\n\nAnd I will never end,\n\nAnd I won't let you hurt my planet,\n\nAnd I won't let you hurt my friends.\n\nGo ahead and try and hit me if you're able.\n\nCan't you see that my relationship is stable?\n\nI know you think I'm not something you're afraid of,\n\n'Cause you think that you've seen what I'm made of.\n\nBut I am even more than the two of them.\n\nEverything they care about is what I am.\n\nI am their fury. I am their patience.\n\nI am a conversation.\n\nI am made O-o-o-o-of\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nO-o-o-o-of\n\nAnd it's stronger than you.\n\nL-o-o-o-ove.\n\nO-o-o-o-of\n\nL-o-o-o-ove.\n\nAnd it's stronger than you.\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nO-o-o-o-of\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nAnd it's stronger than you.\n\nO-o-o-o-of\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nLo-o-o-o-ove.\n\nSapphire's Song[]\n\n\"Sapphire's Song\" is a vocal, lyric-less song sung by Sapphire in the beginning of \"Jail Break\" while in her cell on the Gem Warship. It follows the same melody from \"Stronger Than You\"'s chorus.\n\nA Word from the Composers[]\n\nSurasshu[]\n\n\"This definitely qualifies as a career highlight for me! The song was composed by Rebecca Sugar, and an initial demo arrangement was made by Jeff Liu, which Estelle sang over. Estelle is one of my favorite modern R&B singers, so this was a daunting and yet enticing proposition to arrange.\n\nTaking Jeff’s arrangement as a guideline, we really wanted to emphasize the euphoria of Garnet being reformed. Rebecca told us to capture the feeling of “there’s no way she could lose”. I also felt that the new Garnet design warranted a new Garnet bass sound (for those of you keeping score: where Pearl is piano, Garnet is represented by synth bass), so this was a great opportunity to showcase it. I also felt like the bridge needed a synth solo, so I went all out on this one!\n\nAivi did a fantastic job adding to this arrangement by making the string sections magical (especially at the end when the song turns dramatic) which were then beautifully performed by Jeff Ball. Everybody did such a great job with this song, and I’m extremely proud of the final result.\n\nThank you all for watching the season finale! Tune in tomorrow for “Full Disclosure”!\"[1]\n\nJeff Liu[]\n\n\"Here's the demo I arranged for Stronger Than You! Rebecca wrote and recorded the vocal and omnichord tracks, and I put everything else together in Logic. We used this track to figure out the timing for the action sequence and for Estelle to sing to. Aivi and Surasshu then made it a billion times more awesome for the final version!\"\n\nRebecca Sugar[]\n\n\"The Stronger Than You DEMO! By me & Jeff Liu! Jeff was trying to figure out this rhythm that I couldn't quite pin down, you can hear me tapping it out on the table in the background of this track!\"[2]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe song's romantic theme refers to Sapphire and Ruby's relationship.\n\nWhen Garnet says, \"I am their fury, I am their patience\", she is referring to Ruby and Sapphire respectively with Ruby being the \"fury\" and Sapphire being the \"patience\".\n\nThe tune of the chorus is the same melody that Sapphire sang while she was in her prison cell.\n\nIts motif is also heard during \"Reconciliation\" and \"Reunion\", another two songs dedicated to Ruby and Sapphire.\n\nThe tune was also hummed during \"Something Entirely New\" in \"The Answer\", by Ruby and Sapphire. In the same episode, the soundtrack \"The Answer\" also contains the melody.\n\nAn acoustic version was played by Greg in the episode \"Reunited\" as Ruby came to the altar. In the same episode, a synthesized version of the same theme plays as Garnet approaches Blue Diamond.\n\nThe motif can be heard twice in Steven Universe: The Movie: during Garnet's verse of \"Happily Ever After\" and while Garnet is singing in \"True Kinda Love\".\n\nMost of the sounds of conflict (landing hits, hitting the ground/wall) are in sync with the song's tempo.\n\nIn the area Jasper crashes herself and Garnet into/during the \"second part\" of the song, the shape in the green orb in the background appears to \"dance\" to the rhythm, though the movements seem to be at consistent intervals.\n\nThroughout the song, Garnet's visor changes in dominant color depending on whose (Ruby/Sapphire) behavior she is representing.\n\nThe chord progression of the intro of this song is the same as the Grover Washington Jr. song, \"Just the Two of Us\".\n\nEstelle found the meaning of this song to be similar to \"Gold\" by Spandau Ballet and the theme from Fame.[3]\n\nThe way Garnet summons her weapon is reminiscent of a type of warm-up exercise called \"Bollywood Style\", where the dancer drags their hands from their knees and passes through their hair.\n\nThis song also has similar themes of strength to \"Strong in the Real Way\".\n\nIn the Danish version, some parts of the song are sung by Ruby and Sapphire together.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, when Estelle sings \"Stronger Than You\" live, she forgets various lyrics (having not sung the song in over a year) and sings \"A-a-a-aaaa\", instead of \"Lo-o-o-ove\".\n\nIn the Craig of the Creek episode \"The Other Side: The Tournament\", Kelsey briefly sings the main melody of this song.\n\nVideos[]\n\nReferences"
