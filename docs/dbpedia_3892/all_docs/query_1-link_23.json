        "text": "1946 song from the musical Annie Get Your Gun\n\n\"Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)\" is a show tune composed by Irving Berlin for the 1946 Broadway musical Annie Get Your Gun.[1] The song is a duet, with one male singer and one female singer attempting to outdo each other in increasingly complex tasks.\n\nIn the musical, the song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting contest between Annie Oakley and Frank Butler.[2] Its most memorable lines are, \"Anything you can do, I can do better; I can do anything better than you.\" The song was first performed in Annie Get Your Gun by Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton.[3]\n\nDuring the song, they argue playfully about who can, for example, sing softer, sing higher, sing sweeter, and hold a note for longer, and boast of their abilities and accomplishments, such as opening safes and living on bread and cheese, although Annie almost always seems to counter Frank's argument. Neither can \"bake a pie,\" though.[4]\n\nNotable versions\n\n[edit]\n\nEthel Merman and Ray Middleton from original cast recording (1946).[5]\n\nBing Crosby, Dick Haymes and The Andrews Sisters—recorded for Decca Records on March 19, 1947.[6]\n\nGroucho Marx and his daughter Melinda Marx (a child at the time) in home movie footage used for select TV specials.\n\nEthel Merman and Howard Keel (1950)\n\nBetty Hutton and Howard Keel in the 1950 film version of the musical\n\nMary Martin and John Raitt on the 1957 National Tour recording\n\nDoris Day and Robert Goulet for the Columbia Records album Annie Get Your Gun (1963)\n\nIn 1963, Heidi Brühl and Robert Trehy performed a German version in the stage version of this musical at the Theater des Westens in Berlin.\n\nEthel Merman and Bruce Yarnell in the 1966 revival recording.\n\nDusty Springfield and Freddie Paris on Bandstand (1967).\n\nRobert Morse and an office computer in 1968 TV series That's Life, episode S1E11 \"Bobby's Pink Slip\"[7]\n\nTwo dogs in The Goodies episode \"Kitten Kong\" (1971).\n\nBarbara Walters and Howard Cosell on Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell in 1975 debating who interviews people better.\n\nEthel Merman and Miss Piggy (1976) in The Muppet Show, episode 1.22\n\nIn 1977, Tina Arena and John Bowles recorded a version for their album Tiny Tina and Little John.\n\nIn 1990, Kidsongs released Ride the Roller Coaster, which contained a version of this song, where they play various arcade games at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park.\n\nFran Drescher and Madeline Zima (1994) in The Nanny, episode S1E22 \"I Don't Remember Mama\"\n\nMichael Jordan and Mia Hamm, Gatorade \"Michael vs. Mia\" commercial (1999), performed by Sophia Ramos[8][9][10]\n\nBernadette Peters and Tom Wopat in the 1999 Broadway revival version of the musical\n\nLewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso in a 2007 Mercedes-Benz commercial with Mika Häkkinen performing the last line.\n\nBlaire Elbert and Madeline Powell Cactus Cuties, performed at Cactus Theater in Texas in 2008.\n\nAmerican rapper J.
