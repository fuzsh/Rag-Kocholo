        "text": "Liturgical word in Judaism and Christianity\n\nFor other uses, see Hosanna (disambiguation).\n\nHosanna ( ) is a liturgical word in Judaism and Christianity. In Judaism it refers to a cry expressing an appeal for divine help.[1] In Christianity it is used as a cry of praise.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe word hosanna (Latin osanna, Greek ὡσαννά, hōsanná) is from Hebrew הוֹשִׁיעָה־נָּא, הוֹשִׁיעָה נָּא hôšîʿâ-nā and related to Aramaic ܐܘܿܫܲܥܢܵܐ (ʾōshaʿnā) meaning 'save, rescue, savior'.[2]\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible it is used only in verses such as \"help\" or \"save, I pray\" (Psalms 118:25). However, in the Gospels it is used as a shout of jubilation,[3] and this has given rise to complex discussions.[4] In that context, the word Hosanna seems to be a \"special kind of respect\" given to the one who saves, saved, will save, or is saving now. If so Hosanna means \"a special honor to the one who saves.\" The literal interpretation \"Save, now!\",[5] based on Psalm 118:25, does not fully explain the occurrence of the word.[3]\n\nLiturgical use in different traditions\n\n[edit]\n\nJudaism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Jewish liturgy, the word is applied specifically to the Hoshana Service, a cycle of prayers from which a selection is sung each morning during Sukkot, the Feast of Booths or Tabernacles. The complete cycle is sung on the seventh day of the festival, which is called Hoshana Rabbah (הושענא רבה, \"Great Hoshana\").[5]: 726 In Judaism it is always used in its original Hebrew form, הושע נא Hosha na or הושענא Hoshana.\n\nChristianity\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical meaning\n\n[edit]\n\nSince those welcoming Jesus were Jewish, as of course Jesus himself was, some would interpret the cry of \"Hosanna\" on the entry of Jesus in its proper meaning, as a cry by the people for salvation and rescue.[citation needed]\n\nChristian reinterpretation\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Hosanna\" many interpret as a shout of praise or adoration made in recognition of the messiahship of Jesus on his entry into Jerusalem,[3]\n\nIt is applied in numerous verses of the New Testament, including \"Hosanna! blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lᴏʀᴅ!\" (Matthew 21:9,15; Mark 11:9–10; John 12:13), which forms part of the Sanctus prayer; \"hosanna in the highest\" (Mark 11.10); and \"hosanna to the Son of David\" (Matt 21:9). These quotations, however, are of words in the Jewish Psalm 118. Although not used in the book of Luke, the testimony of Jesus's entry into Jerusalem is recorded in Luke 19.\n\nIn church music\n\n[edit]\n\nThe \"Hosanna Anthem\",[6] based on the phrase Hosanna, is a traditional Moravian Church anthem written by Bishop Christian Gregor of Herrnhut sung on Palm Sunday and the first Sunday of Advent. It is antiphonal, i.e. a call-and-response song; traditionally, it is sung between the children and adult congregation, though it is not unheard of for it to be done in other ways, such as between choir and congregation, or played between trombone choirs.\n\nMany songs for church use bear the title \"Hosanna\", including songs written by New Zealand singer Brooke Fraser Ligertwood (released on the 2007 Hillsong United albums All of the Above and live on Saviour King and covered by the Canadian group Starfield on their album I Will Go); another song by Paul Baloche on his 2006 album A Greater Song; another by gospel artist Kirk Franklin, and another by Andrew Peterson on his 2008 album Resurrection Letters II. Sidney Mohede's \"Hosanna (Be Lifted High)\" was included on Israel Houghton's 2011 Grammy Award-winning album Love God, Love People. \"Hosanna! Loud Hosanna\" is a well-known hymn by Jeanette Threlfall.\n\nOsanahan procession (Philippines)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Philippines, particularly in Tagalog-speaking provinces, the term Osanahan refers to a procession of the faithful with the priest from a prayer station (termed kuból or Galilea in some places) after the blessing of palms to the local church for the Palm Sunday liturgy. At each stop, children dressed as angels sing the antiphon Hosanna Filio David in Filipino or Latin along with traditional music by a rondalla or a brass band.[7]\n\nOther examples of modern usage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Latin phrase\n\nGloria, Hosanna in excelsis!\n\n[Glory! Hosanna in the highest!]\n\nfeatures in the refrain of the 1924 Christmas carol \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\".\n\nArchitect Frank Lloyd Wright famously used the word in his exclamation \"Hosanna! A client!\" after securing a commission, breaking a long, dry spell.[8]\n\nIn the 1969 Broadway musical 1776 the word is used repeatedly as part of the chorus of the song \"Cool, Cool, Considerate Men\".\n\n\"Hosanna\" is the name of one of the songs in the 1971 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. The song covers the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. The message that Jesus conveys in this sequence is \"There is not one of you that cannot win the kingdom, / The slow, the suffering, the quick, the dead.\"[9] The crowd's Hosannas become progressively tinged with foreboding (\"Hey JC, JC, won't you smile for me/fight for me/die for me\"),.[9] Their adoration is seen as a dangerous civil disturbance by the high priest Caiaphas, witnessing the event with members of the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees. (\"Tell the rabble to be quiet/We anticipate a riot/This common crowd is much too loud.\").[9] There is also a reprise of the chorus when Jesus is sent to King Herod.\n\nA. R. Rahman composed the song \"Hosanna\" for the 2010 Tamil movie Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa. Here the word is used as an exclamation of joy when a man sees his beloved. The Catholic Secular Forum (CSF) objected to this song and asked film-makers Fox Star Studios to remove it from the final cut of the Hindi remake of the film, Ekk Deewana Tha.[10]\n\nPaul McCartney's album New, released in 2013, features a song titled \"Hosanna\". Contextually, he uses the phrase as a cry for help in light of the world's current state of affairs.\n\nAmerican comedians Tim and Eric use the phrase \"blessed Hosanna\" freely in their piece \"Morning Prayer with Skott and Behr\".[11]\n\nThe Swedish Black Metal band Funeral Mist song \"Hosanna\" uses the cry with the opposite intent of its Christian origins, as the band typically does with biblical references.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nLanguage of Jesus § Hosanna (Ὡσαννά)\n\nHallelujah\n\nHosanna shout – a Latter Day Saint practice\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nYohannan Aharoni & Michael Avi-Yonah, The MacMillan Bible Atlas, Revised Edition, pp. 157–165 (1968 & 1977 by Carta Ltd).\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Aherne, Cornelius (1910). \"Hosanna\".
