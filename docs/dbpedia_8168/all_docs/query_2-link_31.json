        "meta_description": "The Journal of Critical Southern Studies was founded as part of efforts to provide an authentic outlet for the promotion and representation of ‘otherness’ through the lenses of Southern voices. Its departure point is the understanding that ‘throughout the world there are practical alternatives to the current status quo of which, however, we rarely take notice, simply because such alternatives are not visible or credible to our ways of thinking.’ Part of the inability to ‘rarely take notice’ has been the fact that the Global South remains ‘constituted as an intrinsically disqualified being.’ And so long as this continues, there will be dominance and suppression, the result of which would expand and consolidate what Upendra Baxi calls ‘geographies of injustices.’",

        "text": "For the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.\n\nThey may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game,\n\nbut they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. Audre Lorde ()\n\nI was born and live in that in-between space, nepantla, the borderlands.\n\nThere are other races running in my veins,\n\nother cultures that my body lives in and out of,\n\nand a white man who constantly whispers inside my skull.\n\nGloria Anzaldúa ()\n\nUn Mundo Donde. Quepan Muchos Mundos (A World Where Many Worlds Fit)\n\nZapatistas\n\nLiminagraphy is a new and emerging approach to research that centres onto-epistemological re-existence through decolonizing the self and coming into harmony, that is deep relation with all life, that of each other, the earth and all her beings. It is grounded in a “decolonial science” which seeks to retrieve a “relationality that exists underneath the wounds of coloniality”, reclaiming our relations to land, sea, sky, our ancestors, lineages and spirituality (). Inspired by Audre Lorde’s words in the epigraph above, liminagraphy is one radical possibility that emerges when “we sit with metaphor” (). Co-created with women of colour and those who resist the logics of dominant knowledge production in the racialized, gendered, colonial and neoliberal university, it is cultivated from the joy of being together, long walks in nature, deep conversations, shared meals, holding space and healing laughter. It is an approach in/from the margins, where resistance is rife in the pursuit of liberating knowledge from colonial logics. To this end, liminagraphy addresses the “double erasure” () of modernity/coloniality by attending not only to the erasure of other ways of knowing-being-sensing and the negation of this absence in the domain of dominant knowledge production, more importantly, it also offers a pathway out of the politics of recognition and into reception.\n\nLiminal Hangouts: A Podcast\n\nListen: https://anchor.fm/zuleika-bibi-sheik/episodes/Introducing-Liminal-Hangouts-e175tq9\n\nIn honouring the relations that co-created liminagraphy, the following section takes the form of a podcast. The lessons presented below have no linearity, they are not steps for doing a liminagraphy. Each episode features one or more of the relations (but only some of the many) who have shared their wisdom with us. These are the relations that hold the ‘me’ in ‘we’ accountable, in a reaching out for us. These episodes are but a cross-section of conversations, whatsapp chats, zoom calls, and voice notes over the past seven years which led to the emerging of liminagraphy. It all started with the question: in what ways can we cultivate knowledge that is epistemically non-violent in the context of the racialised, gendered, colonial, neoliberal university?\n\nLesson: Who is learning from Whom with Rosalba Icaza\n\nListen: https://anchor.fm/zuleika-bibi-sheik/episodes/Who-is-learning-from-Whom-with-Rosalba-Icaza-e172grg\n\nLesson: Being Together with Erasmus School of Colour (ESOC)\n\nListen: https://anchor.fm/zuleika-bibi-sheik/episodes/Being-together-with-Erasmus-School-of-Colour-e166f44\n\nLesson: Listening as a Practice with Constance Dupuis and Nanna Kirstine Leets Hansen\n\nListen: https://anchor.fm/zuleika-bibi-sheik/episodes/Listening-with-Constance-Dupuis--Nanna-Kirstine-Leets-Hansen-e176ck6\n\nLesson: Being/Becoming with Luthando Ngema and Charmika Samaradiwakera Wijesundara\n\nListen: https://anchor.fm/zuleika-bibi-sheik/episodes/BeingBecoming-with-Luthando-Ngema--Charmika-Samaradiwakera-Wijesundara-e176ikc"
