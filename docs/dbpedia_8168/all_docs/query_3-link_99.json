        "text": "This is the third and final instalment of our biographical tour of Maria Montez.\n\n…\n\nMaria refused to appear in the movie ‘Frontier Gal,’ also billed as The Bride Wasn’t Willing (1945). She was tired of the escapist film genre. As a result, her contract with Universal was temporarily suspended.\n\nIf you were to look at a poster of Maria’s next film The Exile (1946), you would think that she had a huge role. She appears for about 20 minutes. This was because Maria had signed a contract with Universal stipulating she would either be cast in a starring or co-starring role for her next eight films.\n\nIn her what was to be her last picture with Universal, Maria played Marguerita Novarro alongside Rod Camerion in the Western Pirates of Monterey (1947). One of Maria’s sisters had a bit part as a servant.\n\nAt the end of War World II, Maria Montez moved to Paris with her husband Jean-Pierre Aumont. Jean Pierre wanted to come back to Paris in order to get rid of the limitations his accent was causing him, he said:\n\n“At the beginning, my accent was my best friend, but later it became a big pain, because the North-American movie producers only wanted me for acting as the hero of their movies, meanwhile, deep inside of me, it was growing the desire of playing dramatic roles.”\n\nMaria Montez and Jean-Pierre Aumont were invited to the First Cannes International Film Festival in First Film Festival in Cannes in 1946 . See footage from minute 5 of the couple in various candid scenes: https://youtu.be/x3bEn6Q9r64?t=302\n\n1948 saw Montez and Aumont forming a production company together ‘Christina Productions’. And it produced ‘Wicked City’, directed by François Villiers, Jean Pierre’s brother.\n\nPierre has contributed to the ‘Wicked City’ script. He then started to write plays. Maria performed in a one of them, a one-woman production L’lle Heureuse (“The Happy Island”). Reviews were not favourable and Maria continued on with filmmaking.\n\nMontez next role was as ‘Christina’, the sadistic manager of a circus show, who uses her attractiveness to seduce men and force them to do dangerous acrobatic acts. Bernard Roland’s Portrait D’Un Assasin starred Erich Von Stroheim, Arletty and Pierre Braseur.\n\nLater Maria traveled to Italy for playing the leading lady role in the movie IL LADRO DI VENEZIA (‘The Thief of Venice’). Her performance was accepted by the critics and they said it was the best work of her whole career.\n\nDuring the making of ‘The Thief of Venice’, Maria and Jean-Pierre fought hard. Media reports expressed their suprise about the couple’s marriage as it was generally known as a strong relationship. On March 22nd, 1949. Jean Pierre stated to the media: “Love dreams do not last for ever.” This didn’t last long as weeks later Aumont also told the press he was writing a play for Maria. For their 8th wedding anniversary, Maria gave him an Alfa Romeo car and he bought her original earrings of platinum and diamonds designed by a famous Bulgarian jeweller. Years later these earrings were given by Jean Pierre to Diana Ross in the movie Mahogany (1973).\n\nThe second Italian movie from Montez was AMORE E SANGUE (City of Violence).\n\nWhen she came back to Paris, Maria started to rehearse for her debut in theatre with the play L’ILE HEREUSE (The Happy Island) that Jean Pierre wrote for her. Maria played the role of a Latin American actress called Carlotta Goya. A story about intrigues in Hollywood,. It was so loved in Paris it played in other European cities. The premier of the play was on January 1951, in the Edouard VII theater of Paris,\n\nIn what was to be Maria’s last film, as well as her and Jean-Pierre’s last film together. They starred in ‘ La Vendetta Del Corsaro’. During filming, Jean-Pierre shared this anecdote: “The Italians asked for her autograph in the streets and she blew them kisses. When we were in the Santa Maria Trastevere Restaurant, some kids got close to her and one of them put on his knees and told her: Give us another movie, please, I am begging you!”\n\nOn May 1951, her agent Louis Shurr proposed that Maria return to Hollywood. She wanted to but could not. A few months late, on the 7th, September 1951 Maria’s sisters Africa Gracia Vidal, died on September 7th, 1951, while she was taking a bath, in her house in Sureness, Paris. Her sisters Ada and Teresita found her drowned in the bath tub.\n\nAccording to the doctors, the cause of death was either a heart attack due to a shock of hot water (45 Celsius degrees) or that the hot water caused her to faint and drown.\n\nHer funeral was in the Saint Pierre of Chaillot Roman Catholic Church, on September 11th, 1951. The ‘Queen of Technicolor’ was buried in a blue satin dress with white accessories, designed by Jacques Hein. In her birth town of Barahona, Dominican Republic, the town mourned her death by declaring a 24 hour period of communal grief.\n\nPresident Joaquín Balaguer officially opened the Barahona International Airport on Saturday, 27 April, 1996: The Maria Montez International Airport.\n\nYou can also find a bronze star of Bulevar de la Juventud y de las Estrellas (Youth and Stars Boulevard) on Winston Churchill Ave in Santo Domingo.\n\nIn her will, Maria distributed her legacy (US $200,000) to her mother, some of her brothers, her daughter and her husband.\n\nDATE OF DEATH (LOCATION)\n\nSeptember 7th, 1951, Paris, France\n\nSources:\n\n“Maria Montez has a double personality, the one she made for Hollywood, and the mother and wife. . . that woman full of simplicity, culture and romance of an overflowing humanity.” Jean-Pierre Aumont\n\nMaria was beginning to get a few roles now but she was yet to become a star. The future Technicolor Queen’s next film was based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. Maria was cast in the title role of The Mystery of Marie Rogêt (1942), playing alongside Patrick Knowles. The film didn’t too well at the time but was re-released in 1943 at The Phantom of Paris.\n\nThis was followed by Pardon My Sarong, an Abbott and Costello vehicle. Unfortunately, her scenes were deleted from the film. But success was just around the corner. Her success was proceeded by love. When she met French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont.\n\nThe couple married at her Beverly Hills house on 14th July 1943, with Charles Boyer as best man. Jean-Pierre left after a month to complete his military service for the French Free Services. While he was away she wrote her novel, ‘Forever Is A Long Time’.\n\nMaria found a new leading man, professionally speaking when she was cast in a leading role as Scherezade in Arabian Nights (1942). Universal was betting on her increasing popularity with their first three-strip technicolour film. The film also co-starred Sabu with whom she would also work with regularly. The film was a hit and established the trio as stars. It also was nominated for some Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound and Best Music Score.\n\nFollowing on the success of Arabian Nights, Universal cast her again with Hall and Sabu in White Captive (1943), also billed as White Savage.\n\nOn the 23rd of October, 1943, Maria was awarded the Order of Juan Pablo Duarte and the Order of Trujillo for her efforts in promoting relations between the United States and the Dominican Republic. Flor Trujillo was the eldest daughter of the President of the Dominican Republic. Montez was the first woman to be presented with these awards. The event was held at the Ambassador Hotel. She served as a “Goodwill Ambassador of Latin America” by President Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nFollowing this, Universal put together another Hall and Montez vehicle, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1944). The screenplay was based on a tale from Thousand Nights, that originally included forty-two murders which included the murder of Ali, his cousin and all forty thieves. Universal made it into a more palatable version. One of the promotional posters for the film included “When beauty was the booty and the prize of all was love! Raiders! Slavers! Riches and Rogues…when beauty was the booty— and the prize of all was love!”\n\nSabu was originally cast but was replace by Turhan Bey due to him being drafted to military service.\n\nThe film was a high earner for Universal Pictures. So they continued on with the Hall and Montez adventure fantasy formula with Cobra Woman (1944). Maria had a double role as evil queen Nadja and her good twin sister Tollea.\n\nTollea (Maria Montez) is abducted and taken to Cobra Island, where the Queen is her grandmother. Ramu (Jon Hall) sets sail to save her, unknowingly accompanied by Kado (Sabu). his young friend Kado accompanying him as a stowaway.\n\nA panther attacks Ramu, who is saved by a dart from Kado’s deadly blowgun. They continue the search for Tollea, unaware that the high priestess of the island is Naja, her twin sister. The queen has ordered Tollea to be forcibly returned to Cobra Island only so she can displace her evil sister.\n\n“Montez is one of the few actresses whose behaviour is influenced by her work as an actress, if she is a queen, she will demand you to bow before her, even on the breaks, but if she is a slave, you could treat her very bad and she will not complain.” Robert Siodmak, Director of Cobra Woman\n\nThe last picture in which Maria and Jon Hall stay happily ever after together was Gypsy Wildcat (1944). While her adopted family are performing at a gipsy fair Carla (Maria Montez) is resting in the woods. She witnesses both the murder of Count Orso and Michael (Jon Hall) ride away from the scene of the crime. Carla returns to the fair and dances. Michael watches her performance. Baron Tovar and his troops soon interrupt the performance, accusing the gipsies of having murdered Count Orso. Michael and Carla help each other to save the gipsies.\n\nIn a change of pace, Maria was cast in a comedy Bowery to Broadway (1944). Two Bowery vaudevillians find success in producing shows on Broadway, but when one of them suddenly departs to work for a beautiful woman, a feud erupts.\n\nIn 1945, Montez played Naila, queen of the ancient Egyptian kingdom of Khemis in Sudan. when her father is killed in a slave revolt. Continuing her penchant for going incognito among the people, she seeks out rebel leader Herua (Turhan Bey). But through palace treachery, she herself is captured and enslaved. After various adventures, she finds herself rescued by (and attracted to) the very rebel she was seeking.\n\n“Sudan is making more money than the others and Universal thinks on that account I should appear in more of these films,” she said. “But I want to quit these films when they are at a peak, not on the downbeat. It isn’t only that the pictures are all the same, but the stories are one just like the other.”1\n\nJean-Pierre Aumont returned and the couple were reunited. It wasn’t long before they were expecting their first child. Maria had been fighting with Universal to do some more challenging roles other than the Technicolor oriental adventures she had been doing. In fact, she was suspended for a while after refusing a couple of films. Universal finally gave way and cast her in Tangier (1946), a B & W thriller, directed by George Waggner.\n\nThe storyline goes that disgraced American war correspondent Paul Kenyon, cafe dancer Rita, and local entrepreneur Pepe, team up to battle Adolpho Fernandez, a Nazi diamond smuggler. Filming started on 24 September 1945. Turhan Bey and Jon Hall had gone into the army so their roles were played by Sabu and Robert Paige respectively. It was Sabu’s first movie on his return from the services. Montez was pregnant during filming. Maria Christina (also known as Tina Aumont) was born on 14 February 1946.\n\nNext week conclude Maria’s story. Maria Montez: Part 3: Freedom and France\n\n******\n\nSource: 1. Schallert, Edwin (9 June 1945). “Daughter of Director Begins Cinema Career”. Los Angeles Times. p. A5.\n\nIn a little coastal town in the Dominican Republic, a young girl dreamed of being a star. She became the first Dominican-born Star of Hollywood, a popular pin-up girl but was most known as the Queen of Technicolor. I am currently in Santo Domingo and I find myself revisiting her films and wanting to know how she got into Hollywood. And what happened to her.\n\nI have been visiting Santo Domingo since 2000, so I don’t recall which visit it was that I rediscovered this gorgeous Dominican beauty. I just remember the moment. One day my husband and I were strolling in Mirador Sur Park, a six-kilometre park located near my husband’s family house where we regularly stay. I was stunned to come across a mural dedicated to Maria Montez. I immediately recognised her. As a girl, I vividly remember watching Cobra Woman with my dad. Maria’ had a double starring role as good twin Tollea and evil twin Naja in Cobra Woman (1944).\n\nThis dive into the rabbit hole of Maria Montez’s life went deeper than originally intended as I had to sift through what was the myth and the reality. ‘The Queen of Technicolor’ is a moniker that fitted a woman and life that was every bit as colourful as the technicolour films she starred in. In fact, the studio press also labelled her as ‘The Caribbean Cyclone’ and ‘Tempestuous Montez’. Like most actresses, ‘Montez’ was a screen name. And like many stars, the publicity team at Universal created a glamorous background story for the American film-going public. A story was fabricated that she grew up in the Canary Islands and her father, a Spanish diplomat was sent to Ireland where she met her first husband William G. McFeeters, an Irish banker. From what I have gathered the truth is closer to this.\n\nHer full Christian name was Maria Africa Antonia Gracia Vidal de Santo Silas. The shorter version was Maria Africa Garcia Vidal. She was born on the 6th June 1912, in Santa Cruz de Barahona, a paradisical coastal town in the south-west region of the Dominican Republic. She was the second daughter of Isidoro Garcia Gracia and Regla (Rule) Maria Teresa Vidal Recio. Maria was born after Isidoro, and followed by Aquilino, Joaquín, David, Ada, Consuelo, Luz, Luis, Jaime and Teresita. Her mother was from Bani (an hour’s drive east of Barahona).\n\nShe was named Maria Africa in honour of her father’s native land, La Palma (the Canary Islands situated on the West Coast of Africa). Her father Isidoro Garcia was an exporter of textiles and Lignum Vitae, a hardwood known as guayacanes.\n\nIsidoro also possessed the title of Honorary Vice Consul of Spain. Universal Studios put out the story that she had grown up in Tenerife, attending the Sacred Heart Convent in Santa Cruz. However, she spent the first part of her life in Barahona until the early 1930s.\n\nAs a child she was known as having a vivid imagination, often creating homemade stages and she reportedly learnt English from American magazines and films.\n\nAt 20, on the 28th November 1932, she married wealthy Irish banker, William G. McFeeters. He was working at the First National Bank of New York in Barahona. Supposedly he whisked her off to live with his family in a castle in Belfast. William was an officer in the army and was often away. During that time, supposedly Maria frequently visited London and Paris. In 1939, Maria informed him that she wished to dissolve the marriage. I am not sure of the truth for that but it sounds plausible enough for her to demand a divorce. More than likely she wanted to escape the village as she had a desire for stardom.\n\nFollowing her divorce to McFeeters, she moved to New York on July 39′ and began modelling for magazine covers. She posed for McLelland Barclay, a well-known illustrator. (He created the first pin-up poster for Betty Grable).\n\nShe was informed that RKO Executive George Schaeffer was dining for lunch at the famous Manhattan 21 Club or “21”. Maria arrived before Schaeffer in the company of her agent Louis Schuff, dressed to impress, acting in a coquettish manner. Her ploy worked and Schaeffer asked her to audition for a film.\n\nHowever, her screen tests were viewed by Joe Pasternak, director of Universal Pictures. She accepted an offer from he to start at Universal for $150 per week.\n\n“My audience expects to look like a star, and so I choose my clothes. However, before them I try to behave like an old and intimate friend.”\n\nMaria Gracia chose the name of Maria Montez after the Irish dancer Lola Montez (stage name of Maria Dolores Eliza Gilbert) (1818-1861) whom Maria’s father often talked about. She also shaved eight to ten years off her life by claiming she was 20, not 28. Understandable considering she was competing with actresses of that age. She also hired fashion designer Vera West as well as two maids to create her own style.\n\nAnd so her screen time begins…\n\nWhen I see myself on the screen, I am so beautiful, I jump for joy!\n\nHer first few movies were a series of bit parts including her first as Linda Calhoun in the Western, Boss of Bullion City (1940). Followed by Marie in the comedy sci-fi The Invisible Woman (1940) and an uncredited role in Lucky Devils (1941).\n\nLegend has it that Maria created her own fan club during this time called the “Montez For Stardom Club”. She soon got a break when Universal lent her to 20th Century for a role in That Night in Rio (1941) starring with Alice Faye, Carmen Miranda and Don Ameche dancing the Rhumba.\n\nIn 1941, Maria was cast as Zuleika in a Middle Eastern romp Raiders of the Desert, starring Richard Arlen and Andy Devine, the first role where she put on the veils.\n\nIn Moonlight in Hawaii , the style department had the brilliant idea of dying her blonde. She had a small role as Ilani.\n\nMontez further proved her ability for self-promotion. She made a public statement that she was the fiancée of Lieutenant Commandant Claude Strickland, missing in action. “I know he’s alive somewhere.” She said, with tears in her eyes.\n\nTo gain attention in the Universal Studio commissary, she would be accompanied by a huge entourage. She liked to make spectacular entrances at nightclubs and social functions.\n\nMontez promotional efforts finally paid off in 1942. Once again Universal sent her off to the Pacific, casting her as Melahi in South of Tahiti. Thus beginning her path as an actress typecast in roles as an exotic beauty in adventure films to rival the likes of Dorothy Lamour.\n\nThis was followed by a supporting role in spy film Bombay Clipper (1942).\n\nContinue with MARIA MONTEZ: PART 2: A TECHNICOLOR STAR IS BORN\n\nHe often played a dashing hero on the screen but in real life, Errol Flynn was the original “Tassie Devil”.\n\nBritish actor Stewart Granger said: “He was a bit of a sadistic devil, was Errol, but it was always done with such charm and sense of mischief that he was always forgiven.”\n\n10. He originally wanted to call his autobiography ‘In Like Me’ due to his fondness for the phrase “in like Flynn”. An expression often used in the media and society based on his ability to seduce women. The publisher insisted on the more toned down title ‘My Wicked, Wicked Ways‘.\n\n9. In 1941, he bought an eleven and half acre property on Mulholland Drive. He built a two-story colonial style ranch house and officially named it “Mulholland Farm”, privately the “playhouse”. Flynn had secret passageways installed with peepholes and two-way mirrors so he could spy on females as they changed into their bathing suits or used the shower in the bathroom. He also installed microphones that were connected to his den so he and his friends could listen to the women discussing the men.\n\n8. He liked to embellish the truth about his life, claiming he had been educated in London and Paris. Or of his glittering film career in Australia, when in truth he had starred in one film, Charles Chauvel’s ‘In the Wake of the bounty’.\n\n7. An 18-year-old Errol arrived on the Montoro in New Guinea in 1st October 1927 for adventure and in pursuit of gold. He sailed back and forth from Sydney to New Guinea for seven years. He moved from job-to-job including: cadet patrol officer, gold prospector, slave recruiter, dynamiting fish, bird trapper, manager of Kenobot coconut plantation near Kokopo, tobacco plantations, air cargo clerk, copra plantation overseer, a partner in a charter schooner business boat captain, pearl diver, gold prospector and diamond smuggler. Unfortunately, he spent more than he earned, leaving a trail of debts behind him.\n\n6. Errol’s parties at Mulholland Farm were legendary. They were known to feature “live dance bands, nude divers, fencing exhibitions, and plenty of girls.” He also had a menagerie of animals.\n\n5. On the weekend of Flynn August 2-3, 1941, did a photo shoot for Life magazine on his yacht the ‘Sirocco’ sailing around Catalina Island. Photographer Peter Stackpole wanted some girls on the boat and Flynn invited Peggy Satterlee. She was only fifteen but Flynn thought she appeared “could have passed for anywhere between twenty and twenty-five.” Peggy’s parents threaten to tell the police he had seduce their daughter unless they paid him $5000. Flynn refused to pay and they pressed charges. The police decided there was no case, visited the parents in Santa Barbara and persuaded them not to prosecute. Since the girl was very young and would be exposed to a humiliating scandal, the matter was dropped.\n\n4. A year later, in September 1942, 17-year-old Betty Hansen she was invited to a party at the Bel Air mansion. Betty’s boyfriend urged her to sleep with Flynn in order to get a secretarial job at Warners. She claimed that he had seduced her. The Satterlee episode was revived by a new district attorney. On the 20th November, 1942 Flynn was accused of three accounts of statutory rape against Peggy (two) and Betty. The month long trial acquitted him of the rape but left his reputation and emotional state damaged. Following this, Flynn received two extortion attempts and he was also being watched by the F.B.I. He also had an affair with Linda Christian at the time, she later became Tyrone Power’s wife.\n\n3. Errol Flynn’s friend director Raoul Walsh claims he played a prank on him, the day after John Barrymore’s death. Walsh apparently bribed a mortician to release Barrymore’s body to him because his friend that had arthritis would not be able to attend the funeral. Errol came home to find Barrymore sitting upright in a chair in his den with a drink in his hand. In ‘My Wicked, Wicked Ways’ Flynn stated: “As I opened the door, I stared into the face of Barrymore. His eyes were closed. He looked puffed, white, bloodless. They hadn’t embalmed him yet. I let out a delirious scream. My heart pounded. I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night.”\n\n2. Flynn was expelled from Hobart High School (on three accounts). His father used his influence to get him into Sydney Grammar and SCEGS (Sydney Church of England Grammar School) but he was expelled after five months for being a ‘disturbing influence’. The reasons are not verified but suggestions of sexual relations and stealing.\n\n1. Flynn was considered to be both misogynistic and a romanticist when it came to women, with an obvious eye for young women later in life. His close friend and house mate David Niven said: “a big turnover was the thing, with the accent on youth. Flynn’s attitude to women perhaps began with his strained relationship with his mother, Marielle. From age five, Flynn witnessed her affairs with other men and she abused him regularly.He was married three times, including a tumultous, often violent marriage to actress Lily Damita. He had countless affairs with women. Affairs with Hollywood ladies included: Olivia de Havilland, Joan Bennett, Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino, Linda Christian, Lupe Velez,and Shelley Winter.\n\nReportedly his last words were “I’ve had a hell of a lot of fun and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.”\n\nSources:\n\nAnderson, N, 28 Sep, 1976, ‘Walsh remembers prank that scared Errol Flynn’, Beaver County Times, pp. 10\n\nCaterson, S., 03 Jun 2009, ‘Genius for living driven by a lust for death’.

Prior to this feature film, Indigenous actors were offered only small parts as stockmen, trackers or domestic servants. He is mostly widely known for his role as ‘Marbuk’ in Charles Chauvel’s 1955 drama ‘Jedda’.\n\n‘I hunted, fought, sang like all my people. No clothes. No worries. The country I ran in was my own—every rock, tree meant something to me’.\n\nTudawali’s traditional name was Majingwanipini. He was born and raised on Melville Island, in the Tiwi Islands. The islands are located 80 km to the north of Darwin where the Arafura Sea joins the Timor Sea. In the 1930s, Tudawali made his way to Darwin to seek work and took on the name ‘Bobbie Wilson’. He was educated at the Native Affairs Branch school at Kahlin compound. He was known to have quite a rich English vocabulary and was nicknamed ‘Gentle Bobbie’.\n\nFilm career\n\nTudawali was working in a garage in Darwin and playing Australian Rules football when the producers of the film Jedda found and cast him in a lead role. Along with Rose Ngarla Kunoth-Monks, Tudawal was the first Indigenous actor to have a substantial role in an Australian film in Jedda (1955). Jedda was also the first Australian film shot in full-colour. Chauvel was nominated for the Golden Palmes award at Cannes for his role as Director. Jedda premiered in Darwin not received well in Australia and it was the last film made by director Charles Chauvel. Tudawali developed a strong friendship with Charles Chauvel and his wife Elsa. Jedda is a story of an Aboriginal baby girl raised by a white station owner and kept in ignorance of traditional ways, and the Aboriginal man who carries her off, even though this is a forbidden “wrong way” marriage, and brings tragedy to both of them.\n\nTudawali played the role of Emu Foot in Dust in the Sun (1958), a mystery film adapted from the novel Justin Bayard by Jon Cleary and produced by the team of Lee Robinson and well-known Australian actor Chips Rafferty. Justin Bayard (Ken Wayne), a Northern Territory policeman, is given the job of taking an Aboriginal prisoner Emu Foot (Robert Tudawali), to Alice Springs to be tried for a tribal killing. Bayard is wounded during a revenge attack by tribesmen, and Emu Foot helps him get to a remote cattle station.\n\nTelevision\n\nUnder the name Bobby Wilson he took part in seven episodes of the 1961 TV series Whiplash. A Western drama, set in 1797. Tudawadi also played Don Reynolds in the ABC television play Burst of Summer in 1961. A live television drama about an Australian indigenous woman who, after a brief taste of being a film star, goes back to live in the outback.\n\nActivism\n\nTudawali served as Vice-President of the Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights, working with trade unionists and author Frank Hardy, fought to highlight the poor wages and conditions of Aboriginal stockmen in the Northern Territory, which culminated in the Wave Hill walk off in 1966. Tudawali had organised to give a series of talks to unionists throughout Australia in support of the stockmen when the Northern Territory administration banned any travel by Tudawali due to the tuberculosis he was suffering at the time.\n\nDied on Friday, 11th Aug 1967, from burns he received in a grass fire at Bagot two weeks earlier. The funeral was held at Community Church, Nightcliffe, today. His remains are located in Darwin Cemetery in an unmarked grave, number 103.\n\nA film of his life was released in 1987.
