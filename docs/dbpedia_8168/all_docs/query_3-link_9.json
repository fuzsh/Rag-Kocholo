At Envision Moore Consulting Group, we believe that the right mindset is a game-changer for achieving impactful leadership and business success. 💡 How are you fostering a positive, growth-oriented mindset in your leadership journey? #MindsetMatters #Leadership #GrowthMindset #Innovation #Success #ContinuousLearning #LeadershipDevelopment #EnvisionMoore Dr. Monica Curry, CDE®Germaine Smith-Baugh, Ed.D.Natasha LabosHeather UrquidesDr. Rebecca CorbinTrish TruittDonnell LayneDouglas BrownEd StringerMichael WilsonLisa Kiplinger KennedyKeantha Belton Moore, MPA, PMP®, FCCMPaula DeBoles-Johnson, MPA, CCMFelina Martin, CDMPJackie Eichhoefer\n\n🚀 How can academia better prepare graduates for today’s rapidly changing workplace? 🤔 As the workforce rapidly evolves, colleges can’t always keep pace with the skills employers demand. This disconnect forces companies to take on the challenge of extensive onboarding and upskilling – a necessary but complex task to ensure new hires hit the ground running. 💼 Rajesh Namboothiry, SVP at ManpowerGroup, highlights a reluctance to hire new grads across industries. The pressing question is: How do we bridge that gap? 🔄 Many employers are lowering traditional education requirements in favor of skills from tech boot camps and industry certifications. 📈 At Envision Moore Consulting Group, we partner with educational institutions to evaluate and redesign their workforce models to ensure responsiveness and alignment with industry. We also partner with employers to navigate these challenges by offering workforce development solutions, from enhancing onboarding processes to designing upskilling programs that align talent with business needs. Partnering with us means ensuring graduates and new hires are prepared to succeed from day one along with your current workforce. 🤝 #PartnershipsMatter #FutureOfWork #Upskilling #HiringTrends #GenZ #Onboarding #WorkforceDevelopment #EnvisionMoore 📝 Source: worklife.news Douglas BrownDonnell LayneEd StringerBob PaxtonChris MackeyBelinthia BerryEric KennedyLisa Kiplinger KennedyMartina McDowellMargie BurnhamMelissa Tarte, SHRM-CPSam ThevanayagamReza JafariMichael Wilson\n\n🌟 Are you ready to lead a multigenerational workforce? 🌟 For the first time in history, organizations are seeing up to five generations working side by side—from Traditionalists to Gen-Z. With population aging, this trend will only continue to grow. According to Forbes, by 2030, 150 million jobs are expected to shift to workers over the age of 55! 👵👴 This unique workforce dynamic offers incredible benefits: 🔑 Fresh perspectives 🔑 Mentorship opportunities 🔑 Stronger talent pipelines But it also comes with challenges like communication differences, generational stereotypes, and potential age discrimination. So, how can leaders harness the power of this diverse team? ✨ Debunk false stereotypes ✨ Focus on shared values ✨ Adopt a flexible management style ✨ Foster generational collaboration ✨ Encourage open dialogue 🔍 Question for you: How is your organization preparing to navigate and leverage a multigenerational workforce? When was the last time you evaluated your workforce programs? 🤔 #Leadership #MultigenerationalWorkforce #DiversityAndInclusion #WorkplaceCulture #FutureOfWork #Mentorship #EmployeeEngagement #HRLeadership #EnvisionMoore Source: Forbes Zuleika PereraDina DavisDouglas BrownChris MackeyDonnell LayneDr. Monica Curry, CDE®\n\n#DidYouKnow 📊 According to LinkedIn Learning’s 2024 Workplace Learning Report, only 33% of organizations have formal internal mobility programs, and just one in five employees feels confident in their ability to make an internal move. 💡 Jean Pelletier, VP of Digital Talent Transformation and Global Talent Acquisition at Schneider Electric, pointed out that “it was easier to leave and get rehired than to find a job within the company.” Schneider successfully revamped their internal hiring process, but many organizations still have a long way to go. Why should talent leaders care? Data shows that companies excelling in internal mobility enjoy numerous benefits: increased leadership development, longer employee tenure, and greater learner engagement. ❓ Is your organization leading the way in internal mobility, or is there room for improvement? #InternalMobility #LeadershipDevelopment #TalentManagement #EnvisionMoore #humanresources At Envision Moore Consulting Group, we help organizations unlock their full potential. Let’s talk about how we can support your internal mobility initiatives!

It’s about stepping forward, leading by example, and making a compelling case for others to follow. What do you think?
