        "text": "Moyamoya disease associated with asymptomatic mosaic Turner syndrome: a rare cause of hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nManjila, Sunil; Miller, Benjamin R; Rao-Frisch, Anitha; Otvos, Balint; Mitchell, Anna; Bambakidis, Nicholas C; De Georgia, Michael A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMoyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular anomaly involving the intracranial carotid arteries that can present clinically with either ischemic or hemorrhagic disease. Moyamoya syndrome, indistinguishable from moyamoya disease at presentation, is associated with multiple clinical conditions including neurofibromatosis type 1, autoimmune disease, prior radiation therapy, Down syndrome, and Turner syndrome. We present the first reported case of an adult patient with previously unrecognized mosaic Turner syndrome with acute subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage as the initial manifestation of moyamoya syndrome. A 52-year-old woman was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage with associated flame-shaped intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe. Physical examination revealed short stature, pectus excavatum, small fingers, micrognathia, and mild facial dysmorphism. Cerebral angiography showed features consistent with bilateral moyamoya disease, aberrant intrathoracic vessels, and an unruptured 4-mm right superior hypophyseal aneurysm. Genetic analysis confirmed a diagnosis of mosaic Turner syndrome. Our case report is the first documented presentation of adult moyamoya syndrome with subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage as the initial presentation of mosaic Turner syndrome. It illustrates the utility of genetic evaluation in patients with cerebrovascular disease and dysmorphism. Copyright Â© 2014 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The impact of collateral channels on onset type was also examined. METHODS This study included 71 involved hemispheres in 41 patients with moyamoya disease. The disease was categorized into 6 stages according to Suzuki's angiographic staging system. The degree of development of each moyamoya vessel was categorized into 3 grades. RESULTS The LSA started to dilate in stage 2, showed the most prominent development in stage 3, and decreased in more advanced stages (p < 0.001). The AChA most notably developed in stage 3 and gradually shrank (p = 0.04). The PCoA started to dilate in stage 3 and showed the most prominent development in stage 4 (p = 0.03). The PChA started to dilate in stage 3 and showed the most prominent development in stages 4 to 5 (p < 0.001). Patient age was negatively related to LSA development (p = 0.01, R = 0.30) and was positively associated with the abnormal dilation and extension of the PCoA (p = 0.02, R = 0.28) and PChA (p < 0.001, R = 0.45). The PCoA, AChA, and PChA more distinctly developed in hemispheres with intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage than in hemispheres with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the collateral channels through moyamoya vessels longitudinally shift from the anterior to posterior component during disease progression and aging, which may be closely related to the onset of hemorrhagic stroke in adult moyamoya disease.\n\nIntrinsic development of choroidal and thalamic collaterals in hemorrhagic-onset moyamoya disease: case-control study of the Japan Adult Moyamoya Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujimura, Miki; Funaki, Takeshi; Houkin, Kiyohiro; Takahashi, Jun C; Kuroda, Satoshi; Tomata, Yasutake; Tominaga, Teiji; Miyamoto, Susumu\n\n2018-05-04\n\nOBJECTIVE This study was performed to identify the angiographic features of hemorrhagic-onset moyamoya disease (MMD) in comparison with those of patients with ischemic-onset MMD. METHODS This case-control study compared the data set of the Japan Adult Moyamoya (JAM) Trial with the angiographic data of adult patients with ischemic-onset MMD. The authors analyzed angiograms obtained at onset, classifying the collaterals into 3 subtypes: lenticulostriate anastomosis, thalamic anastomosis, and choroidal anastomosis. They then compared the extent of these collaterals, as indicated by the collateral development grade from 0 to 2 in each subtype, between the JAM Trial group and the ischemic-onset group. They also compared the involvement of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and Suzuki's angiographic staging between each group. RESULTS Among 89 ischemic-onset patients, 103 symptomatic hemispheres in 80 patients were analyzed and compared with 75 hemorrhagic hemispheres from the JAM Trial. The hemorrhagic-onset patients showed a significantly higher proportion of thalamic anastomosis (p = 0.043) and choroidal anastomosis (< 0.001), as indicated by grade 2 in each subtype, compared with ischemic-onset patients. Suzuki's angiographic staging was significantly higher in the hemorrhagic group (< 0.038). There was no difference in the extent of lenticulostriate anastomosis and PCA involvement between the groups. CONCLUSIONS In adult MMD, the characteristic pattern of the abnormal vascular networks at the base of the brain is different between each onset type. In light of the more prominent development of thalamic and choroidal anastomosis in the JAM Trial group in the present study, development of these collaterals, especially the choroidal collateral extending beyond the lateral ventricle, may play a critical role in hemorrhagic presentation in MMD.

Although sharing the same ischemic stimulus with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, Moyamoya disease is characterized by a highly instable cerebrovascular system which is prone to rupture due to pathological neovascularization. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this instability, angiopoietin-2 gene expression was analyzed in middle cerebral artery lesions obtained from Moyamoya disease and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease patients. Angiopoietin-2 was significantly up-regulated in Moyamoya vessels, while serum concentrations of soluble angiopoietins were not changed. For further evaluations, cerebral endothelial cells incubated with serum from these patients inÂ vitro were applied. In contrast to atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease serum, Moyamoya disease serum induced an angiopoietin-2 overexpression and secretion, accompanied by loss of endothelial integrity. These effects were absent or inverse in endothelial cells of non-brain origin suggesting brain endothelium specificity. The destabilizing effects on brain endothelial cells to Moyamoya disease serum were partially suppressed by the inhibition of angiopoietin-2. Our findings define brain endothelial cells as the potential source of vessel-destabilizing factors inducing the high plasticity state and disintegration in Moyamoya disease in an autocrine manner. We also provide new insights into Moyamoya disease pathophysiology that may be helpful for preventive treatment strategies in future. PMID:27381827\n\n[Moyamoya disease as a rare cause of ischaemic stroke--case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nKuÅakowska, Alina; Kapica-Topczewska, Katarzyna; Borowik, Helena; Drozdowski, WiesÅaw\n\n2009-10-01\n\nMoyamoya disease is a rare, progressive disease of the vessels diagnosed according to characteristic abnormalities of brain arteries in the angiography. The incidence of moyamoya disease in Europe is lower than in Asia and its clinical course in European population is probably different from Asiatic (older age of onset and rare incidence of hemorrhagic strokes). Two young patients were diagnosed as moyamoya disease on the basis of clinical symptoms (ischaemic stroke) and results of brain vessels' angiography, which documented an occlusion of both internal carotid arteries above branching-off the ocular arteries in the first patient and stenosis of distal internal carotid arteries and proximal medial and anterior cerebral arteries in the second one. Both patients are under control of the Neurological Outpatient Department and their neurological state is stable. Despite that moyamoya disease is a rare cause of ischaemic stroke, it should be always considered as one of etiologic factors, especially in young patients.\n\nOutcome in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease after combined extracranial-intracranial bypass.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Hanqiang; Ni, Wei; Xu, Bin; Lei, Yu; Tian, Yanlong; Xu, Feng; Gu, Yuxiang; Mao, Ying\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe outcome of patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD) after cerebral revascularization is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to delineate the efficacy of this surgical method in the treatment of hemorrhagic MMD. Between January 2007 and August 2011, a consecutive cohort of 113 patients with hemorrhagic MMD was enrolled into this prospective single-center cohort study. The surgical method was combined direct and indirect bypass. The cumulative probability of the primary end point (all stroke and deaths from surgery through 30 days after surgery and ipsilateral recurrent hemorrhage afterward) was analyzed. The angiographic outcome was measured by the following parameters: bypass patency, reduction of basal MMD vessels, improved degree of dilation, and branch extension of the anterior choroidal and posterior communicating arteries (AChA-PCoA). Of the 113 enrolled cases, CT scans revealed pure intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 63 cases (55.7%), pure intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 14 cases (12.4%), and ICH with IVH in 36 cases (31.9%). In 74 of 113 hemorrhagic hemispheres (65.5%), the AChA-PCoA was extremely dilated with extensive branches beyond the choroidal fissure. A total of 114 surgeries were performed. No patient suffered ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke through 30 days after surgery. Ipsilateral rebleeding occurred in 5 patients, 4 of whom died of the rebleeding event. The cumulative probability of the primary end point was 0% at 1 year and 1.9% at 2 years. The annual rebleeding rate was 1.87%/person/year. The improvement in AChA-PCoA extension was observed in 75 of 107 operated hemispheres (70.1%), which was higher than that in 7 of 105 unoperated hemispheres (35.2%). Revascularization may provide a benefit over conservative therapy for hemorrhagic MMD patients. The improvement of dilation and branch extension of AChA-PCoA might be correlated with the low rebleeding rate.\n\nGenetics Home Reference: moyamoya disease\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Thyroid autoantibodies have been found to be associated with the disease, but their clinical significance has never been studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between thyroid autoantibodies and the clinical presentation of moyamoya. This is a prospective study including 37 patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) or unilateral moyamoya (uMM). Thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies (e.g., antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin) were investigated. We studied the effect of gender, age, type of moyamoya (uMM versus MMD), and thyroid autoantibodies on the clinical presentation, dichotomized into aggressive (hemorrhage, major stroke, or frequent transient ischemic attack [TIA]) and nonaggressive presentation (headache, rare TIAs, and incidental diagnosis) according to the criteria of the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis. Of the 37 patients included in the study, the autoantibodies were elevated in 9 (24.3%). An aggressive presentation occurred in 21 patients (hemorrhage in 11, major stroke in 9, frequent TIAs in 1). The autoantibodies were elevated in 8 of the 21 patients (38.09%) with an aggressive presentation and in 1 of those presenting with minor symptoms (6.2%). The presence of elevated autoantibodies was the only variable associated with an aggressive presentation in the multivariate logistic analysis (Pâ=â.048). When the serum concentration of the thyroid autoantibodies is increased, the patients have a higher risk of an aggressive presentation. Our results support the hypothesis that activation of immune-mediated processes affects the moyamoya physiopathology. Copyright Â© 2018 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

PBMCs were reprogrammed using Sendai virus particles delivering the four Yamanaka factors. A footprint-free hiPSC line was characterized by the expression of pluripotency markers and a normal karyotype. These cells were able to give rise to Embryoid Bodies and to a progeny of differentiated cells belonging to the 3 germ layers. This hiPSC line represents a suitable tool for modelling in vitro MMD disease to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the occurrence of this pathology. Copyright Â© 2016.

Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy that occurs due to \"cytochrome c oxidase deficiency\" characterized by psychomotor retardation, difficulty in eating, seizures, hypotonia, respiratory disorders and high lactate levels. Many diseases and syndromes have been defined that are associated with Moyamoya disease. To the best of our knowledge, the association of moyamoya disease with Leigh syndrome has not been defined as yet. In this study, the clinical and imaging results of a 3-year-old male child displaying the association of Moyamoya disease and Leigh syndrome are presented.\n\nAssociation between Champagne Bottle Neck Sign of Internal Carotid Artery and Ipsilateral Hemorrhagic Stroke in Patients with Moyamoya Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jian; Chen, Gong; Yang, Yongbo; Zhang, Bing; Jia, Zhongzhi; Gu, Peiyuan; Wei, Dong; Ji, Jing; Hu, Weixing; Zhao, Xihai\n\n2018-06-15\n\nTo assess the association between champagne bottle neck sign (CBNS) in carotid artery and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). From January 2016 to December 2017, a total of 76 consecutive patients with MMD without definite risk factors associated intracranial hemorrhage who underwent preoperative angiography were included in this retrospective study. CBNS was defined as luminal diameter of internal carotid artery (ICA)/common carotid artery (CCA) â¤ 0.5 on angiographic imaging. The right and left cerebral hemisphere in each patient was separately identified as hemorrhagic and none-hemorrhagic. The association between CBNS and intracranial hemorrhage was analyzed. Of 76 MMD patients, intracranial hemorrhage was found in 44 (28.9%) hemispheres of 152 and 6.8% (3/44) had multiple events. Compared carotid arteries without intracranial hemorrhage in the ipsilateral hemispheres, those with intracranial hemorrhage in the ipsilateral hemispheres had significantly smaller luminal diameter ratio of ICA/CCA (0.49 Â± 0.11 vs. 0.55 Â± 0.12, p < 0.01) and higher prevalence of CBNS (63.7% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.01). For hemispheres with intracranial hemorrhage, those with ipsilateral carotid artery CBNS had significantly higher prevalence of hemorrhage at posterior territories than those without (57.1% vs. 23.1%, p=0.05). Logistic regression revealed that CBNS was significantly associated with ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage before (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.19-5.05; p=0.02) and after (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.50-7.87; p<0.01) adjusted for female, lenticulostriate anastomosis, and choroidal anastomosis. CBNS is significantly associated with intracranial hemorrhage at ipsilateral hemisphere in MMD patients, particularly for intracranial hemorrhage at posterior territories. Copyright Â© 2018.

Although relationships between Graves' disease and cerebrovascular accidents in Moyamoya disease are obscure, the coexistence of the two diseases is noteworthy. Moyamoya disease has been rarely reported in adolescent patients with thyrotoxicosis. Recently, we encountered two adolescent Korean patients with Moyamoya disease associated with Graves' disease who presented with episodic right-sided hemiparesis and syncope. These two girls who had Graves' disease had no history of other diseases or head trauma. A thyroid function test revealed a euthyroid state and a high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody titer at that time. The patients were diagnosed with Moyamoya disease based on brain magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral four-vessel angiography. The patients underwent cranial revascularization by encephalo-duroarterio-synangiosis as soon as a diagnosis was made, which resulted in successful symptom resolution. They fared well and had no additional neurological symptoms as of their last follow-up visits. Here, we report these two cases of confirmed Moyamoya disease complicated by Graves' disease with a review of the literature, and discuss the possible association between the two diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first report in South Korea on Moyamoya disease associated with Graves' disease in adolescents with a euthyroid.\n\nMoyamoya vasculopathy - Patient demographics and characteristics in the Finnish population.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaarela, Marika; Mustanoja, Satu; Pekkola, Johanna; Tyni, Tiina; Hernesniemi, Juha; Kivipelto, Leena; Tatlisumak, Turgut\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground and purpose Moyamoya vasculopathy, a rare steno-occlusive progressive cerebrovascular disorder, has not been thoroughly studied in Caucasian populations. We established a registry of Finnish patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital, to collect and report demographic and clinical data. Methods We collected data both retrospectively and prospectively from all the patients with a moyamoya vasculopathy referred to our hospital between January 1987 and December 2014. All patients underwent a neurological outpatient clinic visit. Results We diagnosed 61 patients (50 females, 10 children) with moyamoya vasculopathy. The mean age at the disease-onset was 31.5âÂ±â17.9 years. The two most common presenting symptoms were ischemic stroke (nâ=â31) and hemorrhage (nâ=â8). Forty-four percent underwent revascularization surgery, and 70% were prescribed antithrombotic treatment. Conclusions The results support in part the Western phenotype of the disease considering the later presentation and larger female predominance compared to the Asian moyamoya vasculopathy reports. However, the proportion of ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes is closer to Japanese population than German population. The absence of familial cases points to a different genetic profile in the Finnish patients.\n\nEffect of Aspirin in Postoperative Management of Adult Ischemic Moyamoya Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yahui; Zhang, Qian; Zhang, Dong; Zhao, Yuanli\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAspirin has been implicated in the postoperative management of moyamoya disease (MMD) in order to avoid bypass failure and decrease the incidence of subsequent stroke. However, its effect has not been completely determined yet. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed data of 184 adult patients (197 hemispheres) presented with ischemic-onset MMD who had undergone direct or combined revascularization in our hospital, to clarify the effect of postoperative aspirin therapy in the management of moyamoya disease. Fifty-nine hemispheres that had been administered with aspirin (100 mg/day) after bypass surgery were defined as the \"aspirin group,\" whereas 138 that hadn't been given aspirin postoperatively were defined as the \"control group\". Among 197 hemispheres, the mortality rate was 0. The incidence of postoperative newly developed infarction, transient ischemic attack, and hemorrhage were not significantly different between the aspirin and control groups. The patency rate of bypass graft was not significantly different between the groups, either. Notably, more patients experienced major stroke in the control group (9/138) than the aspirin group (1/59), but no statistical difference was found (P > 0.05). In the aspirin group, more patients had improved outcome than the control group (PÂ =Â 0.04). Our findings showed that aspirin might not decrease the incidence of postoperative ischemic stroke or increase patency rate of bypass graft, but it does not increase the risk of hemorrhages, either. Also, postoperative aspirin therapy might improve outcome. More studies are needed to provide evidence for postoperative antiplatelet therapy in MMD management. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We present revascularization surgery experience and results in both moyamoya disease and occlusive cerebral ischaemia. Patients with ischaemic occlusive disease and moyamoya disease who underwent microsurgical revascularization between October 2014 and September 2017 were analysed. In the study period, 23 patients with occlusive ischaemic disease underwent microsurgical revascularization. Three patients presented with serious postoperative complications (2 intraparenchymal haemorrhages in the immediate postoperative period and one thrombosis of the femoral artery). All patients, except one, achieved normalization of the cerebral hemodynamic reserve (CHR) in the SPECT study. Twenty patients had a good neurological result, with no ischaemic recurrence of the revascularized territory. Among patients with moyamoya, 20 had moyamoya disease and 5 had moyamoya syndrome with unilateral involvement. Five patients were treated at paediatric age. Haemorrhagic onset occurred in 2 patients. The CHR study showed hemodynamic compromise in all patients. Cerebral SPECT at one year showed resolution of the hemodynamic failure in all patients. There have been 4 postoperative complications (acute subdural hematoma, two subdural collections and one dehiscence of the surgical wound). No patient presented with neurological worsening at 6 and 12months of follow-up. Cerebral revascularization through end-to-side anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery is an indisputable technique in the treatment of moyamoya disease and possibly in a subgroup of patients with symptomatic occlusive ischaemic cerebrovascular disease.

Although aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke are leading causes of morbidity and death in these patients, MOPD II is rarely examined in the neurosurgical literature. The authors report their experience with 3 patients who presented with MOPD II, which includes a patient with 8 aneurysms (the most aneurysms reported in the literature), and the first report of a patient with both moyamoya disease and multiple aneurysms. The poor natural history of these lesions indicates aggressive microsurgical and/or endovascular therapy. Microsurgery, whether for aneurysm clip placement or extracranial-intracranial bypass, is challenging due to tight surgical corridors and diminutive arteries in these patients, but is technically feasible and strongly indicated when multiple aneurysms must be treated or cerebral revascularization is needed.\n\nRNF213 Rare Variants in Slovakian and Czech Moyamoya Disease Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobayashi, Hatasu; Brozman, Miroslav; KyselovÃ¡, KateÅina; ViszlayovÃ¡, DaÅ¡a; Morimoto, Takaaki; Roubec, Martin; Å koloudÃ­k, David; PetroviÄovÃ¡, Andrea; JuskaniÄ, Dominik; Strauss, Jozef; Halaj, MariÃ¡n; Kurray, Peter; Hranai, MariÃ¡n; Harada, Kouji H; Inoue, Sumiko; Yoshida, Yukako; Habu, Toshiyuki; Herzig, Roman; Youssefian, Shohab; Koizumi, Akio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRNF213/Mysterin has been identified as a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disease characterized by occlusive lesions in the circle of Willis. The p.R4810K (rs112735431) variant is a founder polymorphism that is strongly associated with moyamoya disease in East Asia. Many non-p.R4810K rare variants of RNF213 have been identified in white moyamoya disease patients, although the ethnic mutations have not been investigated in this population. In the present study, we screened for RNF213 variants in 19 Slovakian and Czech moyamoya disease patients. A total of 69 RNF213 coding exons were directly sequenced in 18 probands and one relative who suffered from moyamoya disease in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. We previously reported one proband harboring RNF213 p.D4013N. Results from the present study identified four rare variants other than p.D4013N (p.R4019C, p.E4042K, p.V4146A, and p.W4677L) in four of the patients. P.V4146A was determined to be a novel de novo mutation, and p.R4019C and p.E4042K were identified as double mutations inherited on the same allele. P.W4677L, found in two moyamoya disease patients and an unaffected subject in the same pedigree, was a rare single nucleotide polymorphism. Functional analysis showed that RNF213 p.D4013N, p.R4019C and p.V4146A-transfected human umbilical vein endothelial cells displayed significant lowered migration, and RNF213 p.V4146A significantly reduced tube formation, indicating that these are disease-causing mutations. Results from the present study identified RNF213 rare variants in 22.2% (4/18 probands) of Slovakian and Czech moyamoya disease patients, confirming that RNF213 may also be a major causative gene in a relative large population of white patients.\n\nRNF213 Rare Variants in Slovakian and Czech Moyamoya Disease Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKyselovÃ¡, KateÅina; ViszlayovÃ¡, DaÅ¡a; Morimoto, Takaaki; Roubec, Martin; Å koloudÃ­k, David; PetroviÄovÃ¡, Andrea; JuskaniÄ, Dominik; Strauss, Jozef; Halaj, MariÃ¡n; Kurray, Peter; Hranai, MariÃ¡n; Harada, Kouji H.; Inoue, Sumiko; Yoshida, Yukako; Habu, Toshiyuki; Herzig, Roman; Youssefian, Shohab; Koizumi, Akio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRNF213/Mysterin has been identified as a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disease characterized by occlusive lesions in the circle of Willis.

P.W4677L, found in two moyamoya disease patients and an unaffected subject in the same pedigree, was a rare single nucleotide polymorphism. Functional analysis showed that RNF213 p.D4013N, p.R4019C and p.V4146A-transfected human umbilical vein endothelial cells displayed significant lowered migration, and RNF213 p.V4146A significantly reduced tube formation, indicating that these are disease-causing mutations. Results from the present study identified RNF213 rare variants in 22.2% (4/18 probands) of Slovakian and Czech moyamoya disease patients, confirming that RNF213 may also be a major causative gene in a relative large population of white patients.

This report describes a patient with moyamoya disease who experienced rapid disease progression, resulting in cerebral infarction and a wide area of diminished cerebral perfusion. Double superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomoses were utilized to immediately increase cerebral perfusion in the affected area. This case involved a 5-year-old girl who had been diagnosed with moyamoya disease and had undergone STA-MCA anastomosis with indirect bypass in the right hemisphere at the age of 3. At the time of presentation, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed cerebral infarction at the left frontal lobe, and MR angiography showed rapidly progressive narrowing of the left MCA that had not been present 3 months prior. N-isopropyl-p-[I123] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (IMP-SPECT) showed markedly decreased uptake in the left hemisphere. She underwent emergent STA-MCA double anastomoses with indirect bypass on the left side. IMP-SPECT showed marked increase in uptake in the left hemisphere. The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory adjacent to the cerebral infarction also showed increased uptake on the SPECT. Postoperatively, there were no clinical or radiographic indications of ischemic or hemorrhagic complications. Double anastomoses are effective in quickly and significantly increasing blood flow. The postoperative course in this case was uneventful.

This study aimed to clarify the risk factors associated with postoperative ischemic complications and to discuss the appropriate perioperative management. Fifty-eight revascularization operations were performed in 37 children with moyamoya disease. Patients with moyamoya syndrome were excluded from this study. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 7 days after surgery. Postoperative cerebral infarction was defined as a diffusion-weighted imaging high-intensity lesion with or without symptoms. We usually use fentanyl and dexmedetomidine as postoperative analgesic and sedative drugs for patients with moyamoya disease. We used barbiturate coma therapy for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease who have all postoperative cerebral infarction risk factors. Postoperative ischemic complications were observed in 10.3% of the children with moyamoya disease (6Â of 58). Preoperative cerebral infarctions (PÂ = 0.0005), younger age (PÂ = 0.038), higher Suzuki grade (PÂ = 0.003), and posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion (PÂ =Â 0.003) were related to postoperative ischemic complications. Postoperative cerebral infarction occurred all pediatric patients using barbiturate coma therapy. The risk factors associated with postoperative ischemic complications for children with moyamoya disease are preoperative infarction, younger age, higher Suzuki grade, and posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion. Barbiturate coma therapy for pediatric patients with moyamoya disease who have the previous risk factors is insufficient for prevention of postoperative cerebral infarction. More studies are needed to identify the appropriate perioperative management. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Korean patients with moyamoya disease (nâ=â107, mean age, 20.9Â±15.9 years; 66.4% female) and 243 healthy control subjects (mean age, 23.0Â±16.1 years; 56.8% female) were included. The subjects were divided into pediatric and adult groups. Among the 64 surgical patients, we evaluated collateral vessel formation after 2 years and divided patients into good (collateral grade A) or poor (collateral grade B and C) groups. The frequencies and distributions of four VEGF (â2578, â1154, â634, and 936) and KDR (â604, 1192, and 1719) polymorphisms were assessed from patients with moyamoya disease and compared to the control group. No differences were observed in VEGF â2578, â1154, â634, and 936 or KDR â604, 1192, and 1719 polymorphisms between the control group and moyamoya disease group. However, we found the â634CC genotype occurred less frequently in the pediatric moyamoya group (pâ=â0.040) whereas the KDR â604C/1192A/1719T haplotype increased the risk of pediatric moyamoya (pâ=â0.024). Patients with the CC genotype of VEGF â634 had better collateral vessel formation after surgery. Our results suggest that the VEGF â634G allele is associated with pediatric moyamoya disease and poor collateral vessel formation.

In our case, we describe a unique aneurismal location and its management. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman affected by a Moyamoya disease who displayed a frontal lobe hematoma. The origin of the bleeding came from the rupture of a posterior ethmoidal artery aneurysm that was treated surgically with favourable outcome. This case of a ruptured posterior ethmoidal artery aneurysm in a Moyamoya patient illustrates the polymorphism of the vascular complications encountered in this disease. It stresses the need to obtain information from an angiographic investigation in order to select the best therapeutic option and to reduce procedural complications.

Thyroid storm may cause cerebral ischemia in Moyamoya disease, which can coexist in patients with Graves' disease. A 16-year-old girl complaining of dizziness and palpitations visited the emergency department and was diagnosed with DKA combined with hyperthyroidism. A thyroid storm occurred 6 h after the start of DKA management. Her Burch and Wartofsky score was 65 points. Right hemiplegia developed during the thyroid storm, and brain magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted images revealed multiple acute infarcts in both hemispheres. MR angiography showed stenosis of both distal internal carotid arteries and both M1 portions of the middle cerebral arteries, consistent with Moyamoya disease. After acute management for the thyroid storm with methimazole, Lugol solution and hydrocortisone, the patient's neurological symptoms completely resolved within 1 month, and free T4 level normalized within 2 months. Thyroid storm may trigger cerebral ischemia in Moyamoya disease and lead to rapid progression of cerebrovascular occlusive disease. As a simultaneous occurrence of DKA, thyroid storm and cerebrovascular accident in Moyamoya disease highly elevates morbidity and mortality, prompt recognition and management are critical to save the patient's life.\n\nCase of moyamoya disease in a patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharfstein, Sophia R; Ahmed, Shadab; Islam, Mohammed Q; Najjar, Mamoun I; Ratushny, Vladimir\n\n2007-01-01\n\nMoyamoya disease is an occlusion of the terminal portion of internal carotid arteries and proximal portion of middle and anterior cerebral arteries of unknown origin. Moyamoya syndrome is associated with meningitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, head trauma, head irradiation, brain tumor, von Recklinghausen's disease, tuberous sclerosis, Marfan syndrome, sickle cell anemia, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, and oral contraceptive use. To our knowledge, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a cause of moyamoya syndrome has not been reported in an adult population. We report a case of moyamoya syndrome in a patient with AIDS and without other conditions associated with occlusion of the circle of Willis and formation of collateral network at the base of the brain and basal ganglia. We present a case report. A 29-year-old woman with an 8-year history of AIDS on multiple antiretroviral medications presented with recurrent tingling of the left extremities which 1 month later progressed to mild hemiparesis and dysarthria. During the next few months the patient developed progressive cognitive decline and on-and-off fluctuations in the degree of hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple small subcortical infarct's in both parietal lobes. Magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of middle cerebral arteries distal internal carotid arteries, with prominent collateral network. Cerebral angiography confirmed moyamoya pattern. Lumbar puncture showed: white blood cell count 1, red blood cell count 418, protein 56, glucose 53, negative bacterial and acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, negative VDRL test, India ink, cryptococcal antigen, cytology and negative polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2.

The present study evaluated the effect of the free radical scavenger edaravone on postoperative hyperperfusion in adult moyamoya disease. This study included 92 hemispheres in 72 adult patients who underwent direct bypass for moyamoya disease. Serial measurements of cerebral blood flow were conducted immediately after surgery and on postoperative days 2 and 7. In 40 hemispheres for 36 patients, edaravone (60 mg/d) was administered from the day of surgery to postsurgical day 7. The incidence of postoperative hyperperfusion and associated TNDs were compared with a control group that included 52 hemispheres in 36 patients. Radiological hyperperfusion was observed in 28 of 40 (70.0%) and 39 of 52 (75.0%) hemispheres in the edaravone and control groups, respectively (P=0.30). Hyperperfusion-related TND incidences were significantly lower in the edaravone group compared with the control group (12.5% versus 32.7%; P=0.024). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that edaravone administration (P=0.009) and left-sided surgery (P=0.037) were significantly correlated with hyperperfusion-related TNDs (odds ratios, 0.3 and 4.2, respectively). Perioperative administration of edaravone reduced the incidence of hyperperfusion-related TNDs after direct bypass procedures in adult patients with moyamoya disease.

The typical moyamoya vessels, which originate from an initial stenosis of the internal carotid, highlight that increased and/or abnormal angiogenic, vasculogenic and arteriogenic processes are involved in the disease pathophysiology. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge on the most important signaling pathways involved in MMD vessel formation, particularly focusing on the expression of growth factors and function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Higher plasma concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase, hepatocyte growth factor, and interleukin-1Î² were reported in MMD. A specific higher level of basic fibroblast growth factor was also found in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients. Finally, the number and the functionality of EPCs were found to be increased. In spite of the available data, the approaches and findings reported so far do not give an evident correlation between the expression levels of the aforementioned growth factors and MMD severity. Furthermore, the controversial results provided by studies on EPCs, do not permit to understand the true involvement of these cells in MMD pathophysiology. Further studies should thus be implemented to extend our knowledge on processes regulating both the arterial stenosis and the excessive formation of collateral vessels. Moreover, we suggest advances of integrated approaches and functional assays to correlate biological and clinical data, arguing for the development of new therapeutic applications for MMD.\n\nMoyamoya disease in two patients with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair.\n\nPubMed\n\nLo, Fu-Sung; Wang, Chao-Jan; Wong, Mun-Ching; Lee, Ni-Chung\n\n2015-06-01\n\nMoyamoya disease is a unique chronic cerebrovascular condition caused by progressive stenosis of the arteries around the circle of Willis with prominent arterial collateral circulation.

She had a history of Moyamoya disease and pituitary gigantism since childhood. Her ejection fraction on echocardiogram was 20% and a perfusion defect with partial reversibility in the anterior wall was demonstrated on stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Diagnostic coronary angiogram revealed critical stenosis in the middle left anterior descending artery, which was treated by coronary stenting.

However, the anterior branch frequently courses within the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone and can easily be damaged during craniotomy for bypass surgery. This prospective study aimed to study the surgical anatomy of the MMA and to establish the technique to preserve it during bypass surgery for moyamoya disease. Twenty-two patients with moyamoya disease underwent STA-MCA anastomosis combined with indirect bypass on 27 sides. The anatomical relationship between the anterior branch of the MMA and lesser wing was classified into three types: the bridge, monorail, and tunnel types. During surgery, the lesser wing was carefully resected with a rongeur or high-speed diamond drill to preserve the anterior branch of the MMA. The anterior branch of the MMA was classified into the bridge type in 5 sides (18.5 %), monorail type in 10 sides (37.0 %), and tunnel type in 12 sides (44.5 %). Patient age was closely related to the anatomical findings (Ï (2) test, pâ=â0.0168). Careful resection of the lesser wing with a rongeur could preserve bridge- and monorail-type MMAs (100 and 71.4 %, respectively). However, drilling out of the lesser wing under a surgical microscope was essential to preserve the tunnel-type MMA. Intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography was useful to confirm patency during surgery. It is essential to understand the surgical anatomy of the MMA around the pterion in order to preserve its anterior branch during bypass surgery for moyamoya disease.\n\nMoyamoya disease and artery tortuosity as rare phenotypes in a patient with an elastin mutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nIshiwata, Tsukasa; Tanabe, Nobuhiro; Shigeta, Ayako; Yokota, Hajime; Tsushima, Kenji; Terada, Jiro; Sakao, Seiichiro; Morisaki, Hiroko; Morisaki, Takayuki; Tatsumi, Koichiro\n\n2016-07-01\n\nSporadic and familial elastin mutations can occur in large vessel stenosis such as supravalvular aortic stenosis and narrowing of the descending aorta.

These reports have been limited to pediatric patients presenting with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or headaches. Management has primarily been pharmacologic, with only one prior report of surgical revascularization to our knowledge. We report four cases of Noonan syndrome patients presenting with headaches and/or sensorimotor strokes in childhood that caused unilateral sensorimotor impairment. Cerebral angiography and MRI revealed bilateral moyamoya syndrome. All patients underwent successful bilateral extracranial-to-intracranial revascularization. The first patient was a 10-year-old girl who presented following a hemorrhagic stroke and recovered well after indirect bypass. The second patient was an adult with a history of childhood stroke whose symptoms progressed in adulthood. She underwent a direct bypass and improved, but continued to experience TIA at her 4 year follow-up. The third patient was a 7-year-old girl with headaches and a new onset TIA who failed pharmacological therapy and subsequently underwent bilateral indirect bypass. The fourth patient was a 24-year-old woman with worsening headaches and an occluded left middle cerebral artery from unilateral moyamoya syndrome. A left sided direct bypass was completed given delayed MRI perfusion with poor augmentation. To our knowledge these are the first reported surgical cases of combined Noonan and moyamoya syndrome. These cases highlight the need to recognize moyamoya syndrome in patients with Noonan syndrome. Early surgical revascularization should be pursued in order to prevent symptom progression.

There is an association between moyamoya vasculopathy and Graves disease, primarily in Asian populations. Here, we present the largest series of non-Asian, predominantly Latino patients with moyamoya vasculopathy in the setting of Graves thyrotoxicosis, as well as the largest review of the literature to date. We retrospectively analyzed patients presenting with stroke in the setting of clinical Graves disease to our institution from 2004 to 2014. Moyamoya vasculopathy was diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography in all patients. Eight patients with Graves disease thyrotoxicosis and moyamoya vasculopathy were identified. Six patients were effectively managed with aggressive medical management using antithyroid and antiplatelet medications. No recurrent strokes were noted once thyrotoxicosis was controlled. Intracranial bypass was necessary in 2 patients who failed medical management. Seventy-nine additional cases were reported from the literature. There was no significant difference in clinical improvement between medical therapy alone and medical therapy with neurosurgical prophylaxis (87.0% vs. 88.0%, respectively; PÂ = 0.94). Moyamoya vasculopathy associated with Graves disease thyrotoxicosis in non-Asian women may be more common than previously thought. In addition, our series suggests that thyrotoxicosis promotes the progression of vasculopathy. Based on our review, there is no significant difference in clinical improvement between proper medical and surgical therapies. Aggressive medical therapy should be considered first-line treatment for moyamoya vasculopathy with Graves thyrotoxicosis, with neurosurgical rescue reserved for medically refractory cases.

The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. A prospective study was conducted in 78 subjects with moyamoya disease (of whom 31 underwent unilateral direct arterial anastomosis). The concordance between the cerebrovascular reactivity index values from arterial spin labeling and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was assessed by using Bland-Altman analysis, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of arterial spin labeling to depict impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (in which the cerebrovascular reactivity index value is less than 0% on SPECT images). The cerebrovascular reactivity index from arterial spin labeling had a lower value than that from SPECT (mean difference, -4.2%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for arterial spin labeling in the detection of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity was at least 0.85. On the anastomotic side, a significant increase was found between the cerebrovascular reactivity index values on arterial spin labeling images obtained preoperatively and those obtained 6 months after surgery, as well as on SPECT images (mean Â± standard deviation values of cerebrovascular reactivity index increased by 5.9% Â± 10.9 and 3.0% Â± 6.3 for arterial spin labeling and SPECT, respectively). Arterial spin labeling has excellent performance in the identification of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with moyamoya disease, and it has the potential to serve as a noninvasive imaging tool to monitor cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with moyamoya disease.

To date, the pathogenesis of Moyamoya is unknown. Improved understanding of the changes to vascular geometry and fluid mechanics of the carotid siphon during disease may improve understanding of the pathogenesis, prognosis techniques and disease management. A retrospective analysis of Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) images was performed for Moyamoya pediatric patients (MMD) (nÂ =Â 23) and control (Ctrl) pediatric patients (nÂ =Â 20). The Ctrl group was composed of patients who complained of headache and had normal MRA. We performed segmentation of MRA images to quantify geometric parameters of the artery. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was performed to quantify the hemodynamic parameters. MMD internal carotid and carotid siphons were smaller in cross-sectional areas, and shorter in curved vascular length. Vascular curvature remained constant over age and vascular size and did not change between Ctrl and MMD, but MMD carotid siphon had lower tortuosity in the posterior bend, and higher torsion in the anterior bend. Wall shear stress and secondary flows were significantly lower in MMD, but the ratio of secondary flow kinetic energy to primary flow kinetic energy were similar between MMD and Ctrl. There were alterations to both the geometry and the flow mechanics of the carotid siphons of Moyamoya patients but it is unclear whether hemodynamics is the cause or the effect of morphological changes observed.\n\nMedical management of moyamoya disease and recurrent stroke in an infant with Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II).\n\nPubMed\n\nKÄ±lÄ±Ã§, Esra; Utine, Eda; Unal, Sule; HaliloÄlu, GÃ¶knur; OÄuz, Kader Karli; Cetin, Mualla; BoduroÄlu, Koray; Alanay, Yasemin\n\n2012-10-01\n\nWe report an infant diagnosed with Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II at age 8 months, who experienced cerebrovascular morbidities related to this entity. Molecular analysis identified c.2609+1 G>A, intron 14, homozygous splice site mutation in the pericentrin gene. At age 18 months, she developed recurrent strokes and hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography showed abnormal gyral pattern, cortical acute infarcts, bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid arteries and reduced flow on the cerebral arteries, consistent with moyamoya disease. In Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II, life expectancy is reduced because of high risk of stroke secondary to cerebral vascular anomalies (aneurysms, moyamoya disease). Periodic screening for vascular events is recommended in individuals with Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II every 12-18 months following diagnosis. Our patient was medically managed with low molecular weight heparin followed with aspirin prophylaxis, in addition to carbamazepine and physical rehabilitation. We report an infant with moyamoya disease and recurrent stroke presenting 10 months after diagnosis (at age 18 months), and discuss the outcome of nonsurgical medical management. The presented case is the second youngest case developing stroke and moyamoya disease.\n\nHow to minimize ischemic complication related to swollen temporalis muscle following indirect revascularization surgery in moyamoya disease: a technical report.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoo, Sung Pil; Kim, Tae Sun; Moon, Hyung Sik\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThere are several reports in the literature of postoperative ischemic events due to swelling of the temporalis muscle after indirect revascularization surgery. Here, we report our surgical technique for preventing ischemic events during the acute postoperative recovery period in moyamoya patients. We used various types of titanium mesh to cover the bony defect area in 8 patients (10 operations) with moyamoya disease. The mesh was cut and manipulated according to the shape of the bony defect. Surgical results were favorable, with no newly developed ischemic event or infarction in the acute recovery period. The mesh formed an outer table of skull, so there was no compressive effect on the temporalis muscle and no cosmetic defects. The titanium mesh appears to be effective and useful for prevention of ischemic insult in the treatment of moyamoya disease. The choice of this procedure depends on both the operative findings of temporalis muscle thickness and the status of ischemic vulnerability of moyamoya brain.

Occurring in 1 in 10,000 children without sex preference, it is the most common primordial microcephalic osteodysplastic dwarfism and has been associated with a variety of congenital brain malformations and intracranial aneurysms. Moyamoya syndrome is an idiopathic, chronic, progressive cerebrovascular disorder marked by stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and concurrent development of hypertrophied collateral vessels. These tortuous arterial collaterals appear radiographically as \"puffs of smoke,\" giving the syndrome its name. In this report, the authors describe the case of a 16-year-old girl with coincident Seckel and moyamoya syndromes. To their knowledge, this is the first reported case of such an association being treated with surgical revascularization. The patient presented with persistent headaches and a 2-year history of progressive hand, arm, and face numbness. Imaging studies revealed multiple completed cerebral infarcts, global ischemic changes, and vascular anatomy consistent with moyamoya syndrome. Bilateral pial synangioses successfully revascularized each hemisphere with resolution of the patient's symptoms. The patient died 1 year later of complications related to treatment of a rapidly progressing intracranial aneurysm. This report documents the first case associating moyamoya and Seckel syndromes. In addition, the report reveals the rapid development of an intracranial aneurysm in a patient with this syndrome. When coupled with previous reports of other types of cerebrovascular disease in patients with Seckel syndrome or other primordial dwarfisms, the authors' findings are important because they suggest that physicians treating patients with dwarfism should consider the diagnosis of\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Digital Subtraction Angiography Investigation of Childhood Moyamoya Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSong, Peiji; Qin, Jing; Lun, Han; Qiao, Penggang; Xie, Anming; Li, Gongjie\n\n2017-11-01\n\nBecause digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is not an ideal angiographic examination for moyamoya disease in the pediatric population, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) provides a noninvasive contrast-free angiographic examination; whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior spatial resolution and soft-tissue contrast for lesion assessment. Ninety patients with moyamoya disease were examined by MRI and DSA to assess the distribution of lesions and their diagnostic agreement between modalities. MRI examination revealed 439 lesions. Punctate lesions were the most abundant, followed by patchy lesions. These lesions generally covered a smaller area than the abnormal-vascular corresponding brain parenchyma. Steno-occlusive changes at bilateral anterior, medial, and posterior cerebral arteries were identified by MRA and DSA. MRI showed moderate agreement in identifying lesions after steno-occlusive changes in anterior and medial cerebral arteries, and good agreement in posterior cerebral arteries; 6% to 11% of cases were misdiagnosed by MRA.\n\nElevation of Proenkephalin 143-183 in Cerebrospinal Fluid in Moyamoya Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nYokoyama, Kinya; Maruwaka, Mikio; Yoshikawa, Kazuhiro; Araki, Yoshio; Okamoto, Sho; Sumitomo, Masaki; Kawamura, Akino; Sakamoto, Yusuke; Shimizu, Kenzo; Izumi, Takashi; Wakabayashi, Toshihiko\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn moyamoya disease (MMD), the causes of differences in clinical features between children and adults and of the dramatic temporal changes in moyamoya vessels are poorly understood. We previously discovered elevated levels of m/z 4588 and m/z 4473 peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with MMD. This study examined the amino acid sequences of these peptides and quantified in specimens. The m/z 4588 and m/z 4473 peptides in CSF from patients with MMD were purified and concentrated by high-performance liquid chromatography and ultrafiltration. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify the amino acid sequences of these peptides. We quantified these peptides in samples using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and concentrations in CSF were compared between MMD (nÂ = 40, 19 male; median age, 37 years) and non-MMD intracranial disease (nÂ = 40, 19 male; median age, 39 years) as controls. These peptides were identified as proenkephalin 143-183 (PENK 143-183). The concentration of PENK 143-183 was significantly greater in patients with MMD (median, 8,270 pmol/L) than control patients (median, 3,760 pmol/L; P < 0.001) and decreased in an age-dependent manner in MMD (rÂ =Â -0.57; P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in children (age <18 years) was 0.885 (95% confidence interval 0.741-1). The correlation between proenkephalin concentration and temporal changes in moyamoya vessels was suggested. Proenkephalin 143-183 in CSF may offer a helpful diagnostic biomarker in pediatric MMD. The effect of enkephalin peptides through opioid growth factor receptor or delta opioid receptor might be associated with the pathophysiology of MMD. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-two patients with moyamoya disease (9 men and 13 women) with a mean age of 9.3 years (range: 4-22 years) were enrolled in this study. Perfusion MRI was performed by scanning the patients7.5 cm upward from the base of the cerebellum before their being process for post-treatment. The scan led to the acquisition of the following four map images: the cerebral blood volume (CBV), the cerebral blood flow (CBF), the mean transit time (MTT) for the contrast medium, and the time to peak (TTP) for the contrast medium. The lesions were assessed using the CBV, the CBF, the MTT and the TTP maps of perfusion MRI; the MTT and the TTP were measured in the lesion areas, as well as in the normal and the symmetric areas. Perfusion defects were recognizable in all four perfusion MRI maps, and the MTT and the TTP showed a conspicuous delay in the parts where perfusion defects were recognized. The MTT and the TTP images of perfusion MRI reflected a significant correlation between the degrees of stenosis and occlusion in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), as well as the development of collateral vessels. The four perfusion MRI maps could be used to predict the degrees of stenosis and occlusion in the posterior circulation, as well as the development of the collateral vessels, which enabled a hemodynamic evaluation of the parts with perfusion defects. Overall, perfusion MRI is useful for the diagnosis and the treatment of moyamoya disease and can be applied to clinical practice.\n\nNeurologic improvement without angiographic improvement after antithyroid therapy in a patient with Moyamoya syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nIshigami, Akiko; Toyoda, Kazunori; Suzuki, Rieko; Miyashita, Fumio; Iihara, Koji; Minematsu, Kazuo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMoyamoya disease with special complications, including Graves' disease, is called as moyamoya syndrome. A 22-year-old Japanese woman had left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction complicated with Graves' disease. She had right-sided hemiparesis that deteriorated on day 8 with the infarct growth and thyrotoxicosis. On angiogram, the left MCA was occluded at the origin without moyamoya vessels. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed misery-perfusion phenomenon in the left MCA territory. After initiation of the antithyroid therapy, her hemiparesis became milder. Seventeen months later, her thyroid function was normalized and net-like collateral moyamoya vessels proliferated in the left MCA territory. Misery-perfusion phenomenon persisted on PET. This report is unique in the pointÂ of neurologic recovery of the moyamoya patient right after initiation of antithyroid medication without radiological improvement.

Design Retrospective, multicentre, non-randomised, observational study. Setting Nationwide registry data in Japan. Participants A total of 1925 patients with non-haemorrhagic moyamoya disease admitted between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2014 in Japan. Main outcome measure We performed propensity score-matched analysis to examine the association between prehospital antiplatelet use and no significant disability on hospital admission, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1. Results Propensity-matched patients who received prehospital antiplatelet drugs were associated with a good outcome on hospital admission (OR adjusted for all covariates, 3.82; 95% CI 1.22 to 11.99) compared with those who did not receive antiplatelet drugs prior to hospital admission. Conclusions Prehospital antiplatelet use was significantly associated with good functional status on hospital admission among patients with non-haemorrhagic moyamoya disease in Japan. Our results suggest that prehospital antiplatelet use should be considered when evaluating outcomes of patients with non-haemorrhagic moyamoya disease. PMID:27008684\n\nClinical Significance of the Champagne Bottle Neck Sign in the Extracranial Carotid Arteries of Patients with Moyamoya Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nYasuda, C; Arakawa, S; Shimogawa, T; Kanazawa, Y; Sayama, T; Haga, S; Morioka, T\n\n2016-05-26\n\nThe champagne bottle neck sign represents a rapid reduction in the extracranial ICA diameters and is a characteristic feature of Moyamoya disease. However, the clinical significance of the champagne bottle neck sign is unclear. We investigated the relationship between the champagne bottle neck sign and the clinical and hemodynamic stages of Moyamoya disease. We analyzed 14 patients with Moyamoya disease before revascularization (5 men, 9 women; age, 43.2 Â± 19.3 years). The ratio of the extracranial ICA and common carotid artery diameters was determined using carotid ultrasonography or cerebral angiography; a ratio of < 0.5 was considered champagne bottle neck sign-positive. The clinical disease stage was determined using the Suzuki angiographic grading system. CBF and cerebral vasoreactivity also were measured. The ICA/common carotid artery ratio (expressed as median [interquartile range]) decreased as the clinical stage advanced (stages I-II, 0.71 [0.60-0.77]; stages III-IV, 0.49 [0.45-0.57]; stages V-VI, 0.38 [0.34-0.47]; P < .001). Lower ICA/common carotid artery ratio tended to occur in symptomatic versus asymptomatic arteries (0.47 [0.40-0.53] versus 0.57 [0.40-0.66], respectively; P = .06). Although the ICA/common carotid artery ratio was not related to cerebral perfusion, it decreased as cerebral vasoreactivity decreased (P < .01). All champagne bottle neck sign-positive arteries were classified as Suzuki stage â¥III, 73% were symptomatic, and 89% exhibited reduced cerebral vasoreactivity. In contrast, all champagne bottle neck sign-negative arteries were Suzuki stage â¤III, 67% were asymptomatic, and all showed preserved cerebral vasoreactivity. The champagne bottle neck sign was related to advanced clinical stage, clinical symptoms, and impaired cerebral vasoreactivity. Thus, detection of the champagne bottle neck sign might be useful in determining the clinical and hemodynamic stages of Moyamoya disease.

Our aim was to quantitatively assess the neovascularization status after bypass surgery in pediatric Moyamoya disease by using color-coded digital subtraction angiography. Time-attenuation intensity curves were generated at ROIs corresponding to surgical flap sites from color-coded DSA images of the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, and external carotid artery angiograms obtained pre- and postoperatively in 32 children with Moyamoya disease. Time-to-peak and area under the curve values were obtained. Postoperative changes in adjusted time-to-peak (ÎTTP) and ratios of adjusted area under the curve changes (ÎAUC ratio) of common carotid artery, ICA, and external carotid artery angiograms were compared across clinical and angiographic outcome groups. To analyze diagnostic performance, we categorized clinical outcomes into favorable and unfavorable groups. The ÎTTP at the common carotid artery increased among clinical and angiographic outcomes, in that order, with significant differences (P = .003 and .005, respectively). The ÎAUC ratio at the common carotid artery and external carotid artery also increased, in that order, among clinical and angiographic outcomes with a significant difference (all, P = .000). The ÎAUC ratio of ICA showed no significant difference among clinical and angiographic outcomes (P = .418 and .424, respectively). The ÎTTP for the common carotid artery of >1.27 seconds and the ÎAUC ratio of >33.5% for the common carotid artery and 504% for the external carotid artery are revealed as optimal cutoff values between favorable and unfavorable groups. Postoperative changes in quantitative values obtained with color-coded DSA software showed a significant correlation with outcome scores and can be used as objective parameters for predicting the outcome in pediatric Moyamoya disease, with\n\nRadiation-induced moyamoya syndrome\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDesai, Snehal S.; Paulino, Arnold C.; Mai, Wei Y.\n\n2006-07-15\n\nPurpose: The moyamoya syndrome is an uncommon late complication after radiotherapy (RT). Methods and Materials: A PubMed search of English-language articles, with radiation, radiotherapy, and moyamoya syndrome used as search key words, yielded 33 articles from 1967 to 2002. Results: The series included 54 patients with a median age at initial RT of 3.8 years (range, 0.4 to 47). Age at RT was less than 5 years in 56.3%, 5 to 10 years in 22.9%, 11 to 20 years in 8.3%, 21 to 30 years in 6.3%, 31 to 40 years in 2.1%, and 41 to 50 years in 4.2%.moreÂ Â» Fourteen of 54 patients (25.9%) were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). The most common tumor treated with RT was low-grade glioma in 37 tumors (68.5%) of which 29 were optic-pathway glioma. The average RT dose was 46.5 Gy (range, 22-120 Gy). For NF-1-positive patients, the average RT dose was 46.5 Gy, and for NF-1-negative patients, it was 58.1 Gy. The median latent period for development of moyamoya syndrome was 40 months after RT (range, 4-240). Radiation-induced moyamoya syndrome occurred in 27.7% of patients by 2 years, 53.2% of patients by 4 years, 74.5% of patients by 6 years, and 95.7% of patients by 12 years after RT. Conclusions: Patients who received RT to the parasellar region at a young age (<5 years) are the most susceptible to moyamoya syndrome. The incidence for moyamoya syndrome continues to increase with time, with half of cases occurring within 4 years of RT and 95% of cases occurring within 12 years. Patients with NF-1 have a lower radiation-dose threshold for development of moyamoya syndrome.Â«Â less\n\nMoyamoya disease: impact on the performance of oral and written language.\n\nPubMed\n\nLamÃ´nica, DionÃ­sia Aparecida Cusin; Ribeiro, Camila da Costa; Ferraz, PlÃ­nio Marcos Duarte Pinto; Tabaquim, Maria de Lourdes Merighi\n\nMoyamoya disease is an unusual form of occlusive, cerebrovascular disorder that affects the arteries of the central nervous system, causing acquired language alterations and learning difficulties. The study aim was to describe the oral/written language and cognitive skills in a seven-year-and-seven-month-old girl diagnosed with Moyamoya disease. The assessment consisted of interviews with her parents and application of the following instruments: Observation of Communicative Behavior, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Academic Performance Test, Profile of Phonological Awareness, Raven's Progressive Matrices Test, Special Scale, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Two episodes of stroke in the left and right temporal-parietal and left frontal areas occurred until the age of six years and five months. Revascularization surgery and medication treatment were conducted. The audiologic and ophthalmologic assessments indicated normality. At the time of the study, the girl was attending the second grade of elementary school. She presented changes in oral and written language (syllabic-alphabetic), non-naming of all graphemes, low arithmetic and writing means, reading skill below first grade level and psycholinguistic delay, and pre-school level phonological processing skills. The psychological evaluation indicated satisfactory intellectual level; however, it also showed cognitive performance impairment in verbal and execution tasks and limitations on graphic-perceptual-motor skills and sequential logic organization. The stroke episodes influenced the performance of learning processes, affecting the analysis, integration, and interpretation of relevant visual and auditory information.\n\nAcral Hemorrhagic Darier Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlores-Terry, M Ã; GarcÃ­a-Arpa, M; Llamas-Velasco, M; Mendoza-Chaparro, C; Ramos-RodrÃ­guez, C\n\n2017-09-01\n\nDarier disease is an autosomal-dominant inherited condition caused by mutation of a gene, which produces a protein involved in calcium channel regulation. The disease has a variety of manifestations and lacks consistent genotype-phenotype correlations. Acral hemorrhagic Darier disease causes macules, papules, vesicles and/or hemorrhagic blisters on the extremities. Other classic signs of the disease may be present in the same patient or relatives. Histopathology reveals dyskeratosis and suprabasal acantholysis with hemorrhagic lacunae. We report 3 new cases of this type of Darier disease triggered by injuries.

We aim to propose a new classification system for MMD from the perspective of embryology. MMD patients' digital subtraction angiograms were retrospectively analyzed. Every angiogram was analyzed to find the abnormal vessels and from which part of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) the lesions begin. In 262 MMD cases, 32 pediatric patients had PCA involvement, of which 17 were male and 15 were female; 68 adults had PCA involvement, of which 33 were male and 35 were female. The initially affected part of the PCA was compared between sexes and between pediatric and adult patients, and the findings are not statistically significant (PÂ = 0.233, PÂ = 0.855, PÂ = 0.343, respectively). However, of the 100 cases with PCA involvement, only 4 had the lesions begin from the first part of the PCA, and all of the 4 cases had the basilar artery lesions. All the other 96 cases had the lesions begin from the second part of the PCA or from the posterior communication artery, which is derived from the caudal ramus of the primitive intracarotid artery, leaving the first part of the PCA and basilar artery excluded from affection. MMD should be classified into primitive intracarotid artery system-involved type and primitive vertebral basilar artery system-involved type. The reason that the vertebral basilar artery is so rarely involved in MMD might be because of its late development in the brain. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Its susceptibility locus has been mapped to 17q25.3 in Japanese families, but the susceptibility gene is unknown. Genome-wide linkage analysis in eight three-generation families with moyamoya disease revealed linkage to 17q25.3 (P<10(-4)). Fine mapping demonstrated a 1.5-Mb disease locus bounded by D17S1806 and rs2280147. We conducted exome analysis of the eight index cases in these families, with results filtered through Ng criteria. There was a variant of p.N321S in PCMTD1 and p.R4810K in RNF213 in the 1.5-Mb locus of the eight index cases. The p.N321S variant in PCMTD1 could not be confirmed by the Sanger method. Sequencing RNF213 in 42 index cases confirmed p.R4810K and revealed it to be the only unregistered variant. Genotyping 39 SNPs around RNF213 revealed a founder haplotype transmitted in 42 families. Sequencing the 260-kb region covering the founder haplotype in one index case did not show any coding variants except p.R4810K. A case-control study demonstrated strong association of p.R4810K with moyamoya disease in East Asian populations (251 cases and 707 controls) with an odds ratio of 111.8 (Pâ=â10(-119)). Sequencing of RNF213 in East Asian cases revealed additional novel variants: p.D4863N, p.E4950D, p.A5021V, p.D5160E, and p.E5176G. Among Caucasian cases, variants p.N3962D, p.D4013N, p.R4062Q and p.P4608S were identified. RNF213 encodes a 591-kDa cytosolic protein that possesses two functional domains: a Walker motif and a RING finger domain. These exhibit ATPase and ubiquitin ligase activities. Although the mutant alleles (p.R4810K or p.D4013N in the RING domain) did not affect transcription levels or ubiquitination activity, knockdown of RNF213 in zebrafish caused irregular wall formation in trunk arteries and abnormal sprouting vessels. We provide evidence suggesting, for the first time, the involvement of RNF213 in genetic susceptibility to moyamoya disease.\n\n\"Ocular moyamoya\" syndrome in a patient with features of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II.\n\nPubMed\n\nBang, Genie M; Kirmani, Salman; Patton, Alice; Pulido, Jose S; Brodsky, Michael C\n\n2013-02-01\n\nPrimordial dwarfism refers to severely impaired growth beginning early in fetal life.

One hundred seven hemispheres of 58 consecutive patients with moyamoya disease that were analyzed with fused 3-dimensional images of internal carotid angiograms and vertebral angiograms that were marked with different colors were reviewed. Angiographic findings in the posterior watershed area were classified, and the utility of the classification was analyzed by comparing it with clinical presentations and quantitative hemodynamic parameters obtained with positron emission tomography. Two unique angiographic appearances were identified. A vacant vessel appearance (no arterial inflow despite absence of cortical infarction) was observed mostly in transient ischemic attack hemispheres. In hemispheres with a vacant vessel appearance, cerebral blood flow was decreased, cerebral blood volume was increased, and mean transit time was prolonged significantly (Pâ=â.00017, Pâ=â.0061, and Pâ=â.00026, respectively). A cocktail vessel appearance (mixture of carotid and vertebral arterial flow) was most commonly observed in asymptomatic cases, as well as in ischemic hemispheres. Cerebral blood volume increased and mean transit time was prolonged significantly (Pâ=â.036 and Pâ=â.014, respectively) in hemispheres with a cocktail vessel appearance. The trend of progression in hemodynamic severity in the order of normal appearance, cocktail vessel appearance, and vacant vessel appearance in the watershed area was statistically significant. Fused 3-dimensional digital subtraction angiography demonstrated unique angiographic features in the watershed area, and this represented the degree of cerebral hemodynamic impairment in moyamoya disease.

The recent identification of the RNF213 founder mutation (p.R4810K) in the Asian population has made a significant contribution, but the etiology of this disease remains unclear. To further develop the variant landscape of MMD, we performed high-depth whole exome sequencing of 125 unrelated, predominantly nonfamilial, ethnically diverse MMD patients in parallel with 125 internally sequenced, matched controls using the same exome and analysis platform. Three subpopulations were established: Asian, Caucasian, and non-RNF213 founder mutation cases. We provided additional support for the previously observed RNF213 founder mutation (p.R4810K) in Asian cases (P = 6.01Ã10â5) that was enriched among East Asians compared to Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander cases (P = 9.52Ã10â4) and was absent in all Caucasian cases. The most enriched variant in Caucasian (P = 7.93Ã10â4) and non-RNF213 founder mutation (P = 1.51Ã10â3) cases was ZXDC (p.P562L), a gene involved in MHC Class II activation. Collapsing variant methodology ranked OBSCN, a gene involved in myofibrillogenesis, as most enriched in Caucasian (P = 1.07Ã10â4) and non-RNF213 founder mutation cases (P = 5.31Ã10â5). These findings further support the East Asian origins of the RNF213 (p.R4810K) variant and more fully describe the genetic landscape of multiethnic MMD, revealing novel, alternative candidate variants and genes that may be important in MMD etiology and diagnosis.

Whereas direct bypass offers immediate revascularization, indirect bypass can effectively induce collaterals over time. Using angiography and quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, we examined the relative contributions of direct and indirect bypass in moyamoya patients after combined direct superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass and indirect encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS). A retrospective review of moyamoya patients undergoing combined STA-MCA bypass and EDAS was conducted, excluding pediatric patients and hemorrhagic presentation. Patients with quantitative magnetic resonance angiography measurements of the direct bypass immediately and > 6 months postoperatively were included. Angiographic follow-up, when available, was used to assess EDAS collaterals at similar time intervals. Of 16 hemispheres in 13 patients, 11 (69%) demonstrated a significant (> 50%) decline in direct bypass flow at > 6 months compared with baseline, averaging a drop from 99 Â± 35 to 12 Â± 7 mL/min. Conversely, angiography in these hemispheres demonstrated prominent indirect collaterals, in concert with shrinkage of the STA graft. Decline in flow was apparent at a median of 9 months but was evident as early as 2 to 3 months. In this small cohort, a reciprocal relationship between direct STA bypass flow and indirect EDAS collaterals frequently occurred. This substantiates the notion that combined direct/indirect bypass can provide temporally complementary revascularization.\n\nAtypical moyamoya syndrome with brain calcification and stenosis of abdominal aorta and renal arteries.\n\nPubMed\n\nUchikawa, Hideki; Fujii, Katsunori; Fujita, Mayuko; Okunushi, Tomoko; Shimojo, Naoki\n\n2017-09-01\n\nMoyamoya syndrome is a progressive cerebrovascular disease that is characterized by stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches, in combination with an accompanying disease. We herein describe an 8-year-old boy exhibiting transient loss of consciousness, who had recurrent seizures in infancy with progressive brain calcification. On admission, he was alert but magnetic resonance angiography showed bilateral stenosis of the whole internal carotid artery and proliferation o"
