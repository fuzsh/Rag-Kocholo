        "text": "The Use of IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (Anakinra) in Idiopathic Recurrent Pericarditis: A Narrative Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaskar, Shankar; Klein, Allan L.; Zeft, Andrew\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRecurrent pericarditis is a complication of acute pericarditis in 20â30% of the patients and is usually idiopathic in nature. The underlying pathogenesis of this condition remains unclear, although immune-mediated mechanisms seem likely. A subgroup of these patients with refractory symptoms can be challenging to manage, and multiple immunosuppressive medications have been used without consistent benefit. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and autoinflammatory syndromes. Preliminary evidence suggests that anakinra could be a promising therapy for idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. In this narrative review, we summarize the current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis, mechanism of action of anakinra, and the preliminary evidence, supporting the use of anakinra in pericarditis. PMID:26942035\n\nIdiopathic recurrent pericarditis as an immune-mediated disease: current insights into pathogenesis and emerging treatment options.\n\nPubMed\n\nImazio, Massimo\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIdiopathic recurrent pericarditis affects 30-50% of patients with a previous attack of pericarditis. The etiopathogenesis is incompletely understood and most cases remain idiopathic with a presumed immune-mediated pathogenesis. The mainstay of therapy is aspirin or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug plus colchicine and the possible adjunct of a low-to-moderate dose of a corticosteroid in more difficult cases. Colchicine as an adjunct to anti-inflammatory therapy reduces by 50% the subsequent recurrent rate. For true refractory cases with failure of standard combination therapies, new and emerging options especially include human intravenous immunoglobulins and biological agents (i.e., anakinra). The outcome of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis is good with a negligible risk of developing constrictive pericarditis. Thus, it is important to reassure patients on their prognosis, explaining the nature of the disease and the likely course. Moreover, therapeutic choices should include less toxic agents and favor cheaper drugs whenever possible.\n\nEfficacy of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins in two patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis refractory to previous immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nTona, Francesco; Bellotto, Fabio; Laveder, Francesco; Meneghin, Alessia; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Marcolongo, Renzo\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAlthough idiopathic acute pericarditis is usually a self-limiting disease, in many patients it may recur over a period of months or years. Even if some evidence seems to suggest the possible role of a deranged immune reactivity in the pathogenesis of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis, the etiology of the disease is still unknown. Furthermore, while some trial data confirm the usefulness of colchicine, its medical treatment is not yet clearly established. We here report the clinical history of 2 patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis resistant to prednisone, colchicine and other immunosuppressive drugs, who have been successfully treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins.\n\nUsefulness of Novel Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Idiopathic Recurrent Pericarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLotan, Dor; Wasserstrum, Yishay; Fardman, Alexander; Kogan, Michael; Adler, Yehuda\n\n2016-03-01\n\nIdiopathic recurrent pericarditis (IRP) is a debilitating illness which leads to great suffering and multiple hospitalizations. Management of acute pericarditis and subsequent recurrences has evolved significantly as the use of colchicine-based strategies become more prevalent, yet there still remains a subset of patients who remain refractory to colchicine therapy, and these patients require prolonged corticosteroid (CS) therapy for the control of symptoms. Since the 1960s, there have been reports of successful management of these cases with immunosuppressive therapy. Current guidelines support the use of anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulins, and azathioprine for management of IRP, with the goals of both control of symptoms and withdrawal of CS. Recent reports supply evidence for both auto-inflammatory and autoimmune activity in these patients. We herein review the current available reports regarding the evidence regarding the pathophysiology and reported cases and case series of IRP cases managed with immunomodulation therapy.

While the diagnosis of acute pericarditis is sometime straight forward, its etiology and therapeutic management are still a challenge for physicians. In developed countries, the idiopathic form is the most frequent, and the search for an infectious etiology is almost invariably negative. Nevertheless, since standard treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine is not always able to neutralize pericardial inflammation in recurrent pericarditis, anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been proposed as a possible therapeutic alternative for refractory forms. IL-1 is a cytokine that exerts a pivotal role in innate immunity and in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and in autoinflammatory disorders, as familial Mediterranean fever and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. The successful management of patients with acute idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (IRP) needs a teamwork approach, where cardiologists, rheumatologists, clinical immunologists and internists are involved. In this review, we will discuss the clinical and therapeutical challenges of IRP both in adults and children from a clinical practice standpoint. We will also briefly illustrate the main pathogenic mechanisms of IRP to provide internists and cardiologists with the rationale for approaching the use of anakinra in selected clinical cases.\n\nRecurrent Pericarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nImazio, Massimo; Gribaudo, Elena; Gaita, Fiorenzo\n\nRecurrent pericarditis is the most common and troublesome complication of pericarditis affecting 20% to 50% of patients. Its pathogenesis is often presumed to be immune-mediated, but additional investigations are needed to clarify the pathogenesis in order to develop etiology-oriented therapies. Imaging with computed tomography and especially cardiac magnetic resonance holds promise to help in the identification of more difficult cases and improve their management. Refractory recurrent pericarditis with corticosteroid dependence and colchicine resistance remain still an unsolved issue in search of new therapies, although old drugs such as azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulins, and biological agents seem promising, but new randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm their role. Despite compromising the quality of life, idiopathic recurrent pericarditis has an overall good long-term outcome without mortality and significant risk of constrictive pericarditis evolution. The risk of constriction, the most feared complication, is related to the etiology and not the number of recurrences. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

IRP is currently viewed as an autoinflammatory disease with characteristic recurrent episodes of sterile inflammation. According to the most recent Guidelines, the initial treatment regimen consists of a combination of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with colchicine followed by the addition of corticosteroids in resistant or intolerant cases. Despite this treatment approach, a number of patients either do not respond or cannot tolerate the above therapies. For this refractory group, small case series and a recent randomized controlled trial have shown that interleukin-1 inhibition with anakinra is a rapidly acting, highly efficient, steroid-sparing, and safe therapeutic intervention. In this perspective, we discuss the available clinical evidence and our own clinical experience as well as the future prospects of this novel therapeutic approach for patients with IRP. PMID:28660191\n\nRecurrent pericarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nImazio, M; Battaglia, A; Gaido, L; Gaita, F\n\n2017-05-01\n\nRecurrent pericarditis is the most troublesome complication of pericarditis occurring in 15 to 30% of cases. The pathogenesis is often presumed to be immune-mediated although a specific rheumatologic diagnosis is commonly difficult to find. The clinical diagnosis is based on recurrent pericarditis chest pain and additional objective evidence of disease activity (e.g. pericardial rub, ECG changes, pericardial effusion, elevation of markers of inflammation, and/or imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation by CT or cardiac MR). The mainstay of medical therapy for recurrent pericarditis is aspirin or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) plus colchicine. Second-line therapy is considered after failure of such treatments and it is generally based on low to moderate doses of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 0.2 to 0.5Â mg/kg/day or equivalent) plus colchicine. More difficult cases are treated with combination of aspirin or NSAID, colchicine and corticosteroids. Refractory cases are managed by alternative medical options, including azathioprine, or intravenous human immunoglobulins or biological agents (e.g. anakinra). When all medical therapies fail, the last option may be surgical by pericardiectomy to be recommended in well-experienced centres. Despite a significant impairment of the quality of life, the most common forms of recurrent pericarditis (usually named as \"idiopathic recurrent pericarditis\" since without a well-defined etiological diagnosis) have good long-term outcomes with a negligible risk of developing constriction and rarely cardiac tamponade during follow-up. The present article reviews current knowledge on the definition, diagnosis, aetiology, therapy and prognosis of recurrent pericarditis with a focus on the more recent available literature.

In most of these patients, the pericarditis remains idiopathic, although an immune-mediated (either autoimmune or autoinflammatory) pathogenesis is often presumed. The mainstay of therapy for recurrences is aspirin or NSAIDs, with the adjunct of colchicine. Corticosteroids are a second-line option to be considered for specific indications, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy; contraindications or intolerance to aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or colchicine; or insufficient response to these medications. Furthermore, corticosteroids can be added to NSAIDs and colchicine in patients with persistent symptoms. In patients who do not respond adequately to any of these conventional therapies, alternative treatment options include azathioprine, intravenous human immunoglobulins, and anakinra. An improved understanding of how recurrent pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this complication, and further research is needed into the pathogenesis of recurrences. We discuss the aetiology and diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis, and extensively review the treatment options for this condition.\n\nEfficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin in chronic idiopathic pericarditis: report of four cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeterlana, D; Puccetti, A; Simeoni, S; Tinazzi, E; Corrocher, R; Lunardi, C\n\n2005-02-01\n\nHuman intravenous immunoglobulins (hIVIgs) are used in two broad categories of diseases: immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. Among the immune-mediated diseases hIVIgs are of benefit in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and dermatomyositis. Chronic idiopathic pericarditis (CIP) is a chronic disease of unknown origin characterized by recurrent episodes of pericardial inflammation. The cause of the recurrence is unknown, although in some cases it may be traced to a viral infection and to the presence of antimyocardial antibodies. Since a viral infection can induce an autoimmune process through a mechanism of molecular mimicry, and since the optimal therapy for prevention of the recurrences has not been established, we reasoned that treatment with hIVIgs could be beneficial in our patients unresponsive to previous immunosuppressive therapies. We describe four patients affected by CIP treated with monthly high-dose hIVIgs (0.4 g/kg daily for 5 consecutive days) for five times followed by administration every 2 months. Three of the four patients could permanently discontinue steroid therapy and are still in remission after years of follow-up. Our experience suggests that hIVIgs therapy may be a useful and safe treatment for CIP in steroid-dependent patients.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin therapy leading to dramatic improvement in a patient with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe pericarditis resistant to steroid pulse therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAizawa-Yashiro, Tomomi; Oki, Eishin; Tsuruga, Kazushi; Nakahata, Tohru; Ito, Etsuro; Tanaka, Hiroshi\n\n2012-05-01\n\nA 7-year-old Japanese boy with a 4-month history of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (s-JIA) experienced disease flare with spiking fever, exanthema and arthralgia. He then developed progressive dyspnea due to severe pericarditis, and proinflammatory hypercytokinemia was suspected. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was ineffective and echocardiography showed massive pericardial effusion had persisted. Alternatively, subsequent intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy resulted in dramatic resolution of the pericardial effusion, and his general condition significantly improved within a few days. This case report may lend further support the use of IVIG for selected patients with s-JIA and severe pericarditis.\n\nAnakinra: an emerging option for refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis: a systematic review of published evidence.\n\nPubMed\n\nLazaros, George; Imazio, Massimo; Brucato, Antonio; Vassilopoulos, Dimitrios; Vasileiou, Panagiotis; Gattorno, Marco; Tousoulis, Dimitrios; Martini, Alberto\n\n2016-04-01\n\nAccumulating evidence suggests idiopathic recurrent pericarditis as a disease of probable autoinflammatory origin, and thus anakinra could be of benefit. The goal of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of anakinra in this context. Reports relevant to anakinra administration in patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis published up to October 2014 were searched in several databases. All references found, upon initial assessment at title and abstract level for suitability, were consequently retrieved as full reports for further appraisal. Among 12 citations retrieved, nine reports (four case series and five case reports with 34 patients, 20 men, mean age 26.8 years) were assessed. The mean disease duration was 31 months and the number of recurrences 8.2. Anakinra was generally administered as a daily subcutaneous injection of 100 mg or as a mean dose of 1.1 mg/kg/d in weight-adjusted regimens. The mean full-dose duration was 9.2 months. C-reactive protein normalized within 7.1 days, and steroids were withdrawn within 62 days. Dose tapering was adopted in 64.7% of patients, leading to recurrence in 26% of cases. In a 28.3-month follow-up, eight out of 34 patients (23.5%) were disease free without treatment, after having received anakinra for 10.4 months overall. Anakinra was proved well tolerated, with mild local reaction being reported in 44% of patients. Anakinra is a highly effective, rapidly acting, well tolerated and steroid-sparing agent. Recurrences after drug discontinuation are a matter of concern. Randomized trials are required to confirm these findings and address the most effective treatment protocol.\n\nViral Communities Associated with Human Pericardial Fluids in Idiopathic Pericarditis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFancello, Laura; Monteil, Sonia; Popgeorgiev, Nikolay; Rivet, Romain; Gouriet, FrÃ©dÃ©rique; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Raoult, Didier; Desnues, Christelle\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPericarditis is a common human disease defined by inflammation of the pericardium. Currently, 40% to 85% of pericarditis cases have no identified etiology. Most of these cases are thought to be caused by an infection of undetected, unsuspected or unknown viruses. In this work, we used a culture- and sequence-independent approach to investigate the viral DNA communities present in human pericardial fluids. Seven viral metagenomes were generated from the pericardial fluid of patients affected by pericarditis of unknown etiology and one metagenome was generated from the pericardial fluid of a sudden infant death case. As a positive control we generated one metagenome from the pericardial fluid of a patient affected by pericarditis caused by herpesvirus type 3. Furthermore, we used as negative controls a total of 6 pericardial fluids from 6 different individuals affected by pericarditis of non-infectious origin: 5 of them were sequenced as a unique pool and the remaining one was sequenced separately. The results showed a significant presence of torque teno viruses especially in one patient, while herpesviruses and papillomaviruses were present in the positive control. Co-infections by different genotypes of the same viral type (torque teno viruses) or different viruses (herpesviruses and papillomaviruses) were observed. Sequences related to bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus, Enterobacteria, Streptococcus, Burkholderia and Pseudomonas were also detected in three patients. This study detected torque teno viruses and papillomaviruses, for the first time, in human pericardial fluids.

Conventional treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and colchicine is not always effective or may cause serious adverse effects. There is no consensus, however, on how to proceed in those patients whose disease is refractory to conventional therapy. In such cases, human intravenous immunoglobulin, immunosuppressive drugs, and biological agents have been used. In this report we describe 2 patients with refractory recurrent pericarditis after cardiac surgery who were successfully treated with 3 and 5 monthly high-dose (2 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin until resolution of the effusion. Our experience supports the effectiveness and safety of this therapy.

Even after guideline-directed first-line treatment consisting of aspirin (ASA) or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) in combination with colchicine therapy, recurrences still occur in greater than 20% of patients. Many patients then require treatment with long-term corticosteroids, which is not a favorable option due to their short- and long-term adverse effects. Because it is theorized that the pathophysiology of IRP may possess autoimmune sequelae, the use of immunotherapy for the treatment of IRP has emerged. In this review, we describe the literature associated with immunotherapy used to treat IRP in an adult population as well as provide an overview of the safety and monitoring parameters for each agent. The most common immunotherapies used after patients have had multiple recurrences of IRP are anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and azathioprine. In most cases, these immunotherapies are adjunctive therapy, with the goal of tapering and discontinuing immunosuppressive corticosteroids. After reviewing the data, anakinra resulted in more patients discontinuing corticosteroids and prevented further recurrences of pericarditis. IVIG resulted in symptom resolution and no further recurrences in most of the patients. Azathioprine was associated with more than half of patients becoming recurrence free; however, many patients required a restart of corticosteroids due to recurrence. Clinicians should be aware of the adverse effects of immunotherapy, ranging from mild gastrointestinal events to risk of infection and serious blood dyscrasias that may require diligent monitoring. The use of immunotherapy for the treatment of adults with IRP should be restricted to patients who have multiple recurrences. Ideally, immunotherapy would be adjunctive to first-line combination therapy with ASA/NSAID plus colchicine, with the goal of tapering and discontinuing immunosuppressive\n\nPericarditis - constrictive\n\nMedlinePlus\n\nConstrictive pericarditis is long-term (chronic) inflammation of the sac-like covering of the heart (the pericardium) with thickening and scarring.

Human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) have been proposed as possible therapeutic options for these cases. The goal of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy and safety of IVIGs in this context. Studies reporting the use of IVIG for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and published up to October 2014 were searched in several databases. All references found, upon initial assessment at title and abstract level for suitability, were consequently retrieved as full reports for further appraisal. Among the 18 citations retrieved, 17 reports (4 case series and 13 single case reports, with an overall population of 30 patients) were included. The mean disease duration was 14 months and the mean number of recurrences before IVIG was 3. Approximately 47% of patients had idiopathic recurrent pericarditis, 10% had an infective cause, and the remainder a systemic inflammatory disease. Nineteen out of the 30 patients (63.3%) were on corticosteroids at IVIG commencement. IVIGs were generally administered at a dose of 400-500 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days with repeated cycles according to the clinical response. Complications were uncommon (headache in ~3%) and not life-threatening. After a mean follow-up of approximately 33th months, recurrences occurred in 26.6% of cases after the first IVIG cycle, and 22 of the 30 patients (73.3%) were recurrence-free. Five patients (16.6%) were on corticosteroids at the end of the follow-up. IVIGs are rapidly acting, well tolerated, and efficacious steroid-sparing agents in refractory pericarditis.\n\nAssociates and predictors of pleurisy or pericarditis in SLE\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRyu, Seungwon; Fu, Wei; Petri, Michelle A\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground/Purpose Serositis is one of both ACR and SLICC classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a common type of extra renal flare. However, little is known about clinical or immunological associations of pleurisy or pericarditis. The aim of this study is to analyze associates and predictors of pleurisy versus pericarditis in Caucasians and African Americans with SLE. Methods 2,390 SLE patients in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort were analyzed for demographic, clinical and serologic associates of pleurisy or pericarditis, defined using the SELENA revision of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). The cross-sectional and prospective study using either univariate or multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the associates of serositis in SLE. We reported associates with a p-value of less than 0.05 for pleurisy or pericarditis. Results 43% had pleurisy and 22% had pericarditis. African-American ethnicity was a predictive factor for new pericarditis. Hemolytic anemia, proteinuria, lymphadenopathy and anti-Sm were predictive only of pericarditis, whereas pulmonary fibrosis and GI infarction were predictive only of pleurisy. Fever, Raynaudâs syndrome, and anti-DNA were predictors for both pericarditis and pleurisy. Conclusion Our study provides further insights into the associates of pleurisy and pericarditis in SLE. Predictors of pleurisy and pericarditis are shown for the first time. The long term consequences from the cross-sectional analysis gives a lesson that serositis in SLE should not be considered benign.

Recurrence affects about 30% (20% to 50%) of patients within 18 months after the initial episode of acute pericarditis resulting in subsequent rehospitalizations. Bearing in mind high treatment costs of patients admitted to hospital with acute and recurrent pericarditis, there is a need to optimize the treatment of both of these conditions. Materials and methods. We present a case of recurrent pericarditis. The first episode of pericarditis was diagnosed in 2006. Three months later the patient was hospitalized due to clinical symptoms suggesting recurrence of a past condition. Ten years after the initial episode of acute pericarditis the patient was hospitalized for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. The search for etiology of the disease was unsuccessful, the patient received treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; empiric antimicrobial therapy was also administered. Results and conclusions. Acute pericarditis is the most common disease of the pericardium encountered in clinical practice. Colchicine has been demonstrated as a first-line drug to be added to conventional anti-inflammatory therapies in patients with a first episode of pericarditis or its recurrences in order to improve the response to therapy and reduce recurrences. Despite a large amount of new data, there are still several issues that require additional research and clarification, including the search for new individualized therapies, the best duration of treatment for patients with pericardial diseases, and optimization of patient follow-up in order to collect data on long-term outcomes that would allow shortening the duration of in-patient treatment and reduction of recurrences.

However, there are still reports of cases of the disease, which is associated with high mortality, and most such cases are attributed to delayed diagnosis. Approximately 40-50% of all cases of purulent pericarditis are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae in particular. Methods: We report four cases of pneumococcal pneumonia complicated by pericarditis, with different clinical features and levels of severity. Results: In three of the four cases, the main complication was cardiac tamponade. Microbiological screening (urinary antigen testing and pleural fluid culture) confirmed the diagnosis of severe pneumococcal pneumonia complicated by purulent pericarditis. Conclusions: In cases of pneumococcal pneumonia complicated by pericarditis, early diagnosis is of paramount importance to avoid severe hemodynamic compromise. The complications of acute pericarditis appear early in the clinical course of the infection. The most serious complications are cardiac tamponade and its consequences. Antibiotic therapy combined with pericardiocentesis drastically reduces the mortality associated with purulent pericarditis.

Healthcare providers should be familiar with post-cardiac ablation complications as this procedure is now widespread and frequently performed. The management of regional pericarditis differs greatly from that of acute myocardial infarction. A 52 year-old male underwent atrial fibrillation ablation and developed severe mid-sternal chest pain the following day with electrocardiographic findings suggestive of acute myocardial infarction, and underwent coronary angiography, a left ventriculogram, and 2D transthoracic echocardiogram, all of which were unremarkable without evidence of obstructive coronary disease, wall motion abnormalities, or pericardial effusions. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with regional pericarditis. After diagnosis, the patient's presenting symptoms resolved with treatment including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine. This is the first reported case study of regional pericarditis status post cardiac ablation. Electrocardiographic findings were classic for an acute myocardial infarction; however, coronary angiography and left ventriculogram demonstrated no acute coronary occlusion or ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Healthcare professionals must remember that the electrocardiographic findings in pericarditis are not always classic and that pericarditis can occur status post cardiac ablation.\n\nBacterial pericarditis in a cat.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeBlanc, Nicole; Scollan, Katherine F\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA 4-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented to the Oregon State University cardiology service for suspected pericardial effusion. Cardiac tamponade was documented and pericardiocentesis yielded purulent fluid with cytologic results supportive of bacterial pericarditis. The microbial population consisted of Pasteurella multocida, Actinomyces canis, Fusobacterium and Bacteroides species.

The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. The empiric therapy is based on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs plus colchicine as first choice, resorting to corticosteroids for specific indications (eg, systemic inflammatory disease on corticosteroids, pregnancy, renal failure, concomitant oral anticoagulants), for contraindications or failure of the first-line therapy. The most common complication is recurrence, occurring in up to 30% of cases after a first episode of pericarditis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Healthcare providers should be familiar with post-cardiac ablation complications as this procedure is now widespread and frequently performed. The management of regional pericarditis differs greatly from that of acute myocardial infarction. Case report: A 52 year-old male underwent atrial fibrillation ablation and developed severe mid-sternal chest pain the following day with electrocardiographic findings suggestive of acute myocardial infarction, and underwent coronary angiography, a left ventriculogram, and 2D transthoracic echocardiogram, all of which were unremarkable without evidence of obstructive coronary disease, wall motion abnormalities, or pericardial effusions. Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with regional pericarditis. After diagnosis, the patient's presenting symptoms resolved with treatment including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine. Conclusion: This is the first reported case study of regional pericarditis status post cardiac ablation. Electrocardiographic findings were classic for an acute myocardial infarction; however, coronary angiography and left ventriculogram demonstrated no acute coronary occlusion or ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Healthcare professionals must remember that the electrocardiographic findings in pericarditis are not always classic and that pericarditis can occur status post cardiac ablation.

Acute pericarditis has a classical presentation, including symptoms, physical examination findings, and electrocardiography abnormalities. Early recognition of acute pericarditis will avoid unnecessary invasive testing and prompt therapies that provide rapid symptom relief. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain first-line therapy for uncomplicated acute pericarditis, although colchicine can be used concomitantly with NSAIDS as the first-line approach, particularly in severely symptomatic cases. Colchicine should be used in all refractory cases and as initial therapy in all recurrences. Aspirin should replace NSAIDS in pericarditis complicating acute myocardial infarction. Systemic corticosteroids can be used in refractory cases or in those with immune-mediated etiologies, although generally should be avoided due to a higher risk of recurrence. Pericardial effusions have many etiologies and the approach to diagnosis and therapy depends on clinical presentation. Pericardial tamponade is a life-threatening clinical diagnosis made on physical examination and supported by characteristic findings on diagnostic testing. Prompt diagnosis and management is critical. Treatment consists of urgent pericardial fluid drainage with a pericardial drain left in place for several days to help prevent acute recurrence. Analysis of pericardial fluid should be performed in all cases as it may provide clues to etiology. Consultation of cardiac surgery for pericardial window should be considered in recurrent cases and may be the first-line approach to malignant effusions, although acute relief of hemodynamic compromise must not be delayed. Constrictive pericarditis is associated with symptoms that mimic many other cardiac conditions. Thus, correct diagnosis is critical and involves identification of pericardial thickening or calcification in\n\nA randomized trial of colchicine for acute pericarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nImazio, Massimo; Brucato, Antonio; Cemin, Roberto; Ferrua, Stefania; Maggiolini, Stefano; Beqaraj, Federico; Demarie, Daniela; Forno, Davide; Ferro, Silvia; Maestroni, Silvia; Belli, Riccardo; Trinchero, Rita; Spodick, David H; Adler, Yehuda\n\n2013-10-17\n\nColchicine is effective for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. However, conclusive data are lacking regarding the use of colchicine during a first attack of acute pericarditis and in the prevention of recurrent symptoms. In a multicenter, double-blind trial, eligible adults with acute pericarditis were randomly assigned to receive either colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily for 3 months for patients weighing >70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing â¤70 kg) or placebo in addition to conventional antiinflammatory therapy with aspirin or ibuprofen. The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis. A total of 240 patients were enrolled, and 120 were randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. The primary outcome occurred in 20 patients (16.7%) in the colchicine group and 45 patients (37.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction in the colchicine group, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72; number needed to treat, 4; P<0.001). Colchicine reduced the rate of symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40.0%, P=0.001), the number of recurrences per patient (0.21 vs. 0.52, P=0.001), and the hospitalization rate (5.0% vs. 14.2%, P=0.02). Colchicine also improved the remission rate at 1 week (85.0% vs. 58.3%, P<0.001). Overall adverse effects and rates of study-drug discontinuation were similar in the two study groups. No serious adverse events were observed. In patients with acute pericarditis, colchicine, when added to conventional antiinflammatory therapy, significantly reduced the rate of incessant or recurrent pericarditis.

We evaluated the effects of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy and Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy in patients with tuberculous pericarditis. METHODS Using a 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 1400 adults with definite or probable tuberculous pericarditis to either prednisolone or placebo for 6 weeks and to either M. indicus pranii or placebo, administered in five injections over the course of 3 months. Two thirds of the participants had concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death, cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis, or constrictive pericarditis. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between patients who received prednisolone and those who received placebo (23.8% and 24.5%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.18; P = 0.66) or between those who received M. indicus pranii immunotherapy and those who received placebo (25.0% and 24.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.29; P = 0.81). Prednisolone therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of constrictive pericarditis (4.4% vs. 7.8%; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.87; P = 0.009) and hospitalization (20.7% vs. 25.2%; hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Both prednisolone and M. indicus pranii, each as compared with placebo, were associated with a significant increase in the incidence of cancer (1.8% vs. 0.6%; hazard ratio, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.07 to 10.03; P = 0.03, and 1.8% vs. 0.5%; hazard ratio, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.03 to 13.24; P = 0.03, respectively), owing mainly to an increase in HIV-associated cancer.

It develops insidiously, and in many cases, particularly in developed countries, no antecedent diagnosis can be found. These cases are termed idiopathic. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of constrictive pericarditis in developing nations but represents only a small minority in developed countries. Here the authors describe two different case reports where tuberculosis was the probable cause of CCP. A 21-year-old man born in Cape Verde living in Europe for 4 years and a 24-year-old man born in GuinÃ© Bissau were both admitted due to intense precordial pain and syncope after exertion. Interestingly both had fatigability, dyspnea, chest discomfort and palpitations on exertion, as well as progressive involuntary weight loss and decubitus cough. On physical examination they had tachycardia, jaundice, cachexia, elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly and ascites. Both electrocardiograms showed prominent P waves and chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary interstitial infiltrates and enlargement of the right cavities. Analytically, elevated bilirubin, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was also found in both. Echocardiography revealed findings, in both cases, compatible with CCP including less common signs as annulus reversus and annulus paradoxus. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT from both patients revealed chronic liver disease with congestion, pleural effusion, pericardial calcifications, ascites and massive mediastinal and abdominal adenopathies. Blood cultures and IGRA test were negative. However, given the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), anti-TB therapy was started. Despite the diagnosis of \"end-stage\" CCP with very high operative risk multidisciplinary team decided after informed consent, to perform total anterior pericardiectomy, that occurred without complications.

Although this procedure has been used mainly to detect intra-abdominal infection, the thorax is routinely imaged along with the abdomen, and therefore detection of cardiac disease may be feasible. This case report is of a young woman after liver transplantation who developed occult purulent pericarditis initially detected by a leukocyte scan with indium-111. This case demonstrates that striking pericardial uptake on a whole-body indium-111 leukocyte scan can occur with purulent pericarditis, and it reemphasizes how insidiouslymoreÂ Â» purulent pericarditis may present in an immunosuppressed patient.Â«Â less\n\nTuberculous Pericarditis is Multibacillary and Bacterial Burden Drives High Mortality\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPasipanodya, Jotam G.; Mubanga, Mwenya; Ntsekhe, Mpiko; Pandie, Shaheen; Magazi, Beki T.; Gumedze, Freedom; Myer, Landon; Gumbo, Tawanda; Mayosi, Bongani M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Tuberculous pericarditis is considered to be a paucibacillary process; the large pericardial fluid accumulation is attributed to an inflammatory response to tuberculoproteins. Mortality rates are high. We investigated the role of clinical and microbial factors predictive of tuberculous pericarditis mortality using the artificial intelligence algorithm termed classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Methods Patients were prospectively enrolled and followed in the Investigation of the Management of Pericarditis (IMPI) registry. Clinical and laboratory data of 70 patients with confirmed tuberculous pericarditis, including time-to-positive (TTP) cultures from pericardial fluid, were extracted and analyzed for mortality outcomes using CART. TTP was translated to log10 colony forming units (CFUs) per mL, and compared to that obtained from sputum in some of our patients. Findings Seventy patients with proven tuberculous pericarditis were enrolled. The median patient age was 35 (range: 20â71) years. The median, follow up was for 11.97 (range: 0Â·03â74.73) months. The median TTP for pericardial fluid cultures was 22 (range: 4â58) days or 3.91(range: 0Â·5â8Â·96) log10CFU/mL, which overlapped with the range of 3.24â7.42 log10CFU/mL encountered in sputum, a multi-bacillary disease. The overall mortality rate was 1.43 per 100 person-months. CART identified follow-up duration of 5Â·23Â months on directly observed therapy, a CD4Â + count of â¤Â 199.5/mL, and TTPÂ â¤Â 14Â days (bacillary loadÂ â¥Â 5.53 log10 CFU/mL) as predictive of mortality. TTP interacted with follow-up duration in a non-linear fashion. Interpretation Patients with culture confirmed tuberculous pericarditis have a high bacillary burden, and this bacterial burden drives mortality. Thus proven tuberculosis pericarditis is not a paucibacillary disease. Moreover, the severe immunosuppression suggests limited inflammation.

Although not substantiated by clinical history, the renal pathologic features were similar to those of ethylene glycol-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis. The patient did not have a history of heroin addiction. The importance of predisposing factors such as uremia, invasive vascular procedures, tracheal intubation, peritoneal dialysis, and pericardiocentesis in Serratia infection in susceptible persons is discussed, as are possible roles of uremia, pericardiocentesis, and pericardiotomy in the pathogenesis of constrictive pericarditis in the present case.\n\nSeronegative rheumatoid arthritis: a rare cause of effusive-constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoo, Alan; Graham, Alastair\n\n2012-04-01\n\nEffusive-constrictive pericarditis is a rare condition.

As adipose tissue has a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, we hypothesized that quantification of epicardial fat volume (EFV) provides prognostic information in patients with acute pericarditis. Fifty (n = 50) patients with first diagnosis of acute pericarditis were enrolled in this study. Patients underwent a cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan to quantify EFV on a dedicated workstation. Patients were followed up in hospital for atrial fibrillation (AF) development and up to 18 months for the composite clinical endpoint of development of constrictive, recurrent or incessant pericarditis or poor response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients presenting with chest pain had lower EFV vs. patients without chest pain (167Â·2 Â± 21Â·7 vs. 105Â·1 Â± 11Â·1 cm 3 , respectively, P < 0Â·01); EFV (but not body mass index) was strongly positively correlated with pericardial effusion size (r = 0Â·395, P = 0Â·007) and associated with in-hospital AF. At follow-up, patients that reached the composite clinical endpoint had lower EFV (P < 0Â·05). After adjustment for age, EFV was associated with lower odds ratio for the composite clinical endpoint point of poor response to NSAIDs or the development of constrictive, recurrent or incessant pericarditis during follow-up (per 20 cm 3 increase in EFV: OR = 0Â·802 [0Â·656-0Â·981], P < 0Â·05). We report for the first time a significant association of EFV with the clinical features and the outcome of patients with acute pericarditis. Measurement of EFV by CT may have important prognostic implications in these patients.

Because of the long latency in asbestos-related pathology, past asbestos exposure continues to contribute to incident disease. Asbestos most commonly produces pulmonary pathology, with asbestos-related pleural disease as the most common manifestation. Although the pleurae and pericardium share certain histologic characteristics, asbestos-related pericarditis is rarely reported. We present a 59-year-old man who worked around boilers for almost 30 years and was eventually determined to have calcific, constrictive pericarditis. He initially presented with an infectious exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Chest radiographs demonstrated pleural and pericardial calcifications. Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization showed a hemodynamic picture consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A high-resolution computerized tomography scan of the chest demonstrated dense calcification in the pericardium, right pleural thickening and nodularity, right pleural plaque without calcification, and density in the right middle lobe. Pulmonary function testing showed mild obstruction and borderline low diffusing capacity. Based on the patient's occupational history, the presence of pleural pathology consistent with asbestos, previous evidence that asbestos can affect the pericardium, and absence of other likely explanations, we concluded that his pericarditis was asbestos-related. Similar to pleural thickening and plaque formation, asbestos may cause progressive fibrosis of the pericardium.\n\nMolecular Characterization of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Causing Fatal Purulent Pericarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Vasudevan Anil; Nair, Nisha; Thachathodiyl, Rajesh; Nandakumar, Aswathy; Dinesh, Kavitha R; Thatcher, Eileen; Karim, Shamsul; Biswas, Raja\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThough pericardial disease is common in patients with renal disease, purulent pericarditis is very rare.

We report a case of purulent pericarditis with septic and cardiogenic shock, caused by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (group C) in a 51-year-old patient. The pathogen was possibly contracted through contact with horses. Most probably, it caused initially pneumonia before spreading to the pericardium, either directly or via the bloodstream. A combined therapeutic approach, consisting of antibiotic therapy and repeated pericardial drainage, was necessary to ensure a clinical cure.

In contrast to pleural empyema, there are few data regarding the biochemical parameters of purulent pericardial effusion to aid diagnosis. Therefore, in this study, we have evaluated the diagnostic utility of biochemical tests in patients with purulent pericarditis. Between September 2004 and September 2012, we treated fifteen children with purulent pericarditis and tamponade. There were 8 boys and 7 girls, ranging in age from 8 months to 14 years, with a mean age of 5.3 Â± 3.2 years. Echocardiographic diagnosis of cardiac tamponade was made in all patients. All patients underwent immediate surgical drainage due to cardiac tamponade. The diagnosis of purulent pericarditis was supported by biochemical tests. Anterior mini-thoracotomy or subxiphoid approach was performed for surgical drainage. The most common clinical findings were tamponade, hepatomegaly, tachycardia, fever refractory antibiotic therapy, dyspnea, tachypnea, cough, and increased jugular venous pressure. Central venous pressure decreased and arterial tension increased immediately after the evacuation of purulent effusion during operation in all patients. The pericardial effusion had high lactic dehydrogenase, and low glucose concentration, confirming purulent pericarditis. Also, pH (meanÂ± SD) was 7.01 Â± 0.06. The culture of pericardial effusions and blood samples were negative. Biochemical tests are useful guideline when assessing the pericardial effusions.

The pathogenesis is presumed to be autoimmune and/or autoinflammatory in most cases. The mainstay of therapy for recurrences is physical restriction and anti-inflammatory therapy based on aspirin or NSAID plus colchicine. Corticosteroids at low to moderate doses (e.g., prednisone 0.2 to 0.5Â mg/kg/day) should be considered only after failure of aspirin/NSAID (and more than one of these drugs) or for specific indications (e.g., pregnancy, systemic inflammatory diseases on steroids, renal failure, concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy). One of the most challenging issues is how to cope with patients who have recurrences despite colchicine. A small subset of patients (about 5Â %) may develop corticosteroid-dependence and colchicine resistance. Among the emerging treatments, the three most common and evidence-based therapies are based on azathioprine, human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anakinra. After failure of all options of medical therapy or for those patients who do not tolerate medical therapy or have serious adverse events related to medical therapy, the last possible option is the surgical removal of the pericardium. Total or radical pericardiectomy is recommended in these cases in experienced centers performing this surgery. A stepwise approach is recommended starting from NSAID and colchicine, corticosteroid and colchicine, a combination of the three options (NSAID, colchicine and corticosteroids), then azathioprine, IVIG, or anakinra as last medical options before pericardiectomy.\n\nRapidly progressive effusive constrictive pericarditis caused by methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). samraakhtar@hotmail.com.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkhtar, Naveed; Khalid, Ayesha; Ahmed, Waqas; Rasheed, Khalid\n\n2010-04-01\n\nEffusive-constrictive pericarditis is a clinical syndrome characterized by concurrent pericardial effusion and pericardial constriction, where constrictive hemodynamics are persistent after effusion is drained.

However, its sensitivity and specificity vary dramatically from center to center. Given the ability to unequivocally define segments of the pericardium with the heart via radiofrequency tissue tagging, we hypothesize that cardiac magnetic resonance has the capability to be the new gold standard. All patients who were referred for cardiac magnetic resonance evaluation of constrictive pericarditis underwent cardiac magnetic resonance radiofrequency tissue tagging to define visceral-parietal pericardial adherence to determine constriction. This was then compared with intraoperative surgical findings. Likewise, all preoperative cardiac catheterization testing was reviewed in a blinded manner. A total of 120 patients were referred for clinical suspicion of constrictive pericarditis. Thirty-nine patients were defined as constrictive pericarditis positive solely via radiofrequency tissue-tagging cardiac magnetic resonance, of whom 21 were positive, 4 were negative, and 1 was equivocal for constrictive pericarditis, as defined by cardiac catheterization. Of these patients, 16 underwent pericardiectomy and were surgically confirmed. There was 100% agreement between cardiac magnetic resonance-defined constrictive pericarditis positivity and postsurgical findings. No patients were misclassified by cardiac magnetic resonance. In regard to the remaining constrictive pericarditis-positive patients defined by cardiac magnetic resonance, 10 were treated medically, declined, were ineligible for surgery, or were lost to follow-up. Long-term follow-up of those who were constrictive pericarditis negative by cardiac magnetic resonance showed no early or late crossover to the surgery arm. Cardiac magnetic resonance via radiofrequency tissue tagging offers a unique, efficient, and effective manner of defining clinically and surgically relevant constrictive pericarditis\n\nPurulent Pericarditis after Liver Abscess: A Case Report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFidalgo GarcÃ­a, MarÃ­a; RodrÃ­guez SanjuÃ¡n, Juan Carlos; RiaÃ±o Molleda, MarÃ­a; GonzÃ¡lez Andaluz, Marta; Real Noval, Hector; GÃ³mez Fleitas, Manuel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe present the case of a 49-year-old woman, with previous clinical antecedents of recent hepatic metastasis, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability. She was found to have purulent pericarditis complicated by pericardial tamponade and pleural effusion, as well as surgical site infection, which was the origin of the disease. Cultures of the surgical wound and the pericardial effusion were positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. A pericardial tap was performed and the intra-abdominal abscess was surgically drained. Pleural effusion was also evacuated. She received antibiotic treatment and recovered successfully. The only after-effect was a well-tolerated effusive-constrictive pericarditis.

On postoperative day 12, she experienced cardiac tamponade that was suspected on computed tomography to be caused by lead perforation; therefore, we performed open-heart surgery. However, we could not identify a perforation site on the heart, and drained a 400-mL exudative pericardial effusion. Subsequently, we diagnosed the pericardial effusion as due to pericarditis induced by pacemaker implantation. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish pericarditis from pacemaker lead perforation, so both should be included in the differential diagnosis.

A 32-year-old male patient was referred to our cardiology outpatient clinic with a complaint of dyspnea. The patient's medical history was unremarkable; however, he had consumed 3 boxes of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L) paste over the previous 1.5 months. His chest x-ray examination revealed an enlarged cardiac shadow and bilateral pleural effusion. On transthoracic echocardiographic examination, his ejection fraction was found to be 55% with circumferentially extended pericardial effusion that reached 3.9 cm at its maximal thickness. No growth had been detected in the pericardial and pleural biopsies or blood samples; there was no evidence of an infectious process in the physical examination. Based on this information, we diagnosed pericarditis resulting from the use of herbal remedies. This is the first report to demonstrate that herbal remedy consumption may cause this type of clinical condition. Besides other well-known causes, pericardial effusion related to the consumption of herbal remedies should always be considered when treating patients with pericardial effusion caused by unclear etiologies.\n\nIncidence and prognostic significance of new onset atrial fibrillation/flutter in acute pericarditis.\n\nPubMed\n\nImazio, Massimo; Lazaros, George; Picardi, Elisa; Vasileiou, Panagiotis; Orlando, Fabrizio; Carraro, Mara; Tsiachris, Dimitris; Vlachopoulos, Charalambos; Georgiopoulos, George; Tousoulis, Dimitrios; Belli, Riccardo; Gaita, Fiorenzo\n\n2015-09-01\n\nData on the incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF/f) in patients with acute pericarditis are limited. We sought to determine the incidence and prognostic significance of AF/f in this setting. Between January 2006 and June 2014, consecutive new cases of acute pericarditis were included in two urban referral centres for pericardial diseases. All new cases of AF/f defined as episodes lasting â¥30â s were recorded. Events considered during follow-up consisted of AF/f and pericarditis recurrence, cardiac tamponade, pericardial constriction and death. 822 consecutive new cases of acute pericarditis (mean age 53Â±15â years, 444 men) were analysed. AF/f was detected in 35 patients (4.3%, mean age 66.5Â±11.3â years, 18 men). Patients with AF/f were significantly older (p=0.017) and presented more frequently with pericardial effusion (p<0.001). Arrhythmias developed within 24â h of pericarditis onset in 91.4% of cases, lasted >24â h in 25.7% and spontaneously converted in 74.3% of patients. Underlying structural heart disease was present in 17% of AF/f cases. In a 30-month follow-up, patients with history of AF/f at the initial episode had a higher rate of arrhythmia occurrence (34.3% vs 0.9%, p<0.001), mostly (75%) within 3â months. No other differences were detected in additional clinical events including haemorrhagic complications in patients receiving oral anticoagulation. The occurrence of AF/f in acute pericarditis identifies a predisposed population to AF/f with a high recurrence risk (about 35%): in these patients, pericarditis may act as an arrhythmic trigger and oral anticoagulation should be seriously considered according to guidelines.

However, the effect of HIV co-infection on clinical features and prognosis in tuberculous pericarditis is not well characterised. We have used baseline data of the Investigation of the Management of Pericarditis in Africa (IMPI Africa) registry to assess the impact of HIV co-infection on clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of patients with suspected tuberculous pericarditis in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Consecutive adult patients in 15 hospitals in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa were recruited on commencement of treatment for tuberculous pericarditis, following informed consent. We recorded demographic, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic information at baseline, and have used the chi-square test and analysis of variance to assess probabilities of significant differences (in these variables) between groups defined by HIV status. Results A total of 185 patients were enrolled from 01 March 2004 to 31 October 2004, 147 (79.5%) of whom had effusive, 28 (15.1%) effusive-constrictive, and 10 (5.4%) constrictive or acute dry pericarditis. Seventy-four (40%) had clinical features of HIV infection. Patients with clinical HIV disease were more likely to present with dyspnoea (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 7.4, P = 0.005) and electrocardiographic features of myopericarditis (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.9, P = 0.03). In addition to electrocardiographic features of myopericarditis, a positive HIV serological status was associated with greater cardiomegaly (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.34 to 11.32, P = 0.01) and haemodynamic instability (OR 9.68, 95% CI 2.09 to 44.80, P = 0.0008). However, stage of pericardial disease at diagnosis and use of diagnostic tests were not related to clinical HIV status. Similar results were obtained for serological HIV status. Most patients were treated on clinical\n\nSentinel case of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causing constrictive pericarditis presenting as hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmadian, Homayoun R; Tankersley, Michael; Otto, Hans\n\n2011-05-01\n\nThis is a unique case of a previously healthy 7-year-old boy, which highlights the importance of considering immunodeficiency when a rare infection occurs. In the following case report, the patient develops constrictive pericarditis secondary to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. As a result of this infection, we speculate that he develops hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to the documented association between constrictive pericarditis and intestinal lymphangiectasia because an extensive work-up for a primary immunodeficiency was negative. This is the first case ever to present constrictive pericarditis because of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection.\n\nConstrictive Pericarditis 5 Months after Radiation Therapy in a 62-Year-Old Woman with Esophageal Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nYeneneh, Beeletsega T; Allen, Sorcha; Panse, Prasad; Mookadam, Farouk; Rule, William\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMost pericardial changes appear within a few weeks in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for thoracic neoplasms. Chronic pericardial constriction typically occurs decades later, consequent to fibrosis. Early constrictive pericarditis after chest irradiation is quite rare. We report the case of a 62-year-old woman who underwent radiation therapy for esophageal cancer and presented with constrictive pericarditis 5 months later. We searched the English-language medical literature from January 1986 through December 2015 for reports of early constrictive pericarditis after irradiation for thoracic malignancies. We defined \"early\" as a diagnosis within one year after radiation therapy. Five cases fit our criteria, and we summarize the findings here. To our knowledge, ours is the first definitive report of a patient with esophageal cancer to present with early radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis. We conclude that constrictive pericarditis can occur early after radiation for thoracic malignancies, albeit rarely. When planning care for cancer patients, awareness of this sequela is helpful.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of acute pericarditis from the normal variant: new electrocardiographic criteria\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGinzton, L.E.; Laks, M.M.\n\n1982-05-01\n\nWe examined the quantitative electrocardiographic differentiation of acute pericarditis from normal variant ST/T changes. The ECGs of 19 patients with acute pericarditis were compared with those of 20 subjects with typical normal variant changes. Patients were excluded if their ECGs demonstrated conditions that markedly altered repolarization. The positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of previously reported criteria were not high (PPV = 0.54 - 0.83, NPV = 0.56 - 0.58). In contrast, in the present study, a T-wave amplitude in lead V/sub 6/ of less than or equal to 0.3 mV diagnosed acute pericarditis (p < 0.005,moreÂ Â» PPV = 0.85, NPV = 0.85), but there was overlap of patients between the groups. The ratio of the amplitude of the onset of the ST segment of the amplitude of the T wave in that lead (ST/T ratio in V/sub 6/) proved to be the most reliable discriminator. An ST/T ratio greater than or equal to 0.25 diagnosed all patients with acute pericarditis (p less than or equal to 0.005, PPV = 1.0, NPV = 1.0). The ST/T ratio greater than or equal to 0.25 in V/sub 4/, V/sub 5/ (both p < 0.005, PPV = 0.87, NPV = 1.0) and I (p less than or equal to 0.005, PPV = 0.80, NPV = 0.81) were also significant discriminators. Thus, if V/sub 6/ is unavailable, an ST/T ratio greater than or equal to 0.25 in V/sub 5/, V/sub 4/ or I is highly suggestive of acute pericarditis. An ST/T ratio greater than or equal to 0.25 in V/sub 6/ discriminated the ECGs of all patients with acute pericarditis from normal variants in this study.Â«Â less\n\nPericarditis mediated by respiratory syncytial virus in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nRubach, M P; Pavlisko, E N; Perfect, J R\n\n2013-08-01\n\nWe describe a case of pericarditis and large pericardial effusion in a 63-year-old African-American man undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. Pericardial tissue biopsy demonstrated fibrinous pericarditis, and immunohistochemistry stains were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The patient improved with oral ribavirin and intravenous immune globulin infusions.

Diagnosis of Still's disease is often challenging. Infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions, especially in young children, Kawasaki disease may look similar. Clinicians often rely on echocardiographic evidence of coronary artery abnormalities to differentiate between Kawasaki disease and Still's disease. Coronary artery dilation would typically favour the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. We present four children with Still's disease and coronary artery abnormalities who were initially misdiagnosed as Kawasaki disease. The first patient had pericarditis and an irregular wall of the left coronary artery, without dilation on echocardiography. The second patient had a left coronary artery dilatation and a pericarditis. The third patient had thickened left coronary artery walls, and the fourth patient had a hyperechogenicity of the left and right coronary arteries. They received IVIG without success. The diagnosis of Still's disease was made secondary with evidence of persistent arthritis. All but one patient finally needed biologic treatments. Coronary abnormalities may be observed during various febrile conditions and do not exclude the diagnosis of Still's disease. Copyright Â© 2013 SociÃ©tÃ© franÃ§aise de rhumatologie.

Although cardiac complications are considered to be relatively common, no case of constrictive calcified pericarditis has ever been previously described in this setting.

Previous clinical reports have noted a beneficial effect of high-dose intravenous human immunoglobulins (IvIgs) in isolated and systemic inflammatory disease-related forms. In this article, we analyzed retrospectively our clinical experience with IvIg therapy in a series of clinical cases of pericarditis refractory to conventional treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 9 patients (1994 to 2010) with refractory recurrent pericarditis, who received high-dose IvIg as a part of their medical treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine treatment was not discontinued during IvIg treatment. No patients had a history of autoimmune or connective tissue diseases. During an average period of 11 months from the first recurrence, patients had experienced a mean of 5 relapses before the first IvIg treatment. In 4 cases, patients showed complete clinical remission with no further relapse after the first IvIg cycle. Two patients experienced a single minor relapse, responsive to short-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In 2 patients, we performed a second cycle of IvIg after a recurrence of pericarditis, with subsequent complete remission. One patient did not respond to 3 cycles of IvIg and subsequently underwent pericardial window and long-term immunosuppressive treatment. No major adverse effect was observed in consequence of IvIg administration in all the cases. In conclusion, although IvIg mode of action is still poorly understood in this setting, this treatment can be considered as an option in patients with recurrent pericarditis refractory to conventional medical treatment and, in our small series, has proved to be effective in 8 of 9 cases.

Although diabetes mellitus is known to be associated with an increased risk of multiple types of infections, purulent pericarditis is extremely rare. We herein report an unusual case of pericarditis caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies arizona that was not associated with any evident underlying immunosuppressive disorder apart from uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because a pet snake was suspected as being the source of infection in the present case, patient education and a detailed review of exposure history could play an important role in treating patients with diabetes mellitus.

Initially, a clinical diagnosis of viral pericarditis was made, because the child did not demonstrate hematologic or clinical manifestations of leukemia. Acute undifferentiated or lymphocytic leukemia. Acute undifferentiated or lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed one week after admission when his peripheral blood count became abnormal. The patient did not respond to vincristine and prednisone. When cytochemical evaluation indicated acute myelomonocytic leukemia, employment of cytosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine was instituted and the child began to improve. Currently, he is still in good remission and has no evidence of recurrence of pericarditis, 1 1/2 years after his initial presentation. In reviewing the literature, we found 17 patients who had leukemic pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. There are three reported cases of young children with pericardial effusion as the initial manifestation of acute lymphocytic leukemia, but no reported cases due to nonlymphocytic leukemia, as in this child.\n\nAcute Effusive Pericarditis due to Horse Chestnut Consumption\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEdem, Efe; KahyaoÄlu, BehlÃ¼l; Ãakar, Mehmet Akif\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPatient: Male, 32 Final Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion related to the consumption of herbal product Symptoms: Dyspnea Medication: Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L) Clinical Procedure: Pericardial and pleural effusions were drained through a pericardiopleural window Specialty: Cardiology Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: There are many well-known causes of pericardial effusion, such as cancer metastasis, bacterial or viral pericarditis, and uremic pericarditis; however, no reports exist in the literature demonstrating a pericardial effusion that led to cardiac tamponade following consumption of an herbal remedy. Case Report: A 32-year-old male patient was referred to our cardiology outpatient clinic with a complaint of dyspnea. The patientâs medical history was unremarkable; however, he had consumed 3 boxes of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L) paste over the previous 1.5 months. His chest x-ray examination revealed an enlarged cardiac shadow and bilateral pleural effusion. On transthoracic echocardiographic examination, his ejection fraction was found to be 55% with circumferentially extended pericardial effusion that reached 3.9 cm at its maximal thickness. No growth had been detected in the pericardial and pleural biopsies or blood samples; there was no evidence of an infectious process in the physical examination. Based on this information, we diagnosed pericarditis resulting from the use of herbal remedies. This is the first report to demonstrate that herbal remedy consumption may cause this type of clinical condition. Conclusions: Besides other well-known causes, pericardial effusion related to the consumption of herbal remedies should always be considered when treating patients with pericardial effusion caused by unclear etiologies.

After exploratory laparotomy and ventral cystotomy, unilateral idiopathic renal hematuria was diagnosed based on gross observation of hematuria from the left ureteral catheter. The hematuria resolved after nephrectomy of the left kidney. The histopathological diagnosis was multifocal, acute congestion and intratubular hemorrhage. Although idiopathic renal hematuria has been described previously, this puppy was unique because the hematuria caused recurrent, complete urethral obstruction.\n\nPurulent pericarditis with Salmonella enteritidis in a patient with CD4/CD8 depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakamiya, Yosuke; Shirai, Kazuyuki; Fujino, Masahiro; Miller, Nathan; Tsuchiya, Yoshihiro; Okabe, Masanori; Saku, Keijiro\n\n2008-06-01\n\nA 65-year-old man was admitted for high-grade fever with a shaking chill and general fatigue. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and echocardiography revealed a large amount of pericardial effusion. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, and Salmonella enteritidis was found in pericardial fluids. We diagnosed purulent pericarditis with S. enteritidis, and administered antibiotics. While high-grade fever resolved 10 days after beginning of treatment, effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP) without definite symptoms persisted for 2 months. Because of the improvement of his hemodynamic states on cardiac catheterization after 1 year, an operative procedure was not required. He was diagnosed as having CD4/CD8 depression without apparent diseases. There are few reports of pericarditis with S. enteritidis, and we believe this case might be only the second recorded case of ECP with S. enteritidis.\n\nCase report of an unusual combination of purulent pericarditis and false aneurysm of the ascending aorta.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeier, David; Kirsch, Matthias; Qanadli, Salah Dine; Muller, Olivier; Fishman, Daniel; Trana, Catalina\n\n2018-01-29\n\nPurulent pericarditis is an uncommon entity, which is, in very rare cases, associated to infection of the aorta. We present the case of a 42-year-old male patient, who was admitted to hospital complaining of tiredness, diarrhea and leg edema. Clinical examination revealed a hypotensive and obviously shocked patient. He was ultimately diagnosed with a rare combination of purulent pericarditis followed by false aneurysm of the ascending aorta. He was successfully treated by surgical pericardial drainage, replacement of the ascending aorta and antibiotics. Mycotic aneurysms can rarely be associated with purulent pericarditis. Our literature review shows that there are two mechanisms explaining this association and that in most of the published cases infective endocarditis could not be demonstrated.\n\nPattern not volume of bleeding predicts angiographic vasospasm in nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaya, Amanda; Zipfel, Gregory J; Diringer, Michael N; Dacey, Ralph G; Derdeyn, Colin P; Rich, Keith M; Chicoine, Michael R; Dhar, Rajat\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSpontaneous idiopathic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with a perimesencephalic bleeding pattern is usually associated with a benign course, whereas a diffuse bleeding pattern has been associated with a higher risk of vasospasm and disability. We evaluated whether volume of bleeding explains this disparity. Pattern and amount of bleeding (by Hijdra and intraventricular hemorrhage scores) were assessed in 89 patients with nonaneurysmal SAH. Outcomes included angiographic vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and functional outcome at 1 year. Diffuse bleeding was associated with significantly higher Hijdra and intraventricular hemorrhage scores than perimesencephalic SAH, Pâ¤0.003. Angiographic vasospasm was more likely in diffuse versus perimesencephalic SAH (45% versus 27%; odds ratio, 2.9; P=0.08), but adjustment for greater blood burden only partially attenuated this trend (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-7.2; P=0.18); delayed cerebral ischemia was only seen in those with diffuse bleeding. Patients with diffuse bleeding were less likely to be discharged home (68% versus 90%; P=0.01) and tended to have more residual disability (modified Rankin scale, 3-6; 20% versus 6%; P=0.18). Nonaneurysmal SAH can still result in vasospasm and residual disability, especially in those with diffuse bleeding. This disparity is only partially accounted for by greater cisternal or intraventricular blood, suggesting that the mechanism and distribution of bleeding may be as important as the amount of hemorrhage in patients with idiopathic SAH.\n\nEffusive-constrictive pericarditis as the manifestation of an unexpected diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarta, Liliana; Alves, Miguel; Peres, Marisa; Ferreira, Ricardo; Ferreira, Hugo; Leal, Margarida; Nobre, Ãngelo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nConstrictive pericarditis is a clinical condition characterized by the appearance of signs and symptoms of right heart failure due to loss of pericardial compliance. Cardiac surgery is now one of the most frequent causes in developed countries, while tuberculosis remains the most prevalent cause in developing countries. Malignancy is a rare cause but usually has a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis remains a clinical challenge and requires a combination of noninvasive diagnostic methods (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography); in some cases, cardiac catheterization is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The authors present the case of a 51-year-old man, hospitalized due to cardiac tamponade. Diagnostic investigation was suggestive of tuberculous etiology. Despite directed medical therapy, the patient developed effusive-constrictive physiology. He underwent pericardiectomy and anatomopathologic study suggested a neoplastic etiology.

To elucidate the effect of glycemic control on surgical outcomes of middle-aged and elderly idiopathic scoliosis patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a condition thought to adversely affect outcomes of spine surgery. However, no study has stratified glycemic control levels and their impact on outcome for idiopathic scoliosis patients receiving a spinal fusion surgery. Previous studies may have reported higher than true rates of complications for controlled diabetic patients, who are the majority of diabetic patients. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from years 2002 to 2011. We extracted idiopathic scoliosis patients older than 45 years of age that received spinal fusion and analyzed complications and outcomes variables among 3 cohorts: nondiabetic patients, controlled diabetics, and uncontrolled diabetics. Multivariate analyses were used to assess whether glycemic control was a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes. Controlled diabetics had significantly increased rates of acute renal failure (ARF), while uncontrolled diabetics had significantly increased rates of acute postoperative hemorrhage. In multivariate analyses controlling for patient factors and comorbidities, controlled DM was found to be an independent predictor of ARF [odds ratio (OR), 1.863; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.346-2.579; P=0.0002), and uncontrolled DM was found to be a significant risk factor for acute postoperative hemorrhage (OR, 2.182; 95% CI, 1.192-3.997; P=0.0115), ARF (OR, 4.839; 95% CI, 1.748-13.392; P=0.0024), deep vein thrombosis (OR, 5.825; 95% CI, 1.329-25.522, P=0.0194) and in-patient mortality (OR, 8.889; 95% CI, 1.001-78.945; P=0.0499).

From this perspective, liquid-based cytology (LBC) represents a feasible and reliable method for empowering the performance of ancillary techniques (ie, immunocytochemistry and molecular testing) with high diagnostic accuracy. In total, 3171 LBC pleural and pericardic effusions were appraised between January 2000 and December 2013. They were classified as negative for malignancy (NM), suspicious for malignancy (SM), or positive for malignancy (PM). The cytologic diagnoses included 2721 NM effusions (2505 pleural and 216 pericardic), 104 SM effusions (93 pleural and 11 pericardic), and 346 PM effusions (321 pleural and 25 pericardic). The malignant pleural series included 76 unknown malignancies (36 SM and 40 PM effusions), 174 metastatic lesions (85 SM and 89 PM effusions), 14 lymphomas (3 SM and 11 PM effusions), 16 mesotheliomas (5 SM and 11 SM effusions), and 3 myelomas (all SM effusions). The malignant pericardic category included 20 unknown malignancies (5 SM and 15 PM effusions), 15 metastatic lesions (1 SM and 14 PM effusions), and 1 lymphoma (1 PM effusion). There were 411 conclusive immunocytochemical analyses and 47 molecular analyses, and the authors documented 88% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 98% diagnostic accuracy, 98% negative predictive value, and 100% positive predictive value for FNAC. FNAC represents a primary diagnostic tool for effusions and a reliable approach with which to determine the correct follow-up. Furthermore, LBC is useful for ancillary techniques, such as immunocytochemistry and molecular analysis, with feasible diagnostic and predictive utility.

More recently, it has decreased to about 5%-20% and to <5% in the last decades, as hemodialysis techniques have become widely used and dialysis quality improved. The objective of this work is to determine the initial clinical picture and the prognosis of patients presenting End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) with UP. This is a retrospective study (May 2015-September 2017). Inclusion criteria targeted patients who had uremic pericarditis defined as pericarditis occurring in a patient with ESRD before initiation of renal replacement therapy, or within eight weeks of its initiation. 16 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age of patients was 54 [24, 71] years and 56.2% were male. Pericardial effusion was small, moderate and large in 31.2%, 37.6% and 31.2% of cases respectively. One pericardiocentesis was performed in view of a clinical picture of impending cardiac tamponade and three pericardial drainages were performed given presentation of tamponade. Hemodialysis was initiated for all the patients and continued for 2 to 3weeks until complete regression of the pericardial effusion. The mean number of dialysis sessions was 11Â±3.5. One patient died of septic shock"
