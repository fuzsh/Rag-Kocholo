He grew up in Zephyrhills, Florida, where he developed a lifelong passion for adventure and the great outdoors.\n\nBill was a man of many interests and talents. He deeply loved riding his motorcycle, feeling the freedom of the open road. His passion for flying airplanes allowed him to see the world from above, while scuba diving let him explore the wonders beneath the sea. A skilled photographer, Bill captured the beauty of life through his lens, cherishing moments that would last forever. Whether walking through nature or simply enjoying the feeling of grass beneath his feet in his backyard, Bill found joy in anything that kept him outdoors or without his shoes on.\n\nThose who knew Bill well knew he had a mischievous side. His joy was never quite so evident as when he was up to no good or playing a prank on someone. His personality and playful spirit remained with him until the very end. Bill was rough around the edges and unapologetically himself, which is a big part of what endeared him to so many.\n\nAbove all, Bill was a family man who loved fiercely and selflessly. He would sacrifice anything he had to help others. Bill was called home to join his parents, William Earl Lowe and Olivia Lowe as well as his half-sister Dorothy Painter, who preceded him. He is survived by his son William Lowe III, his daughters Michelle Thoey and Melody (Casey) Nelson, his sisters Marjorie Crayton, Rachel Bell, Bernice (Dexter) Uterhardt, and Joann Hunter, his grandchildren Jasmine Thoey, Dylan Thoey, Caitlyn Nelson, and William Lowe IV, and was expecting his first great-grandchild in November 2024.\n\nBill is loved and will be missed for his vibrant spirit, generous heart, and playful nature. His legacy of love, adventure, and selflessness will live on in the hearts of his family and friends.\n\nA celebration of Bill's life will be held on June 2nd at Vine Church in Zephyrhills with the public viewing to begin at 2 P.M. and the service to begin at 3 P.M. Bill will be laid to rest at Oakside Cemetery, may he rest in peace.\n\nTo view the service virtually, go to Bill's Facebook page, where it will be live streamed.\n\nHomer Phillip Waldon Jr.\n\n10/31/1948-04/13/2024\n\nPhil Waldon passed away peacefully on April 13,2024 in Tampa Florida. Born October 31,1948 to Homer and Josephine Jamieson Waldon in Ripley MS, Phil lived a wonderful life. As a child growing up in a small town, he was known to be mischievous and fun loving. He continued with that personality throughout his life. Phil graduated from South Tippah High School and afterwards served in the U S Army in Germany and Vietnam. He married Becky Holliday, and they had one son, Jay. He was employed by the US Postal Service and had wonderful coworkers, whom he loved and respected. Phil and Becky lived many years in Memphis TN where they made lifelong friends and established deep roots in the community. He loved to hike, camp, and go on adventures that could sometimes turn risky, but he persevered. He enjoyed travel on and off the beaten path and it was a big part of his life and retirement. He and Jay had some great trips/adventures. He and Becky traveled often with just each other but also with other couples, these trips were gratifying and memorable. He visited Costa Rica frequently, where he loved the quietness of his friends’ mountain top home. Other favorite ventures were travels to Vietnam. He visited Vietnam several times many years after his service there and grew to admire the people and the beauty of the country. He is survived by Becky, his son, Jay (Nikki) and granddaughter, Nola. He leaves his older brother, Gerald Waldon (Carol) and their families in Texas and Florida, Ann Waldon (sister- in -law) and Jennifer Waldon French (niece) in Memphis. He also leaves many friends who were supportive and loving during his illness. These include Joe Morton and John and Sue German, who were near him toward the end of his life. Within the last year, he became a member of The First Presbyterian Church (RPC) in Ripley, MS. He loved and appreciated the sermons and love of Dr. Jody Hill, the music, and the welcoming congregation. The family wishes to express heartfelt gratitude to all those who wrote, called, and sent support while Phil was ill. In addition, we are grateful to the Tampa VA Hospital and the staff who were a true blessing during a difficult time. Phil supported the DAV (Disabled American Veterans). He also supported RPC’s community -based missions. Donations in his memory may be made to the DAV or to the Ripley MS Presbyterian Church Missions Fund. A celebration of Phil’s life will be held in the future.\n\nDolores Monahan\n\n02/20/1935-04/09/2024\n\nDolores Monahan, a devoted nun of the Grey Franciscan Order and a beloved Catholic school teacher for over three decades, passed away at Good Shepard Hospice in Lakeland, FL on April 9th, 2024, at the age of 89.

She was born on November 8, 1932, to Alfred Melendez Hores and Leticia Rivera Rivera in Cayey, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the 1950s, she embarked on a journey to the continental United States, dedicating her life to work in the textile and manufacturing industry in Bridgeport, CT. Irma was more than just a hardworking individual; she was a passionate salsa dancer who found joy in evenings spent dancing away with friends. In Bridgeport, she embraced the roles of a loving mother to her two sons, Jose Antonio Rolon and Victor Luis Cruz.\n\nIrma leaves behind a legacy cherished by her surviving son, Victor, and siblings: Luis Alfredo (Negro), Wilfred (Wilfre), Lillian (Ian), Nelly, and Lydia (Chelin). Though her brother Hector (Falin) departed at a young age, their memories remain. Her grandchildren, Ronnie and his wife Takiya and Jasmin M., along with her great-grandchildren, Tea, Ryleigh, Alizah Marie, and Andrew, will forever treasure her love and wisdom. As well as her daughter-in-law Ludivina.\n\nIn the late '90s, Irma made Florida her home for retirement, living with her son. On July 15, 2000, Irma Melendez and her son were baptized as Jehovah's Witnesses, a pivotal and cherished moment in their spiritual journey. This act of dedication further solidified their faith, uniting them in a shared commitment to their beliefs and values. Her unwavering faith in Jehovah God sustained her.\n\nDespite limitations due to age, she radiated positivity and served as an inspiration to young hearts, encouraging wholehearted devotion to Jehovah. Engaging actively in various truth-related activities, she relished participating in meetings, offering insightful comments, and zealously taking part in the preaching work.\n\nAs her only living son, I find comfort in honoring my mother's memory. Her vibrant personality, boundless generosity, and love for everyone she encountered leave a lasting mark. Irma will be deeply missed, yet her warmth and memory will continue to touch the lives of all who had the joy of meeting her.\n\nIn writing this tribute, I reflect on the moments shared and the love she spread, leaving behind an irreplaceable presence. Though she's departed, she lives on in the hearts of those she touched. You will forever be loved and greatly missed. And I know that when the promise of Jehovah God is fulfilled, I will see you once more as beautiful as the day I first met you. Rev 21:3, 4\n\nGary Robert Springs, 81, of Brandon, Fla., died peacefully in his sleep on Oct. 28, 2023, after a courageous fight against pancreatic cancer.\n\nHe was born in Durand, Mich., in 1942 to Robert and Margaret Springs. He graduated in 1960 from Grayling (Mich.) High School, where he lettered in basketball and track and was somehow roped into the senior play. After what today would be called a “gap year” (or two), Gary enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, beginning a 20-year career that would take him and his family around the U.S. and the world, including tours of duty in Japan and the Philippines. While in the service, he earned an associates degree in Electrical Systems Technology from the Community College of the Air Force.\n\nIn 1966, Gary met Darlene Marie Cleveland, who was instantly ambivalent to his charms. But in a classic case of persistence paying off, he won her over, and they were married on Aug. 13, 1966, in Grayling, Mich. Together, they started a family, and their three children meant the world to them.\n\nAfter retirement from the military in 1982, Gary and the family moved to Brandon, Fla., where he undertook a second career, first as an electronics instructor at Tampa Technical Institute and United Electronics Institute, and then as a communication and electronics technician for the Hillsborough County School district, where he served until his “second retirement” in 2009.\n\nSettling in Brandon, Gary became an active member first of the Brandon First Church of the Nazarene and then, later, of New Hope Church. Gary’s Christian faith was central to his life, and he strove to be a servant leader, including stints as Sunday school superintendent and church board member at First Church. He participated in several “work and witness” trips to help churches and spread the Word in Costa Rica and Ukraine.\n\nRetirement Number Two brought more time – time to spend with Darlene doing the things that they loved. They went out to eat (Gary could not resist a good steak), they got to know their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and they traveled. They visited their beloved Smoky Mountains many times. They ate fresh lobster in Maine on a road trip to the Canadian Maritimes. They took in the beauty of St. Petersburg, Russia, on a Baltic Sea cruise. They prayed in the Garden where Christ did in Jerusalem. And they did it all the only way they wanted to – together.\n\nGary was a lifelong Republican, but, more importantly, he was a lifelong Michigan Wolverines fan. (He’ll be terribly disappointed to miss it should the Maize and Blue finally get around to winning the national championship this year.) He loved watching sports, and March Madness was always a highlight for him. He enjoyed finding and riding vintage trains and loved working on cars before it took a PhD to do so. His quiet demeanor hid a fierce competitor who refused to let his children win at anything until they earned it. (Scrabble and chess were two of his favorite instruments of this form of “tough love.”) He fancied himself a whiz at cooking whose rare stints in the kitchen produced such delicacies as fried bologna, fried oatmeal, and green mashed potatoes. (Gary’s answer to any question about how to properly prepare food was to a. fry it, and / or b. add food coloring.)\n\nGary is survived by his beloved wife of 57 years, Darlene M. Springs; son Greg (Dawn) Springs; daughter Cheryl (James) Clark; son David (Hope) Springs; his eight grandchildren: Allen Clark, Steven (Katerina) Clark, Kayla (Joseph) Mathias, Abigail Springs, Katherine Springs, Andrew Springs, Molly Springs and Grace Springs; his four great-grandchildren: Liam Clark, HavenPerry, Daisy Mathias, and Noah Mathias; his siblings Richard Springs of Kingman, Ariz., and Don Springs, of Byron, Mich.. Gary was preceded in death by his mother, father and by his sister, Linda Mae Rowley.\n\nA memorial service will be held at New Hope Church (213 North Knights Ave., Brandon, FL, 33510) on Saturday, Nov. 11, at 10:30 a.m. Lunch will follow. In lieu of flowers, donationsmay be made to New Hope Church (please note “Children’s Ministry” in the memo line of any checks).\n\nOur family is sad to announce the passing of Dewane Richard Bennett, 79, of Valrico, FL on October 21, 2023.\n\nDewane passed peacefully away in the Hospice House, Sun City Center, FL after a very short battle with Liver Cancer that left the family totally devastated. He only survived 5 days after entering Brandon Hospital\n\nand being diagnosed with this fatal disease.\n\nDewane was born in Streator, IL and was adopted as an Infant by his loving Mother and Father Charles and Bernice Bennett who both preceded him in death.\n\nDewane was preceded in death by his first wife Evelyn, along with their unborn third child.

There was never a thought that any of them were step children to either. The children were raised together by a loving Mom and Dad.\n\nDewane is survived by 12 Grandchildren, and 24 Great Grandchildren, numerous Nieces, Nephews, Sister in laws, Brother in laws, cousins, and more friends than you can imagine.\n\nDewane’s family moved to this area when he was a young man. He graduated from Brandon High School\n\nin 1962 and joined the Air Force in which he served for 3 and 1/2 years and was honorably discharged to come home and take care of his dying father.\n\nDewane started at Nitram Inc. in Tampa shortly after it opened and worked 36 years as Master Maintenance Mechanic. He specialized in pumps, so when Nitram’s doors closed 2003, he worked another 4 years for Hudson Pumps in Bartow, FL.\n\nDewane stayed a member of Nitram Family Friends and attended all the get together sessions since the Plant closed.\n\nHe and Beverly sold their family home in Clair Mel City, in 2007 and moved into their beloved Strawberry Ridge Mobile Home park in 2007\n\nDewane and Beverly have been very active in the activities at “The Ridge,” but Dewane’s favorite’s were Bingo and Card Games.\n\nThe loss of this man is felt by so many, it’s impossible to comprehend.\n\nDewane was there to help, no matter for who or what, and he was loved by his family unconditionally and will be missed by each of them and every life he’s touched in his 79 years.\n\nThe family is honoring Dewane with a Celebration of Life in his clubhouse at Strawberry Ridge, Highway 60, Valrico, FL on Saturday, November 18th at 1:30. The family will provide a luncheon, but a covered dish or dessert would be greatly appreciated. Come and join us celebrate the life of this wonderful man who will be missed by all he touched with love and kindness and will be forever remembered.\n\nOn Saturday, April 23, 1949, in Villa Rica, GA, William & Lois Cochrane welcomed their second child and only daughter into the world. They named her Linda Jewel Cochrane. Her parents had 3 more boys giving Linda 4 brothers totally. Older brother Larry, younger brothers Gregory, Hal and Johnny. She had a bright personality and loved to talk. She had a sweet, perhaps sometimes being considered “a lot”, reputation for talking everyone’s ears off. Seizing most any positive opportunity that came her way Linda lived a truly fascinating life. She truly lived and LOVED to the fullest.\n\nThe stories from her childhood with her brothers were many. Growing up with very little they learned to cherish the little things and to make the most out of life. Linda and her brothers would “hope” aka help granddaddy with cotton, had to go to an outhouse - no electricity, running water nor plumbing, some pets with VERY interesting names and when they finally did have electricity and a phone it was a party line. Her family moved quite a bit. Some moves due to circumstances some by choice. After attending 22 different schools growing up her family made their final move together to Florida. Linda briefly attended Chamberlain but then graduated from Leto High School in 1967. It was at Leto where she had a very dear group of friends that she affectionately called her “ Leto Girls”. She so enjoyed keeping up with them through the years. Even before social media, Ms Shirley diligently kept the group together for which they were all thankful and still keep in touch today.\n\nIn 1978 Linda ands few friends went out dancing. Linda was not a drinker and she turned down several offers for drinks and to dance because there was a guy with whom she had been making eye contact with the entire evening. He would later admit he was a bit nervous because he noticed her turning others down. He finally got the nerve and asked her to dance. They were both done. One year later July 1, 1979 they were married. Linda loved her bonus son John. Talking him to TeeBall practices and games were fond memories she’d share. In April 1980 Bill and Linda welcomed their daughter Tabitha into the world. Bill’s WildChild Punkin and Linda’s babydoll. The Craft family had a lot of fantastic memories and fun times with family and good friends. Christmas Eve family at their home on Hollowtree Dr. Days on the water with the railroad crew and their families. Always an adventure to find; . Life with its guaranteed ups and downs their family was for better or for worse, rich or poor, sickness and health they were family; they LOVED fierce and protectively.\n\nIn 1992 heartbreak hit the Craft family and Bill lost his battle with lung cancer. It was a lot for the young family. Linda did her very best to keep her head above water. She quietly fought the negativity of emotions, anger, sadness and loneliness. She strived to make sure everyone’s needs were met.\n\nLinda had a career that her intrigued; the medical field with its always changing fast paced environment was her cup of tea. She embraced the novel new things to learn in various fields. She was good at pronouncing the words, naming the body parts, navigating the paperwork and insurance. She enjoyed learning all things medical from the office and coordination side. She made many dear friends while working at hospitals and doctor’s offices through the 70s-early 2000’s when she took an early retirement due to kidney and other health issues.\n\nWith her declining health and failing kidney\n\nTabitha asked her a series of questions recently, a “7 questions to ask your mom” social media trends. One of the questions was, “What is your favorite memories with me?”\n\nLinda replied, “swimming in the pool with my family.”\n\nLinda was generous, kind and caring. She cherished quality time with her family and friends and enjoyed dancing, laughing, trying new things and traveling with the special people in her life.\n\nLinda passed peacefully on Thursday, September 21, 2023.\n\nShe was looking forward to being at home with her aloes and Savior Jesus Christ as well as being reunited with her loves that preceded her: husband Bill Craft, mother and father William and Lois Cochrane, brother Hal Cochrane, and other dear family members and friends that passed before her.\n\nShe leaves behind a daughter Tabitha Davis (Neil), son John Craft (Amanda), grandchildren Justin Cotter (Maddie), Lauralee Watkins (Logan) 1st great grandson William, Lily Craft, Elizabeth Craft, Lydia Davis and Hollis Davis. She’s also had two bonus daughters Heather Lawrence and Kelly Gay.\n\nThe family will have a Celebration of Life honoring Linda Jewel Cochrane Craft on Saturday, September 30 at 1:PM at Bethany Baptist Church, 3409 Cork Rd, Plant City, FL 33565. There will be plenty of food and the family looks forward to visitation after the service in the fellowship hall. Tabitha’s church family and cousin Joyce are coordinating food. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\ntabithaldavis@gmail.com or text 813-763-6418\n\nPaul Douglas Saunders Jr., was tragically taken from this world on August 14, 2023. Paul was known to be a man you could count on, always willing to really connect with people, to get to know them well, and to be there when you needed him, even in your darkest hour. He was generous in the best way a person could be, by giving his time, attention, and love. He had a great sense of humor. He was brave and courageous in so many ways, and joyful to be riding the bikes that he so loved. He did not hesitate to stand up for what he believed in or to defend the people he cared about.

We will all miss him dearly.\n\nPaul has been preceded in death by many close friends, and we are happy to think of them and a happy reunion.\n\nBut, sadly, he leaves behind in this world many who loved him, who were blessed to be a recipient of his love.

Born on November 30, 1954 in Shawano, Wisconsin. He moved with his parents to St. Petersburg, Florida where he completed high school at Dixie Hollins, and college at the University of South Florida, before going to the University of Miami for medical school. Joe was first and foremost a family person, though: a husband, father, brother, and friend.\n\nEver since Joe backpacked in Europe as a young adult, he loved travel and shared this love with his children. He loved to learn, and had something new each day that intrigued him. He would try to figure out how to invest in these ideas, another interest he developed. Far and away his happiest place was Flathead Lake in Montana where he spent countless hours pulling his children on skis, wakeboards, and an Airchair.\n\nIn his work life as an Emergency Physician, he sought to provide excellent care not only by keeping up in his professional knowledge, but also by listening very carefully to his patients. “No one comes to the Emergency Department for fun. Even if it doesn’t look like an emergency to me, it is to them.” After retiring, he loved calls from his sons in the medical field to discuss cases.\n\nIn the past few years, his daily prayers for family, friends, and the world were increasingly important to him. “I know I have too much to do, but I want to say my prayers.” Afterwards, he felt more at peace.\n\nJoe is survived by his wife, Karen Olson, his children Christian Buth (wife, Lindsay Castrillo), Lily Cremer (husband, Ishmael Cremer), Olivia Buth, and Zachary Buth, as well as his stepson, Erik Morinaga. He was able to meet his one grandson, Archer Armstrong Cremer in the month before he died. He is also survived by his brothers, Fred Buth and Jonathan Buth. Joe was preceded in death by his father Llewellyn Buth, his mother, Helen (Hinman) Buth, his brother, Llewellyn Buth, and his son, Andrew Armstrong Buth.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on August 13, 2023, at 4 pm at All Saints Episcopal Church in Lakeland, Florida. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made to Raining Cats and Dogs Shelter and Sanctuary, Inc. in Plant City to continue his legacy of compassion for animals.\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved mother, Shirleyann Vincent, who departed from this world on Wednesday, July 19, 2023. She was a towering beacon of love, strength, and kindness to all who knew her. As a devoted wife, nurturing mother, and cherished friend, she touched countless lives with her compassion and selflessness.\n\nShirleyann was born on Sunday, November 10, 1957, to Carl and Theresa De Souza in Trinidad, West Indies. She was the second of their four children; Bernardo who predeceased her, Karen and Frank. From an early age, she displayed an unwavering dedication to her family, which she continued throughout her life. Her love knew no bounds and she always put the needs of her loved ones before her own.\n\nShirleyann, she was the epitome of patience, guiding her children with a gentle hand and providing unwavering support in every endeavor. Her home was a sanctuary of warmth and love, where laughter and joy were abundant. She instilled in her children the values of love, compassion, and resilience.\n\nShirley had a zest for life and an infectious smile that brightened any room she entered. She loved cooking and baking and was known for her bake and saltfish, peas and rice, and black cake…which she shared with anyone around. Her passion for gardening and decorating allowed her to create beautiful landscapes that were a reflection of her nurturing spirit.\n\nShe leaves behind a legacy of love and kindness that will forever be cherished by her devoted husband Hubert Vincent Jr., her loving children, Natalie, Kevin, daughter-in-law Nabiha, her adoring grandchildren, Brittyn, Ava and welcoming soon, Miles and her mother-in-law Julie Vincent. She will also be dearly missed by her surviving mother Theresa, brother Frank, sister Karen, brother-in-law Francisco, sister-in-law Cherylann Booker, brother-in-law Jeffery Booker, and her vast extended family and friends.\n\nAs we bid farewell to our beloved mother, let us remember the immeasurable impact she had on our lives. Though she is no longer physically with us, her love will forever reside in our hearts. We find solace in the beautiful memories we created together and take comfort knowing that she is watching over us from above.\n\nA memorial service to celebrate the life of Shirleyann Vincent will be held on July 28, 2023, at 11:00 AM at Nativity Catholic Church.

She now rests peacefully, joining her late husband, Reynaldo R. Espino, Sr., and her late sons, Eduardo and Melchor Espino, in eternal embrace. Roberta is survived by her remaining eight children, Aprilina, Reynaldo Jr., Fernando, Edna, Roberto, Annabelle, Luningning, and Gener, her grandchildren, and great grandchildren.\n\nRoberta was born on the 8th of June, 1927, to her father Pedro Fernando and mother Maxima Lopez in San Pedro, Guagua, Pampanga of the Philippines. From a young age, Roberta showed great intellect and tenacity. She was only a teenager when the Japanese invaded the Philippines in WWII. At the tender age of 14, Roberta got sick with a fever, and in the days she spent recovering from her illness, studied and taught herself how to speak Japanese. To prove herself useful to the Japanese soldiers, she became an interpreter and helped them navigate the markets. Her favorite parlor trick was writing the soldiers’ names in Japanese on watermelons. She was a natural born businesswoman, displaying grit and determination in every endeavor.\n\nRoberta was an extraordinary woman known for her incredible strength, compassion, generosity, and unwavering love for her family. Though she spent the first half of her life poverty-stricken, she was a skilled homemaker, and nurtured her home with warmth and love, creating a haven for her family to thrive. She didn’t have much, but she worked tirelessly to provide for her family. One of her many businesses included traveling to different markets, buying and selling fish, fruits, and vegetables for profit.\n\nRoberta’s son, Reynaldo Jr., joined the US Navy and in 1989, petitioned her to immigrate to the United States, where she spent some years with him and his family. She made frequent trips back home to the Philippines; visiting her other children and grandchildren, and gave back generously to her relatives and community. Eventually, Roberta moved to Brandon, Florida to live with her son Fernando, and was later joined by her children Gener, Annabelle, Roberto, Luningning and their families. This is where she lived out the rest of her precious life, surrounded by love and given the utmost care.\n\nWithin the Espino clan, Roberta held a special place as the head of the family. As a true matriarch, she not only raised her ten children, but played a significant role in molding and caring for each of her grandchildren. Her culinary prowess was unmatched, as she could whip up the most delicious meals that brought joy to the hearts and stomachs of her loved ones. Her humor and wit lit up the room, and her family cherished the immense laughter she brought to their lives. She fiercely defended her loved ones, standing as a steadfast protector in times of need.\n\nRoberta achieved many great things in her life, but perhaps the greatest of them all is the impact she had on her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren whom she loved so fervently and unconditionally. Today, her family tree spans multiple continents, and her legacy of love and the importance of family will live on through them for generations to come.\n\nRoberta's life was as remarkable as she was, and it stands as a testament to her inner strength, kindness, and zest for life. Everything she did, she did wholeheartedly. She embraced every moment with enthusiasm and spread joy wherever she went. Her memory will forever be etched in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know her.\n\nThough we mourn the loss of an extraordinary woman, let us also rejoice in the beautiful memories and profound impact Roberta had on our lives. Her spirit will continue to shine brightly, guiding and inspiring us as we move forward.\n\nFriends and family are invited to gather for a memorial service from 09:00 am to 11:00 am on the 21st of June, 2023, at Brandon Cremation and Funeral Services, located at 106 Rolling Hills Blvd., Valrico, FL, 33594. Following the burial services at Serenity Meadows, 6919 Providence Rd, Riverview, Florida 33578, at 1pm we invite you to celebrate Roberta's life at 1906 Red Fox Lane, Brandon, Florida 33510.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that donations be made in Roberta's honor to Aging With Dignity.

Espino and carry forward her legacy of love, resilience, and unwavering devotion to family.\n\n\"And I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'

Juanita loved movies and made many friends by attending sneak previews of movies. She enjoyed live shows at the Performing Arts Center.

Lucille is survived by daughter; Brenda Ficken (Michael), sons; Richard Higgins (Maritza), Ernest Higgins (Lesa), grandchildren; Mychelle Russell (Mike), Jeffery Cooper, Nicholas Ficken (Barbie), Melissa Ficken, Stephanie, Chey, Richard Jr., Shawn, Thomas Jr., Rodney (Theresa), Joseph, & Tara Higgins, Sheryl Truhn (Alan), Kimberly Wandmacher (Craig) , Jessica Riehl (Don), Chris Remus. great grandchildren: Rebecca & Austin Russell, Logan, Sophia, & Savannah Ficken, Anthony & Maria Nicopolis Johnathan Dingman, Aaliyah, Kendall, Sasha, Claytan, James, Nevaeh, Thomas, & Bailey Higgins, Laura Leiter, Kayla McMaken (Tom), Kelly & Jenifer Truhn, Chelsey & Kelsey Wandmacher, many great great grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends (all of which she considered family). Lucille was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on July 12, 1929. She attended a one room schoolhouse that housed 1st-8th grade. Lucille loved to dance. Any opportunity to dance she would be dancing whether at a party or in the kitchen while she was doing dishes and laundry. She also loved to tell your fortune with a deck of cards (9-A only). Something her mother Rose taught her how to do. On May 17, 1947, she married Samuel Higgins even though he was in Ancker hospital with a shattered leg in traction caused by a motorcycle accident. Sam’s sister Aleda insisted that the wedding would still go on. With the Pioneer Press photographing, the wedding ceremony took place at the groom’s bedside. Lucille & Sam raised 6 kids together. Family time was going to the cabin, any lake or traveling around the county in the camper truck Sam built visiting friends and family. Many weekends were spent at Sam’s brother Ed’s farm. Holidays always with extended family. It didn’t matter that nobody had a house to handle the large group, family still got together. When the youngest was in school Lucille got her driver’s license. From that point on she was always on the go. Lucille went to work cleaning offices and later worked as a Social Worker for the Hennepin County welfare department. Meeting and talking with clients to help sort out their needs and signing them up for services. When a client would not open the door to any social worker, Lucille was the one called in. Lucille was known as the one that could get the job done with the most resistant of clients. Lucille loved her job helping people. Unfortunately, her career was cut short when she started losing her eyesight. By the time the doctors figured out she had glaucoma, she was legally blind. She could still see, but due to the loss of her peripheral vision she could no longer drive or work in the office efficiently enough. Lucille then went back to cleaning offices, which became a blessing a short time later. God works in mysterious ways. On March 25, 1980, her husband of 33yrs passed away. Everything happens for a reason.\n\nIn the fall of 1980, Lucille made a comment to her boss, George Cuthill, that she was very lonely and needed to find a man. George said he knew the perfect man for her. George was renting a room from Vernon Ranum. George introduced Vern and Lucille. They were a perfect match. Vern had been a bachelor for over 25yrs after his wife JoAnn died during childbirth. The first time Lucille went to Vern’s home, she noticed the framed Pioneer Press Article from May 17, 1947, of her hospital bedside wedding to Sam. Lucille asked Vern why he had that article framed. Vern responded that he was so inspired by the love of that couple, that he prayed that the Lord would help him find a woman like that someday. Lucille responded, “Well, you found her!” Vern was the angel sent by God to guide Lucille into the life of blindness. Vern married Lucille and joined her family of 6 children, their spouses, & 13 grandchildren on Valentines Day 1981. Lucille and Vern were so happy together. They loved, laughed, and traveled together like Recycled Teenagers. The only complaint Lucille had was that Vern was too slow. She said sometimes she had to draw a line to see if he moved.\n\nIn 1985 they moved to Brandon, Florida following her 2 daughters who had moved there in 1981-82 and son, Tom who had married & stayed in Florida after the Navy. Her other 3 sons followed shortly after. She loved having all her kids and grandchildren around her. Lucille and Vern were reverse snowbirds going back to Minnesota every summer staying with her sister Alice and visiting family and friends. Lucille gradually over the years continued to lose her sight until she could no longer see any light at all in her mid-80’s. Vern and Lucille were a couple that stood out. Vern the tall handsome swede that dotted over his bride being her eyes and Lucille was the short feisty lady that was his ears keeping him moving. Anything that Lucille wanted, Vern would do. When Vern passed away in 2013 Lucille was so sad and lost. She missed him so much that she lost half her body weight (what a diet). One of her grandchildren asked her if she was going to find another man? She responded, “I don’t think I have another 30 years”!Over the next 10 years it took many people to fill Vern’s shoes of caring for Lucille. Other than her sight Lucille was still very healthy and self-sufficient. Only needing someone to be her eyes, transportation, and companion. Her son Tom, daughters Diane & Brenda, granddaughter Tara, nephew Jimmy, niece Barbara, &son-in-law Larry filled this need for many years. April 2019 Lucille had a major stroke leaving her to need a great deal more care. After only 8 weeks in a nursing home her daughters realized there was no nursing home that would be able to take care of their mother to their expectations. Lucille went back to Diane’s home until November 2019 when her daughter Brenda finished the construction of her new home and moved Lucille in with her family. Diane continued to help until her death Aug 26, 2020. Lucille’s health continued to decline, needing more care. Several people helped at this time; daughter: Brenda, son-in-law Mike, granddaughters: Tara, Melissa, Chelle, & Stephanie, Niece: Barbara, friends: Laura, Judy, Iris, and Diana-the person that took the last shift.Lucille’s family is very grateful to Diana and Empath Hospice for helping them through the last difficult 6 months.Everyone says it takes a village to raise a child. It also takes a village to care for our elderly!\n\nGod has a plan. Everything happens for his reasons and in his time!\n\nMay God grant us: The serenity to accept the things we cannot change. The courage to change the things we can, and The wisdom to know the difference\n\nLucille’s passing is a true blessing. She was so ready for her wings. Praise God for honoring her wish to join all that left before her.\n\nJAMES YERGER WINKELJOHN\n\nJames Yerger Winkeljohn, 77, died Friday, March 24, 2023 in Bradenton, Florida, after a long battle with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“Jim” was born in Biloxi, Mississippi at the close of WWII on August 30, 1945, to Walter and Marjory Winkeljohn.

She collected seashells,\n\nvolunteered on the Turtle Patrol, fished, and took walks on the beach. The screened-in porch was a\n\nfavorite place to relax and spend time with loved ones. Diane was known for her green thumb, as\n\nevidenced by the beautiful flower and vegetable gardens she created wherever she lived. Diane was an\n\noutstanding cook and her grandchildren especially loved her cookies. Her secret ingredient was love\n\nand nothing was more important than her family. She was a very loving wife and mother. She was a\n\nchampion of her sons. Every decision was made with the family in mind, especially her children, and\n\nthen her grandchildren.

He was preceded in death by his parents, Vernon Charles Ricketts, Sr. and Catherine Leola (Hill) Ricketts; his brothers Vernon Charles Ricketts, Jr., Lawrence Eugene Ricketts, Allan K. Ricketts, Sr., and his sister Karen Janet (Ricketts) Bellotte. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Jean Loving Ricketts; his daughters Angela Lynn Cline (Bill), Krista Leigh Henderson (David), Wendy Laine Maxwell (Scott), Tiffany Laing Brush (Joel); his grandchildren Bryce Wesley Cline (Keri), Austin Toliver Cline, Cailey Cline Kerley (Andrew), Ashley Victoria Cline, Hannah Nicole Thomley ( Jason), Tyler David Henderson, Lindsay Grace Henderson, Brett Anthony Maxwell, Jake Andrew Maxwell (Tiffany), Lily Lucille Brush, Aaron Joseph Brush, and Benjamin Gallant Brush; his brother Norman Leslie Ricketts (Ann); as well as two great-grandchildren.\n\nGary was born in St. Petersburg, Florida on April 8, 1946. His family soon moved to South Tampa, just steps from Tampa Bay. Gary and his brothers could always be found out on the water, fishing, skiing, or building boats. He kept that love of the outdoors throughout his life.\n\nHe attended Chamberlain High School, and there he met a spunky cheerleader named Jean Loving. He was smitten, carried her books to class for her, and looked for any chance to talk to her. After graduation in 1964, he went on to University of Florida to study Finance. Soon after, in 1967, Gary and Jean were married. Once he finished his degree, they moved back to Tampa and Gary began working in construction with his oldest brother, Charlie. The next year he founded Ricketts Builders, Inc. and built many custom homes in the Brandon area.\n\nGary and Jean had four daughters. He was the most patient, kind, resourceful, and tenderhearted husband and father. He gave all he could to take care of his family, and Gary and Jean loved teaming up to surprise the girls with unexpected gifts or adventures. One year, they built a custom fort in the backyard out of scrap lumber, working all night on Christmas Eve so it would be ready on Christmas morning! He was the type of father that loved to spend quality time with his daughters, whether it was going to work with him on a job site, helping with odd jobs at home or simply watching TV. Even today you will find streets in some Brandon neighborhoods named after his beloved daughters.\n\nGary retired from building and began selling insurance in the 1980’s. Over the years he represented Prudential, AFLAC, and United Healthcare. He was also a gifted teacher, always ready to share his knowledge of construction, auto mechanics, fishing, hunting, or insurance. He was passionate about helping people, always looking for an opportunity to lend a hand to anyone who needed his help. He had a knack for creative problem-solving and even earned the name “Tricky Rick” among some of his best friends, which eventually became his CB handle.\n\nGary loved the Lord, and his walk with Christ began soon after being invited to a mid-week Bible study by his fellow Army reserve buddy, Mike Jergins. According to Gary, not only was the message moving, but the acapella singing really struck a chord with him! Gary was an active and devoted member of the Plant City Church of Christ, serving as an elder there for many years. He was a man of utmost integrity, striving to do right by others and always set an example of faith and perseverance.\n\nWhen Gary was diagnosed with ALS in 2021, his perspective of gratitude was an inspiration to others. He said God had blessed him, and he had a good life, and a loving family. He felt he had been given more than he deserved, and he was truly grateful. He bravely fought ALS, never complaining, and keeping a positive outlook even as the disease took his strength and independence away from him, bit by bit. He cheerfully looked for strategies to overcome challenges, and enjoyed his days as much as he could, even to the end.\n\nGary will be sorely missed by his family and all who knew him. Services will be held at Plant City Church of Christ on Saturday, November 12, 2022, with Visitation at 10 am, followed by a Memorial Service at 11 am. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to The ALS Therapy Development Institute at https://www.als.net/donate.\n\nMelvin Terrance Hulburt (Terry) passed away on July 29t* 2022 while in St. Joe's Seasons Hospice at the age of 77. He leaves behind his 2 adult children, Doug and Alissa Hulburt and 3 grand dogs Snooki, Beau and Yara. He loved all animals as His wife Roz would bring home dogs and cats of any age to foster and love and he had no choice in that decision but would do anything for Roz LOL. He loved them all and thev loved him. he was like an animal whisperer. Terry was born on January 7th 1945 to Margaret and Melvin Hulburt in Youngstown Ohio. He was an only child but grew up with so much love and joy in his home. He loved to play baseball as a kid and into his young adult life for fun on social leagues. He attended and graduated from Youngstown State University. During this time he had been dating a girl name Rosalyn whom he married on Sept git 1967. They had 2 kids and moved to Florida where they settled and raised their familv. Terry was a tall, strong reserved man of few words but when he did have something to say he had a deep voice that often intimidated many of Alissa's boyfriends and Doug's friend as well (haha) Some still talk about it to this day. He was famous for making his delicious meatballs on our Sunday family dinners. He loved watching the Cleveland Indians play, the Bucs and the Browns during football season and loved\n\nto play and watch golf. Terry had a strong belief in God and was a member of the Nativity Catholic church for years and at one point joined the choir. Being in the choir made him happy and feel closer to God. Terry has proceeded in death bv his wife Roz of 54 ears and his parents He was loved more then he will ever know. He will be greatly and deeply missed. Doug and Alissa will be returning them home tor their eternal rest in Youngstown Ohio In Oct\n\nOn August 23, 2022 we lost a kind and gentle human. Carl A. Dowell loved his family and friends beyond measure. If you knew Carl you understood less words were more. He shared his love through action and humor. When I say humor, he was hysterical! His quick wit and one liners made us all laugh out loud constantly. You never really knew what he was going to say. Carl had a passion for the Native American cultural. He was well respected in the knapping community. He was a master knapper who could entertain all ages while he was explaining what he was doing. He did demos at museums that were opening paleo displays, libraries that had summer programs for kids, and for countless years he did demos for Florida Elderhostel programs. His arrowheads were a work of art. He spent endless hours in the fields with his children, family and friends hunting arrowheads and teaching them about nature. Carl used to say, “Only the stone lives forever.” His daughter Sandy to this day can identify the different birds by the sounds they make. Carl’s son, Ian spent many afternoons and evenings fishing and hunting with his father. When the two of them got together the fish got bigger and bigger or so they say! One of the things Mary Lynne, his daughter treasured about her father was his work ethic and integrity especially about leaving things better than the way you found them, doing things the right way and helping others. He was a man with a big heart. Carl and his wife Dawne were married for almost 25 years. Carl served in the Navy. The two of them traveled from Australia to Panama and met indigenous peoples that he shared his arrowheads with them and made bonds all over the world. They spent their lives traveling together and were completely devoted to each other. Carl leaves behind three children; Sandy Dowell, Mary Lynne Hicks, and Ian C. Dowell along with his Stepchildren; Christopher I. Wiederspan, Leslie C. Wiederspan and Jason L. Berlowitz. Carl also leaves behind seven grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren. Carl also leaves behind Barbara Vickerman, and proceeded in death by his brother Billy Dowell. There will be a small celebration of life with his children, wife and sister-in-law in December 2022 on a cruise ship which was one of the things Carl loved to do. He was an amazing person who will be missed by all who knew him\n\nI am heartbroken to announce the death of our mom, Katherine J. Price, age 73 when she ran into the arms of Jesus peacefully into a new body on June 23, 2022 at 9:20 a.m. with her children by her side in her home. A celebration of life potluck will be held on July 30, 2022 at her home located at 807 Papaya Dr. Tampa, FL at 12:00 p.m. Please do not bring flowers per her request.\n\nKathy was born on November 25, 1948 in Tampa Fl. She was predeceased by her only husband Robert “Bobby” Price, her parents Louis and Idell Gentry, sister Patsy Gentry, brother Danny Gentry and sister Jean Fields. Kathy is survived by her two children son Robert L. Price II, daughter Jody Cannon and son-in law Ron Cannon, her four grandchildren Jericho “Willy”, Cortney “Mo” (Ethan Harllee), Dean “Zeke”, Emma “Little Jo” and two great grandchildren Sundae “Lobo” and Ezekiel “Zeke”. Two brothers Dewayne Gentry and Gary and Viola Gentry and her sister-in law Shirley Keener, many nieces, nephews, family, friends and neighbors.\n\nKathy loved working with crafts along side of her husband Bobby, not to mention she LOVED to collect Coke memorabilia and going to the casino. Her last wish was to travel to WVA to see “Bobby’s People” and her wish was fulfilled. She got to do everything that she wished for. Upon return little did we know that in less than 48 hours her life would be turned upside down.\n\nOne thing you always knew about Kathy, was what was on her mind because she never hesitated to give you a piece of her mind. She was bold and was never afraid to speak up. ERP!\n\nKathy received Jesus in her heart when she was 12 years old while attending 40th Street Baptist Church and Bro. King was preaching. We mourn but we have that Blessed Hope that we will be reunited again.\n\nKathy was born with severe scoliosis and she lived a life full of pain. She said just days before she left this world that she was ready to go home and leave this life because her pain level was so severe. At the very moment she entered Heaven she received her new body with a straight back and no more pain. Even though our hearts are sad we are so happy for her to finally be whole and pain free.\n\nServices will be officiated by Rick Price, nephew from WVA.\n\nBill Honea, 78, passed away peacefully on April 6th after a courageous battle with cancer. He is survived by his beloved wife of 36 years, Susan Wellner; his sons, Brian (Klancee), Kevin (Roseann), William; his grandchildren, Michael, Jenna Rose, Justin; and his brother, John Frederick. He was preceded in death by his parents, Morris and Dorothy (Hedgcock), and his son, Christopher.\n\nBill was born in Glendale, CA, and grew up in North Hollywood. After graduating from North Hollywood High School, he attended college for two years locally, then entered the United States Air Force on March 19, 1964. Over the next 42 years he dedicated himself to serving his country: the first 26 years on active duty and the remainder in the tougher job as a military spouse.\n\nWhile on active duty he served in multiple career fields and locations both domestic and foreign. Moving from enlisted to officer status, his jobs ranged from computer programmer to Combat Crew Commander for Minuteman Missiles, culminating in what he felt was his best job, Commander of a squadron. Throughout his career, he felt his most important task was mentoring young officers and enlisted personnel by teaching them to always do the right thing rather than the easy one, a tenet that he lived every day.\n\nIn 1983, he met Susan (then Captain Wellner); they married in 1986, bringing three wonderful boys into her life. Will was born two years later as the final addition to the family. Together they continued to serve this nation even following Bill’s retirement from active duty in 1990, when Bill happily became Mr. Mom and Chief Cook and Bottlewasher for his family. As the stay-at-home Dad, he was the glue that held the family together and allowed them to soar. After Susan retired in 2006, Bill could justifiably claim 42 years of military service.\n\nBill’s life of service expanded beyond the military and family into doing God’s work within the community. Meals on Wheels, multiple church committees, and church and semi-professional choirs such as the Master Chorale of Tampa Bay all experienced his passion for service to others as well as his humor, voice, and support.\n\nBill was always quick with a smile or a joke to make folks comfortable and bring them into the life that he loved. The things that most filled him with joy included skiing, hunting, fishing, singing, reading, and traveling to visit his friends and family, especially his children and grandchildren.\n\nA Celebration of Life service will be held Sunday, April 24, 2022, 2pm, at Hyde Park United Methodist Church, 500 W Platt Street, Tampa, FL. Family will begin receiving friends one hour prior. A reception will be held on site following the service.\n\nThere will be a Military Honors Service on Monday, April 25, 2022, 2pm at the Florida National Cemetery, 6502 SW 102nd Ave, Bushnell, FL 33513-8914.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions in Bill’s memory may be made to the Master Chorale of Tampa Bay, Hyde Park United Methodist Church, or Metropolitan Ministries.\n\nAudrey Mae Leaber Moyant, 92, Brandon, FL died on a breezy, sunny spring morning, 31 March 2022, at home with family by her side.\n\nAudrey was born December 6, 1929, in Gretna, Louisiana to Louise and Robert Leaber. She was raised in Gretna and met her one true love, Donald Moyant, on one of her many outings to nearby Biloxi, Mississippi. They married just a few months later before moving to New Mexico, then Colorado, Pennsylvania, and eventually settling in Brandon, Florida with their two children, in the early 1970s. They remained together for 45 years until Don’s death April 16, 2000.\n\nAudrey wore several hats. She received her nursing diploma from Charity Hospital of Louisiana and worked as a Registered Nurse She also worked alongside her husband, doing clerical work for their small business. Later in life she became a literacy tutor for exceptional adults, volunteered at a parrot rescue, and was a volunteer ESOL teacher at the San Jose Mission in Dover, FL for many years.\n\nShe enjoyed square dancing and roaming the flea markets with her beloved husband Don. They went on many travels together, including England, Canada, Bimini, Côte d’Ivoire, national parks, and even a special trip to Alaska funded by a lucky lotto ticket, just enough to cover the trip of a lifetime.\n\nAudrey loved nature and animals and was a caretaker to many creatures, from cats and dogs, to ferrets and parrots. She was so determined in her duty and loyalty to her animal companions, that she continued caring for her husband’s bird, an ornery cherry-headed conure named Jake, for more than 20 years after his death. When Jake the parrot died of old age, January 31st of this year, Audrey buried him herself, in her garden. With her children and grandchildren already grown and thriving, perhaps caring for Jake was considered a final job well done, because she followed him two months later to the day.\n\nAnyone who had the pleasure of knowing Audrey, likely had the pleasure of knowing the beautiful garden she was famous for (truly famous…it even made it into the local paper!). If she went missing, one only had to take a stroll outside and carefully search between the ferns, underneath the Azalea bushes, or beyond the billowing Peace Lilies, to find her on her stool with a bucketful of weeds at her side. Those graced with a tour of that garden, walked away in awe of the splendor that just one woman, partnered only by God, could create. She tended to every leaf, flower, butterfly (and those darn weeds) in the garden she loved, with the same care she gave to the people she loved.\n\nAudrey will be remembered as a kind, giving, no-nonsense mother, grandmother, and great grandmother. She is survived by her two children, Bruce Moyant (Josephine) and Donna Neilson (John), her grandchildren, Laura Moyant, Amy Neilson, Alexander Neilson, Eulalie Kouassi (Hervé), and Cesar Tre (Mimose), and great grandchildren Lauren, Dylan, Paul André, and Vincent. She is preceded in death by her parents, her husband Donald, sister Bobbie, and brother David.\n\n“If ever there were a spring day so perfect,\n\nSo uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze\n\nthat it made you want to throw\n\nopen all the windows in the house\n\nand unlatch the door to the canary’s cage,\n\nindeed, rip the little door from its jamb,\n\na day when the cool brick paths\n\nand the garden bursting with peonies\n\nseemed so etched in sunlight…\n\n…well, today is just that kind of day”.\n\n- Excerpt from ‘Today’, by Billy Collins\n\nIN MEMORY OF\n\nSYLVIA JEAN GRAHAM GARDNER\n\nDATE OF BIRTH\n\nSEPTEMBER 30, 1940\n\nDATE OF DEATH\n\nMARCH 30, 2022\n\nAGE AT DEATH\n\n81 YEARS 6 MONTHS 30 DAYS\n\nCLERGY IN SYLVIA’S CARE\n\nFATHER LAVERNE FREEMAN\n\nCHAPLAIN REY ACEVEDO\n\nPLACE OF INTERNMENT\n\nCHRISTIAN MEMORIAL\n\nROCHESTER HILLS, MICHIGAN\n\nSylvia Jean (Graham) Gardner was born to Juanita Alberta (Barker) Graham and Oscar Ezra Graham in Amherstdale, West Virginia on September 30, 1940. Sylvia married her husband Clifton “Bud” Floyd Gardner, who predeceased her in 1995. She leaves behind their three children: Cheryl Lynn Klemanski of Valrico, FL, Scott Floyd Gardner of Warren, MI and Suzanne (Craig) Caldwell of Wilmington, NC as well as eight grandchildren, Kandice M. Caldwell, Hunter S. Caldwell, McKennzie S. Caldwell, Perry G. Klemanski, Paul D. (Megan) Klemanski, Aaron M. Klemanski, Lisa B. Klemanski and Corinne B. (Adam) Dropiewski; three great-grandsons, Konnor Caldwell, Jaxon Klemanski and Benson Klemanski as well as many nieces and nephews. She was the oldest of four siblings and leaves behind her sisters Mary F. (William, deceased) Unik of Milton WV, Sharon S. (James) Chapman of Kewanna IN and her brother Oscar E. (Faye) Graham Jr. of Bruceton TN.\n\nSylvia graduated from Man High School in 1958, she lived in Portsmouth OH for a short while before moving to Detroit, MI where she worked as a cashier at the family theatre in Downtown Detroit and later worked at the Mt. Clemens Drive-In. She met Bud soon after arriving to Detroit and was a devoted wife for 33 years before he passed in 1995. Sylvia had a strong faith in God and became a member of the Spring Lake United Methodist Church in Sebring, FL in March of 1998 and enjoyed attending with her aunt and taking many trips with the Church.\n\nSylvia enjoyed doing many different things like volunteering in the grade schools, gardening and canning, ceramics, painting, sewing, quilting and crocheting. For many years she crocheted afghans and hats for cancer patients receiving chemo treatments at Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, MI. Sylvia was an avid reader, thoroughly enjoyed genealogy and loved learning new things. She loved eclectic music and took pride in her collections. She truly enjoyed being a grandmother and made quilts for each of her grandchildren. She made a quilt for the grade school auction to help raise money for the PTO; a family from Germany won the bid and was so impressed with the amount of detail she put into the quilt that they insisted on coming to her house to meet her in person. They told her it would be going back to Germany with them and that they were not sure if they were going to display it or use it but that they would take very good care of it. She of course insisted that they use it! She loved being surrounded by the numerous pets in the house and even though she’d rather cuddle up with one of the cats, the family Parrot, Ziggy, had a special love for her and would immediately beeline to her when he came out of his cage. She loved all of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren more than anything else. Her eyes would light up when she saw them or heard from them or read something about them or saw a new picture of them. They brought her so much happiness even when they were not around; they truly meant the world to her.\n\nShe always had a smile on her face and was hilarious sometimes especially while watching her favorite sport teams and making commentaries. She made everyone she met feel like family. She was a peaceful person to be around, had a simplistic manner to this existence and treated everyone with kindness and respect. She touched the hearts of everyone she met and a part of her will live on through us as we remember her and her beautiful ways.\n\nSylvia held a particular Poem close to her heart for many years and she wanted it shared upon her passing. Enjoy.\n\nDear Beautiful Wife, Mother, Grandmother, Great-Grandmother, Aunt, Sister and Friend:\n\nYou will be missed dearly but never forgotten.

He lived in many US states and 2 Canadian provinces, and most recently he lived with his wife and mother-in-law in Riverview Florida. He is survived by his wife Sarah Graven, his two sons Maxwell and Ian Graven, and two kitties Doodle and Boo.\n\nMichael Graven was an amazing, loving, selfless man who put the needs of others before his own at every turn. The work he did allowed him to save hundreds of thousands of lives by building health information systems in developing countries and he did it all voluntarily.\n\nMichael had anything but a simple life, from being a professional fisherman to a neonatologist. He was extremely well traveled, and a master linguist. Of the places he traveled, Norway was his absolute favorite place.\n\nHe had many things that he enjoyed in his spare time. He was a lover of history, food, video games, music and movies. When he found something that he liked, he would watch it or read it over and over. After he discovered The Mitchells vs. the Machines, he watched it over 20 times.\n\nIan’s favorite memory of him is when Michael and Ian went on a week-long canoe trip with Boy Scouts and their fathers in the boundary waters of Minnesota. Michael would re-tell the story, over and over, of how Ian and he worked the hardest and carried the most packs over the portages. They shared summer sausage on the harder portages, and summer sausage still reminds Ian of the trip.\n\nMax loved hearing Michael tell stories. Of the stories he would tell, this was Max’s favorite. When Max was just two and a half years old, on a hike in Alaska, he wandered off briefly and fell into a cold river. Not only was the river freezing cold, but it had a steep waterfall not far down stream. Michael thinking fast, jumped into the river, fished him out with one hand, and carried him to safety. Max was so cold his lips were blue, but he was otherwise unharmed, all due to Michael’s quick thinking and decisive action.\n\nSarah’s favorite story.\n\n“It’s hard to pick one moment in 35 years of marriage. My favorite memory is how he proposed.\n\nWe met when I lived in West Palm. My best friend there was Joy Small. Michael called her, found out my ring size and told her his plans for our engagement. She was so happy to be involved. She helped me pack my suitcase. Joy told me I needed to pack for warm weather and freezing cold weather, to bring a bathing suit and snow boots. I was going fly to Tampa around March 27. I didn't know where I was going but she did. I flew to Tampa not knowing where I was going to end up and Mike met me at the airport. Back then in 1988 we didn't have much security so you could just run and catch your plane at the last minute. So, we got in the air, and we landed in Denver Co.\n\nWhen we got off the plane, we were met by one of his best friends from college, Dave and Laurel Krueger who was married and had two young girls Hilary and Jenny. They were all very excited, Laurel and two little girls all giggly and I thought this was a very interesting trip. They took us to a hotel, and I remember having a picnic in the rooms of this hotel with the sweet family that had brought dinner. The next day we went swimming in Hot Springs where there was snow all around the spring. It looked like it was this big man-made swimming area and some of it was natural. It was so odd to go from the heat of Florida to the freezing cold of Colorado. We just had the best time.\n\nThe next day we drove over to mount Aspen. Dave and Laurel and the two girls went somewhere, I suppose they were preparing for our return. Mike and I went up on the mountain on a gondola. There was still snow on the mountain; there were people still skiing and it was beautiful and sunny and perfect. We got to the top of the mountain, and we started walking around. He told me he had a question and then, as I was trying to figure out if this is what I think it is, he went to kneel and he sunk down into the snow, and he proposed. He had the ring that his brother Doug had helped him pick out, and Joy helped get my ring size. The ring was beautiful and sparkly in the snow. I said yes of course and then we went to the little restaurant on the top of the mountain, and we had like a little celebratory cup of coffee and hot chocolate. I have a photo of that somewhere. So, we take the gondola down the mountain and there's David, Laurel and their little girls at the bottom of the mountain with a homemade sign that says congratulations with little children’s handprints and their contributions on it. They were so excited, and we had another picnic in the cold, in a parking lot. It was just so fun. We were dressed for it so it wasn't bad, but I had to jump up and down to keep warm 'cause I’m a Florida girl.\n\nWhen he would tell the story he would say “I had to take her to the top of a mountain to propose so she would have hypoxia and say yes because she couldn't think straight.” He knew I loved him, and he knew I'd say yes. It was just perfect.”\n\nPLU biography of Michael: https://www.plu.edu/resolute/fall-2017/michael-graven-81/\n\n“His life journey blazed a trail which touched so many people, saved so many lives, that he will never be forgotten.” - Vanessa Roman.\n\n“He was a wonderful man with a genuine and luminous soul.” - Robert F.
