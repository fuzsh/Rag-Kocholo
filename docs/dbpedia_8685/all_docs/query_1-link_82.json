        "text": "All we want as actors is to have great roles. [laughs]\n\nI have not had a career\n\nwhere all the great parts have come onto my desk.\n\nI just have not had the luxury of just sitting around\n\nand having people pour great scripts my way.\n\nI think of my career as challenging\n\nand working at it, making things happen.\n\nI'm Glenn Close, and this is the timeline of my career.\n\nIs it all right?\n\nIt's not in it.\n\nIt's a she, and she's all right.\n\nI was starring in Barnum on Broadway,\n\nand George Roy Hill and Marion Dougherty\n\nwho really, she pioneered the role of casting director,\n\nand George said later that she knew\n\nwhat he wanted more than he did.\n\nThey sat and watched me in Barnum,\n\nand I was asked to come in and audition for Jenny Fields.\n\nBut he can't feel life.\n\nSo he takes off the gloves and he dies,\n\nbut he finally feels life\n\nas he's flying into the arms of death.\n\nI like that.\n\nIf that's what it means, I like it.\n\nAnd the memo that went out\n\nto all the agents was a young Katherine Hepburn,\n\nso I gave probably the worst audition of my life.\n\nI was not good at auditioning,\n\nbut George told me later\n\nthat it was probably the worst audition he'd ever seen\n\nbecause I was kind of trying to talk like Katherine Hepburn.\n\nBut somehow I got the role of Jenny Fields.\n\nWhen I got my first Oscar nomination,\n\nit was totally out of my even realm of possibility.\n\nI was in the cellar of Tidalholm\n\nwhere we were shooting The Big Chill\n\nand I heard that I had gotten nominated,\n\nand it was like, what?\n\nIt just was something I never dreamed of.\n\nI had never even thought of.\n\n[baby hiccups]\n\nShe's got the hiccups.\n\nHe should be here.\n\nI feel like we should have had a chair for Alex.\n\nOf course we don't have enough food, but.\n\nI was asked to do a reading by Larry Casden\n\nI remember going up to Larry saying,\n\nI bet you want me to play Sarah Cooper,\n\nbecause I wanted to play the part\n\nthat Mary Kay Place ended up playing.\n\nI thought that was a much kind of juicier part.\n\nThe entire cast got together on the lot of Columbia.\n\nI think it was a month before we went down to Atlanta\n\nwhere we shot the epilogue,\n\nwhich does not appear in the movie.\n\nAnd we lived in these,\n\nwe each had apartments out Inland Waterway or you know,\n\nsomewhere down in South Carolina.\n\nI'm an introvert.\n\nAnd I would,\n\nI was reading my book in my apartment,\n\nand Mary Kay knocked on the door and said,\n\nKevin and Jeff Goldman and Jo Beth, and I were,\n\nwe're all gonna meet and have dinner and play games.\n\nI said, Oh God, I'm not, I'm sorry, I can't go.\n\nAnd she literally physically pulled me up,\n\npulled me in, and that was the beginning\n\nof our hardcore group that ate dinner together,\n\ndanced, played trivial pursuit,\n\nplayed jokes on each other, dressed up for Halloween.\n\nYou know, that was the beginning of that.\n\nI love you all so much.\n\nI know that sounds gross, doesn't it?\n\nThe life we learn with,\n\nand the life we live with after that,\n\nwith or without the records.\n\nThe Natural came my way because of Robert Redford.\n\nI was cast in a Merchant Ivory film,\n\nand it was my first real leading role part.\n\nRobert Redford, I met him at his office in New York,\n\nand he said, I want you in this movie,\n\nand we can work it out that you can do both.\n\nWell, it didn't work out that we did both.\n\nAnd the other production got fed up, and I lost that role,\n\nbut I ended up playing Iris,\n\nwhich I'm very happy for because I love that movie.\n\nAnd I loved working with Bob Redford,\n\nand that started a lifelong friendship.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nYou won't answer my calls.\n\nYou changed your number.\n\nI mean, I'm not going to be ignored, Dan.\n\nI never in a million years would call\n\nAlex Forrest a villain.\n\nAnd I've talked a lot about it\n\nbecause people didn't know her backstory.\n\nThey didn't know the why of her behavior.\n\nBut after conferring with psychiatrists,\n\nI was playing a woman who had been incested\n\nby her father at a very, very early age,\n\nand for long enough to really traumatize her.\n\nWhen you do the research,\n\npeople who have gone through situations like that are\n\nincapable of kind of normal human relationships.\n\nThere is like the Madonna whores,\n\nyou're made into a sex object\n\nbefore you even know what sex is,\n\nthen you're made to feel shameful about it.\n\nYou hate yourself.\n\nA sizeable percentage\n\nof people sadly can take their life by suicide.\n\nThe original ending was that she actually did that.\n\nAnd I felt that that was how that character would end,\n\nbut famously they tested the movie,\n\nand six months afterwards came back to me and said,\n\nWe're changing the ending,\n\nwhich was a real shock\n\nbecause I felt I was betraying the character\n\nthat I believed in.\n\nEnded up doing it, not happily.\n\nWhat I learned from that is how important catharsis is\n\nfor the audience to feel like some sort of sense\n\nof order will be restored.\n\nI mean, and that's classic.\n\nIt was a hard journey.\n\nIt was a hard lesson to learn,\n\nbut it's something I've never forgotten.\n\nI still think it would be fascinating\n\nto tell the exactly the same story from her point of view.\n\nShe would not end up a villain.\n\nYou don't get it.\n\nYou just, you don't get it.\n\nI had no choice, did I?\n\nI'm a woman.\n\nWomen are obliged to be far more skillful than men.\n\nYou can ruin our reputation\n\nand our life with a few well-chosen words.\n\nI remember hearing\n\nthat nobody's gonna go watch a costume drama.\n\nWe proved them wrong.\n\nThat was fun.\n\nI had just given birth to Annie seven weeks\n\nbefore I flew over to France,\n\nso I still had my mommy body\n\nthat had to be absolutely crammed into a corset,\n\nand at the end of the day, I had these,\n\nthese welts on my waist where the two kind\n\nof came together and rubbed.\n\nSo, and that's why I have those wonderfully full bosom\n\nbecause I had just weaned her.\n\nAt first, I thought, well,\n\nmaybe I could still nurse her during the filming,\n\nbut to get out of those costumes and nurse\n\nand get back into the costumes would have,\n\nit would have been at least an hour and a half.\n\nJames Acheson designed those magnificent costumes\n\nin Dangerous Liaisons.\n\nThe Stephen Frears, fantastic director.\n\nHe did come closer and closer in\n\non faces as the movie evolved,\n\nwhich to poor James Acheson would be pulling his hair\n\nbecause he wanted his costumes to show a lot.\n\nAnd I remember there's a scene of me sitting\n\nat my dressing table and he said,\n\nShow the shoe, show a shoe.\n\nAnd so I'm sitting in kind of a weird position,\n\nand you can see the shoe on my foot. [laughs]\n\nSo of course I had to invent not only myself.\n\nHave you ever engaged in immoral conduct?\n\nWhat do you mean by immoral?\n\nAs defined by the department of defense,\n\nalcohol abuse, drug abuse, homosexuality, adultery,\n\nsexual acts with a minor.\n\nI'm a lesbian.\n\nYeah, I'm always seduced by a story.\n\nIt also was the first time,\n\nwell, no, the second time, actually,\n\nwhen I said, I wonder if this is going to affect my career,\n\nwhether people will have negative reactions\n\nif I play a lesbian.\n\nWhenever I've confronted with that question,\n\nmy next question to myself is, well,\n\nwhat's the alternative, not to do it?\n\nBecause you're afraid?\n\nNo.\n\nWhy did you disclose your sexual orientation\n\nto the DIS agent?\n\nBecause he asked, and it was the truth,\n\nand I was being honest.\n\nDoing that movie at a time when it was\n\ndon't ask, don't tell, both Gretta Cammermeyer and myself,\n\nwe got these letters from women who said,\n\nI was thinking of killing myself.\n\nI can't tell you what it meant to see a hero\n\nthat's like me.\n\nIt had a profound effect on the LGBTQ world,\n\nand I'm very proud of that effect.\n\nAnd when Obama did away with a don't ask, don't tell,\n\nGretta was right there behind his desk.\n\nAnita, darling.\n\nGood morning, Cruella.\n\nWell, I had grown up\n\nwith the great Disney animated features,\n\nSnow White, Cinderella, Bambi.\n\nI was very aware of the value of witches in fairytales.\n\nAs a young child, I loved fairytales.\n\nAnd to be asked to be a Disney witch,\n\nwhich is what Cruella is, was thrilling to me.\n\nSo I had a wonderful vocal coach for Cruella,\n\nand I loved the Joanna Lumley's accent\n\nin Absolutely Fabulous,\n\nAnd my coach, Joan Washington, knows her,\n\nand she had this very clipped way of talking.\n\nAlso I emulated Trevor Nunn\n\nwho had directed me in Sunset Boulevard,\n\nand he has this way of, ta, ta,\n\nhe makes things, take it or leave it,\n\nand he doesn't talk like that all the time\n\nor else he'd kill me,\n\nbut just really strong consonance\n\nand clipped very much in power.\n\nAlonzo, did you ask Anita if she'd like something to drink?\n\nCollege kids know me as Cruella\n\nbecause my costume collection is at Indiana University,\n\nwhich is fantastic.\n\nI was there at one point,\n\nand we had a showing of,\n\nit was Fatal Attraction actually,\n\nbut it's the first time that these kids had seen that movie,\n\nand they were just as stunned as people had been all along,\n\nbut they do know me as Cruella,\n\nand the younger ones know me as Nova Prime\n\nin the Guardians of the Galaxy,\n\nso my entire career, it's just those two parts.\n\nWhat a charming dog.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhy don't you just leave the Roosevelt room\n\nthe way the Roosevelt's and wanted it>\n\n[laughs] Because Eleanor Roosevelt was too fond of chince.\n\nGod, I loved doing Mars Attacks.\n\nIt was so much fun to be in the room\n\nwith all those other incredible actors,\n\nJack Nicholson for my husband.\n\nI had a Pat Nixon wig,\n\nthat was pretty funny.\n\nAnd to be killed by the Nancy Reagan chandelier,\n\nI mean the whole thing was just delicious,\n\nbut we had a perfect replica of the oval office,\n\nand whenever Jack Nicholson would come on stage,\n\nthey played [sings Hail to the Chief]\n\nSo there's a great sense of fun,\n\nbut also a great sense of professionalism.\n\nMadam vice president, this way we'll avoid the press.\n\nIs the president secure.\n\nNot yet, the recovery team will have him very soon.\n\nOne thing I remember was\n\nthey had a scene around that table\n\nwhere she broke down crying,\n\nand I said, I will not do that.\n\nI don't think that would happen.\n\nNot my vice president.\n\nMy vice president would not break down into tears.\n\nShe would step up to the challenge.\n\nSo they changed it.\n\nI love playing that part, again,\n\nsurrounded by a great ensemble of actors.\n\nI think I was kind of a late casting\n\n'cause I remember my hair was actually one of my wigs\n\nthat I'd used in something else,\n\nand it was redone by my brilliant wig maker/ hairdresser\n\nat the time Martial Corneville\n\nwho just did me and in Hillbilly Elegy,\n\none of the great masters of the craft of wig making\n\nand did all of Cruella's hairstyles, for example,\n\nhe should have won an Oscar for that.\n\nI think directors are just showing off\n\nwhen they try to film a sex scene.\n\nI don't think they're really trying to show us sex,\n\nI think they're just trying to show us\n\nthey're not afraid to show a sex.\n\nI mean, it's like they're all\n\nthumbing their noses at their mothers.\n\nWell, I had known Christopher Reeves\n\nsince he and Robin, they were best friends.\n\nAnd when we were shooting my first movie, Garp,\n\nChristopher would fly in in his little plane\n\n'cause he was a pilot, pick up Robin,\n\nthey were bad boys at the time,\n\nand they would fly off somewhere for the weekend.\n\nThey'd fly back,\n\nhe would kind of dump Robin out. [laughs]\n\nI loved him.\n\nHe would have been one of our top directors had he lived,\n\nhe was astounding.\n\nIt was a difficult piece,\n\nit was quite a literary piece, and he made it human.\n\nHe made it actable.\n\nThe dialogue was wonderful,\n\nand to see him behind that monitor\n\nin that chair doing such wonderful work,\n\nI'm blessed that I experienced that.\n\nYou know, I speak a little French Mr. Coupet,\n\nand just because that little outburst wasn't in English,\n\ndoesn't mean it's not gonna be on the record.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nTell me what, what did you say?\n\nHe called me a manipulative bitch.\n\nYou got that?\n\nI had done one season on The Shield,\n\nand it actually was John Landgraf who convinced me\n\nbecause he was all about the writing and the artists.\n\nAnd he still is that way.\n\nI mean, he's remarkable.\n\nSo I did The Shield and that kind\n\nof was my first real toe in the water with series.\n\nSo I said basically at the end,\n\nif you ever have an idea for me,\n\ncome to me as long as it's in New York,\n\nbecause that's where my life was at the time.\n\nThey came back and had one of the most brilliant pieces\n\nof writing I've ever read, which was the first pilot.\n\nI remember I gave it to my great friend, Ann Roth,\n\nwho was designed costumes for me my whole career,\n\nand she also is a very smart woman with a great sense\n\nof story and everything.\n\nAnd I asked her to read it and she came back and said,\n\nyou would be crazy not to do this.\n\nI did it.\n\nAnd I signed my life away\n\nfor a possible six years, ended up doing it for five.\n\nThe writers never, ever, ever let me down.\n\nThe key to that character kind of came to me in a scene.\n\nIt was a scene with Rose,\n\nand I realized that her power came\n\nwith keeping people off balance.\n\nThe only time that she ever showed\n\nher true feelings was in private.\n\nNever would she let her power go by being emotional,\n\nunless it was calculated.\n\nPlease, may we go off the record.\n\nCertainly.\n\nHe is slaughtering children, families.\n\nThat is your business.\n\nNow I have other matters to attend to.\n\nPrick.\n\nI've always wanted to be in a superhero movie,\n\nand I'd love to be in another one.\n\nI just love that whole thing.\n\nIt's like going back to when I was six years old,\n\nbecause half of it,\n\nyou have to act in your imagination.\n\nIn the set, they had this big round thing\n\nthat had this, you could see the hologram\n\nof the battle, but of course it wasn't there.\n\nAnd they have some,\n\nsome guy with a pole with a tennis ball on it\n\nthat's like a space ship,\n\nand I remember standing around there and thinking, yeah,\n\nI can do this.\n\nI used to do when I was little.\n\nI could imagine that there's a war going on\n\nin front of me three feet away.\n\nI love that stuff.\n\nAnybody out there.\n\nWhat's your name.\n\nAlbert.\n\nYour real name.\n\nAlbert.\n\nIt took me 14 years to get that film shot.\n\nI got the rights to the material,\n\nand then I'd get a job, then I'd come back\n\nthen I had to at one point change directors,\n\nand when we finally ended up doing it,\n\nit was with the right people, the right cast.\n\nIt was just the most wonderful experience\n\nbecause I've always been very attracted to characters\n\nwho don't have any self-pity,\n\nand yet they don't know that their dream is impossible,\n\nbut we do.\n\nAnd it makes them incredibly compelling.\n\nI loved Albert for her innocent belief.\n\nI played her as a woman who didn't know what she was.\n\nShe had never been touched with love.\n\nShe had never had a partner of any kind.\n\nShe was existing as in disguise, in order to survive.\n\nIt's a story of someone\n\nwho had to become invisible in order to survive.\n\nAnd I think there are so many people\n\nin the world who have had to face that.\n\nI don't want it, it's yours.\n\nIt's all yours, it has your fucking name on it.\n\nFucking take it.\n\nI don't want it.\n\nI don't want it.\n\nWe came to a point where I was told\n\nthat Bjorn Runge was going to come to New York,\n\nand we were going to have breakfast together.\n\nAnd it was up to me whether he would be the director.\n\nDuring the course of that meal,\n\nI got a sense that he would be a wonderful man to work with.\n\nYou know, you just, I had nothing to go on,\n\nexcept she's done theater.\n\nHe's written, he's done movies.\n\nI said, you know, I think let's do this movie together.\n\nAnd he's one of the best directors I've ever worked with.\n\nAnd because he trusted the actor's face.\n\nHe trusted the closeup.\n\nHe used the closeup very judiciously\n\nto keep the audience emotionally connected\n\nto my character.\n\nIf a director sets up a feeling of trust, then you can,\n\nyou're absolutely free to do your best work.\n\nAnd we had that atmosphere of trust.\n\nAnd with Jonathan,\n\nI mean the first scene we shot was the scene in bed,\n\nso, oh, hello, I'm Glenn, I'm Jonathan,\n\nokay, let's jump into bed. [laughs]\n\nWhy can't we let clean her own mess up for once?\n\nBecause family's the only thing that means a God damn.\n\nI read the book basically when it came out and I loved it.\n\nAnd then I think it was a couple of years later,\n\nI heard that Ron had gotten the rights\n\nand was developing a script.\n\nI've always been very proactive about things.\n\nI wrote him a note.\n\nI wrote him a letter, and we had done The Paper\n\na number of years ago.\n\nAnd I just wrote him, I said,\n\nwhenever you are casting, I hope you will think of me,\n\nthinking no one will ever cast me as Mamaw.\n\nAnd lo and behold, he offered it to me.\n\nWe had time as a company to get together,\n\nto go to Middletown, Ohio,\n\nto meet the members of the family,\n\nof JD's family who were there,\n\nwho had amazing courage to let these strangers come in,\n\nknowing that they were going to portray themselves\n\nand members of their family,\n\nthat we, each of us,\n\neach of us as individuals got time\n\nto talk to each member of the family.\n\nAnd we each had our own kind of questions to ask.\n\nAnd my questions were, how did she sit?\n\nHow did she walk?\n\nWhat did she do with her hands?\n\nHow did she hold her cigarette?\n\nWhat did her voice sound like?\n\nSo you can do justice to who they were.\n\nThere's nothing better than having a wonderful story\n\nand having a company that's like\n\nthis great chemical creature,\n\nthat everybody's contribution counts.\n\nAnd Ron Howard puts together those kinds of teams\n\nwhere you're free to do your best work\n\nbecause everyone is doing their best work.\n\nWhat I've learned, you own your choices.\n\nYou don't know at the moment\n\nwhy you are particularly attracted to that story,\n\nbut you are,\n\nand you think it's good because you think it's good.\n\nNot because somebody tells you\n\nthat you're gonna make a lot of money\n\nor you're gonna get an award.\n\nYou think it's good.\n\nYou have to stay subjective to your own spirit.\n\nI tried to do that.\n\nAnd at this point, if I wasn't owning my career,\n\nI might as well do something else."
