        "text": "American actress\n\nEileen Dietz is an American actress who is best known for her appearances in many horror films such as the face of the demon in The Exorcist and for her portrayal of characters on the soap operas Guiding Light and General Hospital.\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a child, Dietz appeared in commercials with her twin sister Marianne DeFossey, and beginning at the age of 12 she started studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She made her television debut in 1963 in a small guest role on The Doctors. Shortly thereafter she landed a recurring role on the soap opera Love of Life. She made her film debut starring in the 1966 movie Teenage Gang Debs as Ellie. The following year she portrayed Penny Wohl in the critically acclaimed independent film David Holzman's Diary. The film never got much in the way of theatrical distribution despite having Dietz's nude scene featured in Life Magazine's photo spread and in the book of the film. She did not recall if she auditioned for the role of Penny but she added, \"it was a fun shoot.\"[1]\n\nDietz spent much of the late 1960s and early 1970s appearing in theatre productions. She notably appeared Off-Broadway as the Young Girl in the premiere of Bruce Jay Friedman's Steambath at the Truck and Warehouse Theater in 1970. In 1972, she portrayed an androgynous runaway in the premiere of Joyce Carol Oates' Ontological Proof of My Existence. Her portrayal in the play led to an invitation to do a screen test for The Exorcist. She was cast in two memorable roles in the film: Pazuzu the demon (better known as the face of death), and the 'possessed Regan' (the Linda Blair character) in some scenes. She performed in scenes that were too violent or disturbing for Blair to perform, including the crucifix scene and the fistfight with Father Karras.[2] [3] She recalled that director William Friedkin gave her no notes and said, \"I wasn't playing a little girl, I was playing the demon that possessed a little girl.\" Blair, who recalls Friedkin telling her the film would not succeed if she was not in as many shots as possible, estimates that Dietz is in 17 seconds of the film. Dietz, angry that her contribution to the film had been minimized, claimed in the media to have performed all the possession scenes. Warners ultimately measured her screen presence at 28.25 seconds, but denied that her contribution was dramatically significant.[4]: 75\n\nAfter The Exorcist, Dietz had a highly active career on television during the 1970s, appearing as a guest star on such shows as Planet of the Apes, Korg: 70,000 B.C., Barnaby Jones, and Happy Days among others. She also portrayed the recurring role of Linette Waterman in the soap opera The Guiding Light and appeared in the films You Light Up My Life (1977) and Parts: The Clonus Horror (1979).\n\nIn 1980, Dietz joined the cast of General Hospital as Sarah Abbott, a role she played for several years. She also appeared as a guest star on Trapper John, M.D. (1982) and in the horror film Freeway Maniac (1989). More recent film credits include Naked in the Cold Sun (1997), Hurricane Festival (1997), Bad Guys (2000), Exorcism (2003), The Mojo Cafe (2004), Neighborhood Watch (2005), Constantine (2005), Karla (2006), Creepshow III (2006), Dog Lover's Symphony (2006), and Tracing Cowboys (2008).\n\nDietz appeared as Winnie Gilmore in Halloween II (2009) in an uncredited role.\n\nDietz was cast in the thriller Eden Falls, co-written by Victor Miller, creator of Friday the 13th, and then slated for a 2017 release.[citation needed] However, as of August 2020 , the project was still in development.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDietz has been married to Thomas Albany since March 1984.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1966 Teenage Gang Debs Ellie Credited as Eileen Scott 1967 David Holzman's Diary Penny Wohl The Game People Play Credited as Eileen Scott 1973 The Exorcist Pazuzu's face Uncredited 1974 Road Movie 1977 You Light Up My Life Bridesmaid 1979 Parts: The Clonus Horror Dana 1989 Freeway Maniac Costume Girl 1997 Naked in the Cold Sun Sadie Hurricane Festival Junkie 2000 Bad Guys Bank Teller Left-Overs\n\n—\n\nSet director 2003 Exorcism Evil Nurse 2004 The Mojo Cafe Oscar Short film 2005 Constantine Zombie Uncredited Neighborhood Watch Mrs. Crews 2006 Karla Helen Uncredited Creepshow III Claire The Homeless Woman Segment: Call Girl\n\ndirect-to-video Dog Lover's Symphony Frightened Mother 2008 Tracing Cowboys Marilyn She Turns Back and Faces Forward at Peace Judy Short film 2009 Sibling Rivalry Mrs. Peters The Queen of Screams Eleanor Maxwell Void Helen Short film Halloween II Winnie Gilmore Uncredited 2010 Kadís Librarian Short film Freeway Killer Alice Bonin Benton Hookers for Jesus Blanch Short film Monsterpiece Theatre Volume 1 Nina Segment: Rottentail Butterfly Joy Greenstahl also associate producer The Custom Mary Mother post-production See How They Run Grace post-production The Legend of the Mountain Witch Creepy Lady post-production Scream Queen Campfire Ethel Segment: Motherly Love Hallow Pointe Fran 2011 Little Big Boy Jimmy's Mother - middle aged Dead Girls Don't Cry Diane Thomas filming Stingy Jack Esther Flower pre-production 2012 Witches Playground filming 2015 Fire Twister Sadie - The Mountain Woman Television film 2017 Eden Falls Barbara pre-production 2019 Itsy Bitsy Sally Post-production 2019 For We Are Many Mrs. Vasile Segment: The Damned Statue 2019 The Assent Rhonda 2020 The Amityville Harvest Mrs. O'Brian 2022 Staycation Griselda E.
