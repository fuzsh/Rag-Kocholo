        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.\n\n+ means discounted tickets were at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.\n\n++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.\n\n+++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for performances last Saturday night only.\n\nBroadway\n\n+++ ''BETRAYAL.'' A stylish but seriously unbalanced revival of Harold Pinter's 1972 study of marital infidelity, told in reverse chronological order. Seemingly the most accessible of this playwright's major works, the drama invests a familiar formula with a gnawing, transforming sense of how opaque people remain to one another. The ravishing but miscast Juliette Binoche plays a woman having an affair with the best friend (Liev Schreiber) of her husband (John Slattery). An ideal ''Betrayal'' offers an equilateral triangle, in which the roles of manipulator and manipulated keep shifting. Here, under David Leveaux's elegant and chilly direction, Ms. Binoche and Mr. Slattery don't always strike the ideal balance between baffling and being baffled. Mr. Schreiber, on the other hand, is superb, turning thinking into a spectator sport and making sure those Pinteresque silences never feel empty. You leave believing you have watched his entire performance in close-up (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65 (Ben Brantley).\n\n*+ ''COPENHAGEN.'' Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $70; $30 stage tickets; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).\n\n+ ''THE DINNER PARTY.'' Neil Simon, in an experimental mood, has come up with one of the more bizarre mutants in theater history. This strained comedy about a gathering of mysteriously interconnected Parisians in an opulent restaurant is a French farce with a Brooklyn accent, a Strindbergian sexual slugfest with a laugh track. Directed by John Rando with lots of verve and little subtlety, the play features plenty of those familiar Simon one-liners, which keep going off at the oddest moments like tardy kernels of popcorn. The prevailing mood, however, is rueful as the play considers the casualties of the sex wars. The results are as ungainly as the runners in a three-legged race. The creditable cast features Henry Winkler, John Ritter and, most notably, Jan Maxwell, who provides something otherwise utterly lacking here: emotional verisimilitude (1:40). Music Box, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $70 (Brantley).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
