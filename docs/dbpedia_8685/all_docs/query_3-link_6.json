        "text": "Pazuzu is believed to have gone through at least two major mythological changes. Aside from being a bird and a demon-god, though, it's also possible that he made an appearance in the biblical Old Testament. King Solomon faced a wind demon while attempting to build the Temple Of Jerusalem. After capturing this pesky spirit, Solomon learns that its name is Ephippas.\n\nAccording to the Old Testament, Ephippas damaged the land and killed people daily with his fierce winds. This has some similarities to the legend of Pazuzu, a demon that controlled the wind and could cause massive amounts of death and devastation."
