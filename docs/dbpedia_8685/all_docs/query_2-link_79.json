        "text": "After the runaway success of Rosemary’s Baby, a new age of Devil films was ushered in. The Devil was no longer a faraway concept in a castle in the Middle Ages; he was next door, or even scarier, in your own home. The horror was right in front of you, and there was nowhere to run. Some of them films were brilliant, tension-packed horror masterpieces like their predecessor. Others… were cheap knock-offs.\n\nMost of the films from this era were set in the present day, but even the ones set in the past featured a more urgent horror. The Blood on Satan’s Claw is a 1971 British horror film that has an interesting premise but isn’t really worth the time. It features a group of (mostly) young people trying to build up a physical body for The Devil in a sort-of Dr. Frankenstein way. It’s inspired by the Manson Family and other murders committed by young people, but the story is pretty thin. Since The Devil hasn’t been “fully built” or whatever, he doesn’t really pose much of a threat. Also, there is a disturbingly long rape scene in this film that adds nothing to the plot and exists only for shock and exploitation, and the director himself went on to regret it. The Blood on Satan’s Claw is one of those films that may benefit from a remake, as there are some interesting ideas, but they’re never really developed.\n\nAlso in 1971, we got The Brotherhood of Satan, a low budget horror film that I think sums up the obvious Rosemary’s Baby knock-offs better than any other. Hey, Rosemary’s Baby had a cult of elderly folks, let’s have a cult of elderly folks. Hey, Rosemary’s Baby waited a long time before anything truly supernatural happened, let’s wait a long time until anything truly supernatural happens. Hey, Rosemary’s Baby had a bunch of B-movie favorites as members of the cult, let’s… well we can afford Strother Martin.\n\nA lot of great horror films rely on tension, atmosphere, and character drama, not special effects, so I have no problem with low-budget horror. However, The Brotherhood of Satan ends up feeling more like Manos: The Hands of Fate than Rosemary’s Baby. A young couple, Ben (Charles Bateman) and Nicky (Ahna Capri), leave a birthday party for Ben’s daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl) when it starts to rain. There’s a really cheap fake-out scare when something red falls on Ben and Nicky, but it’s turns out to just be his daughter’s sno-cone. Then they drive for, I cannot make this up, three minutes with no dialogue.\n\nIt’s just driving through the southwest, with a few shots of scenery and a soundtrack that gets bored with itself more than once, for three minutes. The entire set-up of this scene is for them to discover the remains of an accident. You could have done that in about 15 seconds! Why is there no dialogue in the car? Could they not dub in post? There are a few times it looks like Ben is going to speak but he doesn’t! I’m all for a slow burn, but this is like if Rosemary’s Baby featured a scene of Guy and Rosemary walking back from the theatre in complete silence before discovering the body outside their apartment.\n\nAnyway, after 3 minutes of driving in silence, Ben finally decides to react in shock when he gets out of the car and discovers there has been an accident. They make their way to the nearest town and report it, but everyone in the town seems to be under some kind of spell. A doctor (Strother Martin) and a sheriff’s deputy (Alvy Moore) discuss an accident where a child went missing, which seems to be a recurring problem for the town. The movie could of course lean into the mystery and let us discover with the characters what exactly is going on, but it opts instead to reveal that the missing children have been kidnapped by a coven of elderly Devil worshippers.\n\nNow, some things are gradually left in the dark for a little while, but while it’s a slow movie, it’s just slow in the wrong ways. It’s not tension-building, just boring.\n\nThe cult is a small group of people who kidnap children and use their bodies to be reborn, so as to obtain eternal life. It’s an interesting enough premise, but the execution is really bizarre. The cult leader is revealed to be Strother Martin’s character, which shouldn’t be a surprise since he’s the top-billed actor, but his dialogue is pretty laughable.\n\nIn an early scene, he’s admonishing a cult-member who has tried to save her son’s soul from Hell and says, “Foul-minded wretch. Think you that he who rules this earth should fail to feel this blow?” I mean, maybe this kind of formal, evil sounding dialogue would sound more natural with a British actor who could really give the impression he’s been around for hundreds of years, but it’s pretty jarring with Martin. The script also seems unable to decide if Martin’s character is Satan or not, as in one scene he’ll act like no one has any authority over him at all, and in another he’ll be offering up (or down?) prayers. It’s like they filmed one version where his character was a Satanist priest, and one where he was just Satan, and then they included scenes from both!\n\nThis movie was clearly a half-baked idea, as there are long scenes that go nowhere, a children’s toy that seems to be controlled by the cult, and a random decapitation with no setup or explanation! Yeah, when a few townsfolk and Ben’s family are trying to figure out what’s going on, a guy dressed as a knight rides by and slices off someone’s head!\n\nI mean, sure, it’s someone protecting the cult, but why this? Did they need just one more scare? Did they really just want to adapt The Legend of Sleepy Hollow? That said, this film can definitely be enjoyed on a so-bad-it’s-good level if you can get past the 3 minute driving scene, because it’s utterly ridiculous. The cult even has a member who I’m pretty sure was the inspiration for Donald Trump’s style (or lack thereof).\n\nThankfully, not every film inspired by the success of Rosemary’s Baby was as bad as The Brotherhood of Satan. In fact, a big-budget horror film about The Devil released in 1973 became an even bigger success than Rosemary’s Baby, going on to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards and receiving the title of the scariest movie of all time from various publications and viewers. (Quick aside: I don’t think any film should be universally acknowledged as the scariest film of all time, because it will only beg people to call it overrated.) That film is of course The Exorcist.\n\nRosemary’s Baby was written by Jewish author Ira Levin, who admitted later in life that he was concerned his novel (and subsequent film adaptation) had only encouraged religious fundamentalists to believe Devil worshippers were an active and serious threat in the world. While I do understand his concern, I think they would have been just as obsessed with the idea whether or not he had written about it (and also, it’s just a fantastic novel and film that it would be sad to not have in the world). I include all of that buildup to say that The Exorcist was written by someone who believed in what he was writing. William Peter Blatty’s novel is about a girl who gets possessed by a literal demon, and the priests who exorcise it from her. Although the film was directed by William Friedkin, who did not hold any religious beliefs, it follows the book pretty closely.\n\nHowever, like Rosemary Baby, The Exorcist plays to natural fears that anyone can associate with. In Rosemary’s Baby, a woman feels ignored and conspired against by society. In The Exorcist, a mother feels like she doesn’t recognize her pre-teen daughter anymore. Whether or not the demon possession stuff works for you, this horror is real and palpable. It takes Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn) a good while to get around to hiring an exorcist, but we sympathize with her because she will try anything to make sure Regan (Linda Blair) is cured.\n\nThe demon that possesses Regan in the book is called Pazuzu, which is objectively a dumb name. Imagine if in The Devil and Daniel Webster, instead of going by Mr. Scratch, Satan went by Barney Q. Flibbett. It takes you out of it entirely. Thankfully, the name Pazuzu is never used in the film version, which leads many to believe that Regan is actually possessed by Satan. The Exorcist was based on a real case of alleged exorcism from the 1940s, and plenty of Catholics were on set to lend it authenticity, including Father William O’Malley who played Father Dyer. It eschews the dark comedy that peppers Rosemary’s Baby and plays the story as a very literal and real struggle between pure good and pure evil without a hint of irony, again due to the fact that its author was a devout Catholic. I think honestly that’s why it became such a runaway success. Sure, it’s a shocking and scary film with all kinds of terror-inducing scenes, but good does defeat evil in the end with no moral ambiguity. Think about where the United States was in 1973—Watergate, exiting Vietnam, all kinds of situations where people felt like things were upside down and morally gray. Here was a story where the villain wasn’t going to offend anyone, because he wasn’t a person, but a demon. The heroes come from all walks of life—priests, an actress, a cop—and they work together to bring down the villain. While this is a pretty black-and-white reading of the film, and I admit I think there is more to it, it is what people were getting from it.\n\n1975 brought us perhaps the most nonsensical Devil film of all time (I’m really going to regret saying this, aren’t I?), The Devil’s Rain. A low-budget confusion-fest which somehow features a very talented cast (and William Shatner), The Devil’s Rain has to be seen to be believed. I can almost guarantee the creators of the film saw The Brotherhood of Satan before making it, because it’s like if that film took every drug known to mankind. At least that film tried to be a serious affair (It failed, but still).\n\nI am going to try my best to summarize the plot of this one, but there isn’t a universally accepted version because it makes no sense. Mark Preston (Shatner) and his family have a book that a Devil-worshipping cult wants possession of, and one night his father comes home with a melting face, telling him to give the cult-leader the book.\n\nMark goes and meets with the cult leader Jonathan Corbin (Ernest Borgnine)… alright stop. How many drugs do you need to be on to cast Ernest Borgnine as a Satanic cult leader? He’s about as threatening as a cheesesteak.\n\nMark challenges Corbin to a battle of faith, I guess. It’s always smart to make a challenge on the opponent’s home turf, especially if the opponent is a Satanic cult leader and you know nothing. Mark puts his soul and the book on the line, as they walk into a church building (or rather, the front of one and that’s all they could afford).\n\nCorbin collects people’s souls in what is called The Devil’s Rain, and puts souls into empty bodies to help them live forever… I think. It really makes no sense, but Corbin wins, because later on we see Shatner having the blackest eyes, The Devil’s eyes. I mean that quite literally, because it was his mask in this movie that became the original Michael Myers mask in Halloween.\n\nSince Mark is missing, his brother Tom (Tom Skerritt) goes looking for him with the help of his wife Julie (Joan Prather) and a fellow doctor (Eddie Albert). Tom and Julie find the church abandoned, and Julie has a flashback to the 17th century (I guess through the magical power of exposition), where she learns that Corbin has been going after the Preston family for generations to get their book. Mark and Julie infiltrate a Satanic service where Ernest Borgnine turns into a goat demon.\n\nThere is no way anyone thought that could be scary. I laughed out loud. Oh and they’re so proud of Ernest Borgnine-goat they use it again later! Are they saying he’s literally The Devil? What’s the point of this?\n\nEddie Albert finds The Devil’s Rain (It’s a physical entity apparently. I give up.) and brings it into a service. He’s unable to destroy it himself, but he gets Shatner to, and then we see every member of the Satanist cult melt in The Devil’s Rain for FIVE. SOLID. MINUTES.\n\nI thought the driving scene in Brotherhood was long. Who wants five minutes of melting? If you’re still watching after this seemingly endless scene finally ends, Tom goes to kiss his wife, but finds out she’s Ernest Borgnine (a relatively common problem, I’m told), and the movie ends. This one isn’t even fun on a dumb level. It’s just bad. I would try to find social commentary or talk about how it was like other Devil films at the time, but it makes no sense.\n\nThankfully, the year after, we got a much better film that would erase the bad taste of Ernest Borgnine in your mouth (Literally in Skerritt’s case). The Omen was not based on any pre-existing novel, and was undeniably made to capitalize on the success of Rosemary’s Baby and The Exorcist. Heck, writer David Seltzer only set the thing in England because he wanted an excuse to travel there. That said, what sounds like it could have been a cheap cash grab turned out to be a thoughtful, tense, and classy horror film. The Omen is the story of Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck), the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom who gradually finds out that his adopted son Damien (Harvey Spencer Stephens) is the Antichrist.\n\nNothing supernatural is confirmed until the very end, and the film does such a great job of suggesting that everything could just be a very unfortunate coincidence. Robert Thorn is a believable lead, as he absolutely willing to look into what he is being told, but he knows it sounds insane. Understandably, he goes over the edge when his wife (Lee Remick) dies in a “freak accident.”\n\nThe Omen is lent a lot from credibility from its star-studded cast, including of course Peck and Remick, but also David Warner who plays reporter Keith Jennings, Billie Whitelaw who plays a creepy nanny, and Patrick Troughton who plays a former Devil worshipping priest. It’s a well-written screenplay, but in the wrong hands, it could have been a forgettable b-movie. It needed actors who took it seriously, which it got, and a director who could build tension beautifully, which it got in Richard Donner. Even though the production process was horrible (and apparently cursed if you believe some on set), everything in the finished product goes right. If I had to recommend a horror movie for someone who didn’t really like horror, I’d probably go with The Omen.\n\nI mentioned in the last part how the idea of fate often hangs heavy over Devil films (particularly the more recent ones), and we get a good dose of this in The Omen. Everything has been pre-ordained, and try as he may, Robert Thorn is unable to stop it. It’s not like Rosemary’s Baby where everyone is against him, because he does team up with Keith Jennings, and they form an intelligent and competent team. They eventually make their way to Israel to meet with Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern), who gives them the Knives of Megiddo, the only weapons that can kill the Antichrist.\n\nThe deaths are a bit over-the-top, but I kind of appreciate the way that fits the theme. When a priest is impaled with a steeple, it’s freaky but it could technically just be a really unfortunate accident. Sure, Jennings’ photos seemed to show that he would die this way, but it’s not definite confirmation. When a truly bizarre chain reaction ends in Jennings’ decapitation right after he picked up the daggers, Thorn has no question as to what’s going on. It still looks like an accident on the surface, but he knows.\n\nAt the end of the film, everything goes as has been foretold, and Robert is killed by police as he raises the knives to kill Damien. We see Damien at the funeral with the President (Robert’s old roommate) and his wife, implying this is how Damien will begin his rise, although the sequel retcons this.\n\nThe film never once portrays The Devil out in the open, but rather controlling everything from behind the scenes (even more so than Rosemary’s Baby where he at least got a cameo), and it just works. In fact, Seltzer has said the original script was more overtly supernatural, but it was decided to keep it bubbling under the surface instead. We see evil in the form of characters like Damien’s nanny and her black dog, but even if they die, The Devil can afford to lose them. In fact, I find the creepiest scene to be the one where Robert and Keith Jennings are digging up the grave where his true son is buried.\n\nThe camera cuts back and forth from close-up to a wide shot that gives the impression that someone is watching them, which pretty well sums up the film’s portrayal of The Devil.\n\nThe Omen was a success, so of course the studio wanted sequels. Even though the first film told a complete story that pretty much showed Satan’s plan had gone off without a hitch, Damien: Omen II manages to still be interesting. David Seltzer didn’t want to write a sequel, but said if he had, he would have had it pick up the next day at the White House. Instead, the film picks up 7 years later with Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) living with his uncle Richard Thorn (William Holden), aunt Ann (Lee Grant), and cousin Mark (Lucas Donat) in Chicago.\n\nUnlike his politician brother, Richard runs Thorn Industries, a huge international company which it’s implied will assist with Damien’s true rise to power. I really like Holden’s performance here, even if a lot of it is rehashing Peck’s character arc from the first film. Peck’s Robert Thorn was always a bit distant from Damien (He knew it wasn’t his son from the beginning, and gradually learned he was the Antichrist), so one could perhaps interpret that Damien will become evil through nurture as opposed to nature. However, that theory is thrown out the window here, as Richard is a caring and easy-going father who treats his brother’s son as if he were his own. Of course there are other forces working to help Damien in his rise, but it’s a nice contrast in fathers.\n\nThere are a lot of silly, over-the-top deaths, far more than the original film, but there are also some very interesting character scenes that justify the sequel’s existence. At the military academy, Damien is mentored by Sgt. Neff (Lance Henriksen)…\n\n…and at his father’ business by Paul Buhler (Robert Foxworth), both of which are servants of Satan.\n\nAs some reviewers have pointed out, Neff and Buhler represent two of the four horsemen of the apocalypse from the book of Revelation. Neff is obviously war, and since Buhler is always looking for cheaper business practices to screw over poor countries, he’s famine.\n\nIt’s a pretty uneven movie, but the character development of Damien is really interesting, and Jonathan Scott-Taylor gives a performance that is both haunted and haunting. It insists on saying the name Carl Bugenhagen over-and-over which gets more hilarious the longer it goes on, but if you can get past the sillier aspects, it’s a decent film.\n\nThe follow-up was The Final Conflict, not Omen III: The Final Conflict, just The Final Conflict. Yes, apparently this could be the final conflict of any series. This was of course later fixed for the home video release, because people want to know what series they’re watching! The explanation I’ve heard is that there’s no omen in this film, so the title has no bearing on the story. Alright I respect that in the same way the Chinatown sequel isn’t called Chinatown II…. but, there is an omen in this film! The astronomers see a certain star alignment that predicts the return of Christ. That’s an omen and you could have used it in the title. Anyway, I’ll stop ranting about the title and talk about how stupid this film is on its own merits.\n\nOmen II was a lot sillier than The Omen, so I wasn’t expecting anything resembling a masterpiece from The Final Conflict, but you know what I was expecting? Ridiculous, overblown, so-bad-it’s-good Armageddon. We don’t even get that! Damien isn’t destroying the world through his business or controlling it as a world leader, he’s… the ambassador to the UK, like his father. That’s it.\n\nA young Sam Neill plays Damien, and the movie keeps telling us how exciting and charismatic he is, but he just isn’t. It doesn’t help that it’s an Australian actor playing a British character raised mostly in America, who had a British accent in the last two films but has an American accent in this one. Got that?\n\nAlright, alright, so what’s the evil plan of the Antichrist to bring about the end of the world? He… fears Jesus will come back as a baby, so he kills every baby born in Britain on the day a star appeared in the sky. That’s it. That’s the Antichrist? His kill count so far over three films is about 40. This is the greatest evil ever unleashed on the world? I mean, he’s a monster clearly, but compared to other horror villains, let alone real life villains, he barely makes a mark. A lot of the film is just him talking to The Devil about how evil he is, or monologuing to a crucifix and taunting Jesus. It’s really stupid.\n\nA group of priests gets their hands on the Daggers of Megiddo, but despite the elaborate process Carl “Yes that’s really my name” Bugenhagen lays out in the original film, a stab by just one dagger kills Damien after all! It’s genuinely one of the most anticlimactic endings I’ve ever seen. One dagger pierces him, Jesus appears, and Damien falls over dead.\n\nI don’t know if it’s supposed to be Jesus returning for the end of the world, or Damien was a failed Antichrist, because the world seems to go on after this. So in this universe where Hitler existed, this is the event Jesus needs to swoop in and stop? They just should have stopped at Omen II if they were going to be this anticlimactic about it.\n\nThe Devil began to fade away from horror movies as the ’70s ended, and Omen III in 1981 was a whimper, not a bang. Hammer tried one last gasp in 1976 with To the Devil… A Daughter, another film based on a Dennis Wheatley level, but clearly inspired by the success of Rosemary’s Baby and The Exorcist, as the story concerns a young girl who has been chosen to be the host for a demon, and the heroic occult writer who has to stop it. It’s awful, not at all subtle, and just gives up at the end, since I imagine the production ran out of money.\n\nSlashers had taken over the horror genre, and the Devil-next-door films were no longer mainstream. However, I don’t consider the beginning of the ’80s as the end of an era, because there was one year where we got three Devil horror films in one year (and also these eras are totally arbitrary and invented solely by me). We need to talk about the 3 Devil films of 1987.\n\nJohn Schesinger’s 1987 film The Believers may not fall into this category for some, as The Devil himself doesn’t make an appearance, and the cult members in the film are not technically Devil-worshippers, but rather voodoo practitioners. However, the film follows every beat of a Devil-worship-cult-unveiled plot and it’s undeniably playing to the audience’s familiarity with that kind of story. It’s with movies like this where I see Ira Levin’s point about the kind of fearmongering he worries his work led to. The cult in this film practices a form of Santeria, which is a real Afro-Caribbean religion. While it does go out of its way to point out the version involving human sacrifice is a twisted version of Santeria, and that there are plenty of good people who practice a safe version, you have to put it into context. Almost everyone watching the film in 1987 had never heard of the religion before, and this was their first exposure to it. What about it are they going to remember?\n\nMartin Sheen plays Cal Jamison, a psychiatrist who has just moved to New York City with his son Chris (Harley Cross) after the sudden and tragic death of his wife. The movie starts out on quite a bad note as we see his wife die in a very over-the-top accidental electrocution that adds nothing to the story and only exists for shock value. I kept waiting for it to be revealed this was pre-ordained by the villains, but nope, shock value only. However, it does quickly settle in to a groove as a very realistic story as Jamison, now a police psychiatrist, helps investigate a serious of bizarre child murders that seem to be ritualistic.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t last long, as the more we learn about the cult, the sillier it gets. I do like the idea that the cult is mainly just a bunch of rich white people using it to further their own wealth, a play on the term “voodoo economics,” but it’s not followed through enough. It’s still led by a non-white priest and plays off fear of the other, which isn’t great.\n\nIt’s also just not that scary, as it’s so obsessed with establishing realism that when the supernatural stuff kicks in, it feels fake. Rosemary’s Baby takes a while for the true horror to start, but it establishes this eerie, unsettling mood from the get-go with the haunted lullaby and gothic apartment building. The Exorcist has an eerie, almost wordless prologue in Iraq that sets the mood for the film before we meet our grounded, modern main characters. The Believers has none of this, and therefore has major tone problems.\n\nJohn Carpenter’s films didn’t usually rely on the supernatural, but in 1987 he gave us his interpretation of a Devil film with Prince of Darkness. It’s one of the only horror films to put a sci-fi spin on religious subject matter, and the concept in and of itself has potential. A conspiracy is uncovered that a small faction of the Catholic Church has been hiding The Devil away for years. I do have to wonder if Carpenter was inspired by The Twilight Zone episode “The Howling Man,” which also has a brotherhood of monks who keep The Devil locked away. However, instead of being a literal flesh-and-blood Devil, Prince of Darkness portrays him as… a cylinder of green, sentient liquid.\n\nYeah I realize how unscary that sounds, but it portrays The Devil as the son of the Anti-God, who is anti-matter and lives on the other side of a mirror. I don’t know, it’s sciencey mumbo-jumbo, but so are a lot of sci-fi movies.\n\nA group of grad students and professors is sent to investigate the sentient Devil liquid, and the film promises they’ll be looking at it from philosophical and scientific perspectives. It’s an intriguing set-up, but it’s just boring. The problem isn’t the scientific premise, which could be fun if it went either in a serious, philosophic direction or a goofy b-movie one, but it’s the characters. There are a whole bunch of grad students, and they’re all so dull. This is Brian (Jameson Parker), a porn mustache with a grad student attached, and he’s somehow our lead.\n\nHe has no discernible characteristics, and neither does his love interest Catherine (Lisa Blount). The characters are so boring that there’s a running joke that they can’t remember who the one is, and they keep just saying “radiologist, glasses” to jog their memories. Even weirder, this is the only character who has any discernible characteristics.\n\nI really appreciate Carpenter trying something different and original here, and he does create a certain sense of claustrophobia over the course of the film, but as the students are picked off one-by-one by the sentient Devil liquid, I just lose interest. If it spent more time on story and philosophy and less time on characters running around an abandoned church, it could be a really interesting film. Carpenter seems to be more interested in The Devil as a concept than a character, but it ends up being a half-baked idea.\n\nThe third and undeniably most interesting Devil film of 1987 is Angel Heart, a film noir/horror combination that blends the two genres perfectly. It’s a film I’ve talked about at length, particularly in my scene-by-scene analysis, which is still one of my favorite pieces I’ve done on here as well as one of the longest, so I’ll keep it short. In 1955, New York private detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down Johnny Favorite, a disappeared crooner Cyphre had a contract with.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Cyphre is The Devil, and it shouldn’t. It’s even acknowledged in the film that the name is something of a joke. Regardless, De Niro’s Satan is genuinely unsettling, from the ratty beard and hair to the long fingernails and creepy cane.\n\nIn his book Conspiracy Films: A Tour of Dark Places in the American Conscious, author Barna William Donovan talks about why Devil films weren’t too popular in the ’80s, comparing and contrasting The Believers and Angel Heart. He says that “Angel Heart, set in the 1940s, played out like a classic film noir private detective story, with only the final moments taking a turn into the horror genre,” concluding that “the film becomes so fantastic that all connections are broken with the world of the 1980s.” Never mind the fact that he switches tenses mid-sentences, this is a weird analysis of the movie. First of all, it takes place in the 1950s. It tells you that in the opening scene of the film, and it’s kind of crucial to the plot. Second, only the final moments take a turn to horror? I mean, it starts out as a private detective story, of course, but it’s pretty clear from the beginning that Angel Heart is a religious horror movie. From the opening saxophone wails and haunting shots of the city, it feels like something out of one of your worst nightmares.\n\nI would argue that The Believers has a more bizarre shift to religious horror than Angel Heart. Third, a film with fantastic elements can’t have a connection to the real world? You must be fun at parties. Let’s really break this down.\n\nYes, Angel Heart is set in the ’50s and feature a very intricate supernatural plot. Each character we meet reveals something about the plot, and many meet a very grisly fate. All of the murders are off-screen because this is a mystery after all, but we get some horrifying descriptions and do see some after effects. In the end it’s revealed that Johnny Favorite, the man Harry Angel has been hired to hunt down, is Harry Angel.\n\nThrough a very terrifying and in-depth ritual (Which we only see brief snippets of, thankfully), Favorite picked a man out of a crowd on New Year’s Eve and stole his soul to outrun Satan. He had to pick someone his own age, and unsurprisingly both had been in World War II. It has been the Johnny Favorite persona that has been killing off the victims, which is why Harry Angel doesn’t remember committing the murders until the very end. He’s buried the truths about the people he’s killed deep down inside himself so he doesn’t have to face what he’s done, but he often sees it in his dreams. It seems like a pretty clear metaphor for a soldier’s PTSD. Maybe you think I’m reaching here, but how does Harry Angel find out his true identity? Through his dog tags. Just like Faust or Rosemary’s Baby, it deals with the issues of the day through a supernatural story. Just because a film is set in the ’50s doesn’t mean it can’t be modern in its subject matter. Thankfully, Angel Heart has only grown in popularity and acclaim over the years, with many (myself included) now ranking it among the greatest horror films of all time.\n\nIn my upcoming final part, I’ll be taking look at how films portrayed The Devil leading up to the new millennium, and the re-emergence of Devil films in the last few years of horror.\n\nHOME\n\nAlright so confession time—I never found The Exorcist scary. I’ve always admired it as a film, and it features fantastic performances and direction, but even though an acclaimed supernatural horror film should be right up my alley, there was something about it that didn’t scare me. I think it was the ultra-realism mixed with the over-the-top supernatural story that didn’t quite do it for me, but we’re all scared by different things, and plenty of movies I find scary have been described by others as boring. That said, I rewatched The Exorcist recently and found something that truly unsettled me, something I had somehow missed before that made me look at the film in an entirely different light.\n\nDisclaimer: This article will cover themes of sexual abuse and intense sexual imagery in addition to the already explicit horror present in the movie. Also, as usual, I will be spoiling the whole movie, so this will not make any sense unless you’ve seen it.\n\nSometimes you watch a movie once or twice, move on with your life, and then come back to it years later and realize you missed something that was staring you in the face the whole time. Well there is one small piece of information in William Friedkin’s 1973 film The Exorcist that I had not paid much mind to before, but now I think may be the key to understanding the whole film. About halfway through the film, Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran), the director of the film Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is working on, is discovered dead after taking a fall from Regan MacNeil’s bedroom window.\n\nAt first, everyone assumes it’s just a drunken accident, but the strange thing that Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) reveals is that Burke’s head has been turned around 180 degrees in a way that wouldn’t happen from a simple fall, and that a 12-year-old girl like Regan (Linda Blair) could never do. The main question the movie poses is “How was Regan (who was also presumably sedated at the time) able to have the strength to do this?” or perhaps “Was there somebody else in the house?” However, this time I found myself asking a new question that either hadn’t entered my mind before or at least hadn’t stuck—”What the hell was a grown man doing in a 12-year-old girl’s bedroom?”\n\nChris was out of the house, visiting a doctor to talk about Regan’s worsening condition, so she had the babysitter Sharon (Kitty Winn) stay with a sedated Regan. When Sharon stepped out to pick up medication for Regan, she had Burke stay in the house. Burke is clearly a friend of Chris’s, and it’s implied he has some interest in her that isn’t reciprocated. When Chris returns, she doesn’t know Burke is dead and just assumes that he has irresponsibly left Regan alone, and when she finds out he’s dead, the scene fades out. Kinderman does ask her a few questions during his investigation into Burke’s death about Burke being in Regan’s room, but he never goes into detail, and Chris just says she has no idea.\n\nThe possibility that Burke was sexually assaulting Regan is never brought up by a single character, yet any decent detective would absolutely wonder what is going on there.\n\nLet’s take a look at what we know about the character of Burke Dennings.\n\nHe’s an eccentric European director.\n\nHe’s an alcoholic or at least a heavy drinker.\n\nHe is constantly off-color. The first comment we see him make at Chris’s party is about finding a pubic hair in his drink. It comes out of nowhere and clearly makes the people around him uncomfortable.\n\nHe likes to stir the pot just for fun. He accuses Chris’s servant Karl (Rudolf Schündler) of being a Nazi just to torment him.\n\nHe was, without a doubt, in Regan’s bedroom the night he died, because he fell from her window.\n\nThis is a character, albeit a relatively minor one, without too many sympathetic qualities. After he dies, things get exponentially worse for Regan as the demon inside her takes over more and more, and she deteriorates.\n\nStrictly in terms of symbolism, what would you think a writer was trying to suggest about a character who died with his head turned completely around? It seems to be a pretty clear metaphor for Burke being two-faced.\n\nOn the surface, he’s acerbic but amusing, but deep down he’s hiding a dark secret.\n\nIn fact, there is another eccentric European director of the time, who also has a first name with five letters and a last name with eight, that Burke Dennings brings to mind. Sure, Roman Polanski had not been convicted of statutory rape yet in 1973 when The Exorcist came out, but it’s not like he kept his interest in underage girls a secret in interviews. Even if the average American didn’t know, surely a lot of Hollywood people did. Furthermore, actor Jack McGowarn, who plays Burke, worked with Polanski on Cul-de-sac and The Fearless Vampire Killers, so he may have even been channeling him in his performance.\n\nAfter the fight between Burke and Karl is broken up, Burke snarks “What’s for dessert?” which is a humorous way to break up the scene… except for the fact that we cut immediately to Regan lying in bed. Viewed in this context, that’s horrifying.\n\nHow about the gradual decline as Regan’s possession gets worse? First, Regan tells her mother that her bed was shaking, then we see it shaking, then we see her being tossed up and down the bed by an invisible force against her will as she screams out in pain for it to stop.\n\nBoth the bed shaking and Regan convulsing on the bed and screaming are reminiscent of a rape scene, even if the rapist is not present.\n\nWhen you start realizing these things, you start noticing more and more images that suggest the movie may have a theme of sexual abuse. For example, when the bed posts are covered so that Regan can be tied to the bed, they look extremely phallic…\n\nWhen Chris meets Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) for the first time, she tries to cover her wounds with large sunglasses like an abuse victim might do…\n\nI also think it’s possible that Damien’s mother was abusive, at least emotionally, but that’s somewhat tangential to my main argument here, and it’s more my personal headcanon than a theory I can back up very well, so I won’t dwell on that.\n\nOn the wall of the basement, there’s a cutout of Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf (dressed as Grandmother).\n\nThe wolf in the story is clearly a stand-in for a sexual predator, and in some early versions of the story, actually is a sexual predator. In one version, Red Riding Hood is only able to get out of bed with him by claiming she has to use the bathroom.\n\nThis might be referenced in the scene where Regan sleepwalks down from the bedroom, interrupts her mother’s party (which Burke has just left), and urinates on the floor. More likely, the urinating on the floor is a symptom of sexual abuse, as it is one of many possible explanations as to why an older child would urinate during sleep.\n\nWhen the demon taunts Chris, it takes on the voice of Burke Dennings and says “Do you know what she did, your cunting daughter?”\n\nThis could easily just be the demon mocking Chris about Regan (while possessed) killing Burke, but doesn’t Chris already know? I mean, she’s aware by this point that Regan has supernatural strength, and she knows no one else was in the house. She’s pretty sure whatever is in Regan’s body killed Burke, so why would this be such a horrifying reveal to her? Also, why would Burke be the one taunting? I realize it’s most likely the demon posing as Burke, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense that he would be taunting someone about his own death. If he’s a sexual predator taunting the mother about his rape of Regan, that would feel more in character.\n\nHow about the other crime Regan commits—the desecration of the Virgin Mary statue?\n\nSure, it could just be the demon essentially “trolling” God and the church, but practical joking doesn’t really seem to be its modus operandi. It seems pretty obvious that the desecration of the Virgin Mary statue represents a loss of innocence and virginity. However, if it was something as simple as a loss of childlike innocence, the desecration of the statue, complete with blood and a penis, would feel extreme. Everyone outgrows their childlike innocence eventually, but this represents a complete corruption and destruction of that innocence. The most pure and holy of images has now been corrupted in an absolutely obscene way.\n\nOne warning sign that a child is being sexually abused is that they suddenly have a knowledge of sexual subjects they did not before, and frankly should not have. In the opening scenes of the film, Regan has a very childlike, innocent view of sexuality. She teases her mother about what she’s heard about her and Burke in a playful “I know who has a crush on you” kind of way. Once the possession begins, however, she immediately switches to graphic sexual knowledge, including masturbating with a crucifix, shoving her mother’s face against her vagina, and insulting the priests with sexual insults like “Your mother sucks cocks in Hell” and “Stick your cock up her ass.” The “stick your cock up her ass” line could even be a “Do what that other guy did” kind of taunt. It’s also important to remember that the crucifix scene itself is explicitly sexual abuse. Regan is not masturbating with a crucifix by choice—the demon is forcing it upon her.\n\nWhether or not you think the film is about sexual abuse, it seems pretty clear that Friedkin is drawing direct correlation between Regan’s medical tests and Regan’s exorcism. Both involve long, drawn out scenes where Regan is held down on a bed as older men cause her pain.\n\nIn fact, plenty of viewers have claimed they find the medical scenes to be as scary if not scarier than the possession scenes, but I think that’s what Friedkin is going for. If the film was simply a story about possession, would we really need all of these medical scenes? You could just have one scene with a doctor, or even just a line where Chris says “The doctors say it’s not physical,” and that would be that. Since I don’t think William Friedkin is some kind of torture porn fanatic, these scenes exist to draw comparisons to the exorcism. Look at the way this needle forms a cross right before it goes into Regan’s neck.\n\nWe get scenes where both the doctors and the priests gather around long tables and discuss what to do about Regan.\n\nThe Exorcist author William Peter Blatty was a strict Catholic (well, besides the three divorces I guess), and wrote his novel to be a straightforward story where an exorcism was the only option. William Friedkin, however, is agnostic (or at least was at the time) and wanted to make the story a little more ambiguous. The medical tests and the exorcism feel equally violating for Regan, and even though the exorcism “works,” it doesn’t work in the traditional sense. Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) dies, and the demon only leaves Regan when Father Karras punches it out of her and volunteers his own body as a host.\n\nIf you track with the interpretation that Friedkin is comparing the medical tests to the exorcism, let’s take it one step further. Friedkin is comparing the medical tests and the exorcism both to sexual abuse. In both scenarios, Regan is strapped to a bed unable to move as older men surround her and do all kinds of things against her will. She is clearly uncomfortable with the male characters, even grabbing a psychiatrist’s testicles at one point. In the hospital scenes, Regan is constantly poked and prodded with phallic objects, and what’s more, the doctors are doing brain examinations. Like a true abuser, they get in her head. There’s an iconic scene in the exorcism where Regan levitates, but that’s not the scary part to me.\n\nIt’s far creepier the way two older men forcibly lower her onto the bed, once again, a bed with extremely phallic bed posts.\n\nAlright, alright, so I think the story is about sexual abuse both on the surface and symbolically. How does this connect to demon possession? Do I think that all of the supernatural elements are in the characters’ heads and that Regan’s condition is only a result of trauma? No. In spite of the fact that the spiritual elements are a bit more ambiguous in the film than the book, I still believe that what we see on screen is what happens. Regan is possessed by a demon, her mother does everything in her power to make it stop, and eventually Father Karras sacrifices himself. To understand the way in which I think this all ties together, we need to take a look at the demon that possesses Regan.\n\nPazuzu is a pretty ridiculous name to say out loud, so Friedkin makes the smart decision of never doing it in the whole movie. (The sequel of course threw caution to the wind on this and used the name over and over.) At one point, the demon says “And I’m the Devil,” but it’s clearly either a scare tactic or a joke, as the Pazuzu statue we see early in the film later reappears during the exorcism.\n\nA Mesopotamian demon, Pazuzu ruled the demons of the wind, and brought famine and locusts. However, he was a nuanced figure in that he also fought other evil spirits and was a protector. This is referenced in the opening scenes of the film when a museum curator tells Father Merrin “Evil against evil.” There are only a few lines spoken in this creepy prologue set in Iraq, so this being said seems to set a tone for the film… except, who’s the other evil? The evil of the film is Pazuzu, and the heroes are everyone else right? The exorcists and doctors may go to extreme measures to get what they want, but they aren’t evil. Chris can be unpleasant to people to make sure Regan is taken care of, but she only does it out of love for daughter, and she is anything but evil. Kinderman is a lousy cop who can’t ask the questions needed to investigate the murder, but, per his name, he’s the kindest man in the movie. Evil against evil? How is this setting the tone for the movie unless there’s a hidden evil?\n\nWhen Regan shows Chris the Ouija board she found, Chris insists it takes two to play.\n\nRegan insists she has a second, her friend Captain Howdy. What Chris assumes is simply an imaginary friend is of course the demon Pazuzu, coming to Regan in a friendly guise. I’m going to make a bit of a leap here, but stay with me. A lot of the important events of The Exorcist do not happen on screen. We never see Burke Dennings’ death, we never see the death of Damien’s mother, and we never see Regan playing with the Ouija board when her mother is away. Again, if Pazuzu is a protector, what if he offered Regan a classic “deal with the devil?” He promised to protect her and kill the man sexually abusing her. Of course, she doesn’t know that in return this means welcoming him in to destroy her, exposing her to similarly horrible situations all over again. A demon against a sexual predator? Now that sounds like evil against evil.\n\nAt the end of the film, things seem to be better for Regan and Chris, as Chris ensures Regan doesn’t remember anything from the possession. It won’t be a gradual process of dealing with what happened, but the memory is simply, magically gone. Maybe it’s a happy ending, but this seems more like repressed memory to me. Repressed memory in regards to sexual abuse wasn’t discussed as much in the early ’70s, so it’s possible this isn’t the case, but I found it interesting. (For what it’s worth, I’m not counting any sequels as canon here since Friedkin had nothing to do with them, even if Exorcist III is an interesting film in its own right.)\n\nIf you’re interested in reading more about this topic in regards to The Exorcist, I’m not the only one who views the film this way. Rob Ager has a great video which I watched after developing my theory about the film. He actually disagrees on the “Burke Dennings is a sexual predator” theory,” but he raises some interesting points nonetheless. Like with my theory on The Shining, it’s not like I’m the first viewer to raise these questions, but I hope I’ve brought a few new points into the mix and have helped some viewers see the film in a new way. I know there are a few scenes I now find particularly creepy (the demon impersonating Burke, for instance) which I never did before.\n\nHOME"
