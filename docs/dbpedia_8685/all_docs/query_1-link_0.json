She has also collaborated with her husband, filmmaker Paul Schrader, in such films as Light Sleeper (1992) and Affliction (1997).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHurt was born Mary Beth Supinger in Marshalltown, Iowa, the daughter of Delores Lenore (née Andre) and Forrest Clayton Supinger.

Hurt's powerful turn in that film earned her a BAFTA. Other film roles include Laura in Chilly Scenes of Winter (1979), Helen Holm Garp in The World According to Garp (1982), and Regina Beaufort in Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence (1993).
