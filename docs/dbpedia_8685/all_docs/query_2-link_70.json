        "text": "Mostly “Franchises just shouldn’t!” is a safe and sane motto , but I think The Exorcist III is a little jewel (of a small masterpiece). The following are some of the things that I like about this film.\n\n1) The Exorcist III takes fans and the general audience back to Georgetown, the beautiful and sometimes strangely mystical setting of the original novel and film.\n\n2) It re-introduces familiar characters: Damien Karras, S.J., Fr. Joe Dyer, S.J. and Lt. Bill Kinderman. The banter between Kinderman and Dyer is at times scintillating and always very “true” in conveying their close friendship.\n\n3) The film – paradoxically – improves on Blatty’s The Exorcist sequel novel Legion by the at-first-startling premise that Karras’s sacrifice, which drew the demon “Pazuzu” out of Regan McNeil,was effective only for the child, but – shockingly – not for Damien himself.\n\nThe new premise is that the vengeful demon caught Karras’s ascending soul, forced it back into his nearly-dead body, and simultaneously inserted, along with it, the recently-executed spirit of James Vennamun, the Gemini Killer.\n\nKarras is not possessed, exactly, but he is trapped back inside his battered body, forced to watch the demon and Vennamun slowly restore the resuscitated corpse back to full but manic functionality.\n\nThen, again, the trapped priest is made to witness horrific events as the demon propels Vennamun to wreak revenge on people who were involved in the McNeil exorcism, whose names by chance also contain the letter “K” – the first letter of Vennamun’s abusive evangelist father’s name, Karl Vennamun, whom the Gemini is driven to humiliate and murder in effigy by killing people whose names contain the letter “K”. “Pazuzu” permits Vennamun to continue his “K-Killing” spree, targeting Fr. Kanavan, Thomas Kintry (whose mother assisted the Georgetown language lab in revealing that Regan McNeil’s possessed mind was thinking English, but in reverse), Fr. Joseph Kevin Dyer, who was Karras’s best friend…and of course, Bill Kinderman, who had investigated the film director’s murder in the original story and film.\n\n4) Another positive element is the return of Damien Karras as portrayed once again by Jason Miller. Unlike the Legion book, Karras AS Karras is present – a trapped soul whom the demon cheated out of his heavenly reward. Whereas in the Legion novel, it is merely Karras’s body that appears as a mere puppet whose strings are pulled by the joint efforts of the demon and the Gemini. Why is this new “Present Karras” scenario dramatically superior to Legion’s merely reanimated-corpse Karras? I think it’s because:\n\n5) Whereas in the original novel and film Damien Karras went on to his transcendent reward, in The Exorcist III the saintly priest is now himself the object of rescue. He who had rescued the possessed little girl in the earlier story is now himself the victim who must be saved. In The Exorcist III Bill Kinderman and Fr. Paul Morning – the Georgetown chaplain who, like Fr. Lankester Merrin before him, has exorcistic experience – are made to be the instruments of Karras’s liberation. Why is this scenario a good thing? I think it’s because:\n\n6) It provides a direct re-appearance of “Pazuzu” who comes to the fore to taunt and torment Morning and Kinderman. Once again, we witness the demon speaking for, and as, itself, quite apart from Vennamun’s ravings. “This time, you are going to lose,” the demon tells Morning, in a chilling line that appears in the original Exorcist novel but not in the Friedkin-Blatty film.\n\n7) It introduces Paul Morning in a wordless, eloquent, and poetic first scene. The priest is seen living on the Georgetown campus – directly across from the building that had been Karras’s residence in the first film, where Kinderman “dropped off” Karras to the tune of a Sal Mineo joke. Immediately we are brought back to the ambience and literal setting of the earlier film.\n\n8) Morning is introduced first by brief glimpses of his room, which are redolent of simplicity and sanctity – a neatly clean washbasin, a rosary, a few family photographs.\n\nMorning has been caring for a wounded bird that he is sheltering in a box on a window sill. The bird suddenly goes silent and Morning goes to check on it. As he moves to the window, the camera tracks his shadow from the back, as his silhouette passes by a framed slogan: “What we give to the poor is what we take with us when we die” – the same motto that is printed on a holy card in Damien Karras’s wallet in The Exorcist novel. And the rear-shot tracking of Morning immediately brings to mind Friedkin’s rear-shot tracking of Merrin in the Iraq prologue when the paleontologist-priest wanders up to a blacksmith pounding on an anvil. _The Exorcist_ film is very much invoked in this brief, nuanced scene of introduction to Fr. Paul Morning.\n\nMorning finds the bird dead and already stiff with rigor mortis. Then he watches as a crucifix falls from the wall. He investigates and sees that the corpus’s eyes are weeping blood. The light dims and “the Pazuzu wind” we know from the first film blows through Morning’s room, darkly foreshadowing the exorcism to come.\n\n9) The exorcism scene, although much too melodramatic and extravagant, still “works” – if we remind ourselves that most of it consists of hallucinatory visions induced in Morning and Kinderman by the demon’s powers. Even the Friedkin film contained some hallucinatory effects, such as the appearance of the Iraq Pazuzu statue in Regan’s room during the exorcism, as well as ceiling and door cracks that vanished after the exorcism was over.\n\nPeripherally, there are, of course, some things that I do wish were not in the film, e.g.:\n\nIts uncompassionate and unfunny scene of a wheelchair-bound dementia patient exposing himself to an eye-rolling nurse; the not-scary “jump scare” in the University hallway when typist-secretary “Alice” surprises Kinderman on a darkened stairway; the scene of detective-genius Kinderman – who, although he realizes that the head from the bust of a Christ statue was used in the murder of Thomas Kintry – nevertheless stands, cluelessly, directly in front of a headless Christ bust while waiting for a hospital elevator; the notion that Kinderman and Karras had been “best friends” – whereas in the first novel and first film, the detective only knew Karras over the course of perhaps at most two weeks, and sporadically at that – there was no narrative need to make the cop and the deceased priest “best friends”.\n\nAnother drawback is Barry De Vorzon’s “abstract-tonal” score, which relies on something sounding like an over-amplified cross between an elephant with gastritis and a grouchy lion. Meant to hint at the lurking nearness of the demonic, instead, the “scary noises”-based score only serves to remind us that “it’s just a movie” – and that, apparently, Blatty-De Vorzon thought that certain scenes were so weak that they needed to be beefed up with the artificial enhancement of cliched horror sound effects.\n\nWell, then – once again I’ve said my piece, without, I hope, being overly repetitive. Thanks to any and all who may take the time to read and/or comment!\n\nBecause I am not a materialist or a reductionist, in order to be philosophically authentic, I must admit the possibility of demons and demonic possession. However, in my reading on the subject, I have never once seen any evidence of documented, truly supernatural possession.\n\nAnecdotes stating “I witnessed this or that” are meaningless toward establishing the existence of demonic possession – even, and especially, such over-stated boasting as done by the late Vatican exorcist Fr. Amorth with his claims of having performed “thousands” (!) of exorcisms – not to mention the more commonplace claims of “Bible church” pastors who commonly identify nervous habits, attending dances and concerts, watching television and movies as “demonic” behaviors that predispose their congregations to possession, making them subject to exorcism.\n\nWhat is required are repeated scientific observations of a statistically significant number of possession cases, ultimately to be run through the peer review process. The immediate difficulty with that, of course, is the question of patient-and-family privacy. “Do you mind if we videotape, measure, probe and analyze you during your ‘possession’ state?” is a question that will most likely be always answered in the negative.\n\nBut even with such documentation, science cannot pronounce a possession case to be supernatural, for the simple reason that the supernatural does not fall into science’s purview. The most science could do would be to state that currently there is no scientific explanation for these phenomena.\n\nI’m not necessarily saying that “possession” witnesses are lying. I’m saying that the state of “possession” so far seems merely to be an unusual case of adolescent rebellion (regardless of the age of the victim) – at least judging by the speech patterns and behavior exhibited in these events. Sometimes there are even reports of telekinetic or “poltergeist” activity, but even those fall under the category of the paranormal, not the supernatural (“hidden powers of the mind” and the like).\n\nThe content of the “possession” victim’s speech is usually crude and aggressive, but not superhuman: i.e., the victim – supposedly under the control of an ancient demon – does not typically exhibit the preternatural attributes necessitated by the actual presence of a real demon. On the contrary, the jargon employed is usually barnyard-crude, sexually “dirty”, spiteful speech – in short: the standard content of teenage rebellion.\n\nExtreme caution is, therefore, required in examining these phenomena, and I believe that it is grossly premature to insist that there is any documented indication of demons and demonic possession. Withholding judgment is the most sane course until supernatural possession can be established as the most likely explanation for these cases.\n\nThe beauty of the late William Peter Blatty’s novel The Exorcist – and somewhat less of the William Friedkin film of the same name – is that the author deeply researched the possession literature, skimmed the most astonishing elements off the top, and injected them into a single “representative” case, within a spellbinding narrative in which characterization is as important as the supernatural themes. “Real” possession is not like that. The victim may exhibit little or no paranormal behavior, and certainly does not speak with the atavistic, preternatural wisdom and knowledge that Blatty places on the lips of his fictional demon. “Real” possession is much less dramatic – even feeble – by comparison to the demonic displayed in The Exorcist.\n\nSo, to reiterate, caution is the best attitude to take when considering demons and demonic possession. Western scientific materialism insists that there can be no minds or persons – what used to be called “souls” – that are not tied to neural nets. The notion of demons and demonic possession obviously flies in the face of this received wisdom, since a demon is a discarnate being (at least until it “possesses” a person!) – a non-material spirit-entity that is free to move sans the heavy chains of corporeality. Yet, as stated at the outset of this post, my own rejection of materialism and reductionism forces me to acknowledge the possibility of “minds without brains”. If such do exist, they all don’t have to be good, and some of them may have the power to control people’s bodies. But this is as far as I can currently go with demonic theorizing.\n\nThere’s a prevalent myth that the presence in the Friedkin film of police detective William/Bill Kinderman is an unnecessary plot distraction. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nChris McNeil, mother of the possessed Regan McNeil, knows that her friend and film director Burke Dennings has been killed in a fall down the precipitous stairs just outside her rented Georgetown house.\n\nBut what she doesn’t know, but Kinderman tells her, is that prior to the fall, Dennings’ neck had been broken and his head twisted completely around, facing backward.\n\nKinderman says that this could only have been accomplished by a very strong man, and very unlikely to have happened just from the fall. Yet, according to Chris, only Dennings and Regan were in the house at the time. Dennings had the habit of dropping by the house for a drink and a visit with Chris. On the night in question, he dropped by when Chris was out, and Sharon Spencer, Regan’s caretaker was home. Sharon needed to pick up a prescription for Regan at a nearby pharmacy and left Dennings in temporary charge of Regan – not an unusual situation given the friendship between the director and Chris. Contrary to another nasty myth, Dennings had gone upstairs to molest Regan – something completely out of character for the director who is an obnoxious drunk but not a child molester. One might imagine Regan yelling for help and Dennings going upstairs to render aid, or perhaps that he just went up to look in on the child. There is no need in this narrative to invoke any human molester, since the demon itself fully fills that role.\n\nChris returns home to find Sharon gone. She goes upstairs to Regan’s room where she finds the window open to the cold night air and Regan deep in sleep. Covering Regan, Chris goes downstairs just as Sharon arrives back home with the prescription. Sharon explains that she left Burke in charge for just a few minutes and can’t understand why Burke didn’t stick around until Sharon got back. “Sorry, I should have known,” she tells Chris and Chris says, “Yeah, I guess you should have”.\n\nThen Mike, a production assistant comes to the door and tells Chris that Burke has just been found dead at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nThis is where it stands until Kinderman informs Chris that Burke’s injuries could not only not have happened in the fall, but that he had almost certainly been killed by a very strong man. But how can this be, asks Kinderman, if the only other person in the house besides Dennings was “a very sick little girl”.\n\nChris immediately shows signs of stress, rattling coffee cups and saucers as she takes them into the kitchen. Kinderman’s conveying of the exact manner of Denning’s death has led her directly to the dire truth that Regan must have killed the film director. Chris already knows of the superhuman strength that Regan manifests when enduring the “seizures” that accompany the frenetic phases of her possession. In short: Chris now knows that her daughter – whether mentally ill or possessed – has murdered her friend Burke Dennings.\n\nChris carries this burden all to herself privately, since she cannot abide the idea of Regan being jailed or sent to an asylum. She keeps the secret until she can no longer do so, and she whisperingly confides to Jesuit psychiatrist Damien Karras, “She killed Burke Dennings… She pushed him out her window”.\n\nThus, Kinderman’s visit provides Chris with the dread but critical information that Regan killed Burke Dennings. This added, unbearable burden is an essential part of Chris’s character arc in the film. Without it, she would have never imagined that Regan – again, sick or possessed – was capable of such an act. And the confirmation stretches Chris’s endurance to the absolute maximum.\n\nThus, Kinderman’s visit to Chris is a major pillar in the unfolding of the story, not a peripheral waste of the viewer’s time.\n\nThe William Friedkin Film, The Exorcist, has been much discussed since it premiered in December 1973. Many points of contention surround the film, ranging from its graphic scenes of demonic possession to their religious implications. I would like to address two complaints frequently voiced about the film, namely, the opening scene featuring Fr. Lankester Merrin (played by Max Von Sydow) working at an Iraq archaeological dig where he unearths an amulet of the ancient demon-god Pazuzu; and the presence of police detective Lieutenant William Kinderman (played by Lee J. Cobb), especially the scene in which he interviews the possessed Regan’s mother, Chris MacNeil.\n\nThe first complaint holds that the opening Iraq sequence with Merrin is unconnected to the rest of the plot, an objection that is surely weak, considering that – in both William Peter Blatty’s original novel and the Friedkin film – the initial introduction of Merrin is crucial to the subsequent course of the story.\n\nMerrin introduces a palpable sense of the demonic in a virtually biblical setting where dusty, arid land furnishes sights of shepherds and camel caravans, and where the conveyed atmosphere is immediately atavistic and primordial. Through clever camera work and editing, Friedkin conveys the old priest’s sense of supernatural dread which begins with his unearthing of the Pazuzu amulet and increases until he announces to the museum curator that he will soon be going away because “there is something I must do” – which is a clear foreshadowing of his return for the exorcism at the film’s climax. Before Merrin reappears we are told that he has had experience with possession, having performed an exorcism in Africa some twelve years previously. So when he shows up at Chris MacNeil’s door on the night of the exorcism, the audience is mildly surprised and also relieved, since not only has Merrin’s exorcistic experience been made clear, but also because the sight of a familiar face provides a ray of hope in ever-darkening circumstances. Therefore, Merrin’s early introduction in both the film and the novel is completely justified dramatically.\n\nThe second complaint rails against Kinderman as a useless character who has nothing to add to the story – which is another misapprehension. Kinderman, in fact, serves a crucial, revelatory function as well as a critical narrative pivot to the action that follows.\n\nKinderman arrives at Chris’s house to conduct an interview about the strange death of the film director Burke Dennings (played by Jack McGowran), who had recently been directing Chris in a film being shot in Georgetown. Certain circumstances of Dennings’ death have convinced Kinderman that foul play was involved. The plain facts are that Dennings had fallen down the precipitous steps just outside Chris’s rented house and broken his neck. However, the evidence seems to point to third party involvement in the death, in that Dennings’ body had been discovered with its head turned completely around, facing backward (a feature common to occult ritual murder, a subject the novel delves into at some length). Therefore Kinderman wants to find out from Chris if there could have been anyone – especially a very strong man – in the house along with Regan and Dennings, who had been charged with watching her for a short time.\n\nChris already knows that the possessed Regan (played by Linda Blair) has incredible strength. When Kinderman explains that Dennings had, in all likelihood, been murdered by a very strong man, Chris quickly puts that fact together with Regan’s demonic strength, and comes to the dread realization that her possessed daughter had killed Burke Dennings. But Chris will not, and cannot, acknowledge this to the querying cop. Regan is Chris’s responsibility and she simply will not involve the law in her daughter’s life.\n\nSo in this scene Kinderman has inadvertently imparted to Chris that her own daughter – albeit under demonic control – has murdered her friend Burke Dennings. And, most importantly, the dire information is also now communicated to the audience. (This is very well demonstrated in the film, as Chris [played by Ellen Burstyn] gets up from the table, Kinderman’s empty coffee cup and saucer clattering in her trembling hands.)\n\nFinally, after Fr. Damien Karras (played by Jason Miller) has reluctantly taken on Regan’s case, Chris tells him that Regan “killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out her window”. The dangerous secret has now been shared with another person, a young Jesuit priest, which makes Karras, as well as the audience, now a witness to the unthinkable.\n\nTherefore, the character of William Kinderman, far from being a useless appendage to an otherwise smooth narrative, actually functions as a pivotal character, through whose imparted information Chris and the audience become aware that Regan – as a possession victim – has committed the murder that is so central to the story as a whole.\n\n(As the title warns, this is an unusually lengthy rumination on The Exorcist and the late William Peter Blatty’s self-directed movie sequel to his original novel.)\n\nThere seem to be quite a few misapprehensions about William Peter Blatty’s filming of his novelistic Exorcist sequel, Legion. This essay hopes, as best it can, to re-adjust some of the prevalent distorted takes on the film.\n\n= = = = = = = = = =\n\n1. The demon from The Exorcist – both the novel and the film – is definitely still active in the Exorcist III film – “he” is referred to by James Vennamun/the Gemini Killer (played by Brad Dourif) as “the Master…on the other side”, and also as a “certain party” who trapped Father Damien Karras in his own body, thus forcing the priest to watch as the Gemini mutilates and kills people who were involved in Karras’s earlier exorcism. “…Oh…. Let’s call it revenge”, says the Gemini. All too frequently, viewers claim that they have no idea of who the demon is, whereas the screenplay makes it clear that it is the same demon of the original novel and film. “He” is out for revenge against Father Damien Karras, and others who were involved in the demonic possession of Regan MacNeil.\n\nDuring the exorcism, the Gemini personality disappears and is fully replaced by the demon itself, who tells exorcist Father Paul Morning, “This time, you’re going to lose” (exactly what the same demon told Father Merrin in Blatty’s original Exorcist novel – and therefore a confirmation that we are dealing with the same demon), and who has been tormenting police lieutenant William Kinderman (played in the original by Lee J. Cobb, in the present production by George C. Scott). The demon indeed actually does emerge as itself alone at the climax of the film to taunt Morning and Kinderman. The demon still remains the supernatural villain of the piece, just as it did in Blatty’s original story and in the Blatty-Friedkin film.\n\n2. Kinderman is always, only, seeing Karras’s/Miller’s face and body. Only the audience sees the Gemini/Dourif as Miller and Dourif alternately perform the role.\n\nWe know this because the Gemini asks Kinderman, “Look at me, Lieutenant, and tell me what you see”, and Kinderman replies, “I see a man who looks like Damien Karras”, to which Vennamun furiously replies that he is James Vennamun, the Gemini Killer. This is later confirmed because Kinderman requests a dental records-profile of Karras – whom he can see is the only physical entity in Cell 11.\n\nSo the film contains: Only one body, occupied at first by two personalities – Karras and the Gemini – and at the end, after the Gemini personality has receded – only by Karras and the original demon itself. Kinderman can only look on with shock and dread…because, as the Gemini speaks, he succeeds in convincing the detective that the he, the Gemini, has truly, really, come back to life as a parasite living within Karras’s body … and, even more shockingly, is now forcing Karras’s resuscitated body to “rip and tear and mutilate” various victims.\n\n3a. The ceiling-crawling old lady is not the lady who is lurking behind the door. That lady is actually the Gemini-possessed patient with the bag carrying the wannabe Kinderman-killing surgical shears. In fact, both women are in the same scene: while the old lady ceiling-crawls, the nurse exits the door behind Kinderman, who finds that the “nurse” is possessed by the Gemini, and has incapacitated a real nurse and donned her uniform as a disguise so she can travel to the Kinderman residence incognito.\n\n3b. The individual who attacks the nurse in the corridor is not a phantom, or a Christ statue come to life, as many viewers mistakenly believe. The figure is only one of the hospital patients who the Gemini temporarily possesses, for whatever reason covered by a white bed sheet, and wielding a pair of “missing” (Gemin-stolen) surgical shears.\n\n4. The MAJOR change from the Exorcist and the Legion novels, vs. Exorcist III :\n\nIn the both the Exorcist and the Legion novels, protagonist Damien Karras has succeeded in saving Regan MacNeil – and has spiritually triumphed and gone on to his heavenly reward. End of story.\n\nAnd, consistent with that theme, in the Legion novel, Karras is not at all present as a living personality. Assumptively, he is in heaven. Nor is he possessed, because he is not occupying his resuscitated body in the first place. Rather, it is only that empty carcass which the demon regenerates and which the Gemini inhabits. Karras himself, as a person or as a soul, is not even there to be possesssed-and-saved.\n\nHowever, for the Exorcist III film …the studio demanded an exorcism scene, on the principle that because they’re calling the film an Exorcist sequel, of course, it must contain an exorcism. This unexpected imposition caused Blatty to hire Jason Miller – who had recently become free to do the project – to replay the role of Damien Karras. So Blatty re-engineered his original story of Karras’ sacrificial heaven-tending death in the following way:\n\nInstead of having Karras immediately going to heaven, Blatty invented the new scenario wherein the demon caught Karras’s soul while it was still “on his way out” of his battered body, and stuffed him back into his nearly-dead corpse – along with the recently-executed Gemini Killer.\n\nThat is the revenge that the Gemini talks about. Thus, the exorcism in the film has a twofold purpose: to expel the Gemini, AND to rescue Karras from the demon’s grip.\n\nIn fulfillment of this new scenario, the film’s climax presents two exorcists:\n\n1) the official exorcist, Fr. Morning;\n\nand…\n\n2) the unofficial “exorcist-by-gunshot” Detective Kinderman.\n\nThus, Karras, the former liberator of Regan MacNeil in the original story, is now himself the victim who needs rescuing.\n\n5. Regarding the supernatural “church invasion-distrubance” scene at the film’s opening, those flying bits and pieces are not locusts swarming into the church.\n\nFirst – such a scene would, contrary to both reason and good taste, connect the film to the monstrous John Boorman production, Exorcist II: the Heretic, wherein locust swarms and a preternatural “Good Locust” largely and painfully figure.\n\nSecond – the objects in question are not insects, but rather street-and-sidewalk leaf debris, probably meant to be driven by “the Pazuzu wind” which in the first film starts to blow when Fr. Merrin confronts the Pazuzu statue across a rocky chasm.\n\nThird, it is extremely likely that the scene as a whole is not to be taken literally, but rather as part of the opening narration, which itself seems to be an amalgam of the trapped Karras’s and the possessing Gemini’s garbled memories of the night of Karras’s “death”.\n\nIt is likely that the viewer is being invited to think of this opening narration as a kind of fever dream that is shared by both of the personalities – Damien Karras and James Vennamun/the Gemini – occupying the same resuscitated body. So it would seem doubtful that we are meant to take the debris-storm and the eye-moving crucifix as literal physical facts. If we do accept them as physical facts, this would be an unlikely case of the demon ineptly giving itself away – and that far too early and publicly by clumsily “outing” itself through an out-of-character, even ham-thumbed self-revelation.\n\n6. Again: In Exorcist III Damien Karras DOES NOT SAVE THE DAY. HE HIMSELF NEEDS SAVING.\n\nThe saintly priest’s soul has been trapped inside his own body and is the helpless witness of the Gemini’s depredations. It is Kinderman and Morning who save the day – Morning by attacking the demon via exorcism ritual and brandishing the crucifix at the beast – and Kinderman by providing the means of the merciful death that finally sets Karras free.\n\n7. Father Paul Morning was a tacked-on character, but Blatty was careful to show that this new exorcist doesn’t quite, exactly, “come out of nowhere” as an annoying intrusion into the narrative. Blatty takes care to give Morning a brief, prior exorcistic history, and poetically sketches the aging priest’s character in a gentle, wordless introductory scene that shows that he has been caring for an injured bird; finds that the bird has suddenly died;and then encounters the presence of the old demon when he witnesses a crucifix fall off the wall, the sky darkening, while the demonic “Pazuzu wind” begins to blow through his room.\n\nBlatty also shows Morning praying in the campus chapel – in another wordless scene, except for Morning’s vocalized prayer, which ends with a scriptural citation, “men of violence seek my life …my life…” – an explicitly foreshadowing hint that, like Father Lankester Merrin before him, Morning himself “must soon face an ancient enemy”.\n\n8. A final, very important (for those who care about spiritual matters dramatically expressed) theological notation:\n\nExorcist III is the first and (as far as I know) the only one of Blatty’s religious works in which the formerly hidden deity emerges into the material world to perform an act of divine intervention – for which we have that much-disdained added-in exorcism scene to thank.\n\nThis is worked out by showing a mysterious beam of heavenly light shining into the Gemini cell, which awakens the unconscious Father Morning, thereby permitting him to yell encouragement to Karras to break the demon’s hold – which Karras momentarily succeeds in doing – which in turn permits Kinderman the chance to free Karras by a lethal use of his service revolver.\n\nIn that final moment of clarity, Karras shouts, “Shoot me, Bill! Shoot now! Kill me now!”. Kinderman swiftly obliges the priest’s request. Karras’s final words are: “We’ve won… Now, free me.” Kinderman delivers a final shot, which permits Damien Karras at last to ascend to the heaven from which the vengeful demon had, for a hellish period, prevented his entry.\n\nBy this device, Blatty’s formerly hidden God has finally been permitted to reveal his presence on the scene – still invisible, but at last as a positively active Presence within the world – and this in a manner completely new to Blatty’s former theological contemplations about God’s absence from the world. A hopeful note on which Blatty ended his creative involvement in the Exorcist franchise.\n\nThe prologue in Iraq – featured in both Blatty’s (R.I.P.) novel and Friedkin’s film – connects with the rest of the story because it introduces the viewer, from the first frame, to the theme of “the Demonic”, and to “the exorcist”, Fr. Lankester Merrin.\n\nMerrin’s ongoing fearful reaction to the stone Pazuzu amulet, and the large Pazuzu statue on the hill, describe his inner state. Since they convey and produce fear, we immediately know that there is “something special” that accrues to them – something which is evil. The museum curator acknowledges this when he says of the amulet, “evil against evil”. As a Muslim, he probably believes that Paganism and its charms and idols are evil. But Merrin – as the story will tell us – is familiar with an even more universal evil, namely a demon he expelled some twelve years earlier.\n\nThe sense of evil and omen is not limited to the statuary at the dig. It is present in the over-loud street noises as Merrin takes tea; in staring Arabs; in the nitro that we see him taking. He is old and has a bad heart. When the clock stops in the curator’s office, it means more than a classic paranormal event presaging death: in a real sense, it hints at the stopping of Merrin’s own “ticker”, which happens at the story’s climax.\n\nMerrin also runs across evil in the form of human weakness and illness: he sees an Iraqi leading a blind or lame partner by the hand; then he encounters a blacksmith afflicted with blindness in one eye.\n\nThe omens and premonitions continue: along his way he is nearly run over by a droshky whose passenger is an old, sick-looking woman. Just before this, we see that he is being watched by a silent man in a tower. Omens and premonitions.\n\nWhat had started as a standard archeological dig has now become a projection-carrier for Merrin’s fears, specifically as the novel says, in the certainty that “soon he would face an ancient enemy”. The very air of Iraq itself now reminds Merrin of the kinds of feelings he had in the African exorcism twelve years before. The atmosphere has become, in Jungian terms, a projection carrier for the elderly cleric.\n\nFinally, the old priest confronts the Pazuzu statue, but not without first encountering rifle-toting guards. As he ascends the hill, the camera shows a single Arab staring at Merrin, while the soundtrack presents the sound of tumbling rocks (will Merrin “lose his footing”?).\n\nThen, as he faces the Pazuzu statue by the light of the setting sun, a demonic wind whips up to the tune of the frenzied growling of fighting dogs, while the soundtrack mixes a guttural “MERRIN!” into their cacophony.\n\nThat’s how Merrin and the Iraq prologue tie into the rest of the story. Once we see the old priest from the prologue walking in the American woods, and then arrive at the MacNeil house, we realize that the story is coming full circle and that now Merrin will indeed face “the ancient enemy”.\n\nOne misconception accrues to the prologue, namely, the notion that the archaeological dig somehow disturbed and released a sleeping or dormant demon. This explanation doesn’t really work, because the demon is not confined to any time and place – it is a non-material spirit entity completely free of any dependence on territorial or geographical roots. It is free to travel, to scrutinize potential victims, to go about the world in its own dark odyssey. Merrin first met it twelve years earlier in Africa – but who knows where it had been in earlier centuries and in different locales? Since its exorcism, it has been keeping tabs on Merrin, and Merrin, as the prologue shows, is psychically linked to the demon. He intuits its re-emergence into the world and into his life while he’s excavating.\n\nBut the excavation itself is not a causal element in Regan’s possession. The novel explains that the demon strongly desired a grudge match with Merrin because it did not like losing that time before, in Africa. It had finally located another target in the person of Regan MacNeil. Merrin sensed that something was brewing again, and went back to the States where he began working on another book, passing the time before the ultimate encounter. Events then conspire to convey the bishop’s message to Merrin, based on Damien Karras’s exorcism request. And we know how the story goes from there.\n\nAs most fans realize, the Exorcist III movie went through several iterations, some at writer-director William P. Blatty’s, and some at Morgan Creek Studios’, hand. Therefore there has been considerable controversy about the finished film – as well as a “director’s cut” recently released by Scream Factory. A fair amount of confusion abounds, and it may be helpful to examine some of the issues.\n\nDamien Karras died at the end of the original story and film – so why is he back in Exorcist III?\n\nIn Exorcist III’s initiating novel, Legion, Karras himself is not back. Instead, the vengeful demon from the original story has planted the soul of executed serial killer James Vennamun (“the Gemini Killer”) into Karras’ dying body. Actor Brad Dourif played Karras’ resuscitated corpse as animated by the Gemini.\n\nHowever, Morgan Creek demanded that Blatty rewrite/reshoot the film to include an exorcist and exorcism. Nicol Williamson played the exorcist, Fr. Paul Morning. In the meantime, Jason Miller, who had played Karras in the original film, became available for playing the Karras part in Exorcist III.\n\nBlatty decided on the solution: he would make the real Karras occupy the reanimated corpse along with the Gemini’s soul. This made Karras, the former rescuer of Regan MacNeil, himself the object of rescue, in which Detective William Kinderman and Fr. Paul Morning join forces. This change also had the effect of “upping the ante”, because now Karras is actually present, and needs to be freed from the grip of the demon and the Gemini.\n\nThat is why Karras is back in the story, and why Jason Miller is back as the real Karras, whose ascending soul was captured by the demon at the end of the original story and replaced into his dying body.\n\nWho attacked Nurse Amy Keating in the hospital corridor?\n\nIn this classic scene of horror cinema, Keating is ambushed by a surgical-shears-wielding figure draped in white cloths. Contrary to one opinion, this figure is not the Gemini, and much less is it the decapitated Christ statue, come to incomprehensible life, that is shown earlier in the film. Rather, it is merely one of the hospital patients whom the Gemini possesses and uses to kill and mutilate during his Georgetown crime spree.\n\nIs Karras possessed, and if so, by whom?\n\nKarras is not possessed. He is imprisoned in his old body and forced to intimately witness what the Gemini, with whom he is paired inside that body, does “with this body – with this body in particular”. As the Gemini explains, the demon, who Karras “expelled from the body of a child”, has arranged “a scandal for all men who seek faith”, the scandal being that the saintly priest has been forced to return as an unwilling agent of the demon-and-Gemini. Moreover, the demon directs Vennamun to kill Karras’ old friends and associates who were somehow involved in the Regan MacNeil case; and the demon also permits Vennamun to continue his crime spree from fifteen years earlier, in which he killed victims whose names started with the letter “K” (in revenge against his hateful father, Karl Vennamun). To all this horror, Karras is present, and impotent.\n\nAlthough Karras is not possessed – (again, he is only a kind of prisoner under duress) – nonetheless, he is trapped in his body and needs to be liberated and sent heavenward as he was at the end of the original story. In addition, the demon, who is pulling the strings behind the scenes, needs to be overcome, and the Gemini/Vennamun needs to be expelled. Hence, Fr. Morning begins an exorcism to vanquish the demon, expel the Gemini, and liberate Karras. Shortly after, Kinderman arrives on the scene and contributes his own efforts toward this goal.\n\nOther issues remain, but they will wait for later.\n\nIn my view, Wiilaim Peter Blatty’s novel Legion is at least as confused as his Exorcist III film, which is based on Legion-(cum-rewrite).\n\nFor example, the Legion novel contains page after page filled with extended internal dialogue of police detective William Kinderman about theology, evolution, crime, evil, and various problems of life – and they slow the narrative flow to a crawl. Kinderman’s theological speculations are show-stoppers. Too much time is devoted to them, they slow down the action, and worse, the author uses them as best he can to coerce the reader into embracing an uncritical Creationist/ID position. Kinderman is revealed to be – despite his nice words about science – a closet Creationist-mystic, as well as a type of heretical quasi-Gnostic.\n\nThe Gnostic material actually does work rather well, as it dovetails somewhat with Fr. Lankester Merrin’s earlier speculations in the Exorcist novel, and it serves as a resilient springboard for Blatty’s cosmic speculations about “the Angel”; the Gemini Twins (reified in the novel as James and Thomas Vennamun); and even the “Gnostic” theme of the divine twins (the God who permits a co-eternal divine “companion” to take on a new, personal destiny in the form of the cosmos/ matter/Satan/the Angel; the intense, depressed, dying Dr. Vincent Amfortas and his wisecracking Doppelganger, and even Fr. Joe Dyer with his semi-legendary “brother Eddy”.\n\nBut the Creationist/ID material is just bombastic and embarrassing, at least to anyone who is normatively or even nominally familiar with biology, physics, and evolutionary theory. In Christian philosophy, “Evolution” as well as “Creation” must be seen to derive from the same Divine source – but from what we now know about the world, it seems obvious that evolution would in this Christian view, be seen as the material means by which “the Creator” chose to develop – to “create” – life on Earth. Thus, Kinderman’s theology is, sadly – because it opts for the pre-scientific view – stuck at a level of childish, pre-critical Creationist/ID naivete – except for the few occasions when he waxes blissful about evolutionary mystic priest Teilhard de Chardin (who formed an important basis for Blatty’s Merrin character).\n\nMoreover, Legion seems to me to be a book written in a hurry, containing frustrating loose ends and plot quirks, for example: now, in an inexplicably updated history, Kinderman and Karras had been “best friends”; the language lab technician from the original story who discovered Regan’s “backward English” has now become a black female, etc.).\n\nAnd there is a puzzlingly disturbing bit where Dr. Amfortas’ Doppelganger tells the dying doctor that the (lost by death) love of Amfortas’ life, “Annie”, had carried on an affair with the book’s worst human villain, the malicious Dr. Temple…thus dealing the mostly sympathetic Amfortas a huge psychic wound within hours of his death – an authorial cruelty crafted for no understandable reason at all.\n\nAnother inconsistency: Kinderman accuses Dr. Temple of deliberately hypnotising and otherwise psychologically interfering with James Vennamun – it turns out that Temple was the chief medical officer investigating Vennamun’s decades-old original crime spree, with Blatty weirdly casting Temple, years later, as a possible information-feeder to the mysterious “Patient X” (who really is James Vennamun/the Gemini Killer), which creates the bizarre effect of casting Temple as a culprit who implanted the idea of being the Gemini Killer in the patient’s mind. This is an unnecessary distraction, and it corrodes Blatty’s main point that Vennamun/the Gemini is the real serial killer, placed by the vengeful demon into Karras’ resuscitated body to create a “scandal” by which the body of the saintly priest will continue the Gemini’s murder sprees. But of course, it is a given that the vengeful demon and the Gemini Killer do not need any oustside, suggestive help from Dr. Temple or anyone else – so to suggest such a thing may indeed have transpired – particularly so close to the story’s climax – casts doubt on Blatty’s main thesis that the vengeful demon has been the sole source of using Vennamun’s soul-in-Karras’-body to exact revenge on Karras’ old friends. Why on earth would Blatty cast this – or any – doubt in the reader’s mind (a doubt, which if true, risks invalidating the novel’s narrative flow and its very meaning) – and this so close to the story’s end?\n\nFinally, at the graveside where Karras’ body is being re-interred, Kinderman says “goodbye to the man who might have been Damien Karras“. What a blatantly inept thing to write! Why? Because Blatty has already established via the Gemini’s dialogue that Damien Karras – consistent with the first novel’s and film’s ending – has gone on to his reward. Only his resuscitated body is present, as a vehicle for the Gemini (with the vengeful demon of course lurking close by behind the scenes). DAMIEN KARRAS – AS KARRAS, AS THE SOUL OF KARRAS – is long gone away to Heaven. Only the reaminated shell remains, as a vehicle of incarnaton for the Gemini.\n\nHence, there is no room whatsoever for the notion that the re-interred corpse “might” have been Karras. It was never Karras – the body did not hold Karras’ soul – not after Karras’ original, real death in The Exorcist and later in the Legion’s takeover by the Gemini. The demon-manipulated Vennamun/the Gemini is the only occupant of Karras’ reanimated body (the studio rewrite would destroy and radically alter this original dynamic).\n\nFrom Vennamun’s own explanations, Kinderman, by the time he is standing by Karras’ grave, should have known that the recently dead body (dead for the second time) was only a reanimated shell that contained only Vennamun, not Karras; and Blatty, by insinuating some doubt about the matter both for Kinderman and for the reader – again, within just a few pages of story’s end, after the climax – seems to have committed a really irresponsible, goofy – and even disrespectful – gaffe. There can be no doubt that the re-buried corpse, although it was Karras’ body in the story, ever held Karras’ soul, which had already passed on to its heavenly reward. The body was not animated by Damien Karras during the Georgetown crime spree and Kinderman’s involvement therein: the body was animated only by Vennamun/the Gemini Killer, with the vengeful demon from the original story pulling the strings.\n\nAnd so… this long-winded post has attempted to justify why I think Legion’s pages and pages of Creationist speculation are scientifically embarrassing, as well as too lengthy and preachy; and why I think that the other listed flaws may perhaps derive from Blatty apparently writing the book in far too much of a hurry.\n\nMost of this post is copied, with some revision, from a reply I made to a poster on the imdb Exorcist discussion board at\n\nAbout\n\n= = = = = = = = = =\n\nA surprising number of viewers seem not to make, or to understand the clear connection between Exorcist III’s demon with that of the first film and novel (“Pazuzu”, if you will). Some express confusion about who is possessing Damien Karras’ reanimated body – is it a demon? is it Vennamun the Gemini Killer? how does this work? It turns out that, in Exorcist III, Karras’ soul is being held prisoner by The Exorcist’s one and only demon. They are identical personages – as Fr. Merrin would say, “There is only one” – and the resonance between the demonic personality in both films is easily understood when analysed step by step:\n\nAt the end of the first story, Fr. Damien Karras is free of the temporary possession he had called upon himself, he has saved Regan from the demon’s oppression and her mother Chris MacNeil from all the horror and anxiety that condition had caused… and Damien Karras is on his way to God and the Communion of Saints … BUT THEN – (and this only according to the Exorcist III plot rewrite)…\n\nThe victorious Karras’ ascending soul is somehow, through wicked supernatural mechanisms, caught by the expelled “Pazuzu” and forced back inside the priest’s nearly-dead body … THEN …\n\nThe vengeful demon places, as controlling agent, the soul of recently-executed serial killer James Vennamun/the Gemini Killer, back inside Karras’ body … THEREBY CAUSING …\n\n… The tormented Karras to be trapped inside his old body (except for brief articulate moments when Vennamun and/or the demon go into a state of “dormancy” and Karras utters snatches of prayer and once calls out to police detective Kinderman), while he watches Vennamun use his body as a vehicle and sometimes as the direct tool for a carrying out a new killing spree, this time in Georgetown … THEREBY NECESSITATING …\n\n… The rescue of Karras: The former rescuer of Regan and Chris – has now himself become the subject of rescue by a concerted effort by exorcist Fr. Paul Morning and Karras’ former acquaintance, Detective Bill Kinderman … with all this being ATTESTED TO by Vennamun himself …\n\nVennamun, speaking with Karras’ vocal chords, informs Kinderman that Vennamun has returned precisely because the original demon, who Karras expelled via his act of self-sacrifice, wants revenge on Karras, Karras’ friends, and certain others involved in the original exorcism. Vennamun says, in words to the effect, that the demon, after “being expelled from the body of a child, was not pleased … My Master, one of those Others over there on the other side…the cruel ones” hatched this plot to create a “scandal for all men who seek faith” by returning to earth in a proxy manner through the use of Karras’ body and Vennamun’s tenancy of said body. So:\n\nThe explanation, the method, and the crisis are thus perfectly explicated in Vennamun’s dialogue.\n\nHence, ideally at least, there ought to be no room for confusion on the part of the attentive viewer. Blatty’s rewritten screenplay, which originally contained no Damien Karras and no exorcism, has laid out all these changes quite concisely. Listen to Vennamun’s (convincingly performed by Brad Dourif) explanation and you have the entire plot rationale. It is surprising that so many, viewers cannot, do not, or will not understand this fully explained demonic modus operandi.\n\n[As my imdb correspondent listed, these are the demon’s main motives in this film:]\n\n“Exorcist 3:\n\nRevenge on a dead Karras\n\nDestroy Kinderman spiritually\n\nSpread more general ugliness in the world”\n\n[My reply:]\n\nI think that your comment is perceptive and true – about Karras (not to mention Dyer and others formerly involved, even tangentially, in the MacNeil case)…but especially of Kinderman.\n\nIn the beginning, Kinderman complains to Fr. Dyer about all manner of ugliness in the world, and finds it nearly impossible to find a living, responsible and responsive God behind the mess. Then, at the end, to his own horror and impotent rage, Kinderman finds that the demon has forced the aging detective to make a “statement of belief” in the demon and everything it represents (“… I… believe… in… YOU!“, says the wretched Kinderman).\n\nKinderman’s only solace in all this consists, perhaps only in his finding, against his skeptical instincts, that the supernatural truly does exist and sometimes has commerce with earth. Like Chris MacNeil before him, Kinderman now knows that “the Devil” is real. But also like Chris, Kinderman has been given a tiny gleam of hope: he knows that he and exorcist Fr. Paul Morning have expelled both Vennamun and the demon, and finally sent the now-liberated Damien Karras home to the reward he should rightfully have received at the end of the first novel and film (and which he DID receive before studio tampering forced Blatty to re-conceive the possession method for the film).\n\nMoreover, vis a vis the question of the reality and presence of an actively salvific deity: at the end, Blatty finally steps out from behind the veil he has created – the veil of the absent, non-intervening deity.\n\nFor the first time in Blatty’s writing, God is seen to actually intervene in the world/in the present, on behalf of the possessed and those who are trying to aid him:\n\nJust when all looks lost, a beam of divine light shines through Vennamun’s cell window, quickening the unconscious Morning, warming and strengthening him, permitting him to grasp his crucifix and encourage Karras to overthrow the demon/Vennamun: “Fight! Fight him, Damien!” Morning’s blessed but desperate admonition – against all logic but on behalf of all hope, finally, through God’s present intervening help – gets through to Damien, who responds to it with a strong, rebellious “NOoooo!”, thus momentarily throwing off the demon and Vennamun, giving Kinderman his chance for human intervention. And in those precious seconds, Kinderman compassionately acts on Damien’s plea: “Bill! Shoot me now, Bill – shoot now … We’ve won… now free me.” Which Kinderman does.\n\nThus, while the demon was partially successful in increasing ugliness and evil in the world, and for nearly psychically shattering Kinderman through that onslaught, still: With his direct experience of Morning’s courage, Karras’ endurance, and the certain proof that both evil and holy supernatural events are absolutely real, Kinderman is left with a genuine, though battle-scarred, sense of benediction. And that provides a most fitting and moving end to this film, the only authentic Exorcist sequel.\n\nAuthor William Peter Blatty wrote the novel Legion as a summation of his ideas for a screenplay for a sequel to his novel, The Exorcist. He filmed the story in a way that very closely paralleled the book. However, on viewing the film, the distributor, Morgan Creek Studios told Blatty that if the film was to be a real sequel to the first film and novel, it must contain an exorcist and an exorcism: they demanded a re-write. The understandably disgruntled Blatty went back to the drawing board, and crafted a new story in which the saintly soul of Fr. Damien Karras had been captured by the vengeful demon (“Pazuzu”, if you will) of the original story, and plunged back into his nearly-dead body – along with the recently-executed soul of serial murderer James Vennamun/”the Gemini Killer”. Jason Miller, who had originated the role of Damien Karras, had become available, and Blatty recast him in the role, along with Brad Dourif. The combination of the two very well presented and explicated the notion of Karras’ resuscitated body carrying both the tormented Karras and the venomous Vennamun (with the vengeful demon itself emerging during the film’s climax). All that was left was to invent an exorcism scene and cast an exorcist, who was eventually played by veteran actor Nicol Williamson in the new part of Fr. Paul Morning. The remainder of this post addresses Blatty’s choice in this matter.\n\nBy way of preface, it is of course obvious that Morgan Creek Studios should have more or less left Blatty’s version alone. But they didn’t, citing the unmarketability of a possession film – “an Exorcist film!” – without an exorcism, and Blatty dealt with it as best he could under the circumstances. In my analysis, Blatty did an admirable job, given the unpleasant new conditions under which he was forced to re-write his film.\n\n1. It is important to consider that it was not the studio that added the character of Fr. Paul Morning – or the exorcism scene – to the script. The studio only demanded that Blatty rewrite it to include an exorcism. Morning was entirely Baltty’s own creation. And, to my way of thinking, a fine creation it was.\n\n2. For instance, consider Blatty’s poetic, wordless introduction of Morning. First, the camera shows the Georgetown campus area where Morning is living. Doing this immediately returns us to the neighborhood of the Friedkin film, with Dahlgren Chapel (in front of which Karras and Kinderman strolled, talking murder and movies); the beautiful fountain in front of the chapel; and, viewed through Morning’s open window, the residence where Karras was living and where Kinderman parted company with him , making the “you look like Sal Mineo” joke. Thus, Blatty’s camera work deftly places us back in “Exorcist territory” in just two simple shots.\n\n3. The camera lingers briefly on simple personal and religious objects in Morning’s room which indicate his own simplicity and piety – an immaculately kept sink, a small figurine of the angel vanquishing evil; a Rosary on a desk; a photo of what is probably an infant Morning with his parents; an injured bird on the window sill that Morning has been kindly attending to.\n\n4. The bird’s sudden silence lures the Breviary-meditating Morning to the window. Blatty’s camera – as did Friedkin’s when following Merrin from behind as he approached the one-eyed blacksmith – also follows Morning’s shadow from behind as it reveals a wall plaque reading, What We Give To The Poor Is What We Take With Us When We Die – a reference to the original novel, where Karras carries in his wallet a “holy card” featuring the identical words. All of this has unfolded in silence, except for the birdsong, without any utterances from Morning.\n\n5. Morning finds that the bird has gone silent – in death. No sooner does he notice this, than his crucifix falls off the wall “by itself”. Frowning, Morning approaches the crucifix, only to find it mysteriously bleeding. The the sky darkens, the room is plunged into shadow, and “the demon wind” – so familiar from the Friedkin film – begins to howl through the room. Like Merrin, Morning stands stalwart, facing this new surge of the demonic, courageous and alone. This is pure Blatty; pure “Exorcist”.\n\n6. Later, Morning prays alone in a chapel, which includes the line, “men of violence seek my life…” Morning simply repeats the grim phrase…“My life…” and we realize that he is certain that he, like Merrin before him, “will soon face an ancient enemy”. And the next time we see him, he enters the Gemini’s den in the violent psychopath ward, to do just that.\n\n7. Blatty’s solution to the studio-demanded exorcism was, for many, much too over the top, but it needs to be borne in mind that his style of presentation is completely different from Friekin’s. Friedkin had an entire film to create demonic manifestations and a violent climax in which they were finally put to an end. Not so Blatty, who had to do a hurried rewrite and create his own exorcism scene – and confine it to a period of about five minutes.\n\nAs mentioned, Blatty’s style differed from Friedkin’s gritty, documentary “take”. Instead, Blatty focused on the psycho-spiritual-symbolic aspects, which is why he has lightning bolts chew up Cell Eleven’s floor, a symbolic crucified Karras surrounded by tormenting demons rising up through the shattered concrete, Morning, and then Kinderman, “crucified” repectively to the ceiling and the wall, hissing slithering venomous serpents, and hell-fire.\n\nTaken literally, it might seem ridiculous. But taken metaphorically but as real (real to Morning and Kinderman) visualizations of the demonic and of Karras’ torture, they function well. I suspect that most audiences – expecting a “real-world” set of physical effects – missed this allegorical-symbolic-visionary aspect and therefore found the exorcism not only unnecessary, but embarrassingly garish. However, the opposite is true when consideration is given to the fact that immediately after Karras – with Morning’s and Kinderman’s assistance – throws off the vengeful demon and the Gemini, Cell Eleven returns to normal: all the snakes, broken concrete, and pyrotechnics were real, but mental, phenomena, not physical events – which underscores their metaphoric/symbolic truth, if not their actual, “external world” factuality.\n\nSo: yes, the film should not have included Morning and the exorcism at all. But:\n\nFact: it does so for the simple, stark reason that the studio demanded it.\n\nFact: Blatty rewrote the script because he was so instructed/coerced, but I, for one, applaud his imagination in working it out on screen, and on his creation of a wonderful new exorcist-figure in the person of Fr. Paul Morning, who is a kind of “silent knight of the Cross” who gladly sacrifices his life (“My life…”) for Damien Karras.\n\nKarras, the hero and rescuer of the first film and novel, has now become the object of rescue, and Morning and Kinderman become his rescuers. To me, that schema – although an unnecessary result of an unexpected, last-minute and perhaps unfair studio demand – falls well within the parameters of Blatty’s already well-established “demon possession and its conquest through redemptive suffering” narrative, and – even as a post-production appendix – fulfils all requirements for belonging in the “canon”."
