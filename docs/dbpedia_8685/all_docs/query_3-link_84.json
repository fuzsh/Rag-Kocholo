        "text": "The exact time span of Regan's possession and exorcism is not explicitly stated in the film or the novel, but based on some clues and dates, we can estimate that it lasted for about two months. Here is how we can deduce this:\n\nAccording to the novel, Regan's birthday is on December 26, and she is 12 years old at the time of the possession.\n\nThe film begins with Father Merrin's discovery of the Pazuzu statue in Iraq, which is dated to October 1, 1972.\n\nThe film then cuts to Georgetown, where Regan and her mother Chris are living. The novel states that they moved there in September, and that Chris is working on a film that is scheduled to wrap up in November.\n\nThe first signs of Regan's possession appear around Halloween, when she plays with a Ouija board and claims to communicate with a spirit named Captain Howdy.\n\nThe possession gradually worsens, causing Regan to exhibit strange behavior, physical changes, and violent outbursts. Chris seeks medical help, but the doctors find nothing wrong with Regan. She then consults a psychiatrist, who suggests that Regan may be suffering from a split personality disorder.\n\nThe novel mentions that Chris's film is delayed due to a series of accidents and mishaps, and that she is still working on it in December.\n\nThe film shows that Regan's condition deteriorates further, leading to the infamous head-spinning and projectile-vomiting scenes. Chris also finds out that her director, Burke Dennings, was killed by Regan, who twisted his head around.\n\nChris then turns to the church for help, and meets Father Karras, a priest and psychologist who is struggling with his own faith and grief over his mother's death. Karras visits Regan and records her voice, which reveals that she is speaking in different languages and claiming to be the Devil.\n\nKarras then consults with Father Merrin, who has returned from Iraq and is recognized as an expert on exorcism. Merrin confirms that Regan is possessed by a powerful demon, and obtains permission from the church to perform an exorcism on her.\n\nThe film shows that the exorcism takes place on a stormy night, which is dated to January 30, 1973, according to a newspaper headline that appears in the next scene.\n\nThe exorcism is a grueling and terrifying ordeal, in which Merrin and Karras face the demon's attacks and taunts. Merrin eventually dies of a heart attack, and Karras sacrifices himself by inviting the demon to possess him and then throwing himself out of the window.\n\nThe film ends with Regan recovering from the possession, and Chris and her assistant Sharon leaving Georgetown. Regan does not remember anything that happened to her, but she shows a sign of gratitude to Father Dyer, a friend of Karras who comes to say goodbye to them.\n\nBased on these events and dates, we can estimate that Regan's possession began around late October or early November, and ended on January 30, 1973, making it about two months long.\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the demon is mocking Karras for his lack of faith and his reliance on scientific methods. The demon knows that Karras is skeptical of the supernatural and wants to see tangible evidence of the demon's existence. However, the demon does not want to give Karras what he wants, and instead challenges him to use his own faith and willpower to confront the demon.\n\nAnother possible interpretation is that the demon is trying to manipulate Karras and make him doubt his own abilities. The demon knows that Karras is suffering from guilt and grief over his mother's death, and that he feels inadequate as a priest and a psychologist. By saying that breaking the straps would be too vulgar, the demon is implying that Karras is asking for something trivial and unworthy of the demon's power. The demon wants to make Karras feel that he is not worthy of the demon's attention, and that he is powerless to help Regan.\n\nA third possible interpretation is that the demon is simply lying and trying to avoid exposing its weakness. The demon may not be able to break the straps, or may fear that doing so would alert the authorities and endanger its possession of Regan. The demon may also be afraid of provoking Father Merrin, another priest who is an expert on exorcism and who later joins Karras in the ritual. By saying that breaking the straps would be too vulgar, the demon is pretending to be above such a simple task, and hoping to deceive Karras and Merrin into thinking that the demon is more powerful than it really is.\n\nThe book by William Peter Blatty was inspired by an actual event, the supposed exorcism of a demon from a 14-year-old boy living in Mount Rainier, Maryland, USA. Blatty had read a news report concerning the boy, whose family had called in a priest after conventional medicine had failed to relieve him of various symptoms, including violent episodes and outbursts of foul language. The priest spent two months with the boy, during which he claimed to have witnessed him speaking Latin (a language the boy had no knowledge of) and moving across the room on his bed whilst sleeping. However, investigative journalist Mark Opsasnick researched the story after the film was released and could not find any record of a boy having lived in the house stated in the original news article in The Washington Post on August 20th, 1949. There had been a case in Cottage City, Maryland of an exorcism being performed on a boy who allegedly would spit involuntarily, growl when angered, and whose bed shook from time to time. Opsasnick concluded that this was the case which Blatty had read about and that the Mount Rainier piece was a fabrication. Interestingly, while Opsasnick had sought to prove the possession was real, the evidence he uncovered forced him to conclude that the boy was only mentally ill, and the possession story was the result of the boy's religious mother and grandmother, a credulous priest, and sensationalistic reporting in the media. Another priest present at the exorcism has stated that he never witnessed any of the behaviour the character in the book/film exhibited and that some of the behaviour he did see could have been explained in other ways, e.g. while the boy in fact did speak some Latin on a couple of occasions, he seemed to be repeating phrases the exorcising priest was reciting from the religious manual. Opsasnick's investigation is regarded as the final word on the case, he having gone more in-depth into the story than any other journalist before.\n\nFolklore says that demons, despite all the evil deeds and violence they influence people to commit, are actually very cowardly, so they choose a vulnerable target. Furthermore, in a scene deleted from the theatrical release, but re-inserted into the extended director's cut, Father Merrin and Father Karras have a brief discussion during a break in the exorcism of why the demon would choose, of all people, to possess a 12-year-old girl. The priests come to the conclusion that, rather than physical destruction being the demon's motive, it is in fact attempting to wreak spiritual havoc by causing people to doubt God.\n\nAlso it also shows that by making a young innocent girl into a monster, the demon was showing his true strength to people. He can take the most innocent looking creature, and make them into an ugly evil and vile monster.\n\nWhat better way for a horror author or director to display just how evil their demon is, than to have him possess an innocent 12yo girl? Physically small enough, that you dramatically display the demon's amazing supernatural power, by writing scenarios where the possessed 12yo girl sends grown men right across the room with a slap. But not so small that such a display seems comical, like it would to have a baby or toddler send an adult flying, like that.\n\n(12yo actors also have more skills, to portray a challenging role like the possessed Regan, as the centre-piece of a whole movie. Casting a younger child would better communicate \"corruption of innocence\", but they'd also lack the acting skills that Linda Blair showed, both with pre-possession Regan, and Regan under the demon's control)"
