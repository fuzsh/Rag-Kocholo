Did the Season satisfy our bloody curiosity?\n\nLet’s take a look and dissect Chapter 10 “Three Rooms”.\n\nWarning, there are spoilers ahead.\n\n“How far are you willing to take this?“\n\nThe words uttered by Pazuzu to Father Tomas as he challenges him hangs on the lips of every viewer that has stuck it out thus far.\n\nHow far are the writers willing to push the Angela / Regan storyline? And how deep are they willing to go for this final conflict?\n\nBut… first things first?\n\n“I’m dying for Him”\n\nWhen the Friars of Ascension challenge Father Marcus devotion to the church by slitting his wrists, they receiving a damning response as he declares his undying passion for the Lord.\n\nOne that cannot be questioned or taken from him, so devoted to the Lord, he is willing to die for Him.\n\nOh and did we mention that Father Bennett is still alive? (Although barely)\n\nAnd we are gifted with something of a buddy priest moment as our two victims meet again whilst tied up to chairs and bleeding to death.\n\nFamily meetings can be torture\n\nEspecially if Pazuzu is the one holding the talking stick.\n\nWith arms potentially being pulled from their sockets, kneecaps smashed, and lives threatened, one is reminded of family gatherings at Christmas dinner.\n\nBut one thing that proves trying for our demon on a mission is how blood is thicker than water, no matter how much of it he tries to spill.\n\nDespite their fractured lives they are willing to stand together until the bitter end.\n\nFather Marcus’ mission\n\nFreeing himself from the shackles of imprisonment and near death, Father Marcus then ventures off to save the Pope.\n\nYes that’s right the Pope.\n\nBut not without first pushing Maria Walters to give herself to the demons.\n\nFree to then prevent an assassination on the Pope b y preventing Father Simon, who by this point has curiously turned into a warped version of Father Jack from Father Ted, if such a thing were at all possible.\n\nOnce Marcus thwarts the plan by killing Father Simon, all is right in the world, which once again feels a bit of a week effort on the part of the Friars of Ascension.\n\nThey’ve been hatching this plan for a while, only to leave all hope of success in the hands of one priest.\n\nYou’d think they’d go all Agent Smith and duplicate themselves to a frenzy in order to act out there task.\n\nAnd what happened to all the possessed homeless folk?\n\n“You want me, come and get me”\n\nOn the other side of Chicago, the Rance’s have a battle of their own going on.\n\nIt’s revealed that part of Angela/Regan’s psyche still resides inside her mind as she gains in confidence and with the power and belief in the lord behind her, finally faces up to Pazuzu.\n\nMeanwhile in the outside world, Father Tomas comes too and in a moment that was somewhat reminiscent of Luke Skywalker’s confrontation before The Emperor where he tells his foe that he is a Jedi.\n\nExcept in this case, Father Tomas declares that he is an Exorcist, before acting out God’s will and using the words of the bible to take on the demon aided by the Rance family who provide a chorus behind him.\n\nEPILOGUE. Three Priests walk into a bar\n\nSo Pazuzu is defeated, left as a bloody pulp in the recesses of Angela/Regan’s mind.\n\nFather Tomas, Father Bennett, and Father Marcus collect their thoughts and once again act chummy over a nice cup of char.\n\nIf The Exorcist were to have any life beyond Season 1, this relationship is the one to explore.\n\nHardened Priests forced together to defeat a common enemy in a life that no one else can or will ever understand.\n\nThe Rance family meanwhile take up residence in a remote setting to start life afresh, presumably in a house conveniently left by the now deceased grandmother, Chris McNeil.\n\nAnd we’re left wondering if Angela/Regan really is free of her Demons and as safe as she proclaims.\n\nMy final verdict is that it felt a little too easy by the end of it.\n\nSo much promise for a final conflict but it was resolved with the bonding of a family and the words of the Lord.\n\nAnd I guess that therein lies the issue when you have to have a complete narrative to tell within 10 episodes and not knowing if that story could extend further into a second season, plus you are limited by the direction taken within the Exorcist franchise parameter.\n\nThis leaves you confined within the parameters and if Season 2 arise, the series needs to be free to break down these walls and get a whole lot darker.\n\nOnly then will it be able to soar above and become an entity of its own.\n\nWithout that freedom, its wings will be clipped and it will never fly onwards.\n\n– Paul Farrell\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist S1 Chapter 9 “126” review\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nTHE PENULTIMATE EPISODE has a tough task to undertake.\n\nIt’s sole purpose is to tie up all the strands that have been laid down prior and build itself up with enough of a teaser to allow the final episode to produce the climax.\n\nWhat will become of the Rance family now that Angela has given her soul to Pazuzu?\n\nWill Father Marcus follow the breadcrumbs left by Father Bennett?\n\nWill Father Tomas finally resist temptation?\n\nLet’s take a look and dissect Chapter 9, “126”.\n\nWarning, there are spoilers ahead.\n\n“Take me instead“\n\nIf any of you were wondering, at what point Angela had given of herself to Pazuzu, your query was answered this week.\n\nThe torture that was constantly being inflicted upon Casey was too much to bear, so to save her, Regan pleaded for her daughter’s life in exchange for her own.\n\nAll of which curiously led to “3 Little Dogs sitting on my doorstep, growling a sweet growl”\n\nAnd time for Pazuzu to tie up lose ends.\n\nThe Friars of Ascension meet their match\n\nJust how powerful is Pazuzu and what demons lie behind or entwined within the Friars of Ascension cult.\n\nPazuzu is certainly powerful enough to force the cult members to bow to his demands.\n\nWe see throughout this episode the extent of his manipulation, both physically and mentally.\n\nSo it’s interesting to see that despite resistance, they are unable to fight Pazuzu.\n\nDoes this mean that the Friars are less threatening as a result?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nThe Rego’s get too close to the fire\n\nThe first of our victims would turn out to be The Rego’s.\n\nToo much snooping cost them dearly and so Lester and Cherry, The Exorcist’s answer to the Lone Gunmen (X-Files) met their maker.\n\nI guess someone had to go, and God forbid it should be any of or leads.\n\nThe victory lap\n\nContent on bringing about an end to those that crossed him, Pazuzu then sets his eyes on Mother Bernadette. “There’s been a great disturbance in the force.”\n\nYou could almost hear her saying this when she mentions sensing Pazuzu’s entrance.\n\nWhat Mother Bernadette probably didn’t predict was just how damning and vile this demon can be as Pazuzu snuffs out her life like one would to the flame of a candle.\n\nAnother character that had promise but felt as though was cruelly robbed of any further exploration in order to prove the daunting task our Exorcists will have if they have any chance of destroying him.\n\nThe Set Up\n\nAnd so we come to our 3-pronged storyline and what will inevitably be our final conclusion to the Rance family possession.\n\nFirstly – Father Marcus has the devil in him.\n\nHis drive for revenge leads him to Father Simon. And boy does he let loose.\n\nBut it’s not enough to finish off Father Simon yet (of course) as he is saved by a couple of lackeys and Marcus is whisked away.\n\nAnd Father Tomas receives a revelation in the page of a book by Chris McNeil, proclaiming that the demon will chase Regan/Angela until the end of time.\n\nCue him chasing back to the Rance household to break up a family meeting.\n\nAre we set for an epic conclusion?\n\nWill The Exorcist reach a satisfying end to this chapter?\n\nThe Surgeons will tune again next week to give our final assessment.\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist: S1 Chapter 7 “Father of Lies”\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nOF ALL THE EPISODES so far, this one really felt like the series was treading water and stretching out the storyline.\n\nHaving said that, it still had little moments, gems if you will that kept you hooked into the direction that the series was going in.\n\nBut only just.\n\nLet’s take a look at those moments in Chapter 7, “Father of Lies”.\n\nWarning, there are spoilers ahead.\n\nFather Tomas steps up\n\nSince his fall from grace, Father Tomas has set out with a point to prove.Yes, he fell foul to temptation with Jessica, and there is doubt to be looked at still when it comes to their relationship.\n\nBut, Casey is a member of his patronage.\n\nAnd there is a sense of loyalty on Father Tomas part to stand by his pack.\n\nHe will strive to do what he can in order to save Casey.\n\nAnd there was one moment above all else that stood out in this episode when he stands between her and Father Marcus.\n\nAt this moment he directs Casey to bow towards him. He is her saviour.\n\nThe power of God\n\nOne thing that may be worthy of noting is Father Marcus’ belief that the power of God runs through his hands.His belief is carried on from when he temporarily saved Casey’s soul last week.\n\nBut is this self-belief going to be his undoing?\n\nSo far, not much has shaken Father Marcus, but his confidence in his gift, could well see him trip up.\n\nEspecially as he’s so good at pointing out everyone else’s flaws.\n\nFather Bennett challenges The Friars of Ascension\n\nIt was an episode that allowed doubt to creep in.Mother Bernadette doubts Father Marcus can save Casey and believes her soul is lost.\n\nAngela questions Tomas and his faith that Casey is still alive.\n\nBut nothing is more potentially damning than when Father Bennett starts to question the representatives within the Friars of Ascension.\n\nSomething is amiss and Father Bennett doesn’t back down from his hunch.\n\nBut will this lead him down a path that he won’t be able to return from?\n\nFather Bennett’s descent into hell\n\nSpeaking of Father Bennett’s journey, his pursuit would lead him down a dark path, where he would discover the bloody corpses that are being used for some kind of sacrificial pact and literally has to fight his way out in order to survive.\n\nFather Tomas goes off the rails\n\nThe pressure becomes too much thought for Father Tomas and he spirals downwards.\n\nBelieving that all could be lost, he loses his normally cool demeanour and God-like ways and lashes out on one of his flock.With no one to turn to, he calls upon Maria Walters, much to her delight.\n\nWill she now be looked upon kindly by the demons that she is so devoted to?\n\nAngela’s decent into madness\n\nAnd what was actually an incredible performance (which I was surprised to see from Geena Davis) was Angela’s loss of faith in all around her when she truly believes that Casey has gone.It was both believable and tragic when she learns that all is not lost, at least not with Casey, but perhaps now the Demon has his ultimate prize in his sights?\n\nThe soul of Angela is there for the taking.\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist: S1 Chapter 6 “Star of the morning”\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist, Uncategorized\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nTHE EXORCISM has been performed albeit without the desired results that Father Marcus and co. were hoping for\n\nSo… Where does that leave things for this series?\n\nThe writers and producers would have known that there was only so much rope to tie around the Rance’s possession, and with last week’s revelation that Angela is indeed Regan, where does that leave things?\n\nWhat more damage can the demons accomplish?\n\nWell, let’s take a look at Chapter 6, “Star of the morning” to see if there were any clues.\n\nWarning, there are spoilers ahead.\n\nChris MacNeill sold out\n\nTowards the beginning of the episode we are provided with something of a flashback.\n\nBasically, in the series version of Chris MacNeill, there is a lack of empathy towards her.\n\nAfter the ordeal that her daughter went through during the exorcism, Chris’ acting work dried up and she was left with the option of writing a book exploiting Regan’s demonic encounter entitled The Devil In My Daughter.\n\nThe impact that this had between her and Regan was evident in the latter moving away and changing her name.\n\nWhat does it mean now that Chris is back on the scene though?\n\nCan she really change her ways and more importantly, will Regan forgive her for her sins?\n\nThere is a moment in the morgue when it is revealed that the body is not Casey, that suggests there is hope there yet when both Chris and Regan hug, but again, is this just a false ray of hope for what is to come?\n\nFather Tomas’ descent\n\nIt appears that the Friars of Ascension’s hopes of luring him into their fray has come undone by the temptation of Jessica that they unleashed upon him.\n\nHis distractions have led him down another path, but can he be saved and will he redeem himself yet?\n\nIt appears that he is still willing to prove himself to Father Marcus.\n\nThe Friars of Ascension\n\nThe main focus moving forward does appear to be on the devil cult known as the Friars of Ascension, who have attained some pretty powerful representatives from the city of Chicago.\n\nChief among these gatherers, priest aside, was the Chief of Police, hand picked by the demon himself to become, “One of Us”, much to Maria Walters chagrin.\n\nWith the demon / devil attaining more and more power from Chicago’s officials, what is the end game here?\n\nAnd why is Father Tomas so important for their succession?\n\nDead bird gorging on the river bank\n\nWhen Father Marcus finally does catch up to Casey, it is via tunnel network underground riddled with the possessed homeless.\n\nWe see Casey in full demonic mode, and even taking on the spider walk to make good her escape.\n\nFather Marcus persists however, stumbling across Casey by the river, washing away her sins in a baptism as he performs his last exorcism upon her and freeing her soul.\n\nIt all seems a little too easy by this point.\n\nWhy does the demon give up on her now?\n\nNow that Angela has revealed herself as Regan, does the Demon want to exploit this further and claim her as his prize?\n\nWe’re well and truly past the halfway mark now, with four episodes remaining.\n\nWe’ve made it thus far, but can’t help hoping that they’ve left some kind of ace up its sleeve as the show is in danger of losing interest fast.\n\nPaul Farrell\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist: S1 Chapter 5 “Through My Most Grievous Fault”\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nTHIS WEEK’S EPISODE appeared to follow firmly in the footsteps of its inspiration.\n\nFor sometime, this series has been circling around some issues that were questionable and at times uncertain of direction.\n\nBut with last night’s reveal, things began to cement itself in place and a clearer direction was left in place.\n\nSo let’s open up the operating theatre to dissect the latest episode and delve into this plot a little deeper with 5 key points taking from Chapter Five, ‘Through My Most Grievous Fault.”\n\nWarning, there are spoilers ahead.\n\nAngela is Regan\n\nIt was the elephant that had been in the room staring us in the face with no one daring to utter the obvious.\n\nYes, the reason that Angela was so quick to recognize her daughter’s possession is that she had witnessed a similar episode before firsthand.\n\nWhat’s more she is Regan from the original storyline and inspiration for the series, now all grown up with a new identity.\n\nA secret that she even kept from her husband Henry. How will there relationship play out now that this has been revealed?\n\nWe all know that the past has a way of catching up with you now matter how hard you try to run away from them.\n\nAnd there’s no hiding from these feelings from God or the Devil for that matter, for they know all.\n\nNow that the demon has found Angela again though, what is his grand plan? Why the fascination with her?\n\nThe temptation of Jessica part 2\n\nSpeaking of fascinations, the inevitable occurred when the demon explored Father Tomas’ one weakness, his feelings for Jessica.\n\nSex is one of the Devil’s greatest assets to exploit and greater men have crumbled.\n\nLeft with his tail between his legs, how will Father Tomas come back from this? Especially as he ‘sowed his seed’ with Jessica anyway,\n\nCan he truly redeem himself after exploiting his temptation and giving in to his desires?\n\nKatherine’s Lament\n\nShe may have had her heart in the right place but boy did Kat play into the Devil’s hands.\n\nShe firmly believed that she was helping her sister by calling the police, but all that she enabled was to let the devil roam free.\n\nWill her good nature be her own undoing?\n\nHas turning her back on her family only pushed her further away from them?\n\nThe cracks have will and truly appeared and there’s no knowing if they can reunite together again.\n\nThe return of Chris MacNeil\n\nThis is one area that caught me off guard a little.\n\nI liked the nod to the ray of hope cast from the street light and the expectation that this savior could be another expert priest arriving on the scene, but the reveal that this was Chris MacNeil left me deflated, it was all very well leaving us to believe that Regan was back on the scene but to introduce her mother too felt a little too far fetched.\n\nBut is this revelation a false hope?\n\nWill her introduction and its likeness in symbolism to the original film spell out doom for her?\n\nThe Devil on the run\n\nAnd what of Casey? Having finely tune her devil’s side and giving an Ambulance and its occupants a fine work over that would make the likes of Michael Myers blush, she is now on the loose.\n\nWhat end to this game of cat and mouse?\n\nWill she be found and in what state will she be in if they find her?\n\n– Paul Farrell\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist: S1 Chapter 4 “The Moveable Feast” review\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis\n\nTHE DEVIL’S IN THE DETAIL.\n\nAnd this is certainly going to be the case if The Exorcist is going to stand it’s ground as far as longevity is concerned.\n\nWhat does go in tis favour is the focus on character development and intrigue around the church’s approach to combating demon hood.\n\nThe question is can they sustain this right through the season?\n\nSo let’s open up the operating theatre to dissect the latest episode and delve into this plot a little deeper with 5 key points taking from Chapter Four, ‘The Moveable Feast”.\n\nThe Breakfast of Champions\n\nThis series doesn’t shy away from the blood and gore, much to our delight.\n\nBut the dish served to Casey of the bloody eggs and deformed birds had us turning our heads in disgust. (In a good way)\n\nWhat this scene allowed for was a window into Casey’s soul as she struggles with containing power over the demon.\n\nAs we snap back to reality, poor Casey is strapped to a hospital bed and face to face with the ‘invisible man’, as he tempts her to give in to his will.\n\nShe finally gives in however when he threatens to kill the Nurse that has been looking after her.\n\nWhat does this mean now for Casey?\n\nIs she beyond saving or is there still an amount of ‘light’ and ‘purity’ to save her soul?\n\nThe comedy element\n\nFor the drama and horror to have a stronger impact on its audience.\n\nIn this episode, the comedy element comes from two new characters, the paranormal geeks, Cherry and Lester Rego.\n\nBoth of who throw up wild theories and accusations but seemed to land on a kernel of truth, when they point out the growing cases that have been developing in and around Chicago.\n\nThey’re light-hearted banter was a joy to watch and I wonder if we’ll see the couple return further down the track.\n\nThe hidden motive of Maria Walters\n\nFather Tomas may have been relieved that he has the support and money from a wealthy source in the Papal community, but I can’t help but wonder what her ulterior motive might be.\n\nThere were certain looks that she would give and her insistence for Tomas to cash that cheque.\n\nWhat is driving her will to support Tomas’ parish?\n\nHas she made her own agreement with the Devil?\n\nThe temptation of Jessica\n\nOnce more, old flame Jessica arrives on the scene to lure Father Tomas away from celibacy.\n\nWe learn that Jessica’s current boyfriend has been cheating on her, which results in Tomas showing compassion towards her and offering up his apartment for her to crash in.\n\nBut when Tomas shows Jessica that he is willing to break the rules, does this mean that he is letting his defences down and in doing so, giving her the opportunity to show her womanly ways?\n\nWill Tomas give in to temptation and provide the demon what he needs to corrupt his soul?\n\nThe power of the Nun\n\nHands down though, the best moment in this episode came from the introduction of Mother Bernadette.\n\nHer team of Sisters is undergoing their own battle with demons in what looks like a demonic version of Fight Club.\n\nEach night they battle it out with a possessed soul to bring them back to the light.\n\nIt is a fascinating insight into the methods that the church is willing to undertake in their fight against evil.\n\nThis also allows Father Marcus the opportunity to resurrect his faith and “powers’ for want of a better word.\n\nWith this restored faith in his ability to confront the demon with love not hate, has him prepped and ready for his next actions.\n\nSpeaking of which, it looks like we might be finally getting to the Exorcism of Casey Rance in the next episode, ‘Through My Grievous Fault’.\n\nWhat will happen now when Father Marcus and Father Tomas team up again to cure Casey and lure the Demon out?\n\nAnd what will happen when The Demon does come to the surface?\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist S1, Chapter 3: “Let Em In”\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nIT’S ALL ABOUT the burn in the next chapter of The Exorcist.\n\nAre these incidents separate examples of how much the demon has his hooks into the city? Or are we dealing with more than on demon as prophesized by Father Marcus?\n\nWe were also offered further insights into these characters and the demon/s may have had on them for some time.\n\nSo let’s open up the operating theatre to dissect the latest episode of The Exorcist and delve into this plot a little deeper with 5 key points taking from Chapter Three, ‘Let Em In”.\n\nThe car crash\n\nIsn’t that a thing?\n\nYou declare your true feelings towards your soul mate and friend, when a demon steps out in front of the car, causing it to crash and killing your beloved.\n\nSuch is the plight that faces Katherine in the first of our flashbacks involving the Rance’s.\n\nBut what does this mean and reflect?\n\nIs this would-have-been lesbian affair, a torment on Katherine’s soul?\n\nDoes the demon capitalise on this often scorned upon view of gay relationships in order to gain control over Katherine?\n\nWhat is there to gain from this?\n\nAnd did you notice that we never saw Julie’s face at all?\n\nA touch that I liked and adds weight to the symbolism of their relationship, especially as it was Julie’s face that Katherine was describing that she was attracted to at the time that the accident took place.\n\nThe burning man\n\nIf ever the Pope’s welcoming committee needed convincing that Chicago is falling foul to the Demon’s delights, surely it comes in the guise of a burning man, who turns up outside the building.\n\nNot much seems to be said around this, other than a brief mention from Bennett, who may have been the only character swayed be the depths of depravity circling them.\n\nWill the clergy finally get their act together, or is it all too little too late?\n\nFrom one burn to another\n\nAfter stealing a dress from the store, once again showing how under the thumb she has become, Casey is taken in front of Marcus, who begins to drill her about her inadequacies and jealousy of her sister.\n\nThis action draws the demon to the surface, which reveals to Marcus that he is the same demon from the failed exorcism in Ep 1, much to his disbelief.\n\nSo armed with the proof that Casey is clearly under the demonic influence, (caught on camera by Father Tomas) they try to stake their case for an exorcism, only for Marcus to be slapped in the face with an excommunication.\n\nMan that’s gotta sting. Better cool off by getting smashed in the church pews.\n\nOh, and just burn the excommunication papers while you’re at it too.\n\nThe curling iron replaces the crucifix\n\nA fairly infamous scene from the movie, bears witness to Regan using a crucifix to masturbate with. An action that is used to shock her mother in order to display just how possessed she now is.\n\nHere a similar device is used to shock, but instead it’s the audience that bear witness to the cruel act of self-mutilation as Casey inflicts bodily pain upon her genitals with a curling iron.\n\nIt’s a gruesome moment and one that reflects the fine line between pleasure and pain and treads a similar ground to Clive Barker’s Hellraiser in the process.\n\nThe train scene\n\nEarlier in the episode, Henry starts to realise that there is something clearly wrong with his daughter and when he tries to pry into what is going on, he falls into a temporary coma, (a result of his scaffolding injury).\n\nCue demonic possession in from of an entire carriage full of people.\n\nWhen a guy sexually advances on Casey, the demon arrives and lures the dark side to the surface.\n\nCasey then shreds the guy apart with his body eviscerated and then his jaw ripped open.\n\nFuck that was intense, but another indication that sex is definitely a key attributer to when the demon’s power is at its greatest, when you combine this attack with the self-mutilation scene and the car crash at the beginning of the episode.\n\nAnd did you notice at the end of the train attack, there was another sign declaring, ‘He is coming.’ over Casey’s shoulder?\n\nWith all this doom and gloom circling the characters, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there is no hope for light in the darkness.\n\nBut when Bennett hands Marcus a list of places to go to, outside of Chicago, is this a beacon for him to follow in order to restore order and faith once again?\n\nAnd can Father Tomas take on the torch in Marcus’ absence?\n\nTime will tell in the next episode, ‘The Moveable Feast’.\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist: S1 Chapter 2 “Lupus in Fabula” review\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nalan, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nSPEAK OF THE WOLF and he will come.\n\nThe Latin translation for the second episode from The Exorcist takes its emphasis from, the wolf in question is The Devil.\n\nBut in what form will the devil take?\n\nAnd what exactly is his plan.\n\nOnce more I will open up the operating theatre to dissect the latest episode of The Exorcist and delve into this plot a little deeper with 5 key points taking from Chapter Two, ‘Lupus in Fabula”.\n\nHas Father Marcus lost his touch?\n\nFather Marcus is a veteran in the field of exorcism, and has no doubt seen many challenges along the way, but has he met his greatest challenge yet.\n\nWhen he tries to snoop into the background of a homeless man, (who reacted to young Casey at the church, where he recognizes the devil in her), Marcus is then confronted by an elderly woman showing all the hallmarks of being possessed.\n\nTry as he might though, Marcus is unable to keep the demon at bay.\n\nHas he lost his touch?\n\nIs the devil truly that powerful, or has something happened to lessen Marcus’ strength?\n\nIf his powers are truly stifled, what does that hold for the battle between Good and Evil that lay ahead?\n\nDo our hopes then lie with Father Tomas instead?\n\nWill Father Tomas past come back to haunt him?\n\nSpeaking of Father Tomas, it seems he is still a doubting Thomas, despite all the evidence that has been shown to him so far.\n\nOr at least he’s still not willing to rock the boat when it comes to his religious elders.\n\nAnd then there’s the matter of his old flame, Jessica.\n\nDoes he still hold a torch to her? And will this be his’ own undoing?\n\nGive the Devil an inch and he will find a way to break you.\n\nWho is the strange man that visits Casey?\n\nSpeaking of the devil, his hooks seem firmly in control of Casey, who starts to see a strange man, and yet is completely comfortable around him.\n\nIs this the Devil himself, come to visit and manipulate her?\n\nThe first time we see this man, would indicate this. He visits Casey at the Lacrosse game, where she gets her “Carrie” on and uses some telekinetic ability to snap an opponents’ leg.\n\nWhen her mother Angela gets suspicious and deceptively makes Casey drink some Holy water, you’d think that the game was up, and yet, the Force is strong with this one, as Casey contains herself long enough to get through dinner before barfing up pea soup into the toilet.\n\nHow long can she hold up this guise though, when there are bloody centipedes appearing under her pillow?\n\nHow far does the devil’s arm reach?\n\nOne great piece that come out of this episode was actually centred away from The Rance’s and the priesthood and into the neighbourhood.\n\nThroughout the episode, we are shown a young guy with headphones cruising in and out of shot, leading the audience to think that there was a potential back-story that we would follow with this character.\n\nLittle did we know it was a rouse to show the true length of the Devil’s reach within the community as said headphones is dispatched along with his family in a massive bloodbath and all their organs are removed.\n\nWhat are these organs for?\n\nAre we about to witness a blood pact or sacrifice ala The Wicker Man?\n\nWhatever lay ahead, it doesn’t bode well for the locals.\n\nAnd did you notice, the wrong side of the Pope?\n\nThe closing image of the episode was a poster announcing the arrival of the Pope, coming to town, but strangely the image is of the back of the Pope.\n\nCould this infer that it’s not the arrival of The Pope that we should be prepared for, something much worse?\n\nSomething of unspeakable evil that lurks where not even the greatest living religious presence can see.\n\nEpisode review: The Exorcist: S1 Chapter 1 “And Let My Cry Come Unto Thee” review\n\nPosted by in The Exorcist\n\n≈ 1 Comment\n\nTags\n\nAlan Ruck, Ben Daniels, Geena Davis, The Exorcist\n\nSO THE EXORCIST TV series finally reached Australian shores and a plethora of excitement had been brewing from the Surgeons of Horror camp in anticipation of where this series would take us.\n\nAs usual, there were skeptics and believers among our team of professionals, but as Lead Surgeon, it was my duty to take on board the dissection of the Season.\n\nAnd what better way to do this, than by dissecting one episode at a time.\n\nThe Priests:\n\nFather Marcus\n\nRight for the set-off, this series would focus on the priests, as they will play the centrepiece for the show, which I highly support.\n\nCharacter is such an important aspect of any movie or TV series. In order to keep our interest they must be strong and filled with plenty of depth, especially as what we hope will transpire is the breakdown or assassination of these characters when they come face to face with the demon.\n\n“You gotta build them up before you can pull them down.”\n\nFirst up is Father Marcus, played the magnificent Ben Daniels, who can convey depth with a single look.\n\nHe’s the hardened veteran of Exorcism. A man that has already witnessed the extent of The Devil’s work and danced in His playground.\n\nBut to what extent has he gone too in order to challenge and rid people’s souls of evil?\n\nWe get the chance to witness a doomed exorcism take place, where Marcus will stop at nothing to try and outfox the demon, to the point of pulling a gun on a fellow priest.\n\nWe’re also given our first twist in the tale, albeit via a painful twist of the neck – a nod to the original – but as was duly pointed out by fellow Surgeon Antony Yee, “That would kill yer”, and in this case, it did, and Marcus would lose this battle.\n\nSo, Marcus is a hard-boiled guy from the heart of humanity, shaken to the core, but lived to see the next day. Is he now about to meet his match in the Rance household?\n\nFather Tomas\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we have Father Tomas, a young pioneer in the priesthood, destined for great things. His parish is in a rundown part of town, but he has restored faith in the community with his energy and spirit. And his sermons reflect this.\n\nBut what ails him? There are whispers of his relationship with a woman. Has he truly buried these feelings?\n\nAnd do you get the feeling that he’s had it too good so far? That his life has been a little too easy up to this point?\n\nWill his quest for greater things lead him to darker places? We certainly hope so.\n\nIt’s certainly going to be interesting when he comes face to face with the demon.\n\nOr has the demon already got his hooks into Father Tomas?\n\nAre these nightmares that he is having, the perfect vessel for the demon to manipulate with Father Tomas’ mind, before the game even begins? It would be pretty cool, if this was the case, and the journey all the more rewarding when he does do battle.\n\nAll is not well in the Rance household\n\nIt would appear from the beginning, that certain things are off kilter with the Rance’s. We’re led to believe at first that the trouble centres on the daughter, Katherine, who was recently involved in a car crash, where one of her friends died.\n\nHowever, ironically enough, it seems that she is probably the least of our concerns at this stage.\n\nIn the “twist” reveal, we are shown that it’s her sister, Casey that is under the devil’s thumb. The sweet and innocent are much more corruptible and mold like putty in the devil’s hands.\n\nUnfortunately this reveal, was pretty obvious and didn’t blind-side me at all. There is promise of more twists to come, and I hope that they bring on the shock factor, as this was a little underwhelming in its delivery of plot.\n\nHaving said that though, I do take my hat off to the character development involved in this episode, as it certainly holds potential for further developments down the line.\n\nInterestingly though was Casey’s comment, whilst possessed in the attic, about there being more than one rat to contend with. Are their more people already under the demon’s control?\n\nThere are certainly hints that the father, Henry (Alan Ruck) is not all together there and hasn’t been for some time.\n\nAnd let’s not forget Angela (Geena Davis) the hypersensitive mother of the family who suspects the devil’s hand at every corner. Is there more to her than meets the eye? She seems very quick to shout “Demon” when it comes to Katherine.\n\nWhat has made her so on edge?\n\nHas she had dealings with the Devil before?\n\nThe homage\n\nThe last word I have on this episode is the homage to the original movie.\n\nWhilst every fan loves to see the nod of reflection to cinema’s finest moments, in this case when Marcus arrives at the possessed abode and lifts his head to the heavens to gaze upon the lit window of an apartment above, whilst silhouetted by it’s haloed glow, we can only wish that these are few and far between if the series is to make it’s own mark in the franchise and stand on it’s own feet.\n\nTime will tell if indeed the series will be able to stand out of it’s predecessor’s shadow and become an entity in it’s own right."
