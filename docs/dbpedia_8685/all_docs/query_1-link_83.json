I am officially depressed at all of the things I could have done with my life while I was watching Hatchet II (or as I like to call it… Crap Part 2!) I came upon this website: http://lifehacker.com/5792245/simple-actions-you-can-do-in-minutes-to-change-your-life\n\nI then started to think of all the things that every man and woman could do with the 90 minutes that they gave to this gargantuan, enormous, humongous, Oprah-sized steaming pile of pig shit. Cures for diseases could have been stumbled upon, a fire could have been put out before it became an inferno, children and puppies could have been hugged. Hell, I could have spent 90 minutes in the bathroom taking a shit and reading Archie comics and I would not only have been more entertained, but more would have actually been accomplished.\n\nI could go on about the atrocious acting, the pointless story, the cartoonish kills, or the pointless villain. But, I would most like to point out that this film is 1 hour and 25 minutes (that includes the credits) and almost 1 full hour consists of characters doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! It opens with a quick “killer does something ridiculous and stupid.”\n\nIn this case, not only does he rip out the intestines of a man, but then uses them as a tourniquet around his throat and choking him till his head pops off. I’m not even fucking kidding. After that, the main heroine (played by Danielle Harris with the worst southern accent ever put on film) goes back to town and spends almost an entire hour talking, talking, and talking to townspeople about the most mundane and boring shit you could possibly imagine. It goes on forever. She meets with a voodoo guy, she meets with a bunch of people, she talks to others, she wanders the town, and blah blah blah. For a slasher film, it’s almost shocking how completely boring and devoid of suspense this flick is."
