        "text": "Greyfriars Kirkyard\n\nAlso known as Greyfriars Churchyard\n\nAddress: 26A Candlemaker Row, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nFounded: 1562\n\nSize: 5 acres\n\nNumber interred: 250,000\n\nIn 1447, Franciscan monks (called the Gray Friars for the color of their robes) built their friary at the north end of the Grassmarket on a slope with a lovely view of Edinburgh Castle. The Franciscans, a medical order, served the poor there until they were chased out of Scotland by the Reformation in 1558.\n\nTheir friary yard was claimed by Queen Mary in 1562 for a public burial ground. Just in time, too. The graveyard was used “extensively” during the Black Plague of 1568.\n\nThe first peer buried there was James Douglas, Earl of Morton, executed in 1581 after being accused of the murder of Queen Mary’s husband. The next year, he was followed to the graveyard by historian George Buchanan. Both graves went unmarked, common practice at the time. Painters George Jameson (died 1644) and Sir John Medina (died 1710), and poet Allan Ramsay (died 1758) also lie in unmarked graves.\n\nAt the foot of the cemetery’s east walk stands the Covenanters’ Monument — also called the Martyrs’ Monument — which remembers Scottish Presbyterians who died for their faith rather than convert to the Anglican Church founded by Henry VIII in England in 1534.\n\nThe scourge of the Covenanters was Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh. He was a highly educated member of the Scottish Parliament, a lawyer, and a member of the Privy Council of Scotland. In 1677, he became Lord Advocate in the service of King Charles II of England, in charge of punishing anyone who refused to swear loyalty to King Charles or rejected the Church of England.\n\nBy Mackenzie’s command, 400 Covenanters were imprisoned in Greyfriar’s Kirkyard in 1679. The guards abused them. They suffered from the weather, lack of shelter, and starvation. Many ended up buried anonymously in a mass grave in the Kirkyard. In all, Mackenzie is blamed for the deaths of nearly 18,000 people during the eight years dubbed “the Killing Time.”\n\nMackenzie himself died and was buried in the Kirkyard in 1691. His tomb stood quietly until 1998, when a homeless man broke into it. When the thief ransacked the coffins, the floor collapsed beneath him, spilling him into a plague pit full of bones beneath the mausoleum. The man managed to haul himself out, then ran screaming into the night.\n\nSomething had been unleashed.\n\nFor the past twenty years, Greyfriars Kirkyard has been considered one of the most haunted graveyards in the world. Visitors have been scratched, bruised, and bitten near Mackenzie’s mausoleum. Blasts of cold air chase some visitors away. Others become nauseous and disoriented or are struck with splitting headaches. One woman was found unconscious near the mausoleum with bruises like finger-marks around her neck.\n\nIn 2000, spiritualist minister Colin Grant attempted to exorcise the mausoleum. He felt the presence of hundreds of souls in torment and a presence of overwhelming evil. He fled the Kirkyard, but it was too late. He died unexpectedly of a heart attack several weeks later.\n\nYouTube is full of videos of people showing off bite marks and bruises received while touring Greyfriars Kirkyard. Enter at your own risk.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there is a history of grave robbing at Greyfriars Kirkyard, to supply dissection specimens for the medical students at the University of Edinburgh. The cemetery is overlooked by watchtowers built to protect the sanctity of the dead here. Wealthy families also had cages of iron bars built over their loved ones’ graves, to prevent their bodies from being disturbed. That’s grim enough, even without the poltergeist.\n\nUseful links:\n\nThe cemetery’s homepage: https://greyfriarskirk.com/visit-us/kirkyard/\n\nWelcome to The Most Haunted Graveyard: https://www.thedailybeast.com/welcome-to-the-most-haunted-graveyard-in-the-world-safety-not-guaranteed?ref=scroll\n\nGrave robbers at Greyfriars: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/television/programs/evening/2015/10/30/grave-robbers-greryfriars-kirkyard/74880434/\n\nGreyfriars Kirkyard’s connection to the Harry Potter books: https://www.pottertour.co.uk/blog/greyfriars-kirkyard-harry-potter-peter-pettigrew.html\n\nNight tours of Greyfriars Kirkyard: https://www.cityofthedeadtours.com/tours/city-of-the-dead-haunted-graveyard-tour/\n\nGreyfriars Kirkyard is one of the 199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die.

(Check my cemetery column here for details.) Unfortunately, the same can’t be said of many of our favorite horror movie actors and directors. Too many of them do not have grave sites, whether they were buried in unmarked graves or their ashes were scattered – or I couldn’t determine the disposition of their remains. I wish we could find some appropriate way to honor them.\n\nWhat follows is a listing of actors gathered from the Horror Writers Association Facebook page and conversations with my local HWA chapter and others.

Vincent Price read his eulogy.\n\nAfter a successful run of DRACULA on Broadway, Hungarian-born Bela Lugosi became a star in Hollywood. He died during the filming of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Frank Sinatra paid for Lugosi’s grave in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Lugosi was buried in one of his black opera capes.

There are almost 20 documented instances of vampires being exhumed in New England, beginning even before to the American Revolution.\n\nOne of the last recorded vampire tales in New England took place in the 1880s. George and Mary Brown farmed outside the town of Exeter, Rhode Island. Mary Brown was struck by an illness, probably tuberculosis, that drained her vitality. She withered and died in 1883.\n\nThe following year, Mary’s eldest daughter, Mary Olive, died at the age of 20.\n\nSeveral years passed before George and Mary’s son Edwin began to fade. The local physician suggested that Edwin and his wife move to Colorado Springs to recover.\n\nThe cold, dry air did seem to help Edwin, but while he was recuperating, his sister Mercy began to fail. Edwin rushed home to say goodbye to her. She died in January 1892 at the age of 19.\n\nSince winter had frozen the ground solid, Mercy’s body was placed in the receiving crypt at Chestnut Hill Cemetery. Receiving crypts were common, back before cemeteries developed heating blankets that could thaw the winter ground. Old cemeteries often still have these crypts, although nowadays the sheds are used to store mowers and other equipment.\n\nBack in the 1890s, Edwin’s health deteriorated. George Brown’s neighbors decided Edwin was suffering from Vampire’s Grasp. The only way to save him would be to “perform the folk ritual.”\n\nOn March 17, 1892, the doctor and George Brown’s neighbors dug up the graves of Mary and Mary Olive. George stayed home. Both women’s corpses were badly decomposed, as one would expect after almost a decade in the ground.\n\nThen the receiving crypt was opened. Mercy’s coffin was still inside it. When the mob opened her coffin, Mercy had turned sideways inside it. Rather than considering if she had been buried alive — or merely jostled as she was carried to the crypt — onlookers took that as assurance she was the vampire.\n\nOther than her strange position, Mercy’s body looked as expected. But when the doctor removed her heart and liver, they leaked blood.\n\nThe neighbors placed the organs on a rock in the cemetery and set them afire. The ashes were collected up and mixed with liquor to be fed to Edwin. Unfortunately, the remedy didn’t save him. He died six weeks later, in May.\n\nWhen Bram Stoker died in 1897, newspaper clippings about Mercy’s exhumation were found in his possession. H. P. Lovecraft, who lived in nearby Providence, mentioned Mercy in his story, “The Shunned House.”\n\nWhether she roamed from her tomb or not beforehand, Mercy now turns up as a ghost in this “nondescript little cemetery.” Apparently, blue lights hover close to her grave.\n\nMercy’s gravestone is anchored to the ground to prevent it from being stolen. There is reported to be a guest book in a tupperware box for you to sign. Remember that this cemetery is still in use, so if you visit, behave yourself.\n\nUseful links:\n\nFindagrave listing: https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/1451811/chestnut-hill-cemetery\n\nOdd Things I’ve Seen visitation report and photos: http://www.oddthingsiveseen.com/2007/12/grave-of-mercy-brown-vampire.html\n\nMercy’s story with the family obituaries: https://rihs.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/have-mercy/\n\nThe Atlas Obscura listing, with directions to another Rhode Island vampire’s grave as well: https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grave-mercy-brown\n\nThe reference about Stoker & Lovecraft: https://www.hauntedplaces.org/item/chestnut-hill-cemetery/\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
