        "text": "Spoilers beware.\n\nMy first review for October is, of course, widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films of all time: The Exorcist. With The Exorcist: Believer hitting cinemas this weekend, it’s a no-brainer to dive into what makes the 1973 original such a classic (and the fact that I’d never actually seen it played a big part as well). Having watched it, I now recognize why it became such a cultural milestone in the first place; The Exorcist is terrifying, even to this day. Despite originating the exorcism horror movie craze that still happens to this day, it still feels refreshingly original in so many way that I cannot wait to talk about.\n\nDirected by William Friedkin, the film follows actress Chris MacNeil and her daughter, Regan, as they temporarily leave in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. as Chris acts in a currently in-production film. After Father Lankester Merrin discovers a tome crafted in the likeness of a demon (given the name Pazuzu in later entries), the demon seemingly chooses Regan as his next victim and possesses her. Having nowhere else to turn, Chris is forced to reconcile in jaded Father Damien Karras in an attempt to save her daughter in the only remaining option: an exorcism."
