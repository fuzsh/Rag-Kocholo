One thing we learn right away: Emily Rose, a girl of 19, is dead, and her condition shakes the medical examiner who comes to visit. Emily, we discover, has died as the result of demonic possession… or six demonic possessions… or maybe none. Erin Bruner, a top-notch defense attorney, is assigned to defend the priest who exorcised Emily, Father Richard Moore, who stands accused of having cut off the girl from medical treatments she was undergoing. Father Moore is offered a plea deal, but rejects it, as he feels Emily’s story must be told. Hoping to make partner at her law firm, Erin is determined to follow her instincts, but between Father Moore’s compelling testimony and some very strange happenings in her own life, Erin starts to wonder if perhaps, against all odds, possession is real, and can be proven in a court of law.\n\nSPOILER-FREE GUEST BIO\n\nDavid Grimm is a Brooklyn-based award-winning playwright and screenwriter.
