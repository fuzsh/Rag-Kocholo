Not sure if anyone noticed or noted or even posted this before (if so, sorry), but I learned through the Exorcism Of Emily Rose audio commentary that the judge is played by none other than Mary Beth Hurt â€“ the wife of Paul Schrader, and in other words the voice of Pazuzu/CheChe in Dominion.

Also a funny coincidence that a man on the jury in that film looks very similar to Paul Schrader..
