        "text": "JASON THOMPSON's stint with the 76ers lasted less than a month.\n\nThe Lenape High, N.J., product, who was acquired on July 9 from Sacramento in the deal that netted the Sixers Nik Stauskas, was traded yesterday to the Golden State Warriors for forward Gerald Wallace, both teams announced.\n\nThompson, 29, averaged 6.1 points and 6.5 rebounds in 24.6 minutes last season for the only NBA team he had ever played for. He was drafted by Sacramento with the 12th overall pick of the 2008 draft. He was traded to the Sixers, along with Carl Landry and Nik Stauskas, on July 9.\n\nWallace, a 14-year veteran, has appeared in 832 career regular-season games, averaging 12 points, six rebounds, two assists and over one steal in 30 minutes per game. He has also appeared in 33 career playoff games.\n\nWallace has finished the season in the top 10 in steals per game five times and steal percentage four times during his career. Wallace also played for the Bobcats, Trail Blazers, Nets and Celtics. Just Monday, he was traded, along with Chris Babb, to Golden State in exchange for David Lee.\n\nThe Sixers also received an unspecified draft consideration in the deal, as well as cash, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Sixers also announced that they had signed second-round pick Richaun Holmes, a forward out of Bowling Green. Holmes appeared in all three games for the Sixers in the Utah Jazz Summer League, averaging 10 points and five rebounds in 17 minutes per game."
