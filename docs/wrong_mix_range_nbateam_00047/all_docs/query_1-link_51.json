        "text": "didn't know quite how to act when he arrived in Portland at the NBA trading deadline.\n\nPart of him was hurt that he was traded by Charlotte. And part of him was apprehensive, careful not to rock the boat of an already established Trail Blazers team.\n\nAll the while, he was being asked by coach Nate McMillan to change positions, from small forward to power forward, meaning he would have to match up against bigger players.\n\nHe was bashful and respectful inside the locker room. And\n\n, never going a day without a call or text from his ailing mother, who is battling a blood disease.\n\n3 Dallas vs. 6 Portland\n\nGame 1\n\n— Sat April 16, Portland\n\nat Dallas, 6:30 p.m., KGW (8/NBC) and ESPN\n\nGame 2\n\n— Tue April 19, Portland\n\nat Dallas, 6:30 p.m., KGW (8/NBC) and TNT\n\nGame 3\n\n— Thu April 21, Dallas\n\nat Portland, 7:30 p.m., KGW (8/NBC) and TNT\n\nGame 4\n\n— Sat April 23, Dallas\n\nat Portland, 2 p.m., KGW (8/NBC) and TNT\n\nGame 5\n\n* — Mon April 25, Portland\n\nat Dallas, TBD\n\nGame 6\n\n* — Thu April 28, Dallas\n\nat Portland, TBD\n\nGame 7\n\n* — Sat April 30, Portland\n\nat Dallas, TBD, KGW (8/NBC) and TNT\n\n* If necessary\n\nOn the court he was erratic, displaying more misses than makes, more hesitation than spunk.\n\nIt wasn't working.\n\nThen he came to a realization.\n\nHe needed to stop worrying about fitting in or offending people. He needed to be himself.\n\n\"Being myself is the reason they wanted me here,\" Wallace said. \"When I first came here, I was playing more tense, I really wasn't comfortable with everything.\"\n\nSo Gerald Wallace changed.\n\nAs a result, so too did the Trail Blazers, and their season.\n\nOn the court, Wallace has shown so much versatility, so much effort, and so much toughness that he has transformed the Blazers from a middling playoff team to one that has shown it can beat anybody.\n\nSince acquiring Wallace seven minutes before the Feb. 24 trading deadline, the Blazers went 15-8 with him in the lineup, beating every\n\nteam except New Orleans, a team they defeated a week before Wallace arrived.\n\nMuch of the Blazers' surge was keyed after Wallace changed his demeanor, both on and off the court. The changes came with an edge.\n\nHe has been prickly at times with the media, at times dismissing interviews, and\n\n. And he has been downright nasty to opponents, going at, and standing up to, anybody who dares cross his path.\n\n\"He's the real deal,\" McMillan said. \"He doesn't talk it. He doesn't walk it. But everybody knows he's not a guy you (mess) with.\"\n\nThat was never more apparent than when the Lakers' Ron Artest tried to push, prod and provoke Wallace and the Blazers out of their game in two late season meetings.\n\nBoth times, Wallace stood his ground. And both times, McMillan's heart might as well have swelled out of his shirt.\n\n\"Artest went after the biggest, baddest guy on our team and tried to intimidate him,\" McMillan said. \"And Wallace was having none of that. I mean, you are not going to punk this guy. That just ain't gonna happen.\"\n\nAdding toughness\n\nThe Blazers, long viewed as a finesse team filled with a bunch of nice young men, suddenly had a different persona.\n\nWith Wallace bullying defenders in the post – in the last meeting with Dallas he backed down Jason Kidd from 17 feet away until he had an easy layin – the Blazers have become a little more rugged. With Wallace ripping loose balls from the clutches of other players – like he did against Artest and Lamar Odom during a key moment in Los Angeles – they have become more scrappy. And with Wallace standing his ground -- as he did while taking a charge against a barreling Bynum -- the Blazers have become tougher.\n\nThese changes have come with some drastically different results.\n\nBefore acquiring Wallace, the Blazers were 8-19 against teams that made the NBA playoffs. With Wallace, they are 10-5 against playoff teams, including 6-2 against the top four teams in the West.\n\nTwo of those wins were against Dallas,\n\nin Game 1 of their best-of-seven, first-round playoff series.\n\nWallace doesn't want to hear how the Mavericks are the supposed underdog – that's why he walked out of Thursday's interview – and he doesn't want to make any bold predictions.\n\nHe just wants to be himself.\n\n\"That's my motivation – to be myself,\" Wallace said. \"I finally feel like I have become accustomed and comfortable here now. I feel like I'm in a pretty good groove.\"\n\nGood advice\n\nIt was his mama who told Wallace to never back down in life. Stand tall, she told him, and don't let anyone think they are better.\n\nWallace never had much trouble adhering to that advice. He said he was always the biggest kid not only in his neighborhood, but also in the entire small town of Childersburg, Ala.\n\nBut soon, as he became the national high school player of the year, and eventually a first-round pick of the Sacramento Kings, he found himself leaning on that advice.\n\nSo when Artest came a knockin' earlier this month, pushing, tangling, and baiting Wallace, he remembered his mom's words.\n\n\"My mom was always teaching me to stand up, always be proud of yourself, never let yourself feel low to anybody,\" Wallace said. \"You don't have to be a bully on the court, but don't let anyone push you around. She said 'Play with your heart.' And that's what I do, I play with my heart.\"\n\nHis effort and fearlessness are his trademarks, and explain why the Charlotte medical staff nicknamed him \"Crash.\" But Wallace has shown he is much more than muscle and guts.\n\nHe is so skilled and so versatile that McMillan has had him guard the likes of 7-footer Dirk Nowitzki while also assigning him to bring the ball up the court against the Lakers, where he would initiate a pick-and-roll offensive set with LaMarcus Aldridge.\n\n\"I'm still learning what I can do with Gerald,\" McMillan marveled. \"But I can tell you this: it's hard to keep him off the floor. As soon as I take him off the floor, I'm looking for him again. But we are still adding to what we think this guy can bring.\"\n\nExactly what those additions will be, McMillan will keep under wraps, a clear ploy at gamesmanship on the eve of Game 1. About the only thing for certain is that Wallace will start at small forward and likely play around 40 minutes a game throughout the series.\n\nFinding a role\n\nInterestingly, it was a home game against Dallas in March when McMillan began to seriously consider moving Wallace back to small forward.\n\n\"I put him on Nowitzki and saw he was small,\" McMillan said. \"Because I look at Gerald and I think he is this big guy, with this great body, and that he is strong. But matched up with Dirk and I saw the difference in the size. I knew then that I would eventually have to get a bigger lineup on the floor.\"\n\nAbout that time, Wallace began to flourish. There was the 40-point game at Oklahoma City, where he also held Kevin Durant without a field goal in the second half. There was the 29-point game at Utah. And in the win against the Lakers he had 19 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists and at least three standoffs with Artest.\n\n\"I went back to the tape of that Lakers game, and the number of times he and Artest got wrapped up, tangled up, was amazing,\" McMillan said. \"But he stood his ground.\n\n\"We haven't seen a lot of that around here.\"\n\n:"
