        "text": "Jay-Z’s dream has finally come true. For the first time in six years, the formerly New Jersey Nets are a playoff caliber team representing Brooklyn, New York. The Nets made many changes during this off-season. Not only did they change their home state/city, uniform, and logo, but they also made some colossal modifications to the roster.\n\nRe-signing Deron Williams was critical. Without him, this team would be nothing. He is the glue that holds the whole team together. Williams led the team last year with 21 points and 9 assists per game. He also set a franchise record scoring 57 points in one game!\n\nD-Will was extremely close to joining the Dallas Mavericks and teaming up with NBA champion Dirk Nowitzki. However, D-Will had a change of heart when Brooklyn’s aggressive management re-signed Gerald Wallace and acquired Joe Johnson.\n\nJohnson is incredibly versatile on the offensive end of the court. Last year in Atlanta, he averaged 18.8 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game. He also is an incredible shooter averaging two three-pointers a game and shot 39% from beyond the arc!\n\nThe Nets may perhaps have the best backcourt in the league. Johnson and Williams are elite players at their respective positions and the young and talented Marshon Brooks is a great asset to have coming off the bench. Brooklyn was also able to sign back-up point guard CJ Watson from the Chicago Bulls.\n\nWhile the Nets have secured a remarkable backcourt, they were also able to re-sign seven-foot-tall Brook Lopez and power forward Kris Humphries, a rebounding machine. This rounds out the top five when you include Gerald Wallace at the 3. Let’s take a look at the projected starters.\n\nPG Deron Williams SG Joe Johnson SF Gerald Wallace PF Kris Humphries C Brook Lopez\n\nLopez is primarily a scorer and is a great offensive presence for the Nets down low. He may not be the best defender or rebounder but Wallace helps make up for it as one of the best all around defenders in the league. And Kris Humphries is an absolute beast on the boards averaging 11 rebounds per game last season.\n\nWith Brooks, Watson, and newly acquired Reggie Evans coming off the bench, the Nets will be a force to be reckoned with in the Eastern Conference. With the two All-Stars in the backcourt, the Nets are capable of making a serious playoff run. They are one solid big man away from being championship contenders.\n\nThe Knicks might have a little competition this year. For the first time in NBA history, these two teams will be competing for the best team in the state. And the Nets home opener is against none other than the New York Knicks. Let the rivalry begin!\n\nJay-Z’s dream has finally come true. For the first time in six years, the formerly New Jersey Nets are a playoff caliber team representing Brooklyn, New York.
