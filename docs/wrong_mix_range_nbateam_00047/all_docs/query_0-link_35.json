        "text": "Gerald Wallace isn’t complaining. He isn’t offering a tale of woe. Let’s get that part straight.\n\nThe NBA veteran is simply admitting the obvious in response to direct questions and looking for ways to make things better in what is now a very trying and fluid situation with a Celtics team in makeover mode.\n\n“It’s hard,” Wallace said. “It’s like starting from scratch zero with this team and trying to figure out what direction they’re headed in and what pieces they’re going to put together. For me, I’ve already been through that situation. I was on an expansion team in Charlotte. I’ve established myself. To have to start all over on a team that’s starting from scratch is very difficult.”\n\nFor a guy in his 13th season, the fit seems difficult at best. Wallace, who arrived from the Nets in the offseason blockbuster trade that sent Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to Brooklyn, is still a good player and would probably be more in place as a complementary piece of a team looking to win now. And one could wonder what his long-term value is on a club building for the future.\n\nIn light of this, it’s not surprising to learn that the Celts have tried to discuss Wallace in trades, though with $10.1 million coming his way this season and the next two, the options are limited in this regard.\n\n“My thing about that is I don’t ask for trades,” Wallace said. “I don’t like to be traded. You know, once I get a place where I’m comfortable, I just want to know what’s expected of me and what my role is. For a guy that goes out and puts 110 percent of himself into it, you’re giving your all and you just want to know that. This is nothing against coach Brad (Stevens). Everyone has to figure out how we need to play with each other and how we can play together defensively and offensively to get the best out of each other.\n\n“The thing is, the season starts so fast. It’s more like learning on the job. It’s not like college where you have that time to get to work as a team and grow and understand and see your players. In fairness to coach Stevens, he’s having to watch during the season to figure out his rotations and what guys like to do and how they play. I mean, that’s tough because these games actually count.”\n\nFor the Celtics, the count is 0-4 heading into tonight’s game at the Garden against the Utah Jazz. The C’s have done well in stretches, but lack the cohesion to close out games — which is understandable to a large degree when you consider they are without injured floor leader Rajon Rondo and are still determining what combinations work best.\n\nWallace took one shot in 40 minutes in the season opener against the Toronto Raptors and not a single attempt in 28 minutes before leaving Monday’s loss to the Grizzlies in Memphis with a bruised knee. He had 14 points in a loss to the Milwaukee Bucks that saw the Celtics blow a 22-point lead and called out the team afterward for being selfish.\n\nThe comments were, according to Wallace, an attempt to take on the leadership role he’s been asked to perform.\n\n“Yeah, I think so,” he said. “I think the main thing is trying to help the guys and get them to understand the situation we’re in, what’s at hand for us and what it’s going to take for us to win in this league. I was told when I came here to be more of a leader. I can understand that, but my personality . . . I’m not an outspoken, outgoing, in-your-face kind of player. I kind of lead by example out on the court, going out and giving my all. I try to push my teammates to compete at the same level that I compete at. That’s the type of leadership I’ve always given and always done. Being in this situation is new for me in trying to be vocal and trying to speak to guys. I’m trying to do that to the best of my ability, but I’m still trying to see how to approach guys.\n\n“I’m out there and I’m trying to give my 110 percent, and at the same time I’m trying to figure out what I’m supposed to be doing and how I can do the most to help.”\n\nIt’s clear that Wallace, like his team, is searching for answers and a formula that will work.\n\n“The problem is trying to figure out my role within the team and the situation that I’m called for,” he said. “Last year I had trouble with that in Brooklyn, trying to figure out what was expected of me within the team. Now I come here and pretty much everybody’s looking to see what their role is going to work out to be, what style of play we want, what kind of team we want to be. And when you’re in a situation like that, for me, it’s very difficult at this point in my career.\n\n“But it doesn’t change how I approach this. I’m here to work. At the end of the day, we’re still playing basketball and I love this game. I love to play basketball, and when I’m out on the court I’m going to give 110 percent. I just want us to do well. Guys are getting frustrated. I think the main thing I’m saying is that if guys were more zoned in on what was being expected of them, we’d be OK.”\n\nThe problem is that may take a while with this team."
