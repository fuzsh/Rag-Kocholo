        "text": "Michael Jordan, especially early on his tenure as owner, was hands-on. He would make himself accessible to players. Occasionally, he even reminded them of why he’s, arguably, the greatest player of all time. Gerald Henderson: We were getting our ass kicked for about a week. I show up to the training room the next morning. I was a rookie so I had to get my stuff out of the way first and he’s already in there stretching and he’s got practice gear on. I said “What are you about to do, man?” He said “I’m gonna come up there and kick y’all ass.” He’s in there talking s–t for however long. He comes up there and he gets into our scrimmages. He jumped on our second team. Our first team had like Stephen Jackson, Gerald Wallace, Raymond Felton, and — who else started that year? — Boris Diaw. On our second team it was me, Derrick Brown, DJ Augustin, maybe Tyrus Thomasand somebody else. He looked like prime Michael Jordan, without the quickness and the jumping ability. But it was just all MJ work. Talking smack the whole time.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets will honor a pair of fan favorites during their 35th season. Baron Davis and Gerald Wallace will each be recognized as part of the franchise’s eight anniversary nights, the team announced Thursday. Davis’ moment in the spotlight comes first when the Hornets welcome the New York Knicks on Nov. 18, and Wallace is scheduled to get his recognition on Feb. 10 when the Hornets host Memphis. Each will have a halftime ceremony to celebrate and acknowledge their tenure in Charlotte and the first 5,000 fans entering Spectrum Center on each of those nights will receive commemorative posters of Davis and Wallace.\n\nStudents at Elvin Hill Elementary are learning all about making goals from basketball greats—not goals on the court, but in school and life. Childersburg native and former Alabama and NBA star Gerald Wallace visited the school on Wednesday, March 16 and spoke to Kara King’s fifth grade class about keeping promises. His main point was that hard work and effort will take a person further than talent alone ever will.\n\nAdam Morrison: So we used to have an unwritten rule in the league and most teams did it. If your team played each other in basketball or football it’s an automatic $100 bet. Gonzaga played Carolina in the Garden when I was, after my rookie year and we won. So I saw him at the Christmas party and I was ‘hey you owe me a 100 bucks.’ I was just kind of like joking and he’s like ‘oh yea, no problem’, but he pulled out a f—, I mean, this thing had to be like eight to 10 grand out of his, you know his pocket and he’s like ‘here you go.’ And then we are playing. We used to play cards on the plane… before all that crazy stuff in Washington went down. And we’d play booray and then we would play Texas Hold ’em and Mike, he barely flew with us ’cause like I sad, he wasn’t the GM – wasn’t the owner, he was a minority owner then but he flew with us on one of the road trips.\n\nAdam Morrison: And somebody asked him like ‘hey do you want to play cards with us?’ He was like sure but then we were like, alright, you can’t bring like $50,000 and just bet everybody off every hand. We’re gonna cap it like $1,000 bet max. So him and Gerald Wallace were in a hand… There was like a straight draw flush draw on the flop and you can tell Mike was drawn to something. Gerald bet $300 into him and Mike literally goes ‘$300? I’d watch two monkeys f— for $300.’ Everybody was laughing… He was always cool."
