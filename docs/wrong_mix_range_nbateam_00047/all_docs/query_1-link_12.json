        "text": "Gerald “Jerry” Eugene Wallace\n\nSeptember 7, 1932 ~ March 14, 2016\n\nJerry passed away in Mesa, AZ on March 14, 2016 with his loving children by his side at the age of 83. He was born on September 7, 1932, in Ogden, Utah, to Eugene Wallace and Mabel Patterson.\n\nJerry was raised in Clinton, UT and spent most of his life helping tend to the Wallace family farm. He also worked at Defense Depot Ogden for 30 years before retiring in 1993. Jerry enjoyed escaping the cold and snow of Utah by spending his winters in sunny Arizona, where his kids would often come to visit. He was an avid sports fan, and also enjoyed participating in various sports as both a player and coach. Many of his most cherished memories came from his time spent coaching basketball, softball and volleyball teams. He enjoyed teaching players the skills and fundamentals of the games, and especially enjoyed imparting to them the value of teamwork, honor and good sportsmanship. As his children grew into adulthood they would realize how important those values are in almost all aspects of life. They will always be thankful for the perspective and guidance his teachings continue to provide.\n\nAbove all, Jerry loved his family and nothing meant more to him or made him more proud than his kids did. Likewise, nothing made them more proud than being blessed with having him as their father.\n\nJerry is survived by his four children, Rick (Jo Ann) Wallace, Linda Wallace (Vance Murphy), Scott (Linda) Wallace, and Lisa (Doug) Dilley, as well as 7 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents and one sister, Mary Lou Wallace. He was married to Alta Kendall (divorced), Lou Ann Young (deceased), and Joanie Barker (deceased).\n\nFuneral services will be held on Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 11 a.m. at Lindquist’s Ogden Mortuary, 3408 Washington Blvd. The family will welcome those wishing to pay their respects on Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. and Tuesday from 9:45 to 10:45 a.m. at the mortuary. Interment, Ogden City Cemetery.\n\nFor the many friends and family who knew and loved him, Jerry will be remembered as a man of the highest integrity who had an absolute love of life. He lived his life to the fullest and left this world with no regrets. While we are deeply saddened by his passing and will miss him dearly each and every day, we know he is in a much better place. Thanks for being our Dad!"
