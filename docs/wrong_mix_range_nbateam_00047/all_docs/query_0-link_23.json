        "text": "Danny Dukker@ DannyDukkerCorrespondent II\n\nNBA Trade Rumors: 10 Teams Gerald Wallace Would Fit Best On\n\n0 of 10\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nGerald Wallace finds himself the subject of the typical All-Star Break Trade Rumor Squad (say that three times fast).\n\nIt seems as though every year the All-Star break puts the idea into everyone's head that no player is safe and that everyone is going to be traded. Well, in that spirit I have decided to give Charlotte fans a reason to panic.\n\nWhy don't we talk about where Wallace could find himself this year?\n\n10. Denver Nuggets\n\n1 of 10\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed\n\nPossible Targets: Carmelo Anthony\n\nThe way the 'Melo situation is going, I figure it really does not make a difference as to what team is in the trade rumors.\n\nIn many ways, it is possible to see the Bobcats making a play for him. In other ways, it is one of the dumbest ideas one could think of.\n\nEither way, it is worth mentioning simply because of how weird the whole experience has been.\n\n9. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n2 of 10\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed\n\nPossible Targets: Picks, J.J. Hickson\n\nI'll admit that this trade looks really good on paper, but something is keeping me from putting it any higher.\n\nFirst of all, Wallace wants to play for a winner by all accounts. Cleveland and winning are polar opposites of each other.\n\nWith or without Wallace, the Cavs will lose games and Wallace will not be any happier if he is on their roster. That is why I simply believe that this trade will never happen, because of Wallace protesting it to the point where they have to turn it down.\n\nCleveland will log one of the worst NBA seasons in recent memory and Wallace will not soothe the pain by any means.\n\n8. Sacramento Kings\n\n3 of 10\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Selected role player(s)\n\nPossible Targets: Picks, Donte Greene, Omri Casspi\n\nThis trade could be great for both sides, considering neither team seems to have any clue as to what to do with this NBA season.\n\nThe Kings are trying to find a identity and maybe they can solve some of their problems by getting Wallace.\n\nI am not suggesting specific trades, but I am throwing out ideas and letting you think this through. I am one fan and, hopefully, if this is popular, you are many.\n\nThis trade could really be very nice for Sacramento and could give the Kings a better second half to the season and set up a great year ahead.\n\nThe Bobcats will get some great young talent and hopefully, if things go right, they will receive some picks.\n\n7. Utah Jazz\n\n4 of 10\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed\n\nPossible Targets: Picks, Paul Millsap\n\nYou will notice that almost all of my team choices have draft picks to spare. That is no coincidence; the Bobcats need a new identity and young raw talent with potential.\n\nThis trade would essentially be a swap of players and make the Jazz almost instant contenders. Wallace would compensate for their poor rebounding and even score some points with his hustle and athleticism.\n\nHe will also be playing on a winning team that would stand right by him.\n\nHe also plays the almost stereotypical Jerry Sloan ball, hustling for rebounds, playing defense and working hard.\n\nThis would make the Jazz a great team to watch.\n\n6. Washington Wizards\n\n5 of 10\n\nChris Trotman/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed\n\nPossible Targets: Picks, Andray Blatche\n\nSomething is not working for this Wizards team and, yet again, it is Gerald Wallace to the rescue.\n\nHis speed and athleticism will fit in great with this young and fast team, and he should quickly build chemistry with the young John Wall.\n\nWhile the current season has been a disappointment for the Wizards, it is hopefully going to be something to build off.\n\nOr, more specifically, something which would show them how to not play ball.\n\nNonetheless, this would be a simple trade and more players can be added, but at this point I think maybe the Wizards don't want to complicate things too much by getting a whole new squad.\n\n5. New York Knicks\n\n6 of 10\n\nChris Trotman/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed\n\nPossible Targets: Spike Lee, Wilson Chandler, picks\n\nThis trade is more basic and, in many ways, less complicated than some others.\n\nHowever, I do believe the Knicks want to make some moves, and with the way Chandler has played recently, one has to wonder if he will stay on the team long.\n\nOther trades could work here, but the main reason for the Knicks being here is because I think they want a guy like Wallace for his all-around game, and they are looking for moves to make.\n\nYou just never know with the Knicks.\n\n4. New Jersey Nets\n\n7 of 10\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed\n\nPossible Targets: Draft picks, money, Travis Outlaw, Devin Harris\n\nThe Nets are going to move somebody somewhere. That is a no-brainer.\n\nTheir current roster is completely useless and they need a player who is skilled on both sides of the ball and is young enough to stay for multiple years. Here is where Wallace comes in.\n\nThe Bobcats can acquire some first round picks, which should be higher in the lottery. If they want they can also make a play for Devin Harris, but I highly doubt that simply because of the upcoming draft and because they might move other players.\n\n3. Dallas Mavericks\n\n8 of 10\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not Needed\n\nPossible Targets: Shawn Marion, Role player\n\nSurprised? Don't be.\n\nThe Mavericks are looking for pieces which could possibly make them real contenders this season, and Gerald Wallace would be a great addition to the roster.\n\nShawn Marion has not been a consistent performer and a player of Wallace's level can provide a great boost to the Mavericks on both ends of the court.\n\nIf the Bobcats make up their mind to trade him, they could receive Marion and a role player of their choice from the Mavsâ€”a guy like Peja Stojakovic or Brian Cardinal.\n\nIf they are really good at bargaining, they could try to get some draft picks, which will probably be top priority considering this season has been a complete bust.\n\n2. Phoenix Suns\n\n9 of 10\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: Not needed/minor player\n\nPossible Targets: Steve Nash, Vince Carter, picks\n\nSpeaking from a perspective of a loyal Phoenix fan, I must say this trade makes too much sense not to occur.\n\nThe season has been an up-and-down roller coaster for the Suns, and they need something to spark them. Gerald Wallace would be a perfect candidate.\n\nThe only reason it is not No. 1 is because Nash is up there in years, and if they could land Vince Carter, that would not solve much either.\n\nWallace would also become less effective if he doesn't have Nash on the floor with him.\n\n1. Philadelphia 76ers\n\n10 of 10\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nComplementary Trade Pieces: D.J. Augustin/ minor player\n\nPossible Targets: Andre Iguodala, picks, Evan Turner\n\nIt would be nearly impossible for me to find a more perfect trade available in the entire NBA than the one laid out here.\n\nThe Bobcats need some bigger and faster guys: Iggy more or less replaces Wallace and Turner makes up for the rest.\n\nD.J. is a big loss, but some picks could soften the deal a little.\n\nAgain, this trade still needs more players, and this is in no way a final draft: I am simply writing that this trade seems like it works in its basic form.\n\nWell, thanks for reading and please comment down below on your thoughts. Mess around with some ideas and see what trades you can come up with!\n\nX"
