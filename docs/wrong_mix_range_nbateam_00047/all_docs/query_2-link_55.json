        "text": "Golden State Warriors Trade Gerald Wallace to the Philadelphia 76ers for Jason Thompson\n\nOn July 31st, 2015, the Philadelphia 76ers traded forward-center Jason Thompson to the Golden State Warriors for forward Gerald Wallace and cash considerations. (The 76ers also received swap rights. They could move lesser of first round picks from the Miami Heat and Oklahoma City Thunder for the Warriors’ 2016 first round pick).\n\nJason Thompson became a member of the Philadelphia 76ers in early July when he was traded by the Sacramento Kings. A local product from south New Jersey, Thompson’s homecoming was short as he was moved to the Golden State Warriors almost three weeks after the Kings-76ers trade. Thompson was dealt for Gerald Wallace who had also recently been traded to Golden State from the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe purpose of the trade was purely for contractual reasons. The Warriors were trying to cut their luxury tax bill. By trading David Lee for Wallace and then subsequently dealing Wallace for Thompson, the Warriors dropped that salary slot from $15.5 million to $6.9 million. The luxury tax savings were estimated to be around $14 million for the Warriors.\n\nWallace had an expiring deal worth about $10.1 million while Thompson’s contract ran through the 2016-17 season at $6.9 million ($2.65 million guaranteed). As part of the deal, the Warriors sent the 76ers $1 million in cash considerations.\n\nAfter the trade, The 76ers waived Gerald Wallace before 2015 training camp. Golden State had a deep frontcourt rotation with Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, Harrison Barnes, Festus Ezeli and Marreese Speights all ahead of Thompson on the depth chart. Thompson had a bit role for the Warriors. He appeared in 28 games (one start) before he was waived.\n\nThe Warriors had decided to pursue veteran center Anderson Varejao on the buyout market and needed to clear a roster spot to sign the center. Thompson was the odd man out. He finished his brief Warriors tenure averaging 2.1 PPG, 1.9 RPG and 0.7 APG in 6.4 MPG. The Warriors waived Thompson using the stretch provision. Thompson’s guarantee of $2.65 million was spread through three seasons at nearly $900,000.\n\nIn the trade, the 76ers received the right to swap the lesser of their two first rounders from the Miami Heat and Oklahoma City Thunder with the first round pick that the Warriors owned in the 2016 NBA Draft. Miami’s pick was top-10 protected in 2016 and unprotected in 2017. The Thunder’s future pick was top-15 protected the first two years and would transform into two second round picks in 2017 and 2018.\n\nSince Golden State finished with the top record in the NBA during the 2015-16 season, the Sixers never made the move to swap picks.\n\nJason Thompson on the shock of being traded twice in a quick amount of time (via The Press of Atlantic City):\n\n“It’s definitely a bittersweet situation. I was traded to a team I grew up watching in Philly, and I didn’t play a game with them. Then suddenly I was coming to an organization coming off a title. I was definitely in shock.”\n\nOn joining a team coming off of a championship:\n\n“I haven’t been around much winning these past seven years. Just a lot of instability, with seven coaches in seven years, 180 teammates and things like that. That doesn’t ever lead to winning, so to come to an organization that has won and is coming off a championship, it’s definitely great for myself.”\n\nOn his role:\n\n“That’s for coach (Steve) Kerr to decide and me to go with it, but it’s a little different approach when a team comes off winning a championship. But I’m probably going to be smiling more. This is a championship team, and talking to the guys, I know it wasn’t easy to make it happen, and I know it’s even harder to repeat. I’m going to do everything in my power to be a great locker room guy and find ways to produce for the team offensively and defensively.”\n\nOn his time in Sacramento:\n\n“I built a lot of relationships there with the fans, and they were real loyal to a guy coming out of New Jersey and they welcomed me with open arms. There are a lot of memories. I wish they were better memories with wins and stuff, but I’m sure, going to play in Sac twice, there are going to be a lot of emotions.”\n\nGolden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers on acquiring Thompson (via Warriors.com):\n\n“We’re very happy to add Jason to our roster. He has a proven track record in this league and adds considerably to our team’s depth, which was a big key to our success last season and will be moving forward.”\n\nRelated Tweets:\n\nImage via Getty Images/David Liam Kyle"
