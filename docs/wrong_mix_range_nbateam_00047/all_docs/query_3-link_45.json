        "text": "I've reopened the thread as I received the following PM that indicates there are those who still want to discuss this...\n\nShowtime said:\n\nOK, let's clear this up once and for all. According to the rules of the expansion draft, a team cannot protect an UNRESTRICTED free agent.\n\nAccording to this report, the deadline for reporting the list of protected players for a team was June 11th, 2004.\n\nAccording to this report, Peeler had an option for another season with the Kings, but he opted out of that additional year and was not a free agent until July 1st.\n\nSo let's look at this timeline:\n\nMay 2004 - Kings lose in the playoffs. Their season is over.\n\nJune 11th - the deadline for protected players to be reported.\n\nJuly 1st - Peeler becomes a free agent after opting out.\n\nJuly 29th - Peeler signs with Washington.\n\nSo while unrestricted free agents cannot be protected, Peeler was not a free agent until July 1st, well after the deadline to protect players. He was eligible for protection according to this timeline unless you can give me the exact protected list.\n\nMy memory of the exact details is not clear, so hopefully one of the several people who explained the whole thing before will be willing to do so again.\n\nSource? I remember looking it up a few years back. I believe these were the protected players:\n\nBibby\n\nChristie\n\nPeja\n\nWebber\n\nVlade\n\nBobby\n\nMiller\n\nPeeler\n\nI've explained this many many times. I can do it quick and dirty now:\n\nExpansion rules were:\n\na) can protect UP TO 8 players on your roster (but not free agents -- have to be under contract for next season)\n\nb) BUT have to expose at least 1 player\n\nso if you had 12 guys under contract, you could only protect 8. And if you had LESS than 8 guys under contract, you still had to leave 1 player unprotected. Every team always had to leave 1.\n\nOur problem was that we screwed up on Peeler's contact, and so did not have anybody we considered expendable to offer up. But we still had to offer up 1 player regardless, so we chose Gerald.\n\nwe had these players under contract:\n\nBibby\n\nChristie\n\nPeja\n\nWebber\n\nVlade\n\nBobby\n\nMiller\n\nGerald\n\nBut rule b) said that we always had to expose 1. That was how we lost Gerald. If Peeler had also been under contract and not a free agent, we could have exposed him instead.\n\nI've explained this many many times.

Players like Peeler would have been very aware of the expansion draft and as such, I very much doubt they would have agreed to sign on for 2 years without having the option on the second year.\n\nI know if I was in Peeler's position I wouldn't have signed with anyone for 2 years because I would have liked to have some control of where I am going. And if I was to sign for 2 years I would want that second year to be a player option or no deal from my perspective.\n\nPlayers like to have some control of their destiny (as we all do) and no one really wants to play for an expansion franchise if you are good enough to play for someone else.\n\nThere is no doubt we stuffed up with leaving Wallace exposed, but we can't blame it on Peeler. We could have just as easily signed a borderline scrub to 2 year, partially guaranteed deal and leave them exposed for the draft because that player would play anywhere in the NBA. While Peeler was past his best, he still had options to play for teams better than the Bobcats.\n\nWhile I agree with the majority of this, we conviniently seem to forget that players need to agree to the terms of the deal before they sign the contract.

It could be a guy like Hilton or just a scrub off the waiver wire just to have a warm body to offer when this hit.....\n\nWhile I agree with the majority of this, we conviniently seem to forget that players need to agree to the terms of the deal before they sign the contract.

Only an idiot would lose Gerald over Anthony Peeler. You sign somebody else, you make a small midseason trade. You prepare if you know what you had. Our problem was that we didn't.\n\nI agree with Brick on planning ahead.\n\nBut disagree with anyone who says we should have left Webber exposed. Sure, it was likely that an expansion team would have shied away from such a big contract (I believe expansion teams have a diminished salary cap their first season or two). However, if one of them had taken Webber either for his talent, to sell tickets or to trade once he was eligible, it would have been a nightmare for us. Our window to contend would have shut instantly. We would have been a laughing stock for giving away a superstar for nothing. Fans would have been incensed. Imagine the PR nightmare of trying to explain to the average fan why you just became irrelevant, so you could protect a young player who got 0 PT and had a questionable work ethic. I liked Wallace. I wanted us to keep him. But leaving Webber or any other important rotation player on a contending team exposed in the expansion draft would have been lunacy.\n\nI agree with Brick on planning ahead.\n\nBut disagree with anyone who says we should have left Webber exposed.

But leaving Webber or any other important rotation player on a contending team exposed in the expansion draft would have been lunacy.\n\nI made a post about this a long time ago and am not about to go digging it up. But here is some info:\n\nThey were limited to 66% of the salary cap and were required to take 14 players. The salary cap was $43.9 mil, meaning the Bobcats could only spend $29 mil (rounded up slightly). With Webber making $17.53 mil alone that season, that would mean the other 13 players would have to earn, at most, an average of $880,000 each.\n\nHere are the players available for them to draft with salaries:\n\nhttp://hoopshype.com/expansion_draft.htm\n\nThere are enough players with salaries lower than $880 k for them to select 13 and stay under their cap, and I know that selecting a few lower than $880 k would allow them to select a few with salaries above $880 k, but look at the names available in that price range. And although better players were available, the Bobcats limited their spending to about $22 mil (and IIRC publically stated they were \"going cheap\" the first couple years). If they were intent on staying below $22 mil, that would mean with Webber they could only spend $344 k per additional player, not possible according to that list.\n\nHad the Kings put Webber out there as available and he been taken, yes it would have been a disaster to the franchise at the time. In retrospect, the draft was \"post-injury\" and if we knew then what we know now (and we obviously suspected it given the seriousness of the injury) about his rehab and condition of the knee, taking Webber's salary off the books at that time would have been a blessing and negated the need for \"the trade\".\n\nWe clearly have different memories of Wallace's time in Sacramento.\n\nI always liked Gerald Wallace, but I remember what 21 remembers. It was crystal clear after the Dallas game that Peja was suspended for (remember his assault on a referee that totally warranted a one-game suspension? ). Gerald played one hell of a game, the best of his career to that point, but he came out late in the game because of what appeared to be a minor injury, and never went back in. The grumblings from the media and people close to the team were that he and Adelman had a difference over the seriousness of his injury, and that this was another indication that he wasn't ready to be a regular contributor. I'm sure I'm missing some details, as this was six years ago now, but that was the big thing that showed how far away he was from EVER cracking Adelman's rotation. There were also reports that he didn't practice hard, that he wasn't working on his jumpshot -- which automatically hurts your stock on a team run by Rick Adelman and Geoff Petrie, and other stuff like that.\n\nI think the best thing that ever happened to Gerald Wallace was going to the Bobcats. His game completely flourished the minute he left here, and he might not have been in the rotation for us until at least the 2006-07 season, when Adelman was gone. I wish we could have held on to him, but that's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes. Not sure he would have become such a good player here. And even if he did, he's not the special kind of player that takes a team to the next level, so we'd still have been bad even with him."
