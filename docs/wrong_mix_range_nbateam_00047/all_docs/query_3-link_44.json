        "text": "GERALD_WALLACE_DIVE_CHARLOTTE_BOBCATS.JPG\n\nBoston Celtics small forward Gerald Wallace (45) falls on top of Charlotte Bobcats point guard Kemba Walker (15) as they wrestle for control of a ball during the second half of an NBA basketball game in Charlotte, N.C., Monday, Nov. 25, 2013. The Celtics won 96-86.\n\n(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nCertain guys get a free pass. I don't know exactly why, but they do. For example, take Charles Barkley. He can essentially say whatever he wants with no backlash. He can call his producer an extremely offensive word on air yet remain employed the next day. He can criticize whatever he wants, and everybody still loves him. I get it, too. How can you not appreciate Charles Barkley? He screw up sometimes, but then again so does everyone. Barkley seems like a funny, good-natured, honest guy who speaks his mind.\n\nSo does Gerald Wallace. If you read Wallace's comments in the newspaper, or on the internet, you might think of him as the Master of Crankiness, an Oscar the Grouch type who should live in a trash can and probably inspires hatred in everyone around him. But Wallace playfully calls Jeff Green \"Jeffrey\" and thoroughly enjoys photo-bombing his teammates. He occasionally pretends to be a reporter in media scrums and he has a room in his house dedicated to David Ortiz, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick memorabilia. Wallace says he only reads what comes across the television screen while he's playing XBox.\n\nThe small forward has so many markings of a fan favorite. He chases after loose balls with reckless abandon and he runs hard enough through screens that he long ago earned the nickname Crash. He played for weeks on a torn meniscus, just like he played all season with bone spurs in his ankle. After an MRI revealed the former injury, head coach Brad Stevens said, \"I feel bad for him, because Gerald is as warrior as they get.\"\n\nHe's as warrior as they get! So much about Wallace should be encouraging love from the TD Garden crowd. But instead the feelings about him are complicated.\n\nIll will started when Wallace didn't seem very enthusiastic about joining the Celtics this summer. One can understand his angst at joining a rebuilding organization during his 13th season, at a time when he would rather chase his first championship. He wasn't exactly contending for a title in Brooklyn, but at least he got to play games that mattered. He was traded to a team that didn't want him. The Celtics would have dealt him away the second anyone showed interest (and still would). And they always promised to lose plenty of games, as they have.\n\nWallace went missing during the offseason. Just before training camp started, president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said he hadn't talked to the veteran at all since trading for him. When media day arrived, Wallace had to explain himself. He said he was happy in Boston, a place he's \"always loved,\" and simply spent the summer with family. But he didn't hide that rebuilding turned him off.\n\n\"You kind of sit down and look at yourself and wonder what happened,\" he said of the trade. \"Is there something I could have done better to stay?\"\n\nFurther turning Boston against Wallace before he played a single game with the Celtics: his contract, which Bill Simmons recently rated the NBA's second-worst. Despite having hardly any offensive game left in his breaking-down body, Wallace will make a little more than $10 million in each of the next two seasons. His deal makes him basically unmovable. Like it or not (surely the latter), he might be the one player most likely to remain with the Celtics next season. Which sounds absurd, given how replaceable most of his remaining talents are. But that's the way the NBA works.\n\nTo further understand why some Bostonians dislike Gerald Wallace, one must discuss his harsh opinions on the state of his team. In mid-October, he complained that the Celtics were \"out there being selfish,\" \"just going through the motions, it seems like, without effort,\" and failing to \"(come) out wanting to win and get better.\"\n\n\"We had some good spurts, but when it came down to it, they were determined to win the game,\" he said. \"And we weren’t.\"\n\nAnd that was after a preseason game. A few weeks later, Wallace got fined for his answer to a question about effort level in a blowout loss to the Rockets.\n\n\"I don’t know what the fu-- (the loss) was,\" he said, \"just to be honest with you.\"\n\n“It was bad because you see it and you want to help, and you try to tell the guys what’s going on in the situation,” he added. “I think it’s just the fact that they’re not getting it. You look up at the scoreboard and you’re getting your butts kicked every night. And these are pretty good teams that take advantage of that situation. We’ve got to understand, this is a long season. We’re only (12 games) into the season. We’ve got about 60 more of these. If you’re going to look up and you’re down 30 or you’re giving up 40 points in the first quarter for the next 60 games, that’s going to be a long season. Sh--.”\n\nMany observers took Wallace for a malcontent because he never had much nice to say after bad losses. But his teammates never took offense to the comments because A) he was mostly just blowing off steam after losses, and B) though some of his quotes sound like he's ready to maim someone, he never seems genuinely bothered by anything. It's like he just leans back in his chair, mumbles a series of harsh words about a defeat, and then goes back home and forgets about everything except XBox. (Note: He said he never plays basketball games on XBox because he spends enough time thinking about basketball at work.) By the time he arrived at practice the next day, he'd inevitably be goofing around again.\n\nAt some point, Wallace embraced the Celtics. After he decided to undergo season-ending surgeries on his ankle and knee, he reflected on a season he enjoyed more than he expected to.\n\n\"I talked to Danny (Ainge). I had a great conversation with Danny at the beginning of the season about the role he wanted me to play on this team, the things that he wanted me to do, the experience and the leadership that he wanted me to bring to this locker room,\" Wallace said. \"And once you get around these guys, basketball is basketball. It brings out the fun in you. And these guys make it that much more easier. Being around those guys, (who are) willing to listen and just having fun this season.\"\n\n\"The experience has been fun,\" Wallace added. \"Losing sucks. It always does. I feel like we're a lot better than what our record shows. We've had some ups and downs, some learning curves, not only from the players, but from the coaching staff as well. Everybody learning everybody was an adjustment. But I think, for the most part, it's been a great season.\"\n\nWallace remains overpaid. He can't shoot very well and he doesn't shoot very often. His presence on the floor suffocates spacing. A career 71 percent free throw shooter, he somehow hit just 46.5 percent this season. According to Basketball-Reference.com, he finished 2013-14 with the 39th-worst turnover rate ever among players with at least 1,400 minutes in a season.\n\nBut next season, when Wallace inevitably mouths off after the first lopsided loss, I say we give him a free pass. You don't have to like that he's on the Celtics or costs so much. Feel free to wish he would keep his harsh commentary to himself. But keep in mind that he catapulted himself after loose balls and played through all sorts of pain. Despite all the critical sound bites, he has a way of making his teammates smile behind the scenes. His quotes after games often sound cranky, but I believe him when he says he's anything but."
