        "text": "After a laying dormant in free agency for the first week or so, the Boston Celtics are finally making some moves to ensure they get back to the postseason next year. They were surprise contenders this past season and that has inspired the front office to get the pieces they need to get back to the playoffs and make it out of the first-round.\n\nOne of those moves was made on Tuesday when the Celtics pulled off a trade for David Lee.\n\nAccording to Marc Stein from ESPN.com, the Celtics have agreed to trade Gerald Wallace to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for David Lee.\n\nAlmost as soon as the Warriors won the NBA Finals, Lee was asking for a trade out of town. Maybe it was that championship hangover or maybe the Dubs are just that nice, but they worked with Lee to find him a place where he could contend for a title but also have a bigger role than he had in Golden State.\n\nThat place is apparently Boston."
