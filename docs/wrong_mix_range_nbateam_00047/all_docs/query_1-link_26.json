I like learning about all the revolutionaties that helped free Mexico on the way to liberty.\n\nHow I found my friends? I moved to the classroom, and they welcomed me. I was always pretending, now I can just be myself.\n\nWhen I was in the other school, I was so behind in my reading. I went up from a 1st grade level two years ago, to a 4th grade reading level.\n\nBefore I came to Wallace, I was a student who got fairly bad grades. I needed to get my grades up if I wanted to keep playing the sport I played. So my mom brought me to Wallace and now I'm getting As and Bs.\n\nI want keep my grades up so I can get the job I want when I'm older. I want to be a veterinarian.\n\nAltruismo house forces me to get outside of my comfort zone and become friends with people I wouldn't have talked to beforeâ€”and they're a really good person, and I should have talked to them before.\n\nThe community is really nice, you make a lot of friends here; there is really no drama. They're really understanding here and I feel at home and comfortable."
