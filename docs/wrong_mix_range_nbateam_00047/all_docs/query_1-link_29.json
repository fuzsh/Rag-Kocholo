        "text": "Gerald ‘Jerry’ David Connelly, 66, of Orem, passed away Friday, May 24, 2024. He was born May 23, 1958, in Provo, Utah, to Wallace D Connelly and Vivian Long Connelly. He married the love of his life, Merlene Rowley, on January 13, 1978.\n\nAs a teenager, Jerry began his lifelong career at Connelly Heating & Air Conditioning, a family business started by his father. He worked alongside his two brothers, nephews, and son. After a three-year battle with cancer, Jerry was forced to retire against his wishes. He truly loved his job and being able to work alongside his partner in crime, Craig. The dad and son duo enjoyed fishing breaks, pranks, and truck naps.\n\nJerry and Merlene started their family early and after nine months of marriage, they welcomed twins, Craig and Christin. After two years of marriage, they built their home of 46 years in Orem. While there, they welcomed two more daughters, Michelle (Shelly) and Jenni. Everyone that knew Jerry knows that his family was his number one priority. Their home was filled with love and laughter simply because Jerry and Merlene’s love made their house a home.\n\nJerry’s devotion to his wife was an example to us all. He adored Merlene and would never miss a chance to open her door, tell her how beautiful she was, or kiss her. He truly found it an honor to be her husband and made her his top priority always.\n\nNo one could pack an ice chest and load up fishing gear faster than Jerry. His perfect day would consist of fishing in Alaska, hunting with family members, pulling pranks, teasing his kids and grandkids, and taking any chance he could to head up to the family cabin in Diamond Fork Canyon. Taking a grandchild on a side-by-side ride or walking to the pond to feed the fish was something he would never turn down. You could always expect him to have a project at the cabin and would gather his kids and grandkids to work and make the property their happy place.\n\nHe would never admit it but Jerry was a very selfless and charitable man. Over the years, many groceries were purchased for individuals struggling. He loved slipping an envelope of money to those suffering and passed from this earth with a heart of gold. He loved to joke with his children to be good for a change as they left the house. With what once started as a joke, his family took as a literal example of who their dad was and the good he offered others. Let’s all be good for a change!\n\nUntil his last day, Jerry was a man of endurance and strength. His love for his family, positivity, and appreciation for life’s simple things is what gave him the extra time with his family as he battled through cancer. Words cannot describe how much this wonderful man will be missed.\n\nJerry is survived by his wife Merlene and four children: Christin (Jason) Meyer of Springville, Utah; Craig (Jan) Connelly of Saratoga Springs, Utah; Michelle (Dan) Knowlden of Spanish Fork, Utah; Jenni (Clint) Peterson of Spanish Fork, Utah; 13 grandchildren (Harlie, Dakota, Griffin, Kansis, Cache, Gage, Austyn, Jett, Bren, Charli, Ryan, Trace, Tripp), and two bonus grandchildren by marriage Jaynee (Dakota) and Bailey (Harlie). He is also survived by two brothers John (Galina) Connelly of Provo, Utah; Dan Connelly of Provo, Utah; and one sister, Kathleen (Chris) Brittain of Provo, Utah. Jerry was preceded in death by his father and mother, Wally and Vivian, and sister in law, Georgia Connelly.\n\nTo honor his wishes, a celebration of life for all that knew Jerry, will be held Wednesday, May 29, from 6 to 8 p.m. at Westmore Park, 1050 South Main Street in Orem. Parking can be found on the west side of the park at 150 West or in the Westmore Elementary School parking lot. This casual get together will allow everyone to come celebrate, share memories, visit with each other, and honor Jerry.\n\nA graveside service for friends, family and neighbors will be held Thursday, May 30, at 11 a.m. at the Orem City Cemetery located at 1520 North 800 East.\n\nCondolences may be expressed to the family on this page."
