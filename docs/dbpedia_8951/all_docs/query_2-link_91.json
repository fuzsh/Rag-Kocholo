        "text": "Recommended for unvaccinated travelers one year old or older going to Algeria.\n\nInfants 6 to 11 months old should also be vaccinated against Hepatitis A. The dose does not count toward the routine 2-dose series.\n\nTravelers allergic to a vaccine component should receive a single dose of immune globulin, which provides effective protection for up to 2 months depending on dosage given.\n\nUnvaccinated travelers who are over 40 years old, immunocompromised, or have chronic medical conditions planning to depart to a risk area in less than 2 weeks should get the initial dose of vaccine and at the same appointment receive immune globulin.\n\nCases of measles are on the rise worldwide. Travelers are at risk of measles if they have not been fully vaccinated at least two weeks prior to departure, or have not had measles in the past, and travel internationally to areas where measles is spreading.\n\nAll international travelers should be fully vaccinated against measles with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants 6–11 months, according to CDC’s measles vaccination recommendations for international travel.\n\nIn Algeria poliovirus has been identified in the past year.\n\nTravelers to Algeria are at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus.\n\nVaccine recommendations: Adults traveling to Algeria who received a complete polio vaccination series as children may receive a single lifetime booster dose of inactivated polio vaccine; travelers who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated should receive a complete polio vaccination series before travel. Children who are not fully vaccinated will be considered for an accelerated vaccination schedule.\n\nDogs infected with rabies are commonly found in Algeria.\n\nIf rabies exposures occur while in Algeria, rabies vaccines may only be available in larger suburban/urban medical facilities.\n\nRabies pre-exposure vaccination considerations include whether travelers 1) will be performing occupational or recreational activities that increase risk for exposure to potentially rabid animals and 2) might have difficulty getting prompt access to safe post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether you should receive pre-exposure vaccination before travel.\n\nFor more information, see country rabies status assessments."
