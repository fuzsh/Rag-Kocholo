In addition to regular meetings of joint working groups, it encompasses additional activities such as:\n\nThe EU regional project \"Training and Information Course on Euro-Arab diplomacy\" (El-Hiwar/”Dialogue” in Arabic) strives to facilitate the flow of information and to promote dialogue and cooperation between officials from both organisations. Its third phase launched in March 2023 will finance series of workshops, seminars, study visits and policy papers identified by the experts of the EU-LAS Working Groups, e.g. a study visit on EU Migration and asylum policy (September 2023), online workshop on Green Transition and Climate Change (November 2023) and training of trainers in human rights.\n\nWithin the scope of El-Hiwar project, College of Europe organises a yearly summer school for young professionals. The last one tool place in July 2022. The summer school targets agents of change who have a sense of leadership and a desire to contribute to Euro-Arab dialogue, and who will be future multipliers and drivers in the Euro-Arab dialogue. In addition to officials from the EU and the League of Arab States (LAS), participation is open to experts, CSO/think-tank/academic representatives working on Euro-Arab relations/dialogue or whose area of work is relevant to the Euro-Arab dialogue.\n\nThe LAS Secretariat also benefited from an EU-financed Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) project based on Council Decision (CFSP) 1998/1789 aimed at helping combat illicit trade in and proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the member states of the League of Arab States.\n\nThe EU-financed CT JUST project aims to support the operationalisation of cooperation in the field of counterterrorism. The main emphasis is support to criminal justice reform, promoting regional and international cooperation between countries to guarantee the security of their citizens in conformity with international law standards, Human Rights and the Rule of Law\n\nThe EU-financed project Halaqat, implemented throughout 2021/22 by the Goethe-Institut in collaboration with Brussels based Bozar cultural institute, served to foster people to people contacts in the cultural domain."
