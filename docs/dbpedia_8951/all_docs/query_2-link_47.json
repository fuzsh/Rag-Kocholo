        "text": "The president is the head of the council of ministers and of the high security council. The prime minister serves as the head of the council of ministers and also head of government in joint with the president.\n\nThe supreme court consists of 150 judges organized into four divisions: civil and commercial; social security and labor; criminal; and administrative. The constitutional council consists of 9 members including the court president. Algeria's judicial system does not include sharia courts.\n\nSupreme court judges are appointed by the high council of magistracy, an administrative body presided over by the president of the republic, and includes the republic vice-president and several members. The constitutional council has members appointed as follows: 3 by the president of the republic, 4 by the two houses of the parliament, 1 by the supreme court, and 1 by the council of state.\n\nThe council of ministers is the chief executive body of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. Parliament has relatively less power than the executive branch, and the council of the nation is the upper house while the people's national assembly is the lower.\n\nThe council of ministers is appointed by the prime minister. The council of the nation has 96 members that are indirectly elected by an electoral college and 48 members that are appointed by the president. The national people's assembly has 462 members that are elected through a closed-list proportional representation system."
