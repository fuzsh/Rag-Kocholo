        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we report the use of 83 medicinal species belonging to 38 families. These findings are in line with those we published recently [7]. Local healers in both North-west and South-West of Algeria reflect that ancestral knowledge is very important with regard to the use of medicinal plants as complementary or alternative medicine. Our results showed that the most predominant families were Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae, and Fabaceae. Same results were reported in oriental Morocco, a region sharing with the study area most of climatic, demographic and geographical characteristics [14]. Furthermore, the predominance of Lamiaceae and Asteraceae is well documented in most of the ethnobotanical studies carried out in North African regions such as Algeria [15,16], Morocco [17], or Egypt [18]. Recently, Ramdane et al. [8] found that Lamiaceae followed by Asteraceae were the most predominant families of medicinal species used by the Touareg called “blue men of the Sahara” in extreme South of Algeria. Furthermore, leaves were the most frequent used plant parts. Recently, Benderradji et al. [19] demonstrated that in South-east of Algeria, leaves were the most commonly used parts in the treatment of different ailments. The predominance of leaves in herbal therapies may be attributed to their abundance in the region, and their richness in secondary metabolites produced by photosynthesis. On the other hand, a collection of leaves would be much easier and sustainable than that of roots or flowers [20].\n\nAccording to our results, the decoction was found to be the major mode of preparation of the reported medicinal species. Similar findings were recently reported in South-east of Algeria (region of Ouargla) [21]. Decoction and infusion are highly valued and often preferred by local healers in Africa [22]. Although our results are consistent with those we found in North-west of Algeria [7] and those reported in neighboring countries such as Morocco [23], we noticed that medicinal plants are never used as a paste in the region. In line with this, Moussaoui et al. [24] reported that in Mekenes (Morocco), paste was never used in administration of different herbal formulations. The predominance of oral administration of the different medicinal plants in South-west Algeria is in total agreement with most of the carried out ethnobotanical studies in the country [25,26]. The predominance of oral administration may be explained by a high incidence of internal ailments in the region [5]. On the other hand, it’s thought that oral route is the most acceptable for the patient. 45 species are administered with other plants - (66%) or nonplants-adjuvants. Honey was added in 53% of herbal formulations. Indeed, honey is considered sacred to Muslims and occupies an important place in Islamic medicine [27]. Furthermore, honey is considered as an instant energy source and is often used in Algeria to improve the acceptability of plants having a bitter taste unbearable [7]. In addition, we found that digestive and respiratory diseases were the most commonly treated ailments with medicinal plants. Our results corroborate those reported by Meddour et al. [28] showing that digestive and respiratory diseases were the predominant ailments treated by local populations using medicinal plants of Kabylia (North-west of Algeria). Similar findings were reported in Beni-Souif (Egypt) [29].\n\nOur quantitative analysis showed that T. vulgaris L., Z. officinale Roscoe, T. foenum-graecum L., and R. officinalis L. were the most commonly used species with the highest UVs. T. vulgaris L., Z. officinale Roscoe, and T. foenum-graecum L. were found to be the most used species in North-west Algeria [7]. Our results demonstrate that both North and South regions of West Algeria present high level of similarities regarding the ethnomedicinal knowledge. The two regions share some social and environmental characteristics. Indeed, most of the local healers working in North-west Algeria are from the South-west. Recently, Mikou et al. found that T. vulgaris L., R. officinalis L., and Artemisia herba-alba Asso were the species most commonly used by local populations in Fes (Morocco) [30]. In the current study, the decoction of T. vulgaris L. is reported to be mainly (70%) used in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, laryngitis, allergy, flu, and cough. The plant is considered one of the most important antitussive herbal treatments in North Algeria [31]. The pharmacological properties of the plant have been attributed to a variety of active metabolites such as apigenin, luteolin, p-cymene, borneol, carvacrol, cymol, linalool, thymol, and triterpenic acids [32].\n\nThe high UV of Z. officinale Roscoe was reported in most of the ethnobotanical studies in muslim communities and may be explained by the influence of Islamic traditional medicine since the plant is mentioned in Holy Quran [33].\n\nAccording to the calculated FIC, cancer is ranked second and is reported to be treated using six species: A. pyrethrum (L.) Lag., T. repens L., Berberis vulgaris L., L. sativum L., A. halimus L., and P. persica (L.) Batsch. Increasing incidence of different cancers in Algeria is well documented [34]. We have recently demonstrated that about 50% of Algerian cancer patients use different medicinal plants to treat and/or manage their illness [25,35].\n\nFL is a useful indicator for identifying the informants’ most preferred species in use for treating different disorders [36]. E. globulus Labill., L. albus L., P. officinalis L., and R. alaternus L. had the highest FL values of 100%. In line with our results, E. globulus Labill. has been reported to possess higher FL for respiratory diseases [37,38]. Furthermore, seeds of L. albus L. are used to treat diabetes."
