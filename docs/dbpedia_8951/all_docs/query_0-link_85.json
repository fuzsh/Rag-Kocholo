        "text": "Organizational Forms\n\nThe most common organizational form for civil society entities under Algerian law is the association. The 2012 Law on Associations defines associations as “individuals or legal entities” that “form a group on a contractual basis for a specific or non-specific period of time and share in a common, voluntary, and non-profit purpose.”\n\nReligious associations, or awqaf, are governed by separate laws and are regulated by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Awqaf. Non-Muslim Religious Associations are governed by Ordinance 06-03 on the Conditions and Rules of Practice of Faiths other than Islam; the National Commission for Non-Muslim Religious Services is responsible for registering and regulating these groups.\n\nPublic Benefit Status\n\nAccording to article 34 of the 2012 Law on Associations, associations regarded as “being in the general interest and/or of public utility” can receive financial aid from the government. But the Law does not state how to determine the “public utility” of an association or define the “general interest,” which leaves much to the discretion of the government in deciding on an association’s eligibility. In practice, the Algerian government does not provide any direct or indirect financial benefits, such as tax exemptions or public utility discounts, to associations.\n\nBarriers to Entry\n\nDespite the introduction of a notification regime in the 2020 Constitution, Algerian law still provides for mandatory registration for associations operating in Algeria, and requires prior approval from government authorities. The 2012 Law on Associations provides for between three months and six months imprisonment or a fine of 100,000 to 300,00 Algerian Dinars for being part of an association that is “not yet registered.” The Law creates numerous obstacles to formation and registration. For example:\n\nThe Law limits those who can create, administer, or run an association to persons who are of legal age, Algerian nationals, and those eligible to enjoy their civil and political rights. In addition, a person may only serve as an executive member if he or she has not been sentenced for a crime or flagrant offence “incompatible with the field of activity of the association,” unless he or she has been rehabilitated.\n\nThe Law requires a high minimum number of founding members: 10 for a local group, 15 if the group is regional, and 25 if it is national. In addition, extensive information on the founders is required with the association’s establishment documents, including the founders’ marital status, professions, residences, copies of their police records, and in the case of a national group, proof that the founders of an association come from at least 12 different regions in Algeria.\n\nThe Law gives very broad discretion to the government to refuse to register an association. For example, the law gives the government the right to refuse registration if the purposes and goals of the association’s activities are not “in the general interest” or are contrary Algeria’s “national principles and values, public order, morality, and the laws and regulations in force.” Associations have the right to appeal a denial of registration, but the government can bring additional proceedings to annul the creation of the association altogether and nullify a previous ruling in its favor. This final procedure has no appeal and, moreover, is not decided by an independent court.\n\nThe Law requires authorities to issue a deposit receipt when an association submits its registration documents, as well as a final registration receipt once a specified amount of time (30-60 days,+ depending on the type of group) has lapsed without the government rejecting the registration. However, in practice, authorities often ignore these obligations and withhold the receipts, leaving associations without proof of their legal existence and unable to, e.g., open a bank account or rent property.\n\nIn addition, the Law mandated that before they can legally operate all associations must resubmit their registration applications and obtain the receipt from the Ministry of Interior. Under article 8 of the Law, the creation of an association is subject to a procedure amounting to a regime of preliminary authorization. The administrative authorities are required to deliver a receipt either granting authorization or rejecting the application. This legislation left a number of associations seeking registration in legal limbo with the authorities failing to respond to registration applications. These included human rights groups such as Amnesty International’s branch in Algeria. Additionally, several Algerian human rights organizations have been unable to legally operate until this day because they have still not obtained their receipts from the Ministry of Interior, despite having submitted their applications more than five years ago.\n\nOn August 17, 2018, the Human Rights Committee raised concerns regarding the Law in its concluding observations, highlighting that “under that legislation, (a) the founding of an association is subject to an authorization procedure; (b) cooperation with foreign organizations and the receipt of funds from abroad are subject to prior clearance by the authorities; and (c) associations may be dissolved by simple administrative decision for reasons of “interference with the domestic affairs of the country or affront to national sovereignty.” Furthermore, the Committee expressed concern over numerous credible reports that the government had rejected the by-laws of organizations that existed prior to the Law, adding that this practice limits freedom of association and exposes their members to hefty penalties for “unauthorized activity.”\n\nBarriers to Operational Activity\n\nThe 2012 Law on Associations provides that associations may engage in activities “especially in professional, social, scientific, religious, educational, cultural, sports, environmental, charitable and humanitarian” domains. However, the Law allows the government to dissolve any association that conducts activities outside of those explicitly provided for in its statutes. The Law also prohibits associations from having “any relationship […]whether organic or structural” with political parties, or receiving gifts “in any form whatsoever from them.”\n\nAs mentioned above, article 2 requires that the purpose and goals of an association be “in the general interest;” upon registration, the association must define this purpose or purposes “with precision.” Further, associations are allowed to spend money only on activities that are directly related to its purposes.\n\nThe Law permits the government to forcibly dissolve an association or suspend its activities for interfering with the “internal affairs of the country” or posing a “threat to national sovereignty.” Such vague grounds give the government excessive discretion to terminate an association, with no judicial oversight or arbitration. While the Law also requires that the authorities give an association warning to comply with the Law, in practice they often ignore this requirement. Further, most active and visible associations report interference by government authorities, including surveillance, monitoring of telephone calls, and difficulty in securing meeting spaces.\n\nOn June 29, 2022, the Administrative Court of Algiers dissolved the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LADDH) following a complaint filed by the Interior Ministry. In the judgment, the Court found that the LADDH carried out activities that were not in accordance with its statutes, which included the division of the organization into five different groups from 2005 onwards, failed to notify the competent authorities of changes to its statutes and executive body in time, and failed to provide copies of the minutes of its general assembly and annual financial reports in time in violation of the 2012 Law on Associations. The court also found that the LADDH had failed to comply with Article 23 of the same law, which required it to obtain prior approval from the authorities for the association to engage with international organizations. The decision makes reference to “the presentation of false information” to the Human Rights Council as well as interactions with the UN Special Procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council. Members of the LADDH reportedly found out about the decision on January 20, 2023, when the information circulated on social media.\n\nMore recently, the 2012 Law on Association was also invoked against the Oran-based cultural association Bel Horizon. Known for its commitment to local heritage and the training of tourist guides, Bel Horizon contributed to the preservation of Oran’s town planning and the organisation of the Mediterranean Games. The organisation also hosted lectures on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In February 2023, the Oran Administrative Court dissolved the organization citing breaches of the law on associations. In early 2024, the mayor of Oran ordered the sealing of the premises.\n\nIn 2018, the Human Rights Committee expressed its concern over credible reports of “harsh police repression of strikes or demonstrations by unions, judicial harassment, intimidation and threats, including suspensions and dismissals, in particular within the civil service.” While the creation of unions is also subjected to a declaration-based system of registration, in practice this system functions de facto as an authorization-based one. On March 7, 2023, Parliament adopted law No. 23-02 on the exercise of trade union rights that forbids union members from participating in political activities and unions from having any ties with political parties. The law also conditions the right to strike on “not harming the principles of the continuity of public service, the protection of people’s and property’s security,” vague concepts that authorities could interpret to arbitrarily restrict strikes.\n\nMoreover, the Ordinance 06-03 of 2006 concerning the conditions and rules governing the practice of faiths other than Islam imposes a number of administrative requirements on non-Muslim religious associations, which oblige them to register places of worship and limit worship to registered sites. The law also criminalizes proselytizing among Muslims on behalf of other faiths and dissemination of materials aimed at “shaking the faith of a Muslim.”\n\nBarriers to Speech / Advocacy\n\nThere are multiple restrictions on the ability of associations to publicly express themselves. Law No. 12-06 on associations contains provisions that are restrictive and subject an association’s stated objective to vague and imprecise general criteria, such as the “public interest” and “respect for national values” and “principles.”\n\nIn addition, Law on Information No. 12-05 requires all publications to have prior approval by a media regulatory authority, which, among other things, limits associations’ ability to conduct advocacy through written materials.\n\nPresidential decrees have also criminalized speech concerning certain topics, such as Ordinance 06-01 concerning the implementation of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, which sanctions anyone who criticizes the conduct of security forces during the internal conflict of the 1990s. Article 46 of the Ordinance prescribes a penalty of imprisonment and a fine for any person who attacks the institutions of the state party, impugns the honor of its officials, or tarnishes its international reputation. This provision creates a chilling effect and a climate of self-censorship especially detrimental to members of associations of victims of enforced disappearances committed during Algeria’s “dark decade” seeking truth and justice.\n\nThe Penal Code also contains numerous provisions that restrict freedom of association and freedom of speech. The offenses of defamation or insults against civil servants or state institutions are still being used to impede the work of civil society actors.\n\nThere has also been significant abuse of anti-terrorism legislation. After 2021, in order to enforce Ordinance No. 21-08, which broadened the definition of terrorism and provided for the establishment of a national list of terrorist persons and entities, the first terrorism list was published in the official gazette in February 2022. It includes the Rachad movement and the Movement for the Self-Determination of the Kabylie region (MAK) as well as 16 alleged members of both organizations. At the same time, the authorities also continued to resort to terrorism charges to prosecute individuals exercising peacefully their fundamental freedoms.\n\nNotable cases include the following:\n\nOn August 24, 2021, Karima Nait Sid, co-president of the World Amazigh Congress, which defends the rights of the Amazigh ethnic group, was arrested and charged with “undermining national unity and state security and membership of a terrorist organisation,” and several weeks later she was sentenced on appeal to a three-year prison sentence.\n\nn October 17, 2021, the First-Instance Tribunal of Adrar convicted environmental activist Mohad Gasmi to five years in prison for “glorification of terrorism” for a Facebook post. His sentence was reduced on appeal to two years in prison on June 9, 2022. On April 14, 2022, he was also sentenced to three years in prison for the charge of “sharing confidential information without the intent of treason and espionage”. The judgment was upheld on appeal on June 30, 2022. He was initially arrested on June 14, 2020 and charged with “praising terrorism” in relation to two of his Facebook posts. In the first post, he called on the Algerian army to “serve the people” during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second post, he claimed that the state was responsible for the armed movement in southern Algeria, the Mouvement des Enfants du Sud pour la Justice (MSJ), because of the government’s continued marginalization of people living in southern Algeria\n\nOn February 18, 2022, human rights defender Zaki Hannache was arrested before being charged with “praising terrorism” and “undermining national unity” based on the documentation work he was carrying out on arbitrary arrests and prosecutions since 2019. On March 31, 2022, Zeghileche, Hannache and 70 other prisoners of conscience were temporary released pending their trial.\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Spain deported whistleblower, Mohamed Benhalima, to Algeria, despite the risks of torture and serious human rights violations he faces in his country. In 2021, Benhalima was sentenced in absentiato 20 years in prison for charges including “participation in a terrorist group” and “publishing fake news undermining national unity” on the basis of articles 87 bis 3 and 196 bis of the Penal Code. Benhalima is a former army corporal, who exposed corruption among Algeria’s high-ranking military officials in 2019. He sought asylum in Spain after receiving information that his name was on a list of wanted military officials at risk of detention by the Algerian army. His asylum application was rejected and Spanish authorities initiated expulsion proceedings on the basis of Benhalima’s alleged association with political opposition group Rachad.\n\nKaddour Chouicha, Jamila Loukil, and Saïd Boudour, who are former members of the dissolved Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LADDH), were tried on terrorism charges in December 2023. Although they were acquitted, the prosecutor appealed the decision.\n\nMohamed Tadjadit, known in Algeria as the “poet of the Hirak”, was arrested on January 29, 2024, before being prosecuted for “apologizing for and incitement to terrorist acts” and “use of communication technology to support terrorist activities and organisations and the voluntary or involuntary dissemination of his ideas” under Articles 87 bis 12 and 87 bis 4 of the Penal Code.\n\nConsistent with the above examples, in January 2022, blogger and reporter Merzoug Touati was sentenced to a year in prison over his social media comments. Finally, on June 7, 2022, the director of the Algerian radio station Radio M and of the website Maghreb Emergent, Ihsane El Kadi, was sentenced to six months in prison. He was tried following a complaint filed by a former Minister of Communication in relation to an article published on the Radio M website about the Rachad movement and the Hirak protests. He was charged with “disseminating false information”, “disrupting elections”, and “reopening the issue on the national tragedy”. He is also being prosecuted before the court of Larbaa Nath Irathen in Tizi-Ouzou in another case for “belonging to a terrorist group.” He was again arrested on December 24, 2022 and placed in pretrial detention over illegal funding charges on December 29, 2022. On April 2, 2023, the Sidi M’Hamed court in Algiers sentenced Ihsane El Kadi to five years in prison, including two years on probation. More than two months later, on June 18, 2023, his sentence was increased by the Algiers Court of Appeal to seven years in prison, including two years on probation. On June 18, 2023, his sentence was increased by the Algiers Court of Appeal to seven years in prison, including two years on probation. His sentence was upheld by the Algerian Supreme Court in October 2023.\n\nAs for the right to receive and impart information, the Algerian authorities have continued their annual practice of shutting down the internet during national school exams to prevent students from cheating. The first disruptions were reported in 2016 and have occurred every year since, including in 2022. Such measures disproportionately affect millions of internet users in Algeria, especially those whose work and livelihoods rely on social media and the internet.\n\nBarriers to International Contact\n\nThe Law on Associations requires associations to secure approval from the Ministry of the Interior before entering into a “cooperation agreement” with any international entities. (Under the previous law, associations needed prior approval only in order to join an international organization as a member, not to carry out “cooperation agreements.”) This requirement gives the government broad discretion to restrict different forms of cooperation between Algerian and international associations, and among other things, limits associations’ ability to receive foreign funding and coordinate projects with their peers in the international community. High-ranking government officials have publicly criticized international NGOs and warned civil society against holding meetings with foreign missions that “undermine the country’s internal affairs.”\n\nForeign associations are allowed to operate in Algeria, but their authorization may be suspended or withdrawn if the Interior Ministry deems their activities “likely to affect the national sovereignty, the established institutional order, the national unity or integrity of the national territory, public morality and order, or the national values of the Algerian people.” They may likewise be de-authorized for carrying out activities outside those provided for in their statutes. An association is considered foreign if one director or board member is a foreign national. Foreign NGOs might also be prohibited from operating in Algeria if the foreign association’s host country has not concluded a bilateral agreement with Algeria.\n\nLastly, Algeria has been mentioned in five reports of UN Secretary-General for intimidation and reprisals against those who cooperate with the UN in the field of human rights, since 2017, including the 2023 report (A/HRC/54/61); the 2020 report (A/HRC/45/36); 2019 report (A/HRC/42/30); 2018 report (A/HRC/39/41); and 2017 report (A/HRC/36/31). The concerns of the Secretary-General came after reports were submitted to the Human Rights Committee in July 2018 about government reprisals against CSO members for having cooperated with the Committee (see CCPR/C/DZA/CO/4, para. 8 (b)).\n\nBarriers to Resources\n\nArticle 53 of the 2020 Algerian Constitution provides that “the right to create associations is guaranteed. It is exercised by simple declaration.” While the introduction of a notification, or “declaration,” system in the Constitution is a positive development, Law No. 12-06 of January 12, 2012 on associations is still not fully consistent with the provisions of article 22 of the ICCPR. Under that law, the founding of an association is subject to an authorization procedure whereby cooperation with foreign organizations and the receipt of funds from abroad are subject to prior clearance from the authorities, and associations may be dissolved by a simple administrative decision for reasons of “interference with the domestic affairs of the country’ or “affront to national sovereignty”. The authorities have yet to pass a law aligned with both the Constitution and international human rights law.\n\nArticle 30 of the Law 12-06 on associations states that “apart from duly established cooperation relations”, associations are prohibited from receiving donations, subsidies or any other contribution from any “foreign legations or non-governmental organizations”, and that such funding is subject to prior approval by the competent authority, thereby depriving associations of sources of funding vital to their survival.\n\nPenal Code amendments that came into force on April 29, 2020 created a new criminal offense that may be used to restrict funding for civil society leaders and organizations. Law No. 20-06 introduced article 95 bis, which sanctions with “imprisonment of five to seven years and a fine of 500,000 to 700,000 Algerian Dinars, anyone who receives funds, a gift or an advantage, by any means, from a State, an institution or any other public or private body or from any legal or natural person, inside or outside the country, to carry out or incite to carry out acts likely to undermine the security of the State, the stability and normal functioning of its institutions, national unity, territorial integrity, the fundamental interests of Algeria or public security and order.”\n\nThe same provision additionally doubles the penalty when the funds are received “within the framework of an association, group, organization or agreement, regardless of is from or name.”\n\nArticle 95 bis thus provides the authorities with excessive power to prosecute activists and human rights defenders receiving foreign funding if they consider that their peaceful advocacy activities undermine the “normal functioning of institutions” or “national unity.”\n\nOn February 7, 2023, the President promulgated Law No. 23-01 amending and supplementing Law No. 05-01 on the prevention and combating of money laundering and terrorist financing. The law provides that associations must “refrain from receiving any donations or grants considered by law as a crime or misdemeanor, from natural or legal persons or organizations or bodies involved, inside or outside the territory of the Republic, in activities related to terrorist offences”. Considering the broad scope of terrorist offenses listed in the Penal Code, this law further impedes Algerian NGOs, as the authorities could easily consider that they receive funds from natural or legal persons involved in “terrorist offences”.\n\nLastly, in April 2021, the Algerian authorities arrested several members of the cultural association SOS Bab El-Oued, including its president Nacer Meghnine and relied on the new provisions of the Penal Code introduced by Law No. 20-06. They then charged them for receiving “foreign funding” and “subversion.” On September 26, 2021, Meghnine was sentenced to eight months in prison and on November 14, 2021, his sentence was increased on appeal to one year in prison. He was finally released in April 2022.\n\nBarriers to Assembly\n\nLack of Legal Protections\n\nAlgeria’s 2020 Constitution protects the freedom of assembly in Article 52, which states, “[t]he freedom of expression, association, and assembly is guaranteed.”\n\nHowever, repressive assembly legislation, in combination with harsh decrees and an ongoing state of emergency from 1992 to 2011, have restricted Algerians’ ability to assemble. In 1991, Parliament amended and supplemented Law No. 89-28 of 1989 on Public Meetings and Demonstrations, narrowing the right to assemble and conduct meetings. The resulting law (Law No. 91-19) continues to regulate freedom of assembly in Algeria. A 2001 ban on all demonstrations in Algiers, enacted after a violent confrontation between protesters and police in the capital city, also remains in effect. In April 2015, for instance, police prevented a public march led by retirees and pensioners from entering Algiers to demonstrate in front of the Presidency.\n\nAccording to Article 9 of Law No. 91-19, gatherings that “oppose national fundamental principles” or harm the “symbols of the revolution of November 1 [1954], the public order or public morals” are prohibited. This subjects people who participate in unauthorized demonstrations to possible prison sentences ranging from three months to a year or fines, or both.\n\nFurther, a state of emergency was imposed by presidential decree in 1992, enabling a crackdown on demonstrations and anti-government protests which were becoming widespread and occasionally violent at that time. The state of emergency was continually extended pursuant to legislative orders, until February 23, 2011, when it was finally lifted. Nonetheless, authorities continue to prohibit and crush demonstrations pursuant to Law 91-19 and the 2001 decree.\n\nVague Provisions\n\nLaw No. 91-19 prohibits any meeting or demonstration that “opposes national fundamental principles” or that harms “the symbols of the revolution of November 1, the public order or public morals.” Such vague language allows the government excessive discretion in forbidding an assembly based on its objectives.\n\nAdvance Notification\n\nLaw No. 91-19 requires that organizers of “public gatherings” notify the government at least three days prior to the gathering (articles 5, 15). The Law defines “public gatherings” as “temporary rallies of people, agreed upon beforehand and organized outside public roads in a closed place that is easy for people to join. Its purpose is the exchange of ideas or the defence of joint interests.” Authorities may prohibit the gathering with no obligation to explain their decision.\n\nThe Law distinguishes “public demonstrations,” which it defines as “processions, parades, or gatherings of people in a public manner, and all demonstrations that go through public roads.” For public demonstrations, the law requires that organizers request approval from the governor eight days before the demonstration’s planned date. The governor must make a decision, accepting or refusing the request, at least five days before the date set for holding the demonstration.\n\nAppeals against administrative decisions in general are subject to articles 800 and 801 of the Civil and Administrative Procedure Code. Organizers of an assembly can thereby appeal a negative decision to an administrative court. However, groups have reported that, in practice, the authorities often wait until the last minute to notify assembly organizers of a refusal, giving them no time to appeal the decision to a court before the assembly’s start date.\n\nOn May 9, 2021, the Ministry of the Interior declared in a statement that any demonstration in Algeria will henceforth be prohibited if it does not benefit from a prior authorization, which will be issued only on the condition that the organizers communicate their identity as well as the start and end times of the gathering. Such restrictions are already contained in Law No. 91-19. However, the statement also mandates that the organizers must disclose the slogans that will be displayed during the demonstration.\n\nContent Restrictions\n\nLaw No. 91-19 prohibits, “in any gathering or demonstration any prejudice towards national constants, or to the symbols of the November 1 Revolution, public order, or public morals.” The Law does not provide further definition for these terms.\n\nOn May 9, 2021, the Algerian Ministry of Interior declared in an official statement that “organizers of marches are required to declare to the competent services the names of those responsible for organizing the march, the times of its start and end, the route, and the slogans to be raised in accordance with the law.” Two days later, on May 11, 2021, the Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights mentioned “sustained reports of unnecessary and disproportionate force against peaceful protesters, as well as continuing arrests.” In a briefing note, the spokesperson explained that “the authorities have continued to block access to meeting points for demonstrations; hundreds of protesters or anyone alleged by security forces to be a demonstrator are being arbitrarily arrested. Some protestors were reportedly detained and later released after being forced to sign a document promising to cease participating in protests.” On May 14, 2021, the Algerian authorities also arrested at least 16 journalists covering demonstrations in downtown Algiers before releasing them the next day.\n\nCriminal Penalties\n\nLaw No. 91-19 imposes possible imprisonment and fines for participation in an illegal assembly. Article 23 states that “[a]nyone found responsible for participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration will get either a prison sentence ranging from three months to a year, a fine between 3,000 and 15,000 Algerian Dinars, or both.”\n\nArticles 97 of the Penal Code prohibits “unarmed gatherings” while article 98 provides that “any unarmed person shall be punished by imprisonment of two months to one year who, who is part of an armed or unarmed gathering and does not abandon it after the first summons. The imprisonment is from six months to three years if the unarmed person continued to be part of an armed of an armed gathering that has only dissipated in the face of the use of force.”\n\nRegarding “incitement to unarmed gathering”, article 100 of the Penal Code provides that “any direct provocation to an unarmed assembly either by speeches made publicly, or by writings or printed materials posted or distributed, is punishable by an imprisonment of two months to one year, if it was followed by effect, if not, by an imprisonment of one to six months and a fine of 2,000 to 5,000 Algerian Dinars or of one of these two penalties only.”\n\nBlanket Bans on Demonstrations\n\nWhile the decree installing the blanket ban on assemblies in the capital has not been published, the authorities admitted during the state’s periodic review before the UN Human Rights Committee that there was a general ban in the capital, stating that the necessities of public order and the fight against terrorism justified the ban (Replies to the list of issues, March 14, 2018, UN. Doc CCPR/C/DZA/Q/4/Add.1). In practice, Algerians living in Algiers have faced special restrictions aimed at precluding them from exercising their right to peaceful assembly because since 2001, all demonstrations have been indefinitely banned in the capital, with the law being consistently enforced. Such restrictions have been implemented under the Presidential Decree of June 18, 2001, although the decree was never published.\n\nIn addition, since February 2019, with the rise of the Hirak movement, the authorities have also resorted to thwarting protests across the country and detaining participants, including journalists, such as Khaled Drareni, who was sentenced to two years in prison for reporting on the demonstrations. On March 17, 2020, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune also banned all protests, marches, demonstrations, and other mass gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing an end to the weekly Hirak anti-government protests that had continued for more than a year.\n\nWhile we aim to maintain information that is as current as possible, we realize that situations can rapidly change.

The new law raises concerns among journalists, lawyers, political activists and even ordinary citizens. Everyone is wondering how these measures will be applied on the ground, and what interpretation the judges will make of them.\n\nAlgeria: Detainees must be released and civic space opened (April 2024)\n\nAs part of the Ramadan #ReleaseThem campaign, local and international CSOs called on Algerian authorities to release unjustly imprisoned detainees for expressing their opinions or peacefully exercising their freedoms, and to open up civic space to civil society actors in order to ensure the unhindered exercise of their missions towards the rule of law.\n\nAfter five years of protests, the narrowing of civic space extends beyond the southern shores of the Mediterranean (February 2024)\n\nIn the five years since the start of the Hirak protest movement, human rights defenders and activists have faced widespread repression, sometimes forcing them into exile. In this context, a coalition of human rights NGOs express their concern and call for an end to this repression, urging the Algerian authorities to respect fundamental rights.

This is the fear of the president of the Autonomous Union of Education and Training Workers (Satef), Boualem Amoura, as the authorities have launched a revision of the law on the exercise of the right to organize, but also on the prevention and settlement of conflicts at work. As decided during the Council of Ministers of October 23, 2022 the executive is refining the list of state sectors deemed “sensitive”, and in which social movements could soon no longer be authorized.

Leaderless protests underlined the weakness of opposition parties, which are struggling to push for broader political freedoms.\n\nAlgeria: Escalating Repression of Protesters. Leaders Arrested Ahead of Disputed Presidential Elections (November 2019)\n\nAlgerian authorities have arrested scores of pro-democracy movement activists since September 2019. Many remain detained on vague charges such as “harming national unity” and “undermining the morale of the army.” The authorities should immediately and unconditionally release the peaceful activists and respect the rights to free speech and assembly of all Algerians. A protest movement known as the Hirak in Arabic initially came together in February to oppose President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s plan to seek a fifth term, and has maintained its momentum with huge demonstrations every Friday calling for the ouster of the existing government and a more pluralistic and inclusive framework to prepare for free elections.

At a news conference in Algiers, the country’s capital, Fersaoui said the law forces NGOs to obtain state approval to operate, and the government has the ability to investigate a group’s activities and financing.

The report also noted that Algeria’s law on associations undermines the functioning of local and international associations in Algeria, and that several of the EU’s partners “have not yet received authorization to officially register as associations and therefore cannot properly carry out their activities in the country.”\n\nAlgeria should accept UPR recommendations on freedom of speech, assembly and association (September 2017)\n\nHuman Rights Watch called on Algeria to accept key recommendations from the 2012 Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process related to freedom of speech, assembly and association.
