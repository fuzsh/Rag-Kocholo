        "text": "After Matthew Perry‘s death last October, the Los Angeles Police Department opened an investigation looking for the person who supplied the Friends actor with ketamine. The search is being conducted in partnership with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and it seems that Charlie Sheen‘s ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, has been questioned more than once about her knowledge of Perry’s sobriety journey.\n\nMueller and the late 54-year-old actor had “an unexpected friendship” that formed during their time in treatment together, and their Hollywood connection bonded them. According to In Touch, Mueller has been an active part of the investigation and has been “completely cooperative,” but she’s also “hired lawyers” after having “multiple meetings with law enforcement.” An insider revealed that “she’s being tight-lipped about the situation, but her iPhone and laptop have been seized by authorities” — however, no charges have been filed, nor has she been implicated in the situation.\n\n“It’s tough to say or know exactly what her role is [in Matthew’s death], but she’s adamant she had nothing to do with that,” the source noted. Perry lost his life eight months ago after being found unresponsive in his hot tub. The County of Los Angeles Medical Examiner revealed in December 2023 that Perry’s death was caused by the acute effect of ketamine, which is a surgical drug often used to also treat depression, anxiety, and pain, according to the Associated Press. His last prescribed treatment was a week and a half before his death which didn’t match the amount in his blood after he passed away.\n\nMueller, who reportedly lives in a sober living facility, has been in a program that “seems to be working for her”, according to Page Six. She shares 14-year-old twin boys, Max and Bob, with Sheen, and after a rough road in the early days of co-parenting, they have found a better path now that she’s sober. “Max is surfing in California, and it’s now his passion. She introduced Bob to the electric guitar and drums — and not only takes him to his lessons but adores sitting in and listening to him practice during his sessions the whole time,” an insider shared. “She’s his biggest fan.”\n\nIt’s unclear why the authorities are questioning Mueller, but it sounds like she’s helping them in any way she can. Perry’s death is a huge loss for Hollywood, and the LAPD seems to think his death goes much deeper than what fans have been told so far."
