        "text": "Even though Charlie has had HIV since at least 2011, his family has seriously lucked out in not contracting the virus. Not only has his ex-wife, Denise Richards, confirmed that both she and their two children are HIV free, but it was since been confirmed that Brooke and their twin sons have been tested and are also free of the virus.\n\nIt was in 2011 that Charlie told both his wives that he had HIV, and he immediately insisted that Brooke be tested since they were still married. Unfortunately, Charlie is not sure how or even when he contracted HIV, so it was very smart that the women in his life, as well as his children, were tested as soon as possible.\n\nA representative for Brooke told HollywoodLife.com, “Brooke has been inundated with calls from friends and family. To put their minds at ease, Brooke can confirm that she and the boys are not HIV positive.” Phew.\n\n[jwplatform kDTbS4Uz]\n\nBree Olson Furious With Charlie For ‘Never’ Telling Her\n\nUnfortunately, not all of Charlie’s exes are breathing easy after his HIV secret was let out. The very same morning Charlie announced the news on the Today Show, former porn star Bree Olson went on Howard Stern‘s radio show to blast her ex for allegedly keeping his HIV diagnosis from her.\n\n“That’s when I was with him! I was living with him! We were sleeping together every single night,” Bree said during her interview, referring to the time when Charlie claims he found out he was HIV positive. “Never said anything. Ever,” she continued before sharing that she and Charlie occasionally had unprotected sex while they were together. This shocking news goes against everything Charlie said to Matt Lauer, in which he insisted that every sexual partner he’s had since learning of his diagnosis was made aware. Eek.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers — Are you happy to hear that Brooke, Denise, and all of Charlie’s children are free of HIV? Comment below with your thoughts."
