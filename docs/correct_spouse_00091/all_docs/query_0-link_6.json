        "text": "The ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen, Brooke Mueller, has been questioned multiple times by police in relation to the death of Friends star Matthew Perry.\n\nAccording to Radar Online, Mueller has been in and out of rehab and she was not at the sober living residence that she was staying at when police allegedly executed a search warrant in May. An insider told In Touch that she was 'completely cooperative' when she returned.\n\nAuthorities reportedly seized a laptop and iPhone from her, seemingly identifying her as the mystery woman that was reported who the Los Angeles Police Department, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service had honed in on earlier this month.\n\nMueller has lawyers ready and has not been arrested\n\n\"She's hired lawyers and has had multiple meetings with law enforcement since they arrived at her sober living house with a search warrant. She's being tight-lipped about the situation,\" the insider said.\n\n\"It's tough to say or know exactly what her role is [in Matthew's death], but she's adamant she had nothing to do with that.\"\n\nMueller and Perry \"met in rehab and formed an unexpected friendship,\" the source said.\n\nSheen's ex-wife \"had been in treatment with Matthew before, and they had a lot of ties in the acting community. It was an unexpected friendship, but they leaned on each other.\"\n\nPerry was found unresponsive in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home on October 28 last year and was pronounced dead shortly afterward. An autopsy report released in December revealed that the level of ketamine in Perry's blood was within the range typically used for general anesthesia during surgery.\n\nThose close to Perry informed investigators that he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment for depression and anxiety.\n\nHowever, the medical examiner noted that Perry's last treatment, conducted a week-and-a-half before his death, did not explain the high ketamine levels found in his system."
