        "text": "Los Angeles: Troubled star Charlie Sheen and his estranged wife, Brooke Mueller, is reportedly trying to revive their marriage and they were seen jetting off in a private plane to Mexico.\n\nThe 45-year-old actor openly supported his ex-wife's recovery from addiction earlier this month and they have since been seen together on several occasions.\n\nThe estranged couple, who has two-year-old twins, flew in a private jet together from Los Angeles to Mexico and is believed to be working on their marriage.\n\n\"They are thinking of getting back together,\" said a source.\n\nSheen and Mueller's divorce was finalized in May this year, one a half year after he assaulted her during a Christmas vacation in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nSheen recently pulled Mueller out of a rehab in Mexico reportedly because he was concerned about the system that a facility would apply on his ex-wife. Few days later, they were photographed at their home with their boys.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
