        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Matthew Perry’s ex-girlfriend and former assistant claimed that the ‘Friends’ star had been “romantically involved” with actress Brooke Mueller, who eventually married Charlie Sheen.\n\nAs Sheen’s ex-wife - who was married to the ‘Two and a Half Men’ star from 2008 to 2011 - is now being investigated over Perry’s tragic death, the beloved actor’s ex-girlfriend is claiming that the duo dated around 2006.\n\nIn May, police executed a search warrant in the living facility where Mueller was residing and confiscated a laptop and an iPhone in relation to the ‘17 Again’ star’s death.\n\nMatthew Perry dated Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife\n\nPerry’s former assistant, Kayti Edwards recently revealed to The U.S. Sun, that the duo formed an “unlikely friendship” after they met in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings almost two decades ago.\n\nEdwards revealed, “Brooke dated Matthew in 2006, at around the time I first started hanging out with Matthew.”\n\nReferencing the rumor that Perry started dating Mueller while in rehab, Edwards said, “They definitely did not first meet initially in rehab, we all met in AA in 2006,” and continued, “She and I were seeing him at the same time, there was no girlfriend and boyfriend relationship - we just dated.”\n\nShe continued to give a clear picture of the relationship, saying, “He would take me out on dates and he would take her out on dates. It was kind of like this thing, like ‘Are you going out with Brooke tonight?’”\n\n“It was back and forth between her and I but they were definitely romantically involved,,” said Edwards before adding, “She was like my rival, I knew of her and I’m sure she knew of me.”\n\n“We were hanging out with Matthew, dating him and it wasn’t really a big deal,” declared the former assistant before noting, “It was probably a three-month thing because that’s what him and I were.”\n\n“Him and Brooke and me and he never went out publicly and looked romantic, it was always in his house,” shared Edwards.\n\nCharlie Sheen’s lawyer commented on Brooke Mueller’s connection\n\nPerry was 54 when he was found unresponsive in his Pacific Palisades home in late October 2023. An autopsy later revealed that he died of ketamine overdose.\n\nOn Tuesday it was reported that Mueller was questioned by the authorities in relation to Perry’s death.\n\nThe next day, Charlie Sheen's lawyer Gregory J Pedrick, however, defended the New York-born actress’s connection to the case.\n\nThe lawyer said, “I believe Ms. Mueller’s past choices may have put her in a position to provide some incidental, anecdotal background to the authorities investigating Mr. Perry’s death. Nothing more.”"
