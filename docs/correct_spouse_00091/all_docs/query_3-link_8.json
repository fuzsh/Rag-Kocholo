        "text": "Brooke Mueller is not “out of the picture” when it comes to parenting her kids with Charlie Sheen, friends tell Page Six.\n\nSheen — who shares twins Max and Bob with Mueller — told People he’s been “mostly raising [his] 14-year-old boys,” and that Mueller is “not in the picture too much right now.”\n\nPals of Mueller paint a different picture, and say the teen twins split their time between the co-parents — and that the boys are living with Sheen in Malibu because Mueller’s waiting for her own new Malibu home to be ready after a move.\n\nA source close to the actress told Page Six: “Brooke and Charlie have joint custody and are co-parenting their sons who are attending school in Malibu.”\n\nThe insider added that, “Brooke has a good relationship with Denise [Richards] as well.” The exes are so cozy, in fact, that Richards is pet-sitting Mueller’s beloved iguana, we hear.\n\n(Sheen was married to Richards from 2002 to 2006, before he tied the knot with Mueller in 2008 and they divorced in 2011.)\n\nPage Six obtained recent photos within the past year showing Mueller with her kids and Sheen.\n\nSheen, 58, claimed to People that he spends his time these days “doing single dad stuff” with his “really cool, really smart, and really funny” teenagers, while his ex, Mueller, “figure[s] some stuff out on her end.”\n\nOur source, however, says that while the twins live in Malibu with Sheen during the week, “the boys go back and forth all the time between them.”\n\nThe only reason they’re living with Sheen is because Mueller’s lease at her Calabasas home — where she previously lived with the boys — expired two months ago, according to the source.\n\n“She was bringing them to school alternating with Charlie. She is now living temporarily in Beverly Hills with her parents, Moira and Jon Fiore, who are loving grandparents, and have always been financially supportive,” the source said.\n\nThe source added that Mueller, 46, is “waiting for her new Malibu home to be ready, which is why the boys are staying with their dad. She’s moving in a couple of weeks, and will be five minutes from their school.”\n\nMueller has even gotten a little help from Sheen’s ex, Richards, 52, as she awaits her new pad.\n\nRichards — who was married to Sheen from 2002 to 2006 — “is kindly taking care of” Mueller’s 33-year-old Cuban rock iguana, Godzilla, as she awaits her Malibu pad to be finished because, “her mom absolutely will not have the iguana in her home,” our source said.\n\nRichards even posted a pic of the reptile decked out in a cowboy hat on Instagram, and informed her followers that Mueller gave her “permission to post… And Godzilla loves hats I learned.”\n\nMeanwhile, we’re told pals close to Mueller are confused as to why Sheen would make such a claim in his People interview because, “they all have a good relationship and the boys are prospering.”\n\n“When Brooke is with her boys, all of her time is devoted to her children — as is Charlie when he is with the boys,” the source told us.\n\nA rep for Sheen did not get back to us. Mueller’s rep did not comment."
