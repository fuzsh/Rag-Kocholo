        "text": "Edwards claims she and Mueller both saw Perry without any exclusive relationships, with Perry taking turns dating each of them. “She was like my rival, I knew of her and I’m sure she knew of me,” Edwards told The Sun US. “It was probably a three-month thing because that’s what him and I were.”\n\nFrom her rise to fame to her struggles with addiction, here’s everything you need to know about Brooke Mueller:\n\nWhere was Brooke Mueller born and raised?\n\nBorn in 1977 in Ellenville, New York, Mueller’s father, Allen Mueller, passed away in a motorcycle accident when she was 12. Per Life & Style, two years later, she moved to Palm Beach, Florida, after her mother married wealthy real estate developer Kenneth Wolofsky.\n\nDid Brooke Mueller work as an actress?\n\nAfter finishing high school, Mueller relocated to LA and enrolled at Pepperdine University in Malibu. She secured minor roles in the TV show USA High (1998) and the film Witchouse (1999). She also had an uncredited part in the 2004 film A Love Song for Bobby Long. Mueller’s Hollywood career was brief and she later ventured into real estate, per Us Weekly.\n\nWho was Brooke Mueller married to?\n\nWhen did Brooke Mueller and Charlie Sheen get divorced?\n\nTheir marriage hit a rough patch when Sheen, now 58, was arrested on Christmas morning in 2009 after Mueller accused him of threatening her with a knife during a fight at their rental home in Aspen, Colorado, as reported by CBS News. He was sentenced to 30 days in rehab, 30 days of probation and 36 hours of anger management. The couple ended up filing for divorce in November 2010.\n\nDo Brooke Mueller and Charlie Sheen have children together?\n\nDid Brooke Mueller struggle with substance abuse?\n\nBefore marrying Sheen, Mueller had several run-ins with the law over substance abuse, per CBS News, which led to the actress being in and out of different rehab programmes for the past decade. Mueller returned to rehab in 2019 following the release of a video showing her with methamphetamine, per In Touch.\n\nAs of December 2023, she’s made significant strides in her recovery. Sources told Page Six that she is successfully using a 12-step programme to stay sober and is focusing on being there for her sons.\n\nDid Charlie Sheen get custody of the twins?\n\nIn January 2024, Sheen was granted joint custody of his sons Bob and Max, with stipulations that give him sole legal custody if Mueller tests positive for drugs or alcohol, Us Weekly reports. The agreement allows the children to live primarily with Sheen while Mueller has flexible visitation rights."
