        "text": "Charlie Sheen has launched a bid to gain full custody of his teenage twins in the event that his ex-wife Brooke Mueller fails a drug test, according to court documents.\n\nThe 'Two and a Half Men' actor was granted an emergency request on Thursday, which guarantees he will assume sole legal custody of the divorced couple's 14-year-old sons, Bob and Max, based on one condition.\n\nThe outcome of his legal claim hinges on whether Mueller, 46, tests positive for drugs or alcohol. If she does, he will \"immediately\" assume legal custody of the two boys, according to Page Six.\n\nThe court order read: \"Brooke shall test for drugs and alcohol (1) as often as required by her probation officer, (2) within 24 hours of a written request (email or text) from Charlie or his attorney, and (3) at a minimum of once per week regardless.\"\n\nIt also states that Mueller's \"custody/visitation will be terminated immediately following any positive test\", with any \"missed test will be considered a positive test.\"\n\nUnder terms agreed by the parents, Mueller would also have to hand over the \"names, addresses and telephone numbers for all her regular, historic sources of controlled substances\" to Sheen's attorney.\n\nThe pair agreed to the stipulations in formal documents in November 2022 and August 2023. However, the Hollywood star was given permission to file an ex parte motion, which means it can be granted without his ex's response.\n\nWhat Charlie Sheen said about Brooke Mueller\n\nSheen, 58, who has fought addiction in the past, recently celebrated six years of sobriety and recently said he sees himself as a 'single dad'.\n\nMueller, meanwhile, voluntarily checked herself into a rehab clinic in 2019 after battling against addiction, and Sheen hinted that her struggles are far from over as he has been raising the teenagers.\n\n\"I've mostly been raising my 14-year-old boys,\" he told People magazine on December 11.\n\n\"Their mom has been trying to figure some stuff out on her end, so she's not in the picture too much right now.\""
