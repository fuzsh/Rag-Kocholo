        "text": "Charlie Sheen's ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, has reportedly offered up \"anecdotal background\" information to the police in the inquiry into the death of actor Matthew Perry.\n\nRecently, it was claimed that the 46-year-old actress, who is the mother to 14-year-old twins Bob and Max with the 'Two and a Half Men' star, had been interrogated by Los Angeles Police Department multiple times during their investigation into the 'Friends' actor's untimely passing in October, with her iPhone and laptop seized.\n\nCharlie's legal counsel has now come forward to provide some context about Brooke's reported involvement in the investigation. Speaking to InTouch magazine, Gregory J. Pedrick said: \"This extended family has worked hard to restore serenity to their ecosystem to the great benefit of their children.\"\n\nHe added: \"I believe Ms. Mueller's past choices may have put her in a position to provide some incidental, anecdotal background to the authorities investigating Mr. Perry's death. Nothing more.\"\n\nThey previously reported that the 'Witchouse' actress wasn't residing at a sober living home when police arrived in May, although she did cooperate. One insider claimed: \"She's hired lawyers and has had multiple meetings with law enforcement since they arrived at her sober living house with a search warrant. She's being tight-lipped about the situation.\"\n\nAn insider also claimed that Brooke struck up an \"unexpected friendship\" with the '17 Again' star as they both fought their personal battles for sobriety. The source said: \"They met in rehab. They formed an unexpected friendship... Brooke had been in treatment with Matthew before, and they had a lot of ties in the acting community. It was an unexpected friendship, but they leaned on each other.\"\n\nTragically, Matthew was found dead in his Los Angeles home's jacuzzi, with his death attributed to the acute effects of ketamine, and drowning noted as contributing to his untimely demise. Police are currently investigating the origins of the substance, and reports suggest that \"multiple people\" may face charges related to his passing."
