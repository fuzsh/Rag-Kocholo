        "text": "MATTHEW Perry had been romantically involved with Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife - who is now being investigated over the Friends star’s drug death, The U.S. Sun has been told.\n\nIt was reported earlier this week that Brooke Mueller, 46, had been questioned multiple times after police executed a search warrant at the sober living facility where she is living in May.\n\nOfficers probing Perry’s death from ketamine in October last year are said to have taken an iPhone and laptop belonging to Mueller and she is said to have hired legal representation.\n\nIt was claimed that Perry and New York-born actress Mueller had met in rehab and formed an “unlikely friendship”.\n\nBut the Friends star’s ex-girlfriend and former assistant Kayti Edwards revealed that Perry was “romantically involved” with Mueller almost 20 years ago after they met in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nMueller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEdwards, 48, exclusively told The U.S. Sun: “Brooke dated Matthew in 2006, at around the time I first started hanging out with Matthew.\n\n“They definitely did not first meet initially in rehab, we all met in AA in 2006.\n\n“She and I were seeing him at the same time, there was no girlfriend and boyfriend relationship - we just dated.\n\n“He would take me out on dates and he would take her out on dates. It was kind of like this thing, like ‘Are you going out with Brooke tonight?’\n\n“It was back and forth between her and I but they were definitely romantically involved.\n\n“She was like my rival, I knew of her and I’m sure she knew of me.\n\n“We were hanging out with Matthew, dating him and it wasn’t really a big deal.\n\n“It was probably a three-month thing because that’s what him and I were.\n\n“Him and Brooke and me and he never went out publicly and looked romantic, it was always in his house.”\n\nIn Touch first reported on Tuesday that Mueller has been questioned in connection with Perry’s death.\n\nThe following day the same outlet quoted Charlie Sheen's lawyer Gregory J. Pedrick, who played down Mueller’s connection to the case.\n\nBrooke dated Matthew in 2006, at around the time I first started hanging out with Matthew.\"\n\nKayti Edwards\n\nPedrick said: “I believe Ms. Mueller’s past choices may have put her in a position to provide some incidental, anecdotal background to the authorities investigating Mr. Perry’s death. Nothing more.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Perry’s tragic death at 54 in a jacuzzi at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of LA, Edwards said she believed he had suffered a relapse in his addiction to drugs.\n\nWhen it was confirmed in December that she was right, she called for his doctors to be investigated.\n\nEdwards - who is the granddaughter of Hollywood legend Julie Andrews and currently runs a horse rescue in Yucca Valley, California - worked as an assistant for Perry in 2010 and 2011.\n\nShe last spoke to her former lover and employer after his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing was published in November 2022.\n\nShe believes Perry and Mueller - who was married to Sheen from 2008 to 2011 and shares 15-year-old twins Max and Bob with him - may have linked up again after that because he never told her about it.\n\n“Back in 2010 when I started working for Matthew I even asked about her and if he still talked with Brooke and what he thought about her being with Charlie,\" she explained.\n\n“He said it didn’t surprise him because that was who she was. She wanted to hook up with an actor with money, so it didn’t surprise him.\n\n“That’s what she wanted, that lifestyle of being married and having kids with an actor, and I don’t think Matthew was ever going to give that to her.\n\n“At that time he said he didn’t talk to her so they must have reconnected more recently, in the last two years or so I would guess.\n\n“She was sober when she was dating Matthew in 2006 because he was sober at that time.\n\n“It’s possible that after Charlie she went off the rails and they reconnected in rehab.\n\n“I guess I never asked but if they were hanging out I’m pretty sure he would have said ‘Guess who I ran into?’”\n\nWhile it is still not clear what police have asked Mueller about in connection to Perry’s death, Kayti says he had a track record of asking others to deliver drugs to him.\n\n“Here’s the bottom line, Matthew was very persuasive,” she said.\n\n“When he was in active addiction he would make out that it wasn’t a big deal.\n\n“In my mind it was like ‘If it’s not a big deal why don’t you go and get it?’\n\n“One time he was shooting at Paramount Studios and he sent me to pick up a package for him from an office, it could have been a doctor’s office.\n\n“I didn’t open it, it was just a box but I had to walk it through the studio with a name tag on and drive to his trailer and was greeted with an envelope of cash for delivering the box. To this day I don’t know what was in the box.\n\n“That’s how he worked, I was like a courier.\n\n“Matthew never got caught for possession because he was smart and he had everybody else do his dirty work.\n\n“I don’t feel for the doctors who gave it to him but I do feel bad if somebody is going to get in trouble for doing him a favor.\n\n“I don’t know Brooke enough but I know that if she was involved in this it was probably just picking something up for him.”\n\nEdwards also hinted that Perry and Mueller may have reconnected over a shared interest in pickleball.\n\nPerry was a big fan of the sport and spent his final hours before he died enjoying a game at his local club.\n\nEdwards said: “Brooke had come up in conversation in the past because I would say ‘Wow, she hooked up with Charlie Sheen. That’s a weird one.’\n\n“Charlie was so crazy at the time and she was this little preppy girl who would play pickleball at the weekends.\n\n“She was not somebody you would think would go out with Charlie.\n\n“She was more Matthew’s style than me because I was tattooed and rugged and she was the type of girl who would play pickleball with him, although in 2006 Matthew was more of a tennis guy than a pickleball guy.\n\n“It’s possible that they played pickleball together towards the end, since she was not with Charlie anymore and he was newly single.”"
