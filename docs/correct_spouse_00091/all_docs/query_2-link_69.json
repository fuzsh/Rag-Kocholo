        "text": "Charlie Sheen announced that he was HIV positive today, and now his ex-wife Brooke Mueller has broken her silence.\n\nWhile she did not mention Charlie’s live interview on The Today Show with Matt Lauer, Brooke did say that she had been called by worried members of her family and friends.\n\nShe stated that along with her six-year-old sons, Bob and Max, they had been tested for HIV and the results were negative.\n\nIn a statement to Us Weekly, Brooke’s rep said: \"Brooke has been inundated with calls from friends and family.\n\n“To put their minds at ease, Brooke can confirm that she and the boys are not HIV-positive.\"\n\nA source told the magazine that Charlie’s second ex-wife, Denise Richards, and their two daughters – Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, also tested negative for HIV.\n\nBrooke's statement comes after she claimed that the news of his HIV diagnosis threw her into a “drug-induced psychotic break”.\n\nBrooke, who was married to the former Two and a Half men star from 2008 to 2011, had a well-publicised episode in the public eye a year after they divorced and admitted herself into rehab.\n\n\"Brooke has decided to remove herself from the media spotlight, [so] she can focus on her recovery without distraction. Brooke's goal is to maintain her sobriety, and she believes this is the best option to reach that goal,\" her representative said in a statement at the time.\n\nUS reports have claimed that her ex-husband’s HIV positive diagnosis led to her breakdown.\n\nThe National Enquirer reports that Brooke blamed her 'psychotic break' on ex-husband Charlie’s alleged diagnosis.\n\n“I had a drug induced psychotic break at Charlie’s after doing drugs with Charlie for that many days,” Brooke reportedly wrote in a text message.\n\n“I couldn’t handle the HIV news.”\n\nMueller’s behaviour went off the rails in August 2013, when LA’s Department of Child and Family Services removed her then-four-year-old sons.\n\nAt the time Charlie’s other ex-wife, Denise Richards, stepped in to help with the children.\n\nRichards has two daughters with Charlie – Lola and Sam - as well as another daughter, Eloise, on her own.\n\nDenise, who had a rollercoaster relationship with Brooke, stepped in to help on several occasion with the boys.\n\nThe relationship soured, and Brooke wanted the children to live with her brother.\n\nRead more: Hollywood superstar with HIV had 'long list of exes'\n\nRead more: Hollywood urges superstar with HIV to go public and to help remove stigma around infection\n\nCharlie Sheen says he revealed he is HIV positive in order to \"release myself from this prison\".\n\nThe 50-year-old actor admitted he has been the victim of several extortion plots as he tried to keep his diagnosis secret over the past four years and has paid out millions to prevent the news going public.\n\nDuring an interview with Matt Lauer on the 'TODAY' show, the interviewer said: \"You've said that you have been the victim of betrayal and extortion. You've told me that people have demanded money to stay silent about this.\"\n\nCharlie replied: \"We're talking about shakedowns. I've paid those people, not that many, but enough to bring it into the millions. That's money they're taking from my children. It's not just me. I've got five kids and a granddaughter.\"\n\nCharlie also revealed he spoke out in order stop \"harmful\" speculation and attacks about him.\n\nHe said: \"I'm here to admit that I am in fact HIV positive. I had to put a stop to this onslaught and barrage of attacks and sub-truths. These very harmful and mercurial stories about threatening the health of so many others.\"\n\nCharlie was diagnosed four years ago and first thought he had a brain tumour.\n\nHe said: \"I thought based on migraines and cluster headaches and sweating the bed for nights in a row that I had a brain tumour. I thought it was over. After a battery of tests they told me this is what's going on. It's a hard three letters to absorb, it's a turning point in one's life.\"\n\nCharlie also insisted that it is \"impossible\" he has knowingly or unknowingly transmitted the virus since his diagnosis and said he had always been honest with his sexual partners.\n\nCharlie admitted to having unprotected sex twice since he found out about his condition but added: \"They were under the care of my doctor\".\n\nHe also revealed that one prostitute tried to blackmail him after finding HIV medication in his bathroom.\n\nWhen asked why he continued to invite prostitutes to his home despite the blackmail, Charlie said it was because he was depressed.\n\nCharlie - who called himself a \"survivor\" during the interview - revealed both his ex-wives, Brooke Mueller and Denise Richards were aware of his illness and said: \"I'm not going to be the poster man for this, but I will not shun away from responsibilities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie's doctor Robert Huizenga also appeared on the show and clarified that Charlie does not have AIDS.\n\nHe said the actor had an undetectable level of HIV in his blood and was \"absolutely healthy\", revealing his main concerns are about howCharlie's depression and past drug use could hinder his treatment.\n\nCharlie said he is not currently taking drugs but still drinks alcohol.\n\nHIV Facts and figures\n\nThe United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS has reported that at the end of 2012, there were 33.5 million people living with HIV around the world.\n\nThe figures are reportedly bigger due to people living longer with more effective HIV treatment.\n\nIt was reported that at the end of 2012, there were an estimated 98,400 people living in the UK with HIV.\n\nThe number of people dying from AIDS-related illness fell to 1.6 million in 2012, which was down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005."
