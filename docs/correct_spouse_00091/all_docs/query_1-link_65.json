        "text": "Brooke Mueller isn’t playing second fiddle to anyone!\n\nCharlie Sheen’s estranged wife has signed preliminary docs saying that if she were to divorce the “Two and a Half Men” actor, she would receive as much alimony and child support as his ex-wife, TMZ reported yesterday.\n\nIn addition, the couple, who have made headlines of late with acts of violence and addiction woes, would share custody of their 15-month-old twins, Bob and Max . Mueller would have primary physical custody whereas Sheen would get the kids three times a month.\n\nDespite waiving spousal support, Mueller will be receiving about $55,000 per month in child support, but that’s not if Denise Richards gets more. According to the 43-page document signed by both Sheen and Mueller, “under no circumstances” will the child support by Sheen for Bob and Max be “less than the child support paid by Charlie to Denise Richards for Sam and Lola,” reported TMZ.\n\nMueller will also get 50 percent of the money earned from baby photos she and her husband sold to Getty Images, as well as a whopping lump sum payment of $757,689.70.\n\nSheen would get the couple’s home (but he’ll be forced to buy out Mueller’s share for an estimated $1 million) as well as his $5.6 million watch collection.\n\nAs for Mueller’s future dealings with the press: The couple agreed that she will not be able to “disclose to any media sources personal information relating to Charlie’s sexual affairs or alleged drug usage.” But Sheen would also have to be on his best behavior by avoiding discussions of his wife’s alleged drug use.\n\nEven though the divorce papers have been signed by the couple, there is no word yet on if or when Sheen and Mueller will officially file the documents in court. Because they are so happy together these days?"
