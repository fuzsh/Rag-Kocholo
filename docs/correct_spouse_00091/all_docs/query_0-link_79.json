        "text": "Brooke Mueller has reportedly checked back into rehab.\n\nCharlie Sheen's ex-wife, who entered rehab in December 2011 following an arrest for assault and alleged cocaine possession, has sought treatment at an undisclosed location per Us Weekly.\n\nWhile Mueller’s rep declined to comment to Page Six as to why she sought treatment, the 38-year-old reportedly entered the facility a month and a half ago and is set to complete a six-month stay.\n\nThis news comes just two months after Sheen, 50, announced that he was HIV-positive. Just days after his “Today” show interview, Mueller, who shares 6-year-old twins Max and Bob with the troubled actor, revealed that neither she nor her sons had contracted the disease.\n\n“Brooke has been inundated with calls from friends and family. To put their minds at ease, Brooke can confirm that she and the boys are not HIV-positive,” her rep told Page Six in November.\n\nSheen and Mueller were married from 2008 to 2011."
