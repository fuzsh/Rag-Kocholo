        "text": "in this instance with his wife brooke i dont personally think hes at fault.\n\nI am slightly confused by your statement....are you suggesting it was OK for Sheen to pull a knife on his wife even if she was drunk off her ass? I am just wondering because if she was that messed up and trying to fight with him...instead of threatening her life and pulling a knife maybe he should've left and gone somewhere else...\n\nNot to mention...the reports are this was not the first time he threatened or life or get violent with her....was the first time her fault too? I am sure Sheen like other abusers uses the line the inmates do in jail \"the bitch made me do it\" but unfortunately his history is so bad in terms of abusing women....not many people are going to buy it\n\nBrooke's family and friends shouold be doing all they can to get her away from him and Brooke will regret staying with him....mark my words...\n\nShe was drunk so he could try and strangle her?....how does that work?\n\n0\n\nCharlie Sheen has a reputation in Hollywood and I am quite sure his new wife knew very well what she was taking on. He has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and I think two or three ex-wives. I cannot believe that Brooke entered this marriage with no idea of the possible problems ahead!! Charlie and Brooke are not young kids but mature (???) adults and had a child (which turned out to be TWINS) very early on in their marriage. Anyone who has children will tell you the first year is extremely stressful and considering the marriage record of Charlie, surely puts even more pressure on him and his wife. Charlie has been through various rehab treatments but always seems to end up in explosive relationships. Personally, perhaps unfairly, I am beginning to wonder if Brooke is a gold digger.\n\n0\n\nThat would mean the other actors in the series, together with production staff, would lose their jobs as I can't see the role being recast. Unfair on them, but may be inevitable.\n\nThen he should have thought of that before he went around threatening to kill someone. I definitely think Sheen is a spoilt brat, everything has been handed to him on a plate-mainly because of his father's reputation and every single time he f**** up he's rescued again.\n\nHe's not even that brilliant an actor for this to be reason. I think he has some very good PR, who always make him seem \"reasonable\" and the victim. His wife has previous drink and drug problems and look out for this being brought up for why she is a terrible mother and person.\n\nCrazy Days and Nights made a post saying that Sheen has far too many people relying on him, he loses his job they lose their jobs. I think Sheen purposefully chooses weak women so he can behave this way and avoid the consequences.\n\n0\n\nThere is one problem with your claim of Brooke being a golddigger, simply put, she doesn't deserve to be emotionally or physically abused even if she has bad motives or a bad character. Do you recall Robin Givens, the former wife of Mike Tyson? She was always called a golddigger and Mike Tyson admitted on television, the hardest punch he ever threw in his life was on his wife, Robin Givens!!! Is that acceptable?\n\nWhy must we always degrade the victim to make criminal look justified? I can't wait to hear that explanation.\n\nDenise Richards was also called a \"golddigger\" but if these women are golddiggers that Charlie Sheen marries, isn't his fault for marrying them and have children with them? Is he stupid? Is he a fool? Were is his personal responsibility?\n\nChris Brown is dating someone new and I will bet you, this girl either believes Rihanna lied or that Chris would never hit her anyway. What kind of thinking is that? Everyone saw the picture of Rihanna with the bruised face and some girl is going out right now with Chris Brown. Regardless of her motives, money, fame or the fact she just may not be very bright, she would not deserve it if Chris Brown abuses her.\n\nBrooke Mueller probably has a few screw loose. Nevertheless, she doesn't deserve abuse. Stop degrading the victim to make the star look good. Abusers generally have a very charming side to them. O.J. Simpson was said to be one of the most charasmatic people you would ever meet. People had a really hard time believing he abused his wife after it all came out.\n\n0\n\nI can't believe i am actually reading that people believe she asked for this?\n\nHow anyone can justify domestic violence is beyond me, its like your giving them the perfect excuse to get away with it. Yes she probablt did know his track record, realistically who is going to think that the person they fall for will turn around and attack them. There is NO EXCUSE for this whatsoever.\n\nDomestic violence, coming from a man or a woman, is digusting and degrading for the victim without people piling more pressure on by insinuating that they deserved it.\n\nIs it any wonder most victims don't speak out when there are people with the above mindset in our midst.\n\nDisgraceful!!!\n\n0\n\nI do not know how my post has been so misunderstood. I never said that Brooke DESERVED to be abused by Charlie Sheen. All I am trying to say is, she must have known what she was getting into and I do not excuse HIS awful behaviour. She knew his reputation, she is a mature woman and his previous wife did a media blitz about her marriage and problems with Charlie. Do you not find it interesting that they are the parents of twin babies and BOTH GOT DRUNK, not just had a few drinks but GOT DRUNK over the Christmas period, ended up (according to reports) arguing all night and had a violent confrontation? She must have known about Charlie's alcohol problems in the past!! I just think there is an awful lot more going on here than we have been told. The fact that Charlie is a spoilt immature violent man is not in dispute here.\n\n0\n\nI know it's harsh but I agree with what you are saying. Charlie Sheens past is well documented and I can not even begin to understand why Brokke would have been happy to marry a man like that. At the age he is now (mid 40's?) he isn't going to change.\n\nIt's not like the violence, abuse, drugs, drink etc were one off's, he is a reapeat offender and just continues with the same destructive cycle time and time again.\n\nNewwoman, You are the only poster who really understood what I was trying to say and I repeat I did not say that Charlie Sheen's behaviour was or is acceptable. How many times have we read about him in the papers being violent, taking drugs, going to rehab. At one point his father Martin asked the public to \"pray for him\"!!!!!. But what happens, we get one woman after another rushing into marriage with him and having children practically as soon as the ink is dry on the marriage license!!!!! Can they all be stupid or have they other agendas!!.\n\n0\n\nWhile they may have agenda and may know what kind of man he is, no-one has the right to pass the kind of insinuation that as a result of his reputation she should just take what he's done to her.\n\nLike i said previously, it may not be a case of having an agenda...how many people realistically go into a relationship thinking that this person will be violent towards them. My view is that this man is extremely charasmatic which is probably why so many fall for him, he more than likely blames the other person for what he had done and then the women believe it.\n\nThe women may be stupid or naive and could possibly be in it for the money but that doesn't give anyone the right to question how serious an incident it is.\n\nViolence is violence.\n\n0\n\nI do not know how my post has been so misunderstood. I never said that Brooke DESERVED to be abused by Charlie Sheen. All I am trying to say is, she must have known what she was getting into and I do not excuse HIS awful behaviour. She knew his reputation, she is a mature woman and his previous wife did a media blitz about her marriage and problems with Charlie. Do you not find it interesting that they are the parents of twin babies and BOTH GOT DRUNK, not just had a few drinks but GOT DRUNK over the Christmas period, ended up (according to reports) arguing all night and had a violent confrontation? She must have known about Charlie's alcohol problems in the past!! I just think there is an awful lot more going on here than we have been told. The fact that Charlie is a spoilt immature violent man is not in dispute here.\n\nYou wrote a whole post on how she didn't deserve what happened and kinda cancelled it out with that one statement.\n\nIs it not possible that she did know what she was getting into and knew what he was capable off but thought that he had worked passed it and it would not happen to her. Like i said, i doubt any of these women went into their relationships thinking they'd come out of it with a beating.\n\n0"
