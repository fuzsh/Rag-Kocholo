        "text": "ASPEN, Colo. — Police in Aspen say Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, has been arrested in Aspen on suspicion of third-degree assault and cocaine possession with intent to distribute. Authorities say officers arrested Mueller early Saturday at a nightclub after a woman reported being assault by her. Mueller posted $11,000 bond and was released from custody. She’s scheduled in court Dec. 19. Aspen police spokeswoman Blair Weyer says additional details are not immediately available. Her attorney, Yale Galanter, had no comment. Sheen and Mueller divorced earlier this year, citing Christmas Day 2009 as the day of their breakup. Charlie Sheen was arrested in Aspen on that day on suspicion of assaulting Mueller. He completed his probation in that case last November."
