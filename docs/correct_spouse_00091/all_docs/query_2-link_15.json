        "text": "Talk about a plot twist here!\n\nSince last year, the Los Angeles Police Department has been trying to figure out how Matthew Perry got the ketamine that killed him. As we previously reported, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office blamed “the acute effects” of the drug as the cause for the heart attack he had in the hot tub. He was undergoing ketamine therapy to treat depression and was closely monitored by medical professionals at the time. However, his last infusion therapy was a week and a half before his death – which means that it did not cause the cardiac arrest “since ketamine’s half-life is 3 to 4 hours or less.” So, the actor must have got the drug from somewhere else. It also meant that he was not 100 percent sober as we all thought!\n\nAt one point, the LAPD’s investigation into this matter led them to a female celebrity who has since been identified by In Touch as Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife Brooke Mueller. She reportedly was questioned “multiple” times by the police about his death in May while she was at a sober living residence and even turned over her laptop and iPhone. She’s cooperating with the investigators, which is good! Although Brooke apparently swears she did nothing wrong, In Touch claimed she already lawyered up.\n\nRelated: Lisa Kudrow Rewatching Friends For This Absolutely Heartbreaking Reason\n\nAs for how Matthew and Brooke know each other? The insider for the outlet said the pair — who both struggled with addiction over the years — “met in rehab” and “formed an unexpected friendship.” Well, they were possibly a lot more than just pals!\n\nThe Friends star’s ex-girlfriend and former assistant Kayti Edwards claimed to The Us Sun on Friday that he was “romantically involved” with Brooke almost two decades ago after they met in an alcoholics anonymous meeting! In fact, Matthew and Brooke were supposedly dating at the same time he was dating Kayti! Whoa! She told the outlet:\n\n“Brooke dated Matthew in 2006, at around the time I first started hanging out with Matthew. They definitely did not first meet initially in rehab, we all met in AA in 2006. She and I were seeing him at the same time, there was no girlfriend and boyfriend relationship – we just dated. He would take me out on dates and he would take her out on dates. It was kind of like this thing, like ‘Are you going out with Brooke tonight? ​​It was back and forth between her and I but they were definitely romantically involved.”\n\nWhat?! Kayti said the relationship between Brooke and Matthew probably lasted about three months:\n\n“She was like my rival, I knew of her and I’m sure she knew of me. We were hanging out with Matthew, dating him and it wasn’t really a big deal. It was probably a three-month thing because that’s what him and I were. Him and Brooke and me and he never went out publicly and looked romantic, it was always in his house.”\n\nOf course, Brooke married Charlie two years after they supposedly dated. For years, she and the comedian seemingly were not in contact. Kayti shared:\n\n“Back in 2010 when I started working for Matthew I even asked about her and if he still talked with Brooke and what he thought about her being with Charlie. He said it didn’t surprise him because that was who she was. She wanted to hook up with an actor with money, so it didn’t surprise him. That’s what she wanted, that lifestyle of being married and having kids with an actor, and I don’t think Matthew was ever going to give that to her.\n\nKayti believes the actress and Matthew reconnected sometime after she last spoke to him following the release of his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing in November 2022 because he never told her about it. She explained:\n\n“At that time he said he didn’t talk to her so they must have reconnected more recently, in the last two years or so I would guess. She was sober when she was dating Matthew in 2006 because he was sober at that time. It’s possible that after Charlie she went off the rails and they reconnected in rehab. I guess I never asked but if they were hanging out I’m pretty sure he would have said ‘Guess who I ran into?’”\n\nIf this is true, is that why the police reportedly wanted to question Brooke? Because they reconnected years after their alleged relationship? It is unknown what the police wanted to ask her about Matthew’s death. Kayti has a theory, though! She claimed the Fools Rush In star had a history of asking people to deliver him drugs:\n\n“Here’s the bottom line, Matthew was very persuasive. When he was in active addiction he would make out that it wasn’t a big deal. In my mind it was like ‘If it’s not a big deal why don’t you go and get it?’”\n\nEven she acted as a “courier” for her at times! Kayti recalled:\n\n“One time he was shooting at Paramount Studios and he sent me to pick up a package for him from an office, it could have been a doctor’s office. I didn’t open it, it was just a box but I had to walk it through the studio with a name tag on and drive to his trailer and was greeted with an envelope of cash for delivering the box. To this day I don’t know what was in the box.”\n\nWith all this in mind, Kayti thinks Brooke allegedly could have “picked something up” for Matthew sometime before his death:\n\n“Matthew never got caught for possession because he was smart and he had everybody else do his dirty work. I don’t feel for the doctors who gave it to him but I do feel bad if somebody is going to get in trouble for doing him a favor. I don’t know Brooke enough but I know that if she was involved in this it was probably just picking something up for him.”\n\nWhoa…\n\nBrooke has not been arrested for anything at this time. However, the LAPD told People this week that the case is “nearing its conclusion” and feels “multiple people” should be charged with crimes in connection to his death. The US Attorney’s Office will make that final decision after getting all the evidence. If all this is true — Is Brooke one of those people? At this time, she has not addressed any of the reports. But Charlie’s lawyer, Gregory J. Pedrick, addressed the situation, saying:\n\n“I believe Ms. Mueller’s past choices may have put her in a position to provide some incidental, anecdotal background to the authorities investigating Mr. Perry’s death. Nothing more.”\n\nWild stuff! Reactions, Perezcious readers? Let us know in the comments below!"
