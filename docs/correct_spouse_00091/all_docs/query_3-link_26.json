        "text": "The wife of actor Charlie Sheen told police he threatened her with a knife, law enforcement sources have told TMZ.\n\nOne of the two felonies for which Sheen was arrested on Christmas Day was felony menacing – a threat involving a deadly weapon. Law enforcement sources said Brooke Mueller told police Sheen was in possession of a knife and threatened her with it.\n\nPHOTOS: CHARLIE SHEEN AND BROOKE MUELLER\n\nSheen, reportedly the highest paid television star in the US, and his wife had both been drinking when Sheen allegedly grabbed Mueller by the throat and she called the police.\n\nSheen told police he was trying to defend himself when the violent incident occurred in Aspen, Colorado, where the couple had been holidaying with their twin sons, The Daily Telegraph in Sydney reported.\n\nPolice have not confirmed what kind of weapon Sheen was alleged to have used.\n\nSheen was arrested on investigation of second-degree assault, a felony, and criminal mischief, a misdemeanor as well as menacing.\n\nHowever, Mueller has now recanted much of her story.\n\nIn earlier reports sources close to the couple, who both have histories of alcohol abuse, claim they will not divorce but are expected to enter rehabilitation.\n\nSheen has not been charged and was released Friday after posting an $8,500 bond. Prosecutors will determine whether to file charges against Sheen during his next court date on February 8.\n\nDespite his wife’s change of heart, prosecutors have said they still intend to proceed with charges against Sheen, although later reports suggest Mueller may instead face charges of making false accusations.\n\nFriends have told People magazine that the couple had earlier been at a dinner party and “were drinking and neither was supposed to be”. The couple had begun fighting at the dinner party before returning to their home where the fight continued.\n\nThe couple married two years ago and their sons Bob and Max were born in March this year."
