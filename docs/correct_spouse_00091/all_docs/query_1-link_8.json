Even though the couple was once a highlight in Hollywood, their days of love concluded in 2011. Here’s everything you need to know about Two And A Half Man fame Charlie Sheen and Mueller’s short-lived romance and how many kids they have.\n\nWho is Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife?\n\nBrooke Mueller is Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife.\n\nThe actress who has starred in projects like The World According to Paris and Witchouse, met Sheen through a mutual friend when she was working in the real estate sector, as per US Weekly. After dating for some time, the duo exchanged wedding vows in 2008.\n\nHow many kids do Charlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller have?\n\nCharlie Sheen and his ex-wife Mueller share a pair of twins, namely Max and Bob. The duo were blessed with their twins in March 2009.\n\nAdditionally, Sheen has two daughters with his second wife, Denise Richards, Sami, 20, and Lola Sheen, 19, and another daughter Cassandra, 39, with his high school girlfriend, Paula Profit.\n\nCharlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller’s relationship history\n\nAfter getting married in March 2008, Charlie Sheen and his ex-wife Mueller’s marriage witnessed an immense downfall. As per US Weekly, Sheen was arrested in 2009 against charges of criminal mischief and second-degree assault in Colorado. He was taken into custody for allegedly committing domestic violence. However, he was released on bail after submitting a bond of $8,500, Closer Weekly reported.\n\nBut, Sheen’s case resurfaced again in August 2010 after he pleaded guilty to the assault, thus, earning him 30 days in a rehabilitation center and probation and domestic violence counseling of 36 hours.\n\nFollowing this, Sheen and Mueller went their separate ways after filing for divorce in November 2010. Even though Mueller received custody of their twins, the order was retracted in 2013, with the LA Child and Family Services labeling Mueller’s care as an “unsafe environment.” The kids were taken away a second time after Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife, Mueller, was admitted to a trauma center following her struggles with drug addiction and mental health. In 2024, Sheen achieved full custody of the twins “in the event Brooke tests positive for drugs or alcohol,” as per Page Six."
