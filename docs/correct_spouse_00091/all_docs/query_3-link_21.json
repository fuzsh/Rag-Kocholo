        "text": "Following Charlie Sheen's recent worrying behaviour, his ex-wife has removed their twin sons from his care, claiming she fears for their safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 45-year-old's estranged third ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, allegedly told police that she was scared about Charlie's behaviour after he apparently threatened to \"cut her head off\". Following his abusive threats, Brooke appealed to the courts, who decided that Charlie was unfit to care for his toddler sons Bob and Max.\n\nThe boys were removed from Charlie's mansion in LA on Tuesday, and he was also told that Brooke had been granted a restraining order against him.\n\nThe custody news comes after the Two And A Half Men actor was sacked from the hit TV show following his erratic behaviour and incidents involving drug use, alcohol abuse and explicit outbursts.\n\nTalking about how his behaviour might affect his children, he announced this week during one of his many TV appearances, “Lead by example, teach your kids right and wrong, and if my right and wrong is a little different than everybody else’s, my kids are going to be a little different, too! Well, they’re already different. They’re MY kids, DUH!” He's also taken to Twitter, where his random outbursts and cryptic messages have managed to attract 800,000 followers.\n\nMore like this\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlie also has two daughters Sam, 7, and Lola, 6, from his marriage to second ex-wife Denise Richards, plus a 26-year-old daughter, Cassandra, from his previous relationship with Paula Profit."
