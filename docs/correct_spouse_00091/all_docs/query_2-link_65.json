        "text": "Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife Brooke Mueller said today that she got a restraining order to keep the Hollywood bad boy away from her and their sons because she was afraid of threatening statements Sheen had made.\n\nMueller told the court in a filing that Sheen knocked her unconscious before their Christmas Day 2009 blowup, People reported.\n\nVisit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\n“In October 2009, [Sheen] knocked me to the floor causing me to hit my head on the corner of a couch. I was knocked unconscious and required medical attention, including a CAT scan,” the document said.\n\nSheen also called his manager, Mark Burg, a “stoopid Jew pig,” Mueller alleged in the documents.\n\nVIDEO: SHEEN SURRENDERS KIDS TO POLICE\n\nPHOTOS: CHARLIE SHEEN\n\nAccording to a sworn declaration filed Tuesday in Los Angeles, and obtained also by The Associated Press, Mueller said Sheen told her in a phone call Sunday night, “I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom!”\n\nShe also claimed that Sheen recently threatened to stab her in the eye with a pen and has spit on her feet and punched her on the arm.\n\nThe nearly 2-year-old twins, Bob and Max, were removed from Sheen’s home Tuesday night after a court order was granted to Mueller.\n\nSheen confirmed this morning that his twin sons were removed from his custody after Mueller was granted a temporary restraining order against him.\n\nMueller was escorted by officers from the Los Angeles Police Department as she took the boys away from the house about 10 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n“I said, ‘I love you, and I said, don’t say good-bye. Say ‘see you later.’ Later is, as we believe, to be very soon,” Sheen told NBC’s “Today Show” in describing his parting from the two boys.\n\n“At this moment on live television I don’t know where my children are, but I am not panicking. This is not about emotion or ego,” Sheen added. “This is about focus and getting in touch with what I have to do to complete the task of bringing these two beautiful young men back to the home that they deserve to be raised in.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Superior Court granted the restraining order after Mueller said in a legal declaration that Sheen had been physically and verbally abusive to her.\n\n“I am very concerned that [Sheen] is currently insane,” Mueller stated.\n\nIn court documents, Mueller claimed that Sheen took the boys, who turn two this month, from her home on Feb. 26 without her permission and would not allow her to see them.\n\nHe “rarely saw our children and only recently began to show any interest in them,” Mueller said.\n\nHer lawyer provided paperwork alleging several “specific, descriptive threats” made by Sheen — and he was ordered to stay at least 100 yards away from Mueller.\n\nOne specific threat outlined in the complaint was that Sheen allegedly told Mueller, “I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom.”\n\nJudge Hank M. Goldberg ordered the boys be removed from Sheen’s care and returned to Mueller.\n\n“My fangs are dripping tiger blood,” Sheen told RadarOnline after police removed his children from his Beverly Hills mansion.\n\nLater he tweeted: “My sons’ are fine… My path is now clear… Defeat is not an option..!”\n\nSheen set up his Twitter account @charliesheen earlier Tuesday and had racked up more than 600,000 followers by 9:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier, RadarOnline reported that Sheen — who has two daughters with former wife Denise Richards and an adult daughter from a previous relationship — was seeking sole custody of Bob and Max.\n\n“There is more love, compassion, support, child care and everything else you could possibly want for a child in this lovely home,” he told NBC. “It’s not a house. It’s a home.”\n\nThe couple filed for divorce on Nov. 1 following a widely reported violent altercation between the two during a Christmas holiday to Aspen, Colo., in 2009. They wed in May 2008.\n\nWith AP"
