        "text": "Last night Charlie Sheen and his ex wife Brooke Mueller played happy families for Entertainment Tonight with their twin two and a half year-old boys, Bob and Max. Brooke was high as a freaking kite and could barely speak while Charlie was maintainin’ and acting somewhat normal, for him. I always find it amusing when people are totally wasted on TV and everyone around them is acting like there’s nothing wrong and seems to be ignoring the problem. That’s the appeal of Kim Richards on RHOBH, and Brooke Mueller is basically the same – slurry, barely functioning, and struggling to explain basic concepts. It would have been funny if these clowns didn’t have two little boys with them who think of them as parents. I guess there are always nannies and adult film star mistresses to serve as sober caregivers.\n\nHere’s what Brooke and Charlie said, but to get the full effect you should watch the video on ET’s website. (Their segment is at 12:00 into this video.) Notice that when Brooke calls Charlie a good dad, she immediately starts talking about how he just bought her a house with a tennis court. She’s been in rehab umpteen times and it obviously hasn’t worked for her. Charlie is still pretty wasted too.\n\nCharlie: These guys [Bob and Max] have nothing to do with whatever. It’s not their fault but they do deserve the benefit of two parents in their life.\n\nWe’re friends and we’re co-parents and that’s what we decided is the most important thing.\n\nBrooke: Charlie and I are so blessed and fortunate to have such amazing kids, and that’s really the glue that holds our friendship and relationship together…\n\nHe’s an amazing father. He’s amazing with the kids ’cause he teaches them sports, plays baseball with them. In fact he just bought me a house, well for the boys, and it has huge tennis courts with lights and everything.\n\nThere’s a selfless nature about her and that’s the only way you can really be available for your children is to be compassionate and be selfless.\n\nThey go on about co-parenting, but I’m really just reporting this so that I can share these screengrabs of Brooke’s crazy face. Charlie was wasted too, but he hid it better. I think that Brooke and Charlie get along when they’re both really high on whatever. Again it would be funny if they didn’t have kids. I hope that Charlie’s ex Denise Richards steps in and tries to be an influence in Max and Bob’s lives. They need more sober adults around. Also, those boys are adorable.\n\nCharlie is currently working on the film A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III . Brooke recently sold the home that she used to share with Charlie in Los Feliz that was left to her in the divorce."
