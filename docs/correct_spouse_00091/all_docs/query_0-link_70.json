        "text": "Getty\n\nCharlie Sheen's ex-wife Brooke Mueller has been found and hospitalized after she and her twin boys were reported missing.\n\nIn a statement, Utah Department of Public Safety said, \"On the morning of November 16, dispatchers with the Utah Department of Public Safety received a welfare check call from a woman claiming to be the mother of Brooke Mueller. Troopers with the Utah Highway Patrol responded to the welfare check call and located Mueller, her two children and a nanny on Interstate 15 near Nephi, Utah.”\n\n\"The children are safe and will be released to family. Mueller was taken to an area hospital for evaluation. The State Bureau of Investigation is currently investigating the incident. We do not have any more information to release at this time,” the statement continued.\n\nA source told People magazine, \"Brooke went off of her medications. She is being treated for the issue now.”\n\nTMZ reports that Brooke's bizarre behavior was noticed on Tuesday night when she went barefoot at a Salt Lake City bar with her seven-year-old twins. At the bar, she reportedly got into an altercation with the family nanny, which caused someone to call the police. The cops eventually made Charlie aware of Brooke's situation.\n\nCharlie told TMZ, \"I'm just trying to get my kids home safe. I have no other details that relate to the ongoing event.”\n\nMueller has not publicly commented on the matter."
