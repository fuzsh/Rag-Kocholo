        "text": "Charlie Sheen is in his “single dad” era.\n\nThe “Two and a Half Men” alum has been busy “mostly raising [his] 14-year-old boys,” he told People in an interview published Monday.\n\nThe actor, who welcomed twins Max and Bob with ex Brooke Mueller in March 2009, went on to claim that the actress is “not in the picture too much right now.”\n\nSheen alleged that he spends his time “doing single dad stuff” with the “really cool, really smart, and really funny” teenagers as his ex-wife “figure[s] some stuff out on her end.”\n\nMueller’s rep declined Page Six’s request for comment.\n\nThe 46-year-old was married to Sheen from 2008 to 2011. The Golden Globe winner was ordered to pay $55,000 a month in child support when their divorce was finalized.\n\nAs the pair struggled with drug addictions over the years, custody of Max and Bob were given to Sheen’s ex-wife Denise Richards and Mueller’s brother, Scott Mueller, before the kids went back to living with their mom.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nSheen’s court battle with Brooke resumed in 2018 when he claimed he could no longer afford child support payments. (The Emmy nominee was also paying Richards $20,000 a month for daughters Sami, 19, and Lola, 18, at the time.)\n\nThe exes reached an undisclosed financial agreement in 2022.\n\nSheen has since been spotted with his sons on multiple outings, from a smoothie run in March to a surf shop trip four months later.\n\nMeanwhile, Brooke has remained out of the spotlight since voluntarily checking into rehab in 2019.\n\nSheen, for his part, revealed to to People on Thursday that he will be six years sober in January and is enjoying a “very consistent lifestyle” with Bob and Max.\n\n“I was like, ‘I’m going to give it a month, just see if I feel any better, and if my interactions with those that are closest to me improve,'” he said of his sobriety journey. “And they did. And I’m like, ‘All right. I’m going to go another month.'”\n\nSheen’s days are now spent “dragging [his children] all over the city.”\n\nThe “Anger Management” alum gave rare insight into his sons’ interests into “some cool stuff that isn’t just Fortnite,” saying Bob has tried his hand at directing while Max plays guitar."
