        "text": "Charlie Sheen’s estranged wife Brooke Mueller was in a drug rehabilitation facility Monday after refusing a mandatory drug test.\n\nMueller entered rehab following a “week of binging,” sources told the TMZ.com Monday.\n\nThe news comes after Mueller, 33, reportedly refused orders to take a drug test Friday as part of her custody agreement with Sheen for their twin boys.\n\nSheen’s lawyers are taking the issue to court Tuesday.\n\nMueller’s refusal to take the drug test followed reports she had tried to hock an expensive men’s watch and a stereo at a pawn shop in Los Angeles, despite receiving $55,000 a month in child support from the troubled actor.\n\nSurveillance footage showed a nervous-looking Mueller pacing around the store Thursday while her items were being checked out.\n\nMueller was desperately trying to get cash for the two items but the store would not make the purchase because she did not have a valid ID, an employee at the shop, Jack Feldman, told TMZ.\n\nAt Sheen’s Sunday night “My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option” tour stop in Mashantucket, Conn., he alleged that Mueller had stolen the watch from him and was trying to pawn it “to buy f—ing crack,” OK! magazine reported.\n\nSheen opened the Connecticut show by bashing Mueller as a “crack addict” and a “loser.”\n\n“Speaking of crack addicts, have you heard about this ex-wife of mine?” he said. “How do we feel about that loser?”\n\nHe explained his side of the custody battle, telling the audience, “This troll sends child services to my house to steal my children in the middle of the night. I told my kids, ‘Don’t say goodbye, say see ya later.’ I’m the best f—ing father they can ever hope for.”\n\nLast month, the actor’s mother entered into the dispute, slamming Mueller for being a party girl and contradicting reports her son had lead Mueller astray.\n\n“Brooke [Mueller] had been to 13 rehabs before meeting Charlie. She drank and drugged during pregnancy and had such a party girl rep before she met him,” Janet Templeton Sheen alleged in an email to friends in March, according to The Daily.\n\n“[Sheen] had been sober for some time before he met her and we were convinced that she would be his downfall. She is only happy when she knows he is in trouble or miserable. She is so very sick,” the email added.\n\nMueller and Sheen were married in May 2008 and welcomed twin sons, Bob and Max, in March 2009.\n\nSheen’s marriage to the former real estate agent fell apart following a 2009 Christmas Day assault in Aspen, Colo., when Mueller told police her husband straddled her on a bed with one hand grasping her neck and the other holding a knife.\n\nThe couple filed for divorce in November and the split is expected to be finalized this May.\n\nIn addition to her monthly child support payments, Mueller received a multi-million dollar divorce settlement from the former “Two and a Half Men” star.\n\nThe twins are now reportedly in the care of Mueller’s mother."
