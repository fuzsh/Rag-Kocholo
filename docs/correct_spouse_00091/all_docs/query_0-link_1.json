        "text": "American actress (born 1977)\n\nBrooke Jaye Mueller (born August 19, 1977) is an American actress.\n\nMueller was born and raised in upstate New York.[1][2] Her father, Allen Mueller, worked as a Miami and Key West police officer, a high school teacher, and a real-estate broker. He died in a motorcycle accident when Brooke was twelve.[3] Her father was Lutheran, and her mother Moira Fiore was Jewish.[4] When she was 14, her mother married Florida-based millionaire Kenneth Wolofsky and moved to Florida. Mueller was a cheerleader at the Benjamin School in Palm Beach.[5][6][4] Mueller has a brother, Scott Allen Mueller, and a half-sister, Sydney Wolofsky.[7] Mueller's mother Moira Fiore is currently married to international singer/songwriter/actor Jon Fiore.[8][9][10]\n\nMueller has acted in film and worked as special correspondent on Extra. Her best known role was as Janet in the 1999 direct-to-video film Witchouse, credited as Brooke Allen.[11] She also played Cassandra in the 2008 comedy film Strictly Sexual (also credited as Brooke Allen). In 2011, Mueller co-starred in The World According to Paris, a reality show alongside her friend Paris Hilton.[12] She has also worked as real estate investor,[13] including purchasing a home from Mel B in 2012, refurbishing it and reselling it nine months later for a $500,000 profit.[14] She had also bought and flipped homes in the Los Angeles area neighborhoods Nichols Canyon (2005) and Los Feliz (2009).[15]\n\nOn May 30, 2008, Mueller married actor Charlie Sheen,[16][17] having been engaged since 2007. The couple were introduced in 2006 by mutual friend Rebecca Gayheart.[18] Mueller gave birth to their twin sons, Bob and Max, on March 14, 2009.[19] On December 25, 2009, Sheen was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse.[20][21] The couple filed for divorce in November 2010.[22] In March 2011, police removed the children from Sheen's home[23] after Mueller obtained a restraining order against Sheen.[24] The divorce settlement – with Sheen paying her $750,000 per their prenuptial agreement, plus $55,000 per month in child support for their two sons – was approved by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge and became effective on May 2, 2011.[25] Mueller and Sheen maintained a friendship afterwards.[26]\n\nIn 1996, Mueller was arrested on DUI charges in Palm Beach County, Florida.[27] In March 2001, she was arrested in Miami-Dade County, Florida for cocaine possession.[27][28] In July 2011, Mueller completed an outpatient rehab program.[29] In May 2013, officials from Department of Children and Family Services removed Mueller's then 4-year-old children from her care, when her suspected ongoing drug use made the house unsafe for them.[30] Mueller entered a rehab program soon after, while her sons were initially placed in the care of Denise Richards, Sheen's second ex-wife, and later transferred to the care of Mueller's brother Scott.[30][31] In December 2014, full custody of her then 5-year-old sons was returned to Mueller by the court.[31] Mueller walked barefoot into a bar with her sons and a nanny on the morning of November 16, 2016 and was taken to a hospital for evaluation.[32]\n\nIn August 2019, Mueller voluntarily entered an inpatient trauma rehabilitation center, in a renewed effort to deal with her substance abuse problems, with her then 10-year-old sons going into the care of Mueller's parents.[33][34]\n\nTelevision and film roles Year Title Role Notes 1998 USA High Girl Episode: \"Lights, Camera, Jackson\" 1999 Witchouse Janet Independent film 2004 A Love Song for Bobby Long Sandy Uncredited 2008 Strictly Sexual Cassandra Credited as Brooke Allen 2011 Charlie Sheen: Bad Boy on the Edge Herself Television documentary 2011 The World According to Paris Herself 6 episodes 2021 Super Heroes: The Movie Luvinterest Film"
