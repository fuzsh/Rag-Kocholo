        "text": "Charlie Sheen will gain sole custody of his 14-year-old twin sons, Max and Bob, in the event that his ex-wife, Brooke Mueller, fails a drug test.\n\nThe ruling by the Los Angeles County Superior Court legalises a previous out-of-court agreement between the exes stipulating that the 58-year-old actor will get custody of the kids should Brooke, who has a long history of substance abuse and mental health problems, test positive for drugs or alcohol or relapse in any way.\n\nIt’s not clear what prompted the motion and a representative for Brooke (46), who reportedly relapsed in June last year, has declined to comment.\n\nREAD MORE | Charlie Sheen’s teenage daughter Sami joined X-rated subscription site OnlyFans – and he's not happy\n\nCharlie and Brooke, who he divorced in 2010 after two tumultuous years of marriage, have joint custody of their sons.\n\nHowever, they reside mainly with the Hollywood star, who has managed to turn his life around after a long battle with alcohol and drugs.\n\nREAD MORE | Charlie Sheen ‘categorically denies’ sexually assaulting teenage actor\n\nCharlie, who was fired from the hit sitcom Two And a Half Men in 2011 after his addiction issues spiralled out of control, is celebrating six years of sobriety.\n\nREAD MORE | Denise Richards ‘blindsided’ after court rules Charlie Sheen no longer has to pay child support\n\n“Next month I’ll be six years sober,\" he told People magazine in December. \"I have a very consistent lifestyle now. It’s all about single dad stuff and raising my twin boys.”\n\n‘For the longest time, I had the best work reputation . . . and then that went away. So I was really excited about being that guy again’\n\n– Charlie Sheen on returning to acting\n\nIn the past he spent his mornings boozing, but things are a lot different now.\n\n“I get an early, jump on the news, work out, answer emails. Then I get the kids up and help them with their morning routine,” he says.\n\nAfter a long break from acting, he is currently guest starring as himself on Chuck Lorre’s new dark dramedy, Bookie, which was recently renewed for a second season.\n\nThe show follows a veteran bookie (played by Sebastian Maniscalco) who struggles to survive the impending legalisation of sports gambling and his increasingly unstable clients and family.\n\nCharlie says he’s looking forward to making people happy again through acting.\n\n“I’m proud of the choices that I’ve made and the changes I’ve made to live a life today that will never look like that mess.”"
