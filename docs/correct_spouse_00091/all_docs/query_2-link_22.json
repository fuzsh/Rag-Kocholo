        "text": "Matthew Perry reportedly dated Charlie Sheen's ex Brooke Mueller - who has reportedly helped police in their investigation into the Friends star's death.\n\nPerry and Brooke, ex-wife of the Two and a Half Men star, reportedly met in rehab, where they formed an “unlikely friendship,” according to The U.S. Sun. However, Matthew’s ex-girlfriend and former assistant Kayti Edwards provided a different story. Kayti told the news outlet that he and the actress were “romantically involved” close to 20 years ago.\n\n“Brooke dated Matthew in 2006, at around the time I first started hanging out with Matthew,” the insider said - “They definitely did not first meet initially in rehab, we all met in AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] in 2006.”\n\nClick hereto follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Michael Jackson conspiracy theories claim he's not the biological father of his children\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce 'proposal imminent' due to telling sign, says expert\n\nKayti added: “She and I were seeing him at the same time, there was no girlfriend and boyfriend relationship - we just dated. He would take me out on dates and he would take her out on dates. It was kind of like this thing, like ‘Are you going out with Brooke tonight?’\"\n\nKayti admitted that Matthew was open with her about him dating her and Brooke simultaneously. It was back and forth between her and I but they were definitely romantically involved,” she claimed.\n\nKayti acknowledged that she was very aware of Brooke, and was confident that Brooke most likely was aware of her.\n\nBrooke and Matthew’s connection might’ve been deeper than the two let on publicly since she’s on the police’s search list. Following Matthew’s ketamine-related death in October of last year Brooke has begun getting investigated. Officers examining his death are said to have confiscated some of her belongings like her iPhone and laptop. Brooke has employed legal representation, according to the news publication.\n\nBrooke was also questioned after police “executed a search warrant at the sober living facility where she is living in May,” according to The U.S. Sun.\n\nThe County of Los Angeles Medical Examiner disclosed in December 2023 that The 17 Again alum, after being found unresponsive in his hot tub and ruling his death accidental, had lethal levels of ketamine in his system. The medical examiner's report also revealed that Matthew had been taking ketamine as apart of his infusion therapy for depression and anxiety.\n\nHis last intake of the ketamine prescription was a week and a half before his death. The coroner stated that the ketamine found in Matthew's system \"could not be from that infusion therapy, since ketamine's half-life is three to four hours, or less.\""
