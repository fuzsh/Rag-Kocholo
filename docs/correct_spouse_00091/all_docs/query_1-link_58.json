        "text": "Charlie Sheen’s ex-wife Brooke Mueller is not having a good week.\n\nA day after Mueller’s twins Bob and Max were taken away from her, her rep said she has been hospitalized in Los Angeles for prescription drug abuse.\n\nMueller voluntarily enrolled at UCLA Medical Center on Friday, following confirmation that her 4-year-old sons with ex-husband Sheen were being cared for by Sheen’s other ex-wife Denise Richards, according to USA Today.\n\n“Despite reports to the contrary, Brooke is currently at UCLA Medical Center where she has been since being admitted May 3,” her rep Steve Honig said in a statement. “Brooke will be there for several more days, and will likely transition directly into a residential treatment facility to get help for prescription drug abuse.”\n\nHonig added that Mueller, 35, knew Bob and Max were safe, explaining, “Brooke misses her children, and wants to get healthy so she can resume her life and get back to being a mom.”\n\nAccording to the Huffington Report, Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services workers took the children from Mueller on Thursday night after the agency determined her home was an “unsafe environment” due to her suspected drug use.\n\nSheen’s rep released a statement to TMZ, saying “Charlie supports the actions of the Department of Children and Family Services. He knows Max and Bob are safe and in a stable, loving environment with Denise and the boys’ sisters.”\n\nSheen also has two daughters with Richards, who has taken Mueller’s children in the past when her drug problems forced her into treatment.\n\nLAURYN HILL SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR TAX EVASION: Lauryn Hill was sentenced Monday to three months in prison for tax evasion, according to TMZ.\n\nA judge in Newark, N.J., also sentenced her to three months of house arrest following her prison stint, followed by nine months of supervised release.\n\nBoy, that reminds me … has April 15 come yet?\n\nBefore the hearing, Hill’s attorney claimed the singer paid the government more than $970,000 of what she owed. Apparently it wasn’t enough. The 37-year-old singer pleaded guilty last year to three counts of tax evasion for not filing returns on $1.8 million she earned from 2005 to 2007.\n\nHill’s attorney asked the judge to consider Hill’s charity work and her six children. It didn’t work. The judge ordered Hill to report to prison by July 8. It was not disclosed where Hill will serve her time.\n\nHill gave a statement to the court, comparing her situation to slavery.\n\n“I was put into a system I didn’t know the nature of. … I’m a child of former slaves,” Hill said. “I got into an economic paradigm and had that imposed on me.”\n\nYeah … it must be tough having stardom “imposed” on you.\n\nHill said “I sold 50 million units … now I’m up here paying a tax debt. If that’s not likened to slavery, I don’t know what is.”\n\nThe world’s real slaves declined to comment, saying they were too busy suffering from real slavery.\n\nHELEN MIRREN GOES OFF: Helen Mirren stormed out of her own production of “The Audience” Saturday night in London — in full costume — to tell a bunch of parading drummers outside to “shut the (expletive) up.”\n\nMy goodness. I suppose we should be thankful she wasn’t armed.\n\nMirren is playing Queen Elizabeth in the show, which details meetings over the years between the Queen and various British prime ministers.\n\nPromoter Joe O’Leary, 32, who was at the drumming parade, told The Sun: “It was strange to see this little woman in tiara and pearls shouting like that. It’s not the behavior you’d expect from the Queen.”\n\nRight Joe … except she’s not really the Queen.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Mirren’s outburst came after the sound of drumming penetrated the theater, disturbing the end of the first half. The 67-year-old actress burst out of the stage door at the interval, grabbed the conductor’s arm and yelled at the band to “shut the (expletive) up.”\n\nAnd they did.\n\nMirren later told the Daily Telegraph, “I’m afraid there were a few ‘thespian’ words used. They got a very stern royal ticking off, but I have to say they were very sweet and they stopped immediately. I felt rotten but on the other hand, they were destroying our performance so something had to be done.”\n\n“I literally walked straight off stage,” she continued, “straight up the stairs and straight out the stage door and banged my way through the crowd who were watching and said ‘stop, you’ve got to stop right now’ only I might have used stronger language than that.”\n\n“They were very sweet and stopped the minute they knew I wasn’t just a batty old woman haranguing them on the streets of Soho on a Saturday night.”\n\nI don’t know. She sounds a little batty … .\n\nParade organizer Mark McKenzie said: “Not much shocks you on the gay scene. But seeing Helen Mirren dressed as the Queen cussing and swearing and making you stop your parade — that’s a new one.”\n\nThe audience later suffered through a power failure that plunged the stage into darkness. Mirren turned to the audience and said, “We seem to be having a bit of a bad night.”\n\nThe audience disagreed and gave her a standing ovation.\n\nPATRICK SCHWARZENEGGER GETS TOSSED FROM CLUB: Patrick Schwarzenegger seems like a humble, down-to-earth teen who, despite having one of the world’s most famous last names, doesn’t seem to feel he has a sense of entitlement.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s 19-year-old son was booted Saturday night from the Sayers Club in Los Angeles for unknown reasons, according to TMZ. Though it might have to do with his rant outside the club, caught by TMZ’s cameras, which showed Schwarzenegger threatening to go back in and “beat the (expletive) out of the DJ.”\n\nThe son of the actor and former California governor, and ex-boyfriend of Taylor Swift, loudly ranted to a group of friends, “Everyone around me wants to beat the (expletive) out of the DJ (TMZ reported it sounded like he said ‘gay boy’ at this point), I’ll beat the (expletive) out of him. He kicks everybody out of his table, losing money for the club, losing money for the owner.”\n\nUh, technically the Sayers Club is also a bar. Patrick Schwarzenegger is 19. People can’t legally go to bars in California unless they are at least 21. The Sayers Club is in Los Angeles, which is in California, so … you do the math.\n\nTMZ later reported that Schwarzenegger was throwing ice cubs at the DJ which, if you’re underaged in a club, isn’t the brightest thing to do, since it usually gets an employee’s attention (it did), after which they realize you’re underage and you get tossed out (he did).\n\nPutting an exclamation point on the whole silly scene, Schwarzenegger then tried to get into an SUV to leave, yet reportedly got denied by the driver, causing the lad to condescendingly (according to TMZ) wave his hand in the driver’s face.\n\nLINDSAY LOHAN DOESN’T HAVE A PROBLEM: Lindsay Lohan — who is rehab right now — does not have a drinking problem.\n\nBut she does love ecstasy.\n\nLohan sat down last month with Piers Morgan to talk about all sorts of fun things, like how she’s only done cocaine “maybe four of five times.”\n\nDid she mean, like, in the previous week?\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the interview just appeared in the Daily Mail and contained all sorts of informative tidbits. Like:\n\nHealth Ledger gave her advice about controlling her drinking (because, of course, people like Lohan who don’t have drinking problems need advice about those nonexistent problems from people who will eventually die of a drug overdose).\n\nShe hasn’t taken a drug (other than her prescriptions) in a year. Right. And she couldn’t possibly have a problem with prescription drugs.\n\nShe’s not an alcoholic and can give up drinking whenever she wants (see Heath Ledger reference).\n\nShe’s done cocaine “maybe 4 or 5 times in my life” (math probably wasn’t her best subject in school).\n\nShe likes ecstasy better than other drugs (which, of course, she doesn’t take).\n\nShe does not think she needs to be in lockdown rehab for three months (where things could become awkward when she wants to do ecstasy).\n\nShe thinks rehab will be good for her because it gives people time to just be by themselves (her rehab, apparently, will be that one on the planet without counselors and other patients).\n\nShe’s straight. No word from her ex-girlfriend Samantha Ronson on what she means by “straight.”\n\nTune in tomorrow for more fascinating news about Lindsay Lohan’s life.\n\nMIKE TYSON WANTS TO BE A REAL ACTOR: Mike Tyson wants to do Shakespeare.\n\nNo, I don’t think that means he wants to punch him in the face. I think it means he thinks he’s getting to be a pretty good actor.\n\nNo? OK … you tell him.\n\nThe former heavyweight champion has spent the past few years building himself a career in showbiz, in television, movies and in theater. He’s done his own one-man show, acted in “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” and appeared in the first two “The Hangover” films.\n\nRight. He sounds ready to me.\n\nTyson recently told the New York Daily News, “Wouldn’t Shakespeare be awesome? That black guy … could you imagine me in Othello?”\n\nYes. Yes, sir. We sure could.\n\nTyson admitted he has some work to do.\n\n“Anything you give me time to prepare for, I can do,” Tyson said. “I don’t think I am ready for that yet, but I would like to try. My career as an actor has blossomed. I never considered myself a comedian or actor, even though I was in movies and shows helping out friends … a lot of my friends are actors and directors and they say, ‘Mike, we need you to concentrate and take it seriously.’ They say my skills are horrible, but I have the natural timings for it. I am working on my skills.”\n\nGo get ’em, champ.\n\nContact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.\n\nMAY 7 IN HISTORY\n\nTuesday is May 7, the 127th day of 2013. There are 238 days left in the year.\n\n1763: Pontiac, chief of the Ottawa Indians, attempted to lead a sneak attack on British-held Fort Detroit, but was foiled because the British had been tipped off in advance. (The Ottawa Indians and other tribes then launched an all-out war with the British that came to be known as Pontiac’s War.)\n\n1789: The first inaugural ball was held in New York in honor of President George Washington and his wife, Martha.\n\n1824: Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, had its premiere in Vienna.\n\n1825: Composer Antonio Salieri died in Vienna, Austria.\n\n1833: Composer Johannes Brahms was born in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n1840: Composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in Votkinsk, Russia.\n\n1915: Nearly 1,200 people died when a German torpedo sank the British liner RMS Lusitania off the Irish coast.\n\n1942: U.S. Army Gen.

(However, McMillan died in an apparent suicide in July 2003, while Roche’s nomination languished in Congress before being withdrawn in March 2004.)\n\n2008: President George W. Bush, addressing the Council of Americas, said Cuba’s post-Fidel Castro leadership had made only “empty gestures at reform” as he rejected calls for easing U.S. restrictions on the communist island.
