        "text": "On October 28, 2023, fans and friends of Matthew Perry were shocked by the news of his sudden death. The beloved “Friends” star was found drowned in a hot tub. Authorities reported ketamine in his system, which led to questions about what had happened. Matthew Perry had struggled with substance abuse issues in the past but was reportedly sober at the time of his death. This has puzzled many, as they try to understand the circumstances surrounding his tragic end.\n\nPolice launched an investigation to uncover the truth. The focus has shifted to actress Brooke Mueller. Known more for her marriage to Charlie Sheen than her acting career, Mueller has her own history with substance abuse. It was in rehab where Mueller and Perry met and became friends. The nature of their relationship is now under scrutiny as part of the investigation.\n\nWho is Brooke Mueller?\n\nBrooke Mueller has a few screen credits but is better known as the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen. Over the years, she has struggled with her own substance abuse issues. Mueller and Perry reportedly met in a rehabilitation facility and formed a close friendship.\n\nAuthorities are investigating this connection. They have spoken with Mueller several times. This has led Mueller to hire an attorney. The sober living facility where she resides was searched by police. They confiscated a phone and a laptop. The search was conducted with a warrant, indicating that authorities believed they could find important information on these devices.\n\nWhat are the Police Investigating?\n\nLaw enforcement officials are trying to determine how Matthew Perry obtained the ketamine found in his system. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are involved in the investigation. Perry had been using ketamine as part of a therapy regimen. However, the amount found in his body was much higher than expected for therapeutic use.\n\nAn “insider” told InTouch Weekly that Mueller insists she had nothing to do with Perry’s death. She has been cooperative with the authorities. Despite this, police continue to investigate her involvement. The focus is on whether Mueller might have provided Perry with the ketamine or knows how he obtained it.\n\nWhat Has Brooke Mueller Said?\n\nBrooke Mueller has not said much publicly about the investigation. She has stated that she had no involvement in Perry’s death. According to sources, she has been completely honest with the police. She is determined to prove her innocence.\n\nMueller’s attorney is handling her communications with law enforcement. The investigation’s details are not fully disclosed to the public. This has led to widespread speculation. Many are waiting for more information to be released.\n\nWhat Does the Investigation Reveal?\n\nThe investigation is nearing its conclusion. Reports from People suggest that authorities are close to pressing charges against several individuals. It remains unclear if Brooke Mueller is among those who might be charged.\n\nMatthew Perry’s memoir, published shortly before his death, openly discusses his struggles with substance abuse. He specifically mentions ketamine as one of the drugs he abused. This fact adds another layer to the investigation as authorities seek to understand how Perry ended up with a lethal dose.\n\nWhat Can We Expect Next?\n\nAs the investigation wraps up, more details will likely come to light. Authorities have indicated that multiple people may face charges. The specifics of these charges are not yet clear. The public awaits the final report to understand the full story.\n\nThe tragic death of Matthew Perry has left many unanswered questions. Fans and friends are eager for closure. The investigation’s conclusion will hopefully provide some answers. Until then, the circumstances of Perry’s death remain a somber mystery."
