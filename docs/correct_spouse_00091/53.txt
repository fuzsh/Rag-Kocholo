Charlie Sheen's relationship with ex-wife Brooke Mueller has continued to make headlines years after their split.

Sheen was previously married to model Donna Peele in the '90s before tying the knot with Denise Richards in 2002. After settling his divorce from the Bravo star in 2006, he moved on with Mueller, to whom he was introduced by mutual friend Rebecca Gayheart. The couple exchanged views in 2008 welcomed their twin sons one year later. They called it quits in 2010.

Through the years, Mueller's issues with addiction prompted her to seek professional help on several occasions. Following multiple drug-related incidents, she voluntarily entered an East Coast treatment center in August 2019.

A source told Us at the time that her children were “doing fine” as they were relocated to live with Mueller's parents. Sheen also opened up about how his twin boys were adjusting to the major change.

“Between myself and the boys’ two amazing sets of grandparents, we continue to seamlessly love, shelter and protect Bob and Max from the haphazard choices and unsightly behavior their mom refuses to extinguish once and for all,” he told The Blast in August 2019. “These wonderful boys need their mom, and hopefully one day soon they will finally have one. Until then, on every front, we got this.”

Since Mueller's departure from the facility, the former pair have worked on coparenting their children. In April 2022, they settled their child support case after a lengthy legal battle.
