Charlie Sheen is expressing his support of ex-wife Brooke Mueller as she seeks help at a trauma center.

Mueller, 41, and Sheen, 53, were married from 2008-2011. They share two sons, twins Bob and Max, 10.

In video published by TMZ Friday, Sheen said he "just heard" about his ex entering treatment. "I think she's right where she needs to be."

"The kids are great; they're not involved in anything that she's doing," he added. "We'll keep it that way for now."

"I hope she gets the help she needs," he continued, adding he is there for her.

"We're here when she reaches out. She knows where to find us."
