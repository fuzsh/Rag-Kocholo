Skank's version of \"Resposta\" became a big hit in Brazil.[2][3][6][5][4] Jota Quest first recorded \"A Minha Gratidão É Uma Pessoa\", which talks about a person who forgives another for their mistakes[7]\n\nThe track \"Onde Você Mora\" was requested by Liminha to Nando Reis when the former was producing Cidade Negra's third album Sobre Todas as Forças. Reis then showed two different songs to co-songwriter Marisa Monte and she suggested he joined them. The section beginning with \"Cê vai chegar em casa...\" was then added to the rest of the song.[8] When he presented the song to Liminha and the band, Reis thought they were unimpressed, but Liminha later called him and told him he heard his little daughter, who was in the studio when Reis played the song, humming the song and saying it was beautiful. Liminha then saw the song's potential.[8]\n\nBackground, recoridng and release\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter releasing his previous disc, Para Quando o Arco-Íris Encontrar o Pote de Ouro, Reis toured with the American musicians who played in the album, but he was disappointed at the small success of the shows. Believing their quality to be worthy of more attention, he decided to \"record the show\", but with a studio album.[9]\n\nThe album was recorded in two days,[9] a Saturday and a Sunday,[10] the first dedicated to rehearsals and the second to the recording itself.[7] The songs were recorded as in a \"live\" performance[9] and extra takes were only needed because producer Tom Capone wanted to add some things to some songs, like his guitar on \"A Minha Gratidão É Uma Pessoa\".[10] The album was ready since 2000, but it was only released in the following year in order not to disturb Titãs's schedule.[6][9]\n\n\"My Pledge of Love\" was expected to be the first single, but the label didn't want to promote the album with an English-language song, so \"Eu e Ela\" was selected instead.[6]\n\nThe album wasn't followed by a tour,[5] but Reis did a release show at Canecão on 14 May 2002.[1]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nAs described by Reis in a video.[7]\n\nNando Reis — lead vocals and acoustic guitar\n\nCarlos Pontual — guitar\n\nTom Capone — guitar\n\nFelipe Cambraia — bass\n\nAlex Veley — keyboards\n\nBarrett Martin — drums"
