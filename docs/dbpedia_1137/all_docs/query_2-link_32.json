        "text": "In a happy turn of events people have noticed that Porto is not only downtown and the Ribeira and have even sought out alternative destinations off the beaten track.\n\nAs such, I thought that I should write about things to do in Boavista, considered by many to be the more corporate and high-class sector of Porto.\n\nLife in this part of the city revolves around Avenida da Boavista, its main vehicular artery. I would even go as far as to say that Boavista consists of 2 ‚Äúblocks‚Äù: one around its eponymous roundabout (or traffic circle, if you prefer), featuring Casa da M√∫sica, the Synagogue and Bom Sucesso Market, and the other, right at the end of the Avenida, at the edge of Parque da Cidade near Sea Life Porto.\n\nLet‚Äôs find the best things to do in Boavista üôÇ\n\nVisit Funda√ß√£o de Serralves museum and gardens\n\nR. Dom Jo√£o de Castro, 210 | Porto\n\nYou cannot write and article on the best things to do in Boavista without mentioning Funda√ß√£o Serralves, one of my favourite places in Porto. The building itself is beautiful and frequently hosts exhibitions by renowned artists like the painter Paula Rego, sculptor Anish Kapoor and even the controversial photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nYou can also visit the beautiful gardens of Funda√ß√£o Serralves, designed in such a way as to always have a tree ‚Äúin bloom‚Äù. And, while you‚Äôre there, don‚Äôt forget to experience the Treetop Walk, a network of walkways ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù from the tree tops. It is really, really wonderful, and one of the most romantic things to do in Porto.\n\nI recommend that you purchase the ticket for Funda√ß√£o Serralves (including gardens) online because it makes things simpler. However, if you are on a budget, you can go there on the morning of the first Sunday of every month as it‚Äôs free. Brace yourselves, though, as it will be full of screaming children.\n\nHow to get there: the 203 and 207 buses stop right in front of Serralves.\n\nTake a walk in Parque da Cidade\n\nAvenida da Boavista | Porto\n\nIt took me quite a while to actually enjoy Parque da Cidade as it always seemed to me to be a large and confusing park with too many entrances, paths and animals running around without a leash üòõ However, it must be said that it is one of the best gardens in Porto because of its versatility: there is room for sporting activities, yoga classes, picnics with friends, romantic walks and morning jogs. Visiting this park is, without a doubt, one of the best things to do in Boavista.\n\nAlso, on Saturday mornings there is an organic market that takes place in Parque da Cidade (behind the Soundwich restaurant), where you can find high quality produce.\n\nTo everyone‚Äôs delight (including my own as I run there on the weekends) there are public water fountains and bathrooms throughout the park.\n\nHow to get there: there are several entrances to Parque da Cidade ‚Äì I like to use the Avenida da Boavista entrance, because there is free parking in front.\n\nTake your kids to see the penguins in SEA Life Porto\n\nRua Particular N¬∫ 1, Castelo do Queijo | Porto\n\nA friend of mine just became a mother about a year and a half ago and when she took her child to SEA Life Porto for the first time she was like: ‚Äúif I had known that it was that good, I would have taken my kid there ‚Äì I think I‚Äôll go alone too!‚Äù. You can understand the temptation: it‚Äôs that SEA Life Porto, besides being a great destination for families with kids they also have a large outdoor area with benches for people to sit and ‚Äúview‚Äù the ‚Äúlake‚Äù where the penguins are fed, much to the delight of the kids (and the families). I‚Äôve even had people tell me that they preferred SEA Life Porto to the Lisbon Oceanarium, specifically because of the large outdoor area.\n\nSo, if you‚Äôre looking for things to do in Boavista, I would heartily recommend SEA Life Porto.\n\nIf the weather is nice go to SEA Life Porto and then take a stroll around Parque da Cidade (there is an entrance nearby) or go to Matosinhos beach just the other side of the road.\n\nHow to get there: there are many, many buses that stop at the roundabout of Castelo do Queijo or at the end of Avenida da Boavista (namely: the 200, 203, 205, 500 and 502).\n\nWatch a live concert at Casa da M√∫sica\n\nAvenida da Boavista, 604 | Porto\n\nIf you go up Avenida da Boavista in the direction of the city centre you will find the stunning Casa da M√∫sica on your left. This venue, considered by many to be an eyesore is one of the biggest attractions in terms of contemporary Porto architecture. It has 3 resident orchestras and 2 resident choirs, an eclectic programme and even an educational service which regularly organizes activities for kids. So, if you wish to experience one of the best things to do in Boavista you should visit Casa da M√∫sica!\n\nThe way I see it, the best way to explore Casa da M√∫sica is to watch a live show. Having said that, the last time I did so (November 2021) I didn‚Äôt feel too comfortable as they didn‚Äôt check for digital vaccination certificates (even though they are required to by law), didn‚Äôt check people‚Äôs temperature at the door and they didn‚Äôt provide hand sanitizer‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs just say it was a very unsettling (unnecessarily so) evening.\n\nThere is another way to experience this building, in an orderly manner and in smaller groups, which is via a guided tour of Casa da M√∫sica. I‚Äôve done this several times, with clients, and I‚Äôve always enjoyed myself.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 5 minutes away.\n\nTake a leisurely stroll through Agramonte cemetery\n\nRua da Medita√ß√£o, 80 | Porto\n\nIt may seem strange to read this but one of the best ways to get to know a society is by analyzing its way of dealing with the dead and the concept of death in general. Now that I think about it, one of the things that I do when I travel is to visit local cemeteries. I get so introspective thinking about life and the moment. So, at least for me, one of the most interesting things to do in Boavista is to ‚Äútake a walk‚Äù in Agramonte cemetery.\n\nThis cemetery was inaugurated in 1855 and its chapel was expanded in 1906 by Jos√© Marques da Silva, one of the seminal Portuguese architects from the 19th and 20th centuries who left his mark on the city having designed, among other buildings, the famous S√£o Bento train station.\n\nThis cemetery is the resting place of several public figures, like the cellist Guilhermina Suggia.\n\nAside from the graves of Ant√≥nio Soares dos Reis and Ant√≥nio Teixeira Lopes, it also has a beautiful mausoleum dedicated to the victims of the Bacquet Theatre fire. It was built incorporating the ruins of the Bacquet Theatre like pieces of iron that were twisted by the fire. It is magnificent and profoundly forgotten.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 5 minutes away on foot.\n\nTry some tapas at Bom Sucesso Market\n\nPra√ßa do Bom Sucesso, 74-90 | Porto\n\nBom Sucesso Market, one of the oldest markets in Porto (specifically for fish) is a notable example of how it is possible to adapt historic buildings in a modern style tastefully, without defacing the past. These days, instead of the hollering fishmongers you hear soothing background music and socialize around the numerous food stalls.\n\nThe options are endless: √©clairs from Leitaria da Quinta do Pa√ßo, pizzas, poke bowls, suckling pig from Bairrada, wine by the glass, cocktails, vegetarian dishes, ice creams from Neveiros‚Ä¶ the variety is such that even the pickiest member of the group will be satisfied.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 5 minutes away on foot.\n\nHave a real sandwich at Tasca da Badalhoca\n\nRua Dr. Alberto de Macedo, 437 | Porto\n\nMany good folks mistake the real Tasca da Badalhosa for Taxca on Rua da Picaria. However, the true lovers of Tascas in Porto know that everything started in a tiny, red, hobbit-sized house in the Boavista / Ramalde area. There, among the hanging legs of smoked ham and the smile of D¬™ Lurdes, you will find the best presunto, liver and caramelized onions or Roj√µes (pork) sandwiches in the whole of Porto. The rest is history.\n\nHow to get there: catch the 202 bus and get off at the Alberto Macedo stop.\n\nVisit the Holocaust Museum\n\nRua do Campo Alegre, 790 | Porto\n\nI was almost not going to include the Porto Jewish Community‚Äôs Holocaust Museum in this article about the best things to do in Boavista. It‚Äôs just that it is a bit strange to have a museum like this in a country that: 1) did not participate in the 2nd world war, and 2) at that time, this country was ruled by a dictator who did everything within his power to prevent the arrival of Jews to Portugal. It is, in my opinion, a museum that is quite removed from our history culture. It is, however, something to be admired about the initiative of the Porto Jewish Community.\n\nAlso, you have to remember that for those who have not had the chance to visit an old concentration camp, this is a closer and more accessible option for learning about the horrors of the 2nd world war. Also, while you‚Äôre there you should also check out the Synagogue of Porto ‚Äì it is closed for visitation, but it is a beautiful building.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 5 minutes away on foot.\n\nGo for brunch at Negra Caf√© Boavista\n\nRua de 5 de Outubro, 93 | Porto\n\nI must admit that Brunch in Porto has sort of lost its thing for me. However, I do enjoy brunch in the new Negra Caf√© of Boavista. It is spacious, full of natural light and the staff could not be nicer, even when they are swimming in hard work.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 5 minutes away on foot.\n\nChill out at the spa in Sheraton Porto Hotel & Spa\n\nDiversas localiza√ß√µes\n\nIf you are clueless about the best things to do in Boavista and feel like pampering yourself the why not take a massage at the Sheraton Hotel & Spa? It is considered one of the top hotels in Porto and features a spa when you can enjoy body and face massages both single or couple‚Äôs.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 15 minutes away on foot.\n\nHave lunch in Goela\n\nAvenida da Boavista, 4 | Porto\n\nChefe Jo√£o Ribeiro describes his cuisine as ‚Äúrandom comfort food‚Äù and that definition is spot on. I have rarely seen so much creativity in one chef who offers a different menu EVERY DAY, often with inspiration from beyond this countries borders.\n\nIn August Goela Abaixo had some construction work done and as a result now has a lot more room to accommodate its customers. Outdoors they can seat about 14 people with another 6 inside. This means that in the winter the restaurant will be more comfortable, but the chef admits there are still some improvements to be done.\n\nThere are two daily specials (one of them vegetarian) for 7‚Ç¨, soup for 2‚Ç¨ and the salad for 1,5‚Ç¨. If that doesn‚Äôt sound like your thing they also have options a la carte ‚Äì if you‚Äôre in luck I recommend the sun dried tomato arancini which is to die for.\n\nO Goela tem uma esplanada pequena (14 lugares) e meia d√∫zia de lugares no interior, pelo que recomendo que marque lugar. Tamb√©m tem servi√ßo de take away.\n\nGiven the limited space in the restaurant I would highly recommend that you book beforehand. It also does take-aways.\n\nHow to get there: Casa da M√∫sica metro station is 15 minutes away on foot.\n\nSave this article for later:"
