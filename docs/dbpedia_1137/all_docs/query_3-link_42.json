        "text": "New Single & Lyric Video: Raging Fyah & Cidade Negra - Would You Love Me (Remix)\n\n05/11/2017\n\nToday, May 11th, is National Reggae Day in Brazil!\n\nJust in time for the celebrations Raging Fyah releases the remix single Would You Love Me with Brazilian reggae powerhouse Cidade Negra. We at Reggaeville join the celebration with the premiere of the official lyric video for Would You Love Me (Remix).\n\nProduced by Riff Raff and written by Raging Fyah in collaboration with Cidade Negra, the song explores the nuances of materialism in relationships, posing the question, “If I gave you everything I own, would you love me?” From the cover art, to the brilliant blend of roots reggae and soft rock, to the rousing libretto, it all comes together on this classic summer jam.\n\nBased in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, Cidade Negra came together in 1986 and reached a great level of success in the 90’s with albums Sobre Todas as Forças and O Erê. They perform Portuguese and English lyrics on Would You Love Me adding an international flair. The band is currently working on a new album and doing select tour dates in Brazil through September, concluding at Rock in Rio, Brazil’s biggest running music festival in since 1985.\n\nRaging Fyah was recently nominated in the Best Reggae Album category for the 2017 Grammy Awards which aired on February 12th. The band is currently gearing up for an opening slot on the UB40 summer tour, commencing in Inverness, UK on May 19th and ending in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 29th.\n\nWatch the video below and click here buy the single:"
