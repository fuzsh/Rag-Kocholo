        "text": "Would You Love Me\n\nCidade Negra meets Raging Fyah\n\nComing off their Grammy nominated album ‘Everlasting’, Raging Fyah releases the remix single ‘Would You Love Me’ featuring Brazilian reggae powerhouse, Cidade Negra available on all digital music platforms May 5th. The two acts bring together a distinctive blend of reggae flavor just in time for Brazil’s National Reggae Day celebrations.\n\nBased in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, Cidade Negra came together in 1986 and reached a great level of success in the 90’s with albums ‘Sobre Todas as Forças’ and ‘O Erê’. They perform Portuguese and English lyrics on ‘Would You Love Me’ adding an international flair. The band is currently working on a new album and doing select tour dates in Brazil through September, concluding at Rock in Rio, Brazil’s biggest running music festival in since 1985.\n\nProduced by Riff Raff and written by Raging Fyah in collaboration with Cidade Negra, ‘Would You Love Me (Remix)’ explores the nuances of materialism in relationships, posing the question, “If I gave you everything I own, would you love me?” From the cover art, to the brilliant blend of roots reggae and soft rock, to the rousing libretto, it all comes together on this classic summer jam.\n\nRaging Fyah was recently nominated in the Best Reggae Album category for the 2017 Grammy Awards which aired on February 12th. The band is currently gearing up for an opening slot on the UB40 summer tour, commencing in Inverness, UK on May 19th and ending in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 29th. See full tour schedule at link below.\n\nFor more information on Raging Fyah please visit: RagingFyah.com."
