What is Firmamento about?

ðŸŽ¶ Firmamento song analysis

The protagonist is questioning what to do if his partner's love and affection isn't reciprocated. In a sky full of colorful stars, there is one that he hasn't captured. He expresses his strong love and devotion, saying that no matter how close or far his partner is, she is always in his thoughts and his mind wanders to her. He also reflects on the idea that there are more things between heaven and earth than what we can understand, and that love can transcend our own understanding.
