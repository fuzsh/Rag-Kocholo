        "text": "Odesa Oblast (Ukrainian: Одеська область, romanized: Odeska oblast), also referred to as Odeshchyna (Ukrainian: Одещина), is an oblast (province) of southwestern Ukraine, located along the northern coast of the Black Sea. Its administrative centre is the city of Odesa (Ukrainian: Одеса). Population: 2,351,382 (2022 estimate).\n\nThe length of coastline (sea-coast and estuaries) reaches 300 km (190 mi), while the state border stretches for 1,200 km (750 mi). The region has eight seaports and five of the biggest lakes, including Yalpuh Lake, in Ukraine. With over 80,000 ha (200,000 acres) of vineyards, it is also the largest wine-growing region in Ukraine.\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the earliest inhabitants in this area comes from the settlements and burial grounds of the Neolithic Gumelnița, Cucuteni-Trypillia and Usatove cultures, as well as from the tumuli and hoards of the Bronze Age Proto-Indo-Europeans. In the 1st millennium B.C. Milesian Greeks founded colonies along the northern coast of the Black Sea, including the towns of Olbia, Tyras, Niconium, Panticapaeum, and Chersonesus. The Greeks left behind painted vessels, ceramics, sculptures, inscriptions, arts and crafts that indicate the prosperity of their ancient civilisation.\n\nThe culture of Scythian tribes inhabiting the Black Sea littoral steppes in the first millennium B.C. has left artefacts in settlements and burial grounds, including weapons, bronze cauldrons, other utensils, and adornments. By the beginning of the 1st millennium A.D. the Sarmatians displaced the Scythians. In the 3rd–4th centuries A.D. a tribal alliance, represented by the items of Chernyakhov culture, developed. From the middle of the first millennium the formation of the Slavic people began. In the 9th century the eastern Slavs united into a state with Kyiv as its centre. The Khazars, Polovtsy and Pechenegs were the Slavs' neighbours during different times. Archeological evidence of the period of the 9th–14th centuries survives in materials from the settlements and cities of Kievan Rus': Belgorod, Caffa-Theodosia, and Berezan Island.\n\nThe Mongols took over the Black Sea littoral in the 13th century.\n\nFrom about 1290 parts of the region were territories of the Republic of Genoa, becoming a center of Genoese commercial activity until at least the middle of the 14th century.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Lithuania acquired the area at the beginning of the 15th century.\n\nIn 1593 the Ottoman Empire set up in the area what became known as its Dnieper Province (Özü Eyalet), unofficially known as the Khanate of Ukraine. Russian historiography refers to the area from 1791 as the Ochakov Oblast. The territory of the Odesa Oblast passed to Russian control in 1791 in the course of the Russian southern expansion towards the Black Sea at the end of the 18th century.\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia the area became part of the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1918), but soon succumbed first to the Russian Volunteer Army (part of the White movement) and then to the Russian Bolshevik Red Army. By 1920 the Soviet authorities had secured the territory of Odesa Oblast, which became part of the Ukrainian SSR. The oblast was established on 27 February 1932 from five districts: Odesa Okruha, Pervomaisk Okruha, Kirovohrad Okruha, Mykolaiv Okruha, and Kherson Okruha.\n\nIn 1937 the Central Executive Committee of the USSR split off the eastern portions of the Odesa Oblast to form the Mykolaiv Oblast.\n\nDuring World War II Axis forces conquered the area and Romania occupied the oblast and administered it as part of the Transnistria Governorate (1941–1944). After the war the Soviet administration reestablished the oblast with its pre-war borders.\n\nOdesa Oblast expanded in 1954 to absorb Izmail Oblast (also known as the Budjak region of Bessarabia), formed in 1940 as a result of the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (from Romania), when Northern and Southern parts of Bessarabia were given to the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nDuring the 1991 referendum, 85.38% of votes in Odesa Oblast favored the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 2.3% of the oblast's population supported their region joining Russia, 91.5% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond. A poll reported by Alexei Navalny and conducted in September 2014 found similar results.\n\nOn 4-5 July 2022 during international Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2022) in Lugano Switzerland pledged to support the rebuilding of Odesa region.\n\nGeography\n\nUkraine's largest oblast by area, the Odesa Oblast occupies an area of around 33,314 square kilometres (12,863 sq mi). It is characterised by largely flat steppes – part of the Black Sea Lowland – divided by the estuary of the Dniester river, and bordered to the south by the Danube. Its Black Sea coast has numerous sandy beaches, estuaries and lagoons. The region's soils (especially chernozems) have a reputation for fertility, and intensive agriculture is the mainstay of the local rural economy. The southwest has many orchards and vineyards, while arable crops grow throughout the region.\n\nPoints of interest\n\nOdesa Opera\n\nAkkerman fortress\n\nPotemkin Stairs\n\nEconomy\n\nSignificant branches of the oblast's economy are:\n\noil refining and chemicals processing;\n\ntransportation (important sea and river ports, oil pipelines and railway);\n\nviticulture and other forms of agriculture, notably the growing of wheat, maize, barley, sunflowers and sugar beets.\n\nThe region's industrial capability is principally concentrated in and around Odesa.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe oblast's population (as at the start of 2021) was 2,368,107 people, nearly 43% of whom lived in the city of Odesa.\n\nSignificant Bulgarian (6.1%) and Romanian (5.0%) minorities reside in the province. It has the highest proportion of Jews of any oblast in Ukraine (although smaller than the Autonomous City of Kyiv) and there is a small Greek community in the city of Odesa.\n\nBulgarians and Romanians represent 21% and 13% respectively, of the population in the salient of Budjak, within Odesa Oblast.\n\nYear Fertility Birth 1990 1,8 33 166 1991 1,7 32 119 1992 1,6 30 155 1993 1,5 28 185 1994 1,4 26 197 1995 1,4 24 993 1996 1,3 23 666 1997 1,2 22 491 1998 1,2 21 273 1999 1,1 19 969 2000 1,1 20 042 2001 1,1 20 423 2002 1,2 21 227 2003 1,2 22 326 2004 1,3 23 343 2005 1,3 23 915 2006 1,4 25 113 2007 1,5 26 759 2008 1,6 28 780 2009 1,6 28 986 2010 1,6 28 690 2011 1,6 29 225 2012 1,7 30 384\n\nAge structure\n\n0–14 years: 15.5% (male 188,937/female 179,536)\n\n15–64 years: 70.7% (male 812,411/female 867,706)\n\n65 years and over: 14.0% (male 116,702/female 218,808) (2013 official)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 38.4 years\n\nmale: 35.4 years\n\nfemale: 41.5 years (2013 official)\n\nReligion\n\nThe dominant religion in Odesa Oblast is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, professed by 84% of the population.

In the 18 July 2020 reorganisation, these nine raions were reduced to three, which also incorporated the two former independent cities.\n\nNote: Asterisks (*) Though the administrative center of the rayon is housed in the city/town that it is named after, cities do not answer to the rayon authorities only towns do; instead they are directly subordinated to the oblast government and therefore are not counted as part of rayon statistics.\n\nOn 18 July 2020, the number of districts (raions) was reduced to seven, now also incorporating the formerly independent cities.
