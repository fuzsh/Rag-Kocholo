The present report is based on findings of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights\n\nMonitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) covering the period of 7 May – 7 June\n\n2014. It follows two reports on the human rights situation in Ukraine released by the\n\nOffice of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 15 April and 16\n\nMay 2014.\n\n2. During the reporting period, the human rights situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk\n\nregions has continued to deteriorate. The 11 March “referendum” on “self-rule” held by\n\nthe self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic”,1\n\nalbeit without effect under international law, was seen by their representatives as the\n\nfirst step to the creation of a “Novorossia”. In addition, armed groups have continued to\n\nphysically occupy most of the key public and administrative buildings in many cities\n\nand towns of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and have declared virtual\n\n“independence”, however, the provision of administrative services to the local\n\npopulation remains with the State.\n\n3. The presence of armed people and weapons in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk has\n\nincreased. Representatives of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” have recognised the\n\npresence within their armed groups of citizens of the Russian Federation, including\n\nfrom Chechnya and other republics of the North Caucasus. In the period following the\n\nelections, the HRMMU observed armed men on trucks and armoured vehicles moving\n\naround downtown Donetsk in daylight.\n\n4. The escalation in criminal activity resulting in human rights abuses is no longer limited\n\nto targeting journalists, elected representatives, local politicians, civil servants and civil\n\nsociety activists. Abductions, detentions, acts of ill-treatment and torture, and killings\n\nby armed groups are now affecting the broader population of the two eastern regions,\n\nwhich are now marked by an atmosphere of intimidation and consequent fear. Armed\n\ngroups must be urged to stop their illegal activities and lay down their arms.\n\n5. There has also been more regular and intense fighting as the Government has been\n\ntrying to restore peace and security over the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk\n\nthrough security operations involving its armed forces. Local residents of areas affected\n\nby the fighting are increasingly being caught in the cross-fire between the Ukrainian\n\nmilitary and armed groups, with a growing number of residents killed and wounded,\n\nand damage to property. The HRMMU is concerned at the increasing number of reports\n\nof enforced disappearances as a result of the security operations. The Government must\n\nfurther use restraint of force, and ensure that its security operations are at all times in\n\nline with international standards.2\n\n6. As a result of these developments, residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions live in\n\na very insecure environment, coupled with social and economic hardships. Daily life is\n\nmore and more of a challenge. The HRMMU is gravely concerned that the combination\n\nof the increased number of illegal acts by the armed groups, and the intensification of\n\nfighting between armed groups and Ukrainian forces is raising serious human rights\n\n1 Hereafter referred to as the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic”.\n\n2 Human Rights Watch Letter to former Acting President Turchynov and President-Elect Poroshenko dated 6\n\nJune 2014, on the conduct of security operations in south-eastern Ukraine in light of the growing number of\n\ncredible reports regarding Ukrainian forces’ use of mortars and other weapons in and around populated areas,\n\nand the recent intensifying of hostilities between Ukrainian forces and armed groups.\n\n4\n\nconcerns, including but not limited to, the fate of the general population, especially\n\nwomen and children, in the areas under the control of armed groups.\n\n7. As of 6 June, the departments of social protection in Ukraine’s regions had identified\n\nover 12,700 internally displaced persons (IDPs)3. However, the actual number of\n\npeople who have fled the violence and fighting in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk\n\nis believed to be higher and increasing daily.\n\n8. Freedom of expression continues to be threatened, particularly in the eastern regions,\n\nwhere journalists face ongoing intimidation and threats to their physical security. Hate\n\nspeech, particularly through social media, continue to fuel tensions and to deepen\n\ndivision between communities.\n\n9. In Crimea, the introduction of Russian Federation legislation, in contradiction with the\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly resolution 68/262 and applicable bodies of\n\ninternational law, hampers the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It\n\nhas created a legislative limbo as, while Ukrainian legislation was supposed to remain\n\nin force until 1 January 2015, the legal institutions and framework are already required\n\nto comply with the provisions of legislation of the Russian Federation.\n\n10. Residents in Crimea known for their “Pro-Ukrainian” position are intimidated. The\n\nHRMMU is concerned that many may face increasing discrimination, particularly in\n\nthe areas of education and employment. Leaders and activists of the indigenous\n\nCrimean Tatar people face prosecution and limitations on the enjoyment of their\n\ncultural rights. During the reporting period, the situation of all residents of Crimea has\n\ndeteriorated with regard to their right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly,\n\nassociation, religion or belief.\n\n11. From 14 to 19 May, Assistant Secretary-General (ASG) for Human Rights Ivan\n\nŠimonović travelled to Ukraine. During his visits to Kyiv, Donetsk and Odesa, he\n\ndiscussed the 16 May report with the Government, regional and local officials, the\n\nOmbudsperson and representatives of civil society, and the international community.\n\nThe ASG highlighted the importance of prompt follow-up to the recommendations\n\nmade in the OHCHR report as a means to de-escalate tensions, in particular ahead of\n\nthe Presidential elections.\n\n12. The investigations under the Office of the Prosecutor General into the Maidan events\n\ncontinued. On 28 May, a Kyiv court sentenced two police officers who subjected a\n\nMaidan demonstrator to ill-treatment. On 15 May, relatives of those killed on Maidan,\n\ndissatisfied with the perceived slowness of the official investigation, created an\n\ninitiative group to conduct their own investigation. The HRMMU remains in regular\n\ncontact with the Office of the Prosecutor General and emphasizes the need for the\n\ninvestigation to be transparent, comprehensive and timely.\n\n13. With respect to the incidents that took place in Odesa on 2 May, it should be noted that\n\nsix official investigations have been established. The main bodies undertaking such\n\ninvestigations are the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the State Security Service in\n\nUkraine (SBU). It is with regret that the HRMMU reports a lack of cooperation from\n\nboth governmental bodies, particularly at the central level with the HRMMU, which\n\nhas been preventing the HRMMU from conducting a proper assessment of the progress\n\n3 As of 16 June, UNHCR estimate there to be 34,336 IDPs in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Russian Federation Federal Migration Service, as of 6 June, 2014, 837 persons had applied\n\nand were granted refugee status; and 3,750 persons had applied and were granted Temporary Asylum.\n\nApproximately 15% were minors under the age of 18. These figures do not include people from Crimea.\n\n5\n\nmade. The HRMMU reiterates the need for prompt and thorough investigations into the\n\nviolent incidents on 2 May in Odesa. Some key questions must be addressed to ensure\n\nconfidence in the investigation and to guarantee accountability, due process and to\n\nenable the communities to accept fully the results of such an investigation. Among\n\nthose questions are the conduct of the police on 2 May: why it, and the fire brigade,\n\neither did not react, or were slow to react; what caused the fire in the Trade Union\n\nbuilding; who are the perpetrators of the killings in the afternoon and the fire in the\n\nevening; and what measures are being taken to guarantee justice for the victims, and\n\ndue process for the people detained in connection with these events. Furthermore, the\n\nGovernment must pay particular attention to ensure social media is not used for hate\n\nspeech or incitement to hatred.\n\n14. A key development during the reporting period was the Presidential election held on 25\n\nMay 2014. There were 21 candidates officially on the ballot. On 3 June, the Central\n\nElection Commission (CEC) confirmed that Mr. Petro Poroshenko had won with 54.7%\n\nof the vote. In the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, attacks had taken place every day\n\nduring the week preceding the elections and multiplied on election day, with violent\n\nobstruction of polling stations. The pattern of such attacks consisted of representatives\n\nof the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic” and armed\n\nmen entering the premises of the district election commissions, threatening staff and\n\nsometimes beating and/or abducting them, often taking away voters’ lists, computers\n\nand official documents. In some cases, the premises of these commissions were seized\n\nand blocked; others had to close either because they became inoperative, or for security\n\nreasons the staff were frightened to come back. Several attacks against district election\n\ncommissions and polling stations were reported just prior to, and on, the election day,\n\nwith armed men entering polling stations, forcing them to close and/or destroying or\n\nstealing ballot boxes. These illegal acts prevented many people living in the Donetsk\n\nand Luhansk regions to exercise their right to vote.\n\n15. Residents of Crimea had to go to mainland Ukraine to vote. The HRMMU monitored\n\nthe situation in the Kherson region, where most of the Crimean voters had registered,\n\nand spoke to representatives of the Crimean Tatars. As they crossed the administrative\n\nborder by car to go to vote, representatives of “self-defence forces” reportedly recorded\n\nvarious personal details, including car license plates and passport numbers. The\n\nHRMMU was informed that many Crimean Tatars did not go to vote due to the cost of\n\ntravelling, concerns about crossing the administrative border, and fear of reprisals by\n\nthe authorities in Crimea.\n\n16. During the reporting period, the Government of Ukraine continued to implement the\n\nGeneva Statement.4 National roundtables on constitutional reform, decentralization,\n\nminority rights and the rule of law were held in Kyiv on 14 May, in Kharkiv on 17\n\nMay, and in Mykolaiv on 21 May. These meetings brought together former Presidents\n\nKravchuk and Kuchma, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, political party leaders, members of\n\nthe business community and other civil society organizations. In Kharkiv, Prime\n\n4 The Geneva Statement on Ukraine was issued on 17 April 2014 by representatives of the European Union,\n\nUnited States, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. It sets out the agreed initial concrete steps to de-escalate\n\ntensions and restore security for all: (1) All sides must refrain from any violence, intimidation or provocative\n\nactions; (2) All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to\n\nlegitimate owners; all illegally occupied public offices must be vacated; (3) Amnesty should be granted to the\n\nprotestors who left seized buildings and surrendered weapons, with the exception of those found guilty of\n\ncapital crimes; and (4) The announced constitutional process will be inclusive, transparent and accountable\n\ncarried out through a broad national dialogue.\n\n6\n\nMinister Yatsenyuk declared that the Constitution should be amended in order to\n\nprovide a special status for the Russian language and national minority languages.\n\n17. On 13 May, the Parliament adopted the Law “On amending some legislative acts in the\n\narea of state anti-corruption policy in connection with the implementation of the\n\nEuropean Union (EU) Action Plan on the liberalisation of the visa regime for Ukraine”.\n\nThe Law provides for more stringent penalties for corruption offences committed by\n\nindividuals or legal entities.\n\n18. On 20 May, Parliament adopted by resolution № 4904 the Memorandum of Concord\n\nand Peace, which was drafted during the roundtable on national unity in Kharkiv on 17\n\nMay, and discussed on 21 May in Mykolaiv. Supported by 252 votes (all deputies\n\nexcept the Communist Party of Ukraine and Svoboda), the document foresees that the\n\nadoption of a constitutional reform package, including the decentralization of power\n\nand a special status for the Russian language; judicial and police reform, and the\n\nadoption of an amnesty law for anti-government protesters in the east who would\n\naccept giving up weapons, except for those who have committed serious crimes against\n\nlife and physical integrity. The Parliament called on all to work together to protect,\n\npromote and build a democratic Ukraine, and the peaceful coexistence of all\n\nnationalities, religions and political convictions.\n\nII. METHODOLOGY\n\n19. The present report was prepared by the HRMMU on the basis of information collected\n\nduring the period of 7 May to 7 June 2014. During this period, the HRMMU continued\n\nto operate pursuant to the objectives as set out at the time of its deployment in March\n\n2014, and in accordance with the same methodology as outlined in its second monthly\n\nreport on the situation of human rights in Ukraine issued by OHCHR on 16 May.5 The\n\npresent report does not intend to present an exhaustive account of all human rights\n\nconcerns in Ukraine that have been followed by HRMMU during the reporting period.\n\nIt rather focuses on those violations and developments which represent particular\n\nhuman rights challenges at the current juncture or demonstrate trends for potentially\n\nlonger-term human rights concerns in the country.\n\n20. The HRMMU continued to work closely with the United Nations entities in Ukraine. It\n\nis grateful for the support and contributions received for the report from the Office of\n\nthe United Nations Resident Coordinator, the Department for Political Affairs (DPA),\n\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Health\n\nOrganisation (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\n\nNations Development Fund (UNDP), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United\n\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\n\n(UNODC), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the International Organisation\n\nfor Migration (IOM), and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n(OCHA).\n\n21. The HRMMU appreciates the close cooperation with international and national\n\npartners, including among others, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in\n\nEurope (OSCE).\n\n5 http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/HRMMUReport15May2014.pdf\n\n7\n\nIII. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\nA. Investigations into human rights violations related to Maidan protests\n\n22. Five separate initiatives are ongoing in connection with the investigations into human\n\nrights violations committed during the Maidan events: (1) the official State\n\ninvestigation is undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in\n\ncooperation with the MoI; (2) a temporary “commission on the investigation of illegal\n\nactions of the law enforcement bodies and individual officials and attacks on the rights\n\nand freedoms, lives and health of citizens during the events connected with the mass\n\nactions of political and civil protests that have been taking place in Ukraine since 21\n\nNovember 2013” was established by Parliament on 26 December 2013; (3) the\n\nSecretary-General of the Council of Europe initiated, in December 2013, a threemember\n\nInternational Advisory Panel to oversee that the investigations of the violent\n\nincidents which have taken place in Ukraine from November 2013 onwards meet the\n\nrequirements of the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights; (4) a Public Commission on the investigation and\n\nprevention of human rights violations in Ukraine was created on 27 January 2014,\n\ninitiated by a group of Ukrainian legal academics; and (5) an initiative group\n\ncomprising family members of people who died on Maidan.\n\n23. The Ukrainian Ombudsperson issued a special report on “Infringement of Human\n\nRights and Freedoms in Ukraine - The Events of November 2013 – February 2014’.6\n\nForceful dispersal of Maidan protesters on 30 November 2013\n\n24. As noted in the previous reports, the violent dispersal of protesters on 30 November\n\nwas the first instance of the excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators, and\n\ntriggered further protests.\n\n25. On 14 May, the Kyiv Pechersky Court postponed a hearing of Oleksandr Popov, former\n\nHead of the Kyiv City administration, and of Volodymyr Sivkovych, former Deputy\n\nSecretary of the National Security and Defence Council, who are under suspicion of\n\nbeing responsible for the forced dispersal of Maidan protesters on the night of 30\n\nNovember 2013. The hearing was scheduled after the Kyiv city Court of Appeal\n\ncancelled the decision of the Kyiv Pechersky Court of 31 January 2014 to amnesty\n\npersons responsible for ordering the crackdown of demonstrators by the “Berkut” riot\n\npolice under the law of 19 December, which has since then been rescinded.\n\n26. The hearing planned for 14 May eventually took place on 26 May but was followed by\n\nan incident. About 15 members of the “Maidan self-defence” attacked Oleksandr Popov\n\nafter he left the court room. He was doused with water, alcohol and iodine, and\n\ninsulted. Members of the police, who were standing by, did not intervene.\n\n27. During the following hearing, on 5 June, the plaintiffs (representing Maidan victims)\n\nsubmitted a petition for the revocation of the judge considering the case. The petition\n\nwas accepted by the court, leading to the postponement of the hearings until a decision\n\non the revocation.\n\n6 Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Special Report on ‘Infringement of Human Rights and\n\nFreedoms in Ukraine - The events of November 2013 – February 2014’, issued on 28 February, 2014.\n\n8\n\nCriminal proceedings into the killings of 19-21 January and 18-20 February 2014\n\n28. During 19-21 January 2014, fierce clashes broke out in central Kyiv between the police\n\nand protesters, resulting in the first three casualties among demonstrators. The death\n\ntoll rose significantly between 18-20 February, with confrontations taking the lives of\n\ndozens of persons, mostly protesters.\n\n29. Different figures continue being reported regarding the number of deaths during the\n\nprotests in January and February. According to information from the Office of the\n\nProsecutor General communicated to the HRMMU on 27 May, 76 protesters were\n\nkilled as a result of firearm wounds on Hrushevskoho and Institutska streets due to\n\narmed confrontations. On 21 May, the Ministry of Health announced that 106\n\ndemonstrators had died during the protests. Information from the NGO “Euromaidan\n\nSOS”, dated 3 June, refers to 113 casualties among protesters (109 in Kyiv and 4 in the\n\nregions).\n\n30. There are also discrepancies concerning casualties among law enforcement officers: 14\n\naccording to the Office of the Prosecutor General; 17 according to the Investigation\n\nCommission of the Parliament of Ukraine on the Maidan events; and 20 according to\n\nthe NGO “Euromaidan SOS”.\n\n31. For investigation purposes, all the killings of protesters by firearms were merged by the\n\nOffice of the General Prosecutor into one criminal proceeding. As of 24 April, three\n\n“Berkut” officers had been arrested and officially charged with Article 115 (Murder) of\n\nthe Criminal Code. The situation has not changed over the past month and a half. The\n\nkilling of law enforcement officers is being investigated by a separate team within the\n\nOffice of the Prosecutor General. As of 6 June, no suspects had been identified.\n\n32. On 20 May, the deputy head of the Kyiv Department of the MoI, Sergiy Boyko,\n\ndeclared that all documentation related to the activities of the special police unit\n\n“Berkut” during Maidan had been destroyed upon the order of the unit commander in\n\nthe last days of February 2014.\n\n33. On 5 June, the HRMMU met with a representative of an initiative group claiming to\n\nrepresent about 320 relatives of people killed on Maidan. The group held its first\n\nmeeting on 15-16 May, and is planning to initiate an independent investigation into the\n\nevents, with the involvement of lawyers and journalists. They consider their initiative\n\nas necessary as they are not satisfied with the ongoing investigations. The group, which\n\nplans to register an NGO entitled “Family Maidan” also intends to support families of\n\nMaidan victims.\n\n34. On 21 May, the Head of the Parliamentary Investigation Commission on the Maidan\n\nevents reported that two persons who had participated in the protests were still missing.\n\nEleven persons suspected in the killing of demonstrators have been identified, of whom\n\nthree were arrested and eight remain at large, allegedly in the Russian Federation. The\n\nCommission is seeking to obtain full and reliable information on violations during\n\nMaidan and will forward evidence to the General Prosecutor’s Office. It has a one-year\n\nmandate and must issue a report to Parliament no later than six months after its\n\nestablishment that is by 26 June 2014.\n\n35. The International Advisory Panel (IAP) of the Council of Europe overseeing the\n\nMaidan investigations held two working sessions in Strasbourg on 9-11 April and 5-7\n\nMay 2014. On 16 May, it issued guidelines for NGO submissions and requested input\n\nby 11 June 2014. It also decided to request ‘certain authorities’ to submit information\n\n9\n\nmainly concerning the Maidan investigations. The first meetings of the IAP in Kyiv\n\nwill take place at the end of June 2014.\n\nTorture and ill-treatment\n\n36. On 28 May, the Kyiv Pechersky Court sentenced two police officers for abuse of power\n\nand violence against a demonstrator, Mykhailo Havrylyuk, during the Maidan protests.\n\nMr. Havrylyuk had been stripped naked in the street by the police in freezing\n\nconditions and forced to stand in the snow while being mocked, assaulted and filmed\n\nwith a mobile phone. During the hearings, the defendants pleaded guilty. One of them\n\nwas sentenced to three years of imprisonment with a probation period of one year, and\n\nthe other to two years, including a one-year probation period.\n\nB. Investigations into human rights violations related to 2 May Odesa violence\n\nSummary of events\n\n37. The most serious single incident of significant loss of life in Ukraine since the killings\n\non Maidan occurred in Odesa on 2 May 2014.7 The events occurred on the same day\n\nthat a football match was due to take place between the Kharkiv football team\n\n“Metallist” and the Odesa football team “Chernomorets”. On 1 May, the police\n\nauthorities issued an official statement announcing that due to possible disorder\n\nbecause of the football game, an additional 2,000 police officers would patrol the\n\nstreets of Odesa.\n\n38. Early in the morning of 2 May, at least 600 football fans arrived from Kharkiv. Football\n\nfans from both teams are known to have strong “Pro-Unity”8 sympathies. A pre-match\n\nrally for “United Ukraine” had been planned for 3.00 p.m. on Sobornaya square and\n\ngathered, at least, 2,000 people, including supporters of the two football teams, Right\n\nSector activists, members of so-called self-defence units, and other “Pro-Unity”\n\nsupporters. Right Sector and “self-defence” unit supporters were observed by the\n\nHRMMU wearing helmets and masks, and armed with shields, axes, wooden/metallic\n\nsticks and some with firearms. By 3:00 p.m. the HRMMU had observed 15 police\n\nofficers on Sobornaya square and two buses of riot police officers parked nearby.\n\n39. Meanwhile, the HRMMU observed that about 450 metres away from Sobornaya street,\n\n“Pro-Federalism” activists, comprising approximately 300 activists from “Odesskaya\n\nDruzhina” (radical “Pro-Federalism” movement), had also gathered one hour earlier.\n\nThey reportedly intended to prevent the “Pro-Unity” rally; and were wearing helmets,\n\nshields, masks, axes, wooden/metal sticks and some of them with firearms.\n\n40. The HRMMU observed an insufficient and inadequate police presence to manage and\n\nensure security, and crowd control of the “United Ukraine” march towards the football\n\nstadium. The HRMMU noted that additional police officers arrived at the scene, but\n\nwere unable to stop the violent confrontation.\n\n41. At 3.15 p.m., the “Pro-Federalism Odesskaya Drujina”, “Narodnaya Drujina” and other\n\nactivists approached the Sobornaya square and started to provoke the participants of the\n\n“United Ukraine” rally. Clashes arose and quickly turned into mass disorder, which\n\n7 See also OHCHR report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, 15 May 2014\n\n(http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/HRMMUReport15May2014.pdf)\n\n8 The terms “Pro-Unity” and “Pro-Federalism” are used in the context as describing the motivations and\n\norientation of the supporters / activists.\n\n10\n\nlasted for several hours until 6.30 p.m. Police officers and supporters from both sides\n\nwere injured during the afternoon. Six men were killed by gunshots fired by activists.\n\n42. The HRMMU observed that following the clashes in the city centre, some “Pro-\n\nFederalism” activists ran from the area chased by “Pro-Unity” supporters.\n\nApproximately 60 “Pro-Federalism” activists took refuge in the “Afina” shopping\n\ncentre, which had been closed during the day. The “Afina” shopping centre was then\n\nsurrounded by “Pro-Unity” activists. Riot police (Special Forces “SOKOL”) arrived on\n\nthe scene, and reportedly took away 47 “Pro-Federalism” activists, while letting women\n\nout of the complex. Other “Pro-Federalism” supporters ran from the clashes to the tent\n\ncamp at the Kulikovo Pole square, where approximately 200 supporters had gathered\n\n(including all the “Pro-Federalism” leaders) during the afternoon.\n\n43. Some “Pro-Unity” politicians called upon their supporters to march towards the\n\nKulikovo Pole square. At 7.00 p.m., the “Pro-Unity” supporters marched in that\n\ndirection, accompanied behind them by approximately 60 riot police.\n\n44. The “Pro-Federalism” leaders were informed that “Pro-Unity” supporters were heading\n\ntowards the tent camp, and between 6.00 – 6.30 p.m., they decided to take refuge in the\n\nnearby Trade Union Building.\n\n45. At 7.30 p.m., when the “Pro-Unity” supporters reached Kulikovo Pole square, they\n\nburned all the “Pro-Federalism” tents. The “Pro-Federalism” activists, who had hidden\n\nin the Trade Union Building, and the “Pro-Unity” activists, then reportedly started\n\nthrowing Molotov cocktails at each other. Gunshots could reportedly be heard coming\n\nfrom both sides. At around 8.00 p.m., the “Pro-Unity” activists entered the Trade Union\n\nBuilding where the “Pro-Federalism” supporters had sought refuge.\n\n46. During the evening a fire broke out in the Trade Union Building. At 7.43 p.m., the\n\nHRMMU called the fire brigade, which has its base located 650 metres from the Trade\n\nUnion Building. Reportedly, the fire brigade only arrived 40 minutes after receiving the\n\nfirst phone call about the fire. According to fire brigade officials, this was due to the\n\nfact that the police did not create a safe and secure perimeter allowing the fire brigade\n\nto easily access the Trade Union Building. The cause of the fire remains unclear at this\n\nstage.\n\n47. As a result of the fire, officially 42 people died: 32 (including 6 females) were trapped\n\nand unable to leave the building and 10 (including one female and one minor) died\n\njumping from windows.\n\n48. The HRMMU has received information from credible resources that some “Pro-Unity”\n\nprotesters were beating up “Pro-Federalism” supporters as they were trying to escape\n\nthe Trade Union Building, while others were trying to help them.\n\n49. 247 other people were brought from the scene requiring medical assistance: 27 people\n\nwith gunshot wounds, 31 with stab wounds, 26 with burns and intoxication caused by\n\ncombustible products and 163 with injuries by blunt objects. Of these, 99 people were\n\nhospitalised, including 22 policemen, with 35 in serious condition. According to\n\nvarious sources, all those who died were Ukrainian citizens. There are no more official\n\nreports of people missing in relation to 2 May events. Seven of those injured remain in\n\nhospital. The HRMMU received allegations that many who were treated in hospitals\n\ndid not give their real names and addresses. Moreover, some people who were heavily\n\ninjured from the violence did not go to hospital for fear of retaliation.\n\n11\n\n50. During the evening, it was reported to the HRMMU that a bare minimum police force\n\nwas present at the Kulikovo Pole square. Even when the special riot police force\n\narrived at the scene, the officers did not intervene in the violence that took place on the\n\nKulikovo Pole square. The HRMMU was told by high ranking police officers that the\n\nreason for this is that they did not receive any formal order to intervene.\n\nDetentions\n\n51. The HRMMU has noted slight discrepancies regarding the number of people\n\narrested/detained/transferred during, and in the aftermath of, the 2 May violence. The\n\nRegional Prosecution Office and the Regional Ministry of Interior present different\n\nfigures relating to these events. For example, figures for those arrested in the centre of\n\ntown vary from 42 to 47 people, and figures for those arrested at the Trade Union\n\nBuilding from 63 to 67 people.\n\n52. Criminal investigations have been launched under the following articles of the Criminal\n\nCode of Ukraine: Article 115/1 (Intentional homicide); Article 194/2 (Intentional\n\ndestruction or damage of property); Article 294/2 (Mass riots/unrest); Article 296\n\n(Hooliganism); Article 341/2 (Capturing of the state or public buildings or\n\nconstructions); Article 345 (Threat or violence against a law enforcement officer),\n\nArticle 365 (Excess of authority or official powers) and Article 367 (Neglect of official\n\nduty).\n\n53. The 47 “Pro-Federalism” activists who took refuge in the “Afina” shopping centre were\n\ntaken away (for so-called protection reasons) by Police Special Forces “SOKOL” and\n\ntransferred to two police stations outside Odesa (Ovidiopol and Bilhorod-Dnistrovkyi)\n\nwhere they were detained for two days.\n\n54. During this 48 hour period in police custody, detainees were not given food or water on\n\na regular basis, nor were they provided a one-hour walk per day, as per internal MoI\n\nregulations9.\n\n55. On 4 May, all 47 detainees were transferred to Vinnitsa (424 km from Odesa).\n\nAccording to information provided to the HRMMU by credible sources, during the\n\ntransfer, which lasted for 12 hours, they received neither food nor water, nor were they\n\nallowed to use toilet facilities (they had to urinate in the detainees van). According to\n\nUkrainian internal regulations, detainees during transfer should receive food and water.\n\n56. On 6 May, video court hearings of the “Pro-Federalism” activists were organised with\n\nthe Primorsky District Court of Odesa. All were charged with Article 294 (Mass riots)\n\nand/or Article 115 (Intentional homicide) of the Criminal Code; and during the\n\nfollowing days some were given additional criminal charges of either: Article 194/2\n\n(Intentional destruction or damage of property); Article 296 (Hooliganism); Article\n\n341/2 (Capturing of the state or public buildings or constructions); or Article 345\n\n(Threat or violence against a law enforcement officer). According to the court\n\ndecisions of the 47 arrested, 14 were placed in the Vinnitsa pre-trial detention centre.\n\nFour of these, after appealing the court decision, were placed under house arrest and\n\nhave since reportedly returned to Odesa. 33 of the 47 individuals originally arrested\n\nwere placed under house arrest as of 10 June 2014. Late in the evening of 2 May, 67\n\npeople were arrested at the Trade Union Building and transferred to the Odesa City\n\nPolice Station, where they were detained for two days. On 2 and 3 May, all were\n\n9 Ministry of Interior regulation Number 60 dated 20/01/2001: warm food three times per day, and one hour\n\nwalk per day.\n\n12\n\ncharged with either Articles 115 (Intentional homicide) or Article 294 (Mass riots) of\n\nthe Criminal Code. On 4 May at 5.00 p.m., the Odesa City Police Station was stormed\n\nby relatives and friends of the “Pro-Federalism” movement. Under unclear\n\ncircumstances all of the 67 detainees were “released” by the police.\n\n57. In addition to those arrested on 2 May, the MoI arrested at least four other people. On 6\n\nMay, one of the leaders of the “Pro-Federalism” movement was arrested and charged\n\nunder Article 294 of the Criminal Code. He is currently detained in a pre-trial detention\n\ncentre. On 18 May, a “Pro-Unity” activist was arrested, accused of firing at, and\n\ninjuring several people in the city centre on 2 May, including police officers, “Pro-\n\nFederalism” activists and journalists. He was first transferred to the Investigation\n\nDepartment of Odesa Regional Police Office, before being transferred to Kyiv. He is\n\naccused under Article 115 (Murder) and Article 294-2 (Mass riots) of the Criminal\n\nCode and on 21 May, he was placed under house arrest in Odesa by the Kyiv Pechersky\n\nDistrict Court.\n\n58. Of the arrests conducted between 2 May and 3 June, in connection with the\n\ninvestigations into the 2 May violence, 13 persons remain in pre-trial detention centres\n\nunder the Penitentiary Services (either in Vinnitsa, Odesa or Kyiv) charged with one or\n\nmore of the following six articles of the Criminal Code: Article 115/1 (Intentional\n\nhomicide); Article 194/2 (Intentional destruction or damage of property); Article 294/2\n\n(Mass riots/unrest); Article 296 (Hooliganism); Article 341/2 (Capturing of the state or\n\npublic buildings or constructions); and Article 345 (Threat or violence against law\n\nenforcement officer).\n\n59. In addition, reportedly 40 people were placed under house arrest in Odesa charged with\n\nthe following articles of the Criminal Code: Article 115/1 (Intentional homicide);\n\nArticle 194/2 (Intentional destruction or damage of property; Article 294/2 (Mass\n\nriots/unrest); Article 296 (Hooliganism); Article 341/2 (Capturing of the state or public\n\nbuildings or constructions); and Article 345 (Threat or violence against law\n\nenforcement officer).\n\n60. Two cases concerning “Pro-Unity” activists suspected of shooting and killing persons\n\nduring the 2 May violence, were heard by the Pechersky District Court of Kyiv,\n\nfollowing the arrest of two suspects on 18 and 26 May. Both were given house arrest;\n\nboth are charged under Article 294 (Mass riots), and one has been additionally charged\n\nunder Article 115 (Murder) of the Criminal Code.\n\nDue process rights during, and after, the 2 May violence\n\n61. The HRMMU visited detainees held in the pre-trial detention centre in Odesa. The\n\nPenitentiary Services administration fully cooperated with the HRMMU and granted\n\naccess to several detainees (including one female) with whom private interviews were\n\ncarried out. The detainees did not complain about their conditions of detention or\n\nphysical treatment in the pre-trial detention centre in Odesa. They confirmed they were\n\nable to meet privately with their lawyers.\n\n62. The HRMMU also met with lawyers, victims, witnesses, detainees and relatives with\n\nregard to the 2 May violence. It also held numerous meetings with the\n\nOmbudsperson’s team, as well as representatives of law enforcement agencies, mass\n\nmedia, local politicians and officials, activists and local officials. Through its\n\nmonitoring, the HRMMU has identified various human rights concerns with regard to\n\nthe on-going criminal investigations, which include some of the following.\n\n13\n\nTimely notification of reasons for arrest and charges within short period of time\n\n63. On 15 May, the SBU apprehended five additional people. Although this took place at\n\n9.00 a.m., the official arrest time has been recorded as 11.50 p.m. – over 12 hours later.\n\nAccording to Article 208/4 of the Criminal Procedure Code ‘a competent official who\n\napprehended the person, shall be required to immediately inform the apprehended\n\nperson, in a language known to him, of the grounds for the apprehension and of the\n\ncommission of what crime he is suspected’. Furthermore, the procedure applied for the\n\narrest was not in line with Articles 9.2 and 9.3 of the International Covenant on Civil\n\nand Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\n64. Similarly eight people apprehended by the SBU on 27 May at the Odesa railway station\n\ndid not receive prompt notification of the reasons for their arrest.\n\nRight to a fair trial\n\n65. Law enforcement agencies resorted to an illegal practice in order to prevent prompt\n\naccess to legal counsel. Indeed, during criminal interrogation procedures, police and\n\nSBU officers summoned individuals as “witness” and later then substituted their status\n\nas “suspect” and/or substituted their interrogation by interviewing. This resulted in\n\nviolating the persons’ right to see and consult a legal counsel (as provided for in Article\n\n208/4 of the Criminal Procedural Code) and gave an opportunity to “delay” the official\n\ntime of apprehension.\n\n66. For instance, the eight people who were arrested by the SBU at the Odesa railway\n\nstation were transferred to the SBU for an alleged “interview”. They were not informed\n\nabout their rights with regard to apprehension, nor were they provided with legal\n\ncounsel, nor could they contact their lawyers before and during interrogation.\n\n67. The HRMMU observed, based on interviews with detainees and their relatives, that the\n\ngovernmental Free Legal Aid scheme (established in connection with the new Criminal\n\nProcedural Code of November 2012) encountered gaps in its system. For the legal\n\ndefence of detainees arrested during and after 2 May violence, the Free Legal Aid\n\nsystem could not provide enough lawyers.\n\n68. As of 4 June, the legal status of the 67 “detainees” released on 4 May from Odesa city\n\nPolice Station remained unclear. Due to procedural gaps following their alleged illegal\n\nrelease (i.e. without a court decision), they remain suspects. The measure of restraint\n\nwas not applied to them as required in accordance with the Criminal Procedural Code.\n\nRight to medical care\n\n69. In Ovidiopol and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Police Stations medical care was not provided\n\nto those among the 47 detainees who required such assistance due to illness. The\n\nrelatives of detainees placed in custody in the Vinnitsa pre-trial detention centre also\n\nreported about the lack of medical care provided to their kin.\n\nPersonal data\n\n70. Concerns have been raised with the HRMMU that on 19 May, the presumption of\n\ninnocence may have been violated during an official press conference of the MoI, by\n\nthe Deputy Minister of Interior/Head of Main Investigation Unit by disclosing personal\n\ndata of 12 detainees. The HRMMU reminds the authorities of the importance of\n\nrespecting international standards concerning the presumption of innocence and the\n\nprohibition of arbitrary interference with one’s privacy or attacks upon his/her honour\n\nand reputation.\n\n14\n\n71. Also on 3 May, the SBU published the names and passports of three citizens from the\n\nRussian Federation allegedly involved in the 2 May violence.\n\nLegality of arrest\n\n72. On 15 May, the SBU conducted an illegal search of an apartment from 8.00 p.m. to\n\n3.00 a.m., without a search warrant and without preparing a report/protocol on the\n\nsearch. During the search, they broke the door, forced the family, including a girl to lie\n\ndown on the floor. A woman (wife/mother) was subsequently arrested and taken to the\n\nSBU Office. The next day she was transferred to the Odesa Police Station. On 17 May,\n\nthe Primorsky District Court placed her in custody under Articles 294 (Mass riots) and\n\n110 (Trespass against territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine) of the Criminal\n\nCode. She is currently detained in Odesa pre-trial detention centre.\n\nAccountability: Update on investigations into the Odesa incidents\n\n73. Six official investigations have been initiated to look into the incidents of 2 May in\n\nOdesa and are ongoing: 1) a criminal investigation by the MoI; 2) an investigation of\n\nthe General Prosecution Investigation Unit into police conduct; 3) a criminal\n\ninvestigation by the SBU into alleged state level crimes (including actions aimed at\n\nforceful change or overthrow of the constitutional order); 4) an investigation by the\n\nOmbudsperson; 5) an investigation by the Parliamentary Commission; and 6) an\n\ninvestigation by a commission comprising civil society representatives under the\n\nauspices of the Governor. During his visit in May, ASG Šimonović met with\n\ninterlocutors involved in these various investigations.\n\n74. These parallel investigations by different bodies present a high risk of\n\nmiscommunication between the various law enforcement agencies’ commissions,\n\nwhich may impact the integrity of the criminal investigations. Furthermore, there\n\nappear to be widespread concerns among citizens regarding the ability of local law\n\nenforcement agencies to conduct independent and thorough investigations due to the\n\npoliticisation of the 2 May events. The day after the violence, the former acting\n\nPresident dismissed several local high-ranking officials on the grounds of Article 365\n\n(Excess of authority or official powers) and Article 367 (Neglect of official duty) of the\n\nCriminal Code). An interim government and new officials were appointed at the local\n\nlevel: the Governor of Odesa, the Head of the Regional MoI, the Head of the Odesa\n\nCity Police, and the Head of the Regional Prosecution Office.\n\nGovernmental Commission on the issues of numerous deaths of people during\n\n“Pro-Ukrainian” protests and fire in the Trade Union Building in Odesa City\n\n75. During the late evening of 2 May, Vice-Prime Minister Vitalii Yarema was appointed\n\nHead of the Governmental Commission on the issues of numerous deaths of people\n\nduring “Pro-Ukrainian” protests and the fire in the Trade Union Building in Odesa City,\n\nwhich is responsible for overseeing the investigation carried out by the law\n\nenforcement agencies at the Odesa regional and city level. The HRMMU has officially\n\nrequested to meet with this Commission, but had not received a response as of 7 June\n\n2014.\n\nCriminal investigation by the Ministry of Interior Investigation Unit\n\n76. On 2 May, a criminal investigation was launched by the Odesa Regional Police\n\nInvestigation Department. On 6 May, the responsibility for the investigation was\n\ntransferred to the Main Investigation Department of the MoI in Kyiv (under the lead of\n\nDeputy Minister of Interior). According to the law, the investigation process should be\n\n15\n\ncompleted in 60 days. Investigators from Kyiv, Odesa and other regions are\n\ncooperating on this investigation, which has been launched under the following articles\n\nof the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Article 115/1 (Intentional homicide); Article 194/2\n\n(Intentional destruction or damage of property; Article 294/2 (Mass riots/unrest);\n\nArticle 296 (Hooliganism); Article 341/2 (Capturing of the state or public buildings or\n\nconstructions); and Article 345 (Threat or violence against law enforcement officer).\n\nGeneral Prosecution Investigation Unit regarding police duty performance\n\n77. On 3 May, the Odesa Regional Prosecutor Office launched a criminal case against four\n\npolice officials under Article 365 (Excess of authority or official powers) and Article\n\n367 (Neglect of official duty) of the Criminal code. On 6 May, this investigation was\n\ntransferred to the Investigation Unit of the General Prosecutor.\n\n78. According to information provided to the HRMMU by credible sources, the regional\n\nMoI did not enforce the special police tactical plan called “Wave” (“Khvylia”), which\n\nwould have allowed the use of special police means and forces, and ensured\n\ncoordination of all official emergency units (e.g. health, and the department of\n\nemergency situations).\n\n79. Furthermore, there are credible reports that during the 2 May violence, all high ranking\n\nofficials from the Regional MoI and Regional Prosecutor’s Office were holding a\n\nmeeting and were unavailable.\n\n80. Since then, several criminal proceedings have been initiated against high-ranking police\n\nofficials and policemen. The Deputy Head of the Regional MoI was placed under house\n\narrest in relation with the 2 May violence and the “release” of the 67 detainees held in\n\nthe Odesa Police Station on 4 May. His current whereabouts remain unknown but he is\n\nthought to be outside Ukraine. On 8 May, the Head of the Odesa City Police, the Head\n\nof the Odesa Police Detention Centre and the duty officer were apprehended and\n\ntransferred to Kyiv. On 9 May, the Head of the Odesa City Police was released on bail.\n\nBoth The Head of the Odesa Police Detention Centre and the duty officer were also\n\nreleased under obligations to make a personal commitment not to leave Ukraine.\n\nCriminal investigation under the State Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)\n\n81. In mid-March, the SBU initiated a criminal investigation throughout the country under\n\nArticles 109 (Actions aimed at forceful change or overthrow of the constitutional order\n\nor take-over of government) and 110 (Trespass against territorial integrity and\n\ninviolability of Ukraine) of the Criminal Code in relation to threats to national security\n\nand national integrity. As of 15 May, the SBU arrested several people in Odesa region.\n\nAccording to the HRMMU informal sources, 18 people were placed under investigation\n\nby the SBU and detained in the Odesa pre-trial detention centre between 2 May and 3\n\nJune.\n\n82. On 15 May, the SBU arrested five people (four male and one female) who were\n\nallegedly leaving the Odesa region to join armed groups in eastern Ukraine. The\n\nwoman was placed under house arrest. Later that day another female “Pro-Federalism”\n\nsupporter, allegedly the organiser of the expedition, was arrested and placed in pre-trial\n\ndetention in Odesa. One more person was arrested the following day in connection with\n\nthe same case. As of 7 June, the HRMMU had no information on his whereabouts.\n\n83. On 27 May, eight men were arrested at the Odesa railway station from a train about to\n\ndepart for Moscow. The SBU stated that these people were planning to attend a\n\n“paramilitary training” in Moscow before joining the armed groups in eastern Ukraine.\n\n16\n\nOn 29 May, the Primorsky District Court charged all of them under Articles 109\n\n(Actions aimed at forceful change or overthrow of the constitutional order or take-over\n\nof government) and 110 (Trespass against territorial integrity and inviolability of\n\nUkraine) of the Criminal Code. They have been placed in custody in the pre-trial\n\ndetention centre in Odesa. One more person was arrested the following day in\n\nconnection with the same case. As of 7 June, the HRMMU had no updated information\n\non his whereabouts.\n\n84. On 28 May, three men, members of the NGO \"Orthodox Cossacks\", were arrested in\n\nOdesa and on 31 May, they were charged by the Primorsky District Court under\n\nArticles 109 and 110 of the Criminal Code, and placed in custody at the pre-trial\n\ndetention centre in Odesa.\n\nParliamentary Interim Commission of inquiry into the investigation of the death of\n\ncitizens in the cities of Odesa, Mariupol and other cities of the Donetsk and Luhansk\n\nregions of Ukraine.\n\n85. On 13 May, the Parliament adopted decision 4852 establishing an” Interim Inquiry\n\nParliamentary Commission on the investigation of the death of citizens in the cities of\n\nOdesa, Mariupol and other cities of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine”,\n\nfurther to a proposal by parliamentarians representing the Odesa region. The mandate\n\nof this Commission expires on 15 June, by which date it is to submit its report to\n\nParliament.\n\n86. The Commission informed the HRMMU that it had already gathered a lot of\n\ninformation on the violence of 2 May in Odesa, which should be properly analysed and\n\nprocessed. According to the Head of the Parliamentary Commission, its members met\n\nwith officials from Odesa, including the regional SBU divisions, MoI, Prosecutor’s\n\nOffice, independent experts, NGOs and suspects under house arrest. He believes many\n\npeople are still frightened by the events with some afraid to share important\n\ninformation. Moreover, he highlighted that the situation in Odesa is not stable yet, and\n\nit is important to optimise the activities of law enforcement bodies in the investigation.\n\nAccording to him, the criminal investigation by the MoI had only conducted\n\napproximately 7% of the necessary work. The perpetrators of the Odesa events have\n\nstill not been identified, with some suspects detained for a few days and then released\n\nby courts. From information gathered by the Commission, there is much questioning\n\nwithin local communities as to why this happened. There is also a fear that the local\n\npopulation will use reprisals against suspected persons for the restoration of justice.\n\nThus, according to the Head of the Commission, the Special Interim Parliamentary\n\nCommission has intensified its contacts with the local community representatives.\n\nInvestigation by the Ombudsperson’s Office\n\n87. The Ombudsperson’s Office initiated an evaluation on human rights violations by law\n\nenforcement agencies during the 2 May violence in Odesa. The Ombudsperson and her\n\nteam visited Odesa on several occasions and were provided with official documents\n\nfrom all law enforcement agencies.10\n\n10 The Ombudsperson submitted a report of her findings to the Prosecutor General on 10 June 2014. It is not a\n\npublic document.\n\n17\n\nCommission investigating the 2 May violence\n\n88. A commission was established under the auspices of the Head of the Odesa Regional\n\nState Administration (Governor). This commission, which includes civil society\n\nactivists, journalists and experts, is conducting its own investigation and intends to play\n\na public oversight role concerning the official investigation.\n\n89. The commission members are undertaking their work through open sources, without\n\ninterfering with the official investigation. It is foreseen that their conclusions will be\n\npublished only if all members agree on its content. A first official briefing took place\n\non 30 May.\n\nSpecialised Headquarters providing assistance in the aftermath of 2 May\n\n90. In the aftermath of the 2 May events, the former acting Mayor of Odesa established an\n\nemergency headquarters (HQ) encompassing various departments of the City Council\n\nExecutive Committee. It provided assistance to victims and their relatives, such\n\nhealthcare, information, social services. It also ran an emergency hotline in the\n\naftermath of 2 May incidents. The HRMMU has been in daily contact with the staff on\n\nfollow-up required, and to enquire about the situation of the victims, particularly\n\nmedical care and the list of those declared missing. As of 7 June, the Social Welfare\n\nDepartment remained the only operational part of this emergency HQ.\n\n91. After the 2 May violence the HRMMU has been monitoring the criminal proceedings\n\nlaunched by the Office of the General Prosecutor, the MoI and the SBU.\n\n92. As the investigations continue, some key questions must be addressed to ensure\n\nconfidence in the investigation and to guarantee accountability, due process and to\n\nenable the communities to fully accept the results of such an investigation. Issues to be\n\nclarified include:\n\na. the identification of the perpetrators who were shooting at protesters during\n\nthe afternoon;\n\nb. the conduct of the police on 2 May - why the police and the fire brigade either\n\ndid not react, or were slow to react and who ordered what action;\n\nc. what happened in the Trade Union Building and what caused the fire there;\n\nd. what was the cause of the deaths in the Trade Union Building;\n\ne. the identification of the perpetrators of the incidents and violence surrounding\n\nthe fire in the Trade Union Building;\n\nf. the need to guarantee justice for the victims and due process for the detainees.\n\n92. The HRMMU regretfully reports the lack of cooperation from the MoI and the SBU at\n\nthe central level.\n\n93. The HRMMU reiterates the need for prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into\n\nthe events so as to ensure accountability of all those concerned and to provide redress\n\nand reparations for victims and their families. This process is critical to restore people’s\n\nconfidence in the authorities.\n\nC. Investigation into other human rights violations\n\n94. The HRMMU continues to follow closely the investigation into the human rights\n\nviolations that occurred in March in 2014 in Kharkiv, including into the “Rymarska\n\ncase”, a clash between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian organizations “Oplot” and\n\n“Patriots of Ukraine” on 13 March. On 7 May, it was confirmed that the case had been\n\ntransferred from the police to the SBU. Investigations were opened in connection with\n\n18\n\nthe role of the police in this case, as well as during the attack by protesters against the\n\nATN TV station on 7 April. On 5 June, the Deputy Head of the regional SBU informed\n\nthe HRMMU that the investigation into “Rymarska case” was ongoing - there were two\n\nsuspects, who still had to be detained. The challenging aspect of the investigation is that\n\nmany minors participated in the incident, which requires additional measures to ensure\n\ndue process.\n\nIV. HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGES\n\nA. Rule of law\n\n95. During the reporting period, the HRMMU monitored legal and policy developments\n\naffecting human rights and the rule of law. These include the adoption of a\n\n“Memorandum on Concord and Peace” resulting from national roundtable discussions;\n\nlegislative amendments to combat discrimination, corruption, and on the situation of\n\nrefugees; developments relating to amnesty, lustration of judges, language rights,\n\ninternally displaced persons (IDPs) from Crimea, ethnic policy, torture and illtreatment,\n\nthe media and the reform of law enforcement agencies.\n\nConstitutional reform\n\n96. Pursuant to an Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of 17 April 2014, debates were\n\norganized on constitutional amendments proposing the decentralization of power to\n\nregions. In accordance with the Geneva Statement of 17 April, roundtables on national\n\nunity, co-organized by the Government of Ukraine and the OSCE, were held on 14, 17\n\nand 21 May. At the first roundtable in Kyiv, the eastern regions of the country were\n\nlargely under-represented, with the only official being the Mayor of Donetsk, Mr.\n\nLukyanchenko (Party of Regions). During the roundtable in Kharkiv, acting Prime\n\nMinister Yatsenyuk declared that the constitution should be amended in order to\n\nprovide a special status for the Russian language and national minority languages. With\n\nmore representatives present from the east, including local parliamentarians, various\n\nperspectives were raised; at the same time, this brought to the fore an array of diverging\n\nviews on the way forward. The roundtable also prepared a Memorandum containing\n\nprovisions for a unified society, changes to the Constitution, increasing the local\n\nauthorities’ role, and decentralisation of state power.\n\n97. On 20 May, through resolution 4904, Parliament adopted the “Memorandum of\n\nConcord and Peace”, which was drafted during the second roundtable discussion in\n\nKharkiv. This document foresees the adoption by Parliament of a constitutional reform\n\npackage, including the decentralization of power, a special status for the Russian\n\nlanguage, judicial and police reform, and an amnesty law for anti-government\n\nprotesters in the east who accept to give up their weapons (except for the perpetrators\n\nof serious crimes against life and physical integrity). The Parliament called on all to\n\nwork together to protect, promote and build a democratic Ukraine, and the peaceful\n\ncoexistence of all nationalities, religions and political convictions.\n\nInternational Criminal Court\n\n98. On 23 May, former acting President Oleksandr Turchynov requested the Constitutional\n\nCourt to assess whether the Constitution of Ukraine would preclude the ratification of\n\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The document was signed\n\non 20 January 2000. On 25 February 2014, the Parliament recognised the jurisdiction of\n\nthe ICC for acts committed in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 to 22 February 2014.\n\n19\n\nOn 9 April, Ukraine informed the Registrar of the Court about this decision. On 25\n\nApril, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC announced a preliminary examination on\n\nthe situation in Ukraine to establish whether all the statutory requirements for the\n\nopening of an investigation are met.\n\n99. A Member of the Parliament of Ukraine from Odesa, Sergey Kivalov, registered on 15\n\nMay a draft resolution which aims to create the legal and institutional conditions for\n\nthose responsible for the deaths of dozens of people in Odesa, on 2 May, to be tried by\n\nthe ICC. As of 7 June, the draft resolution11 had not been considered by Parliament.\n\nCrimea\n\n100. On 5 June, Parliament adopted, on first reading, amendments to the Law of Ukraine\n\n“On Securing Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms and the Legal Regime on the Temporary\n\nOccupied Territory of Ukraine”. These amendments aim at making the registration\n\nprocedure for those displaced from Crimea easier and faster, especially for those who\n\nwish to re-register their business. Thus, IDPs from Crimea in mainland Ukraine will no\n\nlonger need other documents than the national passport.\n\nAmnesty\n\n101. During the reporting period, no actual progress was made in adopting an amnesty law\n\nin relation to the events in the east of the country. On 18 April 2014, the Cabinet of\n\nMinisters prepared a draft law “On the prevention of harassment and punishment of\n\npersons in relation to the events that took place during mass actions of civil resistance\n\nwhich began on 22 February 2014\". The text would exempt from criminal liability all\n\nthose who attempted to overthrow the legal government; took part in riots; seized\n\nadministrative and public buildings; and violated the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\n\nprovided they agreed to voluntarily cease all illegal actions and were not guilty of\n\n“particularly serious crimes”. Four other so-called “amnesty laws” were registered in\n\nParliament by different political parties between 9 and 23 April. On 6 May, a draft\n\nresolution was registered, calling on Parliament to make the draft law submitted by the\n\nCabinet of Minister the basis for the adoption of an amnesty law. During his\n\ninauguration speech, on 7 June, President Poroshenko offered to amnesty protesters\n\nwho did not have “blood on their hands”.\n\nDiscrimination\n\n102. On 13 May, Parliament adopted amendments to the Law “On preventing and\n\ncountering discrimination”. The amendments bring the definitions of direct and indirect\n\ndiscrimination in line with Ukraine’s obligations under the ICCPR and other\n\ninternational human rights instruments. They include, in particular, the prohibited\n\ngrounds listed in Article 2(1) of the Covenant (except “birth”). It should be noted,\n\nhowever, that the amendments do not integrate the jurisprudence of the UN Human\n\nRights Committee on the prevention of discrimination on the basis of sexual\n\norientation. The amendments also provide for criminal, civil and administrative liability\n\nin case of discrimination. While these are positive changes, other legal texts, notably\n\nthe Criminal Code, must be brought in line with the anti-discrimination amendments in\n\n11 Draft resolution “On the recognition by Ukraine of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court\n\nconcerning crimes against humanity having led to very serious consequences, deliberate and planned of mass\n\nkilling of citizens in a particularly brutal and cynical way during the peaceful protests on 2 May 2014 in Odesa,\n\nand concerning all perpetrators of these crimes, and on the request to the International Criminal Court to bring\n\nthe perpetrators to justice”.\n\n20\n\norder to ensure effective remedies for victims and contribute to enhanced prevention of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\nAnti-corruption\n\n103. On 13 May, Parliament adopted the Law \"On amending some legislative acts Ukraine\n\nin the area of state anti-corruption policy in connection with the implementation of the\n\nEU Action Plan on the liberalisation of the visa regime for Ukraine”. The Law provides\n\nfor more stringent penalties for corruption offences committed by individuals or legal\n\nentities. In particular, the liability for providing knowingly false data in the declaration\n\nof assets, income and expenses is introduced to the Code on Administrative Offences.\n\nThe Law also strengthens the protection of persons reporting on corruption, for\n\ninstance, providing for anonymous phone lines for reporting corruption. An external\n\ncontrol of declarations of assets, income, expenses and financial obligations is also to\n\nbe introduced. While the amendments are welcome, the key to combatting corruption\n\nlies in the readiness of all government institutions to effectively tackle this phenomenon\n\nand to implement anti-corruption norms in place. In this regard, the HRMMU recalls\n\nthat in its concluding observations adopted in May 2014, the UN Committee on\n\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights called on Ukraine to “make politicians, members\n\nof parliament and national and local government officials aware of the economic and\n\nsocial costs of corruption, and make judges, prosecutors and the police aware of the\n\nneed for strict enforcement of the law”.\n\nTorture and ill-treatment\n\n101. On 3 June, the Minister of Justice announced at a press-conference the establishment of\n\na Special Committee to carry out random inspections of penitentiary institutions, with\n\nbroad powers to check violations of human rights and the detention conditions of\n\nprisoners. The Committee will be a permanent body and is to produce monthly reports.\n\nIt will comprise representatives of the Ministry of Justice and representatives of civil\n\nsociety.\n\n102. While welcoming this step, the HRMMU notes that the Ombudsperson was designated\n\nby law as the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) against torture, in line with the\n\nOptional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture. As such, it is\n\nentrusted to conduct visits to places of deprivation of liberty, with the involvement of\n\ncivil society, and with a view to preventing human rights violations affecting detainees\n\nor contributing to their elimination. Due to the obvious similarities between mandates\n\nof the Special Committee and the NPM, proper coordination and consultations between\n\nthese bodies will be required to ensure the effectiveness of efforts to combat torture and\n\nill-treatment.\n\nLustration\n\n103. The Interim Special Commission on the vetting of judges was established on 4 June,\n\npursuant to Article 3 of the Law \"On the restoration of trust in the judiciary in\n\nUkraine”, which entered into force on 10 May. The Commission consists of five\n\nrepresentatives from the Supreme Court, the Parliament and the Governmental\n\nCommissioner on the Issues of the Anti-Corruption Policy. Legal entities and\n\nindividuals will have six months from the date of advertisement of the establishment of\n\nthe Commission in the newspaper \"Voice of Ukraine\" to request examination (vetting)\n\nof judges. Public information about the activities of the Interim Special Commission\n\nwill be published on the official website of the High Council of Justice of Ukraine. The\n\nHRMMU reiterates its concern that the immediate dismissal of judges by the Special\n\n21\n\nCommission may put in jeopardy the administration of justice. Any lustration initiatives\n\nshould be pursued in full compliance with the fundamental human rights of the people\n\nconcerned, including the right to individual review and the right of appeal.\n\nEthnic and national policy\n\n104. The Minister of Culture stated on 4 June that the Cabinet of Ministers decided to\n\nestablish a ‘Council of interethnic consensus’ and to create the position of a\n\nGovernment commissioner for ethnic and national policy. This official, who has not\n\nbeen appointed yet, will reportedly be responsible for the implementation of the ethnic\n\nand national policy developed by the Government.\n\nLanguage\n\n105. On 4 June, a draft law was submitted to Parliament “On the official status of the\n\nRussian language in Ukraine”. The draft law proposes to give “official status” to the\n\nRussian language without compromising the position of Ukrainian as the state\n\nlanguage. The bill proposes to introduce the wide usage of Russian language in state\n\ninstitutions, courts, educational institutions, mass media, official publications of\n\nlegislation and by-laws, pre-trial investigation, advertising and labelling of goods.\n\nMedia\n\n106. On 4 June, the Cabinet of Ministers instructed the State Committee on television and\n\nradio broadcasting to prepare a draft law \"On Amending Certain Legislative Acts of\n\nUkraine regarding resisting informational aggression of foreign states\". Other\n\nministries and agencies that will participate in the drafting of the bill will include the\n\nMinistry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry\n\nof Foreign Affairs, MoI, State Security Service, the National Council on Television and\n\nRadio Broadcasting, and the State Committee on Entrepreneurship of Ukraine. This\n\ndevelopment comes after a Ukrainian court banned, in March 2014, broadcasting by\n\nfour Russian TV channels in Ukraine, and armed groups in the east having disrupted\n\nbroadcasting of Ukrainian channels.\n\n107. The HRMMU is of the view that professional journalism and critical thinking, not\n\nprohibition, are the proper answers to the attempts to distort or manipulate facts.\n\nEveryone, in accordance with article 19 of the ICCPR, should have the right to hold\n\nopinions without interference and to freedom of expression, which includes freedom to\n\nseek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers.\n\nRefugees\n\n108. On 13 May, Parliament adopted amendments to the refugee Law extending the\n\ndefinition of complementary protection to include persons fleeing armed conflict and\n\nother serious human rights violations. This brings the definition of complementary\n\nprotection into line with international and European standards.\n\n109. The HRMMU notes, that certain legal gaps remain, affecting particularly the quality of\n\ndue process in the asylum procedure and the reception conditions for asylum-seekers.\n\nThe quality of decision-making on asylum applications also remains of concern, as well\n\nas the fact that State funding for asylum matters is inadequate.\n\nMartial law\n\n110. On 3 June, former acting President Oleksandr Turchynov signed decree № 936/2014\n\n“About considering the question of the introduction of martial law in certain areas of\n\nUkraine”. The decree requests the Secretary of the Council of the National Security and\n\n22\n\nDefence of Ukraine to “immediately cooperate with the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine,\n\nthe Ministry of Interior of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Administration\n\nof the State Border Service of Ukraine to consider the question about the need to\n\nimpose martial law in the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions, where the security operation\n\nis taking place, to prevent further development and ensure the ending of the armed\n\nconflict on the territory of Ukraine, to prevent mass deaths of civilians, military\n\npersonnel and members of law enforcement agencies, to stabilize the situation and\n\nrestore normal life in these regions”.\n\nLaw enforcement sector reform\n\n111. On 4 June, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk instructed the Cabinet of Ministers to set\n\nup a working group that will prepare legislation to reform the law enforcement system\n\nby 1 August 2014. The working group will be headed by First Vice-Prime Minister,\n\nVitaliy Yarema, who stressed the need to develop draft laws on the police, the security\n\nservice and the prosecutor’s office. Experts from the European Commission and Poland\n\nwill assist the working group.\n\n112. On 5 June, Parliament adopted the Law \"On Amendments to the Law of Ukraine on\n\ncombating terrorism\". The law provides a definition of a Counter-Terrorist Operation\n\n(CTO), the authority of the CTO participants and other innovations. It also prescribes\n\nthe possibility of \"physical elimination of the terrorists\" in case of resistance. Speaking\n\nat a press conference, the former acting Head of the Presidential Administration gave\n\nhis support to the introduction of martial law in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as\n\nwell as in the border areas of seven other regions of Ukraine.\n\nB. Freedom of peaceful assembly\n\n113. After the 2 May events in Odesa, a police presence has been highly visible during\n\npeaceful assemblies in all major cities of Ukraine. However, the real or perceived\n\ninaction of law enforcement is a further challenge to ensuring accountability at such\n\nevents such as demonstrations, rallies and pickets.\n\n114. Ahead of 9 May (Victory Day), for instance, security was heightened with numerous\n\ncheckpoints on roads in several cities the programme of celebrations was changed in\n\norder to avoid situations that could provoke unrests, for example by cancelling parades.\n\nPublic commemorations and rallies took place in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and in many\n\ncities in western and central Ukraine. In Donetsk, a rally gathering 2,000 persons went\n\npeacefully.\n\n115. However, legislation is required to regulate the conduct of assemblies in line with\n\ninternational standards, as previously recommended by the HRMMU.12\n\n116. A trend of local administration requesting courts to take measures to prevent peaceful\n\nassemblies illustrates the need for relevant legislation. For instance, on 4 June, the\n\nMykolaiv District Administrative court decided to ban until 30 June all rallies planned\n\nin the city centre further to a request from the City Council. The Mykolaiv City Council\n\nhad requested such a prohibition after 2 June when the police intervened to prevent\n\nclashes between participants of two rallies running in parallel. The court justified the\n\nban, arguing that the right to life and health was more important than the right to\n\npeaceful assembly.\n\n12 The OHCHR report on the human rights situation in Ukraine report, 15 April 2014, paras. 52-54.\n\n23\n\nC. Freedom of expression\n\n117. The HRMMU remains concerned about the curtailment of freedom of expression,\n\nincluding harassment and threats to targeting journalists working in Ukraine, mostly in\n\neastern regions (see section C, in Chapter V).\n\n118. During the reporting period, a few isolated cases of obstruction to media work and\n\nattacks on journalists were registered across Ukraine.\n\n119. On 23 May, two journalists of “Russia Today”, who were travelling to Ukraine to cover\n\nthe elections, were denied entry at Odesa airport. The border officers reportedly forced\n\nthem to buy return tickets to Moscow and fly back, without providing any reason.\n\n120. On 25 May and shortly after, journalists were prevented from filming the vote\n\ncounting. The HRMMU is aware of such cases having occurred in Sumy,\n\nDnipropetrovsk, Kremenchuk (Poltava region), Lviv, Mykolaiv, Uzhgorod and Kyiv.\n\nTo the knowledge of the HRMMU, none of these instances resulted in physical\n\nviolence or damage to equipment.\n\n121. On 23 May, the holding “Multimedia invest group”, based in Kyiv, reported that the\n\naccounts of the company were blocked and its building was searched by tax police.\n\nThe management sees this as pressure against its media outlets (newspaper and website\n\n“Vesti”, TV Channel UBR and Radio Vesti) which are critical of the Government.\n\n122. In general, the developments in eastern and southern regions of Ukraine and the large\n\nnumber of casualties have generated an escalation of hate speech and tension between\n\nthe two rival sides. This is particularly obvious in social media.\n\nD. Minority rights\n\n123. The HRMMU regularly meets representatives of various minorities in Ukraine. In the\n\nreporting period no major incidents and human rights violations were reported in that\n\nregard.\n\nNational and Ethnic minorities\n\n124. Ethnic minorities generally speak of positive relations and atmosphere conducive to\n\nexercising their human rights, including cultural rights. Some communities, particularly\n\nRussian, expressed concerns with the lack of financial allocations for the needs of\n\nethnic minorities or bureaucratic obstructions by local authorities, for example, in\n\nestablishing additional schools, churches, newspapers, etc.\n\n125. On 20 May, during a press-conference, Josyf Zisels, the Head of the Association of the\n\nJewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine, underlined that there was no\n\nincrease in anti-Semitism in Ukraine. He noted that the number of anti-Semitic\n\nincidents is declining since 2007. While pointing out that in the first half of 2014 more\n\nUkrainian Jews had migrated to Israel compared to the previous year, he attributed this\n\nto the social-economic impact of the situation in Crimea and in the eastern regions.\n\nLinguistic rights\n\n126. The guarantees of using one’s mother tongue freely in private and public life without\n\ndiscrimination remain high on the public agenda. The Law “On the Basics of State\n\nLanguage Policy” currently in force (provides for the introduction of a “regional\n\nlanguage” based on ethnic composition). However, the Government has recognised\n\nthat a new language law was needed, reflecting broad consensus as well as the\n\n24\n\nexpectations of the Russian-speaking population. There have been attempts to amend\n\nlegislation and a draft law has been developed. The latest draft law was submitted on 4\n\nJune, which proposes to provide Russian language with “official status” through\n\nextensive usage in State institutions and public documents (see section D, Chapter IV).\n\n127. On 30 May, the Ministry of Education amended the framework curriculum and study\n\nplans for secondary school students of grades 5-9 for the learning of minority\n\nlanguages, such as Armenian, Bulgarian, Crimean Tatar, Gagauz, Greek, German,\n\nHebrew, Hungarian, Korean, Moldovan, Polish, Romanian, Russian and Slovak. The\n\nMinistry also increased significantly the number of hours prescribed for learning of a\n\nminority language in schools where the relevant language is the working one (it is now\n\nequal to the hours of learning Ukrainian language).\n\nSexual minorities\n\n128. The HRMMU continues to receive reports from the LGBT community regarding lack\n\nof tolerance and daily discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender\n\nidentity, mainly bullying at school/university, difficulties in finding and/or preserving\n\nemployment especially when persons disclose their sexual orientation and gender\n\nidentity; access to health services, particularly for transgender people; and physical\n\nattacks.\n\n129. On 7 May, the High Specialized Court of Ukraine for Civil and Criminal Cases issued a\n\nletter (N 10-644/0/4-14) to appellate courts, explicitly prohibiting discrimination in\n\nemployment on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court stressed that, when\n\nconsidering cases of labour discrimination, it is important to take into consideration the\n\nexisting anti-discrimination law, which prohibits discrimination on any basis.\n\nE. Political rights\n\nHuman rights in the electoral process\n\n130. On 25 May, the population of Ukraine voted to elect a new President among 21\n\ncandidates. On 3 June, the Central Election Commission (CEC) confirmed that Mr.\n\nPetro Poroshenko had won with 54.7% of the vote.\n\n131. The elections took place in a challenging political, economic and, in particular, security\n\nenvironment, due to continued unrest and violence in the east of Ukraine, where armed\n\ngroups control some areas, and the Government has been conducting security\n\noperations. This situation affected the general human rights situation and seriously\n\nimpacted the election environment, also obstructing meaningful observation.\n\n132. Notwithstanding, elections were characterised by a 60% voter turnout and the clear\n\nresolve of the authorities to hold elections in line with international commitments and\n\nwith a respect for fundamental freedoms in the vast majority of the country. The voting\n\nand counting process were transparent, despite large queues of voters at polling stations\n\nin some parts of the country.\n\n133. Despite efforts of the election administration to ensure voting throughout the country,\n\npolling did not take place in 10 of the 12 election districts in Luhansk region and 14 of\n\nthe 22 election districts in Donetsk region. This was due to illegal activities by armed\n\ngroups before, and on, the election day, including death threats and intimidation of\n\nelection officials, seizure and destruction of polling materials, as well as the\n\nimpossibility to distribute ballots to polling stations due to the general insecurity caused\n\n25\n\nby these groups (see Chapter V). The majority of Ukrainian citizens resident in these\n\nregions were thus deprived of the right to vote. Elsewhere, a few isolated attempts to\n\ndisrupt voting were reported.\n\n134. The HRMMU followed the participation of Crimean residents in the Presidential\n\nelections. Simplified registration procedures were put in place to ensure that residents\n\nof Crimea and persons who resettled from Crimea to other regions could take part in\n\nthe elections. According to the CEC, 6,000 Crimean residents voted on 25 May.\n\nPolitical parties/ Freedom of association\n\n135. On 7 May, several political parties were allegedly banned in Luhansk region by a\n\ndecision of the “people’s council”, including Batkivchyna, Udar, Svoboda and Oleg\n\nLyashko’s Radical Party, as well as Right Sector. It also inferred “extended powers” on\n\nValeriy Bolotov, the self-proclaimed “people’s governor”.\n\n136. On 13 May, the Kyiv District Administrative Court banned the party Russian Bloc\n\nbased on the fact that the party leaders had called for the overthrow of the constitutional\n\norder and violations of the territorial integrity of the country.13\n\n137. It appears that the Communist Party of Ukraine is coming under increasing pressure.\n\nOn 7 May, the Communist faction of the Parliament was expelled from a closed-door\n\nparliamentary hearing, which was denounced by the Party of Regions faction,\n\nallegedly, because of the “separatist” statements by its head, Petro Symonenko. The\n\nhearing was reportedly about the security operations in the east. Party of the Regions\n\npointed out that information on these security operations should be made public.\n\n138. On 18 May, former acting President Turchynov called on the Ministry of Justice to\n\nreview documents gathered by the law enforcement bodies relating to the alleged illegal\n\nand unconstitutional activities of the Communist Party of Ukraine aimed at violating\n\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, undermining State security and\n\nillegal seizure of State power. On 19 May, the Ministry of Justice sent a request to the\n\nGeneral Prosecutor’s Office and the SBU to investigate possible crimes by the\n\nleadership of the Communist Party of Ukraine.\n\nF. Internally displaced persons\n\n139. As of 6 June, the departments of social protection in the Ukrainian regions had\n\nidentified over 12,70014 internally displaced persons (IDPs)15. However, the actual\n\nnumber of people who have fled the violence and fighting in the regions of Donetsk\n\nand Luhansk is believed to be higher and increasing daily. According to various\n\nestimates, around 64% are women; many are with children, including infants. The IDPs\n\nlive dispersed across the entire territory, with significant concentrations in Kyiv and\n\nLviv.\n\n13 On 15 April, the Ministry of Justice filed a lawsuit to prohibit the activities of the political parties Russian\n\nBloc and Russian Unity in Ukraine. The activity of Russian Unity was banned on 30 April. According to\n\nUkrainian law, a court can ban the activities of a political party upon a request filed by the Ministry of Justice.\n\n14 UNHCR estimated that, as of 16 June, there were 34,336 IDPs in Ukraine, with 15,200 located in the Donetsk\n\nand Luhansk regions.\n\n15 According to the Russian Federation Federal Migration Service, as of 6 June 2014, 837 persons had applied\n\nand were granted refugee status; and 3,750 persons had applied and were granted Temporary Asylum.\n\nApproximately 15% were minors under the age of 18. These figures do not include people from Crimea.\n\n26\n\n140. People have left Crimea for different reasons. The majority have economic,\n\nprofessional or family ties within Ukraine and do not wish to acquire Russian\n\ncitizenship, which many feel compelled to do in order to continue a normal life in\n\nCrimea. Some Crimean Tatars fear limitations to their religious and cultural expression.\n\nActivists and journalists have been exposed to, or fear, harassment.\n\n141. The main difficulties the IDPs from Crimea continue to face are: lack of temporary and\n\npermanent housing; access to social allocations, medical and educational services;\n\naccess to bank accounts / deposits; possibility to continue entrepreneurship activity, and\n\nemployment opportunities.\n\n142. Despite efforts made, some of these issues, particularly housing, are very difficult to\n\nresolve without systemic changes and involvement of the Government. The HRMMU\n\nhas been made aware of some instances when IDPs had to return to Crimea, since their\n\nbasic needs could not be met in Ukraine.\n\n143. Displacement from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions started in the days leading up to\n\nthe “referendum” held in both regions on 11 May. People have been trying to leave the\n\nviolence affected areas, particularly Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, after witnessing\n\nviolence on the streets. Armed groups and increasing criminality have generated fear.\n\n144. The HRMMU interviewed several IDPs from the eastern regions, who reported that\n\napart from random violence, there were targeted attacks and intimidation of activists\n\nand increasingly of “ordinary” residents, known for their “Pro-Ukrainian” stance. Local\n\nNGOs confirmed that while seizing administrative buildings, armed groups obtained\n\naccess to personal data of activists who participated in rallies. The latter and their\n\nfamilies were reportedly being threatened and harassed.\n\n145. One of the few interviewed activists reported being threatened and having to stay in a\n\nfriend’s house for nine days without food, as her own apartment was under\n\nsurveillance. Then other activists helped her escape and settle in another town. She has\n\nno information about her family and suffers from insomnia and anxiety attacks.\n\n146. Political activists and journalists began to feel pressure from the armed groups who\n\nwere consolidating their position in the region. After the “referendum” and with the\n\nintensification of violence, other residents of the region have started leaving their\n\nhomes in areas affected by violence due to the illegal activities of armed groups and the\n\nsecurity operations, particularly in the areas of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Many\n\nremain within the eastern regions in rural areas, as IDPs have been reporting\n\nharassment at checkpoints if they were perceived to be leaving the region to seek\n\nprotection.\n\n147. The majority of international humanitarian actors, due to security reasons, are unable to\n\naccess persons displaced within the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and thus only some\n\nvery limited assistance has been provided. IDPs, who leave the eastern regions, have\n\ngenerally maintained a low profile, fearing retribution against their relatives who have\n\nremained at home.\n\n148. There are considerable gaps in the State’s ability to protect IDPs. The central\n\nauthorities have not issued formal instructions regarding how to register and assist\n\npersons displaced from Donetsk and Luhansk regions, leading to different practices\n\nacross the country. The system for registering the IDPs is rudimentary, so the number\n\nand profile of IDPs and their needs remain largely invisible. As a result, the actual\n\nnumber of displaced persons is difficult to estimate.\n\n27\n\n149. Regional authorities are waiting for instructions on funding allocations for IDPs from\n\nthe Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Temporary accommodation, while theoretically\n\navailable, cannot be paid for and is thus rationed in many regions. Several\n\nadministrative matters remain unresolved, hindering IDPs’ ability to resume a normal\n\nlife: many cannot obtain temporary residence registration; register business activities;\n\nor in the case of IDPs from Crimea, who have not registered on the mainland, they may\n\nfind that they cannot access their personal savings in bank accounts in Crimea.\n\n150. IDPs from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions describe leaving the region with few\n\npersonal belongings in order to disguise the purpose of their departure. Many report\n\nhaving witnessed violence and experiencing feelings of fear. In dozens of interviews\n\nwith UNHCR, IDPs have reported significant deterioration of the humanitarian\n\nsituation in the areas affected by violence and the security operations. They are mostly\n\nconcerned about security: people report staying in cellars to keep away from the\n\nfighting, facing harassment at checkpoints and fearing the increasingly common\n\nabductions, threats and extortion. They have been reporting to UNHCR and the\n\nHRMMU about the serious social and economic impact of the conflict. Families have\n\nrun out of money since jobs are lost, banks closed and pensions unpaid. Public utilities\n\nlike electricity and water work only intermittently. Thus, the IDPs from the eastern\n\nregions are particularly vulnerable. There are multiple reports that thousands of people\n\nare eager to escape the areas affected by violence and the security operations as soon as\n\nthey can safely move.\n\n151. Many IDPs have exhausted their resources. Having originally been hosted by friends,\n\nfamily or even generous strangers identified through social networks, they find\n\nthemselves under pressure to move out of these temporary housing arrangements, as\n\nconditions are overcrowded and hospitality reaches its limits. Without sufficient\n\nsupport to find jobs and housing, IDPs report increasing levels of frustration and\n\nhumanitarian needs. Increasingly, IDPs are trying to self-organise into NGOs to help\n\neach other, as illustrated by Crimea SOS, Vostok SOS, the Unified Coordination Centre\n\nof Donbas. On 23 May, the HRMMU attended the first all-Ukrainian meeting\n\norganized by an initiative group of IDPs from Crimea to bring the problems faced by\n\nIDPs to the attention of the Government and local authorities so as to develop joint\n\nsolutions.\n\nV. PARTICULAR HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGES IN THE EAST\n\nA. Impact of the security situation on human rights\n\nDeterioration of the security situation\n\n152. The reporting period was marked by a significant deterioration in the security situation\n\nin eastern Ukraine. The HRMMU received credible reports illustrating an escalation of\n\nabductions, arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment, looting, as well as the occupation of\n\npublic and administration buildings (with certain fluctuations, as some buildings are\n\nrecovered by the Ukrainian military and law enforcement bodies, and some then again\n\nre-seized by armed groups). The period since the Presidential elections can be\n\ncharacterized by an increase of fighting in eastern Ukraine, with fluctuations in\n\nintensity.\n\n28\n\n153. The regularity and intensification of fighting between the armed groups and Ukrainian\n\narmed forces raises serious human rights concerns, including but not limited to: the fate\n\nof persons not involved in the fighting, especially children; the necessity and\n\nproportionality of the use of force; and the large-scale destructions, which only add to\n\nthe social and economic hardship and a general lack of respect for international\n\nhumanitarian law, when and where applicable to the fighting.\n\n154. Violence and lawlessness have spread in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Having\n\ngained access to deposits of weapons, including from the SBU building, the armed\n\ngroups increasingly started spreading violence. Abductions of persons not involved in\n\nany fighting and related acts of arbitrary detentions, looting, and killings of persons not\n\ninvolved in any fighting and other activities in violation of international law have been\n\ncarried out by the armed groups. Moreover there are reports of victims being subjected\n\nto degrading treatment, random shooting and provocations, particularly near the\n\nUkrainian-Russian border. Increasingly, attacks target ordinary people, who take no\n\npart in the fighting.\n\n155. The security operations by the Government, with military and National Guard forces\n\nparticularly concentrated around the town of Slovyansk, are present in the regions of\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk. With their superior manpower and military hardware, the\n\nUkrainian armed forces have controlled access to the cities through multiple layers of\n\ncheck-points.\n\n156. Skirmishes between armed groups and the Ukrainian military also saw the inclusion of\n\nvarious territorial defence battalions under the command of the MoI.\n\n157. The HRMMU observed an increasing presence of armed men on trucks and armoured\n\nvehicles moving around the city of Donetsk during daylight. For the first time, the\n\nHRMMU team members were stopped as they drove in their vehicle through Donetsk\n\nby armed persons who demanded to see their identity.\n\n158. In the two regions, the situation has been made complex as some of the armed groups\n\noperating in the regions have reportedly slipped out of the control and influence of the\n\nself-proclaimed republics and their leaders. Examples of this can reportedly be found\n\nwith the armed groups in the area surrounding the town of Horlivka16 in the Donetsk\n\nregion, and the armed groups operating in the border area of the Luhansk region near\n\nthe border with the Russian Federation. Moreover, on the “official” “Donetsk People’s\n\nRepublic” media outlet “Anna Info News”, the Slovyansk commander “Strelkov” Igor\n\nGirkin referred to “criminal groups” operating in the regions and that the “Donetsk\n\nPeople’s Republic” was lacking volunteers.\n\n159. Regardless of the veracity of this information, the proliferation of armed groups has\n\nclearly exacerbated threats to the security of the population, posing a further challenge\n\nin ensuring the rule of law and accountability for the numerous illegal acts committed.\n\nThe “Donetsk People’s Republic” has reported the presence among them of citizens of\n\nthe Russian Federation, including from Chechnya and other republics in the North\n\nCaucasus. A particular call for women to join the armed groups was made on 17 May\n\nthrough a video released with Igor Girkin “Strelkov”, urging women of the Donetsk\n\nregion to enlist in combat units.\n\n16 Now reportedly under the control of an armed group led by Igor Bezler.\n\n29\n\n“Referendum” on “self-rule” held in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions on 11 May\n\n160. On 11 May, a “referendum” on “self-rule” that was neither in accordance with the\n\nConstitution of Ukraine nor with effect under international law, took place in the Donetsk\n\nand Luhansk regions. The following question was asked: “Do you support the act of selfrule\n\nof the People’s Republic of Donetsk / People’s Republic of Luhansk?” The\n\nGovernment of Ukraine deemed the “referendum” illegal.\n\n161. Reports suggest that there were a limited number of polling stations for the two regions.\n\nThe official voter registration of the Central Election Commission was not used as a basis\n\nfor the vote. Media outlets and journalists observing the “referendum” reported a number\n\nof violations (e.g. one person filling out several ballots; multiple voting; voting without\n\ndocumentation).\n\n162. In the aftermath of the “referendum” of 11 May, the level of violence by armed groups\n\nintensified. At the same time, a new “government” was formed, and Alexander Borodai, a\n\nRussian citizen, nominated as “prime minister” of the “Donetsk People’s Republic”. A call\n\nwas made for Ukrainian troops to leave the region.\n\nCasualties due to the escalation in intensity of fighting as Government aims to gain\n\ncontrol of the territory\n\n165. Reports illustrate that over the past month, attacks and fighting have been intensifying\n\nwith an increased number of casualties. Fighting remained concentrated in the northern\n\npart of the Donetsk region and the border areas and south of the Luhansk region. In the\n\nKharkiv region, one Ukrainian serviceman was killed in an ambush, near the city of\n\nIzyum, on the border with the Donetsk region, which serves as a basis for the security\n\noperations of the Ukrainian forces.\n\n166. On 3 June, the Prosecutor General Oleg Mahnіtsky announced that 181 people had been\n\nkilled since the start of the Government’s security operations on 14 April to regain control\n\nof the eastern regions. Of those killed, 59 were Ukrainian soldiers; the others were\n\nreported to be residents. 293 were wounded as a result of these security operations in the\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk Regions. This is a considerable increase since 14 May, when the\n\nProsecutor General had announced 68 killed (servicemen and residents).\n\n167. The HRMMU is trying to verify these allegations and to obtain disaggregated data on the\n\nvictims and perpetrators. This is, however, difficult to obtain due to either a lack of, or\n\ncontradictory, information.\n\n168. On 13 May, a Ukrainian military unit was ambushed near Kramatorsk, killing seven\n\nUkrainian soldiers. On 22 May, 17 Ukrainian servicemen were killed and 31 injured near\n\nVolnovakha (south of Donetsk); that same day another soldier was killed and two others\n\ninjured in an attack by armed men on a convoy of military vehicles near Rubizhne in the\n\nLuhansk region. On 23 May, the territorial defence battalion “Donbas” was ambushed and\n\nattacked by an armed group, reportedly controlled by Igor Bezler, near the town of\n\nHorlivka close to Donetsk. Nine soldiers were wounded and detained by Bezler’s group;\n\none was reportedly killed. On 29 May, a Ukrainian military helicopter was shot down near\n\nSlovyansk, which killed 12 service personnel who were on board, including a General.\n\n169. On 26 May, fighting broke out for control of the Donetsk airport between the armed\n\ngroups and the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian military planes and helicopters were used\n\nagainst the armed groups who eventually conceded control. The airport terminal and the\n\nrunway were damaged as a result of aerial bombing. According to the Interior Minister,\n\nthere were no losses within the Ukrainian military but according to various sources, the\n\n30\n\narmed groups suffered over 50 casualties, of these at least 31 volunteers were reportedly\n\nfrom the Russian Federation, including from Chechnya and other republics in the Northern\n\nCaucasus. Out of these casualties, 30 bodies of those fighting with the armed groups have\n\nnot been recovered.\n\n170. During the fighting around Donetsk airport on 26 May, the Mayor called on the population\n\nnot to leave their apartments unless absolutely necessary. Notwithstanding, residents did\n\nbecome victims. A woman was killed by a shell at a bus stop. A man was killed as a result\n\nof an incoming explosion near the Children's Hospital, with a further six people wounded,\n\nincluding a seven-year-old boy who was at home. A criminal case was opened under\n\nArticle 258, Part 3 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (“Terrorist act that led to the death of\n\na person”).\n\n171. On 2 June, an explosion of an unknown nature took place at the occupied building of\n\nLuhansk Regional State Administration. According to various accounts, it was either a\n\nfailed attempt by the local armed groups to hit a Ukrainian fighter plane, or the\n\nbombardment of the occupied building by a Ukrainian plane. Seven people in, and around,\n\nthe occupied building were reported killed as a result of the shelling, including the\n\n“minister of health” of the “Luhansk People’s Republic”, Nataliya Arkhipova.\n\n172. The Ukrainian National Guard took control of the town of Krasnyi Liman (20 km North-\n\nWest of Slovyansk) after fierce fighting on 3 June. The town hospital was badly damaged\n\nreportedly by shelling and most patients were evacuated to the basement of the hospital.\n\nTwo civilians were killed. The chief surgeon of the hospital was gravely wounded, and\n\ndied on 4 June.\n\n173. IDPs from Slovyansk have described to the HRMMU the situation they have faced for the\n\npast weeks. They claim that the Ukrainian air force was shelling the city and bombed a\n\nkin"
