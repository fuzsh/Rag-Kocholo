        "text": "The public is invited to an online discussion with four New Mexico women curators who have each organized woman-centered art exhibitions in New Mexico in 2020: Andrea R. Hanley (Feminisms, 516 ARTS, Albuquerque); Mary Statzer (Indelible Ink: Native Women, Printmaking, Collaboration, UNM Art Museum, Albuquerque); Marisa Sage (Labor: Motherhood & Art in 2020, NMSU Art Museum, Las Cruces); and Lucy Lippard (Feminist Art in the Age of Trump, Axle Contemporary, Santa Fe).\n\nModerated by Lauren Tresp, publisher and editor at Southwest Contemporary, Santa Fe, this discussion around curating femme and femme-identifying artwork will span multiple feminist themes relating to these exhibitions. Subjects include the value of gender-based art exhibitions; the cultural and economic circumstances negotiated by female artists and curators; how feminist exhibitions serve as platforms that ground conversations about equality, misogyny, and artworld bias; and how art can serve as a departure point for the cause of social justice.\n\nWitch’s Kitchen is a roving cabaret that will unfurl over the next year as a series of conversations, screenings, performances, and culinary experiences. Organized by artist Shana Lutker in conjunction with the Feminist Art Coalition, Witch’s Kitchen expands on the generative intersection of performance, exile, and communal nourishment through the legacy of performer Valeska Gert (1892–1978) and will trace the thread of activist kitchens and exile performance in Los Angeles.\n\nWitch’s Kitchen borrows its name from Hexenküche, a post–World War II restaurant and cabaret run by Gert in Berlin. Gert was a kaleidoscopic creative force from the 1920s to the 1970s, and she is the spirit guide for Witch’s Kitchen. Her underground restaurants and bars in Berlin, New York, Provincetown, Zurich, and the island of Sylt before, during, and after the war provided safe haven to exiles and artists of all sorts.\n\nShe was an innovative dancer and acclaimed performer in Weimar Berlin in the early 1920s. “By dancing like a holy terror,” she wanted “to cross every border and violate every boundary in art.” Her dance was described by one critic as the “pathos of protest.” As a Jew, she was declared a degenerate artist and fled Berlin in the early 1930s. Gert was also an actor who, over nearly sixty years, worked with directors ranging from Kurt Weill to Bertolt Brecht to Federico Fellini. In addition to her legacy in dance and film, she served as an inspiration for the punk movement. She blurred the line between work and performance throughout her life.\n\nOriginally conceived as a series of public cabarets staged throughout Los Angeles, Witch’s Kitchen will now unfold over a year in two parts. Launching in October 2020, Part One comprises a series of online conversations and performances hosted by Lutker. The Witch’s Kitchen Archive will be published online as a series of visual poems appearing alongside and mirroring Lutker’s research process and practice. These photos and texts will pay homage to the life and work of Gert and explore the history of underground and exile performance in Los Angeles. The accumulated archive and public programming will set the table and stage for Part Two. In 2022, Lutker’s Witch’s Kitchen will manifest as a “cabaret,” presenting new performance and collaborative culinary experiments that extend the promise of cultivating community through feminist resistance.\n\nThrough the Eye of a Needle is the first major solo museum exhibition of New York–based artist Genesis Belanger (b. 1978), whose practice spans sculptures and tableaux, primarily composed of porcelain, stoneware, and upholstery. Belanger’s conceptual methodology blends Surrealism and Pop art with a self-possessed feminism informed by a professional career in the fashion and advertising industries. Staging her sculptural objects on upholstered furnishings of her own invention, Belanger constructs uncanny scenes that perform narratives about our anxiety-afflicted present.\n\nAnthropomorphizing common household objects, Belanger imparts beauty products, design accessories, and food items with feminized attributes: lipsticks with wagging tongues, lamps with ladies’ pearls, and tins with doe-eyed sardines. She fancies gendered motifs—well-manicured fingernails, lipstick-smeared cigarettes, and candy-colored pills—to personify women’s troubles, desires, and addictions. Her dreamlike jumbles invoke Surrealists such as René Magritte and Kay Sage as well as Pop artists like Marisol and Claes Oldenburg, but her inimitable creations are undoubtedly about our image-obsessed moment.\n\nThis exhibition will debut a new body of work specially conceived for The Aldrich. The artist’s first museum publication, with an essay by Amy Smith-Stewart, the exhibition’s curator, will accompany the show.\n\nCollective Transmission debuts two new paintings, Birth Altar 2020–2021 (2021) and Altar for Femme Joy (2020), from Clarity Haynes’s Altar series (2000–ongoing). Haynes describes her Altars as feminist spaces liberated from patriarchy. She says: “In a time of toxic masculinity and violence, to put forth joyful feminist principles feels radical. To create one’s own archive, altar, cosmology, autonomous space is an act of taking care.” In Birth Altar 2020–2021, the artist claims crowning and birth imagery as symbols of courage and resistance. Citing the heart-shaped canvases of Miriam Schapiro, the central imagery of the feminist art movement, Haynes honors the legacy of feminist artists before her. Within the composition, artworks by groundbreaking artists—Judy Chicago, Ana Mendieta, and Louise Bourgeois—are “pinned” alongside trompe l’oeil images of anonymous people giving birth. Altar for Femme Joy, Haynes’s pink triangle-shaped canvas—a reclaimed emblem of LGBTQIA power—operates as a tabernacle to pink’s persistent politicization and as a self-portrait, with personal keepsakes emphatically expressing femme power as queer, intimate, independent, and free.\n\nCollective Transmission inaugurates Aldrich Projects, a single-artist series that spotlights a singular work or a focused body of work by an artist every four months on the museum’s campus. Accompanying this project is a 22-by-14-inch broadsheet designed by The Aldrich’s design director Gretchen Kraus. It is available for free as a limited edition on a first-come, first-served basis at the museum.\n\nMarginal Costs is the first solo museum exhibition of New York–based artist Lucia Hierro (b. 1987). Hierro’s practice, which includes sculpture, digital media, and installation, confronts twenty-first-century capitalism through an intersectional lens. Hierro appropriates imagery ranging from commerce to art history, and her choices manifest her own multidimensional experience as a Dominican American New Yorker. With a studio methodology steeped in Pop art, Minimalism, Conceptual art, and European still life painting, as well as her own biographical circumstance, Hierro creates work that surveys power, individuality, and opportunity specific to the communities she orbits. Lifting visual matter off the street and media outlets, she expresses subjective storylines that speak to the elasticity of identity—a symptom of our hyperkinetic present. Conceived in close collaboration with the artist, Marginal Costs spans work from three distinctive series: recent and new sculptures from the Mercado (Market) series (2014–); the debut of the Gates (2021–); and her most ambitious wall mural to date. Both Gates and the mural were specially commissioned by The Aldrich.\n\nThe artist’s first museum publication, with an essay by exhibition curator Amy Smith-Stewart, will accompany the show.\n\nThe Sun, the Moon, and the Truth is the first solo museum presentation of Brooklyn-based artist Adrienne Elise Tarver (b. 1985) and the second series in the newly established Aldrich Projects. Tarver debuts Manifesting Paradise (2020–ongoing), a suite of twenty-two mixed-media works on paper based on the Major Arcana (major mysteries), the foundational card set of the centuries-old tarot deck, alongside Weary As I Can Be (2021). The vibrant colors and tropical settings that saturate these compositions—a fixture of her overall practice—aim to reclaim the perceptions of the exoticized, tropical seductress imparted on Black and brown women by Western civilization. Here, the faraway temptress meets another long-standing trope: the Black Voodoo priestess, treasury of esoteric wisdom.\n\nThough intimate in scale, the “cards” are packed with personal references, Afrofuturist imagery, and lush vegetation, speaking to the mythologized assumptions of the African diaspora while also citing the folklore and pop culture associations of enigmatic Black women synonymous with the prophetic craft, from Marie Laveau, the infamous “Voodoo Queen” of New Orleans, to Miss Cleo of the Psychic Readers Network. An extension of Manifesting Paradise is the large painting Weary As I Can Be. Composed, poised, and self-assured sits Vera Otis, a fictional character who has continuously appeared in Tarver’s work over the years, acting as a surrogate for the artist and all Black women grappling with societal expectations and presumptions. Illuminated and coolly gazing outward, Vera is envisioned by Tarver as watching a plantation burning across the way—the same structure engulfed in flames in Tower, the card that proposes the necessity of destruction before liberation.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, hundreds of American women artists gravitated toward making prints, partly because the medium provided forms of access and agency not as readily available within painting and sculpture. Working in a range of styles, they studied at various print studios—including independent outfits and university classrooms—and exhibited their work in the era’s countless print annuals. At a time when women struggled against structural sexism to earn solo exhibitions at top-tier galleries, these group print shows offered women artists a rare opportunity to garner critical notice. Women’s participation in the midcentury printmaking community also had significant collective impact. Through these networks, women met others with professional ambitions, compared notes about their struggles, and formed a sense of solidarity as marginalized members of the art community. In this way, women’s involvement with printmaking at midcentury fostered a range of proto-feminist attitudes and practices, such as collaboration, network building, and collegial support. Proto-Feminism in the Print Studio centers primarily around the women artists who were members of Atelier 17, the avant-garde printmaking studio located in New York City between 1940 and 1955. Featuring artists—well known and un(der)known—such as Minna Citron, Worden Day, Jean Francksen, Alice Trumbull Mason, Louise Nevelson, and Miriam Schapiro, the exhibition draws on visual and archival material to suggest how these women made technical advances within the graphic arts while simultaneously contributing to the growth of feminist networks and practices of collective action and collaboration.\n\nArizona State University Art Museum presents the work of Liz Cohen, weighing both the investigative and voyeuristic aspects of documentary photography and involving both performance and the production of objects and video. Her works typically embrace exhibitionism, radical self-expression, and countercultures. She pushes against fixed moral positions judging the use of familiar tropes (like the car bikini model) that have emerged within the context of patriarchy—arguing that tropes can have different utilities. In Cohen’s world, scripts written under oppressive pressures can be co-opted to serve new narratives. We do not invent new worlds from scratch. The power of self-determination comes from the fact that it exists in the face of something.\n\nThe exhibition will focus on the works Cohen generated around her Trabantimino car, including the car itself. For this decade-long undertaking, Cohen immersed herself in the lowrider culture of custom cars as a builder (she built the Trabantimino from the ground up) and bikini model. The Trabantimino traveled from the wide-open spaces of the American West to a decaying factory in the former East Germany, where Cohen photographed the Trabantimino at various stages of completion, inserting herself as a character in the story, a fabrication as well as a fabricator. The work is indirectly autobiographical, an examination of Cohen’s in-betweenness as a first-generation Latina and a child of the Cold War, the daughter of Colombian parents who tended to favor Warsaw Pact countries over Disneyland for summer vacations.\n\nThis site-specific installation features a new series of work by Kim Schoenstadt examining the interventions, violations and interpretations that have coalesced as a historical narrative concerning Eileen Gray’s architectural masterwork, E-1027, in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France. Since its completion in 1929, the modernist villa has undergone various acts of intrusion, destruction, and reinterpretation—largely by male protagonists—that parallel the dynamics of iteration and erasure of Gray’s creative articulations as a bisexual female designer and architect.\n\nSchoenstadt’s installation aims to reinstate Gray’s voice and highlight the dynamics of historic narratives that serve to alter her original voice. Schoenstadt’s project is not a re-creation of Gray’s work but a meditation on the architect’s original space and objectives. By investigating areas of the home that were violated, regardless of intention, Schoenstadt’s adaptation aims to restore justice to Gray, a visionary yet overlooked figure of twentieth-century modernist architecture and design. Designed specifically for the Mullin Gallery at ArtCenter’s South Campus, Schoenstadt’s installation consists of several large-scale wall murals, sculptures, and floor treatments inspired by the original and the subsequently misinterpreted architecture and color-block motifs of Gray’s interior. Integral to the exhibition will be an assemblage of images and texts regarding the history of E-1027. Additionally, continuing the social-engagement aspect of Schoenstadt’s practice, a salon area within the installation will serve as a site for various programs and community forums to be staged during the course of the exhibition—several in partnership with Now Be Here (NBH), an initiative founded and nurtured by Schoenstadt.\n\nFor its twenty-fifth anniversary year, Artpace has committed to focusing all non-residency exhibition programming to women artists in 2020. With this in mind we will celebrate our twenty-fifth year with the exhibition Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace.\n\nA fair number of exhibitions in recent years have focused on the work of female artists, but none has focused on those coming out of Artpace’s International Artist-in-Residency program. With an eye to equity, the exhibition seeks to highlight and amplify global voices of a bold and powerful female-identifying artistic community. As Artpace founder Linda Pace once said, “As an artist, I realized artists must work in environments in which they can be understood and respected. Later, as a patron, I tried to put this lesson into practice, creating a climate that encouraged individual experimentation in the way I had experienced it in that course.”\n\nThe project focuses keenly on presenting a diverse group of work addressing issues of identity, femininity, gender, feminism, and womanhood (in whatever form that may take) in an age when Linda Nochlin’s 1971 essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” still resonates.\n\nOrganized by Erin K. Murphy, director of residencies and exhibitions, Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace includes a wide array of mediums brought together in an exhibition with an astounding voice. Among the featured artists are Laura Aguilar, Jenelle Esparza, Jennifer Ling Datchuk, Janet Flohr, Regina José Galindo, Mona Hatoum, Koo Jeong-a, Autumn Knight, Margaret Meehan, Katrina Moorhead, Wangechi Mutu, Lorraine O’Grady, Linda Pace, Joyce J. Scott, Wu Tsang, Martha Wilson, and Kathy Vargas.\n\nIn a moment when the formerly radical act of “self-care” as it was imagined by the poet Audre Lorde has become an obvious marketing strategy deployed to capture the disposable income of yet one more generation of femme-identifying, self-objectifying subjects, this exhibition proposes that daily acts of care should be understood as quietly, yet decisively, disruptive of the status quo. Historically linked to the feminine, caring for others—either in personal or professional capacities—has garnered scant social capital. Yet increasingly, artists have turned to subtle and overt means of encoding alternatives to the sanctioned brutality of interpersonal interaction that has become ordinary in the early decades of the twenty-first century. Following the thinking of writer Maggie Nelson, who reminds us that an “aesthetics of care” should not seek for the work of art to care for us, this exhibition gathers works that approach care as a complicated nexus of generosity and coercion. Caregiving, Nelson tells us further, has yet to be socialized beyond the maternal, even though its capacities have been valorized in other guises—when the very acts associated with conventional maternity are dissociated from gender but proposed as a form of freedom. In this exhibition, we seek to consider how slight gestures, open questions, repetitive acts, distant memories, and subtle refusals register alternate value systems. Co-curated by Janine Mileaf and H. Daly Arnett, the exhibition features works by Elliott Jerome Brown, Jr., Lenka Clayton, Sara Cwynar, Bronwyn Katz, Chancellor Maxwell, and Lily van der Stokker.\n\nFilipino-American artist Stephanie Syjuco has created a three-part exhibition that examines how image-based processes are implicated in the construction of racialized, exclusionary narratives of history and citizenship. To the Person Sitting in Darkness (2019) is a reproduction of a flag described in Mark Twain’s 1901 essay for the North American Review: “And as for a flag for the Philippine Province,... [w]e can just have our usual flag, with the white stripes painted black and the stars replaced by the skull and crossbones.” For Vanishing Point (2020), Syjuco draped five historically charged nineteenth-century sculptures from the BMA’s collection in a semi-sheer pixelated cloth, denying the power of display previously afforded to these objects identified only as Founding Father, Collaborator, Confederate, Sympathizer, and Secessionist. Rogue States (2018) is a group of fictional flags re-created from film and television programs that depicted countries outside of the U.S. and Western Europe as terrorist, backward, or unstable. The flags are hung vertically from the ceiling in a grid, as a United Nations–style convention of collective anxiety.\n\nNever Odd or Even is an exhibition of recent work from Seattle-based glass artist Anna Mlasowsky. This new body of work expands on the latest development in her artistic practice, which leans on collaboration between still objects and moving bodies. Based on the three stages of womanhood, the work tells a story about fluid boundaries and cyclical processes. The exhibition’s title, Never Odd or Even, a palindrome, speaks to various themes, ranging from the longing for the hermaphroditic, the neutral and circular, the intangible presence of recurring cycles—be it through history, seasons, or animal migration—to the ocean currents and the female cycle.\n\nThrough this collaborative effort connecting the disciplines of performing arts and sculpture, Mlasowsky and the performers on “stage” aim to reclaim and uphold the female body as a main actor, staging the objects on view on both the spatial and performative planes. Choreography explores the crafted object’s purely operative function by enabling the wearer to perform a series of gestures that define space for social interaction. In other words, the objects are no longer confined to their autonomous, still form, but rather become movable anchors for the performance to unfold on the floor of the gallery.\n\nDanger of nostalgia in wallpaper form (in utero) by Holly Ballard Martz appears, at first, to be a lovely and innocuously patterned wall. In fact, the installation features dozens of wire coat hangers shaped and soldered by hand to display the repeated form of the female reproductive system. By installing her piece in the style of ornate wallpaper, Martz manipulates the symbol of self-induced abortions into something fit to adorn even the most elegant dining room, thus hiding a taboo in plain sight. Martz bends and forms each piece of wire herself—a slow and painful process that is an exercise in endurance for her hands and is also representative of the slow and painful trudge toward full reproductive rights for women in America. Martz presents a vivid reminder of the gory reality that remains under wraps in the absence of women’s rights, and the artist encourages us to question what else might lurk beneath the surface, be it in history, in society, or in ourselves.\n\nWith references to classical sculpture and archeology, Maria Antelman’s work in Soft Interface acknowledges the line between permanence and impermanence. Intimately photographing herself and her family and then splicing these with imagery from the natural landscape—referencing bodies as historic sculptures—Antelman intertwines the human form (humanity) with the porous stones of the earth. Creating formal connections through diagrammatic framing techniques, Antelman’s photographs and closed loops (GIFs) are transformative. Her process includes photographing primarily with 35mm film, printed, scanned, sometimes animated, and, finally, edited. While previous works have focused on the intersection of humanity with computer technology, the work in Soft Interface is rooted in stone, the base element for all future technological development. As a native of Greece, Antelman culls deeply from history while imagining the future.\n\nMaria Antelman (b. 1971, Athens) is a visual artist based in New York. She works mainly with 35mm film photography and she holds an MFA in New Genres from Columbia University. Recent exhibitions include Companion Pieces: New Photography 2020 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York; Mechanisms of Affection at the Visual Arts Center, University of Texas at Austin (solo, 2019); and Disassembler at Pioneer Works, Brooklyn (solo, 2018). She has been awarded production grants by the Onassis Foundation USA, the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens, and the J. F. Costopoulos Foundation.\n\nTreading the thin line between creation and destruction, Joey Fauerso’s work explores dualities of the human condition, interweaving personal experiences with the current sociopolitical climate. Through painting, sculpture, performance, and film, Fauerso’s graphic works lean heavily on humor and tragedy, speaking to both fragility and resilience. After she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Fauerso’s work shifted, opening the door for her personal life and anxieties to influence and exist within her practice. As a mother and an artist, she is inspired by the temporality and impermanence of childhood and the (almost) tragic theatricality of growth, which she marries with historical references, mythology, and the relationship between the body and the landscape. Experiencing her work means stepping behind the curtain and encountering layers of complexity that surround the current moment. Forever in transition, oscillating between harmony and discord, Fauerso explores how humanity always plays multiple roles.\n\nJoey Fauerso (b. 1976, San Antonio, Texas) is a San Antonio–based artist and professor in the School of Art and Design at Texas State University. Recently her work has been included in exhibitions at Blue Star Contemporary (BSC), MASS MoCA, The Drawing Center in New York, the David Shelton Gallery in Houston, and Antenna Gallery in New Orleans. Fauerso received her MFA from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, in 2001, and a BFA from the University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1998. She is the recipient of numerous grants and residencies, including BSC’s Berlin Residency Program with Künstlerhaus Bethanien (Berlin, Germany), and The Drawing Center’s Open Sessions Residency in New York (2014–15). She lives in San Antonio with her husband, Riley Robinson, and their two sons.\n\nNew Time: Art and Feminisms in the 21st Century is a major survey exploring recent feminist practices in contemporary art. The exhibition will illuminate a diverse range of art across all mediums by artists of all genders who are integrating feminist thought into innovative artistic approaches across a wide array of themes. In 1980 Lucy R. Lippard argued that feminist art is “neither a style nor a movement” but rather “a value system, a revolutionary strategy, a way of life.” New Time takes Lippard’s statement as a point of departure, examining some of the values, strategies, and ways of life reflected in recent feminist art. It will include works spanning from 2000 to 2020, with a few key historical exceptions, and will be organized around eight themes that foreground subjects such as hysteria, labor and activism, the fragmented body, gender fluidity, female anger, and the gaze, among others. The exhibition will be accompanied by a catalogue, with an introductory essay by DiQuinzio; essays by Jamieson Webster, Lyn Hejinian, and Leigh Raiford; a conversation between Judith Butler and Mel Y. Chen on gender; a conversation between Julia Bryan-Wilson and Natalia Brizuela on recent feminist art practices; and individual essays on the seventy-five artists and collectives included in the exhibition.\n\nLorraine O’Grady: Both/And will be the first comprehensive retrospective of the work of Lorraine O’Grady, one of the most significant figures in contemporary performance, conceptual, and feminist art. While the artist’s work has often been difficult to categorize—ranging from live performance to film to photography and photomontage to concrete poetry to early manifestations of what may well be called social practice art—the issues with which she grapples are remarkably consistent: the representational possibilities afforded to Black subjectivity (especially Black female subjectivity); the political, psychic, and aesthetic possibilities of hybridity; the experience of diaspora; the questioning of art’s guiding concepts and institutions (from modernism to the museum); and the intersection of self and history. Her work, no matter the medium, is conceived as a diptych. A deceptively simple form that yields a conceptual complexity, it replaces the “either/or” of Western thought with a productive, open-ended “both/and.” O’Grady’s work sets complex ideas into play, but in a way forecloses the possibility of resolution or even of hierarchy. It is perhaps for this reason that her work is being newly embraced by a younger generation of artists working across a range of disciplines, who find much to learn from a practice that upends the fixed positions of self and other, here and there, now and then—all while bringing into focus the poignancy of the lives that have been lived within these frameworks.\n\nThe Carpenter Center’s exhibition of work by B. Ingrid Olson will debut a suite of ambitious new commissions alongside select works from the past decade. Olson will create two simultaneous exhibitions: History Mother and Little Sister. Each will feature site-specific installations for both indoor and outdoor spaces, informed by notions of doubling and mirroring, the functions of footnotes and architectural fixtures, and the work of figures like Madeline Gins and Eileen Gray.\n\nIn her feminist-informed practice, Olson uses photography, sculpture, drawing, and architectural installation to explore how her body and each viewer’s body relate to boundaries and space. With her photographic works, she turns to her own body as subject matter, and connects the ways architecture and the strictures of photography act upon it. Bent knees, limbs, hands, and feet press up against mirrors and photographic surfaces, confusing the sense of interior space and its points of contact between the figure and the picture plane.\n\nMeanwhile, Olson uses a number of sculptural processes including carving and casting sculptural reliefs that evoke fragments of the human form in their measurements and assumed symmetries. Her carved and cast objects convey both intimacy and distance, as their physicality proposes a correspondence with the artist’s body or contact with a machine. The objects themselves are distanced from an original or idea through a process of abstraction as details are softened and forms are reduced. The occasional addition of found objects adds sharply dissonant or suggestive elements to these processed forms.\n\nThe interrelationships and slippages between photographic and sculptural elements are central to Olson’s works that braid together architectural space and bodily experience. At the heart of this network of procedures and media is Olson’s investment in a sense of bodily and object specificity, even as her blurred documentation and sculptural distancing poetically reconfigure hierarchies of knowledge and relationships.\n\nThe artist’s first monograph will be published to coincide with the exhibition and will feature newly commissioned texts and a selection of reprinted poetry, literary criticism, and architectural history.\n\nB. Ingrid Olson was born in 1987 in Denver, Colorado. She lives and works in Chicago.\n\nWith Pleasure: Pattern and Decoration in American Art 1972–1985 is the first full-scale scholarly survey of this groundbreaking American art movement, encompassing works in painting, sculpture, collage, ceramics, installation art, and performance documentation. Covering the years 1972 to 1985 and featuring approximately fifty artists from across the United States, the exhibition examines the Pattern and Decoration movement’s defiant embrace of forms traditionally coded as feminine, domestic, ornamental, or craft-based, and thought to be categorically inferior to fine art. Pattern and Decoration artists gleaned motifs, color schemes, and materials from the decorative arts, freely appropriating floral, arabesque, and patchwork patterns and arranging them in intricate, almost dizzying, and sometimes purposefully gaudy designs. Their work across mediums pointedly evokes a pluralistic array of sources from Islamic architectural ornamentation to American quilts, wallpaper, Persian carpets, and domestic embroidery. Pattern and Decoration artists practiced a postmodernist art of appropriation borne of love for its sources rather than the cynical detachment that became de rigueur in the international art world of the 1980s. This exhibition traces the movement’s broad reach in postwar American art by including artists widely regarded as comprising the core of the movement, such as Valerie Jaudon, Joyce Kozloff, Robert Kushner, Kim MacConnel, and Miriam Schapiro; artists whose contributions to Pattern and Decoration have been under-recognized, such as Merion Estes, Dee Shapiro, Kendall Shaw, and Takako Yamaguchi; and artists who are not normally considered in the context of Pattern and Decoration, such as Emma Amos, Billy Al Bengston, Al Loving, and Betty Woodman. Though little studied today, the Pattern and Decoration movement was institutionally recognized, critically received, and commercially successful from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. The overwhelming preponderance of craft-based practices and the unabashedly decorative sensibilities in art of the present-day point to an influential Pattern and Decoration legacy that is ripe for consideration.\n\nPresented by Chinese Culture Center (CCC), WOMEN我們: From Her to Here is the third iteration of WOMEN我們 to explore queer spaces/spaceless-ness for communities of color, pushing the boundaries of discourse on place and belonging. WOMEN我們 launched in 2012 to focus on feminism, and gender and sexual equality.\n\nUsing the Women’s Suffrage Centennial as a launching point, WOMEN我們 is a three-part project comprising a major group exhibition, a mentorship program for emerging neighborhood artists, and a symposium—exploring the artistic dialogues advanced by women, feminists, and the LGBT+/Queer community, particularly within and between San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood and artists from across the Asian diaspora. The continuing growth of artistic dialogues through the lens of female/non-binary artists impacts our largely immigrant community and asks us to question how we fit into national and international social and artistic movements.\n\nThe project will examine how feminist and Queer identities locally, nationally, and transnationally continue to evolve as both important political positions in the struggle for equity and as conceptual lenses that complicate and deepen our understandings of visual culture.\n\nLike CCC’s core signature series Present Tense and XianRui, WOMEN我們 challenges the dominant narrative by presenting risk-taking contemporary art while balancing a commitment to a legacy of social justice.\n\nArtists: Chen Han Sheng, Huang Meng Wen, Heesoo Kwon, Madeleine Lim, Nicole Pun, Queer Reads Library x Mixed Rice Zines, Tina Takemoto, Brad Walrond, Chelsea Ryoko Wong, Luka Yuanyuan Yang + Carlo Nasisse, and Yao Hong.\n\nRooted in San Francisco’s Chinatown, CCC emerged out of the civil rights movements to be the cultural and art anchor for the community. CCC’s mission is to elevate underserved communities and give voice to equality through contemporary art and education.\n\nWild Life: Elizabeth Murray & Jessi Reaves brings together the paintings of Elizabeth Murray (1940–2007) and the work of New York–based artist Jessi Reaves (b. 1986, Portland, Oregon). It sets up a dialogue between works by Murray—including the monumental, fractured canvases depicting splintering cups, tables, and fragmented body parts for which she is best known—and Reaves’s sculptural assemblages of the last five years, such as her signature ottomans, chairs, and lamps.\n\nAlthough Murray and Reaves are generations apart, Wild Life highlights their shared use of decorative, domestic, and bodily imagery. Simultaneously playful and serious, irreverent and sincere, their works offer up a series of contradictions in form and content. They impolitely allude to internal and external body parts, and aggressively question so-called good taste through thick and uneven surface textures, and ungainly shapes. Yet, they are just as likely to marry the muck with bright, childlike colors, cartoonish shapes, and historically feminine motifs such as patchwork compositions.\n\nMurray was a prominent and critically praised artist in her lifetime, and her work avoids easy categorization and resists affiliation with a singular movement or style. Her influence on recent generations of artists, as well as her significant contributions to art historical discourse on the values of the daily and domestic, remain underexamined. Wild Life reconsiders the implications of Murray’s more than four decades of depicting psychologically charged interiors by juxtaposing it with Reaves’s equally idiosyncratic and raucous approach to art making at the intersection of painting, sculpture, and furniture design. Murray and Reaves refuse rigid categorization to embrace ambiguous conceptions of the body and the home, where each continuously comes together and falls apart. Seen together, their works offer up the domestic as untamed and calamitous, revealing and reveling in the wildness of everyday life.\n\nDeborah Roberts (American, b. 1962 in Austin, Texas) critiques notions of beauty, the body, race, and identity in contemporary society through the lens of African American children. Her mixed-media works on paper and on canvas combine found materials—from photographs, magazines, literature, and the Internet—with hand-painted details in striking figural compositions that invite viewers to look closely, to see through the layers. She focuses her gaze on African American children—historically, and still today, among the most vulnerable members of our population—investigating how societal pressures, projected images of beauty or masculinity, and the violence of American racism conditions their experiences growing up in this country, as well as how others perceive them. Simultaneously heroic and insecure, playful and serious, powerful and vulnerable, the figures Roberts depicts are complex, occasionally based on actual living or historical persons. Roberts has long created images featuring young, African American, female subjects, and more recently, she began depicting young African American males, exposing the specific burdens and traumas facing both populations. For her exhibition at The Contemporary Austin, Roberts presents a selection of new collages and paintings, as well as two new interactive sound, text, and video sculptures on the first floor of the museum. In tandem, the museum has commissioned the artist to create a new figurative mural on the exterior of its downtown building. Deborah Roberts: I’m represents the first solo museum exhibition in Texas of Roberts’s work.\n\nFor twenty-five years, filmmaker and activist Jennifer Reeder has constructed personal fiction films about relationships, trauma, and coping, with a focus on the experiences of girls and women, “especially the unruly ones.” Her innovative, award-winning narratives borrow from a range of forms including after-school specials, amateur music videos, magical realism, horror, and feminist fantasy. Reeder is a unique voice within her generation, and her Midwestern roots and riot grrrl youth shape the lives of characters and their relationships in ways rarely seen on film.\n\nDPAM will present a mini-retrospective of a selection of Reeder’s films, including Clit-o-matic (1995), Nevermind (1999), And I Will Rise if Only to Hold You Down (2012), Blood below the Skin (2015), Crystal Lake (2016), and Knives and Skin (2019), supported by discussions and workshops on women in film.\n\nReeder’s films have shown consistently at festivals around the world, including the Sundance Film Festival, the Berlin Film Festival, the Tribeca Film Festival, the Rotterdam Film Festival, the London Film Festival, SXSW, the Venice Biennale, and the Whitney Biennial. Her awards include several that have qualified her films for Oscar nominations. She won a Creative Capital Grant in Moving Image (2015); short film funding from Rooftop/Adrienne Shelly Foundation (2016); and short film funding from the Hamburg Film Fund (2016). She is the 2019 recipient of the Alpert Film Award residency at the MacDowell Colony.\n\nAn artist, poet, writer, activist, and curator, Fernanda Laguna (b. 1972, Buenos Aires) is well known in Latin America through the project spaces she has run in Buenos Aires since 1999, such as Belleza y Felicidad (Beauty and Happiness), which was a cauldron of emerging art in that city during the 2000s. Many of her drawings—accomplished with feminine delicacy, a surrealist tinge, and a feminist, politicized kind of humor—tell stories of love, between a purple triangle and an orange circle, for instance, as they fluctuate toward a stellar dimension. Other drawings narrate histories of personal losses, fears, and happiness. Fernanda Laguna: I do what I do in order to avoid doing something worse (working title) is the first institutional survey of the artist’s work in the United States. The exhibition will feature more than forty artworks from Laguna’s prolific career, including works on paper and canvas, as well as journals and books. (In addition to publishing poetry books using her given name, Laguna has published several fiction novels under her nom de plume, Dalia Rosetti.) Spanning one of The Drawing Center’s upper-level galleries, I do what I do in order to avoid doing something worse provides an overview of Laguna’s relationship with paper, which she has long used to create figurative and abstract characters imbued with her own emotional life.\n\nIn the late 1960s, at the age of thirty-nine, Huguette Caland (b. 1931, Beirut, Lebanon; d. 2019, Venice, California) left her family in Beirut and relocated to Paris to pursue a career as an artist. Embracing the intrinsic sexuality of the body in her early canvases, Caland briefly came to international prominence in the 1970s. It is this explicit manner in which she expresses sensuality through drawing that has precipitated her recent resurfacing. Caland’s pen, pencil, and color pencil drawings from the 1970s and 1980s, for instance, at first appear abstract, but closer observation of the deliberate lines reveals intertwined body parts, caressing lovers, and carnivalesque portraits of topsy-turvy figures. Extending her drawing practice to fashion during this era, Caland created a series of one hundred caftans, and embroidered many of these with schematic images of breasts and female genitalia. The tension between the nakedness of the human body and the fabrics that conceal it once again became a central theme in Caland’s drawing practice in the early 1990s, both in the artist’s delicately crosshatched ink drawings that resemble woven textiles and in her series of nude mannequins embellished with these same designs. Even in her later forays into abstraction, the vitality of the human body and spirit remains palpable as fragments of figures and geographic elements from her past and present surface amidst brightly colored drawn and patterned landscapes.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, The Drawing Center presents Tête-à-Tête, Caland’s first solo museum exhibition in the United States. Bringing together works on paper and canvas from the past five decades—as well as caftans, mannequins, sculptures, and notebooks on which she wielded her pen—the exhibition shows how Caland used the candidness and mutability of drawing to unravel taboos associated with representing female sexuality.\n\nFor Hurricane Lost, the entire Media Art Gallery is transformed into a singular site-specific, fully immersive, sculptural video installation. The installation spans the gallery's 1700 sq. ft. floor-plan and rises toward the 20 ft. high ceilings. A soundscape whirls around visitors, as they choose their own path through the visual \"storm.\" The eight sculptural video forms in Hurricane Lost are based on the shapes of hurricane “cloud walls,\" while their spatial layout mimics the circular wind patterns.\n\nGeorgie Friedman’s large-scale, immersive video installations reference our changing climate and extreme weather phenomena. The rapidly melting glaciers, resultant sea-level rise, and warming oceans are increasing the intensity of hurricanes and lead to more frequent, and more-often-catastrophic weather events. Visually metaphoric and experiential, Hurricane Lost captures the inherent power of nature and visualizes the effects of our changing climate.\n\nAs visitors intuitively navigate the curved video-covered forms, they are invited to contemplate their relationship to both the natural and built environment. Hurricane Lost inventively addresses the climate crisis not by providing more scientific data, facts, and figures, but rather by enticing a visceral, emotive response through an immersive sound and light environment.\n\nDespite its meditative, aesthetically soothing presentation, it serves as a powerful call to action as it asks whether we can imagine a different, better future. And if so, whether we are willing to change the way we act and make the choices needed to get us there.\n\nFeaturing new relief paintings and figurative furniture-sculpture by New York artist Ruby Sky Stiler (b. 1979), this exhibition is being presented as part of the celebration of 50 years of women at Fairfield University. Stiler, who holds a BFA from RISD and an MFA from the Yale University School of Art, has been investigating images of women inspired by the techniques and language of classical antiquity for over a decade. Recently, Stiler’s art has expanded to include the subject of “father and child.” The dearth of art historical precedent for depictions of men displaying emotional intimacy⏤or being defined by their relationship to their children⏤is in stark contrast to the abundant impressions of “mother and child.” Also for this exhibition, Stiler will create contemporary interpretations of the traditional museum “viewing bench” as a form of utilitarian sculpture. The exhibition will invite viewers to sit and consider their own bodies in relation to the gallery space and the ideas in the artwork on the walls. The exhibition will open with a conversation between Ruby Sky Stiler and Tang Museum Dayton Director Ian Berry on September 17, 2020. The exhibition will travel and will be on view at the Tang Teaching Museum at Skidmore College, July 3–September 26, 2021.\n\nThe Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco celebrate pioneering feminist artist Judy Chicago with a retrospective spanning her early engagement with the California Light and Space movement in the 1960s to her current body of work, a searing investigation of mortality and environmental devastation, begun in 2015. The exhibition includes around 150 works and related archival material that chart the boundary-pushing path of the artist named Cohen by birth and Gerowitz by marriage, who, after trying to fit into the patriarchal structure of the Los Angeles art world, decided to change her name and the course of history. Organized on the heels of the fortieth anniversary of The Dinner Party’s first San Francisco presentation and opening in conjunction with the centennial of women winning the right to vote in the United States, Judy Chicago: A Retrospective pays homage to an artist whose lifelong fight against the suppression and erasure of women’s creativity has finally come full circle.\n\nThe year 2020 is significant in women’s history as it marks the centennial of women’s suffrage in the United States. As an homage to the audacity and perseverance of early American women, the Fresno Art Museum presents Here She Stands: Women Artists from the Permanent Collection. This exhibition highlights a selection of the phenomenal and groundbreaking work by women artists in the Fresno Art Museum’s permanent collection. Throughout history, women artists have been overlooked and excluded from the narrative. In 1971, art historian Linda Nochlin wrote an essay for ARTnews titled “Why Have There Been No Great Woman Artists?” Her argument wasn’t that there were no talented women artists but that systemic social, cultural, and political barriers prevented many women from participating and succeeding in the art world. In the forty-nine years since that article was published, much discourse has been produced on the subject, yet the art world still has much further to go.\n\nThe Fresno Art Museum has long been dedicated to the promotion of women artists. The first work by a woman artist in the museum’s permanent collection was Jean Ray Laury’s Tiger Garden (1962), acquired in 1963, just after the museum began building its permanent collection. Judy Chicago brought attention to women artists when she launched the first feminist art program at California State University, Fresno, in 1970. The Fresno Art Museum was the first museum in the United States to devote a full year of exhibitions (1986–87) exclusively to women artists, and this launched the annual Council of 100 Distinguished Woman Artist award and exhibition program that continues to this day.\n\nThe works selected for this exhibition reflect the diversity, depth, and creative vision of the many women who are represented in the museum’s permanent collection. Some of these artists are world renowned; some are best known in the local community. Selected with an emphasis on pieces that have not been frequently exhibited, the works are by artists including Helen Lundeberg, Claire Falkenstein, Isobel Sanford, Amy Kasai, Jean Ray Laury, June Wayne, and Marguerite Stix.\n\nUnsettling Femininity uses the specific lens of the Frye Art Museum’s Founding Collection to probe the politics of looking and to question our habitual ways of viewing images of women. The exhibition presents portrayals of mostly white women created during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily by German and Austrian artists. This selection reflects a particular area of interest for the museum’s founders, Charles and Emma Frye, Seattleites of German descent, who assembled their art collection mostly between 1900 and 1925.\n\nMany of the works emphasize traits such as submissiveness, vulnerability, and sexual availability that correspond to pervasive nineteenth-century cultural attitudes about the ideal feminine nature and body. Others were intended to challenge the increasingly conservative Christian sensibilities prevalent in Bavaria with confrontational images that eroticize female religious figures. From a present-day perspective, these attributes highlight the performative nature of gender as specific sets of socially patterned behaviors informed by race and class. Whether these images associated women with virtue and beauty or danger and sex, they reinscribed moral boundaries that ultimately upheld the patriarchal status quo.\n\nOrganized around four primary themes—judgment, morality, performance, and artifice—the exhibition asks viewers to reconsider the very act of looking in all its positive and negative connotations. In doing so, it offers an invitation to unsettle and unpack these enduring, and often unquestioned, notions of femininity.\n\nAgnieszka Polska’s computer-generated media works draw on language, history, and scientific theory to illuminate issues of individual and social responsibility. Combining original poetic texts with digitally manipulated imagery, her hallucinatory videos attempt to describe the overwhelming ethical ambiguities of our time. In this exhibition, the artist presents two immersive, deeply affecting audiovisual essays that address the urgent global issue of climate change and the specter of mass extinction.\n\nThe first installation pairs two videos, The New Sun and What the Sun Has Seen (both 2017) (now streaming online), depicting a sentient sun that is witness to environmental and ethical collapse on Earth. The sun speaks directly to the audience in half-sung monologues, moving through a range of emotional states and modes of address, from professing love and telling silly jokes to pondering the power of language to construct a new world order. The Happiest Thought (2019), meanwhile, takes us back to a prehistoric environment that might prefigure our own: Earth’s biosphere before the Permian-Triassic extinction, which occurred more than 250 million years ago and annihilated as much as 90 percent of life on the planet. The piece offers a hypnotic exploration of this lush and alluring ancient environment while contemplating humanity’s potential to overcome enormous threats like the climate crisis.\n\nIncorporating online-video tactics such as emotional mimicry and ASMR triggers (heightened sounds and whispers that stimulate pleasant tingling sensations), Polska crafts a mesmerizing atmosphere to compete with what she calls the “environment of seduction” surrounding consumer marketing and organized religion.\n\nThrough her writing, performances, and installations, Anastacia-Reneé counteracts the erasure of marginalized identities in American society with an unflinching gaze directed toward collective liberation. In this exhibition, Anastacia-Reneé offers a rageful mediation on gentrification—of neighborhoods and its insidious effects on the body—as seen through the eyes of her multilayered and witty character Alice Metropolis.\n\nAlice has appeared as a multidimensional character in Anastacia-Renee’s literary and interdisciplinary work for the past seven years. (Don’t be Absurd) Alice in Parts takes the shape of an immersive installation that guides museumgoers through the various rooms of Alice’s soon-to-be gentrified home. Through constructed tableaux incorporating poems, objects, personal effects, audio, and video, the exhibition charts the ways Alice strives for wholeness and transcendence against intersecting forms of systemic oppression that relentlessly fracture her sense of self.\n\nAlice’s home is a place of refuge and nightmares, where she has built a spiritual sanctuary dedicated to “The Lorde”—as in the Black lesbian feminist writer and activist Audre Lorde (1934–1992)—as a source of strength amidst the past tragedies and present traumas that haunt her. Through Alice’s lived experience, Anastacia-Reneé provides an unsparing window into the world of an individual attempting to (permanently) stay one step ahead of the many forces that seek to erase her essence and existence.\n\nWith works in all media by nearly eighty artists dating from the 1920s the present, Black Refractions presents nearly a century of creative achievements by artists of African descent. Celebrating the role of The Studio Museum in Harlem as a site for the dynamic exchange of ideas about art and society, this landmark exhibition proposes a plurality of narratives of Black artistic production and multiple approaches to understanding these works. Black Refractions reveals the breadth and expansive growth of The Studio Museum’s permanent collection and includes iconic pieces by artists such as Barkley Hendricks, Faith Ringgold, Lorna Simpson, Alma Thomas, and James VanDerZee, as well as Seattle’s own Jacob Lawrence and Noah Davis, among many others.\n\nThe Studio Museum in Harlem has served as a nexus for artists of African descent locally, nationally, and internationally since its founding in 1968. The museum’s artist-in-residence program—providing the “Studio” in the museum’s name—was established as an opportunity for emerging artists to create new work in the heart of Harlem, a neighborhood historically associated with Black cultural production. The program has supported many distinguished creators at decisive stages in their careers, including Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Chakaia Booker, David Hammons, Kerry James Marshall, Mickalene Thomas, and Kehinde Wiley, all of whom have work in the exhibition. Now, as The Studio Museum celebrates its fiftieth anniversary, Black Refractions will allow audiences across the country to engage more deeply with this important collection and provide additional contexts in which we can understand its powerful works.\n\nWitch Hunt is an international group exhibition showcasing the work of 16 artists who use feminist, queer, and decolonial strategies to investigate current and historical political events, social conditions, and overlooked or suppressed artistic legacies. The artists have demonstrated decades-long commitments to feminist creative practice as a subversive, expansive, and oftentimes collaborative methodology. Together, their works provide an opportunity to examine ideas, expand awareness, and encourage dialogue about urgent contemporary issues such as the body and its vulnerabilities; women’s rights and representation; the erasure of women’s contributions to critical movements and histories; the impact of technologies of surveillance; environmental justice; the queering of political discourse; the imperative for feminist practice to be inclusive and intersectional; and the power of collective action.\n\nThe 15 projects in Witch Hunt employ a variety of mediums—painting, sculpture, video, photography, sound, and performance—and consistently argue for the value of a critical feminist perspective within the subject matter, production, and presentation of contemporary art. Witch Hunt asks how artistic practices informed by feminist ideologies can meaningfully amplify debates within contemporary culture and politics. The projects in the exhibition constitute an art of resistance, disrupting cultural discourse and proposing new ways of thinking and enacting change at a moment of unprecedented suffering and upheaval across the globe.\n\nWitch Hunt offers an incisive survey of complex and impactful practices by some of the most influential artists working today. The show includes newly commissioned works as well as major projects that have yet to be shown on the West Coast or in the United States. Together with the accompanying catalogue and a robust series of public programs and performances, the exhibition highlights artists from diverse cultural positions who argue for the productive capacity of subversive female voices in ongoing efforts to create a future characterized by equity and inclusion.\n\nIncluded artists: Leonor Antunes (Portuguese), Yael Bartana (Israeli), Pauline Boudry (Swiss) & Renate Lorenz (German), Candice Breitz (South African), Shu Lea Cheang (Taiwanese), Minerva Cuevas (Mexican), Vaginal Davis (American), Every Ocean Hughes (American), Bouchra Khalili (Moroccan), Laura Lima (Brazilian), Teresa Margolles (Mexican), Otobong Nkanga (Nigerian), Okwui Okpokwasili (Nigerian American), Lara Schnitger (Dutch), and Beverly Semmes (American).\n\nWitch Hunt is curated by Connie Butler, Hammer Museum chief curator, and Anne Ellegood, ICA LA Good Works executive director, with Nika Chilewich, curatorial assistant. The exhibition is organized by the Hammer Museum and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (ICA LA).\n\nExploring and expanding the interplay between the female body and the European art canon; Syrian, Muslim, and immigrant histories and mythologies; architectural icons; and the natural world, Diana Al-Hadid’s work informs and enriches these discussions. Born in Aleppo, Syria, and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Al-Hadid (b. 1981) creates artworks that speak to her Arab, Muslim family background in concert with an interest in the melding of cultures and the transmogrification of traditional and artistic narratives. Ideas of spirituality, sci-fi, and science coalesce around a drive toward transformation, subjecthood, agency, and active presence, particularly with respect to the female figure.\n\nThis monographic exhibition (the artist’s first in the Pacific Northwest and among her first on the West Coast) will consist of a selection of ten to fifteen large-scale sculptural works made between 2010 and 2020—including one major new commission and several newly created bronze sculptures—brought into interpretive grouping for the first time. The lacy, liquid forms of the sculptural installations, embedded with suggestions of the female figure, evoke natural landscapes—grottoes, mountains, decaying walls, and caves. Requiring intense physicality and technical expertise to create, these sculptures appear fragile but are structurally robust. Made from extruded metal, polymer gypsum, and other materials, the works invert ideas of support and foundation. Together, the sculptures identify the artist’s investigation of historical, mythological, and biblical narratives of women as a fundamental through line in her practice. While AI-Hadid’s work is often interpreted primarily in relation to her interest in the art historical canon, this exhibition situates the artist’s deployment of these influences as advancing a network of feminist concerns: the female protagonist and its conflicted history, women’s agency and power, self-actualized identity, and subjugation.\n\nLos Angeles–based artist Math Bass (b. 1981, New York) will create a site-specific installation featuring a commissioned series of paintings, kinetic wall work, and sculptures directly inspired by the Henry’s architecture. In Bass’s work, brightly colored and cryptic, stylized forms—often inspired by the body—are abstracted into a densely graphic, nonnarrative language. Addressing the centrality of the body via the play between its absence and suggested presence, Bass’s painting and sculptural practice has evolved from their initial work as a performance and video artist, where the tracking of the body’s motion and transit through the world is central. The intersection of sculptures, paintings, and architecture becomes important as well: delimiting spectators’ progress through the installation, Bass brings forth the idea of piercing, projecting through, and resisting space.\n\nDuring their site visit, Bass particularly responded with the theatrical possibilities and multiple perspectives offered by the Henry’s East Gallery, in which their work will be exhibited: in this double­-height space, audiences experience the Gallery not only on the ground level but also from an overlook on the Henry’s mezzanine. Bass has referred to their sculptural pieces as “props,” foregrounding the performative interplay among art, artist, and viewer inherent to their installations. The installation will be activated through interventions in situ, notably in a performative lecture conducted by the artist.\n\nBugs & Beasts Before the Law (2019) is an experimental essay film by Bambitchell, the artistic collaboration of Sharlene Bamboat (b. 1984, Pakistan; lives and works in Canada) and Alexis Mitchell (b. 1983, Canada; lives and works in Scotland). The artists’ single-channel film, shot in 16mm color and HD video, poses questions about the administration of justice and rights under the law that are essential to an appreciation of the political dimensions of feminism.\n\nThis presentation marks the duo’s first museum exhibition in the U.S. and their first significant publication. Commissioned by Mercer Union and co-produced by the Henry, the film explores the history and legacy of the “animal trials” that took place in medieval and early modern Europe and its network of colonies, in which animals—and other nonhumans, such as insects and inanimate objects—were put on trial for various crimes and offenses. The film follows events from the fourteenth through the early twentieth century, questioning how power is performed through the body of the other. Each of the film’s five chapters centers on a specific “trial” or type of trial that engages questions about how the law mediates social relations and personhood through such processes as the formation of property and the criminalization of sexual difference. These stories of the past are narrated against the contemporary landscape and within constructed tableaux, blurring past and present, fact and fiction, and creating an absurdist narrative of the justice system that is all too resonant today.\n\nThe installation of Bugs & Beasts features an immersive audio score developed by Richy Carey with Bambitchell and a built amphitheater structure that accentuates the spectacle and function of the animal trials as tools of social control. A new configuration of the artists’ archival research material will also feature in the installation as evidence of how these trials figure in the historic imaginary, and lay the groundwork for the mechanisms of legal practice that shape contemporary society and are of continued concern for contemporary feminisms. An accompanying 120-page publication will be produced in conjunction with the exhibition, also featuring archival material and research documents. It will include an essay by legal scholar Sarah Keenan (Centre for Research on Race and Law, School of Law, Birkbeck, University of London) and an introduction by Henry Associate Curator Nina Bozicnik and Mercer Union Director of Exhibitions & Programs Julia Paoli.\n\nFor nearly all of photography’s 180-year history, women have shaped the development of the art form and experimented with every aspect of the medium. Conceived in conjunction with the centennial of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which granted women’s suffrage, this exhibition showcases more than one hundred photographs from the High’s collection, and charts the medium’s history from the dawn of the modern period to the present through the work of women photographers. Organized roughly chronologically, each section emphasizes a distinct arena in which women contributed and often led the way, as pioneers of the medium in its early days; as modernists exploring abstraction, light, and form; as professional photographers working in photojournalism, advertising, and documentary modes; as avid experimenters and tinkerers with photographic processes; as politically engaged actors using the medium to address contemporary concerns; and as individuals exploring and often challenging the social constructions of gender, sexuality, and identity in the twentieth century and the contemporary moment.\n\nMujeres Mutantes (MM) joins the Jackman Goldwasser Residency program through December 2020 to research and plan new conscious-raising public projects around Chicago. MM is an all-woman Latinx art collective founded in 2012 by Naomi Martinez and Delilah Salgado to empower women to make art, share stories, and promote art as a healing practice for communities affected by street violence and domestic abuse. During the residency, the group is creating a large mural mourning the loss of Black and brown bodies in our neighborhoods, to be included in the Hyde Park Art Center exhibition Artists Run Chicago 2.0 (September 1–November 1, 2020). The group’s goal is to be a platform for collaborations and exhibitions with like-minded women who are already working independently to challenge the status quo in the art community. MM is an eclectic group of multidisciplinary artists who are also local business owners, mothers, and educators who believe that public art nurtures community and that creative expression is crucial to our self-actualization leading to societal change.\n\nThis exhibition is the first museum survey dedicated to the work of Deana Lawson (b. 1979, Rochester, New York). Lawson is a singular voice in photography today. For over fifteen years, she has been investigating and challenging the conventional representations of Black life, with a particular focus on the body, through highly staged, large-format color photographs. Drawing on a wide spectrum of photographic languages—including the family album, studio portraiture, staged tableaux, documentary pictures, and appropriated images—Lawson’s posed photographs channel broader ideas about personal and social histories, sexuality, and spiritual beliefs. Many of her photographs portray or articulate a position of female desire, an often-unarticulated perspective in photography. Her concerns for real and imagined kinship extend powerfully to relationships between women, and between women and their environments, linking notions of motherhood and sisterhood to modes of public and private self-fashioning.\n\nThe exhibition will include a selection of approximately fifty photographs from 2004 to the present, including new work. Co-organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art / Boston and MoMA PS1, the exhibition will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue featuring the voices and perspectives of a variety of scholars, historians, and writers.\n\nThe Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles will present an exhibition of Los Angeles–based interdisciplinary artist Stanya Kahn (b. 1968, San Francisco). Kahn works primarily in film and video, with a practice that includes drawing, sound, performance, sculpture and writing. Humor, pathos, and the uncanny are central to Kahn’s hybrid approach to moving image, which seeks to reorient relationships between fiction and document, the real and hyper-real, and varied expressions of time. This exhibition will comprise three videos by Kahn produced over the past ten years: It’s Cool, I’m Good (2010); Stand in the Stream (2011–17), and her latest short film, No Go Backs (2020), marking its Los Angeles debut. Together, they present an urgent reflection on our times, foregrounding global concerns such as climate change, racism, state power, and rebellion with the artist’s singular humor and embrace of experimental time and narrative.\n\nCompleted earlier this year, No Go Backs follows two teenagers (and real-life friends) who leave the city for the wild, traveling through the monumental landscapes of the Eastern Sierra, encountering other youth along the way and forming camaraderie in facing the unknown. A timely indictment of current crises and a meditation on an uncertain future, No Go Backs is an allegorical epic about a generation that must find a new way forward. Stand in the Stream, an ambient digital feature film shot or screen-captured in real time over the course of six years, situates intimacies from Kahn’s life within a visceral reflection of power and uprising in late capitalism, revealing the many intersections of the personal and the political. It’s Cool, I’m Good features a severely injured protagonist (played by the artist) whose metaphoric embodiment of overwhelming psychic and environmental stress remains prescient and relatable, ten years later.\n\nICA Miami’s presentation of American artist Betye Saar will survey her immersive, site-specific installations from 1980 to 1998, many of which have been recently rediscovered and will be exhibited for the first time in decades. Rooted in the artist’s critical focus on Black identity and intersectional feminism as well as the racialized and gendered connotations of found objects, Saar’s installations expand on her celebrated repertoire and offer broadened insight into ritual, spirituality, and cosmologies in relation to the African American experience and the African diaspora.\n\nInfluenced by research trips to Haiti, Mexico, and Nigeria undertaken by the artist in the 1970s, the installations explore concepts of ritual and community through both cultural symbols and autobiographical references.\n\nThe exhibition features a selection of the significant installations, including Oasis (1985), House of Fortune (1988), The Ritual Journey, and Wings of Morning (both 1992), that draw from the history of the African diaspora and the African American experience to create tangible and powerful monuments.\n\nRAW Académie Session 9: Infrastructure is the result of a long-term dialogue between the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania (ICA), and RAW Material Company, Dakar, Senegal. The project is collaboratively organized by ICA’s Alex Klein, Dorothy and Stephen R. Weber (CHE’60) Curator; Koyo Kouoh, executive director and chief curator of the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, Cape Town, South Africa, and founder of RAW Material Company; and Marie Hélène Pereira, director of RAW Material Company, along with her entire team. The RAW Académie is rooted in the question “How do we learn from each other?” in order to provide an alternative, horizontal mode of pedagogy that, in the process, dismantles hierarchical and biased systems of knowledge production. Over the course of a seven-week “Académie,” RAW will relocate their staff and organization to Philadelphia in a radical experiment in institutional hospitality. The resulting exhibition will challenge notions of authorship and asserts that the creative process is collaborative.\n\nWorking with artist, curator, activist, and filmmaker Linda Goode Bryant, RAW will engage an international group of fellows and interdisciplinary visiting faculty in the production of a seminar program, research, public-facing events, and exhibition. Under the direction of Goode Bryant, the session will propose a different model for the infrastructure and value system for contemporary art and includes contributions from Gudskul, Rujeko Hockley, Arthur Jafa, Thomas Lax, Louis Massiah, Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung, and Greg Tate.\n\nThe Jacob Lawrence Gallery is pleased to present Ilana Harris-Babou: Long Con, premiering the artist’s most recent video work, Long Con. The new video skewers the wellness industry through stories about well-known fortune-tellers and health gurus such as the Honduran healer Alfredo Darrington Bowman (aka Dr. Sebi) and Youree Dell Harris (aka Psychic Readers Network spokeswoman Miss Cleo).\n\nCommissioned by The Black Embodiments Studio, Long Con is presented alongside two of Harris-Babou’s other recent video works: 2019’s Decision Fatigue, a parody of wellness culture that takes the form of a makeup tutorial; and 2018’s Reparation Hardware, a scathing critique of consumerism that promises absolution from the incalculable violence of slavery through handcrafted objects.\n\nIlana Harris-Babou’s work is interdisciplinary, spanning sculpture and installation, and grounded in video. She speaks the aspirational language of consumer culture and uses humor as a means to digest painful realities. Her work confronts the contradictions of the American Dream: the ever-unreliable notion that hard work will lead to upward mobility and economic freedom. She has exhibited throughout the U.S. and Europe, with solo exhibitions at the Museum of Arts & Design and Larrie in New York. Other venues include Abrons Art Center, the Jewish Museum, SculptureCenter, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the de Young Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Harris-Babou has been reviewed in The New Yorker, Artforum, and Art in America, among others. She holds an MFA in visual art from Columbia University and a BA in art from Yale University.\n\nHive is a site-specific sculpture and sound commission by Nancy Davidson and Lakshmi Ramgopal, two artists with distinctive practices collaborating for the first time at Krannert Art Museum (KAM). The installation features two inflatable sculptures by Davidson, each approaching twenty feet tall and lit from within, filling the portico of KAM’s Kinkead Pavilion. The portico presents the museum as a temple that references the ancient world through the structure’s large-scale, classicizing columns and inscribed frieze.\n\nThe artists’ inspiration is Artemis of Ephesus, a cult goddess of the ancient Mediterranean. Davidson’s sculptures exaggerate Artemis’s bodily qualities: her multiple breasts a sign of fertility, possibly in the form of a beehive or bull testicles. A braid emerges from the top of each sculpture, trailing to the floor, suggesting caryatids—an architectural feature in which figures of women with braided hair provide physical support for a building.\n\nRoman historian and multidisciplinary artist Ramgopal completes the installation with sound. Deep inhales, sighs, clicks, and hums reverberate and clip through the space. To make the work, Ramgopal recorded vocalizations from non-binary and women-identified collaborators, some of whom live with disabilities and chronic illness. Focusing on bodily breath and questioning what constitutes a feminine sound, Ramgopal arranged sections of the composition and left others randomized by computer algorithm.\n\nTo expand and comment upon the project’s questions, the curators have developed an adjacent collections installation of art from antiquity to the present day.\n\nWhat would it mean to co-create and be in a homemade space of interior world-making imagined for and with Black girls, women, and femmes as part of their everyday creative livelihoods? Homemade, with Love: More Living Room is a multimedia performance installation of artwork made during Saving Our Lives Hear Our Truth’s (SOLHOT) sessions locally at Urbana and Franklin Middle Schools. It includes a portion of Unheard Sounds, Come Through, an installation by St. Louis–based artist Jen Everett, and works by Black women artists in KAM’s collection, including Carrie Mae Weems, Margo Humphrey, and Doris Derby. The installation will also include films from Kamari Smalls, Ruth Nicole Brown, and Paris Cian that explore Black girls’ relationships to home, land, and Black girlhood. The artists featured visualize and sound Black everyday life, celebration, and interiority with Black girlhood and feminist poetics, art, and collective care in mind. Homemade, more than an art exhibition, will be co-curated with SOLHOT as a home space that prioritizes Black girls’ creative lives. This evolving installation makes room for the celebration, creativity, and imagination of Black girls, women, and femmes.\n\nPressing Issues brings together work by artists in the 1930s United States who, through their art, produced radical, critical commentaries on the social injustices plaguing the country at that time.\n\nRelying primarily on rarely displayed Works Progress Administration/Federal Art Project (WPA/FAP) prints in KAM’s collection, the exhibition organizes art into themes of labor unrest (exploitation, economic disparity, and gender inequalities), discrimination and racial violence, and reactions to the rise of fascism. In particular, traditionally underrepresented voices of women in the workforce will be emphasized, reflecting distinctions that are at play during this tumultuous era. Pressing Issues is especially timely in that it connects this past to a present in which the current political climate in the United States is revisiting similar themes of isolationism and nationalism, populism and fascism, and racial violence.\n\nPressing Issues will be on view leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Given the social and economic upheaval experienced in the United States in the last decade, including the revival of fascist ideologies and the refugee crisis in America, this exhibition provides a visceral and much-needed reminder of how visual artists call attention to and combat various forms of oppression.\n\nArtists include Ida Abelman, Carlos Andreson, Phil Bard, Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, Leroy Flint, Michael Gallagher, Minetta Good, Boris Gorelick, Harry Gottlieb, Riva Helfond, Jacob Kainen, Florence Kent, Chet La More, Joseph Leboit, Nan Lurie, Kyra Markham, Hugh Miller, Charles Ramus, Lillian Richter, Bernard Schardt, Herman Volz, Albert Webb, and Hale Woodruff.\n\nA Question of Emphasis: Louise Fishman Drawing is the first career-spanning exhibition and publication of Fishman’s works on paper from 1964 to the present. Citing John Cage’s response in 1965 to the question “What is drawing?,” A Question of Emphasis encompasses collage, oil and wax, thread, acrylic text, ink, charcoal, printmaking, oil stick, watercolor, and tempera in Japanese-bound Leporello (accordion) books.\n\nFishman’s drawings are distinctive within her full oeuvre because many are dedicated to lovers—an illustrious network of lesbian writers, scholars, and critics that includes Bertha Harris; Esther Newton; and Ingrid Nyeboe, Fishman’s spouse and longtime partner of the late critic and writer Jill Johnston. Fishman’s works on paper also honor the artist’s greatest teachers—Paul Cézanne, Piet Mondrian, Franz Kline, John Cage, Eva Hesse, and Agnes Martin among them. Some works are collaborative, including prints Fishman made using her artist mother’s collagraphic plates, and her “angry women” acrylic text series made for friends and muses during periods of feminist consciousness raising in the 1970s. Drawing is often perceived as a window to an artist’s interiority and a spontaneous activity that happens more readily than painting on canvas. This project is a curatorial experiment that instead follows Fishman’s lead, through drawing, to convene a community of living and historical figures that are integral to the construction of self. While centered on the artist’s hand, Fishman’s works on paper are in fact radically open and give audiences a strong perspective of artmaking as a world-making project.\n\nA Question of Emphasis examines the relationship between artist’s biography and drawing through feminist and queer perspectives.

The border has become the ultimate machine of necropolitics and the nullification of the human body, a system led by the United States. Intergalactix further investigates the implications of borders and how their construction is conducive to violence against womxn, femme, and trans individuals. Intergalactix presents a platform of exchange and dialogue among artists, poets, activists, curators, and writers from diverse fields and practices all working against isolation.\n\nIntergalactix maps connections, intimacies, and histories across physical and symbolic borders between multiple communities. Rather than reaffirming the geographical borders that isolate us within North and South America, Intergalactix seeks to destabilize their formation and examine a network of resistance, a web of forces, a collective of work that spirals from the heart of the continent, Central America.\n\nThis exhibition features newly commissioned work by Tanya Aguiñiga, Beatriz Cortez, and Cog•nate Collective, among other artists.\n\nIntergalactix holds dialogue with An Offering of Honor, a performance by Amitis Motevalli that challenges the normalization of domestic and intimate violence against girls, femme, and womxn, and the underreported cases of femicide across the globe. See the performance in LACE’s storefront here.\n\nOfficial programming for Intergalactix will begin in fall 2020 with a series of closed encuentros, one of which will be in collaboration with Motevalli.\n\nAt a date to be announced, LAXART will present a symposium in advance of the group exhibition Life on Earth: Ecofeminist Art since 1979. A central component of exhibition research, this symposium will convene scholars, artists, activists, and art historians to discuss historical and current topics around ecofeminist art. The exhibition itself will survey four decades of ecofeminist thought and action in art.\n\nEcofeminism is a theoretical, academic, and activist movement that locates critical connections between gender oppression and the exploitation of natural resources. It developed in the early 1980s from the environmental, antinuclear, and feminist movements; in addition to its primary concerns around the subordination of nature and women, ecofeminism sought to resist racism, homophobia, and the capitalist patriarchy. As ecofeminist thought spread, women artists became key proponents of the new movement. This symposium and exhibition will consider the important new forms of art that built upon the feminist, conceptual, site-specific, and performance art of the 1970s to draw critical parallels between the exploitation of nature and women. Topics addressed will include antinuclear activism, environmental racism, indigenous rights, social ecology, gender injustice, water rights, lesbian separatism, and reproductive issues, among other important themes.\n\nBallotBox uses an intersectional lens to examine past and present voting rights and connections between the centennial of the 19th Amendment, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Voting Rights Act; and this year’s presidential and state-wide elections. The year 2020 is significant for reflection on what a vote is worth, while considering contemporary voter engagement and the monumental efforts in past decades to secure voting rights in the United States. Using art as a catalyst for community engagement, five artists with diverse practices have drawn on personal stories and historical narrative to create new work that explores issues related to voting rights, democracy, and citizenship.\n\nBallotBox creates a bridge between art and activism by sharing personal and political narratives, inspiring voter engagement, and creating a public dialog about how we can build a more equitable democracy. Sandra Charles (Louisville, KY), Brianna Harlan (Brooklyn, NY), Jennifer Maravillas (Brooklyn, NY), Taylor Sanders (Louisville, KY), and James R. Southard (Lexington, KY) are participating artists. BallotBox is curated by Skylar Smith, and is in partnership with Louisville Metro, Louisville Visual Art, and What is a Vote Worth Louisville. BallotBox is funded by an “Advancing Democracy, Building Power” grant from Kentucky Foundation for Women and a Great Meadows Foundation Curator Grant.\n\nFor Madison Square Park Conservancy’s forty-first public art commission, Maya Lin realized a new, site-responsive installation that brings into focus the ravages of climate change on woodlands around the world. Ghost Forest takes the form of a towering grove of spectral cedar trees, all sourced from the region and presented in sharp contrast to the Park’s lush tree line. The work’s name derives from the natural phenomenon of ghost forests, vast tracts of forestland that have died off due to climate change, sea-level rise, and saltwater infiltration. Ghost Forest builds on Lin’s practice of addressing climate change within her work and serves as a call to action to the 60,000 visitors who pass through the Park daily. The installation is complemented by a series of public programs, lectures, and events that explore the challenges of climate change and propose potential nature-based solutions.\n\nTo create Ghost Forest, Lin worked with the Conservancy to source dead trees from the Pine Barrens in New Jersey, a vulnerable site that has suffered severe deprivation. The Atlantic Cedars installed in the Park were all afflicted by extreme salinization during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, victims of rising seas and salt-water inundation, and slated to be cleared to allow for the regeneration of surrounding trees. The installation brings the dire reality of this naturally occurring phenomenon to audiences in a dense urban environment and encourages a consideration of nature-based practices that can protect and restore the ecosystem.\n\nAlisa Sikelianos-Carter is a mixed-media painter from upstate New York. She is a 2021 Foreland Studio Fellow and a 2020 Sustainable Arts Foundation recipient. She has been awarded residencies at the Fountainhead Residency, the Millay Colony for the Arts, NXTHVN, Vermont Studio Center, the Wassaic Project, and Yaddo. She has participated in group exhibitions at James Cohan Gallery (New York City), Kavi Gupta Gallery (Chicago), and Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery (London), and she has an upcoming solo show at Fridman Gallery (Beacon, New York).\n\nSikelianos-Carter asserts that Black features are a manifestation of a sacred and divine technology that has served as a means of survival, both physically and metaphysically. She envisions a cosmically bountiful world that celebrates and pays homage to ancestral majesty, power, and aesthetics. Inspired by traditionally Black hairstyles, Sikelianos-Carter uses web- and catalog-sourced images to construct new archetypes. Through her exploration of opulent, luminescent materials, she is creating a mythology that is centered on Black resistance and uses the body as a site of alchemy and divinity.\n\nCreative Counterpoints—an annual MassArt series founded and organized by Marika Preziuso, associate professor of world literature—is devoted to the intersections of narratives of creativity and difference as investigated by visual artists, writers, public intellectuals, and other culture makers. The speaking program specifically addresses gender and sexual identities in difference, looking at the contemporary world of the arts and culture within the U.S. and transnationally. Past Creative Counterpoints speakers include Maria Popova, media producer, blogger, and founder of Brain Pickings; and Jack Halberstam, prolific author and professor of English and gender studies at Columbia University.\n\nWe are excited to contribute to the Feminist Art Coalition in spring 2021 with a program that reflects the call of twenty-first-century feminism to engage critically with transnational arts and activism. The event will feature two prominent women creatives—author and activist Valeria Luiselli (Tell Me How It Ends and Lost Children Archive) and visual artist Scherezade Garcia—who employ their talent to tell narratives of border-crossings, uprooting, and transplanting, and the agency that exists in every participatory act of cultural translation through the arts. Creative Counterpoints also features the participation of MassArt students and faculty. This event is cosponsored by the MassArt Art Museum (MAAM), Boston’s newest museum featuring visionary artists at the forefront of contemporary art. Events and exhibitions at MAAM are free and open to the public.\n\nThroughout her nearly fifty-year career, American photographer Susan Meiselas (b. 1948) seeks to bear witness to stories that might otherwise go unnoticed. She has traveled from rural county fairs to conflict-ridden Central America, focusing her lens on what she thinks the public needs to see. Collaboration is an integral part of the artist’s practice, and she works closely with her subjects, and over long periods, to bring their voices to the issues they face, often returning to communities she has photographed to reconnect and examine how their perspectives have changed over time. A member of the international photographic cooperative Magnum Photos since 1976, Meiselas creates photographs that raise provocative questions about the documentary practice and the relationship between photographer and subject.\n\nSusan Meiselas: Through a Woman’s Lens presents never-before-shown photographs alongside iconic series that reflect the artist’s ongoing commitment to sharing the stories of women. The exhibition will be accompanied by a virtual tour and a series of webinars exploring feminist themes.\n\nThe MAM’s Currents series is part of an ongoing cycle of exhibitions that explores new trends in contemporary art, and, in the case of Currents 38: Christy Matson, the recent, strong embrace of fiber by contemporary artists. The series began in 1982, and has featured such artists as Günther Förg, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Rachel Harrison, and Julian Schnabel, as well as such craftspeople as Richard DeVore, Gord Peteran, and Robert Turner.\n\nThe next Currents exhibition—the thirty-eighth in the series and the first to feature textiles—will explore the woven pictures of Christy Matson, a highly skilled weaver who creates captivating tactile surfaces on a TC2 digital jacquard loom. Historically viewed as women’s work, woven textiles from Matson’s recent bodies of work will be displayed in order to contextualize a new series that will debut in Currents 38. Her most recent work questions ideas of memory and imagination through historic weave structures and textile techniques, and Matson’s new weavings will likely build upon these themes.\n\nIn a career spanning nearly five decades, Leslie Thornton has produced an influential body of work in film and video. Her early encounters with experimental, structuralist, and cinéma-vérité traditions as a student in the 1970s fueled her iconoclastic take on the moving image and gave shape to her practice of weaving together her own footage and voice with archival film and audio. In part through her forceful and dynamic use of sound, Thornton exposes the limits of language and vision in her works, while acknowledging the ways that language and vision nevertheless remain central to scientific discourse and narrative in general. Engaging these themes within a focused survey, Thornton’s List Center exhibition will mark the artist’s first U.S. solo museum exhibition and most comprehensive presentation to date.\n\nThe relationship between technology, power, and violence is an enduring concern for Thornton. In early works, such as X-TRACTS (1975), All Right You Guys (1976), and Jennifer, Where Are You? (1981), Thornton contends with the basic conditions of representation in film and how the camera itself wields power. In Let Me Count the Ways (2004–ongoing) and Cut from Liquid to Snake (2018), Thornton takes up the United States’ history of nuclear warfare—a subject fraught with personal resonance for her, as both her father and grandfather were involved in the Manhattan Project, the top-secret effort that produced the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Japan in the final days of World War II. A touchstone of experimental film, Peggy and Fred in Hell is a multi-chapter work that surfaces the Cold War-era anxieties that shaped Thornton’s formative years and plumbs the psychological impact of technology in postwar America.\n\nThornton’s recent film Ground (2020) embeds the voice of a physicist discussing particle decay within elegant yet foreboding technological landscapes. Hemlock (2021), which debuts in this exhibition, complements and builds on Ground. In this newly commissioned two-channel video, conversations about particle physics, multidimensional universes, and antimatter overlay shallow-focus shots taken in the woods of New Hampshire that reveal intimate patterns of growth and decomposition.\n\nThe exhibition’s title, Begin Again, Again—borrowed from a line in Peggy and Fred in Hell—alludes to human-made cycles of destruction and renewal as well the hallmarks of Thornton’s practice: an accumulation and repetition of images and language and a radically open-ended approach to observing, processing, and understanding.\n\nNiki de Saint Phalle (American and French, 1930‒2002) created exuberant works intended to transform environments, individuals, and society. The first New York museum exhibition of the work of this visionary feminist and activist artist will feature over 100 works that highlight Saint Phalle’s interdisciplinary approach and engagement with pressing social and political issues.\n\nEarly in her career, Saint Phalle pushed against accepted artistic practices, creating work that used assemblage and performative modes of production. Beginning in the late 1960s, Saint Phalle started making large-scale sculptures, which led to an expansion of her practice into architectural projects, sculpture gardens, books, prints, films, theater sets, clothing, jewelry, and, famously, her own perfume. Addressing subjects that ranged from women’s rights to climate change and HIV/AIDS awareness, Saint Phalle was often at the vanguard in addressing the social and political issues of her time.\n\nCentral to the exhibition is an examination of Saint Phalle’s large-scale outdoor sculptures and architectural structures, including her central life project Tarot Garden, a massive architectural park outside Rome, Italy, which she began constructing in the late 1970s and continued to develop alongside key collaborators until her death. Opened to the public in 1998, the garden and its structures, which are based on the Major Arcana of the tarot deck, allow for moments of interaction and reflection that underscore Saint Phalle’s use of art to alter perception. The exhibition will include photographs and drawings of Tarot Garden as well as models that Saint Phalle created for its various structures.\n\nFor over thirty years, multidisciplinary visual artist Andrea Bowers (American, b. 1965) has made art that activates. Bowers works in a variety of mediums, from video to colored pencil to installation art, and speaks directly to pressing national issues. Her work combines an artistic practice with activism and advocacy, giving voice to stories rarely seen or heard.\n\nBorn in Wilmington, Ohio, Bowers received her MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 1992 and currently lives and works in Los Angeles. She built an international reputation as a chronicler of contemporary history, documenting activism as it unfolds and collecting research on the front lines of protest. Her subject matter contends with issues like immigration, workers’ rights, environmentalism, and women’s rights, presented in a range of media. Her empathetic and labor-intensive practice draws attention to the humanity impacted by injustice—shifting the conversation from politics to people.\n\nThe first museum retrospective surveying over two decades of Bowers’s practice, this exhibition is divided into four thematic sections: feminism, the environment, immigration, and labor, with a selection of her works rendered in neon. Highlights of the exhibition include Courtroom Drawings (Steubenville Rape Case, Text Messages Entered As Evidence, 2013) (2014) and My Name Means Future (2020). These two works speak to the range of issues in Bowers’s work, the former emerged from her work as an embedded observer in a landmark sexual assault case; the latter from her involvement in activism around the Dakota Access Pipeline project.\n\nLondon-born Colombian artist Carolina Caycedo (b. 1978) lives and works in Los Angeles. Through her studio practice and fieldwork with riverside communities impacted by large-scale infrastructure projects around the world, Caycedo makes work that addresses humanity’s relationship with nature. She works on the front-lines of social and environmental justice, gathering materials, experiences, objects, and feelings to make her multidisciplinary work.\n\nInformed by Indigenous philosophies, Caycedo’s work challenges us to understand nature not as a resource to be exploited, but as a living and spiritual entity that unites people beyond borders. Her innovative approach integrates an art-making practice in the studio with actions in communities affected by the large-scale extraction of natural resources by corporations and governments, inviting viewers to consider the unsustainable pace of growth under capitalism—and how we might bolster resistance, solidarity, and cultural and environmental biodiversity.\n\nCarolina Caycedo: From the Bottom of the River surveys the last ten years of Caycedo’s artistic practice and prominently features Be Dammed (2012–ongoing), a multimedia project that examines the impact of hydroelectric dams and other major infrastructure projects on riverine communities and the natural world. It also features Caycedo’s powerful Cosmotarrayas, a series of net sculptures produced through fieldwork in areas where the privatization of waterways has irrevocably altered the ability of local communities to live and work. The exhibition encompasses video, drawing, photography, sculpture, and performance and reflects the importance of process and participation in Caycedo’s work.\n\nTala Madani is the first North American survey of this celebrated artist’s paintings, animations, and drawings. Eliciting curiosity, fantasy, and repulsion, Madani’s paintings and animations are replete with irony and lewd, mischievous narrative. In them, a cadre of mostly male middle-aged figures play out absurd sociocultural dynamics to darkly comic ends, engaging in humiliating, sometimes violent scenarios where the stakes are unclear and the aims dubious at best. Taken together, Madani’s work forms a powerful meditation on the deeply seated fears, conflicts, and desires of our present day, in which the potent and combustible relationship between art history and global history comes to a head.\n\nOrganized by Mia Locks, senior curator and head of new initiatives, with Kimi Kitada, curatorial assistant, the exhibition will be on view from November 2020 through April 2021 at MOCA’s Grand Avenue location in downtown Los Angeles. Bringing together fifteen years of the artist’s incisive work, it will also include a selection of the artist’s notebooks, offering a rare look at the rich process by which Madani develops her ribald menagerie of characters and scenarios. The exhibition will be accompanied by a fully illustrate"
