        "text": "EXPERTISE: AI and applications to digital health, 5G/6G communications and cybersecurity\n\nDr. Honggang Wang, founding chair of the Graduate Department of Computer Science and Engineering, has received research grants totaling over $5 million from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nCurrent projects include developing autonomous vehicle navigation algorithms for detecting hazardous road situations to make cars safer and developing AI-powered wearable devices to monitor drug use and aid in disease detection.\n\nPrevious work includes a portable, lightweight “intensive care unit,” which is a wearable biosensor system incorporating a wireless body area network that monitors remotely the physiology of infants to anticipate life-threatening events, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\n\nDr. Wang, who is an IEEE Fellow and IEEE Distinguished Lecturer, received Outstanding Researcher and Leadership Awards from the IEEE Communications Society and served as chair of both the IEEE Technical Committee on Multimedia Communications and IEEE e-Health Technical Committee.\n\nIn addition, he served as editor-in-chief of the peer-reviewed IEEE Internet of Things (IoT) Journal. His book, Wireless Health, published by Springer, was one of the first in the field.\n\nDr. Wang holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and an M.S. in computer science and engineering and a B.E. in electrical engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in Chengdu, China.\n\nSee his full bio.\n\nEXPERTISE: Data Systems, Research Design\n\nDr. Jason Bryer is an assistant professor and associate director in the data science and information systems department at the City University of New York. He is the principal investigator of the $3 million FIPSE and $3.8 million IES-funded Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills.\n\nDr. Bryer's research interests include quasi-experimental designs, with an emphasis in propensity score analysis, data systems to support formative assessment and the use of open source software for conducting reproducible research. He is the author of over a dozen R packages, including three related to conducting propensity score analyses.\n\nHe holds an M.S. and Ph.D. in educational psychology and methodology from the State University of New York (SUNY).\n\nEXPERTISE: Financial Instrument Pricing and Forecasting\n\nAndy Catlin, a data scientist and data system developer, teaches the Capstone; Internship; and Independent Study, as well as training courses Python, R, Java, C, C++, SQL, and NoSQL. He is an expert in financial instrument pricing and forecasting using the weighted Black Scholes Merton model, as well as incorporating yield curve analysis into emerging markets products.\n\nHe is also experienced at migrating client-server systems into web and cloud-hosted solutions, and his key initiatives included incorporating artificial intelligence and neural networks in specialized applications, C++ financial libraries, security authentication bottleneck correction, patient-days forecasting model using Box Jenkins, production replication architectures, and multiphase commit and log-shipping architectures.\n\nHis major clients include Fidelity Investments, Smart Money, Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the National Football League and The Wall Street Journal.
