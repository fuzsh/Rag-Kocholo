        "text": "A Record of Success\n\nWhat do Yeshiva students do after they graduate? Take a look at the impressive positions our graduates hold as a result of their Yeshiva education!\n\nThe third of four videos in the PEARLS month-long video campaign, A Record of Success, displays a few of the many members of the Chassidic community, who are successful, professional yeshiva graduates. Hear from Yeshiva graduates the skills and knowledge they learned in their religious and secular studies that they use in the professional world today.\n\nHighway Bridge Collapses While Cars Drive Across\n\nA bridge in the heart of Genoa collapsed on Tuesday, killing at least 20 people as dozens of vehicles and tons of concrete and steel plunged onto city streets below in a disaster that raised concerns about Italy’s aging infrastructure.\n\n“The image is truly apocalyptic,” Matteo Pucciarelli, a journalist reporting on the disaster, told the newspaper La Repubblica. “It’s as if a bomb had fallen on this very important artery.”\n\nThe highway bridge fell by as much as 148 feet just before noon, taking about three dozen cars and three trucks with it, according to Angelo Borrelli, chief of the Civil Protection Department.\n\nThe national police noted that there was a “violent cloudburst” at about the time the section fell, and some witnesses said the bridge was struck by lightning just before it collapsed, though it was not clear whether the storm contributed to the failure.\n\nGive Devorah a Chance\n\ncharidy.com/devorah\n\nDevorah is the adorable six-year-old daughter of Shloimy and Malky Hoffman. A bright child she was born without a jaw. The repercussions are distressing, to say the least: Devorah’s face is severely misshapen, forcing her to breathe through a tracheotomy in her throat and to eat via a feeding tube. To make matters worse, other children (and even adults) are often at a loss for how to interact with her.\n\nAlthough devastating, with your help Devorah’s symptoms need not be long-lasting. With just a few surgeries, she can begin a new life as a normal child. Specialists in Boston have the necessary capabilities to fashion a jaw for Devorah using bones from other parts of her body. A follow-up surgery would be required to insert metal pieces that will help guide the newly-placed bones and allow them to grow properly. Finally, plastic surgery afterward will help reconstruct her face so that the hardships Devorah currently faces can become a distant memory.\n\nThe problem, of course, is money. Besides for the expensive surgeries, Devorah’s parents will incur heavy expenses traveling to and staying in Boston. Devorah is their only child; a quick and clever girl, she fully understands her situation. Please consider helping out Shlomo and Malky as they try to give their daughter a better chance at life.\n\nthe money will be paid for Devorah surgeries and health coverage and travel expenses during the medical procedure.\n\nBlumstein Brothers ft, Moshe Storch - Thank You Hashem\n\nDownload\n\nA song written with Hashem!\n\nThree brothers, four friends, open their hearts with great joy...
