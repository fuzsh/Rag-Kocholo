        "text": "For some perspective, Ukraine spans an area about twice the size of Italy. And its geographical size is matched by its cultural richness and diversity.\n\nThe sunflower (or \"soniashnyk\") is Ukraine's national flower and has been grown in the region since the middle of the 18th century, cultivated for its seeds or crushed for oil. They are also a cultural symbol of growing in tough circumstances, and a decades-long symbol of peace.\n\nUNESCO designates some of the most important parts of the world, and Ukraine is lucky enough to be home to seven: from iconic churches like St. Sophia Cathedral in the capital city of Kyiv, to the natural landscapes and deserts.\n\nLocated close to Kherson, Oleshky Sands is the second largest desert in Europe. It covers an area that's ten times bigger than Liechtenstein! The desert consists of numerous bahrans and in summer their temperature reaches 75°C.\n\nWhen asked to think of a Ukrainian food, many people might think of the humble chicken kyiv, however, it was most likely not invented in Ukraine at all. Instead, the national Ukrainian dish is actually borsch, a distinctive red soup made from beetroot and beef.\n\nOrginially, 'Shchedryk' is a Ukrainian 'shchedrivka', or New Year's song. In 1916 composer Mykola Leontovych arranged its choral version. In a few years Shchedryk crossed the ocean and was adapted into the iconic Christmas \"Carol of the Bells\" by Peter J. Wilhousky.\n\nThere are seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed in Ukraine, six of which are cultural sites and one of which is a natural site. The sites are at various locations. Discover some of them worth knowing and visiting.\n\nSaint Sophia Cathedral has already been in the historical center of ancient Kyiv for a thousand years. It is the most ancient Christian church that is fully preserved in the East Slavic area. It was the first Ukrainian location listed by UNESCO.\n\nThis site comprises undisturbed examples of temperate forests that demonstrate the postglacial expansion process of European beech. Six Ukrainian Carpathian forests were featured in the UNESCO list in 2007, and seven were consequently added in ten years' time.\n\nThe ensemble of the Metropolitan Residence spreads over 12 hectares in the northwestern part of Chernivtsi. The residence, whose buildings are now part of Chernivtsi University, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\n\nThere are eight wooden churches in Ukraine built of horizontal wooden logs between the 16th and 19th centuries by communities of Orthodox and Greek Catholic faiths. The churches were added to the UNESCO list in 2018.\n\n“Flowers” is a still life by Anastasia Rak, an artist from the Poltava region, who continued the traditions of Ukrainian folk painting on glass.\n\nThe attributes of the painting, that combined with the warmth of the soul and love for the native land of the artist, are felt in the vibration of color, lines, and light.\n\nThis fragile still life is a peculiar symbol of the homeland, family, parental home.\n\nUkraine’s 603 thousand square kilometers are home to 53 magnificent national parks, 19 natural reserves and five biosphere reserves. Enjoy the best bird views from the most picturesque mountain forests.\n\nCarpathian Park is a must-visit if one wants to truly experience the beauty of the Ukrainian Carpathians. Among five mountains, five waterfalls, and two high-mountain lakes, the park has Ukraine’s highest mountain – Hoverla.\n\nThis 80-meter-high rock-cave complex formed at the bottom of the Paleogene Sea more than 70 million years ago. It did not matter whether one was a peasant fleeing from lordly oppression or a warrior defending native land – the Rocks were always there as a fortress.\n\nMakovytsia Mountain is 984 meters high, one of the highest peaks in the vicinity of the city of Yaremche. From the top, one can see panoramas of picturesque mountain landscapes: the Yavirnyk ridge, and the peaks of Khomyak, Sinyak, and Dovbushanka.\n\nThe wooded part of the Pokutsko-Bukovyna Carpathians is home to Hutsulshchyna National Park. The park is most valued for its primeval and ancient forests that are mostly untouched by humans.\n\nRosokhata Mountain Lalley lies 791 meters above sea level. Six months out of the year, Hutsul shepherds live there in a hut with a cheese factory. They make cheese, cottage cheese, and butter, which can be bought and tasted there.\n\nThe park is located in Kremenets, Ternopil region: a meet point of the three large Ukrainian lands – Volyn, Podillia, and Halychyna. Kremenets Mountains, which frame the city, according to the legends, are home to good spirits. The park has 12 peaks and 12 tourist routes.\n\nUzhansky park, located in the Eastern Carpathians, is bigger than territories of states like San Marino, Liechtenstein, and Malta put together. Its territory is covered with the biggest and oldest oaks in Ukraine and old beech forests protected by UNESCO.\n\nVerkhovyna park has some of the most unspoiled natural beauty spots as this part of the Carpathian Mountains is quite hard to reach. Verkhovyna is also the center of Hutsul culture, represented by local crafts and museums."
