SUMMARY OF THE YEAR» aims to show to what extent the views, assessments, and life of Ukrainians have changed in various spheres during the year of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. o Quantitative survey by the CATI method (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) based on a random sample of mobile phone numbers. o Sample population: 1000 respondents. o The sample is random, representative in terms of age, gender, and type of settlement. The margin of error of the study with a confidence probability of 0.95: does not exceed 3.1%. o Dates: February 6-7, 2023 To conduct a comprehensive study, three separate stages were carried out: o Online survey by the CAWI method (Computer Assisted Web Interviewing) was conducted on the basis of a random sample of mobile phone numbers on the Rating Online platform. o Sample population: 600 respondents. o The margin of error: does not exceed 4%. o Dates: February 10-13, 2023 o Focus group research with three online focus group discussions with respondents from 23 cities and towns of Ukraine. o Number of respondents: 26. o Dates: February 4-5, 2023 Audience: the population of Ukraine aged 18 and older in all regions, except for the temporarily occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas, as well as territories where there was no Ukrainian mobile connection at the time of the survey. The results were weighted using current data from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The report also includes data from previous waves of monitoring \"Ukraine in conditions of war\" by the Sociological Group Rating (the date of the survey is indicated in the report). A total of 21 waves of public research have been conducted over the year since the full-scale invasion, most (16) of which were funded by the Sociological Group Rating. This study was also funded by the Sociological Group Rating. The report was performed by a team of Olga Melnyk, Tetiana Skrypchenko, Nataliya Khalimonenko, Veronika Kostenko - under the leadership of the director of the Rating Lab Research Laboratory, Doctor of Psychological Sciences, Professor Marianna Tkalych and the founder of the Rating Group group of companies Igor Tyshchenko.

Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 POLITICAL CHANGES People's memories of February 24, 2022 reveal shock, confusion, uncertainty, unpreparedness. Despite this, these days, a year after the full-scale invasion, the confidence in victory is 95%, compared to 56% in January 2022. The majority (63%) believes that victory requires at least six months or even more time. 4 While assessing the financial situation at the end of 2022, two-thirds of respondents note a deterioration in their financial situation, one-third states lack of changes. At the same time, almost 40% (against 14% at the end of 2021) have experienced an increase of confidence in the future. The priorities for country’s recovery are the restoration of enterprises and jobs and the reconstruction of damage, because most Ukrainians want to work, not to receive social assistance. Ukraine is going through a difficult period of its development, rethinking its role in history. In general, the war has contributed to increasing the trust of citizens in state institutions. Trust in the Armed Forces of Ukraine has grown from 65% to 97%, in the President - from 36% to 90%. And while the majority (65%) would not mind Zelenskyi to be re-elected for the next term, the number of those dissatisfied with the performance of the Verkhovna Rada (54%) is higher as compared to the number of those satisfied (37%). And if elections were held in the nearest future, almost half would look for an alternative among new parties. There has been an increase in trust in mass media, but the main feature of wartime is a sharp change in the channels of communication and the receipt of information by citizens. And while trust in national and local media has grown, the frequency of consumption of their news content has decreased, on the contrary. Instead, there has been a significant growth of groups and channels in messengers (from 11% to 41%), as well as YouTube (from 21 to 29%). Social networks have retained their influence (35%). One of the direct consequences of the Russian invasion was the strengthening of Euro-Atlantic moods among Ukrainians, which revealed record figures for the entire history of the country. These days, 87% support Ukraine joining the European Union, 86% - NATO. While in 2021 the majority of citizens had a negative image of the state, now more than half speak of a distinctly or moderately positive image. Illustrative in this regard is the indicator of the correct direction of the country’s development, which is the highest for the entire history of measurements (over the year, fluctuations have been at the level of 70-80%), which is based on high trust in the military and political leadership of the country, faith in our victory, a significant increase in self-esteem, and pride for the country, as well as the realization of the people's desire for Euro-Atlantic integration. A significant increase in social self-esteem is recorded. The majority of respondents rated Ukraine’s position above average - 4.6 points out of 7, which is 1.5 times higher than the 2021 indicator. Two-thirds of the respondents rated Ukraine's future prospects at the highest level. The main emotion respondents feel when thinking about Ukraine is pride. As a result of the full-scale invasion and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people, this indicator has more than doubled - from 34% to 75%. There have also been changes in national self- identification: the absolute majority of respondents identify themselves as citizens of Ukraine (compared to 2021, the indicator has increased from 76% to 94%). Half identify themselves as Europeans (double growth). 22% of Ukrainians switched to more frequent use of the Ukrainian language during the year of the war. RESUME\n\n5. Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 PSYCHOEMOTIONAL CHANGES AND ADAPTATION TO WAR Currently, negative emotions are more pronounced than positive, and therefore sadness (4.8) and anger (4.6) prevail over joy (4.1) and inspiration (4.3), between which fear (4.2) and disappointment (4.1) are located. And the most pronounced are excitement (5.0) and interest (4.8), which are neither unequivocally positive nor negative - it depends on the context. Over the year, the feeling of self-love has decreased, while love for others has increased; the tendency of affiliation (the desire to be with others) has worked, the personal gives way to the collective. Ukrainians are almost as prone to self-restraint as used to be six months ago - more than half (58%) believe that you should limit yourself significantly in terms of entertainment and shopping, and 37% are inclined to think that you should try to live a full life. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, 44% of Ukrainians had to be temporarily separated from their families. A year later, only 21% of them remain separated. Most of those who had to be separated from their family passed the test, and for 20% their relationship has even improved. 83% believe that you should be careful with people, while in 2020, only 54% expressed such opinion. It is about trust as a basic value, as trust in the world, which is undermined or destroyed by war. This especially applies to \"strangers\", or those who have become such, but seemed close. The attitude towards people who have left is ambiguous: women with children are tolerated the most; at the same time, the attitude towards men of military age is the most negative. 5 SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGES Despite the full-scale invasion, Ukrainians remain a humane and tolerant society, support for the death penalty has decreased from 52% to 42%. At the same time, the level of tolerance in society has increased during the war: the positive-neutral attitude towards the LGBT community has increased from 53% to 64%, and towards people who do not want to have children (childfree) it has increased from 57% to 67%. During the year of the war, faith in God has decreased somewhat: the percentage of those who do not doubt his existence has changed from 60% to 55%. Generally accepted norms and values have become more defined, so anomie moods have ceased to dominate: the number of those with a predominant anomie state (state of demoralization) has decreased from 72% to 48%. The biggest change has occurred regarding the improved understanding of what rules to follow and what to believe today. The war led to the loss of work for at least one-third of the working population, with a particularly difficult situation for displaced persons and residents of combat zones: half of them lost their jobs. Even among those who were able to continue working during the war, a half still has suffered a reduction in salaries. The most difficult situation with work was recorded in the first months of the war, later people began to return to work. Also, after a sharp drop in number of those willing to start their own business at the beginning of the war, their number has been gradually recovering. The main strategy for action in the case of income reduction remains the search for an additional source of income (has decreased from 62% to 54%): many people have started looking for a second job during the war or have started working more. However, not everyone has the ability to control their income (60%), it is especially difficult for the elderly people. Most citizens have suffered direct or indirect consequences of the full-scale invasion, only 14% have experienced no losses. Residents of the eastern regions have suffered the most losses, more than half of them have left their homes. Despite positive changes in society, optimism and absolute faith in victory, the war continues to inflict irreparable damage on Ukrainians and take away the most valuable. Over the last six months, the number of those who had lost relatives has almost doubled (from 9% to 17%), as has the number of those whose loved ones had been injured (from 8% to 13%). At the same time, there is an increase in the number of those who talk about the deterioration of their health (from 25% to 33%), as well as a decrease in the number of those who talk about loss of income (from 38% to 31%). Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the society has demonstrated a high level of vitality, the value of the Index has decreased minimally (from 3.9 to 3.7). About 8% believe they have serious disorders that greatly affect their lives. One-third claims having moderate disorders. \"Planning horizon\" is an important indicator of adaptation and it has not undergone significant changes: 45% currently do not plan their life at all. The number of those who have plans for several years ahead has decreased from 23% to 19%. RESUME\n\n7. Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 What was the first day of the war… Memories of February 24, 2022 are quite clear, as if it was yesterday. People remember in detail how and from whom they learned about the beginning of the war, recall their feelings and experiences - shock, confusion, uncertainty, unpreparedness. They remember panic (especially in the early hours) and fear, primarily for those oved ones and children. Until the last, they could not believe what was happening, because \"this cannot happen in the 21st century, in the center of Europe, in the center of the civilized world...\". 10 days before the start of the invasion, less than 30% rated such a threat as high. While one- third believed that there was no such threat or it was low. Basically, there was no any awareness that this could happen. This is a state of denial. In such a state, a person is not able to be rational and is guided by emotions. Kyrylo (Zaporizhzhia, 33 years old) recalls that \"we were always taught safety techniques, what to do on the water… and we didn't know what to do when the war started“. Women are more emotional in their memories. Olga (Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi, 31 years old) remembers how \"at 5 in the morning my husband woke me up and said that I had to go. It took us 2 hours to leave Kyiv. Fear, panic and I did not understand where to run, where is safe, what kind of things, products... All the time I was thinking – how to feed the children...\". Larysa (Odesa, 55 years) never thought that could happen to her, it was like “thunder in the clear sky. My son is fighting in Nikopol this year, I feel stress and fear. I am constantly afraid of phone calls ... \". Serhiy (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old) was at work that day: \"Of course there was a shock, a complete surprise. The fear was not for myself, actually I was not afraid for myself at all, but it was scary for my children and grandchildren. It was not clear what gonna happen tomorrow...\". Leonid (Reshetylivka, 65 years old) finished the night shift on February 24, took over on a peaceful day, and “when I left work, I was told – the war started. I went to enroll in TRO. They asked how old I was, smiled friendly and said: “We’ll call you”, and they keep calling until this day. I went to sign up for volunteers, the same situation. Now, thank God, I have already found what to do, I am making nets. You really need to adapt, don't hang your nose, this is real life too. And we need to live every day with faith in victory“.

Shots were heard. ...\". 7\n\n8. Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY.

Sociological group Rating conducted the first survey on the third day of the war. According to the results, the absolute majority of Ukrainians trusted the President and the Armed Forces, and faith in victory had grown from 70% (ten days before the invasion) to 88%. These days, a year from a full-scale invasion, the faith in victory is 95%, while in January 2022 it was 56%. These numbers are inspiring. Roman (Irpin, 43 years old) is sure that \"95-97% that we will win, and 3-5% mean that something can change, for instance all of China will come for Putin suddenly. I always leave something behind..., it is important that the joint budget of the countries providing aid significantly exceeds the Russian one“. Serhiy (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old) recalls that in 2014 \"we were barefoot. We could be taken with their bare hands. Who are we now? There is a big difference. If all this had happened in 2014, we would have become a colony. They would take everything“. Vyacheslav from Dnipro (56 years old) has no doubt that \"the victory will be ours, because the fighting spirit is very high. And the whole civilized world is behind us. In the beginning there was fear and doubt. Now the doubts are gone. A year for a military victory, and up to 10 years for the Marshal's plan, demining“. What is victory? Opinions differ. Anna from Drohobych (47 years old) believes that it is not about the victory of Ukraine but about the victory of the world, because it is \"a victory over the negative factor for the whole world, over a person who does not know how to manage power and his emotions. Victory over evil. This is a victory for Ukrainians - many will switch to the Ukrainian language. Many will realize what Ukraine is. Rethinking is also a kind of victory“. Leonid from Reshetylivka (65 years old) imagines the victory as \"peaceful sky, warm sun, confidence in the future\". The majority evaluates the victory in terms of the territories that Ukraine is expected to return. For Volodymyr from Varash (41 years old), victory is a \"return to the borders of 1991\". For Volodymyr from Lviv (46 years old), victory is \"not only the borders of 1991, but also Taganrog and the Krasnodar territories that can be captured“. For Yulia from Kharkiv (27 years old) it is \"the complete surrender of the Russian Federation\", while Larisa from Odesa (55 years old) believes that \"it is not a victory if there is no Crimea. Without it, these are all temporary arrangements“. «We have already won. We moved to the 21st century, while the Russians are lost it in the 19th», Volodymyr, Lviv, 46 years old\n\n9.

Faith in a quick victory is an affect and in fact is not a faith, but a desire for it to end sooner, a misunderstanding of the scale and complexity of what is happening, accordingly, a \"narrowing of the horizon\" within which a person is generally able to perceive reality. At the end of spring last year, despite the high level of confidence in victory, respondents began to more \"soberly\" assess the timing of its achievement. These days, the majority (63%) believe that victory requires at least six months, or even more time. About 20% believe in victory in a few months. Larysa (Odesa, 55 years old) believes in our victory, though she does not think that it will be quick. “Until the summer, we will 100% fight with these damn moscovites. And maybe even a little further. I would like it to be faster, of course, but it's not that easy... There are just a lot of them, they are like bugs, like worms crawling and crawling...“, Maksym, Zhytomyr, 41 years old. Natalya (Zvyahyl, 38 years old) says that \"the support of Europe\" adds to her confidence, while Oleksandr (Khmelnytskyi, 37 years old) appreciates \"the support of the West and the USA and the whole world. Since they supply a lot of weapons“.\n\n10. Self-esteem\n\n11. Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 PRIDE FOR THE COUNTRY Average value on a scale where 7 is the highest level and 1 is the lowest A significant increase in self-esteem is recorded. On a 7-point scale, where 7 is the highest level and 1 is the lowest, the majority of respondents rated Ukraine's position above average - 4.6 points, which is 1.5 times higher as compared to the 2021 indicator (3.0). The country's future of 10 years was assessed at 6.4 points out of 7, which is also significantly higher than the 2021 measurement (4.5). At the same time, two-thirds of the respondents rated Ukraine's future prospects at the highest level. Vyacheslav (Dnipro, 56 years old) believes that \"the nation began to emerge only now... this shake-up was needed. So that everything unnecessary falls away. Now the Ukrainian nation is being born. We are still gaining respect in the world. We are respected for our suffering“. Vyacheslav is convinced that \"we will become vikings in Europe after victory“. \"It was such an inconspicuous country, but it stood up for the whole of Europe\" (Natalya, Zvyahyl, 38 years old). This opinion is shared by 77% of respondents who believe that in this war Ukrainians are protecting the people of both Ukraine and Europe. Accordingly, pride is the main emotion that respondents feel when thinking about Ukraine. As a result of the full-scale invasion and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people, this indicator has more than doubled - from 34 to 75%. Thus, if today there was a choice to support the declaration of Independence of Ukraine, the absolute majority (86% definitely and 11% rather) would do it.

And with what is happening now, I see that the state will not have money for retirement. I have health problems and I don’t know how I will survive” (Tetiana, Kamyanske, 57 years old).

Up to three responses November, 2022 The study was carried out at the initiative of the non-governmental organization \"Center for Transatlantic Dialogue\" The most important programs that will ensure the possibility of continuing life in Ukraine are the restoration of enterprises and workplaces and the reconstruction of damages. Most Ukrainians want a job, not social assistance. Ukrainians want to secure their future, think about the future, want to work, live and raise their children here, and this is more important to them than one-time financial payments. The issue of work and business development is rather unifying, because a large part of citizens in all regions experienced a decrease in income. For residents of the East, as the most affected region, the issue of damage reconstruction is more critical, because many civilian objects were affected by the aggressor's actions, and rebuilding for them means the opportunity to return home. Medical and humanitarian assistance is more important for displaced persons who have completely changed their way of life. Humanitarian aid and child development programs are even more important for young people. For young parents, the changes brought by the war are also a challenge to ensure the safety of their children, trying to teach and not injure them in conditions when schools and kindergartens are operating in limited mode, and children's clubs they used to visit before the war are not functioning. Moreover, online education is accompanied by blackouts, the absence of the Internet, and constant interruptions of the educational process due to air alarms. Also, during the war, children, along with adults, have witnessed traumatic events and had to grow up quickly. «More attention should be paid to children. So that they can forget it. Especially those who survived the war», Anna, Drohobych, 47 years old It is also important that in Ukraine, as a post-Soviet country with strong traditional values and a weak culture of visiting psychologists, these days, every fifth in general and every third among young people say that psychosocial support is the most necessary. This is a very significant fact, which indicates the recognition of the problem of psychological traumatization in Ukraine, the significance and, most importantly, the willingness of the population to work on psychological health.

While in 2021 the majority of citizens were inclined towards a negative image of the state, these days more than half speak of a distinctly or moderately positive image of the state. Such changes have occurred due to positive dynamics of all indicators: § Despite the war, the country has reassessed the living conditions for citizens - the absolute majority believes that their conditions are generally satisfactory, and people do not want to lose what they have. The requirements for living conditions have decreased somewhat and the main thing has become to save one's life and home: “Ones we are alive, everything is fine“, as Oleksandr (Khmelnytskyi, 37 years old) says. § During the war, assessments of the effectiveness of the Ukrainian state have improved significantly. The achievements of Ukraine as a state were reassessed and evaluation of the ratio of achievements and failures of Ukraine during its independence has improved. § Significant positive changes have taken place referring opinions about the future of Ukraine, because the majority expects an improvement in the future.

In general, the war contributed to increasing the trust of citizens in state institutions, which in difficult conditions continue to function for the preservation of the country. During the war, Ukrainians became more aware of how important and vulnerable the state was. The invasion became a kind of test of the state institutions’ stability, national unity, and national identity.

UP TO THREE RESPONSES There has been an increase in trust in mass media, but the main feature of wartime is a sharp change in the channels of communication and obtaining information by citizens. And while trust in national and local media has increased, the frequency of consumption of their news content, on the contrary, has decreased: national television from 55% to 43%; local - from 11% to 7%. Internet pages have also lost. «In the beginning, we watched more TV. It was reassuring at first\" (Natalia, Zvyahyl, 38 years old). For Vyacheslav (Dnipro, 56 years old), the main source remains the Telemarathon, because \"there is an official assessment, and then there we have Internet for analysis and additions.“ On the contrary, there has been a significant growth of groups and channels in messengers (from 11% to 41%), as well as referring YouTube (from 21% to 29%). Social networks have retained their influence (35%). Volodymyr from Lviv (46 years old) says that \"there is less free time. The marathon has a time limit.

And I do not have enough information, and it is not always satisfactory. Therefore, practice searching for information on the Internet, Telegram channels.\" \"Now I watch the marathon somewhat less often, time does not allow.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 Politics and elections are frankly not the most popular topics during a war. However, this information seemed necessary to complete the picture of changes. Currently, 91% are satisfied with the performance of the President and the majority (65%) would not mind Zelenskyi to be re-elected for the next term, among the youth - more than 70%. Meanwhile, the number of those dissatisfied with the performance of the Verkhovna Rada (54%) is higher as compared to the number of those satisfied (37%). And if elections were held in the nearest future, almost half would look for an alternative among new parties (the majority among elderly people), while one-third would choose from the parties represented in the parliament. 45% are satisfied with the activities of the Cabinet of Ministers (45%), while 33% are dissatisfied 33%. For Vadym (Kyiv, 37 years old) “the president became more sympathetic, I began to trust him more after the events of February 24”. Volodymyr (Lviv, 46 years old) is impressed that \"the president did not leave Kyiv, and that deserves respect“. Inna (Kropyvnytskyi, 55 years old) likes that he “travels, knocks out weapons“. Oksana (Zaporizhzhia, 27 years old) believes that \"Zelenskyi is doing well now, but we’ll see in the future“. And Natalya (Zvyahyl, 38 years old) \"personally began to be more proud of my correct choice in the presidential elections“. In its turn, Volodymyr (Oleksandria, 65 years old) was not disappointed, because he \"did not expect real steps from a person without management experience. He did not have a long-term vision of the country's development. I have more questions than answers. Why is the money buried in the roads, and not in the military complex?\".

These days, 87% support Ukraine joining the European Union, 86% - NATO. Accordingly, Ukrainians see victory not only in the liberation of territories and the destruction of the enemy on the battlefield, but also in the fact that with real Euro-Atlantic integration we get real security guarantees. The history of support for joining NATO is interesting in terms of the dynamics of the war. Thus, after the record growth of the indicator at the beginning of March (up to 76%), there has been a drop at the end of March (to 68%), which was associated with delays in the supply of weapons, and the majority (89%) of the respondents believed that the most needed part of the international aid to Ukraine is closed sky. Since the summer, against the backdrop of active international military support, Ukrainians have demonstrated record support for Ukraine’s joining NATO, which has come close to supporting Ukraine's accession to the EU. Today, for Ukrainians, NATO is a guarantee of military security. The European Union means values and economic security. Kyrylo (Zaporizhzhia, 33 years old) expects \"after the war to join the EU and NATO“.

Regardless of age or region of residence. «I feel sorry for Russians for their stupidity, and Belarusians for their tolerance», Serhiy, Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old The majority reveals acutely negative attitude towards Russians. Volodymyr (Lviv, 46 years old) says that \"they are other people ... the situation there does not contribute to the development of adequate thinking. They are moody people, of the Asian type, with very narrow thinking. They are different. They have more bad traits. There is a term \"collective Putin\". Even considering the imaginary situation of meeting a Russian abroad after the victory, the majority leans towards the option of avoiding any contact and communication: “To avoid them like lepers and sick people\" (Vyacheslav, Dnipro, 56 years old). Oksana from Zaporizhzhia (27 years old) would like to «fence us from them\". The attitude towards Belarusians is also cool, although \"a little bit better as compared to Russians\" (Voladymyr, Varash, 41 years old).

While in April 2022 (after the liberation of Kyiv Oblast from the Russian invaders and the disclosure of atrocities in Buch, Borodyanka) two-thirds said that reconciliation was impossible, in August the number of such people has reduced to half. Currently, in February 2023, the number of those who believe that reconciliation is impossible has increased again to almost 60%. While in the East and South there are about half of them, in the West and Center - almost two-thirds. Every tenth allows reconciliation in 10-15 years, a quarter - in 20-30 years.

On the other hand, those who lost their jobs found it significantly more difficult to adapt to new conditions and overcome stress. Currently, the worst situation is recorded with the level of resilience (especially physical) among pensioners, who were socially and economically vulnerable and unprotected even before this stage of the war - and this definitely does not add confidence and additional resources to overcome stress and adapt. The tragic events of wartime have a significant impact on both physical and psychological health of a person. Those who have experienced losses, and especially those whose loved ones are now at the front, are under constant stress, worry about their loved ones, and although they are psychologically trying to hold on, they admit that it is difficult. Lariya, (Odesa, 55 years old), whose son is currently fighting, complains of a noticeable health deterioration: \"Due to stress, my hair started falling out and my teeth are crumbling, my eyesight is failing. I’ve changed my glasses twice. Drink Bifren, sedative drops. All this affects me very much. My son serves. And I don't sleep well at night, I don't fall asleep without a sleeping pill“ However, most of those who have loved ones at the front have a higher psychological resilience than physical resilience, and generally higher as compared to those who do not have loved ones who serve.\n\n32. Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 32 «War is also life, you have to pull yourself together», Larysa, Odesa, 55 years ADAPTATION Ukrainians also find solace and support in their favorite work: \"then we went back to work and started teaching lessons... time passes very quickly with children and life goes on\" (Vasyl, Pryluky, 33 years old). \"Planning horizon\" is an important indicator of adaptation. There were no significant changes in planning one's life compared to the pre-war period. Young people have the longest \"horizon\", older people have the shortest, as expected. Planning is also significantly correlated with income level and partly with gender: among women, almost half do not make plans at all. At the end of the first year of the active phase of the war, we can conditionally divide Ukrainians into those who were able to adapt and those who were not. \"Adapted\" have high vitality, low emotional stress and psychological exhaustion, use adequate strategies to overcome stressful situations, they do not expect the war to end \"tomorrow / in a week\", live today and try to perceive the war \"as a background, not a figure\". \"Non-adapted\" experience significant emotional stress, tend to limit themselves, feel guilt, fear, shame, suspicion, and mistrust of others, they are not so stable, instead they are psychologically exhausted, and do not have effective strategies for coping with stress. Ukrainians have different arguments on how best to adapt and survive the war. Vyacheslav (Dnipro, 56 years old) believes that \"you can adapt to the climate, but war must be perceived soberly. Perceive sober and believe. And then we will be able to survive...\".

Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY. SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 33 ADAPTATION Since the beginning of the war, the attitude towards air alarms has also changed - now people relatively less worry and disrupt the usual rhythm of life, even after the start of massive rocket attacks in October 2022: \"we went out, looked... The rocket flew by, so it didn't reach us\" (Kyrylo, Zaporizhzhia, 33 years old). People often admit that they started to simply ignore the alarm signal - \"the work will not do itself“. In this context, Ukrainians demonstrate a less responsible attitude towards danger: \"In Sumy, until March 1, I went to a bomb shelter and even spent the night there, then I left for Poltava - there people calmly responded to the air alarm and did not go anywhere. Now even in Sumy, people don't go to the shelter“ (Oleksandra, Sumy, 22 years old). The same applies to the work of various institutions: \"communal workers perform as they used to and still work. The only thing is that we are collapsing the high-rise works, collecting the towers. And the girls from the greenhouse complex, because of the glass, dangerous structures. And the work continues“. (Volodymyr, Lviv, 46 years old). One of the exceptions is everything related to children (their own or other people's children, for whom they are responsible: \"I confess, I woke up at night, pushed the child with her mother into the corridor, and I myself was so tired that I just returned to bed\" (Maksym, Zhytomyr, 41 years old). Teachers and educators take a more responsible approach to air alarms: \"We have a proven algorithm at work. We take the children to a safe place, because we are learning. We are not used to it, but we have adapted. But we always respond to sirens, because you never know what will happen\" (Anna, Drohobych, 47 years old). They really believe in air defense: \"God save our air defense that they shoot down everything.\" But there are comments for the authorities regarding the organization and arrangement of shelters and rules of behavior during alarms: \"there is a negative point that interferes with work and life… there is a rule that people are taken out of any shopping center, transport. I don't understand our leaders, because we don't have shelters everywhere in our country. But people are actually pushed out into the street, and if a rocket really falls somewhere nearby, they are under a greater impact than if they were somewhere in a store\" (Roman, Irpin, 43 years old). The most uncomfortable and stressful for the majority were blackouts after the first hits in the energy system of Ukraine. While it is still difficult without light, but at the same time \"light is not the biggest problem at all\" - and this is the general opinion, regardless of whether the lights are turned off according to the schedule or without any schedule for several days: \"if to consider 10 points scale, then we have now 7-6 in terms of blackouts, tolerable. Even if it was 3-2-1, there would be no options, we would tolerate that too\" (Maksym, Zhytomyr, 41 years old). No matter how difficult it is, especially where blackouts are long, and it becomes not only a household problem, but also a psychological problem, people are still ready to endure and wait: \"It is morally exhausting when there is no connection for 3 days, I cannot call those who I am worried about. Old people and children freeze where there is electric heating. The only thing that helps is faith. And you look at it differently“. (Olena, Chornomorsk, 59 years old). Currently, most people are used to it. The country got into a rhythm and adapted: businesses bought generators and other equipment, and ordinary citizens also acquired the appropriate devices and learned to plan their lives according to the blackout schedules: \"people adapt in terms of schedules - it's better not to go anywhere, or go to bed already, because there is no sense to wait\" (Voladymyr, Varash, 41 years old). They are rethinking the attitude to household comfort: “They turn on the light for 1 hour and you are happy. We have started treating things differently\" (Olena, Chornomorsk, 59 years old). Russia's idea that the lack of light will cause dissatisfaction among Ukrainians failed due to a lack of understanding of who we are, what we are ready for, and what our values are: \"of course, you can endure everything, if only people would stop dying... Light will not destroy the curiosity of learning about life\" (Vyacheslav, Dnipro, 56 years old). On the contrary, for many people, problems with light have also become another reason for unification, cohesion, and mutual assistance, creating \"points of unbreakability\" right at home: “We often don't have water. And we write to the group to those who do not have water: \"Come, let's fill the sauna!... we have a well\" (Inna, Kropyvnytskyi, 55 years old). Ukrainians talk about it calmly, without complaints, often with jokes and smiles, although, of course, there are also those who are dissatisfied, they experience it as an injustice, they are suspicious of disconnections, but there are very few of them. \"Living by candlelight is already the norm.\"\n\n34.

However, some activities prevail among older people: for example, books and handicrafts. Parents with children also differ slightly in their hobbies: in particular, they watch series and play games on the phone more often than others (especially those who have several children). On the other hand, those who do not have small children spend a little more time reading books, and women in particular spend more time on cosmetic procedures. In general, women, more often than men, did cosmetic procedures last year, engaged in creativity and shopping, watched TV series, and read books. Also, women traveled through Ukraine or abroad more often than men, visited friends, parties, and church more often. At the same time, there were more fishermen, sports fans, connoisseurs of gambling and alcohol among men.

Ukrainians began to devote more time to entertainment that is available anywhere and in the country without electricity: in addition to handicrafts, these are also games on the phone, reading books, cosmetic procedures, hiking in the forest. When visiting theaters and cinemas became available, it also became a more important leisure for some people than before. While games on the phone became more popular entertainment, computer games, which require more Internet and light, on the contrary, began to be played less during the war. Also, due to the objective lack in general and on television in particular, people began to watch sports matches less often. For those who are used to spending time in nature and going somewhere, the war also meant certain restrictions, for example, Vadim (Kyiv, 37 years old) regrets the inability to plan leisure time in the mountains as before: \"I like to go to the mountains with tents, but this year changed all plans\". Also, during the war, new restrictions on hunting and fishing appeared, which made these hobbies also less accessible. In general, many felt that they had less varied leisure time than used to before the war, because due to the need to work more, some simply did not have time for it.

Those who, on the contrary, believe that one should try to live a full life have their own arguments. Olena (Romny, 31 years old) is confident: \"the only thing that matters is what we can take with us. You can't postpone anything for tomorrow, I want to live now, today“. She shares that \"at first I didn't know if I could continue to live, to be happy... there was an internal ban on life... after six months I started to deal with emotional health... and now life is full“. Ukrainians are almost as prone to self-restraint as they were six months ago - more than half believe that it is necessary to significantly limit themselves: \"There is too much grief and unhappiness. We just need to be more humane\" (Voladymyr, Oleksandria, 65 years old). But self-restraint has a different meaning, in what and how exactly it is necessary to be restrained: \"It depends on what to limit. For example, loud parties, weddings, after all, this amount of fun is not right. If there is a loud wedding in one apartment, and a boy has been brought to the other... you need to be a little calmer in this respect. Pay more attention to children. So that they can forget. Especially those who survived the war\", (Anna, Drohobych, 47 years old). Basically, self-restraint concerns loud holidays, entertainment, and other fun. Those who have loved ones at the front are more inclined to limit themselves, although it was the other way around in the summer. Faith in God also affects self-restraint: the greater it is, the more limitations there are. Two-thirds of those with severe or moderate war-related disorders (insomnia, despair, anxiety, etc.) favor significant restrictions on entertainment and shopping.\n\n38.

And excitement and interest remain the most pronounced, which are neither unequivocally positive nor negative - it depends on the context. Today's life does not give Ukrainians peace and indifference: there are many events, stresses, strong impressions. The feeling of self-love has decreased, while love for others has increased, the tendency of affiliation (desire to be together with others) was activated due to fear and stress, due to the inability to cope with the challenges of war on one's own, due to cohesion and unity, because by “others” here the majority understands \"their own\", \"your circle\", which now includes very different people who are in a common trouble - and this unites them. The personal here gives way to the collective. The feeling of self-love is closely related to hedonism, because those who feel more love for themselves, most often feel satisfaction, joy, inspiration, love; and, on the contrary, they feel less anger than others. In contrast, there is no such connection between positive emotions and love for others. Disappointment\n\n39. Rating Group Comprehensive research: «HOW THE WAR CHANGED ME AND THE COUNTRY.

On the other hand, \"it stopped being scary... but I became more sentimental...\" (Yuliya, Kharkiv, 27 years old). Whereas men, on the contrary, are more restrained, closed to emotions, as they were taught according to social prescriptions: \"I am closed to emotions. I served, maybe I’ve hardened. I'm reserved. Air alarms make my wife nervous, but I smile\" (Serhiy, Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old). But is it good for their psychological health, or will the inability to feel, to react emotionally lead to bad consequences? \"My wife was 9 months pregnant when the war started. I did not know how to tell her about the war, so not to frighten and embarrass her. A little bit of fear, a little bit of stress. Worries“ (Oleksandr, Khmelnytskyi, 37 years old). At the same time, from the common things that they felt during the last year, the pain of losses, sadness, anxiety, and fear were most often mentioned. And we should not forget rage and hatred towards the aggressor: \"I am not an emotional person. A bad emotion prevails - hate... towards the enemy\" (Volodymyr, Oleksandria, 65 years old).

Such events as a war in one's life significantly increase the desire to be with others (demonstrate the behavior of closeness and rapprochement), to be with important, “your\" people. A good resource lies in communication and interaction, its value has also increased, which reduces the risks of maladaptation. Communication, a sense of unity and belonging play a special role during war; communication, in addition to its direct functions, helps to stabilize, reduce anxiety, receive and provide support, respond to one's own feelings and give such an opportunity to the other. The stories of separation from loved ones and relatives are often dramatic, the destinies of whole families are torn to pieces, Maksym (Zhytomyr, 41 years old) says: \"A distant relative went to defend the Motherland.

Thus, for many people, forced relocations during the war meant separation, in particular, among internally displaced persons, almost 40% still live apart from their family or partner. However, both the separation and the context of the war itself, in which it is easier to separate what is really important in life from the secondary, helps to see the value of communication and closeness: \"I got married during the war, the relationship was built before the war, but the war became a stimulus” (Olena , Romny, 31 years old). Oleksandra (Sumy, 22 years old) notes: \"My father was in TRO, now he is in the Armed Forces, it strengthened our family, relations have improved“. Therefore, reactions to separation are different: \"There are girlfriends who left for another country, then separated from their families. There are those who have reconsidered their relationships with boys\" (Yuliya, Kharkiv, 27 years old). But for the majority of Ukrainians, the separation has not yet led to changes in the relationship.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE General trust in people has worsened significantly during the war. 83% believe that we should be very careful with other people. It is about trust as a basic value, as trust in the world, which is undermined or destroyed by war. This especially applies to \"strangers\", or those who have become such, but seemed close. \"Relations with Crimeans, relatives on the wife's side have deteriorated. We communicate only in general phrases about the weather and health. But this is not a warm family relationship. The relationship did not develop after 2014, and after February 24 stopped at all“ (Volodymyr, Oleksandria, 65 years old). Maksym (Zhytomyr, 41 years old) explains it this way: \"The family in Ukraine - relations have become wonderful. The family in Russia - absolutely no connections. They are dead to me. There are two cousins, an uncle, an aunt. Many. They don't exist for me. I have talked to them before. And when they called me on the 26th and told me not to get out of the basement with my daughter and my mother, called me “fucking bandera”... that was the end for me“. Natalya (Zvyahyl, 38 years) provides additional arguments about distrust: “I think first of all it is necessary to divide people into those, who left to save their families, and those who left on the sly. It is probably not worth talking about such people, but they exist. It's on their conscience“. This is a new criterion of division into “yours-stranger\" for our society, which the war brought and which deepens not only mistrust, but also is and will be a serious basis for differentiation. Meanwhile, the love for close people, with whom one have experienced a lot, has increased; people began to communicate more, group together. Volodymyr (Oleksandria, 65 years old) says this about his neighbors, who have become close: “earlier we have passed without noticing each other“. Serhiy (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old) says that \"we went through a lot together...\" and became close. Olena (Chornomorsk, 59 years old) agrees with them: \"We became closer with our neighbors, because at first many left and we looked after apartments, and then started coming back and became so close. And not only the neighbors of our house, but in general. Everyone became more close. Even if you saw a person in a store several times, you already think that he is a relative, and you start asking him how to help, how he is doing, what has changed“.\n\n43.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR», February 2023 43 WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN The attitude towards women who left, but without children, seems to be indifferent, but in fact, most likely, it is quite skeptical. On the one hand, they are not condemned, because \"perhaps many of those who are afraid have left, but those who are confident have stayed\" (Volodymyr, Lviv, 46 years old). On the other hand, many have suspicions that such women left not so much because of the war as in connection with open opportunities to escape abroad, travel, build their own personal lives, etc. In particular, Volodymyr (Varash, 41 years old) notes: \"To each his own, someone will leave and find his life there. People have plans and they don't want to return - that's their decision. Whoever left because of fear and helps our country from there, it will be more useful for our country“. WOMEN WITH CHILDREN Among all the categories of people who went abroad after the start of the war, the interviewees tolerate women with children the most. Serhyi (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old) in this context appeals to the mother's instinct, because it is \"natural when a mother hides her child from death”. But, at the same time, there can be heard the opinion that \"people from safe areas should not leave\" (Ivan, Cherkasy, 22 years old), regardless of whether they have children or not. The same point of view, in particular, was expressed by Natalya (38 years old) from Zvyahyl, Zhytomyr region. MEN OF MILITARY AGE The attitude is the most negative as compared with all other categories. The majority believes that everyone should be equal before the law. In particular, Vyacheslav (Dnipro, 56 years old) shared his opinion: \"If there are no medical contraindications, then regardless of class, everyone must obey the law and stay in the country“. Yulia from Kharkiv (27 years old) shares a similar point of view: \"What makes them better than others, that some fight and others run away?\" On the other hand, there is a smaller share of respondents who note that not everyone can fight, due to their psycho-emotional characteristics (people prone to neuroses, fear attacks, panic attacks, etc.). Also, a conditional discount is given to those who have serious health problems or physical disabilities. Larysa (Odesa, 55 years old) says that \"Now we have mobilization. Summonses are issued right on the streets, in bazaars, at entrances and exits. I believe that this is a voluntary matter, not everyone can hold weapons. And they don't take everyone, I know someone who went through Afghanistan, they want to serve, but they are not taken... I think that if a person can't fight, they shouldn't be forced“. ATTITUDE TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO LEFT … the main thing is not who has left and why, but who will return when the war ends …\n\n45.

The war has united Ukrainians in opposition to a common enemy, which encroaches on the very fact of our existence as a nation, and thus has weakened existing divisions in society over topics that do not pose a threat and are in no way related to the common desire for victory over the aggressor . In the presence of an external threat, internal contradictions decrease, therefore the division into “your – stranger”, “you stand for Ukraine or against\" - this has become the defining line of division, other contradictions will wait for \"after the victory\". There is a probability that the level of tolerance and marking of \"your – stranger\" in relation to these groups will in fact remain such, and may even increase, until the trauma of the war is healed, which will take years and decades. Moreover, those who defend our right to live are from very different social groups, and these divisions are of little significance today.

The decline in support has been greatest among middle-aged and young people, most of whom currently do not support the idea. Instead, such an idea remains relatively relevant for the more conservative part of citizens – older people, less tolerant, and those who believe in God. Relatively higher support for the death penalty is also observed among those who have suffered losses as a result of the war and seek justice, but this difference is not critical, because even those who have experienced the worst and lost loved ones because of the war are not much more supportive of the idea of the death penalty than all others.\n\n47.

Among younger people, faith in God has decreased, while for older people, faith in God remains an important resource and helps them during war. Olena (Chernomorsk, 59 years old) explains it this way: \"Helping people. And when it's very disturbing, I go to the Odesa monastery. And there, grace relieves all stress”. For Serhiy (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old) \"everything is in the hands of God, it will be as it should be, what is destined is destined”. The number of those who believe not in God but in higher forces has increased. It is difficult to say what forces are meant. However, the general trend in matters of faith shows that Ukrainians have probably reoriented themselves to faith in those on whom our life and security depend - these are all those who defend the country, because faith in God is abstract, while missiles and the front line are very concrete.\n\n48.

Throughout the entire history of modern Ukraine, society was dominated by a state of demoralization, which has weakened very slowly and inconsistently. But after the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, anomia sentiments have significantly decreased and ceased to be decisive. The war clearly set priorities and made people's perceptions of national values, perceptions of society and the enemy more defined and clearer than before. The key indicators that still point to the existence of anomia attitudes are still low confidence in the future and a sense of the destruction of what our parents believed in - these indicators have changed little and remain high, which fits into the logic of events in Ukraine now. At the same time, the rest of the indicators have dropped significantly: the majority now clearly understands what is happening around them, are confident in their assessments of what is currently true and what is not. The biggest change has taken place regarding the understanding of what is right and what to believe in today - because now the majority believes in one thing: in the European future of Ukraine, in our armed forces and in victory. -29 -25 -22 -16 -15 -14 -13 -7 2 In today's chaos and uncertainty, it's hard to know what to believe in Everything is changing so fast now that you don't understand what laws to follow The problem now is that most people don' t believe in anything at all I often do not understand what is going on; I feel awkward I think others know better than me what is right and what is wrong What we lack today is true friendship for life, as it used to be Before, people felt better because everyone knew how to do the right thing Everything is so unstable right now, and it seems like anything could happen Much of what our parents believed in is crumbling before our eyes The difference between 2022 and 2021 - how many % agree with the statements November 2022.

In order to adapt to the war conditions, Ukrainians tried to change their jobs or started to get second job. Larysa (Odesa, 55 years old) talks about her experience: \"I found second job. I have to spin so that my condition doesn't get worse“. Also, Oleksandr (Khmelnytskyi, 37 years old) had to go to a second job: \"I got a second job because I need money“. In general, in order to control their income, a large part of Ukrainians simply started working more during the war. For some of them, the war and the financial situation delayed a well-deserved rest, Volodymyr (Lviv, 46 years old): \"I work, although I could be a pensioner by now, but I understand that I need to work“. However, it was not easy for everyone to find a new source of income or change their profession, such adaptation was especially difficult for older people, for people who do not make plans for life (60% of them said that they could not influence the increase of their income). Roman (Irpin, 43 years old) says that he is forced to save more, because it is difficult to find a new income: \"Until the war ends, I will follow the path of reducing expenses. You see, after working for 20 years and becoming a specialist, it is no longer appropriate to change and start from the beginning“. Serhiy (Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, 59 years old) was in the same situation: \"Well, how can we influence it… There is no opportunity to earn more, only to spend less“. «It does not fall from the sky.
