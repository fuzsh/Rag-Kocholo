        "text": "Chapter Sixteen\n\nGreat is the Study of Torah\n\nMost of His Brethren\n\nThe noun rov in biblical Hebrew carries the meanings “multitude, abundance, greatness,”7 but not that of “majority” or “the greater part.” It is precisely in these latter senses that the word is used in the overwhelming majority of occurrences in rabbinic literature.8 As frequently happens, the midrash read the biblical expression in the light of its contemporary usage,9 leading to an ironic observation about the price of Mordecai’s success. As long as Mordecai had existed as an individual pursuing the life of a pious Jewish scholar, he could enjoy the support and admiration of all his colleagues.10 Now that he has turned his energies to other directions,11 and come to occupy positions of leadership in the royal court12 and in the Jewish community, he has inevitably alienated some of the rabbis.\n\nGreater Than the Saving of Lives\n\nRav Joseph’s dictum appears to be based on the conclusions of the baraita which he brought above,24 which claimed that Mordecai had compromised his vocation as a Torah scholar when he involved himself in the “political” activities that were necessary for foiling Haman’s plans.25 Rav Joseph finds corroboration for his observation in the comparison of two verses outside the book of Esther in which Mordecai26 was mentioned. The former verse is part of a list of the Jewish exiles who went up to Jerusalem following Cyrus’ proclamation, under the leadership of Zerubbabel. An almost identical list appears in connection with the completion of the construction of the walls of Jerusalem in the time of Nehemiah.27 Both lists include the name Mordecai.28 The only major difference between the two lists, aside from some variations in orthography, is that in the second one an additional name is added just before Mordecai’s. Rav Joseph regards this fact as an intentional indication that the authors of the book of Ezra [-Nehemiah]29 wanted to show us that in the period intervening between the two events—the period during which the events of Esther, including Mordecai’s rise to worldly greatness, took place—Mordecai’s status had been reduced correspondingly.30 The reason for this, says Rav Joseph, must have been connected with his neglect of his scholarly activities in order to battle against the perils threatening his people.31\n\nGreater Than the Construction of the Temple\n\nThe tradition about Ezra’s alleged studies with Jeremiah’s protégé Baruch the son of Neriah43 is an attempt to grapple with a puzzle of Jewish historiography: Why did the righteous Ezra not seize the earliest possible opportunity and go up with the first group of returning exiles under the leadership of Zerubbabel?44 Instead “he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king [Artaxerxes].”45\n\nIt is probable that, in addition to these exegetical considerations, the dictum was also employed for homiletical purposes. It would have served as effective propaganda for the Babylonian talmudic academies in discourses designed to discourage students from immigrating to the Holy Land.46\n\nGreater than Honoring One’s Father and Mother\n\nThis comment, like the previous one, is intended to exalt and extol the importance of religious study. It is not unlikely that Rav had in mind specific cases where a potential student had to choose between conflicting claims of pursuing his education and supporting or obeying his parents.57\n\nThe computation that fourteen years of Jacob’s life58 remained unaccounted for in the biblical story of his life is of course not stated explicitly in the Bible, and was deduced on the basis of the calculations set out below whose source, as we shall note, is in Seder ‘olam, Chapter 2. Talmudic tradition deduced from this “fact” (as will be spelled out at the conclusion of the pericope) that Jacob had spent those years studying Torah at the yeshivah of Shem and Eber59 prior to departing for Haran. By tarrying Jacob was disobeying Isaac’s charge60 to proceed to Padan-aram to find a wife. As the talmudic passage will conclude, Jacob was punished for remaining too long with Laban, but not for the period of his studies. From this we will learn that the obligation to study the Torah takes precedence over filial duties.61\n\nThe Years of Ishmael\n\nIn general, the Torah provides only such historical and genealogical information as is necessary for tracing the development of the people of Israel. In light of this premise, it was inconceivable to the rabbinical mind that God should waste precious words on biographical data that does not further this purpose and relates only to the subsidiary branches of the Patriarchal line.66\n\nR. Johanan’s observation is not crucial for demonstrating Jacob’s lost years, nor does it relate to Rav’s dictum about the priority of study over parental honor.67 Both these assertions are founded upon chronological calculations which had been formulated prior to R. Johanan.68 The redactor of our pericope seems to have had at hand a source in which the chronology of Jacob’s years was attached to R. Johanan’s dictum; i.e., as an exegetical comment to Genesis 25:17.69\n\nBy comparing Abraham’s ages when Ishmael and Isaac were born we easily establish that the difference between the ages of his sons was fourteen years.73\n\nThe Bible does not divulge how old Isaac, Jacob and Esau were at the time that Jacob received his father’s blessing, nor does it furnish us with explicit information that could enable us to deduce these ages. At this juncture the Talmud, citing Seder ‘olam, Chapter 2,77 resorts to more creative midrashic methods in order to determine the missing date. The exegesis bases itself on a number of hermeneutical assumptions:\n\n• The wording of Genesis 28:6-9, when read literally (“When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob etc.”), is taken to mean that Esau’s marriage to Mahalath took place immediately following the blessing.78\n\n• Ishmael died at precisely the time that Esau was arranging to marry his daughter. The proof of this latter premise requires more imaginative midrashic exposition as we read presently:\n\nThat Nebaioth was Ishmael’s son has already been related in Genesis 25:13. Therefore the rabbinic aversion to scriptural redundancy demands some justification for the repetition of that fact in 28:9.83 The baraita resolves this difficulty by assigning Nebaioth a role in the marriage arrangements: True, it was Ishmael whom Esau had approached at first seeking the hand of his daughter,84 but in the end it fell to Nebaioth to conclude the marriage. The most likely reason for such a development is that Ishmael had expired in the interval.85\n\nThanks to Genesis 16:16 and 25:17, which inform us respectively when Ishmael was born and how long he lived, we are now able to attach a date to the episode of Jacob’s receiving Isaac’s blessing, a date which would otherwise have remained unknown.86 This, then, was the point of R. Johanan’s remark that the biographical statistics about Ishmael, while of no intrinsic interest for the purposes of the scriptural narration, provide valuable information concerning the life of Jacob.\n\nThe Fourteen Lost Years\n\nAccording to Genesis 29:18-20 Jacob served Laban for seven years prior to his marriages to Leah (22-5), and then Rachel (28). He then had to serve an additional seven years for Rachel’s sake (30). Genesis 30:25 relates that “…it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country…” The Talmud therefore concludes that if Jacob had gone to Aram-naharaim immediately after leaving his parents’ house, then he should have been seventy-seven (63 + 14) years old at the time of Joseph’s birth and their return to Canaan.\n\nWe calculated above that Jacob ought to have been seventy-seven years of age when Joseph was born. According to Genesis 41:46 Joseph was thirty years old when he was summoned to interpret Pharaoh’s dreams foretelling the succession of the years of plenty and of famine. Therefore, if no interval followed Jacob’s departure from his father’s house, he should have been (77 + 30 =) 107 years old at that time.\n\nGenesis 41:32 tells us that the cycle of plenty and famine was to commence immediately after its revelation to Pharaoh. The seven years of plenty passed (Genesis 42:47-53), following which the period of famine began. At the time that Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers he remarked (Genesis 45:6) that “For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet these are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.” In keeping with our computations thus far, Jacob should now have been (107 + 7+2 =) 116 years old.97\n\nIt may be assumed that Jacob was conveyed to Egypt immediately following Joseph’s revelation.100\n\nThe only way to resolve this apparent contradiction between our calculation of Jacob’s age and Jacob’s words to Pharaoh is to assume that our previous calculations were incomplete, and that we must supply information that is not stated explicitly in Scripture. The Talmud therefore inserts a period of fourteen years in the only available slot, between Jacob’s departure from his parent’s home and his arrival at Laban’s household. The biblical story does not really supply us with meaningful clues about where Jacob was and what he was doing during this period, but the Talmud relates that he was occupied throughout in the study of Torah. During the patriarchal era, according to the premises of the aggadah, the proper venue for such studies would have been in the “Yeshivah of Shem,” which was conducted after its founder’s death by his successor, Eber.109\n\nAfter the Talmud has reached its chronological conclusions on the basis of the biblical and midrashic evidence which has been adduced so far, it quotes a baraita which presents an identical chronological framework. Unlike the talmudic pericope in which the statement about Jacob’s “service” in the academy of Eber was proposed as a solution to the discrepancy between its calculations of the patriarch’s age and Jacob’s own statement on the matter, the baraita only teaches that such a fourteen-year period preceded Jacob’s arrival in Aram-naharaim, but does not take the trouble to demonstrate on what basis the claim was derived. What the Talmud has done here, of course, is to show us the unstated exegetical considerations and computations which underlie the baraita’s chronology and to prove that they follow logically from its hermeneutical premises.\n\nMS Y\n\n(with variants from MS O, EY, HgT1, Printings)\n\nMS G\n\n(with variants from remaining witnesses\n\nwas114 serving Eber115 for fourteen years. 116for fourteen years117 was concealed118 and serving119 Eber.\n\nIt is likely that the baraita chose to mention this fact here not merely for its intrinsic historical interest, but principally on account of its relevance to the development of the midrashic expansions to Jacob’s biography.127 It furnishes an indirect explanation of why Eber was singled out by the rabbis as the ideal candidate to head a yeshivah during the patriarchal period,128 as well as showing that Eber was alive during (but not long after) the fourteen years that have been assigned to Jacob’s studies.129\n\nThe baraita that was brought by the Talmud is without question from Seder ‘olam, Chapter 2, where the passage appears in almost identical formulation.135\n\nJacob Was Not Punished\n\nThere were two stages in the process of the Talmud’s validation of its claim that Torah study overrides the obligations of parental honor. First it had to be proved that Jacob remained apart from his parents in order to pursue his studies. This has been satisfactorily established. It now remains to be demonstrated that the patriarch was not punished for his absence. This the Talmud sets out to do now.\n\nThe baraita that is being cited here by the Talmud also originates in Seder ‘olam, Chapter 2.145 In Seder ‘olam it comes at the conclusion of a detailed enumeration of the events of Joseph’s life:146\n\nSeder ‘olam does not spell out that Joseph’s separation from Jacob was a punishment for Jacob’s analogous treatment of his own father, but it is difficult to imagine what other reason the author could have had for pointing out the parallel.148\n\nJacob in Succoth and Beth-el\n\nWe at last approach the real proof that Jacob was not punished for the time that he spent studying with Eber. From Seder ‘olam’s juxtaposition of the respective absences of Jacob and Joseph the Talmud deduces that the latter was Jacob’s punishment for the former—i.e., that in accordance with the midrashic theological principle of “measure for measure” Jacob was being made to suffer the same pain that he had inflicted upon his own father. However the numbers do not quite fit. By Seder ‘olam’s own reckoning, Jacob’s absence extended over thirty-six years, since we should include among them the fourteen years spent with Eber! Does this not prove that when God chose to penalize Jacob for being remiss in honoring Isaac, he did not hold him accountable for the years spent at the yeshivah studying the Torah? Similarly, we may draw the homiletical conclusion that students in subsequent generations should not feel constrained in such cases by the conflicting demands of familial and religious obligations, since the Bible has shown us that Torah study takes precedence.\n\nThis baraita, which is also being cited from Seder ‘olam,164 does not explain how it arrived at the time-span of eighteen months which is not mentioned explicitly in the verse. The most likely explanation is that of Rashi who states that the plural form succoth (“booths”) indicates two summer periods in which it is common to dwell in the fields in such temporary shelters,165 whereas the (singular) “house” denotes the permanent quarters that would have to be constructed for the (one) winter. Two summers and the intervening winter add up to eighteen months.166\n\nMS Y All other witnesses as it says: “And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, etc.” (Genesis 35:3)\n\nThe duration of Jacob’s sojourn in Beth-el is not specified in the Bible, and it is most probable that the author of the baraita was merely filling in the interval required to reach the desired total of twenty-two.171\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe material discussed in the current chapter consists primarily of a series of sources on a related topic,172 the religious primacy of Torah study.173 The sources were assembled here because the first of them connects to verses in Esther. After making allowance for the confusion that attaches to several of the attributions, we may summarize the passage as follows:174\n\n1) Rav Joseph’s baraita, based on Esther 10:3.\n\n2) Rav Joseph’s dictum: Study is greater than the saving of lives, derived from Ezra 2:2 and Nehemiah 7:7.\n\n3) Rav, or Rav Isaac bar Samuel bar Marta:175 Study is greater than the building of the Temple.\n\n4) Rabbah bar bar Hana176 in the name of R. Isaac bar Samuel bar Marta: Study is greater than the honoring of parents, as derived from the life of Jacob.\n\nIt was with reference to the last source that the Talmud compiled a detailed pericope devoted to a meticulous analysis of the traditional {Seder ‘olam) chronology of the events in the life of the patriarch Jacob. In its current form it is unimaginable that such a pericope, with its reliance on complex mathematical calculations and the bringing together of events from the whole book of Genesis, could have been preached to a lay congregation as part of a normal sabbath sermon. It is however conceivable that the main ideas might have been originally conveyed in a more simplified form,177 accepting as a received tradition the fact of Jacob’s fourteen years at Eber’s academy.178\n\nNotes\n\nA commandment protects and saves life at the time that a person is occupied in its performance; but when one is not occupied in its performance it protects but does not save life. However the Torah both protects and saves life whether or not the person is occupied in it.\n\n“In the seven and twentieth year” (Ezekiel 29:17) of Nebuchadnezzar [God] gave Egypt into his hand. “He took her multitude, and took her spoil, and took her prey” (ibid., 29:19). And he exiled Jeremiah and Baruch to Babylonia in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity.\n\n…Daniel and his following and his company went up at the same time… Ezra and his following and his company did not go up at that time.\n\nAnd why did Ezra not go up at that time?\n\n—Because he had to refine his learning before Baruch the son of Neriah.\n\nAnd let Baruch the son of Neriah go up!\n\n—Rather, they say: Baruch the son of Neriah was an old man advanced in years, and was incapable even of being carried in a litter. Says Resh Laqish: It was in accordance with the will of the Holy One that Ezra did not go up at that time. For if Ezra had gone up at that time, then Satan might have spoken a denunciation saying: It would be preferable if Ezra served in the High Priesthood instead of Joshua son of Jehozadak…\n\nA person who has a father and mother, and is obligated to serve them, to provide them with food and drink, to bring them in and out, to clothe and cover them, as we have learned [TB Qiddushin 31b]… but he wishes to go to his master in order to study, or to a place of Torah so that he will not have to study in isolation, as we have learned [Mishnah Avot 4:4]…— Which of them takes precedence?…Do we say that the study of Torah takes precedence as it does over all actions? Or perhaps honoring one’s father and mother takes precedence because their honor has been equated with honoring God…?\n\n“Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son…” An anecdote: R. Ḥama bar ‘Uqba and the rabbis were sitting and raising an objection: Why did Scripture see fit here to detail the genealogy of a wicked man? R. Levi passed by. They said: Behold, here comes an erudite scholar, let us ask him. R. Levi came [citing] in the name of R. Ḥama bar Ḥanina: —In order to teach you at what age your ancestor was blessed.\n\n…In his thirtieth year he went out from prison— “Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh”.\n\n…Seven years of plenty and two years of famine.\n\nIt turns out that Joseph was thirty-nine years old and Levi forty-four when Israel went down to Egypt…\n\n“And he lay down in that place to sleep” (Genesis 28:11)— R. Judah says: Here he lay down. During the fourteen years when he was buried in the earth (see above) and serving Shem and Eber he did not lie down."
