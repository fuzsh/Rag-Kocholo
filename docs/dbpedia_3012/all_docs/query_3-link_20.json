        "text": "Brownsville witnessed the development of one of the largest communities of Eastern European Jewish immigrants during the last decade of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th. Of the nearly two million Jews who migrated to the United States during that period from Eastern Europe, the overwhelming majority settled in New York City. Most of the newcomers established themselves in the Lower East Side, and when it became overcrowded, many took up residence elsewhere.\n\nIn the year 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge opened. Following this, the Williamsburg Bridge and Manhattan Bridge opened as well. In addition, the subway system - the IRT and BMT lines - was extended to reach into Brownsville. This enabled thousands of people from the east side of Manhattan to seek new homes in Brooklyn. The Jews spread over the face of the borough and converted mud roads into fine paved roads, and shacks into modern apartments.\n\nThe new influx from Manhattan started a migratory movement southward on the part of the Jews, first streaming into Williamsburg, and flowing into the neighboring neighborhoods. In the span of a few years, Brownsville became a thriving Jewish community.\n\nBrownsville was predominantly Jewish from the late 1880s until the 1950s. In 1887, businessman Elias Kaplan showed the first Jewish residents around Brownsville, painting the area as favorable compared to the Lower East Side. Kaplan built a factory and accommodations for his workers, then placed a synagogue, named Ohev Sholom, in his own factory.\n\nOther manufacturers that created low-tech products like food, furniture, and metals followed suit throughout the next decade, settling their factories in Brownsville. This led to much more housing being built there. The area quickly became densely populated, with factories, workshops, and stores located next to housing. Within three years of the first lot being distributed, there were 10,000 Jews living in Brownsville. By 1904, the lots comprising the former Vanderveer farm was entirely owned by Jews, who were spread out across 4 square miles (10 km) .\n\nAn estimated 25,000 people lived in Brownsville by 1900, most of whom lived in two-story wooden frame accommodations built for two families each.\n\nBy 1904, the area deteriorated. Many of these buildings were grossly overcrowded, with up to eight families living in some of these two-family houses. 22 of the 25 housing projects in Brownsville were tenement housing; three years later, only one of these 25 housing units was not a tenement. It became as dense as the very packed Lower East Side, according to one account.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the vast majority of Brownsville residents were born outside the United States; in 1910, 66% of the population were first-generation immigrants, and 80% of these immigrants were from Russia. By 1920, over 80,000 of the area's 100,000 inhabitants were from Eastern Europe, and Brownsville had been nicknamed \"Little Jerusalem\" or \"Yerushalayim d'Amerika.\" In 1925, it was recorded that Brownsville represented the largest center of Jewish population in all of New York City.\n\nYiddish was their common language, the mame loshen or mother tongue. It dominated the streets of the neighborhood at the turn of the century and for many years to come. Many Jews lived in Brownsville for decades without learning to speak English. With Yiddish spoken in the homes, Yiddish daily and weekly newspapers, signs and menus in Yiddish, Jewish shopkeepers, Jewish delicatessens, restaurants and bakeries selling Jewish dishes, there was little need to know English.\n\nBrownsville continued to have the highest density of Jews of any place in the United States through the 1950s, and was an intensely Jewish world. The neighborhood boasted some 200 Orthodox shuls, and in spite of the fact that so many were no longer observant, in the 1930s and 1940s there was still a shul on almost every Brownsville street. Some of these shul buildings still exist in Brownsville, (albeit sadly as churches).\n\nReligion was a cogent force in Brownsville - almost every Brownsville home had a mezuzah - even though a large group of anti-religionists resided in the community. Those who attended a shul went to an Orthodox shul. Shuls were a part of practically every Jewish institution: The Homes for the Aged, the day nurseries, the various Talmud Torahs, and the yeshivas. Besides the regularly constituted congregations, there were many minyanim conducted in the homes of rabbis, Hebrew teachers, or even in rented rooms.\n\nMany of these shuls had boys clubs, where they would take boys off the streets and teach them Yiddishkeit. At times these shuls pulsated, especially when it came a time like Simchas Torah, where one writer reminisced the dramatic night of Simchas Torah night at the Young Israel of Brownsville.\n\nThe Young Israel of Brownsville that met for more than thirty years in the Hebrew Educational Society would fill the building to the point of overflowing for its Simchas Torah affairs, Sukkos parties, and other events. People would walk for blocks to attend some of the functions arranged in the beautiful Hebrew Educational Society's sukkah.\n\nThe Hapoel HaMizrachi on Hopkinson Avenue was known for its Shemini Atzeres gatherings, at which time it would invite the rabbis of the community as its guests.\n\nA talmud Torah was established soon after the settlement of the Jews in Brownsville. The Hebrew Free School of Brownsville, popularly known later as the \"Stone Avenue Talmud Torah,\" originated in 1892. Among its founders and early supporters were H. Simon, Dr. I. Kaufman, H. Meyersohn, D. Rosenberg, Elias Kaplan, I. Cohen, Solomon Reuben, Simon Rose, Rabbi M. C. Rabinowitz, A. Volitsky, A. Belanofsky, S. Grally, Aaron Kaplan, Nathan Kovinsky, and I. Levingson. Until 1902, it met in a house on Thatford and Belmont Avenues. In that year it moved to a frame building at 386 Stone Avenue.\n\nIn this neighborhood, Yeshivas Rabbeinu Chaim Berlin, one of the earliest chadarim in the country, was founded.\n\nA majority of the shuls were organized by landsmanschaften, men originating from the same European town who assembled to fraternize with one another and to engage in common worship.\n\nMany such organizations (chevros) were founded there and became not only the primary social agencies of the neighborhood, but also havens to thousands of the first generation of immigrants who affiliated with them. They provided a place of worship and study, and also met the immigrants' needs for comradeship, friendship, and fellowship. They were of great assistance in times of distress, offering sick benefits, free loans, cemetery rights, insurance, and a variety of other advantages.\n\nAbove all, these associations gave the newcomers in a strange land a sense of security, a feeling that behind them was a group ready to be helpful and to respond to a call in time of need.\n\nBrownsville was also a place for radical political causes during this time. (more on it in the future)\n\nThere was a sense of cohesion in the community that had a good deal to do with . Brownsville was a kehillah, a . Each street seemed like a mini­community, a neighborhood in itself, . Each street had its grocer, its candy store, its pharmacist who took care of little bruises and scrapes and got things out of children's eyes. In spite of being so densely populated, Brownsville typified what sociologists call a gemeinschaft, a closely knit and intimate community.\n\nOn the Yiddishe yomim tovim, the public schools were practically unattended. Whether religiously observant or not, no children attended school on these days. The restaurants and bakeries served Jewish dishes.\n\nOne could tell the approach of the Shabbos by the aroma of Shabbos dishes being prepared by the Jewish housewives. As Friday night approached, the pushcarts left the streets and some of the stores began to close.\n\nThe hustle and bustle preceding Pesach and the Yomim Noraim announced their arrival long in advance. What youngster would go without a new suit on Pesach, or attend shul without a new hat on Rosh Hashanah? On Kol Nidre night, Pitkin Avenues's stores were all dark. The Avenue was the leading promenade, the Fifth Avenue for the entire community. It was a sight to behold!\n\nAs the community grew and the need for them arose, the Brooklyn Hebrew Orphan Asylum and other Socail work were organized. A society to clothe the naked, the Malbish Arumim, was established in 1894. A year later, the Chesed Shel Emes Society was founded. It was a free burial society for poor people who had, despite the interventions of yet another organization, the Society for the Aid of the Indigent Sick, succumbed. Finally, an umbrella society, a \"Jewish United Fund,\" the Brownsville Relief Hebrew Charity, was organized to supply coal, pay rent, and render other assistance. The Hebrew Free Loan Association was organized in 1901 to assist people in temporary financial straits, to aid those in need of cash to tide them over a dull business season, to acquire material or tools, and to help the small businessman establish himself.\n\nCharitable organizations were particularly important to the women, who brought the old-world custom of gehen kleiben, house­to­house collections, to the neighborhood. It remained a common practice. All of the women recall the pushkes, charity collection boxes, which were to be seen in Jewish homes from these early days onward. The \"sisterhoods\" or women's auxiliaries of these organizations did the tedious legwork; the women were the ones on whom the burden of collection work fell.\n\nIn the 1940s and particularly the 1950s, there was a decline in the neighborhood, as the demographics of the population pivoted toward an African-American and Latino majority. In 1972, the last shul, on Stone Avenue, between Pitkin and Belmont, was burned by rioters and closed. Today, practically all synagogues alluded to have been razed to make room for housing projects, or have been converted for other uses. There is practically no remnant left of the proud and vibrant Jewish population that had once lived in this neighborhood.\n\nYet, in the last few years, Brownsville has begun to see a rebirth of its Jewish character as a young Jewish community springs up on the streets that thronged with Jews 100 years earlier.\n\nA minyan was established with weekly prayers taking place on Friday night and Shabbos day, where the voices of Jewish prayer can be heard once again. After prayers, the men sit around the table saying l'chaim and wishing others life and prosperary, as they did a century earlier.\n\nA weekly Torah class has been set up, where the Jewish men of Brownsville come together on a weekly bases sitting in front the books and studying the holy Torah.\n\nFor the first time since the '60s, the N'shei (Jewish women) of Brownsville, NY were invited to partake in events made especially for them.\n\nSimilar to days gone by, a crowd of over a hundred excited men, women, and children dance in the street as the crowd overflows the small shul on the night of Simchas Torah.\n\nIn 2019, on the fourth night of Chanukah, a crowd of 75 men, women and children watched as Rabbi Mendel Schtroks lit the menorah, and all broke into a rousing \"Haneiros Halalu.\" The event climaxed with lively dancing, as the crowd reveled in the joy of Yiddishkeit and the spirit of Chanukah.\n\nWho could have imagined they'd see the joyous dancing with the Torah or the lighting of the Menorah on the streets of Brownsville? After decades of darkness, Jewish life has returned to Brownsville!\n\nStone Avenue Talmud Torah\n\nThe Hebrew Free School of Brownsville, popularly known later as the \"Stone Avenue Talmud Torah,\" originated in 1892. Until 1902, it met in a house on Thatford and Belmont Avenues. In that year it moved to a frame building at 386 Stone Avenue.\n\nTipheres Ha'gro\n\nUntil 1961, when it had to discontinue its activities because of changes in the neighborhood, the Tipheres Ha'gro at 405 Howard Avenue offered an intensive\n\nHebrew education to a large number of students. It was established in 1907 and was located at 1887 Prospect Place. In the 1930s, it had an enrollment of as many as 800 pupils, an annual budget of $45,000, and a staff of well-known teachers.\n\nThe lower classes received daily instruction for an hour and a half; the higher classes were taught three hours a day, and their instruction included the study of Gemara.\n\nThe school also had a beis midrash for adults with a daily minyan, and study groups in Gemara and other subjects, which were attended by a large adult group, and a junior congregation.\n\nTorah M'Tzion\n\nBrownsville proper had another daily school, the Yeshivah Torah M'Tzion, which had a fine building at 628 Stone Avenue, founded in 1912. Four hundred and eighty students were in attendance in 1927. It later relocated to Canarsie, and is known now as the Seaview Jewish Center Yeshivah Torah M'Tzion.\n\nAteres Tipheres Yisrael Talmud Torah\n\nAteres Tipheres Yisrael Talmud Torah at 479 Ashford Street, popularly known as the Ashford Street Talmud Torah, was organized in 1913.\n\nHebrew School of the Hebrew Educational Society\n\nAnother was the Hebrew School of the Hebrew Educational Society. It has given instruction to hundreds of boys and girls through the past sixty-five years.\n\nYeshiva and Mesivta Torahs Chaim of Greater New York.\n\nUnder the guidance of Rabbi Isaac Shmidman, dean of Yeshiva and Mesivta Torahs Chaim of Greater New York, this school, located at 631 Belmont Avenue in East New York, had graduated hundreds of students well-versed both in rabbinic and secular learning. It was founded in 1926, but four years elapsed before the institution was fully organized. It has been able to provide each year Jewish and English education for 400 students under a well-trained staff. An elementary and high school department are maintained, as well as a number of extracurricular activities. Due to neighborhood changes, the school merged in 1965 with the Yeshiva of South Shore in Woodmere, Long Island.\n\nBeis Yaakov\n\nBeis Yaakov opened up in Brownsville, right across the street from Yeshivas Chaim Berlin, and it was one of the first Beis Yaakov's opened in America.\n\nBeis Rivkah\n\nThis was also the place where the first branches of Beis Rivkah was founded.\n\nFounded under the umbrella of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, the educational arm of Chabad-Lubavitch, Beth Rivkah welcomed its first class in a small house on Riverdale Road in East New York, Brooklyn. Over the next few years, branches popped up all over the U.S.\n\nAs the school grew, it changed locations, and from Riverdale Avenue it moved to occupy the second floor of a synagogue on Stone Avenue in Brownsville. When demographic changes in the neighborhood made it too unsafe for the girls' school to remain there, a suitable building was found on Church Avenue and Bedford - the former Yeshiva University High School of Brooklyn building - where the school moved in 1967.\n\nYeshivas Chaim Berlin (elementary)\n\nThe school was established in 1904, first in a store front on Sutter Avenue, and then on Chester Street. Next, it moved to its own building at 1899 Prospect Place. It was established by Jews who moved to Brownsville from the Lower East Side of New York City, thus making it the oldest yeshiva in Kings County. It began with the name Yeshiva Tiferes Bachurim, then at the suggestion of Meir Berlin (Bar-Ilan), it was renamed for his brother, Chaim Berlin, a rabbi who served in Valozhin, the place where some of the yeshiva's founders were from.\n\nJewish studies were taught in from 9 o'clock in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and secular subjects from 3 to 7 o'clock in the evening. The Jewish curriculum, amassing 10,000 hours of instruction during its 7-year period, was patently much more ambitious than the curriculum of the weekday schools, encompassing about 2,600 hours of instruction.\n\nMesivta R'Chaim Berlin\n\nIn 1935, some of the parents and board members of Yeshivas Chaim Berlin got together to open a high school for their graduating students. After much back and forth, it was decided that Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner, who recently came to America, would be the rosh yeshiva.\n\nThe Mesivta R' Chaim Berlin started on a small scale in the building of the Stone Avenue Talmud Torah. In 1940, the Mesivta purchased the building on 350 Stone Avenue, formerly occupied by the Municipal Bank, and refurbished it with dormitories and other facilities.\n\nHundreds of students from the community and other parts of the country and the world came to study there. Many have graduated as rabbis, occupying positions in various Jewish communities. Others have entered the professions.\n\nThe school remained in Brownsville until the fall of 1963, when it moved to its new quarters at 899 Winthrop Street in East Flatbush. In 1964, it relocated its quarters to Far Rockaway. A few years later, it moved to Flatbush.\n\nUnited Jewish Day Schools\n\nA daily Judaic afterschool program established in 1960 by Rabbi Mendel Drizin A\"H, for local Jewish public school children, the program was held in local Shuls till the mid 60's when the demographics of the neighborhood changed.\n\nOholei Torah\n\nOholei Torah was first established in Brownsville on Strauss St. with only two students learning in the basement of \"The Douglass Ave. Shtible\" as it was called then. Slowly the yeshiva grew and moved around to different locations.\n\nToday, the school has grown to be the flagship educational system of Chabad, with of the Chabad shluchim graduating from them."
