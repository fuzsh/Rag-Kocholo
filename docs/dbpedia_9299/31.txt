Baby Face Nelson (born 1908, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died November 27, 1934, near Fox River Grove, Illinois) was an American gunman and bank robber noted for his vicious killings and youthful looks.

From petty crime Nelson graduated into labour racketeering, working for Al Capone (1929–31) and other bootleg bosses; he was let go, however, proving too violent even for them. He then turned to bank robberies, joining with John Dillinger on two occasions (1934). Listed as Public Enemy Number One by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), he was killed in a wild shoot-out with FBI agents.
