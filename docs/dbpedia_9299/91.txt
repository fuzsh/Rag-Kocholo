While initially planning to save money and develop his craft in San Angelo, Babyface set his sights on Atlanta, widely regarded as a hub for aspiring hip-hop artists due to its numerous record labels and production studios. He believes the city offers unparalleled opportunities compared to the limitations of living and working in West Texas. Babyface explained by saying

“Taking a chance on yourself and going for something big takes patience, persistence, and faith. It often seems impossible or fantastical to other aspiring artists who live in San Angelo because opportunities like that don’t just pop out of nowhere and present themselves. The difference is, you have to be willing to take a leap of faith and put yourself in a position to increase your chances to level up.”

Explaining the importance of proximity to Atlanta's music industry, Babyface stresses the need to be in close contact with influential individuals and surroundings to enhance chances of success. He focuses on cultivating relationships while balancing a new restaurant job with music production and writing. Babyface feels that the right opportunity will present itself soon enough. He emphasized that by building and maintaining new relationships and networking in the right social circles he is giving himself the best possible chance to succeed.

Babyface's immediate plan involves compiling his best works into a demo tape or album to present to record label decision-makers, producers, and industry insiders. He hopes this effort will showcase his lyrical prowess and musical talent and open doors to potential partnerships.

Acknowledging the courage required to pursue a dream by leaving one's hometown with nothing more than a suitcase and a few personal belongings, Babyface stands resolute in his pursuit, undeterred by the possibility of failure. Most people lack the courage to chase a dream because the fear of failing is too strong and the lack of faith in oneself is too weak. Therefore, when someone we know is brave enough to face a high possibility of failure and confident enough to believe in themselves and their abilities, it should be highlighted and celebrated.

We are fortunate to witness such a courageous undertaking because we find inspiration in people who put it all on the line. What we come to realize is not only are they capable of achieving something great, but they refuse to allow fear to influence their actions and ultimately dictate their destinies.

Babyface is humble but brave and he is determined yet deserving. He exudes confidence in his abilities and aims to inspire others by showcasing determination and fortitude.
