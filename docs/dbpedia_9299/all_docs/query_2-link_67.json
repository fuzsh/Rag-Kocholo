        "text": "What is baby acne?\n\nBaby acne is a common and short-term skin condition that causes acne breakouts to form on your baby’s face or chest. Similar to adult acne, symptoms of baby acne include pimples, little bumps or pustules on your baby’s skin. It usually only lasts a few days to a couple of weeks.\n\nOther names for baby acne are newborn acne, neonatal acne or neonatal cephalic pustulosis.\n\nIs baby acne the same as infantile acne?\n\nWhile both conditions have the same symptoms, the difference between baby acne and infantile acne is when it affects your child. Baby acne occurs on average around 2 weeks of age. Some babies are born with acne and it goes away within weeks. Infantile acne occurs between 2 months to 1 year. Symptoms of infantile acne can reach beyond pustules and bumps to include blackheads. If your child gets acne after 2 months of age, visit a healthcare provider. It may take longer for infantile acne to clear up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWho does baby acne affect and how common is it?\n\nBaby acne can affect any newborn before they turn 2 months old. It’s common and affects nearly 20% or more than 1 in 5 healthy newborns in the United States.\n\nWhat does baby acne look like?\n\nBaby acne can be present at birth or show up on your baby’s skin before they turn 2 months old. It can look similar to mild adolescent or adult acne. Features of baby acne include:\n\nSmall, red to purple bumps that are swollen (papules).\n\nBumps that contain pus, surrounded by a red to purple or dark brown ring (pustules).\n\nYour baby’s acne may look more visible when they cry. They also won’t have blackheads if they have baby acne.\n\nWhere do symptoms of baby acne appear?\n\nBaby acne is common on your child’s face, chest and back. Specifically, it can affect your baby’s:\n\nCheeks.\n\nNose.\n\nForehead.\n\nChin.\n\nScalp.\n\nNeck.\n\nWhat are the stages of baby acne?\n\nBaby acne can appear suddenly or develop slowly. Pimples can start as small, discolored dots on their skin before they turn into raised pimples. When the inflammation of the pimples reduces, so does their size. The pimples are temporary and usually go away within a few days to a couple of weeks. After the pimples go away, your baby’s skin will be blemish-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes baby acne?\n\nThe exact cause of baby acne is unknown. Acne is usually the result of clogged pores. When your pores clog, a pimple can develop.\n\nProviders suspect that baby acne is the result of hormonal changes that affect your newborn during birth or the first few weeks of their life. Hormones in the placenta can affect how your baby’s skin produces sebum. Sebum is an oily substance that the sebaceous glands in your baby’s skin make to protect their skin and hair. Too much sebum can clog pores and lead to acne.\n\nIn addition, babies have sensitive skin when they’re born. Their skin may react negatively to anything that’s left on it for too long, especially if they have food, vomit or drool residue on their skin.\n\nDoes breastfeeding cause baby acne?\n\nIt’s possible that hormones from a birthing parent’s breast milk (chest milk) can affect your baby’s hormones, which can lead to acne. Baby acne is a temporary skin condition that clears up, most often without any medical treatment. This shouldn’t affect the way that you feed your newborn. Baby acne will go away as your newborn grows and their body adjusts to their new environment. If you have questions about how your breast milk (chest milk) affects your newborn’s skin, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nDo kisses cause baby acne?\n\nAffectionate kisses on your baby’s cheeks when they’re born don’t cause baby acne. Baby acne is usually the result of hormonal changes that cause their pores to temporarily clog.\n\nHow is baby acne treated?\n\nBaby acne is a temporary condition that goes away without treatment. Every baby’s skin is different, so if their healthcare provider recommends treatment, it could include:\n\nAn antifungal cream like ketoconazole.\n\nA low-potency topical steroid like hydrocortisone.\n\nYou can apply these to your baby’s skin as you would a lotion or moisturizer. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions on how often you should apply these medications to your baby’s skin.\n\nAre there any home remedies for baby acne?\n\nTalk to your baby’s healthcare provider before using any products on your baby’s acne. Sometimes, at-home remedies can irritate your newborn’s delicate skin.\n\nIf your baby has acne, you can help it go away by taking care of your newborn’s skin. This may include:\n\nGently wash your baby’s skin with warm water. Avoid scrubbing their skin. Then, pat your baby’s skin dry.\n\nDon’t use lotions or oils on your baby’s skin or products that may clog their pores.\n\nClean up any food residue or vomit from your baby’s skin immediately after they make a mess.\n\nIf your baby’s acne isn’t going away or if it gets worse after a couple of weeks, contact their healthcare provider.\n\nHow long does baby acne last?\n\nBaby acne could clear up on its own within a few days to a couple of weeks. The timeline could be faster if a healthcare provider recommends a topical medication. Sometimes, it could take up to a month before baby acne clears up. If your baby’s acne isn’t clearing up, talk to their healthcare provider."
