        "text": "Jennifer Hudson\n\nA two-time GRAMMY® Award-winning recording artist, Academy Award-winning actress, and Tony and Emmy Award-winning producer, Jennifer Hudson is the youngest female EGOT winner in history.\n\nFrom humble beginnings, Hudson began singing in a small Chicago church where, week after week, she brought the congregation to its feet. From there, she’s gone on to worldwide acclaim.\n\nHudson is currently starring in her highly acclaimed nationally syndicated talk show, “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” which is in production for its second season, and has already been picked up for a third. The show features her powerful voice in a new way, bringing fun, uplifting, and empowering conversations to the forefront. “The Jennifer Hudson Show” was the only new show nominated for a People’s Choice Award this past year, and also received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination. Hudson was awarded the AAFCA “We See You Award” this year after an incredible first season, in which she also won the NAACP Image Award for Best Talk Show Host, was named one of People magazine’s “People of the Year” and one of Glamour magazine’s “Women of the Year.” “The Jennifer Hudson Show” has hosted an exciting slate of guests thus far, including Oprah Winfrey, Shaquille O’Neal, Matthew McConaughey, Mariah Carey, Viola Davis, Adam Sandler, Chance the Rapper, Ciara, DJ Khaled, and John Legend among others.\n\nHudson cemented her historic EGOT status by earning a Tony Award as co-producer on 2022’s Best Musical, “A Strange Loop”. This followed her electrifying turn as Aretha Franklin in the critically acclaimed biopic, “Respect,” a role for which she was handpicked by Franklin and garnered her a Screen Actors Guild nomination. She was named “Entertainer of the Year” at the 2022 NAACP Image Awards and recently earned Grammy and Golden Globe nominations for the film’s original song, “Here I Am (Singing My Way Home),” which she co-wrote alongside the legendary Carole King.\n\nHudson has been named one of Time magazine’s “Most Influential People in the World,” starred in countless film and television projects, released chart-topping albums, made her Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning production of “The Color Purple,” and has been a celebrated coach on both the US and UK versions of the Emmy Award winning juggernaut “The Voice.” She also penned a New York Times best-selling memoir that inspired millions, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, sang at the Super Bowl, and has been invited to perform for countless world leaders, including multiple presidents, royalty, and the Pope. Hudson even has her own day named after her in the city of Chicago.\n\nIn 2007, Hudson won an Academy Award for her role as Effie in the smash hit Dreamgirls, an adaptation of the Broadway musical. Her breakout film performance also garnered a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA and an NAACP Image Award. In 2009 along with her sister Julia, Hudson founded The Julian D. King Gift Foundation as a catalyst for change in children’s health, education and welfare. The Foundation exists to provide stability, support and positive experiences for children of all backgrounds so that they will become productive, confident and happy adults.\n\nLil Wayne & Young Money Entertainment\n\nLil Wayne rewrote the entire game in his image. The five-time GRAMMY® Award-winning multi-platinum rap icon, Young Money Entertainment founder, acclaimed author, pro skater, philanthropist, and history-making superstar left an indelible tattoo on the culture. By 2020, he cemented his legacy forever as “one of the best-selling artists of all time,” tallying sales in excess of 100 million records worldwide with 25 million albums and 90 million digital tracks sold in the United States alone.\n\nIn 2022, Wayne earned his first Diamond certification from the RIAA with his generational smash hit “Lollipop” feat. Static Major. Not to mention, he garnered 11 BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, two MTV VMAs, and eight NAACP Image Awards. Among many milestones, he emerged as “the first male artist to surpass Elvis Presley with the most entries on the Billboard Hot 100,” logging a staggering 183 entries – the 3rd most of all time. With a discography highlighted by five career spanning #1 debuts beginning with 2008’s 6x platinum, 3x GRAMMY® Award-winning opus Tha Carter III and its 5x platinum, 2011 successor Tha Carter IV, he released the latest version of the series – Tha Carter V – in 2018. Not only did it clinch #1 on the Billboard 200, but it also achieved “the second-largest streaming week for an album in history.” Every song on the tracklisting charted on the Billboard Hot 100 as he became “the first artist to debut two songs in the top 5.” It all bulldozed the way for his thirteenth full-length, Funeral, a year later.\n\nSimultaneously, Wayne owns and operates Young Money Entertainment as C.E.O. The company ignited the careers of two of the most successful artists ever—Drake and Nicki Minaj. The committed philanthropist founded The One Family Foundation too.\n\nT-Pain\n\nT-Pain (born Faheem Rashad Najm) has not only changed the course of pop, hip-hop and R&B, but has reshaped the fabric of culture itself. He’s sold over 50 million singles, accumulated billions of streams, racked up 10 iconic #1s on the Billboard Hot 100 and captivated the world with his spectacular live performances, earning a reputation as a global phenomenon. His ability to command sold-out venues around the world is testament to his distinctive talent and charisma. Earlier this year, the GRAMMY-winning, international music icon released his acclaimed covers album, On Top of The Covers, via his own Nappy Boy Entertainment, which features an eclectic and unexpected mix of reimagined hits.\n\nT-Pain won the first season of FOX’s “The Masked Singer” after stunning audiences with his soulful, non-Auto-Tuned voice, and he boasts one of the most-watched “Tiny Desk” sessions and “Hot Ones” interviews of all time.\n\nSince emerging in 2004, the Tallahassee trailblazer’s influence has transcended generations in music and more; he shines as a Twitch phenomenon and uber popular streamer, label head of his own independent Nappy Boy Entertainment and Nappy Boy Automotive, podcast host, expert drift driver, actor, author, HelloFresh spokesperson and purveyor of delicious wing spices through his collaboration with Spicewalla. Just at the end of last year, he received the Legend Award at this year’s Soul Train Awards, and he recently released “Baby Got Brap,” his first musical collaboration with his Nappy Boy Motorsports President, Hert, as well as standout single “That’s How We Ballin” ft. Snoop Dogg and its coinciding “Pee Wee’s Big Adventure” parody video.\n\nZedd\n\nMulti-platinum, GRAMMY® Award-winning artist/DJ/producer Zedd made his debut with “Clarity” after signing with Interscope in 2012 and has been breaking down barriers surrounding music genres ever since. Throughout his career, Zedd has worked with a diverse range of artists to create hits, including Foxes on “Clarity” (which earned Zedd a 2014 GRAMMY® “Best Dance Recording”), Hayley Williams on RIAA platinum-certified hit, “Stay The Night” (which racked up more than 1.3 billion streams ), and Selena Gomez on the platinum-certified track, “I Want You To Know,” which spent four weeks at #1 on Billboard’s “Hot Dance/Electronic Songs” chart.\n\nHe’s also collaborated with Alessia Cara on their hit single “Stay The Night” which has amassed over 6.3 billion streams worldwide, held the #1 spot at Top 40 radio for six consecutive weeks and earned Zedd his second GRAMMY® Award nomination, and with Maren Morris and Grey on the monster hit “The Middle,” which earned Zedd is second #1 at Top 40 radio. Digitally, the song has over 4.7 billion streams worldwide and earned Zedd three GRAMMY® nominations including “Record Of The Year,” “Song Of The Year,” and “Best Pop Duo or Group Performance.”\n\nLast year, Zedd opened the NHL All-Star Game with a performance during player introductions and he was the official pregame DJ during player warmups at this year’s NFL Super Bowl LVI. This year, he headlined Outside Lands Music Festival, Ultra Miami & Europe, and made his scripted acting debut in “The Muppets Mayhem” on Disney+.\n\nWalker Hayes\n\nMonument Records recording artist Walker Hayes is a singer/songwriter originally from Mobile, Ala. In 2021, his smash hit “Fancy Like” topped every country music sales and streaming chart, spent more than six months at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart, hit the top 5 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Songs, hit No. 1 at country radio, and gave Hayes his first GRAMMY Award nomination as an artist for Best Country Song. The song was also featured in a nationwide Applebee’s commercial. That track, as well as follow up single’s “AA,” “Y’all Life,” and “Good With Me” have made Hayes one of the top selling and streamed artists in country music.\n\nHayes has performed his music, including the Double-Platinum RIAA certified hit “You Broke Up With Me,” to national audiences on Good Morning America, Late Night with Seth Meyers, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and TODAY, and he was profiled for CBS Sunday Morning. Hayes just wrapped his headlining arena tour, The Duck Buck Tour, his second arena tour in in two years, after he closed out the the Glad You’re Here tour last fall. A tour which is the same title as the book he released with his best friend, Craig Allen Cooper, detailing his journey to finding Christ.\n\nBabyface\n\nBabyface is a 12-time Grammy Award-winning recording artist, songwriter, producer, and one of the most celebrated creative forces in music history. He is the only producer to win the ‘Producer of the Year’ category four times, three times of which was in consecutive years (1995-1997); a record he holds to this day. Kenny is also co-founder of the legendary record label LaFace, which launched the careers of artists like Usher, Toni Braxton, TLC, Outkast, and Pink.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in Indianapolis, Kenny developed his love for music early on when he began songwriting at the age of 12. Upon graduating high school, he got signed to his first record deal after joining the band, Manchild. In the 1980s, he broke into the music world as guitarist and songwriter for the R&B band, The Deele. Over the past five decades, he released three consecutive multi-platinum albums: Tender Lover (1989), featuring the #1 “Tender Lover”; For the Cool in You (1993), which included “Never Keeping Secrets” and “When Can I See You”; and The Day (1996) featuring “Every Time I Close My Eyes.”\n\nBabyface has written and produced hits for artists like Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, Mary J Blige, Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin, George Michael, Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, Phil Collins, Janet Jackson, Chaka Khan, Anita Baker, Faith Evans, Jay Z, Stevie Wonder, Chris Brown, John Mayer, Lionel Richie, Michael Bolton, Kenny G, Lil Wayne, Luther Vandross, Barbara Streisand, Puff Daddy, Bruno Mars, and countless others. Most recently Babyface had his latest no. 1 hit, “As a Matter of Fact” and was nominated for three 2024 GRAMMY Awards in the following categories: Best R&B Album (Girls Night Out,) Best Traditional R&B Performance (“Simple” by Babyface & Coco Jones off his Girls Night Out album,) and for Best R&B Song (“Snooze” by SZA.)\n\nKeith Urban\n\nKeith Urban has spent the better part of his life harnessing a deep-seated passion for music. This, when combined with his authenticity, talent and driving musical inquisitiveness, helps to understand why he is one of the most successful and well-respected artists in the world. He’s won four GRAMMY© Awards, 13 CMAs, 15 ACMs, three AMAs, two People’s Choice Awards and celebrated nine consecutive gold, platinum or multi-platinum albums.\n\nUrban’s musical virtuosity and fluidity has made him the musician’s musician. He’s collaborated with a diverse group of artists that include, among others; Billy Gibbons, Buddy Guy, Carrie Underwood, Chris Stapleton, Eric Church, John Mayer, Julia Michaels, Justin Timberlake, Dzeko, Miranda Lambert, Nile Rodgers, Post Malone, Taylor Swift, The Rolling Stones and Vince Gill.\n\nHe’s long supported numerous charities. His “All For The Hall” benefit concerts for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum© have raised over $4.3 million. He is the first Ambassador of the CMA Foundation, an advisory board member at the St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital and is a longtime supporter of The Mr. Holland’s Opus Fund and The Grammy Foundation.\n\nCharlotte Cardin\n\nThe Montréal-born and Paris-based singer, songwriter, and creator exhales raw truths through a haze of nocturnal production, leaving pieces of her story on tape. After generating hundreds of millions of streams and earning widespread praise courtesy of Harper’s BAZAAR, The FADER, Interview, W Magazine, and more, the four-time JUNO Award winner opens up like never before on her second full-length offering, 99 Nights [Cult Nation/Atlantic Records].\n\nSurrounded by music as a kid, writing and performing always felt right. Following the Big Boy EP and Main Girl EP, Charlotte emerged as an international phenomenon with her 2021 debut Phoenix. At the 2022 JUNO Awards, the LP took home “Album of the Year” and “Pop Album of the Year,” while “Meaningless” garnered “Single of the Year” and she personally received “Artist of the Year.” Not to mention, it picked up the Felix Award for “Anglophone Album of the Year.” Inciting unanimous tastemaker applause, HYPEBAE christened her “one of Canada’s brightest young talents.” Following sold out headline dates and powerhouse turns at Bonnaroo and Festival d’Été de Québec, she topped the bill at Osheaga, marking a momentous Montréal homecoming. Along the way, she carefully assembled what would become 99 Nights. After initial sessions in Montréal, she wrote and recorded in London, Los Angeles, and Toronto to “fuel a creative free flow.”\n\nCoco Jones\n\nThe Grammy-nominated 26-year-old multi-hyphenate actor, singer/songwriter who stars on the Peacock hit Bel-Air, recently released her major-label debut EP What I Didn’t Tell You with hit single “ICU.”\n\nCoco has been in film and on TV since she was a tween, starting out as a recurring guest on Disney’s musical sketch comedy, So Random!, and, in 2012, as the golden-voiced love interest in the network’s TV movie, Let It Shine.\n\nMost recently, she was nominated for Five Grammy Awards, including the highly coveted Best New Artist award. In 2023 Coco won Outstanding New Artist at the 54th NAACP Image Awards, Best New Artist at the BET Awards and BET Soul Train Awards.\n\nYou also may have seen her on the tiny screen—with millions of social media followers, dedicated to upping representation for proud, talented, dark-skinned Black women. In 2020, in an act of vulnerability and bravery, Jones decided to respond to a viral tweet asking what had happened with her career via YouTube. She filled fans in on obstacles she’d faced as a dark-skinned Black girl in both the acting and music industry and was met with an outpour of support. “It reignited me dreaming big dreams,” Jones says of the endearing online experience. From there, she began speaking positive affirmations, claiming the creative endeavors she longed to sink her teeth into.\n\nFast-forward to 2023, the multi-faceted Coco Jones, signed to High Standardz/Def Jam Recordings, has at last launched her music career with a brand of R&B as soulful as it is relatable, as diary-honest as it is marked by powerful storytelling. And though she’s young, it’s been a long time coming."
