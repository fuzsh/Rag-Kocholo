        "text": "Programs for Early Childhood\n\nFamily and Child Education was initiated in 1990 and currently has programs in 54 Bureau of Indian Education schools. It was designed as a family literacy program, an integrated model for an early childhood/parental involvement program for American Indian families in BIE-funded schools. Evaluation indicates that FACE programs are succeeding in addressing achievement gaps for American Indian children primarily located on rural reservations, and in better preparing them for school.\n\nThe goals of the FACE program are: to support parents/primary caregivers in their role as their child's first and most influential teacher; to increase family literacy; to strengthen family-school-community connections; to promote the early identification and services to children with special needs; to increase parent participation in their child's learning; to support and celebrate the unique cultural and linguistic diversity of each American Indian community served by the program, and to promote lifelong learning. Program services integrate language and culture in two settings: home and school. The FACE program provides educational services to prenatal to grade three and adults seeking a general education diploma or career training and placement.\n\nThe FACE Continuing Application must be completed on Native Star. All FACE applications are due annually on May 30th. If you have any questions regarding the Native Star application process, please contact the BIE Native Star manager.\n\nFACE program is in the Office of Sovereignty in Indian Education, Managed by Spike Bighorn\n\nIDEIA Tribal Count Data Requirements Part B (Children Ages 3 through 5 years) - (October 2, 2018)\n\nIDEIA Tribal Count Data Requirements Part C (Birth through 2 years) - (October 2, 2018)\n\nFACE Guidelines SY19 (June 14, 2018)\n\nFACE Resources.org\n\nCLICK HERE - Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) Part C & B (Birth through Fives Years Old) for Tribal Child Count, December 1, 2015\n\nFACE Reports\n\nFACE Executive Summary 2019 Study\n\nFACE Evaluation 2019 Report\n\nFACE Executive Summary 2018 Study\n\nFACE Evaluation 2018 Report\n\nFACE Executive Summary 2017 Study\n\nFACE Evaluation 2017 Report\n\nFACE Executive Summary 2016 Study\n\nFACE Evaluation 2016 Report\n\nFACE Executive Summary 2015 Study\n\nFACE Evaluation 2015 Report\n\nFACE Executive Summary 2014 Study\n\nFACE Evaluation 2014 Report"
