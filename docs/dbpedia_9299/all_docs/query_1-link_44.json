        "text": "Every parent wants the best for their child,we all want our children to be comfortable especially at a time when we physically can't be there. Beyond giving them the assets and finances we must strive to give them the knowledge to teach them to be resilient. Children must begin to learn how to manage their finances from a young age. Not every one takes the entrepreneurial journey but we all need the entrepreneurial skills cause life on its own is a business we must invest in. Beyond the general education what life skills are we investing into our children from a young age? It's Never Too Early! #financialliteracy #entrepreneurship #publicspeaking #climatechange #wastemanagement\n\nWhy Entrepreneurship Education is Critical in Today‚Äôs World In a changing world, traditional education alone is no longer enough. Here‚Äôs why introducing entrepreneurship to kids can help them. Adaptability- They learn to navigate and work through changes Innovation- It encourages them to think creatively and in turn can turn them into great problem solvers Resilience- It teaches them to see failure as a learning experience and not just a bad outcome of hard work. Finance- Builds a good foundation because they can learn financial literacy from a young age #entrepreneurship #business #kidpreneur #financialliteracy\n\nTo foster an entrepreneurial mindset in children, it's crucial to teach them that education extends beyond schoolbooks. Just as they pursue sports beyond school, they should also learn about money management, the value of hard work, and creative thinking. These experiences and lessons will help them develop the skills and resilience needed for entrepreneurship. üåü #Entrepreneurship #EarlyEducation #LifeSkills #FinancialLiteracy #realestate #realestateflipping #realestateinvestor #realestateflip Hit the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button if this video is helpful Follow @rickbowal for Real Estate Investing Tips üëâüèΩ @rickbowal üëâüèΩ @rickbowal üëâüèΩ @rickbowal üëâüèΩ @rickbowal\n\nThere are some challenges to teaching entrepreneurial thinking to school children. It can be difficult to get young people interested in complex concepts like business and economics. However, there are a number of ways to make entrepreneurial thinking more accessible to children, such as using games, role-playing, and hands-on activities.#KIDSMBA Overall, the benefits of teaching entrepreneurial thinking to school children far outweigh the challenges. By helping children develop the skills they need to be successful entrepreneurs, we can give them a better chance of achieving their full potential. #ABE #ABE50 #entrepreneurlife #entrepreneurs #teachers #KIDSMBA\n\nI have been learning about social enterprises at school. I want to find a way to make a meaningful impact in my community and combine it with all the business and finance classes I've been taking at school. This is a really cool program. #CSUF #Entrepreneurship #Finance\n\nDid you know, 70% of 13-17 year-olds report that a successful career is one that would allow them to help others? Our Term 4 Pay It Forward Program taps into your child's inner change-maker. It's an amazing way to learn about entrepreneurship and create value for others. Email: info@firstpivot.com.au to learn more! #changemakers #entrepreneur #students #socialimpact #learning #education #schools #value #21stcenturyskills.\n\nEntrepreneurship changes rapidly. learn stuff which is relevant today & remember that the institutions are always a decade behind. no university or a foundation will update their subjects every 12 months. yes there's info which is timeless (taxes, funding, financing, planning) as well but the fundamentals are the kicker, not the long term game board.\n\nFirst Pivot is democratising entrepreneurial education. Our Pay It Forward Program brings the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship into underfunded classrooms. If you know a teacher that is planning for Term 1 and you can, please share our details with them! #entrepreneur #education #entrepreneurship #learning #teachers #students #parents #changemakers #payitforward #21stcenturyskills"
