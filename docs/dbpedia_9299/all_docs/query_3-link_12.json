        "text": "MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica — Reggae Sumfest’s Festival Night Two delivering a concert of the highest international standards on Saturday night at Catherine Hall Entertainment Complex. But from the ear-numbing screams it seemed the night belonged to Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds.\n\nReturning to Jamaica for the first time in over a decade, the multi-Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter enchanted the audience with his soulful tunes, transporting them back to an era of music that tugs at the heartstrings.\n\nThe crowd, enveloped in a wave of nostalgia, sang along to his timeless hits from the moment he sang the first note, creating a chorus of memories and emotions.\n\n“This is a journey through time,” Babyface said to screams, setting the stage for a medley of songs he wrote and produced for various artistes.\n\nWhen he performed Every Time I Close My Eyes, a hit from his days with The Deele, the crowd’s response was near-deafening.\n\nHits like Cool in You, Never Keeping Secrets, and Two Occasions turned the audience into a mass choir, fully captivated by the 66-year-old legend’s flawless performance.\n\nStarting his career post-high school, Babyface masterfully navigated through decades of hits, including songs he penned for other iconic artistes like Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton, Tevin Campbell, and Whitney Houston.\n\nClassics such as Exhale (Shoop Shoop), Braxton’ You’re Making Me High, Campbell’s\n\nCan We Talk, Boyz II Men’s End of the Road, Johnny Gill’s My My My, and Mary J Blige’s\n\nNot Gon’ Cry had audience members clutching their chests, eyes closed, fully immersed in the moment.\n\nAs Babyface expressed his gratitude for the warm Jamaican welcome, the thunderous applause he received was a testament to his extraordinary performance. The Catherine Hall crowd was more than satisfied.\n\nMaxine McCarthy travelled from the Bronx, New York, specifically to see Babyface.\n\n“I am 56 years old, and Babyface is the reason I came to this festival. It was worth every penny,” she shared. “I grew up on his music, and when I heard he was coming to Jamaica, I immediately made plans. This performance was everything I hoped for and more.”\n\nFirst-time patron Ashley Carrington echoed this sentiment, saying: “After the disappointment of Jada Kingdom’s no-show on Friday, Babyface saved my festival experience. He was a big reason I came, and he exceeded all my expectations. Seeing couples holding each other tight as he sang love songs, I enjoyed the moment just as much.”\n\nBabyface’s performance marked a significant moment as he became the first international act to grace the Reggae Sumfest stage since 2015, following the festival’s hiatus from featuring overseas artists.\n\nWhether this signals a return to international bookings for future events remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Babyface left an indelible mark on Reggae Sumfest 2024."
