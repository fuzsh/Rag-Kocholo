        "text": "Fetal development\n\nLearn how your baby is conceived and how your baby develops inside the mother's womb.\n\nWEEK BY WEEK CHANGES\n\nGestation is the period of time between conception and birth when a baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb. Because it's impossible to know exactly when conception occurs, gestational age is measured from the first day of the mother's last menstrual cycle to the current date. It is measured in weeks.\n\nThis means that during weeks 1 and 2 of pregnancy, a woman is not yet pregnant. This is when your body is preparing for a baby. A normal gestation lasts anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks.\n\nWeek 1 to 2\n\nThe first week of pregnancy starts with the first day of a woman's menstrual period. She is not yet pregnant.\n\nDuring the end of the second week, an egg is released from an ovary. This is when you are most likely to conceive if you have unprotected intercourse.\n\nWeek 3\n\nDuring intercourse, sperm enters the vagina after the man ejaculates. The strongest sperm will travel through the cervix (the opening of the womb, or uterus), and into the fallopian tubes.\n\nA single sperm and the mother's egg cell meet in the fallopian tube. When the single sperm enters the egg, conception occurs. The combined sperm and egg is called a zygote.\n\nThe zygote contains all of the genetic information (DNA) needed to become a baby. Half the DNA comes from the mother's egg and half from the father's sperm.\n\nThe zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube. During this time, it divides to form a ball of cells called a blastocyst.\n\nA blastocyst is made up of an inner group of cells with an outer shell.\n\nThe inner group of cells will become the embryo. The embryo is what will develop into your baby.\n\nThe outer group of cells will become structures, called membranes, which nourish and protect the embryo.\n\nWeek 4\n\nOnce the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it buries itself in the uterine wall.\n\nAt this point in the mother's menstrual cycle, the lining of the uterus is thick with blood and ready to support a baby.\n\nThe blastocyst sticks tightly to the wall of the uterus and receives nourishment from the mother's blood.\n\nWatch this video about:Cell division\n\nWeek 5\n\nWeek 5 is the start of the \"embryonic period.\" This is when all the baby's major systems and structures develop.\n\nThe embryo's cells multiply and start to take on specific functions. This is called differentiation.\n\nBlood cells, kidney cells, and nerve cells all develop.\n\nThe embryo grows rapidly, and the baby's external features begin to form.\n\nYour baby's brain, spinal cord, and heart begin to develop.\n\nYour baby's gastrointestinal tract starts to form.\n\nIt is during this time in the first trimester that your baby is most at risk for damage from things that may cause birth defects. This includes certain medicines, illegal drug use, heavy alcohol use, infections such as rubella, and other factors.\n\nWeeks 6 to 7\n\nArm and leg buds start to grow.\n\nYour baby's brain forms into 5 different areas. Some cranial nerves are visible.\n\nEyes and ears begin to form.\n\nTissue grows that will become your baby's spine and other bones.\n\nYour baby's heart continues to grow and now beats at a regular rhythm. This can be seen by vaginal ultrasound.\n\nBlood pumps through the main vessels.\n\nWeek 8\n\nYour baby's arms and legs have grown longer.\n\nHands and feet begin to form and look like little paddles.\n\nYour baby's brain continues to grow.\n\nThe lungs start to form.\n\nWeek 9\n\nNipples and hair follicles form.\n\nArms grow and elbows develop.\n\nYour baby's toes can be seen.\n\nAll of your baby's essential organs have begun to grow.\n\nWeek 10\n\nYour baby's eyelids are more developed and begin to close.\n\nThe outer ears begin to take shape.\n\nYour baby's facial features become more distinct.\n\nThe intestines rotate.\n\nAt the end of the 10th week of pregnancy, your baby is no longer an embryo. It is now a fetus, the stage of development up until birth.\n\nFetal heart tones may be detectable by Doppler testing\n\nWeeks 11 to 14\n\nYour baby's eyelids close and will not reopen until about the 28th week.\n\nYour baby's face is well-formed.\n\nLimbs are long and thin.\n\nNails appear on the fingers and toes.\n\nGenitals appear.\n\nYour baby's liver is making red blood cells.\n\nThe head is very large -- about half of your baby's size.\n\nYour little one can now make a fist.\n\nTooth buds appear for the baby teeth.\n\nWeeks 15 to 18\n\nAt this stage, your baby's skin is almost transparent.\n\nFine hair called lanugo develops on your baby's head.\n\nMuscle tissue and bones keep developing, and bones become harder.\n\nYour baby begins to move and stretch.\n\nThe liver and pancreas produce secretions.\n\nYour little one now makes sucking motions.\n\nWeeks 19 to 21\n\nYour baby can hear.\n\nYour baby is more active and continues to move and float around.\n\nThe mother may feel a fluttering in the lower abdomen. This is called quickening, when mom can feel their baby's first movements.\n\nBy the end of this time, your baby can swallow.\n\nWeek 22\n\nLanugo hair covers baby's entire body.\n\nMeconium, your baby's first bowel movement, is made in the intestinal tract.\n\nEyebrows and lashes appear.\n\nYour baby is more active with increased muscle development.\n\nThe mother can feel the baby moving.\n\nYour baby's heartbeat can be heard with a stethoscope.\n\nNails grow to the end of your baby's fingers.\n\nWeeks 23 to 25\n\nBone marrow begins to make blood cells.\n\nThe lower airways of the baby's lungs develop.\n\nYour baby begins to store fat.\n\nWeek 26\n\nEyebrows and eyelashes are well-formed.\n\nAll parts of your baby's eyes are developed.\n\nYour baby may startle in response to loud noises.\n\nFootprints and fingerprints are forming.\n\nAir sacs form in your baby's lungs, but lungs are still not ready to work outside the womb.\n\nWeeks 27 to 30\n\nYour baby's brain grows rapidly.\n\nThe nervous system is developed enough to control some body functions.\n\nYour baby's eyelids can open and close.\n\nThe respiratory system, while immature, produces surfactant. This substance helps the air sacs fill with air.\n\nWeeks 31 to 34\n\nYour baby grows quickly and gains a lot of fat.\n\nRhythmic breathing occurs, but baby's lungs are not fully mature.\n\nYour baby's bones are fully developed, but are still soft.\n\nYour baby's body begins storing iron, calcium, and phosphorus.\n\nWeeks 35 to 37\n\nYour baby weighs about 5 1/2 pounds (2.5 kilograms).\n\nYour baby keeps gaining weight, but will probably not get much longer.\n\nThe skin is not as wrinkled as fat forms under the skin.\n\nYour baby has definite sleeping patterns.\n\nYour little one's heart and blood vessels are complete.\n\nMuscles and bones are fully developed.\n\nWeek 38 to 40\n\nLanugo is gone except for on the upper arms and shoulders.\n\nFingernails may extend beyond fingertips.\n\nSmall breast buds are present on both sexes.\n\nHead hair is now coarse and thicker.\n\nIn your 40th week of pregnancy, it has been 38 weeks since conception, and your baby could be born any day now.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nZygote; Blastocyst; Embryo; Fetus\n\nFeigelman S, Finkelstein LH.
