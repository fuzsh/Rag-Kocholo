If you have not received a shipping confirmation email within a few days of placing your order, please check your spam folder.\n\nIf your package is missing, please have a look around your property to see if it was tucked away out of sight. Fedex.com provides proof of delivery. You can track your package on their website to see a photo of where your package was left. If the package is not found, notify us within three days of the scanned delivery date at info@drunkelephant.com. We will start a trace with FedEx and take the required follow-up steps. This process takes approximately 2-3 business days.\n\nWe want you to love your Drunk Elephant purchase, so if you are not totally satisfied, please send an email to info@drunkelephant.com within 30 days of your purchase, and we will provide a return authorization and mailing information. We will be happy to provide a refund for the full amount of your purchase, minus shipping. Shipping fees are nonrefundable. Please note: Our warehouse does not accept returns. We cannot ensure that we will be able to properly locate and process your return without the return authorization and the correct return address.\n\nAll items purchased directly from drunkelephant.com may be accepted for a return. If you purchased a Drunk Elephant product from one of our authorized retailers, please contact them for assistance.\n\nYou can purchase any Drunk Elephant product from drunkelephant.com. Sephora and Ulta Beauty are our exclusive retail partners in the US. You can find Drunk Elephant online at sephora.com, ulta.com, kohls.com, and amazon.com sold by Quiverr, as well as in-store at Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and Kohl’s. For a full list of store locations, please visit our store locator.\n\nThere are some websites and dealers that claim to be authorized Drunk Elephant resellers but are not. Products sold on these websites or from these dealers do not carry a warranty from Drunk Elephant. When you purchase products from an unauthorized website or dealer, you are taking a risk because these products may be counterfeit, used, defective, or not manufactured for use in your country. Please protect yourself and your Drunk Elephant product by ensuring that you purchase Drunk Elephant products only from an authorized Drunk Elephant dealer.\n\nUnfortunately, drunkelephant.com does not ship outside the US. Please visit our international websites:\n\nCanada: drunkelephant.ca\n\nJapan: drunkelephant.jp\n\nFor a list of our international retail partners, please see the international section of our FAQ or visit our store locator.\n\nThere are some websites and dealers that claim to be authorized Drunk Elephant resellers but are not.

All promotion codes are available for a limited time and cannot be used once expired. Promotions are not redeemable for cash. Drunk Elephant reserves the right to change or rescind offers and promotion codes at any time. Please note that misuse of promotions and codes may result in order cancellation.\n\nIf you are having an issue with a promo code, please be sure your order meets all qualifications for the promo code and that the code is still valid. If you are still having issues, please contact customer service at info@drunkelephant.com.\n\nJust shop drunkelephant.com and proceed to checkout as usual. At checkout, select Afterpay as your payment method. You will be directed to the Afterpay website to register and provide payment details (Visa or Mastercard). If you’ve used Afterpay before, just log in to your Afterpay account! Then follow the steps to complete your order—it’s that easy! Usually, the first installment is paid at checkout, and the remaining three are made every two weeks (but don’t worry, your Drunk Elephant order will still ship out once your order is complete and processed!).\n\nPlease note, all items in your shopping bag must be eligible for Afterpay, and the order value must be between $35 and $1,000. Your first order, however, may have a lower maximum value. You will receive an instant approval decision on your order at checkout. Gift cards are not eligible for Afterpay; if you would like to also purchase a gift card, please place a separate order. You must be 18 years or older to create an Afterpay account.\n\nIf you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, please contact our Customer Relations team to return the item(s). If you return an order made through Afterpay for the first time, it can be confusing, as you may expect the entire payment schedule for your order to be readjusted to reflect the new order value.\n\nOnce the refund is processed by Drunk Elephant, it automatically drops through to Afterpay, and your payment installment plan is adjusted to reflect the new total order value, starting with the last payment installment and working backward.\n\nMost of our products do not have expiration dates because they are cosmetic products. All skincare products have a PAO (period after opening, i.e., first use) date that is printed on the packaging. This information is a guideline to get the most out of your products and use them at their peak efficacy.\n\nAll Drunk Elephant products have a 12-month PAO, with the exception of our Umbra Mineral Creams, which have a 24-month PAO.\n\nAs none of our products are produced in dedicated gluten-free facilities, we do not make this claim in association with our products. If you have a gluten intolerance or allergy, your physician needs to be the final word on whether our products are suitable for your sensitivities. We recommend taking the ingredient lists for any Drunk Elephant products you're considering to them for review, just to be safe.\n\nIf you are vegan, please consult the ingredient lists for animal-derived ingredients.\n\nThese are the six ingredients that we feel are at the root of most skin behaviors we see, including oily, acne-prone, inflamed, sensitive, combination, dry/dehydrated, and more. They are nothing to be scared of, but we believe that eliminating the Suspicious 6™ from your routine allows skin to reset to a normal, balanced state, which means the products you are using can work as intended and deliver the best results. Instead of worrying about your skin “type,” remove silicones, essential oils, fragrances/dyes, drying alcohols, SLS, and chemical sunscreens and let your skin function and thrive as it can and should. It’s well worth the effort, and it’s the best way to get the most out of the Drunk Elephant philosophy. Follow #barewithus on Instagram to see how our philosophy is working for people.\n\nYes, however not every product in our line should be used by younger fans, 12 and under. In general, we do not recommend using products containing high concentration of active ingredients, which address concerns that aren’t present at such an age.\n\nAs always, we recommend parents instruct and supervise younger fans, 12 and under, on how to use Drunk Elephant products and routines. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any questions.\n\nFor younger fans, 12 and under, who are interested in getting into skincare and developing healthy routines, we have gentle formulas/options to consider. For face: Beste No. 9, Pekee, E-Rase, Slaai, Lala, Lippe, Virgin Marula Oil, Umbra SPF 30 sunscreens, D-Bronzi, O-Bloos, F-Balm, B-Hydra, and Wonderwild. For hair and body: Cocomino and Silkamino hair products, Wild Marula Tangle Spray, Sili and Sili Whipped Body Lotions.\n\nWhile the above formulas are gentle formulas/options to consider, we would note that they’re not all necessary. Start slow, with just a few basics (cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen), which can help establish a lifetime of healthy skin habits. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any additional questions.\n\nAs always, we recommend parents instruct and supervise younger fans, 12 and under, on how to use Drunk Elephant products and routines. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any questions.\n\nYes. Younger fans, 12 and under, should not use due to their very active nature: A-Passioni, A-Gloei, A-Shaba, B-Goldi, Babyfacial, Bouncy Brightfacial, C-Firma, C-Luma, Juju, Koffie Scrub, Protini Serum, Sweet Pitti, Scrubbi Bamboes, *T.L.C. Framboos, T.L.C. Glycolic Body Lotion, and T.L.C. Happi Scalp Scrub.\n\nProtini Cream, though both safe and gentle is less appropriate given its main job is to help boost healthy collagen to strengthen skin. At such a young age, you’re making collagen in abundance, so it’s less of a useful formula, which is why we recommend Lala or Virgin Marula as the moisturizer first stop for kids and tweens.\n\n*When it comes to T.L.C. Framboos and tweens, it’s more a question of need and skin concern. While a perfectly safe formula, T.L.C. Framboos focuses on exfoliation and decongesting pores, which for many tweens, just isn’t necessary yet. However, those who are experiencing breakouts and blackheads can absolutely benefit from it—just start slow, 1-3 times per week, and be sure to wear SPF every single day, no exceptions.\n\nWhat about eye creams? While C-Tango & Ceramighty are safe, gentle and nourishing options for skin, a separate eye cream isn’t necessary given the specific concerns for such a product likely just aren’t present in younger skin. Your moisturizer (like Lala, for example) may give you everything you need around the eye area.\n\nAs always, we recommend parents instruct and supervise younger fans, 12 and under, on how to use Drunk Elephant products and routines. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any questions.\n\nYes! For younger fans, 12 and under, a basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen are really all that is needed. Our Beste No. 9 or Pekee Bar cleanser at night, followed with a few drops of Virgin Marula Oil for balance and moisture is a great example. In the morning, consider just a splash with a little water instead of cleansing, and then apply Virgin Marula Oil followed by Umbra SPF 30 sunscreen. Use Lippe on the lips day and night. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any additional questions.\n\nAs always, we recommend parents instruct and supervise younger fans, 12 and under on how to use Drunk Elephant products and routines. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any questions.\n\nYes, teens can use any product in the Drunk Elephant line depending on their skin behaviors or concerns. Remember, not everything is necessary, and it’s important to take it slow. Start with the basics, establishing a simple routine of cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen—sometimes just that can go a long way towards addressing many issues, like breakouts or redness. If needed, then add in one treatment product at a time, giving it a few weeks to produce results before adding anything else. Products containing high concentration of active ingredients can be beneficial in addressing many skin concerns.\n\nOur guiding recommendation is to always listen to your skin and email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any questions. Discontinue use immediately if irritation occurs and consult a physician/dermatologist.\n\nTeens can use any product in the Drunk Elephant line (even products containing actives) depending on their skin behaviors or concerns, however, they may not need every product. We believe their main skincare needs can be met by using a gentle cleanser (Beste No. 9 or Pekee), a basic moisturizer (Lala), and a sunscreen (like our Umbra Sheer or Tinte SPF 30 sunscreens). If needed, then add in one treatment product at a time, giving it a few weeks to produce results before adding anything else.\n\nOur guiding recommendation is to always listen to your skin and email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any questions. Discontinue use immediately if irritation occurs and consult a physician/dermatologist.\n\nYes! For many teens, a basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen are really all that is needed. Consider cleansing with Beste No. 9 at night and follow with one pump of Lala or a few drops of Virgin Marula Oil. In the morning, splash with a little water and then apply Lala or Virgin Marula Oil again followed by Umbra Sheer or Tinte SPF 30 sunscreens. Use Lippe on the lips day and night. Please email us at info@drunkelephant.com with any additional questions.\n\nIf the above basic routine isn’t curbing skin congestion (blackheads, breakouts, overly oily skin, etc.), consider adding in T.L.C. Framboos, which is a 10% AHA/1.0% BHA exfoliating serum that focuses on decongesting pores. Try just 1-3 times a week at night, after cleansing, for the first month, and see how things are going. If needed, gradually working up to nightly use.\n\nYes! For many teens, a basic routine of cleanser (Beste No. 9), moisturizer (Lala or Virgin Marula Oil) and sunscreen (Umbra) can make a major difference in breakouts, not just by establishing a regular routine of caring for skin, but also by eliminating any ingredient categories that can disrupt and sensitize skin. FYI: We call those the Suspicious 6 for short, which refers to the six categories of ingredients that are at the root cause of many common skin issues (like sensitivity, inflammation, and breakouts).

However, if you’re asking about animal testing, let’s be clear: That is something we would never do. Hong Kong SAR does not require animal testing. That is the only place where we will be selling in retail (via Sephora HK). In mainland China, we are using cross border e-commerce, which does not require the same registration process as cosmetics sold via retail there. We are Leaping Bunny Program certified and have never, nor will we ever, animal test or allow our products to be tested on animals."
