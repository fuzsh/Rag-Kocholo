        "text": "On Friday, April 28, 2023, Sydney Sweeney was spotted with fiancé Jonathan Davino in New York City at an Armani Beauty event at the Gansevoort Hotel, joined by friends Lukas Gage, Chris Appleton, Dylan Sprouse, Chase Stokes and AnnaSophia Robb. The couple was matching in black ensembles, including leather jackets.\n\nThe Euphoria star's relationship has recently received a great deal of scrutiny. Rumors of an affair between her and Anyone But You costar Glen Powell have run rampant since his split with girlfriend Gigi Paris. Sweeney and Powell certainly have notable chemistry at events for their upcoming romcom, but that's what most casting directors are looking for to begin with. And a source told TMZ on April 25 that Sweeney and Davino are definitely still together and the perceived flirting is just part of the movie promotion. Sweeney and Davino are possibly showing a united front in the face of all that speculation.\n\nHere's everything to know about the affianced couple.\n\nWho is Jonathan Davino?\n\nIt's believed that Davino lives in Chicago, due to come coy references Sweeney has made to moving to the Windy City to join a “friend” in past interviews. People and TMZ have both reported that Davino comes from a family that owns device technology and packaging company 14th Round and Final Bell. He was listed in Crain's Chicago Business the owner of two Chicago restaurants, Mista Pizza and Pompei Xpress, which have both closed.\n\nSweeney later shut down the restauranteur claim in a December 2023 interview with Glamour UK. “He’s not a restaurateur,” she said. “I have no idea where that came from. He’s also not the heir of a pizza company. He’s a business guy. He’s from Chicago. We’ve been watching [this narrative] for six years now and I’m like, ‘What the hell?’”\n\nHow long have Davino and Sweeney been dating?\n\nThe couple were first linked in 2018, and were reported to be engaged in 2022. Davino is 13 years older than the 26-year-old HBO star. There are not many photos of them together, but they were spotted at an Emmys party at the Nomad hotel in Los Angeles in September 2018. In October of that year, they were photographed InStyle and Kate Spade dinner party.\n\nIn November of 2020, they were photographed kissing in Hawaii, where Sweeney was filming her role on The White Lotus, Just Jared reported at the time.\n\nSweeney later said in December 2023 that they had been together for six years.\n\nWhat has Sweeney said about Davino?\n\nThe actress does not seem to talk about him at all, but she did explain to Cosmopolitan in February 2022 that she doesn't want to date anyone in the spotlight to maintain her privacy.\n\n“I don’t date people in the spotlight,” she said. “I don’t date actors or musicians or anyone in entertainment because I can just be normal Syd that way and it’s easiest... I have a great support system.”\n\nShe added, “I have people who will battle for me and allow me to be on the pedestal and shine without making me feel like, 'Oh no, I’m shining too bright and I need to step back.’”\n\nShe did describe her ideal partner to Cosmo, saying, “I look for a best friend. I need to be able to be with someone who I can literally hang out with 24/7 and never get sick of and we laugh every single day.”\n\nShe spoke to Variety in an interview published in August 2023 about producing with Davino for her production company Fifty-Fifty Films. She didn't offer much, just: “I like working with smart individuals.”\n\nShe later addressed her privacy with her love life in her December 2023 Glamour UK interview. “Everyone is always so curious about who I’m with and what’s that like, but I think it’s important to have something for me,” she said. “I’m very open [otherwise]. I talk about so much and sometimes it gets me in trouble, but I do try to keep something for me.”\n\nWith Davino, “I’ve been in a steady relationship for a really long time, which is not normal in this industry and not normal for my age,” she said. “What I’ve noticed about the idea of celebrity is people really love to build someone up, and then tear them down.”\n\nDid Sweeney address the Glen Powell dating rumors?\n\nSweeney spoke to Variety in its August 2023 interview about how she and Powell purposely leaned into dating rumors to promote their film. “It’s a rom-com,” she said with a laugh. “That’s what people want! Glen and I don’t really care. We have so much fun together, and we respect each other so much; he’s such a hard worker, and I’m a hard worker. We’re excited for the press tour, and I literally just left ADR with him. We talk all the time like, ‘That’s really funny.’”\n\nShe added that they enjoyed fueling the gossip: “They want it. It’s fun to give it to ’em.”\n\nShe touched on them again in December 2023 in a Glamour UK interview. She said of the affair speculation, “It was really hard on Glen, which made me sad… because [otherwise] it was such a beautiful experience for the both of us. I care for him so much.”\n\nShe also noted that her barely being photographed with Davino probably played into fan speculation “Also, I’ve never really shared that much [about my relationship], so the press loves to create drama in stories.”\n\nOn March 2, 2024, Sweeney hosted Saturday Night Live and used her opening monologue to joke about the situation.\n\n“I’d say the craziest rumor I’ve seen is that while I was filming Anyone But You, I was having an affair with my co-star Glen Powell,” Sweeney started. “That’s obviously not true. Me and my fiancé produced the movie together and he was there the entire shoot. And I just want to let everyone know that he’s the man of my dreams and we’re still together and stronger than ever. He even came here tonight to support me. Can we cut to him?”\n\nThe camera then panned to Powell seated in the audience.\n\n“No, that's not my fiancé,” she insisted. “He's in my dressing room!”\n\nHave Sweeney and Davino attended any festivals together?\n\nThe couple was photographed arriving in Venice during the 2023 Venice Film Festival. They matched each other in white ensembles. It was unclear when they arrived if they would be attending the film event, given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. They both worked together on Anyone But You through Sweeney’s production company, but Sweeney also acted in the project and thus would be barred from promoting the big studio project as a guild member.\n\nThey were also photographed leaving the Hotel Martinez during the 76th Cannes film festival in May 2023, which was held in Cannes, France.\n\nIn March 2024, as Sweeney began promoting her film Immaculate, Davino was in the group photos of its premiere at the 2024 SXSW Conference and Festival.\n\nAnd then again at the Beyond Fest Premiere.\n\nHow are their wedding plans going?\n\nSweeney said in December that the couple hasn’t really started during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “I am so busy working! I’m a workaholic and I love it, I love it,” Sweeney said.\n\nShe also addressed working with Davino for her production company Fifty-Fifty Films, where Davino is a producing partner. “I think it’s incredible being able to work with people who you wanna be in business with,” she said. “It’s amazing having someone who cheers you on and someone who fully just supports what you do.”\n\nWhere have Sweeney and Davino been seen together in 2024?\n\nThe couple was photographed holding hands in New York City on March 21, 2024. Both smiled and wore sunglasses as paparazzi caught their stroll. Then on April 25, they were photographed embracing at LAX while waiting in baggage claim. He hugged her from behind and then they shared a kiss on the escalator after recovering their luggage."
