        "text": "When it was reported in September that pop rock band Maroon 5 would perform the halftime show at the 2019 Super Bowl in Atlanta, public opinion was, to say the least, not positive.\n\nBesides the normal overdramatization of negative social media reaction, more than 100,000 people signed an online petition requesting that the band drop out of the performance — in no small part driven by the continuing unemployment of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in reaction to his protests during the national anthem. (Rihanna and Cardi B reportedly refused to perform during the Super Bowl.)\n\nMost of the vitriol over Maroon 5’s selection, though, appeared to stem from the fact that the sextet had no regional connection to Atlanta.\n\nFor years, Atlanta has been considered one of the premier musical hubs in America, launching mainstream acts such as Usher, Ludacris, Migos, Outkast, Ciara and T.I., to name a few. That the NFL didn’t choose an artist from a musical capital like Atlanta was viewed — alongside the ostracism of Kaepernick, the pushback against kneeling players and the lack of African-American head coaches — as yet another example of the league ignoring its sizable black fan base.\n\nAnd while there may be merits to that argument (no hip-hop artist has ever headlined a Super Bowl halftime show), geographical origin has never been a requirement for halftime shows in the past. Even when the Super Bowl was held in musical hot spots such as Detroit, New York, Southern California and Houston, the artist’s hometown has rarely matched up with the site of the championship game. Since 1993, the superstar-helmed era of Super Bowl halftime entertainment, there have been only six artists (Travis Tritt, Gloria Estefan, Jessica Simpson, Big Boi, ’N Sync and No Doubt) who were either born, raised or groomed in that city or surrounding area, none of whom headlined that year’s show.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of each Super Bowl halftime show since 1993, identifying the location of each game, the artist, the artist’s hometown and which local act would have made more sense if the show had a hometown requirement.\n\n1993 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Pasadena, California\n\nArtist (hometown): Michael Jackson (Gary, Indiana)\n\nLocal choice: Dr. Dre (Compton, California), Red Hot Chili Peppers (Los Angeles), Guns N’ Roses (Los Angeles)\n\n1994 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Atlanta\n\nArtists (hometown): Clint Black (Katy, Texas), Tanya Tucker (Seminole, Texas), Travis Tritt (Marietta, Georgia), The Judds (Ashland, Kentucky)\n\nLocal choice: Arrested Development (Atlanta), Ray Charles (Albany, Georgia), Travis Tritt (Marietta)\n\n1995 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Miami Gardens, Florida\n\nArtists (hometown): Tony Bennett (New York City), Patti LaBelle (Philadelphia)\n\nLocal choice: KC and the Sunshine Band (Hialeah, Florida), Gloria Estefan (Havana/Miami), Arturo Sandoval (Artemisa, Cuba), 2 Live Crew (Miami)\n\n1996 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Tempe, Arizona\n\nArtist (hometown): Diana Ross (Detroit)\n\nLocal choice: Alice Cooper (Phoenix), Stevie Nicks (Phoenix)\n\n1997 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: New Orleans\n\nArtists (hometown): The Blues Brothers (Chicago), James Brown (Barnwell, South Carolina) and ZZ Top (Houston)\n\nLocal choice: Allen Toussaint (New Orleans), Fats Domino (New Orleans)\n\n1998 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: San Diego\n\nArtists (hometown): Boyz II Men (Philadelphia), Smokey Robinson (Detroit), Martha Reeves (Detroit), The Temptations (Detroit), Queen Latifah (East Orange, New Jersey)\n\nLocal choice: Coolio (Compton), Montell Jordan (Los Angeles), No Doubt (Anaheim, California)\n\n1999 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Miami Gardens, Florida\n\nArtists (hometown): Stevie Wonder (Saginaw, Michigan), Gloria Estefan (Havana, Cuba/Miami, Florida), Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (Ventura, California), Savion Glover (Newark, New Jersey)\n\nLocal choice: Gloria Estefan (Havana, Cuba/Miami, Florida)\n\n2000 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Atlanta\n\nArtists (hometown): Phil Collins (United Kingdom), Christina Aguilera (Staten Island, New York), Enrique Iglesias (Madrid), Toni Braxton (Severn, Maryland)\n\nLocal choice: TLC (Atlanta)\n\n2001 Super Bowl\n\nLocation: Tampa, Florida\n\nArtists (hometown): Aerosmith (Boston), ‘N Sync (Orlando, Florida), Britney Spears (Kentwood, Louisiana), Mary J.
