        "text": "How old is Toni Braxton and where is she from?\n\nToni Braxton was born in Severn, Maryland, United States, on October 7, 1967. She celebrated her 55th birthday in 2022.\n\nHer father, Michael Conrad Braxton Sr, was a Methodist clergyman, and her mother, Evelyn Jackson, was a former opera singer and cosmetologist, as well as a pastor.\n\nToni is the eldest of six siblings. She has a younger brother Michael Jr (born 1968) and four younger sisters Traci Renee (1971-2022), Towanda Chloe (born 1973), Trina Evette (born 1974), and Tamar Estine (born 1977).\n\nThe Braxtons were raised in a strict religious home, and Toni's first musical experience was singing in her church choir.\n\nWho were The Braxtons?\n\nThe Braxtons consisted of Toni Braxton and her younger sisters, Traci Braxton, Towanda Braxton, Trina Braxton, and Tamar Braxton.\n\nAll five members reunited in 2011 to star in the WEtv reality TV series Braxton Family Values alongside their mother, Evelyn Braxton.\n\nIn 2015, they reunited once more to release the album Braxton Family Christmas.\n\nTraci passed away in March 2022.\n\nThe Braxtons - Good Life 1990\n\nThe sisters first began to harmonize together when five-year-old Tamar demanded, \"somebody get me some toilet paper!\". Each sister and brother Michael went in the bathroom and began singing the 'Toilet Paper Song'.\n\nAs kids, they sang in the choir at several churches and toured the East Coast with their religious parents at various events.\n\nToni, Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar Braxton signed their first record deal in 1989. In 1990, they released their first single, 'Good Life'. It would be their only single as a quintet.\n\n'Good Life' was not a hit, and they were dropped from Arista Records.\n\nIn 1996, Tamar, Trina, and Towanda returned as a trio, with a new album So Many Ways, which was mildly successful.\n\nIs Toni Braxton married and does she have children?\n\nToni Braxton met musician Keri Lewis when his group, Mint Condition, opened her tour. They married in early 2001.\n\nIn December 2001, she gave birth to their first child, a son named Denim Cole Braxton-Lewis. Their second son, Diezel Ky Braxton-Lewis, was born in March 2003.\n\nDiezel was diagnosed with autism, and Toni has become involved with Autism Speaks, acting as their International Spokesperson.\n\nToni and Keri separated in late 2009, and divorced in 2013.\n\nShe began dating rapper Birdman in 2016, and the couple announced their engagement in 2018. Despite separating in 2019, they later confirmed that they were still together."
