Definitely recommend!\n\nStephenie Ribas\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nFeeling pretty disappointed with my service today. We did a 15 minute 2D and were in and out in maybe 5-8 minutes. Barley got to see the baby, and the pictures didn’t turn out great. Which really, can be understandable. More than anything we were looking forward to seeing baby girl moving around and such, but didn’t get to. We loved the stuff animal with the heartbeat, but other than that we’re feeling pretty disappointed that we didn’t get to see the baby longer and paid $60 to do so for 5-8 minutes.\n\nDayanis Valdivieso\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nThis is the second pregnancy I go to them and it’s always great.

I’ll continue coming back for the rest of this pregnancy as well!\n\nJadyn Just\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nGot my blood drawn right at 6 weeks since you can do the sneakpeak clinically now at 6 weeks. Was fast efficient and lady was super sweet and they were great with working with my schedule and squeezing me in. It said there was the minimal amount of DNA for processing but still enough (it said that with my son as well taken right at 6w or 6w and some change I believe) but that it worked and we are having a GIRL after two boys !! I am so ecstatic and pray and hope that it’s all accurate and as correct as clinical sneak peak has been for me with early images both times, since I did it right at 6 weeks. 😬🤞🏻 It says 99.99% accuracy so I’m not sure why make DNA wouldn’t have made the threshold so, so far I trust it. Also on their website it clearly states they are not responsible for delays made by fed ex, as I had to wait two nights for my results but it’s because when I followed the tracking given the tracking number provided, it sat in transit (fed ex’s fault) for almost an entire day- so not sweet baby face’s fault. Can’t wait to go back later in my pregnancy. Can anybody reach out to me and let me know if allowed, how many instances they have truly had with incorrect sneak peak? I’m so nervous and I want to accept this so bad. 😩💕💘💗\n\nSilver Jones\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nAmazing experience! Got to see my baby girl stretch, yawn, drink and smile. My whole family was able to see her on a big screen in such a warming environment. I’ll definitely be back to see her develop further. 10/10\n\nashlie herrell\n\nTrustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.\n\nGreat experience\n\nElective Ultrasound\n\nSchedule an appointment online"
