        "text": "What is Babyface's Net Worth?\n\nBabyface, born Kenneth Brian Edmonds, is an American R&B musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer who has a net worth of $200 million. Babyface is one of the most prolific songwriters and producers in the music industry. He's been ranked by a number of publications as one of the best record producers ever.\n\nKenneth Brian Edmonds, better known as Babyface, is an iconic figure in the music industry, renowned for his work as a singer, songwriter, and producer. His career, spanning several decades, is marked by a profound influence on R&B and pop music. Babyface's silky-smooth vocal style and his ability to craft emotive, relatable lyrics have made him a household name.\n\nBabyface's rise to fame began in the 1980s. He started as a member of the R&B band The Deele, where he met future collaborator Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid. Together, they formed one of the most successful production teams of the late 20th century, L.A. Reid and Babyface. Their partnership led to the creation of LaFace Records in 1989, a label that played a critical role in shaping the sound of R&B and pop in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAs a songwriter and producer, Babyface has worked with a who's who of the music industry, including Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, and Toni Braxton. His Midas touch has led to numerous hits, many of which have become timeless classics. He is particularly known for his ballads and smooth R&B tracks, often characterized by their emotional depth and melodic richness.\n\nBabyface's solo career is equally impressive. He has released several successful albums that showcase his soft, expressive vocal style and his knack for storytelling through music. His work often explores themes of love, relationships, and vulnerability, resonating deeply with audiences. His contributions to the industry have been recognized with numerous awards and accolades, including multiple Grammy Awards.\n\nDivorce Settlement\n\nBabyface's divorce from Tracey Edmonds, his wife from 1992 â€“ 2005, made headlines when it reportedly cost Babyface half of his total net worth, perhaps as much as $100 million. That's enough to make it one of the most expensive celebrity divorces ever. His varied interests, however, made it so that he could work on rebuilding his personal fortune.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBabyface was born on April 10, 1958, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Marvin and Barbara Edmonds. He is the fifth of six sons of his parents. Barbara was a production operator at a pharmaceutical plant. Edmonds' dad died of lung cancer when he was in eighth grade. It was at this time that he decided he was going to have a career in music. He was a shy kid and wrote songs as a way to express his emotions. He attended North Central High School in Indianapolis. He got his nickname when he was still a teenager by funk performer Bootsy Collins, who he was then performing with, and it is an obvious reference to his youthful looks.\n\nCareer\n\nHe performed in the group Manchild as a guitarist; in 1982, Edmonds played with funk band Redd Hott. Next, he played keyboards in the light-funk and R&B group the Deele, which also included drummer Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid. Babyface had one of his first big credits as a songwriter on the 1983 Midnight Star song \"Slow Jam.\" Babyface and Reid left The Deele in 1988.\n\nFrom the late 1980s to the early 90s, Babyface wrote for a number of popular artists of the time, including Bobby Brown, Pebbles, Karyn White, The Whispers, and Sheena Easton, to name just a handful. Babyface wrote Whitney Houston's 1990 hit \"I'm Your Baby Tonight.\" It was Babyface's first U.S. number-one hit. He also wrote the 1994 Boyz II Men hit \"I'll Make. Love to You,\" which was another number-one hit. Babyface produced the soundtrack for the 1995 movie \"Waiting to Exhale\" which included the number-one hit \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop) by Whitney Houston. Brandy and Mary J. Blige also had hits on the same soundtrack.\n\nHe released his debut studio album \"Lovers\" in 1986. His 1989 album \"Tender Lover\" reached number one on the U.S. R&B chart. His 1993 album \"For the Cool in You\" went triple platinum. Babyface released the highly successful album \"The Day\" in 1996 as well as the albums \"Christmas with Babyface\" in 1998, \"Face 2 Face\" in 2001, \"Grown & Sexy\" in 2005, \"Playlist\" in 2007, and \"Return of the Tender Lover\" in 2015.\n\nLaFace Records\n\nBabyface's career in the entertainment business really launched when he co-founded LaFace Records in 1989 with L.A. Reid. The label quickly signed TLC, Toni Braxton, and Usher, all of whom became very successful. Babyface wrote most of the songs on Braxton's first two very successful records, 1993's \"Toni Braxton\" and 1996's \"Secrets.\" Babyface was integral in helping TLC sell more than 75 million albums. TLC's second album \"CrazySexyCool,\" became the best-selling album of all time by an American girl group. LaFace also signed Usher when he was 16. He sold 65 million records while signed to LaFace.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nBabyface met Tracey McQuarn in 1990 when she auditioned for the music video for \"Whip Appeal.\" They married in September 1992. They have two sons, Brandon and Dylan. They divorced on the grounds of irreconcilable differences in October 2005 after 13 years of marriage.\n\nIn 2007, Babyface started dating Niko Pantenburg, one of his backup dancers. Their daughter was born in 2008. They married in May 2014.\n\nIn mid-April 2020, Babyface revealed via his Instagram account that he and his entire family are recovering from COVID-19. He and his family successfully fought the virus. \"I am happy to report we have now tested negative and are on our way back to full health,\" Babyface said.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn February 1998, Babyface paid $825,000 for a plot of land in LA's Bel Air neighborhood. In 2000 he completed construction on an 11,000 square foot mansion. He listed this home for sale in May 2022 for $8 million. He lowered the price to $7.5 million in November 2022. Here's a video tour of that home:\n\nIn May 2004, Babyface paid $4.1 million for a five-bedroom, six-bathroom 7,508 square foot home in LA's Bel Air Crest neighborhood.\n\nIn April 2004, just before he and then-wife Tracey announced their split, Babyface shelled out $5.15 million for an 8,245-square-foot mansion in the guard-gated Mulholland Estates community of Los Angeles. The house, which is down the street from Paris Hilton's pad and Charlie Sheen's lair, is now owned by ex-wife Tracey Edmonds.\n\nBabyface also owns a 3,614 square-foot foot mock-Mediterranian tract house in a gated development in Rancho Cucamonga, California, bought in February 2008 for $780,000, and a typical Las Vegas tract house he bought in June 1996 for $255,000.\n\nIn 2012, Babyface sold his home in Incline Village, Nevada, for $2.95 million. The 7,344 square foot home has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms on a wooded hillside above Lake Tahoe. He bought the home in March 1995 with then-wife Tracey for $1.9 million."
