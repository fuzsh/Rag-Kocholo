        "text": "I’m a lover of the English language and am a firm believer of using correct words most of the time when I’m engaged in conversation. What I’m trying to say is, I’m not a huge fan of slang. I don’t keep up with the most recent vernacular (especially in hip hop) and am usually the one in the group asking what skeet, skeet means. Yes, I’m often that clueless person in the group. If there is a slang word I happen to like, I tend to use it way more than I probably should. My favorite of the moment is HAM, as in “hot ass mess” (or, if you are a fan of Kanye West and Jay Z, it also means hard as a muth*****). HAM is the best way for me to describe the Jon B. show I witnessed Aug. 26, 2012. I won’t even discuss the venue (The Roxy Theatre in Denver, CO). I should have known this was going to be HAM when I received a raffle ticket as my entry to the concert. Complete HAM on that, especially since I save all my concert stubs and they had the nerve to charge a service fee! My second indication this would not be an ordinary show? The opening act. Dre Lane threw out T-shirts throughout the course of his set, but I wonder if it was to distract from his lack of originality and talent. I won’t knock him for trying, but you have to have more unique content than a song about haters, or doing a song originally sung by Tyrese and then asking the audience if they were feeling it. I would if Tyrese was up there. When Jon B. finally emerged, there was a keyboard on stage, so I’m thinking, okay, he’ll play the keys and sing. He played the keys alright, just at the wrong time. I didn’t mind that he sang along to the instrumental tracks because he sounded damn good, but what I didn’t understand was why he was responsible for starting and stopping each track. Isn’t this what you pay a DJ for? Jon B. would jump on the keys at the end of some songs, problem was, his playing didn't match up well with the still running track. It became sort of a distraction, as did the random people who walked on stage during his performance. HAM all the way around! I must disclose that my sister is more of a Jon B. fan than I am; therefore she knew the songs he sang, whereas there were three I recognized – Don’t Talk, They Don’t Know and Are You Still Down?. I really was there to keep her company.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI’m a fan from the first Cassette Tape!! Lol\n\nI was attached since Bonafide and kept up with Jon up till now. I was happy to actually meet him back 10 years in Connecticut at one of his shows. I had mentioned how excellent his rendition of “Everybody Here Wants You” was. Jeff Buckley would be honored!!\n\nI was so happy to be able to catch his show in ATL this Friday (the 7PM show). He started from way back with hits like “Simple Melody” on through to his latest two singles, “Understand” and “Priceless”. The crowd loved his remixes of his own music as well as touches of classic soul songs as an undercurrent to his soulful lyrics. He was personable and made several comments of how appreciative he was that his fan base has continued to hang with him for “20+ years”!\n\nMost important to note is the difference in his voice. He obviously has matured physically, but in the best possible way. He’s maintained his beautiful falsetto, but it’s not the main event of his singing anymore. He can hit those highs as well as settle into some beautiful lows all while belting it out over the amps and drums. Similar to a fine vintage wine, his voice blends together quite nicely i think!!\n\nNot to be forgotten were his band (a duo playing bass and drums) who seemed to know all his songs as well as him! They had their own swag but kept things tight. That made me smile because it seemed like everyone on stage thoroughly enjoyed themselves.\n\nGrowing up, I had a girl band and hung around with my brother’s band. I just loved chilling, enjoying music and playing music for hours. Jon B’s Atlanta City Winery show felt like nostalgic good old times. Like an up scale jam session in a sense. I think this is because he is his music and you can’t help but be cool and relax and enjoy a show by a musical genius!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nJonathan David Buck better known by his stage name Jon B has been working the live circuit for longer than most realise. This allows him a really great element of surprise for newer fans as he performs with the talent, understanding and demeanour of somebody who knows the ins and outs of both his live show and his music.\n\nThe blue eyed soul stylings of his music sound fantastic in an intimate venue and accompanied only by a select few musicians, the songs feel like they have been stripped back in a sense and actually shine without the high production values of his recorded work. There are a number of tracks selected from his commercially successful album 'Pleasures U Like' as well as his cult LP 'Cool Relax'. The fans cheer with intent for the likes of 'Don't Talk' and 'Now That I'm With You' and these songs appear to have aged incredibly well, almost like a fine wine. There is of course mass hysteria for the introduction of 'They Don't Know' which Jon strings out whilst he teases the anticipating fans. With a strong discography and even stronger live show, it will be interesting to see where Jon takes his sound next.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI see Jon B every time he comes over and this man never disappoints, Jon B is what I call a true “legend” he’s an underrated artist too and needs to be recognised for his great artistry within the RnB world.\n\nI got to meet him after the show had closed outside the venue along side his wife and all I can say is Jon B is the most down to earth, humble man/ artist I think I’ve met in a long time, there’s no heirs or graces about him, he’s real and straight up nice....it was like speaking with a regular friend... I told him I’m 10 days his señor and he went “damn black don’t crack” lol he can talk as he looks great too...Now this was not my first encounter with the legend but most definitely the best one and it’s a memory that will stay with me forever...\n\nThank you Jon B for always turning up and giving me a performance to remember and most importantly thank you for being real...your one of a kind❤️\n\n#Teamnovember# #Scorpio# #Fanforlife#\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI loved Jon B.! He was fabulous. My problem was the venue. This venue (Yoshi's in Oakland) is way too small and I cannot stand the seating. They cram everyone together at tables with strangers to where there is no intimacy/privacy in your conversation. The seats are uncomfortable, stage is too small. I really dislike this venue and it's a shame how the SF Bay Area has no better venues to bring these great performers for us. What happened to Yoshi's in SF?? Yoshi's in Oakland NEEDS A HUGE MAKEOVER!\n\nAgain, we loved Jon B. Always have and always will. He was great and did the best he could with what he had to work with. I'm so sorry he wasn't at a better place. I want to see him again if he comes to the SF Bay Area and gives us another chance. Maybe the PARAMOUNT in Oakland. OR, a winery?\n\nThank you Jon B. we love you!\n\n~ NOrozco\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
