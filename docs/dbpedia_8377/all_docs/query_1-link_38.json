        "text": "When did he get his start in music?\n\nMick Avory began his music career in the early 1960s. He initially played with various bands and was even briefly associated with the early lineup of The Rolling Stones.\n\nThe Kinks' 20 greatest songs, ranked\n\nAvory joined The Kinks in February 1964, alongside Ray and Dave Davies and Pete Quaife, shortly before the band achieved widespread fame with their hit 'You Really Got Me' later that year.\n\nWhen and why did he quit The Kinks?\n\nMick Avory left The Kinks in 1984.\n\nHis departure was primarily due to ongoing tensions with guitarist Dave Davies, which had been a source of conflict for many years.\n\nDespite being a key member of the band, the personal and professional disagreements, particularly with Davies, ultimately led to his decision to quit. After leaving The Kinks, Avory pursued other musical projects, including joining The Kast Off Kinks, a band formed by former Kinks members.\n\nWhere is Mick Avory now?\n\nThe Kast-Off Kinks with Ray Davies - You Really Got Me (The Dome, Boston Arms, 22/11/2015)\n\nIn March 2023, Avory dismissed rumours of a Kinks reunion, naming differences between the Davies brothers.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think it's possible now – one thing, health-wise. And I don't think we could ever work it out because Dave wanted to do it one way, and Ray wanted to do it the other – which was quite normal thinking for them.\n\n\"Ray thought [of] doing it as an 'evolution tour' – you have different people who came into the band and what songs they recorded on and what songs affected them.\n\n\"I thought that would be more interesting. But I think Dave just wanted 'a band' – not particularly with me in it. Just reform something like they had when I left – just a band with him and Ray in it, really.\"\n\nIn the mid-'90s, he and Dave Clarke started playing with The Kast Off Kinks, who have also connected with John Dalton, John Gosling, Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. He has performed with them ever since.\n\nAvory has also played in The '60s All Stars' band with British 1960s group members John Dee (The Foundations), Alan Lovell (The Swinging Blue Jeans), and Derek Mandell (The George Harrison Band)."
