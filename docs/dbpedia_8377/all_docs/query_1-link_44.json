        "text": "Not sure if it's a favourite moment, but for notoriety it has to be the time on stage in 1965 when Mick responded to an insult about his playing by lead guitarist Dave Davies by attacking him with a hi hat stand. Dave was knocked out and sent to Cardiff Hospital where he received 16 stitches to his head. Mick fled having thought he'd killed Dave. That was follow-up to a fist fight between them after the previous night's show where Dave ended up with two black eyes (memo: don't fight drummers.) It took over a fortnight of cancelled gigs before they got on stage again. There was a surprising amount of violence and chaos in The Kinks!\n\nHappy Birthday Mick.\n\nYES! very underrated. i saw him throw a tom at dave at the nassau coliseum in the late 70's. my first show was carnegie hall in 72 used for the showbiz album.\n\nI proposed that on concerts you’d have liked to have seen thread!\n\nWhat a night.\n\nI have had the pleasure of chatting to Mick in recent times. First thing I will say is that he is completely humble, and has zero ego considering his history. I would add that he had some hysterical anecdotes about the some of the his time with the Kinks.\n\nWhat I find really nice is still ongoing enthusiasm for playing drums live even if it’s not in high profile theatres and arenas.\n\nSo I hope Mick had the great birthday he deserves. He might not know it, but he’s a bloody legend!\n\nThe Kinks arrived in Hawaii on July 5, 1965 and played two shows the next day, one for soldiers at an Army base, followed by a nighttime arena show in Honolulu.\n\nThis photo was taken at the airport and was in the next day's newspaper.\n\n\"Holiday In Waikiki\"\n\nShel Talmy writes about the song here.\n\nHere they are in Los Angeles the week before.\n\nWhile in L.A. they did (mimed) performances for 4 different tv shows. It was at the last of these that the infamous \"altercation\" with some local workers happened, the one that resulted in a career-altering 4 year US ban by the AFTRA...\n\nThe final KINKS reunion, Nov. 2005 at the UK Music Hall of Fame.\n\nPete Quaife died in 2010.\n\nopen thread Pete Quaife (Kinks bassist) | Steve Hoffman Music Forums\n\nMick and John Dalton in 2018. Beginning in 1994, they've occasionally played together, along with John Gosling (RIP), in the \"Kast Off Kinks\".\n\nStill Flying The Flag For Kinks Fans - Mick Avory - Beat Magazine (beat-magazine.co.uk)\n\nEpisode 155: “Waterloo Sunset” by the Kinks – A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs\n\nThis is a very interesting and different kind of podcast series, recommended.\n\n@A well respected man"
