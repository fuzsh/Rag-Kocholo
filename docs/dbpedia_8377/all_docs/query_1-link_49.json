With two editions out so far it's allowed the surviving group members -- including brothers Ray and Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory -- to put hits, deep album track and unreleased material alongside each other and offer fans a different kind of perspective on the Kinks' four decades of recording, and may even inspire something new in the near future.",
