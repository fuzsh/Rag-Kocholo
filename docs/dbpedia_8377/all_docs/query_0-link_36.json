Tickets, priced at $40, are currently on sale; visit outpostintheburbs.org.\n\n(Feb. 7 Update: Chris Collingwood of Fountains of Wayne has been added as the opening act.)\n\nDavies, who will turn 71 on Feb. 3, recently participated in a concert paying tribute to the late Smithereens frontman Pat DiNizio at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank. Smithereens drummer Dennis Diken has been playing drums in Davies’ touring band for several years.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most influential rock guitarists, ever, Davies co-founded The Kinks with his brother Ray, bassist Pete Quaife and drummer Mick Avory in 1963. While Ray always handled most of the songwriting and lead vocals, Dave also penned and sang some of the band’s material, including “Death of a Clown,” “Strangers,” “Living on a Thin Line” and “Rats.” He has also been releasing singles on his own since the ’60s, and albums since 1980.\n\nRay and Dave have always had a rocky relationship. The Kinks have not been active since 1996, though reunions have occasionally been rumored since then."
