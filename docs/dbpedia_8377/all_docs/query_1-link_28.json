        "text": "Back in 2018, the Kinks’ Ray Davies told England’s Channel 4 News that after a 20-year feud, he was recording a “new Kinks record” with his brother Dave Davies and the band’s original drummer Mick Avory. In a new interview with The Rolling Stone, Dave said that lately, the group has been digging for songs to include on the 50th anniversary of Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire), out in October.\n\n“Some we recorded but never used,” Dave said of things they found in the archive. “Others don’t have finished vocals or they need other embellishments.”\n\n“The songs are really just in demo form now,” he continued, noting that he and Ray are recording some new songs while also finishing and re-recording the old ones. “But good demos. Ray is still dissecting various other material we might use. The intention is to get the work out, but it’s not a done deal.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nAvory drums on some some songs, while Bob Henrit, who played for the Kinks from 1984 to 1996, performs on others."
