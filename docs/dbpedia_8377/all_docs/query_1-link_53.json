        "text": "The Kinks have paid tribute to their former bandmate John Gosling after his death at the age of 75.\n\nBrothers Ray and Dave Davies formed the Kinks in the 1960s, with Gosling joining the band in 1970 as a keyboard player.\n\nThe Kinks announced the musician’s death in a statement posted to their social media page, which read: “We are deeply saddened by the news of the passing of John Gosling. We are sending our condolences to John’s wife and family.”\n\nLead vocalist Ray Davies paid tribute to his friend and former bandmate and said: “Condolences to his wife, Theresa, and family. Rest in peace dearest John.”\n\nThe band’s lead guitarist, Dave Davies, also offered his condolences, saying: “I’m dismayed, deeply upset by John Gosling’s passing.\n\n“He has been a friend and important contributor to the Kinks’ music during his time with us.\n\n“Deepest sympathies to his wife and family.\n\n“I will hold deep affection and love for him in my heart always. Great musician and a great man.”\n\nThe Kinks’ drummer, Mick Avory, said: “Today we lost a dear friend and colleague, he was a great musician and had a fantastic sense of humour … which made him a popular member of the band, he leaves us with some happy memories. God bless him …”\n\nGosling’s audition for the band was the recording session for Lola, a track which went to No 2 in the UK singles chart.\n\nThe musician joined the band five years on from the US tour which led the American Federation of Musicians to ban the Kinks from performing in the US for four years.\n\nGordon Edwards took over from Gosling on keyboards, before Ian Gibbons joined the band in 1979.\n\nIn 1994, Gosling became a founding member of the band the Kast Off Kinks, with former band members Avory, Jim Rodford and John Dalton.\n\nGosling stayed in the band until his retirement in 2008.\n\nThe Kinks achieved chart success with three No 1 singles in the UK: You Really Got Me, Sunny Afternoon and Tired of Waiting for You."
