Age Ageing. 2018. 47(1):48-55.\n\nPubMed • ClinicalTrials.gov\n\nClinical Question\n\nIn older adults admitted to hospital, does the use of haloperidol 1mg twice daily as compared to placebo prevent the development of delirium.\n\nBottom Line\n\nRoutine use of haloperidol in at-risk older-adult inpatients does not prevent delirium.\n\nMajor Points\n\nDelirium is a poorly understood condition, the pathoetiology is not clear and is a heterogeneous condition. When it does develop, it has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including increased cognitive decline, decreased independent living, and repeat admission) [1] With the pathoetiology poorly understood, preventative measures and targets for prophylaxis and treatment have been challenging to identify.\n\nThe Haloperidol versus placebo for delirium prevention in acutely hospitalized older at risk patients: a multi-centre double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial (HARPOON) randomized patient 70 years and older who were admitted to acute care for either medicine or surgery in one of 6 centres in the Netherlands. The patients were randomized to receive haloperidol 1mg orally twice daily or matched placebo. The trial did not find any statistical difference between groups in the prevention of delirium at 7 days. The trial also did not find any difference in secondary outcomes including duration of delirium, new institutionalism, hospital length of stay, or any adverse events.\n\nThere were several limitations with this trial, the main issue is that they did not reach target population (n=390) only randomizing 292 patients. Being underpowered it is unclear if there true is no difference between the two arms. One of the challenges the investigators faced was the screening including only patients that were at risk of delirium and that the screening tool was subjective. Data collection may have also been skewed as assessments did not occur at the guideline recommended frequency.\n\nCurrently pharmacologic preventative strategies have not been supported by previous research.[2] Multimodal interventions have been shown to decrease delirium, however, these approaches may not be robust and long lasting.[3]\n\nGuidelines\n\nClinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) in Adult Patients in the ICU, 2018, Adapted [4]:\n\nPrevention of Delirium: Recommend against the use of pharmacological agents (haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, ketamine) to prevent delirium (conditional recommendation, very low to low quality of evidence)\n\nDesign\n\nmulti-centre, double-blind, stratified, block randomised, placebo-controlled trial\n\nN=242\n\nHaloperidol (n=118)\n\nPlacebo (n=)124\n\nSetting: The Netherlands, 1 university and 5 teaching hospitals\n\nEnrollment: November 2012 - March 2015\n\nFollow-up: 6 months\n\nAnalysis: Intention-to-treat\n\nPrimary Outcome: Delirium within 7 days of initiation of study intervention\n\nPopulation\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\n≥70 years\n\nacute hospitalization through the emergency department (ED) *medical (gastroenterology, geriatrics, internal medicine, nephrology, pulmonology) or surgical specialty (colorectal-, general / trauma / vascular surgery, orthopaedics and urology) *at risk for delirium, defined as Dutch Safety Management Programme (Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem, VMS) delirium risk tool score ≥3\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nVMS 0\n\npatients not able to take study medication according to protocol\n\nspecific heart conditions:\n\nQTc interval > 500 ms, recent myocardial infarction, decompensated heart failure, second- or third-degree AV block, (history of) ventricular arrhythmias or Torsade de Pointes (TdP), uncorrected serum potassium level ≤3.0 mEq/L, clinical significant bradycardia\n\nconcomitant pharmacodynamically interacting medication\n\nuse of antipsychotic or dopaminergic drugs\n\nParkinson’s Disease\n\nVascular or Lewy Body Dementia\n\nHypokinetic Movement Disorder, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, Central Anticholinergic Syndrome\n\nsubstance abuse and dependence\n\nepilepsy\n\nnot competent to provide informed consent\n\nBaseline Characteristics\n\nDemographics: 55% female, mean 83 years old,\n\nPhysiologic parameters:\n\nAnthropomorphics: BMI 25.7 kg/m^2\n\nSocial: 44% independent, 37% home care, 17% institutional, 29% independent mobility, 32% hearing aids, 88% visual aids\n\nLabs: Albumin 35 g/L, creatinine 90 mol/L, CRP 35 mg/L, baseline QTc 438 ms\n\nPre-admission medications: 72% anticholinergic, 12% antidepressants, 5% antihistamines, 25% benzodiazepines, 12% Opioids\n\nInterventions\n\nHaloperidol 1mg PO BID at noon and 20h00 for 7 days\n\nPlacebo\n\nOutcomes\n\nComparisons are haloperidol vs. placebo.\n\nPrimary Outcomes\n\nDelirium incidence within 7 days\n\n19.5% vs. 14.5% (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.72-2.78) P = 0.302\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\nDelirium duration\n\n4 days vs. 3 days, P = 0.366\n\nHospital length of stay\n\n7 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.949\n\nMortality\n\n30 days - 5% vs. 7% (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.26-2.33) P = 0.649\n\n3 months - 10% vs. 13% (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.34-1.75) P = 0.534\n\n6 Months - 17% vs. 18% (OR 0.98 95% CI 0.49-2.00) P = 0.963\n\nDischarge disposition\n\nAs prior to admission - 44% vs. 43%\n\nAs prior with supports - 24% vs. 23%\n\nRehabilitation centre - 23% vs. 27%\n\nInstitution - 6% vs. 5%\n\nDeath - 4% vs. 3%\n\nICU Admission\n\n2.5% vs. 3.2% (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.17-3.57) P = 1.000\n\nAdverse Events\n\nAll Adverse events\n\n13% vs. 16% (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.40-1.67) P = 0.574\n\nQTc interval change\n\nno statistical difference between groups after 2, 6, or 12 doses\n\nCriticisms\n\nUnderpowered - did not reach target sample size\n\nscreening for VMS delirium risk score ≥1 may have led to selection bias since the tool uses subjective questions\n\nPatient assessment was not always conducted at the guideline recommended frequency\n\ncognitive impairment or dementia were excluded\n\nFunding\n\nnil"
