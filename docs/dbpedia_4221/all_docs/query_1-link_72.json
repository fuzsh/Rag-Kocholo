        "text": "Monday, June 1, 1942\n\nIn Germany... There is a bombing raid on Essen during the night (June 1-2) by 1036 RAF bombers. 35 fail to return. The success of the raid is questionable.\n\nFrom San Francisco... The aircraft carrier USS Saratoga sails after repairs from torpedo damage. It will be too late to take part in the coming battle at Midway.\n\nIn the Pacific... Twenty-five American submarines from various forces assume stations around Midway.\n\nTuesday, June 2, 1942\n\nOn the Eastern Front... The German bombardment of Sevastopol is renewed. German artillery gathered for the effort is comprised of 1300 guns, including the two 60cm \"Karl\" mortars and the 80cm \"Dora\" railway gun. The attack is supported by 7th Air Corps.\n\nIn North Africa... Battle of Bir Hacheim. The German 90th Light Infantry Division and the Italian Trieste Division, move south to take Bir Hacheim and free their flank. The units of Free French defending here continue to hold even after the 15th Panzer Division and heavy artillery is brought to bear.\n\nIn the Pacific... The US carriers from Pearl Harbor join northeast of Midway. In total, the American force has approximately 250 planes, equal to the number in the approaching Japanese force.\n\nFrom the United States... US Secretary of State Hull and Chinese Foreign Minister Soong sign a Lend-Lease agreement.\n\nIn the Aleutian Islands... Japanese Admiral Katuta's light carrier force attacks Dutch Harbor as a diversion. The Americans, aware of the Japanese plans for the invasion of Midway do not react as predicted.\n\nThursday, June 4, 1942\n\nIn the Pacific... The Battle of Midway. The Japanese initiate their assault on Midway Island with an air strike. The American defenders prove determined but ineffectual. However, Admiral Nagumo, commanding the Japanese forces, decides on the need for a second strike before landing the invasion troops. He is unaware of the US aircraft carriers in the area. By the time the Japanese realize the threat, it is too late. Torpedo bombers, from the American carriers, attack the Japanese carriers around 0930. Although they fail to do any damage, and suffer heavy losses, the Japanese defenses are disrupted by their strike. A second strike, by American dive bombers, arrives about 1030 -- at the same time that the Japanese carriers have completed reorganizing their strike priorities. Within minutes, the Japanese carriers Akagi, Kaga and Soryu are fatally hit, their decks loaded with aircraft ready to strike at the American carriers. The Hiryu launches a counter strike against the USS Yorktown which critically damages the American carrier. Late in the afternoon, aircraft from the Enterprise and Hornet strike the Hiryu, crippling it as well. All four of the Japanese carriers sustain damage which sinks or requires them to be scuttled within the next 24 hours.\n\nFriday, June 5, 1942\n\nIn North Africa... British forces begin attacks on Rommel's forces at the \"Cauldron\" (Rommel's defensive position backed by a minefield). The British 32nd Army Brigade is caught in the minefield and loses 60 of its 70 tanks. The British 22nd Armored Brigade loses communications with the infantry and artillery it is supporting, rendering them extremely vulnerable. The Axis forces will defeat these units in the course of the next two days.\n\nSaturday, June 6, 1942\n\nIn the Aleutian Islands... The Japanese land a small force on Kiska Island.\n\nIn the Pacific... The Battle of Midway. Admiral Yamamoto considers engaging in a surface battle against the US carrier fleet, but decides to retreat instead. The loss of the main portion of the Japanese carrier fleet and their aircraft pilots in the battle on June 4th has robbed the Japanese of the initiative in the naval battle in the Pacific. Also of importance is the use of code-breaking by the Americans to intercept Japanese planning. Prior knowledge of Japanese intentions at Midway allowed the Americans to prepare a trap.\n\nSunday, June 7, 1942\n\nOn the Eastern Front... Sevastopol is again the object of heavy fighting because of its importance as the main Soviet naval port on the Black Sea. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet is supplying the besieged city. The Sevastopol garrison is comprised of 7 infantry divisions and 3 marine brigades. These forces are badly under strength. The Germans are attacking with 9 divisions, two of them manned by their Romanian allies.\n\nIn the Aleutian Islands... The Japanese take Attu Island.\n\nIn the Pacific... USS Yorktown, damaged during the Battle of Midway, is sunk by a Japanese submarine.\n\nMonday, June 8, 1942\n\nIn Moscow... A full session of the Stavka is held to decide the fate of General Vlasov's 2nd Shock Army (encircled by German forces west of the Volkov). Stalin is quoted as saying: \"We made a great mistake joining the Volkhov to the Leningrad Front. Although General Khozin [the Front commander] is there on the Volkov, he has handled things badly. He has not carried out the Stavka's order about pulling the Second Shock Army back.\"\n\nTuesday, June 9, 1942\n\nIn Occupied Czechoslovakia... In reprisal for the assassination of Heydrich (on May 27th), the German authorities level the village of Lidice and kill its population. More than 100 Czechs have already been executed in retribution for the assassination.\n\nIn the Mediterranean... The air bombardment of Malta continues. An additional 32 Spitfires are flown to Malta to replace losses.\n\nFrom Washington... The British and Americans appoint Oliver Lyttleton and Donald Nelson as heads of the Combined Boards for Production and Food.\n\nWednesday, June 10, 1942\n\nIn North Africa... The Free French forces still hold Bir Hachiem against heavy attacks by Rommel's forces. During the night, 2700 of defenders are evacuated.\n\nAt the Panama Canal... The carrier USS Wasp and battleship USS North Carolina accompanied by cruisers and destroyers pass through the canal to join the US Pacific Fleet after service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. There are now four American fleet aircraft carriers in the Pacific theater.\n\nThursday, June 11, 1942\n\nIn North Africa... Rommel's forces break out of \"The Cauldron\" and begin attacks against the ridges between Knightsbridge and El Adem. British General Ritchie must engage Rommel's forces there as the bulk of the British infantry is still on the Gazala Line and the British bases outside Tobruk is now threatened.\n\nIn Washington... Soviet Ambassador Litvinov and US Secretary of State Hull sign an additional Lend-Lease agreement between the US and the USSR.\n\nIn the Mediterranean... Two major supply convoys to relieve Malta leave port. Admiral Curteis leads Operation Harpoon from Gibraltar; Admiral Vian, Operation Vigorous from Egypt. The Harpoon convoy consists of six merchant ships escorted by the British battleship Malaya, the carriers Eagle and Argus, four cruisers and 17 destroyers. The Vigorous convoy leaves Egypt with an escort forces of 8 cruisers and 11 destroyers to accompany the 11 merchant ships. Admiral Vian has received reinforcements from the British Eastern Fleet withdrawn from Ceylon.\n\nFriday, June 12, 1942\n\nIn North Africa... The British Guards Brigade is heavily attacked by Rommel's forces. The British counterattacks are ineffectual. One hundred British tanks are lost in the actions, leaving only 70 tanks operational. Rommel's forces have twice that number and withdrawal of the British forces is inevitable. The Germans are recovering many of their own damaged tanks, repairing them and putting them back into service.\n\nMonday, June 15, 1942\n\nIn North Africa... The South African infantry retreating from the Gazala line narrowly misses the German 5th Panzer Division which blocks the main road east of Tobruk. The 21st Panzer Division reaches Sidi Rezegh.\n\nIn the Mediterranean... The convoy from Gibraltar on its way to Malta (Operation Harpoon) continues with only a close escort of cruisers and destroyers. It is attacked by an Italian force and subjected to heavy air attacks as well. Two destroyers and three merchant ships are sunk. Only two merchant ships reach Malta. The convoy from Egypt fares no better; air attacks sink two destroyers and damage a cruiser. Of 11 merchants ships only 6 are still afloat. Word arrives of the approach of the Italian battleships Littorio and Vittorio Veneto escorted by destroyers and cruisers. Consequently, the convoy turns back to Egypt. Allied aircraft locate and damage the Littorio and an allied submarine sinks the Italian heavy cruiser Trento. Many of the Axis planes that are used in the action are from North Africa and their temporary withdrawal gives some respite to the British 8th Army in North Africa.\n\nFriday, June 19, 1942\n\nIn Washington... Churchill and Roosevelt confer. One of topics discussed are the plans for a Second Front. It has become clear that Operation Sledgehammer, the planned invasion of France will not be possible in 1942. Churchill proposes an attack on French North Africa instead. Also under discussion is the Atomic research program. It is agree that the Americans and British will share their information, but that the research should be concentrated in the United States rather than wartime Britain.\n\nSaturday, June 20, 1942\n\nOn the Eastern Front... Engaging in bitter street fighting with the Soviets, the Germans reach the harbor in Sevastopol.\n\nIn North Africa... Rommel's assault on Tobruk begins. His plan is to attack in the southeast with the German 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer Divisions and the Italian Ariete Division and drive through to the harbor. General Kesselring has sent all available bomber support from the Mediterranean. The attack begins with the bombing campaign in the morning and by early evening, German forces have reached the harbor.\n\nSunday, June 21, 1942\n\nIn North Africa... The garrison at Tobruk surrenders. 30,000 prisoners are taken by the Germans, but more importantly the huge storehouse of food and fuel fall into the German hands. More than 3,000,000 rations and 500,000 gallons of gasoline replenish the Afrika Korps meager supplies. Rommel requests and receives permission to continue the drive to Egypt over the objections of Kesselring who wishes to focus German forces on Malta with Operation Hercules.\n\nFrom Berlin... Hitler promotes General Rommel to Field Marshall in recognition of the successes of the Afrika Korps.\n\nIn Washington... Churchill receives the news of the fall of Tobruk while meeting with US President Roosevelt. FDR immediately offers aid and 300 Sherman tanks and 100 self-propelled guns are immediately dispatched to North Africa. The better equipment will make a difference in the British performance at El Amien.\n\nSaturday, June 27, 1942\n\nIn the Arctic... Convoy PQ-17 leaves Iceland for Archangel, consisting of 36 freighters and a tanker, escorted by 6 destroyers and 13 smaller ships. QP-13 consisting of 35 ships leaves Murmansk at the same time.\n\nIn North Africa... Despite heavy fighting the Allied forces at Mersa Matruh are forced to continue their withdrawal.\n\nSunday, June 28, 1942\n\nOn the Eastern Front... The main German summer offensive begins. General Bock's Army Group South drives east from Kursk to Voronezh.\n\nIn North Africa... Mersa Matron falls to the Axis forces led by Rommel and again a large quantity of stores and equipment fall into Axis hands. All the forces in the area, the British 8th Army and the German and Italian troops are heading back toward El Alamien. It is here that British General Auchinleck has decided to take a stand.\n\nIn the Atlantic... Elements of the British Home Fleet leaves Scapa Flow to provide distant escort for PQ-17. The escort includes two battleships HMS Duke of York and USS Washington and one carrier, HMS Victorious with cruisers and destroyers.\n\nMonday, June 29, 1942\n\nIn China... Chiang Kai-shek presents his Three Demands to General Stilwell: three US divisions before September, 500 combat planes, and a guaranteed monthly aerial supply of 5,000 tons. Chiang berates Stilwell, and hints that he might pull out of the war. Stilwell, as Chiang's chief of staff, is not responsible for procurement of supplies. The tension between the two grows.\n\nTuesday, June 30, 1942\n\nOn the Eastern Front... The Soviet High Command orders the evacuation of Sevastopol. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet, heavily damaged by the fighting attempts to remove the troops and equipment with little success.\n\nIn the Atlantic... The close cover escort for PQ-17 leaves Iceland. It is comprised of four cruisers, two American and three destroyers. The Germans sight but do not attack QP-13 out of Archangel."
