        "text": "On 19 February 2024, the Council of the European Union – via the Foreign Ministers of its member states – formally decided to launch Operation Aspides. The objective of the defensive maritime security operation is to safeguard freedom of navigation in view of the Red Sea crisis. The operation contributes to maritime security along the most important shipping routes in the operating area.\n\nWhat is the mission?\n\nThe European Union is stepping up its efforts to improve the security of vessels in the Red Sea and to protect the freedom of international shipping. The goal of Operation EUNAVFOREuropean Union Naval Forces Aspides (from Ancient Greek meaning “shields”) is to help protect ships on one of the most important international trade routes against attacks launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen. Germany has been participating in the operation since 23 February 2024, initially with the 124-class frigate Hessen. The frigate, with a crew of around 240, is particularly suitable for protecting ships against multidimensional attacks due to its extensive air defence capabilities.\n\nThe EUNAVFOREuropean Union Naval Forces Aspides staff and command personnel runs an operational headquarters with approximately 130 military personnel in Larissa, Greece – commanded by Commodore Vasileios Gryparis. The forward headquarters with approximately 30 personnel, also referred to as the Force Headquarters, is located on the naval force’s flagship within the maritime operating area.\n\nThe naval force is commanded by Italy’s Rear Admiral Stefano Costadino. In its first contingent, the naval force for Operation Aspides will comprise four frigates and one reconnaissance plane.\n\nWhich ocean areas does the operation cover?\n\nThe operating area of EUNAVFOREuropean Union Naval Forces Aspides comprises the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Strait of Hormuz as well as the international waters of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, as well as the airspace above these waters. Operations in territorial waters generally require the approval of the respective coastal states. This does not affect the rights of passage under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 or sea rescue operations.\n\nHowever, the operational protection mission concerning ships is limited by a line south of the port of Muscat in Oman. This also corresponds to the area of the current threat posed by attacks from the Houthi militia.\n\nThe extent of the operational area, including the Persian Gulf, will mainly facilitate cooperation and exchange for EUNAVFOREuropean Union Naval Forces Aspides with other international naval operations in the region. This particularly includes the USUnited States-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the multinational Combined Maritime Forces.\n\nWhat is the mission’s mandate?\n\nThe German Bundestag mandate is based on a decision of the Council of the European Union of 8 February 2024 as well as several resolutions of the United Nations Security Council (UNUnited Nations), in particular Resolution 2722 (2024). The Bundestag, Germany’s parliament, issued its mandate for the participation of the Bundeswehr on 23 February 2024. It is initially valid until 28 February 2025 and allows the deployment of up to 700 personnel.\n\nUNUnited Nations Security Council Resolution\n\nEU COUNCIL DECISION (PDF, 493.8 KB)\n\nGerman Bundestag Mandate (PDF, 166.6 KB)\n\nAs part of the EU’s Operation EUNAVFOREuropean Union Naval Forces Aspides, German armed forces are taking action under the rules of a mutual collective security system according to Article 24 (2) of the German Basic Law. Germany is participating in accordance with applicable international law, including customary international law and the right of self-defence against imminent or ongoing attacks on vessels in the operating area. In addition, the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 must be observed. Furthermore, Operation Aspides is acting in accordance with the UNUnited Nations Security Council Resolution of 10 January 2024, which calls for the Houthi militia to stop their attacks immediately.\n\nWhat is Germany’s contribution?"
