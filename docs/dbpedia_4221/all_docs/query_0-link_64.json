        "text": "August 10th-15th, 1942\n\nAfter the heavy losses of the battle of mid-June, the British continue supplying Malta only by plane or with the few tons of cargo that the legendary minelayer Welshman could deliver. In a new attempt to supply Malta with food and ammunitions, the British organized a new convoy of almost 60 American and British ships.\n\nR.N. Bolzano\n\nIn addition to the battleships Rodney and Nelson, the British deploy four aircraft carriers; the Eagle, Furious, Indomitable and the Victorious, the heavy cruisers Manchester, Nigeria and Kenya and the anti aircraft cruiser Cairo. Light cruisers and 25 destroyers provided protection for a convoy of 14 cargo ships, including three American. The convoy, mostly originating from Gibraltar, consolidates just south of the Baleary Islands where Italian and German submarines go to the attack, the later sinking the aircraft carrier Eagle.\n\nH.M.S. Eagle\n\nOn August 12, Axis air forces unleashed a massive attack which brought about the sinking of a cargo ship and other damage. Near Bizerte, just like it had happened during the Battle of Mid-June, the heavier escort turned back, leaving the defense of the convoy to 4 cruisers and 10 destroyers. On the evening of the 12th, two Italian submarines, the Dessie and the Axum, sink the cruiser Cairo and damage two cargo ships, the Ohio and Brisbane Start, and also damage the cruisers Nigeria and Kenia. This was a terrible blow which caused great chaos in the convoy. The same night, Italian motor boats sink the cruiser Manchester and 5 cargo ships. The following day, axis planes sink one more cargo ship.\n\nMissing from the battle were the Italian battleships which, by now, had reached one of the highest points of the fuel crisis. Supermarina, well aware of the limited supplies of fuel left scattered amongst the several Italian naval depots, decided to deploy only lighter units which included the 3rd Division with the Bolzano, Gorizia e Trieste and the 7th with the Eugenio di Savoia, Montecuccoli and Attendolo.\n\nThe Italian 7th cruiser Division\n\nThe Italian naval force was to have intervened near Pantelleria, but Supermarina was alarmed by the increased air defenses now based in Malta. At this point a quarrel between the Italian and German naval officers and their counterpart in the air force caused the naval forces to be relegated to a secondary role. The air force inability to provide for air coverage would have left the Italian ships to the mercy of the Malta bombers, so a return to port was ordered. While in transit in the Tyrrhenian, the cruisers Bolzano and Attendolo were attacked by a British submarine which scores two hits.The Bolzano, fearing a fire which was quickly reaching one of the magazines, was beached on the island of Panarea and was later rescued, while the Attendolo, having lost the entire bow, made it to port under its own engines.\n\nOn the 13th, of the original 14 ships, three reached Malta while the Ohio and the Brisbane Start followed unescorted several hours later. The British Admiralty quickly realized that operations of this scale were too costly and would not be repeated. On the Italian side, despite the stunning victory, the feeling of an imminent demise was beginning to sink in. The inability of the fleet to fully display its power and especially the inability of axis air force to provide for cover clearly demonstrated that the tide had turned. Ultimately, Malta was still alive while any hope to maintain North Africa was quickly fading away.\n\nOrder of Battle\n\nForce F\n\nConvoy WS.21S\n\nFreighters: MV Empire Hope, MV Dorset, MV Wairangi,MV Rochester Castle, Waimarama, Brisbane Star, MV Port Chalmers, Almeria Lykes, Santa Elisa, MV Clan Ferguson, MV Glenorchy, Melbourne Star, MV Deucalion\n\nOil tanker: Ohio\n\nDestroyer escort from Britain to Gibraltar: Keppel, Malcolm, Amazon, Venomous, Wolverine\n\nForce Z – heavy ships, returning to Gibraltar before entering enemy aircraft range\n\nBattleships\n\nNelson\n\nRodney\n\nAircraft carriers\n\nVictorious (6 Sea Hurricanes, 16 Fulmars, 12 Albacores)\n\nEagle (16 Sea Hurricanes)\n\nIndomitable (damaged) (10 Martlets, 24 Sea Hurricanes, 16 Albacores)\n\nTotal 74 fighters, 28 torpedo bombers\n\nLight cruisers\n\nCharybdis, Phoebe, Sirius\n\n19th Destroyer Flotilla\n\nLaforey, Lightning, Lookout, Quentin, Eskimo, Tartar, Wilton, Westcott, Wrestler, Somali, Wishart, Zetland, Ithuriel, Antelope, Vansittart\n\nForce X\n\n10th Cruiser Flotilla (light)\n\nNigeria (damaged), Kenya (damaged), Manchester (severely damaged and scuttled), Cairo (sunk)\n\n6th Destroyer Flotilla\n\nAshanti, Intrepid, Icarus, Foresight (severely damaged and scuttled), Fury, Derwent, Bramham, Bicester, Ledbury, Pathfinder, Penn\n\nOcean tug\n\nJaunty\n\nForce Y – two merchant ships with escort making overnight run from Malta to Gibraltar\n\nFreighters: Troilus, Orari\n\nDestroyers: Matchless, Badsworth\n\nForce R\n\nFleet oil tankers: RFA Brown Ranger, RFA Dingledale\n\nCorvettes\n\nJonquil, Spiraea, Geranium, Coltsfoot\n\nOcean tug\n\nSalvonia\n\nMalta Escort Force\n\n17th Minesweeping Flotilla\n\nHMS Speedy, Hythe, Hebe, Rye\n\nMotor launches: ML 121, ML 126, ML 134, ML 135, ML 168, ML 459, ML 469\n\n10th Submarine Flotilla\n\nSafari, Unbroken (off Milazzo and Palermo)\n\nUnited, HMS P222, HMS P31, HMS P34, HMS P46, Utmost (between Malta and Tunisia)\n\nOperation Bellows\n\nAircraft carrier\n\nFurious (38 Spitfires to 11 August)\n\nReserve Escort Group\n\nDestroyers\n\nKeppel, Westcott, Venomous, Malcolm, Wolverine, Amazon, Wrestler, Vidette\n\nOperation MG 3\n\nConvoy MW 12 (Port Said section)\n\n3 merchant vessels: 2 cruisers, 10 destroyers as escort\n\nConvoy MW 12 (Haifa section)\n\n1 Merchant vessel: 2 cruisers, 3 destroyers as escort\n\nOperation MG 4\n\nRhodes attack force\n\n2 cruisers, 4 destroyers\n\nAircraft operational on Malta\n\n9 fighter squadrons\n\n3 torpedo-bomber squadrons\n\n4 bomber squadrons\n\n2 reconnaissance squadrons\n\n38 Spitfires (ex-Furious) from 11 August\n\nItalian and German\n\nNaval forces\n\n3rd Cruiser Division (Messina)\n\nHeavy Cruisers\n\nGorizia, Bolzano, Trieste\n\nDestroyers\n\nAviere, Geniere, Camicia Nera, Legionario, Ascari, Corsaro, Grecale\n\n7th Cruiser Division (Cagliari)\n\nLight cruisers\n\nEugenio di Savoia, Raimondo Montecuccoli, Muzio Attendolo (severely damaged)\n\nDestroyers\n\nMaestrale, Vincenzo Gioberti, Alfredo Oriani, Fuciliere\n\nMinelaying\n\nLanzerotto Malocello (to mine Sicilian Narrows)\n\n8th Cruiser Division (Navarino)\n\nLight cruisers\n\nLuigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Emanuele Filiberto Duca d’Aosta\n\nDestroyers\n\n5\n\nSubmarines\n\nItalian\n\nBronzo, Ascianghi, Alagi, Dessiè, Avorio, Dandolo, Emo, Cobalto (sunk), Otaria, Axum, Asteria, Brin, Volframio, Granito, Dagabur (sunk), Giada (damaged), Uarsciek, Velella\n\nGerman\n\nU-73, U-205, U-333\n\nLight forces\n\n2nd MS Squadron\n\nMS 16, MS 22, MS 23, MS 25, MS 26, MS 31\n\n15th MAS Squadron\n\nMAS 549, MAS 543, MAS 548, MAS 563\n\n1\n\n8th MAS Squadron\n\nMAS 556, MAS 553, MAS 533, MAS 562, MAS 560\n\n20th MAS Squadron\n\nMAS 557, MAS 554, MAS 564, MAS 552\n\nS-boats\n\nS 30, S 59, S 58, S 36\n\nAircraft on Sicily and Sardinia\n\nRegia Aeronautica\n\n287th, 146th, 170th, 144th, 197th squadriglie (90 torpedo bombers, 62 bombers, 25 dive-bombers, 151 fighters)"
