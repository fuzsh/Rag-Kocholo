Sometime about midnight there had been E-boats buzzing around  everybody taking pot-shots at them very dark port 0.5 inch gunner shouts out  Sir, an E-boat alongside port side, cant depress my guns enough to open fire .. then a voice from the E-boat alongside Please, its only us, your ML (one of the six minesweeping motor launches)  everybody takes us for an E-boat and this is the only safe place.\n\n1.

Commander, R.D., R.N.R.\n\n18th June 1942\n\n___________________________\n\nExtract from letter to Secretary of Admiralty dated 8th July 1942:\n\n\"HEBE\" has since been docked and in the course of clearing the damaged compartments a large fragment has been discovered which in the opinion of the Bomb Safety Officer is from a 1000 Kilo German A.P. Bomb. As a stick of bombs is recorded as having fallen close to the ship about the time of the explosion it is highly probable that the damage was caused by a bomb exploding just below the surface and not by a mine.\n\nSigned K. H. L. Mackenzie\n\nADMIRAL SUPERINTENDENT, MALTA.\n\nH.M.S. HEBE - HULL DAMAGE\n\n(Report of the Manager, Constructive Dept:)\n\nHoled port side approximately 24' x 16' with centre of explosion at approximately 24-25 Station 8 feet above keel. Flat keel and bottom plating port side buckled and distorted from 18 to 31 Bulkheads and to approximately 3 feet above L.W.L., together with all adjacent frames and longitudinals. Flat and vertical keels buckled upwards to a maximum of 2\" between 22 and 30 stations.....\n\n...All bottle racks in 4\" Magazine distorted and crushed and all fittings in Central Stores, Upper and Lower, S.A. Magazine and CO2 Machinery Room require renewal. All W.T. Doors and hatches 18 - 31 require renewal or repair.....\n\nHeebie Jeebies\n\nHer name in Grecian Goddess' terms\n\nImplies in myth she can restore\n\nOld sailors to the bloom of youth-\n\nA human treasure lost in war.\n\nBut sailors whom I'd known at home\n\nWhen telling me about their ship,\n\nSighed, \"Hebe's just a minesweeper\n\nDeployed on any forlorn trip.\"\n\n\"We came to Malta days ago\n\nWhen convoy 'Harpoon' almost failed,\n\nWith only two ships getting through\n\nOut of a laden six that sailed.\n\nBut Malta is no 'Journey's End'\n\nAnd sailors still on board agree,\n\nThe Hebe is no better off-\n\nIn harbour than she is at sea.\"\n\n\"She lies beneath a screen of smoke\n\nObscured from German bombing raids,\n\nBut every time the cloud bank drifts-\n\nHer chance of preservation fades:\n\nSince Hebe is the trapped quarry\n\nOf a U-Boat and Stuka chase;\n\nAnd Malta's future obviously-\n\nIs hopeless as a naval base\".\n\nWhile the Hebe was in Malta my father (Bill Taylor) bumped into an old friend, John Snook, who was in the R.A.F., and it seems that occasionally they would reminisce about days gone by. John a retired teacher, published his own poems under the publisher's name of Koons and in his book Malta Siege Verse 1941/1942/1943 he wrote a poem entitled Heebie Jeebies.\n\nIn a prologue to this poem he wrote\n\n\"I knew two sailors who came to Malta on board H.M.S. Hebe escorting the remains of a convoy code named 'Harpoon' which reached the island in June 1942. While in Grand Harbour, with two merchantmen that had also survived the voyage, the Hebe was almost enveloped by a smoke screen.\n\nAfter meritorious service mine sweeping and escorting Mediterranean convoys for months in most hazardous waters, Hebe was sunk by enemy action in the Adriatic Sea off Bari. Over thirty members of her crew were lost including one of the sailors I knew. The other man survived and when I met him recently he was enjoying a happy retirement in the little west of England town where he and I were born.\"\n\nJohn was a lovely old chap and in 1990, the year of publication, signed a copy of the book for my father \"To Bill Taylor. 'Survivor of the Hebe'.\n\nSadly both have now died, my father in May 1999 and John in the summer of 2005.\n\nSource: Rob Taylor, son of Bill Taylor, Stoker HMS Hebe\n\nLife for the men of the minesweepers at Malta was, like that for all at Malta, service or civilian, hard and dangerous. Food was severely rationed. Stan Jaques (on HMS Rye) has recalled life at that time...\n\n....\"rations were so low that when we were sweeping we were allowed to draw a couple of tins of steak extra for the ships company, and this was a real luxury. There were no crockery replacements and so we had to toss up for the empty jam-jar which became available now and again. Another facet of life was that the crews of the minesweepers were to be formed into Defence Platoons, in case Malta was invaded. They even tried Pongoes (soldiers) giving us drill, but they had to give this up as a bad job as their drill was different to ours and it always ended up as a shambles. There were always runs ashore, but it was usually the case of Jack (the sailors) and the troops organising themselves with football and water polo etc. And always the noise of aircraft and bombs\".....\n\nThe ships of the 17th MSF continued their routine of daily sweeping at the same time as the enemy attempted to keep the channels closed with fresh minelaying at night."
