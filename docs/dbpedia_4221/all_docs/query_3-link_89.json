        "text": "*EPF504 06/28/2002\n\nFact Sheet: Coalition Contributions to the War on Terrorism\n\n(DOD update includes contributions by new countries) (5540)\n\nThe Defense Department, in an updated and revised fact sheet, says U.S. coalition partners are contributing more than 8,000 troops to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul.\n\nThe fact sheet lists new contributions to the war against terrorism that have been made by partners such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine as well as additional contributions by countries listed in the previous fact sheet issued on June 7.\n\nThe Defense Department says this compilation is not meant to be all-inclusive, but to \"give a sense of the important role played by the coalition of coalitions in the global war on terrorism.\" The fact sheet is being updated monthly.\n\nFollowing is the text of the June 7 Defense Department fact sheet, as revised on June 14:\n\n(begin fact sheet)\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nOffice of Public Affairs\n\nFact Sheet\n\nJune 7, 2002\n\n(Revised June 14, 2002)\n\nInternational Contributions to the War Against Terrorism\n\nCoalition partners from across globe are fighting against evil of terrorism.\n\nThe terrorism of September 11th was not just an attack on the United States, it was an attack on the world. Citizens from more than 80 countries died that day -- innocent men, women and children from across the globe. Within hours of the tragedy, coalitions involving many nations assembled to fight terrorism -- literally hundreds of countries have contributed in a variety of ways -- some militarily, others diplomatically, economically and financially. Some nations have helped openly, others prefer not to disclose their contributions.\n\nThe United States began building the military coalition on September 12, 2001, and there are currently 69 nations supporting the global war on terrorism. To date, 20 nations have deployed more than 16,000 troops to the U.S. Central Command's region of responsibility. This coalition of the willing is working hard every day to defeat terrorism, wherever it may exist.\n\nIn Afghanistan alone, our coalition partners are contributing more than 8,000 troops to Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF] and to the International Security Assistance Force [ISAF] in Kabul -- making up more than half of the 15,000 non-Afghan forces in Afghanistan. The war against terrorism is a broad-based effort that will take time. Every nation has different circumstances and will participate in different ways. This mission and future missions will require a series of coalitions ready to take on the challenges and assume the risks associated with such an operation.\n\nBelow is a partial list of military contributions to the war on terrorism from some of the countries that have lent their support.
