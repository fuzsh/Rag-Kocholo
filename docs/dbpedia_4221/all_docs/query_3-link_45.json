        "text": "The best weapons to use in a kayak were darts and harpoons. Bows were easily damaged when wet and were best left for hunting on land. Many harpoons included a throwing stick that increased the range and force. At the end of the line was often an inflated bladder that kept the line afloat and tired the targeted animal."
