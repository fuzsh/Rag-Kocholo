        "text": "Some observations on Harpoon Missiles.\n\nI've been toying around with cable attachments on my missiles to winch in aircraft and I wanted to share a couple things i've learned.\n\n1. When you hit an enemy craft with a harpoon missile, your craft will be dragged by the force of the craft on the other end. In some cases, my craft ended up being pulled out of the water completely. Adding additional winches seemed to curb this. More winches attached to my system seemed to increase the force enemies were being pulled in with.\n\n2. Cable components for the missiles only contain 200m of cable per block. So, if you're trying to harpoon targets that are greater than 200m away, you need more cable components. This is only really a problem if you're trying to hit fast moving targets since you must give up fins and other components designed to counter speed.\n\n3. Harpoon missiles deal no damage to targets hit by them. In fact, it's really easy to damage yourself if your target is being pulled in quickly and you're cables dont release soon enough. You can adjust the cable-detach range by interacting with winches. Once your target is reeled in, your other weapon systems will have to finish it off.\n\nAnyone with more Harpoon experience care to weigh in? There seems to be a scarcity of information on this weapon system."
