It provides a detailed breakdown of each column of the Critical Hit Table, using a D100 roll instead of a D20. Each ship type has a separate page, and details of each casualty are included. This is a straight implementation of the Harpoon V rules, with the exception of two changes that (as of March 2021) will be incorporated in the next upload of the rules, and an unofficial “house rule” that provides an alternate scheme for ships built during the CaS era (before 1955).\n\nTattletail is an introductory scenario for the Harpoon V game system. Set in 1991, Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) is being shadowed by a Russian destroyer during a time of rising tensions between Russia and NATO. At the start of the scenario, the Russian vessel receives orders to attack.\n\nForm 10s with complete data on all ships and aircraft are provided in the supplement.\n\nUpdated 10AUG2024\n\nGDW's Harpoon SITREP was published quarterly between January 1989 to January 1994. Each issue provided a mix of scenarios, articles on naval warfare and technology, and statistics on weapons systems. All this was designed to support the very active Harpoon miniatures gaming community, and was supported by them. Most of the bylines in each issue were of players who wanted to share a new idea, or their expertise, about a part of the game.\n\nThe issues are long out of print, but demand for back issues has been steady, and photocopies of the old issues are steady sellers.\n\nAfter four editions of Harpoon and twelve years, a lot of the articles are dated, but there is still a lot of good information - general pieces on naval warfare, book reviews, and scenarios. This book gathers together the best of those issues in one place.\n\nWhile a few of the articles have been updated, most are untouched. We've limited changes to replacing or improving graphics, using current statistics, and removing any inconsistencies with current rules. These are peripheral issues and in no case was the content of the article changed.\n\nWhen formulating their strategies, the world's navies always plan to put their best forces in position to deal with any problem. However, reality rarely cooperates with these plans and naval forces often find themselves faced with situations for which they are not be prepared.\n\nFrom hypothetical Cold War actions to current encounters and potential future conflicts, Harpoon Naval Review 2003 provides scenarios that let you explore how ad hoc naval groups deal with these situations. It also presents scenarios and articles covering naval items of interest from around the world; with ship and aircraft forms for the scenarios.\n\nHarpoon Naval Review 2003 contains articles on Australia's Navy in the 21st Century, The Chinese Navy, A Tour of a Project 641 [Foxtrot] Class submarine, Optional Variable Damage Rules, Weapon Arcs vs. Director Arcs, and nine scenarios.\n\nModern Naval technology is evolving at a rapid pace and the potential for conflict on the world's seas is as high as ever, creating scenarios, both real and hypothetical, that can be played out with the Harpoon game system.\n\nHarpoon Naval Review 2009 comes with 49 ship and 52 aircraft forms, all updated with the latest standardized Admiralty Trilogy information, scenarios, after-action reports, and more.\n\nDance of the Vampires is a combination scenario book/after-action report of several wargames that were played during the writing of the military thriller Red Storm Rising, by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond. The book’s story-line had been roughed out and the high point of the first act was to be regimental-sized Backfire strike on a NATO carrier battle group. This was something the Soviets talked about a lot, and NATO worried about just as much. It was decided that the best way to explore the possibilities was by using Harpoon to game out the attack. This product describes the Harpoon games that were developed to explore this scenario, including the forces involved and narrative accounts of what happened the three times the game was played. This edition also includes a write-up of the Keflavik Turkey Shoot, the scenario that spawned the idea of that having the Soviets invade Iceland was necessary. This invasion formed one of the key plotlines of the novel.\n\nHigh Tide, 2nd edition is a scenario supplement for the tactical naval miniatures game Harpoon V.\n\nIt is is a collection of scenarios covering the Cold War naval confrontation between the US/NATO and the USSR/Warsaw Pact at the end of the 1980s, when both navies were at their peak of power.\n\nFirst released by Clash of Arms in 2003, it has been updated using twenty years of new history, as well as converting it to be compatible with Harpoon V.\n\nIn addition to scenarios and historical sidebars, it has annex data for non-US, UK, or Russia countries (already covered in ATG's Navies series annex books) in NATO and the Warsaw Pact, such as France, Italy, East Germany, and Poland. Only those \"rest of the world\" ships that are required for the scenarios are included, but all the data for their weapons and sensors is included.\n\nThis supplement includes 187 Form 10s from 162 ship classes and 84 aircraft Form 20s that appear in scenarios of High Tide, Second Edition, a supplement for Harpoon, Fifth Edition.\n\nHigh Tide is a collection of scenarios covering the naval confrontation between the US/NATO and the USSR/Warsaw Pact at the end 1980s, when both navies were at their peak of power. In addition to scenarios and historical sidebars, it has annex data for non-US, UK, or Russia (already covered in our Navies series annex books) countries in NATO and the Warsaw Pact, such as France, Italy, East Germany, and Poland. Only those \"rest of the world (RoW)\" ships that are required for the scenarios are included, but all the annex data is there.\n\nThe Forms book has Form 10s (ships) and Form 20s (aircraft) for ALL the ships and planes called out by the scenarios - US, UK, Russian, Italian, FRG and DDR, whatever. Each form includes not only information on the ship or aircraft's characteristics, but all their sensors and weapons.\n\nSouth Atlantic War, Third Edition is an in-depth treatment of the naval and air campaign during the Falkland/Malvinas Islands War of 1982. It contains nineteen scenarios, linked with narratives of the land actions, putting them in context.\n\nSupplementary material includes complete orders of battle, command organizations, and a list of ships and aircraft lost during the conflict.\n\nThe book uses a wealth of information from recently published references, both British and Argentine, that add valuable insights and dispel common myths.\n\nSouth Atlantic War III includes the second edition foreword by the late Admiral Sir John “Sandy” Woodward and a new foreword from noted author Mariano Sciaroni.\n\nPersian Incursion explores the political and military effects of an Israeli air campaign against Iran to prevent them from building a nuclear weapon. It uses rules adapted from Harpoon to resolve the military action. But its goal is to look beyond the military action by modeling the political and intelligence actions and consequences of a potential political conflict by including a card-based political component to the game.\n\nThe game allows one player to take the role of the Israeli leadership and armed forces, while the other becomes the Iranian leadership and its armed forces. The Israelis will attempt to use air strikes, commando attacks, and political tactics to force the Iranians to abandon their nuclear weapons development program. The Iranian air defenses are badly overmatched, and they must depend on other asymmetric means to counter the Israelis: Ballistic missiles, terror attacks, and political persuasion."
