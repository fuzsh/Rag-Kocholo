        "text": "375kHarpoon was the U.S. Navy's answer to the massive Soviet force of anti-ship missile ships.\n\nBegun under the FY68 program as a 50nm anti-ship missile, suitable for air platforms but by 1970 extended to ship launch, to increase US anti-ship missile firepower to make up for the declining strength of the carrier force.\n\nAs procured it did not require a dedicated launcher although in many cases one was provided.\n\nIt did not materially reduce shipboard resources already provided for major naval missions such as antiair and antisubmarine warfare.\n\nThe canister launcher avoids intrusion into AAW and ASW weapon capacity at a relatively low cost in ship space and weight.\n\nRequests for quotation were issued in January 1971, a prime contractor (McDonnell Douglas) being selected that June, without flyoff, given the cost and urgency of the program.\n\nThe first missile flew in February 1972. Technical evaluation was completed in June 1975, delayed by some extent by small system problems; however, Harpoon was operationally evaluated in 1977, production beginning that year.\n\nIt was envisaged at first as an air and surface-ship weapon, but also replaced the proposed submarine missile, STAM studies of an encapsulated version for torpedo tube launch began in 1972.\n\nDuring her reactivation, Iowa received the RGM-84 Harpoon cruise missile system that gave the ship a long-range strike capability against surface targets.\n\nTwo complete Harpoon systems, consisting of four Mk.141 launchers with sixteen RGM-84 missiles were fitted to the ship, each Mk.141 launcher holding a cluster of four All-Up-Round (AURs) in ceramic armoured canister launchers.\n\nThe missiles were stored and fired from the canisters at a fixed angle. The ship evaluated contacts, Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) tracked and used electronic support measures (ESM) data to decide whether to fire.\n\nESM supported defensive threat warning, long-range situation awareness and over-the-horizon targeting (OTH-T) for cruise missiles and tactical air strikes.\n\nMicrowave ESM looked at the external characteristics of foreign radar signals such as radio frequency and pulse-repetition frequency intercepts and were an extremely important source for identifying hostile activity and were likely to be the first and often only means to classify an enemy unit such as a submarine beyond sonar range.\n\nMicrowave ESM could detect foreign surface radar signals at 45-60 miles and some air search radar signals at 80 nautical miles.\n\nPlanning a fight through displays of combat information is essential to victory.\n\nNTDS was vital for keeping accurate tracks of contacts to avoid \"blue-on-blue\" disasters.\n\nIt enabled the ship to manage combat more effectively.\n\nIt had automatic input of navigation (LORAN) fixes, the pit log (for speed), gyrocompass and anemometer.\n\nThe ship's CIC used Command and Decision System (CDS) computers' contact data to prioritized contacts by threat and designated weapons systems to specific targets.\n\nNTDS-equipped ships in the operation passed these contacts data to each other over the Link-11 radio data link network.\n\nEach NTDS ship transmitted contact data as computer display symbols showing the target type (surface, air, submarine), target identity if known and identity of the ship or aircraft tracking it.\n\nOne ship, the network controller, polled the other NTDS ships in turn.\n\nA polled ship's NTDS computer automatically broadcasted updated contact data on all tracks for which that ship was responsible.\n\nAll NTDS ships in the network recorded the track data broadcasts.\n\nASW and radar sentry AWACS) aircraft participated in the NTDS data network.\n\nThe SH-2F Seasprite helicopter proved highly useful for antiship surveillance and targeting missions but could report sightings only by UHF voice radio.\n\nThe newer SH-6oB Seahawk helicopters transmitted contact data as NTDS computer symbols over a point-to-point pencil beam data link to the ship.\n\nThe ship broadcasted this information to the rest of the force in her Link-11 broadcasts.\n\nNTDS ships relayed track data over radio-teletype circuits to non-NTDS ships to help them find targets. (Link-14)\n\nThe ship programmed the missile from the Harpoon control console in the CIC to fly out on a given bearing toward a target and optionally gave the missile a minimum or expected range to the target.\n\nEarly Harpoon missiles had a range of about 60 miles and made an almost straight-in approach to the target with an optional pop-up-and-dive maneuver to dodge target defenses.\n\nHarpoon could be fired at an ESM contact when the ship had her radar off for stealth or when the target was over the radar horizon.\n\nThe Harpoon missile seeker would attack the first target it found on the assigned bearing beyond the seeker turn-on range.\n\nHarpoon was an offensive weapon in coastal operations.\n\nStrike warfare missions were national strategic tasks.\n\nAn important side effect of this strategic capability was the institutional rise of the surface warfare officer community within the Navy.\n\nThe surface launched RGM-84 used the same airframe body as the air launched version plus a booster.\n\nThe Harpoon has five component sections in all:\n\nGuidance Section - used active guidance.\n\nWarhead Section - was composed of 510 pounds including 215 pounds Destex HE.\n\nPropulsion Section - was composed of a liquid fuelled turbojet engine for cruise and attack flights.\n\nBobtail Section - housed actuator fins which controlled the flight after booster separation.\n\nBooster Section - solid propellant propelled missile away from ship.\n\nWhen fired, the booster propelled the missile away from the ship approximately 5 miles and was discarded. The dropoff zone for the discarded booster section was about 1 Â½ miles.\n\nThe turbojet engine propelled the missile from the booster separation to the target.\n\nThe stabilizing and actuator fins were stored folded in the canister and sprang out into position after launching.\n\nDuring the flight the actuator fins received inputs from the guidance system directing the missile to target.\n\nThe firing weight of the RGM-84 Harpoon was 1,530 pounds, which includes a booster weight of about 362 pounds. It had a cruising speed of 0.87 Mach.\n\nThe maximum range was 64.5 nm in Range and Bearing Launch (RBL) mode and 85.5 nm in Bearing Only Launch (BOL) mode.

instead, it was reserved to retaliate against Soviet bases in the event that Soviet forces attacked U.S.naval forces with nuclear weapons.\n\nThe ship programmed the over-water flight path for the missile to a designated landfall, where the missile would orient itself by matching actual terrain contours (TERCOM) with a stored digital map.\n\nFrom the landfall the missile flew a course at very low altitude around enemy defenses and terrain obstacles.\n\nIt updated its position en route by TERCOM - the initial contour-matching fields were larger so that the missile could better orient itself.\n\nWhen the on-board guidance system computed that the missile had arrived at the target, the warhead detonated.\n\nTomahawk Mission Planning Centers ashore programmed nuclear-warhead Tomahawk missions.\n\nBefore launch, the ship could reassign the aim point under a flexible target option (FLEX) to attack an updated target position, such as a target that was discovered to have relocated or to have survived an earlier attack.\n\n(TLAM-C)\n\nThe best-known Tomahawk version is the conventional-warhead land-attack missile.\n\nEarly TERCOM-guided block II-A TLAM-C missiles were used against Iraq in 1991 and 1993.\n\nEach carried a 1,000-pound high-explosive semi-armor-piercing conventional warhead.\n\nIt became operational in March 1986.\n\nIts warhead was taken from the old Bullpup air-to-ground missile.\n\nThe weight of this warhead reduced the fuel load for the conventional-warhead Tomahawk, so that its range was about half that of the nuclear-warhead version (700 vs. 1,300 nautical miles).\n\nStrike route planning was the same as for the nuclear version, except that the conventional version used digital scene-matching area correlation (DSMAC) for terminal guidance.\n\nOn approach to the target, the missile photographed the area and matched the scene with a stored digital image for final course adjustment toward the specific target.\n\nStrike planners choose landmarks that were not themselves targets, since these would be less likely to be demolished during early strikes.\n\nTomahawk flew straight into the target (point detonating fuze), exploded at a programmed point over it, or popped up and dove on it to evade terminal defenses.\n\nIn 1993 Iraqi air defense forces observed that Tomahawk rolled over before diving on targets.\n\nTomahawk TLAM-D carried 166 bomblets to scatter over airfields, buildings or other soft targets during its flight.\n\nIt could attack multiple targets during one mission and detonated at the last target.\n\nSince the success of the Tomahawk strikes on Iraq, national military commanders have kept Tomahawk-equipped ships foreward-deployed for contingencies.\n\nThe presence of Tomahawk-equipped ships enables aircraft carriers to depart an area without leaving potential aggressors uncovered.\n\nBlock III and IV Tomahawk had a Global positioning System (GPS) receiver and a time-of-arrival control to synchronize strikes with each other and with air strikes. They all had a land-attack capability and their missions could be planned quickly in theatre aboard aircraft carriers and command ships. Since they could be aimed quickly, they could strike time-urgent targets.\n\nTASM\n\nIn November 1972 design began for the Tomahawk anti-ship missile.\n\nIt carried the same 1,000-pound high-explosive semi-armor-piercing warhead as the conventional land-attack Tomahawk.\n\nIt could penetrate a submarine's pressure hull or a large warship's hull plating.\n\nOriginally it was planned for a range of 140 nautical miles, which was adequate for underwater launch, since submarines find targets by sonar and are invulnerable to hostile cruise missiles during approach to target.\n\nSurface warships needed a longer-range weapon to attack Soviet warships, which could fire their anti-ship missiles from 250 nautical miles.\n\nSurface search radars cannot be used for long-range anti-ship targeting (over-the-horizon targeting) because of their inherent horizon-limited range, about 2Â50 miles.\n\nThe challenge was not to build a 250-nautical-mile-range missile but to plan a targeting system for it.\n\nCritics doubted that a task group would fire weapons over the horizon at targets that task group sensors could not locate, since the probability of missing the targets would seem to be high, making an over-the-horizon attack an act of unilateral disarmament.\n\nThe same critics accepted that the large Soviet anti-ship cruise missiles were threats from 250 nautical miles' range. Rear Admiral Walter Locke, the cruise missile project officer, asked the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the Harpoon seeker contractor, McDonnell Douglas, to investigate whether a Tomahawk could search for a target inside an area of uncertainty.\n\nReplacing the Tomahawk anti-ship missile turbojet with the costlier land-attack Tomahawk turbofan engine could increase TASM range to over 300 nautical miles to allow the missile to fly search patterns. In 1975 the applied Physics Laboratory developed search patterns so that the Tomahawk anti-ship missile was capable of autonomous scouting and strike missions.\n\nThe next problem was how to get surveillance information to the launching ship for over-the-horizon targeting.\n\nOpponents within OSD refused to authorize funds for research into over-the-horizon targeting, but the Naval Electronics Systems Command funded an experiment called Outlaw Shark.\n\nFor this experiment, a computer database was set up at the Submarine Operational Command Center in Naples, Italy and another computer was installed aboard a submarine.\n\nThe Naples Outlaw Shark system copied operational intelligence data being collected for later transmission to a Sixth Fleet aircraft carrier, condensed the data and relayed it without delay to the submarine over a computer-to-computer encrypted radio data link.\n\nSometimes the submarine received intelligence data only six minutes after the occurrence of the event being described. The submarine's computer correlated the intelligence data with its own contact data and prepared search patterns adequate for an immediate Tomahawk anti-ship attack.\n\nIn December 1976 the submarine used this system to generate search patterns for actual ships not held by its own sensors.\n\nAnalyses showed that the search patterns would result in Tomahawk hits on those ships.\n\nThe first test of a Tomahawk anti-ship missile was a launch at a target hulk 224 nautical miles away.\n\nThe Tomahawk flew 175 nautical miles to the target and began searching.\n\nIt then flew 173 nautical miles in search patterns and found the target.\n\nThis was the first long-range anti-ship cruise missile flight not to use a data link between the missile and a controller.\n\nTomahawk anti-ship missiles became operational in 1982.\n\nIn contrast to the procedure for early Tomahawk land-attack missiles, for the anti-ship mission the ship controlled all targeting and planned the entire strike mission.\n\nTomahawk weapons control systems were SWG-2 for armoured box launchers and SWG-3 for vertical launch systems.\n\nEach provided track Â and launch control functions.\n\nThe ship used the launch-control group to track the status of the Tomahawk missiles and to fire them.\n\nThe Tomahawk anti-ship missile used the Harpoon active radar guidance section with a passive seeker for identification and direction finding.\n\nThe missile classified and prioritized targets to attack the most valuable target.\n\nAs with Harpoon, Tomahawk anti-ship missiles could fly dogleg courses so that they could attack from unexpected directions and in such a way that missiles from one or more ships arrived on target simultaneously.\n\nThe ship kept a database of surface ships in her assigned patrol area on the track-control group computer.\n\nIn the initial Tomahawk weapons control system, each ship kept her own track database.\n\nWith newer versions, one ship was the force over-the-horizon track coordinator (FOTC) for a task group.\n\nTrack data came from the ship's own sensors, NTDS data links and intelligence sources.\n\nGeneral surveillance information came from surveillance satellites and aircraft, from SOSUS and from shore-based (Outboard) radio direction finding.\n\nEach ship's Tomahawk weapon control system was linked to tactical information exchange satellite radio broadcasts (TADIXS and OTCIXS) over the ship's radios.\n\nA newer system, JOTS, recorded data from OTCIXS and TADIXS broadcasts and maintained a local picture as seen by off-ship sensors.\n\nJOTS used commercial computers and was entirely passive.\n\nThe ship could get into Tomahawk range without revealing her presence to the target.\n\nA Tomahawk anti-ship missile could be fired as a \"wake-up call\" or \"screaming meemie\" towards a radio-silent enemy battle group.\n\nIt the enemy ships would switch on their radars to target the actively searching Tomahawk, a follow-on strike could exploit the newly available locating information.\n\nSpruance class destroyers and Ticonderoga class cruisers can use their long-range passive towed-array sonar to locate targets over the horizon.\n\nSubmarines have long used the same tactic.
