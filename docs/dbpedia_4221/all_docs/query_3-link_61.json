        "text": "The United States is going through a major modernization effort, ensuring America can succeed and thrive in this new digital arena, providing an exceptional opportunity for companies to build market share while making a positive impact. In an effort to showcase new and interesting commercial technologies to the federal community, the SDI team is hosting a technology demo competition. The SDI Showcase and Ignite Awards aim to recognize and celebrate the most groundbreaking technologies and solutions throughout the space and defense sectors. The online portion of the competition will take place on Valid Eval’s secure online evaluation platform. Companies will compete based on company size and sector, resulting in two finalists from each category being selected. Finalists will face off in a live demo competition, with the winners being crowned during the Space and Defense Innovation VIP Party, held on March 9, 2024, in Austin, TX, during SXSW. The competition focuses on six of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense's OUSD(R&E) critical technology categories: Integrated Sensing and Cyber Space Technology Human-Machine Interfaces AI and Autonomy Renewable Energy Generation and Storage Quantum Science Wildcard category There is no cost to apply, and there are some great benefits, including prize packages, awards, and recognition in front of industry leaders. With that said, the real benefit is the ability for companies to get meaningful feedback from an audience of acquisitions and innovation leaders throughout the federal government. Applicants will also be shared with federal programs that are looking for technology, opening new opportunities for growth and commercialization after the competition. The demo event will be part of the SDI Showcase and VIP Reception on March 9, 2024, during SXSW. In its third year, we are expanding the invite-only VIP Reception to include a demo competition.

The conversation focused on NATO’s top five challenges highlighted within the Atlantic Council’s 2023 publication, The Future of NATO C4ISR. NATO’s challenges are not unique: · Share more data and intelligence; · transform digitally; · implement new concepts, policies, and plans to clarify C4ISR requirements; · modernize, augment, and acquire capabilities to meet new C4ISR requirements; and · continue to invest in C4ISR interoperability, readiness, resilience, innovation, and adaptation. When asked, “Where do I see an opportunity for collaboration?” I responded that the most incredible opportunity resides in the commercial space. We can learn much from how our allies utilize the commercial space to support their national strategic security goals. C4ISR is about sensors and sense-making, and no national security apparatus can compete with the ubiquitous array of commercially available sensors. Defense Strategies Institute and Emily A. Pandis, thank you for the opportunity."
