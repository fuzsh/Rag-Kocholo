        "text": "Six Barksdale Airmen took part in the U.S. Navy's longest-running annual joint exercise, UNITAS, April 29 at the Jacksonville Operational Areas off of the coast of Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nIn this year's exercise entitled UNITAS Gold, Barksdale was invited to participate in the sinking of the ex-USS Connolly.\n\nUNITAS Gold joined militaries from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay not only to train, but to also promote naval security and solidarity in the region. For almost 50 years, UNITAS has served as the primary naval security engagement exercise amongst the militaries of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe first exercise, named UNITAS 1, was launched in 1960 with 48 ships from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and the United States.\n\nUNITAS Gold called for more than 25 ships, four submarines, more than 50 aircraft, 650 Marines and 6,000 Sailors from 11 different countries to participate in the sinking of the ex-USS Connolly.\n\nUNITAS Gold's purpose was to increase interoperability among participating Navies and in doing so, the exercise allowed the assembled forces to organize and conduct combined naval operations in a multinational task force, and test its responsiveness.\n\n\"Through the years, UNITAS has evolved to fit the landscape, needs and mutual naval and maritime interests of the Americas and Caribbean,\" said Navy Rear Adm. Joseph Kernan, commander of the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command and U.S. Fourth Fleet. \"[UNITAS] has persistently provided a training and interoperability platform for partnered nations and provided great benefit to United States and Latin American Sailors, Marines, Naval Infantry and Coast Guard forces.\n\n\"Participating maritime services make UNITAS the success that it is today, bringing with them the ideas and best practices for maritime strategy and security from their countries,\" he continued.\n\nThe two-week exercise, designed to feature realistic training scenarios for all participants, included live-fire exercises, undersea warfare, shipboard operations, maritime interdiction operations, anti-air and anti-surface warfare, amphibious operations, electronic warfare, and special warfare.\n\nAlthough the exercise lasted 14 days, Barksdale's involvement called for only one day of activity to help sink the ex-USS Connolly. B-52 crews from Barksdale and Minot Air Force Base, N.D, were invited to unload their weapons as the last attack to sink the retired vessel.\n\nBarksdale and Minot's involvement was scheduled as phase eight of nine phases. The B-52s were going to be the final attack on the ex-USS Connolly to sink the ship. The first weapon struck the vessel around 8:30 a.m.\n\nUpon arrival to the site around 3 p.m., the six Barksdale members aboard a B-52, call sign \"DOOM 94,\" were informed the ship was already sinking. More than 1,600 weapons ranging from harpoons to rockets tore into the vessel.\n\n\"We saw the ship through the targeting pod, and when we came back on the last leg we were prepared to bomb,\" said Capt. Colby Platner, 96th Bomb Squadron chief of strategic plans. \"As we came up on the ship to unload our weapons, all we saw was debris and smoke.\"\n\nThe sinking of USS Connolly was set up for servicemembers involved to take a turn hitting the ship.\n\n\"Other militaries and branches were hitting the Connelly with their weapons before us, so there was a possibility it could sink by the time we arrived,\" said Capt. John Cornett, 2d Operation Support Squadron operations group training plan flight commander. \"Although we had to retain our weapons, it was a great exercise - we still got a lot out of it. Barksdale worked with our Navy counterparts to complete the mission and we took away a joint operation integrations experience from this exercise.\"\n\nAfter flying for more than seven hours and covering 2,500 nautical miles, the Louisiana-based crew returned to Barksdale.\n\n\"Although being there prepared to bomb and then seeing our target go down before we were able to accomplish what we train to do was frustrating, we understand training exercises don't always go as planned,\" said Captain Platner. \"It was still great training because it's the way we deploy-- not only working with sister services but with allies as well. Anytime we get to work with another branch is a great learning experience.\"\n\n* Some information for this story was obtained from a UNITAS Gold press release."
