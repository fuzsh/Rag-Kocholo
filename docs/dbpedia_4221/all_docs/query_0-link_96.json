At 236 pages long including various appendices, the book is fairly short, but this in no way detracts from its appeal to the casual reader or usefulness to serious students of the Second World War. The text is engagingly written and rich in both technical detail and eyewitness accounts by the participants. Most of the latter are drawn from the Allied perspective, but much attention has been paid to putting across the experiences and tactical issues faced by the Germans and Italians as well. While the main portion of the book deals with the complex narrative of Pedestal, due attention is given to the strategic context and the place of these events in the wider war in Europe. Unfortunately, the narrative is occasionally disrupted by minor spelling mistakes which, while not serious, can cause momentary confusion by changing the meaning of a sentence. For example, the phrase 'access the damage' occurs once when it should read 'assess the damage'.\n\nThe book is well illustrated throughout with photographs, maps and convoy formation diagrams. As added 'chrome', the chapter and section headings boast attractive and accurate profile illustrations of some of the ships involved in Pedestal: the merchant vessel drawings are reminiscent of those found in Duncan Haws' Merchant Fleets series and the warships adapted illustrations from Jane's Fighting Ships. The bibliography is very impressive and comprises a good mix of primary and secondary sources. The entries here are clear and consistent and are a valuable resource for anyone wishing to conduct further research on this subject.\n\nThe introduction and first two chapters provide a detailed background to the fighting in the Mediterranean theatre, and the particular importance of Malta as a strategic asset for the British. The problems of keeping the island base supplied in the face of Axis air superiority are analysed, as is British planning for Pedestal and Axis preparations to attack the convoy. Chapter two comprises an assessment of the Allied merchant ships chosen to participate, along with some of the escorting warships. This section goes into a fair amount of technical detail, including a discussion of the merits of the tanker Ohio's design with reference to a simplified general arrangement plan of the ship (17). Impressively, the text does not become bogged down in jargon and presents no difficulties for readers unfamiliar with ship technology.\n\nChapters 3–11 comprise the main narrative part of the book. These cover the departure of the convoy from the Clyde on 2 August up to the arrival of the last straggler, the tanker Ohio, at Malta on 15 August. The progress of the convoy and the intense series of air and sea attacks it endured are dealt with in detail, with dates and times given in GMT for clarity. The two convoy formation plans and four route maps really come into their own here, and are well placed to support the narrative of the events. Not unexpectedly, the experiences of some ships are covered in more detail than others, and this seems in part due to the variable availability of information and source material. With regard to the final stage of the convoy's journey after 12 August, the events that befell some of these ships (particularly the stragglers) form important milestones in the narrative and thus merit the closer attention given them by the author. Chapter 11 concludes with the reception of the cargo at Malta and of the men who delivered it, and perhaps fittingly closes by describing the final disposal of the doughty Ohio in 1946.\n\nContrary to expectation, the last two chapters of the book do not contain a 'sum up' of the success of the 'Pedestal' convoy. This is not strictly necessary as the subject is dealt with earlier in the book. The arrangement of these chapters is however a little odd. The subjects of Chapters 12 and 13 are, respectively, the controversial trial of Captain Drew of HMS Manchester and the narrative of the return of the escort ships of Force X to Gibraltar after seeing the bulk of the 'Pedestal' convoy safely into Malta. The fact that the events described in Chapter 12 took place months after those in Chapter 13 somewhat upset the narrative flow, and it would probably been better had 'The Long Run Home' appeared before 'Travesties of Justice' in the text.\n\nThe appendices show an impressive depth of research, and greatly enhance the book's usefulness. The topics covered by include Rolls of Honour for both Allied and Axis personnel, general information and potted histories of the participating merchant ships, honours and awards issued to Allied personnel, orders of battle for both sides, brief biographies of key personnel and details of contemporary parallel operations to name but a few.\n\nThe author's stated reasons for embarking on this publication aside, it is clear that this work is a labour of love and the product of intensive research. In Operation Pedestal, Brian Crabb has achieved a very good balance between detail and readability, and despite some very minor issues with the text, this book is highly recommended to anyone with the interest in the Second World War operations in the Mediterranean theatre in general, or the Pedestal convoy in particular.\n\nAndrew Choong Han Lin\n\nNational Maritime Museum\n\nAchoong@rmg.co.uk\n\n© 2015.

In 'Operation Pedestal'(Shaun Tyas, £24, hardback) Brian James Crabb starts with an account of operational planning that went into marrying thirteen cargo ships and a tanker with the most powerful of escort forces ever assembled by the British (and with aircraft carriers as an integral part). The Axis powers threw everything they could at Pedestal and nine merchant ships were sunk, along with three naval vessels (including the veteran carrier HMS Eagle). Six warships were crippled (including the carrier HMS Indomitable). Only four cargo ships and the tanker Ohio made it to Grand Harbour. Yet, despite this level of damage, the effort was worth it, as Malta - and the naval forces operating from it - remained a thorn in the side of the Germans as their grip on North Africa loosened. Attempting to subdue the brave little island was a serious drain on Axis forces. Through dedicated and exhaustive research, in 'Operation Pedestal' Crabb provides details on anything and everything important in the telling of this story. While impressive, there is a danger so many layers of information become overwhelming and get in the way of the story. For instance, when given information on attacking aircraft, we would perhaps like to know whether its German or Italian, what type, and possibly (in broad Geographic terms) from where it has flown. Do we really need to know the squadron, where the airfield is located, and even the name and rank of the pilot? However, in this respect the book is perhaps aimed at the avid information-gathering enthusiast, a researcher, or even aviation artist. The narrative forms 156 pages, while the generous appendices are contained in a further 67, including the names of those killed in action (very fitting) and a list of enemy vessels sunk and damaged by Malta-based British submarines between January 1941 and May 1942 (not strictly necessary). Best of all are the vivid eyewitness accounts that run throughout 'Operation Pedestal'. Summarising the gravity of losses from Axis attacks on the convoy - too early in the narrative is an error, removing a vital ingredient of suspense. Crabb concludes his 'Pedestal' account with a chapter on the Admiralty-held Courts of Enquiry that were convened afterwards. Here, for the record, Crabb settles some injustices with regard to the loss of HMS Manchester and HMS Sussex, something that he is to be highly commended for. There are many excellent photographs in the book (plus other illustrations. not least some very tidy ship profiles by the author). For the serious naval enthusiast this book offers a deeply satisfying high level of detail, mixed in with well-chosen and skillfully used eyewitness contributions; a fitting tribute to one of the key British convoy victories of World War Two.\n\nIf you only read one book about Operation Pedestal make sure it is this one.\n\nMark Hirst\n\n15 January 2015\n\nLetter written to Brian James Crabb by Alan S. Mallett and received on 31 December 2014:\n\n'I write to congratulate you on your book 'Operation Pedestal', which I recently acquired. I think the printing and production generally is First Class, and you have clearly done a vast amount of research into the operation which shines forth right the way through. Your biggest problem will be surpassing it in your next book!'\n\nReview on Amazon Books website:\n\nI first heard of Operation Pedestal in April 1951, immediately before my eleventh birthday, when I was lucky enough to travel 14 days from Cape Town to Southampton on board RMS Pretoria Castle, commanded by Captain Richard Wren DSO. Wren rapidly became aware of my interest in shipping and Union-Castle Line and not only allowed me access to the bridge but gave me a very full account of Rochester Castle's participation in Pedestal, indeed that was where I learnt a number of new words of which my parents did not approve!\n\nThis story has fascinated me ever since and Brian Crabb has done a fantastic job of research into the origins, execution, and outcome of this epic operation. Quite the best of the many books I have read on the subject over the years.\n\nThe presentation is excellent, the writing flows and is easily read, the illustrations are comprehensive and the ultimate fate of the surviving ships is covered. As a Union-Castle fan I might have been disappointed that Wren, his ship and crew perhaps did not receive the cover of some of the others, but on reading the whole this disappointment does not stand up, for Brian has, rightly, concentrated on the far greater challenges that so many of the others, especially those that did not survive, and of course of Ohio, had to face.\n\nThis book is a well balanced account of Operation Pedestal, and I commend it to everyone. I count myself privileged to have met Captain Wren, and to have learnt of the valour which he and his crew, and indeed his colleagues in the other 13 merchant ships, the Royal Navy and Fleet Air Arm exercised in this key battle.

THIS BOOK SHOULD BE THE DEFINITIVE HISTORY OF 'OPERATION PEDESTAL.'\n\nby Steven Watts - December 2014.\n\nOPERATION PEDESTAL\n\nThe Story of Convoy WS21S - August 1942 by Brian James Crabb\n\nThis book reveals the true story of Operation 'Pedestal' a convoy that had to get through to Malta, which was undergoing severe rationing at the time and was the key to the battle for the Mediterranean and North Africa.\n\nThirteen modern cargo ships and the new American oil tanker Ohio were selected for their speed, size and reliability. On the second day of entry into Mare Nostrum the aircraft carrier Eagle was struck by four torpedoes and sunk within eight minutes by U 73, followed by crippling damage to Indomitable from the air the following day, reducing the Allied air cover by half. The convoy was repeatedly attacked by aircraft, submarines and E-boats, resulting in the loss of the cruisers Cairo and Manchester and the destroyer Foresight. Nine of the cargo ships were sunk, while six naval vessels were put out of action for differing periods of time. However, despite the determined efforts by Axis' forces Port Chalmers, Rochester Castle and Melbourne Star reached Malta on 13 August. The following day Captain Riley, who had nursed his ship Brisbane Star along the African coast alone after torpedo damage to her bows, made a solo dash from Sfax and also arrived successfully with a sizeable cargo. Meanwhile, the precious tanker Ohio which had been torpedoed and bombed to a standstill, was eventually towed, nursed and coaxed into Valletta's Grand Harbour on the 15th, against all odds. Her voyage is legendary and Captain Dudley Mason was deservedly awarded the George Cross for his action.\n\nMany brave men were lost during this heroic and most bombarded convoy of the Second World War; awards were numerous, including another brave act by a crew member of HMS Ledbury who dived into the burning sea to rescue a young man who had survived the sinking of Waimarama; he was awarded the Albert Medal, an equivalent to the George Cross. All are recorded at the back of this book. There is also a comprehensive list of those lost in 'Pedestal', although the sizeable list of Axis personnel lost is incomplete, due to sensitivity over access.\n\nCased hardback (full-colour, laminated), x + 262 pages, with 107 illustrations, appendices, index etc., 252 x 192 mm.\n\nThis beautiful new book has been available from 1 April 2014. The actual cost of the book is £24, plus postage, depending on where in the world you live. All copies supplied by the author can be signed and dedicated.\n\nThe current postage cost (2nd Class) within the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands is £3.49p.\n\nEnquiries can be made by email: briancrabb@talktalk.net or, if you are having problems with the email address above, please use:\n\nbustercrabb548@gmail.com\n\nor by telephone: 01275 844229 (or 00441275844229 from abroad) or mobile number: 07811582082.\n\nSo, you might ask yourself, what is the difference between buying this book from Amazon or, anywhere else, on other websites. The answer is quite simple: When ordered from the author, your copy will be personally signed, dedicated to whoever you want; and, if requested, have the 'Letter of Proceedings' for any Royal or Merchant Navy ship involved in this famous convoy added free of charge with any order.\n\nSuggestion: Bite the bullet: Because this book is selling very fast and will not be reprinted.

But the Merchant Navy certainly has not been forgotten by the history books. Many a month sees a new wartime narrative arrive at the Telegraph offices, and this time the topic is Operation Pedestal, the convoy to relieve the stricken island of Malta in 1942.\n\nAuthor Brian Crabb is a former Merchant Navy engineer, and his father Percival 'Buster' Crabb took part in Operation Pedestal as a Royal Navy stoker. Having found that research into the Second World War helped him to feel closer to his late father, Brian took up historical writing twenty-two years ago, and for his fifth book he has turned to the Allies' gruelling effort to bring lifesaving supplies through some of the heaviest bombardment of the war.\n\nNine years in the researching and writing, Operation Pedestal is very thorough, with background information, blow-by-blow accounts of events, witness testimonies and dramatic photographs. Appendices record those lost on both sides, as well as listing the honours awarded for bravery, and giving technical information such as ship particulars.\n\nIt's a book which would probably best be enjoyed by Second World War history buffs rather than newcomers to the subject, but that is not a criticism, this is a grown-up history telling a painful and heroic story in the detail it deserves.\n\nby Andrew Linington\n\n[By far, the best account written so far about this famous convoy - RDC].\n\nSea Breezes\n\nChristmas Bookshop\n\nNovember 2014\n\nBook of the Month\n\nOperation Pedestal\n\nThe Story of Convoy WS21S in August 1942\n\nby\n\nBrian James Crabb\n\nOperation Pedestal was a British operation to get desperately needed supplies to the island of Malta in August 1942, during the Second World War. Malta was the base from which surface ships, submarines and aircraft attacked Axis convoys carrying essential supplies to the Italian and German armies in North Africa. In 1941-42 Malta was effectively under siege, blockaded by Axis and naval forces. To sustain Malta, the United Kingdom had to get convoys through at all costs. This book reveals the true story of Operation Pedestal. Many brave men were lost during this heroic convoy of the Second World War; awards were numerous, and all are recorded at the back of the book. A riveting read that throws fresh light on this, the most bombarded convoy of all of the Second World War. Hardback, 262 pages and illustrated with black & white photographs.\n\nBristol Times – 23 September 2014\n\nHow Malta was saved from being starved into surrender\n\nOperation Pedestal\n\nIf you don't know what Operation Pedestal was, then you might at least have seen the 1953 film The Malta Story starring Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins.\n\nThe film used real footage of the German and Italian air attacks on the island, which the Axis powers were desperate to seize as it was an important base for British air and naval operations in the Mediterranean.\n\nAs the Axis campaign went on, the island was bombed mercilessly, and supplies of everything from food and fuel to medicines ran low.\n\nAs local author Brian Crabb writes: 'From 2 April to 10 May 1942 ... Nearly 7,000 tons of bombs were dropped in and around the city and harbour of Valletta ... At times the island's airstrips resembled the surface of the moon, festooned with craters from the constant bombardment. Over 10,000 houses were demolished, the island's reservoirs were destroyed and many food stores and gun emplacements flattened. Valletta's harbour was soon in total disarray; most of the cranes and installations were battered beyond repair, while wharfs were gutted and most of the surrounding warehouses reduced to rubble. Ships lay damaged or sunk in the harbour.'\n\nIn August 1942, Britain made a desperate attempt to lift the siege by despatching a convoy of 14 fast, reliable, modern cargo ships with a huge escort of Royal Naval vessels. The convoy would in fact be covered by two naval forces, comprising in total two battleships, three aircraft carriers, seven cruisers and more than 30 destroyers.\n\nThis was Operation Pedestal, and while the Alec Guinness movie concentrates on the plight of Malta and its garrison and islanders, the story of the convoy remains one of the most remarkable episodes of the entire Second World War.\n\nThe convoy and its escorts were pounded relentlessly by German and Italian aircraft, dropping bombs and mines. They were also attacked by submarines and torpedo boats. The only thing that stopped it being any worse was the fact that the ships of Mussolini's blustering 'tin pot' regime were desperately short on fuel, so the Italian navy could not venture out in anything like the force it could have mustered.\n\nBy any conventional standards, Operation Pedestal was a disaster. Shortly after it entered the Mediterranean the Carrier Eagle was sunk by a U-boat. The carrier Indomitable was forced to withdraw by bomb damage the next day, drastically reducing the air cover available to the convoy. There were further naval losses, and nine of the cargo ships were lost.\n\nBut the pay-off was that five of the merchant ships got through, most famously the American-built tanker Ohio, which was painstakingly towed into Valletta even though she was only being kept afloat by Royal Naval vessels lashed to her.\n\nFor the disastrous losses in ships and men, Malta had been saved from being starved into surrender. British aircraft were now there in sufficient numbers to protect the island from air attack, and in the longer term Malta was secure as a base to stop the Italian and German armies in North Africa being supplied. Without Operation Pedestal, victory at El Alamein might not have been achievable.\n\nThe whole story is told in meticulous detail by Brian Crabb in a new book, which came out a few months ago, Operation Pedestal: The Story of Convoy WS21S.\n\nThe book has taken him nine years to research, and all that hard work certainly shows. If you are interested in the most minute technical specifics about the ships and aircraft involved on both sides, it's all there.\n\nThat, for most readers though, will probably not be the point. This is above all a tale of triumph in the most demanding circumstances, and for some reason one which doesn't seem to get as much attention in popular memory of the Second World War as it deserves.\n\nMr Crabb has done as much work on the human side of the story as he has on the machines, producing where possible eyewitness accounts (the story of how destroyer HMS Ledbury rescued men from a burning sea, and then went on to nurse Ohio safely into Valletta is the stuff of legend) and even court proceedings.\n\nBetween all this, and a huge number of contemporary photographs and later paintings, it's probably safe to say that this book will be the last word on this incredible and heroic episode for many years, and probably decades, to come.\n\nOperation Pedestal: The Story of Convoy WS21S is available from the author Brian Crabb, 24 Exeter Road, Portishead, Bristol, BS20 6YF; telephone: 01275 844229 or email: briancrabb@talktalk.net\n\nor, if you are having problems with the email address above, please use:\n\nbustercrabb548@gmail.com\n\nThe price is £24.00 plus £3.49p 2nd Class postage in the United Kingdom.\n\nReview by Eugene Byrne\n\nSHIPPING – Today & Yesterday\n\nBook Review\n\nNovember 2014\n\nOperation Pedestal.

It was the most amazing sight to see all these people, who had suffered so much, cheering us.' These were the words of Lieutenant-Commander Roger Hill the captain of the destroyer HMS Ledbury as the survivors of Convoy WS21S limped towards Malta's Grand Harbour. It was, he said, the happiest day of his life. He had helped bring succour to the beleaguered little island.\n\nOther than the ill-fated PQ17, this was probably the most famous convoy of the Second World War. The story of WS21S has every element one could wish; dogged determination, horror, pathos and the final triumphant finale. Its drama is matched by its scale. To protect the fourteen merchant ships taking essential supplies to the Mediterranean island, the Royal Navy committed four aircraft carriers, two battleships, seven light cruisers, and thirty-two destroyers. Of these, one of the aircraft carriers was sunk during the operation as were two light cruisers and one destroyer. Three other warships were damaged.\n\nThough the naval ships came under heavy and repeated attack from on, above and below the surface, it was the merchant ships that were the principle targets of the Axis aircraft and vessels. Only five of those fourteen reached Malta. Those ships took 29,000 tons of general cargo into the Grand Harbour along with petrol, oil fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel. It meant that the island's defenders could continue to fight and the Maltese could continue to support them. Yet it was only enough to last for little more than two months – but it was enough, just enough.\n\nBrian Crabb tells this tale well. He opens his account of Operation Pedestal with a detailed examination of the planning undertaken. The most dangerous part of the journey from Gibraltar to Malta was the stretch of water between Sicily and Tunisia, known as the Narrows. There were only two possible routes through this dangerous area, both between Sicily and Cape Bon on the Tunisian coast, divided by the small island of Pantelleria. The best chance of passing through this perilous area in the time available was during the moonless period between 10 and 16 August. With Malta on the verge of collapse, if the convoy could not get through in August, there would be no other opportunity. Almost every available resource was therefore committed to the operation. Speed was obviously another major factor and the merchant ships selected for the convoy had to all be capable of at least fifteen knots. The most important of these ships was the oil tanker Ohio. Her sister ship Kentucky had been sunk on the previous attempt to take fuel to Malta in Operation Harpoon. This left just Ohio as the only fast, modern tanker in service. It was simply a case that if Ohio did not reach Malta, the island would run out of fuel. The significance of this was that it would mean the end of its operations against Axis shipping crossing the Mediterranean taking supplies and equipment to Rommel in North Africa. The consequences of failure were almost incalculable.\n\nBrian Crabb details all the ships involved in WS21S, the journey down to Gibraltar, and gives an exciting account of the desperate race through the Mediterranean, highlighted with accounts from those that took part. It is, as I have said, a story with every element one could wish for and laid out in fine style in this excellent book.\n\nReviewed by John Greham\n\nPublisher: Shaun Tyas\n\nISBN: 978-1-907730-19-1\n\nHardback. 262 pages\n\nRRP: £24.00\n\nCopies can be ordered direct from the author.

Co-incidentally I also had the June copy of 'Britain At War' magazine which includes the article 'Rough Justice' to hand – my brother and I share it and it had only recently been passed to me. This Court Martial of Captain Drew always rankled my Uncle, who was one of the torpedomen who set the scuttling charges and subsequently ended up in Vichy hands - he thought Drew been very unfairly treated. I seem to recollect that HMS Manchester had been dived on in recent years and the damage she sustained, reviewed, resulting in a vindication of Drew's actions – sadly too late for him to be aware of it.\n\nMay I ask if I may use the splendid diagrammatic maps as illustrations in the talk I'm preparing with suitable accreditation of course. I would not dream of doing so without your agreement.\n\nMy kind regards\n\nDavid Slade\n\nReader's Reviews continued:\n\nMeticulously Researched Blow by Blow Account:\n\nOperation Pedestal is the most detailed account that I have read about the vital but costly convoy that relieved the siege of Malta in August 1942. Brian Crabb's meticulous research gives an almost minute by minute account of the action, complemented by descriptions of the process of putting together the convoy and the aftermath of inquiries and courts martial resulting from the losses of RN warships, notably the cruiser HMS Manchester.\n\nAs in his other books, Brian Crabb is very concerned to cover the human aspects of war at sea with many personal recollections and anecdotes from people who took part in the action. He also includes a comprehensive roll of honour of all those lost on the allied side and, as far as possible, the axis too.\n\nThe book is lavishly illustrated with informative captions accompanying every photograph, map or line drawing. I was particularly interested to see pictures of HMS Indomitable noting the large forward lift that enabled her to strike down (store below deck) Sea Hurricanes, unlike her sister carrier HMS Victorious, which also took part in Operation Pedestal. This is a great read for anyone interested in World War Two at sea.\n\nReview written by Clive Owen, ex- Army Major (31 August 2014 - re: Amazon Books website).\n\nBook Reviews and Reports:\n\nNorth Somerset Times 14 May 2014 - Report by Tracey Fowler\n\nNaval historian writes book on Dad's convoy\n\nA Portishead writer has seen nine years hard work come to fruition.\n\nOperation Pedestal, by retired garage owner Brian Crabb, has recently been published revealing the true story of a 1942 Malta-bound convoy, which was vital for getting supplies to feed and fuel the island.\n\nIt involved one of the largest naval escorts of the Second World War, splitting essential goods between 13 fast cargo ships to increase the chances of them reaching their destination [with a percentage of the cargo].\n\nNine of the merchant ships were sunk en route, along with an aircraft carrier, two cruisers and a destroyer, the remainder [including the American oil tanker Ohio] completed the journey.\n\nBrian's interest in convoy WS21S is fuelled by the fact his dad, Percival, served in HMS Kenya, one of the ships that escorted the convoy.\n\nThe author researched all the names of the Allied and Axis' men lost and compiled a list of all the honours and awards that were given, details of which can be found on his website.\n\nThis beautifully illustrated hardback book is available from the author at a cost of £25 [and can be delivered by the author, providing the address is local] by emailing briancrabb@talktalk.net or for more details visit www.briancrabbmaritimebooks.co.uk or telephone: 01275 844229 or 07811582082\n\nTo view report in the North Somerset Times' website go to:\n\nwww.northsomersettimes.co.uk/.../book/_charts_disaster_stricken_convoy_1_3598778\n\nNAVY NEWS\n\nJuly 2014\n\nBook Review\n\nHeroes on all sides in Malta epic\n\nMost convoy battles are faceless, nameless affairs in endless, forbidding stretches of ocean.\n\nBut Convoy WS21S has passed into history – albeit under the code name for the operation, Pedestal. The story has been told many times over the years. But there is still plenty of new material to be found, even after more than seven decades.\n\nBrian Crabb's father served as a stoker on board HMS Kenya (the cruiser was torpedoed but survived), prompting his interest in the battle of August 1942. But Operation Pedestal: The Story of Convoy WS21S (Shaun Tyas, £24 ISBN 978-1-907730-191) isn't a memoir or an autobiography. It's a very comprehensive, detailed and heavily illustrated account, based on wide-ranging research in The National Archives, with a heavy input from the Italians (whose role in the Mediterranean is often underplayed in favour of the Germans), as well as the Luftwaffe.\n\nThe log of the Italian submarine Axum charts a few devastating minutes which saw three ships – escorts Nigeria, Cairo and soon-to-be-legendary tanker Ohio – torpedoed. As a result, Axum was subjected to a sustained two-hour-long depth charge attack before surfacing to see the results of her deadly attack: 'A big ship in flames, another burning with much smoke, a third ship already burnt out.'\n\nSo bright were the flames that they lit up the outline of Renato Ferrini's submarine. He dived and left the scene.\n\nElsewhere, it was air attacks which delivered fatal blows. The merchantman Waimarama exploded after being hit by up to four bombs from dive-bombers, leaving behind what the commanding officer of the escorting destroyer Ledbury, Roger Hill, described as 'a great pylon of flame and black smoke on the sea.' His ship closed Waimarama's last position, but didn't expect to pick up any survivors given the cataclysm which shook the ship and the oil burning on the surface of the Mediterranean.\n\nInstead, he found some merchant men in the water and Ledbury spent two hours rescuing them. Hill wrote: 'I cannot speak too highly of the sheer guts of these men. They were singing and encouraging each other and, as I went through them explaining that I must get the ones nearest the flames first, I received cheerful answers of 'That's all right, sir. Go and get the other chaps...'\n\nWhat's striking throughout this volume is the heroism on all sides. The Italian submariners, British submariners, Merchant seamen, Royal Navy sailors, German, Italian and Fleet Air Arm aircrews. Heroic acts and feats of endurance were performed by all.\n\nThe commander of an Italian E-boat who sank Glenorchy was cheered through the streets of Trapani in Sicily for his exploits – and presented with a garland – in much the same way that the Maltese welcomed the battered Ohio into Grand Harbour\n\nHelmut Rosenbaum in U 73 slipped through the escorts to sink the aircraft carrier Eagle – earning the German equivalent of the Victoria Cross for his actions.\n\nThe 16 inch guns of the battleship Rodney spewed a wall of fire and steel through which enemy dive-bombers flew, while Fleet Air Arm pilots grappled with their foe in the Mediterranean skies – the Axis often had faster aircraft, and almost always appeared in superior numbers. Admiral Sir Edward Syfret, commanding Pedestal, described their performance in a single word: 'Grand.'\n\nSyfret's judgement isn't the only bit of choice Royal Navy understatement. Fed up with being the victim of constant air attacks, HMS Pathfinder's commanding officer Commander Gibbs decided to take the offensive, heading towards Italian torpedo-bombers with every weapon on the destroyer blazing until the ship 'was almost within a biscuit toss' of the enemy formation.\n\nThe Italians scattered and dropped their torpedoes at random, while a delighted Pathfinder turned away with a feeling, wrote Gibbs, that she'd 'hit a boundary.'\n\nAt great cost, of course, Pedestal got through. At a pretty bleak moment for the Allied cause – Rommel was at the gates of Cairo, Hitler deep in the Caucasus and about to invest Stalingrad – it provided a fillip to flagging morale, not least in Malta.\n\n'The battlements of Malta were black with thousands of people, all cheering and shouting and there were bands playing everywhere.' Roger Hill wrote: 'It was the most amazing sight to see all these people who had suffered so much cheering us.'\n\nThis is an excellent addition to the body of Pedestal literature – as well as a very detailed account of the battle, liberally sprinkled with first-hand descriptions from those who were there, there are more than a dozen appendices.\n\nPlease Note: You can contact the author direct by emailing: briancrabb@talktalk.net\n\nor, if you are having problems with the email address above, please use:\n\nbustercrabb548@gmail.com\n\nBook Review\n\nPublished in SHIRE newspaper August 2014 No. 511\n\nNew WWII book from former Shire resident\n\nBRIAN CRABB, who used to live in 156 Nibley Road, Shirehampton, has spent the last nine years writing and researching a new book entitled: Operation Pedestal. The Story of Convoy WS21S. This was a convoy sent to reach and relieve Malta in August 1942, accompanied by the biggest Royal Navy escort assembled at any point in the Second World War.\n\nThe convoy suffered heavy losses when repeatedly attacked by Axis aircraft, submarines and E-boats, and hundreds of men lost their lives, including a number with links to the local area. 21 year old Able Seaman William Henry Johnson, who was a DEMS gunner on board the MV Waimarama, had been recently married to Dorothy May Johnson of 10 Barrow Hill Road. His parents lived in Avonmouth. He was tragically killed, when MV Waimarama, which was carrying high explosives, blew up and caught fire in spectacular fashion, after being bombed by a Junkers 88 dive bomber on 13 August. The author's late father, Percival Crabb, who was born in 26 Priory Road, was serving in the 6 inch cruiser HMS Kenya during this epic convoy. She was torpedoed in the bows by the Italian submarine Alagi, but managed to carry on.\n\nThis hardback book covers every detail of this legendary convoy and is lavishly illustrated. It has a Roll of Honour for both Allied and Axis' men lost and much more. The book costs £25, which is a generous price compared to other books of similar size. If anyone is interested in purchasing a copy, the author will deliver it personally, providing the address is local.

August/September 2014 No. 39.\n\nNew Book Discovers Fate of Avonmouth Born Son\n\nA new book entitled 'Operation Pedestal.\n\nThe Story of Convoy WS21S in August 1942' by Brian James Crabb reveals that Able Seaman William Henry Johnson RN was lost in the MV Waimarama on 13 August 1942; he was the son of William Henry and Alice Johnson, who lived in Avonmouth. William, a DEMS gunner on board Waimarama, was killed during a fatal attack by a German Junkers 88 dive bomber, leaving a young wife, named Dorothy May Johnson, who lived at 10 Barrow Hill Road, Shirehampton.\n\nThe ship, which was carrying high-explosives, exploded and caught fire in spectacular fashion, as a convoy, consisting of thirteen fast modern cargo ships and the British-crewed American oil tanker Ohio, bravely tried to reach Malta in August 1942. Nine of the cargo ships, including Waimarama, were sunk; not to mention an aircraft carrier, two cruisers and a destroyer.\n\nThe book uncovers the true facts about this convoy, which was known by the Admiralty, to be about to endure massive and continuous attacks by the Axis' forces. Selection of the fourteen merchant ships depended on size, reliability and speed; for this was a 14-knot convoy. The author's interest, in a book that has taken nine years to research and write, stems from his late father Percival Crabb, who was born in 26 Priory Road, Shirehampton, and served in the 6 inch cruiser HMS Kenya, which formed part of the largest Royal Naval escort ever assembled during the Second World War.\n\nA Roll of Honour not only names all the Allied personnel lost, but the Axis personnel too. Such was the vastness of the research, the author had to index it, to gain easier access to the detailed information held at The National Archives in Kew. This hardback book, which is lavishly illustrated, costs £24.00 (a price somewhat lower than books of similar size and content). Copies can be ordered by telephoning the Shirehampton-born author at 01275 844229 or 07811582082. Signed copies can be delivered by the author, providing the address is local.\n\nROLL OF HONOUR\n\n(Researched and compiled by Brian James Crabb)\n\nLIST OF KNOWN ALLIED DEAD\n\nLOST AS A RESULT OF

The flames spread rapidly and almost immediately orders were given to abandon ship. One of the ship's gunners, however, was pinned under a raft. Apprentice Gregson immediately went to his assistance and help free him. The gunner had sustained severe injuries and, as it was impossible to get him into a boat or onto a raft, he was dropped overboard. Gregson dived into the sea after him, and, in the darkness, towed his helpless shipmate to a ship [HMS Bramham] which picked them up, a distance of about 600 yards.\n\nBut for Apprentice Gregson's gallant and determined action, undertaken with complete disregard of his personal safety, the injured man would have had little chance of survival.\n\nLondon Gazette 9 February 1943\n\nBracewell Peter Postlethwaite Apprentice MID\n\nOgilvie James Simpson Chief Officer MID\n\nPrice James Michael Fourth Officer MID\n\nWard Walter Edward Second Engineer Officer MID\n\nUngazetted award by Lloyd's:\n\nBrown Ramsey Captain Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nGregson John Sedgwick Apprentice Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nMV Dorset\n\nTuckett Jack Collier Captain DSC\n\nFern James Gregory Leading Signalman RN P/JX 141451 DSM\n\nLondon Gazette 26 January 1943:\n\nSpence Thomas Chief Engineer Officer DSC\n\nTrotter John Chief Officer DSC\n\nAnderson William Rutledge Able Seaman RANR PM/1678 DSM\n\nGordon Patrick Alexander Trimble Apprentice DSM\n\nLondon Gazette 9 February 1943:\n\nAndrews Walter Johnson Second Engineer Officer MID\n\nBush Robert George Third Officer MID\n\nNewman Francis Wade Second Officer MID\n\nUngazetted awards by Lloyd's:\n\nAnderson William Rutledge Able Seaman RANR PM/1678 Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nGordon Patrick Alexander Trimble Apprentice Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nSpence Thomas Chief Engineer Officer Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nTrotter John Chief Officer Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nTuckett Jack Collier Captain Lloyd's Bravery Medal\n\nMV Empire Hope\n\nWilliams Gwilym Captain DSC\n\nBennett Ernest James Leading Signalman RNVR C/LD/X 4161 DSM\n\nCain John Leading Telegraphist RN D/JX 152740 DSM\n\nLondon Gazette 26 January 1943:\n\nConolly Gerard Vincent Third Officer DSC\n\nLeffler Henry Ramsay Chief Engineer Officer DSC\n\nLondon Gazette 9 February 1943:\n\nSendall Cyril William Second Officer MID\n\nWest John Edward Fourth Engineer Officer MID\n\nWinyard Harold Chief Officer MID\n\nYoung David Cadet MID\n\nLondon Gazette 16 February 1943:\n\nMcCallum Donald* Cadet BEM (Civ)\n\n* For saving a lifeboat, when the ship was sinking, by going down a fall and inserting a plug.\n\nMV Glenorchy\n\nLondon Gazette 23 February 1943:\n\nSkilling Benjamin Hunter Second Officer DSC\n\nCollier Louis James Able Seaman DSM\n\nSimon Ronald Mackie Third Officer MID\n\nLeslie George DSC Captain Posthumous MID\n\nLondon Gazette 5 February 1946:\n\nUpton William* Deck Boy Commendation\n\nMV Melbourne Star\n\nLondon Gazette 8 September 1942:\n\nMacFarlane David Rattray OBE Captain DSO\n\nLondon Gazette 10 November 1942:\n\nBlandford Harry Chief Engineer Officer DSC\n\nParsons Leslie Thomas Chief Officer DSC\n\nClaydon John Charles Lance Bombardier 4th MAA RA 1595504 DSM\n\nCook John Boatswain 1081741 DSM\n\nFairclough Jack George Bombardier 4th MAA RA 1488978 DSM\n\nFleming James Able Seaman DSM\n\nGreenwood Alexander Able Seaman DSM\n\nMcWilliam Frederick Lamptrimmer DSM\n\nO'Connor Herbert Ship's Steward DSM\n\nBache Harold Bombardier 4th MAA RA 826511 Posthumous MID\n\nInce Howard Richard Second Lieutenant 4th MAA RA Posthumous MID\n\nLondon Gazette 9 February 1943:\n\nAlmond Charles William Chief Refrigeration Engineer Officer MID\n\nKnight George Douglas Third Officer MID\n\nMcNeilly Hugh Storekeeper MID\n\nRichards William Edward Second Officer MID\n\nWhiton Ralph Donkeyman MID\n\nSS Ohio\n\nLondon Gazette 8 September 1942:\n\nMason Dudley William Captain George Cross\n\nCitation:\n\nThe KING has been graciously pleased to award the GEORGE CROSS to:\n\nCaptain Dudley William Mason, Master, SS Ohio.\n\nDuring the passage to Malta of an important convoy Captain Mason's ship suffered most violent onslaught.
