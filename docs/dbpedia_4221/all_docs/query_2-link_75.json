        "text": "The concept of Dual-Use technology has been instrumental in shaping the modern world. But how did this idea come to be, and why has it become so significant in today’s technology market? Dual-Use technology refers to innovations that serve both military and commercial purposes. The concept took shape after World War II, when military advancements began to influence civilian industries. Dual-Use can be described as technology as research with applications in both defense and commercial sectors. A clear example is imaging-sensor technology, originally developed for military surveillance, now used in commercial video cameras and robotics. In the 1950s, military technologies started to impact daily life in the U.S., a process often called the “spin-off effect,” where military research benefited commercial sectors. This relationship was strengthened during the Cold War, especially with the establishment of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1958. DARPA’s goal was to keep the U.S. at the forefront of technology, leading to breakthroughs like the computer mouse, GPS, and ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet. These innovations, while initially military-focused, found widespread civilian applications. Corporations like Raytheon, Boeing, and Lockheed Corporation (now Lockheed Martin) were key players in developing advanced technologies, particularly in aerospace. These companies collaborated closely with U.S. defense departments, producing technologies that eventually transitioned to civilian use. However, by the late 20th century, these large corporations became less agile, slowing the adoption of new technologies. In the 21st century, the landscape changed. Tech startups like Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Meta (Facebook) began surpassing government defense departments in research, innovation, and speed of deployment. These companies, emerging from the digital era, quickly brought new technologies to market, reversing the traditional “spin-off effect.” Instead of military innovations trickling down to civilian use, commercial innovations began enhancing military capabilities. Dual-Use technology has evolved from being primarily driven by military needs to a more balanced exchange between defense and commercial sectors. Today, commercial startups lead much of the technological advancement, influencing both fields. As this collaboration continues, Dual-Use technology will play a crucial role in shaping the future of both defense and commercial markets. ⇀\n\nShoutout to Harpoon Ventures portfolio companies Solugen, Firestorm and Sema4.ai for making Business Insider's Most Promising Startups list (according to Venture Capitalists). Solugen uses biotechnology to make chemicals in an environmentally friendly way. The Houston-based startup launched in 2016 and has developed a manufacturing platform dubbed Bioforge. That platform uses bioengineered enzymes and metal catalysts to convert sugars into chemicals typically made from fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas. Firestorm is part of San Diego's booming defense tech ecosystem, building modular, 3D-printed drones that can operate autonomously and perform predetermined missions on the battlefield. Through its novel edge-manufacturing platform, xCell, the startup allows those deployed in combat zones to order, build, and quickly receive these aircraft on demand. Sema4.ai is building enterprise AI agents that can reason, collaborate, and act. The company is developing AI agents that can move beyond simple repetitive tasks and actually solve real-world problems, taking into account the unique context of the organization and working seamlessly with existing teams. https://lnkd.in/eu_SpVhz ⇀\n\nAstranis Space Technologies, a Harpoon Ventures portfolio company, is leveraging its small geostationary (GEO) satellite capabilities as the U.S. military looks to diversify and fortify its communication architectures. The company’s approach focuses on smaller, more agile GEO satellites which promise more resilient and responsive satellite communication options compared to the traditional larger GEO satellites. These satellites, notably lighter and potentially less costly to replace, represent a strategic pivot to enhance the U.S. military’s capabilities in space, particularly in scenarios of conflict or natural disasters . Astranis recently celebrated a $4.5 million contract win from the Space Force to integrate U.S. military communications waveforms on their platforms. This contract, which includes options for further expansions worth $6 million, highlights the growing confidence in Astranis’ technology and its potential applications. The company’s focus on the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) aims to ensure secure communications, vital for military operations. Astranis is doing great things to support the United States Space Force and the orbital mission of resilient communications and we are Harpoon couldn't be more excited to support them. https://lnkd.in/g-iYiZ8v ⇀\n\nAnduril Industries just raised $1.5bn at a $14B valuation to scale defense manufacturing. What do they plan to do with it? They will open a new factory dubbed “Arsenal” that will boost the team's autonomous weapons output dramatically, with a focus on systems that can be rapidly manufactured at scale. This is a powerhouse of an investment and Arsenal will surely be the Tesla Gigafactory of our Defense Industrial Base. Anduril’s new funding round was co-led by Founders Fund, which led Anduril’s seed round in August 217 and its Series A, and Sands Capital, which has participated in multiple IPOs since Visa’s public offering in 2008. https://lnkd.in/gHeVvGih ⇀\n\nWireScreen does it again! In collaboration with The New York Times, WireScreen (a Harpoon Ventures portfolio company) helped uncover how China is using smugglers to obtain NVIDIA chipsets for its military. The AI race is heating up, and it turns out China is quite clever at dodging U.S. restrictions on advanced Nvidia microchips. Despite strict export controls aimed at preventing access to these crucial AI technologies, there are those in China who are finding ways around the rules. That’s where WireScreen comes in. They’ve really lifted the veil on this issue by mapping out networks of shell companies and key individuals involved in these transactions. Their work has illuminated the sophisticated methods used to circumvent U.S. regulations, showing just how challenging global tech enforcement can be. It’s clear that setting rules isn’t enough; we also need smart tools like WireScreen to monitor and counter these tactics. It’s a modern approach to a modern problem, and it’s proving essential in keeping up with the pace of technological change. https://lnkd.in/dF8wTRct ⇀\n\nAllie Garfinkle is at it again with Fortune with another great write up! The punchline? Business is inextricably linked to human nature. Allie reviews the market's wild day yesterday, where the the S&P 500 closed down by 3%, clocking its biggest single-trading-session loss since 2022, Japan’s Nikkei 225 had its worst day of trading since 1987 and on Sunday, Goldman Sachs raised the probability of a recession within the next year, and this is all on the heels of a surprisingly unfavorable job report last week. She note's we re at the point in the market spiral where Fed governors are sweating, online articles for recession-specific indicators are proliferating, and people are perhaps starting to be scared because it’s unclear what will happen next. But talking to VCs the message she got was pretty self-assured: \"We’re not worried.\" Read her latest in Fortune to find out why.... https://lnkd.in/e8f_X5zq ⇀\n\nSan Diego's skies have witnessed aviation history unfold since the late 19th century. From John Montgomery's pioneering glider flights to Glenn Curtiss's establishment of the first US military aviation school, the city has been a cradle of aeronautical innovation and naval aviation. This legacy is exemplified by the iconic Spirit of St. Louis, designed and built in San Diego by Ryan Airlines before its historic transatlantic solo flight. The city's strategic location and ideal weather conditions transformed it into a major aerospace hub during World War II, with companies like Consolidated Aircraft producing pivotal aircraft like the PBY Catalina and B-24 Liberator. Post-war, San Diego cemented its role in defense and aerospace, becoming a center for helicopter operations and pioneering in unmanned aerial vehicle technology. Today, the city's vibrant aerospace ecosystem, anchored by major corporations, a few great startups like Firestorm and Shield AI, and supported by academic institutions, continues to push the boundaries of aviation and space exploration.\n\nHave you dropped by our office in San Diego yet? 👇 Located right next to Petco Park, it can be pretty intimidating. There are Olympic medals from Athens and Beijing, custom Harpoon Ventures tomahawks, knives with the Navy SEAL Trident, coins from west-coast SEAL Teams, and even a fast rope hanging from the ceiling. Our founder, Larsen, has a distinct style - thats for sure. But don't let the SWAG fool you - we're always happy for our network to drop by. If you're in the area, let us know!
