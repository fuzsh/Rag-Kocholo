The recent reinforcements of Spitfires, Beaufighters and Beauforts are here to help protect the ships from enemy attacks, he revealed. In a desperate bid to get a sufficient number of ships through to the Island, it has been decided to mount a dual convoy, approaching from the eastern and western Mediterranean, in the hope of dividing the efforts of Axis forces.\n\nOPERATION VIGOROUS\n\nOperation Vigorous, the ‘eastern’ convoy of eleven merchant ships with escort, met yesterday with Force A off Tobruk, bringing the total protective force to eight cruisers and 26 destroyers, plus corvettes and minesweepers, and the veteran battleship Centurion. The convoy came under immediate air attack: one merchantman was damaged and another limping into port with engine trouble was sunk by enemy aircraft.\n\nA Malta-based reconnaissance pilot reported today that two Littorio battleships have left Taranto harbour in the company of four cruisers and ten destroyers and at the same time two cruisers moved from Cagliari to Palermo with their escorting destroyers. The heavily armed Italian naval force is on course to intercept the convoy heading from Tobruk. Reconnaissance has also revealed that despite reductions in enemy bombing activity over Malta, German and Italian air forces remain in significant numbers on Sicilian aerodromes. They are believed to be in a state of readiness to attack the two convoys.\n\nFour Wellingtons were despatched tonight to strike enemy vessels reported 60 miles from Cape Geroghambo 60 degrees. Only one Wellington was able to release its two torpedoes. The enemy force put up a heavy smoke screen, and although results were not observed, one of the torpedoes was seen to run well. Smoke screen prevented the other three Wellingtons from attacking. A shadowing Wellington saw glow on the water after the attack.\n\nOPERATION HARPOON\n\nMeanwhile Operation Harpoon, consisting of six merchant ships carrying 39000 tons of cargo and oil, and the American tanker Kentucky with 14100 tons of fuel and kerosene, left Gibraltar on Friday. They are escorted by an anti-aircraft cruiser, HMS Cairo, nine destroyers, the fast minelayer HMS Welshman and a number of smaller ships. Further cover is being provided by HMS Malaya, carriers Argus and Eagle carrying operational aircraft, three cruisers and eight destroyers.\n\nThe ‘western’ convoy was also attacked today, by the Italian Regia Aeronautica: torpedoes sank the freighter Tanimbar and damaged the cruiser Liverpool which has been taken in tow by Antelope. Argus and Eagle were also hit, with the loss of some crew. Under orders not to enter Malta in order to save fuel, the protective escort returned to Gibraltar leaving the remaining merchantmen with less cover. HMS Welshman has left the convoy and is heading alone at speed for Malta.\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 14 JUNE TO DAWN 15 JUNE 1942\n\nWeather Wind south-westerly. 100% cloud; Slight rain.\n\n0630-0709 hrs Three Spitfires 601 Squadron Luqa are airborne to intercept enemy aircraft: no combat.

Sorties were continually being made by Spitfires, Beaufighters, torpedo-carrying and reconnaissance aircraft.” (1)\n\nSPITFIRES TAKE AIR WAR TO SEA\n\nFrom dawn today 170 sorties were made by Malta-based Spitfires and another 12 by Beaufighters to cover the transit of the two convoys through the Mediterranean. They intercepted and destroyed three JU 88s, three JU 87s, three ME 109s, two BR 20s and two float planes, probably destroyed two JU 88s, one ME 109 and one Macchi 200, and damaged five JU 88s, one JU 87, three ME 109s, one BR 20 and one unidentified bomber. Malta lost three Spitfires and one Beaufighter.\n\nWESTERN CONVOY UNDER FIRE\n\nReports are coming in that the western convoy Operation Harpoon came under attack early this morning near Pantelleria, from Axis aircraft and the Italian navy. Despite setting up a smokescreen, two Allied destroyers and three of the merchant ships were hit and disabled. The damaged Kentucky, with its essential cargo of fuel for Malta’s fighters, was taken in tow but after further enemy action the convoy commander made the reluctant decision to sink her in order to save the remaining ships. The rest of the convoy including two other damaged vessels went on its way slowly towards Malta.\n\nSeveral fighter missions were flown from Malta in an attempt to protect the beleaguered convoy. In a counter-attack by the Island’s air forces, four Albacores released torpedoes at a cruiser, scoring two hits: smoke and steam were seen to pour from the vessel. Another torpedo was dropped at a large destroyer, scoring a probable hit. Later three more Albacores attacked and probable hits were obtained by two torpedoes on a cruiser. Two Beauforts also attacked the enemy naval force striking the leading cruiser. Other aircraft arriving on the scene reported the whole ship ablaze.\n\nWELSHMAN ARRIVES\n\nAfter a fast passage from Pantelleria without further incident, HMS Welshman entered Grand Harbour at 0730 hrs today. The ship was unloaded, oiled and re-ammunitioned, and sailed at 1400 hrs this afternoon to reinforce Force X.\n\nEASTERN CONVOY ABANDONED\n\nEnemy naval forces were also in hot pursuit of the eastern convoy, which had to undertake a series of direction changes in an attempt to ward off her attackers. In a fierce sea battle early this morning the destroyer Hasty was disabled by a torpedo, killing twelve men, and had to be sunk. HMS Bedouin was badly hit and came to a standstill. She was taken under tow but this afternoon an Italian aircraft scored a direct hit with a torpedo and she sank. This afternoon the destroyer Airedale was hit several times and disabled; she was later sunk.\n\nMeanwhile, Malta-based air forces launched a series of raids on the Italian fleet, disabling the heavy cruiser Trento. However, the Luftwaffe continued relentless attacks on the Allied convoy and by 1800 hrs today only six merchant ships remained from the original eleven.\n\nBy this evening the eastern convoy ships were facing a serious shortage of fuel and ammunition due to enemy attacks and diversionary tactics. With a strong Italian fleet still in pursuit, the decision was taken to abandon the eastern convoy operation. The remaining ships returned to Alexandria: none of the merchantmen reached Malta.\n\nMALTA COUNTER ATTACKS\n\nTonight five Wellingtons were despatched to attack the enemy force as it returned to Taranto. One aircraft scored a hit with a torpedo on the port side of the leading battleship, the flash from the explosion being clearly seen. Despite repeated efforts, a heavy smoke screen prevented the other aircraft from taking aim.\n\nNine Beauforts attacked two enemy naval forces in position 090 degrees Malta 210 miles. One force consisted of two battleships, one cruiser and seven destroyers; the other, two cruisers and seven destroyers. The Beauforts dropped nine torpedoes: one hit a battleship or heavy cruiser, throwing up a column of water 50 feet high, followed by thick smoke and flames visible 35 miles away. Another torpedo hit was claimed on a battleship or heavy cruiser causing dense black smoke. A destroyer was hit amidships and left listing to port.\n\nLater 12 Beauforts of 39 Squadron ex Middle East were despatched to strike at enemy shipping. En route to the target the aircraft were intercepted by ME 109s and two were shot down into the sea, while five returned to the Middle East. The remaining Beauforts hit a Littorio battleship with at least one torpedo. A destroyer was also hit amidships and a possible hit was scored on a battleship before the Beauforts returned to Malta.\n\nPhotographic reconnaissance later reported that the Italian fleet had returned to Taranto after its attempt to intercept the convoy – but the cruiser Trento was a conspicuous absentee. A large Italian destroyer was also photographed in tow off south west Sicily.\n\nAIR ACTIVITY DAWN 15 JUNE TO DAWN 16 JUNE 1942\n\nWeather Wind southerly; 50% medium cloud.\n\n0610-0955 hrs; 1030-1445 hrs Eleven Beaufighters 235 Squadron are on patrol over the Malta-bound convoy.

The two merchantmen were escorted by Cairo, Welshman, six destroyers, four fleet minesweepers, and six motor launches.\n\nOnly two merchant ships of the original six which set out from Gibraltar on Friday under Operation Harpoon have so far reached Malta. The remains of the fragmented convoy had almost made it to Grand Harbour last night when they ran into a minefield. Orari and Matchless were damaged and the Polish destroyer Kujawiak was sunk. Badsworth was damaged off Zonkor Point and Hebe by a near miss from a bomb. While returning to harbour after having acted as a navigational mark, Justified struck a mine and sank with the loss of three Maltese ratings.\n\nUnloading was started as soon as the two ships were berthed, Maltese stevedores working on Troilus and Army personnel on Orari. They will work continuously day and night, unless large formations of bombers cause the red flag to be raised over the Dockyard area. Working parties are then sent to shelters ashore, lorries near the ships dispersed, and a smoke screen put up over the harbour.\n\nThere was only one air raid during the day, which caused no damage.

The failure of two massive convoys to bring more than a token delivery of essential supplies is a massive blow to the besieged Island. The population is already on starvation rations; access to water and domestic fuel is severely limited. Aviation fuel and ammunition supplies are extremely low.\n\nThe Times of Malta this morning published a broadcast made by The Governor, Lord Gort, last night outlining the implications to the people of Malta: “Some days ago, two convoys set out, one from the West and one from the East to bring supplies which we need to restore our situation. The Western convoy had to endure severe and prolonged attacks, and only two merchant ships survived the ordeal. They are now in the Grand Harbour…These cargoes are essential for our future and well being. The Eastern convoy, after suffering from prolonged and intense attacks by the Luftwaffe, was ordered to turn back…\n\nI must break to you what the arrival of only two ships means to us. For some time past we have been short of supplies and further privations lie ahead of us…Every effort will be made to replenish our stocks when a favourable opportunity presents itself. Meanwhile we must stand on our own resources and every one of us must do everything in his or her power to conserve our stocks and to ensure that best use is made of all the available resources that remain to us. We must make all possible savings in every commodity and stock…”\n\nHaving lost supremacy in the skies over Malta, the Axis have proved themselves to be in control of the seas. The Island is now isolated and the plan is clear: to starve Malta into submission.\n\nAIR RAIDS DAWN 17 JUNE TO DAWN 18 JUNE 1942\n\nWeather Wind southerly; no cloud – haze.\n\n0800 hrs Air raid alert.
