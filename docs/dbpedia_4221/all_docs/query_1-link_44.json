        "text": "Harpoon Block II is the worldâ€™s premier anti-ship missile. It features autonomous, all-weather, over-the-horizon capability and can execute both land-strike and anti-ship missions. The 500-pound blast warhead delivers lethal firepower against a wide variety of land-based targets, including coastal defense sites, surface-to-air missile sites, exposed aircraft, port or industrial facilities and ships in port.\n\nHarpoon Block II provides accurate long-range guidance for land and ship targets by incorporating the low-cost inertial measuring unit from the Boeing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) program and the software, mission computer, integrated Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System, GPS antenna and receiver from the Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM ER).\n\nThe multi-mission Block II is deployable from all current Harpoon missile system platforms with either existing command and launch equipment or the commercially available Advanced Harpoon Weapon Control System (AHWCS).\n\nBoeing and the U.S. Navy marked the 40th anniversary of the Harpoon Missile System in June 2011. Nearly 300 Boeing team members develop, build, maintain and provide operational support for Harpoon.\n\nIn August 2009, Boeing delivered the first Harpoons with an upgraded Guidance Control Unit (GCU) that reduces obsolescence and enables future upgrades.\n\nIn June 2012 the U.S. Navy awarded Boeing a firm-fixed-price contract for $120 million for the production of nearly 60 Lot 86 Harpoon missiles and associated hardware.\n\nIn June 2012, Boeing received a firm-fixed-price contract from Naval Air Systems Command for the production of nearly 90 Harpoon Block II missiles."
