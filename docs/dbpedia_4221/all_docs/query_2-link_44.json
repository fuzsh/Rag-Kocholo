The present economic slump has had an influence on investments in space technology, as it has on many other startup areas. However, total investment in the second quarter of 2023 totaled closed to $1bill. That was double that of the first quarter. The median deal size also doubled during that time. Many growth stage companies, such as Ursa Major, Constanellis Aerospace, and Astranis, raised $100 million or more According to Deloitte, the volume of data flowing between Earth and space will reach 500 exabytes by 2030. This represents a 14x increase over 2020. #spacetech , #financialforecasting , #investing , #venturecapital Investments in the satellite industry are expanding faster than those in the launch industry. reference - https://lnkd.in/gAWdVBVH\n\nCALLING ALL TECH FOUNDERS!

We started FLUIX Pro by developing our patented turbulent liquid cooling technology to enable ultra efficient high performance computing. Although we received initial sales and grants, there was a larger problem to solve. (2019 - 2022) As we refined out approach with data center customers, we uncovered the energy problem and lack of insights & controls in these facilities. Inspired by the autonomous vehicle industry and with the growth of generative AI, we pivoted in tackling a much bigger problem. This is when FLUIX AI, with the help of our CTO Chase and our broader team!
