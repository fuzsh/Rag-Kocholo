        "text": "0602105501 74k Arthur Japy Hepburn was born 15 October 1877 in Carlisle, Pa. and graduated from the Naval Academy on 05 June 1897. During the Spanish-American War he served as Passed Midshipman in battleship Iowa, and he participated in the defeat of Admiral Cervera's Spanish Squadron off Santiago, Cuba, 03 July 1898. Commissioned Ensign 01 July 1899, during the next two decades he assisted in making oceanic surveys in the Pacific and performed a variety of duties ashore and afloat, including service in Georgia, Olympia, and South Carolina. During World War I he commanded the seized German liner Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Submarine Chaser Base, New London, Conn., until ordered to Europe in July 1918 to command the subchaser base at Queenstown, Ireland. After the armistice, he served in Chester, inspecting German naval ships and aircraft in accordance with naval terms of the Armistice. From 1919 to 1922 he was Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering, and from 1922 to 1924 he served as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters. During the years prior to World War II, he served a wide variety of important posts both ashore and afloat. He took command of West Virginia (BB 48) in May 1925; became Director of Naval Intelligence in July 1926. From 1927 to 1930 he served as Chief of Staff with Battle Fleet and U.S. Fleet and on 23 May 1931 took command of Submarine Forces, U.S. Fleet. Between June 1932 and July 1933, he served as a naval member to the three-power Limitations of Arms Conference as Naval Adviser to the Geneva Delegation in Switzerland and to the American Representative at the London Naval Conference.

He also served as a delegate to the Dumbarton Oaks meetings, which established guidelines for founding the United Nations. Admiral Hepburn retired from active duty 10 December 1945, and died 31 May 1964.\n\nUSS Hepburn (DE 1055) (1969-1991) was the first ship to be named in his honor.\n\n(U.S. Navy National Archives photo #80-G-K-13936 from the Naval History and Heritage Command)"
