Ray, Oldendorf, John Young, Comte de Grasse, O’Brien, Merrill, Briscoe, Stump, Conolly, Moosbrugger, John Hancock, Nicholson, John Rodgers, Leftwich, Cushing, Harry W. Hill, O’Bannon, Thorn, Deyo, Ingersoll, Fife, Fletcher, Hayler\n\nCold War US DDs:\n\nFletcher DDE class | Gearing DDE class | Gearing FRAM I class | Sumner FRAM II class | Forrest Sherman class | Mitscher class | Farragut class | Norfolk class | Charles F. Adams class | Spruance class\n\nDesign Development\n\nThe origin of the program dater back from the Vietnam war. It was realized that the old FRAM WWII era Sumner and Gearing leftovers were no longer credible as a naval asset in ths current changing events, they were small at 3,500-4,000 ton and only carried a 8-cell ASROC, four obsolete 5-inch/38 guns, two triple Mk32 ASW torpedo launchers, the staff considering “sitting ducks” to anti-ship missiles. They were limited also in their ASW capabilities (their only saving grace), lacking proper helicopters (the failure of DASH made them even elss relevan than Frigates like the Knox class) and still, they packed some 400 sailors in poor living conditions going back to 1942 emergency wartime specifications. Morale was low, capabilities were poor and yet they were still costly to operate, and had been costly to upgrade. It was more than time to replace them, as soon as possible.\n\nThe 1972 Ingalls model, showing many differences with the final design (German publication).\n\nThe other incentive as the much better array of Soviet submarines in construction. New SSNs introduced since the very fast “November” class sent shockwaves in the admiralty board. The old FRAM were fas enough but lacked modern ASW capabilities while the Knox class were too slow and not enough. Later this was solved by the adoption of the Oliver Hazard Perry class to replace the Knox from 1975, so about at the same time as the new DDX class.\n\nBut at the end of the 1968, the US Navy started a competition for a new class of guided missile ships, more suitable to carrier battle groups protection and initially planned to be just upscaled and upgraded KNOX-class ships. Many proposals were made by several yards, including nuclear-powered ships. The program was called “DDX”. The competition ended when Ingalls Shipbuilding was awarded the contract for the whole class.\n\nThe DDX competition\n\nArtist impression of the DDX\n\nThe new DDX was later named in honor of U.S. Navy Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, central figure after Nimitz and Halsey in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater in WW2 notably at the Battle of Midway and Philippine Sea. The man passed out on December 13, 1969 just when this destroyer class was studied.\n\nThey were originally designed to escort a carrier group, and primarily to be used for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) but still with point-defense anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) missiles unlike the Chalres F. Adams which focused on SAM defence. They were also to have limited anti-ship capabilities, but that was no different than previous designs, except for the gun armament, to be further reduced. As time progressed, the final design was not larger than anything built before, especially for an ASW-oriented destroyer, but it had a number of innovations as well:\n\n-Gas turbine propulsion (a first for that type of ship)\n\n-Flight deck and hangar for up to two medium helicopters (for better ASW range and tracking)\n\n-All-digital weapons (a new centralized battle system, between the sensors, sonars, ASW TTs and ASROC)\n\n-An Automatic 127 mm (5-inch) gun, radically different compared to the previous two 5-inch (127 mm)/54 caliber Mark 42 guns\n\nAnd this was just the most outstanding list.\n\nInitial design in 1973\n\nThe design being tasked of the defense of nuclear aircraft carrier task forces, it was indeed tailored to be efficient against the latest generation of Soviet nuclear powered submarines and this was reflected in their size, going for for greater seakeeping ability in all weather conditions, in order to track down SSNs whatever the conditions, something still somewhat difficult for earlier flush-deck ships. In the end, they ended more than twice as large as a World War II destroyer and to the scale of that era’s cruiser, with a light cruiser displacement. This was quite an amazing upscaling. The new ships indeed were going in 1971, when the design was approved against missiles SSGs like the Juliet, Echo and Charlie types, SSKs such as the mass-produced Foxtrot, the just revealed Tango class, November and Victor I-II. The K-3 (early November class) made a strong impression by following USS Enterprise at 31 knots on January 17, 1968. This was a wakeup call for the admiralty to get better destroyers.\n\nConstruction\n\nModular contruction at Ingalls\n\nThe final design as approved was was to conduct to mass construction inside a single yard, Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Laid down of the first batch started in 1972 and commissions echeloned between late 1975 and 1980. USS Hayler was commissioned in 1983. Due to their appearance they soon earned the nickname of “Spru-cans”.\n\nThis was considerable as they were the first US Navy class powered with gas turbines, former marine versions of jet aircraft engines with reversible-pitch propellers and screws rotated in the opposite direction from other twin-screw ships. The crew was about the same as an Adams between 300 and 400 officers and ratings, and comfort and habitability considered in the design, and in the 1990s, they even started to be retrofitted to provide separate quarters for female personnel. Being much roomier they enabled way more spacious living quarters for the crews, in stark contrast to the previous destroyers, always on the cramped side. Fact is, they were even considered like the “gold platters” in the old days when the 1934 Farraguts entered service compared to the WWI era “flush deckers”.\n\nThe acquisition under the DX program and attribution to a single shipyard for the production contract (and 30 ships!) was a completely new (and risky) policy based on “the Total Package Procurement” concept issued by Robert McNamara and the “Wiz Kids” of his department. This was really to take all advantages mass construction, with every parts sub-contracted coming into a single place. This ensire better control of these elements when received, and standardized integration, as well as just better standardization across the board, down to the minor details.\n\nNot only that, but the yard’s sole responsibility of the class also extended to maintenance, repairs and refits, as well as major overhauls and upgrades over their service yards.\n\nThe “complete package” indeed.\n\nThis did not however went well with the “old guard” of the Congress however. Indeed, a new class was usually spread heavenly among yards located in the congressmen’ circumscriptions, ensuring the preservation of jobs (and votes). It was alleviated by the argument that at least a wide array of state-wide, coast-to-coast ubcontractors will still reap the fruit of the new order, the chosen yard being only the “final assembler”.\n\nThe selection process was also criticized at the time to be “notable for its political influence and changing rules”. The entire contract being awarded to Lytton Ingalls Shipyards of Pascagoula in Mississippi on 23 June 1970 was a first in the USN by its scale, and also the number of innovations brought into this new class. An extremely risky move indeed by the number of novelties in this procurement and many in the Navy and at Washington predicted a disaster.\n\nAnd as predicted, despite is optimism of the yard to reap the benefits of the “quarter century contract”, Labor and technical problems soon caused cost overruns and construction delays. In fact, USS Haler ordered on 29 September 1979, originally planned as a DDH (Destroyer, Helicopter) design, with a modified deck to carry far more helicopters and somewhat influenced by the JMSDF’ own destroyer concepts.\n\nUltimately, this DDH program was terminated (see below) and DD-963 entered service in its original form as well as an additional four ships originally built for the Iranian Navy and fitted with the Mark 26/Standard missile system, and after the revolution became the “Kidd class” in thz USN (see below). They were far more advanced general-purpose ships and way better than the Spruance, but continuting production of that class was denied. As well as rebuilding all Spruance ships to this standard due to the cost being too high already. The Ticonderoga-class cruisers were in fact, “Kidd” under steroids, initially planned as DDG-47-class destroyers but redesignated as “cruisers” in 1980 because of their more complete armament and Aegis combat system as well as integrated flagship facilities. And these 27 ships were distributed this time between Ingalls and Bath Iron works. Lessons were learned.\n\nDesign of the class\n\nFinal design, DD-986 Hill\n\nHull and general design\n\nThe final ship was a leap forward in terms of dimensions as said above: A displacement of 8,040 (long) tons fully loaded, and after upgrades in the 1980s they even reached approx. 9,200 tons fully loaded, and circa 6,156 tons light. They reached light cruiser tonnage, to be compared to the last Charles F. Adams built before (3,277 tons standard, 4,526 full load), so twice as much.\n\nThe ship’s Length was 529 ft (161 m) at the waterline for 563 ft (172 m) overall for a beam of 55 ft (16.8 m), so making for a 10.5 ratio, quite favourable to speed. Mean Draft was 29 ft (8.8 m).\n\nSo in dimensions, once again the increase was spectacular from 133 x 14 m to 171 x 17 m.\n\nBut the hull was also radically new. Instead of the classic flush deck style adopted from the WW2 fletcher class onwards, the new hull not only returned to a stepped design (with a lower, short aft section) and had much fuller forms. The tall freeboard helped considerably their seakeeping, unlike the flush-deck ships, to meet the objective of keeping full speed even in heavy weather. The roomier hull also helped to install a very large and complex CODOG system in order to push performances much further compared to the Adams.\n\nA high degree of automation led to have only a crew of 24 officers and 302 rating originally, benefiting from an unparalleled Comfort and habitability introducing amenities such as a lounge, an ATM machine, a gymnasium, a class room, and a general store (internal supermarket for the crew). Habitability benefited to new living spaces divided by partitions ensuring single, permanent and private berthing spaces with curtains, each room having no more than six men each and recreational area as well as more numerous an accessible sanitary spaces. However the crew varied in time with additional armament, jumping up to 322 at the end of their career, as well as the installation of separate spaces for women.\n\nProtection\n\nOriginally none. The “spru-cans” were originally intended to displace under 7,000 tons full load, but from DD 997, additional Kevlar armor was installed around the CiC and other places like the ammo storage under the main guns, so she displaced 8,250 tons full load when completed. Kevlar plastic armor was added later to all units inside vital spaces, starting with the four planned FY 81 with the entire class armoured by 1986. The superstructure was left in aluminum and welded to the hull via bimetallic strips, and so was sensitive to fire, but halon sprinklers (like in tanks) was installed all around. Plus the ships were made NBC with total sealing possible, like the Nimitz class carriers. There were pumps that can washover their decks in case of a fallout.\n\nIn addition, the tomahawk and harpoon canister were also armoured.\n\nPowerplant\n\nHard rudder sea trials tests, USS Hayler.\n\nThese were the first class in the US Navy to have gas turbine power, a true revolution. The US were catching up with Europe which already tried this system since more than a decade, and the Soviet Union was just introducing it for their Kara class, contemporary to the Spruance. Each destroyer has four General Electric LM-2500 engines, basically marine shaft power versions of the TF39 turbofan used on the DC-10 and C-5A aircraft. These were rated at 20,000 shaft horsepower each while the four main recalled modern jet aircraft. For this, they were rated for “well beyond 30 knots” which was shown on trials (classified), the number 30 being kept for naval standard. Most authors specifies 32.5 ot 33 kts as “top speed”. The overall output was 86,000 shp.\n\nFull speed in addition could be reached from 0 to 12 knots in just 53 seconds, and two minutes or so to 30 knots and more. They were called the “navy’s muscle cars”. This propulsion machinery, another innovation, was placed under the control of a single operator located in the central control station (CCS) thanks to heavy automation. Either of the three gas turbine generators was rated to 2,000 kilowatts and there were two engines per shaft while each was driven by locked train with double reduction and double helical reduction gears, enabled also to installed twin controllable-reversible pitch propellers allowing very quick turns and braking, bringing the ships to a full stop in record time. These propellers had a diameter of 15 ft (4.5 m) with 168 rpm revolutions at 30 knots.\n\nThe machinery central operation center dueing 1975 trials. (US official photo)\n\nTo add to the benefits of this machinery, apart the turbine-like hissing sound, greatly attenuated, made the propulsion machinery very quiet, essential for ASW ships. Engineers managed to add the Prairie/Masker hull system (Radiated noise reduction system fitted also to the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, Ticonderoga-class cruisers) and a propeller bubbler system to reach this.\n\nEndurance could be enganced by using a single shaft, with automatic compensating angle braking on the rudders for cruising. Between overhauls the LM-2500 gas turbines could thanks to this, be used continuously for 9,000 hours with only basic maintenance. DD 963 introduced electric heating while DD 997 introduced the Litton automated engine-control system. All previous destroyers had a waste-heat boilers which required heavy maintenance problems and proved problematic all along their career. But overall, they were rated for a range of 6,000 nautical miles at 20 knots or way more using a single shaft at cruising speed, while the gas turbine oil storage was 1,650t in normal conditions.\n\nArmament\n\nThe Spruance-class destroyers had a very complex missile loadout history for an ASW ship, with numerous changes and variations poorly documented. One great hope that the expected modularity of the roomy hull and superstructures would allow some easy upgrades. This was not the case, explaiçning in part the 20-years service of these “cursed ships”.\n\nThe Original Armament\n\nWhen entering service in 1975, USS Spruance only had in addition to her two single guns (like the Adams class), a single eight-cell ASROC launcher forward and another eight-cell Sea Sparrow aft. This was the same as a Knox-class frigates and when in service, immediately rise an outcry as they were woefully underarmed for their size and operating cost. It was just hoped that thry could receive additional systems in the future. However this weakness was only apparent as unlike the Knox, they carried 16 reloads for each systems wether ASROC or Sea Sparrow, a greater capacity than any previous missile-armed destroyer. The builder also was only instructed to install initially the ASROC system, that’s the Navy that installed the Sea Sparrow post-completion, and all pre-commissioned ships were indeed only armed by the ASROC as “pure” ASW vessels. Besides, their larger helicopter capacity, the best sub-trackers in the inventory, was also a plus.\n\nSo the initial provisions of vectors in 1975 was 24 Sea Sparrows and 24 ASROC instead of 16 and 16 for the Knox.\n\nRUR-5 ASROC\n\nMK-112 “Matchbox” launcher.

The first having these was apparently in 1978 USS Hewitt (DD-966) and the process was over by 1985.\n\nArrival of the Tomahawk (1980)\n\nAt the same time the even more capable Tomahawk alro arrived in canisters, and the navy tried to fit them on any platform. The large Spruance-class were priramy candidated for the upgrade, starting in 1980 with USS Merrill (DD-967), making the first surface launch for the USN. Initially a pair of four-vector canister Launchers, armoured (ABL) one on each side of the ASROC launcher. Merrill only had the port one mounted during trials, later another was added. 7 destroyers were modified circa 1986. It was alternative to harpoons on Merrill.\n\nThis early Tomahawk was a conventional or nuclear antiship missile, so did the ASROCs as an option, and all Spruance were supposed to carry them for some missions at all times.\n\nArrival of the Mk 41 VLS (1986)\n\nThe canisters allowed the Tomahawk tto be quickly operated, but the systems were heavy (armoured), limiting the number of vectors aboard. The ideal solution appeared to be a VLS, in that case, the Mk 41, a new launcher first installed aboard USS Spruance in 1986. This was a 61-cell module, with 3 cells dedicated to the reloading crane; It replaced the ASROC launcher and its magazine forward and this has been only possible because of the modularity of internals, planned for a future DDG variant.\n\nThis successful midufication greatly enhance firepower as the ships were now able to perform saturation fire, and twentyfour of the Spruance-class received this upgrade, modified ending in the late 1990s, shortly before decommission. This VLS installation enabled both antiship and land attack capabilities, while sacrificing the ASROC which had been the bedrock of its original ASW vocation Development of a Vertically Launched ASROC (VLA) started by 1983, but delays due to the promising (and later candelled) Sea Lance missile had it only available in the 1990s, too late for the Spruance class.\n\nVector changes, early 1990s\n\nIn the early 1990’s post Cold War budget cuts drastically reduced the Spruance’s upgrade possibilities. Operational requirements also changed, as the bulk of the former Soviet submarine fleet was rotting in ports. The nuclear-capable Tomahawks were retired and replaced by conventional land attack weapons for ground support, completely changing the Spruance-class nature.\n\nArrival of the VLA (1993)\n\nFrom 1993, VLS ships were converted to the new VLA (ASROC) to have their ASW capability restored. But the conversionw as only made on the limited number of ships as thee systems were already shared with the Ticonderoga-class cruisers, and new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. It seems those equipped only had four missile. The typical provision for these was 24 Sea Sparrow, 57 TLAM, 8 Harpoon and 4 VLA.\n\nFinal changes (late 1990s)\n\nAlso in the mid-1990s the now obsolete ASROC was withdrawn and 7 of these destroyers had neither the VLS upgrade or ASEROC, leaving them without ASW weapon but their helicopters. In place opf the ASROC box launcher, the magazine was plated over. USS Merrill by 1993 for example only had 24 Sea Sparrow, 8 TLAM and 8 Harpoon. This was far less than a similar size “Tico” or a Burke class DD.\n\nHarry W Hill (DD-986) was even left withits eight Harpoon canisters and 24 Sea Sparrow, so essentially less armed than a frigate.\n\nThe final upgrade from 1997-1999 saw ten VLS-equipped Spruance receving the new 21-round Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launcher on the fantail in lieu of the sea sparrow. It had less range than the latter but at least had semi-active radar guidance, passive-homing to engage multiple targets simultaneously. It is also capable of intecepting sea-skimming antiship missiles unlike the sea sparrow. This upgraded started in 1997 on USS Oldendorf (DD-972), the last being added by 2003.\n\nHowever despite all these upgrade, the Spruance class remained fa rmore vulnerable to air and missile attack and between their large size and accompanying operating costs they were doomed in a post-cold war budget-stripped USN. Decommission started in 1998 and went up to 2005 so even less than 20 years of service. Some Spruance which received the last upgrade only kept it for two years.\n\nCommunication & Tactical Information Management\n\nThe radio equipment aboard the ship enables SPRUANCE to send and receive messages from any part of the world. Operating 24 hours a day, speed and accuracy have been refined to an art by SPRUANCE radiomen. Communicating within a battle group for tactical purposes is accomplished through the Naval Tactical Data Systems (NTDS). All combat detection, tracking and fire control systems are integrated through the ship’s digital Naval Tactical Data System Computer, providing the ships with fast and accurate processing of tactical information. Using high speed computer-to-computer data links, NTDS welds together the processing capabilities and sensors (radars, SONAR, etc.) of each of the individual units in company, presenting a complete tactical picture.\n\nThe SPS-55 surface-search radar antenna has been moved to a new, higher platform on the foremast in order to accommodate the radome housing the antenna for the SQQ-28 LAMPS-III helicopter datalink. A small navigational radar set (usually of the Raytheon SPS-64 series) is now mounted above the pilothouse.\n\nDD 971 carried the prototype USC-38(V) EHF SATCOM installation (FLTSAT-7), and many of the class have now had the WSC-6 SHF SATCOM system installed. The Hughes Mk 23 TAS (Target Acquisition System), which uses a high-rpm radar, has been mounted on all units but DD 986 on an aft-projecting platform on the mainmast to detect low-flying, high-speed missiles and aircraft.\n\nAll ships have the NATO Link 11 data-sharing system. USW is handled by a Mk 116 fire-control system. The Mk 91 Mod 0 fire-control system for Sea Sparrow uses a single radar director.\n\nA total of 12 ships of the class (two conversions funded under FY 02, three each under FY 03 and FY 04, and four under FY 05) are to be given CEC (Cooperative Engagement Capability) modifications to permit Standard SM-2 MR missiles to be launched from the vertical launch cells, with the missiles to be controlled by another ship.\n\nIn addition to the Cooperative OUTBOARD Logistics Update (COBLU) Phase I Signals Exploitation System, the ships have a SLQ-32 electronic warfare sensor which provides tactical detection and analysis of enemy electronic emissions. Early units were given the WLR-1 EW system as an interim installation until SLQ-32(V)2 was available; at least two ships (DD 971, 975) carried both. In 1987, it was announced that the EW suite would be upgraded to SLQ-32(V)3 in all, but that decision was superseded by installation of the Raytheon Short Stop active jammer, upgrading the EW system to SLQ-32(V)5. However, many ships still do not have the active capability. In those that have had Mk 15 CIWS Maintenance Enclosures added, the portside SLQ-32(V)5 antenna array has been moved aft to beneath the CIWS mounting.\n\nThe AN/SYQ-17 RAIDS (Rapid Antiship missile Integrated Defense System) was installed in the entire class during mid-1990s overhauls; the electronic system serves as a rule-based planning aid to coordinate the use of the ships’ defensive systems and uses target input from the Phalanx CIWS radars. They also have four Super Rapid Blooming Offboard Chaff (SRBOC) Launchers and four SLQ-49 decoy launchers to confuse and decoy enemy homing missiles. During a 1994-95 modernization refit, DD 997 became the first ship to carry the Westinghouse MSTRAP (Multi-Sensor Torpedo Recognition and Alertment Processor). DD 985 began trials with the Remote Minehunting Operational Prototype (RMOP) (V)2 during 1996, using a winch and recovery system mounted on the portside boat deck.\n\nASuW protecton bubble\n\nMark 32 TT bank, firing the Mark 46 acoustic torpedo. It carried a PBXN-103 high explosive 96.8 lb (43.9 kg) Warhead at 12,000 yd (11,000 m) and down to 1,200 ft (370 m) at up to 40 kn (74 km/h; 46 mph).\n\nComposition: The “trident”\n\nAnti-submarine warfare was the bedrock of the class, and this included a sonar suite with the most advanced underwater detection/fire control system ever developed by any USN ship. The base of the armament relied on the always trusted two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes bank, located amidship either side and ASROC. The other main advantge were the two SH-60B LAMPS Mk III helicopters aft acting as an extension of the whole ASW suite.\n\nThe SQS-53 hull-mounted active sonar doubled by the SQR-19 tactical towed passive acoustic array were indeed a serious asset making the Spruance the best ASW escorts ever designed so far indeed.\n\nDD 980 by fall 1985 started to test the new SQQ-89 sonar system, which incorporated the SQS-53B and later SQS-53C active bow sonar plus SQR-19 passive TACTASS. Later in life they swapped to the SQQ-89(V)8 sonar suite and Lockheed Martin SQS-53D sonar as well as the SQR-19 towed array plus the SQQ-28 helicopter datalink, Mk 116 Mod.\n\n5 UBFCS, and SIMAS processing system to stay relevant in the 1990s. In addition to the SLQ-17 sonar signal processor and the SRQ-4 helicopter datalink receiver the helocopters also operated the SQQ-28 sonobuoy analyzer and UYQ-25 acoustic range predictor as well as the UYS-1 acoustic spectrum analyzer in a mobile way. When equipped with the VLA ASROC this was assorted with the Mk 116 Mod 5 or Mod 8 underwater fire-control systems. The seven ships lacking ASROC had the Mk 116 Mod 9 FCS system.\n\nCapabilities\n\nThe ships were able to located submarines at considerable ranges and depths. The hull SONAR emitted a very powerful sound wave reflected by the submarine and bouncing back range and bearing data until its position was determined. It cold be either by the hull sonar or by its SH-60B Helicopters, and computers pass the retreated information to the ASROC and helicopter (the second one could be used in a hunter-killer fashion). After the helcopter bubble (see later) went the ASROC releasing after a predetermined time, its homing torpedo on station, the same Mark 46 with great range and speed, homing on the already located target, until destroyed.\n\nCloser in engagement, the torpedo launchers were used, with six ready, and quick reload. Indie the rload magazine the Mark 46 could be repared with optional warheads. The SPRUANCE class were also equipped with a decoy launcher at the stern to divert incoming torpedoes herself. She also had the expendable bathythermograph (XBT) to get the most accurate and updated data on sea temperature at varying depths, crossing and correcting SONAR data and having an impact on its waves bent by layers of warmer and cooler water.\n\nThe AN/SQR-19 The AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array SONAR (TACTAS) id the main passive sonar, very accurate and long range, and preferred method over the active sonar, not environment friendly to say the least due to the power of the sound waves. The passive became in the 1990s the main detection system, used at all times, comprising a serie of acoustic modules towed after a long cable out of the stern, as far as possible to avoid ship’s interferences. Its Hoist Room was located under the fantail between the cable and array and display consoles grouped in the main SONAR Control room.\n\nBoth the AN/SQQ-89 and AN/SQQ-89 SONAR were designed to incorporate several semi-independent or ported subsystems:\n\n-AN/SQS-53B Hull-Mounted SONAR\n\n-AN/SQS-19 Towed Array\n\n-LAMPS MK III Sonobuoys\n\n-MK 116 MOD 6 Underwater Fire Control System (UFCS).\n\nCombining three SONAR systems and modern fire control system into a single control space allowed a SPRUANCE class to cross all data together in a smart way.\n\nHelicopters\n\nSH60B: Crew: 3–4, 5 passengers in cabin in transport mode. Slung load of 6,000 lb (2,700 kg), internal load of 4,100 lb (1,900 kg) and total 6,684 lb (3,032 kg) payload\n\nWith its max takeoff weight of 23,000 lb (10,433 kg), powered by two GE T700-GE-401C turboshaft engines rated for 1,890 shp (1,410 kW) they can reach 146 kn (168 mph, 270 km/h) over 450 nmi (520 mi, 830 km), well beyond the Spruance’s own sonar range.\n\nMain advantage of the Spruance class, justifying the large hull: A pair of SH-60B HELICOPTER and their hangar for housing and maintenance, as the “Light Airborne Multi-Purpose Systems” or LAMPS MK III. The SH-60B is a twin-engine helicopter, with a crew of two pilots and single sensor operator/crewman, operating the sonobuoys and tracking targets. The ASW SH-60B Seahawk could carry xx sonobuoy and has the suite to receive the data and its interpretation system, as well as the Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) gear, threat detection/display equipment. The helicopter could also ebe used for direct attack, carrying two Mark 46 ASW torpedoes, same model as those operated on the ship. LAMPS MK III could also perform liaison/medevac evacuations, SAR and gunfire spotting as well as over-the-horizon targeting and datalink for long range missiles such as the Harpoon. The flight deck was later modified to incorporate the Recovery Assist Securing and Transversing (RAST) System allowing safer flight operations in heavy weather.\n\nOn 15 ships, this flight deck has been widened, flush with the starboard side for the SH-60B LAMPS III plus dual RAST haul-down and deck traversing equipment. The Spruance were also operating the LAMPS-I SH-2F Sea Sprite helicopters until 1994. Torpedo magazines for the Mark 46 also comprised the Penguin Mk 2 Mod 7 antiship missiles for the LAMPS-III, on DD 979 from 1994.\n\nAnti-Air protection bubble\n\nThe Air defense capability of the Spruance class was at first a NATO Sea Sparrow SAM complemented by two 20mm Phalanx Block 0 or 1 CIWS (Close-ln-Weapons Systems) to deal mostly with incoming missiles, and SLQ-32 Electronic Counter Measures system. By 1994, the MK-23 target acquisition system was integrated, served by the SPS-40 2D air search radar and SLQ-32 electronic support system. The SWY-1 integrator interfaced the MK-23 target acquisition radar with the Sea Sparrow and CIWS over incoming targets.\n\nSince 1994, the SWY-3 integrator was coupled with the RAIDS and RAM Block 0 launcher, installed aft. In 1998, the Navy estimated the air defence to be moderately low and justified retirement based on near-term and low relative to mid-term threat requirements. By 30 September 1999, only 7 destroyer had the RAM. The navy expected an upgrade with NULKA for all, and RAM Block 1 to three ships but this was not voted.\n\nThe DD-963 sub-class ended with the most capable air self defense system between the antimissile detection system Mk 23 TAS/NSSMS FCR, with moderate field-of-fire blockage zones at the bow, but the missile range stayed short while the air search radar was a 2D. After RAM was canceled, only the Mk 15 CIWS mounts were upgraded to Block I and located in maintenance enclosures with the aft mount raised atop a new deckhouse. This made the Spruance dependent of the presence of a Ticonderoga for air defence.\n\nGeneral assessment\n\nThe underarmed, but innovative “love boats”\n\nSAN DIEGO (April 12, 2010) Sailors aboard the guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill (CG 52) secure mooring lines from the pier after returning home from a three-month deployment.

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Daniel Barker/Released). Despite being automatic, the new guns were no less impressive in size, as shown by the personal in front here.\n\nThe Spruance class destroyers were controversial: In more ways than one. The production of 30 ships by a single yard, Litton Industries, Ingalls Shipbuilding Division at Pascagoula, Mississippi, this was already a risk. This was later confirmed by personnel and component problems. Delays accumulated, but every year five destroyers were launched, a feat for ships of that size. The Navy did not liked them particuarly at first: They were considered too large, weak (so much they were called the “Love Boats” since they were of the size of WWII light cruisers (8000-tons), yet only carried a pair of 5-inch guns) and a poor replacement for the FRAM, albeit this was superficial: Albeit funded by the bankrupt Carter aministration, their armament suite was still superior to the FRAM notably by the number of vectors, an having two large helicopters well service was definitely a great advantage.\n\nIt was thought by many in the Navy that the Knox Class Frigates who would have provided an interim before the construction of improved ships. The failure of the Typhoon system planned FY 1963 ruined all these plans. Later it was planned to integrate them in a plan to have escort aircraft carriers, with six ship in escort, three in their ASW configuration and three converted as SAM ship, plus the commonality of ASW systems between ships as a development guide. Mc Namara insisted over a single contractor for a ship which later could be declined from a single ASW or SAM.\n\nMass production savings, standardized hulls meant the ship could be later reconfigured for example if the ASW threat was more present in the future than the aerial one and vice versa. But with the budget cuts post-1990, many of the additional embedded systems were never installed and the large superstructures left containing large empty spaces. The large size meant a large machinery to maintain 30 knots in bad weather with sufficient autonomy, meaning higher costs. Plans to have these ships converted as helicopter destroyers were also envisioned (see below) as well as selling them to allied navies in their upgraded form. First was Iran, next ROCS, but this soon petered out amidst policy changes and international situation.\n\nBy 1978 already it was also planned to enhance their land-attack capabilities by the installation of a brand new 8-in/55 gun to cover amphibious operations, but this program was later cancelled. The modular structure still allowed for modernization but the ships were doomed by changing priorities and reduced budgets. These waves of upgrades never concerned the entirety of the class, many of which were even further disarmed at the end of their career, making them an even less interesting proposition compared to the “Tico” and new Burke classes.\n\nHowever the ship had far more reedeming qualities. Yes, they were perceived as underarmed for their size, but they bourght more advancements to USN Destroyers than any previous class, and inaugurated a lot of “firsts” while demonstrating amazing capabilities as flagships and collectioning awards throughout their short career. That’s the main point, since they were nearly all sunk as targets after 18-25 years of service, it seems to the general public they were “failed” boats. After all, the same-hull “Tico” served for a decade more. The general public is perhaps unaware of theior AEGIS suite and more rounded, beefier armament overall.\n\nTruth is the “spru-cans” did their job as intended, they started as state of the art ASW destroyers and ended as highly versatile multi-mission destroyers. Each was capable of operating independently or in company with Amphibious or Carrier Task Forces. Main mission was to operate offensively in a Strike Warfare or Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) role while their Tomahawk Weapons Systems provided them long range capability for tactical strike operations. Their passive ASW sensor AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array Sonar (TACTAS) was innovative and really powerful for the time, in fact it was the best of the era.\n\nWorking together with the Mk 116 Underwater Fire Control System, this combination remained for alt least 15 years the most advanced underwater detection and fire control systems ever developed. The Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) as provided faster and more accurate processing of target information, although still not on par with AEGIS, this was a true revolution compared to the Adams. Integration later of digital gun fire control system in the NTDS provided quick reactio in shore bombardment but the gun could swap in a instant to Anti-Surface or Anti-Aircraft fire.\n\nTheir original 8-tube ASROC launchers were later upgraded with a sixty-one cell Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) capable of firing the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and Anti-Submarine Rockets (ASROCs) as well, so adding a powerful anti-ground warfare capabilities to an already extended ASW one. The two Mk 45 light weight 5 inch guns as said above reached perfection (first introduced on these ships they became the new standard, ported notably on the Ticonderoga and Arleigh Burke classes. It was completed by the good old trusted two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes.\n\nBut overall their greatest asset when in service in the 1980s were their extensive facilities for operating two LAMPS (Later LAMPS III) helicopters. She received the NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System, short range, but also the Harpoon Weapon System, medium range anti-ship asset, which was well proven. And against opposite missiles, two Mk 15 (PHALANX) 20 mm Close-In Weapons System and a robust EW suite, between SRBOC chaff, AN/SLQ-32 countermeasures set (among other systems) and if that went down to a hit, armored NATO Sea Sparrow and canisters for the harpoon and tomahawk as well as internal composite and kevlar plating around the internal Operating Central Control room.\n\nAnother point, not negligible for good morale and performances was Crew comfort. The ships being that roomy, habitability was worked out well to provide more intimacy, calm and ergonomics, and became integral part of the design. Berthing compartments were spacious, she had amenities absent from former destroyers (or any destroyer in the world at the time) like a crew’s gymnasium, improvised library, a shop and a more extensive medical facility. This was help by their boxy superstructures, they were large as a World War II cruiser.\n\nAt that stage also a high degree of automation allowed a crew of “only” 24 officers and 296 enlisted to operate her, something unheard of. For an Adams prior to decommission, this was 333.\n\nThis also enabled something unheard of for a cold war destroyer (although this was done in the 2000s), the “crew swap”. Called Operation “Sea Swap” this was an attempt to have any of these ships operational for 400 days continuous at sea. Crews needed rest, so they were exchanged from those of other destroyers after six months.\n\n“Curse” of the Spruance, the abandoned class\n\nThe “spru-cans”, so named because of their aluminium, large box style structures, mostly empty for most of their career, but still they managed to be upgraded, and in the 1980s and 90s, increasingly armed, most swapping out their old ASROC for a 61-cell Mk41 VLS system as in the Ticonderoga class (but lacking the AEGIS) and all having their Harpoon SSMs, NATO Sea Sparrow SAM launcher, two 20mm CIWS R2D2 guns and for the last ones, a 21 cell RIM-116 RAM on their starboard fantail but they varied considerably in armament, some completely lacking their original ASW capabilities.\n\nThis made difficult to use them on a mission-based assignation, and they were usually relegated to second line duties, in a post-vietnam context. Instead of active wartime action, they were found themselves as the backbone of fleet operations in the ingrate last decade of the Cold War between Libya, Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, and war on drugs closer to home. Nothing to really shine in the news.\n\nOne proposal under the reagan administration, was to convert these ships as VTOL carriers\n\nTo add insult to injury, post-1990 context prevented any significant upgrades as they appeared infinitely less capable than the Ticonderoga, albeit having the same size, operating costs and near same crew. In the upgrade list, they came as an afterthought. Some in the navy hoped to save them from the scrapyard and proposed a useful conversion, still sticking to the old concept, almost resurrected under each administration and never carried out, of an escort carrier in case of war.\n\nMany “aviation destroyer” variant proposals flourished, notably a “through deck destroyer” variant with ski jump and capable of operating as much as 10 VTOL aircraft, helped by the destroyer’s size and “long legs” (6000 nm at 20 knots) to operate independently of the battle group like WW1 hunter-killer groups (called the “guided missile aviation destroyer”), or doing flag-waving missions in foreign ports. But nothing came of it.\n\nAfter all the 2000s decommissioned, the navy was lest with less “Ticos”, undergoing gradual retirement, and a fleet of standardize Burke that unlike the Spruances, lacked ASW, ASuW and land-attack capabilities. After all after being all retired, the Spruances retired from the fleet 1,494 Mk41 VLS cells (Tomahawk cruise missiles) 30 ASROCs, 62 5-inch guns, 62 CIWS guns, 249 Harpoon, 62 LAMPS helicopters, 249 Sea Sparrow, 210 RAM missiles, and 186 Mk32 ASW Torpedo tubes plus their sonars.\n\nThis was before the context changed again.\n\nIn the 2010s it was obvious that if the Russian Navy was only a shadown of a threat, but the rapid rise of the Chinese PLAN was undoubtely one to be seriously considered. The shift toward Asia had been abundantly commented and does not need extra exposure, as well as pdt. Trump wish to return to a “500-ship fleet”.\n\nThere, in a context where US shipyards are cash-stripped and even unable to adequately service existing ships, or taking more time to built new ones, and new frigates are on the way, the modular hulls of the 30 “spru-cans” are sorely missing to the Navy today. Notably given the fact the AEGIs had been considerably reduced in size and cost compared after 40 years of improvements.\n\nUSS Hayler being disposed of by explosive tests at sea\n\nNot only they were decommissioned, but they were rapidly disposed off, definitely instead of being just mothballed, pending future developments, like were WW1 and WW2 destroyers. Instead, they were systematically sunk in fleet training exercises, dismantled, or scrapped. They just deserved better. History will judge this “sabotage” of potential capabilities.\n\nLike Europe, the US has been comfortably living under the “dividends of peace”, with only special or small expeditonary forces to lead asymetric warfare being considered worthwile. Fleets has been shrinking to the bone like if there was no tomorrow, and parliaments have little patience for “potential threats” in the distant future. 2023 had been a powerful wakeup call in this for the “free world”.\n\nKidd sub-class\n\nThe “Kourosh class” initially planned to be delivered to the Shah in 1979, as they would appear with the national flag. These would have been the most formidable ships in the Persian Gulf and the whole middle east area if transferred in the early 1980s. All four were incorporated in the USN as the Kidd class, and transferred to Taiwan eventually in 2005-2006.\n\nThis Kidd class (Kidd, Callaghan, Scott, Chandler completed 1981-83) had a much superior SAM capability with two dual-SA-2 SAM launchers and 50 missiles in reserve, an AM ASROC x16 launcher, and SPS-48 radars. SPG-51 Another specific point was the addition of an armor that moved the weight to 9200 tons. The Spruance class, DDG-997 USS Hayler, was started on 20 October 1980, launched on 27 March In 1982, with an enlarged helicopter hangar, Kevlar armor, and an SPS-49 radar, the Reagan administration added six new buildings to its 1987 plan, which was built in 1983. The most promising Ticonderoga were then in operation. At the tests, the Kidd was able to reach 32 knots, the Kidd were only 29.\n\nFrom 1981, the newly built ships received a Kevlar armor around most sensitive points, a modification which ended in 1986. This concerned the in-hull loading of the ASROC launcher, and Tomahawk launchers. From 1986, the buildings received modified Mk41 vertical tubes on the Mk26 base to launch Tomahawk missiles. 45 of this type and 16 ASROC ASW system. Later these launchers could also receive Sea Sparrow and SM-2 SAM missiles. However, it would have been necessary to modify the Mk86 firing system to control them, which was never done. These ships also eventually received the TAS Mk23 system coupled with the sonar SQQ-89, the towed SQR-19 and the SQS-53 bow. Some ships were modified for testing, such as the DDG-971 (Ram Launcher), DDG-976 (30 mm EX-83 Gatling), DD-997 (Mk86 modified to operate Sparrohawk missiles). In 1988-90 the Kidd were also modernized, including the SPS-48E and SPS-49 radar, receiving Phalanx missile guns and Harpoon systems.\n\nDerivatives designs\n\nFire support Spruance\n\nAnother proposal (here extract from Friedman’s book via secret-project site). This proposal even precluded the final spruance class, dating back 30 September 1970. It argues for a derivative armed with two MCLWGs 8-in guns as standard LFS armament, power reduced to 20,000 shp as it was no longer question of chasing SSNs. This was the dedicated fire support version the navy wanted (after all, the Vietnam war still had a few years to go at the time). The hull was also reduced to 555 ft oa (170 m) for 7,460 tonnes FL. It also had the basic point defence system, and single 5-in lighweight gun as well as ASROC and probably TTs also. The sonar is also present to preserve AsuW capabilities. However the “major caliber lighweight gun system” or 8″/55 caliber Mark 71 gun tested in 1975-78 was never adopted.\n\nUSS Hull (Charles F Adams) testing the turret prototype on 17 September 1975.\n\nAviation destroyer Spruances\n\nFY1978 saw Congress authorizing the production of two additional Spruance-class destroyers, but funded only one. This was a helicopter destroyer class (DDH), at not extra cost compared to a standard Spruance-class. Litton-Ingalls had the design work ready for DDH-997, the lead ship. It would have been given a moved back helicopter deck aft, and stretching the hangar, displacing the Sea Sparrow launcher to the top of the hangar. This was to operate either two SH-3 Sea Kings or four SH-60 Seahawk or SH-2 Seasprite helicopters. Nevertheless engineering work required was to be still substantial as a reference, the cost of the Kidd class was $110.8 million, and it it was justifiable for a whole serie, it became impossible to justify for a single ship. Thus, this was cancelled and USS Hayler (DD-997) ended as a regular Spruance.\n\nOne of the earliest of the foll-up design proposals was worked out by Dean A Rains and Donald B Adams from Ingalls Shipbuilding Division, as the ‘flight deck DD 963‘. They looked like Croker’s ‘through-deck cruiser’ with a complete revision of design. Beam extended to 68ft, superstructure rearranged and a hangar above the main deck, flight deck forward of the hangar, ski-jump, landing deck abaft. This was a hybrid and small carrier.\n\nAnother conversion proposal was worked out by Grumman/Santa Fe. It again looked like an hybrid and came as a ‘mid-life’ modernisation possibility of the Spruance class. It had a large hangar built onto the hull aft, and flight deck above to save space. It would rose to 9,000 ton but was not capable t operate up to eight helicopters; or four VTOL aircraft, and showed in fact a “in-house” design, the early(and cancelled) Grumman turbofan Model 698 gull-winged aircraft with swivelling engine nacelles.\n\nProbably one of the most dintinctive VTOL conversion, very alike the HMS Invincible in concept (contemporary) was geared for more extensive, unempeded STOL operations. This was was proposed by Commander Ronald J Ghiradella of the US Naval Reserve. Over the basic Spruance hull, lengthened to 606 ft and with gas turbine uptakes trunked to starboard, the new ships saw an island superstructure also to starboard, an space freed for a 470 ft flight deck, angling to port. Forward were relocated the 5in gun, Harpoon canisters. The 30mm CIWS are relocated on each quarter and the Basic Point Defense Missile System aft of the island. The lift if 62ft by 26ft aft of the island and the design included no less than two hangar decks, main one obove the original main deck, lower one extending from the lift aft to the stern. It could not “house” Harriers, but still had four parked on deck, and would have operated twelve ‘medium-sized’ helicopters with full housing.\n\nCocker’s proposal of a “through-deck” small carrier based on the Spruance hull, probably the most advanced of all conversions proposals.\n\n“Through-deck spruance carrier” artist impression.\n\nApart the previously seen conversion project, there was also a later flyable mini-V/STOL aircraft carrier based on a Spruance hull, carrying AV8B Harrier 2 and ASW helicopters. This project was seriously considered, but never built. It registered with the numerous attempts to revive the “escort carrier” concept in the cold war USN, like the SCS and VSS.\n\nSee also cold war usn aircraft-carriers\n\nThe modernized variant for ROCS\n\nOf its 31 Spruance class, 7 were decommissioned in 1998 and the received a 61 cell Mk41 VLS but neither the SPY 1 radar or AEGIS combat system and its Mk41 operated a ground-attack Tomahawk. Decommissioned followed in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, the remainder in 2010 and 2013 although very good condition and expected for 20 years of more hull life. They were proposed as a perfect fit for the ROCN’s requirements when expressed. It had in this proposal a second 61 cell Mk41 VLS aft as in the Ticonderoga class for a total of 122 cells with VLA/SM2 plus four ESSM rounds. It could be fitted with a light weight composite mast mounting the SPY-1F radar and the modernized AEGIS combat system. The Mk15 Phalanx are swappable as a per-one basis by RAM launchers. Evetuallu Taiwan chose to built indstead (at greater cost but on strategic considerations) the local Hsiung Feng 3 supersonic missile, that could have complement the ship’s ASuW panoply.\n\nEstimation for this conversion was about half the cost of a new Arleigh Burke class ship at circa 600 million. But in the end, Taiwan’s four original Kee Lung-class (ex Kid class) were not upgraded this way. These are by the way the last existing Spruance today.\n\nRead More\n\nLinks\n\nnavypedia.org\n\nglobalsecurity.org\n\nman.fas.org/\n\ndestroyerhistory.org\n\nnavysite.de\n\nsecretprojects.co.uk\n\nacademic-accelerator.com\n\nwww.tapatalk.com\n\nen.wikipedia.org\n\ninfluenceofhistory.blogspot.com\n\nlaststandonzombieisland.com\n\nModel Kits\n\nZhengdefu 1:350 USS Ingersoll Kit\n\nAlthough not super popular, the Spru-can was relatively well covered: Dragon made several of these at 1:350 and 1:700.

However internall, the naval staff was not ahppy with a design considered under-armed for its huge size and operating costs. After commission in 20 September 1975, followed by years of training, a shakedown cruiser, post-fix trials, weapons trials, all in home waters, east coast. USS Spruance’s first operational deployment started by October 1979 to the Mediterranean, screening USS Saratoga Carrier Battle Group.\n\nShe sailed with USS Biddle, Conyngham, Milwaukee, and Mount Baker. She even transited into the Black Sea for ASW surveillance and shadowing the new Soviet helicopter carrier, Moskva, just out of the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet’s shipyard. Hower USS had issues with her LM2500 Gas Turbines and needed them to be replace when back home. She also perform the first clss underway replenishment breakaway flag RAS. A tradition was born when she unfurled the flag on the halyards by playing out the theme song from the 1976 film Rocky and sailing away.\n\nHer first major refit was in 1980 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Second Med Tod was without issue. She stationed off Beirut by June 1982 before being relieved and transited both the Suez Canal and Panama Canal during the same summer. Later in 1983, she received her Phalanx CIWS and TAS Mk 23 radar system. She was back for a third Med TOD to the Arabian Sea in 1983, stopping at Mombasa, Kenya in May 1983. She had a six-month TOD starting by January 1983 to the Persian Gulf with USS Oliver Hazard Perry as observers during the Iraq-Iran War. Next she took part in Teamwork ’84, northern Atlantic-Arctic Ocean in 1984 with NATO.\n\nShe started her 4th Med TOD in the Mediterranean from November 1984, second Black Sea Operations and back by May 1985. After her overhaul (VLS, Towed Array, SH 60 arrived). No records for 1986-88. On 26 January 1989 USS Spruance ran aground on a reef at low speed near Andros Island, Bahamas during ASW training exercises on the trench east. USS Boone had her towed away but she needed worth $1.8 million of repairs, including hull, propellers, sonar dome and forward mast. A junior officer in command at the time was discharged from the Navy.\n\nBack to the Red Sea, under command of CTG 152.1 (Maritime Interdiction Forces), USS Spruance became flagship, task force commander and later for three different task force commanders. After exercizes with the Egyptian and Jordanian Navy she visited Hurghada for a crew leave and later Safaga, Aqaba, for an official visit. On 10 September 1993 she intercepted the 18,000 th ship since August 1990, the Maltese-flag “Early Star” in the North Red Sea, allowed to proceed since nothing was found.\n\nShe started another 6 month Med TOD bringing her from 26 May 1993 to the Red Sea supporting the UN sanctions against Iraq. With the Sixth Fleet she refuelled at Rota, Spain, and visited Palma, but also stopped to Augusta Bay, Souda Bay, and had a local maintenance period (IMAV) with USS Shenandoah. She crossed the Suez Canal on 29 June. Relieved as flagship by USS Hayler on 9 October and 170 interception, she crossed the Suez Canal back to the Mediterranean, stopping when back home to Toulon, Alicante, Rota and home Norfolk on 14 November.\n\nIn July 1994 she took part in Operation Restore Democracy, the UN embargo of Haiti, but she rescued some many Haitians, which had to be transferred to U.S. Coast Guard ships. She also carried 900 Haitians to Guantanamo Naval Station. She was in drydock in Portsmouth, Virginia and back by mid-1996 for 24th annual U.S. NATO Baltic Sea BALTOPS 96 exercise (47 ships and aircraft from 12 different squadrons, 13 NATO-member). She made another Med TOD from April to October 1997 with USS John F. Kennedy battle group. She became flagstaff of Destroyer Squadron 24, visited 13 foreign ports and participating in 5 multinational naval exercises, including the Black Sea, and became Presidential Support Ship in Rotterdam, and Thoule Sur Mer in France for the 52th commemoration of Operation Anvil Dragoon. She hosted an Ukrainian delegation for the 1997 Ukrainian Independence Day celebration and took part in “Sea Breeze 97” in the Black Sea.\n\nBy late 1999, she relieved USS Peterson at the Standing Naval Forces Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED) and deployed later to assist effort after Hurricane Floyd and Hurricane Gert, east coast of Florida, with the John F. Kennedy carrier group. By 1 June 2000, she was drydocked in Jacksonville, Florida, NS Mayport and left on 24 September 2001 for the John F. Kennedy Carrier Battle Group off Vieques Island for COMPTUEX exercise, also off Puerto Rican waters and preparation for 2002 Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX). On 19-26 January 2002 she took part in Phase I JTFEX and on 7–14 February Phase II off North Carolina and Florida. She was deployed a last time with John F. Kennedy carrier group in June 2004, until back to Mayport on 7 December 2004, decommissioned on 23 March 2005. She ended sunk as target by Harpoon missiles off the Virginia Capes, on 8 December 2006.\n\nPaul F. Foster DD-964\n\nUSS Paul F. Foster was commissioned on 21 February 1976, she was assigned to the Pacific Fleet, making many milestone firsts, notably by firing a NATO Sea Sparrow, landing H-46 helicopters, and testing the operational limits of the SH-3 helicopter. Homeported from San Diego, she was the first deploy to the Western Pacific in March 1978, 1979 and 1982, as well as Indian Ocean. She notably joined Destroyer Squadron Nine (DesRon 9) to Long Beach by August 1983. First “all electric destroyer” after an overhaul at the local Shipyard, she obtained a fourth service gas turbine generator. On 29 August 1984, she made her 4th WesPac deployment as DesRon 9’s flagship with Commodore, T.O. Gabriel and staff aboard. The five-ship surface action group too part in many allied fleet exercises.\n\nHer 5th deployment from August 1986 saw her group attached to USS Carl Vinson‘s Battle Group; She was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her performance in Operation Kernel Potlatch between the North Pacific and Bering Sea. From July 1987 to July 1988 she was in overhaul at Northwest Marine Iron Works, Portland with 55 major alterations, receiving her Mk 41 VLS for Tomahawk missiles, AN/SQQ-89 ASW Detection System, and facilities for the LAMPS MkIII. Her 6th WestPac and Indian Ocean deployment started on 24 February 1989 this time with the Ranger Battle Group. She was active also in the the northern Arabian Sea, awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.\n\nOn 8 December 1990, she made her 7th deployment to the Persian Gulf for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. She was the first fire Tomahawk missiles against Iraqi targets. Her 8th deployment started on 20 July 1992, this time for Operation Southern Watch and taking part in bilateral exercises with Gulf Navies. For her 9th deployment, she returned with Carl Vinson’s Battle Group, rescuing the crew of the burning tug Glorious City, putting of the fire.\n\nBack on 20 October 1994, she started a new overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard and received several upgrades, notably the retrofit of a berthing to accomodate her first female crew members. She was moved afterwards to Everett in Washington from November 1995. Her 10th deployment from 21 February 1997, brought her back to the Persian Gulf, enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq. Her 11th deployment started on 27 January 1999 as part of the Pacific Middle East Force, but she took part in Operation Iron Siren, Eager Sentry, and Arabian Gauntlet, conducting many vessels boarding’s to enforce the arms embargo.\n\nHer 12th deployment started on 11 January 2001, with the same missions. Her 13th was also her final deployment, on 18 June 2002. Back home, she was decommissioned on 27 March 2003. In 2004, she was to replaced Decatur as test ship, starting after some modifications in 2005. Assigned to Naval Surface Warfare Center in Port Hueneme Division she served that way until 2019. On 8 April 2011 she tested the Maritime Laser Demonstrator for a sea-to-sea target test, sinking a small inflatable motorboat at one mile in heavy weather. On 17 November 2011she tested a shipboard alternative fuel and went in the Pacific Ocean powered by a 50% algae-derived and hydro-processed algal oil with F-76 gasoline, travelling for 17 hours from San Diego.
