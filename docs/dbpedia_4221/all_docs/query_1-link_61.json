        "text": "By Johnny Franks, Warrior Editorial Fellow\n\nUS and UK forces, in a recent military operation against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, employed an array of advanced weaponry and aircraft. This operation was a response to Houthi assaults on commercial ships and the freedom of navigation in essential waterways, notably the Red Sea. The coalition struck various Houthi locations, including command centers, munitions storage, launch systems, production sites, and radar facilities. These strikes aimed to weaken the Houthis, especially their capacity to attack maritime targets. Details about the specific weapons and aircraft used in these strikes, as well as their tactical deployment, provide further insight into the operation’s overall strategy and effectiveness.\n\nA critical component of the US military’s presence in the region is the deployment of several Navy ships in the Red Sea. Notable among these are the USS Eisenhower (an aircraft carrier), the USS Philippine Sea (a cruiser), and destroyers like the USS Gravely, USS Mason, USS Carney, and USS Laboon. The guided-missile submarine USS Florida, likely operating in the Red Sea, plays an essential role. These ships, particularly the destroyers and the submarine, are armed with Tomahawk missiles, long-range, precision-guided munitions. The US destroyers also feature the Aegis weapons system, an advanced radar setup capable of searching, tracking, and guiding missiles while handling multiple targets.\n\nAir power includes the US Carrier Air Wing 3 on the USS Eisenhower, with F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighter squadrons, an E-2 Hawkeye early warning squadron, and an EA-18G Growler electronic attack squadron. It also has MH-60S Knighthawk and MH-60R Seahawk helicopter squadrons. The F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighters of the US Carrier Air Wing 3, stationed on the USS Eisenhower, primarily use the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile), which is effective for engaging targets beyond visual range. These aircraft also carry the AGM-88 HARM (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile), targeting enemy radar installations, and the AGM-84 Harpoon, an anti-ship missile suitable for maritime combat.\n\nWarrior talks to Air Force Research Lab About Collaborative Weapons\n\nIn addition, the F/A-18s are armed with the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), a series of air-to-ground glide bombs allowing pilots to strike from a safe distance from enemy air defenses. For precision strikes and close air support, they use laser-guided bombs like the GBU-12 Paveway II and the more advanced GBU-24 Paveway III, known for their accuracy in hitting ground targets.\n\nThe UK’s Typhoon jets, operated by the Royal Air Force, also have a formidable missile arsenal. They are equipped with the Meteor missile, a cutting-edge, beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile known for its long range and maneuverability. For ground attacks, the Typhoons use the Storm Shadow cruise missile, capable of precisely hitting long-range targets. Moreover, they employ Paveway IV guided bombs, which are dual-mode (laser and GPS) guided munitions, ensuring high accuracy in various weather conditions.\n\nThese targeted strikes by the US and UK were part of a coordinated response to the Houthi threats and attacks, emphasizing their commitment to protecting international trade routes and ensuring safe navigation in critical maritime areas. This extensive use of sophisticated weaponry and aircraft highlights the advanced military capabilities and strategic approach of the US and its allies in addressing regional security threats."
