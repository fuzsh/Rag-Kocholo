PACVAN is the first of its kind quadrilateral exercise between Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, and U.S. Naval forces. Focused on improving the capabilities of participating countries to respond together to crisis and contingencies in the region, PACVAN prepares the participating maritime forces to operate as an integrated, capable, and potent allied force ready to respond to a complex maritime environment in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nU.S. Navy video by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Taylor DiMartino and Cryptologic Technician 2nd Class Ryan Goebel/Released"
