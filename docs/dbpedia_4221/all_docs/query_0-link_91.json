The site operator said HMS Indomitable's failure to join Force Z was due to rocks in the West Indies.\n\nAnyway, the latter premise was that I asked because of the alternative history that I personally thought of.\n\nIf Prince of Wales and Repulse weren't sunk on 10th December 1941 and remain in the East Indies there's a good chance that they would have been sunk by the time Singapore fell.\n\nThey might be sunk in an air raid on Singapore. This is a quote from the copy of The War at Sea, Volume 2 on Hyperwar.\n\nBy the end of January Singapore was under constant and heavy air bombardment, and the naval base could not continue to function. Preparations were made to destroy the immense quantities of stores, and to deny the enemy use of its facilities; but when the island fell much was actually left intact. Warships which had been refitting were towed away, but the big floating dock could not be removed and had to be scuttled. This great base, the only one on which we had expended any considerable money between the wars, was then closed. From the 3rd of February onwards shipping was heavily bombed in the approaches to Singapore and in the harbours. By the 9th the Japanese had gained a foothold on the island, and the inward flow of British reinforcements was stopped. Three days later all possible ships were cleared from the harbours, taking with them many persons who were not required for the defence of the fortress. These were the last ships to reach safety.\n\nFurthermore, it's probable that the IJN would have reinforced their naval forces in the area with battleships & some or all of the Kido Butai to eliminate the British capital ships.\n\nIf they're still operational when British naval forces were evacuated from Singapore there are three alternatives.\n\nThey're sent to Java and are sunk in a \"Battle of the Java Sea on Steroids\" in which the ABDA force was reinforced by Prince of Wales & Repulse and the Japanese were reinforced by Mutsu & Nagato.\n\nThey're sent to Ceylon and reinforce \"Force A\" of the Eastern Fleet.\n\nThey're sent to Darwin and find their to Sydney in time to take part in the Battle of Coral Sea.\n\nEdit 30.11.22\n\nThere's a mistake in that. When I wrote Darwin I meant Perth.\n\nAnother edit made on 30.11.22 and between the uploading of Pots 32 and 33.\n\nTo clarify the three options only apply to Prince of Wales and Repulse.\n\nThe aircraft carrier goes to Ceylon to reinforce \"Force A\" of the Eastern Fleet.\n\nIf Prince of Wales and Repulse weren't sunk on 10th December 1941 and remain in the East Indies there's a good chance that they would have been sunk by the time Singapore fell.\n\nThey might be sunk in an air raid on Singapore.

Before Coral Sea and Midway (stunning) reversal of fortunes, the Wallies situations in the Indian & Pacific oceans was so dire, everywhere, the odds of PoW and Repulse being sunk... elsewhere are pretty high. It is a bit like british carriers in the Mediterranean and Europe (by large): chance of pre-war carrier survival were slim. In passing, Argus surviving the war was quite mind blowing. Langley was not so lucky. In stark contrast, Béarn actually survived in Toulon harbor until 1967, long enough to meet Foch and Clemenceau ! so did Cdt Teste, even as crippled hull.\n\nWhy so surprised about Argus? She spent most of the war in secondary roles.\n\nOct 1939-June 1940 training carrier in the Med before war with Italy broke out.\n\nThrough the rest of 1940-42 she spent most of her time as a ferry carrier, travelling in convoy, ferrying RAF Hurricanes to Takoradi, Gibraltar, Malta & Murmansk. Only on a handful of occasions did she actually venture into the Med, usually transferring the aircraft she brought out to Gibraltar to Ark Royal and later Eagle. During these ferry operations she only had an air group of 2-4 Swordfish or Fulmars for emergencies.\n\nOnly after the sinking of Ark Royal in Nov 1941 was she tasked with a more important role as the sole carrier in Force H until Eagle’s return from refit in spring 1942.\n\nShe was used operationally during Operation Torch, but then it was back to being a training carrier in the Irish Sea in 1943 before being reduced to reserve in 1944.\n\nFurious is perhaps the greater survivor, as much more operational use was made of her. But at the most critical time for the RN carrier wise she was in refit at Philadelphia and then in Britain between Oct 1941 and June 1942. By Sept 1944 she too was completely worn out and was sent to Reserve.\n\nAs for Langley CV-1, she had been converted to a seaplane tender in 1936/7 becoming AV-3 in the process. In doing so she lost about half her flight deck. This was to release the tonnage to build the Wasp CV-7 under the various Treaties. When sunk she was being used as an aircraft transport taking P-40s from Australia to Java. Here she is in Feb 1942 shortly before being sunk.\n\nPart of Post 18\n\nIf they're still operational when British naval forces were evacuated from Singapore there are three alternatives.\n\nThey're sent to Java and are sunk in a \"Battle of the Java Sea on Steroids\" in which the ABDA force was reinforced by Prince of Wales & Repulse and the Japanese were reinforced by Mutsu & Nagato.\n\nThey're send to Ceylon and reinforce \"Force A\" of the Eastern Fleet.\n\nThey're sent to Darwin Perth and find their to Sydney in time to take part in the Battle of Coral Sea.\n\nGood post.

Although the age of carriers started right there, battleships and battlecruisers were not a big part of the naval action there. Same at Midway, now imagine if they find their way to round 3 - Guadalcanal. There was one of the few battleship brawls of WWII, between US \"treaty battleships\" (the ones before the Iowas, USS Washington and another one, from memory) and Japanese BB. Imagine if PoW found itself in that bloody night brawl.

On completion of the first run she spent a fortnight at Trincomalee (2-16 Feb) before sailing to Aden to swap the half airgroup aboard for the other half ashore before embarking another 48 partially disassembled Hurricanes at Port Sudan destined for Java. This time she was diverted to Ceylon flying them off on 6/7 March. After another 9 days at Trincomalee she sailed back to Aden to collect the other half of her air group.

Because I don't think it'll be possible to get refuelling aircraft gas based on the other options.\n\nThis is another quote from the copy of The War at Sea Volume 2 on Hyperwar and is about the strength of the British Eastern Fleet towards the end of March 1942.\n\nIn spite of the acute difficulties of these anxious days the Admiralty had by the end of March scraped together a force which on paper looked substantial. Admiral Somerville arrived at Colombo on the 26th of that month, and he then took over command of the Eastern Fleet from Admiral Layton. His fleet consisted of the two large carriers Indomitable and Formidable, the small carrier Hermes, the battleships Warspite (recently returned from repairing battle damage received off Crete in America), Resolution, Ramillies, Royal Sovereign and Revenge, two heavy and five light cruisers (including the Dutch Heemskerck), sixteen destroyers and seven submarines. It was fully realised that in this vast theatre maritime air power would be of critical importance, and the Admiralty had done its best to meet the need by giving to Somerville a large proportion of our surviving carriers. None the less his air element was not nearly strong enough to deal with the main Japanese striking forces, whose power and efficiency had been demonstrated all too convincingly. His three carriers had between them only some fifty-seven strike aircraft and three dozen fighters. Furthermore, there were insufficient shore-based long-range reconnaissance aircraft, and almost no shore-based air striking forces. If Admiral Nagumo's carrier force came into the Indian Ocean it would heavily outnumber Somerville's air strength. Nor was that the end of his deficiencies. The R-class battleships were old, slow and ill-protected, and might well prove more of a liability than an asset; many of the cruisers were also old and unmodernised, and some of the destroyers were in urgent need of refitting. Lastly, the state of his main bases at Colombo, Trincomalee and Addu Atoll was such as might well cause any Commander-in-Chief concern; and his fleet was far from being adequately trained to undertake co-ordinated and intricate operations.\n\nThat's a grand total of 3 aircraft carriers, 5 battleships, 7 cruisers, 16 destroyers and 7 submarines.\n\nHe divided his fleet into a fast division (Indomitable, Formidable, Warspite, and the cruisers Cornwall, Emerald and Enterprise), and a slow division consisting of the R-class battleships and the remaining cruisers. His destroyers were shared about equally between the two divisions. The fast division was Force \"A\" and the slow division Force \"B\".\n\nThe Eastern Fleet was reinforced by the aircraft carrier Illustrious in April 1942. However, she didn't arrive at Ceylon until late May/early June (and the Fleet's strength was still 3 aircraft carriers because Hermes was sunk on 9th April) but in the meantime took part in Operation Ironclad. The battleship Valiant arrived in August 1942. The source for both was naval-history.net."
