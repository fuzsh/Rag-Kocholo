        "text": "WHALE DEFENSE CAMPAIGNS\n\nSince Sea Shepherd embarked on its first whale defense campaign, over 6000 whales have been saved from Japan’s deadly harpoons.\n\n2002-2003\n\nFIRST CAMPAIGN\n\nSHIP: M/Y FARLEY MOWAT\n\nLed by Captain Paul Watson, the crew of the Farley Mowat set out to hunt down the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and in doing so exposed Japan’s JARPA II Whaling Program’s illegal activities to the world.\n\nThe whalers were able to change plans and avoid Sea Shepherd but in doing so Sea Shepherd learned a valuable lesson: aerial surveillance increases the chance of success when tracking the Japanese whaling fleet.\n\n2005-2006\n\nANTARCTICA\n\nSHIP: M/Y FARLEY MOWAT\n\nSea Shepherd’s second campaign to oppose illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean saw the M/Y Farley Mowat, Captained by Paul Watson, pursue the Japanese whaling fleet for six weeks.\n\nThe whaling fleet was located on December 22 and fled from their chase. On Christmas Day, the Japanese factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, was intercepted and fled from the Farley Mowat as a result.\n\nThe chase continued into January 2006, covering over 3000 miles along the Antarctic coast. On January 8, the Farley Mowat once again approached the Nisshin Maru and deployed defensive lines. The ship stopped its whaling activities and fled.\n\nThroughout the campaign, the Farley Mowat completed a 50-day voyage covering 8,500 miles and the Japanese whaling fleet was disrupted for 15 days and prevented from achieving their quota.\n\n2012-2013\n\nOPERATION ZERO TOLERANCE\n\nSHIPS: M/Y STEVE IRWIN, M/Y BOB BARKER, M/Y BRIGITTE BARDOT, AND M/Y SAM SIMON\n\nOperation Zero Tolerance was our largest campaign with more than 120 crew from 20 nations on board four vessels: the Steve Irwin, Bob Barker, Brigitte Bardot, and the newest vessel to the fleet, the M/Y Sam Simon.\n\nThe Japanese whalers escalated their attacks on our crew and three of our ships were damaged after being rammed multiple times by the 8,000-ton Nisshin Maru. Our crew also endured ongoing attacks by concussion grenades and were hit with high-powered water cannons.\n\nDespite all the hardships thrown our way, and spending more than 4 months at sea, we returned home knowing that without us hundreds of whales would have been illegally slaughtered."
