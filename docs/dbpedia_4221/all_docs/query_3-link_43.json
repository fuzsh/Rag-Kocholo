        "text": "WASHINGTON, Dec. 18, 2009 – The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress Dec. 17 of a possible Foreign Military Sale to Egypt of 20 RGM-84L/3 HARPOON Block II Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles and associated parts, equipment, training and logistical support for a complete package worth approximately $145 million.\n\nThe Government of Egypt has requested a possible sale of 20 RGM-84L/3 HARPOON Block II Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles, 4 AN/SWG-1A HARPOON Shipboard Command Launch Control Systems including all consoles, software, and shipboard canister launcher units (4 missile battery), spare and repair parts; supply/technical support; support equipment; personnel training and training equipment; technical data and publications; U.S. Government and contractor engineering and logistics support services; and other related elements of logistics support. The estimated cost is $145 million.\n\nThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country which has been and continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.\n\nEgypt intends to use the HARPOON missiles and launch systems on upgraded S-148 Tiger Class Patrol Boats which will assist in modernizing its fleet and consolidate the configuration of the surface-to-surface missiles within its inventory. Egypt will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces.\n\nThe proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.\n\nThe principal contractor will be The Boeing Company in St. Louis, MO. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.\n\nImplementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. government or contractor representatives to Egypt; however, U.S. government and contractor representatives will be required to travel to Egypt annually for a period of one to two weeks to participate in program and technical reviews.\n\nThere will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.\n\nThis notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded."
