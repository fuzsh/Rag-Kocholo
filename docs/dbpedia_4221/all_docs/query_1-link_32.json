        "text": "An illustrated study of premier US anti-ship missile, the AGM/RGM-84 Harpoon, and its 1986 and '88 uses against Libyan and Iranian naval vessels.\n\nIn this study, defence technology expert Lon Nordeen details the role played by the Harpoon missile in two Cold War flare-ups in the 1980s. The Harpoon was the first tactical anti-ship missile developed by the US Navy to provide a counter to the anti-ship missiles exported around the world by the Soviet Union and China. It was deployed on ships, aircraft, submarines and land vehicles and soon became the most widely used anti-ship missile system in the West, with 7,000+ having been produced since 1977, operated by the military forces of more than 30 nations.\n\nThis exciting book explores the engagements of the Harpoon by the US Navy against its Libyan and Iranian adversaries, using original photographs and specially commissioned artwork to examine the naval systems and weapons employed by both counterparts. Drawing upon interviews with the US Navy A-6 Intruder crews that deployed the AGM084 variant of the Harpoon in 1986 and 1988, the author brings unique insight to his examination of these fascinating duels."
