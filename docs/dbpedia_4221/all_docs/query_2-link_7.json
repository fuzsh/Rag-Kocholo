        "text": "Can you tell us about what is covered in the book?\n\nThis book covers the development, testing, deployment, upgrading, and combat use of the Harpoon anti-ship missile system, focusing primarily on US Navy aircraft and surface ship operations. The work also includes insights on US Navy, Libyan, and Iranian ships, as well as aircraft, sensors, weapons, strategy, tactics, and operations that influenced the outcome of naval engagements involving the Harpoon. It was an honor to document the contributions and sacrifices made by sailors, airmen, and others who served in dangerous confrontations where the Harpoon anti-ship missile was employed.\n\nWhat sources did you use when researching the book?\n\nI was able to find volumes of research material on the Harpoon weapons system, 1980s naval and air actions, plus Libyan and Iranian strategy and operations. The goals set by senior US political leaders and senior Navy officers for the actions with Libya and Iran were included in the text. The instructors at the US Navy Surface Warfare School Command provided a portion of their courses attended by US and foreign officers and sailors since 1977; it covers planning and actions required for the firing the Harpoon anti-ship missile system from surface ships and aircraft, and it appears at the start of Chapter 6. A-6E pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) who launched Harpoon in the 1986 and 1988 naval actions against Libya and Iran shared their insights, as did crews from F-14A fighters and SH-2F LAMPS helicopters who supported these engagements. Officers and sailors on US Navy ships that fired the Harpoon in combat and had missiles and guns fired at them shared their experiences, and so did deployed members of the press. The text also includes excerpts from interviews with senior commanders of the Iraqi Navy, Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, and Libyan forces discussing 1980s air and naval weapons, along with strategy and operations.\n\nTell us about the history of the Harpoon\n\nIn the 1970s–80s, US Navy ships, submarines, and aircraft, plus USAF bombers, were armed with the Harpoon to expand American firepower and counter Soviet naval capabilities. The Harpoon was exported to allied nations and the then-pro-western Shah’s Imperial Iranian Navy was among the first group to receive this anti-ship missile system. According to Iranian sources, the Harpoon was first fired in combat on the night of October 22–23, 1980, during the Iran–Iraq War when the Iranian Kaman-class fast-attack craft Joshan hit an Iraqi Osa-class vessel with a single RGM-84A Harpoon in the northern Persian Gulf. This same Iranian ship, albeit with a different crew, later fired a Harpoon at US Navy vessels on April 18, 1988, during a confrontation in the Persian Gulf.\n\nHow did you first become interested in this subject?\n\nDuring my nearly 40-year career in aerospace and defense, I was fortunate to work in support of many fighter aircraft and military programs, including a business development assignment on the Harpoon/Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) program in the 1990s.\n\nWhat has been the impact of anti-ship missiles?\n\nThe proliferation of anti-ship missiles changed naval warfare. Anti-ship missiles have greater range, lethality, and accuracy than torpedoes, bombs, and cannon fire. Missiles launched from surface ships (including fast attack craft), submarines, aircraft, and mobile land launchers have been continuously improved and used in combat, and this book highlights their use in the 1980s.\n\nDetection and tracking of anti-ship missile threats are a challenge since a search radar on a ship can only see out to about 20 miles due to the curvature of the earth. High sea states, darkness, wind, rain, and other conditions can make it difficult for radar and other sensors to detect and confirm incoming missiles. A sea-skimming missile flying at 33 feet above the surface can be detected at no further than 15 to 18 miles, which then provides less than a minute of warning time for the ship crew to act – and even less time if the vessel has been targeted by a supersonic missile. If fired upon, the ship crew must engage with their defenses and use tactics, decoys, and countermeasures to shoot down incoming missiles or disrupt or deflect them.\n\nMore than 70 countries are armed with anti-ship missiles and terrorist groups have also secured these weapons and fired them at commercial vessels and warships. During the past five decades, more than 500 anti-ship missiles are known to have been fired in anger and dozens of warships and at least 200 oil tankers, cargo ships, and other vessels have been damaged or sunk.\n\nWhat is your favorite piece of artwork included in the book?\n\nOsprey military books have long included excellent original artwork, maps, and illustrations. Authors carefully select photographs to underscore military history and developments and provide data to artists so they can create accurate artwork. Jim Laurier created many excellent ship, aircraft, and weapons profiles, plus maps, tactical drawings, and artwork depicting combat situations for this book. My favorite is his superb cover artwork.\n\nCover Art by Jim Laurier\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing you learnt while interviewing the US Navy A-6 Intruder crews?\n\nAs noted in the text, finding, identifying, and targeting adversary ships can often be a challenge. On 24 March 1986, Libya fired long-range SAMs to threaten US aircraft and sent out missile-armed ships toward the US fleet at night in heavy seas. During the 1980–88 Iran–Iraq War, Iran used small “bog hammer” attack boats, frigates, aircraft, and shore-based Silkworm anti-ship missiles to strike at oil tankers and threaten their naval escorts. Iranian vessels often hid near the shore, among islands and fishing boats, and lurked under oil platforms before coming out to attack. Iran planted mines to hit tankers, but an apparently deliberate effort also severely damaged USS Samuel B. Roberts in April 1988, leading to a major naval confrontation. Iraqi aircraft regularly struck Iranian oil platforms, warships, and oil tankers with Exocet anti-ship missiles and on 17 May, 1987, they seriously damaged USS Stark, reportedly by accident. During both the 1986 Libyan operations and the 1988 Iranian actions, US Navy surface ships and A-6 aircraft came into action and fired Harpoon anti-ship missiles.\n\nThe radar, crew lookouts, helicopters, and electronic warfare units on surface ships work as a team to detect, identify, and track other ships and send this information via data link to support command, control, and communications. The US had the advantage of strategic reconnaissance assets, aircraft carrier-based E-2B/C surveillance aircraft, F-14/F/A-18 fighters for self-defense, and A-6/A-7 strike aircraft to monitor and target the battle zone.\n\nOn the afternoon of 18 April, 1988, both an A-6 crew and a US Navy destroyer, following commands from senior officers, each fired a Harpoon missile at nearly the same time at an Iranian frigate and both hit their target. Navy A-6 strike aircraft had great range and payload, and its two-man crew could use its radar, forward-looking infrared sensor, and communications systems to connect with the surveillance network to position for successful attacks with their Harpoon missiles and other weapons."
