So let's stick to dedicated anti ship missiles\n\nPlenty of ships carry more, it depends on the ship. For example the Russian 22350 has 16 cells to combine LACM and AShM. Israel's Saar 6 carries 16 AShMs, as does Russia's upgraded small missile boat (iirc the Smerch) in the Pacific Fleet. 8 is just a convenient amount, it's what two Harpoon launchers get you, a minimal set up if you will, to maintain the capability. The LCS' in the USN are getting 4 NSM for example.\n\nMost VLS, like the MK41, can be loaded with a wide variety of missiles to include ASHM.
