As well as composing numerous acclaimed film scores, Greenwood is known as the British lead guitarist and keyboardist of the alternative rock band, Radiohead. Along with his elder brother, Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, they attended Abingdon School near Oxford, England, where they met their future band members. Greenwood abandoned a degree in music when the band signed a record deal and released their debut single, “Creep”: and they’ve since sold over 30 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. Greenwood’s previous film scores include Bodysong (2003), There Will Be Blood (2007), and Phantom Thread, which earned him a 2019 Golden Globe Award nomination. Greenwood can also play bass guitar, piano, viola, drums, and the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument. As well as composing for the London Contemporary Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra, Greenwood also contributed to the music of two other films which have earned Golden Globe nominations this year: Best Picture Musical/Comedy Licorice Pizza and Spencer, which earned star Kristen Stewart Best Actress in a Drama Motion Picture.
