        "text": "Jack Kay\n\nThis one is all about the bass. We've already tackled the greatest bass lines in history. But it's possible that someone can catch lightning in a bottle.\n\nSo, this one celebrates the actual bass players, legends like Paul McCartney, Larry Graham and John Paul Jones who changed the way the instrument is played while creating some of the most iconic songs in music history. Just think about what the world would be like without the bass lines on \"Come Together,\" \"My Girl\" or \"Another One Bites the Dust.\"\n\nOf course, with most of our lists like this, there was one important criteria. The bassist featured MUST be an Inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nSadly, that ruled out some of the greatest bass players of all time, from Charles Mingus to Jaco Pastorius to Victor Wooten. But it left us with a who's who of innovators in the genres of funk, metal, pop, jazz and so much more.\n\nLet us know who your favorite is in the comments section.\n\nNot all discussion of great bass players centers on technicality. The Ramones' bass lines were far from complex. But they were aggressive and hard hitting, because they had to follow Johnny Ramone's guitar riffs. In doing so, Dee Dee Ramone set the standard for punk rock bass playing.\n\n\"Blitzkrieg Bop,\" \"I Wanna Be Sedated,\" \"Rockaway Beach\"\n\nYou know Ronnie Wood for his guitar playing in The Rolling Stones. But what some fans might not know is that not only did he play key bass parts in that iconic band, but he also did so with Faces, Jeff Beck Group and other artists. When you look at a song like \"Emotional Rescue,\" Wood's bass playing is the real backbone. He could do it all.\n\n\"Emotional Rescue,\" \"Maggie May\"\n\nCook has described his bass work in Creedence Clearwater Revival as a less is more approach. It shows. But it was clear Cook could really play on funky grooves like \"Take It Like a Friend\" and \"Walk on Water.\" And for as basic as they may have been, Cook's bass lines would often serve as the most iconic parts for CCR's biggest songs, specifically \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\" and the band's cover of \"Heard It Through The Grapevine.\"\n\n\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?,\" \"Born on the Bayou\"\n\nAs member of Bill Haley & his comets, Lytle played on some of the most important records in rock and roll history. His harmonic style was pretty simple, but certainly made room for showmanship. Lytle was one of the first bass players to show off the upright slap style and make it a popular technique moving forward.\n\n\"Green Tree Boogie,\" \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\"\n\nColin Greenwood didn't fill the role of a typical bass player. Sometimes his work would kick off a Radiohead song. Most times, it wouldn't come in until much later. However, his ability to push boundaries with the instrument would make the bass parts on Radiohead classics like \"Airbag,\" \"How to Disappear Completely\" and \"There There\" standout moments.\n\n\"Airbag,\" \"15 Step,\" \"Bloom\"\n\nThe Band was all about unity, meaning no single member's playing stood out too much at one time. But there's still much to marvel at with Rick Danko, who knew how to add to a melody. Danko provided beautiful flourishes to every song he played on, helping create one of the greatest rhythm sections in rock and roll history.\n\n\"Life Is a Carnival,\" \"Across the Great Divide\"\n\nWhen you're talking Van Halen, the discussion starts with the band's legendary guitar player. But someone had to lay the groundwork for Eddie Van Halen's playing. That man was Michael Anthony. His bass lines were more technical than you remember, even if they often faded further and further into the background. Still, Anthony kicks off one of Van Halen's most iconic songs in \"Runnin' with the Devil.\"\n\n\"Runnin' with the Devil,\" \" So This Is Love,\" \"Not Enough\"\n\nNovoselic was probably more known for his bass toss than his playing skills. But make no mistake, he was just as edgy as his Nirvana bandmates. Novoselic was one heck of a melodic bass player, especially on songs like \"In Bloom,\" \"Sliver\" and \"Lithium\" that would define the grunge era.\n\n\"Lithium,\" \"Blew,\" \"In Bloom\"\n\nWith Lynyrd Skynyrd, Wilkeson was the master of the Southern rock bass tone. His playing on some of Skynyrd's finest songs would influence every bassist in the genre to come. It's especially noteworthy to check out Wilkeson on any live version of \"Freebird\" or \"Simple Man.\" His solos were to be marveled at.\n\n\"Gimme Three Steps,\" \"Workin' For MCA,\" \"Simple Man\"\n\nCetera is probably best known for the soft rock songs he wrote for Chicago in the 1980s and the likeminded tunes that launched his successful solo career. But you had to be a great bass player to play with the members of Chicago. And Cetera was damn good. His bass lines ranged from simple to stunning. Just try and listen to \"What's This World Coming To\" and not be impressed.\n\n\"What's This World Comin' To,\" \"Poem 58\"\n\nPaul Simonon purple name plate\n\nInfluenced by reggae, Simonon's bass playing has always been thick and strong. It helped give The Clash its unique sound. It's simplicity also allowed Simonon to take full part in the band's lively performances. He was a showman on bass first and foremost.\n\n\"Guns of Brixton,\" \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nYou don't need to be a bass aficionado to know John McVie can play. He practically steals the show on Fleetwood Mac tunes like \"Oh Well\" and the live version of \"I'm Afraid.\" But McVie also proved a rhythmic force on the band's most popular songs, which was no easy task. Listen to how he comes in and out of a song like \"The Chain.\" It's a masterclass.\n\n\"Oh Well (Part 1),\" \"The Chain,\" \"Rhiannon\"\n\nHillman doesn't get near the respect he deserves given he was an important piece of several great bands, including The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers. Hillman was integral to the Byrds early work and some of their biggest hits (including \"Mr. Tambourine Man\"). He was also essential in teasing the country sound the band would veer towards later on.\n\n\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" \"So You Wan to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\"\n\nSchmit had no easy task in replacing Randy Meisner in the Eagles. But he brought his own skill to the band post-\"Hotel California.\" While the band had already released many of its iconic tunes, Schmit delivered impactful and driving bass lines to songs like \"Heartache Tonight\" and \"The Long Run,\" giving the band a more modern sound.\n\n\"Heartache Tonight,\" \"The Long Run\"\n\nNo matter which direction R.E.M. went in, Mills was the band's constant. He generally took a backseat to his bandmates. But he didn't always play the background. Mills' bass is the centerpiece of \"Texarkana\" and he plays the awesome intro to \"Old Man Kensey.\" As a central figure in the development or college and alternative rock, Mills is, no doubt, one of the most influential bassists of the last 30 years.\n\n\"Texarkana,\" \"Losing My Religion,\" \"Old Man Kensey\"\n\nSting may not be the greatest bass player of all time (Though, some might argue he is). But you'd be hard pressed to find too many bassists with a bigger collection of iconic bass lines. Sting's work on songs like \"Voices Inside My Head,\" \"Demolition Man,\" \"Walking on the Moon\" and \"Masoko Tanga\" are fine examples of his genius.\n\n\"Peanuts,\" \"Can't Stand Losing You,\" \"Masoko Tanga\"\n\nYou know you're a good bass player when you become the face of your band while playing the instrument. KISS rocked as hard as any band of its time. But Gene Simmons backed up all the flash with amazing bass lines on song like \"Sure Know Something,\" \"Strutter\" and \"Detroit Rock City.\"\n\n\"Detroit Rock city,\" \"Sure Know Something\"\n\nThe guitar attack of Pearl Jam was a the forefront, along with Eddie Vedder's voice. But Jeff Ament wasn't exactly left in the dust. He ranks as one of the most versatile bassists of all time, playing fretless, upright and a 12-string. All you have to do is listen to the opening of \"Jeremy\" to realize this guy was a force to be reckoned with in a great band.\n\n\"Jeremy,\" \"Animal,\" \"Rats,\" \"Even Flow\"\n\nHamilton fit in perfectly in with the early blues influence of Aerosmith. His playing was filthy and daring. Even on tracks like \"Walk This Way\" and \"Cryin'\" his playing stands out. And then there's \"Sweet Emotion,\" a song whose bass playing requires no further explanation.\n\n\"Walk This Way,\" \"Sweet Emotion\"\n\nIt's somewhat shocking to listen back to Elvis Costello & the Attractions best songs and realize just how much it's Thomas, not other members of the band or Costello himself, who owns them. Thomas' bass work is the defining part of \"Pump It Up.\" It's like his version of \"My Sharona.\" Similarly, his work on \"Lipstick Vogue\" is jaw dropping.\n\n\"Pump It Up,\" \"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea,\" \"Lipstick Vogue\"\n\nPoor Mike Rutherford. Always overshadowed by other prog-rock bassists like Geddy Lee and Chris Squire, and even the great musicians in his own band. But listen back to Genesis tracks like \"No Reply at All\" and \"Can-Utility and the Coastliners,\" and you have some of the best, melodic progressive rock bass playing of all time.\n\n\"No Reply at All,\" \"In That Quiet Earth\"\n\nEveryone knows a Mike Dirnt bass line or two, or three or four. The opening to \"Longview\" is downright iconic and essential to pop-punk. But there are so many more that exemplify Dirnt's distinctive and showy style, which comes with being in a three-piece. You either have the ability to rock a stadium or you don't. He did.\n\n\"Longview,\" \"Kill the DJ,\" \"Welcome to Paradise,\" \"JAR\"\n\nDeep Purple may have been all about the guitars. But if Roger Glover is underrated as a bassist, it's because he found a way to integrate his sound so smoothly into the band's hard hitting rock on songs like \"Highway Star\" and \"Black Night.\"\n\n\"Highway Star,\" \"Space Truckin'\"\n\nWho is a better bassist: Jason Newsted or Robert Trujillo? It's a nice debate to have. For our money, it's Trujillo, who brought simplicity with his ferocity to Metallica's late career. Trujillo's work on \"Halo of Fire\" and \"Hardwired\" is every bit as menacing as his bandmates. The guy is a force.\n\n\"Hardwired,\" \"Halo of Fire,\" \"For Whom The Bell Tolls (Live)\"\n\nThere's aren't too many bass players more influential than Bill Black, one of the pioneers of rock and roll. As a member of Elvis Presley's trio, Black played bass on some of the biggest early rock and roll songs, defining how the job was to be done on the instrument for Paul McCartney, Sting and others.\n\n\"Heartbreak Hotel,\" \"That's All Right,\" \"Jailhouse Rock\"\n\nAnyone in a band with Jimi Hendrix was going to be overshadowed. But go back to The Jimi Hendrix Experiences music and appreciate the cool and brilliant tone of Noel Redding's work. A song like \"Fire\" could not have become what it was without Redding's rhythm.\n\n\"Fire,\" \"Come On (Part One),\" \"If 6 was 9\"\n\nBeing in Guns N' Roses, McKagan's job was to play the role of consistency under the band's two-guitar attack. He did that, but also managed to stand out on some of the band's best tunes, including \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" \"Rocket Queen\" and \"It's So Easy.\" And don't even try to imagine what \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" would sound like without McKagan.\n\n\"Sweet Child o' Mine,\" \"Rocket Queen,\" \"Right Next Door to Hell\"\n\nAnyone who thinks Earth, Wind & Fire is a soft funk act is out of their mind. Just listen to Verdine White's bass work, some of the coolest the genre has ever seen. \"Shining Star,\" \"Serpentine Fire\" and \"Got To Get You Into My Life\" are quintessential funk tunes because of White's funky slap playing.\n\n\"Shining Star,\" \"Got To Get You Into My Life.\"\n\nOakley's background as a guitar player certainly benefitted him in The Allman Brothers Band. As the group's bass player, he had to serve as the understructure. But Oakley has serious musical balls, allowing him to join his bandmates in their daring improvisational runs. How else do you get the boldness to kick off a song like \"Whipping Post.\"\n\n\"Whipping Post,\" \"Mountain Jam\"\n\nIf it's the blues and it's a bass line, it probably has something to do with Willie Dixon, one of the genre's most influential figures. His upright bass tone is one of the defining sounds of the blues on any number of standards, from \"Spoonful\" and \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" to \"Back Door Man\" and \"Maybellene.\"\n\n\"Spoonful,\" \"Back Door Man,\" \"Maybellene\"\n\nCasady was known for his dynamic low-end sound. But he could play anything in a way that no other bassist could back in the 1960s. His most iconic bass line is probably from \"White Rabbit.\" But his performance on songs like \"Somebody to Love,\" Hot Tuna's \"Water Song\" and Jimi Hendrix's \"Voodoo Chile\" shows just how talented he was and still is.\n\n\"Voodoo Chile,\" \"White Rabbit\"\n\nCertainly one of the most iconic bassists of all time, but known more for his songwriting and vision. Roger Waters was skilled on his instrument. He was the driving force behind Pink Floyd's greatest albums for a reason. Other players were more technical. But few were as iconic.\n\n\"Money,\" \"Have a Cigar,\" \"Dogs\"\n\nOften overlooked when you're talking about the greatest rock bassists of all time, Simon Gallup certainly belongs in the discussion. His bass lines with The Cure stay with you on songs like \"Fascination Street,\" \"Lovesong\" and \"Forest.\" If you want a sense of Gallup's showmanship, check out \"The Cure in Orange\" live DVD.\n\n\"Fascination Street,\" \"Lovesong,\" \"Primary\"\n\nYou can't talk about The Rolling Stones without talking about hypnotic grooves. And many of them came from Bill Wyman. Think \"Miss You\" or \"Gimme Shelter.\" Wyman's style could be subtle, but it could also steal the show. See the end of \"19th Nervous Breakdown.\"\n\n\"Miss You,\" \"Gimme Shelter,\" \"19th Nervous Breakdown\"\n\nHad all John Deacon ever done was \"Another One Bites the Dust\" he might have still made this list. It's, arguably, the most iconic bass line in rock history. But his work obviously didn't end there. His bass lines were the key ingredient on Queen classics like \"Dragon Attack,\" \"Under Pressure\" and \"The Invisible Man.\"\n\n\"Another One Bites the Dust,\" \"Dragon Attack,\" \"Under Pressure\"\n\nBoth with Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, Weymouth is an essential figure in the dawn of new wave. Rather than serve as the backbone of her bands, Weymouth used her playing skills to slice through other parts of the song and stand out in a crowd. In that sense she was very distinct and innovative.\n\n\"Psycho Killer,\" \"You Sexy Things,\" Genius of Love\"\n\nLesh's classical background gave him a nice blueprint for being both the engine that made Grateful Dead's music go and the ability to explore the band's sound. His intellectual style, which brought together several genres of rock, takes hold of you on some of the Dead's finest songs.\n\n\"Fire on the Mountain,\" \"Shakedown Street,\" \"China Cat Sunflower\"\n\nThere's a good chance your favorite bassist was influenced by Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, who played on thousands of iconic recordings as a session musician for Stax. Dunn was an essential part of some of the greatest songs of all time by artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Eddie Floyd and many others.\n\n\"Soul Man,\" \"Knock on Wood,\" \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\"\n\nConsidered by many to be the greatest heavy metal bass player of all time, Geezer Butler had a way of turning the instrument into a force of nature rather than just the source of a groove. Metal bass playing starts (and for some, ends) here in all its sinister glory.\n\n\"N.I.B.,\" \"War Pigs,\" \"Symptom of the Universe\"\n\nYou know you're weird when James Brown kicks you out of his band for being a bit too crazy. Before getting the boot, Collins established himself as a premier funk bassist on songs like \"Super Bad\" and \"Soul Power.\" Collins then found a home with Parliament and Funkadelic, where he created stunning works like \"Tear the Roof Off the Sucker (Give Up the Funk)\" and \"One Nation Under a Groove.\"\n\n\"Super Bad,\" \"One Nation Under a Groove,\" \"Bootzilla\"\n\nOver the course of just three Metallica albums before his death, Cliff Burton dazzled the metal world. There was nothing like him. His playing on the beginning of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is otherworldly, while \"Orion\" still brings about chills. But it's \"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)\" remains Burton's magnum opus. Burton is probably the most skilled metal bassist who ever lived.\n\n\"Orion,\" \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" \"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)\"\n\nYes' bass sound in the hands of Chris Squire was unlike anything the world of progressive rock had heard. It was as if he was creating an entirely new sound when you listen to a song like \"Roundabout.\" And whether it was \"Close to the Edge,\" \"Starship Trooper\" or \"The Gates of Delirium,\" Squire was always taking things to the next level. He is what you think of when you're talking musical genius on the bass.\n\n\"Roundabout,\" \"The Gates of Delirium,\" \"Starship Trooper\"\n\nJohn Paul Jones redefined hard rock and blues bass playing. He was the most underrated member of of Led Zeppelin but just as essential as his bandmates. \"Dazed and Confused\" is the ultimate acid trip, while \"Ramble On\" serves as the song every bassist wants to play, but can't. JPJ was one of a kind, even if every future bass player wanted to be him.\n\n\"The Lemon Song,\" \"Ramble On,\" \"Dazed and Confused\"\n\nInspired by the Motown playing of James Jamerson, Jack Bruce was classically trained in the upright bass. But when he joined Cream, it was Bruce's job to use the electric bass to bring the band's sound together. He changed the game when it came to playing blues in a hard, forward-thinking manor with slick solos that would make Cream one of the influential bands all time.\n\n\"White Room,\" \"Politician,\" \"Apostrophe\" (Frank Zappa), \"\n\nThe man known simply as Flea. Early on with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea slapped the heck out of the bass, redefining the technique (See the band's cover of \"Higher Ground\"). As time went on, his style got more mature and thicker, best exemplified by the Chili Pepper's greatest album \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\" three decades has made him, arguably, the most respected modern day bassist around.\n\n\"Higher Ground,\" \"Give It Away,\" \"Around the World,\" \"Aeroplane\"\n\nThe face of progressive rock bass playing, Geddy Lee could really do it all for a band that reached for the stars in Rush. When you focus in on his bass playing, Lee's style was extremely complex and technical. But it never alienated fans, instead drawing them in with such a distinguished, catchy sound. It's quite mind-boggling when you think about it, which is why there's never been anyone like him.\n\n\"XYZ,\" \"Hemispheres,\" \"Cygnus X-1,\" \"Digital Man\"\n\nBy using his thumb to hit the electric bass, Larry Graham forever changed the instrument and made it almost as appealing to aspiring musicians as the guitar. In that sense, Graham was the Hendrix of the bass. And the beneficiary was Sly & the Family Stone, which rode Graham's bass lines to funk glory. Building on that, Graham's later career work would prove essential to the modern sounds of R&B.\n\nEssential tracks: \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\" \"Hair\" (Graham Central Station), \"The Jam\" (Graham Central Station)\n\nAll those progressive rock bassists you've loved that we've celebrated here got their style from John Entwistle, the blueprint for the lead rock bassist. Entwistle used innovative techniques to expand the instrument's capabilities, much like his counterpart in The Who, Pete Townshend, did with guitar. His soloing on \"My Generation\" was game changing, while his unique style on \"The Real Me\" is all-consuming. Entwistle laid the groundwork for so much of the future.\n\n\"The Real Me,\" \"My Generation,\" \"Sparks\"\n\nThe most influential bassist of all time and it's not even close. Jamerson, aka Funk Brother #1, showed the music world how to create a bass line on hits for Motown artists, from Marvin Gaye and The Supremes to Stevie Wonder and The Temptations. More technically driven bassists would take the instrument to new heights with tone, style and improvisation over the next several decades. But the art of playing bass on ANY song begins with Jamerson.\n\n\"Bernadette,\" \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" \"Get Ready,\" \"What's Going On,\" \"My Girl\"\n\nJamerson's influence reigns supreme, while players like Entwistle and Bruce proved insanely innovative. But in Paul McCartney's case, he was redefining bass playing in popular music in real time. With every single The Beatles released, the art of bass playing (and music in general) changed. Of course, the world was watching and consuming it in record numbers. But even ignoring the Beatles craze, the music is staggering from a technical standpoint. McCartney was crafting unique structures on \"Come Together,\" \"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds,\" \"Something\" and \"Paperback Writer,\" while having them still be among the catchiest songs ever written.\n\n\"Something,\" \"Taxman,\" \"Paperback Writer,\" \"Come Together\""
