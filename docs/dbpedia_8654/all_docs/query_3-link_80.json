        "text": "This text analyses different aspects of Radiohead’s fifth album, Amnesiac (2001). Radiohead is a fundamental reference to understand the development and study of popular music throughout the last thirty years in the context of the Internet era. The use of different music styles in their albums and the prominent presence of technology in the production and the musical performance are some of these aspects. These elements, along with the creation of a critical discourse towards the economic system they belong to, make Radiohead a key object of study in order to understand the development of popular music at the end of the 20th century. This text establish the presence of these different parameters found on Amnesiac (2001), such as authenticity, technology and musical postmodernism. Lastly, there is an analysis of Stanley Donwood artwork in Amnesiac, which can be related to different aspects of Radiohead's aesthetic evolution since their first album, Pablo Honey (1993).\n\nOk Computer and Kid A are the two most significant albums in the discography of Radiohead. These two albums represent a distinct boundary point in Radiohead’s career; between the derivative, alternative rock style of their formative years and the intellectually complex, experimental and eclectic artistic identity of their latter. However, these albums also mark the beginning of Radiohead’s embrace of the intellectual aesthetic that defines contemporary culture; postmodernism. In this investigation, I define the manifestation of postmodernism in these two albums, analysing their highly contrasting interpretations of the style and critically analysing the negative and positive effects of Radiohead’s embrace of the postmodernist aesthetic. I begin by attempting to define the intricate intellectual character of postmodernism, defining its historical origin and initial artistic emergence in the late 20th Century. Using this definition as an initial framework for my investigation, I then begin my analysis of Radiohead’s third album, Ok Computer. Having defined the distinct differences between ‘postmodernism’ and ‘postmodernity’, I first explore the album’s narrative and consider whether Yorke portrays a postmodernist ideological standpoint on its themes. I proceed by exploring the album’s aesthetic presentation, identifying the utilisation of a bricolage approach to aesthetics and the use of intertextuality in the construction of narrative and composition. I then begin an exploration of Ok Computer’s successor, Kid A. Investigating its embrace of poststructuralist thinking, bricolage aesthetics and anti-aesthetics, I explain that while Postmodernist, Kid A is an extremely contrasting interpretation of the style to its predecessor. In the face of its obscure intellectual, artistic and musical character, I attempt to identify the existence of a decipherable underlying narrative and to classify it stylistically with more precision. In the final phase of the investigation, I construct a critical analysis of the successes and failures of Radiohead’s embrace of postmodernism. Applying an array of critiques of the style, I consider whether and the extent to which Ok Computer and Kid A embody or defy these critiques, and whether postmodernism had a positive impact upon the artistic development of Radiohead.\n\nThis article explores the response of the British rock group Radiohead to the almost fatal creative paralysis that resulted from the enormous success and critical attention generated by their 1997 landmark recording Ok Computer. This adaptive response consisted of a vast effort to recreate and reidentify themselves, by way of a recon-figuration of both their artistic and commercial technological extensions, in an exis-tential struggle to maintain an ongoing sense of authenticity. In his groundbreaking book Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, Marshall McLuhan (1964/1994) notes that we will eventually have to recognize education as \" civil defense against media fallout \" (p. 333). It was clear for McLuhan that essential for psychic and social survival in the contemporary age would be the successful navigation of the continuously accelerating bully-blow of technological change, what economist Joseph Schumpeter (1966) characterizes as advanced capitalism's extraordinary powers of \" creative destruction. \" In other words, given the constant flux in how our experience of the world is mediated, we require the ability to map and give shape to the environments our media create, so that we are best able to optimize our interface with them at both the individual and collective levels. McLuhan posits that \" artists \" are generally among the most adept in society when it comes to recognizing these subliminal environments, and I have attempted elsewhere (Rose, 2009) to illustrate how attuned the members of the British rock group EME_10.1&2_Rose_75-90.indd 75 EME_10.1&2_Rose_75-90.indd 75\n\nToday’s music scene, rather the industrial marketing mechanisms orchestrating the music scene, perpetuates segregation in music. However, such marketing belies the more permeable boundaries between genres or that elements of “black” music still exist in rock or that “white” elements exist in hip hop. One example of black musical elements in a “rock” song is Radiohead’s “Bloom” the first track from The King of Limbs (TKOL) released in 2011. Any Radiohead fan can assert that part of the band’s popular and critical appeal is their ability to layer sound, creating textured musical experiences. This architectural sound is taken a step further in “Bloom” which has a West African inspired rhythmic arrangement with an anchoring beat at the core and an overlaying of related beats and rhythms. Not only does this destabilize boundaries maintained by the marketing machine of the music industry, but it also raises some interesting cross cultural possibilities as to how the song might function. For example, given the multiple functions of West African music as political/social/spiritual productions, what insights might one gain by analyzing “Bloom” as a spiritual/psychic experience, especially from an African world view? This paper will examine the structure of “Bloom” using J.H. Kwabena Nketia’s explanation of West African composition theory and explore the spiritual experience of “Bloom” using Wole Soyinka’s theory of the “fourth stage” and the Bantu philosophy of vital force to illustrate the artificialness of the categories into which we place music and cultures.\n\nThis article presents itself as a Deleuzo-Guattarian review of Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, re-released this year in an expanded form (as 'OKNOTOK 1997-2017') including archival material bringing to light hidden facets of the album and recording process. As indicated by the title of the re-release, the album's prescience has taken twenty years to unfold. What I argue is that its relevance today and importance given our current political situation can be traced back to a logic of sensation operative in the work and training its sights on what Deleuze and Guattari call 'communication' or 'control societies'. To resist the global extension of the latter, it is incumbent upon art, as the discipline that thinks through sensation not communication, to construct a new or counter-earth. The album achieves this, I argue, by staging and enacting a becoming-moth. This becoming-moth is targeted precisely at the forces recoded as data in the 'dividual' of control societies, which this becoming materialises as sensation and, more fundamentally, which it expresses as a cosmic event or inorganic life.\n\nToday's music scene, perpetuates segregation in music.

The band released their seventh album In Rainbows on the 10 October 2007 as a digital download for which consumers chose their own price: beginning at nothing. The issue of whether this example presents a model for other artists to bypass established record labels will be explored. This article will also use this discussion to look more broadly at how artist managers create marketing strategies that involve new technologies and in doing so it will address various issues concerning the future management and control of the ﬁve key income stream groups stemming from contemporary music in the digital age. While Radiohead are in a position to be able to control all of their own income streams, they have only gotten into this position as a result of the old system."
