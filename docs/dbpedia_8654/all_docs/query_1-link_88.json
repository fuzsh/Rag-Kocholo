        "text": "I had a blog recommendation from my musician son Kieran the other day. He observed that he’d never seen Radiohead on my website and suggested I post one. He even sent a list of a few. So how could I refuse, right?\n\nI recall buying and exploring music of the English alternative rock band over a decade ago and liked their albums OK Computer (1997) and In Rainbows (2007). A former colleague and I talked about them and said if I liked those two, I’d really enjoy the then-newly-released The King of Limbs (2011). I don’t remember why, but there was something about the vibe of it that didn’t mesh with me. I occasionally listen to Radiohead’s music but haven’t spent enough time learning about them.\n\nInterestingly, Sweety and I were looking for a new program to watch last night as we’d finished Netflix’s Bridgerton and had started a show on Britbox, but it wasn’t revving either of us up, so we looked for something else. We found Imposters (also Netflix) and watched the first two episodes. It’s funny, poignant and quirky all at the same time. I think it was during the second episode that a familiar voice came on in a piece of music from the soundtrack; it was Thom Yorke (b. 1968), Radiohead’s guitarist, keyboardist and main singer/songwriter. So I thought, okay, the universe is sending a message here…\n\nSo, calling up the lad’s list today, I looked at a few songs and landed on today’s selection, which I’ve always found a powerfully melancholic piece. I wanted to know more about the track and consulted SongFacts.com. I didn’t know until reading their writeup that Radiohead wrote it for Romeo + Juliet, Australian director Baz Luhrmann’s (b. 1962) film adaptation of William Shakespeare’s (1564-1616) play Romeo and Juliet. I know the film well (or so I thought), but honestly, I don’t remember this song playing at its tragic ending. I’ve been thinking it is time to rewatch this film, as I loved the combination of the modern-times dramatic interpretation with the original Shakespearean verse.\n\nSongfacts says of the song, “This was written for the 1996 movie Romeo and Juliet starring Leonardo Di Caprio (and Claire Danes). While Radiohead were on tour with Alanis Morissette, Baz Luhrmann, who directed the movie, sent them a tape of the last part of the film and asked them to write some music for the closing credits (hence the name “exit music”). The band liked what they saw and came up with this.” The site continues, “The story in the song is about Romeo and Juliet, and their chance of romantic escape. Unfortunately, you can’t change literature, and they don’t make it. As the song says… ‘Now we are one, In everlasting peace.'” And finally, “Radiohead also contributed ‘Talk Show Host’ to the movie, which was used in a scene when Romeo is first spotted.”\n\n“Wake from your sleep\n\nThe drying of your tears\n\nToday we escape, we escape\n\nPack and get dressed\n\nBefore your father hears us\n\nBefore all hell breaks loose\n\nBreathe, keep breathing\n\nDon’t lose your nerve\n\nBreathe, keep breathing\n\nI can’t do this alone\n\nSing us a song\n\nA song to keep us warm\n\nThere’s such a chill\n\nSuch a chill\n\nAnd you can laugh a spineless laugh\n\nWe hope your rules and wisdom choke you\n\nNow we are one in everlasting peace\n\nWe hope that you choke, that you choke\n\nWe hope that you choke\n\nThat you choke\n\nWe hope that you choke\n\nThat you choke”\n\n“Exit Music (For a Film),” by Philip Selway, Jonny Greenwood, Colin Greenwood, Ed O’Brien and Thom Yorke.\n\nLyrics retrieved from AZLyrics.com.\n\nWhen thinking of the film, the song is a powerful exit that captures the storyline of the lovers dying solely because of the feud between their families; an attitude that doomed their love from its innocent, delicate and hopeful start. The inconsolable and resentful sorrowfulness of the piece is a harsh condemnation of the parents’ rigid and soulless outlook, which sentences them to a lifetime of imprisonment in misery, knowing full well they caused their children’s deaths (as stated from the perspective of the dead lovers, “And you can laugh a spineless laugh / We hope your rules and wisdom choke you / Now we are one in everlasting peace / We hope that you choke, that you choke”).\n\nRadiohead formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The original lineup is still active, a rare achievement for a band that has evolved through musical and production styles during nearly forty years together.\n\n“Exit Music (For a Film)” comes from Radiohead’s third studio album, OK Computer. Another track on the album, “No Surprises,” always brings to mind a mantra repeated ad nauseam by an executive I worked under many years back, referring to the need to ensure his superiors didn’t learn of bad news by reading it in the newspaper. “Thanks, Captain Obvious,” I’d think to myself, an exception to my personal pledge of resisting the use of sarcasm.\n\nNow you know a little about why this is my Song of the Day for Today. Thanks for joining me here.\n\nHere is the audio from the Radiohead YouTube channel:\n\nRemembering,\n\nSteve"
