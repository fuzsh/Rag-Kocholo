        "text": "Having heard quite a few covers of Creep by artists such as Chrissie Hynde and Roland Orzabal, this is definitively one of them. I thought the Radio Eds dispatched it with pitiless ease.\n\nI loved the revelatory interplay of banjo and trombone, lending the song some jug-band bathos. Katrina Dixon's drumming reminded me at points of Low's Mimi Parker in its sparse, haunting percussion. The guitar and bass were servicable, chugging along perfectly amicably, although I missed my brother's shredding guitar stabs.\n\nI thought it was great that the singer, Ed, felt confident enough to have fun with the vocal part and add a whole range of emotive expectorations, and extra vowels, which certainly added to the sound of the band. He has the dress, posture and phrasing of a true frontman.\n\nMy favourite performance of the lot was the unshowy yet commanding piano work by Alan â€“ he held it all together and led the way for the others to follow. Without his obvious musical gifts it might have all fallen apart. I'd say he certainly has a future in live music, and I would happily ask to go on a guest list to see him play again.\n\nI read recently about a tribute band festival called Glastonbudget and wondered if the Radio Eds would consider building on their success so far, and taking it to the next level?"
