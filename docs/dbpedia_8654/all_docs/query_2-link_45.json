        "text": "Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood will reflect on the band’s history with How To Disappear – A Portrait of Radiohead, out Oct. 15.\n\nThe announcement arrives two months after Greenwood joined Instagram, where his first few posts featured his dogs and a pencil sharpener. In the announcement of How to Disappear, Greenwood included a portrait of Thom Yorke in his “Lotus Flower” hat — which the frontman auctioned off for charity in 2020 — as well as photos of his brother and bandmate Jonny Greenwood, drummer Phil Selway, and guitarist Ed O’Brien.\n\n“I’ve been taking photographs of my fellow band members for many years, and I’m very happy to have put together a selection of images that describes how we’ve spent much of our time together; writing, rehearsing, recording and performing,” Greenwood wrote. “I’ve also written an essay that attempts to thread these pictures together into a portrait of my band from its less certain middle years to now. I hope that anyone who likes our music will enjoy it, as much as I did putting these two decades’ worth of memories together.”\n\nTrending\n\nGreenwood also announced an autographed limited edition version of the book, which includes 32 “light show” photographs. You can pre-order this, as well as the standard edition, here."
