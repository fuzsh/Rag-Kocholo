        "text": "It doesn’t matter that Radiohead followed up the 1993 hit with several other major and (more often than not) minor hits including “Karma Police”, “High and Dry” and “There There”. It doesn’t matter that their 1997 album OK Computer is one of the most acclaimed albums of their ‘90s. It also doesn’t matter that both Rolling Stone and Pitchfork named their 2000 album Kid A as the best album of the ‘00s.\n\nThey’re still the “Creep” band. Maybe that’s not a bad thing. Despite Radiohead (and their fans) distancing themselves from the song for years, it’s a legitimate banger. It remains an excellent max-volume sing-along.\n\nThat’s the rub with bands like Radiohead. Their Mount Rushmore songs tend to overshadow a catalog full of fantastic, lesser-known tunes. The Radiohead well runs deep. Some of these were released as single B-sides or on EPs. Others were simply overshadowed on studio albums.\n\nLet’s go beyond “Creep” and “Karma Police” and “No Surprises” to look at some less-appreciated Radiohead songs.\n\nThom Yorke's music is highly emotional while rarely feeling very personal. Listeners seldom get a look behind the curtain. For that reason, when he refers to himself by name—\"You've been stuck in a lift. We've been trying to reach you, Thom\"—it is one of the most transparent and moving moments in the band's catalog. \"Lift\" had the potential to be a Brit-pop smash— conventional alt-rock with a booming chorus—which is probably why they shelved it for nearly 21 years. Nevertheless, it gained a following among fans as a bootleg favorite."
