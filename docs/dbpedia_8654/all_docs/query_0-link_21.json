Over the course of 136 pages, it documents the band’s “middle years” from 2003 through their latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool, in 2016.\n\nIn addition to 97 photographs, most of which are previously unseen, the hardback book contains a 10,000-word essay written by Greenwood.\n\n‘For years now, I’ve been taking fugitive snaps of my band, Radiohead,” Greenwood says in a statement. “I’ve tried to catch out my friends with my small black Yashica T4 Super. On stage and in the rehearsal studio, they are so lost in their own moment of performance that they don’t see me with the camera.”\n\nRelated Video"
