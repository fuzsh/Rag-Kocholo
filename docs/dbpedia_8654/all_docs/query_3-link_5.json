        "text": "Talk Show Host is the second song from Radiohead's 1996 single, Street Spirit (Fade Out).\n\nHistory[]\n\nOne of Radiohead’s most popular B-Sides, Talk Show Host first appeared on the Street Spirit (Fade Out) single and featured the band trying a “trip-hop” style, reminiscent of Portishead’s debut album, Dummy.\n\nThe track was ultimately remixed for Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet, and released on the immensely popular soundtrack album. This version, called the 'Nellee Hooper remix', was less guitar driven than the original B-side and included various atmospheric sounds. There is also a 'Black Dog remix' with distorted tempos.\n\nMany of Radiohead’s live shows in 1997 featured this song in yet another incarnation that featured a longer guitar driven ending and Jonny Greenwood’s keyboards.\n\nLyrics[]\n\n[Verse 1] I want to I want to be someone else or I'll explode Floating upon the surface for The birds, the birds The birds [Verse 2] You want me? Fucking well come and find me I'll be waiting With a gun and a pack of sandwiches And nothing, nothing Nothing, nothing [Verse 3] You want me? Well, come on and break the door down You want me? Fucking come on and break the door down I'm ready, I'm ready I'm reeaaady I'm reeaaaaady I'm reeaaady I'm reeaaady"
