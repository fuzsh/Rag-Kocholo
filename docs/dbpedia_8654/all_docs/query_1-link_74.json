        "text": "Song Writing and Music Styles\n\nRadiohead songs usually begin as a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the rest of the band develop their parts. Whereas Yorke has never learnt to read sheet music, Greenwood is trained in music theory. In Pitchfork, Ryan Dombal wrote that \"the duo's left brain-right brain dynamic has proven to be one of the most adventurous in rock history\". While Jonny Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O'Brien often creates ambient effects, making extensive use of effects units. Many Radiohead songs use pivot notes and pedal points, creating \"looser, roomier\" harmonies and a \"bittersweet, doomy\" feeling.\n\nThe first years\n\nThe members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.\n\nThe band disliked the school's strict atmosphere, the headmaster once charged them for using a rehearsal room on a Sunday and found solace in the music department. They credited their music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, and 20th-century classical music.\n\nIn the beginning, all the band members wrote songs, but Yorke eventually became the main songwriter. They chose their instruments because they wanted to play together, not because they were particularly interested in them individually. They started as a band called On a Friday and played their first show in 1987. Despite getting offered a record deal early on, they decided to go to university first. They reunited in Oxford in 1991, recorded a demo that got attention, and eventually signed with EMI. They changed their name to Radiohead at EMI's request, taking inspiration from a Talking Heads song."
