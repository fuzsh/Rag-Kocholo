        "text": "I don't know about you, but I always assume that everyone in the world - or at least those of us in this music world that we're all in - knows that Kraftwerk are in the area of being the greatest pop group ever. I use the word \"pop\" as you would if describing the work of anyone from Bang on a Can to Battles or the Monkees to Aphex Twin. I say they're the greatest, because of the way they used electronics to express through the fluent bliss of melody and the consoling consistency of groove the oddest, loveliest details of what it is to be human, alive at a moment when we're well on the way to becoming electronic communication assistants endlessly tracking and cross-referencing our motions and emotions.\n\nWhen the time comes to work out the 10 or so acts that caused music to surge forward during the 20th century by establishing a sound and a sensibility, with connected image and mystique, that had a profound influence on how music changed shape, texture, direction, presence, as both an ethereal and a matter-of-fact thing, as a fuel for parties and a mood for contemplation, then Kraftwerk are on that list.\n\nBelgian electro-extremists Front 242 said Kraftwerk's music was \"impossible to touch\", and that's what made it touch so much other music. How to explain what it was they did? How to explain the treacherous beauty, the deadpan otherworldliness, the scrupulous, aching, heartbreaking compensation for a catastrophic mid-20th-century Germanic collapse of reason?\n\nThe Human League, Grandmaster Flash, Depeche Mode, Afrika Bambaataa - they all tried to explain the music, its esoteric production and exotic separation from everything else at the time, in their own way, whether in Basildon, Sheffield or the Bronx, and musicians are still trying to explain it, and use those diagnostic techniques to turn pop music into a surreal combination of the pleasurable and the improbable.\n\nI love the fact that Kraftwerk - as discreet, cryptic German neo-academics, keeping themselves to themselves in a laboratory of their own design, fascinated with the pure sound of sound, as in love with melody as Ornette Coleman or Franz Schubert - had such an impact on the way hip-hop and techno turntablists discovering brand new means of production processed and reprocessed the transformative, mind-blowing groove, finding in Kraftwerk, these outsiders exiled from being allowed to belong, a key to ecstasy.\n\nEventually, every progressive-minded genre inevitably gets infected by Kraftwerk's poised, perfectionist calculations, and \"tronica\" even gets added to folk - Tunng imagining a world where the Incredible String Band employed static interference and drum machines.\n\nI love the fact Kraftwerk have retained an eerie anonymity even as the brand has developed, self-adapting to cope with the demands of the modern age, growing in power as the true nature of their demure clairvoyance becomes increasingly apparent. Although there is only one original member (Ralf HÃ¼tter) still travelling the Earth with the group in a suitcase, they could easily carry on throughout the 21st century with none of the original members participating, just as an ensemble of wires, programmes, apps, images, memories, trackers, scanners, impulses and screens. There could be a Kraftwerk operating at the end of the century, fresher than ever, their unaltered sound passing through whatever communities are like in that day and age in whatever way sound is distributed. Music possessing all the grace and immensity of classical music, a futuristic folk music that communicates intermittent emotional impressions of what we were thinking as computers began to control us by making us think we were in control.\n\nSo thinking that everyone, especially those interested in the more experimental side of pop music would favour, indeed worship, the workings of Kraftwerk, I was mostly shocked when Colin Greenwood, the Radiohead drummer, told me recently that his brother, Jonny, the band's guitarist, was never really a Kraftwerk fan.\n\nColin told me how his brother had never been much of a fan of electronic music because it was not \"beautiful\", but had been swayed during the recent Radiohead/Kraftwerk tour of South America. Apparently Jonny detected a link between the manner and stylings of Kraftwerk and the light entertainment musical director of the BBC in the 60s, Ronnie Hazlehurst, who wrote incidental music for It's a Knockout and the theme tunes for Blankety Blank, The Generation Game, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, Yes Minister and Are You Being Served? (think of those cash tills).\n\nIt made a kind of sense. Kraftwerk as the writers of irresistible theme tunes for imaginary, era-defining German sitcoms, geniuses at capturing mood and compressing eccentrically catchy musical ideas into an appropriately stimulating shape. It made me appreciate the perplexing wonder of Kraftwerk even more, marvel at the miracle of their immense influence on progressive black dance music, avant-garde pop and nerdy experimental electronic music. It also made me wish we lived in a society so advanced and Kraftwerk/Ballardian civilised that Jonny Greenwood was not simply the \"BBC composer in residence\" but actually the current light entertainment musical director at the BBC."
