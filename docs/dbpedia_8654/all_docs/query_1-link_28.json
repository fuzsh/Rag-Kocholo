Set for October 15, How to Disappear covers 2003 to 2016. Greenwood calls it the band’s “middle years.” The book mixes backstage shots, live action, and casual moments with essays.\n\nFrom Bass to Camera\n\nGreenwood, mainly on bass, turns to photography. “I’ve been snapping shots of Radiohead,” he says. Using a Yashica T4 Super, he aims to capture the band’s unguarded moments. Whether rehearsing or performing, he documents their transformation of spaces from barns to arenas.\n\nRelated: The Bends Explored\n\nCrafted with Care\n\nDuncan White’s design work makes the book visually appealing.
