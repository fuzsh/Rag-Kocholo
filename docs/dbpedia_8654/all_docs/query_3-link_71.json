        "text": "Consequence’s Bass Week couldn’t have come to fruition without the help of some of our favorite bass players. After the survey, read the picks of 10 albums with great bass playing from Mr. Bungle’s Trevor Dunn, Death Cab for Cutie’s Nick Harmer, and Blu DeTiger, and don’t forget to check out our list of the 100 Greatest Bassists of All Time.\n\nAs we here at Consequence turn down our subwoofers and close out Bass Week, we wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who made it possible — the actual badass, motherfuckin’ bass players themselves. We couldn’t have pulled together such a celebration without the input of some of our favorite players, and so it’s time to let them speak for themselves.\n\nBelow are the unabridged survey answers we received when we turned to the experts and asked, “Who are the five people you consider the greatest bassists of all time, and why?” Not every single player mentioned made the final list, but every single one of them most certainly deserves their flowers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo join in on this low-end love circle and read who people like Cone McCaslin of Sum 41, Nestor Chumak of PUP, Julia Cumming of Sunflower Bean, Tobin Esperance of Papa Roach, and so many more think are some of the best to ever pick up a four-string.\n\nAlex Bleeker (Real Estate)\n\nJaco Pastorius: Technical ability.\n\nPaul McCartney: Endurance, legacy.\n\nPhil Lesh: Thrill of risk.\n\nSting: Business acumen.\n\nCharles Mingus: Innovation.\n\nAlexander Brown (Gatecreeper)\n\nICS Vortex: The most badass bassist in black metal. Not only a spectacular player, which is displayed across his career with all of the legendary bands he’s played with, but also has the voice of a fallen angel and the sickest onstage swag.\n\nWill Rahmer: Sickest bass sound in extreme metal! Total necrosound approach to the bass with that super scooped and fuzzed-out tone that peaks over the guitars in the mix. 666!\n\nJoey DeMaio: Probably the most unique and inventive player on this list — tunes his bass an octave up and essentially plays as a rhythm guitar. However, dude’s got chops up there with all the six string godz and shreds like a psycho. And at unbelievable speeds! Joey plays with honor.\n\nMarkus Grosskopf : Tied with the next bassist on this list for having some of the best composed basslines in metal, Markus works synergistically with the guitars to create a sort of neoclassical power metal sound that’s uniquely his own. The trademark bass runs and tails to riffs he deploys which seamlessly tie sections in song together have left a colossal imprint on the genre that can be heard on countless records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Harris: Not much to add here that hasn’t been stated — Steve is THE nwobhm bassist. He’s got the sick-ass galloping, thoughtfully complements all the sick shit going on with the guitars, and looks really badass. Speaking of which, I was just jamming the criminally slept on Dance of Death record the other day, and that title track has some of the sickest bass parts ever! So epic!\n\nAudrey Zee Whitesides (Speedy Ortiz)\n\nCarol Kaye: I don’t even know how I would think about the instrument without her emotionally evocative, harmonically dynamic lines. Every good thing everyone’s said about her should be said a thousand times more.\n\nMike Watt: The reason I bought a bass. Model for how to approach it as an equal part of the band and share space while still having a voice.\n\nMike Mills: Some of the most memorable melodies on those early REM records are Mills on bass, as much as any vocal or guitar ones. Ridiculously fun to play along to.\n\nRichard Davis: The bass solos on the Andrew Hill records he plays on are absolutely next level, maybe the best I’ve ever heard. All his work with any artist is great, but he has such a singular voice that comes through whenever he’s looking for it to pop out of the mix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatomi Matsuzaki: Deerhoof is one of the most consistently innovative bands I know, and even Satomi’s technically simplest lines are vital and thoughtful, moving the music forward to new places. Bass is an instrument that shines when it talks with other instruments, and she’s always finding the exact context to play with that.\n\nBen Stidworthy (Cola/Ought/Brooch)\n\nCharles Mingus: The real king. All aspects from musicianship to composition to innovation are close to peerless.\n\nRay Brown: I rinsed so many Oscar Peterson records that he’s forever in my head. A true team-player.\n\nPaul Simonon: A vibe-icon zen-God of the bass\n\nKim Gordon: A world-beating bassist who also happens to be good at everything.\n\nPhilip Frobos: Melodic-bass king, with the added complication of singing.\n\nBlue DeTiger\n\nBernard Edwards: His sense of melody, bassline composition, and feel on the bass is one of a kind.\n\nJames Jamerson: His Motown finger style playing can be heard in so many after him.\n\nJaco Pastorious: Jaco elevated and revolutionized the way the bass could be played and used. His use of harmonics and solo bass compositions inspired so many after him.\n\nMarcus Miller: Marcus is one of the best slap bass players out there. His tone is unmatched.\n\nLarry Graham: Larry contributed greatly to the evolution of the instrument by introducing slap bass more into the mainstream culture."
