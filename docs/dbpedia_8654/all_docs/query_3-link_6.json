        "text": "I have no idea what kind of music Radiohead makes.\n\nI know the songs, the albums, intimately. The English band has been a major part of my soundtrack for the last twenty years of my life.\n\nAs for what genre Radiohead belongs to at this point in the band’s life, I have no idea. This is no longer a rock band. The group will occasionally put out a rock song — there were several on the band’s sublime 2007 record In Rainbows — but even then, that wasn’t a rock album. Nor is their new album A Moon Shaped Pool, which was released digitally on Sunday and is now available on iTunes, Google Play, and the band’s website.\n\nThis is an album that resists easy categorization. It’s not a rock record. It’s not an electronica record, not really. I hesitate to call this pop music.\n\nWhat it sounds like is someone having an extremely funky nervous breakdown.\n\nA lot of early reviews for A Moon Shaped Pool focused on lead singer Thom Yorke’s recent breakup with his longtime girlfriend, Rachel Owen. It’s an understandable link — Yorke has always written lyrics that are difficult to grasp, and such a major autobiographical event provides a handhold that many people listening to the album couldn’t resist.\n\nI’ll admit my mind immediately went there first as well. When you hear lyrics about “Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside” or “Broken hearts make it rain” on Identikit, it’s hard not to make the leap.\n\nBut it’s also important to remember that Yorke has been writing songs about loneliness, despair and hysteria for 20 years. This album could be read as a tribute to a lost lover, but there are just as many lyrics here that seem to connect to classic Radiohead themes — fear of a growing police state, the terror that technology is corroding human connections. And trying to paint this as a reactionary album to the breakup runs into another problem when you realize the album’s final song, True Love Waits, was first performed live by the band in 1995.\n\nI highly doubt Thom Yorke will ever come out and say one way or the other what he wrote these words about. And while it’s simplistic to call this a pure heartbreak album, I think it’d be equally as silly to ignore the fact that it occurred.\n\nAs for the other members of the band, they’re still making some of the most sonically adventurous and compelling music out there. The first word that jumped into my mind when I heard A Moon Shaped Pool was cinematic, which makes sense given Jonny Greenwood’s recent solo work writing and producing film scores. Greenwood has long abandoned making music that sounds like much of anything else, and what he does better than anyone is what the great score composers do: Create sounds that capture a feeling, a mood. On this album, the feelings are those of panic (Burn the Witch, Ful Stop) dreaminess (Identikit) and, yes, heartbreak (Daydreaming, True Love Waits.)\n\nA track-by-track review of ‘A Moon Shaped Pool’\n\nWhat has always made Radiohead so compelling and, yes, listenable as a band is that they have a rhythm section that tethers these ambitious sounds. While Yorke wails and Jonny Greenwood creates an ever-shifting atmosphere, bassist Colin Greenwood and drummer Philip Selway provide the ground upon which we can stabilize. The beats are funky, the bass lines tight, and while this album occasionally feels like its losing its head, we never spin off. That beat keeps us connected. It keeps us moving.\n\nLike everything Radiohead has ever done, this is a wonderfully — and willfully — weird album. Why they decided to order the tracks alphabetically is a question that I suspect will never be answered. Their decision to make the first two singles the first two songs off the album could be a statement about the way to appreciate this album, or it could mean nothing at all. The bizarre singalong in the middle of Identikit is as inexplicable as it is kinda funny.\n\nThis is what a Radiohead album sounds like now. It’s insular and strange and dance-y and sad. There are few moments that grab you quickly. There aren’t any radio hits. This isn’t The Bends. It’s not even OK Computer. It requires a bit of work, and I understand how that might be a turn off for some people.\n\nBut if you’re willing to put the work in, this is a record that has moments that will dig their way under your skin.\n\nWhile everyone quickly seized on album closer True Love Waits as this album’s lasting statement, I keep finding myself returning to Present Tense. Over a dance beat and a clean guitar line, Yorke sings in his trademark falsetto about getting over despair. Or trying to, anyway. And he sings something that I feel is perhaps the best bit of life advice he’s ever given:"
