        "text": "The Jericho Tavern – Oxford\n\nOur first gig before we were signed was at the Jericho Tavern in 1988, back when we were called On a Friday. It was club Avocado Night and we were part of a four-band bill, two of which were the same band with a different name. We had a horn section and I split a six-pack of Fosters with the sax player in the park beforehand, just to stave off nerves. I don’t do that anymore before a show, otherwise I’d be a raging alcoholic. A few years later, 30 A&R guys, who were all wearing 501s and biker boots, came to see us play in the same venue. The scene in Oxford at that venue in the 1990s was amazing – Swervedriver, Ride, Supergrass and The Candyskins – everyone was very supportive of each other.\n\nThe Zodiac – Oxford\n\nNow called the O2 Academy Oxford, when we played this club it felt like a step up from the Jericho. We filmed the video for Creep in there in 1992, playing two shows: the morning one was an all-ages show with 11-year-olds pogoing and their parents stood against the wall waiting for them to go home, and the later show in the evening had an older crowd. We went on a US tour after that video came out. As it was on heavy rotation, it felt like everywhere we went there was a little bit of Oxford with us.\n\n9:30 Club – Washington\n\nSome of my favourite Radiohead memories aren’t just from our British tours, but playing around the world. The 9.30 was round the back of the theatre where Lincoln was shot and it’s a really famous gig venue which isn’t there anymore, sadly. It’s where all the straight-edge bands such as Black Flag and Fugazi used to play and it’s really tiny. I remember there were rats running over the pipes and our sound engineer said it was one of the best-sounding gigs we’d ever played.\n\nMoles – Bath\n\nWe played Moles just after we recorded our first record. For some reason it was one of the few occasions where we decided to have a drink before we played, and we were so bad that our manager was watching and denied knowing who we were when people came up to him and asked. We got a proper dressing down afterwards. But that can happen sometimes, when you make a record and head out to perform it live: you think you know it really well but you have to learn it all over again.\n\nThe Tivoli Venue – Buckley\n\nThis place is an odd, glammed up nightclub with all of these pictures of glamour models sprawled over cars and balloons in the foyer. It was in the middle of nowhere in quite a scary part of the country where we once got fired at with air pistols. But this stage of our career where we travelled to strange towns around the country was the best part of our lives, I think; we would load up the van and drive up the motorway, our tour manager would give us £5 each and we got to go and explore the town before soundcheck. Nobody knew us from Adam. I remember one venue had a dressing room with boxes to put needles in after you’d finished with them. That’s really rock’n’roll. We thought: “I don’t remember that being on the rider! Maybe there was a cold meat and cheese platter, but we’re not dancing with Mr Brownstone tonight!” Still, it’s very considerate to do that."
