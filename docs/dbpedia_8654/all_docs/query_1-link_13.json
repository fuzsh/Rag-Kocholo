        "text": "Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds have announced the release of their 18th studio album, Wild God, scheduled for release on August 30th. The band has already given fans a glimpse of what to expect with the launch of the album’s title track. Nick Cave shared his personal experience with the album, stating, “I hope the album has the effect on listeners that it’s had on me. It bursts out of the speaker, and I get swept up with it. It’s a complicated record, but it’s also deeply and joyously infectious.”\n\nWild God consists of ten tracks and is described as a collaborative effort, produced by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, with David Fridmann handling the mixing duties. The initial writing phase commenced on New Year’s Day 2023, with recording sessions taking place at Miraval Studios in Provence, France, and Soundtree Studios in London, England. The band was joined by Radiohead’s Colin Greenwood, contributing bass performances, and Luis Almau on nylon string and acoustic guitars.\n\nNick Cave’s enthusiasm for the record is evident as he remarks, “Wild God… there’s no fucking around with this record. When it hits, it hits. It lifts you. It moves you. I love that about it.”\n\nWild God will be available through Bad Seed in collaboration with Play It Again Sam, with options for streaming, CD, and both standard and limited edition vinyl. This marks the band’s first album release since the critically acclaimed Ghosteen in 2019."
