I hope that anyone who likes our music will enjoy it, as much as I did putting these two decades’ worth of memories together.\"\n\n\"In addition to the standard book, there is a limited edition deluxe format autographed by me, with an additional 32 book of ‘light show’ photographs, housed together in a slipcase,\" he continued. Signed copies of the book will only be available for purchase via a pre-order."
