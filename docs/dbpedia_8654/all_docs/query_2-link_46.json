        "text": "BEST KNOWN AS: bassist and sometimes keyboardist of experimental-rock exemplars Radiohead\n\nTHE INTEL: Perhaps the most academically inclined member of Radiohead — as smart a group as you’ll ever find — Greenwood studied modern American literature at Cambridge. A voracious reader whom bandmate Thom Yorke once speculated had probably “downloaded a library,” he is reportedly a fan of such authors as Thomas Pynchon, V.S. Naipaul and Delmore Schwartz. In a Radiohead profile written by New Yorker music critic Alex Ross — another writer Greenwood admires — Colin called his band “the E.M. Forster of rock.”\n\nBRAINIAC RATING, ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 11: 8\n\nEXTRA CREDIT: In 2003, Greenwood, an amateur photographer, offered his takes on some of his favorite photographs for an exhibition at London’s famed Victoria and Albert Museum."
