        "text": "Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. They comprise Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.\n\nRadiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Manic Hedgehog, in 1992. Their second single, \"Creep\", was a worldwide hit, and their popularity and critical standing rose with Pablo Honey in 1993 and The Bends in 1995. Their fourth album, OK Computer (1997), is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music, with complex production and themes of modern alienation. Their fifth album and a double album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. Hail to the Thief (2003) and The Eraser (2004), with lyrics addressing the war on terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final albums for EMI.\n\nRadiohead self-released their eighth album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their ninth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. Their tenth album, A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Their eleventh and twelveth album, A Light for Attracting Attention (2022) and Wall of Eyes (2024), with more jazz, krautrock and progressive rock influences and a looser, wilder sound. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O'Brien have released solo albums.\n\nBy 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 140 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music acts of all time. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Eight Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: \"Creep\" (1992), \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" (1996), \"Paranoid Android\" (1997), \"Karma Police\" (1997), \"No Surprises\" (1998), \"Pyramid Song\" (2001), \"There There\" (2003) and \"Black Swan\" (2004). \"Creep\", \"Harrowdown Hill\" (2004) and \"Nude\" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019."
