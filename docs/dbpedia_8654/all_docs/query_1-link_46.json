        "text": "As a part of my Career Analysis series, I come across bands that have much too much material to focus on in just one article. Here, is the first in a series of 3 articles on Radiohead and their extensive back-catalogue which spans 20 years. This article will focus on 1993-1997, the second will encompass their work between 2000-2003 and the third and final piece will cover 2007-present.\n\nENJOY!\n\nFor a minute there, I lost myself…\n\nRadiohead have been one of the most commercially and critically successful groups in the history of music. Their back catalogue features 8 studio albums, 6 EPs, 28 singles, 39 music videos, 2 compilations, 1 live album, 1 remix album and 9 video releases. The band have enjoyed huge success and have managed to successfully reinvent their sound with each subsequent release. Between 1985 and 1994, the band were just a generic alternative rock band (influenced by the likes of Pixies and Siouxsie and the Banshees) and have now branched out to encompass all kinds of genres of music.\n\nBetween the years 1985 and 1991, Radiohead weren’t Radiohead. The band were named ‘On a Friday’ which was pretty self-explanatory as they had band practise on Fridays. Parlophone, their record label between 1992 and 2003 didn’t like the name so Thom, Jonny, Ed, Colin and Phil decided to name themselves after a Talking Heads track: “Radio Head”.\n\nPablo Honey (1993)\n\nBack in 1993 (when I was but one year old), we were nearing the end of the grunge movement. In Utero was just a year away, everyone was searching for a new sound. Radiohead didn’t really bring it, initially. They came at us with a depressing brand or alternative rock that got banned by Radio 1 and had people filling out The Astoria (as documented in the film Live at the Astoria). The popular highlight of Pablo Honey came in the form of “Creep” – a song the band now hate. It was a self deprecating anthem that uttered “I wish I was special” while declaring that the apple of Thom’s lazy eye was “just like an angel” and that her skin made him cry.\n\nThe sounds on the album weren’t revolutionary. They wore their influences on their sleeve and it meant that people instantly likened them to each and every one of them. The highlight of the album came with album opener “You” which, to this day, is the best exhibition of Thom’s vocal abilities.\n\nThe lyrics for the album are rather literal when compared to Thom’s later work. He sings about how “I’m not a vegetable” in “Vegetable”, about how “Anyone can play guitar” in “Anyone can play guitar” and how “It’s like the world is going to end so soon” in “You”. His work is nowhere near the heights it has reached, but there are moments of brilliance like “Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there / But I’m still no-one, and you’re not a star” from “Thinking About You”.\n\nThe highlight of the album, really, is the guitar work from Jonny Greenwood whose constant, apparent, disdain for his instrument sees him attacking his guitar with immeasurable ferocity. His virtuosity is present here – as it is on all of their guitar based records – and his solos are always something to look forward to.\n\nAlbum Rating\n\n6.5\n\nBetween the recording of Pablo Honey and, follow-up, The Bends, the band released single “Pop Is Dead”. This song was possibly their worst (a sentiment that Yorke mirrors). This was not a sound of things to come – in fact, it was more of a sound that HAD been before Pablo Honey. It refers to ‘pop’ as a person and states things like “So what pop is dead, it’s no great loss / So many facelifts, his face flew off”. It’s not the worst song you’ll here in this lifetime but it’s by no means a good one either.\n\nThe Bends (1995)\n\nThe band’s next record was a huge step in the right direction. At a Jeff Buckley concert (whose début album, Grace, I reviewed here) Thom realised that it can be manly to sing in a falsetto and it was possibly one of the most important epiphanies he’s had. Their sound changed dramatically, the textures of the music increased exponentially and the band’s song-writing came on in leaps and bounds.\n\nThe album featured “My Iron Lung” – a technically brilliant song – that featured great guitar work, amazing bass lines and metaphor laden lyrics eluding to their now-nemesis “Creep”, “Planet Telex” and “Bones” with layers of delay and phase-ridden guitars and fan-favourite “Street Spirit (Fade Out)” which apparently ‘wrote itself’ (an insight into the swollen levels of pretension that plagued Yorke’s mind. It was a great album.\n\nThe Bends strayed a little from the sound of Pablo Honey without scaring away their listeners and it showed a huge increase in maturity from the band. Jonny’s hatred for his beloved Telecaster continued to increase as his tortured instrument can he heard squealing and shouting throughout the record as he bashes it, hits and and destroys strings to create sounds many cannot make. It showed his talent for playing and improvisation but also allowed other instruments to shine.\n\nColin Greenwood (Jonny’s older brother and Radiohead’s bassist), one of the most underrated bassists around, also shows some flair in such songs as “The Bends” and “Just” and Thom’s silky vocals are allowed to shine in “Fake Plastic Trees” (a song he wrote after seeing the aforementioned Jeff Buckley concert).\n\nIt’s a fantastic album that turned out to be just a stepping-stone on the band’s way towards something amazing.\n\nAlbum Rating\n\n9.0\n\nBetween The Bends and OK Computer, Radiohead embarked on a tour and played to ever increasing audiences. They also wrote their first song for film – writing “Exit Music (For a Film)” (which would end up on OK Computer) for the 1996 interpretation of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ starring the omnipotent Leonardo DiCaprio. They also wrote and recorded “Lucky” for The Help Album in aid of children caught in the Bosnian War and “Lift” which, while never officially recorded, has been a favourite of die-hard fans of the band. “Lucky”, too, would end up as a key component of OK Computer.\n\nOK Computer (1997)\n\nRadiohead hit the studio in 1996 and immediately ran into problems. They had run out of ideas as they were attempting to self-produce. Tensions ran high and they brought in Nigel Godrich (who has now produced everything the band have released since).\n\nOnce the band had beaten their writer’s block, they began to extract influences from such artists as jazz-fusion extraodinaire Miles Davis, alternative darling PJ Harvey and the krautrock of Can. The change in influences is immediately obvious with opening track “Airbag” with the space-rock sounds and punch-to-the-face overdriven guitar riff. Radiohead were back and they weren’t taking any prisoners.\n\n“Paranoid Android” – arguably the best song of the 1990s – has become known as the ‘indie Bohemian Rhapsody’ due to it’s separate movements and the changes in tempo, instrumentation and it’s varied themes. It’s a modern masterpiece of music and a perennial feature on ‘Best of’ lists.\n\nLyrically, Thom’s work had now worked it’s way into abstract levels. Talking of “kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggie” (“Paranoid Android”), “I am the key to the lock in your house / That keeps your toys in the basement” (“Climbing Up The Walls”) and “Transport, motorways and tramlines / Starting and then stopping / Taking off and landing / The emptiest of feelings” (“Let Down”). He really hit his stride in 1996.\n\nJonny’s guitar work, too, hits new heights. His use of effects pedals is at it’s most prevalent on OK Computer and his virtuoso levels of talent are also on show, here more than ever. Backed by the rhythm section of Phil Selway (drums), Colin Greenwood (bass) and Ed O’Brien (rhythm guitar), he is allowed to go crazy. As previously mentioned, Jonny’s playing makes it seem as though he abhors his instrument and it’s no different on OK Computer – especially on “Paranoid Android”, “Airbag” and “Electioneering”.\n\nThe band also seek to make a more political and socio-cultural statement on the album with such tracks as “Fitter Happier” (a collection of buzz-phrases from the 90s in a Stephen Hawking-esque voice – it shares some idiosyncrasies in this way with Andre 3000’s verse in “B.O.B.” from OutKast’s Stankonia) and the aforementioned “Electioneering”.\n\nIt’s the band’s magnum opus, their best work (or at least, it was until 2000). The band are at their finest as a rock band here and not many bands/people have been able to match it.\n\nAlbum Rating\n\n10.0\n\nRecommended Listening:\n\n“You”, “Creep” and “Vegetable” from Pablo Honey\n\n“The Bends”, “Just”, “Street Spirit (Fade Out)”, “Bulletproof… I Wish I Was” and “My Iron Lung” from The Bends"
