        "text": "LIVE AT ANCIENNE BELGIQUE EP COVER ARTWORK // DOWNLOAD HIGH-RES\n\nTamino, the 22-year-old rising star of Belgian, Egyptian, and Lebanese heritage, makes music with startling sit-up-and-listen power. Today, after a run at SXSW and his first few North American shows, he shares the jaw-dropping live version of his single “Indigo Night” which features music mainstay Colin Greenwood of Radiohead. Catch the live footage here. His voice, at one moment sweetly crooning at the next displaying a blistering and flawless falsetto showing off his breath-taking three-octave range.\n\nLISTEN AND SHARE “INDIGO NIGHT” FT. COLIN GREENWOOD (RADIOHEAD) HERE\n\nOn May 10, Tamino will release his live EP titled Live At Ancienne Belgique which includes three incredible live interpretations of \"Persephone\", \"Indigo Night\", \"So It Goes\", as well as a spectacular rendition Chris Cornell's \"Seasons\".\n\nOf the live shows, Tamino says:\n\n“These shows meant a lot to me. We’d been touring non stop around the globe and it felt wonderful to be back in our home country playing three shows in one of the most beautiful venues of Belgium. Couldn’t have imagined a better way to present my debut album. Grateful for everyone who was there.\n\nThe first of the three nights at the AB I tried out a Chris Cornell cover (‘Seasons’) in the encore. It’s a beautiful song that has meant a lot for me when I was a teenager (and still does). I hope I did the song and its writer justice.\n\nOn a couple of songs we were joined by our friend Colin Greenwood, which made the shows even more unforgettable. You’ll hear him play on ‘Indigo Night’ and on ‘So It Goes’.”\n\nWATCH AND SHARE “INDIGO NIGHT” LIVE AT ANCIENNE BELGIQUE HERE\n\nThis Summer, Tamino will perform in Canada at the Montreal Jazz Fest. Details can be found below.\n\nLast Fall, he was featured in Live Nation’s One’s To Watch, which spoke of Tamino’s voice saying his “falsetto surpasses “face melting” and rises to a space of pureness that can only be described as divine.” His stunning live performances have garnered large and growing audiences across Europe and the UK. Including sold out show across Belgium, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, The United Kingdom and more. Recently, he announced his first headline stadium show in Nov 2019 at Antwerp’s Lotto Arena.\n\nWATCH AND SHARE “EACH TIME” HERE\n\nThe BBC hailed Amir as “The New Sound Of The Nile” an ode to Tamino’s grandfather the famed Egyptian singer and movie star Muharram Fouad. The Independent included Amir in their top 10 albums of 2018 and asked “Is Tamino the heir to Jeff Buckley?”. Tamino won the Anchor Award at Germany’s 2018 Reeperbahn festival and has been nominated for 5 MIA Award’s in Belgium.\n\nTamino is making a splash in the fashion world and is featured alongside supermodel Gisele Bündchen in Missoni’s SS19 Collection. During Paris Fashion week he was featured “in conversation” with Maison Valentino and performed a solo version of “Indigo Nights”; watch here. Most recently, he has been featured in Vogue Hommes’ latest 14 page spread which was photographed by critically lauded photographer Paolo Roversi.\n\nPERFORMANCE DATES\n\nJul 2 - Montreal, QC - L’Astral (Montreal Jazz Fest)"
