        "text": "It sounds like I’m exaggerating doesn’t it?\n\nI’m not.\n\nAlmost none of the interactivity in an interactive PDF actually works, even in Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader.\n\nWhat doesn’t work in a PDF\n\nHere’s a list of things that you can create with InDesign that don’t work in a PDF:\n\nAnimation\n\nVideo*\n\nAnimated GIFs\n\nMulti-State Objects\n\nEmbedded HTML content (like YouTube videos)\n\nButton actions related to several of the above items\n\nScrollable Frames\n\nCustom page transitions (like flipbook pages)\n\nDesigner-controlled responsiveness\n\n*Video was supported previously in Acrobat and Adobe Reader, but it was dependent on the Flash Player (which no longer comes bundled with the Adobe apps).\n\nThe introduction of smartphones and tablets—almost none of which now support Flash—and a slew of new PDF readers, essentially guarantee that interactive PDF features will not work when your clients view your PDFs.\n\nTo see the breakdown of an interactive PDF in action, and to get a sneak peek at the solutions that I describe below, you can watch the following video.\n\nHere’s what you can switch to today that supports interactivity\n\nHTML. It’s the language of the web page that you’re reading right now.\n\nHTML has all of the same layout capabilities that PDF does and has a much greater interactive capacity.\n\nRemember the list of interactivity from above?\n\nAnimation\n\nVideo\n\nAnimated GIFs\n\nMulti-State Objects\n\nEmbedded HTML content (like YouTube videos)\n\nButton actions related to several of the above items\n\nScrollable Frames\n\nCustom page transitions (like flipbook pages)\n\nTrue responsiveness (some PDF reader do automatic adjustments on small screens)\n\nHTML supports all of them (and more).\n\nDon’t know how to (or don’t care to) write HTML? Not a problem.\n\nInDesign can export it for you.\n\nHow to create interactive HTML from Adobe InDesign\n\nI’ve detailed three ways to export HTML from InDesign (included in the video above as well).\n\nFixed Layout (FXL) EPUB\n\nPublish Online\n\nin5 (InDesign to HTML5)\n\nEach of these solutions is HTML at its core.\n\nCreating the interactivity with InDesign\n\nIt’s rather straight-forward to create interactivity with InDesign.\n\nThe tools are visually-oriented and easy-to-use, so you don’t have to know any code.\n\nVideo and animated GIFs can simply be placed in InDesign using File > Place.\n\nHTML embeds (like YouTube, Google Maps, Twitter feeds, etc) can be pasted onto the page or inserted via Object > Insert HTML.\n\nAnimation, Button actions, and Object States can be created with InDesign’s built-in panels.\n\nScrollable Frames are supported via the Universal Scrolling Frames panel.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper into interactivity beyond a PDF, including with example files, check out the Creating Your First Interactive Document video course.\n\nAny of the HTML options in this article will then export this InDesign-based interactivity, so let’s look at each of those options in more detail.\n\nCreating a FXL EPUB\n\nAn EPUB is essentially a zipped-up folder of HTML that can read by an EPUB reader app (like Apple iBooks or Adobe Digital Reader).\n\nIt’s typically used for ebooks.\n\nInDesign lets you export FXL EPUB via File > Export.\n\nPros of FXL EPUB\n\nThe EPUB is the only HTML option that produces a single distributable file (an .epub) that can be (fairly) easily read like a PDF.\n\nThis makes it easier to email your digital content and, in some cases, easier to sell your content in a marketplace (such as the iBooks Store).\n\nCons of FXL EPUB\n\nEPUB readers are inconsistent in what they support.\n\niBooks, for example, has a habit of blocking outside content (or even inside content that appears to be outside content).\n\nThe reader app controls the page transitions and the overall experience.\n\nUsing Publish Online\n\nPublish Online is a “technology preview” from Adobe. It’s been in “preview” mode since 2015, so the future of this option is unclear, but it is super easy to use.\n\nThe quick and simple nature makes Publish Online a great tool for client and internal review.\n\nPros of Publish Online\n\nIt’s push-button publishing. With a single step, your interactive document is sent to Adobe’s servers and you’re given a URL (web address) where your content can be viewed online.\n\nCons of Publish Online\n\nPublish Online content only lives on Adobe’s servers. You cannot put it directly on your site (though you can embed it inside of a container).\n\nAdobe can choose to remove or alter your content at any time.\n\nSince you don’t have access to the files, you also cannot customize them in any way.\n\nSimilarly, you cannot repurpose the HTML or convert it to a mobile app (which you could easily do with the actual HTML files).\n\nYour Publish Online link is essentially private unless you choose to share it (though you cannot password protect it), which means it’s also not exposed to search engines, so it won’t appear in a Google search, or improve the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of your site like HTML hosted on your own site would.\n\nPublish Online uses the same underlying FXL export, which means it has some of the same underlying bugs, like the Object State rollover bug shown in the video above.\n\nSee also: our full comparison between in5 and Publish Online.\n\nCreating HTML that you own with in5\n\nin5 (InDesign to HTML5) is a 3rd-party add-on to InDesign created by Ajar Productions. It lets you export interactive content without writing any code, and it lets you host it anywhere.\n\nOnce installed, you can export from within InDesign using File > Export HTML5 with in5…\n\nin5 exports HTML to your local computer, so you can do anything that you want with it.\n\nPros of in5\n\nUnlike Publish Online, with in5, you own the files that you export. You can put them on your own web servers.\n\nYou can also customize the files as much as you would like and you can create mobile apps from your in5 output.\n\nin5 also offers a huge amount of flexibility with several push-button customizations like flipping pages for digital magazines, responsive layouts, and additional interactive options like 3D Flip Cards.\n\nCons of in5\n\nin5 is a commercial tool, so there is an additional cost to use it (in5 pricing page).\n\nUnlike Publish Online, in5 doesn’t automatically upload your content to the web, so you’d have to take this step yourself.\n\nBonus option: hacking Adobe’s FXL export\n\nIf you like the free price tag of Publish Online, but want more freedom with the files, check out Keith Gilbert’s free script, which uses the underlying FXL export to save your files as local HTML. It’s not as fully-featured as in5, but very handy if your project has no budget.\n\nWhich digital publishing option is best for your project?\n\nPDF is still a great format for static documents, but if you want interactivity; take a long, hard look at the HTML-based options that I’ve outlined above."
