Together they make life wonderful. The work of artists and designers informs and forms cultures, benefits society, and empowers the global marketplace of ideas. The faculty in the Department of Art + Design seeks to prepare students for a rich and rewarding life making a significant difference in the lives of others. We study the fundamentals of knowing, thinking, making, and doing; you have an opportunity to learn to use ideas and influences, tools and techniques, and principles and processes of art and design. We provide a faculty, format, and facilities for a great experiential education in art and design within a major urban research university. You pursue your curiosity about, intentions toward, and obligations to the evolving world. Semester and summer programs may include many international destinations—including Austria, England, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, and Japan—and offer intensive studio experiences to augment your study with travel and creative work in the context of other cultures.\n\nWhether you are studying design, media art, or game design, the Department of Art + Design seeks to cultivate your talents as a source of original ideas and expressions of an inner life, using classical, current, and emerging media. You are inspired and challenged to create powerful new works. You will gain visual literacy and fluency with professional art, design, and game design practices in the context of a liberal arts education. You can be transformed into a creative force, ready to realize your potential and create cultural value and social benefit.\n\nArt, BA\n\nNortheastern University offers a studio-based fine art program that investigates visual studies and various cultures, giving students a way of developing their own creative practice as well as an understanding of the relationship between form and meaning. To achieve this level of consciousness around arts practice, students will strike a balance between studio courses in drawing/painting and digital media with visual studies courses that focus on the historical, theoretical, and critical interpretation of visual art. This exploration of art methods creates a more visually and conceptually astute student through making. Students’ education, experience, and training in understanding creative practices takes full advantage of the remarkable scope of the College of Arts, Media and Design. Some courses in this program are offered in locations abroad and may include Austria, Ireland, Japan, and Sicily, where students have an intensive and immersive creative experience during five-week summer sessions.\n\nThe visual studies concentration examines both production public reception of art across regions, contexts, periods, media, foregrounding arts’ status as both a material artifact and social communication. Courses reflect the active research profiles and professional experience of its distinguished faculty who all prioritize accessibility, collaboration, and cutting-edge research. Lectures and seminars take advantage Northeastern’s proximity to area museums and cultural centers, including the Institute of Contemporary Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, as well as campus facilities and initiatives like Gallery 360 and the Center for the Arts. Other dynamic resources include Northeastern’s own renowned archives offering tangible case studies to consider how criticism coalesces into the historical record. Visual studies introduces students to a broad range of creative careers endemic to the fields of design, publishing, curation, conservation, and scholarship.\n\nThe Department of Art + Design uses communal studio space to train students in painting and drawing processes. The department also hosts a fabrication lab that supports a wide range of material-based research for the CAMD community. Beyond the foundation-level courses required for all students, the makerspace provides the resources for prototyping processes ranging from model making, woodworking, CAD, as well as digital fabrication through laser cutting, 3D scanning, and 3D printing.\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Art is offered with a concentration in visual studies or without a concentration.\n\nDesign, BFA\n\nDesign is the practice-based discipline that poses important questions about—and provides significant answers to—how we live. Designers are needed when we don’t know what is needed as well as when we think we do. Designers propose alternative futures and create new choices using principles and processes to create, compose, and construct meaning in diverse knowledge fields. Designers seek a broad understanding of principles and systems of perception, communication, and action.\n\nThe Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design is offered with the following concentration options: experience design, graphic design, information design, and interaction design.\n\nGraphic designers make messages and meaning using visual form and the integration of text and image. Their work often has a persuasive intent and uses rules of visual composition, form, and pattern to enable storytelling or to create attention and an ambiance for consideration.\n\nInformation designers visualize and physicalize concepts and data to enhance human understanding of complex and vital knowledge. Their work has an enlightening or instructive intent and is based on factual content.\n\nInteraction designers focus on the creation of navigable interfaces and systems that allow audiences to take an active role to achieve meaningful goals. Their work connects people to people and people to information and environments.\n\nExperience designers take a holistic and integrative approach that focuses on the quality of the human experience in concrete situations. They employ research, analysis, creativity, and technology as tools to understand human goals, needs, and desires. Their work examines and improves contexts, systems, services, or events.\n\nGame Design, BFA\n\nMedia Arts, BFA\n\nThe continuing revolution in digital computing and global communications has produced a rapidly evolving field for artists who create experiences of image and form with computer screens, intelligent devices, and new materials. Artists also invent tools for exploring, creating, and distributing their ideas and works. Media arts concentrations of animation, photography, and video arts are offered with variations yet to be invented.\n\nCourses in imaginative and narrative arts, required for professional work in documentary films, game art, visualization, visual effects, motion graphics, interactive art, illustration, and short animated films, are offered at Northeastern. The curriculum in our intensive studio program provides knowledge, experience, and techniques of media arts informed by theory, experimentation, and critique. Extensive digital imaging and interactive media editing production facilities afford one the opportunity to become highly proficient in the current skills and emerging practices necessary for remarkable work. The media arts are evolving and expanding into culture in daily life and global experience. The revolutions in immersive media, 3D printing, embedded devices, and robotics are changing the landscape in which the media artist will operate. This degree is designed to prepare students to meet the challenges of continuous change with adaptive ingenuity.\n\nThe animation concentration provides a comprehensive exploration of the entire production pipeline for a variety of animated content including films, visual effects, broadcast, visualization, games, and spatial media. With a focus on developing robust, conceptual, narrative, and technical software skills, this rigorous studio program explores the power and potential of effective visual communication through 2D and 3D motion design. The animation concentration provides ample opportunities to explore and collaborate with related creative disciplines (VR/AR/XR, game design, interactive, video, etc.), making this a truly unique learning experience. Throughout their education, students will work to develop a professional-level portfolio, the centerpiece of which will be a senior-year capstone project, demonstrating mastery in their specific area of focus.\n\nThe photography concentration encourages experimental and self-disciplined engagement with photographic processes in order to understand how materials function, both as a physical component of photographic work as well as a signifier of meaning. Concept and process are in constant dialogue, and we believe learning through doing cultivates individual vision and working methods. Each student’s creative approach establishes a vital platform for discovery. In addition, theory and conceptual development provide students with necessary analytical tools for understanding and analyzing visual and technological trends in current and future photographic practices.\n\nYoung professionals today must meet challenges—as well as enjoy opportunities—to be more creative, adaptive, and innovative as active practitioners within our contemporary visual culture and evolving technological environment. Our responsibility as liberal arts educators is to expand the skills and vision of each student in light of their individual and professional goals. At a time when initiative, creativity, and innovation are leading principles for social and economic progress, it is important to stress the ways in which their artistic and creative endeavors can make a rewarding and meaningful contribution.\n\nNortheastern photography concentration or minor students find themselves in the center of Boston’s creative hub, across from the Museum of Fine Arts. Northeastern’s own Center for the Arts directs interdisciplinary research and presents exhibitions and innovative programs. The newly renovated Media Hub offers state-of-the art equipment rentals and digital printing resources. Photography students have access to two large computer labs and an alternative photographic processes darkroom with film processing and analog printing capabilities.\n\nOur foundation photography courses are small studio and lab classes, leading to intermediate and advanced studios and seminars with an emphasis on personal vision developed through lectures, critiques, individual meetings, and research. In addition, guest artists are invited to participate and offer insights.\n\nThe video arts concentration is a multidisciplinary field focused on creative video expression and messaging that weaves together art and design foundations; art and design history; video production; cinematic language (including documentary, narrative, and experimental strategies); collaborative frameworks; and theories of social and cultural change. The scope of the video arts curriculum is a broader and more diverse tapestry than traditional video art, and it reflects the dynamic evolution of video in multiple contexts. The video arts concentration enables students to explore traditional, alternative, and other artistic means of video art production in a variety of creative and technical contexts. The focus on a multiplicity of artistic formats—hence, the choice of the title video arts—underscores our attention to the training of students who are interested in learning how to experiment with new technical, narrative, and aesthetic practices and incorporate these options into the traditional medium of video art.\n\nAdmission Requirements for Art + Design\n\nThere are specific admissions criteria for students entering majors in the Department of Art + Design. See Admission Requirements for the College of Arts, Media and Design.\n\nAcademic Progression Standards\n\nSame as college standards."
