        "text": "Early European Explorers\n\nIt is not known for certain when the first Europeans reached the Americas. Legends tell of early visitors from Ireland and Wales. According to an epic tale, St. Brendan and other Irish monks made an astonishing journey westward through the Atlantic Ocean in the 6th century ad. They are said to have reached a large landmass. It has been speculated that this land could have been North America or the Canary Islands. Although St. Brendan was a real person, the tale of his Atlantic journey was likely fiction.\n\nAnother legendary traveler, Madog ab Owain Gwynedd of Wales, was said to have reached North America in the 12th century ad. He supposedly sailed to Ireland and then westward. Some people have believed that Madog and his party became the ancestors of a group of Indigenous people who were said to speak Welsh. However, most anthropologists believe that the story of Madog is not true.\n\nIn the 9th century ad the Vikings of Norway, or the Norsemen, arrived in Iceland, which had already been settled by Irish colonists. Irish refugees from Iceland, fleeing before the advance of the Vikings, may have been the first Europeans to arrive in Greenland and Newfoundland (now in northeastern Canada), though this is mere surmise. Greenland, a large island in the North Atlantic Ocean, is considered part of North America.\n\nThe Vikings of Norway are the first Europeans known to have visited North America. A Viking named Gunnbjörn Ulfsson sailed near Greenland in the 10th century ad. The Viking known as Erik the Red (because of his red hair and beard) was the first to colonize the island. In about 980 Erik was banished from Iceland after he killed a neighbor in a quarrel. He decided to spend his exile exploring Greenland. Erik sailed in 982 with his household and livestock and established a colony on the southwest coat of Greenland. During Erik’s three-year exile, the settlers encountered no other people, though they explored to the north.\n\nErik returned to Iceland in 986. He wanted to persuade the Norse people there to help him colonize the land he had explored, so he gave the icy island a favorable name—Greenland. His descriptions of the territory convinced many people to join a return expedition. By the year 1000 there were an estimated 1,000 Scandinavian settlers in the colony.\n\nThe first Europeans to land on the mainland of North America were the Viking explorer Leif Eriksson and his party. Leif was one of Erik the Red’s sons and had accompanied him to Greenland. The exploits of Erik and Leif are the subjects of Norse sagas, which are stories or histories in prose. According to one of the sagas, a man named Bjarni Herjulfsson was blown off course while sailing from Iceland to Greenland in about the year 1000. He was carried far to the southwest, where he saw an unknown shore, and then returned to tell his tale. Leif Eriksson and about 30 other people set out in 1001 to explore this land. They probably reached the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador (now in northeastern Canada). Modern archaeologists have found evidence of Viking settlements there from about Leif’s time.\n\nThe expedition continued southward, reaching a warmer wooded land where “wine berries,” or grapes, grew. They named this place Vinland, meaning “Wine Land,” though the fruit they found may actually have been cranberries. Vinland may have been in what is now Maryland or Virginia, in the southern United States, or perhaps the lands around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in southeastern Canada.\n\nLeif and the other members of the expedition built houses in Vinland and explored the region before returning to Greenland. Later Viking expeditions tried to establish colonies, but within a few years their trade with local peoples had turned to warfare. The colonists gave up and returned to Greenland. In about 1013 Erik the Red’s daughter Freydis led an unsuccessful expedition to Vinland. So ended the Norse visits to the Americas as far as the historical record is concerned. Little knowledge of these first discoveries came down to the next European explorers to reach the Americas, hundreds of years later.\n\nThe Age of Discovery\n\nEuropeans “rediscovered” the Americas during the great period of maritime exploration known as the Age of Discovery (or the Age of Exploration), in the 15th and 16th centuries. During this period, Europeans also explored the coasts of Africa, sent ships directly to India and Southeast Asia, and sailed completely around the globe.\n\nThe effects of the Age of Discovery were diverse and profound worldwide. European exploration ushered in globalization—the development of economic and cultural links throughout the world. Europeans conquered and colonized distant lands, establishing vast empires. In the Americas, violent conquest and diseases accidentally brought over by the Europeans killed enormous numbers of Indigenous people. Smallpox, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, and measles were among the diseases spread to the New World. Indigenous populations further decreased as Europeans forced them to work on plantations and in mines under harsh conditions. Europeans later imported enslaved Black Africans to the Americas to replace the Indigenous people as a labor source. Meanwhile, gold and silver poured back to Europe from the mines, enriching European economies.\n\nEuropean exploration led to the exchange of plants, animals, germs, technologies, and ideas across continents, in what is now called the Columbian Exchange (after Christopher Columbus). A significant portion of the crops now used to feed the world’s population originated in the Americas and were spread as a result of the Age of Discovery. Potatoes, corn (maize), tomatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, cassava, cacao (the source of chocolate), hot peppers, peanuts (groundnuts), pineapple, and tobacco were among the crops introduced to Europe, Africa, and Asia from the Americas. New food sources from more productive crops led to population booms in the Old World. Europeans introduced domesticated animals such as horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs to the Americas. The Europeans also brought new crops such as wheat, rice, oats, bananas, olives, sugarcane, and coffee to the Americas and introduced steel and guns. Sugar and cotton began to be produced in great quantities on New World plantations, which led to the creation of sugar processing and cotton textile industries in Europe. In addition, the capitalist system of Europe grew and spread. Missionaries from Europe introduced Christianity far and wide.\n\nAdvances Fostering Exploration\n\nThe Viking discoveries were little known to other Europeans of the Middle Ages. Most medieval Europeans were ignorant of other places in the world. Maps of the time generally showed only a broad strip of land and water reaching from Greenland south to the Mediterranean coasts of Europe and Africa and far eastward to China’s Pacific shore.\n\nSeveral events and developments in the years preceding the Age of Discovery served to increase Europeans’ curiosity about the world. Christians from Europe had been fighting in wars, called the Crusades, in western Asia. The Crusaders had brought wonderful products home from Asia. People were also excited by the story of Marco Polo, which told of his trip to China in the 1200s and the great wonders there.\n\nShips called caravels, which were small, light, and quick, came increasingly into use in the early 15th century. They were propelled by sails and were steered by a rudder. Caravels were often equipped with lateen (triangular) sails, rather than square sails. The ancient square sail permitted sailing only before the wind—that is, with the wind generally behind the ship. The lateen sail was a major advance because it allowed the ship to sail close to the direction from which the wind blew.\n\nWhen explorers began making longer voyages, a ship called the carrack or nao proved better than the caravel. The carrack was a rounder heavier ship, more fitted to cope with ocean winds. It had both square and lateen sails. The carrack also had more room to store provisions for longer journeys as well as the spices and other trade goods the explorers acquired.\n\nDiscoveries in the science of the stars—astronomy—helped sailors navigate their ships better. Many people knew that Earth is round. Part of the new knowledge came from the long-forgotten writings of great thinkers of ancient Greece and Rome. This rebirth of interest in ancient learning was called the Renaissance.\n\nThe rediscovery of an important ancient Greek work—Ptolemy’s Guide to Geography—greatly increased interest in cartography, the art and science of mapmaking. Developments in printing and engraving helped make maps more widely available. Geographers were also able to make maps more and more accurate, partly because better instruments were being used for astronomical observation and navigation of ships.\n\nThe magnetic compass had reached Europe in the 1100s. Within a hundred years or so sea captains learned to rely on it for direction-finding. In addition, navigators began using devices known as the cross-staff and the astrolabe to determine a ship’s latitude (north-south position). Little by little it became safer for sailors to venture into unknown seas. Sailors made discoveries that allowed cartographers to make better maps that showed more of the world; these maps in turn inspired and aided further voyages of exploration.\n\nThe Desire for New Trade Routes\n\nEuropean explorers found the New World by mistake; they were not looking to find new continents but new sea routes. Europeans mainly wanted to find better trade routes to China, India, and Southeast Asia. They valued many products from Asia, including cloves, pepper, and other spices that were used to make food taste good and to keep it from spoiling. Also in demand were such luxuries as sheer, colorful silken cloths, rich carpets, and sparkling jewelry. The wealth of the East had been trickling into western Europe mainly by overland routes. Asian merchandise was thus both scarce and expensive in Europe. Goods changed hands many times before they reached the consumer, and at each exchange the cost increased. The merchandise was transported by camel or horse caravans, with each animal carrying only a comparatively small load. Ships could carry goods more cheaply and in greater quantity. The Italian port cities were satisfied with their monopoly of the old trading routes. On the other hand, Portugal, Spain, England, and France wanted to find new sea routes to Asia in order to import goods directly.\n\nThe older trading routes were also becoming less useful. While the Mongols controlled a vast empire in China and Central Asia, traders had been able to travel the overland routes safely. Toward the end of the 14th century the empire began to break apart, and Western merchants were no longer assured of safe-conduct along the land routes. In addition, the Ottoman Turks, who were hostile to Christians, were gaining power. They blocked the outlets to the Mediterranean Sea and thus to the ancient sea routes from the East. The Ottomans also effectively closed the land routes.\n\nThe Portuguese Find the Eastern Route\n\nHenry the Navigator, prince of Portugal, initiated the first great enterprise of the Age of Discovery—the search for an eastern sea route to China. Although Henry is called “the Navigator,” he did not sail on voyages of discovery; he sponsored them. He had several reasons for promoting exploration. He was curious about the world. He was also interested in new navigational aids and better ship design and was eager to test them. Moreover, Christian Europe was still fighting the Crusades against Islamic powers. Henry hoped to challenge Arab power in North Africa. The desire to establish profitable trade was yet another motive.\n\nThe eastern sea route to China involved first sailing south along the west coast of Africa. In the 15th century Portuguese sea captains made ever-lengthening voyages of discovery down this coast. Bartolomeu Dias first reached the cliffs of the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip in 1488. In 1497–98 Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape and reached India by sea, successfully finding the eastern route. He brought back a cargo of spices that netted a huge profit. Portugal occupied key cities on the sea lanes between China and the Red Sea. Its wealth became the envy of western Europe. (See also Eurasia, exploration of; Africa, exploration of.)\n\nColumbus Sails West\n\nOn the morning of Oct. 12, 1492, the master navigator Christopher Columbus stepped ashore on an island in the Americas. The arrival of his ships in the Western Hemisphere was one of the pivotal events in world history. Columbus’ voyages opened the way for European exploration, exploitation, and colonization of the Americas. They also led to the near total annihilation of numerous Indigenous cultures. Ironically, Columbus had landed in the New World by accident. He was seeking a western sea route from Europe to Asia. When he sighted land, he believed that he had reached his goal. To the day he died, he still believed that he had reached Asia. Although Columbus was mistaken, he still ranks as a highly skilled navigator and a courageous and persistent explorer. Few other navigators of his time would have dared to sail far west into the unknown, without proof that the winds would allow them to return.\n\nIt is not known when the idea originated of sailing west to reach China. Many sailors searched for islands in the west. Educated people knew that the world was round and that the east could be reached by sailing west. To believe, however, that it would be practical to make such a voyage was an entirely different matter. Columbus was one of the most optimistic advocates of the western route. His studies led him to believe that Earth’s circumference was much smaller than it actually is and that Asia extended much farther east than it does. He believed that Asia lay only a few thousand miles west of Europe, across the open sea.\n\nColumbus was probably originally from Genoa, Italy. In about 1476 he settled in Lisbon, Portugal. He and his brother worked as mapmakers there, but Columbus was mainly a seagoing businessman. He sailed to Ireland, Iceland, and a Portuguese settlement in West Africa, gaining knowledge of Portuguese navigation and the Atlantic wind systems.\n\nIn 1484 Columbus first began seeking support from King John II of Portugal for a voyage west to Asia. He was not able to convince the king that his idea was worth backing. Columbus next tried to obtain sponsorship from France and England. By 1486 he was in Spain, asking for patronage from King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. After at least two rejections, he at last obtained their support in January 1492. They probably argued that the cost of equipping the expedition would not be very great. If it failed, the loss could be borne. If the expedition should succeed, however, the gain would be enormous—it might divert to Spain all the wealth of Asia.\n\nFerdinand and Isabella also hoped that such an enterprise would gain them greater status in Europe, especially against their main rival, Portugal. Then, in alliance with the pope, they might hope to take the lead in the Christian war against Islamic powers. Spanish soldiers had just recaptured the last foothold of the Muslim Moors in Spain earlier that month. Columbus himself hoped to amass riches for his family and to join the ranks of the nobility of Spain. Ferdinand and Isabella promised that if he succeeded, he would be made “Admiral of the Ocean Sea” and that he would receive 10 percent of any profit. Columbus and later his descendants would be appointed the governor of any lands he discovered. Columbus was also a devout Christian, and he hoped that his voyage would lead to the conversion of the Chinese to Christianity.\n\nThe historic first voyage\n\nOn his first voyage, Columbus took three ships and a total crew of about 90 Spaniards. The Niña and the Pinta were small, speedy caravels. Vicente Pinzón commanded the Niña, while his brother Martín Pinzón was captain of the Pinta. Columbus commanded the Santa María, the flagship. At about 117 feet (36 meters) long, it was more than twice the size of the caravels. The Santa María was probably a carrack, or nao. Some of the funding for the voyage came from the Spanish monarchs. A group of Italian bankers in Seville, Spain, also contributed a large sum of money.\n\nThe little fleet set sail from Palos, Spain, on Aug. 3, 1492. Columbus’ navigational genius showed itself immediately. The fleet sailed southward to the Canary Islands, off the northwest African mainland, rather than sailing due west to the islands of the Azores. The westerlies (winds blowing from the west) prevail in the Azores. These winds had defeated previous attempts to sail to the west. In the Canaries the three ships could pick up the northeast trade winds. Supposedly, they could trust to the westerlies for their return.\n\nOnly three days out of Palos, the Pinta lost its rudder. The Spaniards repaired the ship in the Canary Islands and set sail again on September 9. Steady trade winds from the northeast drove them on their course due west. As they sailed westward, Columbus kept two records of progress. One was the distance he thought they had actually traveled. The other was a much shorter estimate that he showed the crew to quiet their fears at being so far from home.\n\nFor the most part the passage was smooth and the winds were steady. As the days passed, however, the men could not see how they could sail home against winds that had blown them steadily west. On October 8 and 9 the men were ready to rebel. Columbus said that he would turn back if land was not sighted within three days. They found land just in time. On the night of October 11, Columbus thought he saw lights in the distance. At 2 am on October 12, Rodrigo de Triana, a seaman aboard the Pinta, cried loudly the first sight of land. The voyage from the Canaries had taken 33 days.\n\nThe small Spanish fleet had unknowingly reached not Asia but the Caribbean islands that are now The Bahamas. The islands are part of North America, lying between Florida on the U.S. mainland and the island of Cuba. Columbus named the first land that the expedition sighted San Salvador. This island may have been the one now called San Salvador or perhaps Samana Cay. The expedition landed and was met by a group of Taino people. Carrying the royal banners of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Spaniards took possession of San Salvador for Spain.\n\nThe Taino were friendly and helpful to the Spaniards. Columbus believed that he had reached the “Indies”—East and Southeast Asia. He thus called the Indigenous people he encountered there Indians. The Caribbean islands are today known as the West Indies, to distinguish them from the East Indies of Asia.\n\nSailing on with Indigenous guides, Columbus stopped at islands he named Santa María de la Concepción (now Rum Cay), Fernandina (Long Island), and Isabela (Crooked Island). He then sailed south to Cuba, reaching its north coast on October 28. He thought that Cuba might be Japan, but he later convinced himself that it was actually the Chinese mainland.\n\nEverywhere the Spaniards asked the Indigenous people where gold could be found. On Dec. 6, 1492, the explorers reached an island called Ayti (Haiti) by its Taino inhabitants. On December 6, Columbus renamed the island Hispaniola (now divided politically into Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Previously he had found small trinkets of gold, but on Hispaniola he found at least enough gold and prosperity to save him from ridicule on his return to Spain.\n\nOn December 25 the Santa María ran aground off the north coast of Hispaniola and had to be abandoned. From its timber Columbus built a small fort, La Navidad, with the help of a Taino chief named Guacanagarí. The Spaniards left 39 crewmen behind at La Navidad as colonists.\n\nOn Jan. 16, 1493, the Niña and the Pinta began the return voyage. They carried gold, colorful parrots, other strange animals and plants, spices, and some Indigenous cloth and ornaments. They also carried several Indigenous people, whom they had captured to show to Ferdinand and Isabella. The journey back was a nightmare. The westerlies did indeed direct the ships homeward. In mid-February, however, a terrible storm engulfed the fleet, and the ships were separated. Columbus, on the damaged Niña, eventually limped to port in Lisbon for repairs. The Pinta made port at the Spanish town of Bayona, to the north of Portugal. With repairs completed, Columbus set sail, reaching Palos on March 15, 1493. Ferdinand and Isabella welcomed Columbus at Barcelona, Spain, with great honor. All the titles and privileges promised to him were confirmed.\n\nLater voyages\n\nThe wealth and human captives that Columbus displayed for the Spanish rulers convinced all of the need for a rapid second voyage. Columbus, now an admiral, was at the height of his glory. He led at least 17 ships out from Cádiz, Spain, on Sept. 25, 1493. The ships carried about 1,500 men and supplies to enable them to found permanent colonies. The expedition also included a group of friars, who hoped to convert the Indigenous peoples to Christianity.\n\nSailing again via the Canary Islands, the fleet took a more southerly course than on the first voyage. The Spaniards reached Dominica in the Lesser Antilles on November 3. After sighting the Virgin Islands, they arrived at Hispaniola on November 23. There they found that La Navidad had been burned and the 39 men slain. The Spaniards started a new colony, named La Isabela for the queen. Columbus then explored the coasts of Jamaica, Cuba, and Hispaniola. Doubts seem to have arisen among some of the Spaniards as to the identity of the islands. In June 1494 Columbus forced his men to swear a declaration that Cuba was indeed the Chinese mainland. The following year he began to conquer Hispaniola, spreading devastation among the Taino. The Spaniards forced many of them to work in gold mines and shipped others to Spain as slaves. Columbus left his brothers in charge of La Isabela and returned to Spain, arriving at Cádiz on June 11, 1496.\n\nColumbus set out on his third voyage with a smaller fleet of six ships on May 30, 1498. He planned to explore to the south of his earlier discoveries and hoped to find a strait from Cuba to India. After stopping at Trinidad, he entered the Gulf of Paria and planted the Spanish flag on what is now Venezuela, in South America. He realized that the great torrents of freshwater flowing into the Gulf of Paria meant that he had discovered another continent. But of course he did not find a strait to India.\n\nWhen Columbus returned to Hispaniola, he discovered that both the Taino and the European colonists resented the rule of his brothers. Dissatisfied colonists had complained to the Spanish rulers. A new governor was sent to replace Columbus. He arrested Columbus and his brothers and shipped them back to Spain in chains. Ferdinand and Isabella released the brothers but did not reappoint Columbus governor.\n\nColumbus’ fourth and final expedition was the most disappointing and unlucky of all his voyages. He set sail on May 9, 1502, with only a small fleet of four ships. The Spanish rulers had by then lost much of their confidence in him. He explored the coast of Jamaica, the southern shore of Cuba, and the east coast of Central America, searching for gold and a strait to India. The fleet lost two ships. The two remaining ships, in poor condition, ran aground on Jamaica in June 1503. Columbus sent messengers by canoe to Hispaniola, but the governor was in no hurry to send help. Meanwhile, Columbus correctly predicted an eclipse of the Moon from his astronomical tables, thereby frightening the local peoples into providing food for the Spaniards. Rescue ships from Hispaniola finally arrived in June 1504.\n\nThe admiral returned to Spain broken in health and spirit. He was not received at court, and the king refused to restore his privileges and honors. He was, however, far from poor.\n\nOver the hundreds of years since Columbus sailed to the Americas, there has been a major shift in how he has been perceived. In the older perspective, Columbus has been celebrated by people of European descent as a hero for “discovering” the Americas. His four voyages to the New World were the means of bringing great wealth to Spain and other European countries and of opening up the Americas to European settlement. More recent approaches have emphasized the destructive effects of his voyages. They stress the disastrous impact of the slave trade and the ravages of the diseases the Europeans accidentally brought with them on the peoples of the Americas.\n\nSpain and Portugal Divide Up the New World\n\nWhen Columbus first returned to Spain, the Portuguese claimed that he had merely visited a part of their dominion of Guinea in Africa. Spain and Portugal asked the pope to settle the dispute. He complied in 1493 by drawing an arbitrary north-south Line of Demarcation. This imaginary line lay about 320 miles (515 kilometers) west of the Cape Verde Islands. Spain was given exclusive rights to all newly discovered and undiscovered lands in the region west of the line. Portuguese expeditions were to keep to the east of the line. Neither power was to occupy any territory already in the hands of a Christian ruler.\n\nKing John II of Portugal was dissatisfied with the pope’s decision. Under the new rule, the Portuguese would not even have sufficient room at sea for their African voyages. In 1494 Spain and Portugal negotiated a treaty that moved the Line of Demarcation to about 1,185 miles (1,900 kilometers) west of the Cape Verde Islands. The pope eventually sanctioned the change. However, no other European country facing the Atlantic ever accepted this line.\n\nThe new Line of Demarcation allowed Portugal to claim a significant prize in the New World—Brazil. On March 9, 1500, the Portuguese navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral set sail from Lisbon for India, intending to follow the route around Africa taken by Vasco da Gama. To avoid the calms off the Gulf of Guinea, Cabral bore so far to the west that on April 22, 1500, he sighted the Brazilian coast. He took formal possession of the land for Portugal and then set off for India.\n\nNews of Cabral’s landing in Brazil aroused great enthusiasm among the Portuguese. The king began to sponsor major transatlantic explorations, including that of the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci. Vespucci had already completed an expedition in 1499–1500 for Spain, as navigator of a fleet under the command of Alonso de Ojeda. On that mission, Vespucci arrived in Guyana and then turned south to Brazil. He is believed to have discovered the mouth of the Amazon River. On the way back he reached Trinidad, sighted the mouth of the Orinoco River, and then made for Haiti. Vespucci thought that he had sailed along the coast of an eastern peninsula of Asia.\n\nVespucci led an expedition for Portugal in 1501–02. His small fleet sailed along the coast of Brazil and for the first time estimated the extent of the land. Calendar in hand, he named different points on the coast after the Christian saints on whose days they were discovered. The extent of this voyage is disputed, but Vespucci claimed to have continued southward. He may have discovered the Río de la Plata, an estuary between what are now Uruguay and Argentina.\n\nVespucci and also scholars became convinced for the first time that the newly discovered lands were not part of Asia but a “New World.” Vespucci wrote a lively and embellished description of this New World that became quite popular. In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller, a German scholar, suggested in a pamphlet that the new land be named America after him. (His name in Latin is Americus Vespucius.) The name caught on and brought Vespucci an honor that many feel he did not deserve. The name America originally was applied only to South America, but the term soon was extended to include North America.\n\nMagellan’s Ship Circles the Globe\n\nSpain claimed that the Line of Demarcation extended around the globe, but no one knew where it fell in the Eastern Hemisphere. A Portuguese captain named Ferdinand Magellan believed there might be a water passage through South America that would lead to Asia. He presented his idea to the king of Spain, Charles I (later the Holy Roman emperor Charles V). Magellan convinced the king that the richest lands in the East—including the Spice Islands (now the Moluccas of Indonesia)—lay in the region reserved for Spain by the Line of Demarcation. The king commissioned Magellan to find a western route to Asia.\n\nSpanish officials furnished five small ships for the expedition. Magellan’s flagship, the Trinidad, had as consorts the San Antonio, the Concepción, the Victoria, and the Santiago. The ships were old ones, not in the best condition or fitted as Magellan would have liked. They carried a crew of about 250 men, mostly Spaniards. The fleet left Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in southwestern Spain, on Sept. 20, 1519.\n\nThe ships reached the Canary Islands on Sept. 26, 1519, and set sail on October 3 for Brazil. They then sailed southward along the east coast of South America. The expedition explored the estuary of the Río de la Plata in the vain hope that it might prove to be a strait leading to the Pacific Ocean. The ships continued southward along the coast of Patagonia, in what is now Argentina, in search of a strait.\n\nEventually, with the weather worsening, Magellan decided that the expedition would spend the winter on land. Winter quarters were established at Port St. Julian, in southern Argentina. There, Spanish captains led a serious mutiny against the Portuguese commander. With resolution, ruthlessness, and daring, Magellan quelled it. He executed one of the rebellious captains. He left another of the captains ashore when, on Aug. 24, 1520, the fleet left St. Julian.\n\nOn October 21, Magellan at last found a strait leading westward. This channel, which is now named the Strait of Magellan, lies between the southern tip of mainland South America and the island of Tierra del Fuego. The strait proved to be an extremely difficult one: it was long, deep, tortuous, rock-walled, and bedeviled by icy squalls and dense fogs. It was a miracle that three of the five ships got through its 325-mile (525-kilometer) length. After 38 days, they sailed out into the open ocean. At the news that the ocean had been sighted, the iron-willed Magellan reportedly broke down and cried with joy.\n\nOnce away from land, the ocean seemed calm enough. Magellan consequently named it the Pacific, meaning “peaceable.” The Pacific, however, proved to be of vast extent. For 14 weeks the little ships sailed on a northwesterly course without encountering land. Short of food and water, the sailors ate sawdust mixed with putrid ship’s biscuits and what few rats they could catch. They finally resorted to chewing the leather parts of their gear to keep themselves alive. Many of the men fell seriously ill with scurvy. At last, on March 6, 1521, exhausted and in poor health, they landed at the island of Guam. They were the first Europeans to have crossed the Pacific.\n\nIn Guam they obtained fresh food for the first time in 99 days. They left a few days later, steering west-southwestward to the Philippines. There, Magellan secured the first alliance for Spain with a leader in the Pacific. At Cebu Island the expedition converted the island’s ruler to Christianity. Weeks later, however, Magellan was killed in a fight with the people of nearby Mactan Island.\n\nThe survivors, in two ships, sailed on to the Moluccas, where the expedition obtained large amounts of valuable spices. One ship attempted, but failed, to return across the Pacific. The remaining ship, the Victoria, sailed alone across the Indian Ocean. It was commanded by the Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián del Cano. The ship rounded the Cape of Good Hope and arrived at Seville on Sept. 9, 1522. After a voyage of slightly more than three years, it had circled the globe. Besides Cano, the surviving crew consisted of only 17 Europeans and a small number of Moluccans. The spices they brought back more than paid for the expenses of the voyage.\n\nMagellan was undoubtedly one of the most skilled sailors of the great age of European maritime discoveries. Although he died before the completion of the voyage, he did circumnavigate, or sail round, the world. He did not encompass the globe on a single trip, however. On a previous eastbound voyage to the East Indies, he had gone farther east than the Philippines. Thus, at the time he was killed, he had already overlapped his earlier course.\n\nIt is fitting to consider Magellan and Cano’s circumnavigation as marking the close of the Age of Discovery. Magellan and his men proved that Columbus had discovered a New World and not the route to China. They also demonstrated that this New World was separated from Asia by a vast ocean.\n\nLatin America\n\nAccording to the Line of Demarcation, Spain was left in control of most of the New World. Spanish conquerors, known as conquistadores, soon began to explore and take control of the region that is now Latin America. This region includes Mexico, Central America, South America, and the islands of the West Indies in the Caribbean. Because the Spaniards colonized much of this vast region, most of its people today speak Spanish.\n\nThe earliest Spanish settlements were in the West Indies. With Columbus’ arrival there, the Caribbean Sea was essentially transformed into a Spanish lake. Settlement by the Spanish concentrated on the islands of Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and above all Hispaniola. The first permanent Spanish settlement in the Americas was established at Santo Domingo, on Hispaniola, in 1496. Santo Domingo rapidly became the “mother of settlement” in Latin America. From this city, major Spanish expeditions of conquest and settlement set out. The Spaniards found gold, silver, and precious stones and enslaved the Indigenous peoples. Ambitious men became governors of conquered lands. Missionaries brought a new religion to the Indigenous peoples.\n\nBalboa Reaches the Pacific\n\nThe first European to look upon the Pacific Ocean from the shores of the New World was Vasco Núñez de Balboa. The Spanish adventurer and explorer sailed for America in 1500 and settled in Santo Domingo. There his unsuccessful attempts at farming led him into debt. In 1510, hoping to escape his creditors, he stowed away on a ship. The ship carried an expedition bound for the new colony of San Sebastián on the mainland of South America, in what is now Colombia.\n\nWhen the expedition arrived at San Sebastián, it was discovered that the colony’s founder had fled and abandoned the survivors. Balboa persuaded his superiors to transfer the colony to the region of Darién, in the Isthmus of Panama. There they founded Santa María de la Antigua, the first stable European settlement in Central America. Balboa eventually gained command of the colony.\n\nBalboa meanwhile had organized a series of expeditions into the Indigenous chiefdoms of the area to hunt for gold and people to enslave. From the Indigenous peoples, he learned of a great ocean beyond the mountains and of a province rich in gold. The gold was perhaps a reference to the riches of the Inca Empire. Balboa sent word to Spain that he needed reinforcements to explore the area. In Spain an expedition was organized, but Balboa was not given command. The king instead sent Pedro Arias Dávila as commander and as governor of Darién.\n\nBalboa had already set out, however, without waiting for reinforcements. On Sept. 1, 1513, he sailed to the narrowest part of the isthmus. It took about 25 days for his party of 190 Spaniards and hundreds of Indigenous people to cross 45 miles (70 kilometers) of dense jungle. On Sept. 25 (or 27), 1513, Balboa climbed to the peak of a mountain, from which he first sighted the Pacific Ocean. A few days later, the expedition reached the shores of the Pacific, which Balboa called the South Sea. He took possession of the ocean and all lands washed by it in the name of the Spanish monarch.\n\nCortés Conquers the Aztec of Mexico\n\nThe Spanish dream of finding great riches in America was realized when Hernán Cortés (or Cortéz) conquered the Aztec Empire in 1519–21. The Aztec ruled a great civilization of some 5 to 6 million people in what is now central and southern Mexico. Their capital, Tenochtitlán, was one of the largest cities in the world. The Spaniards were impressed by the city’s grandeur. Nevertheless, they methodically destroyed Tenochtitlán. On its ruins they built Mexico City.\n\nCortés arrived in the New World when he was about 19. For several years he worked as a farmer and a public official in Hispaniola. In 1511 he sailed under Diego Velázquez to help conquer Cuba.\n\nIn 1518 Velázquez sent his nephew Juan de Grijalba to explore the Yucatán Peninsula. Setting sail from Cuba with four ships and about 200 men, Grijalba became the first European to set foot on what is now Mexican soil. He and his men mapped rivers and discovered Cozumel Island. During their explorations, the men heard tales of a rich civilization in the interior. They eventually met with representatives of the Aztec.\n\nGrijalba returned to Cuba with news of the cities and precious metals of the Aztec. Velázquez was furious that his nephew had made no attempt at settlement, though Grijalba’s orders had been to explore only. As a result, Grijalba was passed over and the job of colonization was given to Cortés.\n\nVelázquez soon suspected Cortés of ambitions beyond his orders, however, and canceled his expedition. Cortés nevertheless assembled men and equipment and set out without permission. He sailed for the coast of Yucatán on Feb. 18, 1519, with 11 ships, 508 soldiers, about 100 sailors, and 16 horses. In March he landed at what is now the Mexican state of Tabasco. Cortés stayed for a time in order to gain intelligence from the local people. He won them over and received presents from them, including 20 women. Among them was Malintzin, to whom he gave the Spanish name Marina. She became his lover, interpreter, and adviser. The success of his ventures was often directly due to her guidance.\n\nCortés sailed to another spot on the southeastern Mexican coast and founded Veracruz there. Then, to prevent all thought of retreat, he burned his ships. Leaving a small force on the coast, Cortés led the remainder of his men into the interior. In his dealings with the local Indigenous people, he relied sometimes on force and sometimes on establishing friendly relations. The key to his subsequent conquests lay in the political crisis within the Aztec Empire. Many of the people who had been subjugated by the Aztec bitterly resented them. Taking advantage of this situation, Cortés began making allies with Indigenous groups who wanted the Aztec to fall. He ultimately made more than 200,000 Indigenous allies.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 1519, Cortés reached Tenochtitlán with his small Spanish force and about 1,000 Indigenous allies. In accordance with the diplomatic customs of the region, the Aztec ruler, Montezuma II, received him graciously. However, the Spaniards soon seized Montezuma.\n\nMeanwhile Velázquez had sent soldiers to arrest Cortés and bring him back to Cuba. Cortés defeated this army at Veracruz and enlisted most of the survivors under his banner. He returned to the Aztec capital in December 1520. After subduing the neighboring territories, he laid siege to the city itself, conquering it street by street. Its capture was completed on Aug. 13, 1521. This victory marked the fall of the Aztec Empire. Cortés had become the absolute ruler of a huge territory extending from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPizarro Conquers the Inca of Peru\n\nThe Spaniards soon conquered another great American empire, that of the Inca. The Inca ruled a vast area that extended along the Pacific coast and Andean highlands from what is now northern Ecuador, through Peru and Bolivia, to central Chile. Their capital was at Cuzco (now in Peru). The conquest of the fabulously wealthy Inca Empire by the Spanish adventurer Francisco Pizarro is one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of the New World.\n\nPizarro was one of the first Spanish captains on the American mainland. After traveling to Hispaniola in 1502, he took part in an expedition to what is now Colombia in 1510. Three years later, he accompanied Balboa on the journey that ended in the “discovery” of the Pacific Ocean. Pizarro accumulated a small fortune as mayor and magistrate of the town of Panamá.\n\nHearing of a large and wealthy Indigenous empire to the south, Pizarro enlisted the help of two friends to form an expedition to explore and conquer the land. A soldier named Diego de Almagro provided the equipment and helped lead the expedition. Hernando de Luque, a priest, furnished the funds.\n\nTheir first expedition resulted in disaster after two years of suffering and hardship. Only about a third of the men survived. When a second expedition in 1526 fared little better, Pizarro sent Almagro back to Panama for reinforcements. Instead of sending help, however, the governor of Panama sent vessels to bring back the explorers. Pizarro refused to return. He is said to have drawn a line on the ground, inviting all who wanted wealth and glory to step over the line and join him. Thirteen men crossed the line. Pizarro and “the famous thirteen” continued exploring the coast to a land they named Peru.\n\nPizarro then sailed to Spain to ask the king directly for authority to conquer Peru. This was granted. Pizarro left Spain with four of his half-brothers on Jan. 19, 1530. They sailed from Panama the following year. He had three vessels, fewer than 200 men, and about 40 horses.\n\nThe Spaniards took advantage of a civil war between two factions of Inca that was just ending. Pizarro spent a year conquering the coastal settlements. Then he marched inland to the city of Cajamarca. There he met with emissaries of Atahuallpa, the Inca emperor. Atahuallpa accepted an invitation to visit the Spanish commander, partly because the Spanish force was so small. He arrived attended by a few thousand Inca. Pizarro’s followers, armed with muskets and cannons, were waiting. They seized the Inca emperor and slaughtered his attendants.\n\nAs ransom to obtain his freedom, Atahuallpa offered to fill with gold a room 17 by 22 feet (5 by 7 meters) to a point as high as he could reach. Pizarro accepted this immense fortune. He soon had Atahuallpa executed anyway, on Aug. 29, 1533. With news of Atahuallpa’s death, the Inca armies surrounding Cajamarca retreated, and Pizarro progressed toward Cuzco, the royal capital. The Spaniards took possession of Cuzco without a struggle in November 1533. Spanish conquering expeditions soon set forth from Peru in all directions: to what are now Chile and Argentina to the south, Ecuador and Colombia to the north, and even the Amazon region to the east.\n\nThe Search for Fabled Riches\n\nMuch of the drive to explore and conquer northern South America came from tales of Eldorado—either a fantastically wealthy Indigenous ruler or a land filled with gold. In the 1530s three expeditions searching for this legendary source of riches arrived in New Granada (now Colombia) from different directions. The leaders of these expeditions were Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and Sebastián de Benalcázar of Spain and Nikolaus Federmann of Germany.\n\nJiménez de Quesada was trained as a lawyer and had no military experience. Nevertheless, he set off from the Caribbean coast of Colombia in 1536 to look for Eldorado and to try to find a land route to Peru. He led an expedition of 900 men up the Magdalena River into the interior of Colombia. After eight months of marching through tropical forests and struggling with hostile Indigenous people, the expedition reached the great central plain of Colombia. This was the land of the Chibcha, a group of tribes that had attained a relatively high state of culture. Although it was not the fabled land of Eldorado, the Chibcha did possess numerous ornaments of gold and jewels. The ruler of the Chibcha fled as Jiménez de Quesada’s army approached, and the conquest of the area appeared to be accomplished. Jiménez de Quesada founded the city of Bogotá in 1538.\n\nTwo rival conquerors soon arrived in the area, however, and challenged Jiménez de Quesada’s claim to Colombia. Federmann and his party had set off from the coast of what is now Venezuela and then explored to the south. Benalcázar, who had already conquered Nicaragua and Ecuador, arrived in Colombia from Peru. The three explorers agreed to submit their rival claims to the Spanish king. They sailed to Spain and plead their cases, but the governorship of Colombia was eventually awarded to another man.\n\nJiménez de Quesada led another expedition in search of Eldorado in 1569, when he was probably in his 70s. With a party of 500 men, he crossed the Andes and explored eastern Colombia. He returned after two years’ wanderings with only 25 of his original company.\n\nOrellana explores the Amazon\n\nMeanwhile, another Spanish expedition had set out in February 1541 to search for a land rich in valuable cinnamon as well as gold. It was led by Gonzalo Pizarro, one of the half-brothers of Francisco Pizarro. With 200 Spaniards, some 4,000 Indigenous people, and numerous horses and other animals, he set out into the unexplored region east of Quito. Food became scarce, however, and Pizarro’s lieutenant, Francisco de Orellana, was sent off in search of provisions. He took a homemade ship and 50 men. Pizarro and his men waited in vain for Orellana’s return. Forced to eat their dogs and horses, they finally staggered back to Quito in August 1542. Only about 80 of the men survived the disastrous expedition.\n\nOrellana, however, made valuable explorations to the east. He reached the junction of the Napo and Marañón rivers. There, according to some accounts, his men persuaded him of the impossibility of sailing upstream to return to Pizarro. Instead, Orellana became the first European to explore the course of the Amazon River. Drifting with the current, he reached the mouth of the Amazon in August 1542. The party continued to the West Indies and then to Spain. Orellana reported that the Amazon area had hoards of cinnamon and gold. He also told of encounters with tribes led by women warriors who resembled the Amazons of ancient Greek mythology. For this reason, he named the river the Amazon.\n\nRaleigh explores the Orinoco\n\nThe English adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh sought the fabled Eldorado in Venezuela. In 1595 he sailed up the Orinoco River in the heart of Spain’s colonial empire. He did locate some gold deposits, but the English did not support his project for colonizing the area. Back in England, he was accused of plotting to dethrone the king and was imprisoned for some 13 years.\n\nUpon his release, Raleigh still hoped to exploit the wealth of Venezuela, arguing that the country had been ceded to England by its Indigenous rulers in 1595. With the king’s permission, he financed and led a second expedition there in 1617. He promised to open a gold mine without offending Spain. However, a severe fever prevented him from leading his men upriver. His lieutenant burned a Spanish settlement but found no gold, and Raleigh’s son died in the action. The expedition had not only failed but it had attacked the Spanish. The king of England had Raleigh executed in 1618.\n\nScientific Exploration\n\nThe first European expeditions explored South America mainly to conquer it and to amass wealth. Missionaries who wanted to convert the Indigenous people to Christianity also traversed the continent. In the 18th and 19th centuries many scientific explorers arrived in South America to study its geography, peoples, plants, and animals.\n\nLa Condamine\n\nOne of the earliest of these scientific explorers was the French naturalist Charles-Marie de La Condamine. In 1735 he led an expedition of scientists to Ecuador to help determine the precise shape of the Earth (which is not a perfect sphere). The scientists accomplished this by measuring the length near the Equator of a degree of the meridian. Meanwhile, another French expedition took similar measurements in the Arctic. La Condamine and his group surveyed the Andes of Ecuador for several years. He noted the Indigenous people’s production and use of rubber and was the first person to scientifically describe this elastic but tough substance. He sent the first rubber samples to Europe, where the new material was a curiosity.\n\nIn 1743 La Condamine conducted the first scientific study of the Amazon River. He traveled from Quito and began a four-month raft journey down the entire length of the river, to its mouth. Along the way, he made scientific observations of the region’s geography and the peoples he encountered. He later published a map of the Amazon and an account of his journey.\n\nHumboldt\n\nOne of the most important scientists to explore South America was Alexander von Humboldt of Germany. His contributions are often called the “scientific discovery of America.” Humboldt became one of the most famous men of Europe during the first half of the 19th century.\n\nIn the summer of 1799 Humboldt set sail from Marseille, France, accompanied by the French botanist Aimé Bonpland. The estate Humboldt had inherited from his mother enabled him to finance the expedition entirely out of his own pocket. Humboldt and Bonpland spent five years, from 1799 to 1804, in South America, Central America, and Mexico. They covered more than 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) on foot, on horseback, and in canoes. It was a life of great physical exertion and serious deprivation.\n\nStarting from Caracas, Venezuela, they traveled south through grasslands and scrublands until they reached the banks of the Apure River, a tributary of the Orinoco. They continued their journey on the river by canoe as far as the Orinoco. Following its course and that of the Casiquiare River, they proved that the vast river systems of the Amazon and the Orinoco are connected by the Casiquiare. For three months Humboldt and Bonpland moved through dense tropical forests, tormented by clouds of mosquitoes and stifled by the humid heat. Their provisions were soon destroyed by insects and rain. The lack of food finally drove them to subsist on ground-up wild cocoa beans and river water.\n\nHumboldt and Bonpland visited Cuba and then made an extensive exploration of the Andes. From Bogotá to Trujillo, Peru, they wandered over the Andean Highlands over a series of steep, rocky, and often very narrow paths. They climbed a number of peaks, including all the volcanoes around Quito. Humboldt climbed Chimborazo to a height of 19,286 feet (5,878 meters), but short of the summit. His ascent remained a world mountain-climbing record for nearly 30 years. All these achievements were carried out without the help of modern mountaineering equipment. Humboldt and Bonpland suffered badly from mountain sickness, but Humboldt turned his discomfort to advantage, by describing it scientifically. He became the first person to ascribe mountain sickness to the lack of oxygen at great elevations.\n\nHumboldt also studied the oceanic current off the west coast of South America that was later named after him. It is now known as the Peru Current. In the last year of the expedition, Humboldt and Bonpland explored Mexico, gathering information on geography and geology as well as political, social, and economic conditions.\n\nHumboldt and Bonpland returned with an immense amount of information. They brought back a collection of several thousand new plants as well as data on longitudes and latitudes, measurements of Earth’s geomagnetic field, and daily weather observations. Humboldt published 30 volumes containing the expedition’s scientific results. His weather data and maps helped lay the foundation for the science of comparative climatology. Other important studies included pioneering work on the relationship between a region’s geography and its plants and animals and on the role volcanoes play in the ongoing development of Earth’s crust. Humboldt’s volumes also contained an impassioned outcry against the enslavement of the Indigenous peoples.\n\nDarwin and other British naturalists\n\nIn the 18th century the British navy sent a series of expeditions to chart the coastlines of South America. Naturalists began to join these expeditions, which provided unique opportunities to study the natural histories of places little known to Western science. Early in his career, the distinguished naturalist Sir Joseph Banks sailed around the world under Capt. James Cook in 1768–71. The expedition traveled along the east coast of South America, rounded Cape Horn at the continent’s southern tip, and proceeded to Tahiti and Australia (see Australia and the Pacific Islands, exploration of). Throughout the voyage, Banks and the Swedish botanist Daniel Solander collected, drew, and described a great number plants and animals. They obtained specimens of hundreds of previously unknown species. Banks later became the long-time president of the British Royal Society.\n\nThe most famous naturalist to join a British naval expedition was Charles Darwin. The observations he made on his journey aboard the Beagle in 1831–36 were to form the basis of his great theory of evolution. The expedition charted the southern coasts of South America and sailed around the world. Darwin was given time for many side trips on land. He examined geologic formations and collected numerous plants, animals, and fossils.\n\nDarwin’s main interest at the time was geology. However, his visit to the Galápagos Islands west of Ecuador aroused his interest in biology. He began to speculate about the curious animal life that varied from island to island. He wondered whether the development of these species was related to the isolation of the islands. He also considered the great diversity of the living things he saw on his travels around the world, even in the depths of the ocean where no humans could appreciate their beauty. He thought about how the fossils he collected suggested that some kinds of mammals had died out. And he returned home filled with questions. Back in England, Darwin quietly began work on what would become his theory of evolution by natural selection. He did not publish it until more than 20 years later, in 1859.\n\nBy that time, another British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, had independently developed a similar theory of evolution. Darwin developed his own theory in much greater detail, however. He also provided far more evidence for evolution and was mainly responsible for its acceptance.\n\nWallace and his naturalist friend Henry Walter Bates had traveled to Brazil in 1848 as self-employed specimen collectors. After several joint collecting ventures, the two young men amicably parted ways. Bates remained in the region for 11 years. He explored the entire valley of the Amazon River, where he collected about 14,712 species, including 8,000 previously unknown species. Most of these specimens were of insects.\n\nWallace spent four years traveling, collecting, mapping, drawing, and writing in unexplored regions of the Amazon River basin. He collected insects and birds and searched for clues to solve the mystery of the origin of plant and animal species. Disastrously, on his voyage home his ship went up in flames and sank. Nearly all his collections were lost, though he managed to save some of his notes.\n\nWallace made a second scientific voyage in 1854–62. This time he toured the Malay Archipelago of Southeast Asia. He traveled among the islands, collecting biological specimens for his own research and for sale. He also wrote scores of scientific articles. Among these were two extraordinary articles dealing with the origin of new species.\n\nNaturalists continued to study Latin American flora and fauna throughout the 19th century. Biologists today still explore the region, particularly the Amazon Rainforest, which is the world’s richest and most varied reserve of living things.\n\nThe search for lost worlds\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw the arrival in Latin America of a new kind of scientist—the archaeologist. Archaeologists began searching for the ruins of Indigenous civilizations of the past. They were especially motivated by tales of “lost worlds”—ruins of cities that had not been seen by Europeans since the Spanish conquest of the 16th century.\n\nThe American traveler John Lloyd Stephens generated interest in the archaeology of the region with his discoveries of Maya ruins. In 1839 he set off for Central America, after having heard reports of the existence of ancient ruins there. He was accompanied by the English illustrator and archaeologist Frederick Catherwood. Their progress to Copán, Honduras, was imperiled, first by local strife and then by the hazards and extreme hardships of travel through dense, dark jungle. Their perseverance was eventually rewarded, when they uncovered a magnificently carved Maya stone slab.\n\nOther discoveries—more carved slabs, terraces, stairways, and walls with strange and fantastic ornamentation—came in quick succession. Catherwood produced superb drawings of the Maya remains they found there and elsewhere, including Uxmal and Palenque in Mexico. The report of the expedition caused a storm of popular and scholarly interest in the Maya.\n\nInterest in the Inca grew because of the work of the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham. In July 1911 Bingham directed an expedition to Peru to find the ruins of Vilcabamba, known as the “lost city of the Inca.” From this city the last Inca rulers led a rebellion against Spanish rule. Prospects for locating Vilcabamba were poor. Clues from early chronicles of the Inca were scanty. The city was believed to be situated somewhere near the city of Cuzco, where the problems of crossing the Andes were great.\n\nThe expedition owed its success largely to Bingham’s steadfastness and courage. He visited several Inca sites, sometimes risking his life to do so. His most significant find came on July 24, when a local resident, Melchor Arteaga, led him to the great ruins of Machu Picchu. The ancient Inca structures of white granite are nearly intact. Among them are temples, palaces, and small houses at various levels connected by stone staircases. Surrounding the residential area are hundreds of stone terraces for farming. Bingham thought that Machu Picchu was Vilcabamba. Most modern scholars believe that an Inca site found in 1964 by Gene Savoy is more likely to be the “lost city.”"
