Adding short descriptions to each image provides context and prompts students to consider various perspectives.\n\nGo check out the example ð\n\nð¡ Pro tip: Instead of giving your image activity a title, use this area to ask your students a question so you can evoke a discussion or start a meaningful dialogue.\n\n21. Compare maps and dates for history\n\nFacilitate an exploration of historical events and the aftermath. Students are presented with two maps depicting the same region at different points in history, accompanied by corresponding dates. Using the slider, students can compare the maps to observe changes in borders, landmarks, and geographical features.\n\nPrompt students to analyze the significance of these changes in relation to historical events and cultural developments. This activity encourages students to draw connections between past events and present-day realities, fostering a holistic understanding of historical contexts.\n\nð¡ Pro tip: Use websites such as âOld maps onlineâ to find and compare maps for your history course.\n\n22. Practice labeling images\n\nUsing the Before/After image widgets, you can facilitate interactive exercises aimed at reinforcing studentsâ labeling skills. Students are presented with two images, one unlabeled and one labeled, related to a specific topic or concept. Using the slider, students compare the unlabeled and labeled images to identify and practice corresponding elements.\n\nTeachers can provide guidance and feedback as students practice labeling various components, such as anatomical structures, geographical features, or scientific diagrams. Students develop their observational skills, vocabulary, and comprehension of visual information. This activity fosters active learning and retention as students recognize and describe key elements within images.\n\nð¡ Pro tip: Use editing tools such as Canva or Adobe Express to label your image.\n\n23. Compare maps and dates for Geography\n\nUse two images to encourage exploration of geographical changes throughout the years. Students are presented with two maps of the same area but from different time periods, accompanied by corresponding dates. Students can compare the maps to observe changes in geography, such as landmasses, coastlines, deforestation, and other natural changes over time.\n\nGuide your students in analyzing the significance of these changes in relation to historical events, human activities, and natural phenomena. Through this activity, students develop spatial awareness, critical thinking skills, and an understanding of the dynamic nature of geography. This interactive approach enhances studentsâ appreciation of how geographical features evolve and impact human societies and the environment.\n\nGo check out the activity below, showing the significant changes over time on the Colombia Glacier. Ask your students to discuss the images. What are the causes, how do these natural processes work, and more?\n\nð¡ Pro tip: Check this video and learn to get updated Google Earth visuals from certain places over time. Youâll see itâs a bit outdated, but the instructions are still correct. Bonus! Google Earth creates some ready-to-use time lapses you can use in a Before/After widget when explaining topics like global warming, deforestation, mining, bushfires, urban growth, and more!\n\nThe Frame Sequence Widget\n\nCreate a digital lesson showing a sequence of related pictures with an explanation. Students can easily move back and forth within the image sequence.\n\n24. Chronologically order historical events\n\nUse the Frame Sequence Widgets to present a series of related pictures depicting key moments in history. Each image is accompanied by an explanation or description of the historical event it represents. Students can navigate through the sequence, moving back and forth to explore the chronological progression of events.\n\nBy arranging the images in chronological order, students gain a visual understanding of the sequence of historical events and their interconnectedness. This interactive format allows students to engage actively with the material, facilitating comprehension and retention of historical timelines and narratives.\n\nGo check the example below. ð\n\nð¡ Pro tip: This website, Running Reality, gives you a good overview of historical maps throughout different time periods.\n\n25. Introduce new terminology by storytelling\n\nCraft engaging narratives that introduce and contextualize new terms or concepts. Each frame in the sequence corresponds to a segment of the story, featuring images and descriptions that illustrate the usage of specific terminology. Students follow along as the story unfolds, encountering new terms in a meaningful context.\n\nBy weaving terminology into a cohesive narrative, teachers provide students with memorable examples and connections, aiding comprehension and retention. The interactive nature of the widget allows students to navigate the story at their own pace, pausing to review and reinforce their understanding of key terms.\n\nMake sure to check the example below ð\n\n26. Create a compare-carousel\n\nDesign a dynamic comparison activity with the Frame Sequence widget! Each frame in the carousel presents paired images, graphs, or data sets representing contrasting concepts, phenomena, or perspectives. Students navigate through the carousel, viewing and analyzing each image to identify similarities and differences with the previous and next image.\n\nIn the lesson example below, students compare how one concept - April Foolsâ Day - is celebrated differently in other countries.\n\n27. Create additional resources\n\nYou can also compile supplementary materials to complement lesson content with a Frame Sequence widget. Itâs a bonus for students who finish practicing early. Check the example below, which can be shared with students after a pizza cooking class or a course about Italy!\n\nThe 3D Widget\n\nA 3D file viewer supporting various file formats.\n\n28. Molecular Structure Visualization\n\nIntroduce molecular biology or chemical concepts by visualizing complex molecular structures with the 3D widget. Teachers can provide interactive models of molecules such as DNA, proteins, and enzymes. Students can rotate, zoom, and examine molecular structures to understand their composition, function, and interactions. This hands-on approach fosters visual learning and facilitates comprehension of molecular principles.\n\n29. Historical Artifact Analysis\n\nEngage students in historical inquiry by presenting 3D models of artifacts or buildings from different time periods and cultures. Teachers can curate virtual collections of artifacts such as ancient pottery, weapons, tools, and artworks or buildings like the colosseum in the example. Students can explore these artifacts/ buildings in detail, analyze their design or architecture, materials, and cultural significance, and draw conclusions about past civilizations. This activity promotes critical thinking and historical empathy.\n\n30. Architectural Design and Engineering\n\nRender objects like in the example - a staircase - in the 3D widget. Students can study the design and construction of the staircase, including different types (e.g., straight, spiral, curved), materials used, and structural elements such as steps, handrails, and supports. They can explore how changes in dimensions and materials affect the stability, safety, and aesthetics of staircases. Additionally, students can design and prototype their own staircase models.\n\nWrap up\n\nThatâs it!
