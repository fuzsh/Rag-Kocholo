        "text": "Click photo to view full image\n\nJim Rabby is an exemplary painter, whose work cuts across all boundaries. he intertwines color, movement and texture to achieve the depth and elation for which his work is so well known. Rabby began painting while he was having a series of polio operations as a young boy, when volunteers would bring in art supplies for the children at the hospital. He has been painting professionally since 1961.\n\nRabby has hundreds of paintings he works on at one time. A canvas will get to 80 to 90 percent of its paint before it comes off the easel. It will dry, preferably for about a year. He then works the surface. The next step is to apply a series of glazes and applying more paint to bring the composition to as lovely a state as he can.\n\nRabby’s work has captured the attention of world-class art aficionados—Texas, millionaire and art buff H. L. Hunt, former Mexican president Miguel de la Madrid, famed heart surgeon Dr. Denton Cooley, billionaire Ross Perot, tennis greats Jimmy Connors and Rod Laver, entertainer extraordinaire Jonny Carson and former U.S. President Lyndon Johnson. His paintings hang in the corporate collections of IBM, the Tenneco Company, Exxon, General Motors and Coca Cola.\n\nAt once outrageous, insightful, playful, thoughtful, creative, passionate, original, imaginative, unassuming, resourceful, courageous and charming, it is no wonder Jim Rabby has captured the hearts of collectors throughout the world."
