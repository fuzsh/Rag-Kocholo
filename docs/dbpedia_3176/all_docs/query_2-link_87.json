        "text": "Want to grow your email list fast? Creating high-converting email opt-in forms is critical. In this definitive guide, we’ll share exactly how to create a persuasive email opt-in form (with examples).\n\nIf you have decent blog traffic but you still aren’t getting very many email signups, then this guide is for you!\n\nThis is an extremely in-depth guide where we will cover everything you need to know to create high-converting email opt-in forms, so feel free to use the table of contents to jump to a particular section.\n\nIf you follow these exact strategies, your email opt-in forms could convert as high as 785%!\n\nSound good?\n\nGreat! We’ll get into all the nitty-gritty details in just a minute, but real quick let’s cover the basics (this is important– don’t skip this section!)…\n\nWhat Does Email Opt-in Mean?\n\nIf you’re new to building an email list, you may be wondering what is an email opt-in form. Well, here’s the email opt-in definition:\n\nAn email opt-in is a web form that businesses use to capture the email addresses of prospective customers, and get their permission to send them offers.\n\nIn marketing speak, email subscribers are referred to as “leads”. That’s because each email subscriber is potentially only an email (or a few emails) away from becoming a paying customer.\n\nDoes that sound exciting to you?\n\nGreat! Let’s keep going…\n\n7 Email Opt-in Best Practices\n\nIf you want your email opt-in forms to be persuasive, you first need to understand what makes people “tick”. How do you get people to actually want to give you their email address?\n\nWell, here are some best practices to keep in mind when creating your email opt-in forms…\n\n1. Do NOT ask people to “subscribe to your newsletter”\n\nFrankly, this is the lazy way to create an email opt-in form. And it simply doesn’t convert.\n\nYou need to remember that email is the most intimate form of online communication. In order to persuade people to give you their email address, you’ll need to give them a good incentive.\n\n2. Instead, create a valuable resource and give it away for FREE in exchange for their email address\n\nYou may have heard the terms “freebie”, “lead magnet” or “opt-in bribe” tossed around. Well, that’s what we are talking about here: this is the persuasive way to create an email opt-in form.\n\nWhy? Well, it leverages a psychological phenomenon known as the Principle of Reciprocity. The reciprocity principle states that people are more likely to do something for you if you do something for them. In other words, people will feel indebted to you when you offer them something for free… and will be far more likely to give you their email address.\n\n3. Your lead magnet needs to be highly relevant to your ideal customers\n\nMany people make the mistake of thinking that the more email subscribers they have, the better. But that’s only partially true.\n\nYes, more email subscribers is better, but only if they are your ideal customers. Otherwise, I’ve got an email list full of people who will likely never buy from me, and who will be annoyed that I am sending them offers that they don’t want or need. That’s not only bad for my reputation as a business owner, but it’s also bad for email deliverability (because I’ll likely get a high percentage of unsubscribes, and possibly even get flagged as spam).\n\nSo attracting the right kind of email subscribers for your particular business is crucial. How do you do that? With a highly relevant lead magnet.\n\nFor example, what would happen if I were to offer free iPads to everyone who opted in to my email list? Well, even if I could afford to do so, that would be a terrible idea, because I would simply be attracting everyone. I mean really, who doesn’t want an iPad?\n\nInstead, you want to offer something that only your ideal customer would want. For example, one of my lead magnets is entitled, “6 Jedi Mind Tricks for the Digital Entrepreneur”.\n\nDo you see what I did there? I specified WHO this freebie is for. The more specific your lead magnet is about who it is for, the better.\n\n4. Your lead magnet needs to be easily consumed\n\nPeople have very short attention spans, and they are hesitant to download something if they think that it is going to take a long time to consume. So you’ll want to avoid creating something like an e-book–unless it’s a really short one–because it will just be too overwhelming for someone to easily consume.\n\n5. Your lead magnet should promise a super specific, quick win\n\nThe purpose of your lead magnet should be to help someone take a very specific action step. It doesn’t need to be a huge step: just a small baby step in the direction that they want to take.\n\nFor example, you could provide a set of tools, or a skillset, or some useful information that your audience can apply.\n\n6. Your lead magnet should create a noticeable improvement\n\nThe purpose of your lead magnet is not only to get someone to opt in to your email list: it actually goes even deeper than that…\n\nYou want to actually create a noticeable improvement in someone’s life.\n\nThat is what will build trust, nurture your relationship, and ultimately help to convince someone to buy your products or services– which is what you want, right?\n\n7. Your lead magnet should be instant\n\nPeople love instant gratification, so to be persuasive, your lead magnet needs to be something that can be delivered to them instantly.\n\nFor example, a PDF, a video, an audio MP3, or anything digital that can be delivered via email.\n\n51 Email Opt-in Incentive Ideas\n\nOK, so now that you know the components of a persuasive email opt-in incentive, here are some ideas to get you thinking about what you might create…\n\nChecklist\n\nCheat Sheet\n\nTemplate\n\nSwipe File or Inspiration File\n\nSamples\n\nScripts\n\nToolkit\n\nWeb App\n\nResource List\n\nCalendar or Planner\n\nWorksheets\n\nPrintable\n\nJournal Prompts\n\nOnline Calculator\n\nSpreadsheet\n\nRecipes\n\nTutorial\n\neBook\n\nGuide or Report\n\nInfographic\n\nVideo\n\nAudio\n\nWebinar\n\nEvent Tickets\n\nEmail Course\n\nSample Chapter from Book\n\nFree Coaching Call\n\nPDF Version of a Blog Post\n\nTranscript\n\nAudio Book\n\nMind Map\n\nRecording or Replay of a Live Event\n\nSlide Presentation\n\nVault or Library of Digital Resources\n\nQuiz Results\n\nSurvey\n\nManifesto\n\nGiveaway\n\nInspirational Quotes\n\nDesktop Wallpaper\n\nMobile App or Game\n\nChallenge\n\nMembership Site\n\nFacebook Group\n\nSlack Group\n\nFree Trial\n\nCoupon Code or Early Bird Discount\n\nCase Studies\n\nWaiting List\n\nFree Shipping\n\nFree Quote or Consultation\n\n…the possibilities are endless!\n\nWording for Your Email Opt-in\n\nAlright, so you’ve created your email opt-in incentive. Next, you need to write the copy for your email opt-in form.\n\nThe first part of your email opt-in verbiage is the title of your lead magnet itself. This is important: you need to think of your incentive title as a headline. You don’t want to come up with some “cutesy” name that makes no sense to anyone except you… you want to be very straightforward about what they are going to get, and what your lead magnet is going to help them to do.\n\nHere are some great examples of lead magnet titles:\n\n52 Headline Hacks: A Cheat Sheet for Writing Blog Posts that Go Viral\n\nThe Ultimate Facebook Ad Template Library\n\nToolkit for Growing Your Online Business\n\n5 Free Meal Plans to Ditch Processed Food\n\nLife is Messy Planners: Make Room for Genius Work\n\nLogo Inspiration eBook\n\n60 Journal Prompts (for Self-Love, Self-Discovery + a Spot of Self-Coaching)\n\nFree Workout: Shrink Your Thighs, Expand Your Mind\n\nThe second part of your email opt-in copy is the description: you’ll need to briefly describe what’s so special about your incentive so it will be irresistible for someone to opt in.\n\nTo do that, I’ve come up with a simple, 3-sentence formula:\n\n“Want to [desired outcome]? Then you’ll need to [action they need to take]. In this FREE [PDF/video/MP3/etc.], you’ll get [repeat or paraphrase the title of your lead magnet].”\n\nHere’s an example of the 3-step formula in action for my 6 Jedi Mind Tricks lead magnet:\n\n“Want to stay at home and pay the bills? Then build a profitable website, you must! In this FREE, 8-page PDF, you’ll get the exact persuasion tricks I use to help entrepreneurs build 7-figure websites.”\n\nThe final part of your email opt-in language is the call to action copy, or the verbiage that goes inside your subscribe button. What you do NOT want to do is say something generic and boring like, “Subscribe” or “Submit”. That’s not very compelling.\n\nInstead, you’ll want to use language that is specific to your particular lead magnet. So for example, “Download the Checklist” or “Grab the Printable PDF”. This call to action copy is much more persuasive because it reminds someone of exactly WHY they should click on the button.\n\nHow to Create Juicy Email Opt-in Images\n\nAlrighty, we are moving right along! Now that you’ve created your lead magnet and you’ve written your title, description and call to action copy, now it’s time for the final component: your email opt-in image.\n\nHaving an enticing image to go along with your email opt-in form really helps to increase your conversions, so make sure to put some effort into yours!\n\nThere are many different types of images you could use, but I’ve found that your opt-in form will convert better when the image is relevant to your lead magnet. So for example, if your lead magnet is a list of recipes, you wouldn’t want to show an image of a Lamborghini. Make sense?\n\nA great way that I have found to create email opt-in images is by using a mockup template to create a realistic looking photo. This makes your lead magnet look more tangible and helps to increase its perceived value.\n\nHere are some examples of mockups that I created on my computer using book and iPad mockup templates:\n\nThese are actually really easy to create when you have the right tools…\n\nFirst, you’ll need to download a mockup template. I like to get mine from Creative Market– they have tons of great ones to choose from!\n\nNext, you’ll need Adobe Photoshop– this software will allow you to edit the mockup template to include your lead magnet.\n\nOpen the template you downloaded in Photoshop, and it will start off looking something like this:\n\nIf you open up the Layers panel, you’ll see that some of the layers can be edited to include your own image. Go ahead and double click on these one at a time to edit them.\n\nWhen you double click on it, the layer will open up in a new tab, like this:\n\nNow all you need to do is copy and paste, or drag and drop, the image of your lead magnet into this layer and save it.\n\nNow, go back to the tab with your mockup template. It should look something like this:\n\nThat’s it! Now you’ve got a nice, juicy email opt-in image.\n\nBest Email Opt-in Plugin for WordPress (or Any Website)\n\nNow that you have all the components for your email opt-in form in place, it’s time to pull them all together and install them on your website along with the actual opt-in form! To do that, you’ll need an opt-in form software.\n\nWhether you are using WordPress or some other platform to build your website, I highly recommend OptinMonster.\n\nOptinMonster is simply the best tool there is for creating opt-in forms because it gives you the most advanced features available anywhere, for a really great price. It also integrates with any email provider you use (such as ConvertKit) so that you can easily deliver your lead magnets to new subscribers when they opt in.\n\nHere’s how to create an email opt-in form with OptinMonster. First, you’ll press the Create Campaign button and choose your campaign type. You can choose from lightbox popup, fullscreen, slide-in, floating bar, mobile popup, inline/after post, or sidebar opt-in forms.\n\nNext, select from one of their high-converting email opt-in form templates (or choose “Canvas” to create your own design from scratch).\n\nFrom there, it will ask you to enter a name for your campaign and select your website that you want the opt-in form to load on. Fill that out, and click the Start Building button.\n\nNow you’ll see the opt-in form edit screen. From here, you can add your email opt-in image, change the email opt-in copy, add your own fonts and colors, or if you are web design savvy you can even tweak the CSS to make it look precisely the way you want.\n\nYou can also go to the Display Rules tab to customize when, where, and to whom your email opt-in form will appear.\n\nYou can even change what appears after someone opts in to your list… for example, you can display a success message (multiple themes available), or you can redirect the user to a thank-you page.\n\nOnce your email opt-in form looks the way you want, click on the Integrations tab. Then select your email provider to integrate it with your optin form so that users will receive your lead magnet by email after they opt in.\n\nNow it’s time to publish your opt-in form! Click on Publish from the top bar. Then toggle Status to the Live position, and select your platform. You can install your optin form on a WordPress site, or on any type of website.\n\nIf you are using WordPress, there is no embed code necessary!
