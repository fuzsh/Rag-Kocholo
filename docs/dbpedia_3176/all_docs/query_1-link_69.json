        "text": "Learning how to write product descriptions and take good product photos can be a simple but effective way to give your ecommerce store a marketing and sales boost. Quality photos make your product ads and listings more eye-catching, driving more traffic to your online store and making your products stand out. Good photos add visual appeal to your products and help customers visualize what it would be like to own them, making your sales pages more persuasive and increasing conversions. By simply learning how to take quality product photos, you can increase your sales without spending a penny more on advertising.\n\nIn this guide, we'll share 12 best practices to help you take good product photos. We'll cover professional product photography tips on everything from physically preparing your products for the camera to editing your photos for a polished look. We'll also answer some frequently asked questions about product photography.\n\nYou can break the process of taking good product photos down into what you do before, during, and after a shoot. Some of the most important product photography tips are:\n\nClean your products\n\nSet up suitable lighting\n\nChoose an appropriate background\n\nEmploy props\n\nUse a high-quality camera\n\nUse a tripod\n\nShoot in RAW format\n\nAdjust your camera settings\n\nCapture multiple angles\n\nConvey context\n\nFollow consistent procedures\n\nUse photo editing software\n\nHere are some guidelines on how to put these principles into practice:\n\nTo put your products in their best light, clean them up before you shoot product photos. Select a sample of your product that is in good condition, or if only one sample is available, take whatever cleaning and repair steps are necessary. Look for imperfections such as dirt, dust, or fingerprints that could mar your photo. Check for discolorations, cracks, missing pieces, or other signs of damage.\n\nDepending on the nature of your product, you may need specific types of cleaning or repair materials. For instance, plastic should be cleaned with a non-abrasive cleaner and a soft cloth to avoid scratching.\n\nIf you need to clean a variety of products, you may wish to keep a toolkit of common cleaning items such as baking soda, white vinegar, and lemon juice, along with spray bottles and cloths. An air duster can be useful for cleaning dust.\n\nLighting can bring out the best or worst side of your product. Both the type of lighting you use and the number of light sources are important for your product photography setup.\n\nThe main types of lighting you can use are natural light and artificial light. Natural lighting casts an even, soft light that illuminates subjects against their backgrounds. It works well for capturing broad details, products used or worn by people, and products used outdoors. Artificial light casts a harder light that focuses on specific areas. It can be used to highlight product features in more detailed shots.\n\nProfessional photographers normally use three light sources to put products in their best light, a technique known as three-point lighting. Three-point lighting uses a key light, a fill light, and a backlight:\n\nThe key light illuminates the subject against its background. It is positioned to the side of the subject, usually at 45 degrees, to cast one side in light and the other in shadow. If you're shooting outdoors, the sun can serve as your key light.\n\nThe fill light is placed opposite the key light to illuminate areas left in shadow. It should be dimmer than the key light.\n\nThe backlight is placed behind the subject to create an aura of light around the subject's perimeter, making the subject stand out from the background and capturing details on the subject's edges.\n\nOne or more additional lights sometimes are used as background lights to illuminate elements in the picture other than the main subject.\n\nBackground selection can help bring out a subject's color, texture, shape, and features. To select a background color, you can use the three-color rule. This prescribes picking one primary color and two complementary colors. Your product's main color normally determines your primary color. You can use a color wheel to select complementary colors, or you can think in terms of warm and cool colors. Colors toward the red end of the spectrum, such as orange and yellow, are classified as warm, while those toward the violet end, such as green and blue, are cool.\n\nYou also can select backgrounds to bring out textures. Textures can suggest qualities such as smoothness, roughness, slipperiness, or stickiness, for example. As with color, you can think in terms of primary and complementary textures. For instance, if you're taking a picture of a thick, soft, fluffy rug, a hardwood floor can serve as contrast.\n\nProps can enhance your photos by illustrating product uses or adding a touch of drama or humor. Props can include anything from furniture to flowers to food. Directors often categorize props by dividing them into handheld items, personal items such as clothing, set items such as furniture, and set dressing items that are not directly held, worn, or used by the main person in the photo.\n\nSelect a prop that fits the purpose of your product and the mood of your photo. When using props, limit yourself to one main prop to avoid cluttering your photo and distracting from your main subject.\n\nThe better your camera, the better your photos will be. What type of camera you should use depends on your needs and budget. Today's smartphone cameras, such as the iPhone Camera, deliver impressive quality that is sufficient for beginners on a budget. If you can afford it, a single-lens reflex camera (also called an SLR camera, digital single-lens reflex camera, or DSLR camera) or mirrorless camera can provide more professional quality.\n\nDSLR cameras use a mirror to flip captured images, while mirrorless cameras do not. At one time, DSLR cameras were preferred by the professional photographer, but recently, they're increasingly being phased out by mirrorless cameras. These types of cameras can range in price from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars, so consider your budget and do due diligence before making a significant investment.\n\nTripods improve your photos by stabilizing your camera to prevent shaking or movement. Tripods vary in design and size. For example, some tripods have three-way heads that can be adjusted on one axis at a time for vertical adjustments, horizontal adjustments, or panning, while others use a ball joint that can be loosened to adjust in any direction as needed. Some tripods are small or light enough for portable use, while larger and heavier tripods are meant to remain in studios. Specialized tripods designed to hold smartphones or other small cameras can be mounted to surfaces with suction cups or flexible plastic arms, as with Joby's GorillaPod.\n\nYou can buy a basic tripod for about $30, while more expensive professional tripods can cost thousands of dollars. Select the least expensive tripod suitable for your purposes.\n\nIf you plan to edit your photos using photo editing software such as Photoshop, you should shoot your images in a format known as RAW. As the name indicates, RAW photo files contain images that are unprocessed or virtually unprocessed, preserving all the data captured by the camera. This gives you more control over adjustments done during the editing process.\n\nMost professional cameras and many smartphones give you the option of shooting in RAW. On an iPhone, you can find a ProRAW option under settings for camera formats.\n\nCapturing multiple camera angles allows you to display different qualities of your product. Use full shots to capture your entire product. Add close-up shots to highlight specific product features. Include action shots to show your product in use. If you plan to use 3D models that your customers can zoom on or view from different angles, make sure to capture all the angles you need.\n\nWhen selecting angles, consider your shot composition. Professional photographers follow the rule of threes. This prescribes visually dividing your short into three rows and three columns formed by two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. Place your subject on one of the four points where the lines cross.\n\nImproving the quality of your photos can make your images more eye-catching and persuasive, attracting more clicks and generating more sales conversions. Set the stage for quality photos by cleaning your products, choosing the right lighting, selecting appropriate backgrounds and props, and investing in a good camera and tripod. Shoot quality images by using RAW format, adjusting your settings, capturing multiple angles, placing your product in context, and following consistent procedures. Use photo editing software to bring out the best in your photos.\n\nIf you sell print on demand products through Gelato, you can put your photos to use with the help of the Gelato Mockup Studio tool, available with a Gelato+ subscription.
