        "text": "In the fall of 2008, Mike Federspiel, who knew both the Society’s collection and the organization’s staff and leadership, brokered a deal that was a benefit to the Society and the Clarke. The Clarke would scan the Society’s extensive photographic collection. The Clarke’s copy of the scans vastly enhanced the documentation about Hemingway’s experiences in the region found in the library. The Society, in turn, gained a security copy of their images, and importantly, a place where researchers could see the images during the winter months when their building was closed. The first batch of photos scanned numbered approximately 2,000. Eventually, almost 5,000 images were scanned.\n\nFor several years, the work of collecting and scanning went on quietly and small additions were made to the collection. Frank visited with the members of the Michigan Hemingway Society each year at their annual meeting to report on the organization’s archives and foster relationships with friends and acquaintances. There was a lull in collecting significant new material until March of 2013, when a scrapbook, created by Ernest's mother, Grace Hall Hemingway, went on the auction block. The scrapbook had been created by Grace for her daughter Ursula and included additional family photos.\n\nThe news that the Ursula scrapbook was to be auctioned broke suddenly and late. The auction house was not well-known for handling literary manuscripts and the library staff learned about the sale only a few days before the auction was to take place. There was not much time to find the needed funding, but years of building relationships with people interested in Hemingway paid off.\n\nDean Moore had demonstrated a commitment to help with funding by drawing from Friends of the Libraries money when it was needed. Frank contacted the Dean’s administrative aide, and said that he needed to talk to Tom “today!” about the auction. The Dean’s calendar was booked solid, but they were able to find ten free minutes. The conversation with Tom was not a long one, but after years of working together to develop the collection it was easy to convey both the opportunity and the need in a few words. After a few moments of thought, the Dean once again gave approval for the critical financial support that was needed.\n\nThe library was the successful bidder at the auction. The auction was important not just because the scrapbook was added to the Clarke’s Hemingway collection. The purchase of the scrapbook also answered a question that, for years, had hung over the even-more-interesting scrapbooks Grace Hall Hemingway had created—scrapbooks that remained in Michigan. When the Ursula scrapbook sold at auction, it established a market value for Hemingway family scrapbooks.\n\nThe Jepson purchase, although successful, also made clear that the Hemingway Endowment needed to be substantially increased. Hurried phone calls to likely donors and finding brief moments in Dean Moore's busy schedule made for interesting tales, but it also meant never knowing if there was enough money on hand to make sudden purchases. In July 2013, the library launched a campaign to increase the Hemingway Endowment’s principal from $41,000 to $100,000. The goal was challenging, but by this point, it was also possible to point to a solid track record of success when asking for donations. Today, the endowment principal stands at $97,969, with several legacy bequests that will eventually be received.\n\nWith a market value for a Grace Hall Hemingway scrapbook established, the staff made the decision to approach the second family member of Ernest who lived in Michigan about the idea of a purchase/gift of the Marcelline Hemingway Sanford scrapbooks and other family material. The library had a long and increasingly close relationship with the relative, actually housing the material in the Clarke for many years, while he retained ownership.\n\nThis was, yet again, another crucial moment that depended not only on having money in hand, but having earned the trust and goodwill of a member of the Hemingway family. The scrapbooks, as well as the family papers, were the single greatest treasure that was still in the state. The scrapbooks told, in pictures and captions, the entire story of Ernest Hemingway’s Michigan years. After some discussion, a friendly deal was struck for a combination purchase/gift. The scrapbooks, as well as the family papers, became the library’s in April 2016.\n\nIn April 2018, another extraordinary opportunity to add to the collection appeared. A first edition of Hemingway’s first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was put up for auction. The first short story in the small publication, “Up in Michigan,” made it clear what the young Hemingway thought he knew best and could write about. Once again, with the help of the Endowment, the Dean, and a few key friends, the library was able to obtain one of only 300 original copies of the book.\n\nThe physical processing of a collection with as much important material as found in the Clarke regarding Ernest Hemingway, involved many steps. Along the way, careful notetaking was necessary to be sure important details could be recalled later when it became time to describe the collection intellectually. The first goal is always to retain the existing order of the material or, if necessary, impose a new, easy to understand, logical order. Once an order was established, the Hemingway collection received detailed physical examination.\n\nThe physical examination accomplished several purposes. It removed any material that was not of research value. Things that are not of long-term importance were removed, such as duplicate items, blank pages, or papers that were illegible. Physical examination also removed things that threatened the long-term preservation of the material. These included pins, rubber bands, and sticky notes, any of which could deteriorate the material. In addition, as a matter of routine, acidic or faded materials that had important information but lacked “associational value,” for example a useful newspaper clipping, were photocopied. The copy was kept in place of the original material. Items with associational value could also be copied if they were acidic or faded, but in those cases the original item was also maintained, for example, an original letter written by Ernest Hemingway to which time has not been kind.\n\nAs to be expected, the collection is rich in books and articles written by Hemingway himself. He wrote ten novels, twenty story collections, nine works of nonfiction, and dozens of stories published in magazines such as Life, Esquire, Look, Ken, and Cosmopolitan. The collection has first-edition examples of almost all of these and they range from small, privately printed Paris magazines with his earliest Michigan stories to posthumously published novels edited by others. The crown jewel of the first editions is undoubtedly Three Stories and Ten Poems. Printed in a limited edition of 300 copies in Paris in 1923, it begins with his controversial “Up in Michigan” story. Set in fictional “Hortons” Bay, Michigan, the story so graphically described a sexual episode on a Lake Charlevoix dock that it is said Hemingway’s own parents refused to have the book in their home. Three Stories and Ten Poems was a prelude to a career writing distinguished novels. As his fame increased, his first editions became international bestsellers as foreign publishers joined American printers in making his work available. In Cuba, where he is a national hero, El Viejo el Mar (The Old Man and the Sea) has been published several times.\n\nHemingway’s most famous short story, The Big Two Hearted River, is particularly well represented in the collection. In addition to a copy of This Quarter, the Paris based magazine in which it was originally published in 1926, the library has extremely rare copies of fine art print editions. Published in very limited quantities, one version even includes an original watercolor fishing painting. Complementing the published versions of The Big Two Hearted River found in the collection is an original postcard Ernest sent his father from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula when he was on the fishing trip that inspired the story.\n\nThe printed material and movie-related items constitute a strong Hemingway collection, but the personal papers associated with Ernest Hemingway himself and his immediate family found in the Clarke are what make this collection a world-class resource for those looking to better understand Hemingway’s formative experiences here in Michigan.\n\nCollectors have caused original manuscripts in Hemingway’s own hand to be among the most sought after, selling for thousands of dollars. It is estimated that in his life (a time before tweets, instant messages, and emails) Hemingway composed over six thousand typed and handwritten letters. The Clarke is home to six of them. All but one in the library relate to his Michigan experiences. The six-page, typed letter to his World War I superior, Jim Gamble (1919) gushes with descriptions of Michigan summers. Another letter informs his family of securing a Petoskey boarding house room where he hoped to write; an earlier letter updated his parents on the harvest at their northern Michigan farm. While these were not written to the famous people the established author would come to know, they nevertheless give intriguing insights into how his Michigan experiences influenced him.\n\n• The filming of a 30-minute television documentary, created in cooperation with WCMU-TV and\n\nthen distributed without charge to every public high school in Michigan.\n\n• A companion study guide.\n\n• Publication, in print format, of Hemingway's Michigan: A Driving Tour of Emmet and Charlevoix\n\nCounties, researched and compiled by Ken Marek.\n\n• A website to house the driving tour information.\n\n• A capstone project to place a state historical marker at Walloon Lake, celebrating Hemingway's\n\nMichigan roots.\n\nThe $30,000 funding request associated with the package exceeded the Council's funding cap. It was assumed that, if the application was successful, the Council would choose among the six projects. Instead the Council waived their funding cap, funded all six proposals, and requested key parts of the package be delivered in 90 days. The Great Michigan Read kick-off event would be held at Petoskey's Crooked Tree Arts Center (CTAC), and the Council planned the event to include an enhanced version of the Clarke's now-funded Hemingway traveling exhibit, catalog, and documentary film.\n\nWhen informed of the Council’s decision, the Clarke staff took a very deep breath. The staff had not expected to receive funding for the entire suite of proposals, nor to have three of the most extensive projects done in approximately 90 days. It was, nevertheless, an extraordinary opportunity.\n\nWCMU producer Sarah Adams immersed herself in Hemingway’s story, and created the documentary, much of it filmed in the author’s boyhood haunts. The Clarke team aided by Mike Federspiel, honed the myriad details to create the exhibit, Up North with the Hemingways and Nick Adams. The accompanying published catalog rolled off the presses of CMU’s Printing Services just hours before the premier in Petoskey on July 27.\n\nThe audience was delighted, as was the Michigan Humanities Council. The Clarke had successfully delivered key components of the grant on schedule. The multi-component presentation, featuring a video biography, exhibition, and exhibit catalog was a major accomplishment, possible only through much collaboration and a bit of frenzied dedication. The collaboration with the Michigan Humanities Council was particularly important in that it reinforced the point made by the 2003 exhibit and catalog regarding how central the Clarke was in the documentation of Hemingway in Michigan, as well as the ability of the library to use those exceptional resources to educate the public.\n\nSince its unveiling, the Up North with the Hemingways exhibit has traveled to 35 local libraries, historical societies, and other venues throughout Michigan, often accompanied by speakers, such as the director of the Clarke Historical Library and CMU’s own Hemingway scholar, Mike Federspiel.\n\nIn 2012, the library was offered another unique opportunity to use the Hemingway collection for outreach. The International Hemingway Society chose to hold their biennial conference in the Little Traverse Bay region, bringing an international audience of approximately 600 guests to explore and experience “Hemingway’s Michigan.” As part of the conference, the library staff mounted different exhibits in three venues around the Bay, and cooperated again with WCMU television to create another documentary, Into the North, which focused on the tourist experience in the Little Traverse Bay area between 1890 and 1920, largely the years the Hemingway family came to summer.\n\nThe first and simplest task was to place the traveling exhibit created in 2007, Up North with the Hemingways, back in Petoskey. This time the show was placed in the Carnegie Library Building administered by CTAC. This building was where, in 1919, the young Ernest had made a public presentation about his wartime experiences, and thus a “must see” for the conference attendees. That exhibit also showcased four “treasures” from the Clarke to dazzle the attendees. They included two stories in Hemingway’s hand, written when he was a youth, the Gamble letter, which had been a focus of the 2003 exhibit, and the postcard written by Ernest to his father while fishing in the Upper Peninsula, part of the trip immortalized in the short story, The Big Two Hearted River.\n\nSecond, the exhibit that had been shown in spring 2012 in the Clarke’s galleries, A Delightful Destination: Little Traverse Bay at the Turn of the Century, was reinstalled in the Harbor Springs Area Historical Society, across the bay from Petoskey. This exhibit featured some of the many photographs the library had copied from the Little Traverse Historical Society. Components of that exhibit remain in the area, currently on display in the Emmet County courthouse in Petoskey.\n\nFinally, the Clarke staff cooperated and coordinated with the staff of the LTHS to redesign and update the Society’s Hemingway exhibit. Hemingway’s Michigan Story explored the author’s Michigan experiences and the writing inspired by them. Made possible through funds from the CMU Hemingway Endowment and the Michigan Hemingway Society, the interpretive exhibit was, and continues to be, a key experience in this Petoskey museum, located in the heart of Hemingway’s Michigan haunts.\n\nAll of these activities, coupled with the premiere of Into the North at the conference, allowed the Clarke to make an extraordinary impression on a very important audience. The library showed that it could both use the resources already in hand and help develop new possibilities. It also heartened old friends and allies by demonstrating the library’s continuing importance in documenting the subject.\n\nThe library’s newest Hemingway exhibit continues the library’s longstanding efforts to promote the Hemingway collection, while offering an opportunity to reflect on how “the magic”—from envisioning a collection to building exhibits—comes into existence. An exhibit can be many things: educational, entertaining, interactive, or immersive. But what a good exhibit is not is a book on the wall. Nor is it a comprehensive history. Exhibits capture and communicate the essence of a story, pique the interest of visitors, and inspire further learning.\n\nThe library staff creates two new exhibits each year for the Clarke. Each is a custom exhibit designed using unique criteria established only for that exhibit. The concept is developed, content is researched, techniques are established, components are designed, graphics are acquired, text is written, AV treatments are developed, and final design specifications are created. Then, the exhibit is fabricated and finally, it is installed. Each task is done once and each time it is a brand-new experience with new content and new components. This was the process followed for the current exhibit.\n\nThe foundation of the exhibit design process is based upon the answers to several key questions, which require careful thinking about the purpose of the exhibit. The answers to four questions became the foundation for everything that followed:\n\n1. Why create this new Hemingway exhibit?\n\nThe collection itself and the matrix of collaborators and supporters has evolved greatly since the last exhibit in 2012. The Clarke staff determined it should share recent developments in the collection with supporters and the public to continue to build awareness of the current breadth of the holdings, and expand the endowment and collection.\n\n2. Who is the audience?\n\nEverybody is not an acceptable answer.\n\nBefore beginning, one must determine for whom the exhibit is being designed. An experience created to inspire a 16-year-old may not satisfy a college student or a Hemingway scholar, and vice versa. While the Clarke’s primary purpose is to serve CMU and the success of the student body, the staff determined that, in addition to this goal, the library’s donors and Hemingway enthusiasts should be the primary focus for this exhibition. The hope was to honor donors, attract enthusiasts and scholars, and give insights to CMU students about Hemingway and the Hemingway collection, as well as how professionals in the field of special collections and exhibitions do their jobs.\n\n3. What is the exhibit’s specific objective?\n\nWith two prior exhibits discussing the same general subject, it was necessary to determine how this exhibit would be different from past exhibitions. A custom-designed exhibit, by definition, seeks to create a “unique and extraordinary” experience. The content should be based on a storyline only the Clarke can tell and which it has not told in the past, to assure visitors a unique experience. If a visitor has seen it before, or can find it elsewhere, why would they bother to come and see it here?\n\nFor past exhibits, the collection had been researched to piece together the stories of the author’s childhood experiences, his summers at Walloon Lake, and returning to Michigan after World War I. This exhibit focused on the primary artifacts themselves and the story behind how they found a home in the Clarke. That “backstory” makes this experience unique. For years, people key to the collection’s development have occasionally shared tales. Stories of waiting to hear if an auction bid for a prized letter was high enough to win, and when it wasn’t, how that obstacle was overcome. Stories of how a postcard considered a gem of the collection was found decades after it had fallen between the studs of a wall in a Horton Bay cottage.\n\nThese backstories, the details of how each item came to the Clarke’s collection, are gems in their own right. They illustrate the passion, talent, perseverance, and sometimes luck that contributed to making the Hemingway collection as rich as it is. These stories became key features in the exhibition.\n\n4. Storyline research and “The Gems”\n\nAfter establishing the exhibit objective, one must identify primary materials, sources, text references, and generally “fill in the blanks” regarding the exhibit’s content. This step was less difficult for this exhibit than it sometimes can be. Mike Federspiel, who has helped guide collecting efforts since the beginning of the initiative, served as curator. Mr. Federspiel’s knowledge about Hemingway and of the library’s collection served the work well. If there was a question, Mike could answer it.\n\nThe most basic challenge was to sort through the library’s hundreds, perhaps thousands, of items to find the gems, and the stories associated with them. Prioritization was needed. Mike was asked to identify the gems and his first list included eight categories with forty subcategories. The library staff put their faith in his knowledge and asked for a very much shorter list. Mike executed a tour-de-force by reducing the original list to seven items. His pain was evident, but understanding that “less is more,” he identified only a few items. Having been identified, the exhibit needed to establish a way that visitors, if they remember only one thing, would remember the gems of the collection and something about how they came to be here.\n\nHow to inspire memory is challenging. The gems are composed of items such as letters, envelopes, a magazine cover, and a first-edition publication. All these formats reduce themselves to humble, and in many ways, visually uninteresting text. They are items that might be overlooked if placed among many other objects in one of the Clarke’s large exhibit cases.\n\nTo resolve the problem of how to distinguish the gems, each of them was given a place of honor. Individual exhibition cases were designed for each. To further the aesthetic focus onto the gems, each case was set against a translucent, nine-foot tall banner hanging down from the ceiling. The banners featured the artifact’s title, text interpreting its significance, and the story of how it became part of the collection. These gem-and-banner assemblages were clustered together in the center of the exhibit gallery, parting to create a path to what came to be viewed as the single most important item: the Gamble letter. The plan produced a setting in which each of these very special, one-of-a-kind objects is honored, leading to the one that is both arguably the most important single item in the collection and certainly a keystone in the story of how the Clarke’s Hemingway collection came to be.\n\nMany additional items were featured around the perimeter of the gallery. Four enormous wall-mounted images, including one of Hemingway, served as a visual backdrop to the gems. Distinctly different from the elegant, monochromatic simplicity of the “gem gallery” found in the Clarke Historical Library's Molson Gallery space, was the ambiance in the library's Meijer Gallery space. Here the boldly saturated colors of giant Hemingway movie posters flanked a five-foot video monitor, where a Hemingway biographical documentary played. The experience in this space expounded on the breadth of collection, in a visually explosive manner.\n\nWhile library staff look forward to that use, as well as to continued growth and outreach through exhibits and other tools, those who work in the library acknowledge and thank those who, over two decades, have helped make the Hemingway collection possible. The Michigan Hemingway Society and many of its members have become long-term partners and good friends through the project. Many generous friends have made decisions that greatly benefited the library, while others have donated items to the library. Still others have made financial contributions to enable the library to make important purchases and grow the endowment. The importance of this financial support, sometimes on short notice with requests for not-small amounts of money and other times asking the same individuals to help build the principal of the endowment to continue the work, cannot be overstated. All of this happened through large amounts of goodwill and the help of good friends who the Clarke staff hopes will continue to work with the library in the future."
