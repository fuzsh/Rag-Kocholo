        "text": "One of the most common issues facing my clients is that their colleagues handle templates and documents the \"wrong\" way.\n\nThe formatting is wrong, it's not compliant with brand guidelines, all the documents are inconsistent and some are badly designed...\n\nDesigners and coders can employ certain techniques to fix this. There are, for example, ways to restrict editing in Microsoft Word (apart from the Restrict Editing button). However, this scenario of colleagues not observing the guidelines is a bit like a teenager not observing their parents' rules - the more you tell them not to do something or put obstacles in their way, the more they want to do the thing you hate!\n\nOne thing that I've been asking myself more and more is \"Why are your colleagues doing this?\"\n\nIt's a question we probably don't ask ourselves enough, and yet this could be the source of the solution and in ultimately persuading colleagues to use the formatting guidelines.\n\n\"I don't know Microsoft Word well enough.\"\n\n\"I didn't know what I was doing was wrong\"\n\nPoor training is definitely a factor. When was the last time you attended a Microsoft Word course? If I take anecdotal evidence, I've never met anyone else who's told me they have.\n\nIt's a tool we're just expected to use and get to know by ourselves. No wonder the level of understanding remains generally at \"basic\" to \"slightly confident\". This isn't helped by Microsoft itself - the level of support and advice on their own support channels still needs improving.\n\nDespite all of this, companies should set aside time for their employees to be trained in Microsoft Word. Make it more personal and use company documents as course material. That way, the training becomes more relevant.\n\nSo if you're asking the question \"Why\" and one answer is \"I don't know how to use MS Word that well\", then quality customised training could be an answer.\n\n\"The templates just don't work well for me\"\n\nThis statement hides a multitude of true reasons. It could genuinely be that the template doesn't \"work\" for them - i.e. the template doesn't suit the content they have to use for their clients.\n\nIn this case, companies and managers should definitely ask formatters what material they regularly use in their documents. This feedback can then be used to amend the templates; if the changes really don't suit the brand, then find another solution that suits the formatters' needs.\n\nThe art of persuasion is not prohibiting someone from doing something; it's encouraging them to do something else that suits them AND you.\n\nNow on to the more difficult-but-true reason: \"I just don't like the template/I just fancy changing it\".\n\nThis reason appears completely illogical. The purpose of templates is to save time. And yet people completely reformat documents, consequently wasting time doing something that's already been done and is not their job.\n\nAsk them why. This is difficult because they (a) may not truly know (b) do know but don't want to tell you.\n\nFor (b), I'll tell you. I believe some people distract themselves when their actual job isn't interesting or engaging enough. Doing something artistic like \"colouring in\" text and shapes is a pleasurable act that delays them having to what they're actually paid to do.\n\nRelated to that, I've recently become familiar with the term \"bikeshedding\", otherwise known as \"Parkinsonâ€™s Law of Triviality\". In summary, it refers to a case where a committee is asked to discuss a proposal for a nuclear power plant and a bike shed. It spends too little time discussing the more expensive (and crucial) power plant but spends ages talking about the details of the bike shed. Read this article to find out more https://fs.blog/2020/04/bikeshed-effect/\n\nOK, I'm familiar with the problems - how do I solve them?\n\nIn an Economic Times article - Five ways to persuade colleagues to do things your way - one of the tips is particularly useful:\n\n\"You may have the power to mandate a solution, or even enforce it. But others have to be convinced that it is a fair solution. If you adopt a consultative approach, you can seek suggestions from others and thereby involve them in problem solving as well.\" (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/five-ways-to-persuade-colleagues-to-do-things-your-way/articleshow/6951292.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)\n\nI suggest, if you haven't already, reading books and watching videos on persuasion and negotiation. You could be dealing with a group of people who just want to do what they want, regardless of what you tell them.\n\nThis group of people ultimately want to feel a sense of control and are probably expressing it through changing how the templates look or where they're located. Maybe they're rebelling against a \"top-down\" order in which they've had no contribution and feel they haven't been considered in.\n\nThis is why asking \"Why\" is so important. People are less likely to rebel against something they've had a hand in creating. If they know they've been asked what their needs are understand the templates are meeting those needs, they are more likely to comply to your rules - because they are their rules, too.\n\nUsing persuasion and negotiation tactics can certainly help convince colleagues that these templates can meet their needs, with very little change to the files themselves.\n\nLet's finish on an inconvenient truth: not everyone with access to MS Word should be editing or formatting documents\n\nI know it's harsh, but the intention of this article is to encourage people to really consider reality. Just because a car is outside a home doesn't mean everyone inside it is qualified to drive it. The same analogy applies here - just because Microsoft Word is on every device, doesn't mean everyone is qualified or has the desire to use it properly.\n\nUsers want to use MS Word for advanced, better-designed documents, even though Adobe InDesign and even Microsoft's own Publisher exist and handle this job better. MS Word is still essentially a word processor. Best for simple files like letters, text-heavy reports and mailing labels.\n\nSo if companies is going to use MS Word for more advanced work, the question I think they and their teams ought to ask themselves is:\n\n\"Should the people currently formatting documents for external audiences actually be doing this job?\"\n\nWe live in an age where people are expected to do more in their job. Where people expect to have more control over what they do, even if they're not qualified or skilled to do it.\n\nIf your brand truly matters, if the consistency of your proposals or pitches is of great importance, should the look and feel of your corporate communications be in the hands of those who just don't get it? Or even worse, don't want to get it?\n\nLet me know what good books and videos on persuasion and negotiation tactics you've read or how you've managed to convince reluctant colleagues to do things your way."
