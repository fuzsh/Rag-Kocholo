        "text": "\"Over the last two decades digital technologies have helped transform the creation and circulation of commercial photographs for advertising and marketing. Yet despite this transformation, scholarship on advertising images and commercial photography has remained largely unaltered – often merely a feeble echo of the critique of commodity fetishism - and is rarely informed by an analysis of how most of these images are currently made and distributed. This chapter offers ways to rethink the digitized proliferation of commercial images by focusing on the business that produces the overwhelming majority of them: the contemporary stock photography industry. It looks at how digital technologies have helped to destabilize and reconfigure commercial visual culture in a number of overlapping domains: the shift to an informational understanding of photographs as ‘visual content’ that blurs traditional distinctions between editorial, art and advertising images; the advent of ‘microstock’ and photo-sharing sites that have ostensibly broken down barriers between amateur and professional photographers; the rise and tribulations of global stock photography corporations dominating commercial image-production; and the massive expansion in exploitable distribution networks and presentation platforms. In the process it asks whether advertising and commercial imagery are undergoing forms of democratization through the ‘crowdsourcing’ of image-production and editing functions; whether ubiquitous media and multi-tasking practices are producing an impossibly crowded visual environment that signals the irrelevance of the individual photograph and the supremacy of ‘thumbnail visibility’ and aggregate images; and ultimately whether – despite these transformations in production, circulation and consumption - much has really changed at all in the semantic content of most consumer photographs. \"\n\nFrom the point of view of cultural critique and theories of the public sphere, stock photography seems virtually unredeemable. Largely hidden from the public, the stock industry nevertheless creates the bulk of commercial still images (and much of the video footage) used in advertising, marketing and publishing across a range of print, visual and digital media, and also controls key historical and photojournalistic archives. Its operations so patently exemplify processes of standardization, commodification, alienation, illusion and stereotypical classification that it is hard to think of a better pedagogical example for introductory courses on the theory of the culture industry or the society of the spectacle. Moreover, its core product - the ‘generic image’ – seems an utter betrayal of the very essence of photography as the epiphanic trace of a unique referent. Stock photography, then, is doubly ‘fallen’: it is the perfect ‘bad object’ of both cultural production research and photography theory. Viewing stock photography as a media industry and as a cultural practice, the cultural critic stands awe-struck, overwhelmed by the purifying urge to unveil its invisibility and deconstruct its seeming banality. This paper fleshes out the familiar terms of this critique (for which the author bears some responsibility), and the political-scholarly impulses it entails. And then it asks: is that all? Is there nothing remaining to be said about a cultural phenomenon like stock photography except that we would be better off without it? Or – reading it dialectically with the help of Walter Benjamin and Fredric Jameson – that it (at best) fleetingly reveals the utopian dynamic nesting at the heart of capitalist modes of cultural production? Or are there other things we can learn from stock photography as a social and aesthetic practice: about the irreducibility of media to ontological essences, about the circulation of attention and the multifariousness of public representation, and about the generality of photographs as agents of similarity and connectivity among strangers? Thinking about stock photography beyond its traditional critique – treating it as a good ‘bad object’ - can open up new directions for assessing the public value of apparently debased forms.\n\nPhotography scholars have long acknowledged that photography is the progeny of industrial society. However, despite the increase in historical studies of the medium’s industrial-commercial dimensions, and a smaller number of contemporary sociological and cultural investigations, no attempt has been made to produce an overall account of photography as a cultural industry. This chapter aims to help fill that gap. Moving across public and private photographic contexts, and popular and elite genres, it elaborates photography’s relation to four core problematics: the historical phases of industrial cultural production; cultural labor and economic and cultural capital; the tension between standardization and innovation; and dominant production logics of digital culture. In the process it draws upon traditions of analyzing cultural industries in media studies, the political economy of communication and the sociology of culture to rethink photography’s long-term trajectories as a modern cultural endeavor.\n\nThe major source of material for the research was the archive of the E.Chambré Hardman’s Trust. This archive comprises Hardman’s bequest of photographs, negatives and associated ephemera. Prior to the present research the author had undertaken extensive ordering and conservation of this collection and the present work therefore builds upon this earlier research. The research divides Hardman’s oeuvre into portraiture and landscape, along lines that he had determined by ordering and concern. The thesis focuses exclusively on his landscape photography. The representation of landscape is a recognised genre within the history of art. The thesis locates the landscape photography of the British photographer Edward Chambré Hardman (1898-1988) within the histories of landscape photography and to the broader genre of landscape representation by British artists during the first half of the twentieth century. The research describes the representations of landscape made by painters prior to the ..."
