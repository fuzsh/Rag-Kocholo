        "text": "Recording equipment, high-speed computers, graphic design and video editing programs –the Adobe Creative Commons has been a collaborative project between UNM University Libraries, UNM Information Technologies, and Adobe to create a digital media workspace and resource center for all creative pursuits on campus. The UNM organizations and Adobe are excited to host a grand opening for the space on Wednesday, Nov. 9 from 11 a.m. – 1 p.m. on the first floor of Zimmerman Library.\n\nThe Adobe Creative Commons grand opening will be an open house with demonstrations, refreshments, and free giveaways throughout the space and will also feature speakers from Adobe, UNM Information Technologies, UNM University Libraries at 12:15 p.m. to celebrate the new resource space.\n\nThe Adobe Creative Commons provides resources including high-powered computers, several secluded editing bays, two fully equipped audio booths, and a wide variety of audio-visual equipment available for checkout. All of the computers are equipped with Adobe Creative Cloud apps and services to help students create. The space also includes the Lobo Brain Bar – an IT service desk to help community members with basic operating system support. The space is a resource for all Lobos – students, staff, and faculty.\n\n“The Creative Commons has so much potential. Digital skills are for everyone, whether your field is in the arts, STEM, or somewhere in between,” said Dayna Diamond, multimedia development specialist for the Adobe Creative Commons. “The goal is for the Creative Commons to serve more people, increase everyone’s digital skills, and become a campus hub for digital media.”\n\nDiamond joined the University Libraries earlier this semester. She received her Master of Fine Arts in Digital Arts and News Media from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Diamond is also a UNM alum receiving her undergraduate degree in Economics and German.\n\n“The Adobe Creative Commons has been a great addition to the University Libraries as we strive to create engaging spaces for students,” said Leo Lo, dean of College of University Libraries and Learning Sciences. “We are excited to continue seeing the new opportunities the Adobe Creative Commons will offer UNM students and the UNM community as a whole.”\n\n“The space will provide a home for the Creative Campus initiative and provide students with a place to experiment, collaborate, and get support for creative projects,” said Elisha Allen, director of Online Strategies and Academic Technologies. “I can’t wait to see the innovative work that students will produce using these tools and this space.”\n\nAs an Adobe Creative Campus, the UNM community can access the Adobe Creative Cloud software under the special licensing and price structure negotiated with Adobe. This includes access to the Adobe Creative Cloud on all their devices anywhere anytime which includes a collection of 20+ apps for photography, video, design, web, UX, and social media – plus integrated essentials like color palettes, font families, and the power to collaborate on creative projects.\n\n“Adobe and The University of New Mexico are committed to providing students of all majors with the tools that are foundational to building their creative skill sets and ultimately, becoming digitally literate,” said Karen Steele, director of Adobe Education, North America. “Greater access to Adobe Creative Cloud enables The University of New Mexico to expand its innovative teaching practices and seamlessly nurture creative problem solving among students to ensure that they are prepared both inside and outside of the classroom.”\n\nAs an Adobe Creative Campus, UNM is part of a select group of colleges and universities that are driving the future of digital literacy within the global higher education community. UNM recognizes the value of teaching creative and persuasive digital communication skills, and actively advancing these skills throughout curricula to help students succeed in the classroom and gain an edge in the competitive modern workplace.\n\n“The newly established Adobe Creative Commons puts into play a high-end physical environment with equipment and staffing to provide our students, faculty and staff with critical resources to better leverage the Adobe Creative Cloud tools. This is yet another offering in UNM's Adobe Creative Campus to help our community tell stories, convey ideas, and explore their creativity – skills that are critical in the world today,\" said Duane Arruti, chief information officer at UNM. \"I am thrilled to see this investment continue to enhance the capabilities of our wonderful faculty and very engaged students in taking our curriculum to new levels in ways that differentiate teaching and learning experiences at UNM.”"
