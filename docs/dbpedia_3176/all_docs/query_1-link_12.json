        "text": "Hi everybody... I'm new to the forum, and I hope someone can answer this. I migrated from Photoshop Elements and have been using LR5 for a while. I'm really seeing the power and flexibility of LR over PSE, but one thing that I can't seem to find anywhere in LR is the ability to know when an image was imported into the catalog. I've searched through the user's guide, books, blogs, forums... you name it. It seems like this MUST be stored somewhere in the database since you can sort your displayed images based on the date added... so it has to know, right? However, it seems you can't access that date anywhere. I suppose I could create a metadata keyword during import, but then I need to remember to do that every time I import. (I don't import into date folders, I usually organize that information by location or event.)\n\nSo does anyone know if there is a token that is available that would return the Import Date so I could use that in a Collection Filter or Export Preset for backup purposes? I would be willing to dig into Plugin development if this information was available under the hood, but I couldn't even find it looking through the LR SDK documentation. Photoshop Elements makes this field easily available, does LR fall short here?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nClem\n\nThanks, Jim. Here's why I think it would be helpful. The catalog is a database and that gets backed up weekly according to my LR preferences (or more frequently if I'm making a lot of changes). My images are another matter. I import them in and make a backup copy of them at that time. So far so good. The images are backed up and the catalog is backed up.\n\nThe place where things get a little risky is when I use a plugin (e.g. NIK Viveza) to do some pixel-based edits. In that case, it converts the raw file to TIFF and throws me into the plugin. When I Save the image in the plug-in it returns me to LR with a new image file labeled IMG_1234Edit.tif. And THIS image file is not backed up anywhere.\n\nSo I was thinking I could make a Smart Collection called Incremental Backups that automatically filtered any images that were imported into LR after my last image backup date. Then I could back these images up or even make a Publish preset that copied just these images to my backup drive. Afterwards, I would simply change the date on the Smart Collection filter, and I'm all set for next time. As long as the Smart Collection contains 0 photos, I know I have all my images saved in 2 places. It's just how I tend to manage my backups... and it worked well using the Organizer in PS Elements. I would do a full backup once in a long while, then a bunch of incremental backups in between. And I was thinking that I could do a similar approach in LR. I hope that explains it.\n\nThe catalog is a database and that gets backed up weekly according to my LR preferences (or more frequently if I'm making a lot of changes). My images are another matter.

And THIS image file is not backed up anywhere.\n\nI don't know that you cannot do what you want, but I think you are working hard to make lightroom do something that your backup program(s) should do for you. Windows (and I presume Mac if you are of that persuasion) keep track of which files are changed/backed up. Just have all your images (including plugin output) in a folder, and tell your favorite backup program \"backup anything in this tree that changes\".\n\nI think that otherwise you're going to get stuck in a bit of a recursion - even if you could get it to do what you want, then you have to get it to STOP doing it after you back up, so it only shows those changed and NOT backed up. And that's just not something it seems to keep track of (but is definitely something the OS does).\n\nI don't know that you cannot do what you want, but I think you are working hard to make lightroom do something that your backup program(s) should do for you.\n\nWell, I can't argue with that. I was hoping to just do this out of LR. My PC data and all non-photography stuff is backed up separately, but due to disk space limitations, I tend to keep all my images on a separate external drive and this drive is not part of my \"normal\" PC backup, so I manually save these images when they are imported. It's really just a matter of convenience; I tend to work on just a few images at a time, but I want to make sure that I have them in 2 places before I reformat the Compact Flash card. To your point on recursion, what I would do (if I could do it) is perform the incremental backup, then update the Smart Collection filter to reflect the date of the latest backup, so from that point on it would only collect photos imported that were not backed up.\n\nWhat are you using to make a backup copy at the same time as you import? If you're using the \"Make Second Copy\" option, be aware that this really isn't a \"backup\" of the file structure that you create during import, i.e. it's really designed as an immediate insurance copy of the camera card, thus allowing the card to be re-used if necessary before the system-wide backup process is initiated. Using it as a true backup fails completely should you need to use it after a failure of the drive containing the originals, as the folder structures are completely different....this makes it virtually useless in the event of such a disk failure.\n\nI understand what you are saying. I don't use the second copy feature; every photo is identified by a unique name/number, and I don't rename or move them after importing. Oftentimes my backups are just burned to DVD because the cost is so cheap. So if LR is missing an image, I know where to find it based on the file name. I can see how that is making me stick to a fixed set of rules that are prone to human error, but it served me well with PS Elements and I was hoping I could carry that same procedure forward into LR and even automate it a bit with the Smart Collections and Publish presets. It's a little more hassle if I need to recover, but for archive, I feel better about images on a DVD than on a drive that has moving parts and electronics waiting to fail.\n\nBut my whole premise is dependent on knowing when the image was imported into the catalog and dog-gone-it, they just don't want to make that field available for some reason.\n\nOh well, I guess I need to rethink my backup strategy and come up with something different. I guess it's time to look into buying another hard drive or some cloud based storage. Thanks for the info, guys. You confirmed what I suspected.\n\nI was going to suggest ChronSync, but I just realised you're on a Windows based machine.\n\nFor those on Mac that may be wondering about backing up or synchronising modified files across multiple storage locations, ChronoSync is perfect. I use it across both Mac and Windows machines in order to maintain Synchronised audio files that I may be editing (I record Orchestras and Choirs) (Note, the Windows machine in this instance is just an added storage location for safety). Although ChronoSync doesn't get installed on the Windows machine, it sees it on the network and treats it like any other computer.\n\nChronoSync allows many different ways to backup, replace or synchronise files across many drives at once. It does this based on the time stamp of files, so for the OP it would have been ideal.\n\nFor instance, I have a ChronoSync 'document' (the instruction file) that backs up my wifes MacBook when she turns it on (and it joins the network). After the 'initial' full copy of files, the document is set to copy modified files from the MacBook, to an external USB HDD attached to my iMac. It also duplicates that copy to another drive. The same occurs with an old Windows XP laptop. When that is turned on, and the ChronoSync Scheduler sees it appear on the network, it too (selected files only) gets backed up to external USB HDD attached to the iMac.\n\nBut, you can also set ChronoSync to 'Synchronise' and back up in both directions (and keep deletions to any number of versions). You might use this when you are editing files on a MacBook and also a desktop iMac, so the files (and edits) are up to date on both machines.\n\nYou can also run the documents manually or as a set of documents performing a number of step in the process."
