        "text": "Every photographer knows that you can turn average-looking photos into stunners with Adobe Photoshop. But, unless you are a Photoshop ninja, that can sometimes be harder and more time-consuming than you might think. If thatâs you, then there are other applications to the rescue. One of the most comprehensive is Boris FX Optics, which evolved out of Digital Film Tools and Tiffen Dfx when the developers became part of the Boris FX family in 2020.\n\nIn addition to photographic enhancements, Optics integrates additional Boris FX tools, such as Sapphire filters and Particle Illusion emitters. The toolbox features over 180 filters with thousands of presets in ten categories: Color, Diffusion/Blurs, Film Lab, Grads/Tints, Image, Lens/Distort, Light, Render, Stylize, and Particle Illusion.\n\nThe new Optics 2024 update adds eight filters (Atmospheric Glow, Magic Sharp, Orbs, Prism, S_PrismLens, Smoke and Fog, Super LED, and S_UltraGrain) and over 100 more presets. In addition, the Particle Illusion category within Optics gains masking functions, 3D deflectors, force turbulence, and more.\n\nOptics 2024 works in both macOS and Windows and can either be used as a standalone application or as a plugin within Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and Lightroom Classic. As a plugin, you can send a layer from Photoshop to Optics, make your changes in Optics, and then send that enhanced image back into Photoshop. Alternatively, simply open an image directly into the standalone application.\n\nItâs worth noting that this also works with photo browsers like Adobe Bridge and Apple Photos, using their âopen withâ or âedit withâ contextual commands. I actually prefer to use Bridge, because you can quickly browse photos and select favorites. The additional advantage to Bridge over Lightroom in a facility operation is that it can browse images on networked, shared storage. Lightroom only works properly with local storage.\n\nEase of use\n\nThe primary attraction to using Optics over other photographic enhancement tools is that its operation is fast and intuitive. A range of image formats is supported (including camera raw) and you can then save the results back to that image or to a copy, depending on your workflow. The interface is designed for speed. Select a category, filter, and preset â then make adjustments to taste. As you make your selections, all of the interface thumbnails are displayed using that current image, which eliminates a lot of guesswork. You can quickly jump between filters and presets to explore ideas and potential looks.\n\nOptics uses a Photoshop-style layer system with blend modes and opacity values for each layer. Only one filter effect or enhancement can be applied to a layer at a time. But you can create a custom design by stacking several layers with different effects and bending values on each. Layers can be enabled, disabled, duplicated, or deleted, and what you see will be the final result. Plus, there are several ways to make A/B comparisons and splits between the original and final or between two different layers.\n\nSince you have so many options to choose from, the filters panel includes a search function. Click anywhere into the filter panel and hit the Enter key to activate the search field. Type in a term, such as âvignette,â and the filter panel will display only those options. Click the Escape key to exit search and see all of the categories and filters again within the panel. Presets can also be tagged as a favorite by clicking the star icon on the preset panel. Tagged presets will appear in the Favorites category of the filter panel for quick access in the future. Thatâs handy for those filters that you use most often. Of course, thereâs access to the User Guide right from the appâs help menu if you have questions.\n\nMasking\n\nLayers are enhanced with a masking system, where image areas and objects can be isolated using spot, gradient, path, snap, selection, paint, or EZ Mask tools. Multiple masks can be applied to the same layer. The EZ Mask function is quite interesting. As I discussed in my original 2020 review, simply paint loose strokes on the inside and outside of an object. Left-mouse paint strokes inside (green lines) and right-mouse strokes outside (red lines). Let the computer calculate the selection and you quickly have a useful mask.\n\nThe mask can be inverted, depending on whether you want a layer effect to happen inside or outside of the mask. Letâs say you want a person in the photo to be in full color, but everything around them in black-and-white. Create the mask for the person. Make the color enhancements for the person (inside of the mask area). Create a new layer and drag the mask to that next layer to copy it. Invert the mask and make the black-and-white adjustment for the background.\n\nParticle Illusion\n\nParticle Illusion was added in the 2022 update. It features over 1700 presets, including groups for Smoke, Fire, Water, Sparkles, Explosions, Dust, Sci-Fi, and more. Typically you would use these as atmospheric enhancements. However, given the variety, there are plenty of ways to push the style into something unique.\n\nUnlike similar filters/effects in other applications, Particle Illusion effects are not simple overlays. They are adjustable and integrated into the layer. For instance, the appearance, path, branches, and other variables of a lightning bolt emitter can be customized. Many of these emitters effects are time-based. If you only want to generate a still image, then scrub through the time parameter until you find the best frame of the emitter animation to use.\n\nOn the other hand, Optics can also be used to create motion cinemagraphs, which are still images (your photo) with a moving element (the animated emitter). This can create the illusion of something frozen in time. One simple example of this that Boris FX uses in their tutorial is a cup of coffee with moving smoke coming from the top of the cup. When you are ready to export, the Particle Illusion interface will open for you to set the video export parameters. In this case, youâll be exporting a movie file instead of a still photo.\n\nBatch processing\n\nOne feature thatâs easily overlooked is Opticsâ built-in batch processing tool. Letâs say you have a series of stills to which you want to apply the same correction, like grain or a film stock preset. The first step would be to open a representative photo and set up your look with any custom adjustments. Save that as a preset file and close the image. Open the batch window, add the files to be processed and apply the custom preset that you just saved. Images can be resized as part of the export process. The last step is to start the batch process, which includes setting the target destination for the rendered files.\n\nEven though Optics is a stills application, batch processing can also be used in some video effects situations, since some cameras generate media as image sequence files. Therefore, supported formats can be processed by Optics as if the frames were a folder of individual photos. For example, flat, log, or camera raw image sequences could be corrected with a custom look. The images would be processed and then subsequently assembled into a movie file using another application, such as After Effects.\n\nPerformance\n\nIn testing the update for this review, I was using a variety of high-res images from various cameras shot by different photographers. Many were Canon EOS camera raw files (5472 x 3648) at around 24MB in size. But, I also had RED 4K and Blackmagic 6K files in the mix. Optics 2024 is installed on my 2020 Intel iMac â older, but still plenty of power. Optics was well-behaved and responsive, but several things did impact performance. If I built up a lot of layers â especially with Particle Illusion emitters and/or masks â responsiveness slowed a bit. Not a showstopper, but noticeable.\n\nIf you are an avid photographer who likes to enhance your photos â whether for professional reasons or simply enjoyment â Boris FX Optics 2024 gives you a complete photo lab in one easy-to-use and efficient application. There are many more options than anything available in Photoshop or Lightroom and you donât have to be a photo-styling guru to get great results. As with other Boris FX products, there are plenty of official Optics tutorials, as well as numerous videos to be found on YouTube.\n\nClick through the gallery images below to see examples of looks and styles created by me using Boris FX Optics 2024.\n\nÂ©2024 Oliver Peters\n\nSubscribers to Adobe Creative Cloud have a whole suite of creative tools at their fingertips. I believe most users often overlook some of the less promoted features. Here are five quick tips for your workflow. (Click on images to see an enlarged view.)\n\nCamera Raw. Photographers know that the Adobe Camera Raw module is used to process camera raw images, such as .cr2 files. Itâs a âdevelopâ module that opens first when you import a camera raw file into Photoshop. Itâs also used in Bridge and Lightroom. Many people use Photoshop for photo enhancement â working with the various filters and adjustment layer tools available. What may be overlooked is that you can use the Camera Raw Filter in Photoshop on any photo, even if the file is not raw, such as a JPEG or TIFF.\n\nSelect the layer containing the image and choose the Camera Raw Filter. This opens that image into this separate âdevelopâ module. There you have all the photo and color enhancement tools in a single, comprehensive toolkit â the same as in Lightroom. Once youâre done and close the Camera Raw Filter, those adjustments are now âbakedâ into the image on that layer.\n\nRemix. Audition is a powerful digital audio workstation application that many use in conjunction with Premiere Pro or separately for audio productions. One feature it has over Premiere Pro is the ability to use AI to automatically edit the length of music tracks. Letâs say you have a music track thatâs 2:47 in length, but you want a :60 version to underscore a TV commercial. Yes, you could manually edit it, but Audition Remix turns this into an âautomagicâ task. This is especially useful for projects where you donât need to have certain parts of the song time to specific visuals.\n\nOpen Audition, create a multitrack session, and place the music selection on any track in the timeline. Right-click the selection and enable Remix. Within the Remix dialogue box, set the target duration and parameters â for example, short versus long edits. Audition will calculate the number and location of edit points to seamlessly shorten the track to the approximate desired length.\n\nAudition attempts to create edits at points that are musically logical. You wonât necessarily get an exact duration, since the value you entered is only a target. This is even more true with tracks that have a long musical fade-out. A little experimentation may be needed. For example, a target value of :59 will often yield significantly different results than a target of 1:02, thanks to the recalculation. Auditionâs remix isnât perfect, but will get you close enough that only minimal additional work is required. Once you are happy, bounce out the edited track for the shortened version to bring into Premiere Pro.\n\nPhotoshop Batch Processing. If you want to add interesting stylistic looks to a clip, then effects filters in Premiere Pro and/or After Effects usually fit the bill. Or you can go with expensive third party options like Continuum Complete or Sapphire from Boris FX. However, donât forget Photoshop, which includes many stylized looks not offered in either of Adobeâs video applications, such as specific paint and brush filters. But, how do you apply those to a video clip?\n\nThe first step is to turn your clip into an image sequence using Adobe Media Encoder. Then open a representative frame in Photoshop to define the look. Create a Photoshop action using the filters and settings you desire. Save the action, but not the image. Then create a batch function to apply that stored action to the clean frames within the image sequence folder. The batch operation will automatically open each image, apply the effects, and save the stylized results to a new destination folder.\n\nOpen that new image sequence using any app that supports image sequences (including QuickTime) and save it as a ProRes (or other) movie file. Stylized effects, like oil paint, are applied to individual frames and will vary with the texture and lighting of each frame; therefore, the stitched movie will display an animated appearance to that effect.\n\nAfter Effects for broadcast deliverables. After Effects is the proverbial Swiss Army knife for editors and designers. Itâs my preferred conversion tool when I have 24p masters that need to be delivered as 60i broadcast files.\n\nImport a 23.98 master and place it into a new composition. Scale, if needed (UHD to HD, for instance). Send to the Render Queue. Set the frame rate to 29.97, field render to Upper (for HD), and enable pulldown (any whole/split frame cadence is usually OK). Turn off Motion Blur and Frame Blending. Render for a proper interlaced broadcast deliverable file.\n\nPhotoshop motion graphics. One oft-ignored (or forgotten) feature of Photoshop is that you can do layer-based video animation and editing within. Essentially thereâs a very rudimentary version of After Effects inside Photoshop. While you probably wouldnât want to use it for video instead of using After Effects or Premiere Pro, Photoshop does have a value in creating animated lower thirds and other titles.\n\nPhotoshop provides much better text and graphic style options than Premiere Pro. The files are more lightweight than an After Effects comp on your Premiere timeline â or rendering animated ProRes 4444 movies. Since itâs still a Photoshop file (albeit a special version), the âedit in originalâ command opens the file in Photoshop for easy revisions. Letâs say you are working on a show that has 100 lower thirds that slide in and fade out. These can easily be prepped for the editor by the graphics department in Photoshop â no After Effects skills required.\n\nCreate a new file in Photoshop, turn on the timeline window, and add a new blank video layer. Add a still onto a layer for positioning reference, delete the video layer, and extend the layers and timeline to the desired length. Now build your text and graphic layers. Keyframe changes to opacity, position, and other settings for animation. Delete the reference image and save the file. This is now a keyable Photoshop file with embedded animation properties.\n\nImport the Photoshop file into Premiere with Merged Layers. Add to your timeline. The style in Premiere should match the look created in Photoshop. It will animate based on the keyframe settings created in Photoshop.\n\nÂ©2021 Oliver Peters\n\nYou may know him as a speaker, trainer, or web presenter. Or from the long-running Digital Production Buzz podcast series. Or his 2 Reel Guys series with the late Norman Hollyn. Regardless of how, Larry Jordan is well-known by most working and aspiring video professionals. But Jordan is also an accomplished author, with several books to his credit. The latest is Techniques of Visual Persuasion + Create powerful images that motivate.\n\nCommercials, corporate videos, or entertainment â the art of persuasion is at the heart of what every editor does. Persuasion is about convincing someone to want to do whatever action you want to have happen or to share a feeling you are trying to convey. In addition to creating persuasive messages, we ourselves are also consumers and recipients of these same communications. Therefore, knowledge and understanding is key. It is Jordanâs premise that with modern lifeâs faster pace, proper communication today is more like haiku than a lengthy report. Every professional needs to know how to make their presentation â whether spoken, still, or motion â succinct and impactful. This book is perfectly laid out to get that point across.\n\nTechniques of Visual Persuasion is arranged into three sections. The first covers the fundamentals of persuasion. The second is about developing persuasive still images and the last section is about persuasive motion images. This book is arranged like a text book, which is a good thing. Itâs well-researched and detailed. Each chapter starts with the goals to be covered and ends with a recap. Each is also capped off with an anecdote (like Larry starting a fire in a TV studio) or a guest contributorâs point-of-view. The pages are illustrated nicely with sidebars, images, and charts that help make the point of how and why one example is more inviting or persuasive than another.\n\nJordan covers a wide range of theoretical and practical advice, such as the 180-degree rule, the rule of thirds, three-point lighting, sans serif vs. serif fonts, and much more. But itâs not all just concepts. Jordan has a lengthy background in software training, including several books around Final Cut Pro and Adobe products, as well as his PowerUp series of videos.\n\nSection two includes two chapters on the basics of Photoshop with practical examples of how to use its tools to enhance and repair still images and create layered composites. Section three goes even deeper into real-world experience. Jordan covers topics, such as suggested camera and audio equipment, interviewing techniques, how to properly record audio, and how to properly plan and produce a video shoot. This section also goes deepest into software basics, including a detailed look at Adobe Audition, Apple Final Cut Pro X, and Apple Motion.\n\nTechniques of Visual Persuasion is a like a college film program condensed into under 400 informative pages. All of it written in a very engaging manner. I found that itâs not only a good first read, but useful to have around for a quick reference, whether you are just entering the field or have been in the business for years. Larry Jordan is a gifted presenter who can express complex topics in an easy-to-digest manner and this latest book is no exception.\n\nÂ©2020 Oliver Peters\n\nAdobe Photoshop and Lightroom are ubiquitous digital photography processing tools that hold a place in nearly every pro and semi-pro photographerâs toolkit. From straight-up image correction and enhancement to wildly creative looks, itâs hard to beat what these tools offer. However, when you get into the stylistic filter options, Photoshop looks a bit stale. You can certainly push the artwork to new levels, but it takes talent and often a lot of work. Thatâs not in step with todayâs mindset, where powerful, yet simple-to-use effects tools are the norm. (Click any image in this post for an enlarged view.)\n\nEnter Optics for Photoshop\n\nLast September Boris FX acquired the award-winning effects developers Digital Film Tools and Silhouette. Optics is a new tool developed since this acquisition, specifically designed for the photography market. It features a plug-in for Photoshop and Lightroom (as well as Bridge), which is paired with its own standalone application. Optics shares design similarities with DFT, but also integrates other BorisFX products, such as 75 of the Sapphire filters â a first for Photoshop users. According to Marco Paolini, Optics product designer for Boris FX (and co-founder of DFT and Silhouette), âOptics is the only Photoshop plug-in that specifically simulates optical camera filters with presets based on real-world diffusion filters, as well as realistic simulations of film stocks and motion picture lab processes.â\n\nTo use Optics from within Photoshop, simply apply the Optics filter effect to a layer, which opens the Optics Photoshop plug-in. If you first converted that layer into a Smart Object in Photoshop, then the final Optics result will be applied as a Smart Filter and can be toggled on and off in Photoshop. Otherwise, that layer will appear with the âbaked inâ result once you exit Optics. From Lightroom or Bridge, use the âedit withâ command to route the image to the Optics application. Lightroom will send either the original version of the image or with any Lightroom effects applied. When done, a processed copy of the âsentâ image appears in Lightroom. The Optics Standalone application supports an extensive set of camera raw file formats in addition to JPEG, TIFF, DPX and Kodak CIN files.\n\nFilters and looks galore\n\nOptics offers 160 filters with thousands of customizable presets. The filters are grouped into nine categories, including color, diffusion, stylize, and more. The user interface is designed with tools and controls bordering around the image. Top â tool bar for masking and view control. Left side â the layers stack. Bottom â filter groups and selection. Right side â two tabs for presets and parameter adjustments. You can show or hide these panels as you like, depending on what you need to see at the time. Resolution choices for the image viewer include 1K, 2K, 4K, 5K, 6K, 8K, and Full resolution. The available choices in the resolution menu are dynamic depending on the size of your image. A lower resolution helps to speed up processing results on lower-powered machines, but youâll want Full to correctly judge some effects, like sharpening.\n\nIf you are comfortable in Photoshop, then you already know how to use Optics. You can build up complex effects using a combination of different filters by using layers. Each layer can be masked and includes all of the usual composite modes. Optics uses floating point processing. This means you can blow out highlights or exposure in one layer, but then bring it down again without information loss in a higher layer. Test out different looks simply by building them onto different layers. Then toggle a layer on or off to see one look versus another. For instance, maybe youâre not sure if you want a sepia look. Just make one layer sepia, disable it, and add a new layer for a different style. Then enable or disable layers to compare.\n\nThe EZ Mask is a super-cool function. Letâs say you want to separate a fashion model from the background. First draw rough mask lines for the interior (the model), then rough lines for the exterior or background. Optics will then calculate a very accurate mask. Trim/adjust the mask and re-calculate as needed to better refine the edge. Masks may be inverted as well as copied between layers, which enables you to apply separate effects inside and outside of the mask area. In the example of the model, this means you can create one look or set of effects for the background and a completely different style for the model.\n\nOptics includes a number of stylized render elements that can be added to images, like the moon or lightning zaps. This also includes a ton of lens flare effects, thanks to the included Sapphire filters. In addition to the variety of presets, you can further customize the flares by launching the separate Lens Flare Designer, which is integrated into Optics.\n\nWorking with Optics\n\nOptics runs on Macs (macOS 10.13 or higher) and PCs (Windows 10 or higher) with fairly basic hardware requirements. I was able to test Optics on both an iMac Pro and my mid-2014 MacBook Pro. There was a minor license activation issue with the laptop, which was quickly sorted out by Boris FXâs customer service technician. Otherwise, the installations were very smooth. No hiccups with the iMac Pro. Optics responds well on less powerful computers; however, processing-intense effects as well as workflows with a stack of complex layers will perform better on a faster machine. For example, effects that were instantly responsive on the iMac Pro took a bit more time on the older MacBook Pro. If you are only photo developing/color correcting, then you probably wonât notice much difference.\n\nThe Optics Standalone application may also be used to process single stills without coming in through Photoshop. The new files can be left in their original size or optionally resized. You can save custom presets, which may be used for single images or to batch process a folder of stills. For example, if I wanted all my vacation stills to be processed with a certain Kodak film stock preset.\n\nBatch processing offers another interesting possibility. Optics will batch process any image sequence, whether from a camera (such as drones) or from a video file exported/rendered out of After Effects. As long as they are JPEG, TIFF, DPX, CIN, or camera raw files, you are good to go. This is a cool way to apply a custom look that you may not have access to as a video filter or plug-in effect, even though Optics is a still photography application.\n\nSelect âbatch processâ and load the image sequence. Then load a saved Optics setup that you have created. Batch processing will save these files as a new image sequence complete with the custom look applied. Finally, reconstruct the processed image sequence back into a video file using After Effects, Resolve, or any other application that supports image sequences.\n\nIf you work with a lot of stills and hate going through the gymnastics that Photoshop requires in order to create truly unique looks, then Boris FX Optics will be a game changer. Itâs very addictive, but more importantly, Optics offers a huge improvement in efficiency. Plus youâll have filter options at your fingertips not normally available in Photoshop alone. You might quickly find yourself doing all of your image processing strictly in Optics.\n\nAs with other Boris FX products, Optics is available as a perpetual license or subscription.
