It’s no surprise that most marketers have pivoted their visual content marketing strategy in 2023.\n\nThis year, more than 60% of marketers have revamped their visual content strategy. Many of them are jumping into the world of video, experimenting with trendy content styles on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.\n\nIn a world where attention spans are shorter than a sneeze, bite-sized content like TikTok videos and IG Reels grab and hold audience focus way better than long-form videos. In fact, with IG Reels, you could score a whopping 22% more engagement, as a result, getting more Instagram followers compared to your regular video posts..\n\nAside from that, marketers have also shared that they are focusing on mobile-first design to prioritize a seamless and enjoyable user experience on smaller screens.\n\n“With the majority of our audience accessing content via smartphones, we optimized all our visual content for mobile. This meant rethinking layouts, ensuring fast loading times and ensuring all visuals were clear and engaging on smaller screens.” — Anonymous respondent\n\n*2. Visual content continues to play an important part in content marketing strategies.\n\nApproximately 21.9% of marketers reported that over 75% of their content this year was all about visuals. Additionally, 34.3% disclosed that visual content made up at least 20-50% of their overall content marketing strategy.\n\nWith that, it’s crystal clear that visual content is a powerhouse in content marketing strategies across industries, proving to be 43% more persuasive than text alone. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to dive in and create more captivating visual content for 2024.\n\n*3. In 2023, data visualization charts take the lead as the most prevalent and widely used type of visual content.\n\nWe all know by now that data visualization content, especially charts and graphs, tends to capture and retain attention more effectively than lengthy textual descriptions.\n\nThat is because more than 65% of us are visual learners who are naturally drawn to visuals, and incorporating charts into your content can increase engagement levels.\n\nHence, a remarkable 52.22% of the 105 respondents declared that charts and data visualizations take the lead as their most frequently utilized type of visual content in 2023. Following closely are stock photos at 46.67%, with videos and presentations at 44.44% and original graphics at 42.22%.\n\nWhen aiming for B2B audiences, data visualization charts become your ultimate ally. In business and marketing, decisions are often data-driven. Charts provide a clear overview of information, supporting decision-makers in making informed choices based on the presented data.\n\nEven when you’re all about the business stuff, don’t overlook the importance of design. Stats have revealed that information with visuals like charts, graphs, photos and color design improves by a whopping 80%.\n\nBut don’t worry if you’re no designer, Venngage’s user-friendly interface makes designing eye-catching visuals a breeze. Simply browse through our collection of professionally designed templates and pick one that best suits your needs to get started!\n\n*4. Marketers found original graphics, like infographics and illustrations, to be the top performers while stock photos were considered less effective in the visual content scene.\n\nOriginal graphics like infographics and illustrations, stock photos and videos and presentations are among the top 3 best performing type of visual content. Well, no shocker here! Not since infographics are 30 times more likely to be read than a written article.\n\nResearch also found that, at the start of their buying journey, about 72% of B2B consumers prefer infographics. It just goes to show, they’re a solid asset for grabbing the attention of B2B audiences.\n\nIf you’re new to creating infographics, here’s an easy 5-step guide on how to create simple yet engaging infographics. Once you’re well briefed, browse through our collection of infographic templates and get started right away!\n\nWhile 34.29% of marketers considered stock photos to be their top-performing visual content, 39.05% reported that stock photos performed poorly for them.\n\nStock photos can sometimes miss that real, authentic vibe that people appreciate. Viewers might see them as a bit too generic or staged, which can weaken the connection between the content and the audience.\n\nBut here’s the scoop – even with these challenges, the deal with stock photos is that their effectiveness can swing in different directions. It all boils down to the context, industry and who you’re trying to reach.\n\nSome brands pull off using stock photos like rockstars. They just pick visuals that match their vibe, brand identity and the message they want to get across. Just remember, the success of these visual tricks depends on who you’re talking to, the vibe of your brand and what you’re aiming to achieve with your content game. Stay true to your style, and you’ll find the right balance.\n\n5. On average, marketers spend 10-15 hours each week producing content.\n\nAmong the marketers polled, 34.29% revealed that they spend an average of 10-15 hours a week producing content.\n\nSurprisingly, a substantial 20.95% of marketers invest more than 20 hours weekly in producing content. Excluding weekends, this would translate to an average of 4 hours per day dedicated to content production each week.\n\nGenerally speaking, different types of content would require varying amounts of time to produce. For example, producing a well-researched blog post or video may take more time than crafting a social media update or a quick graphic, but with the aid of an AI video generator, the process can be streamlined and made more efficient.\n\n6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as a game-changer for marketers in 2023.\n\nThere’s no denying that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed our lives in 2023. Hence, it’s not a big surprise to see about 61.54% of the 105 marketers we checked in with are using AI for their content game this year.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it’s safe to say that AI isn’t just a new hype and is here to stay for 2024 and beyond with 35% of companies using AI in their business.\n\nIf you’re thinking about stepping up your content strategy game with a little help from AI in 2024, here are some guides worth checking out:\n\nAI and Design in 2024: Cutting-Edge Trends to Watch\n\nHow Can AI Use Data to Predict Design Trends?\n\nBest AI Design & Art Generators You Need to Know [2024]\n\n*7. In-house designers aside, marketers create visual content with the help of online design software and online tools.\n\nWhile 50.48% of marketers get help from in-house designers when creating visual content, most marketers (51.43%) take it into their own hands to design visual content using advanced design software—such as Adobe’s suite of design tools.\n\nOn top of that, a solid 40% of marketers opt for the simplicity of online tools or graphic makers, like Venngage, to create visuals effortlessly.\n\nFor smaller businesses and teams who prefer to get their hands dirty, Venngage’s real-time collaboration tool is the solution for you.\n\nMade for teams on the go, real-time collaboration lets you fine-tune your design with your crew in the moment.
