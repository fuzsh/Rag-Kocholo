        "text": "The hero image trend in web design is still going strong. Don’t believe us? Just take a look at the top-half of this page.\n\nHow a website is designed directly influences how a user feels about the brand behind the site. Using a hero image on your site can help to establish trust among new visitors and even convert them into customers, by helping them buy in to your site’s concept. The same can be said for creating a persuasive prototype in your prototyping tool.\n\nSounds great. But what makes an awesome hero image website? That’s what you’re about to find out!\n\nToday Justinmind is going to show you how to make the most of large web banners, looking at 30 inspiring examples. So read on if you want to know the secrets to designing beautiful and persuasive hero image website prototypes.\n\nA hero image is a large or oversized web banner image that is pinned to the header section of a webpage, usually towards the top of the page. Because of its prominent place in the site’s visual hierarchy, the hero header is often the first thing users see when arriving on a website. Over the years, it’s become one of the most widely used and beloved UI patterns out there.\n\nAs Conversion Xl reminds us, it only takes 50 milliseconds for users to form an opinion about a website. That’s why you need to make sure that your site is easy to read, clear and delightful. Using a hero image is a good way to ensure users can identify with and relate to your site.\n\nLarge, oversized images grab the user’s attention as soon as they land on a page. They also help users identify the brand’s unique selling point (USP) and form an opinion about the brand as soon as the page loads. Many web designers create hero images using photos of real human faces. This helps designers to personify users, as well as enable users relate to the brand, according to Webflow.\n\nAnd in an attempt to create more personalized experiences for web users, some designers opt for animated hero images (using videos, sliders or carousels). This helps draw users in as soon as they arrive on the site’s homepage, and makes the experience feel more crafted. Here’s an example.\n\nWith all the benefits of hero image websites, it’s no wonder they have become such a popular web design trend. Next we’ll take a look our favorite hero image examples, including some interactive headers!\n\nWith all the benefits of hero image websites, it’s no wonder they have become such a popular web design trend. Next, we’ll take a look at our favorite hero image examples, including some interactive headers!\n\nBut first, let’s explore how you can create your own stunning hero images. A great hero image can supercharge your website’s user experience by grabbing attention and instantly conveying your message.\n\nHere’s some tips to create hero images that will stop visitors in their tracks.\n\nVideos are also powerful and can be even more interesting than pictures for your hero image. They can show a lot in a short time, even if your message is a bit tricky. Just make sure the video is clear and doesn’t make your website take too long to load. Videos that start playing automatically without sound and have words at the bottom are easiest for people to watch.\n\nThe carousel flicks automatically through four slides, each containing a full-width hero image and header text. The combination of large images, clear type and simple slide effects focuses your attention on the most important and current information about the foundation, without having to click anywhere. You can also flick through the information at your own pace too, using the left and right arrows on the sides of the carousel.\n\nCreating gradients involves the gradual blending or transitioning between colors, mimicking distance from or proximity to a light source. In big header design, it’s common to use super gradients, which transition between two or more colors (like in our example above).\n\nGradients allow web designers to make more colors available by creating more color tones. According to UX Planet, they help to make a bold statement, create a mood and channel user emotions, and make the on-screen elements they’re combined with more memorable. Perfect for hero image websites.\n\nUsing video is a great way to create dynamic headers that attract and keep users engaged. As Jason Beever from How To Get Online tells it: “Watching a simple moment in motion can create a tremendous impact on how users will perceive and engage with your brand.”\n\nIn fact, statistics shared by Forbes show that embedding a hero background video can help boost your conversion rates by 80% and influence a customer’s purchasing decision by 90%.\n\nOften, the hero header will contain a Call-to-Action (CTA). When this is the case, it’s important to have visual harmony between the hero image, the content and the CTA button.\n\nWhen content is placed on top of the hero image, designers usually adjust the contrast of the image. This is to ensure that the content is readable and the CTA button is located and used.\n\nAnyone who’s into their Instagram filters will love this tip: texture. Texture is the best way to give a flat photo some depth, warmth and feeling. If you intend for your hero image to take center stage or differentiate it from other elements on the page, texture is the way to go.\n\nTake a look at this example:\n\nThis one’s simple but effective: space. You can’t design your hero image without thinking about space. Space is what gives your design room to breathe, as well as create emphasis.\n\nTo make the content in your hero area stand out, set a margin on all sides of the canvas and center your content on top of the hero image. Just like that your visitors will automatically be drawn to the center of the hero, right where you want them to look. Told you it was simple!\n\nNike has been known to rely on a hero image in order to quickly create new campaigns, often tailored for that specific time such as encouraging people to register to vote. This gives the website a lot of flexibility, making Nike a store that is always interesting upon first glance. While there is no carousel, the hero image is often split into several combined images, like the example below.\n\nSea Streak is another hero image website that uses a video instead of a static image – and does it right. In this case, the video doesn’t have any sound and relies only on the visually impactful photography. The beauty of this hero image website is that the video is there to evoke emotion and to support the text that is in the top center.\n\nThis hero image website is a great example of a UI that gets to the point and brings users into the experience. In this case, we have a carousel-style display that can be adapted to any of the on-going exhibitions of the museum. When this post was being written, the exhibition in question was on Monet – with the signature use of color and texture making the page both functional and visually stunning.\n\nIn this example, Dropbox shows in its hero image how easy it is for teams to work together on stuff. The picture has a clean design with a document being edited and approved, and clear text that says Dropbox can store, share, and organize your files well. The bright blue button that says “Try it for free” is easy to see and lets people try out Dropbox themselves.\n\nWith Ahrefs’s hero image website you’ll be immediately struck by the bold, blue background and crisp typography. The hero image prominently shows the message, “Everything you need to rank higher & get more traffic,” making it clear what Ahrefs can do for you.\n\nThe design is simple yet effective, with a fun star icon and mountain graphic adding a bit of personality. The bright orange “Sign up for Ahrefs” button stands out, inviting users to take action.\n\nIncluding a hero header in your website can be a great way to focus the user’s attention as soon as they land on your website. Large and oversized web banners come to life on screen and can help your users make sense of your content.\n\nTo take advantage of this web design trend, it’s important to take hero design best practices into account. We hope these ten examples have you given you some insight into what a strong hero image design looks like.\n\nNow it’s time to create your own. We don’t mean to toot our own horn, but we think Justinmind is the best tool around for creating hero banners. If you haven’t tried us out, remember you can free here!"
