        "text": "In the wise words of Kim K, \"nobody wants to work anymore\"... except all the people surveyed in Adobe's Future Workforce Study! I'm not Gen Z but these stats really resonate with me - hungry for more but no time. The Focus Network is a small solution to that problem. You've got work you can \"complete\", but you know it can be better. Who do you take it to? Your boss says \"good enough!\", your peers have their own workloads to complete, and you don't always have friends who do the same thing you do. Join our online meetup (next week!) to swap what we're working on and get actionable, constructive feedback from up to 9 marketers... all in just 30 minutes. https://lu.ma/mehdeeka\n\nLast week was a first for me in two ways. It was my first time in Las Vegas, and my first time at Adobe Summit. We won't mention the Vegas part. I'm a shell of my former self. But Adobe Summit was phenomenal. Some highlights: üìª Giving a deliberately loose and digestible \"podcast-style\" presentation at WPPs booth alongside Christopher Rothstein on \"hard to attract, easy to lose.\" Seeing execs from Stripe, WPP, Adobe and way more in eye-line was... not nerve-racking at all üòê . I spent time emphasising that Stripe is not just payments -- it's customer experience with optimised check-out, SaaS-style subscriptions for every business and proper enterprise transformation. ü§ù An enormous amount of productive meetings with our established & new partners. Including DEPT¬Æ, VML, Ogilvy, Accenture & way more. Lots done, plenty more to get done together! ü§ñ Hearing about all of the martech advances with AI. It's not about randomly injecting an LLM into a blog post. It's much more about scaling your abilities to provide genuinely delightful customer experiences to people at scale without needing to over-spend your marketing or sales budgets.\n\nOn our life's journey, we are frequently presented with opportunities and obstacles that shape who we are and who we aspire to be. It is not only about reaching our destination but also about how we navigate the journey and uphold our values along the way. Adobe's four core principles have served me well in both my personal and professional endeavors: \"Create the future, Own the outcome, Raise the bar, and Be genuine.\" These values‚Äîcreating the future, owning the outcome, raising the bar, and being genuine‚Äîare not just words; they are guiding principles that can significantly impact our lives. They guide us toward success, fulfillment, and happiness. In my own journey, embodying these values has resulted in remarkable personal growth and professional accomplishments. They have assisted me in overcoming obstacles, seizing opportunities, and establishing lasting relationships. However, keep in mind that these values are not meant to be static; they change as we do. Embrace them, adapt them to your specific situation, and observe how they empower you to shape your future. Let us not forget that our actions today determine the future we are shaping tomorrow. Let's take responsibility for our decisions and the results they produce. Let's continuously raise the bar and pursue excellence in everything we do. And let us always be authentic, for it is in authenticity that we discover our true selves and develop deeper connections with others. #creatingthefuture #adobeaorall #values #adobevalues #authenticity #arofessionalgrowth #raisethebar #ownership #vikshu #adobelife #innovation\n\nFeeling so grateful and blessed, Last Thursday, I was invited by Microsoft Advertising and COOP to one of Microsoft's Headquarters in NYC for an open house event. It was definitely such an enlightening event. I want to thank all the amazing panelists that took time out of their day to share their journey and for providing us with valuable insights on how to be successful. I will be sharing some great takeaways that stood out to me: ‚ÄúGrowth and Comfort can not exist‚Äù. Sometimes we get too comfortable where we are, but still want to grow. However, if we don't make that change of being in uncomfortable scenarios or doing things we wouldn‚Äôt normally do. Growth within ourselves wouldn't be possible. You have to be willing to make that change and start asking questions in places we may not be comfortable in. Once you start feeling that change, you begin to realize that you are growing and your mindset starts changing. Remember you can be anywhere you want to be, it's all about the willingness to do to reach that goal. ‚ÄúYou need to go through that failure, failure is good \", sometimes we get so scared to fail and think it is only negative. However, failure is actually a good thing to happen because you start to grow and start realizing the change you need to make in order to try again. ‚ÄúWhen you fail you start to realize who you are‚Äù, this is the moment you begin to think and say what should I start doing differently to succeed next time. Failure also gives us the motivation to start working harder towards our dreams.‚ÄùRemember Tomorrow is another day‚Äù. ‚ÄúProcess and being accountable is what can get you somewhere‚Äù , it is important that in any project you may take to always have a vision and start planning ahead of time. Start acknowledging your responsibilities and take that action. To be successful it is important to have good discipline and begin by making the necessary changes to get where you want to be. Remember: ‚ÄúStay curious‚Äù ‚ÄúFollow the fear‚Äù ‚ÄúDo the work‚Äù ‚ÄúBe the change you want‚Äù ‚ÄúChange is constant‚Äù Thank you so much to COOP and Microsoft Advertising for making this event an unforgettable experience. #MSFTOHCOOP"
