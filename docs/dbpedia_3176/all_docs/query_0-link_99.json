Using the right format not only helps you achieve your target but also makes your brand memorable.\n\nPhoto ad format\n\nThe photo ad format enables businesses to design advertising content that combines an image with a call-to-action, a short description, and a title. Make sure your images are aligned with Meta’s official guide by keeping the text in pictures lower than 20% for better performance.\n\nThe image ads format enables businesses to design advertising content that combines an image with a call-to-action, a short description, and a title. It is worth noting that according to Meta’s official guide, you should keep the text in pictures lower than 20% in order to yield better performance.\n\nFacebook mentions that photo-only ads are superior in driving unique traffic. This format lets you create a quick photo ad directly from your Facebook Page by publishing and boosting a post with an image. They are ideal for making tangible products stand out and boost awareness.\n\nHere are some guidelines to consider:\n\nDesign specs:\n\nFile Type: JPG or PNG\n\nRatio: 1.91:1 to 1:1\n\nResolution: Minimum 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nText limits:\n\nPrimary Text: Up to 125 characters\n\nHeadline: Up to 27 characters\n\nDescription: Up to 27 characters\n\nTechnical details:\n\nMax File Size: 30 MB\n\nMin Width: 600 pixels\n\nMin Height: 600 pixels\n\nAspect Ratio Tolerance: 3%\n\nLooking for an example of Facebook Ads for gyms using photo format?\n\nHere’s an ad by Gym and Fitness showcasing the freeform ski trainer, which the brand informs users is in stock and available for purchase.\n\nThe second example, by Jordan Fitness, informs users that the brand is offering a 55% discount promotional campaign. The ad targets gym-goers who want to purchase their own equipment for at-home use.\n\nBoth ads feature the products that the companies are trying to highlight and provide a link to their respective product page. The simplicity and direct targeting are what make these kinds of gym ads successful. As you can see, the images do not contain any additional text.\n\nVideo ad format\n\nAccording to Statista, digital video advertising spending in the U.S. will increase to 78.5 billion. Why is such a massive capital dedicated to this ad format? Because they get watched!\n\nVideo ads boost brand visibility with short, engaging clips that prompt user action, like page likes or product purchases. This format is ideal for sharing your business story or customer journey.\n\nThese brief videos, whether showcasing products or testimonials, convey your brand’s essence.

BodyBoss Portable Gym 2.0 teaches its users how to correctly use this particular piece of equipment, the muscle group it targets, and how they can purchase it. To top that up, they have included a special 30% discount.\n\nLife Fitness used video ads to promote their English and Spanish Studio Coach workouts available within their app. Additionally, they have enlisted the benefits of these to users and a free two-week trial for those who do not already have the app installed.\n\nThese gym ads examples show how to deliver a point to audiences in an articulated and brief manner. Both offer a balanced text-video combination that makes the viewer consider using your products and services.\n\nCarousel ad format\n\nCarousel ads feature multiple images or videos in a scrollable format, each with a call-to-action. You can seamlessly blend various sales objectives, starting with awareness, showcasing products, and concluding with a compelling final pitch.\n\nThese ads are best for presenting multiple products or packages. Businesses like fitness centers use carousels to granularly highlight their offerings.\n\nAs the guideline suggests, these ads should have:\n\nCarousel specs:\n\nImage Types: JPG or PNG\n\nVideo Types: MP4, MOV, or GIF\n\nRatio: 1:1\n\nResolution: Minimum 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nText limits:\n\nPrimary Text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 32 characters\n\nDescription: 18 characters\n\nLanding Page URL: Required\n\nTechnical details:\n\nCards: 2 to 10\n\nImage Max Size: 30 MB\n\nVideo Max Size: 4 GB\n\nVideo Duration: 1 sec to 240 min\n\nAspect Ratio Tolerance: 3%\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some examples of Facebook gym ads using carousel format. Jordan Fitness uses this format to highlight multiple pieces of equipment included in their 50% discount promotion.\n\nIn the next example, Titan Fitness showcases its vertical leg press by including a more in-depth view of each component of the equipment.\n\nThese types of gym ads provide several compelling options to the viewer and engage them with interactive features. They combine the product listing with a video description, giving viewers a chance to study the products in more detail.\n\nStories ad format\n\nStories ad format is a dynamic way to connect to your audience. Authentic and engaging stories develop closer connections while being inclusive. About 57% of viewers have said that the Facebook Stories make them feel part of a broader community.\n\nThis format is also more compatible with phone interactions. Mostly because they’re designed for a natural, vertical, full-screen view.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, you should format your stories as shown below:\n\nDesign recommendations:\n\nFile Types: MP4, MOV, or GIF\n\nRatio: 9:16\n\nSettings: H.264 compression, 1080 x 1080 pixels, optional captions, optional sound\n\nFree Space: Keep 14% (top) and 20% (bottom) clear to avoid UI overlap.\n\nText limits:\n\nPrimary Text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 40 characters\n\nTechnical details:\n\nDuration: 1 sec to 2 min\n\nMax File Size: 4 GB\n\nMin Width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect Ratio Tolerance: 1%\n\nHere’s an example of a fitness ad using the Story format. Kerim Workouts has created a brief video to showcase a routine with flair—add movement and sound for a quick attention grabber.\n\nThis ad highlights a unique workout routine that also narrates the brand story creatively. All while providing value to the audience through instructions.\n\nMessenger ad format\n\nMessenger ads let you reach more people right in their Messenger app inbox. While taking advantage of Messenger’s global reach of 1.3 billion monthly users, it lets you use the same creative approach available on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWhen users tap on your ad in the Chats tab, they get sent to a detailed view in Messenger. Then, they can easily connect with your business or head to your site or app.\n\nThere are two Messenger ad options:\n\n1. Ads in Messenger Inbox that appear between conversations. Clicking on these ads directs users to a detailed view with a CTA button.\n\nDelivery: They are automated for optimal campaign results.\n\nTargeting: It lets you leverage user profiles, Pages, groups, and connections on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNote: This option is currently unavailable in the US, Canada, Australia, and France.\n\n2. Ads in Messenger Stories: These ads appear between organic stories. They are designed to boost your Instagram and Facebook Stories campaigns.\n\nWhen it comes to recommended guidelines, you’ll need to follow specs and technical instructions for photo ads, video ads, or carousel ads. This depends on the creatives you select for your messenger ads.\n\nHere’s a hypothetical example of a messenger ad for gyms, offering a workout routine.\n\nUsing automation, the ad targets users who want a personalized workout routine. The interactive communication makes the ad engaging and practical to its audiences.\n\nSlideshow ad format\n\nSlideshow ads offer a cost-effective way to create impact with captivating visuals and narratives. They work like video ads, while they are made of a series of photos. However, you can seamlessly integrate motion, sound, and text to tell compelling stories across various devices.\n\nCompared to video ads, they have swifter loading times, even on slower connection speeds. You can also use stock footage and music to create the slideshows in no time.\n\nThat’s why Slideshow ads are an ideal choice for those wanting to offer immersive experiences without spending much on traditional videos.\n\nYou can use 2-15 images for your slideshow. However, the selected images need to be in any of the supported formats given in Meta’s guidelines here and follow the rest of the instructions for photo ad format.\n\nCheck out this Facebook gym ad in Slideshow format!\n\nIt features moving, animated images, creating a dynamic experience that successfully conveys a sense of the session itself. With faster loading times than video, it tells a compelling story to its audience while keeping them engaged.\n\nCollection ad format\n\nThe Collection ads are designed for a single purpose: to simplify the journey from product discovery to purchase. They are especially suitable for mobile users who often initiate product exploration through videos.\n\nThis format integrates a primary video or image with three smaller accompanying images in a grid-like layout. When users tap on the ad, they seamlessly transition to a fast-loading visual experience powered by Instant Experience, all within the Facebook or Instagram environment.\n\nThe Collection format provides different templates that you can choose based on your specific marketing goals. For instance, the Instant Storefront template is ideal for showcasing a catalog of products in a grid, while the Instant Lookbook template is suitable for demonstrating products in action.\n\nHere are the guidelines to follow when creating a collection ad:\n\nCollection ad specs:\n\nCover: Uses first media from Instant Experience.\n\nImage/Video: JPG, PNG, MP4, MOV, or GIF; 1:1 ratio; 1080 x 1080 pixels.\n\nText: Primary 125 characters, headline 40 characters, required landing page URL.\n\nTech: Instant Experience required, image max 30 MB, video max 4 GB.\n\nPlayable ad format\n\nPlayable ads are essentially interactive video ads that provide a try-before-you-buy experience. This means your users can preview the app’s features through a lead-in video in News Feed or Stories.\n\nProspective users test-drive the app directly from the ad, while advertisers discover engaged players or customers with higher intent. They could be a lead-in video, an interactive game demo, and a call to action for app installation. Either way, playable ads serve as a digital test drive for apps.\n\nHere are the specifications for playable ads:\n\nHTML5 Assets:\n\nHTML format, <2MB, no mraid.js, no HTTP requests, portrait mode, responsive design.\n\nSingle file, data URI compressed, use FbPlayableAd.onCTAClick() for call to action.\n\nNo JavaScript redirects, no dynamic external asset loading.\n\nCombine into one file: encode the image into base64 string, integrate js into index.html.\n\nZip Files:\n\nSupported on iOS and Android, <5MB, <100 files.\n\nZip archive with index.html at the root.\n\nLead-in Video:\n\nAll aspect ratios supported (Landscape, Square, Vertical).\n\nRequired for playable ads, delivered in News Feed only, not on Audience Network placements.\n\nLead ads & creative formats\n\nLead ads across Meta technologies (Facebook & Instagram) can appear in Facebook Feed and Stories, Instagram Feed and Stories, Instant Articles, in-stream videos, Marketplace and anywhere else Meta ads can be.\n\nA lead ad is made two units: a creative ad unit (image or video) and an instant form. They are designed to allow users to seamlessly generate new leads by creating a shortcut in the subscription process.\n\nAs a result, your audience can submit pre-filled forms that are populated with their information, which is derived from their Facebook profile.\n\nThis also means people don’t have to manually fill out each entry form. Users only need to provide specific details, streamlining the submission process for effective lead generation.\n\nTo create high-quality leads in a short amount of time, you’ll need to get help from automation. After integrating lead ads with your CRMs, you can automatically sync data between your Facebook and your database.\n\nCheck out the different integrations for Meta lead ads:\n\nHere are the creative specifications for designing an optimized lead ad:\n\nImages: JPG or PNG, 1,080 x 1,080 pixels, 1:1 ratio, Text: 125 characters, Headline: 40 characters, Description: 30 characters.\n\nVideos: MP4 or MOV, up to 15 seconds, 4:5 ratio, H.264 compression, Text: 125 characters, Headline: 40 characters. The optimal video length is 15 seconds, but can be up to 240 minutes (shorter is often better).\n\nFacebook gym ads: Advertising fitness classes\n\nLet’s review some lead ads across Meta technologies in action.\n\nOur first example is from a campaign by Fisique Boston. This health & fitness club wanted to grow the number of its membership subscriptions. Using LeadsBridge CRM integrations paired with Facebook lead ads and custom audiences, they generated an ROI of 21x on a total investment of $265.\n\n“The results were extraordinary, and now we’re splitting into more campaigns.”\n\nEugene Mann – Founder of PPL Labs\n\nDiscover more statistics and information about Fisique Boston’s campaign here.\n\nAnother example is by Inishowen Gateway Hotel Gym. They published their entire schedule using the single image format.\n\nSimilarly, Fisique uses the single image format. Instead, it uses a sign-up form attached, to advertise a six-week transformation available to 25 women.\n\nOur last example is by Elevate Fitness & Performance. It uses a carousel format to advertise its 90-day nutrition program, including a call to action to send the brand a message to discover more information.\n\nAs you can see in these ads, the carousel format, and single image format are equally effective when used properly. Once clicked, the links attached to these gym ads redirect the user to the lead ads option, which helps them to move more leads and customers down the funnel.\n\nWant to get the most out of your ad campaigns?

They combine copy with elements like images and headlines that have been carefully crafted.\n\nIt’s important that they avoid being misleading or making false claims. For instance, an ad promoting body confidence exemplifies positive health and fitness advertising without resorting to falsehoods.\n\nTake a look at how Lane Bryant achieved this:\n\nHere’s another example of health and fitness advertisements that positively impact the end-receiver.\n\nBlink Fitness redefines fitness ads by promoting an inclusive and achievable approach, focusing on feeling good rather than physical appearance with their “Mood Above Muscle” campaign.\n\nIn 2016, they invited Instagram followers to share confidence stories for a chance to be part of the campaign. From 2,000 submissions, 50 semi-finalists were auditioned by a celebrity panel.\n\nThen, they selected 16 individuals representing diverse shapes, sizes, and fitness abilities. This initiative goes beyond typical fitness ads, taking a stand against unrealistic body standards and advocating the belief that “The best body is your body.”\n\nA negative example of health and fitness advertisements\n\nIt’s common that in health and fitness, negative ads, especially for weight loss, brands often promise unrealistic results. Some companies resort to misleading tactics in their fitness ads to pressure people into joining their clubs.\n\nHere is an example of a negative fitness advertisement from Reebok’s Easytone shoes. The company created a series of ads for the Easytone and RunTone shoes in 2009 and 2010, claiming that Tone shoes could work the hamstrings and calves muscles to become up to 11% harder and tone your butt up to 28% more than regular sneakers.\n\nWhile the shoes forced you to use more muscles when you moved, the FTC investigation found that the EasyTone shoes make walking uncomfortable. So, Reebok had to refund over $25 million in purchases.\n\nYou can find one of their ads below.\n\nAnother negative example of health and fitness advertisements. VitaminWater marketed its product as a healthy alternative to soda, while the drink was actually made with large amounts of sugar.\n\nThe marketing tagline was “vitamins + water = all you need”, which relied on inaccurate messaging. It hides the fact that each bottle contained an unhealthy dose of eight teaspoons of sugar.\n\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest investigated the product and discovered the company’s false claim, as is the case with other negative fitness advertisements. VitaminWater was requested to add “with sweeteners” to its labelling.\n\nThe above examples should provide enough insights and what negative fitness advertisements look like and what to avoid.\n\nThe workout ad\n\nTake a look at the workout ad above by BodyBoss Method. This marketing tips for gym shows that people have a good time if they join this brand’s fitness classes. The copy is transparent in conveying the message, and the call to action prompts the viewers to interact with the advertisement.\n\nLooking for more Meta Ad examples?
