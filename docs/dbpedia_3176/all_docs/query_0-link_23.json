        "text": "Modeling what makes an advertisement persuasive, i.e., eliciting the desired response from consumer, is critical to the study of propaganda, social psychology, and marketing. Despite its importance, computational modeling of persuasion in computer vision is still in its infancy, primarily due to the lack of benchmark datasets that can provide persuasion-strategy labels associated with ads. Motivated by persuasion literature in social psychology and marketing, we introduce an extensive vocabulary of persuasion strategies and build the first ad image corpus annotated with persuasion strategies. We then formulate the task of persuasion strategy prediction with multi-modal learning, where we design a multi-task attention fusion model that can leverage other ad-understanding tasks to predict persuasion strategies. Further, we conduct a real-world case study on 1600 advertising campaigns of 30 Fortune-500 companies where we use our model’s predictions to analyze which strategies work with different demographics (age and gender). The dataset also provides image segmentation masks, which labels persuasion strategies in the corresponding ad images on the test split. We publicly release our code and dataset.\n\nExplore Dataset\n\nDistribution of Persuasion Strategies\n\nSample Segmented Images\n\nPitt Ads Dataset\n\nPitt ads dataset contains an image dataset of 64,832 image ads, and a video dataset of 3,477 ads. This data contains annotations encompassing the topic and sentiment of the ads, questions and answers describing what actions the viewer is prompted to take and the reasoning that the ad presents to persuade the viewer. The Pitt Ads dataset can be donwloaded from here.\n\nGet the Dataset\n\nImages\n\nTrain Image Annotations\n\nTest Image Annotations\n\nExplore the Dataset with Category Wise Examples\n\nSegmentation Masks\n\nModel\n\nRead the Paper\n\nDataset Statistics\n\nPersuasive Strategies No. of Class Sample Definition Anchoring and comparison 48 A product’s value is strongly influenced by what\n\nit is compared to.

This happens due to psychological reactance of losing\n\nfreedom of choice when things are less available or they use\n\navailability as a cognitive shortcut for gauging quality.
