Never heard of that program... but you might look to see if that program has a forum

How to Select a Forum http://forums.adobe.com/docs/DOC-1015

Persuasion is ancient history. I dumped my CD years ago. You are unlikle to find anyone to help you here. Especially since there is no forum here for users of ancient unsupported software.

I had a look at the Adobe FTP site (ftp://ftp.adobe.com) but unfortunately didn't see it there. I had thought it might be in the pub subfolder somewhere. But look around, maybe I missed it.

Thanks so much. It is very old...end of the 90s! Adobe itself is no help, apparently has no archives, told me to use the forum.

Sigh...
