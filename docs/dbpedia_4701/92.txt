William Hewat 1800 Merton - 1874 Dublin

William Hewat (1800-1870) was Australian John Hewat's father. William's own father Andrew (1750-1811), finding himself on the wrong side of the American Revolution in South Carolina had returned to Scotland from Nova Scotia in the late 1780s, where he'd fled, along with many other Loyalists, when the war was lost; he spent the remainder of his life in the parish of Merton, Berwickshire. Andrew's son William, who married Sarah Duxbury, went to Dublin in 1838 to work in the Irish Provincial Bank, with cousin Thomas Hewat.

The following commentary on William's other children, siblings of eldest son John, was provided by Victoria Dunlop, ggg.grandaughter of William. Dianne Kelly was responsible for providing much of the original material and most importantly for putting Victoria in touch with the custodian of the letters (a descendant of William's son Thomas Duxbury Hewat).
