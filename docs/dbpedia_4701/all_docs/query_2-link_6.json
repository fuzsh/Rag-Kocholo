        "text": "May his soul rest in peace\n\nDr. W. Hew Mcleod or Professor William Hewat McLeod (2 August 1932 - 20 July 2009), was a prolific and highly controversial scholar, professor and author of Sikh studies who was born in New Zealand. The son of a sheep-farmer and belonging to the Presbyterian church, he had come to Punjab, the north Indian border province that has a Sikh majority population, as a Christian missionary in 1958. He then settled down in Batala town, 40 km from Amritsar; while living away from home, Mcleod found his interest in Christianity waning and Sikh history a growing interest.\n\nMcleod played a major role in establishing and popularising the academic study of Sikhism outside India. He leaves behind a body of work on Sikhism which will be a source of reference for the coming generations of Sikh and scholars of Sikhism. Much of his work was also found un factual and incorrect, but unfortunately many of his followers continue to use his work without providing reference to those who academically responded to him.\n\nHis work on Sikhi may continue to be controversial, and it created a wider debate among Sikhs and students of this religion. McLeod was unable to respond to those who debated with him and brushed them off with a few words and zingers. That has certainly helped bring the history and concepts of Sikhism to the attention of many people who would not have had access to these ideas, though the access he provided gave the wrong impression on the Sikh people to his audiences. He was a pioneering and extraordinary scholar combining passion and humility in his approach to Sikh history in a way rarely seen amongst academics. Many academics continue to do groundbreaking work to portray the correct and factual version of a faith, which was misrepresented by others.\n\nEarly life\n\nHew, as he was known, was born on 2 August 1932 and raised in a farming family near Fielding, in New Zealand's North Island. He completed his schooling at Nelson college before attending the University of Otago, Dunedin, where he undertook a BA and then an MA in history. He also met Margaret Wylie there, and in May 1955 they got married.\n\nHe then began theological studies and in 1958, with his wife and son, Rory, joined the New Zealand Presbyterian church's mission to Punjab. At Kharar, in Punjab, he learned Hindi and Punjabi as well as teaching English at the Christian Boys secondary school. He found that his lack of training as a language teacher and his New Zealand accent made this task difficult.\n\nInterest in Sikhs\n\nHew escaped these concerns by immersing himself in studying the Punjab, especially the Sikhs, a community that quickly captured his imagination. This new interest was developed further when the family, which by then included sons Michael and Shaun, spent an extended period in England, where Hew studied for a PhD at the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1965. While in London, Hew and Margaret adopted a half-Punjabi baby girl, Ruth. When the family returned to Punjab, Hew took a job teaching history at Baring Union Christian college at Batala.\n\nHew McLeod taught in Punjab for nine years and there developed a life-long interest in the Sikhs. In 1971 he returned to the History Department of the University of Otago in Dunedin, where he remained until his retirement in 1998. His first book was \"Guru Nanak and the Sikh Religion\", published in 1968. Since then he has produced another fifteen books on Sikh history and religion. These include critical studies, translations, and a dictionary\n\nWrote many books connected with Sikh & Punjab Studies\n\nMcleod wrote several books, including \"Guru Nanak and Sikh Religion\" (translated into Punjabi by Amritsar's Guru Nanak Dev University), \"The Evolution of Sikh Community\", \"The Sikhs - History, Religion and Society\", \"Sikhs of the Khalsa\" and many others. He did his PhD on Sikh history from the University of London.\n\n1955: MA University of New Zealand\n\n1965: PhD University of London\n\n1990: DLit University of London\n\n1999: FRSNZ\n\nDescribed by many as an \"unsung success story\" who acquired \"global repute\" with his work as a historian, Mcleod left New Zealand in 1958 to work as a missionary in northern Punjab. He taught Punjab history at Baring College in Batala town before his interest as a missionary started to fade. Unimpressed with the existing studies at that time on the Sikh Gurus, Mcleod got immersed in Sikh history and religion and even Punjabi, a language he learnt to speak with ease. He lost all interest and contact with the church as he pursued Sikh history.\n\nCriticism\n\nSome of his books and research came in for criticism from Sikh scholars but there were many who admired his tireless work on Sikhism.\n\nW.H. Mcleod, the man from faraway New Zealand who came to Punjab in the 1950s as a Christian missionary but ended up being a globally-reputed historian on Sikhs has passed away. He was dedicated over four decades of his life in researching Sikh history, died in Dunedin on Monday night.\n\nHew McLeod came to Punjab half a century earlier as a missionary. His mission was to convert people to Christianity. Last Monday, when he died, had he not proclaimed himself largely an agnostic, many would have rushed to dub him almost a Sehajdhari Sikh.\n\nMuch did McLeod for Sikhism, and much gave Sikhism to McLeod. His life time’s work was the study of the Sikhs, and McLeod opened the window of the world to Sikhism. He lived a rich life, full of pursuit of truth, his fair share of controversies, an impressive body of writing and a commitment to the cause he found that lasted a lifetime.\n\nImportant name in the field of Sikh Studies\n\nTo say that McLeod was an important name in Sikhism’s scholarship will be an understatement. As I.J. Singh wrote in a brilliant piece meant as a tribute to McLeod, he was “gentleman and a scholar” who was an “ex-missionary … not left untouched by the richness of Sikh teaching and faith” but most importantly “who has done more to introduce Sikhism to the world outside India than anyone else.”\n\nThat there was immense criticism of his work is a measure of the man as a scholar, and the special articles that this edition carries on inside pages about him reflect a diversity of opinion about McLeod’s approach and methodology.\n\nOften, McLeod’s interpretations ran contrary to more accepted and acceptable interpretations of Prof Sahib Singh or even Macauliffe and never really answered the charge of misinterpreting Gurbani but wanted his readers to judge him for that.\n\nTraditionalist or factual writer?\n\nThere are many who will find his tagging of the Institute of Sikh Studies as ‘traditionalist’ and many scholars’ work as ‘conservative’, problematic, but we must remember that while all historians may honestly try (Few do, of course), complete objectivity may be an ideal that may still not be within grasp. Further proof that historians are humans, too.\n\nWe have heard suggestions that McLeod’s approach was historical and the others’ based on belief. This is somewhat specious. There is an argument that having being taught in western tradition, McLeod’s way was to cast all aside and only accept what was backed by facts.\n\nThis is tantamount to saying that all who preceded him or differed were guilty of having wrong facts. A historian’s truth is often relative, just like everyone’s else. Thankfully, in his autobiography, McLeod concedes that his work has all the limitations that the Western historical methods impose.\n\nDeath\n\nW. Hew McLeod died at 11.00 pm, Monday, July 20, 2009 (New Zealand time) in Dunedin, New Zealand, after a lengthy illness. He was 77. The World Sikh News mourns his death and also holds that the best way to pay tribute to a scholar who has lived a life so extraordinarily rich is to try and re-engage with his work.\n\nIt is a sign of the times that in Punjab, virtually no newspaper carried even the news of the death of Hew McLeod even on Wednesday, except a local edition of the Hindustan Times. In the dumbed down times, McLeod’s work and its criticism assume all the more importance.\n\nBooks by McLeod\n\nGuru Nanak and the Sikh Religion. Oxford: the Clarendon Press (1968).

McLeod: A Pioneer in Sikh Studies\n\nKushwant singh stated him pioneer of sikh studies Khushwant Singh fails to appreciate that the true measure of the Singh Sabha movement's success at distilling the Sikh rahit tradition will continue to escape us unless we gain access to tools that allow us to contrast the current rahit with its flawed predecessors. McLeod's book Sikhs of the Khalsa: A History of the Khalsa Rahit is one such essential tool. It is critical that the blemishes present in the current edition of the Sikh Rahit Maryada be viewed not in isolation but in context with earlier textual versions of the rahit. However, the intellectual lethargy Khushwant displays here is not new. Other notable instances include blatant support (until much after it's conclusion) for Indira Gandhi's fascist Emergency rule (1975-1977) and the failure to denounce (again, until well after its conclusion; Jun. 20, 2003) state-sponsored terrorism in the Punjab (1984-1995).\n\nI.J. Singh, an academic said \"He became an international authority on the religion, perhaps the best known outside Punjab and India, and the man who has done more to introduce Sikhism to the world outside India than anyone else,\" said . \"It is because of a few writers, and Hew McLeod above all, that the world has any inkling of Sikhism as an independent religion, with a unique, universal and timeless world view. He brought Sikhism to Western academia,\" Singh wrote Tuesday on an international website on Sikhs.\n\n\"It (his death) is a huge loss to the Sikh community. He always added a fresh perspective to the development and history of the Sikhs as opposed to the traditional view of romanticising it overly,\" said Punjab-based author of the book \"Sikhs Unlimited\" Khushwant Singh.\n\nIt will be fair to conclude that McLeod’s work helped the western world in trying to understand Sikhism in terms that the west was familiar with, while the Sikhs already knew only too well what to believe. Their notion of religion flows from Guru Nanak Dev ji to Guru Gobind Singh ji and from Sri Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nResponses to McLeod by Sikh Scholars\n\nMany scholars, historians, theologians, intellects, etc. have academically responded to the misinterpretations and nonfactual writings of McLeod.\n\nHere are some books and writings in general by various accomplished intellects that respond to McLeod:\n\nReadings:\n\nErnest Trumpp and McLeod as Scholars of Sikh History Religion and Culture by Dr. Trilochan Singh\n\nPerspectives on The Sikh Tradition - Response by Various Scholars\n\nAuthenticity of the Kartarpuri Bir by Daljeet Singh\n\nA Review by Late Daljeet Singh of W H McLeod’s “Evolution of The Sikh Community”\n\nReview of W H McLeod’s “The Sikhs – History, Religion and Society”\n\nWho is a Sikh?

A large part of Sikh community is settled abroad. These Sikhs form a strong Diaspora which is an invaluable asset of the Sikh community. In order to promote better understanding of Sikhism, the Sikh Diaspora of North America has done commendable job to establish Sikh Studies Chairs in a few Canadian and American universities.\n\nUnfortunately the professors appointed on these Chairs instead of studying Sikh history, religion and literature in an objective and impartial manner have taken interest to propagate and establish a particular school of thought which is highly prejudiced against the established facts of Sikh history and religion. This school founded and patronized by W.H. McLeod and carried on by his flag carriers is hell bent to distort the Sikh history and religion. One of these Chairs is also functioning at the University of California, Santa Barbara in California. The professor, Gurinder Singh Mann, appointed on this Chair is also not performing according to the expectations and aspirations of the Sikh community.\n\nFor example, his remarks that the text of Sri Guru Granth Sahib is still going under evolution is totally uncalled for. He does not fully subscribe to the revelatory character of Gurbani. His reluctance to accept that the final canonization of Guru Granth Sahib occurred at the hands of Guru Gobind Singh at Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Saboo, Bathinda in 1706 and Guru Gobind Singh had conferred Guruship on Guru Granth Sahib at Nanded in 1708 are very unfortunate.\n\nSimilarly his observation that initial five weapons were a part of the Khalsa rehit is established by Guru Gobind Singh and five kakkars were not in vogue is totally unfounded and historically incorrect. He does not accept Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Tegh Bahadur as martyrs but puts them as if they were criminals who suffered executions at the hands of the Mughals. In his recent book he has recommended “suggested further reading” of a book which alleges that the birth of Guru Hargobind was the outcome of niyoga between Baba Buddha and Mata Ganga, wife of Guru Arjan. All these writings by this professor are highly condemnable. I strongly urge the Sikh sangat all over the world that they remain beware of above type of scholars and take appropriate academic measures to counter their activities.\n\n(signed)\n\nJoginder Singh Jathedar\n\nSri Akal takhat Sahib\n\nAmritsar\n\nTel./Fax: 91-183-2540820\n\nObituary WH McLeod\n\nNew Zealand scholar and an authority on the history of Sikhism by Tony Ballantyne, The Guardian, Thursday 3 September 2009\n\nThough McLeod went to Punjab on a Presbyterian church mission, he lost his own belief in God\n\nWilliam Hewat McLeod, who has died aged 76, was a scholar whose life's work helped transform the understanding of Sikhism. He produced a remarkable series of publications and was central in establishing Sikh studies as a distinctive field. Although his own work was careful, measured and judicious, it frequently provoked controversy.\n\nHew, as he was known, was born and raised in a farming family near Fielding, in New Zealand's North Island. He completed his schooling at Nelson college before attending the University of Otago, Dunedin, where he undertook a BA and then an MA in history. He also met Margaret Wylie there, and in May 1955 they got married.\n\nHew then began theological studies and in 1958, with his wife and son, Rory, joined the New Zealand Presbyterian church's mission to Punjab. At Kharar, in Punjab, he learned Hindi and Punjabi as well as teaching English at the Christian Boys secondary school. He found that his lack of training as a language teacher and his New Zealand accent made this task difficult.\n\nHew escaped these concerns by immersing himself in studying the Punjab, especially the Sikhs, a community that quickly captured his imagination. This new interest was developed further when the family, which by then included sons Michael and Shaun, spent an extended period in England, where Hew studied for a PhD at the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1965. While in London, Hew and Margaret adopted a half-Punjabi baby girl, Ruth.\n\nThe family returned to Punjab, where Hew took a job teaching history at Baring Union Christian college at Batala. They left India in 1969 after both Hew and Margaret realised the extent of their religious doubts. Hew recognised that he did not, in fact, believe in God. Many Sikh critics have persisted in dubbing him the Rev McLeod, failing to recognise that he severed his formal ties with the Presbyterian church 40 years ago and the ways in which his agnosticism shaped his approach to Sikh religion and history.\n\nHew's revised thesis was published by the Clarendon Press as Guru Nanak and the Sikh Religion (1968). This book assessed the historical value of the janam sakhis, popular narratives that recounted the life of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, and embodied the highest standards of philological analysis and the evaluation of sources. This approach angered some Sikhs because they saw it as a direct challenge to the authenticity of their traditions.\n\nAfter 18 months in England on fellowships at Cambridge and Sussex universities, Hew and his family returned to New Zealand. He became a professor of history at the University of Otago, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. He continued to produce books, including The Evolution of the Sikh Community (1975) and Early Sikh Tradition (1980), and completed a pioneering study of the history of Punjabi migration to New Zealand.\n\nConferences and sabbaticals allowed Hew to travel widely in the late 1970s and 80s. In 1987, during one of these trips, he suffered a stroke. This would later impede his ability to lecture and argue ex tempore, though he continued to write, opening up new aspects of Sikhism to scholarly assessment, from popular art through to women in Sikh tradition. He produced an indispensable Historical Dictionary of Sikhism (1995) and edited Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism (1990), as well as publishing several surveys of the religion. For five years from 1988, he taught for one term annually at the University of Toronto, where he supervised PhDs by Louis Fenech and Pashaura Singh, leading figures in the field today.\n\nHew was renowned for his openness and his readiness to answer any question and to read any manuscript. This generosity, together with his precocious embrace of email, placed him at the centre of an international scholarly community.\n\nHe is survived by Margaret, his four children and four grandchildren.\n\n• William Hewat (\"Hew\") McLeod, historian, born 2 August 1932; died 20 July 2009\n\nResponse to Some Misstatements About Hew McLeod\n\nResponse to Some Misstatements About Hew McLeod from Sikh Center\n\n[The following response, to some of the statements made about Dr McLeod in tributes paid to him after his death, has been made using Dr McLeod's own methodology of a \"skeptic\" — that we believe the statements in question are hagiographical in nature rather than objective. I am sure those who worship Dr McLeod would not begrudge us this step — as we believe using his own methodology to dissect his own life's account may be the biggest tribute to him. If what we write does not read like a tribute and makes you angry, please do keep in mind that all the arguments applied to those Sikhs who felt angered by Dr McLeod's methodology and the statements stemming from it, are applicable to you too. Peace & love — Sikh Centre.]\n\n3.\n\nEDITOR: World renowned Sikh historian, W. Hew McLeod, passed away peacefully at 11.00 pm, Monday, July 20, 2009 – (New Zealand time) – in Dunedin, New Zealand, after a lengthy illness.\n\nAgain there is a problem with the usage of term “Sikh historian”. One fails to find an equivalent usage w.r.t. Christianity or Islam or Judaism. What one does find is “a Jewish historian of Christianity” or “a Biblical scholar” or “a scholar of Sharia Law”. To take another example, has anyone ever described, say, Max Muller (or Mueller) as a “Hindu historian”? As stated earlier, at best Dr McLeod may be described as “Janamsakhi historian”. For reasons listed at number (2) he cannot be described as an “authority on Sikhism” – however, looking at the focus of his work, he may be described as an “authority on Sikh schismatic literature” (which also includes Janamsakhis, as neither Puratan Janamsakhi nor Bhai Bala Janamsakhi was written by a Sikh). Then again, an “authority” needs to understand the historical significance of the subject matter being studied – Dr McLeod, unfortunately, spent a lifetime creating misunderstanding about his subject matter of Sikh schismatic literature (like Chaupa Singh Rehatnama, Janamsakhis, etc.) by not enlightening his readers (and, more seriously, his students) about the context in which the literature he was citing to support his arguments, was written.\n\n4.\n\nWe join Sikhs around the globe in mourning his passing, and in celebrating an extraordinary life, rich in scholarship and wisdom and lived to the highest ideals of Sikhi.\n\nPray, what is the highest ideal of Sikhi? I thought it was honesty and integrity.\n\n5.\n\nOur deepest condolences to Margaret, his wife of 54 years, and his loving family.\n\nOur deepest condolences to Margaret (I have met her twice in Dunedin and found her charming) and Dr McLeod’s children.\n\n6.\n\nWe are grateful for the blessings he brought to Sikhdom and pray for his eternal peace.\n\nI doubt the writer (listed as “Editor”) can cite these blessings. At the risk of violating a social convention of “not speaking ill of the dead” by all yardsticks Dr McLeod cannot be put in the same category as, say, Dr Noel Q King when it comes to the “blessings to Sikhdom”.\n\n7. What are the defining landmarks of a well-lived life?\n\nTo me, a minimal but universal definition, devoid of any religious overtones, would be a purpose-driven existence that transcends the self, a cause greater than the person, along with transparent honesty of effort in its pursuit.\n\nTo the short list of those that I have met and dealt with that I believe fill that bill, I would add without an iota of reservation another – Hew McLeod.\n\nHere starts Dr I J Singh’s eulogy to Dr McLeod. Unfortunately, he stumbles at the very first step. If we accept his definition of a “well-lived life” then Hitler and Stalin had lived their lives pretty well. They were purpose-driven, and thought they were fighting for the greater good of their respective countries and were completely honest about what they sought to achieve – Hitler wanted Aryan supremacy while Stalin wanted to rid the world of bourgeoisie. Both sought absolute power and did not want any opposition to rise against them. Anyone who opposed their view was killed, or if that was not possible, derided as not worth answering to. Thus, one finds it hard to find an essay (or a statement) from Stalin or Hitler wherein they engage in debate on any aspect of their respective worldview.\n\n8.\n\nHew McLeod went to Punjab almost fifty years ago as a Christian missionary, to do what missionaries do best – convert others to their truth.\n\n“Their truth”? I thought truth is truth. It is, however, important to note that Dr McLeod had the courage of his conviction to leave his hometown with his young wife to go to a country that did not probably have electricity supply at that time in the areas he went to. It is equally important to remember that he came to Punjab with the purpose of converting the Punjabis (mainly Sikhs) to Christianity. The first Christian mission was established in Ludhiana in 1846 in the immediate aftermath of the first Anglo-Sikh war. Everyone who tried to convert Sikhs, met with failure, most prominent failure being Dr Ernest Trumpp, a German Missionary. Dr McLeod was to become another name in this long list of failures.\n\n9.\n\nApparently, he fell in love with Punjab and Sikhs and lost his missionary zeal and purpose.\n\nFrom his life it is not at all “apparent” that Dr McLeod was motivated by any love for Punjab or Sikhs. By his own admission, it was a huge shock when he landed in Punjab. All the time he and Margaret spent there before going to England was spent facing one hardship after another.\n\nHowever, he did love a particular type of Sikhs – the Sikhs who are still not able to differentiate between where a blessing comes from and who should they thank for it. He quickly realized that if one speaks nicely to a Sikh, we find it hard to challenge anything one might say that would usually be unpalatable. If one obliges a Sikh, one may be sure of eternal indebtedness of a Sikh. That is what Dr McLeod used to silence people like Dr Harbans Singh (perhaps Nikki Guninder can tell us some more about her father’s relationship with Dr McLeod and her own indebtedness to Dr McLeod in finding placement in Western academia).\n\n10.\n\nBy his own admission, he became agnostic, if not an atheist.\n\nDr McLeod was very very intelligent and he used his words in a way which communicated another meaning to an average person and a completely different meaning to those with some intelligence. His description of himself as “agnostic” falls in the same category. Agnostic has two meanings:\n\n1. somebody denying God’s existence is provable: somebody who believes that it is impossible to know whether or not God exists\n\n2. somebody denying something is knowable: somebody who doubts that a particular question has a single correct answer or that a complete understanding of something can be attained: I’m an agnostic concerning space aliens.\n\nDr McLeod’s Sikh apologists argue that he meant the word in its first meaning, whereas his whole life seems to argue that he meant the second meaning, which fits nicely with his argument that he was “a skeptic” in his approach to Sikh history. “I’m an agnostic concerning Sikhs” would be an apt paraphrasing of Dr McLeod’s oft repeated statement. That he did not mean to use the term “agnostic” in its first usage may also be clear from the fact that he headed the History Board of Presbyterian Church of NZ till cancer of the bone made him give up his position in 2004.\n\nIt is a measure of general lack of awareness amongst the Sikhs that his apologists keep on arguing that Dr McLeod “lost faith in God”.\n\n………….to be continued.\n\nSikh Missionary Society: Articles: Sikhism & Dr Hew McLeod\n\nA Gentleman and A Scholar by JAGPAL SINGH TIWANA Spinning Wheel Honours Hew McLeod - News Report\n\n[http://www.sikhchic.com/our_best_friends/w_hew_mcleod_1932_2009_reflections_of_the_sikh_studies_community W.
