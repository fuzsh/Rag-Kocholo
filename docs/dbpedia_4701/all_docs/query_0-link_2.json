        "text": "I did not intend to deal with Sub-head I. It speaks for itself. There is an increase of £40,793, as shown by the Estimate. In addition, there is a sum of £40,000 from the Unemployment Fund being spent on the Improvement of Estates.\n\nTo come to the work of the Land Commission for the last year, when the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board were amalgamated there were £4,000,000 worth of pending sales in the Land Commission, and £5,000,000 worth of pending sales in the Congested Districts Board. The £5,000,000 worth of pending sales in the Congested Districts Board had been accumulating for years. One of the complaints against the Congested Districts Board was that they were accumulating estates and not dividing them. That was not their fault. They had not sufficient powers under the Act to acquire lands compulsorily to meet the peculiar and difficult needs of the congested districts. They bought lands and they kept them on hands with a view to acquiring more land, so as to have sufficient land to deal with the problems in that area. However, we have far more drastic powers under the Act of 1923. There is no occasion for the Land Commission to keep lands on hands. As I have said, there were £5,000,000 worth of pending sales under the Congested Districts Board, and there were £4,000,000 in the Land Commission.\n\nThe Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board amalgamated, and now there are £2,000,000 worth of sales, that is to say half the Land Commission sales are being dealt with still, and in addition out of 21,000 acres of untenanted arable land which the Congested Districts Board had in their possession when the amalgamation took place, 11,000 acres has been divided, and the balance will be divided before the end of this year, so that all that untenanted arable land will be divided before next Spring and in time for next year's sowings. That 21,000 acres represents the total area of arable land which the Board had at the time when the two services, the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board, were amalgamated, that is to say last September. Within the year the Land Commission have divided half of it, and before the end of the year will have divided the balance. I may say that the average rate of division of land during the year 1922 was £2,000,000, so that in respect of the old sales sales of lands purchased under previous Acts, the Land Commission in the last year have dealt with £2,000,000 worth of the land which they had before the amalgamation, and at least half the arable land which the Congested Districts Board had in their possession at the time of the amalgamation. That is in addition to dealing with extraordinary arrears, and dealing with all the huge preliminary work that had to be done in connection with the Land Act of 1923.\n\nWith regard to the arrears of annuities problem, this is a sore subject, and I wish to put before the Deputies the position in regard to arrears of Land Commission annuities. In 1922-23 about £1,000,000 worth of arrears of annuities began to become due. The total collection of annuities amounted to £2,900,000. The gale days are June and December, and in January, 1923, there would be about £800,000 worth of arrears, and that would be reduced down to £400,000 by the following May, that is, a month before the next gale. What did that show? It showed that the annuitants were trying to establish something in the nature of a hanging gale, by paying the December gale of annuity about a month before the next annuity was due. The same thing happened in regard to the June gale of annuity; arrears again showed up to £1,000,000, and began to fall gradually to £300,000 or £400,000, say, in November or October. Everybody knows that unless Land Commission annuities are paid, the money must be found from the Guarantee Fund. Everybody knows that the Land Commission annuities are the interest on the Sinking Fund of stock that was issued for the purchase of the lands. The draw on the Guarantee Fund takes place in the month of February in respect of the December gale. Any arrears in December carry on to the beginning of August, and any arrears in respect of June carry on to December, so that what was happening was this, in those months, February and August of each year, there was a draw of £500,000 or £600,000 on the Guarantee Fund, and a draw on the Agricultural Grant. The Agricultural Grant is the first item that has to bear the loss. What was the result? The result was that the rates on agricultural land were considerably higher than they should be, and that the men who were paying the arrears of annuities were paying an increased agricultural rate. You had people complaining about the increased rates and the size of the rates all over the country. It was inevitable that the rates should be much bigger if this tendency to increase the arrears was allowed to grow. We were faced with the problem either of collecting Land Commission annuities punctually or allowing the rate on agricultural land to be inflated to a far greater degree than it should be. There was no question of what we should do in the matter. There is not a farmers' organisation in the country that does not admit that the Land Commission annuities must be paid.\n\nI will go further. There is not a responsible farmer in the country who does not admit that Land Commission annuities should be paid. But while these admissions are made, while no one makes a case that they should not be paid, nevertheless there was the problem that one-third of the annuities were going into arrears, and so far as about 40 per cent. of the annuitants were concerned, the receivable orders might as well not have been issued. In at least 40 per cent. of these cases they waited until they got the six days' notice to pay, and in some counties in at least 80 per cent. of cases the annuitants waited, wherever they paid at all, until they got the six days' notice to pay. So that these six-day notices which were used in normal times to remind three, or four, or five per cent. of annuitants who were in arrears that they had not paid their annuities were becoming in fact another receivable order, and it was practically evident that the expense— practically evident that the money— orders was money thrown away; that the six-day notices were taking the place for 50 per cent. of the annuitants of the receivable orders. In that state of affairs, and in view of the necessity of collecting these arrears of annuities promptly, which everybody admits should be paid, the Land Commission ceased issuing the notices, and in the month of January of this year they published in all the daily and provincial papers notices to the effect that they would not in future issue these notices, that the annuitants who were in arrear would be processed without the usual six-day notices. It is alleged that annuitants in some cases have been processed after they had paid their annuities. I have never got a single case authenticated where this has occurred, and I am anxious to get these cases. Deputy White raised it by asking a question some time ago. He asked was it a fact that a couple of hundred processes were issued in Donegal, and was it a fact that some of these processes were served on annuitants who had already paid. What are the facts? The facts are that a couple of hundred processes were issued in Donegal against people who were a year in arrear, and for whom the ratepayers of the County Donegal were paying. Only in five cases were processes served on tenants who had already paid their annuities, and in these five cases the annuities came in after the processes had been handed to the process-servers, and before service.\n\nI know exactly how that sort of thing happens. The solicitor writes for the payment to the tenant-purchaser. He asks him to pay his annuity. He probably gets no reply. This annuity is a year in arrear. The tenant knows that it is due in the month of June or the month of December, as the case may be. He does not pay it. He does not pay the solicitor. He waits for two or three months, when the processes are issued and are in the hands of the process server. It is not absolutely unknown that the fact that the processes are in the hands of the process-server gets out, and he hops in and pays his annuity. As I say, in five instances in this particular case, which I have investigated carefully, out of the few hundred, where the annuities have been paid they were paid after the processes were handed to the process-server, and before he had succeeded in serving them. I would not make the slightest excuse if that were the case in the whole two hundred and not in the five instances, because I know how these things happen.\n\nWith regard to the work of the Land Commission in connection with the new Act there are about a hundred thousand tenants unpurchased, and for the purpose of collecting both the compounded arrears of rent and the payments in lieu of rent it was necessary to get the correct particulars of each of these and of their rents. For the purpose of vesting their holdings in the Land Commission it was necessary to get not only the name and address and the correct rent of each of these tenants, but also particulars as regards their holdings, the area, a map of each holding, whether the holding was judicial or non-judicial, and whether the rent was first, second or third term. That was all required for the purpose of fixing a price. That is to say, if you joined the two necessities, namely, the necessity for getting particulars for the collection of payment in lieu of rent, and the fixing of the price of each holding, it was necessary to get in respect of each tenant unpurchased his name and address, his exact rent to a penny, the map of his holding, his area, and whether his holding was judicial or non-judicial, first, second or third term. That is to say the Land Commission had to establish what was a land agent's office for every tenant left unpurchased, and had to get particulars not approximately correct, but particulars with regard to each tenant's holding absolutely accurately.\n\nOtherwise any sale based on that figure could be afterwards upset by the Courts. They proceeded to do that by writing to each landlord asking him to return the rents of his tenants with these particulars. That was obviously the right course. There is about one landlord for every 20 tenants, and there would be about 4,500 landlords against 100,000 tenants. The landlords within a certain time returned these particulars, and in 40 per cent. of cases these particulars were found to be incorrect. They were materially incorrect in regard to the rents because as a rule the tenants did not get credit for abatements. You all know what abatements are. Abatements may not appear on the face of the receipt; they may appear on the fly-leaf or something like that; but you all know that in a great many cases the rent receipt does not show the exact rent. In any event, in 40 per cent. of cases the particulars were not accurate. That meant that the Land Commission had to interview every tenant or every landlord, or had to settle the question by correspondence. Possibly Deputies have some idea of the difficulty of settling a question of that sort. These questions had to be settled, and in over 2,000 cases they had to go before the Land Judge. For the last ten months Judge Wylie has tried about 2,000 cases which will rule, I suppose, a large number of others. That work has all been completed within about eight months, and in my opinion it was a very considerable feat for the Land Commission in all the circumstances, in view of the difficulty of dealing with people on a question like this by correspondence, and getting all these particulars accurately within a period of eight months. And remember all these particulars are necessary for the automatic working of the Land Act.\n\nDeputies should also remember that the Land Act in a great many of its more important provisions works automatically once the basis is laid down, and this preliminary work is of primary importance in view of the fact that it is the basis on which any question in the course of the administration of the Act might be brought before the Judicial Commissioner. Any sale might be interfered with if the preliminary particulars were not accurately ascertained. All these preliminary particulars have been ascertained within the last eight months, and practically the first year's compounded arrears of rent have been collected with very little difficulty in the circumstances. The payment in lieu of rent is being collected, and between payment in lieu of rent, compounded arrears of rent, and between the annuity and interest in lieu of rent the Land Commission has collected £5,000,000 per annum. In addition to that the Land Commission have now inspected about 350,000 acres of untenanted land. After inspection and before the land can be acquired compulsorily a three months period must intervene. When the Land Commission decide that they intend to acquire a certain area of land they gazette it in the Official Gazette, and a period of three months intervenes between the date when this notice is inserted and the date when the lands are actually acquired. The same applies with regard to vesting a tenant's holding. Before any tenant's holding can be vested it must be three months gazetted, for the reason that a great many people may have a right to object to the vesting. It is quite possible that a tenant would not have a legal claim to the land, and there are other reasons of that sort.\n\nTo make a long story short, within the last year the Land Commission dealt with almost as much land, purchased under the 1903 Act and the 1909 Act, as the Land Commission in previous years when they had nothing else to administer but these Acts. That is to say, they dealt with £2,000,000 worth of pending sales as against an average of £2,500,000. In addition they have divided half the arable land which accumulated under the Congested Districts Board, which came over with the Congested Districts Board and which represented years of arrears and will have completed the division by the end of this year. In addition, they have reduced the abnormal arrears problem which developed during 1922 and 1923 to practically normal proportions. They have done practically all the preliminaries, the important difficult preliminary work in connection with the Land Act of 1923, and they have inspected at least 350,000 acres of untenanted land. They have done that with practically no additional staff. They have some additional officials on the outdoor staff, but it is only within the last two months that an additional outdoor staff has been employed and a further additional staff will be employed as they are required. It is often suggested that the land should be divided here and there without any general plan on the part of the Land Commission, and I just wish Deputies to get an idea of what that would mean. These figures will have to be taken as approximate. There are about 5,000,000 acres, available for the Land Commission under the new Act. That is a very generous figure, and that is taking as much land as they possibly could, in my opinion, take. There are 100,000 tenants. Most of these tenants are in the congested districts. Most of them live on very small, miserable holdings. They are the problem that was not solved in the past. They are the problem that was never faced in the past owing to the difficulties of solving the problem. Taking a line from the 1903 Act, it takes about 3,000,000 acres to deal with 100,000 tenants. I cannot give accurate figures, but this figure is a deduction. Taking a line from previous Acts, it took on an average about 3,000,000 acres to deal with 100,000 tenants.\n\nIt will take at least 3,000,000 acres to deal with the 100,000 tenants we have. Most of them live in Connaught, on the western seaboard, in Cavan, in all the counties where the congests are and most of them have small miserable holdings, smaller holdings than were dealt with under the 1903 Act, and, in my opinion, the amount of land you require will be nearer 4,000,000 acres. We have to make up our minds whether we will deal with the congests now regardless of the difficulties or the attraction of leaving them there and dealing with other classes, or whether we will set out to solve the biggest problem left in the country—the terrible poverty that you find in places like Mayo, Sligo and Donegal. I have no doubt myself that whatever the difficulties are that the Land Act of 1923 will have failed unless we deal with the problem that these counties present, and that any other policy in the way of giving land to the landless, no matter how attractive, at the expense of these congests, is unsound. If we carry on that policy to a successful conclusion it will mean that we will have to be under the necessity of migrating a very large number of small tenants from Connemara, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and other counties which I need not mention and which are not included in what is rather technically known as the \"congested areas.\" In addition, we will have to migrate—and this will be the more difficult problem—fairly large tenants with 100, 120, and up to 150 acres in order to make room for the congests in the holdings which they leave after them. There is no question about it, the larger tenant is the more suitable migrant. He is better educated, he knows his way about better, he knows conditions better and, as a rule, he will prefer to go because the large tenant with 120 to 140 acres surrounded by twenty or forty miserable congests has not got all the security of tenure he would desire, and it will be an advantage to him and to the congests to migrate him. The real danger will be in his reception in the other districts by the tenants, say, in the counties of Kilkenny, Tipperary, Meath or Dublin.\n\nThis problem cannot be solved unless every party co-operates. They must co-operate and resist the temptation of making cheap capital out of migration and out of getting land divided round their own districts. We have to face the thing now. We are at the parting of the ways. The preliminary work is being done, and we must make up our minds as to what our policy is going to be. I know the country well enough to know that it will be extremely difficult to carry out. There is no question as to the right policy, and that it cannot be done until Deputies remember that each in his own area must get up and say even the unpopular thing when they know it is the right thing.\n\nIf the statement that was made here by the Minister this evening in regard to the necessity for collection of arrears of annuities could be made by the Minister, assisted by Deputy Gorey, to a general meeting of the farmers of the Free State area, I am sure every Deputy would agree that it would save many of us a good many communications and also receiving a good many deputations. They would not be necessary if farmers fully realised the import of the statement made by the Minister. The Minister has, in his detailed statement, given figures and facts which I presume will mean that Deputies will not have to ask the questions which have really been answered in his statement. With regard to Deputy White's complaint, which he has fairly well justified, it may be due to the fact that there is a border-line between Donegal and the Land Commission and that the delay involved is due to the fact that there is a hold-up somewhere or other between the point of forwarding and the point of receiving those communications. When that border-line disappears, through the activities of Deputy White and his colleagues in the North, the delay may not seem so great as he complains of to-night.\n\nWhat I really rose to complain of to-night is a matter which I have already brought to the notice of the Minister and which I am even yet receiving a great number of communications about. Landlords are at present advertising for sale, either by private treaty or by public auction, lands that are likely to be acquired by the Land Commission under the Land Act of 1923. I do not say that there is any great cause for complaint in a case where land is being changed from one owner to another. But the trouble arises in many cases that have come under my notice, where Landowners have split up their land and have advertised it for sale and sold it in many cases by private treaty, the divisions into which it was split constituting small and uneconomic holdings. I say that should not be allowed to go on by the Land Commission if there is any method by which the Commission can prevent such a thing taking place. The Minister has referred to this matter before and answered questions in connection with it where questions have been asked. The Minister, in his statement, told us that inspections have taken place in regard to 350,000 out of a possible 5,000,000 acres likely to be acquired by the Land Commission. If landowners are to be allowed between now and the time the 5,000,000 acres are likely to be acquired, to split up their land in small uneconomic lots and sell it by private treaty or public auction, when such land is likely to be acquired, it will not alone create confusion and misunderstanding in the localities affected but it will cause considerable confusion to the Land Commission when at a later stage they come along to acquire these lands. In the cases that have come under my notice I know that this has caused a good deal of irritation locally and there is a feeling amongst the local uneconomic holders, which is justified to a great extent, that this land should be inspected, valued and an effort made to acquire it now before the auction takes place or the lands are handed over to some other person. I have brought this matter to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture and may I say that at all times and in all matters concerning questions of land, he is approachable and gives fair consideration to any claim put up. The only ground of dissatisfaction, I think, is that in cases where lands have been advertised by public auction or private treaty and split into small lots adequate steps have not been taken to counteract the activities of the landowners. In my opinion in these cases the landowners are trying to forestall the activities of the Land Commission. At present this matter presents a problem and creates confusion in the districts concerned. It will present a very serious problem at a later stage if the Land Commission come to acquire these lands.\n\nIf land is advertised for sale, especially land that has been split up into small uneconomic holdings—and this particularly applies in the constituency of Leix and Offaly, although I understand other constituencies are affected —I see no difficulty in the way of the Land Commission sending down Inspectors to value the land and make an offer to the owner. I realise that, if the landowner wishes to put an obstacle in the way of the Land Commission acquiring land compulsorily, it may take time to acquire it. Personally, if the Land Commission is not prepared to take some effective steps to deal with this particular situation, which is a serious and critical one in one of the counties in my constituency, I am prepared to take all the constitutional means at my disposal to prevent any other people from securing these lands. I would only do that as a last resort. But I would take steps, of a constitutional nature at any rate, to see that it would not be profitable for any people to come in and buy lands that I hope in the near future will be acquired by the Land Commission under the Land Act. I hope the Minister will make the position quite clear with regard to the attitude of his Department on that matter, particularly concerning landowners who split up large estates into uneconomic holdings which they know in time will be acquired by the Land Commission.\n\nThere is another question that I want to get some information upon. I am not quite sure if I understood the Minister rightly. That is why I press for a definite understanding. Is it the intention of the Ministry, in respect to this 5,000,000 acres which is to be acquired, to inspect and value all acquired lands before they proceed to divide the lands amongst the people in any area. That is a point that should be made quite clear. So far as Deputies representing rural areas are concerned, great difficulty is experienced by them when they receive a large number of communications in regard to the attitude of the Commission on this and other questions which they are unable to answer. If the Minister would make the position a little more clear in regard to that and other matters, it would relieve Deputies who are not in a position to reply right away to questions which they are asked without transferring these communications to the Land Commission.\n\nWith regard to what seems to be new appointments of inspectors, I would like to ask the Minister from what class these land inspectors have been recruited; what, if any, are the qualifications necessary for the appointments, and if any of these inspectors are sent to inspect or value land in the districts from which they come? I think it would be very undesirable that an inspector, say, from Leix should be sent down there to do this work. I would rather see a man from Donegal, Galway or somewhere else sent to the district. In that way one would expect that an inspector would be more impartial than he would be if sent to the district from which he came originally. At any rate, I would like to have some information as to the method of recruiting these fifty-two land inspectors who have been appointed this year.\n\nI think that there will be general agreement with the Minister's statement that the Land Commission is working very hard. I am as critical of its work as anybody but I can agree with the Minister's statement, and I also agree with the principles which he has enunciated in regard to untenanted land. The problem cannot be dealt with by counties or districts but from the point of view that congestion exists and that the greatest congestion must first be relieved and so on down the whole line until the State, which Deputy Sears wishes, has been created. There has been a good deal of discussion as to the attitude of the Land Commission in prosecuting tenants for arrears. Deputy White has been inclined to blame the Land Commission; I am not going to blame the Land Commission but the Minister himself. He is responsible as the Land Act, and the arrears that were tacked on to it, have created the state by which the tenants had to pay arrears on annuities in twelve months. It is because they were honest enough to pay where they had not got the money that there has been a great deal of contention as well as actions in the courts, and very considerable dissatisfaction throughout the country. The Minister may as well accept it and realise that it is the Land Act and not his Department that is responsible for that. It is not owing to the administration of his Department but to the fact that the Act provides that tenants have to pay arrears which they have not paid off yet. I presume that we are debarred from discussing that part of the Land Act which deals with arrears. I would like to hear the Minister say, as I heard him say some time ago, that in the distribution of land, account is not going to be taken of the political point of view of claimants for land. There is what I believe to be a very false impression created throughout the country, that only the adherents of a certain political party will have any claim or right to get any land that will be distributed. Very good care has been taken to disseminate that point of view in many counties, but I believe it is not correct. It would be a very false standard on which to base a man's claim for land. I believe that many of them would be found to be very unworthy and, in some cases, incapable of managing the land if they got it, taking into account the use they have made of the little land already in their possession. That ought to be the standard by which a man's fitness should be judged and not his adherence to this or that political party. I think it would be a good thing if the Minister would state that, irrespective of what political party a man may belong to, whether he belongs to the political party in this House or to that outside it, his claim, will be recognised. I would also like the Minister to state what position we are in with regard to the vesting of land.\n\nI believe that in a considerable number of cases the arrears have been paid off, and that the tenants are in a position on some estates to have the land vested and thus to enjoy the full benefits of the Land Act. When does the Minister expect that this land will be vested, and why have steps not been taken before now to put the Minister in a position to pay for this land in order that it may be vested in the tenants? I would also like to know if the Minister has reconsidered his attitude with regard to the payment of arrears to facilitate the vesting of land, and whether arrears still outstanding shall be added to the purchase money. I also want to suggest to the Minister, in regard to the allusion made by Deputy Sears to the bogs, that in some counties this question of taking over bogs is causing very serious trouble, and has cost life in some cases. On many estates that will be vested in tenants under the 1923 Act there is a considerable portion of bog adjoining, but up to the present this bog is still in the possession of the landlord. In many cases the tenants do not know whether the bog is in the possession of the landlord or the Land Commission, and do not know whether the landlord has a right to set it or not. There is a large portion of bog not used by tenants, although a considerable number of them are in need of bog. The landlord may, perhaps, permit tenants on the estate to use it, but he will not permit outsiders to do so. I would urge the Minister that in the period that will elapse before next season's turf-making, steps should be taken as far as possible by the Land Commission to acquire and distribute bogs on estates that will be vested in tenants under the 1923 Act. I am not speaking of bogs in areas that may be termed untenanted, but where the tenants will have land vested in them. I would urge this point strongly on the Minister because not only is it an economic necessity in some districts, but it is also a matter that is causing very serious dissatisfaction and grave trouble. I recognise, of course, that the distribution of untenanted land is the first work to be done, but the distribution of untenanted land will go on in some districts to the benefit of some people, whereas in other districts very little will be done and very little benefit will accrue under the Land Act. Exorbitant rents are being paid for bogs, while the Minister has it in his power to reduce such rents. The holders are required in some districts to pay £1 a perch in order to have a fire in the winter. The Minister has power to reduce those rents, and I urge him, along with the work in connection with the distribution of untenanted land, to do what he can in this matter.\n\nI think there is some slight misunderstanding, at least in some quarters, as to what I meant to convey when I gave figures of the numbers of tenants unpurchased, and of the amount of land available to deal with them. There are 100,000 tenants in the country. A tenant purchaser holds his land in fee simple, and is not, properly speaking, a tenant. There are 100,000 agricultural tenants who pay rents to landlords. The figure is slightly less, but it is not worth speaking about. The figures include congests, uneconomic holders, big farmers and small farmers—100,000 judicial and non-judicial tenants, present and future. I hope that is clear. They include everybody inside and outside the congested districts, congests and non-congests, big farmers and small farmers.\n\nI said that the amount of land available for the Land Commission on a very generous estimate—I am taking into account probably all the land that the Land Commission can be reasonably expected to acquire—is about 5,000,000 acres. By a little analysis of previous operations of the Land Commission I have found that 100,000 tenant-purchasers were planted on between 2,500,000 acres and 3,000,000 acres of land. These figures are rough, but you can make some deductions from them, and one fairly safe deduction is that it will require 3,000,000 acres of land to deal with the existing tenants, and this will include in a great many instances part of their own holdings. It is certain that it will require 3,000,000 acres to deal with the existing tenants, but I think the amount required is nearer to 4,000,000 acres. Deputy O'Connell pointed out that a very great many tenant-purchasers who had already purchased their land under previous Acts, and who are paying their annuities, are still uneconomic, and have to be dealt with. I am afraid the fact is that we cannot expect, even with ideal conditions and even with the co-operation of everybody, to deal with congests under this Act, or any Act, so as to solve the problem finally, but rather our aim should be to go as far as we can to solve it, and at least to make sure that difficulties encountered can be got over, and should not be allowed to stand in the way of a solution of that particular problem. I do not mean to suggest for one moment that we were to concentrate on the congested districts, and I never meant to suggest that congests outside what are technically known as congested districts were not to be dealt with. I did not deal at any length with congests outside congested districts, for they present no problem as a rule, except in a county like Cavan, and in certain small areas outside Cavan, where they do present difficulties, but as a general rule, taking the country as a whole, present no problem, for there is land. They can be dealt with quite simply. I took it for granted that no one could possibly so misconstrue what I said as to think it was our intention to make holdings within the congested districts economic, and leave congests outside the congested districts out of the settlement.\n\nI referred to congests especially because they are, roughly speaking, the most difficult problem. There are, as I said, small areas outside the congested districts that are also a difficult problem because of the absence of untenanted land in the neighbourhood, but speaking generally the congests present the really difficult problem. That was the reason that I referred to them and concentrated on them for the moment. All I intended to convey was that when the Land Commission was acquiring untenanted land in the congested districts they have to keep well in mind the fact that they are to deal with every uneconomic tenant left unpurchased, and in addition with a very large number of uneconomic tenant purchasers who have purchased their holdings under the previous Land Acts. When dividing untenanted land, either inside or outside a congested district, they must keep the fact well in mind that if they are to deal with all the congests, or with a reasonable number of them, if they are to make a reasonable number of uneconomic holdings economic they must be careful not to divide the land indiscriminately and choose a few congests who happen to be in the neighbourhood, and so far as the remainder of the land is concerned to divide it among landless men. They must be careful to follow some general scheme. They must have in their minds the fact that even though there may be very few congests in this particular district, there may be a very large number of congests in other districts who will have to be migrated. When Deputies asked me why could not land be bought here, there and everywhere, and divided with an eye to the immediate needs, that is the reason that that cannot be done. Deputies should realise that though it may be a very effective proposition to talk of taking different estates in this county or the other county to advertise the work of the Land Commission, by doing that, and dividing these estates amongst landless men of particular districts we would be pursuing a policy which, if continued, would leave us in the end with, I should say, three-quarters of the congests of the Western seaboard, and of other places like Cork and Cavan, where there are a very large number of congests concentrated. That is as far as I wish to go under that heading.\n\nI do not want to hold out the hope that the Land Commission will be able to deal with all congests. They will not. The problem is too big. There will be a residue of congests who will not be migrated, I am afraid. There will be, apart altogether from the fact that there may not be enough land, even if they could be migrated, a large number of congests left who will not migrate in the end. The exigencies of the case will be such, perhaps, that landless men will be dealt with even to a greater extent than would be absolutely correct if one were in a position to put through an ideal solution. Between one thing and another, between the difficulty of migrating congests, between the difficulty of finding suitable areas to which to migrate them, between the expense, between the demand of landless men for land in areas where there are no congests— taking all the circmustances into account, it will surprise me if in the end all the congests are dealt with. But certainly the policy of the Land Commission should be, so far as possible, to aim at dealing with all congests, and it should be the aim of every responsible party in the State to co-operate in that, and to forego, each and every one of them, the undoubted political advantages to be gained in advocating land purchase for this area and that area. Without the co-operation of every party and of every responsible Deputy, every responsible public man, with a general consciousness that it is necessary to examine, first, the claims of people who may be living at the other end of the country before you can divide land among people who would be in other circumstances entitled to the land, and who live in the particular neighbourhood, you will not be able to deal with the problem. With that consciousness, with that policy clearly defined, and with the goodwill and co-operation of every party behind that policy, you can go very near to the solving of this problem.\n\nI want to clear up one point. I stated that 40 per cent. of returns made by landlords were incorrect. That statement in itself is not quite correct. What I should have said was that 40 per cent. of returns made by landlords were challenged by tenants, and that is not exactly the same thing as saying that 40 per cent. of the returns were incorrect. They were challenged by the tenants largely on the ground that abatements of rent were not allowed, and in some cases the tenants' contention was upheld; in other cases the landlord's contention. I could not say what the proportion was. I should say that it was about half-and-half of the 40 per cent. But I was not correct in stating that 40 per cent. of the returns made by landlords were incorrect. The exact fact is that 40 per cent. of returns made by landlords were challenged by tenants, and in some cases the landlords were vindicated, while in others the tenants were. As a result of these disputes the Judicial Commissioner had to try at least two thousand cases. Deputy White instanced cases where processes were served after the bank drafts had been sent to the Land Commission. I am quite sure that that is so. What occurs is this. Tenant purchasers owed a year's arrears, and after they had sent their annuities direct to the Land Commission they received processes. That occurred, of course, every day. Tenant purchasers let the 1st June pass without paying their annuities. They waited until the end of June, knowing that they were a month in arrears. They wait for the first notice, for the second notice, for the third notice, for the fourth notice. They wait until they get a solicitor's letter——"
