        "text": "Uprising\n\nThe Easter Rising took place against a backdrop of increased political tension. This was caused by British reluctance to implement Home Rule - enacted by the 1914 Government of Ireland Act - and their assertion that it could only be done if military conscription was also introduced to Ireland.\n\nThis linking of conscription and Home Rule outraged Irish nationalists of all persuasions. But the militant Irish Republican Brotherhood, along with sections of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army, opted for a violent response.\n\nBritish response\n\nThe revolt came as something of a shock to the British. Their intelligence mistakenly believed the plot had been postponed following the Royal Navy’s recent interception of smuggled German weapons.\n\nIt took the better part of a day to organise a response, which was inevitably armed. There were only a few troops in Dublin, so soldiers were rushed there from elsewhere in Ireland, including the Curragh in County Kildare, and from across the sea in Britain.\n\nCollapse of the rebellion\n\nThe rebels were slowly driven back in violent street fighting. Many of Dublin’s landmarks became the focus of bitter struggles, including the South Dublin Union Workhouse (now St James’s Hospital), which was flying the flag of the Irish Volunteers. After several days of intense fighting there, a breach in the wall was made and the building finally occupied.\n\nThe city was divided into quarters and the rebels steadily pushed into one area, all exits from which were closed. Eventually, only the GPO remained in their hands. The arrival of British infantry reinforcements and light artillery ended the siege there on 29 April.\n\nBritish losses were 120 killed and nearly 400 wounded. Around 60 men from the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army were killed during the revolt. Over 180 civilians also died.\n\nPublic opinion\n\nThe rising lacked wide-scale public support at its outset, and not only among Unionists opposed to Irish independence. Many Dubliners had relatives fighting in the British Army and felt it was a betrayal of them; others objected to the violence used by some rebels and to the disruption to food supplies.\n\nSome people saw the violence as an opportunity to loot shops. Others watched the fighting with a mixture of indifference and curiosity.\n\nExecutions and internment\n\nThe subsequent British military occupation of the city and the internment of over 1,400 Republicans - many of whom had little do with the rising - angered many and increased electoral support for Sinn Féin.\n\nMost importantly, the British reprisals against the revolt’s leaders, 16 of whom were executed, generated great sympathy for Republican ideas.\n\nLessons\n\nMany Irish Republicans took a dim view of the rising’s military strategy. Michael Collins, who had fought at the GPO, believed the policy of capturing and then holding indefensible and vulnerable posts in the middle of the capital to be foolhardy. Such places were impossible to escape from and hard to supply.\n\nIt was a lesson he would not forget when leading a successful guerrilla war against the British during the subsequent Irish War of Independence (1919-21)."
