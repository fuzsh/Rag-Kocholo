        "text": "William Hewat McLeod (1932–2009), also known as Hew McLeod, was a New Zealand scholar whose research and publications helped establish Sikhism studies as a distinctive field outside India.[1][2] He joined the Presbyterian church mission in late 1950s which sent him to Punjab, India. In the mid 1960s, he studied in the United Kingdom, where he earned a doctorate, and where his wife and he adopted a half-Punjabi girl.[1] Thereafter he oft-visited India, researched and wrote extensively about Sikh scriptures, literature and history. He produced many books and essays on Sikh identity and the theology of Sikhism.[2]\n\nHis scholarly work frequently provoked controversy in the Sikh community.[1][3][4] His work attracted hostility from Sikh scholars, who questioned his ties to Christianity and colonial British rule. Thus his analysis is seen by some Sikh Scholars as having a propensity for historical revisionism and colonial whitewashing.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nMcLeod was born and raised in a farming family near Feilding, in New Zealand's North Island. He met Margaret Wylie in Dunedin during his university studies, and they were married in May 1955. They had four children.[1]\n\nAcademic career[edit]\n\nMcLeod, educated at Nelson College from 1946 to 1950,[5] attended the University of Otago in Dunedin, where he earned a BA and then an MA in history, graduating in 1954.[6] He then began theological studies and in 1958 joined the New Zealand Presbyterian Church's mission to Punjab, India. At Kharar, in Punjab, he learned the local languages (Hindi and Punjabi) and taught English at the Christian Boys secondary school.\n\nLater, he completed a PhD at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London in 1965.[1] He lectured in history at the University of Otago from 1971.[7]\n\nIn 1990 the University of London awarded him a DLit,[8] and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1999.[9]\n\nScholarship[edit]\n\nMcLeod applied historical methodology and critical textual approach to Sikh literature. While considering Guru Nanak to consider both Hindu and Muslim beliefs as wrong, and Sikhism to be distinct from both, as opposed to a synthesis, he categorized the faith as a \"reworking of the sant synthesis,\" despite the explicit statements of Nanak delineating the start of a new panth with new traditions, and leaving this unaccounted.[2]\n\nHe analyzed the Sikh janamsakhis, or texts on the lives of the Sikh gurus, considering them only a broad outline of Guru Nanak's life, with little reliable information and facts,[2] counting 87 of 124 sakhis as variously discounted, improbable, or only possible, with 37 as probable or established.[10] His use, however, of both contemporary and secondary works has been described as \"highly selective,\" with little use of the primary scripture of Sikhism, the Adi Granth, or treatises derived thereof, and generalizations, \"theories, hypotheses, suppositions, and guesswork\" at the expense of factual information, among other criticisms.[2][11] Similarly, he studied the interaction of various Sikh sects and the evolution of the Sikh scriptures, thereby showing the complexity of Sikh society, theology and history.[2][12][13]\n\nMcLeod has been accused of presenting distorted and biased accounts of Sikhism in a number of books, which were more on a journalistic level rather than serious academic works, described as disrespectful and unethical attacks against the Sikhs.[14] He has also received criticism for \"defin[ing] his position as a historian in a manner that aligns him with the orientalists,\" with a \"certain degree of inbuilt Eurocentricism,\" and that \"contrary to the dictates of the Western historical outlook and tradition, he is extremely reluctant to change or even to modify his interpretation in the light of new evidence, or the old evidence seen from a new perspective,\" with his methodology and approach resulting in \"premature hypotheses.\" His acceptance Harjot Oberoi's hypothesis of the diversity of factions within Sanatan Sikhi was considered to have further compromised his basic understanding of Sikh treatises.[2] His works nevertheless have also been credited with \"expanding the scope of Sikh studies,\" bringing a significant quantity of Sikh literature to scholarly notice.[2]\n\nSelected works[edit]\n\nSikhism (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0140252606)\n\nSikhs and Sikhism (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0195647459)\n\nSikhs of the Khalsa: A History of the Khalsa Rahit (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0195672216)\n\nThe Sikhs: History, Religion, and Society (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0231068158)\n\nWho is a Sikh?: The Problem of Sikh Identity (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0198265484)\n\nHistorical Dictionary of Sikhism (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0810850885)\n\nEssays in Sikh History, Tradition, and Society (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0195682742)\n\nExploring Sikhism: Aspects of Sikh Identity, Culture, and Thought (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0195649028)\n\nGuru Nanak and the Sikh Religion (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0198265212)\n\nEarly Sikh Tradition a Study of the Janam Sakhis (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0198265328)\n\nThe Evolution of the Sikh Community: Five Essays (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0198265298)\n\nThe Sikhs of the Punjab (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0853621233)\n\nPopular Sikh Art (<templatestyles src=\"Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css\" />ISBN 0195627911)\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" />\n\n[edit]\n\nGrewal, J.
