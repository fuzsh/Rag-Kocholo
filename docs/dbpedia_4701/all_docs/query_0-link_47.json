        "text": "Irish politician (1878–1945)\n\nMargaret Collins-O'Driscoll (18 August 1876 – 17 June 1945) was an Irish Cumann na nGaedheal politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North constituency from 1923 to 1933.\n\nEarly life\n\nMargaret Mary Collins was born in Woodfield, Clonakilty, County Cork, on 18 August 1876.[1] The eldest of three daughters and five sons of Michael Collins, a farmer, and Mary Anne O'Brien.[2] She was the eldest sister of the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins. She was educated at Baggot Street Training College and was a schoolteacher and school principal before entering politics.[3] A primary-school teacher, for many years she was principal of Lisavaird girls' national school in Clonakilty, and also taught in Dublin.[2]\n\nPolitics\n\nShe was the first female Cumann na nGaedheal TD. In 1926 she was elected a vice-president of the party, and was the only female member of the Dáil between September 1927 and February 1932.[2]\n\nShe was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for the Dublin North constituency at the 1923 general election.[4] Socially conversative, she voted in favour of the 1928 Censorship of Publications bill, which banned indecent literature and publications that referred to birth control; and she voted with the government in favour of the 1924 and 1927 juries bills, which restricted jury service for women.[2]\n\nShe was re-elected at each subsequent election until she lost her seat at the 1933 general election.[5]\n\nFamily\n\nShe married Patrick O'Driscoll on 8 September 1901 at Rosscarbery's Roman Catholic chapel in County Cork. The couple had 14 children: five sons and nine daughters.[2]\n\nActress Dervla Kirwan is a great-granddaughter of the O'Driscolls.[6]"
