        "meta_description": "ROCKPORT - William 'Brian' Hewat, 72, died peacefully at home on January 6, 2009. Born in Noranda, Quebec, Brian lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick in his early years where he came to his love of the ocean and coastal areas.  He moved to London, Ontario as a teenager and graduated from the University of Western Ontario Engineering School's first graduating class.   Upon graduation, he joined Bell Canada where he spent most of his career, being promoted to the level of executive vice-president.  He became president of Stentor (a consortium of Canadian telephone companies) and then joined Bell-Northern Research, Nortel's research and development arm, as CEO.   He retired to the coast in Rockport, Maine.  His zeal for excellence, his passion for travel, his love of projects and his enjoyment of family and friends (with a drink if it was cocktail hour) are among the things that inspired his family and they will be greatly miss.  Brian is survived by his wife, Kay of Rockport; his sons and their wives, Chris (Dale) and Tim (Mary-Jo) all of Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Kay's daughters and their husbands, Meegan (Rob) of Guelph Ontario, Canada, Shannon of Newbury Port, Massachusetts; and his grandchildren Andrew, Michael, Geoffrey, Ryan, Shawn, Aimee, Jenna, Lauren, Eric and Ethan.   Donations in Brian's memory may be made to Kno-Wal-Lin Hospice Program, 170 Pleasant Street, Rockland, Maine 04841. At the request of the family, services will be private.   Arrangements are in the care of Burpee, Carpenter & Hutchins Funeral Home, 110 Limerock Street, Rockland.  To sign Brian's online guestbook, please visit www.bchfh.com",
