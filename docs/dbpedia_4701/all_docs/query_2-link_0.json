        "text": "PhD DLit Lond FRSNZ\n\nWilliam Hewat McLeod was born in 1932 in Fielding. He grew up on his parents’ farm, learning to do most of the jobs that farm boys do, and later attended Nelson College. Here he became captain of the Rutherford House First XV and Head Boy. Next he proceeded to Knox College and the University of Otago where he became close friends with several men who went on to become Professors and Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He majored in History without causing anyone to suspect that he would become the Department’s most distinguished graduate, and then entered Theological Hall to commence his training for ordination as a Presbyterian Minister. Here Helmut Rex, a distinguished church historian and a refugee from Nazi Germany, introduced him to the German historiographical tradition. Before his ordination he married Margaret Wylie, an English graduate and a fellow member of the Student Christian Movement. She became his stalwart supporter and confidante.\n\nIn his memoir, he remarked that as the prospect of life in a New Zealand parish drew closer so his unease grew. And then, providentially, a vacancy opened for a missionary in India. Margaret agreed. He applied. Nobody else did. And so it came to pass that Hew, Margaret and their new baby set off for the Punjab, Hew devouring anything he could find about their destination. Teaching English to Punjabis did not prove very satisfying and before long he began to read whatever he could find about these people, the Sikhs, and their religion, Sikhism. He also decided to learn their language. After five years in the field, missionaries were required to take a year off and study. Hew wrote to the author of his favourite book on India, Professor A. L. Basham of the School of African and Oriental Studies – part of the University of London - asking whether he would supervise his PhD. Basham said yes. The McLeods - there were now three sons - moved to London and Hew began to apply the principles of hermeneutics learned in Knox Theological Hall to the Sikh religious texts and the life of Guru Nanak. ‘The results’, as he later recalled, 'were dramatic'. What could be established beyond doubt about Nanak could be written on less than one page.\n\nOn Hew’s graduation the McLeods returned to India where Hew obtained a job teaching Punjabis their own history in Punjabi. Here he (and Margaret) discovered that they had lost their faith. ‘It was our Damascus Road in reverse.’ In 1986 The Clarendon Press also published his revised thesis, Guru Nanak and the Sikh Religion. In 1970 he was appointed to the History Department at the University of Otago and arrived to teach his first class in 1971. Although promoted to a personal chair within two years, he would not teach his specialty until 1989.\n\nSikh Studies now became an extremely important element of Hew’s life. And Hew was absolutely fundamental in shaping Sikh Studies. Hew himself, of course, would never have said that. He always saw himself as a scholar who posed questions and as an historian who could offer tentative answers to those questions: his work was always careful and judicious. Hew’s writing was humble, but it was revolutionary too. It transformed the academic study of Sikhism and it reshaped how many Sikhs think about their own past.\n\nGuru Nanak and the Sikh Religion (1968, rev. edn. 1976) formed the taproot for all of his later work on the Sikh tradition and community. This book evaluated the historical value of the janam-sakhis, popular narratives that recounted the life of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak and embodied the highest standards of philological analysis and the contextualised evaluation of sources. But this approach angered some Sikhs who were critical of what they understood as a direct challenge to authenticity of their traditions. The Evolution of the Sikh Community, first published in Delhi by Oxford University Press in 1975 then by The Clarendon Press in 1976, provided by far the fullest and most scholarly account of the formation of a community that was as important to South Asia as the Jews had been to Europe, or so he used to say. His scholarly work focused on two areas: first, the texts that were central to the Sikh tradition, including four important translations (together with scholarly notes, appendices, and an introductory essay); and second, the broader issue of the relationship between history, religion, society and Sikh identity. Two works proved especially significant: The Sikhs: history, religion, and society, published by Columbia University Press in New York, 1989, and Who is a Sikh? The problem of Sikh identity, published by The Clarendon Press, Oxford, also in 1989 (also published in the same year by Oxford University Press, New Delhi, followed by a paperback edition from the same publisher in 2002).\n\nHe was never confined by his major interests, however. In 1986 Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, published Punjabis in New Zealand: A history of Punjabi migration, 1890−1940, at that point the only scholarly study of migration to New Zealand by any ethnic group. His rigorous use of the best social science method distinguished this work, just as his use of the best hermeneutical practice distinguished much of his other work. (He also collaborated with S.S. Bhullar to publish Punjab to Aotearoa: migration and settlement of Punjabis in New Zealand 1890−1990.)\n\nWhile on sabbatical leave on a Commonwealth Scholarship from the University of Toronto, Hew for the first time had an extended opportunity to travel and meet North America’s community of Sikh scholars. He relished them as much as they relished him. He taught three courses in his specialty while at Toronto – although this was not required – and undertook an ambitious lecture tour of several of the greatest universities in the United States. Early in 1987, while in New York to give a lecture at Columbia, Hew suffered a major stroke. (He had ‘a dissecting aneurysm in … [his] left carotid artery’.) His sheer determination, together with the dedication of close friends and his wife and oldest son, who was working in Paris, ensured his survival.\n\n‘That stroke turned my life upside down …’, he later wrote. It also forged from the friendships that they had made in North America a tight circle of very close friends. Back in Toronto he began doing jigsaw puzzles, throwing balls, eating grapes one by one, and walking. The University of Otago gave him leave from teaching to recuperate and he used it to bring to completion three manuscripts. To his great relief he found that in writing his abilities were unimpaired.\n\nBeing Hew, he also soon set out to teach himself to talk and lecture. Realising that he could no longer improvise a lecture, he settled down to write each lecture out in full. For his senior classes, with his wife Margaret’s help, he worked out new ways of teaching that involved the students undertaking more. It was more difficult with staff meetings or even staff jollifications. Indeed it was impossible. When more than one person spoke at the same time he understood nothing. He also found it maddening beyond belief to launch into a sentence only to forget a key word and stand speechless.\n\nWhen in 1990 he was awarded a D Lit. by the University of London for his nine major books and 40-odd scholarly papers, the department put on a dinner in his honour. In my after-dinner speech I referred to his mastery of all the languages relevant to his work, his exhaustive archival research, his command of the relevant literature not only in History but in cognate disciplines, his skill as an oral historian and as textual critic, and his 'resolute wrestling with the relationship between belief, social structure and change over time'.\n\nAt this time we also set up his unique arrangement where he taught his Otago papers during the first two terms then left for Toronto where he taught two more undergraduate papers during their second semester. He did this for five years, accompanied and supported as ever by Margaret. He recalled in his autobiography: ‘This proved to be an unusually productive and satisfying arrangement’. His high profile in North America also brought unwelcome notoriety among some expatriate Sikhs. He became the subject of an on-going and sometimes unpleasant controversy. Ever courteous, however, he interrupted the renewed flow of scholarly publications, including dozens of contributions to encyclopaedias and anthologies, to write Discovering the Sikhs: autobiography of an historian (Delhi, Permanent Black, 2004).\n\nAs a historian, mentor, colleague and friend, Hew nourished the study of Sikhism. It was in this period that e-mail became widely used and Hew made full use of the new medium for maintaining contact with an ever-enlarging circle of Sikh scholars and students. With unfailing courtesy and promptness he gave as much thought and care to inquiries from people he had never met as he did to the inquiries from old friends and other scholars. His passing has been keenly felt within this global scholarly community. Tributes to Hew have been posted on various Sikh discussion lists and websites. And Punjabi newspapers and Sikh community newspapers have published substantial obituaries overnight, paying tribute to his scholarship and his humanity.\n\nOne learning of Hew’s death, Professor Jerry Barrier, one of the world’s pre-eminent scholars of the Sikhs, wrote:\n\nHew had a unique intelligence coupled with a commitment to history, finding the truth, and getting every piece of evidence, small and large, from documents. He pulled no punches when examining Sikh tradition, although characteristically, he frequently interjected phrases such as “it is possible” or “the evidence seems to suggest” so as to open up dialogue with others who might have different perspectives and use different documents.\n\nThe products of his work? A lifetime of unbroken scholarship: books, articles, and conference papers. His work ethic was legendary. Books and articles rolled out regularly, even as he struggled with illness.\n\nAs numerous associates note in their reflections on Hew’s life, he helped define Sikh studies. He also trained a new generation of scholars and taught many students who built upon their experiences to move in a variety of directions.\n\nAlthough Hew’s work was controversial, he demonstrated how to deal with arguments and still preserve one’s dignity and balance. A close friend in Canada, Sher Singh, has written eloquently about how Hew personified a central Sikh concept, sehaj, or equipoise, solemnity: “ not once, did I see him lose poise or his ability to smile—that lovely disarming smile of his—or his gentleness or his gentility, or his humanity. There was always grace about him.”\n\nHe changed the lives of scholars and friends around him. All have their Hew McLeod stories. We would send in papers, and almost immediately get detailed replies, queries, and supportive suggestions. I can think of no better example than the way Himadri Banerjee describes his relationship with Hew. Himadri never met Hew in person, but carried on an extensive correspondence for two decades. Himadri describes Hew as “my answering machine in the domain of Sikh studies.” Van Dusenbery also remembers how Hew encouraged Rashmere Bhatti and Van when they were working on a book about the Sikh community in Woolgoolga. Rashmere venerates Hew as a truly selfless Sewadar (one who gives service). Hew gave service to each one of us, and we all are better scholars and human beings because of that sharing and empathy.\n\nIn the last decade or so, Hew became central to the evolution of a new cyber community of scholars. He and I exchanged ideas and news almost daily. Others recount how Hew served as a “walking encyclopedia,” answering endless queries with supportive, gently corrective comments when necessary, and with a humourous edge. Writing from Calcutta, Himadri Banerjee sums up these connection well: “The world is big and isolating but for a few moments he could make us feel that we belong to a larger family.…For more than forty years, he has silently been constructing an invisible human bridge that keeps us together.”\n\nHew has gone, but his intellectual presence remains in his work, in his students, and in the bridges he constructed between people and between communities.\n\nBibliography\n\nBOOKS\n\nBooks published\n\nGuru Nanak and the Sikh Religion.
