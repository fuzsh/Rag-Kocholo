        "meta_description": "Philip Hewat-Jaboor: An Eye for the Magnificent will be offered at Christie’s headquarters in London on 8 February 2024. A highly-respected and passionate connoisseur, Phillip Hewat-Jaboor (1953-2022) was a revered art advisor and the chairman of Masterpiece Art Fair in London (2012-2022).\nComprising approximately 200 lots, this erudite collection, which celebrates the beauty of hardstones and prestigious provenances, spans decorative arts from Antiquity to the contemporary. Hewat-Jaboor had a particular passion for porphyry, evident in the large and notable group of porphyry objects in the sale, led by a pair of early 19th century Neoclassical porphyry vases. Other works of art reflect his deep admiration for, and affinity with, the legendary British patrons and collectors William Beckford (1760-1844) and Thomas Hope (1769-1831).\nThe full pre-sale exhibition will run from 3 to 7 February 2024.",
