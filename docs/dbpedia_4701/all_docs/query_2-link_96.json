Hewat-Jaboor had a particular passion for porphyry, evident in the large and notable group of porphyry objects in the sale, led by a pair of early 19th century Neoclassical porphyry vases. Other works of art reflect his deep admiration for, and affinity with, the legendary British patrons and collectors William Beckford (1760-1844) and Thomas Hope (1769-1831).\nThe full pre-sale exhibition will run from 3 to 7 February 2024.",
