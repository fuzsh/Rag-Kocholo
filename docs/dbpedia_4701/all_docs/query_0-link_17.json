An altercation between the constables and some members of the crowd resulted in two women being arrested and conveyed to Store street Police Station.\n\nBoth women are of the respectable working class and the action of the police was unfavourably commented on. The crowd made a hostile demonstration, and the police drew their revolvers to prevent any attempt being made to rescue the prisoners. The military motor lorry shortly before 3.20 pm left Findlater place and were then driven off amidst a storm of groans and hisses.\n\nMr William Findlater, managing director of the firm, declined to make any statement when approached by a Freemanâs Journal representative. He apparently knew nothing of the cause of the raid. Mr Findlater is well known in Dublin business circles. He is a Conservative with broadly tolerant views, but takes no active part in politics.\n\nThe Freemanâs Journal was baffled as to why Findlaters should have been raided in this way, and certainly did not approve. WHOSE TURN NEXT? ARMED RAIDS OF WELL-KNOWN DUBLIN BUSINESS HOUSES, ran its headlines, and the paper declared that â the latest stunt is not only a mystery, but is rapidly becoming to every citizen the gravest of menaces . . . the result is that when the rattle of a military lorry is heard after midnight, no man, however clear his conscience may be of offence against the Executive, can be sure that the next minute his door may not be smashed in by rifle butts and he himself dragged off to swell the list of victimsâ.2\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nThe Dublin Chamber and the Treaty\n\nLike many of his fellow businessmen, Willie took an active part at that time in the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. In the heated political atmosphere of the time, it was difficult for the Protestant voice to be raised in any but a few constituencies, so the Chamber of Commerce made a convenient arena. These were important times for the Chamber which national politicians used as a sounding board for moderate unionist opinion. In fact in 1921, Ãamon de Valera, having been invited to meet Prime Minister Lloyd George, sought âthe views of a certain section of our people of whom you are the representativesâ and on 4 July, in the Mansion House, met with Sir Robert Woods, Sir Maurice Dockrell, Andrew Jameson, Lord Midleton and Sir James Craig.\n\nDuring the Treaty negotiations in 1921Willie was a member of the Council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that urged Ãamon de Valera and Arthur Griffith to accept the Treaty in December 1921. He served on various committees, including Trade and Commerce, Law, Parliamentary, Municipal, House and Finance and Education. The secretary of the Irish Industrial Development Association summed up the views of the businessmen in the Chamber in the final paragraph of his excellent analysis of Irish trade and industry published in 1920:\n\nWe have in Ireland all the resources necessary to build up a thriving community: endless proof is available of the ability of Irishmen to cope successfully with economic problems; our workpeople are comparable with those of any other nation, both in regard to skill and intelligence; all that we lack to enable us to take our proper place among the prosperous nations of the world is the power to determine our own economic policy. Until that right is granted us it is unfair to place the blame for her present industrial condition at Irelandâs door.3\n\nOn 25 January 1922 it is recorded in their minutes that the Chamber had approved the following statement of its views on Condition 5 of the Treaty:\n\nBriefly stated, this condition offers Ireland complete control of finance and taxation, modified by the provision that free trade without any restrictions should be maintained in perpetuity between Great Britain and Ireland. There is no reason to doubt that Irish businessmen engaged in established industries or business, being able to hold their own, would depreciate any discrimination in their favour against British competition, or any measures calculated to interfere with the flow of trade between the two countries, but it is apparent that there are weighty reasons why Condition No 5 should not be accepted on behalf of Ireland.\n\nAn Irish Parliament, under this condition, would find it impossible to follow the example of the Parliament at Westminster in passing an act for safeguarding of new or struggling industries which might become a great national asset. Ireland would also be bound, in advance, to a British trade policy without regard to its adaptability to the circumstances or conditions of the country. This Council would urge that in view of the need for exhaustive and patient inquiry before the vast interests involved can be wisely dealt with, the framing of the commercial treaty between the two countries\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\nshould be postponed until a political settlement is reached, and that Condition No 5 should be eliminated from the conditions which it sought to impose as preliminary to the settlement.\n\nCondition 5 was omitted from the agreement subsequently reached by the conference in December.4 The Treaty that established the Irish Free State was signed by the British and Irish representatives on 6 December 1921, and ratified by DÃ¡il Ãireann a month later. The majority of Irish people ultimately confirmed it at the ballot box. However, the anti-Treaty faction, those that did not agree to the exclusion of six northern counties from Dublin jurisdiction, led by Ãamon de Valera, walked out on 10 January 1922.\n\nThe Dublin Chamber of Commerce had met on 30 December 1921, those present being Andrew Jameson (distilling)5, in the Chair; William Hewat (Heitons coal and steel); James Shanks (sanitary engineering); E. H. Andrews (tea, wine, spirit and provision merchants): Richard Booth (engineering works); Sir Maurice Dockrell (buildersâ providers and timber merchants); William Findlater; John Good (master builder); John Hollwey (ship broker); George Jacob (biscuit manufacturing); Patrick Leonard (sales master and auctioneer); S. W. Maddock (secretary Mount Jerome cemetery); Harry Millar* (wholesale tea, wine and spirit merchants) Laurence Martin (timber importers); Sir James Percy (publisher); William Wallace (coal distributors); John Wallis (carrier and steam packet agent) and Alderman J. Hubbard Clarke, High Sheriff for the City of Dublin. Apologies were received from David Barry (British & Irish Steam Packet Co.); William Crowe (timber, slate and tiles merchants); Sir W. J. Goulding Bart (fertilisers); W. Lombard Murphy MD, Sir Horace Plunkett and L. C. Cuffe (cattle salesmen and auctioneers).\n\nThe meeting was called to consider what action the Chamber should take in the present crisis. After a very full discussion it was decided that a resolution in favour of the ratification of the Peace Treaty should be passed by the Council, and published in the press on the following day. The Secretary was instructed to send copies to the press, de Valera, Arthur Griffith, and the Speaker of DÃ¡il Ãireann:\n\nThe Council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, realising the extreme gravity of the issues now awaiting decisions by the responsible representatives of the Irish People and the acute anxiety prevailing in the Country lest a conflict of opinion amongst the representatives may defeat the hopes of peace, cannot maintain silence in a situation so pregnant with danger to the vast interests of the whole community.\n\nThe Council also recognises its obligation to the great business community which looks to it for a frank and emphatic declaration to all concerned that a recurrence of the disastrous conditions which threatened to overturn the whole structure of the\n\n* Harry Millar was a director of the Bank of Ireland from 1923 and Governor 1930-1932; and first chairman of the Wine & Spirit Association. He played rugby for Ireland 1904-1905. Adam Millar & Co was founded by his grandfather Adam. Harryâs grandson David is a director of Findlater Wine Merchants.\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nCountryâs industry and trade would bring ruin to its prospect of National progress.\n\nThe Council therefore declares that rejection of the Peace Treaty, and a return to chaos and civil war with its untold miseries, as an alternative to acceptance is unthinkable.\n\nThe Council further records its opinion that the reconstruction of Ireland by her own people is made possible by the terms of the treaty, and most earnestly hopes that the body of Irishmen entrusted with its fate will secure its final ratification.6\n\nDisturbed times provide troubled waters for all sorts of predators. In January 1922, the Metropolitan Police Office handed a memo to the firm stating that: âthere are at present gangs of armed robbers operating in Dublin. They are well informed as to the habits and movements of their victims and are no doubt assisted in some cases by confederates in the employment of such victimsâ. The memo was particularly concerned with the transit of large sums of money. It advised that a certain number of employees should be armed and that the arms should be carried âon personâ ready for instant use; that an armed guard should be placed in position covering the interior of the building where he would not be observed by raiders and from where he could shoot in security; and that âa powerful electric alarm be fitted to sound outside the building which can be set in motion to ring continuously by the pressure of hand or foot, such as is now fitted to the Bank of Ireland and the Belfast Bank in College Greenâ.7 I very much doubt that Willie took the advice to arm any of his staff, either in head office or any of the branches.\n\nThe Civil War\n\nOn 13/14 April the anti-Treaty forces, the Irregulars, took over the Four Courts as their headquarters and refused to recognise the authority of the Provisional Government, headed by Michael Collins who held the legitimate seat of power. During the subsequent months the Irregulars raided private premises and the plundering of property became a frequent occurrence throughout the city. Oliver St J. Gogarty, surgeon, wit, writer and senator (1922-1936) wrote: âI could never countenance this euphemism, Irregulars. They were mostly town riffraff misled, or country dupes and discontents whom de Valera aroused when he found that his methods had landed him in a minority.â8\n\nOn 29 April 1922, a fortnight after anti-Treaty forces had seized the Four Courts, a meeting was called at short notice to consider the present dangerous condition of the country as it affects Trade and Commerce. It was resolved that the Chamber:\n\nrepresenting a large portion of the manufacturing and trading interests of Ireland, views with deep concern, the present want of security for life and property in our city and country. It calls upon all who are responsible for good government in Ireland to provide at the earliest possible moment such conditions of security and tranquillity as will permit of Irishmen living their lives in peace and quietness, and developing to the utmost the resources of their native landâ. The secretary was instructed to send copies to the Peace Conference at the Mansion House, the Provisional Government and DÃ¡il Ãireann.\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\nÃamon de Valera addressing a crowd outside Findlaters at the top of OâConnell Street, a customary place for political rallies (EMI-PathÃ©)\n\nThe kidnapping of Michael Collinsâ assistant chief of staff, Lieutenant-General OâConnell, by anti-Treaty forces was the signal for the civil war to hot up. On Tuesday 27 June 1922 the Provisional Government under Michael Collins issued the following public statement, which with its support for normal business and economic activity must have been welcome to the businessmen of the Chamber:\n\nSince the close of the General Election, at which the will of the people of Ireland was ascertained, further grave acts against the security of person and property have been committed in Dublin and in some other parts of Ireland by persons pretending to act with authority.\n\nIt is the duty of the Government, to which the people have entrusted their defence and the conduct of their affairs, to protect and secure all law-respecting citizens without distinction, and that duty the Government will resolutely perform.\n\nYesterday one of the principal garages in the metropolis was raided and plundered under the pretext of a Belfast boycott. No such boycott has any legal existence, and, if it had, it could not authorise or condone the action of irresponsible persons in seizing private property.\n\nLater in the same evening Lieutenant-General OâConnell, Assistant Chief of Staff, was seized by some of the persons responsible for the plundering of the garage, and is still held in their hands. Outrages such as these against the nation and the Government must cease at once, and cease forever.\n\nFor some months past all classes of business in Ireland have suffered severely through the feeling of insecurity engendered by reckless and wicked acts, which have tarnished the reputation of Ireland abroad.\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nUpper OâConnell Street after the Civil War (1922). Findlaters is behind the left hand lamp post. (Hogan)\n\nAs one disastrous consequence, unemployment and distress are prevalent in the country, at a time when, but for such acts, Ireland would be humming with prosperity.\n\nThe Government is determined that the country shall no longer be held up from the pursuit of its normal life and the re-establishment of its free national institutions. It calls, therefore, on the citizens to co-operate actively with it in the measures it is taking to ensure the public safety and to secure Ireland for the Irish people.9\n\nActions quickly followed words. Early on Wednesday morning, 28 June, parties of National (Government) troops were on the streets, stopping vehicles and pedestrians and searching them for arms. Snipers were also active in many parts of the city and several business premises and hotels were reported to have been seized and barricaded by the Irregulars. The business life of the city came to a standstill, shops and offices closed up, and, except for the bravely curious, the citizens beat a hasty retreat to their homes. Barricades were also erected across the main thoroughfares and strongly guarded by National troops, and pedestrians as they passed were subject to a careful search.\n\nThe Four Courts were shelled, and eventually blown up by the Irregulars inside. The fall of their headquarters, did not, however, mean that the final defeat of the Irregulars had come, for desperate fighting was at this time being waged in other parts of the city, principally in a wide area just north of Nelsonâs Pillar in OâConnell street.\n\nThe fighting continued on and off all day on Sunday 2 July. The official report issued on this evening stated: âNational forces are now carrying out a big concerted movement round the OâConnell Street area, which is the stronghold of the Irregulars. From early evening they are closing in and drawing a cordon round OâConnell Street, Marlborough Street, and Gardiner Street.â10\n\nA fresh attack on the occupied premises in OâConnell Street was launched on Monday afternoon, the heavy guns again being brought into play here. Further\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\nsuccesses quickly followed for the National arms, several of the remaining positions held by the Irregulars being captured, including the Gresham Hotel and the YMCA premises opposite, and it was officially reported that a large number of prisoners were secured, many of whom were trying to get away with their arms and ammunition.\n\nSome time about noon on Wednesday 5 July a fire broke out in the neighbourhood of the Hammam Hotel and another building. The firing continued with increased force, and amid the din the Fire Brigade, in charge of Captain Myers,* dashed up to subdue the outbreak, which by this time seemed to have involved the entire buildings. Soon after the arrival of the firemen the front walls of the Hammam collapsed with a loud crash, accompanied by blinding volumes of dense black smoke. Undaunted by the magnitude of its task, the Fire Brigade got to work strenuously, and its efforts were mainly directed to preventing the fire from spreading in a northern direction towards Findlaters where large quantities of over proof whiskey were stored in bond underground. A terrific explosion was next heard near the Gresham Hotel, and was followed by a deafening roar of machine guns. The Gresham Hotel was still standing, but later on it, too, became involved and was quickly a mass of flames. The white flag was displayed at 7.30 p.m. from the Granville Hotel and some twenty Irregulars marched out and surrendered.\n\nThus ended a week of terror and destruction that was equalled only by the Rising of Easter, 1916. The loss of lives in the case of the military totalled 19 dead and 122 wounded, and of civilians over 50 dead and 200 wounded.â The value of the destroyed property, which included some twenty of the finest buildings in the city, is estimated at Â£3m-Â£4m, while, besides the many ruined homes, the damage resulted in the disemployment of several hundred men and women.11 My father told me that the Pro-Cathedral and Findlaterâs bonded warehouse were the nearest buildings to Nelson Pillar that remained standing, thanks to the efficiency of the Dublin Fire Brigade. Willie Findlater on that occasion, it was reported, made a presentation to the Captain of the Fire Brigade as a tribute to the valour and the efficiency of his staff. However I was told that Grandfather swore under his breath that all the other traders got a new building and he did not!\n\nThe Findlater Minute Book entry of 28 June 1922 records: âOwing to the Disturbances, our premises in Sackville Street were closed from 30th June to 9th July and were partially burned. The opposing forces were in turn in occupation of the premises. Considerable looting was done at a number of our premises.â Findlaters put in a claim for compensation for losses occasioned by commandeering, looting, fire, loss of rents and trade to the Corporation amounting to Â£14,800 or more than Â£1/2m in modern terms,\n\nThe claim was of course long, and immensely detailed, and included:\n\n* Great-uncle of the celebrated Irish Times journalist.\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nEvery drop of wine was imported in cask and bottled and labelled by Findlaters.

They took possession of the entire hotel on 4 July 1922 and kept it till 27 October 1922.* Then the new Civic Guards (later called the Garda SiochÃ¡na) took over part of the premises and handed back the remainder. They remained in possession until 24 March 1923. During these occupations considerable damage was done to the premises and to the furniture. Our claim amounted to Â£1,235 4s 9d [â¬71,500]. The Board of Works said that they would only allow Â£487 0s 1d [â¬29,000]. There were seven pages of counselâs opinion. As to the main claim, Findlaterâs eventually settled for a mix of compensation, including the purchase by the corporation of various premises in Findlater Place permitting the creation of Cathal Brugha Street.Â Â Cathal Brugha was shot by Free State soldiers based in Findlaters buildings. (John Pinkman In the Legion of the Vanguard Cork: Mercier 2001 pp 127â142)\n\nNo doubt there was a certain amount of gamesmanship in putting in these claimsâfor instance, though it is true that gross profit reached 17.6 per cent in 1918, that figure was never repeated before or since. On the other hand there were incidents that could hardly be claimed for, as Johnny McDermott in Baggot Street branch remembered:\n\nIn the winter of 1923 there was a civil war on hereâthe Irregulars and the Free Staters. The Manager was up in an office and he was dead drunk. âGo down and see what all that commotion is about.â I ran down to the window and there were six guards outside with bicycles and they were after putting a brick through the Christmas window and they were loading turkeys and hams and everything into sacksâit was nothing but lootinâ and robbinâ. And I ran after this guard and I said: âThe Manager up here wants to know what all this thing is about.â He put his hand in his trench coat pocket, his green trench coat pocket and brought out a gun, held it up to my head.\n\n* Marie Lock told me her mother, Ellen Phelan, was housekeeper in the hotel for twelve years around this time. âWhen the Black and Tans used to force their way into the hotel she used to take their guns. She held strict morals in the hotel and placed a Sacred Heart picture on the stairway which was there for years after she left to get married.â\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\n1903: Note the wide spread of prices between âGood and Strongâ at the equivalent of Â£5.99 per lb and âPink Wrapperâ at Â£13.20 per lb.\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nâGo back, or Iâll blow your head off â. I was only a kid in short trousers and worn rubber shoes. I remember the Manager got fluthered that evening and he says at five to six: âGo and get me Silver, the cab man.â He stood up at Baggot Street Bridge, and Silver would be waitingâa white horse, a hard hat and a cab. When he seen me appearing and heâd be arising and heâd be down quick, quick, quick into the cellar to get his tumbler of whiskey. âAnd thatâs the Godâs truth.â\n\nThe civil war rumbled on for the whole of 1922, and into 1923. As late as 29 January 1923 Horace Plunkettâs house in Foxrock was burned by irregulars, in pursuit of a policy of harassing those appointed as Senators. On 31 January 1923 the Chamberâs report read:\n\nThe formidable attack on the Provisional Government, initiated earlier in the year, is maintained with unabated virulence, and its authors, to serve their manifest purpose, are leaving untried no device likely to embarrass commercial effort and enterprise. The effect of the frequent robberies under arms and illegal seizures of goods has been that, in many districts, trade is restricted within the narrowest limits . . . The Free State Government and Parliament established under a Constitution of their own framing have accepted a heavy obligation in the task of restoring order to a country sorely harassed. Their successful discharge of the task, in which they are now effecting progress, will nowhere be applauded more heartily than in the Chamber.\n\nLuckily for the country, the Civil War was now in its last stages, and on 24 May 1923 de Valera ordered his supporters to lay down their arms.\n\nManaging the bank manager\n\nDuring the troubled years 1921-1923 the average profit fell to Â£5,200 [under â¬318,000]. This trend was identical to that of Arnotts, the department store in Henry Street. From 1924 to 1939 Findlaterâs profits seesawed along, providing a good service, giving sound employment and keeping the shareholders modestly rewarded. The graph of Arnottâs sales for the period showed the same flat performance.\n\nThis moderate financial performance, admittedly in difficult circumstances, alerted the banks. On 4 January 1924 the Royal Bank wrote pointing out that the overdraft, which had been Â£5,000 in 1914, was now upwards of Â£50,000. The account had been in credit during 1917/18. (The consumer price index, having shot up from 100 in 1914 to over 200 in 1919, fell between 1925 and 1933 from 190 to 151 and only rose modestly to 178 by 1939.) It was noted that this large overdraft had been a temporary accommodation, and had not been repaid as agreed. Willie replied slightly evasively, aware that outside forces were pushing his requirements up rather than down. He pointed out that his sales in 1914 had been less than a quarter of his present turnover, and in fact his overdraft had been as high as Â£70,000 and had come down. He described trade credit as very tight, and duty payments as heavy; another factor he cited was the loss of trade caused by the destruction of part of the Sackville Street premises during the Troubles, for which he expected a âfair compensationâ within the month. Turning\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\non the charm, he thanked the directors and the bank officials for their consideration and courtesy, and sought an extension until the end of his financial year.\n\nThe bank replied ten days later, asking that the overdraft be reduced by Â£2,500 [â¬159,000] before I April, and by a further Â£2,500 a month thereafter. Willie agreed to abide by this schedule as far as possible, but noted that such a curtailment of the firmâs credit would seriously hinder the financing of the business and perhaps injure the firmâs earning power. In the event he did manage to hold the overdraft below Â£50,000, but it was not until 1942, in the middle of another war, that the account was in credit again.\n\nThe imposter\n\nIn 1919 the firm was alerted to the fact that a very well-presented gentleman was calling on various suppliers in London, claiming to be from âFindlater, of Dublinâ. He called for instance on Tom Smith & Co. Ltd., the world renowned Christmas cracker manufacturers, as they wrote:\n\nA tall, well-dressed gentleman, grey hairdo, with a grey moustache, called to our office at 9.20 a.m. this morning, giving the name of âFindlater, of Dublinâ, without presenting a card, and asked to look at our London Directory, which was readily handed over; he then asked if we had any Toffee to sell, and on seeing a sample in the Showroom, requested to take it away, but it was explained this would be no credit to us or him, as probably it was very stale, and not intended for tasting purposes, which seemed to upset the gentleman, who made out that we were very discourteous.\n\nMore understandably, at Benedictine he tried to get a free sample:\n\nHe requested that he might take away with him a bottle of Benedictine. This, owing to our Wholesale Licence, could not be supplied, and he accordingly went away without the bottle.\n\nAt Cinzano Ltd. he had more luck:\n\nHe certainly conveyed to us by his conversation and bearing, also his knowledge of the trade, that he was the senior of your firm. He said he had seen our wine advertised considerably and as he happened to be in London that day (the following day going to the Waddon Chase Hunt meeting) asked to taste our wine. He expressed his appreciation of the wine and we informed him that up to the present and as âCinzano, Brutâ Sparkling Wine had only been placed on the market such a short time, we had confined our sphere of activities to London and the big hotel concerns, but that we were anxious to send a traveller to Ireland or to make some arrangements by which we could be represented in that country. We must admit that he did not appear to have called in solely for a drink as by his method of tasting it was evident that he knew something about wine.\n\nPerhaps he just enjoyed the imposture, for he also called on Oxo, Heinz and Escoffier who sold a range of fine sauces.\n\nFindlaterâs of course issued a disclaimer, on 20 December 1919, which alerted our suppliers:\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nHaving just received letters from two London Firms reporting the call on them within the past few days of a gentleman giving the name âFindlater of Dublinâ (without presenting a card), we think common courtesy on our partânot to say common senseâdemands that we should write you a line of warning on the subject.\n\nThe individual in question is not known to us, and there certainly is no one in England at present authorised by us to use our name or obtain favours or personal attentions of any kind.\n\nEleven years later the mysterious imposter reappeared at Campbell Soups in London:\n\nThis man was in his late sixties or early seventies. His height was about five feet eight. He guessed my riding weight at eleven stone and said that he rode at ten stone, which would seem correct to me because he was the slender, athletic type. He was neatly dressed and wore a small but valuable fox headscarf pin, painted, under glass, which only a man thoroughly interested in hunting would affect. He mentioned by name, and I could see must have personally met, a number of Americans of my acquaintance who have hunted in Ireland. He also talked interestingly about the Masters and Packs in both England and Ireland when he found that I was interested. There was very little discussion about Campbellâs Soups except with the young man in the office of our Sales Agents, but he did say that his son expected to visit London shortly and he would give him the facts. There was no indication then or later of an ulterior object in his visit. He did not ask for money.\n\nWe never found out who the imposter wasâand the mystery remains unsolved.\n\nMemories of old Findlaters\n\nDespite his somewhat authoritarian appearance in later years, Willie was fondly remembered by Linda Browne, who was Dermotâs secretary for many years.* During the late 1930s Willie\n\nused to visit the OâConnell Street premises on a regular basis. He appeared to be a very strict and severe man on the surface, but when I got to know him better I found him kind and human. An example of this occurred one day when I was taking dictation from him. He asked me if I smoked. In trepidation I admitted that I did. Instead of telling me off, he turned around to his desk behind him and took a fistful of cigarettes from a box and gave them to me! [She added] In the basement of the shop was a staff cafe which was very good value. It needed to be with the very low wages paid!\n\nThe tradition of personal service was Findlaterâs hallmark, as Mary Kane of Blackrock recalled in the 1960s:\n\nMy mother-in-law arrived from Kerry, a widow with her three sons, one Saturday afternoon in 1922. She came down to the village to go to the bank beside Findlaters. It was closed of course after 3 pm. Mr Vaughan, Manager of Findlaters, was standing at\n\n* Linda Browne (nÃ©e Canning) wrote this on 23 September 1986.\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\n1910: Cakes were made fresh daily in our bakery in Thomas Street and this continued until the early 1950s.\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nthe door of the shop, saw her distress and asked if he could help. She told him her predicament and he said: âCome in, order what you want and I will have them sent right away.â She said: âBut you donât even know my name!â Mr Vaughan said: âI know that when the bank opens on Monday you will get your cheque book and money and will come in to me and open your account.â He had a very big smile on a very red faceâa big, kindly man.\n\nWhen I got married I also dealt there. When children arrived he could hardly wait till they sat up in the pram so that he could give them those bright pink biscuits. In those days tins were outside the mahogany counter. He was a very fair and just man, good humoured, but woe betide when orders went wrong or were late. Those responsible got the roar of his booming voice. There was such a day when I happened to be in the shop. You know, there was such a silence after he spoke. There was a large packet of matches on the counter, part of an order, and as it was the nearest thing to him he picked it up and slammed it down with such force it burst into flames. There was not a sound except the crackling of the matches as each box burst into flames. My small daughter thought she was at a party and gurgled away in her pram. That was the only human voice. Suddenly the door opened. In came a lady who sniffed and said in a high pitched voice: âSomething burning?â The shop came alive then. Everyone tried to look the other way!\n\nThose were very happy days. We thought that the big clock that was such a part of Blackrock would be left there, but no, it was taken away with every sign of the shop. I remember the overhead money rail that so delighted my children. Even to this day they tell their children about the man that used to give them biscuits.\n\nThere was tall Mr Long at the bacon counter and short Mr Long at the provisions. Those are the only names that I recall just now, but I must say that all the staff were always polite and courteous at all timesâno matter what size of order given. I am going back to June 1938 when I got married. Going down to Findlaters as a married woman twenty-one years of age, feeling so very important.\n\nMy family dealt with Mr Galloway in your Dalkey branch many years ago. I remember being sent down at the age of ten with a small basket on my arm and with a note for some butter or sugar which was weighed into brown paper bags.\n\nThe atmosphere and style of the shops remained much the same from the late 19th century to the 1950s.Â Rosalind Matthews of Killiney has happy memories of the Kingstown (DÃºn Laoghaire) shop in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nWe were a big family and money was always scarce. Every week I walked up to the central confectionery counter on my own, feeling very important, whilst my mother was elsewhere in the shop, and with my precious one penny pocket money I would buy a cream bun. That memory still gives me joy.\n\nMabel Hanlon, a dark haired beauty, worked at the fruit and veg. behind the confectionery counter, and every week she would slip me a banana, then an apple, when war made the former scarce. I loved Mabel but used to worry lest she would get the sack for stealing on my behalf. Bacon and dairy produce were all sold on the counter at the left hand side of the shop as you went in its central doors. I always felt very irri-\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\ntated with my mother as she never gave me enough time to get my fill of the slicer at work. I can still hear the âwhrr whrrâ noise it made, going forwards and backwards at every cut.\n\nBut best by far was the butter lady. I used to wish she would run out of supplies and have to open a new box for my maximum pleasure! The butter rested on cold marble. Then with her ridged wooden pats taken from the water jug she would lop off lumps and cleverly carry each between the pats and place them on the scales until the required weight was reachedâor exceeded. This on/off job was fascinating. When the desired poundage was reached, she would slap-bang it repeatedly into a respectable shape. There was no doubt in my mind: I was going to be a butter lady when I grew up!\n\nThe counter that I least liked was the groceries (tea, sugar etc.) on the right. This was very dull and seemed without action, apart from weighing. Here was where my mother spent the most time every Thursday, placing her order. She would sit on the high stool provided for customers and the assistant seemed just too grovellyââYes Mrs Hanaghanâ, âCertainly Mrs Hanaghanâ, âWhichever you like, Mrs Hanaghanâ. He had no time for me! But once the boring order was written in his book and the carbon paper moved under the next free pageâthen came the climax. Always I told her to give more money than was needed so the assistant would both load and unload the cash, and I would watch the coin-box zoom overhead twice on its wire, up to and back from the raised cash desk at the back of the shop. Never once did your man offer me the chance to pull the leather starter strap! So what if food was a bit dearer in Findlaters? Wasnât it worth it, to see this wonderful contraption work? Good as the train set I never had.\n\nThe big Findlater clock was the heart of the town, as the Pillar was to the city. Kingstown then seemed full of deeply shrouded black-clad nuns, women in black shawls and barefoot children running on the cold, wet, wintry pavements. I still regard myself privileged to be fortunate enough to have always had shoes on my feet! My mother was a great manager of money. She would separate her cash each week into little piles and place them on the mantelpiece: so much for the bread man, milkman, cobbler and so on.\n\nBut the story doesnât quite end there. For next day came the horse drawn delivery. Far more exciting than a motorised van. Mind you, Findlaters didnât keep the horse and bridle etc. in such good nick as the coalmen did. But I can still see the writing on the cart. Part of the fun was watching the horse to see would his bodily functions take place. These both disgusted and fascinated me at one and the same time. But the driver was no fun, unlike the bread man, he never gave us a ride. Anyway, his cart seat wasnât half as high as J. M. & OâB!*\n\nOf course the view from the inside was different, as Johnny McDermott, who started as a delivery boy, told my sister Suzanne:\n\nI used to collect a few orders from Northumberland Road, in between even as a messenger boy â¦ The German Consulate, 58 Northumberland Road, the Argentine\n\n*Johnston Mooney and OâBrienâs bread-vans.\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE\n\nConsulate at 54 Northumberland Road and an alcoholic lady in No. 50âtragic about her. A Miss Nugent in No. 62, a magnificent houseâtwo or three maids and all that. But the alcoholic ladyâa quart of whiskey every second day (a broken romance, I believe). She had a separate wine account. Her father used to be at the window watching. I used to have to go down and to try and sneak the quart to the cookâthe cook was âin the knowâ tooâand 50 Gold Flake every day. Then maybe for a few weeks she would change onto bottles of sherryâtwo or three bottles a dayâAlfino.\n\nThis particular morning I had the basket full, that height, and I struggled out. Mr Edmund Mitchell came up the floor, a big tall manâhe was in the First World War, he was a major, he was a director. Anyway, I was nearly killed lifting the basket. âPut down that basketâ, he says. âTake out all that stuff â. He had seen the quart of whiskey in it for a startâit was on the top. âTake all them parcels out,â he says. âTake everything out on the floor.â I remember he put on glasses, looked at everything, seen everything invoiced. âPut them back now,â he says. So, I put them backâI had to. The basket was very, very heavy. âThatâs a bit heavy for you,â he says. Your dad walked over to the counter. âSomebody up there give this lad a help with the basket.â Your dad was only just coming into the firm then.\n\nWilliams, the Manager, was a slave driver. He was there to make the branch pay and, by God, he did. But he says to me, âYouâre going out on the road nowâ, and he brings down an old bicycle from where he lived with double handlebars and all, an old antique, and he gives it to me. I was too small to ride it, it was too high, and I used to have to stand on the pedals, but he sent me out. And I thought, thatâs handy, there were only about a dozen accounts to call on. My mother (we were very poor) got a provident cheque from Sloanâs of Parliament Street and got me a suit of long trousers and a pair of shoes to make me look respectable calling on houses. I was out for about four months and Williams comes down to meâI was afraid of my life of himâand he says âDo you ever look for new custom?â Oh, he was a slave driver, but he trained me well. I looked at him in amazement because Iâd no experience, you see. âI want you to get new business. Get it around.â I was desperate for business. I called at a Dr Jackson at 8 Upper Fitzwilliam Street and the receptionist there says to me, âYes, I can get you a couple of orders if you give me a kiss.â I was so innocent. I didnât know what she was talking aboutâthatâs the Godâs truth. So, to cut a long story short, she got me Pringle and OâGrady and Fegan. I never looked back. I started canvassing like nobodyâs business. Whenever I seen furniture arriving I went into the house.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I got so much money that I got married on my Christmas boxes. I canvassed the Holy Faith Convent who used to buy cases of oranges, a couple of hams, cases of apples, 1/2 dozen milk fed chickens, maybe a couple of hensâall at retail price. The nuns used to have a cook, Molly was her name, and wanted a nice box of chocolates. The nuns didnât look for anything. A van load of stuff used to go down. Iâd a job getting a big box of chocolates out of Williams. It should have been a wholesale order instead of retail. I canvassed St Andrewâs Collegeâretail. It should have been a wholesale order, 30 lbs of sausages at a time. Then Gateaux Swiss Rollsâ we became the agents for that. Two dozen Swiss Rolls at the weekend, a cwt of sugar.\n\nThen a fellah on the provision counter after the war couldnât sell all the rough ends\n\nNext page\n\nFINDLATERS\n\nof bacon. He was on to me about the bacon. At that time it was only nice pieces of bacon and ham people were looking forânot the rough ends, the collar, the jowls and all that. He had me pestered so much that I got cracking. I seen the matron of the Molyneux Home for the Blind first. That was a retail order that should have been a wholesale one. There was only one wholesale order that I canvassed and that was Baggot Street Hospital. But that was not the only wholesale order we had. Now, St Andrewâs College, St Conlethâs College, Church House, Holy Faith, Molyneux Home for the Blind. I used to call there once a week for a van load of stuff and I got an order for the rough bacon that they used to buy. St Andrewâs College was the same, 1/2 cwt rough bacon. At times the stock was enormous. One of the clerks of the office came to me and said âthere is a letter of congratulations about the business on the provisions counterâmarvellous percentage on the stock.â I was getting retail prices which should have been wholesale.\n\nThen Williams went back on the ledgers over the years, bad accounts. And heâd have a list every evening. âI want you to go out and get some of that money back.â Some of the accounts were due in from the early 20s. I cleared a heck of a lot. You see, I was afraid of him. âNow, what money did you get in this evening?â Iâd have my receipt book with me you see. We kept expanding, expanding, expanding and I got out to Stillorgan Road then. Hume Dudgeon of Merville, Walshâs of Belfield, OâToole of Oldtown House, Stephenson of Cranford, University College, Cranford where all the luxury offices are now. I got them all. We had three horse vans. That was the secret of it you seeâthe deliveries.\n\nIâd be out at half eight or quarter past eight in the morning, over across Baggot Street Bridge. The cook, thereâd be a cook and maybe two maids and maybe a receptionist and all where the doctors had their waiting rooms, and theyâd be delighted when Iâd get over their lists âcos theyâd have their orders over for lunch. At that time Iâd be back at the shop at maybe half past nine in the morning with a book of orders and Micky McDonald would be waiting in the back. Orders that I collected the day before were delivered to Stillorgan that morning. A big box of potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, carrotsâthe whole lot.\n\nAlthough the atmosphere of the business was much the same as it had been when he started so many years before, there were of course changes, some of which Willie remembered during the speech he gave while celebrating his silver jubilee as Managing Director.\n\nDuring my time with the Firm eight more branches were opened. Personally I trust that we wonât open too many more for some time as I would never like the Firm to get into the position of what is called âChain Storesâ. We ought to be satisfied with what we are doing and to improve on this. But, of course, nobody can tell what is for us in the future.\n\nOf course a great number of changes have taken place in my time. Perhaps the chief one is the employment of girls. It was quite an event when, many years ago, two girls were employed by my brother, Mr Adam as he was called, to attend behind the confectionery counter. Now I think we have more girls than boys, and they have bright\n\nNext page\n\nGRANDFATHER WILLIE AND THE NEW STATE"
