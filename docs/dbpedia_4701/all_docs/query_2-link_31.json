        "text": "Description Information left by visiting researchers and volunteers re. the life and descendants of Col. William Hewat (1792-1884).\n\nBorn in Scotland, William Hewat enlisted with the 62nd Regiment of Foot in 1811, and soon after saw battle in Palermo. He was sent with his regiment to Halifax during the War of 1812, then returned to England. He retired from the Army in 1817.\n\nIn 1820 he wed Isabella Henderson (died 1826), and married Helen Cunningham in 1834. With the latter, he emigrated to Guelph in 1834 and settled on Speedbank Farm (later known as Vimy Ridge Farm). In 1849 he wed his third wife Mary Elizabeth Moore (died 1861). Col. Hewat had many children.\n\nHe served as Wellington District and County treasurer for over twenty-five years from 1841-1868. He was a Conservative, and involved with the administration of St. George's Anglican Church in Guelph.\n\nWilliam's brother John Hewat lived with him and his family in Guelph."
