The lower house of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament), Dáil Éireann, contains 166 Teachta Dála (TDs), representing 43 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Republic of Ireland. Depending on its size, each constituency must have at least 3 members. The most recent (Census 2011) ratio indicates that there is one TD for every 27,640 people. Elections are held using the single transferable vote form of proportional representation.

Changes for next general election[]

In June 2012, the Constituency Commission proposed changes to the constituency map of Ireland so as to reduce the total number of TDs from 166 to 158. The Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2013 provided for this change and for changes to constituencies.
