        "text": "OTTAWA - Paul Martin, respected as a deficit-chopping finance minister, succeeded Jean Chretien as prime minister Friday and immediately created an expansive new national security agency intended to help mend Canadian-U.S. ties that frayed under Chretien.\n\nMartin said he would chair a new committee devoted to assessing and improving relations with the United States. He expects to confer by phone with President Bush on Monday and meet one-on-one with him at a regional summit in Mexico next month.\n\nMartin, 65, took the oath of office in fluent French and English in a nationally televised ceremony at the offices of Canada's governor-general. Beforehand, an Indian elder dusted Martin with an eagle feather in a purification rite; afterward, a children's choir sang \"O Canada.\"\n\nChretien, beloved by most Canadians but at odds with the Bush administration over Iraq and other issues, stepped down in a private ceremony an hour earlier after 10 years as prime minister and 40 years in politics. Raised in a Quebec mill town, the 18th of 19th children, he was one of the longest-serving government leaders among major Western nations.\n\nThough Martin won plaudits for eliminating a budget deficit during nine years as Chretien's finance minister, the two men were uneasy rivals within the dominant Liberal Party. When Chretien announced his retirement plans earlier this year, Martin won an overwhelming victory as the Liberals' new leader and joined in pressuring Chretien to step down two months earlier than he intended.\n\nMartin is expected to call national elections this spring, and will be heavily favored to defeat any opposition candidate.\n\n\"I look forward to the opportunity to rally Canadians toward a new sense of national purpose and around a new agenda of change and achievement,\" Martin said. \"We are going to change the way things work in Ottawa in order to re-engage Canadians in the political process.\"\n\nMartin named 22 new ministers to the 38-member Cabinet, and only five of the 16 holdovers - including Foreign Minister Bill Graham - kept their portfolios.\n\nThe new finance minister is Ralph Goodale, who had been Chretien's public works minister, while Anne McLellan, who had been health minister, was named deputy prime minister and put in charge of the new national security department.\n\nThe department - geared to cope with terrorism and disasters - will group together the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national intelligence service, disaster response agencies, and the agencies overseeing border control and ports. McLellan said her department will play an important role in Canada-U.S. relations, noting both countries want their long common border to be secure but also convenient for trade and travel.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, said the Bush administration looked forward to \"establishing very quickly the kind of solid working relationships with members of the new government that we've always enjoyed with our friends in Canada.\"\n\nOverall, the United States and Canada remain unusually close culturally and economically. But trade disputes flare repeatedly in specific sectors, and Canada's refusal to contribute troops to topple Saddam Hussein prompted the Pentagon to include Canada on a list of countries barred from obtaining major rebuilding contracts in Iraq.\n\nChretien, throughout his political career, was a dogged opponent of the separatist movement in his native Quebec. Martin, though born in Ontario, also is well-known in the French-speaking province - he represents a Montreal district in Parliament.\n\nGoodale is from Saskatchewan and McLellan from Alberta, suggesting Martin hopes to shore up the Liberals' standing in the West, its weakest region. But neither Goodale nor McLellan are fluent in French, which some Quebeckers may view as a slight.\n\nAt his news conference, Martin listed three overarching priorities for his government: reinforcing the universal health care system, education and other major social programs; revitalizing the economy with creation of good jobs; and enhancing Canada's international role with diplomatic, trade and defense initiatives.\n\nIn an unmistakable swipe at the Chretien era, Martin also said he hoped to restore the public's trust in government by toughening ethics standards for his Cabinet ministers and encouraging more free thinking by Liberal Party members of Parliament. Chretien's government was dogged by a series of ethical tangles, and he was often criticized for insisting Liberal lawmakers follow the party line on most votes.\n\nIncluded on the new Cabinet's agenda, Martin said, was a pending proposal to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide in accordance with recent court rulings. Martin said he favored eliminating any form of discrimination against gays, but he also said religious faiths should be free to \"interpret marriage as they see fit.\"\n\nIn an emotional moment, Martin fought back tears as he told reporters he arrived for his swearing-in ceremony carrying the folded Maple Leaf flag that flew at half-staff on Parliament Hill when his father, Liberal politician Paul Martin Sr., died in 1992."
