        "text": "Crest\n\nBlazon\n\nIssuant from flames Or a phoenix wings elevated and addorsed Azure beaked and crested Gules holding in its beak an open scroll proper;\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe phoenix, a mythical animal that rises from its ashes, embodies Mr. Chrétien’s perseverance and the many achievements of his career. The scroll symbolizes the Constitution of Canada and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, two pillars of the Canadian political system at the heart of Mr. Chrétien’s achievements as Minister of Justice. It also represents his love of reading and of history.\n\nSupporters\n\nBlazon\n\nTwo polar bears proper each charged on the shoulder with a Latin cross pendent from each crossbeam two balance pans Gules, standing on a rocky mount proper set with maple leaves Gules and fleurs-de-lis Azure and issuant from barry-wavy Argent and Azure;\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe polar bears refer to Mr. Chrétien’s service as Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and to his fondness for pieces of artwork depicting this majestic animal. The balances on their shoulders allude to Mr. Chrétien’s career as a lawyer and as Minister of Justice. They are suspended from crosses, which represent his Catholic faith and provide a canting reference to his surname, which means “Christian” in French. The maple leaves refer to Canada and his French-Canadian identity, and the fleurs-de-lis to his French origins. The waves refer to the Saint-Maurice River located in Mr. Chrétien’s hometown of Shawinigan"
