        "text": "Jean Chretien has announced his resignation as prime minister, although not until February 2004. The 18-month delay is a clear attempt to sabotage his long-time rival Paul Martin, the former finance minister and heir apparent.\n\nThey are both members of the governing Liberal party, but the two men cannot stand each other. Their venomous personal rivalry has dominated Canadian politics for a decade. It began when Mr Chretien defeated Mr Martin for the leadership in 1990. The final chapter of the drama will not be played out until the Liberals vote for a new leader and prime minister in 2004.\n\nMr Martin savoured an important victory last week, when he forced Mr Chretien to announce he would step aside. His formidable forces within the Liberal party were prepared to oust the prime minister in a leadership review that was to begin this autumn. If all had gone according to plan, Mr Chretien would have been out of a job by February.\n\nBut the prime minister gave Mr Martin a swift kick up the backside on his way out of the door. Mr Martin may be the frontrunner, but the 18-month delay gives his rivals a chance to raise money and put their campaign teams together.\n\nAge is Mr Martin's biggest vulnerability. He turns 64 this month, which means he will be older than 65 when Liberals vote for a new leader. Mr Chretien will be 70 when he quits, and the party may well have tired of being led by a senior citizen, and ready for a generational shift.\n\nMr Martin has seen it happen before. In 1968, his father, Paul Martin Sr was the frontrunner to replace the Liberal prime minister Lester Pearson. But then a young, charismatic and little-known politician named Pierre Trudeau caught the imagination of the party, and the career of Paul Martin Sr was over.\n\nCan Paul Martin Jr, who is looking increasingly grey and paunchy, hang on to his substantial lead? He appears confident he can do so. While some of his supporters were demanding that the prime minister leave earlier, he said he had no problem with waiting until February 2004.\n\nTo have forced the issue would have looked churlish, and many Liberals, although dissatisfied with Mr Chretien, were not comfortable with the idea of humiliating the man who had won them three majority governments.\n\nOn a personal level, it is too bad that Mr Chretien allowed his rivalry with Mr Martin to define his final years in office. He could have gone out a winner. The economy is in good shape and Quebec separatists have been vanquished, at least for now. Instead, he mused about running for a fourth term and forced the showdown with Mr Martin, who left the cabinet this spring.\n\nIt is hard for outsiders to understand why Mr Chretien so despises Mr Martin. They worked together for nine years in a very successful political partnership. They are both MPs from Quebec, the predominately French-speaking province that has tried to separate from the rest of the country twice.\n\nQuebec is key to their bitter relationship. Mr Martin has supported plans to offer the province more autonomy, and in the leadership race of 1990, he mocked Mr Chretien for being out of touch with the aspirations of his fellow Quebeckers.\n\nMr Chretien, who is seen in his home province as a sell-out to the English, never forgave those taunts. In addition, he fears that if Mr Martin becomes prime minister, he will be soft on Quebec nationalists, and weaken the Canadian federation by giving in to their demands for more control over their own affairs.\n\nBeing forced to resign was obviously a personal defeat for the prime minister. But in deferring his departure, he may be able to achieve what has become his most important political goal: to stop Paul Martin from replacing him."
