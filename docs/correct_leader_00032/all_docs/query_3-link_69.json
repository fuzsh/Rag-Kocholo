        "text": "In this video, former Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien, discusses the liberal party's impact on Canada. He talks about how he was elected in 1963 and there was no Medicare, Canada Pension Plan, flag, national anthem, charter or rights, or no official languages. \"It is the Liberal party that did all that for Canadians,\" he said to wide applause.\n\nA steadfast statesman and a riveting orator, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien gives a rousing presentation from the perspective of one of the most influential and most beloved world leaders in modern history. Born in Quebec, Canada, the son of a paper mill machinist, he knew he was destined to lead. Trained as a lawyer and serving as Canada’s 20th prime minister, he made his mark as a legislator and raised his country’s presence on the world stage."
