        "text": "♪ >> Valerie: Welcome to Canada Files .\n\nI'm Valerie Pringle.\n\nMy guest today is the Right Honourable Jean Chrétien.\n\nMr. Chrétien spent 40 years in the House of Commons.\n\nTen as prime minister from 1993 - 2003.\n\nHe was born in Quebec, the 18th of 19 children.\n\nAnd retained the image of the little guy from Shawinigan throughout his very long and successful political career.\n\nHe turned 90 this year and is still rated the most popular former prime minister of Canada.\n\n>> Valerie: Mr. Chrétien, hello.\n\n>> Jean: Hello.\n\n>> You always had this persona- the little guy from Shawinigan.\n\nThe ordinary guy.\n\nBut as you look at your career and all your achievements, you're anything but ordinary.\n\n>> I don't know.\n\nBut in life, it's always better to under-sell and over-perform.\n\nI always wanted to be the guy close to the people, go along with them and move up!\n\nIt's what apparently I've done.\n\nWas a very interesting life I had and very lucky.\n\nBut I was there when the luck came to me.\n\n>> Well, 40 years undefeated in politics.\n\nPolitics is hard and longevity is something you can't plan.\n\nWhat do you think made you such a successful politician?\n\n>> Hard work and luck.\n\nYou know you have to be working hard, be there all the time.\n\nBecause if you're not there, the luck will bypass you.\n\n...I enjoyed public life.\n\nYou know, I wanted to be a politician.\n\nMy father wanted me to be a politician.\n\n>> So was it his choice?\n\n>> Yes, I wanted to be an architect.\n\nHe said to me, \"No, no.\n\nYou will never be elected as an architect You go to the law school.\"\n\nAnd in those days, when Papa said something, we listened.\n\nSo I went to the law school and he got his politician.\n\n>> Well, go back a little bit because you're self-described as a really terrible kid.\n\nHyperactive, undisciplined... expelled from school.\n\nWhat turned you around?\n\n>> Mom used to say there's always a black sheep in the family.\n\nJean will be the one.\n\nBut Dad realized I was hyperactive.\n\nAnd...he loved to have a politician in the family so he started to train me.\n\n>> Well, did you have any dreams then, in terms of political aspirations?\n\nCan I be prime minister... >> No no.\n\nThat was not for me.\n\nI wanted to be a politician to please Dad.\n\nAfter that, I wanted to be a minister.\n\nI thought that the job of prime minister was not to be accessible to me.\n\nBecause you know when I became a member of Parliament at 29 in 1963, I could not speak good English.\n\nI had problems with the language.\n\nSo I never thought that a guy who does not speak perfect English at 29 could be prime minister of Canada.\n\nI kept my French accent but you know I managed to go to the top.\n\n>> You did.\n\nOne of the first things you did-- and it's sort of interesting, I'd forgotten.\n\nYou did a private member's bill right away.\n\nTo change the name of Air Canada >> ...from Trans-Canada Airways.\n\n>> Yes, first time I was in the news.\n\nAnd the arguments were quite simple, I would say.\n\nThere were 3 TCAs: Trans-Canada, Trans Caribbean, Transcontinental.\n\nTCA is at the bottom of the list.\n\nAir Canada will be at the top of the list.\n\nAnd because Air Canada and it so happened to be bilingual at the same time.\n\nThe day after, I received a beautiful letter from Prime Minister Pearson.\n\nThat was my first...goal in the net of politics.\n\n>> I was looking, remembering in 1980, Trudeau made you Minister of Justice, Attorney General of Canada, the minister responsible for the referendum on separatism that was taking place in Quebec.\n\nThe repatriation of the Constitution from Great Britain.\n\nThe creation of the Charter of Rights and Minister of Social Programs.\n\nHonestly, an impossible task!\n\n>> You know, I didn't want to take that job.\n\n>> No kidding!\n\n>> No.\n\nI said I don't want to do that.\n\nBut he said it's where I need you, Jean.\n\nAnd it was very turbulent in Quebec and I was afraid of that.\n\nWe were both sitting at 24 Sussex over the river and the sunset on Quebec and he said it was beautiful.\n\nHe said, \"Home is burning ...and I need you.\"\n\nSo I said okay, give me the hose.\n\nThat was the beginning of all these tasks.\n\n>> The referendum was one thing--the no vote prevailed.\n\nMeaning Quebec would stay in Canada and won.\n\nSo that was one thing to deal with.\n\nBut the patriation of the Constitution was so complicated.\n\n>> It was a big task because we wanted to have a Charter of Rights.\n\nThe provincial governments were not keen to have a national Charter of Rights.\n\nSo I had to convince them all.\n\nThey participated and we managed to do that.\n\nOf course, when we finished the consultation, both Quebec and Manitoba refused.\n\nBut Manitoba signed a week later.\n\nAnd that is Quebec but it was normal.\n\nBecause Claude Charron was one of the ministers that was a kind of very pleasant chap.\n\nI told him.\n\nHe said, \"Jean, don't expect us to sign on a new Canadian Constitution.\n\nWe are separatists.\n\nWe want to get out of Canada.\n\nSo we will never sign on a new Canadian Constitution.\"\n\nSo I knew it was impossible to have them.\n\nBut my thought was perhaps there would be enough pressure for them to collapse.\n\nBut in fact, they did not collapse.\n\nThey said no.\n\n>> They said no and have never signed.\n\n>> But it's not the same... even in Germany.\n\nDo you know that in Germany, Bavaria never signed the German Constitution?\n\nNot the same...and Germany is working quite well anyway.\n\nThe people in Bavaria claim that they are Germans.\n\n>> But when you became prime minister, 1993, what you were dealt at that time was a lot of really bad problems.\n\nThe economy was terrible.\n\nOnce again, the Quebec separatists were saying we're moving toward a referendum and we'd really like to separate this time.\n\nThose were the issues you were dealing with.\n\nBut the economy you took on.\n\nYou had a $43 billion deficit.\n\n>> I don't remember.\n\nIt was more than that.\n\nYou know, the deficit was 6.2% of the GDP and the debt was 72%.\n\nYou know, the Financial Times said we were a good candidate to be a third-world nation.\n\nWe knew unemployment was 11%.\n\nInflation, compared to today, was at 11%.\n\nIt was not a very pretty picture.\n\nSo we took it over.\n\nI said to the Cabinet, \"I will fix that.\n\nWe might be in government for only one term but I will fix it\" >> But every government says oh well, we've got debts and we'll get rid of the deficit.\n\nYou got rid of the deficit.\n\nOther people were coming to you for advice on how you did it.\n\n>> They found a reason not to do it.\n\nThere's tons of reasons not to do it.\n\nBut I said I would do it.\n\nAnd I was determined to do it.\n\n>> The other really tough thing earlier on--1995, was the Quebec Referendum.\n\nThat you had to deal with-- the second one.\n\nWhich was so close and so hard.\n\nYou were saying I don't want to be the last prime minister of Canada.\n\n>> It was that worrisome.\n\n>> In a way, yes because I had to make it serious.\n\nAnd in a way, no.\n\nBecause if we had lost the referendum, it was not the end of it.\n\nBecause the question was completely crooked.\n\nThere would have been a lot of problems to resolve, if they wanted to resolve.\n\nThey could not have said we're independent.\n\nLook what happened in Spain.\n\nThey proclaimed independence, that went nowhere.\n\nAnd many other places.\n\n...there is some consequences after the vote.\n\nWe knew and I knew that every day, I'd ask a clear question, do you want to separate?\n\nThey would have had no more than 24% of the vote.\n\nSo I could have called myself, a referendum with a clear question.\n\nSo solve the question in the future, I passed the Clarity Act.\n\nWhere I put the condition that would lead to a negotiation.\n\nNow they will be obliged to ask a clear question.\n\nWe permitted the referendum but... before the first and second referendum, we never expected that they would ask some crooked question like that.\n\nNow they cannot do it anymore.\n\n>> For your third term, there was controversy about whether you would stay.\n\nYou said you wouldn't.\n\nThere were people who were supporting Paul Martin.\n\nYou decided to stay.\n\nAnd it really was your most productive time.\n\nHow was that you ended up coming back for a third term and accomplishing many things?\n\n>> I didn't want to be there more than two terms at the beginning.\n\nFor one good reason is-- I'd had enough of public life and I wanted to get out and make a bit of money.\n\nBecause I'd been a public servant all my life.\n\nYou know, my daughter was well married but I had other kids.\n\nAnd I had not provided-- I thought I could be able to provide something for them if I were to go and work outside of government.\n\nAnd everybody was asking me to promise to run a third time and I said no.\n\nI said I promised my wife that I will be out.\n\nAnd I would not be there in 2001 for the election.\n\nAline got up, moved out, closed and re-opened the door, just half of her body in the room and she shout, \"Four more years!\"\n\nSo she got a standing ovation by all including myself.\n\nSo I decided to run a third time.\n\nIt was, in fact, the best!\n\nBecause I knew it was the last one.\n\n>> You were prime minister during 911.\n\nWhich required you to make some tense decisions, about aircraft and planes landing.\n\nTrying to figure out what was going on.\n\n>> Yes, it was a very dramatic day.\n\nBut we had to make a quick decision.\n\nThere was planes over the Atlantic.\n\nThe Americans had decided they would not let one plane land in America.\n\nSo the minister of transport was informed and he talked with his deputy and clerk.\n\nHe decided, with my concurrence, to permit the planes to land.\n\nHe had made, and we made, the right decision as Canadians.\n\nAnd they landed all over the place.\n\nI was very moved when I went to New York >> ...to see the play there.\n\n>> \"Come from Away\".\n\n>> I was there with the mayor of Gander.\n\n>> From Newfoundland.\n\n>> ... after that, you know, I had to reassure the people.\n\nThat was a very dramatic moment.\n\nThe people were scared!\n\n>> I think one of the things you're best known for is saying no to going to Iraq.\n\nGreat pressure from America, from the United Kingdom.\n\nIt was to find the weapons of mass destruction and get rid of Sadam Hussein.\n\nYou stood up, even to people in Canada, to just about everybody and said no, we're not going.\n\n>> Oh no...George talked to me and Tony Blair even more.\n\nGeorge Bush was using the argument that Sadam had weapon of mass destruction.\n\nI had said to them I'm not convinced, with the reports I have.\n\nBut these reports, if you want to find in them one conclusion, sometimes you find the path.\n\nBut I was not convinced.\n\nI tell them, I said, \"Hey if you don't have better proof, you have to have a resolution of the UN and you won't have it.\"\n\nHe didn't have it.\n\nTony Blair had said to me, \"Jean, we have to get rid of Sadam Hussein because he's a terrible dictator.\"\n\nBut I said if we're in the business of replacing the dictators we don't like, why don't we work in South Africa?\n\nWhy don't we fix the problem with Zimbabwe--Mugabe, you know?\n\nHe has been there quite a long time and they were kind of happy if he were to move.\n\n...but we don't do that.\n\nBut he said, \"Jean, Mugabe and Sadam it's not the same.\"\n\nI said of course, it's not the same-- Mugabe has no oil.\n\nHe became white and he did not... we have kind of a frozen period after that.\n\nBut I like him very much.\n\nI think he was quite good.\n\nI don't like the way he has been treated after that in Great Britain-- he did not deserve it.\n\n>> Was that the greatest example of leadership on your part?\n\n>> It was a decision.\n\nYou have to make a decision.\n\nWas it tough?\n\nYes and no.\n\nI was not convinced they had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI was not happy with the reason they were going to go there.\n\nWhen you make a decision, you make it.\n\nPressure--I lived with pressure all my life.\n\nYou have to look at the problem.\n\nYou know for me, it was--I was absolutely not convinced that they had a good reason.\n\nIt turned out that I was right.\n\n>> I want to ask you about a few people that you've worked with and known.\n\nJust to get your impressions or stories--Nelson Mandela.\n\n>> He was the greatest personality I ever met.\n\nWas such...I remember the first night I met him.\n\nRight here in the Chateau, having dinner with his new wife.\n\nAline and I.\n\n...we were moved.\n\nWe were hesitant.\n\nWe were meeting in what in my mind was the most courageous political person I ever met.\n\nWho kept a great sense of humour.\n\nHe forgave all the people who kept him in jail for 27 years.\n\nYou know, when I named him Honourary Citizen of Canada, when I quit, he sent me a message.\n\nHe said, \"I am really unhappy because I would not have the occasion to vote for you.\"\n\nHe was the impressive political person I ever met.\n\n>> Queen Elizabeth--you spent many times with the Queen.\n\nElizabeth, who bestowed on you the Order of Merit.\n\nI think you were the fourth Canadian ever to get it.\n\n>> Yes, the last in 50 years.\n\nShe...you know, my humour was helping.\n\nAnd she loved speaking French with me.\n\nShe was speaking good French.\n\nWhen she could talk with Aline and I, she was practising her French, and the Queen Mother even more.\n\nSo it was a different relation, in that way.\n\nI made the joke, \"Why, people said, she was speaking French with me?\"\n\nI would say because she could not stand my French accent.\n\nBut it was not that.\n\nShe was a very nice person.\n\nAnd she liked to have a good laugh once in awhile.\n\n>> Many people would say that was one of your great gifts, a great skill-- your sense of humour.\n\n>> It is extremely useful because the truth dry is difficult to swallow.\n\nBut with humour, it is the sugar around it that helps digest it easier.\n\n>> Couple more--Bill Clinton obviously.\n\n>> He was a good friend, Bill Clinton.\n\nHe was the president when I became prime minister, for a few months.\n\nAnd we worked quite well together.\n\nBecause we are what we call moderate.\n\nI say that I am the radical centre.\n\nBecause you know Liberal is a very unusual name.\n\nIn Europe, a liberal is rather to the right.\n\nIn US, a liberal is very much to the left.\n\nSo he asked me what is a Liberal in Canada.\n\nI say, in Canada a Liberal is, when the people on the left say you are...a right-winger and when the people on the right say you are a left-winger.\n\nYou are a good Canadian Liberal Chrétien.\n\n>> So we worked well together.\n\n>> Golfed well together.\n\n>> Oh yes.\n\nYou know he comes every summer in Canada for his birthday.\n\nI'm invited and play golf with him.\n\nHe comes with some of his political friends.\n\nLouise Penny, a great friend of Hillary Clinton, and I were the only two Canadians there.\n\n>> George W. Bush.\n\nHow was your relationship with him?\n\n>> Because you said no to Iraq.\n\n>> ...the press wanted me to have bad relations with him.\n\nI had good relations with him.\n\nHe was not complicated.\n\nBill Clinton always wanted to convince you.\n\nGeorge--you will say white, he will say black, it was fine.\n\nWe agree to disagree.\n\nLet's talk baseball and football.\n\nIt was relaxing.\n\nHe was always on time and pleasant.\n\n>> Tell me about Aline, your wonderful wife who you lost, just a couple of years ago.\n\nYou always called her your Rock of Gibraltar throughout life.\n\n>> But you know we met, she was 16 and I was 18-- next-door girl.\n\nShe was my first girlfriend.\n\nI was in boarding school and I went to university.\n\nWe would write letters, 3 - 4 times a week.\n\nYou know, we'd been married 62 years-- we were together 68.\n\nShe went in a quiet way, as she was.\n\nBut she was very strong.\n\nShe was telling me the truth but in a nice way.\n\nWe never had any argument--never had a tough period in our wedding.\n\nWe were very lucky.\n\nWe were genuinely in love for all that period.\n\nAnd I missed her enormously but what can I do?\n\n>> Are you proud of what you accomplished?\n\n>> You know, I'm grateful to my mom and dad.\n\nWho gave me the desire to be successful.\n\nMy mom was a fantastic lady, having 19 kids.\n\nBut she was very strong on education.\n\nAnd as I was--she thought I was to be a big problem, so she took care of me better.\n\nPerhaps more attention than the others.\n\nSo to keep me out of trouble and so on.\n\nAnd Dad gave me the desire to be a politician.\n\nYou know, from up there, they must be not unhappy for what they thought, both of them, that I was to be the black sheep of the family.\n\n>> What does being Canadian mean to you?\n\n>> For me, we're a very lucky country.\n\nWe're rich and very diversified.\n\nWe don't have racial problems-- we have problems like any country.\n\nBut we don't have big ghettos or the same animosity that exists in other countries.\n\nWe have some people who feel that they don't have what they should get.\n\nAnd it is normal, sometimes it's true.\n\nWe always try to meet these gaps--you know it's difficult.\n\nBut we're a democracy that functions well.\n\nWe can change government without any problems.\n\nWe have very little-- we don't have any political violence.\n\nAnd...we're an example!\n\n>> But you've always been such a...such pride.\n\nSuch a cheerleader for Canada.\n\n>> But it is part of leadership.\n\nWhat is a leader?\n\nIt's to inspire people.\n\nFor me, when people feel good, they go and buy a car, take a vacation, buy something for the kids.\n\nThey go and have dinner outside.\n\nIf they are depressed and think everything..the sky is falling, they do nothing!\n\nSo I thought that my job was yes, to be the cheerleader.\n\nLet's go!\n\nCanada is the best.\n\nYou remember that was the end of my speech.\n\nVive le Canada!\n\nAnd so on, because I always felt that...leadership is that.\n\nLeadership is to inspire and motivate the people.\n\nTo challenge them.\n\nThat was what I was trying to do all the time.\n\n>> Well, it's a pleasure to see you.\n\n>> And thank you so much for your time.\n\n>> My pleasure.\n\n>> And thank you for all you've done.\n\n>> I did my job the best I could.\n\n>> We'll be back next week with another episode of Canada Files .\n\n♪ ♪"
