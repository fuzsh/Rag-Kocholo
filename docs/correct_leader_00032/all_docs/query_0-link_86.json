        "text": "March 2, 1998, Monday\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK--Prime Minister Jean Chretien today received, on behalf of Canada, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Award during a ceremony at the United Nations. This international award honours Canada's achievements in improving opportunities for people with disabilities.\n\n\"Canadians understand the importance of enabling people with disabilities to take a full part in our society and our economy,\" said the Prime Minister. \"I am proud that this award recognizes Canada's progress in working with Canadians with disabilities so they can work, learn and reap all the benefits this country offers.\"\n\n\"Canadians should be pleased to receive this award. It should encourage us to realize that much work remains to be done,\" added the Prime Minister.\n\nNEWS RELEASE TRANSMITTED BY CANADIAN CORPORATE NEWS\n\nCanada was chosen for this award by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, based on advice from international experts on disability issues. The award includes a prize of $50,000 (U.S.). The Prime Minister turned the cheque over to the National Educational Association of Disabled Students (NEADS) to fund a mentorship program. It will enable 25 college and university students with disabilities to get work experience with employers that will help them launch successful careers.\n\n\"On behalf of NEADS, I thank the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute and the Government of Canada for the donation. This money will go a long way in helping students with disabilities,\" said Kent Hehr, president of NEADS and a law student at the University of Calgary.\n\nCanada was successfully nominated for this award by the Resource, Education and Advocacy Centre for the Handicapped (REACH), an Ottawa-based organization that addresses disability issues, particularly legal and social ones. Canadian achievements that helped to earn this award include protection for people with disabilities in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That was the first constitutional guarantee of its kind in the world.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nTHE FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT INTERNATIONAL DISABILITY AWARD\n\nCanada is only the second country to receive the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award (FDR Award) since the program began in 1995. South Korea was the first.\n\nEach FDR Award recognizes a country that has made important strides toward the full and equal participation of persons with disabilities in the life of its society.\n\nCanada was selected for this award by trustees of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute (FERI). Their choice of Canada was based on advice from the World Committee on Disability, an international non-governmental organization that promotes the United Nations World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons, and other advisors who are knowledgeable about disability issues internationally.\n\nThe FDR award consists of a bronze bust of Franklin Roosevelt created by a leading American artist, Jo Davidson, and $50,000 (US) that is bestowed on an outstanding non-governmental disability organization or program in the country being honoured.\n\nThe Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute created this award as part of its mission to inform new generations about the ideals and achievements of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. It strives to inspire people to apply the Roosevelts' spirit of optimism and innovation to today's challenges.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt is considered among the greatest of American Presidents. He was elected President four times, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945 . He led his country through the Great Depression and the Second World War. He became paraplegic after contracting polio when he was 39.\n\nFERI launched the FDR Award on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations to honour both President Roosevelt as a leading figure in the creation of the UN, and as a person with a disability. It helps bring awareness to the work of the UN on behalf of the half billion people around the world with disabilities.\n\nThe co-chairpersons of FERI are Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Trude Lash. William vanden Heuvel, former American ambassador to the United Nations, is the President.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nCANADA'S NOMINATION FOR THE FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT INTERNATIONAL DISABILITY AWARD\n\nCanada was nominated for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award by the Resource, Education and Advocacy Centre for the Handicapped (REACH).\n\nREACH was founded in 1981 during the International Year of Disabled Persons. It focuses on supporting the legal rights of persons with disabilities and exploring the legal and social aspects of issues that are important to the disability community. REACH is headquartered in Ottawa and operates in many communities in Eastern Ontario.\n\nREACH nominated Canada for this award because of initiatives since 1981 that have \"brought new meaning to the concepts of integration and life with dignity for people with disabilities,\" as the nominating letter states.\n\nThe nomination specifically notes:\n\n* The active role of persons with disabilities and their more than 2,000 community-based organizations in expanding full participation in Canada's society and economy;\n\n* Partnerships that have emerged between persons with disabilities and their advocacy networks with business leaders, unions and governments and other sectors of Canadian society;\n\n* Initiatives that have expanded participation in the labour market, education and throughout the social and economic fabric of communities;\n\n* Achievements of integration, such as the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria where the athletic village and competitions were fully accessible and integrated, and people with disabilities played active roles as volunteers, officials and service providers to make the Games a success;\n\n* Individual efforts such as the Rick Hansen Man-in-Motion tour that both raised international awareness of the potential of persons with disabilities and has generated more than $100 million to support projects that reduce barriers.\n\nAll of these activities are in addition to Government of Canada initiatives and Canada's international record on disability issues that are listed in separate backgrounders.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nCANADIANS WITH DISABILITIES\n\nPopulation\n\n* In 1991, 15.5 percent of Canadians (or 4.2 million) reported some level of disability.\n\n* There are 2.3 million adults aged 15 to 64 with disabilities, which represents 13 percent of the total Canadian working age population.\n\n* Disability rates increase regularly with age, from 7 percent of children under age of 14 to 50 percent of those over age 65. As the Canadian population ages, the prevalence of disabilities among the population will rise.\n\nEducation\n\n* Today, the majority of children with disabilities (91 percent) attend school.\n\n* In spite of the fact that they are still more likely to have stopped their education with primary school and less likely to attend university than the non-disabled Canadians, in the 1990s persons with disabilities do complete secondary and post-secondary education in the same proportion as their non-disabled counterparts.\n\n* However they are at a disadvantage because of their disabilities: even with the same level of education, they are 20 percent less likely to be employed than those with no disability.\n\nLabour Force Participation\n\n* The employment rate for persons with disabilities increased from 40 percent to 48 percent between 1986 and 1991. The total labour force participation rate (including all those employed and unemployed) went from 48.5 percent to 56.3 percent within those five years.\n\n* More than a third of this increased participation is likely due to the overall higher levels of education attained by working age persons with disabilities during the same period.\n\n* The greatest challenge for persons with disabilities appears to be getting a job. Contrary to what some may believe, the vast majority of persons with disabilities who work do so on a full-time basis.\n\nThe challenge: getting a job\n\n* A large portion of working age adults with disabilities (43.7 percent or 1,004,630) are not in the labour force. Women with disabilities are more likely not to be in the labour force than men with disabilities.\n\n* There is a will to be included: it appears that 30.8 percent of persons with disabilities who were out of the paid labour force had a positive response to at least one of the five indicators of future work potential (doing volunteer work; students; intend to look for work in the next six months; had looked for work without success; had been turned down because of their disability).\n\nThe need for accommodation\n\n* A number of factors determine whether or not people with disabilities can work. Their lower participation rate has more to do with the lack of supports and appropriate training, the availability of jobs and the accessibility of the workplace rather than with their own capacity to work.\n\n* The reasons for not joining the labour force most often cited by people with disabilities are: losing their current income (21 percent); problems with training (16 percent); no jobs available (15 percent); fear they would lose additional supports (13 percent); family responsibilities (10 percent); discrimination (7 percent); and lack of accessible transportation (7 percent).\n\n* The accessibility of the workplace largely determines whether or not people with disabilities can work. The three accommodations most often identified by people with disabilities not in the labour force as required for them to work are: modified or reduced hours (33 percent); job redesign (27 percent); and accessible transportation (14 percent).\n\nIncome\n\n* About one third of people with disabilities aged 15 to 64 receive disability-related income: but half of them have employment earnings:\n\nemployment earnings: 50 percent\n\nsocial assistance: 19 percent\n\npension income: 17 percent\n\nunemployment benefits: 11 percent\n\nworkers compensation: 8 percent\n\n* People with disabilities, particularly women with disabilities, are concentrated at the bottom end of the income scale: 54 percent of people with disabilities of working age earn less than $ 15,000 a year.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA'S RECORD ON DISABILITY ISSUES\n\n1980s\n\nThe International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981 was a catalyst in launching close federal government cooperation with Canada's disability community and with the voluntary sector on disability issues. Since then we have shared a common commitment to achieve full access to social and economic opportunities for persons with disabilities as a matter of citizenship.\n\nFederal actions during this decade worked to increase the economic and social participation of Canadians with disabilities in the lives of their communities.\n\n* The inclusion of physical and mental disability under Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982 marked the first time that any national Constitution in the world referred specifically to persons with disabilities. This has become an internationally-respected model because it framed disability as a citizenship and human rights issue. It has led to a much greater understanding that equalizing participation adds to the strength and cohesiveness of our societies.\n\nOther highlights included:\n\n* The addition of physical and mental disability as prohibited ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1985;\n\n* 1987 establishment of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons, a permanent body that consults with people with disabilities and makes recommendations to Parliament;\n\n* Employment equity programs that encouraged federally-regulated employers to break down barriers to employment for Canadians with disabilities;\n\n* Efforts to improve accessibility in federally-regulated transportation services such as airlines and railways;\n\n* Financial support for homeowners, landlords and others to make buildings accessible to people with mobility disabilities;\n\n* Creation of what is now the Office for Disability Issues in Human Resources Development Canada as a focal point for federal disability action.\n\n1990s\n\nDuring the 1990s, our government has acted on many of the priorities of Canadians with disabilities in areas such as employment, health, taxation and social development. We have drawn on our strong partnerships with disability organizations, persons with disabilities and the voluntary sector to help set and act on these agendas.\n\nThe Conference of Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers of Social Services initiated the Mainstream 1992 review of the federal-provincial/territorial programs for people with disabilities in consultation with the disability community.\n\nIn 1992, the Government of Canada tabled an omnibus bill to address areas such as access to the electoral system, access to information in alternative formats, acquiring citizenship, and testifying in criminal court.\n\nA ground-breaking multi-year project was undertaken with the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council to stimulate research in the area of disability.\n\nThe National Strategy for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities\n\nThis initiative supported hundreds of projects that improved access to housing, transportation, education and communications between 1991 and 1996. For example, the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs and Health Canada worked with First Nations communities to improve access to health and other services by First Nations persons with disabilities.\n\nImproved Integration at Work and in Transportation\n\nIn recent years, federal departments and agencies have continued to act on priority issues such as opening doors to employment and ensuring more accessible transportation services.\n\n* In the past, it was difficult for people receiving Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits to return to the workforce without jeopardizing their supports. This has changed - people can now receive benefits for three months after returning to work. They can volunteer or attend school without fear of losing benefits. Vocational rehabilitation is starting to help more people return to work.\n\n* Canadians with disabilities still find getting from place to place a challenge. However, our Canadian Transportation Agency has worked with persons with disabilities and the transportation industry to improve access to air, rail and ferry transportation through new regulations and voluntary codes.\n\nThe Task Force on Disability Issues\n\nIn 1996, our federal government realized the need for an up-to-date agenda for action on disability issues. That led to the creation of the Task Force on Disability Issues. Four Members of Parliament and three Observers from the disability community began their work in May 1996, consulting Canadians from coast to coast. Their goal was to identify workable federal priorities.\n\n* In October 1996, the Task Force released its report, Equal Citizenship for Canadians with Disabilities: The Will to Act. Action on the Task Force recommendations will bring persons with disabilities closer to full participation in society and the economy. They have already resulted in some important changes and are a blueprint for further action.\n\n1997 and 1998 Federal Budgets\n\nOur 1997 and 1998 federal budgets drew on the findings of the Task Force.\n\n$70 million in tax measures including:\n\n* An expanded medical expense tax credit to help cover costs such as adapted vehicles, moving to accessible housing, sign language interpreter fees, and attendant care.\n\n* A refundable medical expenses supplement for an estimated 280,000 low-income Canadians.\n\n$30 million for our new Opportunities Fund.\n\n* To help between 4,000 and 6,000 Canadians with disabilities find and keep jobs through projects that help improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities.\n\n$12 million to support organizations of Canadians with disabilities including:\n\n* A new Community Inclusion Fund that supports projects to improve integration of persons with intellectual disabilities into their communities.\n\n* Increased tax support in education, housing and employment initiatives.\n\nWorking with Our Partners\n\nMany departments are following up on the Task Force recommendations:\n\n* Our government and our provincial and territorial government partners are working out details of the Employability Assistance for Persons with Disabilities initiative. The new initiative will emphasize improved employability. It will track and report on the outcomes of our activity such as the numbers of persons with disabilities who find and keep work.\n\n* The Minister of Human Resources Development is working with his provincial and territorial colleagues to develop a common vision for all governments to pursue on disability issues. This vision will set out a common approach on four themes: citizenship; income support; employability; and the costs of disability.\n\n* The Minister of Justice tabled amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act in October 1997. These will improve access to the justice system for Canadians with disabilities and introduce a duty to accommodate employees with disabilities for federally regulated employers.\n\n* Canadian businesses and disability organizations have developed world-leading devices and services to meet the needs of persons with disabilities. Industry Canada helped these businesses form the world's first national industry association devoted to assistive devices. It has also created a Ministers Advisory Committee on Assistive Devices.\n\n* One of the most important tax documents for Canadians with disabilities is the Revenue Canada Disability Tax Credit Certificate (T2201). This form establishes the eligibility of individuals for the many tax deductions and credits related to the costs of disability. Revenue Canada worked closely with the disability community to revise the T2201.\n\n* Western Economic Diversification Canada's Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Program is improving access to business services and financial assistance for business people with disabilities in Western Canada and those considering self-employment.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nPARTNERSHIP FOR PARTICIPATION\n\n* The needs of persons with disabilities are multi-faceted and transcend the borders of any single government or agency. Federal, provincial and territorial governments, First Nations, non-governmental organizations and the private sector deliver the current system of benefits and services supporting Canadians with disabilities.\n\n* All partners share an understanding that Canadians with disabilities have a right to equal citizenship. All are working to create more opportunities for full participation for persons with disabilities.\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\n* In 1981, the Government of Canada undertook a comprehensive review of the status of persons with disabilities in Canada. This review led to the modernization of policies and programs, amendments to legislations and the introduction of a clause in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms preventing discrimination based on physical or mental disability. These actions opened the door to equal opportunity and full participation of persons with disabilities.\n\nProvincial and territorial governments\n\n* Provincial and territorial governments have made a dedicated effort to improve the quality of life of Canadians with disabilities. They are directly involved in setting policies and delivering programs and services to persons with disabilities -- health, social services, transportation, building code, education, and training. Governments continue their collaborative work to improve programs and services for persons with disabilities and to promote their inclusion in mainstream programs.\n\nVoluntary sector\n\n* The voluntary sector has been instrumental in identifying, addressing and partnering with the private and public sector on disability issues. They promote independent living for persons with disabilities and direct involvement of persons with disabilities in decision making on policies, programs and initiatives that impact on their daily lives.\n\nFirst Ministers\n\n* In June 1996, First Ministers adopted a new collaborative approach to strengthen and modernize Canada's social union and identified persons with disabilities as a national priority. In December 1997, they reaffirmed their commitment to persons with disabilities and directed Social Services Ministers to \"bring to a conclusion the development of a vision statement and framework to guide future collaborative work in this area.\"\n\n* During the past year, governments have been working together to articulate a vision that seeks to ensure the full participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of Canadian society. It recognizes that the achievement of this vision is a responsibility shared by all Canadians. While we have come a long way, this is a work in progress and one we recognize that must be accomplished together.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nCANADA'S INTERNATIONAL RECORD ON DISABILITY ISSUES\n\nCanada has played a leading international role on disability issues, particularly since 1981, the International Year of Disabled Persons. Many activities have helped the international community to take action. Others have supported specific projects.\n\n* Canada worked with other countries in the United Nations to initiate the World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons in 1982. The World Programme promoted the prevention of disability, rehabilitation, full participation and equality in all UN member countries.\n\n* Canada was an architect of the UN Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. These are internationally accepted benchmarks for government action to protect people with disabilities and enable their participation in society.\n\n* In 1992, Canada hosted Independence '92, an international congress on disability, and the Third World Congress of Disabled People International. These brought together more than 3,000 delegates from over 120 countries to discuss progress to date and ideas to enhance participation further.\n\n* Later that year, Canada hosted the first International Conference of Ministers Responsible for the Status of Persons with Disabilities. It brought together 75 government ministers to discuss issues and opportunities for cooperation.\n\n* Canada has ensured that disability issues are integrated into other international priorities. For example, at the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, Canada ensured that disability was recognized as an additional barrier to equality for many women, requiring attention in any action plans.\n\n* Canadian disability organizations were important contributors to the recent successful campaign for a global ban on anti-personnel land mines.\n\n* Canadian disability advocacy groups are working with partners in many countries to exchange information on achievements, challenges and best practices that can increase the participation of persons with disabilities.\n\n* The Canadian International Development Agency has supported many projects that link Canadian disability organizations with partners in developing countries.\n\n* The Canadian Association for Community Living was part of the January 1998 Team Canada mission to Latin America. They and similar organizations are working to meet a growing international demand for policy expertise, products and services that improve accessibility, integration and participation.\n\nBACKGROUNDER\n\nNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DISABLED STUDENTS\n\nThe Government of Canada is designating the National Educational Association of Disabled Students (NEADS) as the recipient organization of the $50,000 (U.S.) prize from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Award. These funds will be used to support a mentorship program that will place about 25 students with disabilities in workplaces across Canada. This work experience will assist participants to successfully launch their careers.\n\nThe National Educational Association of Disabled Students (NEADS) is Canada's national organization for students with disabilities. Founded in 1986, NEADS has a mandate to encourage self-empowerment for students with disabilities and is a strong advocate for accessibility in educational programs and institutions.\n\nNEADS services include the collection and distribution of authoritative information for students with disabilities. It has developed comprehensive listings of programs and services in Canadian post-secondary education, funding for students with disabilities and government-funded projects that help in the transition from school to work.\n\nThe Government of Canada has supported many NEADS projects. Human Resources Development Canada has helped to fund NEADS initiatives that assist young people with disabilities in making informed and empowered work and learning choices.\n\nThis focus on the working future for students with disabilities led to \"Investing In the Future: A Mentorship Program for Post-Secondary Students With Disabilities.\" With the advice of the NEADS Employer Advisory Council, this program will liaise with businesses to develop work experience placements and match them with qualified post-secondary students. Student participants will gain work experience, valuable insights into the labour market, and a wealth of contacts to draw on as they pursue jobs.\n\nNEADS is governed by a 12 member Board of Directors. It represents all provinces and territories and includes people living with a wide range of disabilities. NEADS has links to provincial affiliates and campus-based groups of students with disabilities. It is assisted by an Employer Advisory Council that includes approximately 25 national employers and community organizations. NEADS is a member of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities and works with the Canadian Federation of Students and other student organizations.\n\nPROFILE OF KENT HEHR - NEADS PRESIDENT\n\nMr. Kent Hehr, President of NEADS, is receiving on behalf of his organization the $50,000 (US) cheque from Prime Minister Jean Chretien.\n\nKent Hehr is a wheelchair user who has been President of NEADS and the Alberta representative on its Board of Directors since 1994.\n\nKent speaks with pride of the accomplishments of NEADS over the past two years. \"During this period NEADS has initiated many activities that will help improve the career chances and success of post-secondary students with disabilities.\"\n\nKent is a law student at the University of Calgary, where he is also social director for the Association of Awareness and Accessibility. He is a recipient of the University of Calgary Students' Union Presidential Citation for promoting disability issues on campus while completing his B.A. in Canadian Studies.\n\nBecause of his own experience with becoming disabled, he volunteers at the Calgary General Hospital.
