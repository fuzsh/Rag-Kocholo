        "text": "The speech electrified the thousands of people who had filled the Ottawa Civic Centre.\n\nHis supporters felt it had capped a come-from-behind campaign that would deliver him the leadership of the Liberal party when delegates voted the following day.\n\nThe party establishment, who had backed his rival, John Turner, from the start of the campaign were nervously wondering whether they had backed the wrong horse to succeed Pierre Trudeau.\n\nAs Jean Chrétien left the stage that evening the cheers were so loud he stopped at the end of the runway, turned around, and went back for a curtain call.\n\nStill, the audience cheered and, exiting the stage again, Chrétien stopped to get ready for another bow.\n\n\"Do you think you have it, Jean?\" a reporter called out.\n\n\"Yes, I think I have it,\" Chrétien replied, his gravelly voice even more strained with emotion.\n\nThat was June 1984 and it was one of the few times in a political career that spanned 40 years that Jean Chrétien's political instincts let him down.\n\nA public hanging\n\nIn fact, so rarely did that happen that on May 25, amid the usual jokes and digs, Chrétien's official portrait was unveiled on Parliament Hill, marking the 10 years he served as Canada's twentieth prime minister.\n\nLooking back, you might even say that even amidst the bitter disappointment of his second-ballot loss to Turner, Chrétien's luck was still holding fine.\n\nUnder Turner's awkward leadership, the Liberals were almost obliterated in that fall's election.\n\nChrétien might have run a better campaign than Turner. But it is unlikely that the long-serving Liberals would have hung on, or won in 1988 for that matter when free trade was the issue.\n\nIf he had been the one to fail then, instead of Turner, then his political career would have been over for sure.\n\nBut instinct and luck were two of the five pillars on which Chrétien's success was built.\n\nThe others were hard work, guts and a common touch that was helped by being smarter than he at first appeared.\n\nUnderestimated\n\nThe hard work was apparent from the start, when he won the Quebec riding of St. Maurice in 1963 in what was largely Creditiste country.\n\nThat hard work continued as he went to Ottawa, barely able to speak English, only to motor through a series of jobs in the Trudeau cabinet: At different times he was minister of finance, justice, energy, Indian and Northern Affairs, and trade and commerce, as well as president of the treasury board.\n\nBeing underestimated didn't hurt. Rivals in and out of the Liberal party often didn't take him seriously until it was too late.\n\nAnd the common touch, which was what often led him to be taken for granted, helped build a political base with ordinary party members and the Canadian public that would last a political lifetime.\n\nBut don't discount the guts. It took courage to be such a strong federalist in Quebec in the 1960s and '70s when so many of the province's politicians were flirting with or openly supporting the nationalist movement.\n\nAnd those kinds of guts were to show themselves throughout his career, whether teaching himself to speak English, dealing with attack ads, or passing the Clarity Act, which set the terms — and upped the stakes — for negotiating any possible secession.\n\nThe right place\n\nBut Chrétien's career wouldn't have happened without the luck and political instincts.\n\nFor example, in 1968 when Lester Pearson announced he was retiring, Pierre Trudeau became the instant favourite and Liberal MPs from Quebec were lining up to support him.\n\nBut, at the time, Chrétien was parliamentary secretary to then finance minister Mitchell Sharp, who had his own leadership ambitions.\n\nChrétien loyally supported Sharp, leaving him outside the front-runner's circle and with little hope of promotion if Trudeau won.\n\nBut then, a stroke of luck. Sharp realized his own chances were doomed, dropped out on the eve of the convention and endorsed Trudeau. Chrétien followed right along.\n\nAfter he became prime minister, Trudeau named Sharp his minister of external affairs and Chrétien, with his mentor's sponsorship, the minister of Indian and northern affairs.\n\nWith his quick rise through the many cabinet ministries in the 1970s, he was rarely in one job long enough for problems to develop.\n\nAfter the Liberal \"restoration\" in 1980, he was made minister of justice, helping spearhead the patriation of the Constitution a few years later, which he signed along with the Queen and Trudeau on Parliament Hill.\n\nGoing for the jugular\n\nWhen Chrétien finally did become Liberal leader in 1990, the luck continued.\n\nBrian Mulroney's Conservatives were well into their second term, the economy was heading for recession and in many parts of the country were up in arms over the introduction of the GST and the controversial Meech Lake Accord.\n\nIn fact so controversial had the Conservatives become that two regional parties were born, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the Reform party in the West.\n\nThese parties chipped away at Conservative voters, which allowed Chrétien and the Liberals to coast to a big majority victory in 1993, hang on in 1997 and then reclaim a huge majority in 2000.\n\nIt was Chrétien's instincts in 2000 — to go to the polls before the new Canadian Alliance leader, Stockwell Day, was ready — that led to the big win that year.\n\nAt the Liberal caucus meeting just before the call, 30 of the 31 MPs who spoke advised against an election. But Chrétien took his own advice and the Liberals won big.\n\nA fourth term?\n\nAfter that triumph, however, Chrétien's instincts seemed to fail him.\n\nHis now legendary backstage fights with would-be successor Paul Martin seemed to undermine his authority and scored huge divisions within the Liberal party.\n\nFinally, in June 2003, Chrétien said that if ministers did not stop organizing to succeed him, they would have to leave the cabinet. Martin left, kept organizing and, by the end of the year, Jean Chrétien was gone.\n\nMartin suddenly had to face a united Conservative party that forced the Liberals into minority government. Then the fallout from the sponsorship scandal, left behind from Chrétien's time in office, drove the Liberals out of power.\n\nBut few seemed to blame Chrétien for the debacle. Nor did they blame him for changing the party financing rules, which appears to have hurt the Liberals more than any other party.\n\nHis luck held. In fact, at the ceremony to unveil the Chrétien portrait, the room was filled with his friends and admirers, cheering him on and laughing at his jokes, including the one that he might try to come back for a fourth mandate like British prime minister William Gladstone in the 1800s — at 82.\n\nChrétien beamed. There were cheers and applause.\n\nFor just a minute, it seemed like that stage at that leadership convention, 26 years ago."
