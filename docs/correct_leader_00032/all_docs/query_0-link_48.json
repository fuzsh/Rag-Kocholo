        "text": "Mr. Chancellor, it is my honour to present to you the Right Honourable Jean ChrÃ©tien, Canadaâs 20th prime minister.\n\nLester Pearson once said: âto be Prime Minister of Canada, you need the hide of a rhinoceros, the morals of St. Francis, the patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the leadership of Napoleon, the magnetism of a Beatle and the subtlety of Machiavelli.â\n\nThere is perhaps no role so challenging and rewarding, requiring an uncommon strength of character and commitment to public service.\n\nFor over forty years, Mr. ChrÃ©tien has embodied these strengths and responded to numerous challenges. He has made outstanding contributions to public life in Canada, and plays a continuing role on behalf of Canada and around the world.\n\nNÃ© en 1934 Ã Shawinigan, M. ChrÃ©tien a Ã©tudiÃ© le droit Ã lâUniversitÃ© Laval avant dâÃªtre Ã©lu Ã la Chambre des communes en 1963 comme dÃ©putÃ© de la circonscription de Saint-MauriceâLaflÃ¨che. Quatre ans plus tard, il a Ã©tÃ© nommÃ© ministre dâÃtat aux Finances par le premier ministre Lester B. Pearson. Puis il a occupÃ© pendant 17 ans divers postes au sein du cabinet. Fort de cette riche expÃ©rience, il est devenu chef du Parti libÃ©ral en 1990. Trois ans aprÃ¨s, il a Ã©tÃ© Ã©lu premier ministre du Canada.\n\nHis decade in office was marked by economic turbulence, much like the period we have just experienced. He was successful in restoring the fiscal health of the federal government (an excellent example for you, JMSB graduates), after which he launched a concerted effort to increase the countryâs competitiveness as a knowledge-based society.\n\nIn his reply to the January 2001 Speech from the Throne, he pledged to improve Canadaâs ranking with respect to investment in research and development. âIn the 21st century, our economic and social goals must be pursued hand in hand,â he said. âLet the world see in Canada a society marked by innovation and inclusion, by excellence and justice.â\n\nPour rÃ©aliser cet objectif ambitieux, son gouvernement a mis en place un plan en cinq volets largement axÃ© sur le rÃ´le des universitÃ©s. Des programmes ont ainsi Ã©tÃ© spÃ©cialement conÃ§us pour Ã©tendre la capacitÃ© de recherche, amÃ©liorer lâinfrastructure universitaire, garder les cerveaux les plus brillants et favoriser lâaccÃ¨s Ã lâÃ©ducation postsecondaire.\n\nImplementation of the plan had started with the elimination of the federal deficit in 1997. The same year, the Canada Foundation for Innovation was founded with an initial budget of $1 billion to provide the infrastructure necessary to promote cutting-edge research and development.\n\nThe Canada Research Chairs program came next, to retain scholars, encourage Canadian scholars abroad to return to Canada, and recruit others internationally.\n\nThe remainder of Mr. ChrÃ©tienâs initiatives were implemented in quick succession over the next two years, and included the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the restoration and expansion of funding for granting councils like Canadaâs Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, and the launch of the Trudeau Foundation Fellowships.\n\nTo improve access to education, the ChrÃ©tien government also implemented the landmark Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, the Canada Graduate Scholarships, and the Canadian Education Savings Grant.\n\nConcordia is doubly committed to quality and accessibility, and Mr. ChrÃ©tienâs contributions have had a direct impact on the entire institution. Between 1998 and 2007, Concordia was awarded $24 million from the CFI for 55 infrastructure projects. Some 17 000 Concordia students received more than $60 million in funding from the Millennium Scholarship Foundation. We have had 27 world class Canada Research Chairs at this university, and the program has inspired us to create the Concordia Research Chairs program to retain our own excellent faculty.\n\nAcross Canada, hundreds of thousands of undergraduate, masterâs and doctoral students have benefitted from these extraordinary measures, which strive, in the words of Mr. ChrÃ©tien, to âensure all of our children are given the chance to realize their potential.â\n\nToutes ces initiatives, rÃ©alisÃ©es sous lâimpulsion dâun seul premier ministre, ont changÃ© la nature et la portÃ©e de lâÃ©ducation supÃ©rieure au Canada dâune maniÃ¨re inÃ©galÃ©e depuis la crÃ©ation du Conseil national de recherches en 1916 ou du Programme canadien de prÃªts aux Ã©tudiants en 1964.\n\nIn 2008, Mr. ChrÃ©tien was honoured with the David C. Smith Award for âhis leadership and lifelong commitment to the advancement of research and higher learning.â Last year, he received the Order of Merit from Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMonsieur le chancelier, au nom du sÃ©nat et du conseil dâadministration, jâai lâhonneur de vous demander de confÃ©rer Ã M. Jean ChrÃ©tien le grade de Docteur en droit honoris causa."
