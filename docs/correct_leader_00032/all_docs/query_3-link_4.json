        "text": "Jean Chrétien was the 20th prime minister of Canada. He served in the administrations of several other prime ministers before gaining the post himself in 1993.\n\nJoseph-Jacques-Jean Chrétien was born on January 11, 1934, in Shawinigan, Quebec. He graduated from the law school at Laval University in 1958 and began practicing law that same year. In 1963 he was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the Liberal Party.\n\nChrétien soon joined prime minister Lester Pearson’s cabinet. A cabinet is a group of the leaders of all the government departments. Chrétien was minister of state and minister of national revenue. For Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Chrétien held several different posts. He helped create 10 new national parks as minister of Indian affairs and northern development (now Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada).\n\nIn 1986 Chrétien resigned from the House of Commons. He had lost an election to become head of the Liberal Party earlier that year. He went back to practicing law, but in 1990 he was elected leader of the party. He returned to the House of Commons that same year. Three years later the Liberals won the most seats in the next election, and Chrétien became the prime minister. He was reelected in 1997 and 2000.\n\nAt the beginning of Chrétien’s first term the government had a budget deficit. This means that the government spent more money than it took in. Chrétien addressed this and other problems with the economy. By 1998 the government had a surplus, or more money than it spent.\n\nAnother issue that Chrétien faced was in the province of Quebec. Quebec had long been different from the rest of the country because it was founded by French explorers rather than by the British. Many people in Quebec continue to follow French traditions and to speak French. Some of the people there want the province to separate from the rest of Canada. In 1995 the province held a vote on the issue. They voted to remain a part of Canada, but the vote was very close. Chrétien then tried to address some of the concerns of the people in Quebec.\n\nChrétien later faced another challenge. In 2003 the United States went to war against the country of Iraq and wanted Canada to send troops as well. Chrétien refused to send the troops. Many of the people in Canada approved of this decision. However, Chrétien faced opposition from others in his party. He resigned as head of the Liberal Party in 2003 and left office."
