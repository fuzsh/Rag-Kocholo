        "text": "[An official portrait of Paul Martin, Canada’s 21st prime minister, will hang to the left of the painting of his rival Jean Chrétien on Parliament Hill on May 11. YAHOO CANADA/Simon Doyle]\n\nThis week, the official portrait of Canada’s 21st prime minister will be unveiled in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill. The painting of Paul Martin, who held the leadership position between 2003 and 2006, will be uncovered on Wednesday.\n\nThe location of the newest portrait, which was painted by Prescott, Ont.-based artist Paul Wyse, is perhaps an unintentionally symbolic placement: it will hang next to the portrait of Martin’s predecessor Jean Chrétien, with a stone column in between. Despite both being Liberals, Chrétien and Martin had a history of conflict, particularly when it came to leadership.\n\nStephen Azzi, associate professor of political management at Carleton University, says one of the roots of their notoriously problematic relationship was that they had conflicting personalities.\n\n“Chrétien is the quintessential big picture guy, doesn’t like details, doesn’t like to have long debates over policy, makes decisions intuitively,” he tells Yahoo Canada News. “Martin loves the details. He loves to get into the details of policy.”\n\nWhen Martin worked as the finance minister under Chrétien when he was prime minister, Chrétien would often brush Martin off when he tried to address issues. This would frustrate Martin and eventually the two men wouldn’t meet in person, choosing instead to work out matters through intermediaries.\n\nAnother problem was conflicting interests. While Martin lost the Liberal leadership in 1990, his desire to be leader — along with the strong support of his followers — never went away.\n\nOn June 3, 1990, during the leadership race, it was clear that Martin was going to lose to Chrétien. During a debate, Martin’s supporters started chanting “sellout” and “traitor,” whenever Chrétien spoke.\n\n“Chrétien sat there seething,” Azzi says. “He never forgot this incident. He thought it was unpardonable that people in his party would trash him this way.”\n\nRegardless, after Chrétien won the leadership, he included Martin in key roles. Martin was assigned to manage the liberal policy platform and took on a critic role. Then when Chrétien was elected prime minister in 1993, Martin was appointed finance minister. Despite this, Martin’s followers created a divide in the party, never accepting Chrétien as leader.\n\n“By 1991, the Martin people were seizing power and preparing to fight,” Azzi says. “They systematically took over large chunks of the party’s apparatus.”\n\nBy 2000, Martin’s supporters, known as “the Board,” started considering what he would do next — would he go back to the world of commerce, or fight to push out Chrétien? Martin would publically muse about quitting, and was eventually fired in 2002. That drew a divide amongst his loyal following.\n\n“There was vengeance taken out against the Chrétien people that poisoned the atmosphere in the party for the next decade,” Azzi says.\n\nMartin’s legacy with the Liberals obviously wasn’t over after he was fired, as he went on to be the leader of the party and then elected prime minister in 2003.\n\nAzzi says he doubts the two have been in a room together since then. Martin was noticeably absent at Chrétien’s 80th birthday in 2014.\n\n“When I go to Liberal events, either Chrétien’s there or Martin is,” he says. “The tension remains.”"
