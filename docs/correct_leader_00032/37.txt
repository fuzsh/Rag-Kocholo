On April 21, Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien, former Canadian Prime Minister and Senior Counsel of Dentons Canada, along with Bruce Hartley, Director of Dentons Canada, and two colleagues from Dentons Canada, Bill Cheung and Judy Hou, for the second time visited Dentons Shanghai Office, which is located on 15/16F of Shanghai Tower, the tallest building in China. Wang Hanqi, Director of Dentons Shanghai Office, and attorneys Xiao Fei, Sun Bo, Liu Weixiang, etc., on behalf of the office, welcomed Jean Chrétien and his team, introduced the whole office briefly as well as key business and members of Construction and Real Estate Group specifically. The two parties reached an agreement on future cooperation in Construction and Real Estate. Jean Chrétien was very concerned about the current situation of Chinese real estate, and he expressed that as he had good connection with several Chinese leaders, he would definitely recommend Dentons Shanghai Office’s Construction and Real Estate Group when he had the chance.

Jean Chrétien visited 15/16F of Shanghai Tower on November 3, 2015 while it was still under construction, and this time he visited again at the conference zones and office zones on the 15th floor after the physical move of the office.
