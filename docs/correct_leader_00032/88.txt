Canada Information Office

July 9, 1996

Ottawa, Ontario

Prime Minister Jean Chrétien today announced the establishment of the Canada Information Office to inform Canadians about the federal system of government and promote Canadian identity.

"Canadians have made it clear that they are proud of their country and want to know more about it and about each other. To do so, they need to have ready access to information about the Canadian federation, and to understand how it is changing in response to the demands and priorities of its citizens," said the Prime Minister.

Reporting to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps, the Office responds to the commitment by the Government of Canada in the Speech from the Throne to bring forward measures to help Canadians better understand each other and to build a stronger Canada. It is expected to operate with a budget of some $20 million which was provided for in the March 1996 Budget and is therefore built into the existing fiscal framework. The Office will be fully operational by the time Parliament returns on September 16.

Roger Collet has been appointed as Executive Director of the Canada Information Office. Mr. Collet, originally from Manitoba, is a long-time public servant, and has worked with both provincial and federal governments.
