        "text": "Performance indicators\n\n2022: Net losses - more than 1 billion rubles\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Russian legal entity of the American corporation Oracle suffered net losses of more than 1 billion rubles. This became known on April 26, 2023 - the relevant data are contained in the database of the Federal Tax Service.\n\nAccording to CNews, dismissing employees of the Russian division in the current geopolitical situation, Oracle spent approximately 260 million rubles on compensation for the termination of employment contracts. It is noted that in 2021 the wages of such workers averaged 428 thousand rubles per month.\n\nRevenue of Oracle Computer Equipment JSC (the main Russian legal entity of the company; registered in Moscow) in 2022 decreased by 95% - to 349.8 million rubles. For comparison: a year earlier, this figure was about 7.81 billion rubles. At the same time, the net loss amounted to 1.09 billion rubles, while in 2021 the company showed a net profit of 236 million rubles.\n\nAnother Russian legal entity Oracle - LLC Oracle Development SPB, registered in St. Petersburg - received 36.5 million rubles in revenue in 2022, which is 82% less than in 2021. The net loss of the structure amounted to 223.9 million rubles. Thus, Oracle's total net loss in Russia, associated with the curtailment of business in the country, reached 1.31 billion rubles in 2022.\n\n\"In an explanation to the financial report, Oracle Computer Equipment JSC notes that since the beginning of March 2022, the company has faced export and import restrictions, as well as problems with the storage of products, which\" objectively deprived the company of the opportunity \"to continue selling products and providing services on the Russian market. Due to changes in the operating environment, it was impossible to further maintain and maintain spare parts stocks on site, \"CNews reported[1]\n\nHistory\n\n2024\n\nBankruptcy trustee of Oracle in Russia: The Company waives any payments\n\nOn July 22, 2024, it became known that the Oracle Computer Equipment company, the Russian structure of the American corporation Oracle, refuses to pay its customers when winding up its business in the Russian Federation. According to the bankruptcy trustee, the corporation is very seriously involved in the lawsuit and is trying to prevent any attempts to recover money.\n\nIn none of its public statements does Oracle cite any objective reasons or the introduction of restrictive economic measures. On the contrary, Oracle directly explains its actions to stop activities by motives of a political nature, - says the recall of the arbitration manager (quoted by RBC).\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the case, by July 22, 2024, MegaFon became the only creditor who managed to receive the money before Oracle took them abroad. The interlocutor noted that the bankruptcy law does not provide for the possibility of repaying debts to some creditors and not paying off to others - the money is distributed evenly, so the court ordered MegaFon to return 44 million rubles to the total competing mass, after which the money will be distributed among all participants in the dispute. MegaFon \"challenges this decision in court.\n\nAlbina Galimova, a leading lawyer in the dispute resolution practice of the EBR law firm, an expert at the Moscow Digital School educational platform, believes that the chances of satisfying creditors' claims are extremely low.\n\nThe managing partner of Briefcase Law Office Evgeny Kryukov also believes that it is not worth counting on prompt receipt of money. According to him, the average period from the beginning of bankruptcy proceedings to the moment even part of the money is received by the creditor is usually at least three to four years. Kryukov noted that most of those who left Russia the companies make significant efforts to pay off the claims of creditors and try to prevent the bankruptcy of their subsidiaries. Among the examples, he cited IT companies,,, Microsoft,, SAP, and Autodesk. Acronis Epam Cisco Intel AMD[2]\n\nOracle's bankruptcy process in Russia has been extended. The bankruptcy trustee seeks to cancel a number of large payments to the company\n\nAs TAdviser found out, the court extended the bankruptcy proceedings against Oracle Computer Equipment, which was declared bankrupt in August 2023, until December 3, 2024. This follows from the information in the file of arbitration cases available as of June. The term was extended at the request of the bankruptcy trustee, who had not yet carried out all the measures to complete the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular, the formation of the bankruptcy estate has not yet been completed, and settlements with creditors, respectively, have not been made, as indicated in the ruling of the Moscow Arbitration Court.\n\nThe bankruptcy trustee has formed a register of claims of creditors \"Oracle Computer Equipment,\" according to which the claims of third-stage creditors totaling over 1.4 billion rubles are included. Among the companies that stated their claims are CROC the Inc., NVision Group, Jet Infosystems, Marvell CT, Force - Development Center, Borlas Group, etc.\n\nIn the case of Oracle bankruptcy in Russia, the formation of a bankruptcy estate continues\n\nTo form a bankruptcy estate, the bankruptcy trustee, among other things, filed an application with the court to invalidate a number of transactions in which Oracle Computer Equipment made payments within one year before it faced bankruptcy. Some of these payments have already been declared invalid by the court.\n\nFor example, in May 2024, the Moscow Arbitration Court received a statement challenging the Oracle Computer Equipment transaction made under a distribution agreement concluded back in 2014: namely, a payment in favor of a foreign legal entity Oracle - Oracle EMEA Limited in the amount of about 352.4 rubles.\n\nIn April, at the request of the bankruptcy trustee, payments to Megafon from Oracle Computer Equipment in the amount of about 44 million rubles made in November 2022 were recognized as an invalid transaction[3]. Megafon then recovered this money from the company through the court as unjust enrichment. The bankruptcy trustee indicated that at the time of the transfer of money from Oracle Computer Equipment to other creditors there were unfulfilled obligations to pay unjust enrichment for the same period of time, subsequently included in the register of claims of the debtor's creditor.\n\nThe court concluded that Megafon received preferential satisfaction of its claims before satisfying the claims of other Oracle Computer Equipment creditors, and that the fulfillment of the obligation to Megafon occurred in a situation of insufficient funds from Oracle Computer Equipment. As a result, the court invalidated these payments and determined to return them to Oracle Computer Equipment, which, thus, would restore the debt to Megafon.\n\nSimilarly, payments to Oracle Computer Equipment for different amounts in favor of, for example, Jet Infosystems, Taber Trade, as well as the provision of compensation in the amount of about 241 thousand euros were also invalidated[4] in favor of Antemona in the framework of the concluded agreement on the termination of the long-term lease agreement.\n\nThe bankruptcy trustee also went to court to cancel cash payments from Oracle Computer Equipment to one of the company's former top managers - Aleksei Kurochka upon his dismissal in 2022, and turn them into a bankruptcy estate. In February 2024, the court invalidated payments to Aleksei Kurochka in the amount of about 8.44 million rubles.\n\nIn addition, the bankruptcy trustee asked the court to take interim measures, such as seizing money in the specified amount on all open bank accounts of Aleksei Kurochka, prohibiting the traffic police units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs from performing registration actions against vehicles belonging to him and prohibiting Rosreestr units from performing registration actions against real estate belonging to him. However, the court refused to satisfy this application to the bankruptcy trustee.\n\nHowever, most of the persons whose payments were declared invalid by the court are not satisfied with this state of affairs, appeals have been filed.\n\nIn addition to canceling payments, the bankruptcy trustee also tried through the court to claim the material assets of Oracle Computer Equipment in the form of computer equipment, office equipment and furniture from the last former general director of the company, Arina Putintseva. But the court refused to satisfy these requirements[5]. As follows from the materials of the case, Arina Putintseva was appointed general director of Oracle Computer Equipment by order back in December 2021, but the corresponding entry was made to the Unified State Register of Legal Entities about this only on February 16, 2022. And almost immediately after making this entry in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Oracle suspended its activities in Russia.\n\nThe court found that Arina Putintseva did not actually manage the activities of Oracle Computer Equipment and, being in the position of general director, was completely outside the Russian Federation at the place of her main employment - at Oracle in Ireland. It also established the absence of an act of acceptance and transfer of property between the company and Arina Putintseva and any other evidence.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to be done in the bankruptcy process. TAdviser continues to monitor developments.\n\n2023\n\nAssets of the Russian Oracle structure are estimated at 0 rubles\n\nAt the end of August 2023, it became known that the bankruptcy trustee of the bankrupt Oracle Computer Equipment JSC (Russian structure) Oracle Yegor Nepomnyashchikh estimated the assets of this enterprise at zero.\n\nAccording to RIA Novosti, more than 70 Russian customers of Oracle Computer Equipment, which own over 97.5% of the vote, took part in the first meeting of creditors, which took place on August 1, 2023. All of them voted for the transition to bankruptcy proceedings, the majority - for the approval of the manager Nepomniachtchi, who before that was the interim manager.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, the Arbitration Court Moscow declared the Russian subsidiary Oracle bankrupt and opened bankruptcy proceedings in the company. The initial bankruptcy procedure - surveillance - was initiated at the request of the IT company \"CROC incorporated\" due to a debt of more than 49 million. rubles In addition, the register of creditors' claims includes requests from LLC \"\" in the Force Distribution amount of more than 439 million rubles, LLC \"MKT\" in the amount of about 425 million rubles, LLC \"Force - development center\" with a claim of more than 160 million rubles, \"\" in Sberbank the amount of more than 77 million rubles, etc.\n\nIt is said that Nepomnyashchikh asks the Moscow Arbitration Court to establish the real value of the assets of Oracle Computer Equipment in the amount of 0 rubles. The documents specify that the manager asks to fix such a figure \"at the time of the introduction of the bankruptcy procedure and until the debtor provides documents confirming the presence of assets whose book value exceeds 100 million rubles.\"\n\nThe managing partner of the law firm Bashilov, Noskov and Partners, lawyer Igor Noskov, emphasizes that the debtor's financial statements rarely reflect the real value of assets - \"it is often overestimated, which badly affects certain moments of the bankruptcy procedure.\"[6]\n\nNo more than 20% of debts shine to creditors of the bankrupt Russian subsidiary Oracle\n\nIn mid-August 2023, it became known that the creditors of the bankrupt Oracle Computer Equipment JSC (the Russian structure of Oracle) will be able to return no more than a fifth of the debts.\n\nThe court appointed Yegor Nepomniachtchi as the bankruptcy trustee in the Oracle case in Russia. According to him, the total amount of the company's debt to Russian customers is approximately 1.5 billion rubles. At the same time, the value of the assets of Oracle Computer Equipment JSC does not exceed 264 million rubles. Thus, creditors can receive only less than 20% of the amount due to them. At the same time, Oracle destroyed all its property in the Russian Federation - furniture, equipment, computers, servers, etc. - due to the termination of activities on the Russian market.\n\nThey intend to seek the return of the dogs from the Russian subsidiary Oracle, Sberbank LLC, Force - Development Center Incorporated CJSC CROC and other Russian customers. At the same time, Sberbank stressed that the organization will support the actions of the bankruptcy trustee to search for the debtor's assets and fill the bankruptcy estate.\n\nSergey Uchitel, partner of the Pen & Paper Bar Association, explains that the bankruptcy estate can be formed not only due to the property of the debtor identified by the arbitration manager at the observation stage, but also by challenging suspicious transactions (payments) under the rules of the Bankruptcy Law, made on the eve of bankruptcy. Therefore, the value of the property identified by the interim manager as part of the observation does not mean that creditors can rely solely on this amount.\n\nAlexey Sapozhnikov, lawyer, partner, head of the legal and tax consulting department, general director of the Sapozhnikov & Partners law firm, believes that the further process of debt collection depends precisely on the bankruptcy trustee.\n\nHe usually tries to sue everyone, as this increases his reward. Therefore, the likelihood of claims against controlling persons, the general director, and members of the company is very high. Of course, then the question will arise of the recognition and execution of Russian court decisions in other countries where the property of debtors may be located, says Sapozhnikov.\n\nThe court declared bankrupt Oracle division in Russia\n\nThe Moscow Arbitration Court declared the Oracle Corporation division in Russia bankrupt, opening bankruptcy proceedings on it. On August 7, 2023, the TASS agency drew attention to the relevant materials of the file cabinet of arbitration cases.\n\nRecognize the debtor bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings, - indicated in the file of arbitration cases. No other details are given.\n\nAccording to him, the claims of 10 creditors of the company exceeded 1.25 billion rubles. Among the main creditors of Oracle: the official distributor of Oracle in Russia is FORCE - Distribution with 440 million rubles of claims, as well as Marvell Distribution. The company \"FORCE - Development Center\" requires 160.5 million rubles.\n\nIn addition, Sberbank and Alfa-Bank were included in the list of creditors. Claims of credit institutions - 77.2 million and 99.4 million rubles, respectively. The company for the repair of communication equipment \"Newtek.TV\" claims 8 million rubles, the IT company \"Jet Infosystems\" - 20 million rubles, \"Borlas\" - 11 million rubles.\n\nThe bankruptcy case of the Russian legal entity Oracle was initiated by the IT company CROC. The latter filed a lawsuit for 49.7 million rubles and obtained payment of most of this amount.\n\nCROC is not the first company to intend to bankrupt Russian Oracle. For example, MegaFon was going to initiate the bankruptcy of the Russian representative office of the American IT company, which explained the intention to not comply with the decision of the court to recover funds by Oracle's subsidiary.\n\nOracle is known as a software developer and server hardware vendor. The company specializes in the production of database management systems (DMS), binding software and business applications. The corporation's products are used or used by many large Russian companies, including those whose shareholders include the Russian state. Among them are the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Sberbank, Rostelecom, the Federal Tax Service (FTS), etc.[7]\n\nMore than 900 million rubles are required from the Russian division of Oracle\n\n8 Russian Russian companies demand from Oracle's subsidiary in the Russian Federation - Oracle Computer Equipment JSC - more than 900 million rubles. This was announced on March 23, 2023 by TASS with reference to the materials of the Moscow Arbitration Court .\n\nThe greatest demands were made by the former official distributor of Oracle in Russia - FORCE - Distribution. He wants to achieve payment of 440 million rubles, including more than 403 million rubles of the principal debt, as well as interest for the use of other people's money and state duty costs.\n\nAlso among the creditors appears Sberbank- his claims amount to 77.2 million rubles, the company Marvel Distribution\"\" (LLC \"Marvell CT,\" 189.1 million rubles) and \"\" FORCE - Development Center(160.5 million rubles). Other creditors are Newtek.TV (the main activity is the repair of communication equipment) - the requirements are 8 million rubles, IT companies \"\" and Jet Infosystems the Group \"\" Borlas- 2 million rubles and 11 million rubles, respectively, as well as \"\" Nec Neva Communication Systems- 12.8 million rubles.\n\nAccording to the agency, by March 23, 2023, less than half of the applications have been accepted for consideration so far. At the same time, Marvell Distribution has already sent another application to establish the size of creditors' claims.\n\nRussian companies previously began to flood the Russian representative office of Oracle with claims worth hundreds of millions. Among the applicants were CROC (filed a lawsuit for almost 50 million rubles), MegaFon, IBS Platformix and Taber Trade. The court satisfied the claim of MegaFon due to the refusal of the corporation to provide him with technical support and the claim of CROC, but the organizations did not receive the money. Because of this, Megafon initiated the bankruptcy process of the Russian legal entity Oracle, since it did not wait for its 44 million. Then \"CROC\" also announced its intention to bankrupt the corporation[8]\n\nThe court introduced a surveillance procedure in the Russian office of Oracle\n\nOn February 6, 2023, it became known about the introduction of the initial observation (bankruptcy) procedure in the Russian representative office of Oracle - Oracle Computer Equipment JSC. The corresponding decision was made by the Moscow Arbitration Court.\n\nAs the TASS Russian IT company \"\" filed a statement with the court with reference to the materials of the file cabinet of arbitration cases. CROC According to the agency, in the section of information about the court act adopted at the meeting is \"Introduction of observation.\" The details of the process and the justification for such a decision were not disclosed in court documents by February 6, 2023.\n\nThe press service of the CROC company said that the company always prioritizes the possibility of resolving the issue in pre-trial order.\n\nIn this case, we made a number of attempts to resolve the issue, but this did not bring results. Therefore, we were forced to go to court, and the claim was fully satisfied. However, the payment did not follow even after that, and therefore we are forced to take the next step, which is used in legal practice. This is a standard scenario for the development of debt collection processes with similar circumstances, \"Kroka said.\n\nPavel Katkov, a lawyer, economist, member of the RF Chamber of Commerce and Industry Committee on Entrepreneurship in the Field of Media Communications, believes that bankruptcy is not the best way for a particular creditor, because in this case he actually invites other creditors to the procedure, as well as the state and other persons whose obligations must be fulfilled in the first place.\n\nIt would be wiser to go simply with a claim for recovery of funds. However, the plaintiff decided otherwise. Perhaps he has information that we do not own. In any case, this is already becoming a trend. Foreign companies leave the Russian economy, along the way often leaving local creditors with outstanding debts and obligations, which the latter do not want to hate, the lawyer said.[9]\n\n2022\n\nCROC initiates Oracle bankruptcy in Russia\n\nOn December 6, 2022, it became known that CROC was initiating the bankruptcy of Oracle in Russia. According to Interfax, citing materials on Fedresurse, CROC the Inc. CJSC intends to go to court with statements declaring Oracle Computer Equipment JSC insolvent.\n\nAccording to the file cabinet of arbitration cases, CROC filed a lawsuit against Oracle in Russia in June 2022, and four months later the court decided to recover 47.4 million rubles from the defendant for \"unjust enrichment\" under a contract on technical support services. The contract was concluded in August 2021, but was never executed, according to the court materials referred to by the agency.\n\nIn mid-October 2022, it became known that the mobile operator Megafon decided to go to court with an application for declaring bankrupt the Russian division of Oracle - Oracle Computer Equipment JSC. The company does not comply with the court's decision to recover the amount for non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, the operator's press service told RB.RU.\n\nRepresentatives did not specify what specific court decision and contract are in question. In May, the operator filed a lawsuit with the Moscow Arbitration Court to recover 44.1 million rubles from the unit. In July, the court satisfied the claim of Megafon.\n\nThe decision, according to Interfax, says that the operator has concluded agreements with Oracle Computer Equipment, which provide for the provision of technical support services for equipment and/or software.\n\nMegafon paid 105.6 million rubles for services under these agreements, but since the beginning of March, Oracle Computer Equipment has unilaterally stopped providing technical support.\n\nThen the operator turned to the company with a claim to refuse orders and return overpayment amounts, but the application was ignored. Therefore, Megafon went to court, the company did not challenge the claim for recovery.[10]\n\nRussian partners and customers demand almost a billion rubles from Oracle. They win lawsuits one by one\n\nAfter Oracle stopped its activities in Russia in March against the backdrop of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, by November 10 lawsuits were received in the arbitration court against the local office of the American vendor - Oracle Computer Equipment, according to data from the file of arbitration courts.\n\nThe court appealed, in particular, Alfa-BankMegaphone\",\" \"Marvel\" Distribution(\"Marvell CT\"),, \"Force\"\",\" Jet Infosystems\",\" \"(\" CROC \"Taber Trade\" Girlfriend \"). In total, Oracle partners and customers have so far demanded to pay them 956 million. rubles\n\nThe largest lawsuits with a total volume of 543 million rubles came from the companies of the Force Group of Companies. They have yet to be considered. And the court has already satisfied six claims totaling about 283 million rubles.\n\nFrom the published court decisions, it follows that the reason for the appeals to the court was Oracle's failure to fulfill its obligations under previously concluded contracts, mainly in terms of technical support, for which the company was paid, but from which the vendor \"chopped off\" them in early March.\n\nOf the claims already satisfied, the largest in volume - by 172 million rubles - from one of the key Russian distributors of Marvel Distribution (legal entity Marvell CT). From the court decision in this case, it follows that the distributor previously entered into partnership contracts with Oracle for the distribution of products of the American vendor, according to which Oracle, among other things, must provide technical support services for the end user.\n\nMarvel Distribution made contractual payments, but on March 1, 2022, Oracle actually stopped providing services without any legal basis. At the same time, Oracle did not send notifications about the termination of the contract or individual orders, or any proposals for resolving settlements in connection with such termination.\n\nIn an email dated March 4, 2022, an Oracle spokesman confirmed that access to the company's services had been suspended effective March 1, 2022. On March 18, at the request of Marvell CT, Oracle support confirmed that the company was subject to US economic sanctions and stopped all activities in the Russian Federation. Since March 1, 2022, services under the agreement have not been provided, acts of work performed between the parties have not been signed since March 2022, the court said.\n\nThe court found the claim justified and subject to full satisfaction.\n\nA similar situation has developed for Jet Infosystems, which had several Oracle partner statuses, including platinum. The company demanded that the vendor pay the 28 million rubles due to it in connection with the unfulfilled obligations. On March 1, Oracle stopped providing technical support services for software and equipment to Jet Infosystems, closed its access to its personal account on its website, and deactivated its membership in its partner program.\n\nIn response to the letters of Jet Infosystems on this matter, Oracle said that it had updated its policy for supporting equipment and systems, adding a new condition to the section \"Use of Services,\" according to which \"services are not available and are not provided to individuals or legal entities or their representatives in Venezuela and the Russian Federation, including, among other things, the government of Venezuela and the government of the Russian Federation.\" The Arbitration Court also sided with the Russian company in this case.\n\nThe court ordered Oracle to return the money for the paid but not provided technical support to the IT company CROC. The American vendor must pay her about 48 million rubles. \"Megafon\" for paid, but stopped technical support, sued Oracle about 44 million rubles.\n\nAccording to the database of legal entities Kontur.Focus, \"the revenue of\" Oracle Computer Equipment \"in 2021 amounted to 7.8 billion rubles, net profit - about 323 million rubles. The company had 2.89 billion rubles on its balance sheet at the end of 2021.\n\nConsulting division Oracle continued to work in Russia under a new name\n\nOn October 10, 2022, it became known about the continuation of the work of Oracle's consulting division in Russia, but under a new name - Data Prime. Read more here.\n\nDismissal of employees\n\nOn July 6, 2022, information appeared that the American corporation Oracle announced the dismissal of employees of the Russian representative office. The company announced this to its employees at the end of June 2022.\n\nThe staff will leave the company on August 31, 2022. This was told to CNews by interlocutors in the Russian software and integration market.\n\nAnd someone could find a new job themselves and leave, someone move to other positions in other offices, \"he said.\n\n{{quote 'Compensation payment schemes in each company are different, but in general in American vendors are similar, \"Boris Popov, director of business development at Vinteo, told CNews. - Usually payments depend on the position and term of work, and can be from three to seven average employee income per month. }}\n\nRepresentatives of Oracle during the day could not answer the questions of the source[11].\n\nStopping software certificates in Russia\n\nAs it became known at the end of March 2022, the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC) suspended certificates for, software IBM,, and Microsoft Oracle SAP VMware a number of other foreign manufacturers. In total, 56 certificates were frozen by March 25. More. here\n\nOracle clarified what kind of activity it stopped in Russia\n\nIn March 2022, Oracle published on its website explanations regarding the suspension of the company's work in Russia and Belarus. For information, see FAQs.\n\nIt reports that Oracle has suspended technical support agreements in Russia and Belarus. As a result, access to the My Oracle Support portal has been disabled and software updates and patches are not available for download.\n\nOracle has ceased to provide all consulting and extended client support services in the Russian Federation and Belarus. The company also stopped working with all partners and their subsidiaries in these countries as part of the Oracle PartnerNetwork partner program. This applies to activities not only in Russia and Belarus, but also in other countries in which Russian and Belarusian partners of the American manufacturer of corporate software worked.\n\nIn addition, Oracle has stopped all its cloud services in Russia and Belarus. Oracle products and services are prohibited for export, re-export, transfer or use in the territory of these states.\n\nOracle said it was not going to explore alternative arrangements to provide support or services to affected organizations (such as allowing re-subscriptions to services at an authorized location or using third-party partners to provide support).\n\nAnother limitation is that in Russia and Belarus Oracle no longer accepts orders for any products or services under existing agreements and will not conclude new contracts.\n\nOracle also announced support for its employees in Ukraine: they are provided with cash bonuses, relocation assistance and various housing options.[12]\n\nSuspension of business in Russia\n\nMarch 2, 2022 Oracle in its official account on the social network Twitter announced the suspension of activities in Russia.\n\nOn behalf of 150,000 Oracle employees around the world and in support of both the elected government of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, Oracle has already suspended all operations in the Russian Federation, the company said.\n\nThis message was written in response to a letter to Oracle from the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mikhail Fedorov. The original of this letter, sent on the same day to Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Oracle CEO Safra Katz, Fedorov posted on his Twitter page.\n\nAgainst the background of Russia's military operation in Ukraine, the minister asked Oracle to stop any relations and business in Russia, including providing technical support and providing software updates until \"the conflict is resolved and a fair order is established.\" He also asked Oracle to terminate relations with Russian-based clients and partners.\n\nThe IT industry always supports the values of responsibility and democracy. I believe your company divides them too. Now responsibility is a choice that determines the future. And now more than ever, the lives of people depend on your choice, \"says Mikhail Fedorov's letter.\n\nThe minister sent a letter of similar content to Christian Klein, Chief Executive Officer of SAP. At the time of publication of the news, the official response from SAP has not yet appeared on the Internet.\n\n2021\n\nRevenue growth in Russia by 28% to 8,013 million rubles\n\nAt the end of 2021, Oracle's revenue in Russia amounted to 8,013 million rubles, an increase of 28% compared to 2020, which allowed it to take 66th place in the ranking of TAdviser100: The largest IT companies in Russia 2022. The total revenue of Oracle Computer Equipment JSC and Oracle Development Spb LLC from the financial statements for 2020-2021 is presented. Excluding VAT.\n\nBusiness growth in Russia and the CIS in dollars by 20%\n\nFrom June 1 to December 1, 2020, Oracle's business in Russia and the CIS in dollars collectively grew by about 20%. Oleg Zhukov, vice president of Oracle in Russia and the CIS, spoke about this on February 11, 2021 at a press conference. This figure is higher than the average for the Russian IT market for the entire year: according to IDC, which predicted a fall of 30% in the spring of 2020, as a result, the dynamics of the IT market turned out to be close to zero.\n\nAccording to Zhukov, all areas of business showed growth during the specified period. Earlier in Oracle, cloud services and hardware solutions were among the drivers of their growth in Russia. Oleg Zhukov emphasized that over the past few months, Oracle in Russia and the CIS has grown very much in the business associated with iron: over the past quarter, it has become close to the volume of the technology software business.\n\nThe growth of the \"iron\" business is observed against the background of a decrease in Oracle's share in the database market.\n\nHistorically, several years ago, the situation in the database market was as follows: about 75% of all databases were Oracle. Due to a number of technical and non-technical events, the number of Oracle databases within the corporate sector began to decrease, including government decisions. Therefore, it sank a little here, - said Oleg Zhukov.\n\nAs he explained to TAdviser, over the past 6-7 years, a fairly large number of databases have appeared that do not support critical applications. A lot of customers decided to try these applications, and as a result, the number of such databases increased, and Oracle decreased.\n\nI must say that Oracle's decline in the database market is a global trend, although the company remains the leader in the on-premium solutions segment: in a study by IDC and Bloomberg, published in August 2020, Oracle allocated a 43% share in this database segment. The share of other DBMSs is increasing, including SQL Server and PostgreSQL.\n\nIn Russia, the situation is aggravated by government initiatives to ban government agencies from purchasing foreign software. Oracle, calling itself a law-abiding company, does not go to this sector. From what Oleg Zhukov said, it follows that in government agencies the company continues to work only in large projects, where Oracle went even before such government instructions.\n\nOracle traditionally does not disclose local sales of products and services in monetary terms. And in terms of the number of licenses, database sales indicators cannot be cited, Oleg Zhukov told TAdviser: an agreement with one large customer can give tens of thousands of licenses used, he says.\n\nAs for the Oracle hardware, according to Zhukov, if we talk only about super-productive large installations, more than 200 such complexes operate in Russia.\n\nOleg Zhukov notes an increase in demand for Oracle hardware solutions and connects this, first of all, with the quality of technologies: they are the ones driving demand, he is sure, referring to the hardver platform. Exadata Initially, Oracle developed hardware technologies that came from Sun Microsystems architecture. SPARC About 7-8 years ago, an avalanche-like increase in demand for SPARC began, servers they recall in Oracle Russia and the CIS. Then the Russian market in was To Europe number one in terms of consumption of these solutions, Zhukov noted.\n\nBut after some time, this topic began to shrink globally among all vendors on the market, and the era of x86 machines came. Oracle entered this market with the x86 Exadata platform and further developed its versions of databases and applications in such a way that they work best on Exadata. Therefore, Zhukov says, even in the \"crowded database market\" the demand for Exadata is visible.\n\nThe company notes that, seeing demand, Oracle is also striving to make this platform available, including to small and medium-sized businesses, lowering the entry threshold as much as possible. To do this, the option of using Exadata in a cloud with per second charging for the required amount of computing resources is provided. Another option is the cloud at the client, where the entry threshold is a little more than $10 thousand per month, TAdviser cited data in Oracle.\n\nOleg Zhukov also said that a significant increase in the dollar against the ruble in 2020 does not affect Oracle's business in Russia, which can work with both ruble and dollar price lists. Once a year, Oracle internally fixes the dollar exchange rate, which lasts until the next reporting period.\n\n2020\n\nRevenue growth by 38.7% to RUB 6,260 million.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the company's revenue Oracle Russia CIS amounted to 6,260 million rubles, an increase of 38.7% compared to 2019, which allowed it to take 65th place in the ranking of TAdviser100: The largest IT companies in Russia 2021. The total revenue of Oracle computer Equipment JSC and Oracle Development Spb LLC is taken from the accounting statements for 2019-2020 contained in the database \".\"Contour Focus\n\nOracle's share in the domestic market for business automation software - 4.8%\n\nIron and cloud services spurred Oracle's business in Russia and the CIS\n\nIn fiscal 2020 (ended for the company on May 31, 2020), Oracle's business in Russia and the CIS was stable and grew by \"several percent,\" said Oracle Regional Director Oleg Zhukov in July. In what currency does growth mean, the company did not specify TAdviser. Oracle traditionally avoids specifics when it comes to financial performance in individual countries.\n\nIn general, in the EMEA region, which includes Russia, according to the company's annual report, in fiscal 2020, its revenue in dollars decreased by 2%.\n\nAmong the factors that contributed to the development of Oracle's business in Russia and the CIS are the course towards digital transformation in large organizations.\n\nDigital transformation is no longer just a necessity, it needs to be carried out here and now. Otherwise, we all - both the country's economy and specific organizations - will simply be turned off from later life, - said Oleg Zhukov during an online conference.\n\nThe company told what directions its business grew in Russia and the CIS in the reporting period. According to Oleg Zhukov, Oracle had large projects in all industries, many of the projects were new. These include, for example, the creation of a single billing on Oracle solutions at Megafon, digitalization on the full Oracle stack at Otkritie Bank, real-time analytics using the Golden Gate tool at VTB, and the modernization of Exadata for the corporate information system at Mosvodokanal.\n\nOf the new projects in the fields of retail, distribution and industry, the company cited as an example the transfer of finance to Oracle ERP Cloud in Auchan Retail Russia, the creation of analytics based on Exadata in Magnit, the creation of a business system on Exadata in the network \"Girlfriend,\" modernization and expansion of the corporate information system based on Oracle ERP throughout the MMK group.\n\nOracle says that for 15% of customers in Russia, Oracle solutions have no competitors.\n\nThis is a unique Oracle functionality for customers that no one else can provide to them. What they value most. These can be some specific products, or there can be their options and specific functions. These are the results of our internal research and communication with customers, \"TAdviser explained to Oracle what the company means.\n\nThe company calls the new Exadata X8M complexes, cloud services, solutions related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain as product areas that showed growth in Russia and the CIS.\n\nOleg Zhukov stressed that at the same time, most customers use only 15% of all innovative capabilities of Oracle products. Here, the company sees growth potential: \"This field - 85% - is where our customers and partners can move and grow.\"\n\nSpeaking about import substitution, Oleg Zhukov noted that often we are talking about the transition to solutions based on open source software. Oracle solutions allow you to work with proprietary software and open source, he stressed.\n\nIn 2018, according to a TAdviser study, despite the import substitution program, the volume of purchases of Oracle software by government agencies and state-owned companies in Russia reached 13.3 billion rubles, which then became the maximum over the past five years. TAdviser has not yet conducted a similar study for 2019, but a quick search on the official public procurement portal shows that Oracle still has great prospects in the public sector. So, in May 2020, the Federal Tax Service signed a contract of 8.7 billion rubles for the supply of equipment and software for the development of IT infrastructure, which is based on Oracle hardware and software solutions. The project concerns the distributed transaction segment of the key IT system of the Federal Tax Service - AIS \"Tax-3.\" In relation to the proposed software supply, the state customer indicated in the documents the impossibility of complying with the ban on the purchase of foreign software by government agencies established by law from January 1, 2016.\n\nAlso, Russian government agencies and companies with state participation in 2019 and the first half of 2020 continued to spend large sums to support and maintain Oracle solutions. For example, during this period, VTB entered into contracts for technical support services for Oracle equipment and software for a total amount of more than 800 million rubles.\n\nGazprom Inform purchased equipment maintenance and maintenance services for Oracle software for 315 million rubles, purchased technical support certificates for about 150 million rubles, and Transneft purchased support services for Oracle equipment for about 117 million rubles. Social Insurance Fund\n\n2019\n\nDecrease in revenue by 36% to 4.5 billion rubles.\n\nAt the end of 2019, Oracle in Russia and the CIS took 34th place in the TAdviser Ranking: the 50 most profitable representative offices of foreign IT companies in Russia. The company's revenue for 2019 amounted to 4,513,004 thousand rubles, which is 36% lower than in 2018. This indicator includes the revenue of legal entities of Oracle Computer Equipment JSC and Oracle Development Spb LLC.\n\nImport substitution does not prevent Oracle from increasing business in Russia\n\nOracle's business volumes in Russia are not decreasing. On the contrary, they are even increasing, Oleg Zhukov, vice president of Oracle in Russia and the CIS, told TAdviser in October 2019.\n\nZhukov did not disclose either absolute or relative figures. According to open data from the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), the dynamics of Oracle business cannot be traced either. The revenue of Oracle Computer Equipment in 2018 amounted to 6.8 billion rubles, there is no indicator of 2017. Oracle Development Spb revenue in 2018 - 327 million rubles, in 2017 - 621 million rubles.\n\nAccording to a study by TAdviser, government agencies and state-owned companies spent more than 13.3 billion rubles on the purchase of licenses and technical support services for Oracle products in 2018, which is 19% more than in 2017, and is a record over the past five years (more).\n\nAccording to Zhukov, Oracle plans to continue to increase its business. In particular, he expects to increase the year-on-year sales of cloud services in Russia by 40% in fiscal year 2020 (ends May 31, 2020).\n\nThere are few cases when customers refuse Oracle software due to the conditions imposed on them by the import substitution policy, according to Zhukov.\n\nThe fact is how convenient and correct the customer considers the migration to Russian software to be. How fast and resource-demanding it is for him, - explained Zhukov\n\nCustomers today, in his opinion, are very competent and professional in choosing, applying IT, switching to other platforms and new technologies or open source, deploying clouds, testing promising new products such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain.\n\nAccording to Oleg Zhukov, the drivers of sales of Oracle cloud services in fiscal 2020 are products such as Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Management Cloud (solutions for IT management), Oracle Exadata Cloud at Customer (infrastructure and platform services for databases in client date centers).\n\nOleg Zhukov has led the Russian representative office of Oracle for three years - since June 2016. The main development trend during this period, he calls the active expansion of cooperation on cloud products with companies in the real sector of the economy.\n\nOracle cloud services, according to Zhukov, are already used by Tele2, Rosgosstrakh, First Expeditionary Company (PEC), Industrial and Metallurgical Holding UK (PMH), X5 Retail Group, AUCHAN, Schneider Electric Russia (Schneider Electric), Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant, NMLC, Norilsk Nickel, MMC (Norilsk Nickel), ESET (ESET Softvea), DPD (Armadillo Business Package DPD RUS), GS1 Rus, Faberlik (Faberlic), Stoloto (Technology Company Center, TK Center), Doing business, FORCE - Development Center, Compit Technologies (Compit Technologies) and many other companies. In addition, Oracle Cloud services are actively tested by a wide range of companies.\n\nAmong the clients of the company there is even an individual. Let and single. These are developers using Oracle services in their work - said Zhukov\n\nThe company also sees great prospects from the Always Free program, which allows developers to create applications in any programming language using the free Always Free services of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Autonomous Database.\n\nNote that on October 29, Oracle also announced the Oracle Cloud Free Tier program. This program offers free access to Oracle Cloud, training on the Oracle Autonomous Database for teachers and a curriculum for students.\n\n2018\n\nRevenue - 7.08 billion rubles.\n\nOracle revenue in Russia and the CIS (Oracle Computer Equipment JSC and Oracle Development Spb LLC) for 2018 amounted to 7,078,281 thousand rubles.\n\nRestriction of work with Russian oil workers\n\nIn February 2018, it became known about the restriction of Oracle's cooperation with Russian oil and gas companies due to sanctions.\n\nAt the disposal of the Kommersant newspaper was a letter in which Oracle notified Russian partners about Washington's new sanctions requirements against oil and gas customers of American products.\n\nA ban on transactions related to deep-sea and Arctic offshore exploration technologies is reported if companies are involved in them from Directive No. 4 of the US sectoral sanctions of September 12, 2014. Projects that started on January 29, 2018 fall under the ban. Renewal, modification or extension of existing contracts is not allowed. An exception was made for the financial services sector.\n\nThe publication writes that 238 companies were included in the list, including Gazprom, Surgutneftegaz, Lukoil and Rosneft, their subsidiaries and foreign projects. The sanctions will affect structures in whose capital the share of the listed company is from 33% or it has the majority of voting rights.\n\nA newspaper source in one of the oil companies believes that a complete ban on software from Oracle will cause great damage to the industry, the dependence of the Russian oil and gas sector on foreign software is still very high. These can be separate solutions or in conjunction with products of other developers, for example, the use of Oracle DBMS for SAP solutions that are implemented in almost all oil companies in Russia.\n\nAs the interlocutor notes, large customers of Oracle software, like Rosneft or Gazprom, have many structures and third-party businesses that are not directly related to oil production, which may not face restrictions.\n\nWith many companies on the sanctions lists, the case-by-case approach works, and often the issue can still be resolved, he adds.[13]\n\n2017\n\nOracle radically changed its strategy in the Russian cloud market\n\nFollowing a global strategy that prioritizes the cloud business, Oracle has changed its approach to developing this area in Russia. The company implemented the ability to locally use services from its public cloud and began to acquire local partners as part of a new cloud partner program.\n\nFor the local use of its global cloud, Oracle, in particular, at the end of 2016 introduced the Oracle Cloud Machine service from the Oracle Cloud at Customer portfolio (\"Oracle Cloud at the Customer\"), on the basis of which it offered customers to receive IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services from their public Oracle Cloud, deploying it on the customer's territory.\n\nThe client is provided with the equipment and support necessary for this. In terms of functionality, cloud services that become available to the client according to this model do not differ from the global public cloud based in foreign Oracle data centers around the world.\n\nWe are talking about a combination of equipment and service rental as such: at the request of the customer, a \"piece\" of the Oracle cloud can be placed in its own computing center, - explained earlier the regional director of Oracle in Russia and SNGOleg Zhukov[14]\n\nPreviously, Oracle customers had two options for obtaining vendor applications from the cloud: buying software licenses and deploying them at their own facilities (private cloud) or subscribing to a service in the Oracle Cloud public cloud deployed in its foreign data centers. This somewhat constrained the growth of the cloud business for Oracle in Russia.\n\nRussian clients, especially large ones, are extremely sensitive to information security issues, and many are not ready to transfer their data to a foreign data center, especially against the background of the current geopolitical situation. In some industries, the peculiarities of Russian legislation, which prescribes to store personal data of Russian citizens in Russia, also play a role.\n\nThe launch of Cloud Machine has become a growth driver for the cloud business, the company said in July 2017. According to Oleg Zhukov, with the introduction of this service to the market, the demand for the company's cloud services in Russia has increased significantly, and it has \"high expectations\" for the growth of this business in 2017.\n\nAt the same time, Oracle did not disclose sales indicators for cloud services in Russia. The company only says that in Russia it has the most significant \"digital indicators\" in the EMEA region in terms of Cloud Machine sales, and the total number of cloud clients in Russia (this includes those who deployed Oracle applications in private clouds) is measured in \"three digits.\"\n\nOracle told TAdviser that among the most popular of its cloud applications and technologies in Russia - about 15 services. Among them are solutions for talent management. Many companies are now interested in a comprehensive assessment of personnel and remuneration depending on the result, the Oracle notes.\n\nThe technologies of the Internet of things, databases, CX solutions (customer experience, customer experience) and digital marketing, Oracle Revenue Management Cloud (for managing contracts with customers), etc. are also in particular demand.\n\nThe company notes the demand for its cloud services in all industries, but above all - from companies engaged in retail, telecom, the financial sector, industry. There is interest in the clouds from oil and gas companies. Very small companies, startups are also interested in them.\n\nTo strengthen the cloud direction, Oracle introduced the global Oracle Cloud Managed Service Provider (MSP) program in 2016. Russia became one of the first countries where it started. In 2017, Softline became the first MSP partner in Russia and one of the first ten in the world.\n\nAccording to Oleg Zhukov, in the case of Softline, the co-orientation of development strategies played a role: \"Softline, like us, connects its growth and development with cloud services.\"[15] According to Softline, for several years every year their company has almost doubled the provision of cloud services.\n\nOracle says that in mid-2017 in Russia it has two more MSP partners in Russia, but their names have not yet been disclosed. In corporate presentations, Force also indicates itself as a specialized MSP partner. The third partner is Borlas, which was told to TAdviser in the company itself.\n\nIt should be noted that Oracle deliberately does not seek to increase the number of MSP partners - we carefully approach their choice: it is partners who provide the highest level of services that are required, and there are few of them, - said Oleg Zhukov in July.\n\nThe development of the cloud direction in Russia is in line with Oracle's global strategy. At the end of the 2017 fiscal year, which ended for Oracle on May 31, the cloud was the fastest growing business for the company. The total cloud revenues of the vendor increased by 60% and amounted to $4.6 billion, which corresponds to 12% in the total turnover of Oracle. At the same time, the highest growth rates were shown by the SaaS direction: it grew by 61%, to $3.2 billion.\n\nAccording to TAdviser, the Russian cloud services market in 2016 amounted to about 29 billion rubles. The high growth rates of this market over the past few years have been noted by both analysts and service providers.\n\nEarlier than Oracle, SAP implemented the opportunity for Russian customers to use their cloud services locally. To do this, the company followed the path of creating its own data center in Russia, it was launched in 2014. At the end of 2016, SAP reported on \"three-digit\" growth rates of sales of cloud services in Russia. Among the cloud applications for which there was the greatest demand in Russia, the company named similar in functionality to those mentioned by Oracle. This, for example, is a solution for managing personnel resources SuccessFactors (it was called a \"sales hit\" in Russia by the company).\n\nOracle believes that one of its advantages over competing cloud service providers is the ability to offer customers a full range of cloud infrastructure and applications from a single vendor: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, including databases, solutions for the Internet of Things, digital marketing, sales, etc.\n\nIn the fall of 2017, following the provision of cloud services \"infrastructure as a service\" (IaaS) and \"platform as a service\" (PaaS), Oracle brought the service \"business applications as a service\" to the Russian market (SaaS), thereby covering all categories of its solutions that customers will be able to use in their data centers in our country, but through the public cloud of a foreign vendor[16]\n\nThe company says that its SaaS services cover all aspects of the enterprise's activities - resource planning (Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP), human capital management (Human Capital Management, HCM), customer experience management (Customer Experience, CX) and supply chain management (Supply Chain Management, SCM). According to Oleg Poretsky, Director of the Oracle Business Applications Department in Russia, the vendor has about 1,000 Russified SaaS services in total.\n\nThese services were previously available to customers by purchasing software licenses with their own capacity deployed, as well as by subscribing to the service in a public cloud managed by Oracle. Now, as before through the platform and infrastructure, it is possible to use enterprise applications in the third way. Within its framework, services will also work on Oracle server power, as in the company's standard public cloud (there will be no functional differences), but all data will be encrypted, encryption keys will be stored by the customer, and the actions of Oracle administrators will be logged.\n\nClosing of the development center in St. Petersburg\n\nMay 16, 2017 it became known about the departure of Oracle from St. Petersburg. The company is transferring a development center located in the city to India, RBC reports citing IT market participants.\n\nThe head of the company, First Line Software Alexander Pozdnyakov who received this information from former Oracle employees, spoke about the termination of Oracle's activities in St. Petersburg. The general director of the St. Petersburg development center Dell EMC Vyacheslav Nesterov noted that many Oracle employees appeared on the labor market.\n\nAccording to Alexander Pozdnyakov, the departure of Oracle from St. Petersburg threatens the company with serious image problems for the region. The presence of Oracle or Dell EMC in St. Petersburg allows customers to think that they are placing development \"not just in a strange IT place, but in a completely authoritative region.\" The fewer Western players in the city, the worse for local companies, Pozdnyakov is sure.\n\nThe head of Raidix, Andrei Fedorov, associates the transfer of the St. Petersburg Oracle development center to India with a wide difference in the cost of labor.\n\nToday, even young St. Petersburg programmers often want a salary in the region of 250 thousand rubles. A Western company that can count its money may decide that such an overheated labor market is unacceptable for it, \"Fedorov told the publication.\n\nRecall that back in 2015, Oracle told TAdviser about the increase in recruitment to the development center in St. Petersburg (see below).\n\nThe gradual reduction in the scale of business in St. Petersburg may reflect the political position of the parent company Oracle in relation to Russia, believes the president of Russoft Valentin Makarov.\n\nOracle was among the first American companies to respond to the imposition of economic sanctions. The organization refused to serve a number of Russian enterprises, including St. Petersburg Vodokanal. It is possible that the decision to transfer developments from St. Petersburg to India is also associated with a difficult geopolitical situation, Makarov said.[17]\n\n2016: Oleg Zhukov appointed Head of Representative Office\n\nOn June 1, 2016, Oleg Zhukov took up his duties as regional director of Oracle Systems in Russia and the CIS. His responsibility includes the promotion of Oracle technologies in the Russian market, general management and interaction of business units operating under a single Oracle brand in the region. In this position, Oleg Zhukov is responsible for the implementation of the company's strategy, corporate tasks and initiatives for fiscal 2017, taking into account the emerging opportunities and features of the market in Russia and the CIS. It continues to grow and strengthen its business across all product areas, strengthening Oracle's strategic focus as a provider of cloud solutions offered in all categories - PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS.\n\nMaria Orlovskaya, who served as regional director of Oracle in Russia, was on maternity leave as of June 2016.\n\n2015\n\nOracle does not observe sharp changes in demand for its products in Russia\n\nOracle does not plan to change its strategy in Russia due to the course of import substitution in the country and state support for Russian software developers, Valery Lanovenko, vice president of Oracle in the CIS, told TAdviser in November 2015. He noted that there are initiatives to support the use of locally produced products - IT or any other products - in almost every country, especially in a large one.\n\n\"Oracle does\n\nnot plan to bypass them. The company is adapting to the situation and business in Russia will go as usual, only with more formalized requirements, \"Lanovenko said\n\n.\n\nRegarding the register of Russian software, which since 2016 will receive preferences on public procurement, he noted that there are many questions about what to consider Russian: \"I hope that in this case, people who make decisions will make the right, rational, economically sound decision.\"\n\nValery Lanovenko added that there are cases where the use of local technologies \"is necessary, justified and more effective\":\n\n\"I think that in each specific case, the customer, mainly concerned with government customers, needs to make a decision, which is more effective.\"\n\nEarlier, TAdviser wrote about a number of PostgreSQL open source migration projects from Oracle to DBMS that took place over the past few months. Among them are projects at the Federal Nuclear Center, at the regional level of the Moscow Region, at Otkritie Bank. Lanovenko notes that Oracle is not observing sharp changes in demand for its products in Russia now, and that it would be wrong to talk about competitors, including PostgreSQL.\n\n\"We tell customers about the possibilities of our technologies, about the release of new solutions. New versions of our DBMS began to be released more often, and we still remain the world leader by a wide margin from competitors. Those who considered it necessary to use a strong platform proven by time on high loads, we continue to cooperate with those customers, \"he\n\nsaid.\n\nValery Lanovenko added that Oracle continues to invest in the development of its business in Russia, including infrastructure, technical support, the development of a partner network, and the client must \"respond to these investments.\"\n\nOracle calls its own public cloud services PaaS and SaaS, which the company began to actively promote in Russia in 2015, one of the priority areas for business development in Russia. They are provided on the basis of one of the foreign Oracle data centers located in Europe. Lanovenko noted that so far such services are \"hard to perceive\" in Russia, but the company sees an increasing openness of customers to such services. According to him, clients mainly transfer the development and testing of their software to the Oracle cloud in Russia.\n\nOracle has not yet planned to open its own data center, as it did, for example, SAP, to provide cloud services on its basis. At the same time, the company told TAdviser that they periodically assess the feasibility and economic effectiveness of such a step.\n\nOther priorities include the development of Oracle engineering systems projects. Valery Lanovenko notes that their use is no longer \"exotic,\" but becomes mainstream. The focus is also on moving clients to the latest version of the DBMS - Oracle Database 12c and selling SPARC servers based on the M7 processor, which were recently released.\n\nIncrease in staff at the development center in St. Petersburg\n\nIn November 2015, Oracle told TAdviser that they had increased the staff of their development center in St. Petersburg in a year. The exact number of staff in the company is not named, but they note that it is expanding as the tasks are being performed. The list of software, in the development of which Russian engineers are now involved, has expanded significantly: the Russian team is fully responsible for Java ME and for part of Java SE and participates in the development:\n\nMySQL,\n\nOracle Solaris Studio,\n\nOracle JDeveloper,\n\nOracle Unbreakable Linux,\n\nVirtualBox,\n\nOracle Stream Explorer.\n\nThe hardware department does not submit reports to the Internal Revenue Service\n\nAs Kommersant wrote in the issue of October 26, 2015, for more than a year now Oracle Computer Equipment CJSC (part of Oracle Corporation), which sells servers and other hardware, does not submit reports to the tax office and does not carry out transactions on bank accounts.\n\nThe press service of the Federal Tax Service of Russia in Moscow told the newspaper that a legal entity is excluded from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities if, within three months from the date of publication of the message, the agency does not receive statements from an inactive person, creditors or other persons whose rights and legitimate interests are affected by this decision.\n\nMikhail Alexandrov, partner of the A2 law firm, considers Oracle's actions strange when the company actually abandons its Russian subsidiary, although it is easier and cheaper to close it. Long-term failure to submit tax reports may threaten Oracle with account blocking and the appointment of an on-site tax audit, the lawyer says.\n\nAccording to official data, in the fiscal year 2015, closed on May 31, 2015, Oracle earned 14% of the total turnover on the hardware business. Former head of NVision Group Anton Sushkevich estimates the annual revenue of the manufacturer in Russia at $1 billion. This means that sales of Oracle equipment in the Russian Federation can be measured at approximately $140 million[18]\n\n2011: Annual revenue of $150 million\n\nAccording to the estimate of the source in CNews the management of the IT company that cooperates with him, the Oracle total revenue of the vendor in the region in fiscal 2011 is at the level of $150 million#[19]\n\n\"Since Russia continues to be an iron market, the share of equipment here is higher than the global one and for Oracle, I think it exceeds a third of revenue,\" the CNews source said. - DBMS accounts for more than half. The hardware dynamics are definitely positive, since Sun's financial problems, due to which the company was sold, have recently prevented it from doing business effectively. \"\n\nDuring the 2011 fiscal year (ending May 31), more than 2,500 CIS enterprises purchased Oracle technologies, applications and equipment. A dozen of the best-selling Russia products in the CIS are known. This is the first such information since the closing of the transaction with. Sun The leading position (database management systems DBMS Oracle) remained unshakable, but otherwise the purchase of a well-known server manufacturer and developer Java predictably seriously changed the sales structure. \"The first year of Oracle's hardware business in Russia showed the demand among customers of most categories of equipment,\" the company said.\n\nDozens of the region's best-selling products in 2010 and 2011\n\n2011 2010 1 Database, including Oracle Exadata 1 Database 2 SPARC Enterprise M Series Servers 2\n\n|Siebel CRM\n\n3 Oracle Fusion Middleware family, including Oracle Exalogic 3 Oracle E-Business Suite 4 ERP systems 4\n\n|Oracle EPM System (EPM+BI )\n\n5 storage systems 5 Oracle Application Servers 6 DBMS options 6 Oracle Master Data Management 7 CRM systems; 7 Oracle Identity Management 8 servers SPARC Enterprise T Series 8 Oracle SOA Suite 9 x86 Servers 9 Oracle Content Management 10 Oracle EPM System (EPM+BI) 10 Oracle Information Rights Management\n\nSource: Oracle\n\nTrue, the commercial director of SAS in Russia, Sergei Lobov, is cautious about the top ten Oracle. \"From a marketing point of view, you can stimulate demand by declaring the actual situation the company needs,\" he said.\n\nBusiness Applications and Industry Solutions\n\nIn fiscal 2011, about 100 companies became Oracle customers for business applications. With significant growth in all lines of business applications and in all key industries, ERP systems became the leader in sales. Customers focus on both full-scale projects based on the latest version of Oracle E-Buisness Suite R12, as well as solving the most critical business problems based on best practices, including transportation management Oracle Transportation Management and supply chain optimization Oracle Strategic Network Optimization, etc.\n\nAccording to the results of 2007, the company ranked second in the Russian market of enterprise management systems with a share of 14.9%. In 2009, its share in this market decreased to 9.6%.\n\nThe Oracle Siebel CRM platform was chosen to build almost all large customer relationship management systems in Russian banks during the 2011 and 2010 financial years. The customer base of the industry complexes Oracle Retail, Oracle Utilities, Oracle Communications, Oracle FLEXCUBE, as well as Oracle Primavera, Oracle CRM On Demand, business applications Oracle JD Edwards EnterpriseOne has expanded. The demand for a new class of Oracle Master Data Management solutions has grown, which give companies a single tool for managing enterprise master data (regulatory reference information), as well as ready-made analytical applications Oracle BI Applications, pre-integrated with ERP and CRM.\n\nCustomer interest in enterprise performance management systems remains consistently high. Companies in a wide range of industries and businesses have taken advantage of the Oracle EPM System enterprise performance management business platform in the year ended. Leading in the creation of consolidation and budgeting systems for the military-industrial complex, the oil and gas industry, the trade and distribution sector.\n\nDBMS and Binding Layer Technologies\n\nIn the Oracle Fusion Middleware family of bundling software, the demand for Oracle Identity Management credential and access management technologies has increased many times and its structure has become qualitatively enriched. Customers are interested in comprehensive enterprise information security management and rely on Oracle solutions to do so. In oil and gas, telecommunications companies and power and utilities in more than other industries, the flagship line of Oracle application servers, combined into the WebLogic Suite, was in demand. Oracle SOA Suite, on the basis of which the company's IT infrastructure is built in different industries, confidently holds the position in the top three in sales among connecting technologies. The leaders in the use of SOA in the 2011 financial year were the financial and telecom sectors.\n\nOracle Database's leading position is underpinned by new successes. The systematic expansion of the customer base under DBMS in fiscal year 2011 was supplemented by increased demand for options to it. Customers made a choice not only in favor of the characteristics of a powerful, productive and reliable kernel, but also with a focus on a wide additional functionality, supplied in the form of a set of options, justifiably seeing in this approach a source of additional profit.\n\nHardware and Software Products\n\nThe key driver of the growth of Oracle's hardware business is the ability to offer the customer a complete solution from a single manufacturer with a full range of IT components from applications to disk, optimized for better efficiency and availability. Traditionally, SPARC/Solaris technologies are in focus. Systems with the SPARC T3 processor, the first sixteen-core computing platform in the world, announced in September 2010, have become one of the best-selling in the CIS.\n\nThe demand for the classic line of SPARC Enterpise M-series systems, designed to build corporate data centers, has grown. The updated Sun Fire x86 servers demonstrated record performance levels for a number of key Oracle applications and technologies and were appreciated by many customers when choosing an effective consolidation and virtualization platform. Storage systems based on tiered storage were the most popular in fiscal year 2011, including components such as Flash arrays, Unified Storage, and tape libraries.\n\nOracle software and hardware products were in demand in fiscal 2011 in most industries, including the public and financial sectors, telecom and media, power, oil, chemical, petrochemical, metallurgy, transportation, distribution, and retail. The to trade TOR-100 of the largest customers of the year included 81 Russian companies, 11 enterprises from Ukraine, 7 organizations from Kazakhstan and 1 from Belarus.

According to the data, TAdviser as of October 2008 Russia , 87 implementation projects were implemented (ERP 10th Oracle place in terms of the number of ERP projects).\n\n1994: First official representative in Russia\n\nThe successes of the first Oracle distributor led to Russia in 1994 and the first official representative of the company - Andreas Hart. At the same time, Oracle clients in Russia became such powerful structures as the FSB, the Cabinet of Ministers, Mosprivatization, the Ministry of Railways, RAO UES, etc.\n\n2004: 1.5-fold increase in license sales\n\nAccording to the results of 2004, Oracle's office in Russia and the CIS was included in the top three Oracle representative offices in terms of growth rates in the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and for the fifth year in a row - in the top five among 145 Oracle representative offices in the world. Sales of licenses in the CIS increased by more than 1.5 times compared to the previous year.\n\nIn fiscal year 2004, Oracle in Russia and the CIS strengthened its position in the DBMS market and took a leading position in the enterprise management systems market. In 2004, more than 950 companies acquired Oracle's core technologies. Among the largest clients of 2004 are Sberbank of the Russian Federation, Ingosstrakh, MTS, VimpelCom, Megafon, and the Moscow government.\n\n1988: Ellison's threats against the USSR\n\nOracle Larry Ellison The chapter has always been skeptical of the USSR. In 1988, in the American journal Datamation database technologies, Ellison even stated that Oracle Russia would deliver missiles with nuclear warheads - Oracle systems were then intensively used Ministry of Defence USA[21]\n\nHowever, just a year after Larry Ellison's scandalous statement, Oracle products entered the USSR in a completely civilized way. The Oracle booth appeared at the Automation-89 exhibition in the fall of 1989.\n\nIn the early 1990s, when Oracle DBMS was already distributed in the CIS on a commercial basis, local distributors did the Russification of Oracle products on their own. And only the fact that Oracle by that time had been \"walking\" around the Union for a long time in an unlicensed form helped to immediately recruit very high-class specialists into the company. For example, the Russification of Oracle Office, which the American giant later bought, was made by enthusiasts from the Soviet scientific community.\n\n1984: Illegal use in the USSR\n\nUntil the early 1990s, there was no question of official supplies of Oracle products to the USSR. The software market did not exist, and it was impossible to install American software in the USSR through state channels - such developments were considered strategically important in the United States. There was a special body - the coordination committee for export control, which prevented the export of high technologies from NATO countries to the countries of Eastern Europe. Therefore, since version 3, Oracle was imported and copied illegally, and by the mid-80s the American system worked at a fairly large number of enterprises and scientific institutes of the USSR. One of the most advanced research centers was the All-Russian Research Institute of Systems Research (VNIISI), where Oracle got in 1984. From that moment on, the history of Oracle in Russia begins.\n\nOracle also worked at the world's largest particle accelerator at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IFVE), which is located in Protvin near Moscow. No one forced Soviet scientists to implement it, but it so happened that Oracle supplanted all other DBMS. The fact is that all physical laboratories in the world work in cooperation and try to standardize their solutions in order to facilitate the exchange of information and programs. IBM in physical laboratories lost at one time to DEC. And as long as Oracle was multi-platform and worked on DEC's VAX systems, scientists immediately adopted it.\n\nThe fate of Oracle in the Soviet scientific community predetermined the fate of the company in the Russian market. The 1980s became a period of Oracle's \"indirect investments in the Russian market,\" but Oracle management looks at this time differently.
