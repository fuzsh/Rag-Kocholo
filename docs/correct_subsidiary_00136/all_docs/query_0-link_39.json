        "text": "I hate to be \"cheeky\" re: Global Trade and protectionist policies that run rampant in many countries...whether they are subsidies to farmers, steel mills or technology; or protectionist duties; or back-room deals. Well, here it is: For cheap goods, Ocean Freight rates can make more of an impact to a county's trade balance than most duties do. Prime example, the Section 301 tariff for many Chinese goods coming into the USA. If one can get 100,000 units into an Ocean Container and each unit costs $0.15...the 25% tariff from Section 301 equates to $3,750. If the Ocean rate for this container goes from $1,800 to $6,000...that's $4,200...an even bigger incentive. Combine them and you have further upward price pressure on the consumer (but that's another post...) This is happening again folks...ocean rates are exploding again due to both the Red Sea crisis and Ocean Shipping companies playing with capacity. So regardless of if one imports that specific material or product from a country where there is a tariff or one that does not have any tariffs...the Ocean rate can have a bigger impact.\n\nI spent last week with a small but powerful cohort of amazing individuals at the Sustainable Herbs Learning Journey in Southern Oregon. The people that I shared this experience are all forward looking, as are the companies they founded and work for. I am proud to work for a company that aligns with not only the ideals of this program, but also the shared mission to improve people, place and planet. Thank you to everyone who participated, contributed and shared. I look forward to working with each and every one of you to strengthen the Herbal products community."
