        "meta_description": "In this episode of the IoT For All Podcast, Andrew Cullen, Director of Marine Connectivity at Yamaha, and Alex Joseph, Chief Technology Officer at Siren Marine, join Ryan Chacon to discuss IoT in the marine industry. The conversation covers the evolving landscape of connected boating, Yamaha's journey into IoT with the acquisition of Siren Marine, the challenges and solutions in developing IoT products for the marine environment, the significance of data, predictive maintenance, and the future of connected boating.\n\nAndrew Cullen is the Director of Marine Connectivity at Yamaha. Previously, Cullen managed digital marketing and communications for Yamaha’s WaveRunner and Boat product lines. He also directed digital strategy for Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit Boat companies and subsidiaries. Cullen has held numerous board positions in the technology, marine, and watersports industries, and has been recognized with multiple marine and technology marketing and innovation awards related to digital marketing, mobile applications, CRM programs, and website development.\n\nAlex Joseph is the Chief Technology Officer at Siren Marine where he designs the product hardware and software architecture, identifies key technologies, fosters strategic partnerships, and assembles the right development teams. He brings with him relevant experience from two distinct fields, aviation and electronics/software. He has previously worked in the aviation industry as a pilot and flight instructor. He has a Bachelor's degree in computer science from Pennsylvania Western University - Clarion.\nYamaha U.S. Marine Business Unit, based in Kennesaw, Georgia, markets and sells marine outboard motors ranging in size from 2.5 to 450 horsepower. It also engineers, manufactures, markets, and sells boat control systems, IoT control devices, fiberglass, jet-drive sport boats ranging from 19 to 27 feet, and personal watercraft. The Marine Connected division, which includes the Siren Marine subsidiary, allows boaters to stay connected to their boats anywhere, anytime. The company’s vision is to transform the modern boating experience and lead the way to a fully-connected marine industry through innovative IoT Connected Boat technology.This is achieved through the Siren Connected Boat app that combines real-time vessel security, multiple and flexible boat monitoring and tracking functions, and convenience features including remote digital switching. Through the mobile app, customers have access to and the ability to control all of these features from their smartphones or smart watches. The flagship device is the Siren 3 Pro that includes vital standard features every boat owner or fleet operator needs, such as battery monitoring, GPS position tracking, and geo-fencing. From there, customers can customize their Siren 3 Pro system by adding a desired combination of wired and wireless sensors to monitor those functions and areas most important to them.\n\nDiscover more about IoT at https://www.iotforall.com\nMore about Yamaha: https://www.yamahaboats.com\nMore about Siren Marine: https://sirenmarine.com\nConnect with Andrew: https://www.linkedin.com/in/acullen1/\nOur sponsor: https://www.routethis.com/\n\n(00:00) Sponsor\n(00:40) Intro\n(00:52) Andrew Cullen and Alex Joseph\n(03:17) The evolution of connected boating\n(06:03) Yamaha's strategic vision\n(12:32) Predictive maintenance and future of marine IoT\n(13:43) Challenges in IoT maritime solutions\n(20:35) Yamaha's journey into IoT\n(29:08) Learn more and follow up\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE CHANNEL: https://bit.ly/2NlcEwm​\nJoin Our Newsletter: https://www.iotforall.com/iot-newsletter\nFollow Us on Social: https://linktr.ee/iot4all\nCheck out the IoT For All Media Network:\nhttps://www.iotforall.com/podcast-overview",
