        "text": "Purpose – Decision support (DS), as a traditional management concept, have had a remarkable role in competitiveness or survival of organizations and nowadays, business intelligence (BI), as a brand modern impression, has various contributions in supporting decision-making process. Although, a variety of benefits are expected to arise from BI functions, researches, and models that determining the effect of BI functions on the decisional and organizational benefits are rare. The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between BI functions, DS benefits, and organizational benefits in context of decision environment. Design/methodology/approach – This research conducts a quantitative survey-based study to represent the relationship between BI capabilities, decision support benefits, and organizational benefits in context of decision environment. On this basis, the partial least squares (PLS) technique employs a sample of 228 firms from different industries located in Middle-E...\n\nThis research examined the factors that contributed to the use of information from a business intelligence system (BIS) in management decision making and the relationship to organisation and business process performance. Business intelligence (BI) is a timely topic, as organisations continue to invest in systems to leverage big data and gain sustainable competitive advantage. Few studies have examined whether organisational performance benefits result from management use of information from the BIS in decision-making processes. This research surveyed 259 managers with access to a BIS for use in their decision-making processes. A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to analyse the results. The global model indicated that the ​use of information from the BIS in management decision making contributed to organisational performance benefits. Information content quality, information access quality, and analytical decision-making culture contributed to use of information in the global model.\n\nTurbulent times are a part of modern-day business, and the way a companyhandles disruptive events determines its success. Various technological tools have beendeveloped to help businesses overcome unforeseen and anticipated events that may impact thebusiness. One such technological tool is business intelligent systems, which help to gather dataregarding business operations and environment turning it into information that can be clearlyunderstood. Large companies have adopted the use of these big data analytic systems, but mostsmall and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lag behind. There is little information on howbusiness intelligence systems impact SME businesses. This study examined the impact ofbusiness intelligence systems on organizational decision-making and performance. The studyconsists of an empirical qualitative research that was carried out with interviews of 200members of 10 selected SMEs. The study found out that when BI systems are deployed in SMEs,they facilitate timel...\n\nThis research article explores the influence of integrating business intelligence on project efficiency, focusing on a case study in Turkey. With the increasing competition in the market due to international trade development, the use of business intelligence has become crucial for organizations to stay competitive and reduce risk levels. The study examines how real-time data and reporting through business intelligence tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Microsoft Project can enhance project management processes and decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of timely and data-driven decision-making in project environments to achieve better outcomes and cost control. Purpose-To investigate the role of business intelligence in project management and to analyze how the integration of business intelligence impacts project cost and financial reporting efficiency. Methodology-The study likely includes a review of relevant literature, case studies, and possibly interviews or surveys with industry professionals to gather insights on the impact of business intelligence integration on project cost and financial reporting efficiency. Additionally, the research may involve the use of data analysis tools such as Microsoft Project, Tableau, Excel, Jira, and Power BI to examine project data and generate insights. Findings-While the specific findings regarding the impact of business intelligence integration on project cost and financial reporting efficiency are not explicitly stated in the provided excerpts, it can be inferred that the research aimed to reveal insights on how the implementation of business intelligence tools influences project cost management and enhances financial reporting efficiency. The potential findings may involve identifying key factors that contribute to cost optimization, improved decisionmaking processes, and enhanced project performance through the application of business intelligence in project management. Conclusion-The study focuses on the role of business intelligence in project management, particularly in relation to project cost management and financial reporting efficiency. The research likely involves a thorough analysis of how the integration of business intelligence tools and techniques can impact decision-making processes, cost optimization, and overall project performance. By utilizing data analysis tools such as Microsoft Project, Tableau, Excel, Jira, and Power BI, the study aims to generate insights that can help companies operating in Turkey improve their project management practices through real-time dashboard reporting and data-driven decision-making. Overall, the research underscores the importance of leveraging business intelligence in project management to enhance efficiency, optimize costs, and facilitate better decision-making processes in organizations.\n\nThe concept of Business Intelligence (BI) approaches several technologies that aim at arranging the extraction and visualization of information, and just like in a competitive company the university management must also update itself, therefore adopting the use of processes that aid and speed decision making. Information Systems (IS) are indispensable elements and should mean more than the processing of routine activities, thereby starting to contribute to a strategic vision. The Western State University of Paraná (UNIOESTE) has many IS, but its users still face difficulties in extracting information in the desired format. Thus, this paper reports the outcomes of a research developed during the dissertation of a Master&#39;s Degree on Information Technology Management which is aimed at researching BI technologies. More specifically the Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), as well as implementing an operation prototype that could facilitate the retrieval of information from the dean’...\n\nBusiness intelligence is a set of theories, methodologies, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information for business purposes. An operational BI system helps non-technical users with very fast and intuitive ways of processing and viewing data. The main goal of a BI initiative is to turn a company&#39;s information into a structured and analyzable perspective - in other words, real business intelligence, which can inform the decision-making process within the company. Through this study, we want to identify the advantages and limitations of business intelligence solutions perceived by the Romanian companies, as well as its use as a managerial tool for observing the evolution of business, its impact on managerial decisions, and the ease with which managers can use it. By using Business Intelligence, you can eliminate inefficient bottlenecks, refine existing business processes, automate routine tasks, and introduce new levels of work or..."
