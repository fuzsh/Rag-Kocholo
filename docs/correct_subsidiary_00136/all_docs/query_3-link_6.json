Plan to Produce Process Flow Sales: • Understanding the market trends • Taking order from the customers • Demand planning and demand forecasting Planning: • Master production schedule is prepared • MRP of the product is decided • Capacity planning • Finite scheduling changes from time to time Production: • Actual production takes place • Aspects like quality aspects, logistics and the final shipment of the product to the customer is taken care of\n\n4. Oracle Plan to Produce Solution • Oracle Plan to Produce solution is a comprehensive and integrated suite of supply chain cloud applications which includes Manufacturing, Inventory, and Cost ManagementCloud plus PlanningCentral Cloud. • Desktop, tablet, mobile, scanning and social technologies are combined to provide a state- of-the-art cloud solution for manufacturing companies\n\n5. PLAN – Oracle Supply Chain Planning Cloud Resource Requirement Planning - Uses forecasts to estimate the time and resources that are needed to make a product Master Production Schedule – Plans and schedules the products that the company expects to manufacture. Forecasts are one MPS input that help determine demand before you complete the production plans. Master Requirement Planning – An ordering and scheduling process that breaks down the requirements of all MPS parent items to the component levels.You can also use forecasts as input for lower level MRP components that are service parts with independent demand. Distribution Requirement Planning – A management system that plans and controls the distribution of finished goods. You can use forecasts as input for DRP to more accurately plan the demand that you supply through distribution\n\n6. MAKE – Oracle Manufacturing Cloud Oracle Manufacturing Cloud provides an easy way to define and manage master data, manage shop floor operations, plan and track manufacturing costs, and provides holistic supply chain visibility. Manufacturing Cloud presents the production process visually, combining the Bill of Material and Routing into an integrated graphical view. Production Supervisors use a control centre that gives them a quick look at critical information.They can resolve issues with-one click and can drill into the details and take action - designed for use on a tablet. Additional advanced fulfilment features include contract manufacturing, back-to- back shipments, and configure-to-order.\n\n7. OPTIMIZE – Oracle Manufacturing Intelligence Leverage systems and analytics for visibility, agility, customer responsiveness and complex global accounting Plant Floor Data Analysis- Continuously collect data from the shop floor and synchronize it with data from your ERP system. Strategic cost management- Transform your operations with real-time access to complex analyses of untapped and underutilized costing data. Manufacturing analytics- Optimize your supply networks by integrating data from across the enterprise value chain, enabling users to make informed manufacturing decisions. Manufacturing Operational costs- Meet customer expectations and improve productivity with actionable, real-time shop floor information.\n\n8. OracleValue Chain Planning: Production Scheduling ■ Oracle Production Scheduling enables you to create detailed, up-to-the-minute schedules that enable you to produce the right amount of product when it is needed, thereby maximizing service, minimizing inventory, sequence dependent setups, expediting, and other undesirable costs ■ Oracle Production Scheduling enables control of production scheduling problem, and helps to maximize shop floor throughput while optimizing resource investment. ■ Key benefits – – Maximize production throughput – Increase resource utilization – Reduce manufacturing costs ■ In addition, it can leverage the out-of-the-box integration with the Oracle ERP to implement quickly and get immediate value.\n\n9. Maximize throughput & increase resource utilization Oracle Production Scheduling calculates feasible and realistic schedules that consider your key manufacturing constraints. It automatically detects bottlenecks and ensures the flow of production through the bottleneck to maximize the productive throughput while synchronizing all the stages of production. It can also easily identify specific issues and take corrective action Production Scheduling can automatically sequence production to minimize setup time while still meeting all requirements on time. Improve shop floor performance It provides the shop with a feasible schedule that is executable, and considers all the production constraints. Interactive drag and drop rescheduling and fast interactive simulation enable quick try out and assess ways to rectify problems. After refining the schedule, it can be approved for release to the production floor for execution. A dispatch list can be published that enables each operator or work center to view a prioritized list of work.\n\n12. Determine the best schedule through interactive simulation Oracle Production Scheduling enables easy evaluation of one or more schedules based on multiple metrics. It provides many pre-seeded key performance indicators by which the schedule quality can be assessed. It can also quickly compare schedules and what-if scenarios to identify the schedule that best meets the business objectives. Comprehensive manufacturing planning and scheduling Tight integration between Oracle E- Business Suite, OracleAdvanced Supply Chain Planning, and Oracle Production Scheduling. You can use Production Scheduling to schedule production orders or process batches maintenance visits and work orders, or you can decide to simultaneously plan both production and planned orders fromAdvanced Supply Chain Planning. Once the schedule is refined and finalized the scheduler can either release it to execution or publish the planned production orders back to Advanced Supply Chain Planning\n\n13. Honor complex inter work order relationships in Maintenance Visits Maintenance activities for complex assets often involve the coordination of hundreds of different tasks within the overall umbrella of a specific maintenance visit for the asset. Oracle Production Scheduling supports a maintenance work order scheduling process that allows maintenance schedulers to view all the maintenance tasks within the schedule, their inter-relationships, the associated resources and materials and respect inter-work order relationships and other complex constraints when scheduling work orders. Create feasible schedule honoring material and resource constraints Maintenance work orders use human resources as well as equipment. Oracle Production Scheduling enables a constraint based finite scheduling process that creates a feasible maintenance schedule accounting for equipment availability/downtime, material availability, lead times and other detailed constraints such as work order relationships. Maintenance Schedulers have an easy to use yet powerful and interactive user interface\n\n14. Oracle Manufacturing Operations Center ■ Extensible Role-based Dashboards and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ■ Analyze Production Loss and Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) ■ Increase ProductionThroughput ■ Improve Manufacturing Service Levels ■ Monitor Production Processes and Equipment Performance ■ Correlation between process parameters and equipment output and status\n\n17. Oracle Cost management ■ Oracle's Cost Impact Simulator and Gross Profit Analyzer combine to help businesses perform a range of functions not possible previously because of the long wait times associated with batch processing of Big Data. ■ Oracle’s Cost Impact Simulator and Gross Profit Analyzer help organizations maximize revenue and increase profits ■ Perform detailed ‘what-if’ cost simulations and timely analyses of cost and related inventory valuations.\n\n19. Success Stories Closed month-end reports in one week, instead of 20 days Reduced the monthly sales-close cycle by 10 days Shortened the vendor payment cycle from 90 days to around 30 to 45 days Increased inventory turnover and reduced inventory costs Gained knowledge of and control over cash positions by monitoring branch office receipts in real time\n\n20. Enabled accounts staff to generate financial reports almost immediately Prevented staff from making unauthorized purchases by providing complete control over the procurement of office items and raw materials Improved customer service levels Provided insight into inventory at construction sites, which ensured staff always had the right amount of stock and projects were completed on time"
