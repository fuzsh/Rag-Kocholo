Booking history, price list, currency, calendars, users, and items collected from the E-Business Suite applications are loaded into Oracle Demantra. Forecasts and accuracy measures return.\n\nOracle supports the following configurations:\n\nSingle instance. The single instance would include ERP, Advanced Planning and Scheduling, and Oracle Demantra. It must be a supported combination of E-Business Suite and Oracle Demantra releases. Please contact support for an up-to-date list of certified versions for integration.\n\nSeparate destination and non-legacy source instances. The destination instance and the source instance must both be Demantra-certified combinations of ERP and Advanced Planning and Scheduling.\n\nSeparate destination and legacy source instances.The destination instance must be a Demantra-certified version of Advanced Planning and Scheduling.\n\nTerms and Conventions Used in this Document\n\nLevels control how data is aggregated and organized. Levels are used in worksheets, in filters, in import and export, and in forecasting. A level member refers to a unit within a level. For example, \"tollhouse\" is a member of a level named \"cookies\". A hierarchy organizes levels into ranks. The top level in the hierarchy provides the most aggregate, general view of information. The bottom level provides the most disaggregate, specific view of information. Your application can include multiple, independent hierarchies. Each hierarchy can contain as many levels as needed.\n\nWithin Oracle Demantra, you generally apply a filter by specifying a level and the members of that level that you want to display in a worksheet.\n\nA worksheet, sometimes known as a query, is the primary user interface to Oracle Demantra data. For example, within a worksheet, a user can examine and edit data as needed, view the forecast, run simulations, and save changes back to the database.\n\nOur use of the terms download and upload here are always relative to the E-Business Suite, or a similar legacy system. In other words, download procedures move information from an E-Business Suite application, while upload procedures move information from Oracle Demantra to the E-Business Suite, or a legacy system.\n\nWhen we discuss the source we are referring the E-Business Suite Enterprise Resource Planning applications. Destination refers to the Advanced Planning and Scheduling applications.\n\nNote: Oracle supports legacy collections for level members and history. The user must define and apply Oracle Demantra import integration profiles.\n\nIntegration Features\n\nDemand Management Navigator Menus\n\nThe Oracle E-Business Suite Navigator provides the following two responsibilities:\n\nDemand Management System Administrator\n\nDemand Analyst\n\nNote: EBS users can have both Demand Management and Sales and Operations Planning responsibilities, and therefore access both Demantra Demand Management and Sales and Operations Planning.\n\nThe Oracle E-Business Suite Navigator menu for the Demand Management System Administrator Responsibility provides the following links to integrate with the respective Oracle Demantra functionality:\n\nDemand Management System Administrator > Demand Management Workbench – opens the Demantra Local Application user interface\n\nDemand Management System Administrator > Workflow Manager – opens the Oracle Demantra Workflow Manager user interface\n\nDemand Management System Administrator > Administration – accesses the Oracle Demantra Administration page\n\nDemand Management System Administrator > User Management – accesses the Oracle Demantra User Management page\n\nCollections: Oracle Systems - accesses collections programs to obtain data entities from the E-Business Suite, Advanced Supply Chain Planning, Operational Data Store applications with an option to download data into Oracle Demantra:\n\nStandard Collections\n\nShipment and Booking History\n\nCurrency Conversion\n\nUOM Conversion\n\nReturns History\n\nPricing Data\n\nDownload Calendars\n\nCollections: Legacy Systems: > Shipment and Booking History - Flat File – allows access to legacy shipment and booking history flat file, if applicable\n\nSetup > Instances - Allows setting up multiple Instances from where collections can be run to obtain data entities.\n\nSetup > Calendar List - allows setting up calendars to be downloaded into Oracle Demantra\n\nSetup > New Products List – allows setting up new products to be downloaded into Oracle Demantra\n\nSetup > Price Lists\n\nThe Oracle E-Business Suite Navigator menu for the Demand Analyst Responsibility provides the following link:\n\nDemand Analyst > Demand Management Workbench – opens the Demantra Local Application user interface.\n\nUser Synchronization\n\nWhen an E-Business Suite user is granted any responsibility containing the Demand Management Workbench (MSD_DEM_DEMPLANR) function grant, an Oracle Demantra user of the same username is created in the Oracle Demantra Demand Management component.\n\nIf the E-Business Suite user additionally has the Setup > Instances (MSD_DEM_DEMADMIN) function grant, the corresponding Oracle Demantra user has the following Oracle Demantra function security grants:\n\nBusiness Modeler\n\nRun batch engine\n\nWorkflow Manager to run archive, download and upload workflows\n\nIf the E-Business Suite user does not have the MSD_DEM_DEMADMIN function grant, the corresponding Oracle Demantra user has none of the previously listed Oracle Demantra function security grants.\n\nAs E-Business Suite users' function grants change over time, the corresponding Oracle Demantra users' function grants automatically change to match. For example, if at any time the E-Business Suite user loses the Demand Management (MSD_DEM_DEMPLANR) E-Business Suite function grant, the corresponding Oracle Demantra user is deleted.\n\nImportant: If the user is a customer contact, then restrict the contact's Oracle Demantra data security scope to that customer in the customer class hierarchy.\n\nUsers assigned E-Business Suite Demand Management System Administrator or Demand Analyst responsibilities are automatically assigned mirrored responsibilities in Oracle Demantra. When a user is created in the E-Business Suite and mirrored in Oracle Demantra, the default password is a randomly-generated sequence of 10 characters. A Demantra System Administrator/component owner must then go into the Business Modeler and change that user's password before the user can access Demantra.\n\nSingle Sign-on Setup for Demantra Using the Oracle Access Manager (OAM) 11g\n\nNote: This setup is required for Demantra 12.2 and later when integrating with EBS.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nUser synchronization must be enabled between EBS and Demantra.\n\nEBS must be integrated with OAM 11g for single sign-on (SSO) which uses OID (Oracle Internet Directory) or OVD (Oracle Virtual Directory) as the data store. OAM uses EBS AccessGate to collect credentials from users. For more information, please refer to My Oracle Support Note ID 1309013.1 “Integrating Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 with Oracle Access Manager 11gR1 (11.1.1.5) using Oracle E-Business Suite AccessGate”.\n\nEnsure that an instance of the Oracle HTTP server was installed by the Oracle Identity Management Suite 11g or Webcenter 11g. If not, download and install Oracle Webcenter 11g where the OAM11g is installed.\n\nConfiguring Single Sign-on:\n\nConfigure a new Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) instance specifically to protect the Demantra WebLogic server. For more information about configuring a new OHS component, please follow the steps in topic “2.3.4.3 Configuring Your Components”, Oracle Fusion Middleware Installation Guide for Oracle Web Tier 11g Release 1 (11.1.1).\n\nSet up the HTTP server as a reverse proxy in front of the WebLogic server hosting the Demantra application to validate the user session.\n\nLocate the file mod_wl_ohs.conf file under the path $ORACLE_INSTANCE\\config\\OHS\\ohs_instance_name\\ Note: replace ohs_instance_name with the newly installed ohs instance name (for example, ohs2).\n\nAdd the following lines to the file:\n\n<Location context url for Demantra application >\n\nSetHandler weblogic-handler\n\nWebLogicHost weblogichostname\n\nWebLogicPort portnumber\n\n</Location>\n\nSave the file and restart the OHS server using the command:\n\n./opmnctl restartproc ias-component=ohs2 from the directory $ORACLE_INSTANCE/bin/.\n\nVerify that the reverse proxy is working using the following URL. It should redirect you to the Demantra login page.\n\nhttp://ohs_host:ohs_port/context url for Demantra application/portal/loginpage.jsp\n\nInstall the new Oracle Access Manager Webgate 11g. See “Installing and Configuring Oracle HTTP Server 11g Webgate for OAM” in Oracle Fusion Middleware Installation Guide for Oracle Identity Management 11g Release 1 (11.1.1) for more details.\n\nPerform the actions listed in the following sections:\n\nPost-Installation Steps\n\nVerifying the Oracle HTTP Server 11g Webgate for Oracle Access Manager\n\nGetting Started with a New Oracle HTTP Server 11g Webgate Agent for Oracle Access Manager\n\nIn the Oracle Access Manager Administration Console, click the System Configuration tab.\n\nClick the OAM Agents tab. Verify that the host name and webgate name is correct.\n\nSpecify the authentication in the web.xml file of the Demantra Application:\n\nAdd the following lines in the web.xml file or if there is already an authentication method specified, then change it to CLIENT-CERT.\n\n<login-config>\n\n<auth-method>CLIENT-CERT</auth-method>\n\n</login-config>\n\nRedeploy the application and restart the WebLogic server.\n\nOpen the OAM console and do the following:\n\nExpand the Application domain created for Demantra.\n\nBy default the application domain creates a default resource entry ( /.../* ) that protects all the resources. This can be kept as it is if you have configured an OHS instance and webgate specific to Demantra and not shared with any other applications.\n\nIf you want to keep the resources prefixed with the context URL of the Demantra application, then remove the default entry and add the below given resources to the protected resource policy.\n\nResource Type Authentication Policy Authorization Policy /<demantra_context_url>/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy /<demantra_context_url>/…/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy /<demantra_context_url>/common/…/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy /<demantra_context_url>/portal/…/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy /<demantra_context_url>/workflow/…/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy /<demantra_context_url>/logs/…/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy /<demantra_context_url>/conf/…/* HTTP Protected Resource Policy Protected Resource Policy\n\nExpand Authentication policies.\n\nOpen Protected Resource Policies.\n\nFrom the Authentication Scheme drop-down box, select the scheme which protects EBS resources. For example: EBSAuthScheme\n\nClick the Responses tab\n\nAdd the following response:\n\nResponse name Type Value OAM_REMOTE_USER Header $user.userid\n\nApply the changes and exit console.\n\nDisable http-only ssoCookie. This step is required to resolve the issue of java applets that are not loading in OAM 11g or 10g. For more details, see My Oracle Support Note #1317110.1.\n\nOpen EBSAuthScheme under Authentication Schemes in OAM Console.\n\nIn the Challenge Parameters text box, enter the text “ssoCookie=disablehttponly”. This parameter is case sensitive.\n\nApply the changes and exit OAM console.\n\nRestart the OAM server.\n\nIn EBS, set the MSD_DEM: Host URL in EBS to the value http://OHS_HOST_NAME:OHS_PORT/demantra_context_url, save it and logout.\n\nTo test that you have successfully configured SSO for Demantra, login to your EBS application with a user who has Demantra responsibilities and navigate to the Demantra Local Application page. You will be taken to the Demantra Local Application directly without being prompted with the Demantra Login page.\n\nLogging in to Demantra from an External System\n\nTo log in to Demantra from an external system, the URL must be constructed as shown in the examples below.\n\nNote that in each case, 'my_server' must be changed to the name of your application server and the 'component=parameter' value may be different, as it is based on the Demantra component the user wishes to log in to.\n\nDemantra Local Application:\n\nhttps://my_server/demantra/common/prelogin.jsp?redirectUrl=13&loginUrl=1&loginTo=0&source=0&component=dm\n\nWorkflow Manager:\n\nhttps://my_server/demantra/common/prelogin.jsp?redirectUrl=18&loginUrl=9&loginTo=4&source=0&component=dm\n\nDemantra Anywhere:\n\nhttps://my_server/demantra/common/prelogin.jsp?redirectUrl=14&loginUrl=3&loginTo=1&source=0&component=dm\n\nDemand Planner Web Client:\n\nhttps://my_server/demantra/common/prelogin.jsp?redirectUrl=13&loginUrl=2&loginTo=2&source=0&component=dm\n\nSeeded Demand Management Component\n\nThe seeded Demand Management component contains the default owning user levels, organized as hierarchies; series; and workflows required for the demand management business functions. The component owner ID for the Demand Management component is 'dm'. The password for this ID is set during Demantra installation.\n\nSeeded Levels and Hierarchies\n\nOracle Demand Management provides several seeded levels organized into several seeded hierarchies:\n\nItem levels: hierarchy roll-up sequence\n\nProduct Category: Item > Category > All\n\nProduct Family: Item > Product Family > All\n\nDemand Class: Demand Class > All\n\nResources: > Resource Group> All\n\nLocation level: hierarchy roll-up sequence\n\nZone: Site > Trading Partner Zone > Zone > All\n\nGeography: Site > Region > Country > Area > All\n\nTrading Partner Class: Site > Trading Partner > Trading Partner Class > All\n\nShip From: Organization > Operating Unit > Legal Entity > Business Group > All\n\nBusiness Group: Organization > Operating Unit > Business Group > All\n\nLegal Entity: Organization > Legal Entity > All\n\nSales Channel: Sales Channel > All\n\nCustomer Class: Site > Account > Customer > Customer Class\n\nTime:\n\nManufacturing Calendar: Day > Week(calendar_id) > Period(calendar_id) > All\n\nGregorian Calendar: Day > Month > Quarter > Year > All\n\nFiscal Calendar: as collected from the E-Business Suite\n\nNote: This set of notes applies to Manufacturing Calendars and Fiscal Calendars, but not Gregorian Calendars.\n\nDynamically construct a separate hierarchy for each collected calendar. See Dynamic Creation of Calendar Hierarchies.\n\nIf the base time unit is set to 'week', then the hierarchy is Week (calendar_id) > Period (calendar_id)\n\nIf the installed base time unit is set to 'week', then only those Manufacturing Calendars with matching week definitions are collected.\n\nManufacturing and Fiscal Calendars are not supported if the base time unit is set to 'month'\n\nSee the “Levels” chapter.\n\nSeeded Series\n\nA series is a set of data that represents some value that varies over time or that varies between item-location combinations, or most commonly, that varies in both ways. A worksheet displays the series data in a table, or in a graph, or both. You can generally view data for any given series at any aggregation level. The definition of the series controls how the data is aggregated.\n\nSee the “Series” chapter.\n\nBooking History - Booked Items – Booked Date\n\nBooking History – Requested Items – Booked Date\n\nBooking History – Booked Items – Requested Date\n\nBooking History – Requested Items – Requested Date\n\nShipment History – Shipped Items – Shipped Date\n\n* Shipment History – Requested Items – Shipped Date\n\nShipment History – Shipped Items – Requested Date\n\nShipment History – Requested Items – Requested Date\n\nReturn History\n\n* Shipment History - Requested Items - Shipped Date is the default series for the base forecast and historical demand.\n\nLoaded level for all seeded series:\n\nProduct: Item\n\nDemand Class: Demand Class\n\nOrganization: Organization\n\nGeography: Site\n\nChannel: Sales Channel\n\nTime: Week\n\nThe seeded default values are null.\n\nSeeded Workflows\n\nOracle provides the following out-of-the-box workflows:\n\nSeeded workflows to run downloads using EP_LOAD for:\n\nItems\n\nLocations\n\nHistory (sales data)\n\nCalendars\n\nSeeded workflows to run uploads to Advanced Supply Chain Planning or other sources\n\nSeeded workflow to download return history\n\nSeeded workflow to download price lists\n\nSeeded workflows to run the Demand forecast\n\nSeeded workflows to:\n\nSet the Final Approval series to NULL\n\nRun the statistical forecast, by default based on Shipment History – Requested Date, and\n\nNotify all users when the forecast is finished.\n\nSeeded workflows and seeded user groups used in the approval process. The default setting for the user step is: 'Check Finish Every Day'. The default setting for 'Timeout' is: after 10 days. The Planning Group Workflow should time out 5 days after the Final Approver's targeted time range has passed.\n\nSeeded workflow to archive forecasts for the Waterfall Analysis\n\nSeeded workflow to calculate forecast for Line of Business\n\nThese workflows may be changed depending on the business need. For example, the Administrator wants to ensure that the relevant user groups and users are notified of a change the timeout process. The Administrator does this by editing the relevant workflow and editing the steps.\n\nPredefined Worksheets\n\nPredefined worksheets with the appropriate series for analysis and modification of the forecast are provided. For more information about predefined worksheets, see the Oracle Demantra Demand Management User's Guide.\n\nA predefined waterfall worksheet with the forecast and accuracy series is available for the analyst at the beginning of each cycle. A default level is specified for every hierarchy in the Aggregation tab, although only a subset of these hierarchies will be in a Component.\n\nTo produce this worksheet, historical final forecasts must be available. For implementations with Weekly time periods, the final forecast from the current quarter must be kept on a rolling basis moving forward. The following archived forecasts are used in the worksheet:\n\nThe forecast series for the current week minus 4, named 4 Week Lag Forecast\n\nThe forecast series for the current week minus 8, named 8 Week Lag Forecast\n\nThe forecast series for the current week minus 12, 12 Week Lag Forecast\n\nThe Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is calculated for each of the historical forecast series named appropriately, for example 4 Week Lag MAPE\n\nThe Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is calculated for each of the historical forecast series named appropriately, for example 4 Week Lag MAD\n\nFor implementations with Monthly time periods, the following forecasts must be kept for the current year on a rolling basis moving forward:\n\nThe forecast series for the previous month, named 1 Month Lag Forecast\n\nThe forecast series for the current month minus 2, named 2 Month Lag Forecast\n\nThe forecast series for the current month minus 6, named 6 Month Lag Forecast\n\nMAPE calculated for each of the historical forecast series named appropriately, for example 1 Month Lag MAPE\n\nMAD calculated for each of the historical forecast series named appropriately, for example 1 month Lag MAD\n\nMAPE calculation:\n\nsummation ( absolute value | Actual Demand - Lagged Forecast | / (Actual Demand) / Number of Observations )\n\nMAD calculation:\n\nsummation (absolute value | Actual Demand - Lagged Forecast | / Number of Observations )\n\nSummary of Integration Tasks\n\nThis section lists integration tasks in the appropriate sequence.\n\nNote: The Demantra schema must be in the same instance as the APS instance.\n\nInitial EBS setup. See EBS Setup.\n\nInitial setup of EBS collections. See EBS Collections Initial Setup\n\nSynchronization of levels. See Demantra Level Setup.\n\nCollect data and download to staging tables.

See Uploading from Oracle Demantra.\n\nEBS Setup\n\nThe following need to be configured for EBS to Demantra Demand Management integration:\n\nProfile Options\n\nNew Products List\n\nCalendar List\n\nBase Time Unit\n\nConfiguring the EBS Profile Options\n\nSource Side Profiles\n\nProfile Name Description Default Value MSD_DEM: Aggregate Site level in Demantra This profile determines how historical data collected from EBS is aggregated. Valid values are:\n\nSite: information is collected at Site level for all accounts which have not been aggregated to Key account.\n\nAccount: Historical data for all sites falling under an account is rolled up and collected against that account. Account level and site level will have similar member data in Demantra. When you choose this option, the Site level upload/export of forecasts into ASCP is not supported. The Account level must be used for the upload/export of forecasts.\n\nFor all customers marked as a Key Customer, the accounts are aggregated and brought in as the distinct accounts. For customers not marked as Key Customers, all underlying data is aggregated into a 'dummy' customer.\n\nCustomer: Historical data for all sites falling under a customer will be aggregated and collected against that customer. In this case, Customer, Account, and site levels will have similar member data in Demantra. When you choose this option, the Site and Account level upload/export of forecasts into ASCP is not supported.\n\nFor all customers marked as a Key Customer, the accounts are aggregated and brought in as the distinct customers. For customers not marked as Key Customers, all underlying data is aggregated into a 'dummy' customer.\n\nSite MSC: Configuration This profile defines whether item descriptions are collected for the appropriate Demantra tables. At the site level, set to 'APS & CP' if you want to collect item descriptions. Set on both the source and destination instances if decentralized. Set by the Administrator MSD_DEM: Master Org This profile defines the Product Family to which an Item rolls up. Set by the Administrator MSD_DEM: Category Set Name This profile defines the Item to Category rollups in each instance. Inv.Items\n\nSee Note 1 following this table. MSD_DEM: Conversion Type This profile determines which currency conversion rates are collected from the General Ledger tables. Corporate MSD_DEM: Customer Attribute This profile options determines how customer data is imported to Demantra. This setting impacts what type and detail of information is collected into the Site hierarchy of the Location dimension. It works as follows:\n\nIf the profile option is set to NULL, then all customers are brought into Demantra.\n\nIf the profile option is not defined, then all customers' data is brought into Demantra at the Site level.\n\nIf the profile option is set to “none” then Site hierarchy data will not be available for viewing data.\n\nIf the profile option is set to a valid column name (that is, it points to a specific attribute of the customer definitions in EBS), then site level customer information is imported for any customer where MSD_DEM:Customer Attribute ='Yes'. Otherwise, customers data is not brought in at site level and is aggregated to a dummy site and customer with description “0”.\n\nFor example, MSD_DEM: Customer Attribute is set to \"Attribute8\". For customers AA, BB, and DD Attribute 8 is set to “Yes” while for customers CC and EE Attribute 8 is set to something else. When data is collected Site, Account, and Customer Data is collected for customers AA,BB, and DD. All data for customers CC and EE is aggregated together and collected against Site=\"0\", Account=\"0\" and Customer=\"0\" Set by the Administrator\n\nNote: Set the MSD_DEM: Category Set Name profile to a 'master level' category set. A master level category set does not allow multiple category roll up, such as an item rolling up to multiple categories within the same category set for the same organization.\n\nDestination Side Profiles\n\nProfile Name Description Default Value MSC: Configuration This profile defines whether item descriptions are collected for the appropriate Demantra tables. At the site level, set to 'APS & CP' if you want to collect item descriptions. Set on both the source and destination instances if decentralized. Set by the Administrator MSD_DEM: Currency Code This profile designates the Demand Management base currency. US Dollar\n\nSee Note 1 following this table. MSD_DEM: Two-Level Planning This profile enables demand forecasts at the Product Family level on the basis of sales histories of member items. Exclude family members with forecast control 'None'.\n\nSee Note 2 following this table. MSD_DEM: Schema Set this profile value to the database schema name where the Oracle Demantra schema has been installed. DMTRA_TEMPLATE MSD_DEM: Data Profile for Price Lists Set this profile to import integration data profile for price lists. EBS Price List MSD_DEM: Maximum seeded units available for price lists This profile determines the number of slots available for price lists in Oracle Demantra. 30 MSD_DEM: Debug Mode When set to 'Yes', this profile is used to print debug information to the output file of the concurrent request. No MSD_DEM: Host URL Set this profile to the Oracle Demantra Application Server Host Name, Port Number and Application Name. This profile is used to invoke Oracle Demantra URLs from the E-Business Suite applications. Set by the Administrator\n\nSee Note 3 following this table.\n\nNote 1:\n\nSet up profile option MSD_DEM: Currency Code on the destination instance--sysadmin, application, currency:\n\nQuery your currency and then check the enabled flag\n\nSave\n\nPopulate the profile as required\n\nSet up MSD_DEM: Master Org on the source only. When there is a source instance, you do not need to set it up on the destination.\n\nNote 2:\n\nYou can collect all the product family members and their sales histories regardless of the forecast control, as long as:\n\nThe product family forecast control is 'Consume' or 'Consume & Derive', and\n\nThe planning method for 'product family' and 'members' is not set to 'Not Planned'.\n\nThis is achieved by setting the profile value to: Collect all family members and their sales histories.\n\nThe MSD_DEM: Two-Level Planning profile default value, Exclude family members with forecast control 'None' enforces the behavior that only 'Consume' or 'Consume & Derive' product family members are collected.\n\nNote 3:\n\nUse the format:\n\nhttp://<host name>:<port number>/<application name>, or\n\nhttp://<host IP address>:<port number>/<application name>\n\nFor example http://pc-anwroy-in:8090/Oracle Demantra\n\nSetting Up the New Products List\n\nThis setup specifies certain new items, for which there is no history data, that need to be downloaded into Oracle Demantra.\n\nAll items available in Advanced Supply Chain Planning Operational Data Store are displayed in the list of values. Items across multiple instances can be specified. Items that are downloaded into Oracle Demantra are not processed in subsequent collections.\n\nOnce a new item is added to the New Product list and downloaded, it remains in the list unless manually deleted. If a new item is downloaded into Oracle Demantra and then subsequently phased out, it remains in Oracle Demantra until manually deleted. If this item needs to be reintroduced in the future, delete the item from the item list in the New Products List user interface, and then add it back to the list. This ensures treatment as a new item that will be downloaded into Oracle Demantra.\n\nNote: All Items added to the New Products list download into Oracle Demantra. No attribute checking occurs.\n\nSetting Up the Calendar List\n\nThis setup specifies which manufacturing and fiscal calendars need to be collected and downloaded into Oracle Demantra. A user interface accessed from the E-Business Suite Demand Management menu structure allows the Demand Management System Administrator to list the E-Business Suite calendars to be used for Demand Management analysis.\n\nAll calendars available in Advanced Supply Chain Planning Operational Data Store (ASCP ODS) display in the list of values. Calendars across multiple instances can be specified.\n\nNote: If a calendar is removed from this list, it is not deleted from Oracle Demantra automatically. Subsequent collections will not collect and download that calendar.\n\nTake the following example of a Fiscal Calendar collected from the E-Business Suite source. Assume for this example that the Oracle Demantra base time unit is week, with each week starting on Monday.\n\nVision Corporate Calendar Week Start Monday End Sunday Fiscal Quarter 2007-1 Fiscal Month 2007-1 1 1/1/2007 1/7/2007 2 1/8/2007 1/14/207 3 1/15/207 1/21/207 4 1/22/2007 1/28/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-2 5 1/29/2007 2/4/2007 6 2/5/2007 2/11/2007 7 2/12/2007 2/18/2008 8 2/19/2007 2/25/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-3 9 2/26/2007 3/4/2007 10 3/5/2007 3/11/2007 11 3/12/2007 3/18/2007 12 3/19/2007 3/25/2007 13 3/26/2007 4/1/2007 Fiscal Quarter 2007-2 Fiscal Month 2007-4 14 4/2/2007 4/8/2007 15 4/9/2007 4/15/2007 16 4/16/2007 4/22/2007 17 4/23/2007 4/29/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-5 18 4/30/2007 5/6/2007 19 5/7/2007 5/13/2007 20 5/14/2007 5/20/2007 21 5/21/2007 5/27/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-6 22 5/28/2007 6/3/2007 23 6/4/2007 6/10/2007 24 6/11/2007 6/17/2007 25 6/18/2007 6/24/2007 26 6/25/2007 7/1/2007 Fiscal Quarter 2007-3 Fiscal Month 2007-7 27 7/2/2007 7/8/2007 28 7/9/2007 7/15/2007 29 7/16/2007 7/22/2007 30 7/23/2007 7/29/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-8 31 7/30/2007 8/5/2007 32 8/6/2007 8/12/2007 33 8/13/2007 8/19/2007 34 8/20/2007 8/26/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-9 35 8/27/2007 9/2/2007 36 9/3/2007 9/9/2007 37 9/10/2007 9/16/2007 38 9/17/2007 9/23/2007 39 9/24/2007 9/30/2007 Fiscal Quarter 2007-4 Fiscal Month 2007-10 40 10/1/2007 10/7/2007 41 10/8/2007 10/14/2007 42 10/15/2007 10/21/2007 43 10/22/2007 10/28/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-11 44 10/29/2007 11/4/2007 45 11/5/2007 11/11/2007 46 11/12/2007 11/18/2007 47 11/19/2007 11/25/2007 Fiscal Month 2007-12 48 11/26/2007 12/2/2007 49 12/3/2007 12/9/2007 50 12/10/2007 12/16/2007 51 12/17/2007 12/23/2007 52 12/24/2007 12/30/2007\n\nRun the Download Calendars program with the calendar_id parameter set as \"Vision Corporate Calendar\" to create the following levels and hierarchy:\n\nWeek (existing level)\n\n> Fiscal Month (Vision Corporate Calendar) (new level)\n\n> Fiscal Quarter (Vision Corporate Calendar) (new level)\n\n> Fiscal Year (Vision Corporate Calendar) (new level)\n\nThe level members roll up to parent members (weeks to fiscal months, fiscal months to fiscal quarters, fiscal quarters to fiscal years) according to the calendar definition. The name of the generating calendar (Vision Corporate Calendar, in the above example) in the level names distinguish the newly created levels. In this way, Oracle Demantra accommodates analysis along multiple E-Business Suite calendars. See Setting and Modifying the Base Time Unit.\n\nCalendars are always collected using Full Refresh of Shipment and Booking History Collections. Calendars can also be collected by launching Download Calendars from the menu. In other words, all dates are collected. A check ensures the collected dates fall within the Oracle Demantra default dates. Only levels higher than the lowest model defined time aggregation are loaded. For example, when the base time unit is 'week', only month (period), quarter and year load. For a monthly system, only quarter and year load.\n\nTo set up the Calendar List:\n\nNavigate to the Demand Management Calendars user interface.\n\n(Setup > Calendar List)\n\nThe Demand Management Calendars user interface appears.\n\nThis user interface validates that any calendar listed has a time bucket level that matches the Oracle Demantra base time unit. For all calendars defined in the Calendar List, a stored procedure, invoked via the Oracle Demantra Download Calendars workflow, creates corresponding time hierarchies in Oracle Demantra. If the time hierarchies do not already exist, the procedure adds them to the Demand Management component.\n\nTo add a calendar to the list, select an empty row.\n\nSelect a calendar from the drop-down list of values.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSetting the Base Time Unit\n\nThe base time unit is used by the Demand Planner Data Model to aggregate the source data to the specified time bucket size. Allowed settings of the base time unit (time bucket size) are:\n\nday\n\nweek\n\nGregorian month\n\nSee Setting and Modifying the Base Time Unit.\n\nDemantra Level Setup\n\nCreating a New Leaf Level\n\nThe Demand Management System Administrator can create a new leaf level for a hierarchy, such as adding a sales representative as a location new leaf level.\n\nNavigate to the Open Data Model window.\n\nBusiness Modeler > Data Model > Open Data Model\n\nFrom the Open Data Model window, navigate to the Data Model Design window. In the left pane, with no node selected, select Create Location Dimension from the right-click menu.\n\nThe Data Model Design window appears.\n\nComplete the table and field names that will hold level members.\n\nCustomize the collections code.\n\nRun collections.\n\nRebuild the Oracle Demantra model. See Building the Data Model and Manipulating Existing Data Models.\n\nCreating a New Top Level\n\nThe Demand Management System Administrator can create a new top level for a hierarchy, such as creating a level for Product Line located above Product Family level.\n\nNavigate to the Configure Levels window.\n\nBusiness Modeler > Configuration > Configure Levels\n\nThe Configure Levels window opens.\n\nSelect, and then right-click the current top level node. For example, select product category.\n\nFrom the right-click menu, choose New level.\n\nThe General Properties window opens.\n\nComplete the following General Properties:\n\nLevel Name, such as Super Category\n\nType: Product Level\n\nStatus: Enabled.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe Level <current node> Data Properties window opens.\n\nDefine the Table Name and Column that house members of the new level. You are selecting a field in the database table to house members of the new level.\n\nCustomize the collections code to populate the appropriate table and column with product line member data.\n\nClick Next.\n\nRun collections.\n\nNext define level value associations of specific parent product lines to child product families. Navigate to Member Management.\n\nDemand Analyst > Tools > Member Management\n\nSelect the Product Line node.\n\nDrag Product Families under the appropriate Product Lines.\n\nClick Save.\n\nNote: To Create a New Hierarchy on Top of an Existing Leaf Level, perform multiple iterations of the following procedure for Creating a New Top Level.\n\nCreating a New Intermediate Level\n\nConfigure Levels does not directly support the addition of intermediate levels. To accomplish the addition of an intermediate level, the process renames an existing level, and then adds a new top level.\n\nFor example:\n\nExisting level name: 'Category'\n\nRename 'Category' as 'Subcategory'\n\nCreate a new top level named 'Category'.\n\nNavigate: Business Modeler > Configuration > Configure Levels\n\nThe Configure Levels window opens.\n\nSelect, and then right-click the current top level node.\n\nRename the current top level to the name of the new intermediate level.\n\nUse the Creating a New Top Level procedure to add a new top level above the intermediate level.\n\nDeleting a Level\n\nNavigate: Business Modeler > Data Model > Open Data Model\n\nGo to Data Model step\n\nIn the left hand pane, select the level to be deleted.\n\nFrom the right-click menu, select Delete.\n\nRebuild the Oracle Demantra model – See Building the Data Model and Manipulating Existing Data Models.\n\nEBS Collections Initial Setup\n\nInitial setup encompasses the following steps:\n\nSet up Instances\n\nSet up Standard Collections\n\nImportant: After Demantra has been installed you must run the 'Update Synonyms' concurrent request, which is under the responsibility 'Demand Management System Administrator.' This program defines the value of the MSD_DEM: Schema profile option.\n\nThis program has a parameter 'Schema Name' that is not displayed by default. If there is only one schema, (the most likely production scenario), the program will automatically update that one. But if there are multiple schemas (possible in a development environment), an administrator can log in using the 'Applications Developer' responsibility and choose to display the Schema Name parameter. The Demand Management System Administrator will then be able to select a schema when running Update Synonyms.\n\nSet Up Instances\n\nAn instance is a database and a set of applications. Setup Instances is run before running Standard Collections to specify the Instances from which Standard Collections obtains data.\n\nOracle Advanced Planning can plan a single instance or multiple instances. For information about setting up instances, see \"Instances\" in the Cross-Instance Planning chapter ofOracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning Implementation and User's Guide.\n\nSet Up Standard Collections\n\n\"Standard\" Collections refer to the Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) concurrent program for collecting new or changed information from the E-Business Suite to the Oracle Data Store (ODS). For information about collections, see the Oracle Value Chain Planning Collections Guide.\n\nTip: You are recommended to set the MSC: Configuration profile option to 'APS & CP' if you want to collect item descriptions when standard collections are run. See \"Profile Options\" for more information about this profile option.\n\nSign on using the Advanced Supply Chain Planner responsibility or the Advanced Planning Administrator responsibility.\n\nNavigate to the Planning Data Collection window by selecting Collections > Oracle Systems > Standard Collection.\n\nThe Planning Data Collection window appears.\n\nThis window shows that the collections process consists of two sequentially executed concurrent programs. The first program, Planning Data Pull, copies information from the source instance into the APS staging tables on the planning server. The second program, Planning ODS Load, copies information from the APS staging tables into the operation data store on the planning server,\n\nTo select the Data Pull Parameters to use during Standard Collections, select the Parameters field for the Planning Data Pull program.\n\nThe Planning Data Pull Parameters window appears.\n\nSet the parameters as shown in the previous figures.\n\nSelect the Parameters field for the Planning ODS Load program.\n\nThe Parameters window appears.\n\nSet the parameters as shown in the previous figure.\n\nNote: If the item descriptions have not been collected after you complete this process, set the MSC: Configuration profile option to 'APS & CP' and rerun the collection. See \"Profile Options\" for more information.\n\nSet up Price Lists, Calendars, and New Products\n\nSetup Calendar, Price Lists and New Products are run initially, and on an as needed basis in ongoing cycles.\n\nSee\n\nCollecting Price List Data\n\nSetting Up the Calendar List\n\nDownloading Calendars\n\nSetting Up the New Products List\n\nOther Collections\n\nAfter setup is complete, the remaining collections are run. All other collection choices under the Oracle Systems menu are used to collect the specified data from the planning server for download to Oracle Demantra. See:\n\nCombined Collections of Shipment and Booking History\n\nCollecting Currency Conversion Data\n\nCollecting UOM Conversion Data\n\nCollecting Returns History Data\n\nLegacy Collection loads Shipment and History data into Oracle Demantra\n\nSee Collecting Legacy Shipment and History Data.\n\nRunning Collections\n\nNote: For more information about collections see the Oracle Value Chain Planning Collections Guide.\n\nCollections use existing Oracle Demand Planning and Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning user interfaces, accessed from the Demand Management System Administrator responsibility.\n\nAvailable collections:\n\nStandard Collections -- designates existing ASCP collections of reference data -- items, location, and calendars -- that are collected from the Instances specified in Setup > Instance. Sales Orders, which is an entity inside Advanced Supply Chain Planning Standard Collections, provides the data stream representing future demand. The Standard Collections must be run before other collections. For information about collections see the Oracle Value Chain Planning Collections Guide.\n\nShipment and Booking Data -- provides the data stream representing past demand.\n\nSee Combined Collections of Shipment and Booking History, and Collecting Legacy Shipment and History Data\n\nReturn History, See Collecting Returns History Data\n\nCurrency Conversion, See Collecting Currency Conversion Data..\n\nUnits of Measure (UOM) Conversion, See Collecting Unit of Measure Conversion Data\n\nPricing Data, See Collecting Price List Data\n\nCombined Collections of Shipment and Booking History\n\nThe Collection Utility merges programs that collect data streams for both Shipment and Booking History.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nDefine database instances.\n\nSet up appropriate source and destination profiles.\n\nRun Standard Collections.\n\nTo run Shipment and Booking Data Collections:\n\nNavigate to the Collection Utility:\n\nCollections > Oracle Systems > Shipment and Booking History.\n\nThe Collections Utility window appears, listing several collections programs.\n\nCollect Shipment and Booking Data. This program collects shipment and booking history data from the E-Business Suite Order Management source application based on the collection parameters specified, and then inserts the data into the Oracle Demantra sales staging table.\n\nPush Setup Parameters. This program pushes destination data into the E-Business Suite source, such as source profiles, organizations in the collection group, and time data from Oracle Demantra.\n\nCollect Level Type. There are two Collect Level Type programs, one for items and the other for locations. These programs generate distinct item and location intersections, as defined in Oracle Demantra, from the shipment and booking history, and then insert the data into Oracle Demantra item and location staging tables.\n\nUpdate Level Codes. This program updates the site level codes in the Oracle Demantra sales staging table as present in the Advanced Supply Chain Planning Operational Data Store.\n\nCollect Time. This program collects Manufacturing and Fiscal calendars from the Advanced Supply Chain Planning Operational Data Store, as setup in the Calendar List. See Setting Up the Calendar List.\n\nLaunch EP LOAD.\n\nHistorical information and level data are imported into Oracle Demantra via the EP_LOAD procedure. All other series data are imported into Oracle Demantra via Import Integration Profiles. An assumption of the EP LOAD procedure is that the series are populated into the Oracle Demantra staging tables before the load process begins. To ensure this occurs, the collection programs for all eight historical series have been merged so that these streams are always collected simultaneously. See Seeded Series.\n\nHighlight the Collect Shipment and Booking Data program.\n\nIn the row for the Collect Shipment and Booking Data program, click within the Parameters field. The Parameters window appears. The parameters are described following the image.\n\nInstance. Select the instance code of the E-Business Suite source instance from the list of values as defined in Instances form.\n\nCollection Group. Collection group is a group of Organizations. The parameters screens of all demand planning entities: Level Values, Manufacturing Forecast, Return History, Sales Forecast, Shipment and Booking Data, include a Collections Group parameter. This is to support line of business-specific collections.\n\nCurrency, Unit of Measure, and Price List do not have a Collections Group parameter. Currency is dimensioned by time only. Unit of Measure is dimensioned by item only. Price List is dimensioned by item and time.\n\nThe default value is 'All', which implies data for all Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning- and all Oracle Demand Planning-enabled organizations available for the specified instance are to be collected.\n\nUser-defined values can be specified if user-defined collection groups have been created in the Instances form. Only Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning- and Oracle Demand Planning-enabled organizations can be added to the user-defined collection groups.\n\nCollection Method. Allowed values are: 'Complete' or 'Net Change'\n\n'Complete' clears the data in the Oracle Demantra sales staging table, collects all available records from the E-Business Suite source, and inserts data into the Oracle Demantra sales staging table. No date filters apply for Complete collection. For first time collection of history data, you typically select the 'Complete' Collection Method.\n\n'Net Change' clears the data in the Oracle Demantra sales staging table, collects data by applying the specified date filters, and inserts the fetched data into the Oracle Demantra sales staging table. Net Change is typically selected for ongoing, periodic collection of history data, say on a weekly basis.\n\nThe Complete and Net-Change Collection Methods are mutually exclusive.\n\nDate Range Type. For Net Change collection, the allowed values for Date Range Type are 'Rolling' or 'Absolute'. Date Range type is not valid for 'Complete' collections.\n\n'Rolling' implies the history data is collected from the system date up to the number of days in the past specified in the 'History Collection Window Days' field.\n\n'Absolute' implies the user specifies the date range for which collection is to be done in the Date From and Date To fields.\n\nThe Rolling and Absolute Date Range Types are mutually exclusive.\n\nHistory Collection Windows Days. This field specifies the number of days in the past from the system date for which history data is to be collected. This field is valid when the Date Range Type is 'Rolling'.\n\nDate From and Date To. These fields specify a date range for the collection of history data. They are valid when the Date Range Type is 'Absolute'.\n\nCollected Series. The next eight parameters are the names of the eight seeded history series. Specifying 'Yes' causes a series to be collected. Specifying 'No' will not collect it.\n\nNote: For history collections, at least one series must be specified. The Shipment History – Requested Items – Shipped Date series is the default value.\n\nCollect Internal Sales Orders. Specifying 'Yes' collects any internal sales orders available in the source. By default, internal sales orders are not collected.\n\nCollect All Order Types. Specifying 'Yes' collects sales orders for all order types. Specifying 'No' enables the Include Order Types field.\n\nInclude Order Types. Specifying 'No' in the Collect All Order Types parameter enables entry of Order Types in the Include Order Types field, for which sales orders are collected. Enter Order Types one after another with a comma separated delimiter.\n\nExclude Order Types. To exclude certain order types from being collected specify the list of Order Types that are not to be collected in the Exclude Order Types field. Enter Order Types one after another with a comma separated delimiter.\n\nEither 'Include Order Types' or 'Exclude Order Types' can be specified, but not both.\n\nType Selection Method\n\nThe Type Selection Method is available through the EBS Menu under Demand Management System Administrator > Collections > Oracle Systems > Shipment and Booking History. It is disabled if the Collect All Order Types parameter is set to YES (Default). If Collect All Order Types is set to NO, then Type Selection Method is enabled and mandatory.\n\nThe available settings are defined in the table below.\n\nList Item Description Comma (,) separated list of order types (Default value) Select either “Include Order Types” or “Exclude Order Types” with a list of order types. The list must be less than 240 characters. SQL query name SQL query name from Table MSD_DEM_ENTITY_QUERIES. When selected; user has to enter the query name stored in Table MSD_DEM_ENTITY_QUERIES in the “Include Order Types” or “Exclude Order Types” parameter fields which will return valid order type ids. It is the customer's responsibility to maintain entity_name, sql query & order types ids. Note: Sql query must be executable on source side instance. Value Set When selected, the user enters the valueset name in “Include Order Types” or “Exclude Order Types” parameter fields. It is the customer's responsibility to create and maintain the valueset to hold the valid order types for Shipment and Booking History collection. Note: ValueSet must be created on source instance and the ValueSet must be “List of values” type.\n\nLaunch Download. Each collections Single Request Submission includes a Launch Download parameter. Valid values are 'Yes' and 'No'.\n\nSpecifying 'Yes' automatically launches the download of history data into Oracle Demantra as soon as collections have completed. Internally this invokes the Oracle Demantra EP_LOAD procedure to download the data into Oracle Demantra. E-Business Suite Advanced Planning and Scheduling directly populates the staging tables. The Shipment and Booking history collection automatically invokes Download Calendars program if the Launch Download field is set to 'Yes'. See Downloading Calendars.\n\nIf Launch Download is set to 'No', then only collections will be done. Advanced Planning and Scheduling collections leave the data in the Oracle Demantra staging tables. Download does not launch automatically. To download the collected items, locations, and history data, manually launch the Download workflow from Oracle Demantra Workflow Manager.\n\nThe Administrator launches the workflow.\n\nFor historical series, all series are loaded.\n\nAn integration profile for each non-history series determines which data are loaded.\n\nClick OK to close the Parameters window.\n\n(Optional) On the Collection Utility window, click Schedule to open a window where you can set up the concurrent program to run collections at a future date and time, or periodically. The At these Times field default value causes the program to run “As Soon As Possible” after the program is submitted.\n\nClick Submit.\n\nCollecting Legacy Shipment and History Data\n\nThe concurrent programs for Legacy Shipment and History collection are:\n\nFlat File Loads. This program loads the shipment and booking history data from a flat file into the Oracle Demantra sales staging table.\n\nSales Data Pre Processor. This program updates the destination keys from Advanced Supply Chain Planning for all of the levels.\n\nCollect Level Type and Launch EP_LOAD are the same programs as those used for the E-Business Suite Shipment and Booking History Data collections.\n\nPrerequisites: Prior to launching this collection, complete ASCP collections for the legacy instance.\n\nTo collect Legacy Shipment and History Data:\n\nNavigate to the Legacy Collection Utility.\n\nCollections > Oracle Systems > Collect Shipment and Booking Data - Flat File\n\nThe Collections Utility window appears, listing several collections programs.\n\nHighlight the Collect Shipment and Booking Data program.\n\nIn the row for the Collect Shipment and Booking Data program, click within the Parameters field.\n\nThe Parameters window appears. The parameters are described following the image.\n\nThe parameters for the Flat File Loads concurrent program are:\n\nInstance. The legacy instance for which data is being loaded.\n\nTime Out Duration (min). This is the maximum duration, in minutes, for which this program is allowed to run.\n\nFile Path Separator. Windows and UNIX path separators are different.\n\nControl File's Directory. Specifies the location of the SQL loader control file.\n\nData File's Directory. Specifies the location of the history data flat file.\n\nTotal Number of Workers. Specifies the number of programs that can be run simultaneously.\n\nFile Name Booking and Shipment History. Specifies the name of the shipment and booking history flat file.\n\nAuto Run Download. 'Yes' automatically downloads data into Oracle Demantra from the staging tables. 'No' indicates that the download into Oracle Demantra will be accomplished using a separate manual procedure.\n\nCollecting Returns History Data\n\nTo collect Return History Data:\n\nNavigate to the Collect Return History window.\n\nCollections > Oracle Systems > Returns History\n\nThe Collect Return History window appears.\n\nSpecify Collect Return History parameters.\n\nThe collection parameters for Returns History are:\n\nInstance. This is the instance code of the source instance, as defined in Instances form.\n\nCollection Group. This group of organizations filters the collected data by organization.\n\nThe default value is 'All', which implies all Advanced Supply Chain Planning and Demand Planning enabled organizations are available for the specified instance.\n\nUser-defined values can be specified if user-defined collection groups have been created in the Instances form.\n\nOnly Advanced Supply Chain Planning and Demand Planning enabled organizations can be added to the user-defined collection groups.\n\nCollection Method. Valid options are: 'Complete' or 'Net-Change'.\n\n'Complete' clears the data in the Return History staging table, collects all available records from the source, and inserts them into the Return History staging table. No date filters are applied for Complete collection. Complete collection is typically used for the first time collection of history data.\n\n'Net-Change' clears the data in the Return History staging table, collects data by applying the specified date filters, and inserts the fetched data into the Return History staging table. Typically, select net change for regular collection of history data, say on a weekly basis.\n\nComplete and Net-Change are mutually exclusive.\n\nDate Range Type. For 'Net-Change' collection, Date Range Type can be either 'Rolling' or 'Absolute'.\n\n'Rolling' implies collection of history data from the system date up to the number of days in the past as specified in the 'History Collection Window Days' field.\n\n'Absolute' requires values in the Date From and Date To fields to specify the date range for which collection is to be done.\n\n'Rolling' and 'Absolute' Date Range Types are mutually exclusive.\n\nDate Range Type is not valid for the 'Complete' Collection Method.\n\nHistory Collection Windows Days. This field is valid if the 'Rolling' date range type has been chosen. Specify the number of days in the past from the system date for which history data is to be collected.\n\nDate From and Date To. These fields are valid if the 'Absolute' date range type has been chosen. Specify a date range for the collection of history data.\n\nInclude RMA Types. Null value implies collection of all Return Material Authorization types. Specifying particular RMA types causes only those listed to be collected. Multiple RMA types can be specified.\n\n(Optional) To specify particular RMA Types click the cursor within the Include RMA Types Field.\n\nThe Include RMA Type window appears.\n\nSelect the RMA Type. Click OK.\n\nRepeat the previous step as necessary to specify all desired RMA Types.\n\nClick OK to close the Include RMA Type window.\n\nOn the collect Return History window, click Submit to launch the concurrent program to execute Return History collections.\n\nCollecting Currency Conversion Data\n\nCurrency conversion rates are dimensioned by time only.\n\nTo run the Currency Conversion Collections:\n\nNavigate to the Collection Utility\n\nCollections > Oracle Systems > Currency Conversion\n\nThe Collections Utility window appears, with the Collect Currency Conversions program name appearing in the Name field.\n\nClick within the Parameters field. The Parameters window appears.\n\nSet the program parameters.\n\nThe parameter descriptions follow:\n\nInstance. This is the Instance code of the source instance, as defined in the Instances form.\n\nDate From and Date To. Specify a date range for the collection of currency conversion rates. If no dates are specified then all available records available in source are collected without applying any date filters.\n\nCollect All Currency Conversions. Specifying 'Yes' collects Currency conversion rates for all currencies for which conversion rates to the base currency exist in the source. Specifying 'No' enables entry of Currency Codes for which conversion rates can be collected, in the 'Include Currency List' field.\n\nInclude Currency List. If Collect All Currency Conversions is set to 'No', enter Currency Codes one after another with a comma separated delimiter.\n\nExclude Currency List. To exclude certain Currency conversion rates from being collected, specify the list of Currency Codes that are not to be collected in the 'Exclude Currency List' field. Enter Currency Codes one after another separated by a comma delimiter\n\nEither 'Include Currency List' or 'Exclude Currency List' can be specified but not both.\n\nClick OK to close the Parameters window.\n\nClick Submit.\n\nNote: The Administrator can run the following script to add more placeholder currencies to Oracle Demantra:\n\nName: 'Create Seed Entities in Demantra\n\nScript:\n\ndeclare retcode number; begin msd_dem_create_dem_seed.create_dem_seed_data(retcode, <p_start_no>, <p_num_entities>,<p_entity_type>); end; /\n\nParameters to be passed to this script:\n\np_start_no. - starting number of entities to be created (Already units from 100-199 are created)\n\np_num_entities - number of entities to be created\n\np_entity_type - 1 (UOM), 2 (CURRENCY), 3 (PRICE LIST), 0 (ALL)\n\nCollecting Unit of Measure Conversion Data\n\nUnit of Measure conversion rates are dimensioned by time only. UOM conversion rates are always calculated with respect to each collected Item's Primary UOM; up to 100 UOM Conversions can be collected.\n\nTo run the Unit of Measure Conversion Collections:\n\nNavigate to the Collection Utility.\n\nCollections > Oracle Systems > UOM Conversion\n\nThe Collections Utility window appears, with the Collect UOM Conversions program name appearing in the Name field.\n\nClick within the Parameters field.\n\nThe Parameters window appears.\n\nSet the program parameters.\n\nThe parameter descriptions follow:\n\nInstance. This is the instance code of the source instance, as defined in the Instances form.\n\nCollect All Units of Measure.\n\nSpecifying 'Yes' collects UOM conversion rates for all units of measure for which conversion rates exist in the source.\n\nSpecifying 'No' enables entry of UOM Codes for which conversion rates can be collected, in the 'Include Units of Measures' field.\n\nInclude Units of Measure. Enter a list of UOM Codes for which conversion rates can be collected. UOM Codes are entered one after another separated by a comma delimiter\n\nExclude Units of Measure. To exclude certain UOM conversion rates from being collected, enter the list of UOM Codes that are not to be collected. Enter UOM Codes one after another, separated by a comma delimiter.\n\nEither 'Include Units of Measures' or 'Exclude Units of Measures' can be specified, but not both.\n\nClick OK to close the Parameters window.\n\nClick Submit.\n\nNote: The Administrator can run the following script to add more placeholder currencies to Oracle Demantra:\n\nName: 'Create Seed Entities in Demantra\n\nScript:\n\ndeclare retcode number; begin msd_dem_create_dem_seed.create_dem_seed_data(retcode, <p_start_no>, <p_num_entities>,<p_entity_type>); end; /\n\nParameters to be passed to this script:\n\np_start_no. - starting number of entities to be created (Already units from 100-199 are created)\n\np_num_entities - number of entities to be created\n\np_entity_type - 1 (UOM), 2 (CURRENCY), 3 (PRICE LIST), 0 (ALL)\n\nCollecting Price List Data\n\nThe Demand Management forecast considers historical demand and causal factors, such as seasonal demand variation, specific promotional events, and price list changes. The price list is dimensioned by item and by time.\n\nEach time you download price list data, the price list data will be cut off at the current forecast horizon end date. As time rolls forward and the corresponding forecast end buckets roll forward, you will not be able to see pricing and revenue data for the new time buckets until you once again download price list data.\n\nTherefore, Oracle recommends that you either:\n\ndownload price list data with each forecasting cycle, or\n\nif you would like to download price list data less frequently, extend the forecast horizon beyond the business standard.\n\nFor example, if the business standard forecast horizon is 12 months, extend the forecast horizon to 15 months. Generate a forecast, then download price lists. The downloaded price list information will then be sufficient to cover the next three forecasting cycles (cycles 2 through 4). A second price list download will only be necessary after forecasting cycle 5.\n\nOracle also recommends that when you collect pricing data, set the \"Date To\" parameter to match the current end of the forecasting horizon so that you do not needlessly collect more data than can be downloaded into Oracle Demantra Demand Management.\n\nTo extend the forecasting horizon:\n\nNote: Before running this program, you must specify which price lists you want to collect (Demand Management System Administrator > Setup > Price Lists).\n\nFrom the Business Modeler navigate Parameters > System Parameters > Engine > Lead.\n\nIncrease the value of 'Lead'.\n\nTo run the Price List Conversion Collections:\n\nNavigate to the Collection Utility Collections > Oracle Systems > Price List\n\nThe Collections Utility window appears, with the Collect Price List Conversions program name appearing in the Name field.\n\nSpecify the Collect Price List program Parameters.\n\nThe collection parameters are:\n\nInstance. This is the instance code of the source instance, as defined in the Instances form.\n\nDate From and Date To. Used to specify a date range for the collection of Price Lists. These fields are mandatory.\n\nCollect All Price Lists.\n\nSpecifying 'Yes' collects price lists up to the number of seeded series available in Oracle Demantra. The program fails to execute if there are more than the default number of price lists.\n\nSpecifying 'No' enables entry of specific Price Lists that can be collected, in the 'Include Price Lists' field.\n\nInclude Price Lists. Enter Price Lists to be collected, one after another, separated by a comma delimiter.\n\nExclude Price Lists. To exclude certain Price Lists from being collected, specify the list of Price Lists that are not to be collected in the 'Exclude Price Lists' field. Enter Price Lists one after another, with a comma separated delimiter.\n\nEither 'Include Price Lists' or 'Exclude Price Lists' can be specified, but not both.\n\nNote: The Administrator can run the following script to add more placeholder price lists to Oracle Demantra:\n\nName: 'Create Seed Entities in Demantra\n\nScript:\n\ndeclare retcode number; begin msd_dem_create_dem_seed.create_dem_seed_data(retcode, <p_start_no>, <p_num_entities>,<p_entity_type>); end; /\n\nParameters to be passed to this script:\n\np_start_no. - starting number of entities to be created (Already units from 100-199 are created)\n\np_num_entities - number of entities to be created\n\np_entity_type - 1 (UOM), 2 (CURRENCY), 3 (PRICE LIST), 0 (ALL)\n\nDownloading to Oracle Demantra\n\nOnce the EBS collections have been run, data can be downloaded to Oracle Demantra.\n\nSome data can be downloaded automatically through the collection process if desired. The Launch Download option is available in the following collection processes:\n\nShipment and Booking Data\n\nLegacy Shipment and History Data\n\nThese collections can be downloaded manually if the Launch Download option during collection was set to 'No'.\n\nOther data collections must be downloaded manually. They include:\n\nCalendars\n\nPrice List\n\nReturn History\n\nDownload can be triggered through the collections process to move collected series, level and reference data into the Oracle Demantra tables. If the options to automatically launch download are not selected during the collection process, the EBS Full Download (EP_LOAD), EBS Return History Download, and EBS Price List Download can be run later to retrieve data from the staging area into Oracle Demantra Tables.\n\nDownloading Calendars\n\nThe E-Business Suite contains several types of calendars. Typical calendars include Manufacturing, Gregorian, and Fiscal. These calendars may be changed in the source system. Such changes need to be reflected and synchronized in the Oracle Demantra system.\n\nThe Download Calendars concurrent program downloads collected manufacturing and fiscal calendars, in Advanced Supply Chain Planning collections, to Oracle Demantra. Shipment and Booking history collection automatically invokes this program if the Launch Download field is set to 'Yes'.\n\nThe following process to run this program manually can be used if there is a need to download calendars to Oracle Demantra without collecting history.\n\nSee Time Units.\n\nTo download calendars:\n\nNavigate to the Collection Utility user interface.\n\nCollections > Oracle Systems > Download Calendars.\n\nThe Collection Utility window with the Download Calendars program name.\n\nThere are no program parameters. Click Submit.\n\nThe calendars specified in the Calendar List are downloaded. See Setting Up the Calendar List.\n\nDownloading Items, Location, Shipping and Booking History\n\nThe EBS Full Download workflow, also known as EP_Load, downloads items, location, and shipping/booking history from EBS to Demantra. Within EBS, this is called the EP_LOAD download. This workflow can be started from EBS using the Demand Management System Administrator responsibility > Oracle Demantra Workflow Manager > EBS Full Download workflow.\n\nFor members and history series, which are downloaded via the EP_LOAD mechanism, the mode of update is:\n\nIf there is a new member, it is added in Oracle Demantra.\n\nIf a member has been deleted in the E-Business Suite source, it stays in Oracle Demantra along with all series data for combinations that include the member. The administrative user must manually delete the member in Oracle Demantra.\n\nSeries data in the staging area overwrite the series data in Oracle Demantra, for the combinations that are represented in the staging area.\n\nSeries data in Oracle Demantra for combinations that are not in the staging area are left unchanged.\n\nThe staging area is erased after the download.\n\nAll series data in Oracle Demantra, for all combinations, are set to null before the download actions take place.\n\nDownloading Return History and Price Lists\n\nReturn History and EBS Price List data is downloaded from EBS to Demantra using the following workflows:\n\nWorkflows Import Integration Profile EBS Return History Download Return History EBS Price List Download EBS Price List\n\nThese workflows can be started from EBS using the Demand Management System Administrator responsibility > Oracle Demantra Workflow Manager.\n\nThese two workflows are associated with integration interface profiles, which configure the series, levels, filters and other import details. The purge option for theses integration interface profiles Purge Option is set to Purge all data.\n\nPurging Data Before Import when using Integration Interfaces\n\nThe Integration Interface provides the ability to set purge and load options for each series. This controls whether the import integration profile overrides, accumulates, or purges (nulls out) the data for the specified integration profile date range.\n\nFor purge details, see the section \"Configure Series Load and Purge Options\" in the chapter \"Demantra Data Tables and Integration Processes\".\n\nImport Integration Profiles bring in forecasts such as manufacturing and sales forecasts, as well as data streams from Advanced Supply Chain Planning. For such data streams, setting the Purge Data Before Import profile option to 'Yes' causes the data in Oracle Demantra to be erased before importing the new version of the data stream. For a specific combination's data to be purged, at least one occurrence of the combination is required in the incoming data set. Thus the desired behavior is:\n\nOld Sales Forecast in Oracle Demantra Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 500 600 700\n\nCollected Sales Forecast Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 800 900 950\n\nRun the Integration Import profile with the Purge Option set to 'Purge All Data.'\n\nNew Sales Forecast in Oracle Demantra Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 800 900 950\n\nIn the example, the new sales forecast starts in February and not in January. Once the download takes place, Oracle Demantra shows a null value in January.\n\nThis contrasts with the following behavior, which is obtained by setting the 'Purge Data Before Import' integration profile option to 'No Purge'.\n\nOld Sales Forecast in Oracle Demantra Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 500 600 700\n\nCollected Sales Forecast Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 800 900 950\n\nRun the Integration Import profile with the Purge Option set to 'No Purge.'\n\nNew Sales Forecast in Oracle Demantra Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 500 800 900 950\n\nFor more information about using the integration interface to set purge and load options for each series, see Configure Series Load and Purge Options.\n\nUploading from Oracle Demantra\n\nOracle Demantra uses workflows to upload forecast and other relevant data to EBS Value Chain Planning applications, or to a legacy planning system. In particular:\n\nForecast and demand priority for Advanced Supply Chain Planning.\n\nForecast and forecast accuracy for Inventory Optimization.\n\nForecast for Strategic Network Optimization.\n\nIntermittent demand attributes for Inventory Optimization (used for the Safety Stock calculation).\n\nOracle Demantra Demand Management provides the following workflows:\n\nEBS Upload Local Forecast\n\nEBS Upload Global Zone Forecast\n\nEBS Upload Local Forecast, Demand Class\n\nEBS Upload Global Zone Forecast, Demand Class\n\nThe upload forecast workflow schema name: APPS is hard coded.\n\nThe global forecast is output at the “Customer/All Org” hierarchy level.\n\nOrganizations may belong to multiple instances.\n\nOracle Demantra calculates functional outputs for 26 weeks when the base time unit is 'Week', or for one year when the base time unit is 'Month'. See Setting and Modifying the Base Time Unit.\n\nThe profile parameters include:\n\nHorizon range and forecast output levels defined as part of integration profile\n\nMultiple data series tied to export integration profiles.\n\nThe data series internal names must follow the naming convention:\n\nForecast: FCST_\n\nPriority: PRTY_\n\nForecast accuracy MAPE: ACRY_MAPE_\n\nForecast accuracy MAD: ACRY_MAD\n\nDestination key: DKEY_\n\nUser-created series that users want to expose to downstream applications, such as Oracle Inventory Optimization, Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning, and Oracle Strategic Network Optimization, need to respect the above naming conventions and need to be added to user-created export integration profiles.\n\nNote: The Upload Forecast workflow schema name: APPS is hard coded.\n\nThe following integration profiles are manually launched as part of a Workflow after the forecast is approved:\n\nLocal Forecast\n\nSeries: Demand Priority, Final Forecast, Mean Absolute Pct Err, Item Destination Key, Organization Destination Key\n\nOutput Levels: Item, Organization, Week\n\nGlobal Zone Forecast\n\nSeries: Demand Priority, Final Forecast, Mean Absolute Pct Err, Item Destination Key\n\nOutput Levels: Item, Zone, Week\n\nLocal Forecast with Demand Class\n\nSeries: Demand Priority, Final Forecast, Mean Absolute Pct Err, Item Destination Key, Organization Destination Key\n\nOutput Levels: Item, Organization, Week, Demand Class\n\nGlobal Zone forecast, Demand Class\n\nSeries:Demand Priority, Final Forecast, Mean Absolute Pct Err, Item Destination Key\n\nOutput Levels: Item, Zone, Week, Demand Class\n\nUsing Alternate MAPE\n\nIn the four pre-configured integration profiles listed above, the in-sample MAPE series Mean Absolute Pct Err series is used. This series is automatically populated by the engine and due to its availability serves as the default MAPE value used. A more accurate out-of-sample MAPE value can be achieved but requires additional steps to be followed.\n\nAt the end of every planning cycles approved forecast should be archived and frozen, this is done by executing the Archive Forecast workflow\n\nAs new history becomes available archived forecast results are compared to actual historical results with the output generated as out-of-sample MAPE\n\nOut of sample MAPE can be seen in series 1 Month Fcst Lag WMape\n\nResults of this series can be saved in the Database using Batch Logic Engine workflow step. The Batch logic engine evaluates series including both server and client expression calculations and saves the resulting values. The Batch Logic Engine should be configured and executed at the level at which the weighted MAPE is most useful.\n\nIf available a series displaying the out of sample MAPE values can replace the series Mean Absolute Pct Err above\n\nApproval and Upload Process\n\nDuring implementation, the Administrator configures the approval process by specifying a Reviewer/Business Owner who is responsible for final approval of the forecast. One Business Owner (Final Approver) has final approval responsibility for the forecast produced by their group of Analysts. Approval is accomplished by use of a Final Approval Series by User Group and by workflow notifications. The Demand Forecast Workflow manages the planning cycle and calls the Planning Group Workflow that is used in the notification process.\n\nOracle seeds a user group setup with dummy users. The Administrator edits this group to add the names of the Analysts whose forecasts need approval from the Final Approver. The Administrator also edits a seeded Planning Group Workflow to specify the ID of the Final Approver notified when the Analysts' forecasts are ready for review. The seeded workflow can be used as a template if additional group workflows are needed. The Time Property is set to send an alert after four days if any Analysts have not completed their review, and sends an alert and times out after five days if any Analysts still have not completed their review.\n\nThis workflow:\n\nNotifies the Final Approver and Analysts that the Forecast is available\n\nPolls the users to check whether they are 'Done'.\n\nAfter four days, if any Analysts are not done, a messages is set to the Final Approver.\n\nAfter five days, if any Analysts are still not done, a message is again sent to the Final Approver, and the workflow times out. Processing returns to the calling workflow named: 'Demand Forecast'.\n\nIf all Analysts check 'Done.' before the time out occurs, the Final Approver is notified that the Analysts' forecasts are ready for review. Processing returns to the calling workflow named: 'Demand Forecast'.\n\nAnalysts are notified when a forecast is available for review and modification. After their modifications are complete, they select 'Done' in their My Tasks notification. The Workflow polls the user's status, and then notifies the Final Approver when all Analysts are done. If one or more Analysts have not finished their approvals one day prior to the due date, a reminder is sent to the Analysts and Final Approver. On the due date, if any Analyst has not finished their approval process, an exception message is sent to the Final Approver and Analysts to the effect that one or more Analysts have not completed their forecast adjustments.\n\nThe Final Approver can lock the forecast by checking the F. Approve check box. After review, the Final Approver either approves or disapproves the forecast. If not approved, the Final Approver contacts the Analysts whose adjustments are in question. This step is not part of the Workflow. If approved, the Final Approval check box is checked and the forecast locked. A notification is sent to the Administrator and the Analysts to the effect that the forecast is available for upload. The Administrator uploads the forecast and other relevant data to the Planning Server.\n\nAfter EP_LOAD completes successfully, the Final Approval and Final Approve By series are set to null, the Forecast is run, and a notification is sent to the Analysts and Final Approver with a Due Date specified.\n\nAnalysts analyze the forecast, make modifications and, when finished, select 'Done' in MyTasks for the forecast available task.\n\nThe Workflow polls the status of all Analysts in the User Group. When all Analysts have completed their approvals, a notification is sent to the Final Approver.\n\nIf all Analysts have not completed their adjustments, on the day before the due date, a reminder message is sent to the Analysts and Final Approver.\n\nOn the due date, if any Analyst has not completed their approval process, an exception message stating: 'One or more Analysts have not completed their adjustments' is sent to the Final Approver.\n\n4. The Final Approver can lock the forecast at any time by checking the 'Final Approval' column. After review, the Final Approver approves the forecast by selecting 'Done' in MyTasks for the forecast notification. For one level review:\n\nIf the Final Approver approves the forecast, a notification is sent to the Analysts and to the Administrator to initiate the upload.\n\nIf the Final Approver does not approve the forecast, s/he contacts the Analyst(s) whose adjustments are in question. This is not a Workflow step; it is a business process.\n\nIf the Administrator does not check the box in My Tasks within the specified time range, the Workflow times out.\n\nWhen the notification from the Final Approver is received, the Administrator uploads the forecast and other relevant information, for example: Demand Priority, Forecast Accuracy.\n\nLine Of Business\n\nWhen an implementation includes multiple business units, the business units require the batch engine to be executed at different times. Since every batch engine run creates a new forecast for the entire population, this could cause issues if the batch engine runs concurrently for different lines of business. A tailored process supports generating forecasts at different intervals across different parts of the business.\n\nThis process should be used when the following conditions apply:\n\nThere is a need for two or more distinct forecast cycles.\n\nThe populations requiring different forecast cycles are easily identifiable.\n\nThe population can be defined either as a member, or as members of one aggregation level, such as Segment, Organization, or Brand.\n\nImportant: The LOB engine, while smaller than the batch engine, can still be resource intensive and should not be run when users are in the system. The LOB engine should be activated and scheduled during user downtime and when the simulation engine is not on.\n\nLine of Business Solution Engine Process\n\nDefine the population participating in the LOB batch run.\n\nExclude all other populations from LOB batch run.\n\nRun the batch engine to generate a new forecast for the LOB population. Store the new forecast as a new forecast version.\n\nCopy the previous forecast version to the new forecast version for the non LOB population\n\nForecasting by Line of Business (LOB)\n\nImport:\n\nExisting APS and Oracle Demantra capabilities accommodate forecasting by line of business (LOB).\n\nYou can run Collections for a collections group. This restricts the uploaded forecast to the set of organizations that corresponds to a line of business.\n\nYou can download for a specific line of business by modifying the data security of the seeded import integration profiles. For data downloaded via EP_LOAD, which does not have a mechanism to control data scope, a business process is provided to stagger the timing of collections for the different lines of business.\n\nCaution: There is a risk that if multiple lines of business run collections very close in time to each other, a single EP_LOAD run may pull in data from multiple lines of business.\n\nThe Oracle Demantra forecasting engine will run forecasts only for combinations inside of a line of business by invoking the LOB process. Oracle provides user data security for LOB-specific access to data.\n\nA predefined stored procedure called from the LOB Process workflow updates database column do_forecast so that only combinations within the LOB are forecast and run the forecasting engine. The stored procedure also copies existing forecast numbers in the non line-of-business combinations into the new forecast version that is created by the running the forecast engine.\n\nExport:\n\nUpload data for a line of business only by modifying the data security of seeded export integration profiles.\n\nAn administrator user procedure creates export integration profiles with level value access filtered down to LOB scope.\n\nSee Creating a Data Export Profile.\n\nLOB Procedures\n\nFor the initial download, the DM/ SOP System Administrator specifies the organizations to be collected and downloaded during Shipment & Booking History Collection & Download with the Internal Sales Order parameter set to NO. When the processes complete, s/he logs into Business Modeler to add the name(s) of the LOB(s) to the preseeded LOB Level and associate the LOB(s) with the organizations that rollup to the LOB either by using the edit tools with a worksheet or Member Management. After the LOB is setup, Shipment & Booking History Collections & Download are rerun separately for each LOB, according to its planning cycle, with the ISO parameter set to YES. Users are given access to the LOB or restricted from accessing the LOB via User Security. The DM/SOP Sys Admin modifies the Line of Business - Forecast workflow and the Planning Group workflow for each LOB.\n\n.\n\nInitial setup for LOBs with ISOs:\n\nSet up Instance and include organizations that are part of an LOB\n\nRun Standard Collection and set up calendars, price lists and new products\n\nRun Shipment and Booking History Collection with the 'Collect Internal Sales Orders' parameter UNCHECKED for the initial Download\n\nIf the Admin mistakenly checks the 'Collect Internal Sales Orders' parameter for the initial Download, the Order Alignment feature, available in the first release of SOP, can be used to purge the series.\n\nAfter Download, add the LOBs as a member of the LOB level and associate the relevant organizations\n\nAssign the LOB to the relevant users via User Security in Business Modeler\n\nEnsure the users with access to the LOB are in the same User Group\n\nCreate a copy of the Planning Group workflow with the following changes\n\nSelect the User Group given access to the LOB as the recipient for the Group Step\n\nEnter the LOB's Final Approver's ID for the Completed/Incomplete steps\n\nRerun Shipment and Booking History Collection with 'Collect Internal Sales Orders' parameter checked\n\nEdit the SetLOBParameters' step in the Line of Business - Forecast workflow and set the parameters\n\nModify the Approval step in the Line of Business – Forecast workflow and enter the schema id of the relevant Planning Group workflow.\n\nStart the Line of Business – Forecast workflow\n\nThe following steps are done by the DM/SOP Sys Admin to setup a component for an LOB and handle ISOs.\n\nDM/SOP System Administrator Detailed LOB Setup\n\nSpecify the organizations of the LOB to be collected and downloaded when setting up Instances. For ease of use, Collection Groups can be used, but are not required, to group the LOB's organizations.\n\nSelecting Organizations of LOB 1\n\nSetup calendar, price lists and new products.\n\nComponents with multiple LOBs must use the same base time bucket.\n\nRun Shipment & Booking History collections for the Organizations specified in Step 1 with the Collect Internal Sales Order parameter set to NO:\n\nIf the Launch Download parameter is set to YES, proceed to Step 4\n\nIf Launch Download = NO, run the EBS Full Download workflow\n\nLOB Collection & Download\n\nOpen a worksheet with Line of Business and Organization as the selected Aggregation Levels\n\nRight click Line of Business>New Line of Business\n\nEnter the LOB's name and click Create\n\nAdd New Member to LOB Level\n\nFor each Organization that is a member of the LOB, right click the Organization>Edit Organization\n\nSelect the LOB from the dropdown list for Line of Business\n\nAssigning an Org to an LOB\n\nAssign the LOB(s) to the relevant users via User Security in Business Modeler\n\nAssigning LOB to Users\n\nEnsure the users with access to the LOB are in the same User Group with the Business Modeler menu Security>Modify Group\n\nFor each LOB, start Workflow Manager and create a copy of the Planning Group workflow. The recommendation is that the workflow name contains the LOB for which it is used, e.g. LOB1 Planning Group workflow. The following parameters must be changed::\n\nThe User Group selected as the recipient in the Group Step must be the Group given access to the LOB\n\nFinal Approver's ID for the Completed/Incomplete steps must be the user that approves the forecast for the LOB\n\nFor each LOB, using Workflow Manageredit Line of Business – Forecast workflow and change the parameters for step 'SetLOBParameters'. The parameter settings are:\n\nParameter 1 - should be comma (,) separated list of member descriptions.\n\nParameter 2 - should be level title..\n\nEdit the Approval process step in this workflow and enter the parameters to identify the Planning Group workflow for the specific LOB.\n\nThe Approval step in the workflow must have the LOB's Planning Group workflow schema number as the schema_id value\n\nRun Shipment & Booking History collections again for the Organizations or Collection Groups in Step1 with the Collect Internal Sales Order parameter set to YES:\n\nIf Launch Download = NO, run the EBS Full Download Workflow\n\nCollect Internal Sales Order Parameter\n\nDM/SOP System Administrator Post Initial Setup Process\n\nThe Collection & Download process is run for the specific LOB by specifying the Organizations or Collection Group that comprise the LOB in Shipment & Booking History collections\n\nRun the Line of Business - Forecast workflow\n\nRun LOB Reset workflow if the forecast workflow errors out\n\nUpload the forecast using the LOB specific Upload workflow when approval process completes\n\nArchive the forecast for all LOBs\n\nFor LOBs with different planning cycles, the forecast is archived on the more frequent schedule\n\nA business process must be put in place to manage the archiving schedule to avoid conflicts for LOBs with different planning cycles\n\nTroubleshooting the Line of Business Forecast Workflow\n\nIf problems occur during the LOB Process, the next attempt to run the Line of Business Forecast Workflow will not proceed. Due to the LOB process deactivating the non-LOB combinations, it is not desired to have the next LOB Process begin without successfully completing the previous run.\n\nTo remedy this, run the LOB Reset workflow. This workflow computes whether combinations should be active, and resets deactivation of the non-LOB population. Since this may take some time on larger environments LOB Reset is not automatically run as part of the Line of Business Forecast Process.\n\nMore information regarding the Line of Business Forecast Process can be seen in the Line of Business Forecast Workflow and in the table integration_lob_error.\n\nConfigure to Order\n\nConfigure to order products are configurations of components depending on the customer's preference. In most cases, this includes a selected base product (the model) and multiple optional (the options) and mandatory components. To use the Configure to Order feature in Demantra with EBS data, a number of parameters and profile options need to be set. The collection process exports the standard series with the addition of the BOM. A number of upload workflows are available to upload the Demantra forecast dimensions, organization and period back to EBS.\n\nThis section includes the following information about CTO:\n\nDemantra Setup\n\nOracle EBS Setup\n\nCollecting Data from EBS to Demantra\n\nUploading Demantra Plans and Factors to EBS\n\nRunning CTO Procedures\n\nWorkflows and Integration Data Profiles\n\nAssociating Multiple Price Lists with a CTO Worksheet\n\nRecurring Item with Multiple Parents in a BOM\n\nImporting CTO Data from a Non-Oracle System\n\nInformation about the functional aspects of configure to order is in Oracle Demantra Demand Management User's Guide.\n\nDemantra Setup\n\nA number of Demantra settings need to be set to support CTO functionality. They include:\n\nCTO_Calc_PP_Forecast\n\nCTO_Enable_Worksheet_Calculations\n\nCTO_History_Periods\n\nCTO_Planning_Percentage_Choice\n\nAll of the CTO parameters are accessible through the Business Modeler. From the Parameters menu, choose System Parameters, then System tab.\n\nCTO_Calc_PP_Forecast\n\nThe CTO_Cal_PP_Forecast parameter specifies whether you want to forecast planning percentages. The default is No.\n\nCTO_Enable_Worksheet_Calculations\n\nThis parameters controls whether planning percentages are automatically calculated when a worksheet is updated. The default is Yes.\n\nCTO_History Periods\n\nCTO_HISTORY _PERIODS specifies the number of historical periods to average for the history planning percentage calculation. The default is 0. If set to 0, then no historical dependent demand will be generated. It is recommended to keep the planning percentage calculation period shorter than 52 weeks as planning percentages from an average of 52 or even 26 weeks ago may be very different than current values. If options generally have demand every week, a calculation span of 26, 13, or even 8 periods may be more accurate. If options demand will be fairly sparse, setting the parameter to 52 or 26 weeks may be appropriate.\n\nCTO_Planning_Percentage_Choice\n\nCTO_PLANNING_PERCENTAGE_CHOICE specifies the planning percentage to use when series Planning Percentage Choice calculates the dependent information in Forecast Dependent Demand.\n\nThe default is Existing; that means to use the downloaded planning percentages from Oracle e-Business Suite that are in series Planning Percentages - Existing.\n\nThe other option is to have Oracle Demantra calculate planning percentages based on history and forecast of options.\n\nOracle EBS Setup\n\nA number of Oracle EBS profiles need to be set to support CTO functionality. They include:\n\nMSD_DEM: Calculate Planning Percentage\n\nMSD_DEM: Explode Demand Method\n\nMSD_DEM: Include Dependent Demand\n\nMSD_DEM: Two-Level Planning\n\nOracle EBS profile options can be set by using the Advanced Supply Chain Planner, Standard responsibility, Other, then Profiles.\n\nMSD_DEM: Calculate Planning Percentage\n\nMSD_DEM: Calculate Planning Percentage: Use this profile option to specify upon what entities to calculate planning percentages. This occurs when system parameter CTO_PLANNING_PERCENTAGE_CHOICE instructs Oracle Demantra to calculate planning percentages.\n\nDo not change the setting of this profile option after the initial download or invalid combinations may result:\n\nThe typical reason for changing this value is to correct a setup error.\n\nIn that case, delete the invalid combinations and re-download. See Implementation Considerations.\n\nThe default is Null. Valid vales are:\n\nYes for Consume & Derive Options and Option Classes: Include the sales history of options and option classes\n\nYes for Consume & Derive Options only: Include the sales history of options to model and removes option classes. Use it for assemble to order situations.\n\nYes for all the Options and Option Classes: Include the sales history of options and option classes including optional components of product families able to be forecasted that have Forecast Control None.\n\nNote: It is recommended to set this parameter to Yes, for All Options and Option Classes before running shipping and booking history for Configure to Order.\n\nMSD_DEM: Explode Demand Method\n\nMSD_DEM Explode Demand Method: Use this profile option to specify where to calculate dependent demand and derive planning percentages. Valid values are\n\nOrganization Specific: Calculate dependent demand and derive planning percentages at each organization.\n\nGlobal: Calculate planning percentages at the global level and apply to all organization. The default is Organization Specific.\n\nMSD_DEM: Include Dependent Demand\n\nMSD_DEM: Include Dependent Demand: Use this profile option to specify whether the collections process should include configure to order structures, demand, and history. Valid values are:\n\nYes: Include configure to order structures, demand, and history\n\nNo: Do not include configure to order structures, demand, and history. This is the default\n\nMSD_DEM: Two-Level Planning\n\nMSD_DEM: Two-Level Planning: Use this profile option to specify that way that the collections process should collect family members and their sales histories. Valid values are:\n\nExclude family members with forecast control 'None'. This is the default. Collect:\n\nOnly the product family members and their sales history from the organization specified in profile option MSD_DEM: Master Organization for which the forecast control is set to Consume or Consume and derive.\n\nThe master organization product families from the organization specified in profile, MSD_DEM: Master Organization for which the forecast control is set to Consume or Consume and Derive and the planning method for the product family is set to other than Not Planned.\n\nAll the items and their sales history--even if they are not related to a product family--for all the enabled organizations for which the forecast control is Consume or Consume and Derive. These items are rolled up to the pseudo-product family Other.\n\nCollect all family members and their sales histories. Collect:\n\nThe same entities as setting Exclude family members with forecast control 'None'.\n\nAll the product family members and their sales history from the organization specified in profile option MSD_DEM: Master Organization regardless of the forecast control, as long as the product family forecast control is Consume or Consume and Derive and the planning method for product family and all of its members are set to other than Not Planned.\n\nAdditional Implementation Considerations\n\nThe series Final Plng Pct, is a client expression and is accurate at the lowest level, for example, Item-Org. When viewing worksheets at levels higher than the lowest level, use the series Final Plng Pct – Aggregate.\n\nThe concurrent program Purge CTO Data deletes all data from the configure to order general level related tables. However the items are not deleted from the Oracle Demantra Demand Management-related tables. This program, only available as a Request, is used when an undesired option was selected from Profile MSD_DEM: Calculate Planning Percentage option and a download run. Run the purge is run-- the profile option value changes to your desired option-- and re-execute the download.\n\nRun the workflow CTO Calcs after the forecast is calculated either as part of a workflow or manually as the dependent demand calculations are done after the forecast has been generated. This workflow runs automatically by the seeded workflows for configure to order. However, be aware of the workflow run order in case you have customizations.\n\nIn a configure to order worksheet, if an option class, for example Harddrive, is filtered out of the worksheet, it's children are filtered out also, for example 120gig Harddrive, 200gig Harddrive.\n\nIf an option class is not in a worksheet but the independent demand of its base model is changed, the changes are propagated to the option class and its children.\n\nIf an option class is in the worksheet but its children are not, changes to the option classes dependent demand are propagated to its children.\n\nIf an option class is the child of another option class and its parent's dependent demand is changed, the changes must be propagated to its children\n\nIn worksheets, you can turn a Summary Row in the worksheet by configure to order level on and off.\n\nYou can use subtab notes at the configure to order level.\n\nReview upload forecast processes, select an appropriate one, and develop a procedure for initiating it.\n\nChange worksheet filters to appropriate values after implementation.\n\nCollecting Data from EBS to Demantra\n\nDownload - e-Business Suite To Demantra\n\nThe standard EBS-Demantra collection process brings configure to order data into Oracle Demantra. It:\n\nBrings history streams, level members, and bill structures.\n\nRuns Collect BOM when the profile option MSD_DEM: Include Dependent Demand has a value of Yes, which brings the following information to Oracle Demantra:\n\nItem\n\nParent Item\n\nBase Model\n\nOrganization\n\nBOM Eff Start Date\n\nBOM Eff End Date\n\nPlng Pct- Existing\n\nDownloads the planning percentages from the source when the CTO Download Existing Planning Pcts is run. You can also run this workflow by itself between full downloads.\n\nOracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning loads and processes the data for Consensus Total Demand and Planning Percentage information for models and their options as follows:\n\nModel Forecast Control = Consume or Consume & Derive\n\nOptions Forecast Control = None\n\nOracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning explodes the forecast from model to option using the Oracle Demantra Demand Management planning percentages\n\nOracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning loads and processes the data for Consensus Total Demand and Planning Percentage information for product families and their children as follows:\n\nModel Forecast Control = Consume or Consume & Derive\n\nOptions Forecast Control = Consume or Consume & Derive\n\nOracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning explodes the option's Consensus Total Demand to find its independent and dependent demand.\n\nUploading Demantra Plans and Factors to EBS\n\nData that moves from Oracle Demantra to Oracle e-Business Suite includes:\n\nConsensus Total Demand, Final Plng Pct, MAPE CTO, and Demand Priority for all models and options to Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning\n\nIndependent Demand for options with a forecast control of NONE to Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning; these options do not have dependent demand\n\nConsensus Total Demand & MAPE CTO for base models to Oracle Inventory Optimization\n\nTo move configure to order data from Oracle Demantra into Oracle e-Business Suite, use upload workflows:\n\nFor uploading Consensus Forecast and Final Forecast Dependent Demand, MAPE CTO, and Demand Priority (information for models and their options), use the CTO Upload workflows\n\nFor uploading product family and item level Consensus Forecast and Product Family ratios, MAPE CTO, and Demand Priority (information for product families and their children), use the CTO Upload Product Family workflows\n\nWhen you upload planning percentages to Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning, you do so at the level Item-Organization for items with item attribute Forecast Control set to None. Oracle Advanced Supply Chain Planning uses the Oracle Demantra planning percentages to explode demand from model to option class to model.\n\nThe publishing process will export planning percentages at either an aggregated level or by \"top level\" model, based on the value of the profile option \"MSD_DEM: Publish CTO Forecast Percentage by Top-level Model. If this option is set to No (the default), then planning percentages for each option will be aggregated across base models during export. If it is set to Yes, then plann"
