        "text": "Maybe this is falling into the VC consensus of ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about the team‚Äù and naively disagreeing with Don Valentine‚Äôs ‚Äúalways focus on the market ‚Äî the size of the market, the dynamics of the market, the nature of the competition‚Äù but we believe one very rarely comes across a team that truly has an unfair advantage for doing what they do.\n\nThe co-founders of Aforza, Dominic, Nick, and Ed, have that.\n\nThey traveled the journey from Salesforce to Veeva to Vlocity where they:\n\nüê±‚Äçüíª pushed the Salesforce product platform to its limits and learnt its architecture inside out\n\nüå± brought new, innovative vertical cloud products to the market within the Salesforce ecosystem\n\nüîù were among the early employees to lead European expansions of Veeva* & Vlocity**, and the best performing sales leaders with stellar experience of building high-performing teams around them.\n\n*Veeva is the most highly valued (+$50bn market cap) Industry Cloud company operating in the Pharma sector\n\n**Vlocity is the Industry Cloud company for Telco & Energy (and few other) sectors which was acquired by Salesforce for $1.5bn in 2020\n\nDominic ‚Äî a renowned veteran of the Salesforce ecosystem with decades of experience successfully leading Industry Cloud companies, and the founding story of Aforza\n\nTo shine little light on Dominic‚Äôs (co-founder, CEO of Aforza) background, he was one of the first employees of Salesforce in Europe when it had roughly 50 FTEs. He grew to lead the Global Sales Engineering team and ultimately to be part of Marc Benioff‚Äôs ‚ÄòPresident‚Äôs Committee‚Äô. The depth of Dominic‚Äôs network within Salesforce ecosystem is second to none.\n\nThen led the European operations for Veeva contributing significantly to its success to become the most successful Industry Cloud company to date.\n\nBefore setting up Aforza, the founders of Veeva, who had just set up Vlocity, brought Dominic in (again) as the first employee and the GM to build Vlocity‚Äôs European operations, which at the time became Vlocity‚Äôs largest market segment.\n\nAfter significantly contributing to the success stories of two of the most well-known vertical cloud companies, Dominic for sure had built the competencies and network to do it again.\n\nAfter experiencing the initial spark from Nestle‚Äôs manual retail execution processes in Kuala Lumpur, Dominic, with Nick and Ed, saw that no one had built an Industry Cloud focused on the Consumer Goods sector.\n\nSo, they started building one.\n\nIt is challenging or almost impossible to think of a team profile that could know the vertical SaaS playbook better than Dominic, Ed & Nick given their experiences and track record from Salesforce, Veeva and Vlocity.\n\nAnd of course, they provided stellar references even from the very top of Salesforce which just fuelled our excitement.\n\nExtreme talent attraction\n\nDominic, Ed & Nick brought in 4 new high-calibre VPs without recruiters in less than a year. This was during a very challenging business environment (c19) with very limited traction and funding while making significant product releases.\n\nI have never seen this level of talent attraction before.\n\nIt speaks great deal about the leadership skills and capabilities of Dom, Nick & Ed as talent attraction is just very hard and likely the number 1 factor contributing to whether an early-stage technology business will become successful or not. +Brett from Bonfire wrote an amazing post on talent attraction/recruiting recently.\n\nBenchmark product velocity / engineering talent\n\nIn about 12 months, Aforza had built an enterprise Consumer Goods cloud platform ready for general availability. Since then the R&D team, led by Nick, has been introducing new, complete product modules with highly differentiated capabilities, like real-time promotion execution, active customer segmentation and AI-driven predictive ordering, at a pace that is unmatched in the industry.\n\nTo add, it is not just one product but several core products (REX, TPM, DSD, CRM) in cloud, mobile & tablet, as well as utilizing both Google‚Äôs AI/ML & Salesforces‚Äôs CRM infrastructure.\n\nIt was not just us who were amazed by the speed and quality of the product development but we heard similar feedback on the innovation speed from Aforza‚Äôs customers, partners and even from some prospects. Product velocity is something that I really appreciate as a venture investor.\n\nConsumer Goods (CG) brands are losing up to 25% of their annual sales driven by inadequate retail execution (REX) capabilities, and the industry could add +$100 billion in aggregate sales if they removed out-of-stocks.\n\nBoth Gartner and McKinsey say that the same CG brands invest up to 20‚Äì25% of their revenues in trade promotions, that is, hundreds of $ billions annually, and only 30‚Äì40% of these promotions are profitable (McKinsey article).\n\nOnly 30‚Äì40% of investments totaling hundreds of $ billions are delivering a positive ROI ‚Äî I‚Äôm still having difficulties to grasp the magnitude of wasted resources here, and the opportunity Aforza is going after.\n\nWe believe there are three core issues in the CG software landscape contributing to this:\n\n1) Integrating field sales point-solutions to the existing horizontal ERP, CRM, eCommerce stack does not scale.\n\nBolting mobile sales/retail execution point-solutions (REX) like StayInFront, MC1, Spring Global, Repsly or GoSpotCheck on to existing horizontal (usually legacy) software stack is expensive. Building and maintaining these integrations can take years and very often these projects end up failing ‚Äî not just due to the heavy integration and customization work required, but also because the resulting UX of a stitched together stack is just not up to today‚Äôs standards. This drives low adoption resulting in limited or negative ROI.\n\n2) Trade promotion management solutions offer limited ROI as they are disconnected from field execution\n\nA typical Consumer Goods ‚Äòpromotion lifecycle‚Äô with the existing trade promotion management (TPM) point-solutions is where:\n\nFinance allocates the budget ‚Äî but can‚Äôt see the results of the spend (in excel / ERP)\n\nPlanners design the promotions ‚Äî but can‚Äôt impact in-field execution (in TPM solution)\n\nSales struggle to convey promotions and ensure compliance to its rules (in field sales app / REX solution)\n\nRetailers struggle to understand the value of the promotions resulting in weak in-store execution and compliance\n\nThis leads into wrong promotions being offered to wrong customers at the wrong time, and to 70% of trade promotions losing money. The existing TPM solutions fail to understand what is executed in the stores vs. what is planned at the HQ as there is disconnect between REX and TPM solutions.\n\nToday‚Äôs dynamic Consumer Goods environment requires an agile TPM software that is natively connected to REX, can assess the performance of promotions with high confidence, and can adjust promotions in real-time (vs. once every 1 to 2 years) to utilize the intel collected from the field and to truly drive trade promotion ROI.\n\n3) CG data operating complexity has significantly increased\n\nConsumer Goods companies already operate with enormous amount of data (think of the number of transactions or end-customers of a CG brand). The increasing number of promotions, channels, and software applications is just intensifying this data operating complexity. CG brands require a high-quality data infrastructure and processing capabilities that the existing TPM, REX and CRM software vendors are struggling to provide. Again, this is a stack consisting of point-solution softwares integrated to horizontal platforms which were not built for the needs of the Consumer Goods industry in the first place.\n\nAforza ‚Äî the Industry Cloud for the Consumer Goods sector\n\nAforza applies modern AI and cloud technologies to improve trade promotion management (TPM), field sales, and retail execution (REX) processes of Consumer Goods (CG) companies.\n\nThey help CG companies to achieve significantly higher ROI on trade promotions, higher revenue growth and more efficient sales processes ‚Äî this is in comparison to what they could achieve with homegrown or competing REX/TPM point-solutions integrated with large horizontal software vendors like Oracle or SAP.\n\nWith Aforza‚Äôs industry-specific suite of mobile and cloud applications, the Consumer Goods‚Ä¶\n\nsales planners, leaders and key account managers improve TPM, visit and route planning processes,\n\nsales execs sell more via modern-UX applications with penny-perfect pricing and AI-driven recommendations,\n\nmerchandisers do store visits, mobile audits, and surveys more effectively (online & offline),\n\nvan sales teams and drivers deliver, sell, and collect payments more effectively with real-time inventory info.\n\nProduct differentiation ‚Äî four key aspects\n\nHigh product differentiation is one of the most important aspects we are looking for in new investments. It is also nicely illustrated in Ali Tamaseb‚Äôs recent masterpiece ‚ÄúSuper Founders‚Äù as one of the rare factors that significantly differentiated unicorn companies from the non-unicorn control group.\n\nAmong all the REX, TPM and CRM vendors in the Consumer Goods space, Aforza stands out with four aspects which make the platform truly unique.\n\n1) An end-to-end Industry Cloud vision\n\nAforza‚Äôs vision is to deliver a complete end-to-end Consumer Goods Industry Cloud that connects planning, execution, trade promotion optimization, ecommerce, digital asset management, payments, and many new CG focused product modules in the future. It is an all-in-one platform including all the most important CG-focused applications with consumer-grade UX which makes Aforza a compelling and an incredibly important piece of software for any CG company ‚Äî similarly as Veeva or Vlocity are for any Pharma or Telco & Energy companies.\n\nThere are no other software vendors serving the CG sector with a similar end-to-end Industry Cloud vision.\n\n2) Cloud platform that natively connects promotions to execution\n\nAforza is the only product that natively connects TPM with REX, direct-store-delivery (DSD), and CRM on aligned, modern-UX workflows.\n\nWhen planning promotions in Aforza‚Äôs TPM application, they automatically feed into the order capture experience of the field sales executive (in the REX application), so the sales teams are always up to date on the latest promotions, and the promotions teams get real-time insight into how their promotions are performing in the field ‚Äî Photos Photiades Distributors is a great customer example. Again, this is with zero integration or customization work between the REX, TPM and the CRM applications.\n\nSome competing platforms like SAP, Oracle/Demantra, Exceedra/AFS, and Kantar Retail, have product modules for REX, or TPM, or DSD ‚Äî these bolted-on product extensions come from various legacy architectures which makes the end-user workflows cumbersome, trade promotion insights limited, and the UX poor. A CG executive we spoke with and who had this type of stack, had actually named it Frankensteinüëæ.\n\n3) Standout, consumer-grade UX that drives adoption and ROI\n\nIf a sales executive doesn‚Äôt know how to use the retail execution mobile app in a couple of clicks, she‚Äôs just not going to use it. UX is such an underappreciated factor in enterprise software as it is one of the key drivers behind end-user adoption and whether a software investment delivers its expected ROI.\n\nWe were extremely happy to hear the customer feedback on Aforza‚Äôs UX which confirmed what we had seen from Nick‚Äôs (co-founder, CPO of Aforza) product demos so far ‚Äî Aforza‚Äôs UX is on a different level compared to any other CG software vendors.\n\nPerhaps the best validation is Andrew‚Äôs (SVP Marketing at Aforza) 8-year-old daughter picking up the field sales mobile app right awayüôÇ, and Aforza customer Superfoam digitizing its sales execution and going live in 5 weeks which is unheard of for a product of this depth.\n\n4) Powerful AI-driven product recommendation and automation suite that works both online and offline\n\nAforza is elegantly built on top of Salesforce Platform (prev. force.com) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This is a powerful combination which leverages the best of breed CRM and AI/ML capabilities of two world-leading cloud companies that Nick (co-founder, CPO of Aforza) knows extremely well. At Salesforce, he was responsible for leading some of the most cutting-edge mobile and cloud work pushing Salesforce‚Äôs architecture to its limits.\n\nThe insightful architectural design choice of building on top of GCP created an important competitive advantage at the foundation of Aforza, as, to our knowledge, there are no large CG software vendors that could match Aforza‚Äôs machine learning, data processing, and automation capabilities. This reflects well the level of thoughtfulness and software building capabilities of Nick & the rest of team.\n\nWhy AI/ML capabilities are so important in the Consumer Goods sector? Running large scale trade promotion optimization or driving penny-perfect pricing or automatic product recommendations based on previous orders and inventory levels on mobile in offline environment ‚Äî few core, differentiating value drivers of Aforza ‚Äî require AI/ML infrastructure that we think only GCP can provide right now."
