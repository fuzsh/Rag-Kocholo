        "text": "Just to give you some background. I have been implementing a QV system and apps since 2011 in a multisite, multinational, multicurrency and multilanguage division and have been serving around 50% of my time as the one-man-band, meaning upgrading the server (from 9 to 11.20 SR6), developing, designing, educating myself and users and maintaining tens of QVapps. The rest of my time was filled in supporting users across division with an ERP system and a few Oracle applications (HFM, Demantra).\n\nSince the availability of QV.next 0.90 and 0.95 and now of Qlik Sense, I played with a bit, I have a feeling this is, currently, like a lightweight version of QV/Tableau (as I can read, but am not familiar) or those old OLAP apps. It is nice users can drag-and-drop dimensions and, in advance prepared, measures but this will create a mess in an organization. In my 3 years of implementing QV in various countries in the EMEA and AP regions I haven't met a single user interested enough to learn and build his/her own objects. Maybe just because they were able to play with cycle-groups and pivot tables I developed for them to answer their questions.\n\nAnd those (pivot tables and cycle-groups to mention just a few) are not currently available in Qlik Sense. I am not interested in workarounds as they exist in QV and should be re-developed in Qlik Sense as well. I mean, one would expect that a new tool has at least all key features available in its predecessor or role model and on top of that a few new.\n\nI am also very sorry that we can only import scripts and have to build from scratch the front-end (to be honest, not from scratch but, hopefully, copy-paste formulas and properties if they all exist in Qlik Sense, as re-developing them all will be a great waste of time) with hundreds of sheets and objects of different type.\n\nI understand this is not QV 12 and both will have separate development paths until gradually converged in the future into one product, but this is going to take a lot more time than anticipated. Qlik Sense is, for me, still a beta release and hope QV will not lose its strong focus in QlikTech.\n\nHopefully all current QV customers will stay in the Qlik world and a lot new ones will join us in the future. I do hope so, as I like QV a lot. It is just that there is no that \"wow\" effect with Qlik Sense as you can still get from QV.\n\nMaybe I missed a point or two here but this is how I feel.\n\nThank you"
