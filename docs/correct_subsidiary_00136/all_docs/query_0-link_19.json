This chapter describes how to maintain security.\n\nThis chapter covers the following topics:\n\nCreating or Modifying a Component\n\nDeleting a Component\n\nCreating or Modifying a User\n\nCopying a User\n\nDeleting a User\n\nCreating or Modifying a User Group\n\nDeleting a Group\n\nProviding Access to the Workflow Editor\n\nLogging onto the Demantra Local Application Administrator\n\nDefining a Program Group\n\nRedefining a Program Group\n\nDeleting a Program Group\n\nSpecifying Permissions for Menu Items\n\nLogging Out Users\n\nCreating or Modifying a Component\n\nTo create or modify a component\n\nClick Components > Create/Open Component. Or click the Create/Open Component button.\n\nNote: This option may not be available, depending on the user name with which you logged onto Business Modeler.\n\nThe Create/Open Component dialog box appears.\n\nNow do one of the following:\n\nTo create a new component, click the New Component button and then click OK. Or double-click the New Component icon.\n\nNote: This option is available only if you log into Business Modeler as the user with the highest permission.\n\nTo open an existing component, double-click the icon corresponding to the component. Or click the icon and then click OK.\n\nThe Component Configuration Wizard displays its first dialog box.\n\nEnter or edit general information for the user interface, as follows:\n\nComponent Name Unique name for this component. Component Description Description About Window Description Optional description to include in the About page of this component.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe Business Modeler displays the Available Series and Selected Series lists.\n\nSelect the series that should be available in the component.\n\nMove all series that you want into the Selected Series list, using any of the techniques in “Working with Lists”.\n\nRemove any unwanted series from the Selected Series list.\n\nWhen you are done specifying series, click Next.\n\nNote: By default, this configuration affects all users of this component. To hide additional series for a given user, see “Creating or Modifying a User”.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe Business Modeler displays the Select Component Indicators for Series window. Here you specify w hich series should have indicators to indicate associated promotions or notes.\n\nWithin a worksheet, a user can attach a promotion (in the case of Promotion Effectiveness) or a note to a given item-location combination, at a given date. If a series has been configured as using an indicator for that particular promotion or note, the series will be displayed with an indicator in all worksheet cells that correspond to that item-location combination and date.\n\nYou can associate an indicator for any general level at the lowest level (that is, any general level that do not have child levels).\n\nThe default associations are different for different kinds of series. Sales series have notes indicators by default. Promotion series have both notes and promotion indicators by default.\n\nThis configuration affects all users of this component. No further fine tuning is possible.\n\nTo associate indicators with different series, do the following for each general level:\n\nIn Select Indicator, select the general level, either Note or Promotion.\n\nMove all series that should use the associated indicator into the Selected Series list, using any of the techniques in “Working with Lists”.\n\nRemove any unwanted series from the Selected Series list.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe system displays all the levels and indicates the current permission settings in this component.\n\nThe following icons indicate the permissions:\n\nFC Full control (including permission to delete members) W Read/write access R Read access X No access\n\nFor each level that you want to change, right-click the level and select the appropriate permission:\n\nNo Access (the user does not have access to this member; this option is equivalent to not including this member in the filter)\n\nRead Only (the user can view this member but cannot make any changes)\n\nWrite (the user can view or edit this member)\n\nFull Control (user can view, edit, create, and delete within this member)\n\nSystem Default (use the default permission controlled by the DefaultLevelSecurityAccess parameter.\n\nNote: By default, this configuration affects all users of this component. To fine tune permissions for a given user, see “Creating or Modifying a User”.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe system displays the Available Units and Selected Units lists.\n\nSelect the units of measure that should be available in the component.\n\nMove all units that you want into the Selected Units list, using any of the techniques in “Working with Lists”.\n\nRemove any unwanted units from the Selected Units list.\n\nNote: This configuration affects all users of this component. No further fine tuning is possible.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe system displays the Available Indexes and Exchange Rates and Selected Indexes and Exchange Rates lists.\n\nSelect the indexes and exch ange rates that should be available in the component.\n\nMove all indexes and exchange rates that you want into the Selected Indexes and Exchange Rates list, using any of the techniques in “Working with Lists”.\n\nRemove any unwanted indexes and exchange rates from the Selected Indexes and Exchange Rates list.\n\nNote: This configuration affects all users of this component. No further fine tuning is possible.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe next dialog box allows you to associate public worksheets with levels.\n\nThis association is used in two ways:\n\nWithin the Members Browser, a user can use the right-click menu to open any of these associated worksheets directly from a member of the level (via the Open With menu option). In this case, Demantra opens the associated worksheet. The worksheet is filtered to show only data relevant to the member.\n\nA worksheet can include an embedded worksheet that shows details for the member that is currently selected in the worksheet. Specifically, within the worksheet designer, users can add a subtab to a worksheet. The subtab consists of any of the worksheets that are associated with a level included in the main worksheet. The embedded worksheet is filtered to show only data relevant to the member.\n\nNote: This configuration affects all users of this component. No further fine tuning is possible.\n\nAt this point, do one of the following:\n\nTo continue without associating any worksheets and levels, click Next.\n\nTo associate a worksheet with a level, do the following:\n\nClick the level in the Select Level dropdown menu.\n\nDouble-click the worksheet in Available Queries list, which moves it to the Selected Queries list.\n\nMove other worksheets from the Available Queries list to the Selected Queries list, as needed.\n\nDecide which worksheet in the Selected Queries list should be the default worksheet for this level. For that worksheet, click the Default check box. When the user right-clicks and selects Open, this is the worksheet that will be used.\n\nWhen you are done on this screen, click Next.\n\nIf you are using the PE Analytical Engine, the system displays engine profiles that could potentially be used within this component. The Business Modeler displays the Available Engine Profiles and Selected Engine Profiles lists.\n\nSelect the engine profiles that should be available in the component. Profiles can be used only with the Promotion Effectiveness engine.\n\nMove all profiles that you want into the Selected Engine Profiles list, using any of the techniques in “Working with Lists”.\n\nRemove any unwanted profiles from the Selected Engine Profiles list.\n\nWhen you are done specifying profiles, click Next.\n\nNote: This configuration affects all users of this component. No further fine tuning is possible.\n\nIn the next step, you specify the user name and password of the user who owns the component. This user will be able to log into the Business Modeler and create additional users for this component.\n\nTo specify the owner of the component:\n\nIn the User Name box, type the user name.\n\nIn the User Password box, type the user password.\n\nTo exit and save the configuration, click OK.\n\nModify the newly created user so that it has access to the appropriate Demantra modules. To do so, use the Security menu; see “Creating or Modifying a User”.\n\nDeleting a Component\n\nTo delete a component\n\nClick Components > Create/Open Component. Or click the Create/Open Component button.\n\nNote: This option may not be available, depending on the user name with which you logged onto Business Modeler.\n\nThe Create/Open Component dialog box appears.\n\nClick the icon corresponding to the component.\n\nClick Delete.\n\nClick Yes to confirm the deletion.\n\nCreating or Modifying a User\n\nYou can create additional users to work within the component you own.\n\nWarning: When passing sensitive information (uid/password) to new users, be sure to use a secure mechanism (not just email).\n\nTo create or modify a user\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler”.\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify User. Or click the Create/Modify User button.\n\nThe Create/Modify User dialog box appears.\n\nNext:\n\nTo create a new user, click the New User button, and then click OK.\n\nTo modify a user, click the button of that user then click OK. Or double-click the icon of the user whose details you want to modify.\n\nThe User Details dialog box appears.\n\nSpecif y basic user details as follows:\n\nUnder Enter User Details, type the following information in the appropriate boxes (or select from the drop down lists):\n\nThe user name, password, permission level, and the language in which the system will be operated. Each user name must be unique within your Demantra implementation.\n\nThe first and last name of the user, the company name, phone and fax number, and the email address. If you set up automated email within workflows, it is important to make sure the email address is correct here.\n\nNote: The Integration User check box is not currently supported.\n\nFor Permission Level, see “Permission Levels”.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe User Modules dialog box appears. Here you specify which Demantra user interfaces this user can access.\n\nClick the check box next to each module that the user needs. Then click Next.\n\nIf you are logged in as the component owner and the user's permission level is 'System Manager', then the following two options will be enabled for selection (otherwise, they will be disabled):\n\nDemantra Administrative Tools – Select this option if you want the user to be able to access the Engine Administrator, Chaining Management, and Member Management applications as well as all functions in the Business Modeler except the Security function.\n\nSecurity Management - Select this option if you want the user to be able to access the Security function within the Business Modeler. The Security function is used to create new, or modify existing, users and user groups.\n\nNote that only component owners can grant access to the Security Management and Administrative Tools modules and that these modules can only be granted to Users with a Permission Level of System Manager\n\nUsers with access to the 'Security Management' module will be able to:\n\nMaintain (create, copy, modify, and delete) any users with the same or lower module access then they have themselves. For example, if User A does not have access to the Demand Management module, then that user will not be able to maintain other users that do have access to that module.\n\nMaintain Series, User Filters, and User Groups for the Users that they can maintain. This is true regardless of the Series, User Filters, and User Groups that they have access to. For example, even if User A does not have access to the Series “Mfg Profit,” User A can still grant access to that series to other Users.\n\nThe New User - Select User Series di alog box appears. This dialog box allows you to determine what data series will be active for the new user, from the entire set of series in this component. Each list is a collapsible list of series groups and the series in them.\n\nIf a User does not have access to either the Demantra Administrative Tools module or the Security Management module, then they can login to Business Modeler, but can only change their password.\n\nIf a series is not active for a user, it is not available when the user creates worksheets and is not viewable in existing worksheets to which the user has access.\n\nSpecify the series that a user can see, as follows:\n\nMove all series that you want into the Selected Series list. To do so, either double-click each series or drag and drop it.\n\nRemove any unwanted series from the Selected Series list.\n\nNote: You can also move an entire series group from one list to the other in the same way.\n\nWhen you are done specifying series, click Next.\n\nThe New User - Select User Filters dialog box appears. This dialog box let s you filter the data that the user can see; specifically, you control which levels and which members of those levels the user can see.\n\nFilter the data that the user can see, as follows:\n\nClick a level in the left side of the dialog box and drag it to the box on the right. Or double-click a level in the left side.\n\nNow specify which members of this level the user can see. To do so, click a member in the list, and then click the right arrow button. Or double-click the member you want to filter out.\n\nThe system moves the selected members to the box on the lower right side, as in this example:\n\nNow the user can see only the selected members of this level. In the preceding example, the user can see only data that is associated with the Rainbow brand.\n\nNote: The Selected Members list cannot include more than 200 members.\n\nIn the lower right, refine the security settings that control the access that the user has to each member. To do so, in the Access column, click one of the following:\n\nFull Control (user can view, edit, create, and delete within this member)\n\nRead & Write (the user can view or edit this member)\n\nRead only (the user can view this member but cannot make any changes)\n\nNo access (the user does not have access to this member; this option is equivalent to not including this member in the filter)\n\nSystem Default (use the default permission controlled by the DefaultContentSecurityAccess parameter)\n\nRepeat the preceding steps for each filter you want to add. Each filter automatically limits the choices available in subsequent filters.\n\nWhen you have appropriately filtered data for the user, click Next.\n\nThe New User - Select User Groups dialog box appears. This dialog box allows you to select the group or groups to which the new user will belong.\n\nSpecify the collaboration groups to which a user belongs, as follows:\n\nMove all groups to which the user should belong into the Selected Groups list. To do so, either double-click each group or drag and drop it.\n\nNote: You can also select and move multiple groups with the standard Ctrl+click or Shift+click actions.\n\nRemove any unwanted groups from the Selected Groups list.\n\nClick Next.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nFor more information, see API to Create, Modify or Delete Users, Copying a User, and Deleting a User.\n\nCopying a User\n\nIf you need to create multiple similar users, it is useful to create one of those users and then copy it to create the other users.\n\nTo copy a user\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify User. Or click the Create/Modify User button.\n\nThe Create/Modify User dialog box appears.\n\nClick the button of the user you want to copy, and then click Create Copy.\n\nThe User Details dialog box appears. Some of the information, such as user name, is blank. Other details, such as the company name, are copied from the original user.\n\nSpecify the user name and password for the new user.\n\nMake other changes as needed.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nClick Next to continue editing information for the new user. Demantra initially uses all the same values as for the original user.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nDemantra also copies menu permissions of the original user; see “Specifying Permissions for Menu Items”.\n\nSee also\n\n“Creating or Modifying a User”\n\nDeleting a User\n\nWarning: When a user is deleted, the current session is not immediately stopped. To stop the user from continuing operation, use the web user management page to log out the user and terminate their session.\n\nTo delete a user\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify User. Or click the Create/Modify User button.\n\nThe Create/Modify User dialog box appears.\n\nClick the button of the user you want to delete, and then click Delete.\n\nA question box appears, inquiring if you are sure you want to delete the selected user.\n\nTo delete the selected user, click Yes.\n\nSee also\n\n“Creating or Modifying a User”\n\nCreating or Modifying a User Group\n\nDemantra uses user groups for several purposes:\n\nGroup members can collaborate, within the Demantra Local Application.\n\nThe Workflow Engine can send tasks to groups (as well as to users).\n\nGroups can be authorized to view and edit notes attached to worksheets.\n\nGroups can authorized to use menu items.\n\nGroups are visible in all components. Note that the users in a group can belong to different components.\n\nTo create or modify a group\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify Group. Or click the Create/Modify User Group button.\n\nThe Create/Modify Group dialog box appears.\n\nNext:\n\nTo create a new group, double-click the New Group button.\n\nTo modify a group, click the button of that group then click OK. Or double-click the icon of the group whose details you want to modify.\n\nThe system prompts you for information about the group.\n\nSpecify group details as follows:\n\nUnder Enter Group Details, type a name and optional description in the appropriate boxes. Each group name must be unique within your Demantra implementation.\n\nIf users of this group should be able to see either other in the Who's Online pane in the Demantra Local Application, make sure the Collaboration Group check box is checked. To access the Workflow Manager, a User Group must be assigned to the workflow.group parameter (in the Business Modeler). For details, refer to Providing Access to the Workflow Editor.\n\nThe users will also be able to send tasks to each other.\n\nIf you clear this check box, users of the group will not see one another.\n\nCheck or clear the Enable Cascade Filters Toggle check box.\n\nClick this option to enable users in the group to toggle between cascade and non-cascade filter modes. If not selected, the user will have cascade filtering only.\n\nIn cascade mode, users see only members that have combinations with the previously selected members. Members that do not have combinations will not be available in the list. It is generally easier to work with filters in cascade mode.\n\nIn non-cascade mode, users see all the members of the selected level regardless of the previously selected members from other levels.\n\nNote: If Cascade Filters are enabled, you can define whether they should initially be toggled on or toggled off. To do this you need to set the value for the column CASCADE_FILTERS_DEF_VAL in the table GROUP_ATTRIBUTES_POPULATION. A value of 1 means that Cascade Filters are initially toggled on. A value of 0 or null means they are initially toggled off. The default is 1. You set this value using a database utility such as Oracle SQL Developer. If Cascade Filters are not enabled then this setting has no effect.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe New Group - Select Group Users dialog box appears. This dialog box allows you to select existing users who will belong to the new group.\n\nSpecify the users in a group, as follows:\n\nMove all users that should be in this group into the Selected Users list. To do so, either double-click each user name or drag and drop it.\n\nNote: You can also select and move multiple users with the standard Ctrl+click or Shift+click actions.\n\nRemove any unwanted users from the Selected Users list.\n\nClick Next.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nSee Also\n\n“Data Security”\n\n“Deleting a Group”\n\nDeleting a Group\n\nTo delete a group\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify Group. Or click the Create/Modify Group button.\n\nThe Create/Modify Group dialog box appears.\n\nClick the button of the group that you want to delete.\n\nA box appears, inquiring if you are sure you want to delete the selected group.\n\nClick Delete.\n\nSee also\n\n“Data Security”\n\n“Creating or Modifying a User Group”\n\nProviding Access to the Workflow Editor\n\nCaution: Access to the Workflow Manager, including the ability to add and edit a workflow, should only be provided to key users. Workflows are used to drive many administrative flows and critical behind-the-scene processes, including data loading, purging, and execution of the analytical engine.\n\nFor a given user to log into the Workflow Editor, that user must be configured a specific way.\n\nTo provide access to the Workflow Editor\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nCreate a group that includes all users who need to log into the Workflow Editor. See “Creating or Modifying a User Group”.\n\nUsing a database tool, query the user_security_group table (i.e. select * from user_security_group). The results will list the group_name and corresponding application_id for each group. For example, for the workflow group_name 'Collaborator', the application_id is 'USER_GROUP:5'.\n\nObtain the application_id of the newly-created group.\n\nSet the workflow.group parameter in the APS_PARAMS table using the Business Modeler. Go to Parameters > System Parameters > Application Server > Workflow (tab). Add the application ID from the query above to the existing values for this parameter (separate values with a comma), save the changes, and then restart the application server.\n\nSee also\n\n“Managing Workflows” in the Oracle Demantra Implementation Guide\n\nLogging onto the Demantra Local Application Administrator\n\nYou use the Demantra Local Application Administrator to control access to menu items.\n\nTo log onto the Demantra Local Application Administrator\n\nOpen the administration login page:\n\nhttp://server name/virtual directory/portal/adminLogin.jsp\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://frodo/demantra/portal/adminLogin.jsp\n\nEnter the user name and password and click Log on.\n\nDemantra displays the Administration page, which includes the following choices:\n\nSee also\n\n“Defining a Program Group”\n\n“Specifying Permissions for Menu Items”\n\n“Customizing Demantra Web Pages”\n\nDefining a Program Group\n\nA program group is a collection of menu items, typically related to each other in some way. You create program groups so that you can easily control access to all the menu items in the group; see “Specifying Permissions for Menu Items”.\n\nDemantra provides several predefined program groups, for convenience. These program groups contain only menu items from the right-click menus.\n\nProgram group Menu items in this group, by default Add New member right-click menu option for every level in the system. Edit Edit member Unmapped Conditional Text: HelpOnly\n\nright-click menu option for every level in the system. Delete Delete member right-click menu option for every level in the system. View View member right-click menu option for every level in the system. Copy Copy, Paste, and Paste from Clipboard right-click menu options for every applicable level in the system. (Note that this option is available only for promotional-type levels.) Open Open and Open With right-click menu options for every level in the system.\n\nTo define a program group\n\nLog into the Demantra Local Application Administrator. See “Logging onto the Demantra Local Application Administrator”.\n\nThe Administration page appears.\n\nClick Define Program Groups.\n\nThe system displays a page that lists the existing program groups.\n\nClick the Add Program Group button.\n\nDemantra displays a page where you can define a new program group:\n\nFor Name and Description, specify a name and optional description for this program group.\n\nOptionally select an item from the Program Type Filter selection list, to reduce the number of menus and menus items shown on this screen.\n\nTo display only options on the right-click menus, click Object Menu.\n\nTo display only options on the menu bars, click Menu.\n\nOptionally select a level from the Level Filter selection list, to reduce the number of menus and menus items shown on this screen. (This filtering is available only if you are viewing right-click menus.)\n\nRedefining a Program Group\n\nTo redefine a program group\n\nClick Define Program Groups.\n\nThe system displays a page that lists the existing program groups.\n\nIn the row corresponding to the group you want to redefine, click the Edit Program Group button.\n\nDemantra displays a page where you can edit this program group.\n\nOptionally edit the Name and Description.\n\nOptionally select an item from the Program Type Filter selection list, to reduce the number of menus and menus items shown on this screen.\n\nTo display only options on the right-click menus, click Object Menu.\n\nTo display only options on the menu bars, click Menu.\n\nOptionally select a level from the Level Filter selection list, to reduce the number of menus and menus items shown on this screen. (This filtering is available only if you are viewing right-click menus.)\n\nIn the table, expand the menus as needed.\n\nIn the Selected column, select the check box for each menu item to include within this program group.\n\nClick OK.\n\nSee also\n\n“Deleting a Program Group”\n\nDeleting a Program Group\n\nTo delete a program group\n\nLog into the Demantra Local Application Administrator.
