Oracle ASCP Features • Unconstrained, constrained, and optimized plans across supply chain • Plan considers both resource and material constraints (or either) • One plan for all planning levels across multiple time horizons and organizations using ONE data model • Supports alternate resources, alternate routings, alternate BOM’s, substitutions, alternate sourcing, co-products and simultaneous resources • Simulation Capability • Workflow-Driven Exception Messaging • Plan at Execution Level, Operation Level, Strategic Level based on user defined buckets\n\n21.

Click to edit Master title style Click to edit Master text styles Features and Concepts\n\n24.  Oracle ASCP respects the following order modifiers (in order)  Fixed Days Supply - FDS  Fixed Order Quantity - FOQ  Fixed Lot Multiplier - FLM  Minimum Order Quantity - MOQ  Maximum Order Quantity - MOQ  Round Order Quantity - ROQ  For ‘buy from’ supply order - Supplier order modifiers, if not then item attribute order modifiers  For ‘make at’ and ‘transfer from’ supply orders - Item attribute order modifiers Order Modifiers\n\n25.  Standard  Supply and demand prioritized on daily basis  Firm supplies are considered  Priority Pegging  Pegged in First Pass in the “Firm Supply Allocation Window”  Demand Window & Supply Window are considered  Priority/ FIFO pegging  Pegged in First Pass in the “Firm Supply Allocation Window”  Uses the daily FIFO logic in the Second Pass once Firm Supplies are consumed FIFO pegging Uses the daily FIFO logic in the Second Pass once Firm Supplies are consumed Pegging Options with ASCP\n\n26.  Planning Time Fence  Future time inside which no new planned orders nor rescheduling in existing orders is done.  Purchase requisitions and internal requisitions are not subject to planning time fence processes.  Release Time Fence  Allow automatic release of planned orders as standard discrete jobs or as purchase requisitions Time Fences\n\n27. Time Fences Only Sales Orders Only Forecasts Demand Time Fence Planning Time Fence No new orders, No reschedules in Create, change and reduce planned orders Automatically release planned orders Release Time Fence\n\n28. Types of Resources Lot Based Resource consumption is independent of the lot size Same processing time irrespective of the number of items Can be constrained or unconstrained or unplanned Typically to model setup time or tact time E.g. Furnace Resource consumption is based on units processed Can be constrained or unconstrained or unplanned Typically capacity is modeled as item based resource E.g. Testers Item Based\n\n29. Lot Resource 1 Process Time 2 hrs/ Lot Resource Scheduling Lot12 hrs Lot2 2 hrs Item BC2XX Lot 1 – 2000 Units Lot 2 – 1000 Units Item Resource 1 Process Time 250 units/ hr Lot2 – 4 hrsLot1 - 8 hrs To consider a resource as “Constrained” we need to set it as planned and add it to the Bottleneck Resource Group specified in the plan (incase we are not planning for all the resources)\n\n30. Resource X Resource Y Primary Resource X Start : September-01-2003 End : March-31-2004 Primary Resource Y Start : April-01-2004 End : ∞ September-01-2003 ～ March-31-2004 → Resource X : Primary Resource Y : Alternate April-01-2004 ～ ∞ → Resource Y : Primary Alternate Resource can be set. • Preferred Resource is judged based on priorities • Use operation effectivity to switch between primary and alternate resources Operation Item A Alternate Resources\n\n31.  Sourcing rules answer the question “From where does plant X get part A”  Bill of Distribution specifies a multilevel replenishment network of warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing plants and trading partners across multiple organizations  Options – Make at, Buy from or Transfer from  The following are respected by the ASCP Engine  Time–phased replenishment strategy  Splitting demand according to sourcing percentages  Rank to prioritize the sourcing supplier/ organization  Supplier lead time/ order modifiers/ capacity  Alternate movement incase capacity cant meet the demand  Both are assigned to items under an Assignment Set Sourcing Rule & Bill of Distribution\n\n32.  The selections respect supplier capacity based on the following logic:  Rank 1 ‘buy from’ suppliers respecting percentage allocations when available capacity exists for all suppliers.  Lower ‘buy from’ suppliers if no Rank 1 suppliers have available capacity but the lower rank suppliers have available capacity.  The primary Rank 1 supplier if there are no suppliers at any rank with any available capacity left. This is true for both unconstrained and constrained plans. Sourcing Percentage & Ranks\n\n33. Safety Stock Supply ASCP traces the “real” supply that resulted in the safety stock supply and pegs the sales order demand to that supply Time 100 50 Safety Stock Levels Time Safety Stock Demand = 100 Safety Stock Supply = 50 On Hand Supply = 100 Supplies DemandsSales Order Demand = 50 100 50\n\n34. Forecast Expiration  Customers submit Demand Forecasts over a distributed time horizon and want a commitment on how much of each weekly forecast quantity can be met on time  If a forecast cannot be met on time, the supply runs late and consumes capacity in future weeks  When many demands are late, it is difficult to tell what forecast quantity could be met on time each week  ASCP takes the following values to consider expiration –  Maximum Allowable Days Late  Maximum Allowable Days Late before Forecast Expiration\n\n35.  Fulfill customer demand on time by substituting a more functionally rich product, when the requested item is not available.  Substitution is done to consume existing inventory of older or meet demand date with a functionally equivalent or superior item.  Substitution as per rules based on  Direction in which substitution is effective  Effective dates  Partial Order Fulfillment flag for the relationship  Customer and customer site for a substitution relationship End Item Substitution\n\n36. Op. 1 Op. 2 Op. 3 Routing X Op. 4 Op. 1 Op. 5 Op. 4 Routing Y Op. 6 Alternate Routing can be set. ・Preferred Routing is judged based on priorities. ・Routings can be switched based on effective dates. Child Item B Alternate BOM can be set. ・Preferred BOM is judged based on priorities. ・BOMs can be switched based on effective dates. Child Item C Parent Item A Item A Alternate Bill and Routings\n\n37. Operation Co-products are produced as a result of some operation and are produced based on co-product rate. 60% 40% Item A Item A’ Co-Products and Substitutes\n\n38. Forecast Spreading & Consumption  Forecast is generated and maintained at an aggregate (week, month, quarter) time level  Desirable to spread the periodic forecast demand evenly across workday calendar to provide a realistic estimate of the future demand pattern.  Restrict ASCP forecast consumption such that forecasts for any bucket will be consumed by sales orders for the corresponding forecast bucket only.\n\n39. Item Lead Time  Buy Items  The total lead-time of buy order has three components  pre-processing lead-time (purchase order preparation)  processing lead-time (time vendor needs the order before delivery to your dock)  post processing lead-time (time to move from receiving to inventory)  Lead times logic is in the order of listing:  Processing lead-time as in Approved Supplier list  Item attribute processing lead time\n\n40. Supplier Capacity Constraints  Plan based on Supplier Capacity Constraints  Effectivity dates for time phased capacity definition  Supplier-Specific Lead Times  Delivery/Reception Frequency Calendars  to reflect the days the supplier can deliver the order  Supplier-Specific Order Modifiers for the supplied quantities  Minimum order quantity or Fixed lot multiplier\n\n41.  Planned Inventory Points  Major stocking phases in manufacturing cycle  Jobs continue till PIP level even without a valid demand  Schedules the unpegged jobs after the pegged jobs  In semiconductor manufacturing  Wafers processed in furnace oxidize if left for some time  In the Fab after acid cleaning, parts need to be re-cleaned if they are left alone for some time  Between the fab and testing, performance is measured and the production process is adjusted accordingly. If work orders spend too much time it affects process control and yields. Planned Inventory Points\n\n42. Plan Types/Planning Methods Global Vs Vs Local"
