This Buyer's Workbench is a central desktop from which buyers can efficiently perform their daily tasks, such as viewing and acting upon demand, creating purchase orders, managing excess inventories, managing investment purchases. What are the benefits The key benefit is to AUTOMATE the forecasting, netting, and purchase order review/creation into a streamlined process. Integrated workbench for Planners and Buyers Improving Inventory Management and Order Management by the use of forecasting tools and other advanced supply chain features. Easily integrates with all Oracle Application modules such as Supplier Management, Inventory, Sales Orders, Demand Planning, Transportation Management, Warehouse Management, Financials and Purchasing.\n\n35. Menu item FIN11 Employee Expenses Processing What is it This function provides an automated streamline processing of employee expenses. With Oracle Internet Expenses, employees can enter and submit expense reports using a standard Web browser or a Web-enabled mobile device. Oracle Approval Management Engine automatically routes expense reports for approval to the concerned approvers based on configurable conditions like Project/Non-Project related expenditures, Expense Amount approval limits etc. Further, reimbursement policies are enforced at the time of creating expense reports. Oracle Internet Expenses integrates with Oracle Payables to provide quick processing of expense reports for payment Oracle Payables provides a feature that is specifically intended for employee expenses, and by combining that with the Oracle Payments and Oracle Projects functions, an integration is established that charges your employee expenses directly to a project or cost center and requires only the approval of an appropriate manager to have the expenses reimbursed following a specific time schedule and approval amount limit. What are the benefits Complete Audit Trail from Expense Report Creation till Payment Employee expenses are integrated with Master Card or Visa Credit Card providers Expense Report can be created offline in an Excel template and then it can be imported into I-expenses Automatic auditing of Expense Report that are complying with organization policies without having to Audit all Expense Report thereby resulting in saving of time Automatic routing of Expense approvals and notification to cost centre owners etc. as per the hierarchy existing in Oracle\n\n36. Menu item FIN12: eInvoicing XML import What is it The procurement invoice is one of the most used documents in today’s business. Every organization has to deal with incoming invoices. However in most of the cases it is still treated as a few hundred years ago, it is printed and send via normal postal routes. The last couple of years there has been some progress but it has not led to one optimized efficient solution which is always applied. There are a lot of different processes which are used. Capgemini’s invoicing solution holds a generic adapter which can be applied to several ERP systems such as the Oracle E-Business Suite, SAP and JD-Edwards. It offers an integrated set of applications that are engineered to work together. The bulk processing will be done by the use of an adapter that will process XML files with the use of Oracle’s XML Gateway. XML Gateway is a set of services that allows easy integration with the E-Business Suite to support XML messaging. The Oracle E-Business Suite utilizes the Oracle Workflow Business Event System to support event based XML message creation and consumption. A business event that can occur is the receiving of a invoice. This will result in the automatic processing of the file. What are the benefits The key benefit is to automate processes that are otherwise performed manually: Invoice processing improves through automatic purchase order matching Just in time invoice payments increase cash forecast efficiency Paper invoices reduced\n\n37. e-Invoicing Menu Item Electronic invoice processing with Oracle eBS.

Zoom on Subscription Based Pricing\n\n40. Philosophy of the Oracle Lifecycle Services offering Oracle Lifecycle – a new breed of productized services … Catalogue-based, off-the-shelf service Complete lifecycle thinking: with standardized Value Management and innovation components Simple & appealing commercial model: Subscription-based pricing and flexible contracting Highly standardized and highly industrialized, yet flexible offering Clearly defined scope : Out-of-scope services are not part of the fixed subscription fee, but will be delivered at extra charge as FP or T&M service … Moving away from one-off projects/implementations to investments mutualized across multiple clients\n\n41. There is a clear market trend and a strong Capgemini response – “Application Lifecycle Services” and “Oracle Lifecycle” There is a clear market trend identified by analysts, new models are asked for by our clients and our competition has partially picked up on this trend. We have a holistic answer “Application Lifecycle Services” Application Lifecycle Services Oracle Lifecycle Services classical classical current current new new TREND TREND Following the trend towards value based pricing, lifecycle concepts and productized services is essential to survive in the market and it clearly offers new chances: Moving away from pressures on rate cards Chances to improve margin through standardization & re-use Value based pricing as an opportunity to improve margins Pricing Schemes  Engagement Types  (i) Time & Material (ii) Fixed Price (iii) Use based (iv) Value based (a) Resourcing - (b) Build (on requirements) (c) Run (maintain) - (d) (Run) / Build / Run (e) Run / RaIn / Run (Run, Rationalize, Innovate, Run) (f) Productized Services (from a catalogue) -\n\n42. Commercial Model for Oracle Lifecycle Services: Subscription Pricing & Rolling Contracts Subscription Pricing Fixed fee for a defined service scope (productized service as described in the catalogue) AM and AD components are combined into one monthly fee paid over 3-5 yrs. Lifecycle contract term Standardized pricing approach (fixed formula and parameters) based on an NPV-break-even calculation Subscription pricing involves vendor financing (by spreading initial AD costs across the deal term  CAPEX to OPEX for clients) Central Apps team is working with group Finance to build a “template” for vendor financing involving external financing facilities This means moving away from effort/cost based pricing towards a market price for a package Flexible Contracting (”Rolling Contracts”) Targeting ROLLING CONTRACTs for Oracle Lifecycle reflects the true lifecycle thinking of the ALS philosophy by Institutionalizing value discussions and formalizing a (bi)annual roadmap creation Instead of engaging with a client in a 5+ year contract and only thinking about renewal when the final year of the term has arrived, a rolling contract aims at shorter overall contract durations (e.g. 3 yrs.) and at instant renewals of the relationship with the client after the first year already. This approach is seamlessly integrated with our mandatory Value Management component. As a result of annual or bi-annual value creation meetings with the client, CG aims to renew the client relationship for a new (e.g.) 3-yr. term annually.\n\n43. Cost determination (explained) Product impact on run Product maintenace Product developement Client implementation Cost of capital Product costs per month Interest compensation for deferred income Creating the ultimate reusable Mutualized costs Complexity dependant implementation costs More sales lower the investment costs Expected contract duration Annual interest rate = monthly rate at compund interest Menu item investment f or a specific client Interested monthly menu item costs Decoupling effort from payment Monthly operational costs Generic + specific maintenance Total cost per month != commercial price! Keeping the solution current, fresh and attractive Making sure the solution is working For the client\n\n44. Upgrade Offering\n\n45.
