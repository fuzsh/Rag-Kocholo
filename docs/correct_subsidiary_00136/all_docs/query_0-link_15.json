        "text": "To provide extra information to describe members of the level. You can view and edit this information.\n\nTo provide a further subdivision of the level data. To do this, you add an attribute to a level and select an option to create it as a child level. For example, suppose you create an attribute called ABC. If ABC can have the values A, B, or C, and if you create this attribute as a level, then the ABC level would have three members: A, B, and C. The member A, for example, would consist of all the data that had the A value for this attribute, within the parent level.\n\nFor the purpose of exporting or importing data.\n\nTo describe promotions. Promotion attributes are converted into promotional causal factors. Applies only to Promotion Effectiveness.\n\nItem levels organize data in ways that reflect product properties such as product family, color, style, and so on. Each member of an item level represents time-dependent data aggregated according to some attribute of the item being sold.\n\nLocation levels group and aggregate data according to characteristics of the locations where you sell. For example, location levels could describe geography or types of stores.\n\nCombination (or matrix) levels group and aggregate data according to characteristics of the item-location combinations. These are less common than item and location levels.\n\nTime levels group and aggregate data by sales date. Normally you use a time level in place of the time axis.\n\nPromotion levels group and aggregate data by sales promotions. Depending on how your system is implemented, you may have a hierarchy of promotional levels (to organize the promotions), and the higher levels might use different icon.\n\nUnlike other kinds of levels, promotion levels can be displayed within a Gantt chart. Promotion levels are available only with Promotion Effectiveness.\n\nSettlement levels, which are used only by DSM. In general, a settlement is an outstanding sum of money that needs to be resolved, related to a promotion. If you use a settlement level in a worksheet, you cannot use levels from any other hierarchy in that worksheet.\n\nCheck request levels, which are used only by DSM. A check request is an instruction to send a check to a customer or designated third party. Check requests are exported to the accounting systems that actually perform them.\n\nItem and location levels are the most common.Levels are organized into hierarchies, and each level can have attributes."
