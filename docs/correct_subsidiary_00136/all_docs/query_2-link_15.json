Index JR286 – Current configuration AS Is forecasting process Current Pain Points What Demantra brings in How problems can be solved To be process\n\n3. Truth About Demand Planning\n\n4. Demand Management: How people knew it so far…. Difficult to aggregate forecasting at multiple levels Category Level/Family Level/Product Level/Customer Level ..and more.. Long forecasting cycles – End-to-End cycles are time confusing Batch Process – real time information is not present Forecast accuracy- Poor forecast accuracy leads to unsatisfied customers Not scalable :- most companies don’t know how to deal with increased number of customers and opportunties Factors – its difficult to apply seasonality and other factors\n\n5. The sad stories continue.. Too many version s of the same forecast is present Revenue Planning is being done offline / manually Manual Efforts require to collate the data such as shipment history, backlog. Lacks the ability to archive various forecasts No visibility of off-cycle forecast changes Different departments forecast in different units of measure, and thus cannot be merged to have a single demand plan – Marketing: % of market share by brand – Sales: revenue by customer/territory – Finance: Revenue and net profits per quarter – Supply Chain: SKU by ship-to location (advanced)\n\n6. Here is what happens afterwards\n\n7. Opportunities Can something be done after all?\n\n8. Opportunities Improved reporting at all levels of an organization Better measurement and metrics Feed the best forecast to plan and generate commitment plan back from ASCP Ability to capture multiple forecasts and compare Enable Statistical forecasting Monitoring of demand forecast at multiple levels More accurate demand forecast Ability to provide better & fast supply dates for changes/enquiries Easy delegation/approval process thru workflow Role base security to avoid sharing of unnecessary data\n\n10. Demantra’s End-to-End Solution Shape Demand Understand Demand Respond to Demand Plan for Demand Demand Management Trade Promotion Management Real-Time Sales and Operations Planning Business Process Platform\n\n11. Demantra: Forecasting Capabilities Statistical forecasting using Causal factors Inbuilt New product introduction Mapping Unlimited Hierarchies , Dimensions, Levels and Attributes Mixed/Multiple Demand Signals Ability to measure/track the past performance Bayesian Collaboration\n\n12. Oracle Demantra – Causal Forecasting Estimating techniques based on the assumption that the variable to be forecast (dependent variable) has cause-and-effect relationship with one or more other (independent) variables.\n\n13. Reaction to Market Demantra can sense the causal factors and catalysts for demand change and apply them for future demands It has a unique capability of separating trends & cycles from the causal factors\n\n14. Near Real-time Forecast Revision Demantra can quickly manipulate the forecast by intelligently understanding the deviation\n\n15.

Today, our users can create, edit, and revise complex bill of materials in a fraction of the time it would take otherwise.&quot; -- Shuji Kuroki , Global Master Center Lead, Sony Semiconductor Kyushu Corporation “ The Triniti solution has successfully delivered a scalable, automated process reducing at least 6hrs a day of manual WIP input to minutes and pulled up to 7 days of slack out of our supply data. We plan to develop several reports with summary and drill down data leading to dashboard KPI’s from the data available as a result of our implementation.” --Troy Dawson, Director ERP Systems Microtune\n\n24.
