        "text": "Other Security Features\n\nTip: The Demantra Local Application replaces Collaborator Workbench. You may see both names in this text.\n\nThis chapter covers the following topics:\n\nThe SysAdmin User\n\nCreating or Modifying a User\n\nCopying a User\n\nDeleting a User\n\nCreating or Modifying a User Group\n\nDeleting a Group\n\nLogging Out Users\n\nChanging Your Password\n\nPassword Policy\n\nMutual Authentication\n\nLogging Messages of the Application Server\n\nViewing the Workflow Process Log\n\nSpecifying Content Pane Security\n\nChecking the Log Files and Tables\n\nThe SysAdmin User\n\nThe SysAdmin user is a predefined, highly secure user account that can be used to define new or additional Demantra components (similar to the seeded components, which include DM, AFDM, S&OP, and PTP). Demantra users only need this account when defining new Demantra components or need to change lost component passwords.\n\nThe Permission Level for the SysAdmin user is 'System Manager'. This is the same permission level for all Demantra component owners, including dm, sop, and ptp.\n\nCaution: The password for the SysAdmin user account should only be assigned to trusted administrators within the organization.\n\nBy default, the SysAdmin user only has access to the following modules:\n\nDemantra Administrative Tools\n\nSecurity Management\n\nOracle does not recommend adding any other modules as this user is meant to only for a specific administrative role. For more information about these modules, refer to \"Creating or Modifying a User\" in the Oracle Demantra Implementation Guide.\n\nA password for this user must be entered when installing or upgrading to the Demantra version in which this user was added. Please make sure administrator installing Demantra notes the SysAdmin password as it is impossible to reset without help from Oracle support.\n\nOnly the SysAdmin user can modify the SysAdmin account. To do this, log into the Business Modeler as SysAdmin and follow the instructions in \"Creating or Modifying a User\" in the Oracle Demantra Implementation Guide. Alternatively, log into the Business Modeler as the SysAdmin user, choose Components > Create/Open component, select a component, and navigate to the User Name screen.\n\nWhen the SysAdmin user's password expires, the user is prompted to change it.\n\nCreating or Modifying a User\n\nYou can create additional users to work within the component you own.\n\nWarning: When passing sensitive information (uid/password) to new users, be sure to use a secure mechanism (not just email).\n\nTo create or modify a user\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler”.\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify User. Or click the Create/Modify User button.\n\nThe Create/Modify User dialog box appears.\n\nNext:\n\nTo create a new user, click the New User button, and then click OK.\n\nTo modify a user, click the button of that user then click OK. Or double-click the icon of the user whose details you want to modify.\n\nThe User Details dialog box appears.\n\nSpecif y basic user details as follows:\n\nUnder Enter User Details, type the following information in the appropriate boxes (or select from the drop down lists):\n\nThe user name, password, permission level, and the language in which the system will be operated. Each user name must be unique within your Demantra implementation.\n\nThe first and last name of the user, the company name, phone and fax number, and the email address. If you set up automated email within workflows, it is important to make sure the email address is correct here.\n\nNote: The Integration User check box is not currently supported.\n\nFor Permission Level, see “Permission Levels”.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe User Modules dialog box appears. Here you specify which Demantra user interfaces this user can access.\n\nClick the check box next to each module that the user needs. Then click Next.\n\nIf you are logged in as the component owner and the user's permission level is 'System Manager', then the following two options will be enabled for selection (otherwise, they will be disabled):\n\nDemantra Administrative Tools – Select this option if you want the user to be able to access the Engine Administrator, Chaining Management, and Member Management applications as well as all functions in the Business Modeler except the Security function.\n\nSecurity Management - Select this option if you want the user to be able to access the Security function within the Business Modeler. The Security function is used to create new, or modify existing, users and user groups.\n\nNote that only component owners can grant access to the Security Management and Administrative Tools modules and that these modules can only be granted to Users with a Permission Level of System Manager\n\nUsers with access to the 'Security Management' module will be able to:\n\nMaintain (create, copy, modify, and delete) any users with the same or lower module access then they have themselves. For example, if User A does not have access to the Demand Management module, then that user will not be able to maintain other users that do have access to that module.\n\nMaintain Series, User Filters, and User Groups for the Users that they can maintain. This is true regardless of the Series, User Filters, and User Groups that they have access to. For example, even if User A does not have access to the Series “Mfg Profit,” User A can still grant access to that series to other Users.\n\nThe New User - Select User Series di alog box appears. This dialog box allows you to determine what data series will be active for the new user, from the entire set of series in this component. Each list is a collapsible list of series groups and the series in them.\n\nIf a User does not have access to either the Demantra Administrative Tools module or the Security Management module, then they can login to Business Modeler, but can only change their password.\n\nIf a series is not active for a user, it is not available when the user creates worksheets and is not viewable in existing worksheets to which the user has access.\n\nSpecify the series that a user can see, as follows:\n\nMove all series that you want into the Selected Series list. To do so, either double-click each series or drag and drop it.\n\nRemove any unwanted series from the Selected Series list.\n\nNote: You can also move an entire series group from one list to the other in the same way.\n\nWhen you are done specifying series, click Next.\n\nThe New User - Select User Filters dialog box appears. This dialog box let s you filter the data that the user can see; specifically, you control which levels and which members of those levels the user can see.\n\nFilter the data that the user can see, as follows:\n\nClick a level in the left side of the dialog box and drag it to the box on the right. Or double-click a level in the left side.\n\nNow specify which members of this level the user can see. To do so, click a member in the list, and then click the right arrow button. Or double-click the member you want to filter out.\n\nThe system moves the selected members to the box on the lower right side, as in this example:\n\nNow the user can see only the selected members of this level. In the preceding example, the user can see only data that is associated with the Rainbow brand.\n\nNote: The Selected Members list cannot include more than 200 members.\n\nIn the lower right, refine the security settings that control the access that the user has to each member. To do so, in the Access column, click one of the following:\n\nFull Control (user can view, edit, create, and delete within this member)\n\nRead & Write (the user can view or edit this member)\n\nRead only (the user can view this member but cannot make any changes)\n\nNo access (the user does not have access to this member; this option is equivalent to not including this member in the filter)\n\nSystem Default (use the default permission controlled by the DefaultContentSecurityAccess parameter)\n\nRepeat the preceding steps for each filter you want to add. Each filter automatically limits the choices available in subsequent filters.\n\nWhen you have appropriately filtered data for the user, click Next.\n\nThe New User - Select User Groups dialog box appears. This dialog box allows you to select the group or groups to which the new user will belong.\n\nSpecify the collaboration groups to which a user belongs, as follows:\n\nMove all groups to which the user should belong into the Selected Groups list. To do so, either double-click each group or drag and drop it.\n\nNote: You can also select and move multiple groups with the standard Ctrl+click or Shift+click actions.\n\nRemove any unwanted groups from the Selected Groups list.\n\nClick Next.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nFor more information, see API to Create, Modify or Delete Users, Copying a User, and Deleting a User.\n\nCopying a User\n\nIf you need to create multiple similar users, it is useful to create one of those users and then copy it to create the other users.\n\nTo copy a user\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify User. Or click the Create/Modify User button.\n\nThe Create/Modify User dialog box appears.\n\nClick the button of the user you want to copy, and then click Create Copy.\n\nThe User Details dialog box appears. Some of the information, such as user name, is blank. Other details, such as the company name, are copied from the original user.\n\nSpecify the user name and password for the new user.\n\nMake other changes as needed.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nClick Next to continue editing information for the new user. Demantra initially uses all the same values as for the original user.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nDemantra also copies menu permissions of the original user; see “Specifying Permissions for Menu Items”.\n\nSee also\n\n“Creating or Modifying a User”\n\nDeleting a User\n\nWarning: When a user is deleted, the current session is not immediately stopped. To stop the user from continuing operation, use the web user management page to log out the user and terminate their session.\n\nTo delete a user\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify User. Or click the Create/Modify User button.\n\nThe Create/Modify User dialog box appears.\n\nClick the button of the user you want to delete, and then click Delete.\n\nA question box appears, inquiring if you are sure you want to delete the selected user.\n\nTo delete the selected user, click Yes.\n\nSee also\n\n“Creating or Modifying a User”\n\nCreating or Modifying a User Group\n\nDemantra uses user groups for several purposes:\n\nGroup members can collaborate, within Collaborator Workbench.\n\nThe Workflow Engine can send tasks to groups (as well as to users).\n\nGroups can be authorized to view and edit notes attached to worksheets.\n\nGroups can authorized to use menu items.\n\nGroups are visible in all components. Note that the users in a group can belong to different components.\n\nTo create or modify a group\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify Group. Or click the Create/Modify User Group button.\n\nThe Create/Modify Group dialog box appears.\n\nNext:\n\nTo create a new group, double-click the New Group button.\n\nTo modify a group, click the button of that group then click OK. Or double-click the icon of the group whose details you want to modify.\n\nThe system prompts you for information about the group.\n\nSpecify group details as follows:\n\nUnder Enter Group Details, type a name and optional description in the appropriate boxes. Each group name must be unique within your Demantra implementation.\n\nIf users of this group should be able to see either other in the Who's Online pane in Collaborator Workbench, make sure the Collaboration Group check box is checked. To access the Workflow Manager, a User Group must be assigned to the workflow.group parameter (in the Business Modeler). For details, refer to Providing Access to the Workflow Editor.\n\nThe users will also be able to send tasks to each other.\n\nIf you clear this check box, users of the group will not see one another.\n\nCheck or clear the Enable Cascade Filters Toggle check box.\n\nClick this option to enable users in the group to toggle between cascade and non-cascade filter modes. If not selected, the user will have cascade filtering only.\n\nIn cascade mode, users see only members that have combinations with the previously selected members. Members that do not have combinations will not be available in the list. It is generally easier to work with filters in cascade mode.\n\nIn non-cascade mode, users see all the members of the selected level regardless of the previously selected members from other levels.\n\nNote: If Cascade Filters are enabled, you can define whether they should initially be toggled on or toggled off. To do this you need to set the value for the column CASCADE_FILTERS_DEF_VAL in the table GROUP_ATTRIBUTES_POPULATION. A value of 1 means that Cascade Filters are initially toggled on. A value of 0 or null means they are initially toggled off. The default is 1. You set this value using a database utility such as Oracle SQL Developer. If Cascade Filters are not enabled then this setting has no effect.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe New Group - Select Group Users dialog box appears. This dialog box allows you to select existing users who will belong to the new group.\n\nSpecify the users in a group, as follows:\n\nMove all users that should be in this group into the Selected Users list. To do so, either double-click each user name or drag and drop it.\n\nNote: You can also select and move multiple users with the standard Ctrl+click or Shift+click actions.\n\nRemove any unwanted users from the Selected Users list.\n\nClick Next.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nSee Also\n\n“Data Security”\n\n“Deleting a Group”\n\nDeleting a Group\n\nTo delete a group\n\nLog on to the Business Modeler as described in “Logging onto the Business Modeler.”\n\nClick Security > Create/Modify Group. Or click the Create/Modify Group button.\n\nThe Create/Modify Group dialog box appears.\n\nClick the button of the group that you want to delete.\n\nA box appears, inquiring if you are sure you want to delete the selected group.\n\nClick Delete.\n\nSee also\n\n“Data Security”\n\n“Creating or Modifying a User Group”\n\nLogging Out Users\n\nDemantra provides a tool that you can use to log out users whose sessions have hung due to network or other problems. This applies only to the users of the Web-based products.\n\nNote: You must have a permission level of \"System Manager\" to use this tool.\n\nTo log a user out of Demantra\n\nBrowse to the following case-sensitive URL:\n\nhttp://server name/virtual directory/portal/userManagement.jsp\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://frodo/demantra/portal/userManagement.jsp\n\nA login page appears.\n\nType your username and password and then click Log on.\n\nDemantra displays the following screen:\n\nClick Logout in the row corresponding to the user you want to log out.\n\nChanging Your Password\n\nYou can log into the Business Modeler and change your own password. If your permission level is lower than System Manager, your password is the only information you can access.\n\nNote: You can also change your password by using the Administration link in Collaborator Workbench.\n\nTo change your password\n\nLog into the Business Modeler. If you do not have access to this tool, contact your Oracle Demantra system administrator.\n\nClick Security > Change Password. Or click the Change Password button.\n\nThe Business Modeler displays the Change Password screen:\n\nType your current password in the Old Password field.\n\nType your new password in the New and Confirm New fields.\n\nClick OK.\n\nPassword Policy\n\nYou can set up Demantra to enforce password policies and ensure that passwords are well-formed and are changed frequently. By default, Demantra password policies are enforced. An administrator can change this by modifying the system parameter PasswordRulesEnforcedGlobal. For details about this parameter, see Non-Engine Parameters.\n\nOnce enabled, the password polices are:\n\nPassword length must be 8 to 12 characters.\n\nAt least one character must be in UPPER CASE.\n\nAt least one digit or special character must be used in the password.\n\nAt least one digit or special character must be used in the password.\n\nPassword should NOT be a Security Dictionary Word (please contact your administrator for details).\n\nPassword should NOT be the same as User name.\n\nPassword should NOT be the same as current password.\n\nIf a user attempts to create a new password that does not follow these policies, a message notifies the user of the password policies.\n\nIf the user attempts to login and fails, a message similar to the following appears:\n\nThe number of tries allowed by the password policy is determined by the system parameter “AccountLockoutThreshold”. (see System Parameters).\n\nIf the user is locked out because of too many failed attempts, the following message appears:\n\nAn administrator can unlock the user's account by logging into Business Modeler, navigating to Security > Create/Modify User, and then deselect the Locked check box. If the component owner is locked out, they can log into the Business Modeler and unlock themselves.\n\nIf an administrator explicitly locks a user's account, a different message appears, saying that the account is locked and to please contact your system administrator.\n\nNote that this locking applies to Collaborator Workbench, Workflow Manager, Administrator Login, Demand Planner Web, Dynamic Open Link (DOL) , Demantra Anywhere.Locking does not apply to the Business Modeler, Member Management, or Chaining Management.\n\nWhen a user's password expiration date is within 10 days, a message displays prompting the user to change his password.\n\nFor more information see these system parameters:\n\nPasswordHistoryCount\n\nPasswordRulesEnforcedGlobal\n\nAccountLockoutThreshold\n\nAccountLockoutDuration\n\nPasswordResetTime\n\nMutual Authentication\n\nThe following system parameter can be used for configuring mutual authentication (taken from the System Parameters table in the Demantra Implementation Guide).\n\nParameter Location Default Details client.ssl.authentication System Paramete rs > Applicati on Server > DP Web false This parameter controls two-way (mutual) SSL authentication.\n\nLogging Messages of the Application Server\n\nBy default, the Application Server writes logs into the directory Demantra_root/Collaborator/virtual_directory/portal/logs. These logs record activity of the server and clients.\n\nTo change the behavior of this logging, edit the file Demantra_root/Collaborator/virtual_directory/portal/conf/logconf.lcf. In this file, you can specify items such as the following:\n\nName and location of the log file\n\nMaximum size of the log file\n\nNumber of log files to keep\n\nInformation on user login/logout events\n\nFor details, see the comments in Demantra_root/Collaborator/virtual_directory/portal/conf/logconf.lcf.\n\nTip: If the default language uses a non-ASCII character set (such as Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Russian) then the text editor for viewing server log files must support the UTF-8 character set. Otherwise the text may not display correctly.\n\ncollaborator.login.user\n\nThis parameter is set in the logconf.lcf file. Users can turn on this log category and the following information will print out to the collaborator.log file:\n\ndate/time : User “username” logged in, “number” users online.\"\n\ndate/time : User “username” has been brutally logged out, “number” users online.\n\ndate/time : User “username” logged out, “number” users online.\n\nViewing the Workflow Process Log\n\nThe workflow process log displays information on all the workflow instances that have run or that are running.\n\nTo view the process log\n\nOn the bottom of the Workflow Management page, click Process Log.\n\nThe Process Log page appears.\n\nTo filter process log entries\n\nSelect the required filter from the View Processes drop-down menu.\n\nClick View.\n\nThe filtered processes are shown.\n\nSee also:\n\n“Viewing Workflow Status”\n\nSpecifying Content Pane Security\n\nYou can control access to the different Collaborator Workbench panes ( My Tasks, My Worksheets, and Who's Online).\n\nTo specify access to Collaborator Workbench panes\n\nLog into the Collaborator Workbench Administrator. See \"Logging onto the Collaborator Workbench Administrator\".\n\nThe Administration page appears.\n\nClick Define Content Security.\n\nThe system displays a table with one row for each user. Here you specify which panes to make available to each user.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nCheck the check box for a pane to grant user access to the user.\n\nClear the check box for a pane to deny access to the user.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nSee also\n\n\"Configuring the Pane Configuration\"\n\nChecking the Log Files and Tables\n\nTo check the installation logs:\n\nCheck the basic installer log file: C:\\tmp\\Demantra-install.log.\n\nCheck the database log files written by the Installer. Depending on the installation, the Installer writes some or all of the following log files into Demantra_root\\Demand Planner\\Database Objects\\database_type_name:\n\nimport.log (Information on the import process of the dump file)\n\nFor Oracle: run_build_procedures.LST (Information on the loading of the procedures into the new user.) and other *.LST files.\n\nCheck the db_exception_log table.\n\nIf you upgraded the database user, also check the following:"
