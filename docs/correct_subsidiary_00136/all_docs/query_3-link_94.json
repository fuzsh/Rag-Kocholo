CDP\n\n6 Demantra Admin Utilities\n\nOracle In Memory Consumption Driven Planning/CDP Technical Architecture Demantra Admin Utilities\n\n7 Oracle Demantra Technical Architecture\n\nNon Exa Demantra Admin Utilities\n\n8 3 Tier Architecture – Non Exa\n\nDatabase, Application server, and Forecasting Engine resides on separate physical servers Recommended option for customers with Mid – Large data volume and concurrent users Majority of the customers deployed Oracle Demantra in 3 tier architecture\n\n9 2 Tier Architecture – Non Exa\n\nApplication server and Forecasting Engine shares the same physical server. Refer system requirement document for supported OS platform for Forecasting Engine Deployment Database will reside on a separate dedicated server Suits for customers with smaller data volume ( say <= 25k Item Location Combinations) and low no of concurrent users ( <= 10)\n\n10 Oracle Demantra Product Components\n\nClient/s One or more client machines each running a browser to access Oracle Demantra Application server Includes web server (i.e. Apache…etc) and J2EE application server (i.e. Oracle Web logic, OAS,….etc) Demantra web application platform runs within J2EE server Metadata definitions gets loaded into Application server memory from database during startup No fact data (Sales History/Forecast) gets stored in Application server Application server clustering is not supported Database server All fact data & metadata object definitions are stored in the Demantra database schema In standard EBS VCP Integrated environment, Demantra should share database with other VCP Modules (i.e. ASCP, IO, GOP….etc) Oracle Demantra is certified to work on Oracle RAC cluster\n\n11 Oracle Demantra Product Components Cont’d\n\nEngine Servers One or more servers used for running analytical forecasting engine processes in both batch and adhoc simulation mode Demantra Forecasting Engine is a 32 bit application Reads the demand stream data from Database and generates statistical forecast and writes it back to the database Admin Utilities Business Modeler Consultant/Admin Tool Thick Client Used for configuring metadata object definitions to be used in the application Can be accessed from PC’s or Servers (Supported only on Windows platform) Engine Administrator Used for configuring engine settings & to enable loggings for troubleshooting Can be accessed from PC’s or Servers (Refer Oracle Demantra System Requirement document for supported platforms)\n\n12 Oracle Demantra Supported Stacks\n\nRefer “Oracle Demantra System Requirements” guide of relevant version to get information on latest supported stacks System requirement document for all released versions is available under Oracle Demantra documentation library (DOC ID: ) in My Oracle Support website\n\n13 VCP Suite Implementation Requirements\n\nTo leverage standard integration between Demantra & VCP modules (ASCP, IO, GOP, APCC….etc), both Oracle Demantra and other VCP modules should be deployed on the same Database instance Above requirement is applicable for both EBS and Legacy source environment\n\n14 Sizing Tool Overview Sizing tool is intended to enable the user to come up with a rough estimate of hardware requirements for Oracle Demantra Product and applications This includes Recommendation on range of Physical memory needed. Recommendation on range of No. of CPU Cores needed Disk Space, No of Disks and Disk controllers needed for SAN storage system These are estimates generated to best of our abilities and are provided to help the customer to anticipate the sizing needs of the application so that they can plan better. Oracle is not responsible for the inaccuracies caused by data or by the tool to come up with the estimates Sizing and the resulting architecture design should be reviewed as the project matures. Early in the project, requirements and estimates are more uncertain than they will be in later lifecycle phases, thus the hardware estimates are presented as ranges. There are many variables that can affect performance in the system used to deploy Demantra. Throughout the project lifecycle iterations of testing are required to confirm the performance suggested by the inputs, system components and user loads. Testing should use data that is a close approximation of real production data as possible. In any procurement decision, consider the range values as a proxy for system capacity. If the lower end of the range is chosen as the deployment point, make sure the system has the capacity/capability to be expanded.\n\n15 Explanation of Sizing Inputs\n\n16 Solution Implementing\n\nLOV Input Possible selections are as follows DM – Demand Management CDP – Exa – Consumption Driven Planning/Oracle In Memory Demand Planning DM + Std S&OP – Demand Management and Standard S&OP DM + AFDM – Demand Management and AFDM (Promotion Modeling/Nodal Tuning) DM + AFDM + Std S&OP -

Target Spares Batch Calculation Run Time (hrs) Applicable only for SPF implementation Expected run time in hrs to derive spare parts forecast from Total Base Install & Failure Rate Target Spares Forecasting Engine Run Time (hrs) Expected run time in hrs to generate statistical forecast for spare parts\n\n37 Run Time Inputs Cont’d Target Store Consumption Engine Run Time (hrs)\n\nApplicable only for “CDP – Exa” implementation Defaults to 1 hr Expected run time in hrs for running Consumption Demand Stream Forecasting Engine at Retail Store level Shipment Forecast/Sell in Forecast Calculation Engine Run Time (hrs) Expected run time in hrs for running Derived Shipment Forecast/Sell in Forecast Calculation BLE Engine at DC/Retail Store\n\n38 Run Time Inputs Cont’d…\n\nTarget Store Replenishment Order Calculation Run Time (hrs) Applicable only for “CDP – Exa” implementation Expected run time in hrs for running Suggested Store Replenishment Order calculation BLE Engine Total Available time for end to end Demantra Processes (hrs) Total time available for running all processes (Data Collection & Load, Engine Run, Maintenance, Custom Processes…etc) required for Oracle Demantra Must exceed sum of target run times entered for Forecasting engine, CTO Batch and SPF Engine & Batch. Defaults to 24 hrs if it’s not entered\n\n39 Other Hardware Requirements – Non Exa\n\nVM Support VMware VM is not supported. Refer Oracle Support Note for Oracle's policy on VMware VM support Oracle VM Support - From Demantra 7.3 & above Respects Oracle Database certification Respects J2EE software certification Engine Server – Only Windows Platform Database Sizing Database server sizing assumes SPARC T4-2 processors at 2.85GHz Oracle Database Enterprise Edition is strongly recommended 64 bit server is highly recommended for Application and Database server 64 bit J2EE software (Web Logic, OAS…etc) is always recommended for all solutions with an exception of TPO For TPO implementation, refer Oracle Demantra system requirement document for supported 64 bit OS platform for Application Server\n\n40 Other Hardware Requirement – Non Exa Cont’d\n\nEngine server sizing Assumes Intel Xeon E5540 CPU cores Required CPU Clock speed of engine servers ranges from 2.5 – 3 GHz Engine Servers can be either 32 or 64 bit For supported Windows Platform 32 bit Oracle client is required For supported Non Windows Platform 32 bit J2EE Software (Web Logic, OAS…etc) is required for Engine application deployment CPU Hyper threading should be disabled on Engine servers for better performance\n\n41 Other Hardware Requirement – Non Exa Cont’d\n\nRefer Oracle support note (Doc ID: ) in regards to recommended Database Best Practices for Oracle Demantra application All network equipment used to interconnect between the Demantra servers (DB, Application server, Engine server) must support at least 1Gbps. This includes network interface cards, switches and cabling. Also make sure that the storage interconnect with the DB server be fast enough and robust, so as not to be a bottleneck for data throughput\n\n42 Sizing Request Process\n\nDemantra Web Sizer - Self Service Tool Estimates provided are only for Production environment Web Sizer for all VCP modules are available at the knowledge in Oracle Partner Network (OPN) under VCP section Oracle registered partners can also access the sizer with their SSO credentials OPN VCP Sizer URL: Submit sizing request via web sizer tool to get hardware estimates Hardware sizing estimates will be sent to the id provided in the web sizer"
