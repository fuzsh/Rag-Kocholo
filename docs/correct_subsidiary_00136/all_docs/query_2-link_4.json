Predictive Planning is advanced statistical forecasting made easy and tightly integrated into EPBCS. It includes methods such as linear regression, exponential smoothing, and seasonality. For each forecast, it tests many different techniques and creates a forecast using the best one. You might use the results as your primary forecast, you might use them as your forecast seed, or you might use them to compare to and validate human-made forecasts. You don’t need a PhD in statistics. In fact, it’s a good way to learn more about statistical forecasting techniques (aka data science). So how exactly does it work, and how can you use it to improve your forecasts? This presentation provides a quick overview of the statistical techniques and error measures.
