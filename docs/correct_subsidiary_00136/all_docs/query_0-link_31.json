Next Steps Charter a Business Systems Project Identify Business Sponsor Set Measurable Objectives Identify Implementation Partner\n\n28. CHALLENGES Years of customizations had resulted in a complex platform, but one that was familiar and comfortable for its resident users. Manugistics ,while out of date and in danger of imminent failure, was getting the job done for the Planners The biggest challenges associated with this project were user-focused. Convincing the Planners that replacement software was vital to the success of the company was the first hurdle, and introducing the selected solutions would require user preparation TI Confidential\n\n29. Project – Wish List Provide the ability to load and archive a Salesman, Consensus, and Statistical forecast Automated Copy History – update actual sales to particular SKU’s Ability to allocate (dis-aggregation) the statistical forecast at a high level to a lower level using historical data, proportions, and other appropriate methods Ability to generate and override multiple forecasts Provides extensive report writing and graphing capabilities. Reduction in batch processes and total run times\n\n30. Agenda Introduction Business Environment Legacy System Background Business Case Implementation Experience Case Study Conclusions\n\n31. Project Steps\n\n32. Upgrade Steps\n\n33. Evaluate Identify and Prioritize Project Drivers and Objectives\n\n34. Project Scope (ASCP) Upgrade ASCP hardware environment to enable stable support for a combined ASCP and Demantra environment. The upgrade activity will bring the environment to the current (Solaris) Operating System and (Oracle ASCP) patch level The Project end-state will be a combined Oracle ASCP/Oracle Demantra server configuration, enabling more native integration across modules and sharing Data Collection processes between the ASCP/Demantra and Oracle EBS environments\n\n35. Project Scope (Demantra): Phase I and II Phase I: Replace Manugistics with Demantra as the global forecasting tool for ET Sales forecasting Enable a more integrated Supply Chain Planning environment, reduce manual processes, increase forecast accuracy Enable a Phase 2 project to implement Demantra Real Time Sales & Operations Planning (RTS&OP) Phase II: Development processes, reports and the enabling of the Demantra RTS&OP module to create a robust real time Sales & Operations Planning process (RTS&OP): Units and Dollars in one place – real time and interactive Support multiple Forecasts, Forecast Revisions & historical Forecast Deltas In short, the ability to see how we have done in the past (accuracy by units and dollars) and to factor current forecasts by historical patterns – in real time\n\n36. Evaluate Demantra is a completely independent product from Oracle ERP Oracle Demantra Platform of 6 Solutions Demand Management Advanced Forecasting and Demand Modeling Real Time Sales and Operational Planning Predictive Trade Planning Trade Promotion Optimization Deductions and Settlement Management\n\n37.
