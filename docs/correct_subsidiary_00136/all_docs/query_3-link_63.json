My friends Sunil and Manoj stumbled upon this hidden gem in Panvel during one of their routine adventure bike rides. Sunil had thoughtfully preordered a delectable feast to complement our drinks, featuring the Bombil fry, a Maharashtra delicacy crafted from the common Bombay Duck. Intriguingly, our diverse group included members from Mumbai and other states, making it the first encounter with Bombay Duck for some. As we eagerly indulged in the fish fingers placed before us, our lighthearted banter transformed into a spirited debate. I asserted that this couldn’t be Bombay duck but Basa, a type of catfish. Sunil, adamant that he had ordered Bombay Duck fry, insisted it couldn’t be Basa. James and Biju confidently declared it was indeed Bombay Duck, drawing comparisons with their previous culinary experiences. Vikram initially sided with Basa but succumbed to the majority opinion favoring Bombay Duck. Surprisingly, Manoj, a Mumbai native stayed silent throughout. The attentive waiter, overhearing our debate, interjected, unequivocally stating that the dish was Bombay Duck, effectively ending our discussion. Despite this resolution, I stubbornly stuck to my belief that it was Basa. Others playfully teased me, and though the evening progressed merrily, the lingering debate left a sour taste of self-doubt in my heart. As the night drew to a close, the waiter presented the bill, and with it, entered the chef. Apologetically, he informed Sunil that he had served Basa Fish Fingers due to a shortage of Bombay Duck! Isn’t this scenario reminiscent of many discussions among diverse groups? Reflecting on this amusing episode, the lesson becomes clear: In the tapestry of diverse opinions and perspectives, it is crucial to maintain an open mind. The evening’s humorous twist underscores the importance of humility and adaptability in the face of new information. The dynamics of our group mirrored the broader lessons of life. Some contribute without much knowledge, others remain silent despite knowing everything, and those who sway with the majority. Yet, if you firmly believe in your stance, grounded in sound reasons and information, stick to it. Sooner or later, you might find yourself vindicated.\n\nHi All, *GE Power* are hiring for the below mentioned roles: 1) Oracle Project Accounting Functional Location - Bangalore Exp- 10 to 15 yrs of experience Mandatory Skills- Project Accounting Functional, Minimum 4-5 years of Implementation experience, Good working knowledge on AR/AP/GL, Order Management Desired Skills: Hands on experience on coding, Data Conversion and Testing Cycles. 2) Oracle VCP Demantra Techno-Functional Location- Bangalore Exp- 5 to 10 yrs of experience Mandatory Skills- More in to Coding Role.
