While energy-saving measures used to be simply related to a company's own Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) and sustainability strategy to reduce its carbon footprint, they are now part of essential processes that could secure long-term cost savings and eco-optimize a company’s future.But what can be done along the supply chain to keep control over rising energy costs? How can firms reduce their carbon footprint to both cut emissions and minimize consumption? Yumiko Moehlmann, Head of Quality & HSE at DSJ Global, asked. Reducing the carbon footprint as a business When asked, \"What is your company doing to become more sustainable and save energy?\" 51% of participants responded with a clear \"reduce carbon footprint.\" 20% of companies are sourcing more sustainable raw materials for their production while 16% are switching to energy-saving solutions for lighting. 12% also said they are raising awareness among their employees through education and training. To gain further insights, Yumiko Moehlmann personally surveyed her network in the Quality and HSE area on the topic, talking to four companies along the supply chain to provide insights into how their companies are defying rising energy prices - or not. Energy targets firmly anchored in corporate cultureCOO at a global player in the e-mobility sectorThe e-mobility sector is considered a pioneer in sustainability. A global player and client of DSJ Global also pursues this mission at the level of corporate culture. They have clearly defined environmental and energy goals and woven them into their corporate strategy. \"We raise awareness on the topic of energy,\" explains the COO. By visualizing the costs and energy consumption of equipment and production, their company create awareness among employees, who can adjust and optimize their actions and processes accordingly. There are also detailed shutdown lists to ensure that sensitive machinery is operated correctly and that all employees are taught the right procedure. This saves resources and protects the equipment. Furthermore, efforts to switch to the most modern and energy-saving machines support the company’s current measures. Although these machines have to meet certain requirements, they are much more efficient and cost-effective to operate.For example, the global player has already converted to a decentralized compressed air network with small local systems that run when they are needed. Previously, they were in continuous operation even though it wasn't necessary. ​In-house gardening as a delicious solution​Director Global EHS at a tier 1 automotive supplier​One easy-to-implement option for indirectly reducing one's own emissions is to switch to so-called green electricity, i.e. electricity from renewable sources. Electricity from solar, wind or even biogas produces less CO2 during production and is therefore considered better for the environment. Yet upon closer inspection, these promising effects might be lower in reality, according to the Director for Global EHS at a tier 1 automotive supplier. ​This long-time customer of DSJ Global has already converted many areas to green energy. However, the Director was skeptical– he saw it as clear \"greenwashing.\" ​Greenwashing refers to the attempt by organizations to achieve a \"green image\" through communication, marketing and individual measures without having systematically anchored corresponding measures in the operational business. ​\"Electricity is ultimately the same for everyone,\" says the Director. The percentage from renewable sources doesn't change the fact of how much energy is consumed, he said. Consequently, a widely advertised switch to green electricity is not effective, since ESG must be primarily about reducing the company's own emissions. ​For the Director, however, it would be more effective to switch all light sources in operation to resource-saving LEDs. ​Unfortunately, the biggest problem cannot be solved so easily: According to lifecycle analyses that the automotive supplier initiated for each product, their supply chain leaves the largest carbon footprint. ​They found that commuting had a particularly heavy impact as well. After two years of pandemic home office regulations, more and more companies are looking to return to the office to strengthen collaboration within departments and teams. ​As the Director explains, his company is currently looking for a solution to make this more sustainable. Some employees have no other choice than their car, but for others, covering the cost for public transportation or even leasing a bike is an option. In addition, smaller on-site office spaces could help reduce emissions if a location has a larger catchment area with longer commutes.​In other areas, there's room for more creativity: some locations of the automotive supplier, the director said, have established in-house gardens to more sustainably source the fresh fruits and vegetables provided to employees each day. \"In the past, fruits and vegetables were delivered daily,\" the Director explains. \"Inhouse gardening stops the supply chain and their vans, saving tons of CO2, and the company cafeterias use the homegrown fruits and vegetables instead.\"​The initiative has been so well received that entire teams are now getting personally involved. In the \"Lunch & Learn\" format, employees educate themselves via open lectures on a variety of topics while enjoying a company-funded lunch.​Global Sustainability Manager defies initial pessimism​Head of Health, Safety, Environment, Sustainability, Quality, at a global player in the chemical industry​There is less optimism at a company in the CHEMPARK network. The head of HSSEQ sees very little potential – apart from putting a stop to production – for saving energy.​Reducing commuting and the associated emissions as well as the energy required through more flexible home office solutions is only possible to a limited extent in the case of this company, he says. ​But the company does not want to give up. It has recently hired a Global Sustainability Manager and hopes for sustainable change, even if any structures have to develop before they take effect and lead to savings. ​Photovoltaics as an alternative to costly investments​Senior Manager Mineralization at a building materials manufacturer​The possibility of saving energy in cement production is a question that also occupies the senior manager for mineralization of a building materials manufacturer. In fact, the only way to do this, the senior manager says, is to stop production or shut it down – neither of which are economically viable options, of course.​Since the manufacturer buys its electricity on the stock exchange, it’s possible to obtain it more cheaply, yet that depends on the production processes. They need to be optimized to allow for a more cost-effective tariff. ​Another option is to invest in more energy-efficient plants. \"Some of our equipment is 60 or 70 years old,\" the senior manager says. \"New machines are inevitably more energy efficient, but realistically we can't replace all the machines because the cost would be far too high.\"​How his company nevertheless tries to counteract the enormous costs and has been reducing the overall need for externally produced energy for years. Their method of choice: photovoltaic systems on the factory roofs. This is already proving effective: The resulting savings could light up an entire small town. ​Heat recovery as the vision of the future​Senior EHS Manager at a global semiconductor company​Since they are renting in their current location, this global semiconductor company has little room to maneuver. ​\"We're turning down the heat, relying on home offices and reduced hours,\" explains DSJ Global's client. Long-term goals are few and far between since, as a tenant, they can't seek extensive renovations. ​Still, there are innovative ideas: Since the production machines give off a lot of heat, the Senior EHS Manager and his team are working on using this to generate electricity via heat recovery.​Funding for production conversion in sight​As difficult as cost savings and emissions reductions are: A competitive, climate-friendly industry is essential for sustainable growth and the fight against climate change. ​At the beginning of December 2022, Germany’s Economics Minister Robert Habeck announced climate protection agreements that he would conclude with industry in 2023 to stimulate necessary investments in the use of hydrogen. This is the best alternative to fossil energy sources, especially in the steel and chemical industries. Under the climate protection agreements, companies receive both subsidies and monetary support if they convert to green production. ​When and to what extent these funds will come remains to be seen. Until then, it's up to innovative ideas like indoor gardens and company-owned photovoltaic systems to make the value chain more sustainable. ​Conclusion​Opinions on how to save energy along the value chain vary widely, Yumiko Moehlmann confirms. \"Many companies don't want to or can't change anything, or position themselves better. Others invest a lot in it.\" ​She sees the promised climate agreements as a positive sign. After all, as some of the examples cited show, companies especially need help with the enormous costs of switching to greener production. ​Yumiko and her team of experts at DSJ Global are closely following how the energy crisis is affecting HSE and sustainability strategies and how different companies are adapting. Whether the companies that are not currently planning any changes will aim for more sustainable production in the future remains cause for speculation.​Your partner for sustainable niche professionals​In addition to HSE talents, our global network continues to grow in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability.​Reach out to our talent experts today, to discuss us supporting you with a vacancy, or as a professional keen to make their next career move. ​​Submit a vacancy​Send CV​Contact​Yumiko Moehlmann​Head of Quality & HSE, DSJ Global​yumiko.moehlmann@dsjglobal.com​+49 30 726211418\n\nRead More\n\nsupply-chain\n\nAddressing the UK Energy Crisis: Embracing Sustainability\n\nThe United Kingdom is currently facing an energy crisis, a situation that has far-reaching implications for various sectors, including supply chains. The depletion of fossil fuel reserves, closure of aging power plants, and overreliance on imported natural gas have strained the nation's energy infrastructure. Factors like extreme weather events and limited investment in new energy infrastructure further exacerbates the situation, leading to potential disruptions in energy supply.In this blog, we will explore the UK energy crisis and the need for sustainability, discuss job opportunities in sustainability, and delve into the impact this crisis is having on supply chains.The Need for SustainabilityTo address the UK energy crisis, sustainability must be at the forefront of the nation's energy strategy. Here's why sustainability is crucial:Climate Change Mitigation: The transition to renewable energy sources is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. By embracing sustainable alternatives like wind, solar, and hydropower, the UK can significantly decrease its carbon footprint and align with global climate goals.Energy Security: Diversifying the energy mix with renewable sources enhances energy security.

Talent experts at DSJ Global advise\n\nThe adoption of flexible working has increased over the last few years as technological advancements make it easier to work from anywhere at any time. This has left many companies facing the question of whether to embrace flexible working on a permanent basis. Can the future be flexible in the supply chain industry, and do companies need to offer it to attract and retain the best talent? We spoke to some of the talent experts at DSJ Global to find out how industry leaders are balancing the growing need to remain competitive in the hiring landscape with their business requirements and objectives.The supply chain industry has traditionally been reliant on on-site work, so flexible working in the supply chain industry presents its own unique set of challenges and opportunities. Matt Wood, Executive Director Europe at DSJ Global confirms: “We have to remember that the nature of the roles we recruit in supply chain sometimes means that people must be in the office. You can’t run a production site from your home office; you need to be on-site. The same goes for roles working in quality control, manufacturing processes and health & safety.”How many supply chain companies offer flexible working?As part of DSJ Global’s report, ‘The Impact of Flexible Working’, we surveyed top business leaders in the supply chain industry to find out how their company has been impacted by the rise of flexible working. 63% of clients said they currently offer flexible working, 20% offer fully remote roles, and the remaining 17% do not offer any flexible working options. We asked Emily Cook, Senior Vice President – Head of Procurement Search at DSJ Global, if the results were in line with her experiences finding top talent for leading supply chain firms: “This isn’t surprising - more companies are decreasing fully remote positions, and we are also seeing more companies offering flexibility on a case-by-case situation. However, bear in mind that some candidates have declined offers based on flexibility not being offered formally in their contract, as they are worried the terms could change or be taken away at any minute.”Matt provides insights from a client perspective: “A key requirement when hiring for supply chain roles is the ability to build relationships and trust with your key stakeholders quickly. Most of our clients need candidates who can be in front of their stakeholders and accessible to them throughout these processes so even for positions that can be carried out fully remotely, such as procurement, I rarely see companies offering 100% remote positions.”Flexible working – the positivesOne of the biggest advantages of flexible working in the supply chain industry is increased productivity and loyalty. By allowing employees to work from home or alternative hours, companies can help their staff to achieve a better work-life balance and feel more in control of their lives, which in turn can lead to higher levels of motivation and engagement. Flexible working can also help companies to attract and retain top talent in today’s competitive job market, with many professionals looking for companies that offer flexible working arrangements.Out of the 17% of businesses DSJ Global surveyed that don’t offer any flexibility, 38% plan to introduce it for these reasons. Emily states: “Candidates are asking about flexibility as much as they ask about compensation; it is an increasing priority for them. Companies are losing out on new talent and their own existing talent due to not giving flexibility on working hours or working from home, so we are seeing more and more companies increase their flexibility offering.”Flexible working – the challengesOne of the biggest challenges of flexible working in the supply chain industry is maintaining effective communication and collaboration between team members. When employees are working remotely or outside of traditional hours, it can be difficult to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. This can lead to misunderstandings, missed deadlines, and other communication-related issues, all having an impact on company culture.DSJ Global’s survey found an equal split with 37% each experiencing a positive or negative impact on company culture due to flexible working, with the remaining 26% unchanged. Emily advises: “Having a team and company culture that is supportive, collaborative, and approachable is what people are often looking for when changing roles. Some managers believe this is better formed when the team is together on site, but companies need to adapt and learn new ways of maintaining a positive company culture while navigating flexibility for the team. This could come from structure or innovative methods of team collaboration.”Can flexible working improve hiring and retention challenges?The biggest hiring challenge according to DSJ Global’s clients is a shortage of qualified candidates (37%), followed by increasing competition for top talent (20%). 10% find it is a struggle to retain talent. Emily offers her experience with how businesses can improve their hiring and retention based on candidate attitudes towards flexible working: “The current market is very candidate driven. During COVID, professionals were worried about changing roles while there was instability in the market, but in 2021-22 we saw an influx of candidates feeling more secure in taking the risk. In the last 6-12 months, with talks of the recession, the risk has gone back up for candidates and so they are less are likely to move. “However, there is a shortage of qualified candidates on the market and a lot of the candidates we are supporting are also in two or three other processes, so companies must be competitive with speed of their interview process, salaries and additional benefits. We are also seeing more counteroffers to compete with retaining talent, including more flexible hours and increasing responsibility. It’s due to this competition that salaries are increasing, which is why more companies are struggling to retain talent.”Final considerations for businesses considering flexible workingRemote and hybrid options play a central role in both hiring decisions and company culture. The number of days people are expected to be in the office affects the success of a company's hiring strategy and helps retain existing talent, as 67% of survey respondents agree. However, for 16% of supply chain leaders, it comes at the expense of productivity, and in 37% of cases it has a negative impact on office culture. We asked Emily for her key takeaways for clients asking whether to offer flexible working:“I would advise that if supply chain businesses want to attract and retain the best talent, they need to offer some sort of flexibility and at-home working, but they need a clear structure to ensure it doesn’t affect the company culture.”Matt offers another word of warning for European organisations offering remote working on a global scale: “It’s clear that hybrid and flexible working is the norm now but at management and senior management level roles, often responsible for global teams and multiple sites, there has been a requirement to manage a complicated schedule around global colleagues and stakeholders for a long time. Don’t under-estimate the impact that “cross-border” remote working has on this dynamic – it isn’t as simple as being employed by a UK company in a 100% remote role and doing so from the beach in Spain – there are tax implications as well as eligibilities when working in other locations.”Learn moreThe future of flexible working in the supply chain industry is explored further in DSJ Global’s report, ‘The Impact of Flexible Working’, where we surveyed business leaders to provide you with insights on how productivity and company culture has been impacted by the increasing prevalence of flexible working, the benefits and challenges it has brought to business leaders, and how companies plan to use flexible working to attract and retain top talent.Click here to download ‘The Impact of Flexible Working’ report.If you would like to talk to us about your current talent needs, fill in our form and one of our consultants will call you back. ​\n\nRead More\n\nsupply-chain\n\nHow to Avoid Bias in Job Descriptions\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that companies with diverse workforces perform better on every possible metric, with diversity positively impacting every level of a business, from the cleaning staff to the board of directors. Bringing in as many perspectives, working styles and experience as possible to a workplace leads to integration, success and growth to those businesses who dedicate effort into attracting a diverse talent pool. The first step to make when aiming to achieve a balanced workforce is to ensure job advertisements avoid signs of unconscious bias. This helps present you as a welcoming and forward-thinking employer. You will also discover that your job positions attract a rich wealth of resumes after eliminating bias in your job descriptions. Biased job descriptions can discourage capable and talented candidates from applying for a role they are perfect for, and problems can be found both within the language and content of your job descriptions. Thankfully, it is easy to avoid bias in job descriptions through simple edits and considerations. Follow these rules to attract a diverse and successful talent pool.What is Unconscious Bias?​Though the majority of us strive to encourage inclusiveness and diversity, unconscious bias incorporates the assumptions we make about groups based on gender, ethnicity, age and class due to the structures we live in. When writing job descriptions, this will most often come through in gendered or other biased language. Unconscious bias can discourage qualified candidates who feel like a job description is looking for a specific type of person, and are unintentionally excluded. ​Are Your Job Titles Inclusive?​Unconscious bias affects many aspects of language, through to job titles themselves. Many job titles are gendered, and successful efforts have been made to reframe traditional roles such as chairman (chairperson), fireman (firefighter) and councilman (council member).Even modern descriptors hold a bias. Have you ever seen a job from a hip company seeking a ‘rockstar’, a ‘guru’ or a ‘ninja’? These are fun titles which give candidates a vivid impression of a company's culture, but all of these terms still hold gendered connotations. A mother in her 40s with the qualifications and experience required may not want to apply for a role with ‘ninja’ in the title. These job titles can also give the (often false) impression of a company dominated by men or entrenched in a ‘lad’ culture where others are not welcome. ​Ensure your job titles are gender-neutral, avoid discouraging older applicants and are descriptive of what the job entails (e.g. ‘Magento Build Project Manager’).Use Gender-Neutral Pronouns​This is a fast and effective way of cleaning up your job descriptions, and a simple rule to follow when advertising new roles. Don’t include gender-specific pronouns in your job description. Stick to they/their and you when referring to the candidate. ‘S/he’ is also an acceptable replacement for gender-specific pronouns, This rule also applies to collective nouns. Phrases such as ‘guys’ can be easily replaced with ‘team’ or ‘folks’. Check For Biased Language​This is where judgement can be more complicated. When describing the ideal candidate for a role, job descriptions do lean towards using phrases which contain unconscious bias. For example, typically masculine traits include ‘assertive’ and ‘competitive’. While women have every ability to be assertive in the workplace, this can also be viewed as loyalty and supportiveness through a ‘feminine’ lens. This also works the other way. Roles which may be classically applied to by women may include words such as ‘bubbly’ or ‘nurturing’ to unconsciously encourage female applicants and discourage applications from men. Avoid Presenting A Toxic Work Culture​When presenting your work culture, language choices can give applicants the vision of a ‘bro’ culture of after-work beers, chats about matchday and, in worse case scenarios, sexual harassment. Phrases such as ‘work hard, play hard’ and ‘banter’ will not only put off the majority of female applicants but many men too. Consider the wide spectrum of lifestyles your potential applicants could follow and elements of your work culture which will appeal to many, not just a single generation or lifestyle.Consider Your Job Requirements​Alongside bias in language, the general content of your job applications are worth reviewing to make them more inclusive. This includes avoiding job descriptions which contain an exhaustive list of skills needed for the role. In general, men are usually much more confident in their suitability for the roles they apply for, even if they don’t have all of the required skills for the role. Meanwhile, women are much more cautious about applying for roles. The more in-depth and specific a job description is, the less likely a qualified or near-qualified woman will apply for it, even if she ticks more boxes than a male applicant. Avoid this by outlining only the absolutely essential requirements for the role (such as education levels, years of experience, skills qualifications) followed by general ‘desired’ or ‘nice to have’ requirements. This will lift barriers to entry which often stop those with low confidence or imposter syndrome to apply. Provide a smaller amount of boxes to ‘tick’ to attract a larger and higher quality range of candidates. ​The best approach is to create descriptions which use succinct and direct language. Make your descriptions easy to follow, read and digest. Use Online Tools To Eliminate Bias in Job DescriptionsLarger companies have now invested in software to help highlight and change job descriptions and other materials to remove signs of unconscious bias. Recruitment software OnGig uses a text analysis tool to help remove biased language.

We'll explore the strategies behind scheduling interviews and whether employers typically interview the best candidate first.Do Employers Interview Best Candidate First?There is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether employers interview the best candidate first. The reality is that different employers have different strategies when it comes the scheduling process. It’s important to remember only the top candidates will be interviewed and therefore there is something interesting about your experience that the hiring manager will be looking to touch upon within the interview.The Case for Interviewing FirstSome hiring managers may choose to interview the strongest candidates first. This can be advantageous for a number of reasons. By interviewing the top candidate early, employers can gauge other candidates' performances against the benchmark set by the best candidate. This can also help streamline the hiring process if the best candidate impresses the interviewer and is a clear fit for the position.The Case for Interviewing LastOn the other hand, some employers may prefer to save the best for last. This can allow them to get a better understanding of the overall candidate pool and make it easier to identify the top candidate's strengths and weaknesses. By interviewing the best candidate last, employers can also ensure they have a lasting impression of the strongest contender, which may be useful during the decision-making process.Other FactorsMany other factors can influence the order in which candidates are interviewed, such as scheduling conflicts, interviewer preferences, or internal processes. Therefore, it's important not to read too much into the order of your interview.FAQsTo help you navigate the often complex world of interviews, we've answered some commonly asked questions.Does Being Interviewed First Mean Anything?Being interviewed first doesn't necessarily indicate your standing as a candidate. It's important to remember that there are many reasons why an employer may schedule interviews in a certain order, and it's often unrelated to the perceived quality of the candidates.Does the Order of Your Interview Matter?While the order of your interview may have some impact on how your performance is assessed, it's crucial to focus on what you can control: presenting your skills, experience, and personality in the best possible light. Ultimately, being well-prepared and confident will have a much greater impact on your chances of success than the order in which you are interviewed.How Long After an Interview Should You Hear Back?The time it takes to hear back after an interview can vary widely depending on the company, the position, and the number of candidates. Generally, you can expect to hear back within one to two weeks, but it may take longer in some cases. If you haven't heard back within this timeframe, it's acceptable to follow up with the employer or your talent consultant to inquire about the status of the hiring process.Why Choose Us?At DSJ Global, ourteam of experts are dedicated to providing you with the latest insights, tips, and advice to help you succeed in your job search with us.
