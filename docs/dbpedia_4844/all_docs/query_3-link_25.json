        "text": "Charters, Samuel, prod. 1975a. African Journey: A Search for the Roots of the Blues. Vanguard, SRV 73014/5.\n\n(Kelefa Ba)\n\n\"Kelefa Ba\" is one of the best known kora songs, the song all beginners learn first, and it is in this tradition of narratives about great leaders.\n\nKelefa Sanneh was from the old Mandingo capital of Kabu, in what is now Guinea, and the song, said to be written by his own jali, Madi Wuleng, tells of his death in a battle on the north bank of the Gambia River in the mid-1800's. The song, like all jali narratives, tells only scattered parts of the story, but the piece is so familiar to its village audiences that the excitement is in the way new ideas are introduced or parts of the action described. Kelefa had come to Niumi at the request of the local king, Demba Sonko, who realized that Kelefa had little chance of surviving a battle where the enemy had been preparing for him and tried to send him away on an errand. Kelefa returned too soon, went into battle, and was killed.\n\nThe kora is in the most common tuning, known as Tomoraba. It is very similar to the European scale but the tempering differs in the third and seventh, which are lower than the European, and the second and sixth which are slightly higher.\n\nJobarteh, Amadu Bansang. 1978. Master of the Kora. Eavadisc, EDM 101.\n\n(Kelefa Saane)\n\nThis is one of the best known and most frequently played of all kora pieces, and here it is an instrumental solo. Amadu bases his Kelefa on three themes, each one of which has a separate title and significance: Kelefa Saane, which is the first piece a kora student learns to play; Kuruntu Kelefa (introduced after four and a half minutes of this track), a processional piece, played when the musician walks behind his patron; and Jato (introduced after six minutes), which Amadu usually plays to accompany spoken recitation. All three are in Tomora Ba tuning.\n\nKelefa Saane is one of the most popular of the Mandinka heroes. He was a warrior prince (nyancho) from Badora in present-day Guinea-Bissau. When he was young he was sold into slavery for a misdemeanour and hence became known as 'the slave of the Maanes' (cf. the reference in A2), but later he was able to buy back his freedom. Like all true warior princes, he refused to live by anything but fighting, and soon set off for Niumi on the north bank of the Gambia river in order to assist King Demba Sonko in his war against Jokadu. After a number of adventures on the way, Kelefa eventually joined the King, for whom the war then took a favourable turn. Jokadu diviners, however, advised their people that Kelefa could only be killed by an albino with a silver bullet; Kelefa was then shot while lying under a tree.\n\nThis tune is said to have been composed by Koriyang Musa, who was personal musician to Kelefa. He was also the son of Jali Madi Wuleng, the 'inventor' of the kora. Kelefa Saane is supposedly the first piece ever composed specifically for the instrument.\n\nKnight, Roderic. 1984. \"The Style of Mandinka Music: A Study in Extracting Theory from Practice.\" In Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology, vol. 5, Studies in African Music, ed. J. H. Kwabena Nketia and Jacqueline Cogdell Djedje, 366. Los Angeles: Program in Ethnomusicology, Department of Music, University of California.\n\n(Kelefaba / Kuruntu Kelefa)\n\np. 8\n\nThe opening line of \"Kelefaba\", a song for Kelefa Sanneh, a mercenary who fought in the nineeeth-century battle between the kingdoms of Nyomi and Jokadu on the north bank of the Gambia River commemorates Kelefa's death: \"Kelefa the Avenger; Kelefa the Great of Bador has died; his spear is lying at Bariya.\" In \"Kuruntu Kelefa\" (Trailing Kelefa), a song that was sung for him while he was traveling, another death is commemorated: \"Saliya, where is Saliya? Friend of the jalolu, Saliya the merchant has lain down.\"\n\np. 10\n\nSome of the older kora players can still demonstrate how they used to play \"Kuruntu Kelefa\", imitating the howl of a hyena with a (rare) stepwise ascending passage on the kora, or the sound of gunfire by repeated heavy plucks of the lowest string on the instrument.\n\np. 12\n\nExample 1. A donkilo line from \"Kelefaba\"15\n\nExample 2. A donkilo line from \"Kuruntu Kelefa.\"\n\np. 16\n\nThe donkilo melodies for \"Kelefaba\" and \"Kuruntu Kelefa\" (Examples 1 and 2) illustrate the principal Tomoraba mode. In notation this tuning is indistinguishable from Hardino.\n\npp. 1920\n\nMelodically we may discern three types of kumbengo, based on their relationship to the donkilo.\n\nType II: Derivative. . . . A derivative kumbengo (and the derivation may work both ways) is related to the donkilo line but played very idiomatically on the instrument. This type of kumbengo is very common and takes many forms. At the very least, playing idiomatically involves two partsthe melody, and a bass line. The melody may be only a fragment of the donkilo, as in the kumbengo for \"Kelefaba.\" The opening four notes of the donkolo are provided with a bass line and this short ostinato is then played six times (actually in three slightly varied pairs) as the full donkilo melody unfolds.\n\nExample 11. \"Kelefaba,\" kumbengo and donkilo, showing the relationship between the two.\n\np. 21\n\nThe method of adding a bass line to a fragment of donkilo to form an ostinato may be used for extended passages as well. A well-known passage that may be incorporated into severla differnt songs combines a long vocal melody with a rapid \"timbango and its answer\" figure. A transcription of it as performed near the end of \"Kuruntu kelefa\" on the Ocora disc mentioned earlier is shown in Ex. 13. It is called \"Kele Borila\" (\"War Coward\"). The words are as follows:\n\nThe one who runs from war can't say what happened there.\n\nWar will come, you should be alert.\n\nPlans will be made, you should be alert.\n\nLet's be quick, let's be quick.\n\nOh in our father's time we were quick.\n\nLook, the marabout (Muslim holy man) is falling upon us.\n\nExample 13. \"Kele Borila,\" a vocal line played over a steady \"timbango and its answerer.\" (Heard on OCR 70, A-3, at 8'15\".)\n\npp. 25, 27\n\nThere are four standard konkondiro patterns.\n\nIV: \"Kelefa.\" The fourth konkondiro, dubbed the Kelefa konkondiro for its familiar association with the two songs for Kelefa Sanneh, displays the same general character as the Bakariba konkondiro, but spans 16 pulses instead of 12.\n\nx · · x · · x · · · x · x · · ·\n\npp. 5159\n\nIn this final example of sataro singing, we shall look at a 2.7-minute block of three uninterrupted sataro passages drawn from a nine-an-a-half-minute performance that includes both \"Kuruntu Kelefa\" and \"Kelefaba\" alternately. It is performed by Nyama Suso, a leading Gambian kora player.\n\n(See Knight [1984].) (Transcriptions, Analysis, and Discussion.)\n\nSuso, Jali Nyama. 1996. Gambie: L'art de la kora. Reissue of 1972 with other unreleased material. OCORA, C 580027.\n\n(Kuruntu Kelefa and Kelefabaa)\n\nThis pair of songs is dedicated o Kelefa Sanneh, legendary hero of the Mandinka people. Sanneh was a mercenary from Kaabu. In the nineteenth century, Demba Sonko, King of Niumi, on the north bank of the Gambia River, requested his aid in the battle with neighboring Jokadu. Sanneh came and fought gallantly for several days, but the people of Jokadu, using local medicines and trickery, succeeded in bringing him down. As he lay dying, he asked that he be buried under a mahogany tree, saying \"Regardless of where the mahogany grows, its bark is bitter\". To him it was symbolic of his resolve in battle. [See Gordon Innes, 1978, for a detailed literary study of this song.]\n\n\"Kuruntu Kelefa\" or \"Trailing Kelefa\" was played during Sannehs lifetime when he traveled from place to place. \"Kelefabaa\" (\"Kelefa the Great\") commemorates his death. Both were composed by Jali Madi Wuleng, Sanneh's personal jali. \"Kelefabaa\" is typically taught to beginning kora students. It is played in tomorabaa tuning.\n\nIn this performance Suso alternates between the two songs. Some of the lines he sings are excerpted below. They show the typical content of jaliyaa, providing glimpses of the events, people, and places associated with the person named in the song, plus a mixture of proverbs, religion, and philosophy.\n\nKuruntu Kelefa (after a brief introduction): \"Saliya Ndambungo, friend of the jalolu, benevolent merchant / Saliya has died / Ah, Kelefa ran his horse through the forest / He was the lion of the forest!\"\n\n· Kelefabaa (at 2'00): \"Kelefa the Avenger from Badora has lain down / His spear is at Bariya / His millet beer is gone / Hunger did not kill him, nor did threadbare clothes or woman-troubles / Ah, life! No matter how you believe in God, life will betray you one day / All things standing will one day lie down\".\n\n· Kuruntu Kelefa (at 3'55): \"There are many big talkers, but few who put words into action / Their times are gone / The best nyancholu (warriors) were from Balaba Tinkida, Balaba Kansuma, Bonjo Suma / Their names were Sanneh and Manneh, and their cousins the koringolu were Sonko and Sanyang / In praising the koringolu, we say, 'The water from Palm Tree Well is bitter, but the water-bearers are beautiful!' / Kelefa Sanneh, warrior of Kaabu / He died in the time of Kind Demba Sonko, the tax-collecting king / King Dembas times are gone, but the Sonkos live on // A soldier who flees from battle cant say what happened there / Ah, in Kelefa's time, the battle cry was 'Let's hurry to prepare or well be overrun by the Muslim vanguard!'\"\n\n· Kelefaba (at 845): \"I am following my fathers footsteps, doing jaliyaa for you / You too must follow your tradition and support the work of the jali! / Ah, see the horses dancing / Look, the war is over, the horses are dancing\".\n\n(Kelefaba / Kuruntu Kelefa)\n\np. 12\n\np. 118\n\nOne of the published recordings of the kora, if not the first, was made by Laura Boulton (1957-disc) in the early 1930s. The two kora pieces, Kelefaba and Amadou Masina, are still played the same way today.\n\np. 119\n\nStories of the origin of the kora center on Jali Madi Wuleng, who is widely believed to have first discovered (Md: bondi, \"caused it to come out\") the kora with the aid of a jinn during the era of the Kabu empire.51The question of when Jali Madi Wuleng lived is linked with that of when a warrior named Kelefa Sane lived and is a subject of controversy among jalis. Kelefa's brave exploits have been canonized in Kuruntu Kelefa (Following Kelefa), associated with his lifetime, and Kelefaba (Great Kelefa), associated with his death. These two pieces are believed to be the earliest ones composed on the kora, associated with its very origins, and 1 have often heard them referred to as the ABC of the kora. Simplified versions of the pieces are the first items that beginning kora players from The Gambia and Casamance learn, and many pieces derived from them have entered the kora repertory. No other kora pieces are believed to predate them, nor is the kora associated with the repertories of thirteenth-century Mali or eighteenth-century Segu or Kaarta.\n\nSome believe Jali Madi Wuleng was Kelefa Sane's jali and presumably the composer of Kuruntu Kelefa (e.g., Bamba Suso, Amadu Bansang Jobarteh, and Knight, in Jali Nyama Suso 1996-disc: 19). The era they lived in can vary widely according to who is speaking.\n\np. 148\n\np. 149\n\nAlthough a significant body of pieces is intimately wrapped up in each instrument, some pieces transcend geographical borders and are known far and wide. A kora player from Mali, for example, may know Senegambian kora pieces even though they are of little interest to his Malian patrons. Such is the case with the kora player recorded by Laura Boulton (1957-disc) in Bamako in the early 1930s, who played the piece Kelefaba, celebrating a warrior (Kelefa) from the westernmost Mande region (Kabu) who had no influence on the Mali empire in general and was a Jola (neighbors of the western Mandinka). Politically, Kelefaba is not important outside the Senegambia region, but it is known to kora players all over because of its status as a prototypical kora piece, it is like an ocean that all can drink from, as Sidiki Diabate described it (see below).\n\np. 150\n\nBala Dounbouya, who grew up in the region of Siguiri (Guinea), spent much of his life in Bamako (Mali), and then moved to Senegal, plays some of the more prominent pieces from The Gambia and Casamance, such as Masani Cisse and Kelefaba (as well as the Senegalese national anthem). He prefers pieces from his native Guinea, but many of them are virtually unknown in Dakar where he lives and teaches. Conversely, many of the Senegambian pieces he plays are insignificant in Guinea.\n\np. 151\n\nThe pieces Sunjata, Lamban, and Boloba all have a similar harmonic progression (transcription 13), yet they differ enough in their realizations so that they are not spoken of as being musically related. A Kelefa complex, on the other hand, is recognized as a group of related pieces, most likely because of the idiomatic way of playing pieces that belong to it.\n\np. 155\n\nAs noted above, Kuruntu Kelefa and Kelefaba are widely believed to be the source of kora music.\n\nThat is why any jali who is playing Kuruntu Kelefa, if it pleases them, with Allah's aid, they can create something from it and offer it to their patron. Kuruntu Kelefa is a great ocean. Everyone drinks from it. . . . It [Kelefa] is like the alphabet. Much has come from it.\" (Sidiki Diabate 1990-per, 3, 61)\n\np. 159\n\nThe origins of the various kora tunings are not clear, but the regional associations of pieces played in each tuning may provide clues. Mandinka kora players from the kora heartland (The Gambia, Casamance, and Guinea Bissau) generally agree that Tomoraba (big, great Tomora), also called Silaba (main way, main road), is the original kora tuning and that the oldest kora pieces (e.g., Kuruntu Kelefa and Kelefaba) are played in that tuning (Jobarteh 1990-per:A190, 534; King 1972:12633;Knight 1991a:19).\n\npp. 170, 17982\n\n(See Charry, 2000.) (Kora transcriptions: Kuruntu Kelefa, N'teri jato, and related pieces.)\n\np. 249\n\n. . . Kelefaba, one of the oldest pieces that is believed to have originated on the kora\n\np. 323\n\n\"Yes, it is the alphabet [of the kora]. If someone wants to learn the kora, if you want to learn the kora, if someone wants to teach you the kora, he should play Kelefaba for you. It is the alphabet because it has the kumbengo of every piece in it.\" (S. Diabate 1990-pèr:445)\n\npp. 398401 (Appendix C: Recordings of Traditional and Modern Pieces in Mande Repertories)\n\nKora: Kuruntu Kelefa/Kelefaba\n\nJali Nyama Suso ([1972] 1996) Gambie: L'art de la kora\n\nMBady Kouyate (1996, vol. 1) Guinée: Kora et chant du N'Gabu\n\nSeck and Diabate (1977) Africainement votre. . . .
