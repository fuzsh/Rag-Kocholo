Clinically unsuspected cases may be identified through neuropathologic testing. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Minimum and Neuropathologic Data Set for 1984 to 2005 were reviewed. Eligible patients had dementia, underwent autopsy, had available neuropathologic data, belonged to a currently funded Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC), and were coded as having an Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnosis or a nonprion disease etiology. For the eligible patients with neuropathology indicating prion disease, further clinical information, collected from the reporting ADC, determined whether prion disease was considered before autopsy. Of 6000 eligible patients in the NACC database, 7 (0.12%) were clinically unsuspected but autopsy-confirmed prion disease cases. The proportion of patients with dementia with clinically unrecognized but autopsy-confirmed prion disease was small. Besides confirming clinically suspected cases, neuropathology is useful to identify unsuspected clinically atypical cases of prion disease.

We describe a patient with IM and splenic rupture with a computerized tomography (CT) diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the acute phase of the infectious disease. Diagnostic imaging features of acute appendicitis were found on an abdominal CT performed for the evaluation of postoperative fever. Histologic examination confirmed the CT diagnosis of the clinically unsuspected acute appendicitis. Our case is unique both for the rarity of this complication and the lack of clinical symptoms.\n\nRadioscintigraphic demonstration of unsuspected urine extravasation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBocchini, T.; Williams, W.; Patton, D.\n\nThree cases of unsuspected urine extravasation first detected by radionuclide scintigraphy are presented with subsequent confirmation by CT and, retrograde pyelograms. A renal study done to rule out acute transplant rejection demonstrates gallbladder uptake which was initially thought to be consistent with urine extravasation.\n\nHigh prevalence of clinically unsuspected dengue disease among children in Ribeirao Preto city, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoloni, Telma Regina; Dornas, Fabio Pio; Dos Santos, Nilton Nascimento; Soares, Adriana Moreira; Amarilla, Alberto Anastacio; Alfonso, Helda Liz; Trigueiro, Sabrina; Lavrador, Marco AurÃ©lio Sicchiroli; Yamamoto, Aparecida Yulie; Aquino, Victor Hugo\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of Dengue virus (DENV)-infected children and the accuracy of dengue diagnosis based on clinical presentations. The inclusion criteria were children â¥1-year-old presenting febrile illness with 1-7 days of onset. Children (nâ=â110) aged 2-15 years were included in this study. DENV infection was confirmed with virological tests using serum, salvia, and/or urine samples. The attending pediatricians classified 56/110 (50.91%) of the children as suspected dengue cases. The DENV infection was confirmed by specific laboratory tests in 52/56 (92.9%) of the suspected dengue cases but also in 44/54 (81.5%) of the unsuspected dengue cases; total of 96/110 (87.27%) confirmed dengue cases. The clinical diagnosis gave an overall sensitivity of 54.2% (52/96) and a specificity of 71.4% (10/14). The positive predictive value of the clinical diagnosis was 92.8% and negative predictive value was 18.5%. After the third day of onset of symptoms, the DENV genome detection rate was similar in serum and saliva samples, suggesting that saliva samples represent an alternative to blood samples for early dengue diagnosis. Vaccination against Yellow fever virus did not influence the antibody response against DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, which circulated during the study period. Although the signs and symptoms were compatible with dengue, the attending pediatricians did not suspect the disease in several children. Therefore, the inclusion of virological tests for early diagnosis in the protocols for dengue surveillance would help in the implementation of prompt treatment of patients and epidemic containment strategies.

Nonetheless, acute coronary syndromes may have atypical presentations, and CCTA may be inadvertently performed in this setting. This study was designed to determine the frequency and characteristics of CCTA imaging of unsuspected acute myocardial infarction in the ED. All CCTAs performed in the ED at Lenox Hill Hospital were reviewed for clinical indications and subsequent course; patients with documented acute myocardial infarction were identified. Of the 500 CCTAs performed on ED patients in the Lenox Hill laboratory, 5 patients (1%) were imaged during the initial phase of an unsuspected acute myocardial infarction; in all cases the CCTAs were key to the diagnosis. The imaging characteristics were (1) total or subtotal occlusion and (2) transmural hypodensity in the infarct area. Although acute myocardial infarction on CCTA in ED patients is an infrequent event, proper and prompt recognition is critical for appropriate patient care, particularly as applications to the ED increase.\n\nDiagnosis of unsuspected facial fractures on routine head computerized tomographic scans in the unconscious multiply injured patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nRehm, C G; Ross, S E\n\n1995-05-01\n\nThis article assessed the value of routine head computerized axial tomographic (CT) scans for diagnosis of unsuspected facial fractures and its clinical implications in the multiply injured patient who is intubated, unconscious, or sedated at the time of initial assessment and requires a head CT scan to assess for brain injury. At a level I trauma center from June 1, 1992 to June 1, 1993 all intubated blunt trauma patients who required routine CT scan evaluation at initial assessment were studied prospectively. Routine scanning started at the foramen magnum and included the maxilla. Patients who died within the first 24 hours were excluded. The study population included 116 patients (85 male, 21 female) aged 12 to 85 years (mean, 28 years) with injury severity scores ranging from 1 to 50 (mean, 23). The mechanism of injury was: motor vehicle accidents (n = 74), motorcycling (n = 5), pedestrians accidents (n = 13), falls (n = 10), bicycling (n = 5), assaults (n = 8), and boating accident (n = 1). There were 19 suspected facial fractures; 18 required surgical repair. There were 27 unsuspected facial fractures; 13 required surgical care. Three suspected fractures were ruled out. Routine head CT scans to assess for brain injury in the multiply injured patient are also very useful in the diagnosis of unsuspected facial fractures, almost half of which will require surgical intervention.\n\nMolecular Auditing: An Evaluation of Unsuspected Tissue Specimen Misidentification.\n\nPubMed\n\nDemetrick, Douglas J\n\n2018-06-18\n\nContext Specimen misidentification is the most significant error in laboratory medicine, potentially accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in extra health care expenses and significant morbidity in patient populations in the United States alone. New technology allows the unequivocal documentation of specimen misidentification or contamination; however, the value of this technology currently depends on suspicion of the specimen integrity by a pathologist or other health care worker. Objective To test the hypothesis that there is a detectable incidence of unsuspected tissue specimen misidentification among cases submitted for routine surgical pathology examination. Design To test this hypothesis, we selected specimen pairs that were obtained at different times and/or different hospitals from the same patient, and compared their genotypes using standardized microsatellite markers used commonly for forensic human DNA comparison in order to identify unsuspected mismatches between the specimen pairs as a trial of \"molecular auditing.\" We preferentially selected gastrointestinal, prostate, and skin biopsies because we estimated that these types of specimens had the greatest potential for misidentification. Results Of 972 specimen pairs, 1 showed an unexpected discordant genotype profile, indicating that 1 of the 2 specimens was misidentified. To date, we are unable to identify the etiology of the discordance. Conclusions These results demonstrate that, indeed, there is a low level of unsuspected tissue specimen misidentification, even in an environment with careful adherence to stringent quality assurance practices. This study demonstrates that molecular auditing of random, routine biopsy specimens can identify occult misidentified specimens, and may function as a useful quality indicator.\n\nCancer clinical trials in persons with HIV infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nLittle, Richard F\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe era of modern HIV therapeutics is well underway. The cancer and infectious disease epidemiology of HIV disease has markedly altered as populations are availed to the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). The types of cancers occurring among those with HIV infection has broadened but the case burden in absolute numbers is very low relative to the background population. There are fewer incident cases of the AIDS-defining cancers (aggressive B-cell lymphomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cervical cancer). There is an increased risk for certain non-AIDS-defining cancers, but these occur somewhat sporadically relative to clinical trial enrollment. The changing epidemiology of cancer in HIV poses challenges as well as opportunities for participation of persons with HIV in cancer therapy clinical trials. There are excellent examples of cancer trials that inform cancer therapy for patients with HIV infection. Examples include those from HIV-specific trials and from trials mainly focused on the background population that included patients with HIV infection. Interpretation of clinical trials to guide therapy for those with HIV infection and cancer largely depends on data that does not include HIV-infected patients. The ability to extend clinical trial findings to populations not included in clinical trials remains problematic for a variety of populations, including those with HIV or AIDS. Careful prioritization of studies designed to bridge this gap is needed. However, there are published studies that serve as excellent examples bridging these gaps and the portfolio of cancer therapy trials underway will inform HIV and cancer better than at any time in the past.\n\nClinical profile of STD clinic patients seropositive for HIV antibodies.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrishnaiah, Y R; Babu, V S; Lakshmi, N; Kumar, A G\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThis article provides clinical profiles for HIV seropositive patients discovered at an STD clinic in Tirupati, India. Considering that sexual contact is the most common mode of transmission of HIV, researchers from the SV Medical College at Tirupati conducted a surveillance for HIV infection among patients attending an STD clinic. From January 1988 to April 1989, the researchers collected serum samples from 2320 patients. 11 people were found to be infected with HIV, 1 of whom exhibited the AIDS Related Complex (ARC). 9 out the HIV-infected patients were 20-30 year-old males categorized as heterosexually promiscuous; the remaining 2 seropositive patients were female prostitutes. The seropositivity rate among heterosexually promiscuous males was 0.58%, and 6.7% among female prostitutes (the total seropositivity rate was 0.47%). Among the HIV-infected patients, the most commonly associated STD was syphilis. 5 of the patients had syphilis alone, and 2 others had syphilis and another STD. One of the HIV-infected patients, a 50 year-old heterosexual male with a history of multiple partners, suffered from a nonhealing genital ulcer and inguinal buboes of 1 month duration. A biopsy of the genital ulcer revealed a pattern consistent with that of granuloma venereum. He also developed angular stomatitis which did not respond to B complex therapy. Furthermore, suffering from persistent lymphadenopathy, weight loss, slight thrombo-cytopenia, an opportunistic infection in the form of oral candidosis and persistent seropositivity for HIV antibodies, the patient was deemed to have the AIDS Related Complex. Tirupati's seropositivity rate of .47% was higher that noticed in other parts of the country, leading the authors call for a plan to investigate the problems of HIV-infected people.\n\nAchieving Core Indicators for HIV Clinical Care Among New Patients at an Urban HIV Clinic.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreer, Gillian A; Tamhane, Ashutosh; Malhotra, Rakhi; Burkholder, Greer A; Mugavero, Michael J; Raper, James L; Zinski, Anne\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFollowing the release of the 2010 National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued core clinical indicators for measuring health outcomes in HIV-positive persons. As early retention in HIV primary care is associated with improved long-term health outcomes, we employed IOM indicators as a guide to examine a cohort of persons initiating HIV outpatient medical care at a university-affiliated HIV clinic in the Southern United States (January 2007-July 2012). Using indicators for visit attendance, CD4 and viral load laboratory testing frequency, and antiretroviral therapy initiation, we evaluated factors associated with achieving IOM core indicators among care- and treatment-naÃ¯ve patients during the first year of HIV care. Of 448 patients (mean ageâ=â35 years, 35.7% white, 79.0% male, 58.4% education beyond high school, 35.9% monthly incomeâ>â$1,000 US, 47.3% uninsured), 84.6% achieved at least four of five IOM indicators. In multivariable analyses, persons with monthly incomeâ>â$1,000 (ORadj.â=â3.71; 95% CI: 1.68-8.19; pâ=â0.001) and depressive symptoms (ORadj.â=â2.13; 95% CI: 1.02-4.45; pâ=â0.04) were significantly more likely to achieve at least four of the five core indicators, while patients with anxiety symptoms were significantly less likely to achieve these indicators (ORadj.â=â0.50; 95% CI: 0.26-0.97; pâ=â0.04). Age, sex, race, education, insurance status, transportation barriers, alcohol use, and HIV status disclosure to family were not associated with achieving core indicators. Evaluating and addressing financial barriers and anxiety symptoms during the first year of HIV outpatient care may improve individual health outcomes and subsequent achievement of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.\n\nHIV-1 transmission linkage in an HIV-1 prevention clinical trial\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLeitner, Thomas; Campbell, Mary S; Mullins, James I\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHIV-1 sequencing has been used extensively in epidemiologic and forensic studies to investigate patterns of HIV-1 transmission. However, the criteria for establishing genetic linkage between HIV-1 strains in HIV-1 prevention trials have not been formalized. The Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study (ClinicaITrials.gov NCT00194519) enrolled 3408 HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual African couples to determine the efficacy of genital herpes suppression with acyclovir in reducing HIV-1 transmission. The trial analysis required laboratory confirmation of HIV-1 linkage between enrolled partners in couples in which seroconversion occurred. Here we describe the process and results from HIV-1 sequencing studies used to perform transmission linkage determinationmoreÂ Â» in this clinical trial. Consensus Sanger sequencing of env (C2-V3-C3) and gag (p17-p24) genes was performed on plasma HIV-1 RNA from both partners within 3 months of seroconversion; env single molecule or pyrosequencing was also performed in some cases. For linkage, we required monophyletic clustering between HIV-1 sequences in the transmitting and seroconverting partners, and developed a Bayesian algorithm using genetic distances to evaluate the posterior probability of linkage of participants sequences. Adjudicators classified transmissions as linked, unlinked, or indeterminate. Among 151 seroconversion events, we found 108 (71.5%) linked, 40 (26.5%) unlinked, and 3 (2.0%) to have indeterminate transmissions. Nine (8.3%) were linked by consensus gag sequencing only and 8 (7.4%) required deep sequencing of env. In this first use of HIV-1 sequencing to establish endpoints in a large clinical trial, more than one-fourth of transmissions were unlinked to the enrolled partner, illustrating the relevance of these methods in the design of future HIV-1 prevention trials in serodiscordant couples. A hierarchy of sequencing techniques, analysis methods, and expert adjudication contributed to the linkage\n\nThe impact of HIV clinical pharmacists on HIV treatment outcomes: a systematic review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaberi, Parya; Dong, Betty J; Johnson, Mallory O; Greenblatt, Ruth M; Cocohoba, Jennifer M\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective Due to the rapid proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment options, there is a need for health care providers with knowledge of antiretroviral therapy intricacies. In a HIV multidisciplinary care team, the HIV pharmacist is well-equipped to provide this expertise. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of HIV pharmacists on HIV clinical outcomes. Methods We searched six electronic databases from January 1, 1980 to June 1, 2011 and included all quantitative studies that examined pharmacistâs roles in the clinical care of HIV-positive adults. Primary outcomes were antiretroviral adherence, viral load, and CD4+ cell count and secondary outcomes included health care utilization parameters, antiretroviral modifications, and other descriptive variables. Results Thirty-two publications were included. Despite methodological limitation, the involvement of HIV pharmacists was associated with statistically significant adherence improvements and positive impact on viral suppression in the majority of studies. Conclusion This systematic review provides evidence of the beneficial impact of HIV pharmacists on HIV treatment outcomes and offers suggestions for future research.

In recent years, novel gene- and cell-based therapies have gained increasing attention due to their potential to provide a functional or even sterilizing cure for HIV infection with a one-shot treatment. A functional cure would keep the infection in check and prevent progression to AIDS, while a sterilizing cure would eradicate all HIV viruses from the patient. Genome editing is the most precise form of gene therapy, able to achieve permanent genetic disruption, modification, or insertion at a predesignated genetic locus. The most well-studied candidate for anti-HIV genome editing is CCR5, an essential coreceptor for the majority of HIV strains, and the lack of which confers HIV resistance in naturally occurring homozygous individuals. Genetic disruption of CCR5 to treat HIV has undergone clinical testing, with seven completed or ongoing trials in T cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and has shown promising safety and potential efficacy profiles. Here we summarize clinical findings of CCR5 editing for HIV therapy, as well as other genome editing-based approaches under pre-clinical development. The anticipated development of more sophisticated genome editing technologies should continue to benefit HIV cure efforts.\n\nVirology, Immunology, and Clinical Course of HIV Infection.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcCutchan, J.

Our project identified strategies used by a rural HIV clinic with high rates of viral suppression, as evidenced by data abstraction from medical records from January 2010 through December 2014, including 411 patients ages 18Â years or older. As HIV viral load is used as a marker for adherence and impacts health outcomes and transmission, it is an important assay. The national goal is for 80% of PLWH to be virologically suppressed by the end of 2020. This clinic exceeded the goal in 2014 with observed rates of 80% to 90% suppression. Eleven national guidelines for HIV care have been adopted by this clinic, along with five additional evidence-based interventions. Nurses played a critical role in all of these methods, and our intent was to report success-related factors. Copyright Â© 2016 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pilot program to determine how to implement confidential HIV testing services in community pharmacies and retail clinics. 21 community pharmacies and retail clinics serving urban and rural patients in the United States, from August 2011 to July 2013. 106 community pharmacy and retail clinic staff members. A model was developed to implement confidential HIV counseling and testing services using community pharmacy and retail clinic staff as certified testing providers, or through collaborations with organizations that provide HIV testing. Training materials were developed and sites selected that serve patients from urban and rural areas to pilot test the model. Each site established a relationship with its local health department for HIV testing policies, developed referral lists for confirmatory HIV testing/care, secured a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, and advertised the service. Staff were trained to perform a rapid point-of-care HIV test on oral fluid, and provide patients with confidential test results and information on HIV. Patients with a preliminary positive result were referred to a physician or health department for confirmatory testing and, if needed, HIV clinical care. Number of HIV tests completed and amount of time required to conduct testing. The 21 participating sites administered 1,540 HIV tests, with 1,087 conducted onsite by staff during regular working hours and 453 conducted at 37 different HIV testing events (e.g., local health fairs). The median amount of time required for pretest counseling/consent, waiting for test results, and posttest counseling was 4, 23, and 3 minutes, respectively. A majority of the sites (17) said they planned to continue HIV testing after the project period ended and would seek assistance or support from the local health department, a community-based organization, or an AIDS\n\nEffect of nondisclosure of HIV status in sexual health clinics on unlinked anonymous HIV prevalence estimates in England, 2005-2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nSavage, Emma J; Lowndes, Catherine M; Sullivan, Ann K; Back, David J; Else, Laura J; Murphy, Gary; Gill, O Noel\n\n2016-01-02\n\nTo assess the extent of nondisclosure of known HIV status among sexual health clinic attendees and to quantify the impact of nondisclosure on estimates of undiagnosed HIV prevalence and of the proportion of patients remaining undiagnosed on leaving the clinic. Serum samples from the unlinked anonymous survey of clinic attendees' archive were tested for antiretrovirals. Estimates of undiagnosed HIV were adjusted using the findings. Antiretrovirals were detected in 27% of samples taken from 'previously undiagnosed' attendees, who did not have an HIV test but were HIV positive as detected by unlinked anonymous testing, indicating nondisclosure; 24% of such samples from MSM had antiretrovirals present compared with 32% of heterosexual men and women. Antiretrovirals were detected in 33% of samples from London clinics and in 21% from non-London clinics. Following adjustment, the estimated prevalence of undiagnosed HIV decreased nonsignificantly from 3.04% (95% confidence interval 2.71-3.41) to 2.66% (2.35-3.01) among men who have sex with men (MSM), 0.31% (0.26-0.37) to 0.30% (0.25-0.36) in heterosexual men and 0.40% (0.35-0.46) to 0.37% (0.32-0.43) in women; 7% of MSM who do not have an HIV test at a clinic visit will be infected with HIV and remain unaware of their infection. Nondisclosure of HIV status to healthcare professionals occurs among clinic attendees. Adjustment for nondisclosure results in a small, nonsignificant decrease in the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV estimated from the unlinked anonymous survey in sexual health clinics. Testing the population of MSM not having an HIV test remains a priority as levels of undiagnosed HIV are high.\n\nCOMPARISON OF VISUAL PROGNOSIS AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS RETINITIS IN HIV AND NON-HIV PATIENTS.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Dong Yoon; Jo, Jaehyuck; Joe, Soo Geun; Kim, June-Gone; Yoon, Young Hee; Lee, Joo Yong\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo compare the visual prognosis and clinical features of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis between HIV and non-HIV patients. Retrospective cross-sectional study on patients diagnosed with CMV retinitis. Depending on the presence of HIV infection, best-corrected visual acuity (VA) and clinical feature of CMV retinitis were analyzed. The clinical characteristics associated with poor visual prognosis after antiviral treatment were also identified. A total of 78 eyes (58 patients) with CMV retinitis were included in this study: 21 eyes and 57 eyes in HIV and non-HIV patients, respectively. Best-corrected VA was not significantly different between HIV and non-HIV patients. The rate of foveal involvement, retinal detachment, involved zone, and mortality did not significantly differ between the two groups. Visual acuity after antiviral treatment was significantly worse (pretreatment logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution best-corrected VA, 0.54 Â± 0.67 [Snellen VA, 20/63]; posttreatment logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution best-corrected VA, 0.77 Â± 0.94 [Snellen VA, 20/125]; P = 0.014). Poor visual prognosis was significantly associated with Zone 1 involvement, retinal detachment, and a poor general condition. The overall visual prognosis and the clinical features of CMV retinitis do not differ between HIV and non-HIV patients. The visual prognosis of CMV retinitis still remains quite poor despite advancements in antiviral treatment. This poor prognosis after antiviral treatment is associated with retinal detachment during follow-up, Zone 1 involvement, and the poor general condition of the patient.\n\nClinical, nutritional and immunological characteristics of HIV-infected children in an area of high HIV prevalence.\n\nPubMed\n\nPedrini, Maura; Moraleda, Cinta; Macete, Eusebio; Gondo, Kizito; Brabin, Bernard J; MenÃ©ndez, Clara\n\n2015-08-01\n\nTo evaluate the clinical, nutritional and neurodevelopment status of HIV-infected children in a high HIV prevalence area. All HIV-infected children under 15 years of age attending an outpatient clinic of Mozambique between April and May 2010 were recruited. Clinical data were collected and physical examination was performed. In all, 140 children were recruited. The median age at HIV diagnosis was 2.1 years. Fifty-one percent of the children were classified in WHO clinical Stages 3 or 4. Median age of antiretroviral treatment commencement was 3.9 years. Overall, 68% were undernourished, mainly stunted. Forty-four percent failed to pass the national psychomotor developmental test. The pathways for early HIV diagnosis and start of antiretrovirals in children should be improved in Mozambique. Malnutrition, especially stunting, and developmental delay were highly prevalent. Further research focused on early diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and on the indications of antiretroviral treatment commencement based on chronic malnutrition is required.

This was a retrospective chart review evaluating the proportion of anal dysplasia among a multiethnic population from an ambulatory university-based HIV clinic in Hawaii. Demographic, clinical, and virologic parameters were examined with respect to abnormal anal Pap smear. Variables included: Pap smear results (outcome variable), cytology results, age, self-reported ethnicity, CD4/ nadir CD4 counts, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy use, Hepatitis B and C co-infections, history of sexually transmitted diseases, personal history of cancer, tobacco use, alcohol use, intravenous drug abuse, family history of cancer, and history of genital/anal warts. There were no significant differences in rates of abnormal Pap smear among the ethnic groups. Abnormal Pap smears were associated with history of genital warts (7% normal vs. 18% abnormal, p=.01) and alcohol consumption (16% vs. 27%, p=.05). Hepatitis B infection and current anti-retroviral therapy (ART) were associated with normal Pap cytology (9.7% vs. 0%, p=.03) and (96.8% vs. 86.5%, p=.05) respectively. No differences in the proportion of abnormal Pap smears were seen among ethnic groups followed within an ambulatory HIV clinic.\n\nA conceptual model exploring the relationship between HIV stigma and implementing HIV clinical trials in rural communities of North Carolina.\n\nPubMed\n\nSengupta, Sohini; Strauss, Ronald P; Miles, Margaret S; Roman-Isler, Malika; Banks, Bahby; Corbie-Smith, Giselle\n\n2010-01-01\n\nHIV/AIDS disproportionately affects minority groups in the United States, especially in the rural southeastern states. Poverty and lack of access to HIV care, including clinical trials, are prevalent in these areas and contribute to HIV stigma. This is the first study to develop a conceptual model exploring the relationship between HIV stigma and the implementation of HIV clinical trials in rural contexts to help improve participation in those trials. We conducted focus groups with HIV service providers and community leaders, and individual interviews with people living with HIV/AIDS in six counties in rural North Carolina. Themes related to stigma were elicited. We classified the themes into theoretical constructs and developed a conceptual model. HIV stigma themes were classified under the existing theoretical constructs of perceived, experienced, vicarious, and felt normative stigma. Two additional constructs emerged: causes of HIV stigma (e.g., low HIV knowledge and denial in the community) and consequences of HIV stigma (e.g., confidentiality concerns in clinical trials). The conceptual model illustrates that the causes of HIV stigma can give rise to perceived, experienced, and vicarious HIV stigma, and these types of stigma could lead to the consequences of HIV stigma that include felt normative stigma. Understanding HIV stigma in rural counties of North Carolina may not be generalizeable to other rural US southeastern states. The conceptual model emphasizes that HIV stigma--in its many forms--is a critical barrier to HIV clinical trial implementation in rural North Carolina.\n\nA Conceptual Model Exploring the Relationship Between HIV Stigma and Implementing HIV Clinical Trials in Rural Communities of North Carolina\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSengupta, Sohini; Strauss, Ronald P.; Miles, Margaret S.; Roman-Isler, Malika; Banks, Bahby; Corbie-Smith, Giselle\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects minority groups in the United States, especially in the rural southeastern states. Poverty and lack of access to HIV care, including clinical trials, are prevalent in these areas and contribute to HIV stigma. This is the first study to develop a conceptual model exploring the relationship between HIV stigma and the implementation of HIV clinical trials in rural contexts to help improve participation in those trials. Methods We conducted focus groups with HIV service providers and community leaders, and individual interviews with people living with HIV/AIDS in six counties in rural North Carolina. Themes related to stigma were elicited. We classified the themes into theoretical constructs and developed a conceptual model. Results HIV stigma themes were classified under the existing theoretical constructs of perceived, experienced, vicarious, and felt normative stigma. Two additional constructs emerged: causes of HIV stigma (e.g., low HIV knowledge and denial in the community) and consequences of HIV stigma (e.g., confidentiality concerns in clinical trials). The conceptual model illustrates that the causes of HIV stigma can give rise to perceived, experienced, and vicarious HIV stigma, and these types of stigma could lead to the consequences of HIV stigma that include felt normative stigma. Limitations Understanding HIV stigma in rural counties of North Carolina may not be generalizeable to other rural US southeastern states. Conclusion The conceptual model emphasizes that HIV stigmaâin its many formsâis a critical barrier to HIV clinical trial implementation in rural North Carolina.

We developed a quality-improvement tracking system at an urban methadone clinic to monitor patients along the HIV care continuum and identify patients needing intervention. To evaluate patient outcomes along the HIV Care Continuum at an urban methadone clinic and explore the relationship of HIV primary care site and patient demographic characteristics with retention in HIV treatment and viral suppression. We reviewed electronic medical record data from 2015 for all methadone clinic patients with known HIV disease, including age, gender, race, HIV care sites, HIV care visit dates and HIV viral load. Patients received either HIV primary care at the methadone clinic, an HIV specialty clinic located in the adjacent building, or a community clinic. Retention was defined as an HIV primary care visit in both halves of the year. Viral suppression was defined as an HIV viral load <40 copies/ml at the last lab draw. The population (nÂ =Â 65) was 63% male, 82% age 45 or older and 60% non-Caucasian. Of these 65 patients 77% (nÂ =Â 50) were retained in care and 80% (nÂ =Â 52) were virologically suppressed. Viral suppression was significantly higher for women (pÂ =Â .022) and patients 45Â years or older (pÂ =Â .034). There was a trend towards greater retention in care and viral suppression among patients receiving HIV care at the methadone clinic (93, 93%) compared to the HIV clinic (74, 79%) or community clinics (62, 62%). Retention in HIV care and viral suppression are high in an urban methadone clinic providing integrated HIV services. This quality improvement analysis supports integrating HIV primary care with methadone treatment services for this at-risk population.\n\nPredictors of pregnancy and changes in pregnancy incidence among HIV-positive women accessing HIV clinical care at 13 large UK clinics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHUNTINGTON, Susie E; THORNE, Claire; BANSI, Loveleen K; ANDERSON, Jane; NEWELL, Marie-Louise; TAYLOR, Graham P; PILLAY, Deenan; HILL, Teresa; TOOKEY, Pat A; SABIN, Caroline A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjectives To describe predictors of pregnancy and changes in pregnancy incidence among HIV-positive women accessing HIV clinical care. Methods Data were obtained through the linkage of two separate studies; the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study (UK CHIC), a cohort of adults attending 13 large HIV clinics, and the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC), a national surveillance study of HIV-positive pregnant women. Pregnancy incidence was measured using the proportion of women in UK CHIC with a pregnancy reported to NSHPC. Generalised estimating equations were used to identify predictors of pregnancy and assess changes in pregnancy incidence in 2000-2009. Results The number of women accessing care at UK CHIC sites increased as did the number of pregnancies (from 72 to 230). Older women were less likely to have a pregnancy (adjusted Relative Rate (aRR) 0.44 per 10 year increment in age [95% CI [0.41-0.46], p<0.001) as were women with CD4<200 cells/mm3 compared with CD4 200-350 cells/mm3 (aRR 0.65 [0.55-0.77] p<0.001) and women of white ethnicity compared with women of black-African ethnicity (aRR 0.67 [0.57-0.80], p<0.001). The likelihood that women had a pregnancy increased over the study period (aRR 1.05 [1.03-1.07], p<0.001). The rate of change did not significantly differ according to age group, ART use, CD4 group or ethnicity. Conclusions The pregnancy rate among women accessing HIV clinical care increased in 2000-2009. HIV-positive women with, or planning, a pregnancy require a high level of care and this is likely to continue and increase as more women of older age have pregnancies.

Though there is a notable decline in new HIV infections, continued effort is still needed to develop an efficacious, accessible and affordable HIV vaccine. HIV vaccine clinical trials bear risks, hence a need to understand volunteer motivators for enrolment, retention and follow-up. Understanding the factors that motivate volunteers to participate in a clinical trial can help to strategize, refine targeting and thus increase enrolment of volunteers in future HIV vaccine clinical trials. The health belief model classifies motivators into social benefits such as âadvancing researchâ and collaboration with science, and personal benefits such as health benefits and financial interests. Method A thematic analysis was carried out on data obtained from four HIV clinical trials conducted at KAVI-Institute of Clinical Research in Nairobi Kenya from 2009 to 2015. Responses were obtained from a Questionnaire administered to the volunteers during their screening visit at the research site. Results Of the 281 healthy, HIV-uninfected volunteers participating in this study; 38% were motivated by personal benefits including, 31% motivated by health benefits and 7% motivated by possible financial gains. In addition, 62% of the volunteers were motivated by social benefits with 20% of who were seeking to help their family/society/world while 42% were interested in advancing research. Conclusion The majority of volunteers in the HIV vaccine trials at our site were motivated by social benefits, suggesting that altruism can be a major contributor to participation in HIV vaccine studies. Personal benefits were a secondary motivator for the volunteers. The motivators to volunteer in HIV clinical trials were similar across ages, education level and gender.

Although conventional gene therapy approaches typically involve the addition of anti-HIV genes to cells using semirandomly integrating viral vectors, newer genome editing technologies based on engineered nucleases are now allowing more precise genetic manipulations. The possible outcomes of genome editing include gene disruption, which has been most notably applied to the CCR5 coreceptor gene, or the introduction of small mutations or larger whole gene cassette insertions at a targeted locus. Disruption of CCR5 using zinc finger nucleases was the first-in-human application of genome editing and remains the most clinically advanced platform, with 7 completed or ongoing clinical trials in T cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here we review the laboratory and clinical findings of CCR5 editing in T cells and HSPCs for HIV therapy and summarize other promising genome editing approaches for future clinical development. In particular, recent advances in the delivery of genome editing reagents and the demonstration of highly efficient homology-directed editing in both T cells and HSPCs are expected to spur the development of even more sophisticated applications of this technology for HIV therapy.

The main goal of this research is retrospective analysis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 28 HIV infected patients, who were diagnosed and treated at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in University Clinical Center Tuzla in the period from 1996 until the end of 2013. Retrospective analysis was performed using the medical records of 28 HIV-infected persons. Two rapid tests were used for HIV testing: OraQuick Advance test, Vikia HIV1/2, Elisa combo test, HIV RNA test. AIDS disease was determined by using the criteria from WHO. Among a total of 28 HIV-infected persons, 23 (82.14%) were males and 5 (17.86%) were females, with the male: female ratio of 4,6:1. In terms of the transmission route, a large proportion of cases were infected through heterosexual contact 19 (67.86%). At the time of the first visit, 16 (57.15%) patients showed asymptomatic HIV infection, 4 (14.28%) HIV infection with symptoms other than the AIDS defining diseases, and 8 (28.57) had AIDS. At the time of first hospital visit, the CD4 + cells count ranged from 40 to 1795/Âµl (conducted in 19 patients), and mean value of CD4 + cells was 365,31/Âµl, and mean HIV RNA titer was 287 118 copies/mlÂ³. Of 28 HIV-infected persons 39 cases of opportunistic diseases developed in 12 patients (42.9%). In terms of the frequency of opportunistic diseases, tuberculosis (12 cases, 42.9%). Among a total of 28 HIV-infected patients, 6 (21.4%) of them died. This study characterizes the epidemiological and clinical patterns of HIV-infected patients in Tuzla region of Bosnia and Herzegovina to accurately understand HIV infection/AIDS in our region, in the hope to contribute in the establishment of effective HIV guidelines in the Tuzla region of B&H in the future.\n\nParticipation in clinical trials among women living with HIV in Canada\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHankins, C; Lapointe, N; Walmsley, S\n\n1998-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: To describe participation in clinical trials among HIV-positive women enrolled since 1993 in the Canadian Women's HIV Study, a prospective open cohort study. METHODS: All HIV-positive women being followed at hospital-based or community-based clinics at 28 sites in 11 Canadian cities were eligible to participate in the Canadian Women's HIV Study. Baseline and follow-up information was collected for 413 women every 6 months by study nurses using standardized questionnaires. Data included sociodemographic variables, HIV exposure group, CD4 count, disease classification, use of antiretroviral therapies and participation in clinical trials. RESULTS: At study intake 15.0% (62/413) of the women had participated in a clinical trial; an additional 8.5% (35/413) participated during a median follow-up of 18 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that the following factors were independently associated with participation in a clinical trial: white race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.38, p = 0.001), current use of antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR 2.01, p = 0.008), completion of secondary school (adjusted OR 1.97, p = 0.024) and residence in the Prairies or Atlantic provinces (adjusted OR 1.98, p = 0.043). INTERPRETATION: Although the overall clinical trial participation rate of 23.5% was relatively high among HIV-positive women, injection drug users were underrepresented in this study population, and non-white women, women who did not complete high school and women not receiving antiretroviral therapy were less likely than white women, women of higher education and women receiving antiretroviral therapy to participate in clinical trials in Canada. Because of the importance of trial participants being representative of the population for which therapeutic agents are intended, HIV clinical trials must recruit women with lower literacy levels, non-white women, women not receiving antiretroviral therapy and women who are injection drug users to ensure generalizability\n\nThe implementation of isoniazid preventive therapy in HIV clinics: the experience from the TB/HIV in Rio (THRio) study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDurovni, Betina; Cavalcante, Solange C; Saraceni, Valeria; Vellozo, Vitoria; Israel, Giselle; King, Bonnie S; Cohn, Silvia; Efron, Anne; Pacheco, Antonio G; Moulton, Lawrence H; Chaisson, Richard E; Golub, Jonathan E\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThe TB/HIV in Rio (THRio) study was launched in September 2005 to assess the impact of integrated tuberculosis (TB) and HIV treatment strategies in 29 HIV clinics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. THRio is a cluster-randomized trial (CRT) to determine whether routine screening for and treatment of latent TB in HIV clinic patients with access to antiretroviral therapy will reduce TB incidence at the clinic level. THRio is part of the Consortium to Respond Effectively to AIDS/TB Epidemic that is implementing research studies to assess the impact of bold, new public health paradigms for controlling the AIDS/TB epidemic. Twenty-nine public primary HIV clinics were randomly assigned a date to begin implementing TB screening procedures and provision of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for TB/HIV coinfected patients. Final analysis of the CRT is expected in 2011. Starting at date of tuberculin skin test (TST)/IPT implementation at each clinic through August 2010, 1670 HIV-infected patients initiated IPT, of which 215 are still receiving treatment. Of the remaining 1455 patients, 1230 (85%) completed therapy and only 20 (1.2%) patients initiating IPT reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of therapy. IPT completion was higher among HIV-infected patients receiving HAART (87%) than those not yet receiving HAART (79%, P < 0.01). Times to TST and IPT have markedly decreased postintervention, but remain considerably long. The richness of the THRio database has resulted in several analyses of this expansive cohort of HIV-infected patients that are reviewed here. The national implementation of TST and IPT for HIV-positive patients in Brazil has been invigorated partly due to THRio's baseline results. Expanded use of IPT in HIV patients in Rio de Janeiro is achievable with high adherence and low adverse events, although this effort requires a package of activities including training, advocacy and reorganization of services.\n\nSome clinical aspects of HIV infection in Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarries, A\n\n1991-07-01\n\nWHO has estimated the cumulative number of AIDS cases in Africa to have grown from 2978 (1986) to 81,019 (1990). The actual numbers are probably much higher due to under reporting, under diagnosis, and delays in notification. Pathogenicity and clinical features of HIV 2, found mainly in west Africa, are similar to those of HIV 1. 2nd generation HIV-ELISA tests can check for both viruses' antigens. These and other ELISA tests can be used to rapidly identify HIV, but clinical criteria alone can usually determine an accurate diagnosis. In developed countries, AZT (zidovudine) shows some promise of stemming the onset of AIDS in asymptomatic patients. Other promising antiretrovirus drugs are being developed, but are all too expensive for Africa. Almost 33% of HIV positive patients in Africa also have tuberculosis (TB) and, up to 1988, around 40% of TB patients tested HIV positive. In Uganda, Zambia, and Malawi the percentages ranged from 50-65% in TB patients. HIV positive TB patients have a substantial higher mortality than HIV negative TB patients. In some areas of Africa, 66% of AIDS patients have chronic, watery diarrhea and weight loss. The most common pathogens include Cryptosporidium and Isopora belli. Cryptosporidium does not respond to treatment, so there is a concern of a hospital based outbreak in AIDS patients. Cytomegalovirus also causes gastrointestinal illness in African AIDS patients as well as pulmonary disease. Toxoplasma and Cryptococcus often attack the central nervous system of AIDS patients. Oral fluconazole can provide some initial relief from cryptococcal meningitis. Bacteremia is also common. Little evidence exists to suggest an important interaction between HIV and traditional tropical diseases. Unlike Western nations, pneumocystosis and Mycobacterium avium intracellular are uncommon in Africa.\n\nUsing two on-going HIV studies to obtain clinical data from before, during and after pregnancy for HIV-positive women.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuntington, Susie E; Bansi, Loveleen K; Thorne, Claire; Anderson, Jane; Newell, Marie-Louise; Taylor, Graham P; Pillay, Deenan; Hill, Teresa; Tookey, Pat A; Sabin, Caroline A\n\n2012-07-28\n\nThe UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) is an observational study that collates data on HIV-positive adults accessing HIV clinical care at (currently) 13 large clinics in the UK but does not collect pregnancy specific data. The National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC) collates data on HIV-positive women receiving antenatal care from every maternity unit in the UK and Ireland. Both studies collate pseudonymised data and neither dataset contains unique patient identifiers. A methodology was developed to find and match records for women reported to both studies thereby obtaining clinical and treatment data on pregnant HIV-positive women not available from either dataset alone. Women in UK CHIC receiving HIV-clinical care in 1996-2009, were found in the NSHPC dataset by initially 'linking' records with identical date-of-birth, linked records were then accepted as a genuine 'match', if they had further matching fields including CD4 test date. In total, 2063 women were found in both datasets, representing 23.1% of HIV-positive women with a pregnancy in the UK (n = 8932). Clinical data was available in UK CHIC following most pregnancies (92.0%, 2471/2685 pregnancies starting before 2009). There was bias towards matching women with repeat pregnancies (35.9% (741/2063) of women found in both datasets had a repeat pregnancy compared to 21.9% (1502/6869) of women in NSHPC only) and matching women HIV diagnosed before their first reported pregnancy (54.8% (1131/2063) compared to 47.7% (3278/6869), respectively). Through the use of demographic data and clinical dates, records from two independent studies were successfully matched, providing data not available from either study alone.\n\nRetention in HIV care depends on patients' perceptions of the clinic experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nWessinger, Matthew H; Hennink, Monique M; Kaiser, Bonnie N; Mangal, Jed P; Gokhale, Runa H; Ruchin, Lauren; Moanna, Abeer; Rimland, David; Farber, Eugene W; Marconi, Vincent C\n\n2017-10-01\n\nInstitutional barriers in HIV primary care settings can contribute substantially to disparities in retention in HIV treatment and HIV-related outcomes. This qualitative study compared the perceptions of clinic experiences of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in a Veterans Affairs HIV primary care clinic setting who were retained in care with the experiences of those who were not retained in care. Qualitative data from 25 in-depth interviews were analyzed to identify facilitators and barriers to retention in HIV care. Results showed that participants not retained in care experienced barriers to retention involving dissatisfaction with clinic wait times, low confidence in clinicians, and customer service concerns. For participants retained in care, patience with procedural issues, confidence in clinicians, and interpersonal connections were factors that enhanced retention despite the fact that these participants recognized the same barriers as those who were not retained in care. These findings can inform interventions aimed at improving retention in HIV care.\n\nPneumococcal pneumonia: clinical features, diagnosis and management in HIV-infected and HIV noninfected patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nMadeddu, Giordano; Fois, Alessandro Giuseppe; Pirina, Pietro; Mura, Maria Stella\n\n2009-05-01\n\nIn this review, we focus on the clinical features, diagnosis and management of pneumococcal pneumonia in HIV-infected and noninfected patients, with particular attention to the most recent advances in this area. Classical clinical features are found in young adults, whereas atypical forms occur in immunocompromised patients including HIV-infected individuals. Bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is more frequently observed in HIV-infected and also in low-risk patients, according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Pneumococcal pneumonia diagnostic process includes physical examination, radiologic findings and microbiologic diagnosis. However, etiologic diagnosis using traditional culture methods is difficult to obtain. In this setting, urinary antigen test, which recognizes Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall C-polysaccharide, increases the probability of etiologic diagnosis. A correct management approach is crucial in reducing pneumococcal pneumonia mortality. The use of the PSI helps clinicians in deciding between inpatient and outpatient management in immunocompetent individuals, according to Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)-American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Recent findings support PSI utility also in HIV-infected patients. Recently, efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in reducing pneumococcal disease incidence has been evidenced in both HIV-infected and noninfected individuals. Rapid diagnosis and correct management together with implementation of preventive measures are crucial in order to reduce pneumococcal pneumonia related incidence and mortality in HIV-infected and noninfected patients.\n\nCreating an African HIV Clinical Research and Prevention Trials Network: HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Transmission\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKamali, Anatoli; Price, Matt A.; Lakhi, Shabir; Karita, Etienne; Inambao, Mubiana; Sanders, Eduard J.; Anzala, Omu; Latka, Mary H.; Bekker, Linda-Gail; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Asiki, Gershim; Ssetaala, Ali; Ruzagira, Eugene; Allen, Susan; Farmer, Paul; Hunter, Eric; Mutua, Gaudensia; Makkan, Heeran; Tichacek, Amanda; Brill, Ilene K.; Fast, Pat; Stevens, Gwynn; Chetty, Paramesh; Amornkul, Pauli N.; Gilmour, Jill\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHIV epidemiology informs prevention trial design and program planning. Nine clinical research centers (CRC) in sub-Saharan Africa conducted HIV observational epidemiology studies in populations at risk for HIV infection as part of an HIV prevention and vaccine trial network. Annual HIV incidence ranged from below 2% to above 10% and varied by CRC and risk group, with rates above 5% observed in Zambian men in an HIV-discordant relationship, Ugandan men from Lake Victoria fishing communities, men who have sex with men, and several cohorts of women. HIV incidence tended to fall after the first three months in the study and over calendar time. Among suspected transmission pairs, 28% of HIV infections were not from the reported partner. Volunteers with high incidence were successfully identified and enrolled into large scale cohort studies. Over a quarter of new cases in couples acquired infection from persons other than the suspected transmitting partner.

The aim of this study was to investigate STD patterns and HIV prevalence among male STD clinic attendees in different areas in China and the associated risk factors. The feasibility of Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) was evaluated as well. A cross-sectional study was conducted at 46 public STD clinics in 4 provinces in China. Between July 2009 and September 2009, a total of 3243 eligible subjects were invited to participate in an interview with a structured-questionnaire for collecting socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behavioral information. They also were asked to provide venous blood samples for serological determinations of HIV and syphilis infection, and first void urine specimens for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections, Out of the 3243 eligible patients, 2951(91%) men agreed to take part in the HIV and syphilis testing. The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection was 0.7% while the rates of syphilis, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis infections were 10.7%, 4.3% and 6.9%, respectively, with the highest syphilis and N. gonorrhoeae rates in Jiangsu Province. Patients from Guangxi province, homosexual/bisexual practices and intravenous drug use were significantly associated with HIV infection in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) was well accepted by attendees, with 91% of eligible attendees agreeing to undergo HIV testing and counseling. All HIV positive patients were properly managed accordingly. A modest prevalence of HIV infection and substantial prevalence of other STD infections were found among male patients attending public STD clinics in China. The findings further support the introduction of HIV and syphilis PITC\n\nClinical Manifestations and the Natural History of HIV Infection in Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPiot, Peter; Colebunders, Robert\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe clinical expression of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) appears increasingly complex. It includes manifestations due to opportunistic diseases, as well as illness directly caused by HIV itself. Neurologic disease may include involvement of the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves and is probably directly caused by HIV, as is lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. The etiology of the chronic diarrhea and a papular pruritic skin eruption associated with HIV infection is unclear. Between 2% and 8% of HIV-infected persons progress to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) per year, with no apparent decrease in the rate of disease progression over time. A chronically activated state secondary to chronic microbial antigenic exposure may increase both the susceptibility to HIV infection and development of disease. Increased HIV gene expression, followed by persistent antigenemia, appear to be triggering factors in clinical deterioration. The role, if any, of environmental and/or genetic cofactors remains unclear.

Data were obtained through the linkage of two separate studies: the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study (UK CHIC), a cohort of adults attending 13 large HIV clinics; and the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC), a national surveillance study of HIV-positive pregnant women. Pregnancy incidence was measured using the proportion of women in UK CHIC with a pregnancy reported to NSHPC. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify predictors of pregnancy and assess changes in pregnancy incidence in 2000-2009.

Older women were less likely to have a pregnancy [adjusted relative rate (aRR) 0.44 per 10 year increment in age, [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.41-0.46)], P < 0.001] as were women with CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/Î¼l compared with CD4 cell count 200-350 cells/Î¼l [aRR 0.65 (0.55-0.77), P < 0.001] and women of white ethnicity compared with women of black African ethnicity [aRR 0.67 (0.57-0.80), Pâ< 0.001]. The likelihood that women had a pregnancy increased over the study period [aRR 1.05 (1.03-1.07), P < 0.001). The rate of change did not significantly differ according to age group, antiretroviral therapy use, CD4 group or ethnicity. The pregnancy rate among women accessing HIV clinical care increased in 2000-2009. HIV-positive women with, or planning, a pregnancy require a high level of care and this is likely to continue and increase as more women of older age have pregnancies.\n\nHIV Prevention Counseling Intervention Delivered During Routine Clinical Care Reduces HIV Risk Behavior in HIV-Infected South Africans Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy: The Izindlela Zokuphila/Options for Health Randomized Trial\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFisher, Jeffrey D.; Cornman, Deborah H.; Shuper, Paul A.; Christie, Sarah; Pillay, Sandy; Macdonald, Susan; Ngcobo, Ntombenhle; Amico, K. Rivet; Lalloo, Umesh; Friedland, Gerald; Fisher, William A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nContext Sustainable interventions are needed to minimize HIV risk behavior among people living with HIV (PLWH) in South Africa on antiretroviral therapy (ART), a significant proportion of whom do not achieve viral suppression. Objective To determine whether a brief lay counselor delivered intervention implemented during routine care can reduce risky sex among PLWH on ART. Design Cluster randomized 16 HIV clinical care sites in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, to intervention or standard-of-care. Setting Publicly funded HIV clinical care sites. Patients 1891 PLWH on ART received the HIV prevention counseling intervention (n = 967) or standard-of-care counseling (n = 924). Intervention Lay counselors delivered a brief intervention using motivational interviewing strategies based on the InformationâMotivationâBehavioral Skills (IMB) model during routine clinical care. Main Outcome Measures Number of sexual events without a condom in the past four weeks with partners of any HIV status, and with partners perceived to be HIV-negative or HIV-status unknown, assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results Intervention participants reported significantly greater reductions in HIV risk behavior on both primary outcomes, compared to standard-of-care participants. Differences in STI incidence between arms were not observed. Conclusion Effective behavioral interventions, delivered by lay counselors within the clinical care setting, are consistent with the strategy of linking HIV care and HIV prevention and integrating biomedical and behavioral approaches to stemming the HIV epidemic.

We describe the temporal trends in the demographic and clinical characteristics of HIV-positive patients initiating ART in 2003-13 within an Asian regional cohort. All HIV-positive adult patients that initiated ART between 2003 and 2013 were included. We summarized ART regimen use, age, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, and HIV-related laboratory monitoring rates during follow-up by calendar year. A total of 16 962 patients were included in the analysis. Patients in active follow-up increased from 695 patients at four sites in 2003 to 11,137 patients at eight sites in 2013. The proportion of patients receiving their second or third ART regimen increased over time (5% in 2003 to 29% in 2013) along with patients aged â¥50 years (8% in 2003 to 18% in 2013). Concurrently, CD4 monitoring has remained stable in recent years, whereas HIV viral load monitoring, although varied among the sites, is increasing. There have been substantial changes in the clinical and demographic characteristics of HIV-positive patients receiving ART in Asia. HIV programmes will need to anticipate the clinical care needs for their aging populations, expanded viral load monitoring, and, the eventual increase in second and third ART regimens that will lead to higher costs and more complex drug procurement needs.\n\nAttitudes and beliefs regarding depression, HIV/AIDS and HIV risk-related sexual behaviors among clinically depressed African American adolescent females\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrawner, Bridgette M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIndividualsâ attitudes and beliefs toward behaviors are key indicators of behavioral performance. The purpose of this study was to elucidate attitudes and beliefs about depression, HIV/AIDS and HIV risk-related sexual behaviors among clinically depressed African American adolescent females and to develop an understanding of their context for HIV risk. For this descriptive qualitative inquiry, semi-structured interviews and surveys were employed (N = 24). The narratives reveal that behavioral sequelae of depression (i.e. loneliness) can produce risk for HIV. These findings may guide psychiatric nurse educators, scientists, and practitioners to modify HIV risk among clinically depressed African American adolescent females.

The HCV treatment outcomes and barriers to HCV referral were examined in a centre with a HIV/HCV co-infection clinic. Patients who were antibody positive for both HIV and HCV between 1987 and January 2009 were identified. A retrospective chart review was undertaken. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess predictors of HCV clinic referral. Data were collected on 386 HIV/HCV patients; 202/386 had been referred to the co-infection clinic and 107/202 had HCV treatment. In addition, 29/202 were undergoing pretreatment work-up. Overall sustained virologic response (SVR) was 44%; SVR was equivalent in those who acquired HIV/HCV infection from intravenous drug use (IDU) and others. On multivariate analysis, patients who missed appointments, were younger, with active IDU and advanced HIV and who were not offered HCV treatment were less likely to be referred to the clinic. Patients attending the clinic were more likely to have been screened for hepatocellular carcinoma than those attending the general HIV service. Two-thirds of patients referred to the clinic had engaged with the HCV treatment programme. Dedicated co-infection clinics lower the threshold for treatment and improve management of liver disease in co-infected patients.\n\nHIV coreceptor phenotyping in the clinical setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nLow, Andrew J; Swenson, Luke C; Harrigan, P Richard\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe introduction of CCR5 antagonists increases the options available for constructing antiretroviral regimens. However, this option is coupled with the caveat that patients should be tested for HIV coreceptor tropism prior to initiating CCR5 antagonist-based therapy. Failure to screen for CXCR4 usage increases the risk of using an ineffective drug, thus reducing the likelihood of viral suppression and increasing their risk for developing antiretroviral resistance. This review discusses current and future methods of determining HIV tropism, with a focus on their utility in the clinical setting for screening purposes. Some of these methods include recombinant phenotypic tests, such as the Monogram Trofile assay, as well as genotype-based predictors, heteroduplex tracking assays, and flow cytometry based methods. Currently, the best evidence supports the use of phenotypic methods, although other methods of screening for HIV coreceptor usage prior to the administration of CCR5 antagonists may reduce costs and increase turnaround time over phenotypic methods. The presence of low levels of X4 virus is a challenge to all assay methods, resulting in reduced sensitivity in clinical, patient-derived samples when compared to clonally derived samples. Gaining a better understanding of the output of these assays and correlating them with clinical progression and therapy response will provide some indication on how both genotype-based, and phenotypic assays for determining HIV coreceptor usage can be improved. In addition, leveraging new technologies capable of detecting low-level minority species may provide the most significant advances in ensuring that individuals with low levels of dual/mixed tropic virus are not inadvertently prescribed CCR5 antagonists.\n\nReligion, Spirituality, and HIV Clinical Outcomes: A Systematic Review of the Literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoolittle, B R; Justice, A C; Fiellin, D A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis systematic review evaluates the association between religion, spirituality and clinical outcomes in HIV-infected individuals. A systematic literature review was conducted for all English language articles published between 1980 and 2016 in relevant databases. Six hundred fourteen studies were evaluated. 15 met inclusion criteria. Ten (67%) studies reported a positive association between religion or spirituality and a clinical HIV outcome. Two (13%) studies failed to detect such an association; and two (13%) demonstrated a negative association. One study (7%) identified features of religiosity and spirituality that had both negative and positive associations with HIV clinical outcomes. Recognizing the religious or spiritual commitments of patients may serve as an important component of patient care. Further longitudinal studies and interventions might be required to further clarify the potential impact of religion and spirituality on HIV clinical outcomes.\n\nHIV/STD pattern and its associated risk factors among male STD clinic attendees in China: a foci for HIV intervention\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Previous studies suggested a high prevalence of STDs including HIV among female sex workers and men who have sex with men in China, but little was known about the prevalence in male patients attending public STD clinics. The aim of this study was to investigate STD patterns and HIV prevalence among male STD clinic attendees in different areas in China and the associated risk factors. The feasibility of Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) was evaluated as well. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at 46 public STD clinics in 4 provinces in China. Between July 2009 and September 2009, a total of 3243 eligible subjects were invited to participate in an interview with a structured-questionnaire for collecting socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behavioral information. They also were asked to provide venous blood samples for serological determinations of HIV and syphilis infection, and first void urine specimens for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections, Results Out of the 3243 eligible patients, 2951(91%) men agreed to take part in the HIV and syphilis testing. The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection was 0.7% while the rates of syphilis, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis infections were 10.7%, 4.3% and 6.9%, respectively, with the highest syphilis and N. gonorrhoeae rates in Jiangsu Province. Patients from Guangxi province, homosexual/bisexual practices and intravenous drug use were significantly associated with HIV infection in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) was well accepted by attendees, with 91% of eligible attendees agreeing to undergo HIV testing and counseling. All HIV positive patients were properly managed accordingly. Conclusions A modest prevalence of HIV infection and substantial prevalence of other STD infections were found among male patients attending public STD clinics in China. The findings further support the\n\nHIV-1 Genetic Variability in Cuba and Implications for Transmission and Clinical Progression.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlanco, Madeline; Machado, Liuber Y; DÃ­az, HÃ©ctor; Ruiz, Nancy; Romay, Dania; Silva, Eladio\n\n2015-10-01\n\nINTRODUCTION Serological and molecular HIV-1 studies in Cuba have shown very low prevalence of seropositivity, but an increasing genetic diversity attributable to introduction of many HIV-1 variants from different areas, exchange of such variants among HIV-positive people with several coinciding routes of infection and other epidemiologic risk factors in the seropositive population. The high HIV-1 genetic variability observed in Cuba has possible implications for transmission and clinical progression. OBJECTIVE Study genetic variability for the HIV-1 env, gag and pol structural genes in Cuba; determine the prevalence of B and non-B subtypes according to epidemiologic and behavioral variables and determine whether a relationship exists between genetic variability and transmissibility, and between genetic variability and clinical disease progression in people living with HIV/AIDS. METHODS Using two molecular assays (heteroduplex mobility assay and nucleic acid sequencing), structural genes were characterized in 590 people with HIV-1 (480 men and 110 women), accounting for 3.4% of seropositive individuals in Cuba as of December 31, 2013. Nonrandom sampling, proportional to HIV prevalence by province, was conducted. Relationships between molecular results and viral factors, host characteristics, and patients' clinical, epidemiologic and behavioral variables were studied for molecular epidemiology, transmission, and progression analyses. RESULTS Molecular analysis of the three HIV-1 structural genes classified 297 samples as subtype B (50.3%), 269 as non-B subtypes (45.6%) and 24 were not typeable. Subtype B prevailed overall and in men, mainly in those who have sex with men. Non-B subtypes were prevalent in women and heterosexual men, showing multiple circulating variants and recombinant forms. Sexual transmission was the predominant form of infection for all. B and non-B subtypes were encountered throughout Cuba. No association was found between subtypes and\n\nCorrelation between HIV-1 genotype and clinical progression in HIV/AIDS patients in Surabaya, Indonesia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRachman, B. E.; Khairunisa, S. Q.; Witaningrum, A. M.; Yunifiar, M. Q.; Nasronudin\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSeveral factors such as host and viral factors can affect the progression of HIV/AIDS. This study aims to identify the correlation viral factors, especially the HIV-1 subtype with HIV/AIDS progression. Inpatient HIV/AIDS during the period March to September 2017 and willing to participate are included in the study. Historical data of disease and treatment was taken by medical record. Blood samples were amplified, sequenced and undergone phylogenetic analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate beta coefficient (Î²) and 95%CI of HIV/AIDS progression (measured by the CD4 change rate, ÎCD4 cell count/time span in months).This study has 17 samples. The HIV-1 subtype was dominated by CRF01_AE (81.8%) followed by subtype B (18.2%). There was significant correlation between subtype HIV-1 (p = 0.04) and body mass index (p = 0.038) with HIV/AIDS clinical stage. Many factors were assumed to be correlated with increased rate of CD4, but we only subtype HIV-1 had a significant correlation (p = 0.024) with it. From multivariate analysis, we also found that subtype HIV-1 had a significant correlation (Î² = 0.788, 95%CI: 17.5-38.6, p = 0.004).\n\nImmunization costs and programmatic barriers at an urban HIV clinic.\n\nPubMed\n\nEaton, Ellen F; Kulczycki, Andrzej; Saag, Michael; Mugavero, Michael; Raper, James L\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAlthough the increasing number of recommended immunizations is essential for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the potentially uncompensated costs of expanded immunizations will present significant challenges for clinics and health systems serving HIV-infected patients. We estimated costs of providing Gardasil, Prevnar, and Zostavax to eligible patients at a US Ryan White Part C academically affiliated HIV clinic in 2013. Clinic expenditures were calculated using vaccine price and administrative fees. Revenue was calculated using insurance reimbursement data for vaccination and administration. Three scenarios were used: 100% uptake of vaccines, adjusted uptake based on published rates, and adjusted reimbursement according to pre-Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance status. 2887 patients (27% Medicare, 13% Alabama Medicaid, 26% Commercial, 34% Uninsured), received care with wide variation in immunization reimbursement ($0 to $210) by insurance and vaccine. The net yield (revenue minus expenditure) was calculated for each vaccine. Prevnar was most costly: annual net yield of -$60 691. Provision of all 3 vaccines would lead to a net yield of -$97 122. Adjusting for reduced uptake led to annual clinic losses of $44 119. Using pre-ACA reimbursement for immunization of the uninsured led to reduced clinic losses (-$62 326), attributable to reimbursement via Ryan White funds. A cost analysis of 3 vaccines shows great variation in insurance coverage, with potential losses of almost $100 000 for one HIV clinic if eligible patients received vaccinations in one calendar year. Adequate, cost neutral reimbursement should be instituted if medical providers and health systems are to achieve Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices immunization recommendations for both HIV positive and negative adults.

We investigate clinical and immunological parameters in coinfected DENV/HIV patients. According to the new dengue classification, most coinfected DENV/HIV patients presented mild clinical manifestations of dengue infection. Herein, we show that DENV/HIV coinfected patients had higher CD8 T cells percentages reflected as a lower CD4/CD8 ratio. Furthermore, CCR5 expression on CD4 T cells and CD107a expression on both T subsets were significantly higher in coinfected patients when compared with monoinfected DENV and HIV individuals respectively. Increased inflammatory response was observed in treated HAART coinfected patients despite undetectable HIV load. These data indicate that DENV infection may influence the clinical profile and immune response in individuals concomitantly infected with HIV. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The Clinical Surveillance of HIV Disease (ClinSurv HIV) project was established in 1999 as a collaboration between major HIV treatment centres in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The project contributes to national HIV surveillance and focuses on the changing epidemiology of HIV/AIDS after the introduction of new therapies in 1995. ClinSurv HIV is designed as an open multicentre observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients. Anonymized data on diagnoses, treatment and laboratory parameters are collected in a standardized format. Data are currently sampled biannually via 11 centres specializing in HIV diagnosis and care within the legal framework of the German Protection against Infection Act [Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG)]. A total of 14874 patients were enrolled in the study by 30 June 2009. Of these, 10221 patients (68.7%) were enrolled after 1 January 1999 and 6006 patients (40.4%) were known to have been diagnosed as positive for HIV before 1999. Evaluation indicators, such as the number of newly enrolled patients per half-year period, loss to follow-up, completeness of data per case, availability of data per possible clinical contact, and internal quality control parameters, show a very stable evolution in the cohort, which although open, can be observed. Comparison with the national HIV surveillance data suggests a high degree of representativeness according to major demographic variables. Bearing in mind the obvious strengths and weaknesses discussed, the German ClinSurv HIV cohort provides a broad range of research opportunities in the field of HIV/AIDS both within Germany and in international collaborative research.\n\nImpact of a Routine, Opt-Out HIV Testing Program on HIV Testing and Case Detection in North Carolina Sexually-Transmitted Disease Clinics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlein, Pamela W.; Messer, Lynne C.; Myers, Evan R.; Weber, David J.; Leone, Peter A.; Miller, William C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe impact of routine, opt-out HIV testing programs in clinical settings is inconclusive. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of an expanded, routine HIV testing program in North Carolina sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics on HIV testing and case detection. Adults aged 18â64 who received an HIV test in a North Carolina STD clinic July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2011 were included in this analysis, dichotomized at the date of implementation on November 1, 2007. HIV testing and case detection counts and rates were analyzed using interrupted time series analysis, and Poisson and multilevel logistic regression. Pre-intervention, 426 new HIV-infected cases were identified from 128,029 tests (0.33%), whereas 816 new HIV-infected cases were found from 274,745 tests post-intervention (0.30%). Pre-intervention, HIV testing increased by 55 tests per month (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41, 72), but only 34 tests per month (95% CI: 26, 42) post-intervention. Increases in HIV testing rates were most pronounced in females and non-Hispanic whites. A slight pre-intervention decline in case detection was mitigated by the intervention (mean difference [MD]=0.01; 95% CI: â0.02, 0.05). Increases in case detection rates were observed among females and non-Hispanic blacks. The impact of a routine HIV screening in North Carolina STD clinics was marginal, with the greatest benefit among persons not traditionally targeted for HIV testing. The use of a pre-intervention comparison period identified important temporal trends that otherwise would have been ignored.

Data from 946 African American and 535 Caucasian patients receiving HIV care at the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinic between January 1, 1999, and August 1, 2012, were used to estimate the association between African American race and HIV virological suppression (i.e., undetectable HIV-1 RNA) when racial disparities in clinic attendance were lessened. Clinic attendance was measured as the proportion of scheduled clinic appointments attended (i.e., visit adherence) or the proportion of six 4-month intervals with at least 1 attended scheduled clinic appointment (i.e., visit constancy). In analyses accounting for patient characteristics, the risk ratio for achieving suppression when comparing African Americans with Caucasians was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.85, 0.98). Lessening disparities in adherence or constancy lowered disparities in virological suppression by up to 44.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Interventions that lessen disparities in adherence may be more effective in eliminating disparities in suppression than interventions that lessen disparities in constancy. Given that gaps in care were limited to be no more than 2 years for both attendance measures, the impact of lessening disparities in adherence may be overstated. Â© The Author 2014.

As a result, similar to the current need for primary care providers to manage chronic noninfectious comorbidities among aging persons with well controlled HIV infection, HIV clinical care will need to routinely involve geriatric medicine in a new HIV-geriatric discipline. The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework in which HIV and geriatric management considerations for healthcare professionals caring for HIV+ persons are integrated. The provision of contemporary HIV clinical care extends well beyond the achievement of HIV virologic suppression and antiretroviral therapy management and includes a need for careful characterization of geriatric syndromes based upon functional capacity and extent of disability. Screening for geriatric syndromes is both a multidisciplinary and multidimensional process, designed to evaluate an older person's functional ability, physical health, cognition, overall mental health, and socio-environmental circumstances. Although routine incorporation of geriatric assessment into clinical trials involving HIV+ persons is feasible, a current challenge is the availability of a consensus clinical definition of frailty or vulnerability. To maximize the efficiency, value, and convenience of outpatient care visits for older HIV+ persons, these visits should include encounters with multiple providers, including primary care clinicians, social workers, and geriatricians. Challenges may exist in the routine provision of these assessments to older HIV+ persons, but clearly such cross-disciplinary collaboration will not only markedly enhance the care of aging HIV+ persons but may also constitute a model of successful healthcare management that can be applied to all aging persons with changing healthcare needs.\n\nThe cost of implementing rapid HIV testing in sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nEggman, Ashley A; Feaster, Daniel J; Leff, Jared A; Golden, Matthew R; Castellon, Pedro C; Gooden, Lauren; Matheson, Tim; Colfax, Grant N; Metsch, Lisa R; Schackman, Bruce R\n\n2014-09-01\n\nRapid HIV testing in high-risk populations can increase the number of persons who learn their HIV status and avoid spending clinic resources to locate persons identified as HIV infected. We determined the cost to sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics of point-of-care rapid HIV testing using data from 7 public clinics that participated in a randomized trial of rapid testing with and without brief patient-centered risk reduction counseling in 2010. Costs included counselor and trainer time, supplies, and clinic overhead. We applied national labor rates and test costs. We calculated median clinic start-up costs and mean cost per patient tested, and projected incremental annual costs of implementing universal rapid HIV testing compared with current testing practices. Criteria for offering rapid HIV testing and methods for delivering nonrapid test results varied among clinics before the trial. Rapid HIV testing cost an average of US $22/patient without brief risk reduction counseling and US $46/patient with counseling in these 7 clinics. Median start-up costs per clinic were US $1100 and US $16,100 without and with counseling, respectively. Estimated incremental annual costs per clinic of implementing universal rapid HIV testing varied by whether or not brief counseling is conducted and by current clinic testing practices, ranging from a savings of US $19,500 to a cost of US $40,700 without counseling and a cost of US $98,000 to US $153,900 with counseling. Universal rapid HIV testing in STD clinics with same-day results can be implemented at relatively low cost to STD clinics, if brief risk reduction counseling is not offered.\n\nConceptual framework for behavioral and social science in HIV vaccine clinical research\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLau, Chuen-Yen; Swann, Edith M.; Singh, Sagri; Kafaar, Zuhayr; Meissner, Helen I.; Stansbury, James P.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHIV vaccine clinical research occurs within a context where biomedical science and social issues are interlinked. Previous HIV vaccine research has considered behavioral and social issues, but often treated them as independent of clinical research processes. Systematic attention to the intersection of behavioral and social issues within a defined clinical research framework is needed to address gaps, such as those related to participation in trials, completion of trials, and the overall research experience. Rigorous attention to these issues at project inception can inform trial design and conduct by matching research approaches to the context in which trials are to be conducted. Conducting behavioral and social sciences research concurrent with vaccine clinical research is important because it can help identify potential barriers to trial implementation, as well as ultimate acceptance and dissemination of trial results. We therefore propose a conceptual framework for behavioral and social science in HIV vaccine clinical research and use examples from the behavioral and social science literature to demonstrate how the model can facilitate identification of significant areas meriting additional exploration.

HAND was present in 23.5% of the sample and was associated with older age, a low educational level among those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse among those with many months since diagnosis. These results suggest that HAND is common among patients in South Africa, and is associated with clinical variables such as PTSD and alcohol abuse.
