        "text": "This paper is an attempt to analyze the official development assistance effectiveness in Mali. Mali is one of the world’s poorest nations, ranking 182 out of 186 according to Human Development Index (HDI) 2013, a country with limited natural resources. The paper does not only evaluate the efficacy of official development effectiveness but also an endeavor to find out the ways to make the aids more effective and efficient in the Mali. Despite receiving an increasing amount of aid from the donor countries, the poverty rate in Mali has not been declining since 1960. So the paper attempts to highlight the weak areas of official development assistance and lastly it provides some constructive recommendations for the effectiveness of official development assistance.\n\nBy some measures, Mali’s economy has performed well over the last decade. It has respected most of the West African Economic and Monetary Union’s macroeconomic convergence criteria, was made eligible for the debt relief initiative for heavily indebted countries, and assessments by regional and international organisations highlight its fiscal prudence, appropriate economic policy choices and macroeconomic stability. Yet a closer look reveals additional patterns that have contributed to growing disparities, weak trust in government and public discontent. Mali’s positive economic growth in aggregate terms translates into slow per capita growth rates and Mali continues to rank as one of the world’s poorest countries. The economy’s heavy reliance on a few key sectors and persistent structural weaknesses have led to growing unemployment. The gradual reduction in the national poverty headcount measure conceals an increase in the absolute number of poor people and the persistence of poverty...\n\nThe project aimed to study a Non OECD nation and compare it with an Indian state. Mali a West African nation with a glorious past but precarious present was found to be very close to Indian state of Assam. Budget of Mali was studied to see the measures taken by government to boost its capacity in order to strengthen trade. The government of Mali had set following key priority:  The establishment of strong and credible institutions  The restoration of the safety of goods and persons throughout the nation  The implementation of an active policy of reconciliation  Reconstruction of the Malian school  The construction of an emerging economy  The implementation of an active policy of social development On the monetary policy front BCEAO (Central Bank of West African States) is taking care of Mali along with other 7 western African nations. On trade front, as Mali still focuses on primary sector and in spite of being part of C4 nations lack of technology has hampered its growth momentum. Its negative balance of payment also doesn’t augur any better condition for Mali in near future. Further, it was also seen that Assam, land locked and an agricultural economy like Mali is facing similar kind of challenges.\n\nThis report is an operational evaluation of the Saving for Change (SfC) program in Mali being implemented by Oxfam America, Freedom from Hunger, Plan Mali and the Stromme Foundation with local partners. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded this evaluation, which was prepared by the Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology (BARA), University of Arizona. This report focuses on the current functioning of Oxfam’s existing Saving for Change programs in Mali, specifically to provide the context on the mechanisms of group establishment, replication, and functioning. The study addresses four key areas of SfC operations in local contexts in Mali: (a) the SfC administrative structure, (b) functioning of savings, savings and lending groups (S&L), (c) household livelihood systems, and (d) perceptions of the impact of credit on livelihood systems. This study investigates the ways in which community members modify or vary the SfC model to meet local conditions and needs. It also seeks to characterize how SfCs have operated within the context of other local credit arrangements, including state programs, informal moneylenders, informal tontines (traditional rotating credit associations) and other NGO- funded microfinance projects.\n\n1. Purchase from Africans for Africa (PAA Africa) is a programme inspired by the lessons learned from Brazil’s Zero Hunger initiative, combining school feeding activities with institutional procurement from farmers’ organizations (FOs). It is currently being implemented in five African countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger and Senegal. In Senegal, the programme has been implemented in the Kédougou region since 2012. After a one-year pilot phase, the second phase, or consolidation phase, started in September 2013 and ended in July 2016. 2. On the one hand, this report seeks to report on business activities and to account for the outcomes achieved by the PAA Africa Senegal project. Second, it seeks to understand why some results have occurred and others have not. In addition, it draws information for the project extension phase which is supposed to begin in 2017, particularly with respect to coordination of the partnership and operational and strategic decision-making processes. 3. Numerous users are expected to make use of this evaluation report. The PAA Africa/World Food programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Coordination Units and their partners are the first recipients. The report will help to identify changes to the design and implementation of the programme and raise key issues to discuss with the Government of Senegal to enhance the relevance and effectiveness of the PAA Africa Senegal project’s extension phase. The Government of Senegal will be able to draw on valuable information collated during the Consolidation phase, both to complete the project extension phase successfully and to develop its autonomous national school feeding programme."
