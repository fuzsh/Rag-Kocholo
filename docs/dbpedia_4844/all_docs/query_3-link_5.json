        "text": "For other uses, see Diarra (disambiguation).\n\nDiarra is a French translation of the clan name Jara used in West Africa, as a hangover from the French colonial empire in that region. It originates from the Bambara language word jara, meaning lion,[1] synonymous with waraba.[2] The Kingdom of Diarra existed from the 7th Century until the 19th Century. The name is also frequently used with reference to the 18th to early 19th-century Bambara Empire in Ségou, Mali, which was ruled successively by Ngolo Diarra, his son Mansong (or Monzon) Diarra, and then his son Da Diarra.[3][4]\n\nThe clan name (or patronym[5]) Jara/Diarra is related to another clan name, Koné,[1] and is heard in many of the chronicles that have been handed down orally.[6] Both are frequently praised together in song, signifying bravery and fearlessness.[1][7]\n\nThe name Diarra, now a surname, is traditionally found mostly in Mali, but also Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Senegal. Today, it has also spread around the world, notably in France and Spain.[8] Today, it is also used as a given name.\n\nDiarra may refer to:\n\nSurname\n\n[edit]\n\nAbdel Diarra (full name Abdel Rahamane Diarra Khalil;
