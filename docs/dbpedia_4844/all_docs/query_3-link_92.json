I will try to kill their scam business. Now, they have moved to Kenya.\n\nIt is a much better place for them. There are more organized scam groups there, and they can make more variety stories.\n\nThey bring more sources, such as DRC gold, Uganda gold, UN diplomatic bags, embassy lines, Corrupted politician stories, etc.\n\nI do not understand why the Kenyan government let the scammers. They can even record the line and trace curious companies' money transfers.\n\nI sent the scammer to prison, but he returned one month later. That is why I gave up African business. There is no meaning to the law to the scammers.\n\nI was the fund manager and tried to retrieve the gold. Finally, it was failed. There was no gold from the beginning.\n\nThere were only ghosts there. Please go to a trustworthy country if you would like to buy gold.\n\nAnd do not ask for delivery orders like pizza. Nobody gives you gold on credit.\n\nThe seller treats you as bull shit and time waster. That is my advice.1. After I paid and got scammed by GGDO office\n\n2. I got scammed by\n\ncolonel Atland francis\n\n+232 76 139699 email colonelfrancisaltandconte@gmail.com\n\ncolonelfrancisaltandconte@gmail.com\n\n3.

Ibrahim's security team 5 persons got mad complaint\n\nto the police and all went down to police station,\n\nto settle the dispute,\n\nthat the IBRAHIM gold Avalon company wanted their\n\ntwo kilos back because this exporter was not processing the\n\ntwo kilos I PAID FOR TO DO.\n\nAt the police station, the police told Ibrahim people\n\nthat police cannot order the license exporter to give back the two\n\nkilos because the security team was not the owners of the gold.\n\nso they all left the police station,\n\nnothing done and\n\nafter a few months Ibrahim said he got back the two kilos\n\nthat were NOT PROCESSED.\n\n5. i PAID THE FIRST $800.00 FOR FRANCIS TO STAY HOTEL\n\nWHICH HE FIRST TOLD ME was $200 dollars,\n\nbut ended up first week $800.00\n\n6. New few weeks Francis wanted hotel bill $1800\n\nI refuse to pay because I told him go home, exporter does not need\n\nyou, so go home,\n\nfrancis refuse to go home and ran up another $1800 hotel food bill\n\ni refuse to pay the second hotel bill, I paid the first hotel bill but not the second\n\nbecause he refused to go home and just ran up the big hotel bill.\n\n7. The license exporter friend of Francis refuse to process the 2 kilos unless\n\ni paid the OUT OF CONTROL HOTEL FOOD BILL FRANCIS KEPT RUNNING UP,\n\n8.

Whereas there are many scams, especially in mineral dealings, gold has been poised to be the target mineral for scammers. You have probably come across articles where a foreign couple were robbed over KES 13.5 million in a fake gold scam, or where a mastermind of a KES 12 billion gold scam syndicate was arrested in Nairobi, or eight Kenyans and two foreigners arraigned over KES 19.8 million fake gold scam and many more. This article will delve into some common traits of gold scams in Kenya.\n\n1. Foreign Nationals are Most Susceptible\n\nMost foreigners are unfamiliar with the local customs, laws, and market prices for gold in Kenya. This lack of knowledge can make them more vulnerable to scams. These foreigners might strongly desire to purchase gold as souvenirs or an investment opportunity in Kenya. This eagerness sometimes blinds their eyes to potential red flags or scam warning signs. Furthermore, foreigners might trust sellers based on recommendations without conducting thorough research, assuming goodwill that might not exist.\n\n2. Fake Documentation and Identities\n\nScammers present counterfeit documents, such as mineral dealers' licences, export permits, KRA clearance certificates, and shipping documents, among others. Fake lab reports showing the quality of gold are sent to victims through multiple avenues to convince them to get involved in the business. Some scammers use untraceable contacts and do not provide detailed personal information, complicating issues for victims to verify the deal's legitimacy.\n\n3. Unrealistic Quantities and Returns\n\nScammers promise large quantities of gold that cannot be found in Kenya. For instance, a victim is being promised one tonne of gold at once at favourable prices. Kenya exports less than 500 kg of gold every year. So, this begs the question, where does the seller get one tonne of Gold? Victims are promised high quality of gold of about 24 carats, with high and quick returns on investments without much struggle or negligible risk. If a deal seems to be too good, it probably is.\n\n4. Gold on Transit\n\nWhen the seller does buy in the idea of unrealistic gold quantities, fraudsters always claim gold is coming from another country, such as Congo, and is in transit in Kenya. While this is a legal way of doing business, gold scammers will let the buyer know that the gold has departed from the country of origin but has been held up by customs officials in Kenya. At this point, the fraudster asks for money to help 'clear' the gold. They use high-pressure tactics to push victims to pay for such payments without proper due diligence. Scammers always claim that such opportunities are limited or that instant or immediate action is needed. Victims end up losing their money without seeing any gold.\n\n5. Upfront Payments\n\nScammers may ask victims to pay upfront fees for numerous reasons, such as payouts for KRA officials, security guarantees, shipping, insurance, or administrative costs. Typically, legitimate transactions do not require such upfront payments. Some scammers often propose complex financial or payment arrangements that confuse victims, and they end up paying advance fees to scammers. By the end of the day, the scammers are just interested in the upfront payments.6. Collusion with Corrupt Individuals\n\nScammers may collude with compromised customs officials and other multiagency officials tasked with inspecting, verifying, and authorizing gold dealings. The collusion also involves high-profile people in the political scene to hasten and sweeten the fake deals. This collusion can be linked to fake documents since scammers are guaranteed surety of protection and are attractive to victims.\n\n7. Fake or no Lab Testing Reports\n\nGold is a precious commodity, and its prices depend on its quality. So, before gold is sold, its quantity and quality must be known through testing by the State Department for Mining or reputable firms. Unfortunately, scammers may alter the lab testing report to fake the quality of gold to entice victims to get involved. Where the buyer is not aware of lab reports, the scammers do not bring up the need for lab report\n\n8. Lack of Physical Presence\n\nScammers, especially non-Kenyan citizens, prefer to operate remotely to avoid detection by the authorities. They are reluctant to meet their victims in person. In most cases, they may refuse all site inspections by providing various and justifiable excuses for why on-site inspections cannot be done. Investors should be suspicious when sellers or brokers are unwilling to meet in person. Ordinarily, legitimate sellers allow potential buyers to inspect gold in person to ascertain quantity and quality.\n\n9. Off-Market Gold Offers\n\nFraudsters use all tricks to get money. They claim that the gold offered is \"off-market\" and probably cheaper. They convince victims that such gold is not part of the regular market routes and cannot be sanctioned or impounded by security agencies. Victims fall to this trick due to nice deals with better returns.\n\n10. Shortcuts\n\nIndividuals or companies involved in mineral dealings in Kenya are unaware of the standard procedures approved by the State Department for Mining and other government agencies. Most fall victims because of shortcuts shown to them by scammers. Buyers and sellers, unfortunately, do not want to follow standard procedures in dealing with gold and end up suffering at the hands of ruthless scammers.\n\n11. Fraudulent Buyers and Sellers\n\nScammers are not only sellers but also buyers, not leaving behind brokers in the industry. Fake buyers disappear with gold without paying the dealers without a trace, while fake sellers sell phony gold or disappear with their client's money.\n\nConducting thorough due diligence, seeking professional advice on mineral dealings, and being sceptical of deals that seem too good to be true are essential. Consulting with field experts, inspectors of mines, and recognized mining consultants, verifying information through strategic government agencies and using reputable and approved channels for transactions to reduce the risk of falling victim to gold scams.\n\nIn our next article, we will discuss how you can protect yourself from these scams and consequently avoid losing your hard-earned money.Gold Scammer from Nairobi Kenya.\n\nNAME> Nashon Otieno Akutha.\n\nSERIAL GOLD SCAMMER BACK IN LOCK-UP DAYS AFTER RELEASE ON BOND\n\nNashon Otieno Angudha, a key suspect in a series of frauds affecting local\n\nand foreign gold merchants has today been arraigned at Milimani Law Courts,\n\nafter he was arrested Tuesday evening for obtaining Sh35 million from a businessman in a fake gold scam.\n\nIn the fraudulent scheme orchestrated on diverse dates between July 13 and October 18, 2023, the 28-year-old is\n\naccused of swindling the victim out of the millions by luring him to a\n\npurchase and export deal of 100kg of gold to Dubai, the amount being fees\n\nfor transportation and insurance.\n\nAfter parting with the money which was paid in US dollars ($250,000), nine gold bars given to the victim as\n\ncollateral were subjected to a test at the Ministry of Mining, but none of them exhibited even a trace of gold element.\n\nNashon then holed up leaving the businessman devastated and poorer, thereby seeking the intervention of law enforcers. Acting on intelligence,\n\nthe Operation Support Unit (OSU) detectives conducted a stealth operation at Crystal Spring Apartments in Lavington, Nairobi, managing to net the suspect\n\nwhile in his KDM 523Q Toyota Prado. Crucial exhibits including radio sets and\n\ncheque books were seized from the vehicle.\n\nNashon was today arraigned at court no. 5 charged with conspiracy to commit a felony and obtaining money by false pretenses.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to both charges and has been remanded until Friday, 12th April, 2024 when bond determination will be made.\n\nThe objection to release him on bond by the prosecution followed Nashon's criminal record, noting that he is implicated in a robbery with violence\n\ncase at the Kibera court no. 5, for jointly with his two accomplices robbing a foreign couple over USD90,000 when they jetted the country for a gold business.\n\nIn the October 28, 2023 case, Nashon Otieno, Jack Ouma Okwiri and Felix Ochieng' Nyongesa lured an Australian man\n\nand his Ugandan wife to an office setup in the Runda suburbs, before turning against the couple.\n\nThe man had been beaten up and the wife sexually assaulted, before the gang robbed and dumped them at Rehema House in Nairobi CBD.\n\nAfter days of relentless manhunt, the three were arrested at the Social House Nairobi Hotel in Lavington area and arraigned at Kibera Law Courts on November 9, 2023 charged with robbery with violence.\n\nThey were released on a Sh1M bond with an alternative of Sh300,000 cash bailI am writing to bring to your attention a matter of significant concern to me. As an aged Italian nationalist residing in Poland, there is an issue that I need to address with all due concerns. I have become a victim of a suspicious transaction and would like to report it. There is an individual named Alex Sserwanga (+256 700 385063) whom I met in Uganda back in March 2023. Unfortunately, upon returning to Poland, this person has persistently been harassing me. They have been pressuring me to accept a gold shipment of 2kilogram from Uganda to Poland through an air freight service called \"Cargo Africa\". Initially, all payments were made through ‚ÄúWestern Union‚Äù the delivery costs were quoted at $680 US, but I have already paid over $20,000 USD without receiving the consignment.\n\nDespite being reassured that all the legal documents and registrations were legitimate (which I strongly believe now, were fake and manipulated through Photoshop), Despite provided the necessary documents as proof of legitimate shipment, the promised shipment has not arrived as expected. I have correctly carried out payment transactions via Western Union from Poland to various individuals in Uganda. Some of these individuals have assumed roles such as diplomats, city authorities in mining areas, and former military officials. All communication was conducted via WhatsApp and I, on my own initiative, preserved a copy of our messages with a certain Mr. James, who did not disclose his full name at Cargoafri.com (+256 780 341522) and ‚Ä™(+971 52 678 1725‚Ä¨).\n\nI urgently request your attention and assistance in this matter. I am deeply concerned about potential fraudulent activity and aim to prevent further harm. I firmly believe that this issue extends beyond just myself, indicating that we are dealing with a well-organized group of scammers who could accurately be termed as an \"organized crime\" entity.\n\nKindest regards,Good day to you all,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention a gold scammer operating out of Zambia and Tanzania. I believe you might have heard of him since one of his email addresses showed up on your website.\n\nHe calls himself Fred and was actually referred to me by a LinkedIn connect \"Busingye Samu - +256 771 648400\"\n\nI had inquired about purchasing copper cathodes and Mr. Samu suggested I try his friend, Mr. Fred.\n\nMr. Fred shared with me a number of his products ranging from cash crops to metals. He promised he could supply various coffee, cashew, Gold and copper ore. Since my interest was only for copper ore, copper concentrate and copper cathodes, we discussed about that he gave me the contacts of three companies that he owned, two in Tanzania and one in Zambia.\n\nOn preparing the contract, he began to ask intrusive questions. This was where I got suspecious. He asked questions about my bank and the account officer and their contact details, all these were unnecessary for the contract. He stated that the banks had to do a verification of my account before they can approve the contract, stating that it's a new regulation in Zambia. He also wanted payment terms to be SBLC or BG, also stating new banking regulation since the covid-19 outbreak.\n\nI, despite having nothing against him besides my suspicions, gave him false banking information and proceeded to investigate him. I discovered one of his email addresses was listed on this website as a gold Scammer, the other two had no record at all.\n\nI also discovered that non of his three companies had any information listed online, which is suspiciously low internet footprint for a multinational Gold seller.

They supposedly have a company in Sierre Leone. They convinced us they have 18kg available and cent us documents of there company and all the paperwork. They have already paid all the government taxes. All they needed was to get the customs clearance certificate and that will cost $5000 dollars.\n\nWe paid the taxes, also booked Mr Osman a ticket to fly to Dubai and bring the 18kg to us as agreed to our registered company in Dubai. Mr Osman flew Kenya airline and landed in Nairobi Thursday 25 February in transit and would land in dubai early morning 26 Friday 5h30. I still spoke to him after landed and wanted to know if I could send his wife $500 dollars cause she will need money his going to be in dubai for a week. Which I also sent as he hand landed and sent me pics from the airport and also when he left on the plane. We get a call from an customs official Saleh Salam.\n\nSomehow he was detained from customs official in Kenya because of the package his carrying and the paperwork was on his phone and didn‚Äôt have the originals with him.\n\nBut we can make this disappear if they get $5000 dollars.\n\nWe did some research and contacted customs and there was no one by that name that works there.\n\nThis was one of his friends or contacts that was in on the scam in Kenya.\n\nLucky we didn‚Äôt fall for the customs scam and paid another $5000 dollars.\n\nOsman Bayoh pretty much disappeared from the airport and exited into Kenya.\n\nOsman Bayoh +232 79 03 26 46\n\nRoy Macauley +232 77 40 42 15\n\nIn attachment i sent partially pictures of passports. I have more pictures and passport copies of all scammers connected to optim gold\n\nI came across to Optim Gold Staff in 2014 year. One their Kenyan partner Kayode Oyenuga contact me to them. I had good connections in Dubai and China. Had many buyers of gold. Starting from first dates Optim Gold refused to go through DD. With excuse that i'm not a buyer. I spoke with Deus Kakuru Charima and Nasser Kilimana Kibirige. in 2 years I tried to connect them to few buyers on Dubai. With many excuses they failed. Sometimes they vanished during negotiating with buyer or buyer representative. Few times when buyer or buyer representative went them directly. Optim Gold told that they are not know me. Tried to work with buyer directly. Mostly failing because of lack of prving of existence of product and lack of processing dd or bank instrument they planned to receive. When I demanded to speak with CEO. Deus and Nasser said that CEO is very high man so he cant be connected to intermediary like me. In 2016 year I came across with Stella Birungi Dindi. She said that she is working with big gold supplier. And again brought me back to Optim Gold. As i understood later in 2020. They are big syndicate and when victim stop working with them they try to bring him back through contacts with whom victim didnt spoke before.\n\nIn 2017 year I found contact of Farouk Wamala Kisuze. We started to speak directly. When I gave his contact to my buyers from Dubai who had office in Kampala. My connection with this buyers was be broken. When i questioned Farouk Wamala Kisuze he always told me that my buyers was not real and only intermediates. Buyers who still remained to speak with me told that Farouk dont have material in hand.\n\nNext story developed parallely to this story https://ugandaradionetwork.net/story/ubc-producer-testifies-in-makerere-gold-scam- and https://observer.ug/news/headlines/56589-5-arrested-at-makerere-over-200-000-gold-scam you can google it Makerere Gold Scam deal. Even if they are tried to delete articles about it it still have enough info to see what happened.\n\nIn november of 2017 Farouk Kisuze started to speak with me. Because in August 2017 i wrote to him that im about to get big Chinese Corporation. I spent about 2 years to build good partnership with this corporation. I betted big on this company because m plans was to be this company representative in Africa. Because they was in very need to get big gold and copper suppliers.\n\nWith farouk I started to send commercial offers to this company. Company was very interested. But Farouk vanished. He appeared only in february 2018. I googled all names of optim gold employees and found that Nasser is under investigation because he in group with Stella Birungi Dindi and other people scammed from Lebanese guy 200 000 usd. When I asked what happened From Farouk and does it connected to optim gold. He said that Stella is not employee of optim gold or southern minerals limited and Nasser from this case is not same Nasser from Optim Gold. I wasnot sure in this explanations. But in those times in articles of internet news Nasser surane didnt wrote correctly. In other hand chinese company demanded to start. Because they already put in government plans that they will buy products from africa and established export import division and company main purpose of which was been developing partnership with african suppliers.Then in last days of July Farouk vanished and Henry Ochong Ogutu appeared. He told that he is attorney of Optim Gold and he will manage everything. He said that Farouk busy to arrange all this gold for transaction. Henry demanded from buyer to book tickets in business class or first class for 4 people ( Farouk Kisuze. Adam Mugga. Nasser Kilimana. Henry Ochong Ogutu) both ways and book 5* hotel in HK. Then it was been promoted that they can supply copper cathode from Zambia. and brought 5th guy in team Muchemwa Sinkala\n\nChinese company booked 5* hotel 2 rooms with 2 beds and one room with one bed. For tickets it was regular tickets due to rules of company (They are government regulated so cant book tickets with high class) Henry demanded to book 5 rooms with 1 bed each. This is very important because by this it seems that they demanded to return money from bookings as much as they can.\n\nChinese company demanded to sign SPA for trial delivery to make this bookings and meeting official in their accounting. But Henry avoided to hear this. All this time Farouk was unreachable. I took another phone which he didnt know. Called him and when he picked phone I spoke with him. Described situation that we need any sort of contract or agreement to register it in ERP. To make chinese company team to go to HK. He advised me to concentrate on bringing chinese team in HK and he will speak with Henry. After that Henry started emotionally push me to not interfere in process. He knows whats going on and how to deal with it.\n\nAs a result I pushed Chinese team to go to HK without registering TTM in ERP. Up until the 1 day before departure Henry didnt provided any passports to book tickets. Only text names and wrong birth dates was been provided. Especially Adam Mugga didnt provided real birtdate till the end. Only when chinese told that they will not book tickets because its unreal. Henry provided them. Ticket for Adam Mugga was ben booked on wrong birtdate and wrong name. 2 days before ttm all chinese team gathered in HK and started to prepare for TTM. It was planned that optim gold will be accomodated like they are kings\n\nOn day of departure. Henry was n phone but half hour before departuring Optim Gold turned their phones off. Henry wrote email that shareholder of optim gold passed and they went on funerals. While I was in chaos. My team and chinese team in HK was in chaos too. Henry tried to return tickets and get money as we been informed by chinese booking service. But the tickets was not refundable. He even contacted hotel and tried to refund booking of rooms. It was not performable too. Because funds will be returned to chinese company account.\n\nWhile all this operations tried to perform Henry was on contact and made me and other people as much far as it possible away from seeing problem widely and promised that team will come after week and he will send someone to guarantee that Optim Gold delegation will come.\n\nNo one didnt appeared after week. All this time Henry tried to refund bookings as i was informed after month. I was busy on keeping chairman of chinese company and 20+ employees to wait Optim for about 40 days in HK. Because TTM was not been properly registered. Me and my team was responsible to cater all delegation. All this time Optim tried to refund tickets and rooms. It was fruitless because tickets is not refundabe after departure of plane and you cant refund rooms if you are not booked them.I lost too much time and money to keep people in HK. They was planned to be on vacation. some of them had work to be done in china. So they returned\n\nIn october Farouk contacted me and said that he is ready to fix everything and can come in HK at last days of october. He promised to pay tickets and accomodation by his own. From my side i was been responsible to bring chinese people again and push them on big quantities and new BG.\n\nAfter i gatheredmy team and chinese team in HK. Farouk again dissapeared. I hosted 20+ people in HK for 70+ days. Farouk didnt appeared. Nasser snoozed me each time that Farouk will appear. In november someone from Vietnam with name Tram Huynh contacted chinese company and asked where is farouk. He is owing her 5600usd for service. And she informed them that Farouk planned to monetize BG. It was big scandal which I cooled down. Then someone with name Dunia Subira came to us informing that she have gold in HK. When she came she asked some money to pay in customs. My team payed her money and then she dissapeared. it was so strange that someone has already known that we waiting in HK gold and we in trouble. Before new year Farouk turned on his phone called me and said that he will come before New Year. It was very hard to keep people in HK. But I kept them. Farouk then dissapered. When i started to google his name. I found article in monitor news site of uganda. That Farouk was under investigation starting from 20 october 2018 and all november and december he was in hiding. I kept people up to 16 January 2019. I had little hope because i was completely broke and praying that all this not real and this bastard will come and save the day\n\nIts short story. I can add some nuances (because my story was developed paralelly with other people and thisvanishings was because optim gold team scammed other people in uganda and around the world) and send additional passports and documentsGEOFFREY WESCOTT JAMES AKA GEOFF JAMES, CEO Veritas is a proven fraudster - stay well away!!!! His way or working is to offer high and rapid returns on a specific project - this is mainly gold or gold related. However, according to my searches on the internet, he used the same method with a property deal when his wife NANCY MAUREEN JAMES was also involved according to legal records When the original gold deal did not work out, he assured us that we would get our money back from other projects. We gave him thousands with an assurance and promissory note that this would be returned with a very high return within 7 weeks. That was 5 years ago and nothing bar a minuscule amount has been returned He will look very plausible - gold licenses, accounts with US, Ghanaian (AA) and Dubai refineries, references from personal contacts and even a UK MP But he will never honour his promissory notes or contracts He is American, from Denver and previously Seattle. He is apparently living in Niger, but spends a lot of his time in Guinea and Mali, where I have it on good local intelligence that he is 'living big'. He has properties in Conakry. He told me that he is also starting up a construction business in the US using the proceeds from his business in Africa. He travels back to the US regularly. Clearly, he has significant disposable income If you would like further details of his dealings please do not hesitate to send me a private message\n\nhis email is 9veritas88@gmail.com, greendiver9@mac.comThis group comprising of Paul Kobia and Steve Mbogo has been conning people for years and they enjoy a high level of immunity from law enforcement, a directive from the President himself.\n\nWhen we speak of scams in East Africa, we tend to focus on the scammers on the ground. However we overlook the real masterminds and support groups. For example, there are several low life characters that herd unsuspecting victims into the arms of the scammers. Some names come to mind like Phillip Bryant and Adegoke Adeyemi ( A nigerian) who uses the alias Steve Kent in the USA. There are also others like Joe Naidoo in South Africa and a \"Mike\" that uses a UK phone number. Even within East Africa, there are those who will draw you in and melt away upon your arrival \"on the ground\".\n\nRemember, a scam don't take place over night. It is well planned and executed and the methods are far removed from anything an unsuspecting and even savvy foreigner would even imagine. The system of \"paying taxes\" and taking gold out is a scam. If you fall for this flawed logic, you are finished. No matter what logic is presented or how much you try to convince yourself, it's not going to happen.\n\nWith the price of copper moving up, there will be an increase in the copper cathode scams as well. Electrolytically refined copper sells for about $160 over copper spot prices and this is the same all over the world. Chile is the largest producer of copper. Congo is number 5 and Zambia is number 8, yet people fall for the 25% discount from these two countries shipping copper through Dar Es salaam.\n\nMurth please email me at ryankritchko@gmail.comTrinity Logistics Cargo is a scam. Operated by a cartel with Hans Wagner, Paul Kobia, Ben Aziz Musafiri and Stve Mbogo in Nairobi Kenya, Kampala Uganda, Congo, UAE and Dar Es Salaam Tanzania.\n\nThey will tell you that they can export your Gold or other commodities like Copper and Tin but they have a lot of different companies under their umbrella to deceive their potential customers (mostly foreigners).\n\nAfter paying huge amounts for taxes and insurance in order to export the product (probably Gold or Copper) the excuses will start. Either they had some delays or problems with customs or they need extra money to prepare documents/documentation. Another story is that extra money is needed for storage (all of this done by one of their other companies as mentioned before.\n\nThey have a website and will even give you an Airway Bill. Problem is the Airwaybill is not an AirwayBill from the Airline but from their own companies which means it is useless. You can \"track\" the cargo on their website which is is a complete joke because all you want is the original Airwaybill to track your cargo. They will never give you the original Airway Bill because it is simply not there. Don't forget: They are not planning to send you your cargo, they plan to scam you !\n\nThey will offer you collateral which is useless as the collateral will be smuggled Gold from Congo without any documents which means that you possessing that Gold is already illegal and you will probably even end up in jail. And yes, you can buy your way out but it will cost you more money...\n\nIn a way they are quite good in convincing and don't care about their \"customers\" at all. All they want is to take as much money from their potential customers till there is no money left. Since they also have good connections with local authority, they just buy their way out by bribing Senior Police officials.\n\nYou wonder how to protect yourself, right ? Well, that's simple. Just stay far away from these crooks. They even use some white / caucasian people who are working there to make you feel everything is safe. Well, don't be fooled. These white people (one of them is actually a retired old German guy) will scam you as hard as the locals and they don't care less.In October 2017, I was the victim of a fraudulent conspiracy from Ghana. I would like to file a complaint against the illegal miners Nana Mensah Abrampah, one of the illegal miners in Tarkva NSUAYEM.\n\nNana Mensah Abrampah, whose company name is: DAASEBRE MINING GROUPs (DAASEBRE MINING LIMITED) And EDOI INVESTMENT GHANA LIMITED\n\nPassport nr (if this correct Pass Nr, he gave us) H1980550, Date of Birth: 23/03/1957\n\nHe was introduced by our Ghanaian friend Edward Nsor, Nana Mensah invited me to fly to Ghana see attached Invitation letter to get visa on arrival\n\nI paid $73,500 to Mensah, in cash USD 24,500 and money transfer from Slovakian bank total $49,000 for 3 kg gold bars. I received 1 kg bar from Mensah to guarantee he will deliver CIF. The $73,500 supposed to be for export taxes, freight and insurance of 30kg CIF to be delivered to Spain or Dubai.\n\nThe 4kg gold bars was stored in Security house I receive SKR from GM Security house. Mensah recommended the security house and insisted I should keep the gold in GM Security house.\n\nSuddenly, Mensah said he must bring the 30kg gold bars to Benin because he will get some problems with Ghanaian government to export the gold bars. He cannot get export clearance due to new government law. I trusted him we drove to Benin by car together.\n\nIn Benin, I found out the gold bars have no documents and it was transported illegally from Ghana to Benin. I was of course have no idea what is the procedure there, trusting Mensah.Otherwise I will not agree to transport the gold illegally from Ghana to Benin.\n\nWhen we arrived in Benin, Mensah introduce the Shipper Mr Cofi who is a good friend of Mensah. When we arrived in Cofi‚Äôs office in Benin, I found out the gold was from Illegal miners no documents. Mr Cofi offered us to provide the documents; he will do all the arrangement to get ECOWAS, Certificate of Origin and Certificate of Ownership but Cofi Required $41,000 for that service. Cofi also asked for down payment to start the procedure. Mensah told me to pay Cofi, I gave my last cash to Cofi ‚Ç¨3,000 to start the procedures, I was frustrated therefore I paid Mr Cofi ‚Ç¨3,000 just to start the procedure.\n\nMensah drove back to Ghana he said he will get some funds to pay Cofi. He left me in Benin and told me and my friend to wait for him. Few days past nothing happened I realised something wrong is going on.\n\nWe flew back to Ghana. I tried to get the 4 kg from Security house and no one can tell me where is the 4kg gold bars.\n\nThe collateral of 4 kg was just a trap and Mensah recomended fake security house to scam me.\n\nI flew back to my country. According to Mensah he came back to Benin and Mr Cofi refused to do the document for the gold bars. According to Mensah‚Äôs story he transported the gold bar to Togo he said he will get documents in TOGO through another shipper.\n\nMensah is asking again $3,000 from me to do the documents. But this time I refused to pay.\n\nHow can I make a police report against NANA Mensah and the illegal miners? Unfortunately we have to report a list of new scammers and the companies they use to scam buyers interested in Gold Dore Bars or Gold Nuggets in Nairobi, Dar Es Salaam or Uganda.\n\nHow do they operate... They will invite you in their office in the Lavington Area in Nairobi. Lavington is an Upper Class Area for people with money and their office looks professional to, to be honest.\n\nThey have a small location behind the office to smelt Gold and it all looks good, but... It is their plan to make you feel comfortable in order to scam you ! They will offer you collateral which is worthless because at the end of the day, the Gold doesn't have any documents which means you can even end up in jail with that gold in your possession. They will offer you to store the Gold in the bank but that also doesn't make any sense because they will always make sure that one of their own (most of the time the so called customs official) will need to sign documents together with the buyer which means gold will not leave the bank if the so called customs official doesn't sign.\n\nThe documents you will get are fake. Insurance documents, Certificate of Origin, etc, etc, it will all be fake. This is the moments their delaying tactics will start. Don't ask me what they will not use in order to delay things: Hospital visits, delays with documents in Congo or Tanzania, UN Certificates, Children or parents in hospital, car accidents, you name it !\n\nAt the end of the day you will never get your gold and you can say goodye to your money. Only thing to do in a case like this is immediately contact the local authorities (CID, Interpol, Local Police, Etc) and report things.\n\nAziz Ben Musafiri from Kenya and he is operating in Kampala Uganda Nairobi Kenya as well as Tanzania\n\nHans Dieter Wagner is a German national but currently living in Nairobi Kenya\n\nAlbert Yale is from Kenya operating from Nairobi Kenya most of the time\n\nRoland Jojo Olembe is from Kenya and acting as the customs official he is operating from Nairobi Kenya\n\nMost of the time they will probably use one of the following companies to scam you so please be extremely careful !!\n\nUmoja Express Logistics operates in Kampala Uganda as well as Nairobi Kenya\n\nwww.umojaexpresslogistics.com\n\nSky Blue Cargo Logistics\n\nwww.skybluecargologistics.com\n\nGulf First Cargo Logistics\n\nwww.gulffirstcargologistics.com\n\nKenya Metropolitan Gold Refinery LTD - KMGR operates in Nairobi Kenya\n\nwww.kmgoldrefineryltd.com\n\n+254739250732A buyers story and Experience at Italtec:\n\nHello Mr. Megumichan,\n\nThanks for getting back to us about this fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Mr. Kwame of Italtec in Ghana.\n\nOur representatives in Ghana ( Dutch and Ghanian citizens) paid for the transport of 50 kilograms of raw gold to be transported to The US on our Import Visa. Unbeknownst to us the CEO of Italtec Mr. Kwame and the seller Mr. Joseph Abedi of Joseboat Ventures Ltd, knew each other beforehand and after we paid for the transport ( 15,000 USD), which we have a proof of( Mr. Kwame the CEO himself signed the document stating we pay for assay!),and behind closed doors Italtec and Joseboat Ventures ltd. changed the addressee and delivery address of the gold with no mention of our company's importing license or final destination anywhere. When we asked for the required documents we as buyers were supposed to receive ( according to the contract seller and buyer signed on the 3rd of May 2017) they came up with all kinds of excuses as to where the gold was and where the documents were. Eventually they gave us a Track and Trace code for the documents which were send to a warehouse or something in New Jersey USA. These documents were scheduled to be picked up by Joseboat Ventures representative in NJ.\n\nUp until now we have no idea which papers they send. It could be a blank paper or something vague like that, guess we'll never know, because the Representative is also Missing in Action.\n\nIt has been over a month now and both the CEO Mr Kwame and Joseboat Ventures are in hiding and our representatives can't reach them. Italtec is using excuses that Mr. Kwame is on holiday etc etc but we know better. He is enjoying the easy 15,ooo USD he got by way of fraude and scheming along with Joseboat Ventures, whom are nowhere to be found up till now.\n\nEven the authorities are not to be trusted due to corruption so our hands are tight in that retrospect,but we will make people aware of the scams involving a registered Ghanian company whom have dealings with Europe and the US. They need to be warned. Up untill now we are constantly going over to Italtec to confront Mr. Kwame but he is hiding like a scared little girl behind his guards.\n\nWhat can your website do for us in getting notifications out to the business people in Ghana?\n\nThanks for getting back to us btw.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJason\"Hello,\n\nI am new to this site. And also fairly new to gold and it's prospects. I wasn't even sure where to post this but I am hoping this is the best place to start.\n\nAnyways...the reason I am here is because I have recently acquired some gold. About 24K (98% purity from the tests done) which are 2Kgs. Currently in form of bars right now (They were nuggets before that). The reason they're in the form of bars is due to logistic reason.\n\nI have tried selling them locally. However every attempt has been met with theft attempts. And due to high corruption in the country (Kenya), the police can turn against you just to keep the gold. And the asking price from the proper/credible institutions that are available is ridiculously low, even after testing. They do this because they know how difficult it is to sell gold here as an individual. And many other reasons that has put me off selling it locally. So i have turned to selling it online or internationally. So I am looking for help in how to go about this or even buyers if I am lucky.\n\nAny questions on anything i have missed out can be answered.\n\nAny and all help will be appreciated. \"\n\nI've posted this on a forum.

Do not send them one dollar. They have stolen from Russian, Chinese, the Spanish, Americans and other Africans as well. Asona Gold mines have a mining license, Asona Gold mines are registered as a company in Ghana but they have over 90 open complaints with the police. The federal police of Ghana have had numerous complaints but they have yet to apprehend this criminal. We are ashamed of his behavior. The only reason why Nana Donkor is still free is because he pays the police and BNI supervisers heavily. Everytime a person comes from another country to buy gold, they take the money, they only give them a small amount of gold they claim the government will not let them send the rest and then they split the money among them selves and go buy more expensive cars. Nana Donkor promise discounts of 20-30% off of world spot price. Nana Donkor claim that they keep gold off the books and thats why they can‚Äôt use PMMC (the only way to buy gold in Ghana legitamately). PMMC buys gold at 3% underworld Spot price So why one earth would someone sell gold to you for half of its value?\n\nThe way Asona Gold Mines work: Nana Donkor, Gymah, Ajoy Garapati, Mike Farr and any member of this gang, will show gold to buyers, but it isn‚Äôt real gold it is Ionized Copper. It looks and feels like gold until you put Nitric Acid on it. The take 3-10M dollars a month. The have bank accounts all over the world. They are part of a HUGE organization of other gold theives that control Accra. When you look at them they are well dressed, clean shaven, and polite people but don‚Äôt be suprised when you loose your money. The past government allowed them to steal these huge amount of money and the new government does not seem to care. What do you expect? Nana Donkor is a millionaire in a country where the average person makes 7,000.00 American Dollars a year.\n\nWho is part of this scheme? His banker (they use correspondent banks so that the money doesn‚Äôt go throught the bank of Ghana and is UNACCOUNTED FOR), His lawyer, The head of CID, The head of BNI and countless other police officers that he pays as his hench men to kidnap, hurt or kill anyone that causes problems. Ajoy Garapati, Michael Farr and others are getting investors worldwide every month\n\nMedia: He even runs ads telling people that their is someone impersonating him. He runs full page ads in the news paper that state ‚Äúhe is the victim.‚Äù\n\nNana Donkor Ego: Nana Donkor often brags about being untouchable.\n\nWhy Nana Donkor Isn‚Äôt He In Jail?: The heads of the BNI have been on his payroll along time. His lawyer pays the judges and their are countless civil cases against him.They give our country a bad name. So please keep your money in your pocket before it goes in his. Everyone in his office is a part of the scam. Most Banks will not even send a SBLC or BG to this country because of this one company‚Äôs reputation and this one man‚Äôs greed. He has put an unbearable stain upon reputable gold dealers in our country. If you dont believe this, or you are selfconvinced this man is going to sell you cheap gold. Please If you ever do business with Asona Gold Mines please use PMMC. Send your purchase contract to PMMC, let them monitor the transaction, they will take the money from you and the gold from the seller and they will NOT let your money be stolen. They do not charge taxes on Gold in Ghana. So anyone who tells you this is a liar. They charge 45.00 per kilo to smelt and do the ASSAY. They charge 0.5% to ship. This is less than 1%.The money isn‚Äôt released until you have a Airway Bill, Packing list and Commercial Invoice.\n\nAsona Golf mines usually uses AA Minerals, to send gold samples, AA minerals know this is a big scammer, because many people already go to complaint to AA minerals, but its not a problem of AA minerals its something that Government of Ghana should stop.SCAMMERS WITH SERIOUS CONNECTIONS IN KENYA FROM CUSTOMS THROUGH TO REVENUE AUTHORITY\n\n(This Report was sent to me by one of their Victims after they took 139,000usd and another demand of 50,500usd)\n\n1.

This company promotes itelf as a gold clearing agent. They will give you all the detailed costs of what is required to clear your shipment out of Uganda to anywhere in the world. Within 24 hours of receiving your money you will be advised there is an unforeseen problem and they need more money. They say they cannot return your investment as it is already spent on the progress they have made. In our case the investor had no more money to advance so he lost US$25,000. The reason given was because the supplier had not supplied the correct import documentation bringing the gold into Uganda and therefore they needed more money to cover the full amount declared on the import document, which was more or less 4 times the original US$25,000 advance. BUT, prior to advancing the money, there was no problem with the incoming documentation and MEI categorically stated they would have no problem clearing the required amount, as per the agreement, out of Uganda. Of course they will offer to partially contribute to clearing the shipment but not enough to cover the whole required amount. They will still expect the investor to add more of his own money. It is a clever scam and we believe MEI and the supplier, Mr. BUPE CHIPANDO of COMMODITY EXCHANGE LIMTED registered in Zambia, were in partnership with each other to scam the investor. We therefore strongly advise to keep clear of MEI.katanga Export & Import scam me for ‚Ç¨14700\n\ni was in the office , the security force come wth 40 kg , Mr Edwin Josuha collect 10 kg out off the box, i was there, we weight , exact 10 kg .do inside the box , we come in the office , sign contract , i pay ‚Ç¨14700 incl melted . i sleep 2 night with the box off really 10 kg gold in my hotel room, i never run out , when i know all before i bring to raffinery hear in dar es salaam , melted , and mone to my account in europe , now he fuck me\n\nwe come after 2 days back with the gold , we melted . i see everything , make pictures , i was there with 2 another guys for the check, total 10 peoples . after melted we come in the office off this seller , i thought , he give me the 1 kg collecteral, confirm the contract !!he show me the documents, export /red letter stop, only acceptable when we pay for the 40 kg , usd 50000 more .he sealded the box, give the key to me, but what is key right now\n\nhe run out side with the box , 5 peoples stop me, about i claim my 1 kg\n\nso he fuck me for this money , i send mail he said , he send 1kg with dhl to europe, nothing is happen\n\nso please how we can stop this criminal edwin josuha !!!!\n\ndamas mahoni also . he send me to this crazy seller , all was fine he promise me, i stay now 5 weaks longer in tanzania, looze all my money where i so hard for working last 2 years\n\ni need that interpol off fbi arrest this guys\n\nmail me : africantimber50@gmail.com\n\nskype : africantimber50\n\nmobile holland : 0031620825233We have been receiving a lot of offers from the Cameroon side for CIF transaction asking for buyers permit.

Gold dust? No. Nuggets? No. Small cheap Chinese scales for rings and jewelry to measure large dore bars? No. They would be able to show the production on the gold mine. They would be able to clearly explain how they get the gold. You must have some serious production going on when you have quantities of gold \"available\" in stock.\n\nGold is not a tomato that is sold on the market.\n\nWhat we ask those who offer gold over Internet to us, as that alone fact that gold was offered over Internet, like it should be tomato is an indication that something is wrong, but we ask them to provide pictures.http://www.goldivanti.com/terms-and-conditions/first-steps-for-gold-sales-from-Africa.html\n\nThis is real gold in my hand: it is 250 grams.\n\nThis is fake gold in the hand of an Indian client who has got scammed in Tanzania believing that this is 250 grams of gold:\n\nCOMPARE THE SIZES. I don't need the calculation, I just need to see the gold to determine if it is brass or not. However, here is the calculation for many of you to understand why a simple observation of gold on the picture may be enough to understand that something is wrong.\n\nUse this picture to observe the gold and dimensions:\n\nAnd use this calculation to understand how that cannot be gold:\n\nhttp://thetaworld.net/images/depository/fake-gold-pictures/calculations/Density-simple.xls\n\nand PDF:http://thetaworld.net/images/depository/fake-gold-pictures/calculations/Density-simple.pdf\n\nFor consulting, guidance and contract on how to setup your gold and diamonds purchasing business, contact us overhttp://www.goldivanti.com -- some real sourcing is possible, provided you are ready to go at ground to understand the business. In general, do not expect any quantities \"ready and available in stock\", you must come closer to the production, otherwise you cannot get better prices. In Tanzania gold may be sold for above the spot gold price, so don't be lured into thinking someone there is going to give you free money just that you can make some profits. In Ghana gold may be sold for 2-3% spot prices, for cash, in Accra. Put yourself in a position of someone in Africa who really need to sell the gold, he is going to sell it locally. Unless you become \"local company\" -- you are not going to make commissions.\n\nTo Start Your Own Gold Mine, review the videos on YouTube:http://www.youtube.com/user/StartYourOwnGoldMine/videos and contact us over:http://www.startyourowngoldmine.com/ and if you wish to introduce someone to us, for the project of opening gold mines, we offer commissions, and that might be most realistic thing you have done attempting to make any gold business in your past.\n\nFeel free to contact me for true verification of sellers. I am also ready to travel anywhere in the world to verify any gold deals on distance, with most accurate methods.\n\nStart Your Own Gold Mine\n\nCoppel, TX\n\nUnited States\n\ncall: +1 214-269-0623\n\nUK number: +441412892273Good thread with valuable information for newbie buyers and lured intermediaries in gold business. Just like a grandmother that knows how to recognize the best tomato on the marketplace, a buyer shall be able to recognize fake gold just by indications or observing the size, volume and weight.\n\nMy advice:\n\n1. Are you putting your priorities when checking out the deal on due diligence, papers, documents, assays? In my opinion this is wrong, you are wasting your time, that is Africa, whatever document you may get it may be also real, including also passports and all. I have found some people being real people, without license, with fake documents, but selling and doing real stuff. Documents are burden for everyone, you should ask for that at the point of purchase, when you are ready to arrange exporting papers.\n\n2. Put your attention on the product. Know your stuff. If you don't know the specific weight of water or don't know metrics system, and that one liter of water should be equal to one kilogram, and how one milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter and how to measure water displacement or how to use those gold scales which determine the gold purity even though not exact, or the specific weight of the gold, or if you never kept the real gold in your hand -- you are moving on the dangerous path. Learn from your grandmother, she knows how to choose best fruits on the marketplace, so should you. Make your homework, go to some nearest dealer, observe, learn the basics of physics that relates to gold.\n\n3. Don't forget that expensive and illegal drugs are easily sold in United States, Europe and just about everywhere. You get high money as easy as that. In those \"regulated\" countries. Why do you think that in African mining countries someone who really have the gold would have any problems selling it without papers? Put all the stories aside, put all the explanations aside, the justifications and all that, and put your attention on the product. If product is there, the guy wants money, you want gold. Why would you put any attention to something else but to arrange the fake gold deal! He needs money as soon as possible. Gold may be sold in each African country without documents, even though they might be required by the law. But reality is totally different. I am not asking you to purchase without documents, but to put yourself in a position of someone in Africa who is owner of gold and who needs money right there. He would bring the gold to the local dealer and get his money. No questions asked.\n\n4. In general, there are no gold nuggets that look all the same just as small buttons that are made out of the welding sticks, and gold dust is not any kind of final product. Simple fact that you are offered \"dust\" or \"nuggets\" is indication that something is smelly. Further, gold is not cheap. It may be sold locally both in West Africa and East Africa for spot prices or very small discounts.\n\n5. To establish proper purchasing operation I am advising local company setup. Yes, you can make money on gold trade with Africa, but in general, you don't need to export gold yourself in order to sell it, you can be a local broker and dealer and come directly to mines and re-sell the gold from there.From: messages-noreply@bounce.linkedin.com [mailto:messages-noreply@bounce.linkedin.com] On Behalf Of Mr. Abdurahma mohammed via LinkedIn\n\nSent: Sunday, 22 September 2013 5:42 PM\n\nTo:\n\nSubject: GOLD SELLER FROM GHANA\n\nMr. Abdurahma mohammed\n\nCEO Gold Seller at AB AND SON COMPANY IN GHANA\n\nATTENTION:\n\nDEAR SIR/ MADAM,\n\nMY NAME IS Mr. ABDURAHMA MAMOHAMMED.

Is there really any product that is not traded through the major market makers? I have be looking though the internet on behalf of a legitimate buying group and it's always the same . Some nimrod says they can source whatever you declare that you're interested in and then when you press for proof of product - they just stop - the correspondence abruptly halts. I don't really expect to find a huge bargain. But out of 20 or so responses to a one day posting - no one came back to say \"I keep the gold here. So I just keep asking for Safe Keeping Receipts that I can verify with someone at the institution that's holding the gold - no one follows up from that point on.\n\nWhy would the production from any mine not just be turned over to a full time broker.\n\nIt doesn't make sense o hear that \"Lefty and Cecile\" from Cameroon somehow got it the distribution chain and now have millions in Dore bars to sell ..... but I tried on behalf of some jewelry makers to see if there were less expensive sources ... gold is money - would you sell a commodity that doesn't \"spoil\" for significantly less than if you had a Goldman Sachs broker get bids for you - I'm not holding my breath - I really don't think that there is a vibrant second tier market of any consequence - Just scammers\n\nLove to hear from someone who can set me straight....\n\nAnd:\n\nCan anyone tell me what a Certificate of Photosynatry is? Or simply tell me where to look.\n\nI can't seem to track it down. Not in mining terms dictionaries ...\n\nThanksThis is a very important message to anyone involved in the commodities industry on the new measures with respect to Buyers and Sellers conducting transactions.\n\nFrom now on, if an ICPO, LOI, RWA, or BCL is issued and the document is not real, true and/or actually verifiably factual, the Buyer will be able to inform the FBI, ICC, and INTERPOL. In addition, after an FCO is sent to the Buyer, there should be a formal answer to Seller from Buyer in a timely manner in accordance with the agreement between parties.\n\nIf there is no response from the Buyer in a timely manner, the buying company will be reported to the FBI, ICC and INTERPOL. If this action is repeated by sellers, they too will also be reported for abuse of the NCND, LOI, ICPO, AND RWA OR BCL, FOR THIS IS NOW A FEDERAL OFFENSE.\n\nIt is important to transmit this to all clients that work with providers that are members of the ICC, FBI, and other international organizations. From this point forward, the international codes will be strictly enforced to exclude all intruders that send or transmit false information. Those who submit a false NCND/IMFPA, LOI, ICPO, RWA or BCL, or FCO, as well as FALSE PROOF OF PRODUCT (POP), FALSE PROOF OF FUNDS (POF) WILL BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME.\n\nThis offense went into effect on November 15, 2008 and re-effected this month after a meeting was held between the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Interpol, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe reason for this measurement is to protect the commodities industry which is a fundamental part of the world‚Äôs economy.\n\nI have read and understood the severity of the warning above and do realize the serious impact that pertains to all oil and other commodities transactions.\n\n-- Hi,Hope you can find out if this is a scam:I got an email from a man from Ghana, Victor Yaw Asante. He wrote first on skype, he wrote this:\n\nHello Petrov, I am Victor Yaw ASANTE a citizen of federal Republic of Ghana . I have in my bank the existence of a big amount of money that belongs to a customer ....., who happen to have the same surname as yours .The fund is now without any claim because Mr..... died in a deadly earthquake in Japan in march 2011 . I want your cooperation so as to make the bank send you the fund as the beneficiary and next of kin to the fund. This transaction will be of a great mutual assistance to us. Send me your reply of interest so that I will give you the details .\n\nStrictly send it to my private email account : ( victorasante01@hotmail.com )\n\nAt the receipt of your reply, I will give you details of the transaction. And a copy of the Deposit Certificate of the fund and also the Incorporation Certificate of the company that generated the fund .Yours Sincerely,Victor Yaw ASANTE.\n\nI believed at him,because he first contacted me on skype,his Picture is also there.\n\nNow Ive been researching and found out its alot of scam out there from Africa. Is this man a criminal? He keeps on contacting me on email and skype. I have been sending him all my details (Ive been talking to my bank,so he cant do nothing there),but I also sent a copy of my Passport...Should I contact the police? I start believing this man...Veit Kraus is seriously in hot water, he is currently under investigation with severe consequences pending.\n\nNote: From this point forward, the international codes will be strictly enforced to exculde all intruders that send out false information.\n\nThose who submit false NCNDA/IMFPA, LOI, SCO, FCO, documents WILL BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME.\n\nIf there is no response from a sender in a timely manner, it will be reported t the FBI, ICC, and Interpol. THIS IS A FEDERAL OFFENCE.\n\nThis went into effect on the 15th of November 2008 after a meeting was held between the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Interpol, FBI, and CIA.\n\nBy alerting all Honest Brokers and hard working intermediaries is the correct and ethical thing to do and the reason behind me putting this up on the net.\n\nThis person Veit Kraus will lead you to nothing as he does not have the capacity or intellect to complete any commodity transaction, that he claims nor has he ever closes a transaction that he prides himself on.\n\nWe can all make claims and state our own success but the truth be known that this man is an absolute fraud, circumventor and is driven by pure ego and there is no support to all he claims\n\nHere are some of the Claims Veit Kraus prides himself on.\n\nAuthorised Gold mandate for the Russian Govt ? and has been in meeting with Putin himself ?\n\nAuthorised Gold Mandate to the Saudi Royal Family ? to sell their Gold ?\n\nAuthorised Gold Mandate for a Japanese Multinational who has 500,000mt of Gold in Hong Kong at a 9/6 discount ?\n\nAuthorised Gold Mandate to American Express to sell their Gold Holdings Globally ?\n\nAuthorised Gold Mandate to UBS Switzerland and can supply any quantity you require ? Claims that the Head Person inside UBS is his next door neighbour ?\n\nThese are a just a few of his ridiculous claims in which i ask everyone to have him show you his Authorised papers and incase he has downloaded them himself of the net ( fake ) please call the person on the papers he might present and ask if it is at all Genuine, you will soon come to the conclusion that he is a fraud and you will save yourself the daily lies that he will conspire to keep you there until he can strip you off all the information you have and then work away to deceit you from any deal that has any chance of concluding.\n\nIf you ask yourself why would he make such claims ? the answer is very simple, he uses the global network of brokers to attain all information on who the sellers are or who the buyers are, as he plays both sides of the fence, to only collect this data and serve himself in the most selfish way possible with out including you at the end.\n\nThis pathetic and appalling attitude is why he has never transacted in Gold and the catalyst for him to move into the BOND Business now as he is in search of new victims as the Gold Circles are onto him.\n\nSo if he is claiming the same rubbish in Bonds with his partner Guenther, please walk away as you are surely walking into a mine field of trouble.\n\nLet it be known that three years ago Veit was fired from his employment with Aldi, the try to setup and run a solar panels business ( Green-ray ) which collapsed and to further show how troubled this man is he ran off with his secretary in which his Mother and children have completely disowned him.\n\nHis stability above is a reflection of who you are dealing with , KEEP AWAY from this mentally ill old man.\n\nVeit Kraus\n\nCEO\n\nelement resources\n\nLohstr 23\n\nD-92699 Bechtsrieth\n\nTel +49 961 2067 6056\n\nCell + 49 176 995 389 02\n\nFax +49 961 484 96106\n\nemail vk@element-resources.de\n\nSkype greenray6Jason,\n\nI am really sorry that your father lost a lot of money on gold scams, but you bring up some good points. There are a few simple rules just to start with that should always be observed to avoid being scammed.\n\nFirst of all, never even consider a gold deal on a cold call or unsolicited email. This will always be a scam.\n\nRemember that there is no legitimate person or company that will sell you large amounts of gold direct to you. Legitimate gold is sold to refineries.\n\nAnyone offering a huge discount on gold should be immediately flagged as a scam. Even refineries do not pay outright for gold, until it has been refined. Then they pay according to the weight of gold after the refining process, and at the rate of pure gold at that point.\n\nPlaying the market on gold is different as the gold is bought and sold through the market, you will never touch it or see it. It is like any other commodity where you buy and sell according to the current rates.\n\nGold is at a great rate now and will probably continue to go up. the only way to earn on gold is to invest in the actual mining of the gold. There is a risk no matter how you enter into this type of situation. You can either invest in yourself and go out there and dig it up yourself, or you can invest in a mining license or claim for the production of gold.\n\nWe opted to go through the process and obtain primary mining licenses for 150 hectare of area to mine alluvial gold in Tanzania. The process was long and the effort huge to finally obtain the proper licensing, but worth it in order to control our own capability and not rely on others.\n\nThere is no \"too good to be true\" ventures out there.
