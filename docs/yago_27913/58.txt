Isabella Of Angoulêmewas Queen consort of England, for sixteen years and Countess of Angoulême from 16 June 1202 – 4 June 1246.

King John of England became infatuated with Isabella, who at the time was only twelve years old. The unprincipled John stole the enchanting Isabella from under Hugh's very nose, which resulted in King Philip II of France confiscating John's French lands.

Isabella’s second husband was the son of Hugh IX de Lusignan, to whom she was contracted to in 1200. Hugh X de Lusignan was originally contracted for her daughter Joan, and Joan even lived at the Lusignan court in preparation for her marriage. However, when Hugh X de Lusignan met her mother Isabella, he put Joan aside for her.

Isabella planned a failed rebellion against Louis IX of France's, after feeling insulted by his mother Blanche, Isabella and Blanche had a deep-seeded dislike of each other. But this fuelled things.

In 1244, Two royal cooks were arrested for attempting to poison the King of France. Under questioning, they confessed to having been in the pay of Isabella. Isabella fled and went into Fontevrault Abbey, where she remained for two years, until her death.
