        "text": "Known for: Queen of England; rather fiery marriage to King John\n\nDates: 1186? or 1188? - May 31, 1246\n\nOccupation: Countess of Angouleme, queen consort to John, King of England, one of the Plantagenet queens\n\nAlso known As: Isabella of Angoulême, Isabel of Angoulême\n\nFamily Background\n\nIsabella's mother was Alice de Courtenay, granddaughter of France's King Louis VI. Isabella's father was Aymar Taillefer, Count of Angouleme.\n\nMarriage to John of England\n\nBetrothed when very young to Hugh IX, Count of Lusignan, Isabella of Angouleme married John Lackland of England, son of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England. John had put aside his first wife, Isabella of Gloucester, in 1199. Isabella of Angoulême was twelve to fourteen years old at her marriage to John in 1200.\n\nIn 1202, Isabella's father died, and Isabella became Countess of Angouleme in her own right.\n\nThe marriage of Isabella and John was not an easy one. John was infatuated with his young and beautiful wife, but they both were reported to have engaged in adultery and to have had strong tempers which they used on each other. When John suspected Isabella of having had an affair, he had her suspected lover hanged and then dangled above her bed.\n\nIsabella and John had five children before John died in 1216. At John's death, Isabella's quick action had her son Henry crowned in Gloucester where they were at the time.\n\nSecond Marriage\n\nIsabella of Angouleme returned to her homeland after John's death. There she married Hugh X of Lusignan, son of the man she'd been betrothed to before marrying John, and the man who was betrothed to her eldest daughter by John. Hugh X and Isabella had nine children.\n\nHer marriage took place without the permission of the English king's council, as would be required as queen dowager. The resulting conflict including confiscating her Normandy dower lands, stopping her pension, and a threat by Isabella to keep Princess Joan from marrying the Scottish king. Henry III involved the Pope. who threatened Isabella and Hugh with excommunication. The English finally settled on compensation for her seized lands, and restoration of at least part of her pension. She supported her son's invasion of Normandy before he carried out that mission, but then failed to support him once he arrived.\n\nIn 1244, Isabella was accused of conspiring against the French King to poison him, and she fled to the abbey at Fontevrault and hid for two years. She died in 1246, still hiding in the secret chamber. Hugh, her second husband, died three years later on crusade. Most of her children from her second marriage returned to England, to the court of their half-brother.\n\nBurial\n\nIsabella had arranged to be buried outside the abbey at Fontevrault as penance, but some years after her death, her son, Henry III, King of England, had her re-interred beside her mother-in-law Eleanor of Aquitaine and father-in-law Henry II, inside the abbey.\n\nMarriages\n\nbetrothed to: Hugh le Brun, Count of Lusignan\n\nmarried to: John I of England, August 24, 1200\n\nmarried to: Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche\n\nChildren of Queen Isabella of Angouleme and King John\n\nKing Henry III of England, born October 1, 1207\n\nRichard, Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans\n\nJoan, married Alexander II of Scotland\n\nIsabella, married Emperor Frederick II\n\nEleanor, married William Marshall and then Simon de Montfort\n\nChildren of Isabella of Angouleme and Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche"
