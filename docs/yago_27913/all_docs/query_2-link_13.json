        "text": "Isabella of Angoulême (French : Isabelle d'Angoulême; 1188 - 31 May 1246) was Countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England . Queen of England She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer , Count of Angoulême , by Alice de Courtenay . Her paternal grandparents were William IV of Angoulême , Count of Angouleme and Marguerite de Turenne. Her maternal grandparents were Pierre de Courtenay and Elizabeth de Courtenay. Her maternal great-grandfather was King Louis VI of France . She became Countess of Angoulême in her own right in 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on 24 August 1200, at Bordeaux , a year after he annulled his first marriage to Isabel of Gloucester . Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh le Brun, Count of Lusignan, son of the then Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued. At the time of her marriage to John, the 12-year-old Isabella was already renowned for her beauty and has sometimes been called the Helen of the Middle Ages by historians. However, her marriage to John cannot be said to have been successful, in part because she was much younger than her husband and had a fiery character to match his. Second marriage When John died in 1216, Isabella was still in her twenties. She returned to France and in 1220, proceeded to marry Hugh X of Lusignan Count of La Marche . It is unclear whether it had been Hugh X or his father to whom Isabella had been betrothed before her marriage to King John. By Hugh X, Isabella had nine more children. Their eldest son Hugh XI of Lusignan succeeded his father as Count of La Marche and Count of Angouleme in 1249. Death and burial Isabella was accused of plotting against King Louis IX of France in 1244; she fled to Fontevrault Abbey , where she died on 31 May 1246, and was buried there. At her own insistence, she was first buried in the churchyard, as an act of repentance for her many misdeeds. On a visit to Fontevrault, her son King Henry III of England was shocked to find her buried outside the Abbey and ordered her immediately moved inside. She was finally placed beside Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine . Afterwards, most of her many children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of Henry, their half-brother.\n\nIsabella of Angoulême From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nIsabella of Angoulême (Fr. Isabelle d'Angoulême ; c. 1187 – May 31, 1246) was countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England. She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillifer, Count of Angoulême, by Alix de Courtenay; her maternal great-grandfather was King Louis VI of France. She became Countess of Angoulême in her own right in 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on August 24, 1200, at Bordeaux, a year after he annulled his first marriage. At the time of this marriage Isabella was aged about thirteen, and her beauty was renowned; she is sometimes called the \"Helen\" of the Middle Ages by historians. It could not be said to have been a successful marriage, as Isabella was much younger than her husband and had a fiery character to match his. Before their marriage, she had been betrothed to Hugh X of Lusignan[1], son of the then Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all his French lands, and armed conflict ensued. When John died in 1216, Isabella was still in her twenties. She returned to France and in 1220 proceeded to marry Hugh X of Lusignan, now Count of La Marche, her former fiancé. Isabella was accused of plotting against the French king in 1244; she fled to Fontevrault Abbey, where she died on May 31, 1246, and was buried there. Afterwards most of her many children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of their half-brother King Henry III.\n\nIssue\n\nWith King John of England: 5 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including: King Henry III of England (b. 1207 – d. 1272) Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans (b. 1209 – d. 1272) Joan (b. 1210 – d. 1238), the wife of King Alexander II of Scotland Isabella (b. 1214 – d. 1241), the wife of Emperor Frederick II Eleanor (b. 1215 – d. 1275), who would marry William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke\n\nIsabelle went into hiding (inside the abbey) due to her being blamed for the death of her husband, John. She remained in hideing (in a secret chamber) until her death. She was buried, upon her request, in the open cemetery (common graveyard) at Fontevrault. Some years later her son, Henry III, moved her body into the choir of the Abbey Church & commissioned the fine effigy which is the only near contemporary likeness of her.\n\nIsabella of Angoulême (French: Isabelle d'Angoulême) was Countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England.

She was queen from 24 August 1200 until John's death on 19 October 1216. She had five children by the king including his heir Henry who succeeded John as Henry III of England. In 1220, Isabella married secondly Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children. In 1241 Isabella formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile for whom she had a deep-seated hatred.[1] In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the king, and to avoid arrest, sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey where she died two years later at the age of about 58.\n\nMarried at age 12. Renowned for her beauty After John died, returned to France Married Hugh X of Lusigan, Count of La Marche in 1220 Five children by John and nine by Hugh\n\nIsabella of Angoulenne Taillefer Widow of John Lackland King of England (1167-?)

John had put aside his first wife in 1198. Isabella was twelve years old at her marriage to John.\n\nIn 1202, Isabella's father died, and she became Countess of Angouleme in her own right.\n\nThe marriage of Isabella and John was not an easy one. John was infatuated with his young and beautiful wife, but they both were reported to have engaged in adultery, and to have had strong tempers which they used on each other. When John suspected Isabella of having had an affair, he had her suspected lover hanged and then dangled above her bed.\n\nIsabella and John had five children before John died in 1216. At John's death, Isabella's quick action had her son Henry crowned at John's death, in Gloucester where they were at the time.\n\nJohn and Isabella had 5 children together:\n\nKing Henry III (b. October 1, 1207)\n\nRichard, Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans\n\nJoan (married Alexander II of Scotland)\n\nIsabella (married Emperor Frederick II)\n\nEleanor (married William Marshall and then Simon de Montfort)\n\nEpilogue\n\nAfter John's death Isabella went on to marry Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche. They had many scandalous adventures together, some of which you may read for yourself if you are so inclined.\n\nBy her own prior arrangement, Isabella was first buried in the Fontevraud Abbey's churchyard, as an act of repentance for her many misdeeds. On a visit to Fontevraud, her son King Henry III of England was shocked to find her buried outside the Abbey and ordered her immediately moved inside. She was finally placed beside Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nIsabella of Angoulême (French: Isabelle d'Angoulême, IPA: [izab%C9%9Bl dɑ̃ɡulɛm]; 1188[1] – 31 May 1246) was suo jure Countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England as the second wife of King John. She was queen from 24 August 1200 until John's death on 19 October 1216. She had five children by the king including his heir Henry who succeeded John as Henry III of England. In 1220, Isabella married secondly the man to whom she had been originally betrothed, Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children. Hugh had been promised to her eldest daughter, Joan, but the latter was instead married to King Alexander II of Scotland.\n\nIn 1241, Isabella formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile for whom she had a deep-seated hatred.[2] In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the king, and to avoid arrest, sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey where she died two years later at the age of about 58.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_of_Angoul%C3%AAme\n\nIsabella became Countess of Angoulême in her own right on 16 June 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on 24 August 1200, at Bordeaux, a year after he annulled his first marriage to Isabel of Gloucester. She was crowned queen in an elaborate ceremony on 9 October at Westminster Abbey in London. Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan,[2] son of the then Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued.\n\nAt the time of her marriage to John, the 12-year-old Isabella was already renowned for her beauty[3] and has sometimes been called the Helen of the Middle Ages by historians.[4] However, her marriage to John cannot be said to have been successful, in part because she was much younger than her husband and possessed a volatile temper to match his own. King John, however, was deeply infatuated with his young, beautiful wife; he neglected his state affairs to spend time with Isabella, often remaining in bed with her until noon, although it was the custom for kings to rise at five o'clock in the morning to commence their duties. The common people began to term her a \"siren\" or \"Messalina\", although they were pleased with her beauty.[5] Her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aquitaine readily accepted her as John's wife.[6]\n\nOn 1 October 1207 at Winchester Castle, Isabella gave birth to a son and heir who was named Henry after the King's father, Henry II. He was quickly followed by another son, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans; and three daughters, Joan, Isabel, and Eleanor. All five children survived into adulthood, and would make illustrious marriages; all but Joan would produce offspring of their own.\n\nIsabella of Angouleme Queen of England was born circa 1187. She married John \"Lackland\" Plantagenet King of England, son of Henry II \"Curtmantle\" Plantagenet King of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine Queen of England, on 24 August 1200 at Bordeaux Cathedral, Bordeaux, Gironde, France. As of 24 August 1200,her married name was Plantagenet.

She had five children by the king including his heir, later Henry III. In 1220, Isabella married Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children. Some people claim that Isabella formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile for whom she had a deep-seated hatred. In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the king, and to avoid arrest, sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey where she died two years later, but none of this can be confirmed. She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême, by Alice of Courtenay, who was sister of Peter II of Courtenay, Latin Emperor of Constantinople and granddaughter of King Louis VI of France. Isabella became Countess of Angoulême in her own right on 16 June 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on 24 August 1200, at Bordeaux, a year after he annulled his first marriage to Isabel of Gloucester. She was crowned queen in an elaborate ceremony on 9 October at Westminster Abbey in London. Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan, son of the then Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued. At the time of her marriage to John, the 12-year-old Isabella was already renowned for her beauty and has sometimes been called the Helen of the Middle Ages by historians. Isabella was much younger than her husband and possessed a volatile temper to match his own. King John, however, was deeply infatuated with his young, beautiful wife; he neglected his state affairs to spend time with Isabella, often remaining in bed with her until noon, although it was the custom for kings to rise at five o'clock in the morning to commence their duties. The common people began to term her a \"siren\" or \"Messalina\", although they were pleased with her beauty. Her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aquitaine readily accepted her as John's wife. On 1 October 1207 at Winchester Castle, Isabella gave birth to a son and heir who was named Henry after the King's father, Henry II. He was quickly followed by another son, Richard, and three daughters, Joan, Isabel, and Eleanor. All five children survived into adulthood, and would make illustrious marriages; all but Joan would produce offspring of their own. Described as \"vain, capricious, and troublesome\", Isabella could not reconcile herself with her less prominent position in France. Though Queen dowager of England, Isabella was now mostly regarded as a mere Countess of La Marche and had to give precedence to other women.[12] In 1241, when Isabella and Hugh were summoned to the French court to swear fealty to King Louis IX of France's brother, Alphonse, who had been invested as Count of Poitou, their mother, the Queen Dowager Blanche openly snubbed her. This so infuriated Isabella, who had a deep-seated hatred of Blanche due to the latter having fervently supported the French invasion of England during the First Barons' War in May 1216, that she began to actively conspire against King Louis. Isabella and her husband, along with other disgruntled nobles, including her son-in-law Raymond VII of Toulouse, sought to create an English-backed confederacy which united the provinces of the south and west against the French king.[13] In 1244, after the confederacy had failed and Hugh had made peace with King Louis, two royal cooks were arrested for attempting to poison the King; upon questioning they confessed to having been in Isabella's pay.[14] Before Isabella could be taken into custody, she fled to Fontevraud Abbey, where she died on 31 May 1246. By her own prior arrangement, she was first buried in the Abbey's churchyard, as an act of repentance for her many misdeeds. On a visit to Fontevraud, her son King Henry III of England was shocked to find her buried outside the Abbey and ordered her immediately moved inside. She was finally placed beside Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Afterwards, most of her many Lusignan children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of Henry, their half-brother. Issue: With King John of England: 5 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including: 1.King Henry III of England (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272). Married Eleanor of Provence, by whom he had issue, including his heir, King Edward I of England. 2.Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans (5 January 1209 – 2 April 1272). Married firstly Isabel Marshal, secondly Sanchia of Provence, and thirdly Beatrice of Falkenburg. Had issue. 3.Joan (22 July 1210 – 1238), the wife of King Alexander II of Scotland. Her marriage was childless. 4.Isabella (1214–1241), the wife of Emperor Frederick II, by whom she had issue. 5.Eleanor (1215–1275), who would marry firstly William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke; and secondly Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, by whom she had issue.\n\nPromise à Hugues IX de Lusignan, comte de la Marche, le roi d'Angleterre, Jean sans Terre la soustrait à son fiancé et l'épouse le 24 août 1200 à Bordeaux, Angoulême ou ChinonN 1. Cette péripétie a donné lieu à de nombreux récits plus ou moins controversés. Y eut-il accord entre les parties ou rapt ? La version française, populaire et à connotation romanesque, penche pour l'enlèvement. Jean sans Terre qui tenait alors sa cour à Bordeaux se trouvait sans épouse après avoir fait annuler son mariage[r%C3%A9f. nécessaire] avec Isabelle de Gloucester3. S'étant rendu à Angoulême en tant qu'invité au mariage d'Isabelle et d'Hugues X de Lusignan, il fut si épris de la beauté de la fiancée qu'il la ravit et l'épousa. La chronique de Flandres rapporte que Jean sans Terre fut prié de conduire la fiancée à l'abbaye de Saint-Cybard d'Angoulême et que lorsqu'ils furent devant l'évêque qui devait officier le mariage, il lui dit : « Unissez-moi par les liens du mariage avec cette dame parce que je la désire pour femme. » L'évêque, dit-on, n'osant résister au monarque anglais, les maria4. À Angoulême, une petite rue étroite et très en pente, qui descend à la Charente près de l'ancienne abbaye Saint-Cybard, passe pour être le chemin emprunté par les fuyards. C'est donc âgée seulement d'une douzaine d'années que la jeune Isabelle d'Angoulême devient reine d'Angleterre.\n\nC’est à la suite de cet enlèvement2, que Jean sans Terre est condamné pour forfaiture et que la commise est prononcée sur ses biens du royaume de France, biens qui reviennent au roi de France, Philippe Auguste. À la mort de Jean sans Terre en 1216, tandis que son fils aîné devient roi d'Angleterre sous le nom d'Henri III, elle rentre en France et épouse le fils de son ancien fiancé Hugues X de LusignanN 2 en 1220.\n\nC'est sans doute sous son influence que Henri III d'Angleterre et Hugues de Lusignan organisent un front commun contre le roi de France Louis IX. Cependant ce dernier bat les coalisés à Taillebourg (dans l'actuel département de la Charente-Maritime) les 21 et 22 juillet 1242. À la suite de cette défaite Hugues de Lusignan se soumet au roi de France. Au cours de la rencontre, Isabelle, qui voulait toujours porter le titre de reine, aurait tenté de faire empoisonner sans succès Louis IX5.\n\nElle mourut en 1246 et fut d'abord enterrée dans une chapelle de l'abbaye Notre-Dame de La Couronne, appelée alors Saint-Nicolas5 avant d'être transférée à Fontevraud.\n\nHouse House of Taillefer Father Aymer, Count of Angoulême Mother Alice of Courtenay Born c.1188 Died 4 June 1246 (aged c. 57–58) Fontevraud Abbey, France Burial Fontevraud Abbey\n\nIsabella of Angoulême (French : Isabelle d'Angoulême; 1188 - 31 May 1246) was Countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England .

Their eldest son Hugh XI of Lusignan succeeded his father as Count of La Marche and Count of Angouleme in 1249.

Cette péripétie a donné lieu à de nombreux récits plus ou moins controversés. Y eut-il accord entre les parties ou rapt ? La version française, populaire et à connotation romanesque, penche pour l'enlèvement. Jean sans Terre qui tenait alors sa cour à Bordeaux se trouvait sans épouse après avoir fait annuler son mariage[r%C3%A9f. nécessaire] avec Isabelle de Gloucester3. S'étant rendu à Angoulême en tant qu'invité au mariage d'Isabelle et d'Hugues X de Lusignan, il fut si épris de la beauté de la fiancée qu'il la ravit et l'épousa. La chronique de Flandres rapporte que Jean sans Terre fut prié de conduire la fiancée à l'abbaye de Saint-Cybard d'Angoulême et que lorsqu'ils furent devant l'évêque qui devait officier le mariage, il lui dit : « Unissez-moi par les liens du mariage avec cette dame parce que je la désire pour femme. » L'évêque, dit-on, n'osant résister au monarque anglais, les maria4. À Angoulême, une petite rue étroite et très en pente, qui descend à la Charente près de l'ancienne abbaye Saint-Cybard, passe pour être le chemin emprunté par les fuyards. C'est donc âgée seulement d'une douzaine d'années que la jeune Isabelle d'Angoulême devient reine d'Angleterre.\n\nC’est à la suite de cet enlèvement2, que Jean sans Terre est condamné pour forfaiture et que la commise est prononcée sur ses biens du royaume de France, biens qui reviennent au roi de France, Philippe Auguste. À la mort de Jean sans Terre en 1216, tandis que son fils aîné devient roi d'Angleterre sous le nom d'Henri III, elle rentre en France et épouse le fils de son ancien fiancé Hugues X de LusignanN 2 en 1220.\n\nC'est sans doute sous son influence que Henri III d'Angleterre et Hugues de Lusignan organisent un front commun contre le roi de France Louis IX. Cependant ce dernier bat les coalisés à Taillebourg (dans l'actuel département de la Charente-Maritime) les 21 et 22 juillet 1242. À la suite de cette défaite Hugues de Lusignan se soumet au roi de France. Au cours de la rencontre, Isabelle, qui voulait toujours porter le titre de reine, aurait tenté de faire empoisonner sans succès Louis IX5.\n\nElle mourut en 1246 et fut d'abord enterrée dans une chapelle de l'abbaye Notre-Dame de La Couronne, appelée alors Saint-Nicolas5 avant d'être transférée à Fontevraud. -------------------- House House of Taillefer Father Aymer, Count of Angoulême Mother Alice of Courtenay Born c.1188 Died 4 June 1246 (aged c. 57–58) Fontevraud Abbey, France Burial Fontevraud Abbey\n\nQueen consort of England Reigning Countess of Angouleme\n\nIsabella of Angoulême (French: Isabelle d'Angoulême, IPA: [izab%C9%9Bl dɑ̃ɡulɛm]; c.1188 – 4 June 1246) was queen consort of England as the second wife of King John from 1200 until John's death in 1216. She was also reigning Countess of Angoulême from 1202 until 1246.\n\nShe had five children by the king including his heir, later Henry III. In 1220, Isabella married Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children.\n\nSome of her contemporaries, as well as later writers, claim that Isabella formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile for whom she had a deep-seated hatred.[1] In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the king. To avoid arrest, she sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey where she died two years later, but none of this can be confirmed. Queen of England[edit] She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême, by Alice of Courtenay, who was sister of Peter II of Courtenay, Latin Emperor of Constantinople and granddaughter of King Louis VI of France.\n\nIsabella became Countess of Angoulême in her own right on 16 June 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on 24 August 1200, in Angoulême[2], a year after he annulled his first marriage to Isabel of Gloucester. She was crowned queen in an elaborate ceremony on 9 October at Westminster Abbey in London. Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan,[3] son of the then Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands, and armed conflict ensued.\n\nAt the time of her marriage to John, the blonde and blue-eyed 12-year-old Isabella was already renowned by some for her beauty[4] and has sometimes been called the Helen of the Middle Ages by historians.[5] Isabella was much younger than her husband and possessed a volatile temper similar to his own. King John was infatuated with his young, beautiful wife; However, his acquisition of her had as much, if not more to do with spiting his enemies, than romantic love. She was already engaged to Hugh IX le Brun, when she taken by John. It had been said that he neglected his state affairs to spend time with Isabella, often remaining in bed with her until noon. However, these were rumors, ignited by Johns enemies to discredit him as being a weak and grossly irresponsible ruler. Given that at the time they were made John was engaging in a desperate war with King Phillip of France to hold on to the remaining Plantagenet dukedoms. The common people began to term her a \"siren\" or \"Messalina\", which spoke volumes as to common opinion .[6] Her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aquitaine readily accepted her as John's wife.[7]\n\nOn 1 October 1207 at Winchester Castle, Isabella gave birth to a son and heir who was named Henry after the King's father, Henry II. He was quickly followed by another son, Richard, and three daughters, Joan, Isabel, and Eleanor. All five children survived into adulthood, and would make illustrious marriages; all but Joan would produce offspring of their own.\n\nSecond marriage[edit] When King John died in October 1216, Isabella's first act was to arrange the speedy coronation of her nine-year-old son at the city of Gloucester on 28 October. As the royal crown had recently been lost in The Wash, along with the rest of King John's treasure, she supplied her own golden circlet to be used in lieu of a crown.[8] The following July, less than a year after his crowning as King Henry III of England, she left him in the care of his regent, William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and returned to France to assume control of her inheritance of Angoulême.\n\nIn the spring of 1220, she married Hugh X of Lusignan, \"le Brun\", Seigneur de Luisignan, Count of La Marche, the son of Hugh IX, to whom she had been betrothed before her marriage to King John. It had been previously arranged that her eldest daughter Joan should marry Hugh, and the little girl was being brought up at the Lusignan court in preparation for her marriage. Hugh, however, upon seeing Isabella, whose beauty had not diminished,[9] preferred the girl's mother. Princess Joan was provided with another husband, King Alexander II of Scotland, whom she wed in 1221.\n\nIsabella had married Hugh without waiting to receive the consent of the King's council in England, which was the required procedure for a former Queen of England, as the Council had the power to not only choose the Queen Dowager's second husband, but to decide whether or not she should be allowed to marry at all. Isabella's flouting of this law caused the Council to confiscate her dower lands and stop the payment of her pension.[10] Isabella and her husband retaliated by threatening to keep Princess Joan, who had been promised in marriage to the King of Scotland, in France. The council first responded by sending furious letters, signed in the name of young King Henry, to the Pope, urging him to excommunicate Isabella and her husband, but then decided to come to terms with Isabella, as to avoid conflict with the Scottish king, who was eager to receive his bride. Isabella was granted, in compensation for her dower lands in Normandy, the stannaries in Devon and the revenue of Aylesbury for a period of four years. She also received £3000 as payment for arrears in her pension.[11]\n\nBy Hugh X, Isabella had nine more children. Their eldest son Hugh XI of Lusignan succeeded his father as Count of La Marche and Count of Angoulême in 1249.\n\nIsabella's children from her past marriage continued their lives in England.\n\nRebellion and death[edit] Described by some contemporaries as \"vain, capricious, and troublesome,\"[12] Isabella could not reconcile herself with her less prominent position in France. Though Queen dowager of England, Isabella was now mostly regarded as a mere Countess of La Marche and had to give precedence to other women.[13] In 1241, when Isabella and Hugh were summoned to the French court to swear fealty to King Louis IX of France's brother, Alphonse, who had been invested as Count of Poitou, their mother, the Queen Dowager Blanche openly snubbed her. This so infuriated Isabella, who had a deep-seated hatred of Blanche due to the latter having fervently supported the French invasion of England during the First Barons' War in May 1216, that she began to actively conspire against King Louis. Isabella and her husband, along with other disgruntled nobles, including her son-in-law Raymond VII of Toulouse, sought to create an English-backed confederacy which united the provinces of the south and west against the French king.[14] In 1244, after the confederacy had failed and Hugh had made peace with King Louis, two royal cooks were arrested for attempting to poison the King; upon questioning they confessed to having been in Isabella's pay.[15] Before Isabella could be taken into custody, she fled to Fontevraud Abbey, where she died on 4 June 1246.[16]\n\nBy her own prior arrangement, she was first buried in the Abbey's churchyard, as an act of repentance for her many misdeeds. On a visit to Fontevraud, her son King Henry III of England was shocked to find her buried outside the Abbey and ordered her immediately moved inside. She was finally placed beside Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Afterwards, most of her many Lusignan children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of Henry, their half-brother.\n\nIssue[edit] With King John of England: 5 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including: King Henry III of England (1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272).

Geoffrey of Lusignan (c. 1226 – 1274). Married in 1259 Jeanne, Viscountess of Châtellerault, by whom he had issue. Isabella of Lusignan (c.1226/1227 14 January 1299). Married firstly before 1244 Maurice IV, seigneur de Craon (1224–1250),[17] by whom she had issue; she married secondly, Geoffrey de Rancon.[18] William of Lusignan (c. 1228 – 1296). 1st Earl of Pembroke. Married Joan de Munchensi, by whom he had issue. Marguerite de Lusignan (c. 1229 – 1288). Married firstly in 1243 Raymond VII of Toulouse; secondly c. 1246 Aimery IX de Thouars, Viscount of Thouars and had issue\n\nIsabella of Angoulême was the daughter and heiress of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême and Alice of Courtenay, who was sister of Peter II of Courtenay, Emperor of Constantinople and granddaughter of King Louis VI of France.\n\nIsabella had been betrothed to Hugh de Lusignan, Count of La Marche, although the marriage had been delayed because of her extreme youth. A renowned beauty, reputed to have had blonde hair and blue eyes, it is said that King John of England became infatuated with Isabella, then twelve years old. The unprincipled John stole the enchanting Isabella from under Hugh's very nose, which resulted in King Philip II of France confiscating John's French lands, and the entire de Lusignan family rebelling against him.\n\nHis first marriage to Isabella of Gloucester had been declared invalid, since they were related within the prohibited degrees. Isabella's marriage to King John took place on 24th August 1200, at Bordeaux. She was crowned Queen of England on 9th October at Westminster Abbey. It was said that John was so besotted with his young bride that he refused to rise from bed until well after noon. Isabella was far younger than her husband but was possessed a volatile temper to match his own, resulting in a tempestuous marriage. Both took lovers and Matthew Paris referred to Isabella as 'more Jezebel than Isabel'.\n\nHugh de Lusignan, Isabella's slighted fiancee, had sought redress from his overlord Phillip Augustus, who promptly summoned John to the French court to answer for his actions. John refused to comply and accordingly, Phillip, acting under feudal law, claimed those territories ruled by John as Count of Poitou and declaring all John's French territories except Gascony forfeit, he invaded Normandy. Chateau Gaillard, Richard the Lionheart's impregnable castle, fell to the French after a long siege in 1203, it was followed by the rest of Normandy. John, his resources exhausted, was forced to flee the smoking rubble of his father's once great French Empire.\n\nKing John tomb effigy at Worcester Isabella became Countess of Angoulême in her own right on 16 June 1202. She gave birth to a son and heir, Henry, seven years after her marriage to John, on 1st October 1207 at Winchester Castle. Another son, Richard, later Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans was born on 5th January 1209. Three daughters were to follow, Joan, later Queen of Scots, was born on 22 July 1210, Isabel, later Holy Roman Empress in 1214 and Eleanor, later Countess of Pembroke in 1215.\n\nJohn died at Newark on the wild stormy night of 18th October, 1216, leaving England in a state of anarchy and civil war. Isabella and John's nine-year-old son Henry, described as being a \"pretty little knight\" was crowned King Henry III at the Abbey Church of Gloucester with a circlet belonging to his mother since his father had previously lost the royal treasure in the Wash.\n\nThe highly capable William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, was appointed Regent along with Hubert de Burgh. At the time of King John's death, London and most of the channel ports were held by the French. In a popular move, Marshall announced his intention to rule by the terms of Magna Carta, the French invaders were driven out and peace restored in England. Less than a year after his coronation, still a young woman, Isabella left her son in the care of William Marshal and returned to France to assume control of her inheritance of Angoulême.\n\nSeal of Isabella of AngoulemeArrangements were made to marry John and Isabella's eldest daughter, Joan to Hugh X of Lusignan, \"le Brun\", Count of La Marche, to whom Isabella herself had been betrothed in her youth. As was the custom at the time, Joan was being brought up at the Lusignan court in preparation for her marriage. Hugh, however, upon seeing Isabella, whose beauty had not diminished, preferred the girl's mother. In the spring of 1220, she married Hugh X of Lusignan, Princess Joan was narried instead to King Alexander II of Scotland in 1221.\n\nIsabella had married Hugh without the consent of her son the King's council in England, which was then required procedure for a former Queen of England. The Council reacted by confiscating her dower lands and stopped the payment of her pension as a Queen Dowager of England. Isabella and Hugh retaliated by threatening to retain custody of Princess Joan, now betrothed to the King of Scots. Terms were finally agreed on and Isabella recieved compensation for her dower lands in Normandy and payment for arrears in her pension.\n\nHugh de LusignanIsabella had nine more children by Hugh de Lusignan. Described as \"vain, capricious, and troublesome\" by a contemporary, Isabella was summoned to the French court with her husband in 1241 to swear fealty to King Louis IX of France's brother, Alphonse, who had been invested as Count of Poitou. Their mother, Blanche, Queen Dowager of France and a cousin of King John, openly snubbed her. Isabella already bore a deep-seated hatred of Blanche, due to her active support of the French invasion of England in May 1216. Isabella, seething and infuriated, began to actively conspire against King Louis. Isabella and her husband, united forces with her son-in-law Raymond VII of Toulouse against the French king, which failed.\n\nTwo royal cooks were arrested for attempting to poison the King of France in 1244, under questioning they confessed to having been in the pay of Isabella. She fled to Fontevrault Abbey, where she remained for two years. Isabella died on 31 May 1246. At her own request, she was first buried in the churchyard of the Abbey, as an act of repentance for her sins. Her second husband, Hugh de Lusignan died three years later on crusade. Her son Hugh XI of Lusignan succeeded his father as Count of La Marche and Count of Angoulême in 1249. Many Lusignan children left France to find positions at the court of Henry III, their half-brother.\n\nOn a visit to Fontevrault, King Henry III of England was shocked to find his mother buried outside the Abbey and ordered her moved inside, were she was re-interred beside John's parents, Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nCourtesy of fantastically full family tree cf.:\n\nHughes of Gwerclas 1/2/3/4:\n\nhttp://www.maximiliangenealogy.co.uk/burke1/Royal%20Descents/hughes...\n\nhttp://www.maximiliangenealogy.co.uk/burke1/Royal%20Descents/hughes...\n\nhttp://www.maximiliangenealogy.co.uk/burke1/Royal%20Descents/hughes...\n\nhttp://www.maximiliangenealogy.co.uk/burke1/Royal%20Descents/hughes...\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_of_Angoulême\n\nIsabella of Angoulême (French : Isabelle d'Angoulême; 1188 - 31 May 1246) was Countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England . Queen of England She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer , Count of Angoulême , by Alice de Courtenay . Her paternal grandparents were William IV of Angoulême , Count of Angouleme and Marguerite de Turenne. Her maternal grandparents were Pierre de Courtenay and Elizabeth de Courtenay. Her maternal great-grandfather was King Louis VI of France . She became Countess of Angoulême in her own right in 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on 24 August 1200, at Bordeaux , a year after he annulled his first marriage to Isabel of Gloucester .

At the time of her marriage to John, the 12-year-old Isabella was already renowned for her beauty and has sometimes been called the Helen of the Middle Ages by historians. However, her marriage to John cannot be said to have been successful, in part because she was much younger than her husband and had a fiery character to match his. Second marriage When John died in 1216, Isabella was still in her twenties. She returned to France and in 1220, proceeded to marry Hugh X of Lusignan Count of La Marche . It is unclear whether it had been Hugh X or his father to whom Isabella had been betrothed before her marriage to King John. By Hugh X, Isabella had nine more children. Their eldest son Hugh XI of Lusignan succeeded his father as Count of La Marche and Count of Angouleme in 1249.
