        "text": "King John\n\nThe Worst English King?\n\nWhen I was a little I loved watching Disney films and one of my favourite was Robin Hood (1973). I absolutely loved that version, seeing all the characters played by animals that reflected their personalities. In the tale of Robin Hood John highlights the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the evil Sheriff of Nottingham but Disney portrays John as a \"cowardly, thumb sucking lion\".\n\nJohn was born in Beaumont Palace in Oxford on Christmas Eve in 1166 to Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eleanor never took to John but Henry adored him and made him Lord of Ireland in 1177.\n\nJohn was never meant to inherit anything. He had three older brothers, Henry, Richard and Geoffrey. Instead when he was older him and his sister Joan were sent to to Fontevrault Abbey where he would be steered into a career in the church.\n\nNeither parent took a major part in John's upbringing as they were fighting each other so maybe Fontevrault Abbey was the best place for him. A teacher was given the charge of the young Prince's early education and managing the servants of his immediate household. John spent some time as a member of the household of his elder brother Henry, where he learnt how to hunt and military skills. John enjoyed reading and, built up a travelling library of books but he also enjoyed gambling, in particular at backgammon, and was an enthusiastic hunter. John was a \"connoisseur of jewels\", owning a large collection, and became famous for his opulent clothes and for his fondness for bad wine. As he grew up, he became known for sometimes being \"genial, witty, generous and hospitable\"; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, \"biting and gnawing his fingers\" in anger.\n\nPrincess Isabelle of Gloucester in Robin Hood (2010)\n\nHenry II wanted to keep the empire he had built up for his family secure so he decided to betroth John to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy and as part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piemonte, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert while Henry transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into the young boy's hands even though he was five years old so his father would continue to control them. But John's brother Henry was unimpressed by this; although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in England, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation. From 1173 to 1174 the John's brothers and mother fought his father.\n\nJohn had spent the conflict with his father, and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire as part of the Montlouis settlement. In 1175 he appropriated the estates of the late Earl of Cornwall and gave them to John and the next year, Henry disinherited Mabel and\n\nAmice FitzWilliam, and betrothed John to their now extremely wealthy sister Isabelle.\n\nYoung Henry died in 1183 from the bloody flux and soon Geoffrey followed in 1186 after being trampled to death in tournament in Paris. John was two steps from being King. In 1189 Henry died leaving Richard as King of England but Richard hardly spent any time in England as he was always on a crusade.\n\nOn 29 August 1189 John and Isabelle were married at Marlborough Castle in Wiltshire and John assumed the title of Duke of Gloucester but the Archbishop of Canterbury declared the marriage null because they were within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity as half-second cousins as great-grandchildren of King Henry I. The interdict was lifted by Pope Clement III who granted a dispensation to marry but forbade the couple from having sexual relations.\n\nWhen John came to the throne in 1199 he had the marriage annulled on the grounds of consanguinity and was granted by the bishops of Lisieux, Bayeux and Avranches sitting in Normandy. John kept her Isabelle's lands, and Isabel did not contest the annulment."
