        "text": "01\n\nof 06\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine's Descendants Through John, King of England\n\nJohn, King of England (1166 – 1216), married twice. John is noted for his signing of the Magna Carta. John was the youngest child of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II, and was called Lackland because his older brothers had been given territories to rule and he'd been given none.\n\nHis first wife, Isabella of Gloucester (about 1173 – 1217), was, like John, a great-grandchild of Henry I. They married in 1189 and, after much trouble with the church over consanguinity, and after John became King, the marriage was annulled in 1199 and John kept her land. Her lands were returned to her in 1213 and she married again in 1214, her second husband, Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, dying in 1216. She then married Hubert de Burgh in 1217, dying herself a month later. She and John had no children – the church had first challenged the marriage then agreed to let it stand if they had no sexual relations.\n\nIsabella of Angoulême was John’s second wife. She had five children with John and nine in her next marriage. John's five children -- grandchildren of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II -- in his second marriage are listed on the following pages.\n\n02\n\nof 06\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine's Descendants Through Henry III, King of England\n\nHenry III: the eldest grandchild of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II through their son John was King Henry III of England (1207 – 1272). He married Eleanor of Provence. One of Eleanor’s sisters married another son of John and Isabella, and two of her sisters married sons of Henry III’s cousin, Blanche, who had married the King of France.\n\nHenry III and Eleanor of Provence had five children; Henry was noted for having no illegitimate children.\n\n1. Edward I, King of England (1239 – 1307). He was married twice.\n\nWith his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, Edward I had 14 to 16 children, with six surviving to adulthood, a son and five daughtes.\n\nHis only surviving son by Eleanor was Edward II. Among Edward II’s four children was Edward III.\n\nEleanor (1269 – 1298), married Henry III, Count of Bar.\n\nJoan of Acre (1272 – 1307), married first Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, then Ralph de Monthermer.\n\nMary of Woodstock (1279 – 1332) was a Benedictine nun.\n\nElizabeth of Rhuddlan (1282 – 1316) married John I, Count of Holland, then Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford.\n\nWith his second wife, Margaret of France, Edward I had a daughter who died in childhood and two surviving sons.\n\nThomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk (1300 – 1338), married twice.\n\nEdmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent (1301 – 1330), married Margaret Wake. Margaret was a descendant of Edward I’s grandfather King John via John’s illegitimate daughter Joan, who married Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales\n\n2. Margaret (1240 – 1275), married Alexander III of Scotland. They had three children.\n\nMargaret married King Eric II of Norway\n\nAlexander, Prince of Scotland, married to Margaret of Flanders, died childless when he was only 20\n\nDavid died when he was nine.\n\nThe death of the young prince Alexander led to the recognition as Alexander III's heir the daughter of King Eric II and the younger Margaret, yet a third Margaret -- Margaret, Maid of Norway, granddaughter of Alexander III. Her early death led to a succession controversy.\n\n3. Beatrice (1242 – 1275) married John II, Duke of Brittany. They had six children. Arthur II succeeded as Duke of Brittany. John of Brittany became the Earl of Richmond.\n\n4. Edmund (1245 – 1296), known as Edmund Crouchback, married twice. His first wife, Aveline de Forz, 11 when they married, died at 15, perhaps in childbirth. His second wife, Blanche of Artois, was the mother of three children with Edmund. Thomas and Henry in turn each succeeded their father as Earl of Lancaster.\n\nJohn, who died in France, married a widow and had no children.\n\nThomas, married to Alice de Lacy, died without legitimate children.\n\nHenry had seven children with Maud Chaworth, most of whom had children. Henry’s son, Henry of Grosmont, succeeded his father and married his daughter to Edward III’s son John of Gaunt. Henry’s daughter Mary of Lancaster was the mother of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland.\n\n5. Katherine (1253 – 1257)\n\n03\n\nof 06\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine's Descendants Through Richard, Earl of Cornwall\n\nRichard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans (1209 – 1272), was the second son of King John and his second wife, Isabella of Angoulême.\n\nRichard married three times. His first wife was Isabel Marshal (1200 - 1240). His second wife, married 1242, was Sanchia of Provence (about 1228 - 1261). She was the sister of Eleanor of Provence, wife of Richard's brother Henry III, two of four sisters who married kings. Richard's third wife, married 1269, was Beatrice of Falkenburg (about 1254 - 1277). He had children in his first two marriages.\n\n1. John (1232 – 1232), son of Isabel and Richard\n\n2. Isabel (1233 – 1234), daughter of Isabel and Richard\n\n3. Henry (1235 – 1271), son of Isabel and Richard, known as Henry of Almain, murdered by their cousins Guy and Simon (the Younger) Montfort\n\n4. Nicholas (1240 – 1240), son of Isabel and Richard\n\n5. Unnamed son (1246 – 1246), son of Sanchia and Richard\n\n6. Edmund (about 1250 – about 1300), also called Edmund of Almain, son of Sanchia and Richard. Married Margaret de Clare in 1250, marriage dissolved in 1294; they had no children.\n\nOne of Richard's illegitimate children, Richard of Cornwall, was an ancestor of the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk.\n\n04\n\nof 06\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine's Descendants Through Joan of England\n\nA third child of John and Isabella of Angoulême was Joan (1210 – 1238). She had been promised to Hugh of Lusignan, in whose household she was raised, but her mother married Hugh on John's death.\n\nShe was then returned to England where she was wed at 10 to King Alexander II of Scotland.
