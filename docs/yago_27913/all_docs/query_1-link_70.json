        "text": "Isabella [Isabella Bigod] (b. / , d. ), princess and countess of Norfolk, was the second daughter of William the Lion, king of Scots, and his queen Ermengarde de Beaumont. She was probably born in / ; in William backed away from a scheme for his daughter Margaret to succeed him because Ermengarde was pregnant. The child, if it survived, must have been Isabella, since her brother Alexander, the future King Alexander II, was not born until .\n\nTheir youth notwithstanding, Isabella and Margaret were soon caught up in high politics, for under the terms of the Treaty of Norham of they were handed over to King John, along with thirteen hostages. Margaret was to be married to John’s son Henry, and Isabella, after a year or two, to an English noble of rank, possibly Henry’s brother, Richard. In fact John had little to gain by marrying the Scottish princesses to his own sons, and despite the treaty they remained in his custody, unmarried. Payments for their upkeep are recorded as being made by sheriffs and also directly from John’s wardrobe, suggesting that there were periods when Isabella was living at John’s court. In she was lodged at Corfe Castle with John’s queen, Isabella of Angoulême, and his captive niece, Eleanor of Brittany.\n\nAfter William the Lion’s death in , the position of his sisters was a factor in Alexander II’s decision to join the baronial rebellion against King John, the issue being addressed explicitly in clause 59 of Magna Carta, in which John undertook to deal with the restoration of the princesses and hostages. Alexander continued to press for an improvement in their situation after John’s death in , finally agreeing with Henry III’s minority council on that Margaret and Isabella would be married by or else returned to Scotland. Margaret was controversially married to Hubert de Burgh on , but Isabella went back to Scotland in .\n\nAlexander II clearly wanted to arrange an advantageous marriage for Isabella. A letter of Henry III suggests that a match had been proposed for her with William (II) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, but in she finally married Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, at Alnwick. Roger was some years off his majority, but despite the age gap (Isabella was perhaps seventeen years her husband’s senior) Alexander was keen enough on the match to levy an aid of 10,000 marks (£6,666 13s. 4d.) from his nobles in towards the costs of his sisters’ marriages, as well as paying £1,000 to Henry in support of the following year’s English expedition to Gascony. Then in Alexander also purchased the wardship of his young brother-in-law, after which Roger and Isabella moved to Scotland, where they lived at court until Roger entered into his inheritance in .\n\nThereafter Roger was often active at Henry III’s court, but Isabella remains a shadowy figure. The marriage was childless and from the mid-1240s Roger made protracted but unsuccessful attempts to have it annulled; although he cited consanguinity, there can be no doubt that his motivation was the desire to have heirs. However, the ecclesiastical judgment went against him, and in he was obliged to take Isabella back, having previously separated from her. Matthew Paris records that he accepted this with good grace, blaming his earlier actions on ‘evil counsel’ (Paris, Chron., 5, 382–3).\n\nIsabella died in . A writ of her husband’s shows that she was still alive in February of that year, but she certainly predeceased Roger, who died on 3 or 4 July following. She was buried at the London Blackfriars church, also the resting place of her older and younger sisters and of her older sister’s husband, Hubert de Burgh, but Roger was buried in Thetford in Norfolk. However, his and Isabella’s hearts were apparently buried together at the parish church of Framlingham, on the Bigod family estate.\n\nThe sisters whom Isabella accompanied in death included Margaret [Margaret Marshal] (d. ), princess and countess of Pembroke, who was also called Marjorie, to distinguish her from her eldest sister, another Margaret. She was probably born much later than William and Ermengarde’s other children, towards the end of her father’s life. During her youth there seem to have been failed plans for matches with Thibault IV, count of Champagne and Brie (also a minor) in , and with Richard, earl of Cornwall, Henry III’s younger brother, in . Her mother was closely involved in the negotiations on both occasions.\n\nAlthough Alexander II issued a charter formalizing Margaret’s marriage portion in , several years passed before she was finally married, at Berwick in or , to Gilbert Marshal, earl of Pembroke, ‘with the [English] king’s good will and licence … and the marriage is well pleasing to the king’ (CPR, 1232–47, 126). Along with a royal bride, Gilbert received ‘a noble dowry in Scotland, as well as ten thousand marks and more’ (Ann. mon., 3, 143).\n\nGilbert Marshal died at an illegal tournament on , leaving his wife a childless widow. Henry III acted to ensure that Margaret received her dower lands, and made her gifts of deer and wine, while Margaret herself litigated in defence of her dower rights, suing in in the court coram rege against Walter Marshal, the new earl of Pembroke, and securing from him a settlement of her claims.\n\nGilbert was buried with his Marshal kin at the Temple Church in London, but when Margaret died, on , she was buried in the city’s Blackfriars, where she was later joined by her two older sisters. This suggests that despite their differing paths the sisters had maintained strong bonds. It is remarkable that, for a brief period in the 1230s, not only was Alexander II himself married to the sister of the king of England, but his three legitimate sisters were married to some of the most important men in the English kingdom. It is equally noteworthy that none of these sororal matches provided heirs who could have strengthened Anglo-Scottish connections."
