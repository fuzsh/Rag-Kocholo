        "text": "1167 - 1216\n\nRelationship to me: Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Grandfather Gen -25 Born: 24 Dec 1167 Died: 18 Oct 1216 Age 48 Father: King Henry II 1133 - 1189 Mother: Eleanor of Acquatine (m. 1152) c.1122 - 1204 Brothers: (elder) King Richard I Sisters: Married: Isabella, daughter of Aymer Taillefer m.24/8/1200 c.1187 - 1246 Children: King Henry III 1207 - 1272\n\nSee http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon28.html for further information on King John.\n\nAccording to information passed on to me by Ian Caldwell, in Dec 2001: \"John, King of England= (1)Isabella daughter of William, Earl of Gloucester\n\nb. 1167 r.1199-1216; m.29/8/1189, divorced 1199, no children d.18/10/1216; = (2) Isabella (c.1187-1246), daughter of Aymer Taillefer, count of Angouleme: m.24/8/1200: 5 children.\n\nJohn was the youngest and favourite son of Henry II and Eleanor. His mother was 45 when he was born and had already had nine children, thus he had no inheritance at first and was known as Lackland. He behaved badly when he was sent to Ireland by his father, tugging the Irish kings long beards and insulting them when they came to pay homage, so Henry wisely recalled him. When (his elder brother) King Richard I died John was accepted as king of England, but not by the Angevin territories in France, who preferred his nephew, Arthur of Brittany.\n\nJust over a year after his coronation he divorced his wife and married Isabella of Angouleme. Their marriage was tempestuous - both being highly sexed and strong-willed, they were well matched, but it was to be JohnÂ¹s downfall. She was already betrothed to Hugh de Luisignan, who complained to Philippe of France. He summoned John to answer his case, but John refused, enabling Philippe to confiscate all of John's lands in France.\n\nJohn needed resources to fight to get his lands back and taxed those barons scutage who would not go and fight for him. This annoyed the barons but amused John, who had a good sense of humour and enjoyed anything that ridiculed or deflated pomposity, and he was popular with many of his subjects as he often found in their favour against the barons. John's refusal to accept the new archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, resulted in the pope excommunicating John. Rather than being a problem for John he saw this as a new source of income as he then took the opportunity to confiscate church revenues, providing funds for his campaign. Apart from fighting in France, John waged successful campaigns in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, defeating Llywelyn the Great in 1211. He was planning a further campaign in 1212 when he heard rumours of a planned invasion by Philippe of France and rebellion by his barons. He used his cunning to secure his position by negotiating with Pope Innocent III a lifting of the papal interdict on the basis that John would hold his lands as a fifedom of the papacy. After this the pope supported John in his actions against the barons and even against Philippe."
