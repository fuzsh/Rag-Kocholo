        "text": "Yesterday was International Women’s Day. A day to commemorate the role women play in international society and to try and accelerate the slow progress to female equality.\n\nWith Brexit pending it is also a good time to show how British society has been helped by the impact made by international women. There is no doubt that the integration of women from different cultures has helped to change Britain for the better.\n\nBut as a historian I wondered how International Women’s Day would be celebrated in the thirteenth century. How did some incredible women manage to weave their personalities into such a male dominated society and why are their stories so little told compared to the men they supposedly served?\n\nIn an earlier blog I wrote about the greatest of all medieval women, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who just about qualifies as a thirteenth century international woman as she died in 1204.\n\nOne of her greatest achievements was securing both the English throne and the duchy of Aquitaine for her son, John. Her death robbed him of one of his greatest advisors and may have helped prevent some of the excesses which cost him his French lands and almost his throne.\n\nI now want to tell the stories of two more remarkable women, Isabella of Angouleme and Blanche of Castile. Isabella was Eleanor’s daughter in law, Blanche her granddaughter. Their fortunes were intertwined throughout the first half of the century and both had a significant impact on the fortunes of England.\n\nLike Joan, Isabella was forced to move to a new country at the age of just 12 when she married King John, even though she was already betrothed to Hugh IX of neighbouring Lusignan. She wasn’t involved much in English rule but when John died in the midst of civil war in 1216, she moved quickly along with the regent William Marshal and the papal legate Guala to ensure that her 9-year-old son Henry was crowned at Gloucester Cathedral.\n\nCrowing Henry gave him the legitimacy which Prince Louis, invited by the English rebels but excommunicated, never had and played a key role in the rebel barons returning to the King. The crown jewels were in enemy territory so Isabella lent Henry her gold coronet for the occasion.\n\nDespite this the regents were determined to exclude her from rule so, not content with a quiet retirement as dowager Queen, she returned home to rule as Countess of Angouleme. Remarkably in 1220, she married the son of her former fiancée, Hugh X, breaking his own betrothal to her 9-year-old daughter Joan.\n\nAlthough this was probably a more appropriate marriage, as Hugh was 7 years older than Isabella, she did it without the permission of the crown, which was required for a Queen. She resisted the refusal to pay her dowry by holding onto her spurned daughter and only releasing her when England paid not just her dowry but that owed for her daughter as well. When she returned to England the unfortunate Joan was forced into a rather miserable Scottish marriage instead.\n\nThe regents expected Isabella to support them as they attempted to maintain what was left of English lands in south western France but they underestimated the grudges she held against them for her exclusion and the reluctance to provide her with a financial settlement. She supported the French crown until her son came of age.\n\nIn the end it was only in 1241 that she was persuaded to change sides and then only because of her hatred of the dowager Queen of France.\n\nBlanche was the daughter of Eleanor, the 6th child of Henry II and Eleanor. She was born in 1188, probably the same year as Isabella, in Spain and was another twelve year old bride when she married Prince Louis of France in 1200 – at least in this case her husband was only a year older.\n\nWhen Louis was offered the English crown his father, Philip Augustus was reluctant to support his son because the Pope threatened ecclesiastical sanction if he invaded a papal fiefdom (John has made the Pope his liege lord in 1213). Blanche stepped up, first persuading Philip to provide financial support and then establishing herself in Calais to support Louis.\n\nShe recruited troops to reinforce him as the regents started to win support back in England and she was responsible for two fleets for organising two fleets. The second of these fleets was defeated at Sandwich shortly after Louis’s troops had been beaten in the battle of Lincoln. England was saved but Blanche had created a life long enemy in Isabella for trying to take the throne of her husband and son.\n\nBlanche became Queen of France in 1223 but Louis died just 3 years later of dysentery at just 36. Like Isabella she had no intention of retiring as Queen Dowager although she did become regent for her twelve year old son, Louis IX.\n\nIt was not an easy job, many of the southern nobles were in revolt and Blanche was forced to raise armies to fight them. She was nearly captured south of Paris but appealed to the people who rallied to protect the young king. She then counterattacked and three years later, her army forced the nobles to recognise Louis.\n\nShe was then threatened by Henry III, who invaded in 1230, but once again she stood firm and resisted his attempt to advance from Aquitaine. The English made little progress and Louis owed his throne to his mother.\n\nIsabella and Hugh were kept onside by concessions in Poitou and the poor relationship between the Countess and the English ministers but the hatred between the two started came out in 1241. Isabella was unhappy to be summoned to Paris to pay homage to Louis’ brother Alphonse who was invested as Count of neighbouring Poitou.\n\nNot only was this a direct threat to Isabella and Hugh but they were made to wait three days to pay homage and were snubbed completely by the French Queen. Angry at their treatment they burned their lodgings and appealed for help to her sons, Henry and Richard of Cornwall, who was recognised in England as Duke of Poitou. The English nobles refused to pay for the campaign and they were only able to launch an ineffective campaign to defend his mother.\n\nFaced with arrest, Isabella was fled to Fontevraud Abbey where she died on 4 June 1246. She was eventually buried in the abbey alongside Henry II, Eleanor and Richard I. With her defeat many of her Lusignan children sailed to England to join Henry’s court.\n\nShe was outlived by her nemesis, Blanche, who became regent again in 1248 when her son was away on crusade. Despite Louis’ disastrous campaign she maagaed to keep control in France until his return but died in November 1252 and was buried in the abbey she founded at Maubuisson.\n\nTwo remarkable women, who also managed to bear 27 children between them (13 to Blanche and Louis, Isabella had 5 with John and 9 with Hugh). Their influence on England and France continued with the close relationship between their sons Louis and Henry.\n\nInternational Women’s Day would have been interesting in the thirteenth century!"
