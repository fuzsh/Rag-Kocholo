        "text": "Isabella of Gloucester, daughter of Earl William, is most well known for her marriage to John, the youngest son of King Henry II. Even before the marriage, the betrothal was very beneficial to John; after the betrothal he was recognized as the heir to Gloucester. Unfortunately, as King Henry I’s grandchildren and thus cousins, John and Isabella were too closely related for the marriage to be sanctioned by the church. Nevertheless, their parents circumvented this precedent.\n\nThe two were wed at Marlborough Castle in 1189, in part so that John could secure his position as a major contender for the next King of England after his brother Richard. This caused immediate problems. The Archbishop of Canterbury demanded that John justify himself, but he chose not to do so, which was sufficient to get Pope Clement III to intervene. Unfortunately for the church, the Archbishop died before anything could come of the matter, but the scandal continued to weigh on the country. It eventually became clear that John himself wasn’t terribly fond of Isabella, but he still wanted to keep her around for strategic purposes. Once Richard died and John inherited the throne, he almost immediately (and rather ironically) requested he be granted an annulment on the grounds of blood relations, which the Church granted. This made Isabella one of only five women who were married to future British monarchs but who never saw the throne themselves.\n\nBibliography\n\n“Confessions of a Ci-Devant.” The Uncrowned Queen of Ireland: The Life of Isabel of Gloucester.
