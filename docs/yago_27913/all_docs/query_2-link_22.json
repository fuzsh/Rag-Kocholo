        "text": "A portrait John I of England\n\nII\n\nRichard died on 6 April 1199 in the arms of his mother; it was later said that \"As the day was closing, he ended his earthly day.\" Because of the nature of Richard's death, he was later referred to as \"the Lion (that) by the Ant was slain\". According to one chronicler, Richard's last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain Mercadier had the crossbowman flayed alive and hanged as soon as Richard died, John was chosen as the heir rather than Arthur the rightful heir.\n\nThe Treaty of Le Goulet was signed by the kings John of England and Philip II of France in May 1200 and aimed to ultimately settle the claims the Angevin kings of England had on French lands. Hence, it aimed to bring an end to the war over the Duchy of Normandy and finalise the new borders of what was left of the duchy, as well as the future relationship of the king of France and the dukes of Normandy. The treaty was a victory for Philip as it asserted his legal claims to overlordship over John's French lands.\n\nThe terms of the treaty signed at le Goulet, on the Gueuleton island in the middle of the Seine river near Vernon in Normandy, included clarifications of the feudal relationships binding the monarchs. Philip recognised John as King of England, heir of his brother Richard I, and thus formally abandoned his prior support for Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, the son of John's late brother, Geoffrey II of Brittany. John, meanwhile, formally recognised the new status of the lost Norman territories by acknowledging the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders as vassals of the kings of France, not those of England, and recognised Philip as the suzerain of the continental lands in the Angevin Empire. John also bound himself not to support any rebellions on the part of the counts of Boulogne and Flanders.\n\nPhilip had previously recognised John as suzerain of Anjou and the Duchy of Brittany, but with the treaty of le Goulet he extorted 20,000 marks sterling in payment for recognition of John's sovereignty of Brittany.\n\nThe Duchy of Aquitaine was not included in the treaty. It was still held by John as heir to his still-living mother, Eleanor. The treaty was sealed with a marriage alliance between the Angevin and Capetian dynasties. John's niece Uraque(Uracca), daughter of his sister Leonora and Alfonso VIII of Castile, married Philip's eldest son, Louis VIII of France (to be eventually known as Louis the Lion). The marriage alliance only assured a strong regent for the minority of Louis IX of France. Philip declared John deposed from his fiefs for failure to obey a summons in 1202 and war broke out again. Philip moved quickly to seize John's lands in Normandy, strengthening the French throne in the process.\n\nThe new peace would only last for two years; war recommenced in the aftermath of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nUnfortunately, Isabella was already engaged to Hugh of Lusignan, an important member of a key Poitou noble family and brother of Count Raoul of Eu, who possessed lands along the sensitive eastern Normandy border. Just as John stood to benefit strategically from marrying Isabella, so the marriage threatened the interests of the Lusignans, whose own lands currently provided the key route for royal goods and troops across Aquitaine. Rather than negotiating some form of compensation, John treated Hugh \"with contempt\"; this resulted in a Lusignan uprising that was promptly crushed by John, who also intervened to suppress Raoul in Normandy.\n\nAlthough John was the Count of Poitou and therefore the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – except for Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.\n\nOld Plantagenet Coat of Arms\n\nV\n\nThe death of Arthur would cause the permanent revocation of the fief of Anjou and Maine and Philippe Auguste would make it a part of the royal demesne\n\nA year after the death of Arthur in 1203, the le Goulet Treaty peace was revised again in a new treaty named the Treaty of Paris, in this treaty the King of England would split the inheritance of Aquitaine to another son, if John has only one son the son would only inherit the core parts of Aquitaine but the fiefs under Aquitaine would be vassals of the king of France directly and the remaining parts of Normandy would remain under John.\n\nEleanor of Brittany known as Helen or Eleonora in her duchy at this point have already have two children Helena(Eleanor) b. 1199 and Henry II of Austria b. 1202, the beautiful Helena of Austria would be betrothed and later married to the young Konrad the Curly, the duke of Glogow, making her an ancestor of the Polish, Hungarian and Scandanavian monarchs, Eleanor of Brittany and Frederick I of Austria would have two further children who survived infancy, Mathilde b. 1206 and Gottfried b. 1210, it would be the line of Frederick I and Eleanor of Brittany which would survive in the male line while Leopold his brother would die in the male line in the following generation.\n\nIn a year time Uracque, Queen of France would be pregnant with her first child, the pregnancy would be difficult at first, but she gave birth to a daughter named Eleanor b. 1204, named after her mother.\n\nLea Seydoux and as Isabelle of Angouleme in the movie Robinhood\n\nVI\n\nOn 1200, Anna Kommene Angelina would remarry to Henry of Flanders, she would be a good marriage match as he would participate in the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 and would later inherit the Empire, she would bear a son just after the marriage with Henry of Flanders, her other possible fiancé Theodore Laskaris, the later founder of the Empire of Nicea would marry Anne of France who was married twice to two Commenian Byzantine Emperors.\n\nOn 1203, Eleanor of Aquitaine would retire in Fontravraud and would disinherit John Lackland in the goading of Philippe Auguste in favor of the niece of John and Philippe, Alice of Jerusalem, the daughter of Henry II of Champagne after the death of Arthur, Alice of Jerusalem, the would marry William of Brunswick, William of Brunswick is the brother of the original planned Duke of Aquitaine, Otto the Holy Roman Emperor at that time, the marriage would be given a dispensation by Pope Innocent III.\n\nThe marriage between the 7-year-old Alice I of Aquitaine and William of Brunswick (William XI of Aquitaine) would be consummated in the latter part of 1210’s.\n\nThe marriage and inheritance arrangement an unexpected betrayal on the side of John and this would also prevent any sons of Eleanor, Duchess of Austria, because Alice is the chosen heir of Eleanor of Aquitaine not Eleanor, Duchess of Austria and due to that parts of Normandy would remain under the English Kings as a consolation, John would learn of this decision in the latter part of 1203 after the death of Arthur, confirmed by Philippe on 1204 in a letter and due to that the the nobles and counts inside of Aquitaine would not recognize John, this was an act of Betrayal on the side of John and because of that he had to divorce Isabelle of Angouleme in the same year as the notice of Philippe came because the marriage is already useless to him, she would marry her original betrothed, Hugh of Lusignan this was a long term victory for Arthur and Hugh of Lusignan.\n\nCharlize Theron as Queen Ingeborg in the movie Robinhood\n\nVII\n\nOn 1205, the Old King John, desperate for a heir would look for a new wife, a wife who would give him sons, someone unrelated to him, as the Princesses of Castile are his nieces, he would try to gain the hand of the Princess of Leon, Sanchia, the stepdaughter of his niece Berengaria, as she is the same age as Isabella but Berengaria would request that Constance of Portugal the maternal aunt of Sanchia be delivered out from her vows so that Constance can marry John instead on 1206, but none of this would prosper as Constance would remain to be a nun and John would set his eyes to Sanchia of Aragon, and his niece Blanca would be exchange of this marriage in 1207.\n\nSanchia was engaged to Ferdinand, the son of Alfonso VIII but Ferdinand would set aside his betrothal to Sanchia to marry Richeza of Sweden because the two are related in prohibited degrees, Sanchia was proposed as the wife Ferdinand by Ingeborg or Isambour, Queen of France, who gave birth to another son for Philip, Philip of France (b. 1208), Sanchia would end up as the wife of Alfonso II of Portugal in 1210, since Afonso II apparently fell in love with the beauty of Sanchia and because of that Sanchia became an issue on the Portuguese war of succession between Sanchia and Henry, the King of Leon, after her full brother, Ferdinand died.\n\nAfter the consummation of the marriage of Alice I of Aquitaine and Guilhem of Brunswick, Guilhem would die of consumption in 1217 and Alice would give birth to twin daughters named Eleanor and Marie 1215, forcing Alice to marry Henry of Castile in order to settle the dowry of Gascony by Eleanor of England, he is in his late teens at this point and Alice herself in her early twenties, Henry of Castile was her first cousin, and the second son of a King of Ferdinand of Castile, the marriage was given dispensation by the pope as well in the same way as her first.\n\nVIII\n\nWhile Henry VI’s army moved quickly south with his army, a pregnant Constance followed at a slower pace. On 26 December, the day after Henry's crowning at Palermo, she gave birth to a son, Frederick-Roger (the future Emperor and king of Sicily Frederick II) in the small town of Iesi, near Ancona.\n\nConstance was 40 after a marriage of 9 years in 1194, and she knew that many would question whether the child was hers. Thus, she had the baby in a pavilion tent in the market square of the town, and invited the town matrons to witness the birth. A few days later she returned to the town square and publicly breast-fed the infant, who is revealed to be girl, named Beatrice, named after her mother in law.\n\nBeatrice I of Sicily would inherit Sicily upon the death of her mother on 1200, she would be initially betrothed to the Welf Holy Roman Emperor but Richard Fitzjean, the bastard son of John I would end up as her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, In France Urracque would give birth to sons after she had given birth to her daughter Eleonore of France in 1204, the sons would be Philippe b. 1205, Alphonse b. 1208 and Louis b. 1212, Marie b. 1215 and Isabella b. 1222.\n\nMeanwhile Uracque and her cousin, the duchess of Austria would write letters after the Duchess of Austria sent letters to the King of France regarding her her claims to the Duchies, however Uracque developed a treaty which would have betrothed their children Henry of Austria and Eleanor of France and Mathilde of Austria with Philippe of France.\n\nSuch advice and treaty was appreciated by the duchess as her lineage would rule France and parts of the Duchy that she thinks that was rightfully hers and she would accept the treaty."
