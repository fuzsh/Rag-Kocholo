Regarding the United States, list the songs that never reached the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and/or never crossed over to the Top 40 Mainstream (CHR/POP) but that are certified GOLD.

Benny Benassi - Satisfaction

deadmau5 feat. Rob Swire - Ghost 'n' Stuff

Don't forget Benny Benassi's own "Cinema" which sold over a million, but I believe never charted.

Benny Benassi's "Cinema" is certified Platinum and peaked at #2 on the Bubbling under chart.

Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" has sold 2 (!) million but never charted on the Hot 100.

Christina Aguilera - "Just A Fool". Peaked at #71 and sold over 515k. Depending on your definition of "crossed over" it never went Top 40 on Pop. Unsure of its peak tho.

Madonna - Into The Groove (Certified Gold but something about the song being a B-side to the Maxi-single "Angel" so it was ineligible to chart.)

I don't even know there is a song called ANGEL by Madonna

:/

"Into The Groove" was the b-side to "Angel". "Angel" is certified Gold.

Actually, the "Angel"/"Into the Groove" 12-inch single is certified gold, not the 7-inch "Angel" (in which ITG did not appear). Variety charted ITG separately from "Angel" in its Singles Sales chart (where it spent six weeks at No. 1). Also, as we know, Billboard charted ITG on the R&B chart, where it was one of her four top 20 hits there.

BB apparently had some odd rule about 12-inc singles at the time; however, there had been 12-inch-only singles that had charted on the Hot 100 prior to 1985 (and then again in 1990, with "u Can't Touch This").

The Postal Service's "Such Great Heights" is another example.

That peaked at #63 on the Hot 100 though.

"Make You Feel My Love" then?

"Danza Kuduro" is 5x Platinum. It reached #82 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart but never went Top 40 on the CHR/POP chart.

Israel Kamakawiwoʻole's "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," which, incidentally, has sold more than 4 million and only certified platinum.

Post by YourFaveIsAFlop on

It made the Hot 100 (peaking at 58) but does anybody know how the hell Empire by Shakira is certified platinum? It peaked at #39 on streaming songs and #33 on sales (with total sales estimated at around 400k) There is no way that she got 60 million streams of the song in the US to make up the difference considering it only has 70 million views worldwide on YouTube and it never charted on On-Demand songs.

M83's Midnight City only peaked at #72 on the Hot 100 and never crossed over to CHR but was certified Platinum.

The OP says that this thread is for any song that didn't hit the Hot 100 so that eliminates like half of y'all.
