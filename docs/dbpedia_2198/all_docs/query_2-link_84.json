Five enjoyed remarkable success worldwide, particularly in the United Kingdom, throughout Europe, Asia, Australasia, North and South America. They split up on 27 September 2001, after selling over 20 million records worldwide, having 11 top ten singles and four top ten albums in the UK, selling out Arena tours, and picking up just about every achievable award including Brits and MTV.\n\nIn 2013, the band reunited, this time as part of The Big Reunion documentary series on ITV and now they are back in Ireland with the massive hits “Keep on Movin”, “Got the Feelin” and of course “Everybody Get Up” amongst many more!\n\nD:REAM\n\nVery few bands have a song that defined an era but D:REAM’s “Things can only get better” without a doubt sums up the 90’s and the duo of Pete Cunnah and Al McKenzie racked up another 8 UK Top 40 hits like “UR The Best Thing” and “Take Me Away”, Now back touring they’ve bring their full live show to the first Big Day Out!\n\nN-TRANCE\n\nN-Trance are coming to Limerick to ‘Set You Free’ with a catalogue of 6 million record sales worldwide.\n\n‘Stayin’ Alive’, ‘Set You Free’, ‘Forever’ and ‘Do Ya Think I’m Sexy’ are just a few of the renowned top ten hits that first catapulted N-Trance to fame over two decades ago. With international number one hits in Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, and the biggest selling dance record of 1995 under their belts, they have over 6 million record sales worldwide. It’s hardly surprising that double platinum selling band N-Trance still reign supreme on the dance floor whenever the thunder rolls… The iconic anthem ‘Set You Free’ has been setting dance floors on fire since 1992, even more so today than it ever did, evidenced by N-Trance’s ever busy tour schedule!\n\nMARK McCABE\n\nMark McCabe is an Irish Dance Music Icon. His single “Maniac 2000” marks a moment in time and has long achieved cult status, he put the “Oggy” into Irish Dance music.\n\nReleased over 20 years ago, the single reached Number One in the Irish Charts and stayed there for ten weeks, in fact it’s still the second biggest selling record in Ireland ever. This was only the start for Mark though, he has since had a thriving musical career both as an artist and on radio. He was signed with New York tribal house legends Twisted Records and remixed songs for some of the world’s biggest artists, most recently remixing Gavin James’ “Nervous”, along with releasing music under other aliases. He established himself as a DJ on pirate radio early in his career and he since blossomed in this side of his career too, highlights include editing RTE’S alternative station 2XM and becoming Director of Music and Sound at RTE 2FM. Highly sought after as a live performer Mark has travelled the world playing to fervent crowds including a jam packed set at Electric Picnic, that was the highlight of the weekend for many. It is not just in Ireland he is revered, he’s in demand all over the globe from Abu Dhabi to Sydney and regularly packs out venues. This to all intents and purposes is Mark’s prime time, but we’re sure the best is yet to come!\n\nMore events"
