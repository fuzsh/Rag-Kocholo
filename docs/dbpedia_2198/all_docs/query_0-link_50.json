On Friday, May 24th I added an additional 11,376 songs! I also now have a subscription with several karaoke labels such as SBI, Sunfly, Digitrax, Pridus and more! This means new karaoke music will be added to my library weekly. When it comes to professional Karaoke in Maine very few can compete with the services I provide. Not only do I have the newest karaoke music around but I maintain my high standards to quality, morality, and legality. If your DJ/KJ says they will download your song off the internet I ask you to take note that unless they are purchasing the song this is an illegal practice. Also notice if they are using CDs and be sure they are originals and not copies. What does it says about your DJ if they are stealing music? I will never use unlicensed music in any of my shows. You can feel safe knowing that I’ve purchased every song in my library and it will be of the highest quality. There is no need to worry that I will be shutdown for music piracy and/or copyright violations. No worries that your club or event will face legal actions. So sit back and enjoy my large assortment of music. I have something for everyone!\n\nDJ-BrianC\n\nwww.djbrianc.us\n\n(207) 212-6560\n\n[/toggle][/accordion]\n\n2012 Updates\n\n[accordion][toggle title=”September 19, 2012″]\n\nNew Karaoke\n\nYour Professional Maine Karaoke DJ is at it again.\n\nAlways updating our libraries for your enjoyment!\n\nI would like to announce I have just added 100 new karaoke songs to my karaoke library.
