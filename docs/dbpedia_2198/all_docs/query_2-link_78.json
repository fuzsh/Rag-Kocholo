        "text": "Originally posted by SuperDanX View Post\n\nAsh's last album 'Meltdown' which has really grown on me. Im a massive ASH fan and have been for teh years, but they do have a tendency to be a singles band rather than an album band, which is not a bad thing, except there albums tend to be 3 great tracks then a load of doosh. Meltdown is pretty groovy, all be it a grower. Evil Eye and Starcrossed being faves imo Tim Wheeler is a bit of a lyrical genuis when hes 'on'"
