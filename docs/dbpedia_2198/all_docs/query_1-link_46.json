        "meta_description": "Perfect Day is the second studio album released by German Eurodance act Cascada. The entire album was produced by the act's two DJs, Yanou and DJ Manian with vocals by Natalie Horler. Like its predecessor, the album is comprised heavily of uptempo Eurodance tracks, many of which are cover songs. This album, however, features covers of songs from the early to mid 2000s of the rock and country genres, with the exception of Because the Night which was released in 1978. Two edited tracks, \"Endless Summer\" and \"I Will Believe It\" that were previously recorded under the Siria name are also featured. Musically, the album is composed of Eurodance tracks with euphoric trance synths, drum programmings with a tempo over 140 beats per minute, and Europop lyrics. Lyrically, the songs are composed of love, partying and romance.",
