        "text": "Just added! N-Trance join lineup for The Big Day Out 90s vs 00s\n\nLimerick’s Gaelic Grounds - Saturday 31st August 2024\n\nTickets on sale now!\n\nAfter a euphoric performance of ‘Things Can Only Get Better’ by D:REAM on the last Late, Late Show of the year last Friday, The Big Day Out 90s vs 00s in Limerick’s Gaelic Grounds on Saturday 31st August has just added another huge 90s act to the already stacked lineup of Cascada, Basshunter, Five, D:Ream and Mark Mc Cabe. With an exclusive Irish performance and a Limerick debut for one of the biggest selling UK dance acts of the 1990s… N-Trance are coming to Limerick to ‘Set You Free’!\n\n‘Stayin' Alive’, ‘Set You Free’, ‘Forever’ and ‘Do Ya Think I’m Sexy’ are just a few of the renowned top ten hits that first catapulted N-Trance to fame over two decades ago. With international number one hits in Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, and the biggest selling dance record of 1995 under their belts, they have over 6 million record sales worldwide. It’s hardly surprising that double platinum selling band N-Trance still reign supreme on the dance floor whenever the thunder rolls… The iconic anthem ‘Set You Free’ has been setting dance floors on fire since 1992, even more so today than it ever did, evidenced by N-Trance’s ever busy tour schedule!\n\nThey join a host of 90s and 00s legends already on the lineup for the essential throwback festival of the summer. From the 90s, ‘Everybody Get Down’ as FIVE will be live on stage performing all their certified bangers. With hits like ‘Keep on Movin’ and ‘Slam Dunk (the Funk)’, the lads from London have toured the world, sold in excess of 15 million records worldwide and next summer they are coming to Limerick! And ‘Things Can Only Get Better’ with one of the most iconic dance acts ever D:REAM Live keeping the 90s party going!\n\nAfter nearly 20 years of filling dance floors across the world with hits like ‘Everytime We Touch’ and ‘Evacuate the Dancefloor’ dance sensations and heroes of the 00s CASCADA will be performing some of the world’s best party anthems. Glowsticks at the ready as Swedish DJ and producer BASSHUNTER, one of the world’s most in demand artists will be pumping out his hits like ‘Now You’re Gone” & ‘All I Ever Wanted’!\n\nThe party of the summer will be hosted by Mark McCabe who will be performing his iconic ‘Maniac 2000’ and playing some of the largest floor fillers of the 90s and 00s! It was the best of times, it was the best of times as Charles Dickens would have written if he’d been on the dancefloor in the 90s and 00s…\n\nMark McCabe is an Irish Dance Music Icon. His single “Maniac 2000” marks a moment in time and has long achieved cult status, he put the “Oggy” into Irish Dance music.\n\nReleased over 20 years ago, the single reached Number One in the Irish Charts and stayed there for ten weeks, in fact it’s still the second biggest selling record in Ireland ever. This was only the start for Mark though, he has since had a thriving musical career both as an artist and on radio. He was signed with New York tribal house legends Twisted Records and remixed songs for some of the world’s biggest artists, most recently remixing Gavin James’ “Nervous”, along with releasing music under other aliases. He established himself as a DJ on pirate radio early in his career and he since blossomed in this side of his career too, highlights include editing RTE’S alternative station 2XM and becoming Director of Music and Sound at RTE 2FM. Highly sought after as a live performer Mark has travelled the world playing to fervent crowds including a jam packed set at Electric Picnic, that was the highlight of the weekend for many. It is not just in Ireland he is revered, he’s in demand all over the globe from Abu Dhabi to Sydney and regularly packs out venues.\n\nThis to all intents and purposes is Mark’s prime time, but we’re sure the best is yet to come!"
