She made a comment about how \" 'Miracle' is their new hit song.\"\n\nWe're just waiting for confirmation.\n\n\"Neverending Dream\" is being pushed as a single overseas and in Canada.\n\nPost by Krypton46 on\n\nThis is a good choice for a single. It's in my top 5 favorites on the album. I'd love to see them separate themselves from the DHT's and DJ Sammys of the world and continue their success with another single. \"A Neverending Dream\" is another favorite of mine so I'm happy to see that being released everywhere else.\n\nPost by COW COW COW COW COW COW COW on\n\nIt is their best song...only 'Bad Boy' 'Can't Stop the Rain' and 'Ready For Love' rival it...They will get another hit with this...granted it is the next single...(And if it isn't and Z100 just plays it, it'll be all the same)...If 'EWT' can make #10, 'Miracle' can make #5. :) It will probably chart higher because the stations will add it more or so around the same tme, as opposed to stations taking their time adding 'Touch' accross the country.\n\nDid Natalie say it was their new hit song...or did the DJ?\n\nPost by COW COW COW COW COW COW COW on\n\n714 673 CASCADA Miracle 1 1 0 0.159\n\nWhat's this from - the spin Z100 Gave it? Doesn't look so GREAT to me...but technically there is no NEW single.\n\nPost by derek on\n\nLMAO!\n\nYeah, I don't think this song will do very well in the US. The should have released Bad Boy. Maybe the stations will take the liberty in playing BB as they are taking the liberty of playing the Candelight Mix of ETWT.\n\nPost by COW COW COW COW COW COW COW on\n\nZ100 will play this song...If they play it - so will everyone else. Why wouldn't it do well in the U.S. Its so much better than 'Touch.' Z100 loves Cascada, and they said 'Miracle' is their next hit...if they put it in power rotation, which I'm sure they will, all other stations will follow...\n\n'Miracle' is their best song...but 'Bad Boy' has always been my favorite and I would like to see that released as the third single, or a fourth, it seems 'Ready For Love' might also be a single.\n\nPost by COW COW COW COW COW COW COW on\n\nThe followup hasn't been released yet! We don't even know if it is Miracle! The fact that they played it once is pretty impressive. If Z100 doesn't continue to kiss Cascada's a** and play their songs then I will kick Z100's ass!\n\nPost by ðŸ…³ðŸ…¸ðŸ†‚ðŸ…²ðŸ…¾ on\n\nthepulse said:\n\nI don't know about that. Would Z100 play only dance music if you took over?\n\nZ100 should! WKTU is pure garbage now. And they call themselves a dance station!\n\nPost by pubescentmonster on\n\ngui393 said:\n\nThe DJ said that and she was like \"YEAH!\".\n\nlol I like her \"YEAH\". She said that too when Vanessa said great spring break song and shes like YEAH! I luv it.\n\nPost by pubescentmonster on\n\nRobbins should release and send for adds \"Miracle\" no later than 5 weeks from now. I know they send there songs for adds on Rhythmics radio but did they ever send \"EWT\" to adds on pop or it just became big on there and they didnt bother sending it for adds on pop? They should send Miracle for adds both POP/Rhy and if they are smart also try HOT AC.\n\nLets hope Z100 keeps their promise and plays the song when its officially released as all other stations will have to follow. If Robbins change their mines the last minute then release BAD BOY as the second single as it is the only other CASCADA song getting some airplay but I think after that interview MIRACLE is the way to go\n\nPost by ðŸ…³ðŸ…¸ðŸ†‚ðŸ…²ðŸ…¾ on\n\npubescentmonster said:\n\nRobbins should release and send for adds \"Miracle\" no later than 5 weeks from now.

They sometimes send the songs to the stations and then they decide to play them, and also they put many of their songs on those Promo Only compilations that the stations get.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, there was an actual adds date for CHR/Pop for EWT.\n\nPost by ðŸ…³ðŸ…¸ðŸ†‚ðŸ…²ðŸ…¾ on\n\nCONFIRMED! It's the second U.S. single!\n\nJohn Parker:\n\nThe new Cascada single will be... \"Miracle\". We will be putting it out with a new mix. Keep checking for the actual street date.\n\nPost by derek on\n\nSo fire reakin glad. I hope this makes at least top 20 on Pop!\n\nWonder what the new mix will sound like. I like the original as it is. GASP! I hope the mix they are talking about isn't a CANDELIGHT MIX! :o"
