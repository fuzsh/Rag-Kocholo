I've played rap, techno... pretty much the songs here and nope.. there is still this one song that beats the hell out of any song. It's reggaeton... Don Omar - Conteo. If anyone can play it, see for yourself, and I'm looking for a song that can beat this one [rock preferably]. It's a constant bass shaking experience, the frequency change makes the harmonics go back and forth, giving you this feeling that it's all moving, not just the boom boom boom of a techno song or a rap song... no no, this is different. Subsonic range, dunno the freq but it's got a nice range.\n\n}\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Kyl\n\nPost Number: 3\n\nRegistered: Sep-06\n\nPosted on\n\nPaper - Gorilla Zoe\n\nYoung Buck - Bang Bang\n\nGucci Mane - Swing my Door\n\nDJ Unk - Slow it up\n\nRick Ross - Push it\n\nGrits - Open Bar\n\nHurricane - Hey Baby Baby ft.

I tried most of them, I actually made a list of these songs and played them in my cousin's car, and in mine. My cousin's subwoofer is bigger than mine, yet they display different frequencies. Anyhow, the hardest bass goes to Bass Mekanik [by far], KoRn, DJ Tiesto, Headhunterz, Snoop Dogg, djredd [even matching Bass Mekanik], SPM, Linkin Park, System of a Down, Fiona Apple. That's tested in 2 VERY different amps/woofers.\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Carlson625\n\nPost Number: 1\n\nRegistered: Feb-09\n\nPosted on\n\nPrelude 12/21 by AFI.....the opening note is insane on a good system....\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: The_don_rolo\n\nPost Number: 2\n\nRegistered: Feb-09\n\nPosted on\n\nI posted this list in the other thread for top songs to play on subs, this list goes hard, its just a few, ive got alot more but this is just off the top of my head:\n\nThree 6- late night tip (obv)\n\nJeezy- Hypnotize\n\nBoo- Baby Powder\n\nYukmouth- Shine Like Me\n\nYung Goldmouf- in da club\n\nBun B- Swang On Em\n\nLupe Fiasco- Hip Hop Saved My Life\n\nYung Boss- Mobbin\n\nSean P- Yean beat'n\n\nC-Murder- be Fresh\n\nYung Berg- Do That There\n\nLil Jon- Da Blow\n\nJeezy- White Girl\n\nJacky Chain- Rollin Rollin\n\nYoung L- All On My Dick (<-- fire)Clyde Carson- Hood Stomped Out\n\nJadakiss- Shoot Outs\n\nJadakiss- Feel Me\n\nJadakiss- Air It Out\n\nJadakiss- By Your Side\n\nJadakiss- By My Side (Wit Ne-Yo)\n\nTraxamillion- From The Hood\n\nWes Fif- Haterz Everywhere\n\nJeezy- Put On\n\nWiz Khalifa- Say Yeah (dont care what u say, **** bumps hard)\n\nMobb Deep- Bullworth\n\nMobb Deep- Hell On Earth\n\nMethod Man- Release Yo Delf\n\nRed Cafe- Hottest In The Hood\n\nRed Cafe- There He Go\n\nsmitty- Talk Rap\n\nNelly- Spaz Out (<--- Fast Punch..)\n\ngame- Dope Boys\n\nObie Trice- you Burn\n\nChamillionaire- Industry groupie\n\njust a few.. some have already been said, but there are some new ones in there, and they all hit hard\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: The_don_rolo\n\nPost Number: 3\n\nRegistered: Feb-09\n\nPosted on\n\nforgot to say, Hood Stomped Out by Clyde Carson is def a track to get, beat is dirty..\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Embargo\n\nPahoa , HI Usa\n\nPost Number: 5\n\nRegistered: Aug-07\n\nPosted on\n\nArtist: Tech N9ne\n\nCd: Killer\n\nDisc #: 1, 2\n\nlike yeah, wheaties, get the f*ck out of here, i love you but f*ck you, i am everything, psycho b*tch 2, poisonous, too much, can't shake it, paint a dark picture hit nicely at 30-40hertz\n\nalso from tech n9ne would be testin, earthquake, freaky, demons!\n\nNew member\n\nUsername: Deezy_f\n\nPost Number: 2\n\nRegistered: Jan-09\n\nPosted on\n\nI'll add some more bay slap\n\nTraxamillion - 808\n\nThe Team - It's Gettin Hot\n\nClyde Carson - 24's\n\nToo Short - Slideshow\n\nYoung Droop Ft.
