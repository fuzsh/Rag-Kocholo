        "text": "Act 1\n\nThe Parisian embassy of the tiny Balkan state of Pontevedro is hosting a party in honor of the king’s birthday led by the ambassador, Baron Zeta. Zeta is worried because Hanna Glawari, widow of the wealthiest man in Pontevedro, has come to Paris and might marry a Parisian, taking her fortune with her and spelling financial ruin for Pontevedro. Meanwhile, Camille de Rosillon is carrying on a love affair with Valencienne, Zeta’s wife. She keeps insisting that she is a respectable wife—all the while flirting with Camille, nonetheless. At last, Hanna arrives surrounded by adoring admirers. All the men have fallen under her spell. Baron Zeta, realizing that he must do something to prevent any foreign love affairs, sends his secretary, Njegus, to find Count Danilo Danilovich, the embassy attaché. His plan is to get Danilo to distract Hanna from marrying a Frenchman. Danilo arrives from Maxim’s, where he has been busy carrying on a party of his own with the local grisettes. As he attempts to take a brief nap, Hanna walks in. As it turns out, she and Danilo were once in love, but his uncle, the king, forbade the marriage. Danilo now swears that she is too rich for him to ever say “I love you” to her again. Zeta tells Danilo it is his patriotic duty to marry Hanna. Danilo refuses but undertakes preventing anyone else from marrying her. A ladies’ choice dance is announced, and both Cascada and St. Brioche, two of the Frenchmen who want to marry Hanna, compete to get her to dance with them. When Hanna attempts to ask Danilo instead, he offers to sell his turn for 10,000 francs. The mention of so much money scares the other men away. Alone with Hanna, Danilo dances with her after all as the act ends.\n\nAct 2\n\nIt is the next day. Hanna has invited everyone from the party to a Pontevedrin festival at her home. She begins the festivities by telling the story of Vilja, a nymph who fell in love with a mortal. When Danilo finally arrives, the sparring with Hanna immediately begins again. Zeta re-enters and assigns Danilo the task of finding the owner of the fan he has discovered and which would seem to belong to Camille de Rosillon’s lover. After not much success, Danilo is joined by some of the other men from the party, who all agree on how difficult it is to figure out women. Zeta then asks Njegus and Danilo to meet him in the summerhouse for a conference. Hanna comes back to find Danilo alone, and she blames him for driving her guests away, demanding that he help her understand how to have fun in Paris. When the moment becomes too intense, they part. Valencienne enters with Camille and tells him this must be their last evening together. They go into the summerhouse to share it privately. At the same time, Zeta arrives for the conference. Njegus—having seen the lovers enter the pavilion—rescues Valencienne by getting Hanna to take her place. Zeta thinks he has discovered his wife and demands that she come out to face his wrath, but when Hanna appears instead, Danilo assumes that she is Camille’s lover. To annoy Danilo, Hanna announces that she has decided to marry Camille. At first, Danilo pretends to be indifferent, but as he gets increasingly angry, he gives into jealousy and finally leaves, heading for Maxim’s to drown his troubles in champagne. The act ends with Hanna realizing that Danilo is still in love with her.\n\nAct 3\n\nIt is later that same night, and another party is going on. This time, Njegus is playing master of ceremonies at the cabaret, which has been set up at Hanna’s mansion. As he points out to Zeta, Hanna has even imported real grisettes from Maxim’s to make Danilo feel at home. With the help of the embassy staff, Danilo is brought to the party, where he is greeted by Njegus, who explains, to Danilo’s amazement, that he too has been taken by life in Paris. When a telegram arrives wanting a report on the imminent ruin of the Pontevedrin treasury, Danilo agrees to make a last attempt to prevent Hanna’s marriage. At this moment, Hanna herself appears. Finally, Danilo and Hanna are left alone. He admits that he loves her but cannot bring himself to say the words. Instead, he waltzes with her, and Hanna admits that her engagement to Camille was a fake. Finally, Zeta figures out that it really was his wife in the summerhouse. He takes matters into his own hands by announcing he will divorce her and immediately proposes to Hanna. Hanna points out that, under the terms of her late husband’s will, she will lose her fortune if she remarries. Danilo, thinking that Hanna will once again be the poor girl he once loved, finally says, “I love you” and proposes to her. Only then does Hanna finish the explanation, by adding that she will lose her fortune because it goes to her new husband. As everyone agrees that, no matter how hard you may try, you will never understand women, the curtain falls.\n\n©2012 Vincent Liotta\n\nby Kitt Westerduin\n\nPh.D. Musicology Student\n\nIn Franz Lehár’s turn-of-the-century operetta, The Merry Widow, Parisian indulgence meets global politics. Lehár’s 1905 work follows Hannah Glawari, the titular widow, and Count Danilo as they rekindle their love within the diplomatic social world of France. The history of the operetta dates back to 1861—the premiere of French dramatist Henri Meilhac’s comic play L’attaché d’ambassade. In the play, an ambassador of a poor German grand duchy schemes to arrange a high-profile marriage to keep a wealthy widow’s money in the country, thus preventing its bankruptcy. Nearly 40 years later, librettists Viktor Léon and Leo Stein would discover Meilhac’s comedy and, alongside composer Lehár, reposition it in the modern age. Indeed, The Merry Widow is firmly rooted in the cultural ethos of fin-de-siècle Vienna and its musical and political touchstones. To capture this milieu, Lehár drew upon his own experiences traversing Austro-Hungary as a military band leader to create a myriad of musical worlds in The Merry Widow. From Balkan folk tunes to military marches to popular dances enjoyed throughout Vienna’s famous ballrooms, the music situates the operetta within the Viennese zeitgeist. To satisfy the Viennese audience demands, The Merry Widow brims with festive dances, jubilant choruses, effervescent dialogue, lyrical arias, and a rousing finale number at the end of each of its three acts. By design, The Merry Widow is a feast of amusements in both music and plot.\n\nOperetta is known for its combination of serious and popular art forms. Dance had been characteristic of operetta since Jacques Offenbach’s nineteenth-century French works. But Viennese operettas in particular were synonymous with the waltz, that whirling couples dance so beloved by Austrians, and the glittering ballrooms in which it took place. Johann Strauss II was largely responsible for uniting the triple-meter dance and operetta, epitomized by his 1874 work Die Fledermaus. Lehár draws on the lavish associations of the waltz to symbolize social status in The Merry Widow. The opening ballroom waltzes complement the decadent evening spent at the Pontevedrin embassy in Paris. Moreover, the waltz signifies Hannah’s new position in society. Formerly a peasant, Hannah is now bolstered by her newfound wealth and independence. Appropriately, her entrance is marked by a flamboyant waltz as suitors flock around her. The three-beat waltzing rhythm is emphasized to the point of burlesque by the exaggerated “oom-pah-pahs” and rushing strings. Thus the dance simultaneously reflects high society and pokes fun at the absurdity of such diplomatic events.\n\nBy the time Lehár composed The Merry Widow, the Golden Age of operetta had passed, and Lehár was faced with the dilemma of having to choose between his Viennese predecessors’ increasingly sentimental style and Offenbach’s earlier, but time-tested, satirical model. He ultimately decided to combine these two styles, resulting in a blend of humor and tenderness that would come to define Viennese operetta’s Silver Age.\n\nOffenbach’s influence on Lehár’s humor is clear. In addition to the exaggerated dances and tongue-in-cheek songs, such as Valencienne’s “Ich bin eine anständige Frau,” Offenbach’s compositional style is explicitly referenced in Danilo’s Act I aria “Da geh’ ich zu Maxim.” The farcical roll call of amusing pet names mimics Offenbach’s famous use of nonsense syllables to satirize stuffier genres. Comedic numbers, however, are punctuated with moments of sincerity. At the end of Act III, when Hannah and Danilo admit their feelings for one another, the ensuing waltz is stripped of its earlier pomp and instead transitions into unabashed Viennese sentimentality. The orchestra delicately accompanies the two singers, who begin with two complementary yet separate musical themes before concluding in unison.\n\nIn updating Meilhac’s play, Léon and Stein replaced the German duchy with the imaginary Balkan state of Pontevedro: an idealized folk society and foil to cosmopolitan Paris. The Merry Widow can be interpreted as a synthesis of old and new worlds that takes place over the course of three acts. The work is, however, colored by a distinct reverence for folk culture that reflected the increasing nationalism across Europe at the time. As such, the events in the Pontevedrin Embassy in Paris become the vehicle through which the librettists play off the tension between old world innocence and its modern, cosmopolitan perversion. In response to the gaudiness of Act I, the second act highlights the traditional values of far-off Pontevedro, incorporating folk-inspired numbers that contrast the other acts in mode and meter, including real Balkan folk dances like the kolo. As such, the Pontevedrin space invites introspection and nostalgia. Hannah, who had up to this point been teasing Danilo and flaunting her riches in front of her many money-hungry suitors (for example in the song “Damenwahl”), waxes sentimental and drifts into a dreamy, folk-inspired aria recounting the mythical nymph Vilja and the hunter who loved her. Danilo will sing a complementary folk song in Act III when, after finally losing his patience with Hannah, he erupts into “Es Waren Zwei Königskinder,” a song about a princess’s betrayal of her prince. Both ballads invoke a nostalgia for the folk stories of home, allowing the protagonists to express their true feelings without disrupting the comedic plot. The protagonists’ journeys synthesize old and new worlds, a comforting conclusion for the early twentieth-century audiences who were grappling with a yearning for the past in their increasingly modern lives.\n\nAt its core, The Merry Widow is a love story. Former lovers Hannah and Danilo reunite and ultimately reconcile over the course of the work’s three acts. Their journey is complicated by politics and social scandals, and the lovers are set apart from the rest of their Parisian world by their strong ties to Pontevedro. In this way, the folk sentimentality that casts Hannah and Danilo as outliers in the world of this comedy is the very thing that makes them sympathetic protagonists to the original Viennese audience, thus contributing to the work’s initial success. However, by engaging with broader political themes, such as global marketplace expansion and burgeoning nationalism, The Merry Widow holds a mirror to the world in which it was created: that of early twentieth-century Europe. In the following years, the work would be performed thousands of times across German-speaking countries and eventually be translated into three other languages to be performed on four continents, cementing its legacy as one of the most popular theatrical works of all time.\n\nArthur Fagen has been professor of orchestral conducting at the Jacobs School of Music since 2008.
