        "text": "Perfect Day is the second studio album released by German Eurodance group Cascada. The entire album was produced by the group's two DJs, Yanou and DJ Manian. Like its predecessor, the album is comprised heavily of uptempo Eurodance tracks, many of which are cover songs. This album, however, features covers of songs from the early 2000s of the rock and country genres, with the exception of Because the Night (originally released by Patti Smith) which was released in 1978. Two edited tracks, \"Endless Summer\" and \"I Will Believe It\" that were previously recorded under the Siria name are also featured. Musically, the album is composed of Eurodance tracks with euphoric trance-style synths, drum programmings with a tempo over 140 beats per minute, and Europop lyrics. Lyrically, the albums is composed of love, partying and romance.\n\nCritical reception of the album was negative, with many critics disliking the repetitive nature, that all the songs on the album sounded similar, and the lack of character and originality. The album has sold about 3 million copies worldwide. There was a total of five singles released from the album. Unlike their previous album, Perfect Day only had one major hit single worldwide. \"What Hurts the Most\" peaked in the top ten in six countries, including Austria and France and was certified gold in the United States for sales exceeding over 500,000 downloads. \"What Do You Want from Me?\" and \"Because The Night\" peaked in the top sixty in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. The last two singles, \"Faded\" and \"Perfect Day\", were released in the United States and Canada and failed to garner any chart success.\n\nCascada, Perfect Day Full Album Zip\n\nDownload Zip ðŸ”¥ https://tiurll.com/2ycn0d ðŸ”¥\n\nIn the first week of UK sales, Perfect Day sold 50,000 copies,[4] debuting at number 12 on the UK album chart. However, in the second week it sold 100,000 copies, but fell to number 16. It then climbed back up, and peaked at a comfortable #8, before being knocked out of a weeks spot in the top ten. By the end of the year, the album had sold around 239,000 copies, making it the 64th highest selling album in the UK in 2007.[4] The album has currently sold over 3,000,000 copies worldwide.[citation needed] The album was released on March 4, 2008 in the U.S. with a new cover and track listing peaked at a #70 in the U.S Billboard 200.[5]\n\nThe album was released in Australia on 15 March 2008.[6] The album has been added to iTunes Italy in January 2008 being the first Cascada album released in Italy, but it was later removed; then on 2 January 2009 it was re-added. On 20 October, the album was due for a UK Platinum Edition re-release but was cancelled. The album was not released in the Netherlands until 7 November 2008. The Dutch version contains the American bonus tracks and the original track listing.\n\nThe album received negative reviews from most critics, with Sharon Mawer from Allmusic criticizing its repetitive nature by saying \"How could anyone keep up the pace of these songs for a whole track, let alone a complete album, when the pumping beat is relentless and Horler, together with the production, contrives to make every song sound identical?\"\n\nSince the release of their first album 15 years ago, CASCADA look back on world-wide successes like Everytime We Touch, Miracle, Evacuate The Dancefloor, San Francisco, Summer Of Love or The Rhythm Of The Night. Front-singer Natalie Horler and her team of producers and writers Yann Peifer (Yanou) and Manuel Reuter (Manian) have topped the charts in more than 20 countries with their irresistible dance-pop songs. Collecting numerous awards (e.g. the World Music Award in 2007) throughout their career, they have established themselves as one of the top European dance acts of today.\n\nThey started writing songs for the album in late 2003, like, the title track (Everytime We Touch), Miracle and Bad Boy, they recorded a slow version of Everytime We Touch around the same time. Then, in 2004, the studio released Miracle and Bad Boy as singles and released the album in early 2005, the title track for the album released in 2005 (both original and slow versions), then they had a tour for the album from summer of 2005 to fall of 2006, They ended the tour in favor for their second album in 2007.\n\nTheir second album, Perfect Day started to get worked on, right after the Everytime We Touch tour concluded in fall 2006. They released the album in 2007. They had a tour for the album in 2007-2008. Then in fall 2008, they started to work on their third album, Evacuate the Dancefloor. They released this album in 2009, had a tour in 2009-2010 and like every album, stops in favor for a new album.\n\nIn fall 2010, they started to work on their fourth and final studio album, Original Me. Then, they released it in 2011, had a tour in 2011-2012, but this time, it didn't stop because they're was gonna be a new album in 2013 (which there isn't), The reason is unknown. In 2012, they released two other albums (which are NOT studio albums). In 2013, they released an acoustic album. After that, they released other singles, which she was in from other people.\n\nThis huge success starts in 2005 when their debut album \"Everytime we touch\" and their debut single with the same title takes the world by storm and reaches top 5 chart entries in countries like America, Great Britain, France, Canada, South Africa, Japan, Scandinavia and The Netherlands.\n\nBarely noticed at first, the released singles and the album reach sales of over 3 million. \"Everytime we touch\" has been downloaded several million times in America only and thus belongs to the top 10 most downloaded tracks of all time.\n\nWith the new single \"What hurts the most\" , which will be released worldwide in December, Cascada is taking the next step. Cascada will once again present her unusually talented voice; she has already finished the production of her new video in Hollywood. All her fans cant await the release of her second album titled \"Perfect Day\", but will have to be patient until the end of this year. 3df8ca78c1"
