The internationally successful dance act, who represented Germany in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest, will release “I’m Feeling It (In The Air) on October 2nd… so just four weeks to go!\n\nAre you ready to feel it?\n\n“I’m Feeling It (In The Air)” will be released by Zooland Music, the act’s long-term music label, and will be Cascada’s first single release since “Like The Way I Do” hit digital and streaming music services in August 2019. It is the latest in a series of non-album singles including tracks such as “Blink” abnd “Reason” that have followed the release of “The Best of Cascada” in 2013.\n\nCascada, consisting of vocalist Natalie Horler and producers DJ Manian and DJ Yanou, joined the Eurovision family after representing Germany in Malmö at the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest. Despite placing 21st, “Glorious” saw commercial success, particularly in homeland Germany with a peak position of #6. As a result, Cascada earned their first top 10 hit in Germany since 2009’s “Evacuate the Dancefloor” and remains their most recent single to achieve such a feat.\n\nMillion-selling singles\n\nThe band rose to fame in the mid-2000s with the smash-hit singles “Miracle” and “Everytime We Touch”. The latter was certified platinum in multiple nations including sales of over one million copies in the United States and more than 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The aforementioned 2009 single “Evacuate the Dancefloor” saw similarly high levels of success and earned the band a #1 position in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\nAre you looking forward to Cascada’s brand new single?
