        "text": "High Profilers\n\nStratford, Ontario’s Mr. Entertainment Justin Bieber launches new album Purpose filled with R&B inflected electronic beat music. It debuts at #1 on iTunes and contains two double-platinum singles “What Do You Mean” and “Where Are U Now”. Brampton, Ontario red hot teen sensation and R&B specialist Alessia Cara releases her debut LP, Know It All. Also from Brampton, soul singer Johnny Reid tells us What Love Is All About. Urban artist Kardinal Offishall guests on one of the tracks. Blending soul with pop and adult contemporary, this year’s winner of The Voice Kevin Bazinet contributes Talk To Me. YTV Next Star winner Alicia Moffet is featured on one of the songs. A slew of A-list singers cover hits from 70s superstar Diane Dufresne on tribute album Intemporelle including Roch Voisine, Ariane Moffat, Pierre Lapointe, and Marie-Pierre Arthur!\n\nChoice Alternatives\n\nFive albums that could be considered as falling into the alternative genre are the following. Toronto duo Beliefs cooks up some delicious dreampop/ shoegaze works on Leaper. Also from the city that rhymes with piranha is The Most Serene Republic. Album Mediac is a nice eclectic mix of funky grooves and orchestration. Those into more experimental vibes can check out We Are the City by Vancouver’s Above Club. More raw and reflective is Nous sommes le feu from Montreal’s Maude Audet. Very well written tunes abound on Like a Whisper by Equse.\n\nCushioned Seat\n\nThose looking for music easier on the ears can enjoy some vocal a cappella thanks to Musique à bouches and album Jusqu’aux oreilles. The group is from Sherbrooke. Trois Rivières’ Guy Brière has recorded fine singer-songwriter album Heille mais là with some blues rock on some of the tracks. You will find beautiful singer-songwriter landscapes on Mille Îles‘ Le Bouquet and pleasant vocal folk on The Wainwright Sisters‘ Songs in the Dark, both artists being from Montreal.\n\nStool of Rock\n\nFor more standard rock, Quebec City’s Les Respectables present a self-titled album. For headbangers, Toronto’s Black Lungs celebrate a Pagan Holiday. For those who prefer the other R, Montreal’s Cobna gets the rap going on album Realise.\n\nFestive Mood Generators\n\nThree holiday albums appear this week: classical flavoured Secrets of Christmas by the award winning Gino Quilico, nuage seasonings on Claire Pelletier‘s Noël Nau, and Noël by Nanette Workman and Yvon Bellemare.\n\nAnd with that, we now have over 600 Canadian albums released so far in 2015! What’s the best one? Well, it depends whom you ask, but we will countdown our faves at the end of the year. Next week a new album is out from comedic rock group Les Trois Accords and November 27 will see new works from singer/pianist Ingrid St-Pierre and pop superstar Alyssa Reid!\n\nAccording to the Billboard Canadian Hot 100, the biggest song of 2009 in Canada was “I Gotta Feeling” by The Black-Eyed Peas. To date, it is the only digital-era single to be certified diamond (10x platinum). Twenty-one songs from the year-end top 100 chart below involve Canadian artists which have been bolded in red. The top song by a Canadian was “Africa” by Karl Wolf at #9. The Canadian charts are an accurate reflection of Canadian tastes in music, and the Top 100 songs were determined both from radio airplay and nationwide sales data. The drawback with year-end charts is that songs charting from the end of one year through beginning of the next will have their chart performance split between the two years. More year-end and other Canadian charts can be found here.\n\nRANK TITLE ARTIST 1 I Gotta Feeling The Black Eyed Peas 2 Poker Face Lady Gaga 3 Right Round Flo Rida 4 Boom Boom Pow The Black Eyed Peas 5 I’m Yours Jason Mraz 6 Fire Burning Sean Kingston 7 I Know You Want Me Pitbull 8 Love Story Taylor Swift 9 Africa Karl Wolf Ft.

The group’s last two albums have been certified platinum, and two of the band’s singles double platinum, “All to Myself” and “Cross My Heart”. Starting out in 2006, The Trench scored a couple of hits prior to the launch of the Billboard Canadian Hot 100, and since the establishment of the chart has decked it with a total of 15 songs, the latest of which is “One Love” from the new album. The band must have had fun shooting the music video which has them wallowing around in a flooded room. Trying to avert the rising waters on the chesterfield doesn’t prove too helpful, as the sofa itself is drenched. It’s half a metre high and rising, and the boys are soaked to the gilder sleeves. iTunes\n\nNikki Yanofsky in Poland\n\nNikki Yanofsky recently paid a trip to Poland to guest on that nation’s installment of The Voice. She was interviewed and performed on the televised affair.\n\nNikki reassured fans on Twitter that her new album is close to completion. Her last one, Little Secret, went gold and attracted a JUNO nomination. She has also announced that Haitian music professional Wyclef Jean is producing the new record in Montreal.\n\nKevin Bazinet Wants Us to Talk to Him\n\nWinner of this year’s season of The Voice in Canada, Kevin Bazinet, will be releasing his new album, Talk To Me, on Friday. Kevin is the little brother of platinum recording artist Bobby Bazini. Album track “Surrendered” will feature his co-finalist in The Voice and winner of YTV’s The Next Star, Alicia Moffet. The hot, young pair recently rocked the red carpet together at the ADISQ gala in Montreal.\n\nShawn Mendes Gets Cabellofied\n\nTeen superstar Shawn Mendes will be releasing a collaborative track with his dear friend from Fifth Harmony, Camila Cabello. Apparently, “I Know What You Did Last Summer” was written backstage during one of Taylor Swift’s concerts. The new song will be out November 18 and included on a reissue of Mendes’ Handwritten album.\n\nMarie-Mai Makes the Cover of Elle Magazine\n\nPlatinum superstar Marie-Mai who delighted us with a display of girl power, performing with Ariane Moffatt and Fanny Bloom during last Sunday’s ADISQ gala, is featured on the latest issue of Elle Magazine!\n\nMichael Bublé Receives Accolades\n\nMichael Bublé officially received his star on the Walk of Fame in Toronto and during the event was also finally presented with his diamond plaque by Music Canada. The latter was given to mark the milestone of album Christmas reaching 10x platinum (diamond) certification for sales of 800,000 copies.\n\nLindi Ortega Performs at Grand Ole Opry\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, USA, which was founded in 1925. It is considered a huge honour for any country star to be invited to perform. Canada’s Lindi Ortega recently received such an honour. It can be seen as a major milestone in one’s career and a sign of significant recognition by the country music establishment. Lindi has just kicked off a 40-plus date tour across both North America and Europe. She has also launched an MV for “Ashes”.\n\nBriia’s Got It\n\nBriia is a new recording artist from Montreal. She dropped her first singles this year, one of which has entered the official Top 40 CHR chart. “Fake It ‘Til You Make It” gave the hot 19-year-old whiz a feature in this week’s Nielsen Canadian Update newsletter. An EP is in the works. iTunes\n\nTrevor Guthrie’S STRONG HANDS\n\nThis being Remembrance Day, we leave you with the fresh MV for Trevor Guthrie’s dedication song, “Strong Hands”.\n\nThe Biebs will be back at it in 2016, selling out an arena near you all around the world. He officially announced the 2016 PURPOSE WORLD TOUR this morning. The Anglo American leg kicks off in the city of the Space Needle (Seattle) March 9, 2016, and finishes off in New York City’s iconic Madison Square Garden July 16. The tour will absolutely include dates in Canada, as follows:\n\nVancouver (Rogers Arena) March 11\n\nOttawa (Canadian Tire Centre) May 13\n\nQuebec City (Videotron Centre) May 14\n\nMontreal (Bell Centre) May 16\n\nToronto (Air Canada Centre) 2 nights! May 18 and 19\n\nWinnipeg (MTS Centre) June 11\n\nCalgary (Saddledome) June 13\n\nEdmonton (Rexall Place) June 14\n\nSaskatoon (Credit Union Centre) June 16.\n\nTickets for most shows go on sale November 20 at 10 a.m. local time. You can find all dates at his website.\n\nAlbum Purpose will be out this Friday November 13. A new tasty stat is that the beachwear themed MV for “Sorry” has jiggied itself up to Vevo certification at 100 million views.\n\nJustin will hold an album release party at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles November 13. He is also spending a week on the chat show of his number one fan, Ellen DeGeneres. Highlights include his patching things up with his fellow Canadian, actor Seth Rogen; if fact, Seth profusely apologized on the show for tweeting and saying mean things about the Biebs and took full responsibility. He also joked, “In light of recent photos, I want him on my side”. We have embedded below a video of a hilarious prank Justin and Ellen pulled. Bieber disguised himself as a security guard scanning attendees for potential threats. Ellen coached him through an ear piece on what to say.\n\nWhat would be the musical equivalent of Belgian waffles drenched in pure Canadian maple syrup? Well, one of the most beautiful voices of our time belongs to Lara Fabian. International slaughterdom, Canadian multiplatinum status, a household name since 1994, recordings in nine languages, global sales of 20 million, the Belgian born Canadian is back with her 12th studio album, Ma Vie Dans La Tienne. It’s worth checking out for the beautiful title-track alone; see the MV below. Making the music with her on this one are David Gattegno and Élodie Hesme who smartly arrange piano, guitar, and violin so as to buoy not drown the centerpiece of her vocals. The instrumentation echoes the relative intensity and type of emotion. For example, more rock guitar accompanies angry lyrics while the accordion is used for nostalgia. Lyrically, the album explores male-female relations in the form of a diary. Lara will be following this with an English album which we are sure will be just as delightful! iTunes\n\nFormer lead singer of Glass Tiger, Alan Frew, who has been working on various projects since the band’s heyday in the mid-80s, including writing songs with and for other artists, releases solo album 80290 Rewind this week. As the title suggests, it presents covers of 80s songs. Alan recently suffered a stroke which he was happy to overcome and get his album launched. He is originally from Scotland, eventually relocating to Newmarket, Ontario. Glass Tiger achieved big success not only in Canada but in the United Kingdom and United States in the mid-1980s. On the new album, Alan and a team of musicians in Nashville, U.S. recorded his interpretation of a dozen classic songs, most of them from 1984-1986 and one from 1990. He reinterprets one of his hits with Glass Tiger, “Someday”.\n\nCovers can come in handy especially for those who liked the musical composition of the original but maybe not the vocals or the arrangement/ production. Also, those who have grown tired of the original recording might like to hear the song in a different light. We can celebrate some of the big hits from the 80s with Alan Frew’s beautiful vocals. Below is a table of the track list from 80290 Rewind with the 80s artist, peak Canadian chart position (RPM), and date the song reached the peak. We have added notes on a few of the songs. Below that, check out the promo video for the album. iTunes\n\nNotes:\n\nDon’t You (Forget About Me): Alan Frew’s fellow Scots in band Simple Minds were an underground group for many years and finally saw a big breakthrough with this song due to its being featured in the popular Hollywood motion picture The Breakfast Club.\n\nHuman: Lacking inspiration for new music, Britain’s The Human League turned to 80s hitmakers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis who wrote and produced this track.\n\nEvery Time You Go Away: This was originally done by Hall & Oates in 1980 (not released as a single). The original had more of a gospel feel to it. Paul Young reinterpreted it with Gary Numan fretless bass collaborator Pino Palladino and an electric sitar and took it to the top of the Canadian charts in 1985.\n\nLive To Tell: Madonna co-wrote this ballad, which appeared on her album True Blue, with Patrick Leonard who is of French Canadian descent.\n\nNothing Compares 2 U: This is the song that made Ireland’s Sinead O’Connor famous. It was written by Prince.\n\nIn Your Eyes: Written by Peter Gabriel and produced by Canada’s Daniel Lanois, the song featured Senegalese singer Youssou N’Dour with some verses in the Wolof language.\n\nNo new Canadian albums have debuted in the Top 10 this week; however, two improve their chart performance. Paul Daraiche’s Laisse-moi te dire which landed on the charts at #9 is #5 this week. Bryan Adams’ Get Up improves its previous chart position of #10 to #8 this week. The Weeknd’s Beauty Behind the Madness rebounds back to #1 on the albums chart which now incorporates streaming and track equivalent data. In terms of pure album sales, the various artists compilation album Forever Gentlemen is #1. On the Hot 100, Justin Bieber’s “I’ll Show You” is the lone new Canadian entry this week, debuting at #28. It is his 35th Top 40 hit! Two entries have bettered their chart peaks. Coleman Hell’s “2 Heads” is now #15 and Hedley’s “Hello” #35. Glenn Morrison’s “Goodbye” having recently been certified double platinum has just been declared BDS certified at 100,000 spins at radio. Speaking of radio, Jess Moskaluke officially scores her first Top 10 hit (#9) on Country Airplay for “Kiss Me Quiet”!\n\nThe current Billboard Canadian Hot 100 is HERE\n\nHOT 100 KEY\n\nRK – CanCon rank\n\nTW – This week’s chart position\n\nLW – Last week’s chart position\n\nRE – Re-entry\n\nWC – Weeks on the chart\n\nPP – Peak chart position\n\nOR – Provincial origin of the artist\n\nCE – Gold/platinum certification by Music Canada\n\nG – Gold certification (40,000 units sold)\n\nP – Platinum certification (80,000 units sold)\n\nxP – Multiplatinum certification\n\nRed maple leaf – Canadian artist\n\nMagenta maple leaf – Partly Canadian artist\n\nBlue maple leaf – Featured Canadian artist\n\nThe 2015 ADISQ main gala took place in Montreal tonight November 8 and saw a lineup of superstars perform: Ariane Moffatt, Bobby Bazini, Fanny Bloom, Fred Pellerin, Galaxie, Jean Leloup, Louis-Jean Cormier, Marie-Mai, Marie-Pierre Arthur, Patrick Norman, and Philippe Brach. The event was hosted by funny man Louis Jose Houde. The ADISQ gala awards the best in Canadian music coming out of the province of Quebec, the bulk of which honour music performed in the French language. A list of nominees with winners bolded in red is below. Most of the Félix awards were handed out at the first gala. See the nominees and winners of that here.\n\nHighlights from the gala which took place at la Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier de la Place des Arts in Montreal are as follows. Host Louis-José Houde participated as one of three drummers to open the show. Unfortunately, Jean Leloup in accepting one of his awards mentioned a certain Louis but stumbled in trying to remember the surname; it left the host speechless. On a more serious note, Houde mentioned that francophone music currently accounted for 65% of songs aired on Québec radio stations who want to drag it down to 35%. Many artists during the evening wore a lapel pin to denounce the scheme. Houde also took some delicious swipes at streaming services.\n\nDominique Michel, a legendary music and TV personality since the 60s, received a lifetime achievement award. A highlight of the performances was a showing of girl power. Marie-Mai in red, Fanny Bloom in green, and Ariane Moffatt in blue performed on stage together in an electropop medley of three of their songs. Moffatt returned to the stage at precisely 10:22 p.m. to accept her award for Female Artist of the Year. Her album is titled 22h22. Jean Leloup took home 3 awards for the night. With the 2 he won at the first gala, his total of 5 makes him this year’s big winner.\n\nSONG OF THE YEAR\n\nRIEN À FAIRE BY MARIE-PIERRE ARTHUR\n\nAVANT DE DISPARAÎTRE BY CLAUDE BÉGIN\n\nOUBLIE-MOI (CARRY ON) BY COEUR DE PIRATE\n\nSI TU REVIENS BY LOUIS-JEAN CORMIER\n\nESPIONNE RUSSE BY JOSEPH EDGAR\n\nLE MONDE EST VIRTUEL BY SERGE FIORI\n\nPARADIS CITY BY JEAN LELOUP – WINNER\n\nMÉCANIQUES GÉNÉRALES BY PATRICE MICHAUD\n\nDEBOUT BY ARIANE MOFFATT\n\nLES COLORIÉS BY ALEX NEVSKY\n\nADULT CONTEMPORARY\n\nSI L’AURORE BY MARIE-PIERRE ARTHUR – WINNER\n\nSUR LA TERRE BY PIERRE FLYNN\n\nHERVIEUX BY MARC HERVIEUX\n\nAPRÈS LA TOMBÉE DU RIDEAU BY PATRICK NORMAN\n\nUN HOMME QUI VOUS RESSEMBLE BY MARIO PELCHAT\n\nFOLK\n\nLA FOIRE ET L’ORDRE BY PHILIPPE BRACH\n\nLES GRANDES ARTÈRES BY LOUIS-JEAN CORMIER\n\nFACE À L’OUEST BY KEVIN PARENT\n\nPLUS TARD QU’ON PENSE BY FRED PELLERIN – WINNER\n\nPANORAMA BY TIRE LE COYOTE\n\nPOP\n\nJÉRÔME COUTURE BY JÉRÔME COUTURE\n\nLÀ DANS MA TÊTE BY MARC DUPRÉ\n\nDEUXIÈME ACTE BY SALLY FOLK\n\nM BY MARIE-MAI\n\n22H22 BY ARIANE MOFFATT – WINNER\n\nSONGWRITER/COMPOSER\n\nGUILLAUME BEAUREGARD\n\nFANNY BLOOM\n\nLOUIS-JEAN CORMIER\n\nPIERRE FLYNN\n\nJEAN LELOUP – WINNER\n\nGROUP OR DUO\n\nALFA ROCOCO\n\nGALAXIE – WINNER\n\nKAÏN\n\nMARIE-EVE JANVIER / JEAN-FRANÇOIS BREAU\n\nRADIO RADIO\n\nFEMALE\n\nMARIE-PIERRE ARTHUR\n\nBRIGITTE BOISJOLI\n\nISABELLE BOULAY\n\nMARIE-MAI\n\nARIANE MOFFATT – WINNER\n\nMALE\n\nLOUIS-JEAN CORMIER\n\nJEAN LELOUP – WINNER\n\nALEX NEVSKY\n\nVINCENT VALLIÈRES\n\nMARC DUPRÉ\n\nNEWCOMER\n\nBERNHARI\n\nPHILIPPE BRACH – WINNER\n\nJÉRÔME COUTURE\n\nVALÉRIE LAHAIE\n\nDAVID PORTELANCE\n\nCéleste (Lévis) is a fluently bilingual charmer from Timmins, Ontario and a die-hard fan of The Backstreet Boys. But don’t mess with her; she has a black belt in karate! With greatly trained hands thanks to her martial arts pursuits, her parents bought her a piano which she took to immediately. She picked up the guitar as well and began writing songs, eventually winning a couple of contests. Taking great pleasure in using her fingers as well to scribe numbers, Céleste relocated to Ottawa to become a student of mathematics and pursue a bachelor’s degree. A couple years ago, she released an English-language dance-pop song, “The Ghost of You and I” which attracted some buzz. While the thump-loud genre normally deemphasizes the high quality vocals of a singer, you can hear her hearty pipes on top of the music.\n\nHitherto, Céleste’s fingers having done most of the talking, it was her thick syrupy vocals that landed her a spot in The Voice this year. Her participation must have impressed the folks at Tandem Records, as she was invited to record an album. That album, simply titled Céleste, is out now! She switches from Anglo to Franco and from dance-pop to folk-pop. In her case it seems to be the right move, as her vocals are buttressed perfectly by the style of music, an astonishingly good match as a matter of fact. The album itself is selling very well, currently sitting at #6 on the iTunes Franco charts, and even outselling Lara Fabian’s new album! iTunes\n\nOne of the most popular bands in the country, British Columbia’s Hedley, has just released its sixth studio album, Hello. Since its debut in 2005, Hedley has scored 16 Top 40 hits, received triple platinum certification for single “Kiss You Inside Out”, double platinum certification for two of its albums, and won a pair of JUNO awards. The band was one of the Canadian artists invited to perform at the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver. Last year, frontman Jacob Hoggard, a finalist from Canadian Idol, hosted the JUNO gala.\n\nHello sees involvement from the captain of Canadian dance pop, Ryan Stewart, as well as production wizard Brian Howes. Style-wise, the album continues Hedley’s tactful, on-track, branching from its roots in the pop punk era to the funky dance pop grooves of the 2010s. Title-track “Hello” is up to #38 on the Billboard Hot 100. In a recent interview with CBC professional journalist Ian Hanomansing, the band says the best way to experience and enjoy its music is to attend its shows. In the spring of 2016, to promote the new album, Hedley will be on tour with Carly Rae Jepsen and new sensation Francesco Yates. The group presents a not uncommon anomaly of enjoying massive superstardom within Canadian borders but not internationally. However, the band is content with such status and says it will continue chipping away at the global scene. Guitarist Dave Rosin puts it creatively, “We are perpetually the rock and slingshot being fired at a bowling ball, and I think we’re cool with that .” iTunes\n\nThere is perhaps no musical instrument more beautiful than the human voice. And when many voices are brought together in choir, it is music’s finest hour. Montreal’s Karen Young has just dropped a remarkable album of classical music entitled Missa Campanula. It was just last month that she gave us You Make Me Feel So Young, a jazz album, a genre for which she previously attracted a JUNO nomination. Karen has released 10 albums under her own record label, Ursh.\n\nYoung considers Missa Campanula her most important work. It is an album of original compositions, sung in sacred style, a cappella, in Latin, by a choir, and is dedicated to her mother who died of Alzheimer disease. The vocal latticework was accomplished by a tiered foundation choir of sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses interplaying with a solo quintet while Karen joins two others in the treble choir. The overall performance was conducted by François Ouimet.\n\nKaren composed the songs over a five-year period as both a thank you to her mother and helping her cope with the tragic deterioration in health due to Alzheimer’s. The full-blown mass was recorded in Old Montreal at the Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel. Karen says they could discern her mother’s “approval in the imperceptible tinkling of the glass chandeliers in the silence after each song.” iTunes"
