Rob Swire - Ghost 'n' Stuff\n\nPost by Verisimilitude on\n\nDon't forget Benny Benassi's own \"Cinema\" which sold over a million, but I believe never charted.\n\nPost by Rocky on\n\nBenny Benassi's \"Cinema\" is certified Platinum and peaked at #2 on the Bubbling under chart.\n\nPost by ♛ The Manticore ☯ on\n\nCascada - Miracle (Certified Gold & Bubbled under #2 and never crossed over to the Top 40)\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nEdward sharpe and the magnetic zeros -home\n\ni think its platinum\n\nPost by Luckie Starchild on\n\nLindsay Lohan's gold-certified \"Rumors\" peaked at #6 on the Bubbling Under chart.\n\nPost by Verisimilitude on\n\nOzzy Osbourne's \"Crazy Train\" has sold 2 (!) million but never charted on the Hot 100.\n\nPost by Caviar on\n\nChristina Aguilera - \"Just A Fool\". Peaked at #71 and sold over 515k. Depending on your definition of \"crossed over\" it never went Top 40 on Pop. Unsure of its peak tho.\n\nPost by ♛ The Manticore ☯ on\n\nMadonna - Into The Groove (Certified Gold but something about the song being a B-side to the Maxi-single \"Angel\" so it was ineligible to chart.)\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI don't even know there is a song called ANGEL by Madonna\n\n:/\n\nPost by ♛ The Manticore ☯ on\n\nQueen - The Show Must Go On (Certified Gold by the RIAA and charted on the U.S Mainstream Rock charts)\n\nPost by Au$tin on\n\nChristina Aguilera - \"Just A Fool\". Peaked at #71 and sold over 515k. Depending on your definition of \"crossed over\" it never went Top 40 on Pop. Unsure of its peak tho.\n\n\"Just a Fool\" peaked at #39 on pop.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nMadonna - Into The Groove (Certified Gold but something about the song being a B-side to the Maxi-single \"Angel\" so it was ineligible to chart.)\n\n\"Into The Groove\" was the b-side to \"Angel\". \"Angel\" is certified Gold.\n\nPost by HolidayGuy on\n\nActually, the \"Angel\"/\"Into the Groove\" 12-inch single is certified gold, not the 7-inch \"Angel\" (in which ITG did not appear). Variety charted ITG separately from \"Angel\" in its Singles Sales chart (where it spent six weeks at No. 1). Also, as we know, Billboard charted ITG on the R&B chart, where it was one of her four top 20 hits there.\n\nBB apparently had some odd rule about 12-inc singles at the time; however, there had been 12-inch-only singles that had charted on the Hot 100 prior to 1985 (and then again in 1990, with \"u Can't Touch This\").\n\nPost by WotUNeed on\n\nThe Postal Service's \"Such Great Heights\" is another example.\n\nPost by .indulgecountry on\n\nTurning tables by Adele\n\nThat peaked at #63 on the Hot 100 though.\n\nPost by Verisimilitude on\n\nTurning tables by Adele\n\nThat peaked at #63 on the Hot 100 though.\n\n\"Make You Feel My Love\" then?\n\nPost by ♛ The Manticore ☯ on\n\n\"Danza Kuduro\" is 5x Platinum. It reached #82 on the U.S. Hot 100 chart but never went Top 40 on the CHR/POP chart.\n\nPost by HolidayGuy on\n\nIsrael Kamakawiwoʻole's \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" which, incidentally, has sold more than 4 million and only certified platinum.\n\nPost by YourFaveIsAFlop on\n\nIt made the Hot 100 (peaking at 58) but does anybody know how the hell Empire by Shakira is certified platinum? It peaked at #39 on streaming songs and #33 on sales (with total sales estimated at around 400k) There is no way that she got 60 million streams of the song in the US to make up the difference considering it only has 70 million views worldwide on YouTube and it never charted on On-Demand songs.\n\nPost by peacebone on\n\nM83's Midnight City only peaked at #72 on the Hot 100 and never crossed over to CHR but was certified Platinum.\n\nPost by G-Reg on\n\nThe OP says that this thread is for any song that didn't hit the Hot 100 so that eliminates like half of y'all."
