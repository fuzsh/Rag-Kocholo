        "text": "BODYCOMBAT 42 Sizzler\n\nThe Muay Thai inspired BODYCOMBAT® 42 transports the class to Bangkok! This release will take you on a Martial Arts journey, from Karate and Tae kwon do to the boxing ring. Fight your way through and hope you’ve got enough left in the tank for the epic Muay Thai onslaught that is Track 7! Sing along to Kelly Clarkson’s I Do Not Hook Up while warming up with Side, Front and Roundhouse Kicks.\n\nThen get ready for Karate and Tae kwon do in a battle of Martial Arts in Track 2! Find out how fit you really are in Track 3. Boxing is the name of the game in six rounds of interval training. You are in the ring and you don’t stop!\n\nWatch out for the new move in Track 4 – the Sweep will knock your opponent out of the way and work your inner thighs at the same time. The class splits into two groups for some social interaction, fighting style, before you’re whisked away to Brazil. You will be practicing the art of defense and attack in authentic Capoeira to The Prodigy’s Warrior’s Dance. Now, what we’ve all been waiting for – eight minutes of Muay Thai! This track will transport you to a dark fight club in Thailand and push your heart rate to unknown heights. It would be a Miracle if you could do the last Power Training Track with the same energy you started with. Your speed and endurance are certainly tested in this track.\n\nBODYPUMP 72 Sizzler\n\nBODYPUMP® 72 is all about making your class stronger,faster. How? By focusing on Bottom Halves and Partial Range movements, the rest phase is eliminated and the muscles are kept under tension for longer. Look forward to a challenging workout and an overall strength blast where active recovery is your only break! Brace your abs and prepare for more Bottom Halves than you bargained for in the Squats Track. Kelly Clarkson will motivate you to keep going with her huge hit I Do Not Hook Up. New Zealand’s own Dane Rumble sings Track 3 – Always Be There. Bottom Halves and Slow Bottom Halves will put your chest muscles under tension for a little bit longer than usual. Ouch! The good news is this will give you results faster. The Triceps Track is sweet like Sugar! Again, Bottom Halves are the name of the game.\n\nChallenge yourself and go a bit heavier than normal in the rocky and upbeat Biceps Track. The Bicep Row returns, attacking your guns from a different direction. It’s back to the legs in the intense Track 7. The Lunges stick with the theme of the release – you guessed it – lots of Bottom Halves that will push up your heart and burn calories. The\n\nShoulders Track is a tribute to the legend that is Michael Jackson – make sure you watch the DVD for this one! The range of motion in the Singles has been shortened to ¾ Range. Grit your teeth and hang on! Ciara and Justin Timberlake will take you through the Abdominals Track with Love Sex Magic. The mix of deep, lower abdominals work and the Walking Hover will chisel your six-pack and at the same time strengthen your core.\n\nBODYSTEP 78 Sizzler\n\nGet ready to lift the energy to new heights with the athletic BODYSTEP® 78! You will also get the chance to strike some fabulous poses, get funky with the dance flava and, of course, work on your endurance. Stay low and check your posture to Sneaky Sound System’s Pictures in Track 2. You’ll stick with the photo-shoot theme in Track 3, striking poses to Girls On Film while starting to build up the intensity with strong Over The Tops. Turn it up in Track 4! Your heart rate will climb high with the Power Knee Lifts. Look out for new move the Quarter-Turn Curl Combo.\n\nAdd some attitude to the lower-body workout in Track 5. MadLab sums it up well with Wiggle It. Let it rip Across The Top in Track 6! You’ll reach your second cardio peak in this athletic track while singing along to She Is Beautiful.\n\nUse Track 7 as a cardio recovery while sculpting your lower body. You’ll feel like you are walking a tightrope with the Lunges and Knee Lifts to Britney Spears’ Circus. Bring on the Party Step Track! It’s your turn to shine and ‘dance with the stars’. Feel the rhythm and get into it with Mambo Cha-Chas and powerful Propulsive Hamstring Curls.\n\nEvery little thing about Track 9 is magic! This is the Speed Step Track so lift your knees up and run like an athlete on the sprint track. If it’s possible, reach even higher in Track 10! Rock out with Knee Repeaters and new move the 3 Knee Rocker before working on your leg strength in Track 11 with 1-Legged Squats and the Tree Pose.\n\nBODYATTACK 67 Sizzler\n\nBODYATTACK® 67 is about having fun and finishing the class together as a team! Chart-topper Closer by Chris Crew will get the show on the road leading into the huge hit for track number 2, Release Me . Amp it up in Track 3! Turn up the energy and make the moves bigger in four blocks of work. There is a new combo consisting of three Knee Crossovers and two Single Knees. When you’re ready, add a turn! You’ll finish off this track with 30 seconds of Jumping Jacks to Gimme More. Surrender to the music and Rock It to your peak in the insanely intense Track 4.\n\nSingle Lunges, High Knees and Jumping Jacks will push your heart rate through the roof! Come down to the floor to get some Boom Boom Pow in your shoulders, chest and triceps with Pushups, before getting ready for the second cardio block. First, be Number 1 on the studio floor and then it’s off to soccer practice. The class splits into two squads for some agility training and football-inspired moves. Get ready – you are now entering the high-energy phase of BODYATTACK®! Take Me To The Clouds Above will inspire you to reach the clouds and take the intensity higher than you have ever been before! Stay in the zone to push your body through Tuck Jumps, High Knees and Jumping Jacks, while singing along to the cover of The Cranberries’ monster hit Zombie.\n\nBODYBALANCE 47 / BODYFLOW 47 Sizzler\n\nDon’t let the soft and flowing nature of BODYBALANCE® 47 fool you – this is one of the most challenging releases ever created.\n\nWarm up with a series of simple, traditional Tai Chi exercises. The exercises are laid out in an evolving progression, making it easy for your class participants to master the moves. You will be challenged in the Sun Salutations Track.\n\nThe new innovation is the 3-Legged Dog, shifting to Plank Pose and then sinking into Crocodile Pose. Find grace and make the movements feel beautiful in Track 4. There’s a gorgeous strength and balance sequence in this track, set to one of the most unusual pieces of music ever used in BODYBALANCE® – Soul Saviour’s For The Windows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti. The Core – Abdominals Track features very slow, controlled Pilates moves which will put your endurance and abdominal strength to the test. The uplifting song Show Me What I’m Looking For brings back the Bow Pose and Pilates Swimmer Kicks, building back strength in Track 7. There’s also a new pose called the Scorpion, evolving from the 3-Legged Dog. Increase your mobility with the beautiful twisting poses to Beyoncé’s Halo, before coming into the Hamstring work to Annie Lennox’s stunning rendition of Whiter Shade Of Pale. You’ll love the Forward Folds and the Standing Split. Then relax into your own Quiet Place.\n\nBODYJAM 51 Sizzler\n\nBODYJAM® 51 is here to drop a funk bomb on the floor in your club! We’ve got hits from T-Pain and The Ting Tings, the best Gloria Estefan track ever and the hottest House anthems of the year! Track 1, Scared Of Me from Fedde le Grand, is so funky it should be illegal. The first combo comes back strong in the second half of the class, so feel the correct flava from beat one. T-Pain’s track, Freeze, will take you through the Isolation block. This is about feeling your hips from the beginning. Sing along while you get your class to “dance like me”. Get your Swag Swag on to The Ting Tings’ Shut Up And Let Me Go – one of the hottest tracks from 2008. So what is Swag? Swag is your flava.\n\nThe style is purely you, and you know you are all over it! Make it oversized and Swagalicious, baby! The new Tribal Salsa routine is a cosmic concoction of Latin styles.\n\nIt’s going to fire up your floor and push your heart rate through the roof. Are you ready for the hottest, nastiest Recovery Track ever? Missy Elliott’s anthem One Minute Man is Hip Hop 101. Get yo’ Bounce Bounce on with the Kick Back Step. Surrender yourself to the rhythm and Leave The World Behind! This standout anthem of 2009 is so phenomenal that we’ve included two versions for a full 11½ minutes! Want more jammers on the floor? Use the two complexity levels to grow your BODYJAM® class.\n\nTeach the low-complexity version for at least three weeks before adding in the advanced options. Get your class comfortable with the release as a whole, then start throwing in the advanced options over the next couple of weeks. Save some of the trickier options for later to keep your advanced class participants on their toes.\n\nRPM 45 Sizzler\n\nRPM™ 45 is all about creating awareness of how to use resistance. Show your class how much resistance to use, how to find it, what it feels like and what the benefits are. Also coach your class to ride fast – find the working load and ride the beat! Set off on the open road to the uplifting classic Life Is A Highway. Your heart rate will pick up in Track 2 with three fast sprints and one small climb.\n\nUse this track to find the right working load. Listen to the lyrics in Track 4! Take a leap of faith and close your eyes when you hit the fast sprints to All On Our Own by New Zealand band Midnight Youth. Power equals force times speed. The more resistance you use, the further distance you are going to travel and the more calories you’re going to burn. So switch on to power up! Track 5 is all about razor-sharp attacks. Don’t be fooled by the fun nature of The Prodigy’s Piranha – this is intense and you will be challenged! Quadruple resistance turns and Standing Attacks will push your heart rate through the roof. Speed is the focus for Track 6. Gradually increase your leg speed to this iconic RPM™ track – Bruised Water by Chicane featuring Natasha Bedingfield. Switch from speed to strength in Track 7. Look out for the heavy Power Climbs!\n\nRecover to The Man Who Can’t Be Moved from Irish band The Script. Let the heartbeat drop before stretching and lengthening your muscles to Adele’s beautiful Chasing Pavements.\n\nBODYVIVE 13 Sizzler\n\nBODYVIVE™ 13 has a sporty feel with simple choreography that will make your class get the most out of their workout. Have fun with the new Boxing moves in Track 5 and look out for the new back exercise for GREAT POSTURE in Track 8. Play That Funky Music and build strong legs with the Squat & Hamstring Curl Combo in Track 2. Track 3 is a real classic – Earth, Wind & Fire’s September. Have fun with the Disco moves that will lift the intensity to new heights.\n\nGet ready to stride across the room in the empowering Track 4! The anthem No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) will push you through the Squat with VIVE™ ball throw. Extend and lengthen your body and enjoy the poses, before getting down with the Balance & Leg Strength exercises to Five’s If Ya Gettin’ Down in Track 7.\n\nThe combination of one-legged balance work and upper body resistance will really challenge your class to push their limits. Track 9 is all about getting sexy hips! Push through the resistance of the VIVE™ tube to Justin Timberlake’s SexyBack. Lisa Stansfield’s classic This Is The Right Time will take you through the Ab Strength Track. Single and Double Leg Extensions are in the house! The options are there if you need them. Track 11 features Pushups – for the first time ever in a BODYVIVE™ release! Using the VIVE™ ball, you’ll work at your own intensity level. The Bow & Arrow using the VIVE™ tube will work your upper back and build a strong posture. Then Release & Restore to the beautiful words of Because You Loved Me."
