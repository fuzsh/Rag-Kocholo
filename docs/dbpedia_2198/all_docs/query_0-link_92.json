        "text": "Second only to that damn Mariah song (you know the one) “Last Christmas” is one of the most mashed-up holiday songs ever. Originally released in 1984 by the U.K. pop duo Wham!, it has since become such a nearly-unavoidable seasonal standard that there’s even a challenge called “Whamaggedon” where one attempts to make it through the month of December without hearing the song once.\n\nFortunately, mashups, remixes, and covers are disqualified from the rules of Whamaggedon, so this album is safe for listening – IF YOU DARE! Not sure who would want to listen to 42 different mashups of the SAME DAMN SONG, but if you’re looking to troll a holiday party with a playlist of a (mostly) beloved Christmas classic, this is for you!\n\nHit the Mashup Player in the lower left to stream the entire playlist (or download the zip file of all the MP3s). Or just pick and choose your favorites. Merry Christmash!\n\nThe post Mashed Christmas I Gave You My Bootie (2023) appeared first on Bootie Mashup.\n\nThis year’s Best of Bootie Mashup mixtape is a little different than previous years, in that it’s almost a three-part suite. The first section jumps right in with dance-pop disco vibes, kicking things off with a mashup of Dua Lipa’s “Dance The Night,” the showcase single from the year’s biggest movie, “Barbie.” (Not so coincidentally, “Barbie” also was the theme of our biggest party in 2023.)\n\nWe always have an EDM mashup section on the album, but this year we get to the bangers sooner, and stay there longer, to keep you pumped on the dancefloor. Then it’s time for the third and final stretch, with a long tail of inventive, mostly genre-clashed mashups, including a block of Taylor Swift tracks (after all, this was certainly her year) and the requisite chill-out (and WTF) mashups to take us to the end.\n\nWe always try to include as many “big hits” of the year as we can, as well as showcasing throwback tracks that got a makeover by being mashed up in creative ways. Special shout-out to DJ Firth for mixing this year’s edition, and Adriana A for curating the Bootie Mashup team’s favorites.\n\nAnd for the first time since 2005, there are NO Bonus Tracks! All killer, no filler!\n\nSTREAMING – CLICK THE MASHUP PLAYER IN LOWER LEFT TO STREAM ALL 21 TRACKS\n\nDOWNLOAD – Click the red box below for a ZIP file of the fully-mixed 21-track album + artwork\n\nUNMIXED VERSION: Click here for a ZIP FILE of all 21 tracks, UNMIXED.\n\nIf you want a single 69-minute MP3 file, then click here for the Full Mix in one MP3.\n\n———————————————————————————–\n\nBEST OF BOOTIE MASHUP 2023 MIXTAPE\n\n1.

All six of our resident Twitch DJs are doing extended marathon sets, continuously streaming for over 60 hours from Friday through Sunday, March 8-10 (and maybe into Monday morning) with plenty of surprises along the way. We’ve even dropped a slew of new animated emotes, just in time for the occasion!\n\nCheck out the full schedule below, and we hope to see you in the ChatPod this weekend! Click on over to: twitch.tv/bootiemashup\n\nAll times are Pacific Time. Adjust accordingly and don’t forget about Daylight Savings Time on Saturday night!\n\n——————————-\n\nFRIDAY MARCH 8\n\n2-7 PM: Cat Cam Happy Hour w/ Lobsterdust & Muffin\n\n7 PM – 11 AM (overnight): Adriana’s Apartment: Album All-Nighter Listening Party while unpacking and setting up her new place! 16 hours!\n\n——————————-\n\nSATURDAY MARCH 9\n\n11 AM – 4 PM: Saturday Night Mashups w/ DJ Firth\n\n4-6 PM: DJ EN8 (making his triumphant return to Twitch!)\n\n6-9 PM: DJ Tyme & guest performers\n\n8 PM: Dance Commander Disco Zoom party opens!\n\n9-10 PM: Jack Roger (Twitch debut!)\n\n10 PM-11 AM (overnight): DJ Tyme & guest performers\n\n12-1 AM: DJs From Mars (2020 Rooftop Stream Rerun)\n\n——————————-\n\nSUNDAY MARCH 10\n\n11 AM-4 PM: Airsun: Sunday Funday\n\n4 PM-???: Jupiter Gatling: Unhinged Marathon Closing Set\n\ntwitch.tv/bootiemashup\n\nThe post 4-Year Twitchiversary this weekend – March 8-10 appeared first on Bootie Mashup.\n\nFor this second Cyberpunk: Bootie Mashup album, cover girl Adriana A invited Ohio-based producer (and fellow darksynth mashup producer) AGGRO1 to join her on this compilation, crafted specifically for Neotropolis 2024.\n\nEight brand-new mashups were created for this mixtape, including two collabs between Adriana A & AGGRO1, along with a dozen other tracks from these two producers that didn’t fit on last year’s edition. We tried to do a lot more ’80s & ’90s vocals this time!\n\nThis will be Bootie Mashup’s second year at Neotropolis, and Adriana A, along with Jupiter Gatling, will be closing out the 5-day cyberpunk festival on Saturday April 27 with a special DJ set at The Core.\n\nGrafting popular vocals from the turn of the millennium with futuristic darksynth and mid-tempo bass, it’s the pop-infused soundtrack for a dystopian cyberpunk world.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2: Bootie Mashup appeared first on Bootie Mashup."
