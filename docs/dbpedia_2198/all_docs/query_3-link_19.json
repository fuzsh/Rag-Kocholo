Ashi wa motto ugoku!; I'm sure you can dance! The legs move faster!)\n\nGeneral Information / Changes\n\nFirst BEMANI game to support PASELI.\n\nFirst non-spinoff DanceDanceRevolution title that NAOKI did not work on as part of the game's staff.\n\nThe interface has been given a complete overhaul. Songs and folders are now on the bottom part of the screen sideways, with album jackets replacing the series' long-time traditional banners. This type of interface design was first seen in DanceDanceRevolution UNIVERSE3.\n\nMost older DanceDanceRevolution songs reuse their background image from the original songs for their jackets, marking the first time these have been seen since EXTREME.\n\nJackets for new songs from SuperNOVA to X are designed from their banners instead.\n\nFirst DanceDanceRevolution arcade game to feature special background dance stages that play special background videos for certain songs. Six stages with this trait are available: BIG SCREEN (used by songs like KIMONO♥PRINCESS); white and black variants of the MOVIE dance stage (used by songs like roppongi EVOLVED ver.D and VANESSA, respectively); and teal, purple, and pink variants of the REPLICANT dance stage (used by the Replicant D-action songs).\n\nMany of the background dance stages returning from DanceDanceRevolution X have been changed:\n\nBOOM BOOM BOOM no longer features equalizer graphics on one of the props in front of but far away from the dancers.\n\nBOOM DARK has lost its rising equalizer bar walls, making it look even darker. This change would stay until DanceDanceRevolution A.\n\nCRYSTALDIUM no longer changes background color, instead always being colored light blue.\n\nThe stars falling from the disco balls in the DANCING RAYS stage are now gone.\n\nLOVE SWEETS no longer features \"10th\" written on the dance floor.\n\nThe CAPTURE ME dance stage from DanceDanceRevolution X is removed.\n\nFirst time since 3rdMIX where no color labeling is used for songs. Instead, all songs have the same black font (with the exception of the current EXTRA STAGE and ENCORE EXTRA STAGE, which are presented in black font with a red shadow).\n\nHAPPY MODE introduced, which features a beginner-friendly interface for new players to the game. Only Single play style is available and a limited number of songs can be selected. Only SPEED modifiers can be changed (during the song). The PRO MODE is the standard, default game mode.\n\nWhile all regions feature Dancemania revivals, select new X2 licenses, and the same KONAMI originals for HAPPY MODE, the other songs differ between regions:\n\nJapan/Asia regions include all available J-Pop licenses from SuperNOVA2, X, and X2.\n\nNorth America/Europe regions include all SUPER EUROBEAT licensed songs, all A Different Drum licensed songs, and new western licenses from X and X2.\n\nThe game will return to the attract mode after countdown timer is up if neither HAPPY nor PRO modes are confirmed for selection.\n\nBATTLE has been removed.\n\nAll X-Special charts were moved to the DanceDanceRevolution X folder, instead of their original game's folder.\n\nDifficulty bar/foot ratings have been removed; plain numbers are used instead.\n\nHAPPY MODE difficulties still retain the classic \"foot rating\" system, except the scale is now simplified to a 6-level scale (1 foot to 5 flashing feet).\n\nALMOST judgement has been removed, and N.G. is now merged with BOO, now renamed to its former name MISS.\n\nCharacter selection screen is now exclusive to eAMUSEMENT.\n\nThe new choreographies introduced in DanceDanceRevolution X from the HOTTEST PARTY series have been slightly modified. One of three parts of the choreography is randomly and continually selected throughout the song.\n\nThe dancing characters' animation speed, alongside the background dance stage animations and camera work, is also no longer affected by the song BPM or stops.\n\nDance Celebration's special choreography has been removed.\n\nCharacters additionally no longer start in a standing idle pose before the song starts; instead, they immediately start dancing as soon as the song has loaded in.\n\nThe system background music was composed by Jamie Thompson and Dave Phaneuf.\n\nLast DanceDanceRevolution arcade release in North America and Europe until DanceDanceRevolution A.\n\nx0.25 and x0.5 SPEED modifiers have been removed. They would later return in DanceDanceRevolution (2014) as Premium Play exclusives.\n\nHighlighted options will now show in green and white text when changing. The rest of the options are in white text.\n\nFirst DanceDanceRevolution game to:\n\nFeature HIDDEN+ and SUDDEN+ options; they can only be selected on the X cabinets.\n\nLet you change SPEED settings after choosing a song, by pressing the left and right select buttons in increments of 0.5. Note that this can only be done several beats before the first note or before SCREEN FILTER takes effect.\n\nBe in a crossover event with another BEMANI series; in this case, jubeat knit APPEND's APPEND FESTIVAL.\n\nTo allow LIFE4 and RISKY modifiers available for regular play. However, it does not appear if play style is SINGLE (with training mode enabled) for the other player on first stage, or VERSUS.\n\nShow FAST (if a note is hit too early) or SLOW (if a note is hit too late) during gameplay when hitting a note on anything but MARVELOUS or MISS.\n\nTo have training mode enabled/disabled before the game begins. This was used until its sequel.\n\nUse EX Score since EXTREME, although it can be enabled by a code, and is only available for X cabinets.\n\nSeveral older songs are given CHALLENGE with new Chinese vocals. The jacket and artist names change on the results screens, but not in song select. For the two songs not from X2, they were kept in their original release folders.\n\nAll these would be replaced by their original Japanese counterparts in A.\n\neAMUSEMENT support for DanceDanceRevolution X2 ended on December 31st, 2011.\n\nTotal songs: 454 (Asia), 452 (North America/Europe)\n\nStaff Information\n\nDanceDanceRevolution X2 credits\n\nDanceDanceRevolution X2 OST Booklet Credits\n\nFull Song List\n\nDanceDanceRevolution X2 Full Song List\n\nDefault Songs\n\nSong Artist BPM SP Difficulty DP Difficulty Beginner Basic Difficult Expert Challenge Basic Difficult Expert Challenge Licensed Songs Be your wings GIRL NEXT DOOR 138 1 4 8 10 - 4 8 10 - Bonafied Lovin'\n\nfrom DanceDanceRevolution HOTTEST PARTY3 Chromeo 125 1 4 6 9 - 5 6 10 - DAFT PUNK IS PLAYING AT MY HOUSE\n\nfrom DanceDanceRevolution HOTTEST PARTY3 / DanceDanceRevolution X2 CS LCD Soundsystem 136 3 5 7 10 7 (SA) 5 7 9 7 (SA) ETERNITY ALEKY 148 1 4 7 10 - 4 7 11 - Everytime We Touch Cascada 142 2 5 7 9 - 4 7 9 - EZ DO DANCE TRF 140 1 4 7 10 - 4 7 10 - Feel Good Inc.\n\nfrom DanceDanceRevolution HOTTEST PARTY3 Gorillaz 139 1 4 6 8 - 4 6 8 - Hide-away AAA 134 1 4 7 9 - 5 7 9 - ICE ICE BABY\n\nfrom DanceDanceRevolution HOTTEST PARTY3 / DanceDanceRevolution X2 CS VANILLA ICE 116 2 4 6 8 4 (SA) 4 6 8 4 (SA) more more more capsule 135 1 3 7 10 - 3 8 11 - only my railgun fripSide 143 1 4 6 9 7 (SA) 5 8 13 8 (SA) resonance\n\nfrom ダンスダンスレボリューション フルフル♪パーティー NAOKI-EX 165 2 4 8 11 - 4 8 11 - Super Driver 平野 綾 200 2 6 9 12 - 6 9 13 - SUPER EUROBEAT <GOLD MIX> DAVE RODGERS feat.

Unlike X, there are no FINAL STAGE-exclusive songs and all four lives are given to the player regardless of the score. For the EXTRA STAGE-exclusive KIMONO♥PRINCESS, an additional level requirement must be satisfied, which can be accessed depending on the number of stages set by the operator and the accumulated total level of difficulty for the songs they played. The minimum levels are:\n\nNumber of stages\n\n(1st STAGE to FINAL STAGE) BEGINNER BASIC DIFFICULT EXPERT 2 1 (2 x 0 + 1) 13 (2 x 6 + 1) 19 (2 x 9 + 1) 27 (2 x 13 + 1) 3 1 (3 x 0 + 1) 19 (3 x 6 + 1) 28 (3 x 9 + 1) 40 (3 x 13 + 1) 4 1 (4 x 0 + 1) 25 (4 x 6 + 1) 37 (4 x 9 + 1) 53 (4 x 13 + 1) 5 1 (5 x 0 + 1) 31 (5 x 6 + 1) 45 (5 x 9 + 1) 66 (5 x 13 + 1)\n\nGetting a AA or higher on KIMONO♥PRINCESS on EXPERT difficulty unlocks roppongi EVOLVED for ENCORE EXTRA STAGE. The song is forced on EXPERT and you may change any options before beginning the stage. roppongi EVOLVED contains four different versions, with one version being selected at random each time you play.\n\nAs of January 26th, 2011, both songs are unlocked by default.\n\nSong Artist BPM SP Difficulty DP Difficulty Beginner Basic Difficult Expert Challenge Basic Difficult Expert Challenge EXTRA STAGE KIMONO♥PRINCESS\n\nfrom DanceDanceRevolution HOTTEST PARTY3 / DanceDanceRevolution X2 CS jun 95-190 5 7 11 15 - 7 11 15 - ENCORE EXTRA STAGE roppongi EVOLVED\n\nfrom DanceDanceRevolution HOTTEST PARTY3 / DanceDanceRevolution X2 CS TAG underground 170 6 8 11 15 - 8 11 15 -\n\nReplicant D-action\n\nReplicant D-action is a new EXTRA STAGE event in DanceDanceRevolution X2. Its design is similar to CARDINAL GATE from beatmania IIDX 13 DistorteD. By fulfilling certain requirements, the player can unlock a special folder, with each song represented by a color. The requirements for each are listed below (Single and Double requirements must be met separately):\n\nSong Conditions Pierce The Sky Clear any 20 charts from the X2 folder.\n\n(Replicant D-action songs count towards the condition, and any charts are cumulative.) Sakura Sunrise Clear two different songs in each game folder (12 folders or 24 songs in total). Shiny World Clear at least five different courses and one drill course.\n\n(any difficulty is allowed; ORDER courses or courses previously cleared does not count.) Anti-Matter Play Trial Mode three times (both players must clear the song), then play Pierce The Sky and Shiny World on the same difficulty (depending on which difficulty you want to play Anti-Matter on).\n\n(This condition will fulfill both play style conditions for Single and Double) New Decade Full combo at least 15 different charts, then play Sakura Sunrise and Shiny World on the same difficulty (depending on which difficulty you want to play New Decade on).\n\n(Players can clear the same song on multiple difficulties.) POSSESSION Clear songs on CHALLENGE difficulty until their total levels add up to least 100, then play Pierce The Sky and Sakura Sunrise on the same difficulty (depending on which difficulty you want to play POSSESSION on).\n\n(playing the same song multiple times are allowed) Valkyrie dimension Obtain all six medals by clearing the six aforementioned songs in no particular order (see conditions below).\n\n(the song is forced on EXPERT difficulty regardless of difficulty played on EXTRA STAGE; option menu cannot be accessed.)\n\nOnce the player has met the requirements for at least one song, a special Replicant D-action folder will appear during EXTRA STAGE, with the available songs based on whichever criteria have been fulfilled. Its folder will appear with one player only. Once the folder is opened, the player is then locked onto the folder until the end of the credit. BPM values are displayed, but song previews are hidden. While playing each song, the player's dancer character battles a RINON clone of the song's color, who appears as a secondary background dancer.\n\nTo obtain a medal for the first six songs, players have to clear them on EXPERT with a AA rank or better. By obtaining all six medals, the player will immediately play Valkyrie dimension's EXPERT chart for the ENCORE EXTRA STAGE, without any opportunity to change any options. It costs all six medals to play the song, and you'll need to re-obtain them all to play it again after.\n\nAs of August 31st, 2010, medals can be obtained BASIC or DIFFICULT, though Valkyrie dimension will still be forced on EXPERT difficulty. ASSIST options are now disabled for Valkyrie dimension.\n\nReplicant D-action ended on February 23rd, 2011, and all its songs were made available by default. The last four songs' CHALLENGE charts were added, though could only be played on Marathon Mode; these charts were eventually unlocked on April 1st, 2011.\n\nIn the Western releases of DanceDanceRevolution X2, to compensate for the lack of e-AMUSEMENT support, the first three songs were added on July 28th, 2011 (the other four songs could only be played on the VS REPLICANT course instead), followed by the other four songs on October 1st, 2011.\n\nSong Artist BPM SP Difficulty DP Difficulty Beginner Basic Difficult Expert Challenge Basic Difficult Expert Challenge Replicant D-action Anti-Matter Orbit1 & Milo 100-400 6 9 14 17 18 10 15 17 18 New Decade Sota F. 100-400 4 11 14 17 18 11 14 17 18 Pierce The Sky JAKAZiD feat.
