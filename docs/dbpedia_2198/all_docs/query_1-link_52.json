The Deschutes River is fed by rain and snow from the rugged mountains of central and eastern Oregon. Dams built 60 years ago wiped out prolific salmon and steelhead runs. Yet, the remaining 100 miles of free-flowing river became one of the region’s beloved whitewater adventure and fishing destinations.\n\n“We love this river,” says local naturalist and fishing guide Amy Hazel, who has lived near the Deschutes for 30 years. “It means everything to us, so we’re going to do everything in our power to save it.” Hazel, alongside a trio of water and fisheries scientists, were puzzled by signs of trouble they observed in the river after Portland General Electric altered operations of the Pelton-Round Butte hydroelectric dam complex in 2010. Those changes have put the last 100 miles of the Deschutes River at risk.\n\nUnlike many modern ecological problems, this one can be fixed.\n\n“The Last 100 Miles” depicts individuals who love the Deschutes River and are raising their voices together.\n\nLive Music at 64oz Taphouse\n\n64oz Taphouse in Hood River presents live music onstage from local and regional musicians.\n\nWednesday, Aug. 21, Hoodoo Johnson (Rock n Roll Dance), 7 p.m.\n\nBon Bon Vivant w/ Jay Si Proof\n\nTuesday, Aug. 13, 6 p.m.\n\nBon Bon Vivant is a genre bending band from New Orleans that pull from singer-songwriter/ pop/ americana/ dark ballads and up-tempo indie dance music…but they would prefer you to just listen to the music.

Austin and Mark met through a mutual friend in their late teens in San Diego, CA. Their friend owned a skate shop where they would skateboard out back during the day and play music and share songs at night. These years were filled with musical exploration for the two. By introducing each other to singer-songwriters such as Townes Van Zandt, Blaze Foley and Tom Waits, among many others, they laid the groundwork for what was to come.\n\nWEEZY FORD\n\nWeezy Ford is a musician and songwriter who lives in the Columbia River Gorge.

The work in question takes a little more juice. Sometimes their music presents as harmonies and melodies placing themselves on ears and hearts like the careful legs of a balletic spider, in awe of its own symmetry and progress. Sometimes their work arrives as an overdue outpouring. Starting somewhere in the body - ecstatic as the seed of a pure and wordless truth - and then erupting as a cathartic yawp. Bonded by blood, forged in psychic battle, sisters Hannah and Mookie channel their lived experiences into music that glides through genres like a canoe on a quiet lake. Stage tested and bad to the bone. LASKA is the sound you hear when you're inside of an indelible memory.\n\nUNSEEN OBJECT\n\nUnseen Object is a rock band from Portland, OR. The project was founded in 2022 and is fronted by human multi-instrumentalists David Alvarado and Kai Nealis. Dylan Bodnarick and Malen Cuturic complete their poignant sound.

They are all music lifers who care more about stretching to make some musical meaning out of the air than about most other things. They are finishing their first album.\n\nPALE VIOLET\n\nPale Violet is led by powerhouse social worker and songwriter Mahalia-Lind Diamond. Drummer Kai Nealis, guitarist/ synthesist Jordan Porto, and bassist Dylan Bodnarick round out the band, which took shape after much time spent discussing vulnerability and art. Pale Violet is rooted in the desire to explore and share in the intimacy that songwriting requires. Their lyrics reflect on love, tenderness, grief, depression and uncertainty. They channel music to process feelings that are complex, and often discomforting. Just like therapy.\n\nBluegrass Pickin' Circle with Jeff Rogell, Make some music or just come and listen to some pickin’!
