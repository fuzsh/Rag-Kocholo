        "text": "It’s New Music Friday and 2013 German Eurovision representatives Cascada have released their brand new single “I’m Feeling It (In The Air)” which had been previously announced last month!\n\nA cover of the 2011 Morgan Page track\n\n“I’m Feeling It (In The Air)” has been released by Zooland Music and will be Cascada’s first single release since “Like The Way I Do” hit digital and streaming music services in August 2019. The track is a cover of the 2011 Morgan Page track “In The Air”. The credits for the Cascada version name the writers as Andry Nalin, Angela McCluskey, Brian Transcaucasia, Harry Cane, Morgan Page, Ossama Al Sarraf, and Sultan + Shepard with production duties undertaken by Cascada members Manuel Reuter and Yann Peifer.\n\nMaking waves on iTunes\n\nCascada’s UK fanbase remains loyal, with the track already hitting the top 100 on UK iTunes upon release today. In addition, the track finds itself hitting the iTunes charts in Germany and Austria. You can listen to the track below via YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify!\n\nCascada’s rise to international fame\n\nCascada, consisting of vocalist Natalie Horler and producers DJ Manian and DJ Yanou, joined the Eurovision family after representing Germany in Malmö at the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest. Despite placing 21st, “Glorious” saw commercial success, particularly in homeland Germany with a peak position of #6. As a result, Cascada earned their first top 10 hit in Germany since 2009’s “Evacuate the Dancefloor” and remains their most recent single to achieve such a feat.\n\nThe band rose to fame in the mid-2000s with the smash-hit singles “Miracle” and “Everytime We Touch”. The latter was certified platinum in multiple nations including sales of over one million copies in the United States and more than 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The aforementioned 2009 single “Evacuate the Dancefloor” saw similarly high levels of success and earned the band a #1 position in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\nWhat do you think of Cascada’s new single?
