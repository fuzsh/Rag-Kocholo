        "text": "Electric Callboy is rewriting the music scene with its unique blend of styles. The band’s innovative sound spans from mixing German Schlager with deathcore (“Hurrikan”) to hardstyle-influenced industrial metalcore (“Parasite”) and a post-hardcore take on Cascada’s “Everytime We Touch.” Their musical prowess has earned them over 4.4 million monthly Spotify listeners and garnered a massive fanbase exceeding 2 million across platforms like YouTube, Instagram, X, Facebook, TikTok, and Discord.\n\nSince their 2010 inception in Castrop-Rauxel, Electric Callboy has been a force in the German music scene. The release of “Hypa Hypa” in June 2020, now gold-certified, marked a new era of greater success. Their loyal fanbase even amassed 100,000 signatures to push for their Eurovision 2022 participation. Despite not competing, 2022 saw their Hypa Hypa European tour sell out, and their album “TEKKNO” reached #1 in the German album charts.\n\nIn 2023, Electric Callboy sold out nearly their entire world tour and their second Escalation Fest. Their single “Everytime We Touch” amassed almost 30 million Spotify streams and over 13 million YouTube views. “We Got The Moves” went viral with 250,000 daily streams, joining “Hypa Hypa” with over 92 million streams.\n\nConsidering those who missed the shows, the band took the TEKKNO Movie to over 100+ theaters in Germany, including a sold-out premiere at the renowned Lichtburg Essen, and to Austria and the UK. The film was a success, selling over 10,000 tickets! The band donated all their proceeds to their EC Music School for socially disadvantaged children.\n\nTheir latest collaboration with BABYMETAL on “RATATATA” garnered over 1 million streams and views within 24 hours of release, hitting #1 on YouTube Trends and making it into the Top 50 Viral Charts in over 42 countries, becoming one of the band’s biggest successes."
