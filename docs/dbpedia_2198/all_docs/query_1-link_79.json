        "text": "When Group member Yannou and writer Allan Eshuijs were in the studio they decided to call the song ‘something-something-dancefloor’ they googled the rest of the title and built the story of song around it. In another interview with Digital Spy she explained the title of the song saying: “It’s got a double meaning, totally. Evacuating something can often be about having an illness, but we’ve taken it in the positive way. As the lyrics say, it’s about being infected by the sound and the beat being so cool that it’s just too intense for people.” When singer Natalie was asked about the song, she said: “We have definitely developed the Cascada sound. With ‘Evacuate The Dancefloor’, we’ve taken all we learnt over the last few years and moved on. It’s refreshing and fun. I love R’n’B and I’ve always had a soulful voice. But I didn’t have much opportunity to show that off. This song is more of a challenge for me to sing. I can’t wait to take it to the clubs. People’s jaws are going to hit the floor when they hear it.”\n\nRelease Date:\n\nJune 29, 2009\n\nSongwriter/s:\n\nManuel Reuter – Yann Peifer – Allan Eshuijs\n\nLabel: All Around the world – Universal TV\n\nChart Rankings:\n\nUS – 25\n\nUK – 1\n\nGermany – 5\n\nIn the UK, ‘Evacuate the dancefloor’ topped the Official Charts Company selling over 400.000 copies.
