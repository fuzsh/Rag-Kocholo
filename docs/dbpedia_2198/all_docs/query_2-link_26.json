DON'T MISS OUT ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST THROWBACK GIGS OF 2023!\n\nSince the release of their first album almost 15 years ago, CASCADA look back on world-wide successes\n\nlike Everytime We Touch, Miracle, Evacuate The Dancefloor, Miracle, Endless Summer, San Francisco,\n\nSummer Of Love or The Rhythm Of The Night. Front-singer Natalie Horler and her team of producers\n\nand writers Yann Peifer (Yanou) and Manuel Reuter (Manian) have topped charts in more than 20\n\ncountries with their irresistible dance-pop songs. Collecting numerous awards (e.g. the World Music\n\nAward in 2007) throughout their career, they have established themselves as one of the tops European\n\ndance floor acts of the present.\n\nBonn-based Natalie grew up in Germany. The daughter of David Horler, an acclaimed jazz musician\n\nand arranger who worked with likes of Quincy Jones, Stan Getz and Tony Bennett, Natalie grew up\n\naround music, though was more influenced by stars like Maria Carey and Whitney Houston.\n\nAt age 18 she started doing studio work and recorded several tracks for different DJs. In 2004, through\n\nher studio work, she met Cologne-based producers Yann Peifer (Yanou) and Manuel Reuter (Manian)\n\nwho invited her to front their new project, CASCADA. Within 18months, together they found\n\ninternational fame with their huge debut hit Everytime We Touch. A smash in the States before the\n\nband even toured there, the song quickly caught on across the globe, followed by a multi-platinum\n\nselling album of the same title. It spawned eight singles, including the massive Miracle and a dance\n\ncover of Savage Garden’s Truly, Madly Deeply. The success of the album gained the World Music\n\nAward in the category World's Best-Selling German Artist.\n\nThe second album Perfect Day (2007), led by hit single What Hurts The Most, continued CASCADA’s\n\nreign as one of the world’s Top 10 selling dance acts. In 2009, the trio began to work on CASCADA’s\n\nthird album Evacuate The Dancefloor. After one efficient year of writing and recording Natalie, Manian\n\nand Yanou succeed in developing their dance-pop - style into something new. “It was lovely to be able\n\nto take our time. I think we really progressed”, Natalie remembers. “It was an amazing success, and it\n\nfelt like a reward for our hard studio work and especially for our courage to change the typical\n\nCASCADA sound, as Evacuate The Dancefloor was our first track heavily influenced by Rap, R&B and\n\nSoul”. The single reached sensational fame across the globe and collected top chart entries in more\n\nthan 20 countries worldwide. Fans even made the single No #1 in England where Natalie overthrew\n\nMichael Jackson, who dominated the top of the charts shortly after his death.\n\nThe success of the single gained among others a nomination for the MTV Video Music Awards, it went\n\nplatinum in the US, gold in Germany and the UK etc. In 2011 CASCADA released their fourth album\n\nOriginal Me that includes in addition to the first single, San Francisco other energetic dance - pop\n\nsongs like Pyromania or Au Revoir. Yanou (responsible for melodies and most of the lyrics) and Manian\n\n(music production & engineering) developed great variety and once again showed their multi-faceted\n\nabilities. Songs on the album were diversified from pure pop, not overly dance to house beats or\n\nguitars. In 2012 their first track Summer Of Love was a euphoric, hands-in-the-air dancefloor anthem,\n\nbuilding on the Eurodance sound CASCADA pioneered. Following the second chart topping single The\n\nRhythm Of The Night and the TV appearance of front singer Natalie in the German “Pop Idol” Jury, the\n\n31-year old pop star and her team of producers spent the last few months focusing on new songs.\n\nThere were a few surprises waiting for Natalie in 2013: She was the contestant for Germany at the\n\nEurovision Song Contest with “Glorious“, which was in the Top 20 in several countries. Moreover,\n\nNatalie’s “Best of”-Album was published internationally.\n\nSince 2004 she ́s touring and still producing new Tracks. The Tours went from the USA to Australia and\n\nfrom the very North of Norway to Africa. CASCADA are now back with their new single One Last Dance\n\n- a collaboration with Trans X with a new take on Living on Video from 1983. It's an ode to years past\n\nwith a feeling of going back to their dance roots, which will be thrilling for every CASCADA fan as well\n\nas lovers of that music era."
