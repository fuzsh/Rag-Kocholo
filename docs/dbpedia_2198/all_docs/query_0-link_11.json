        "text": "It is difficult to imagine the modern world without pop music. Dance hits \"burst\" into the world charts at a staggering speed.\n\nAmong the many performers of this genre, a special place is occupied by the German group Cascada, whose repertoire includes mega-popular compositions.\n\nThe first steps of the group Cascada on the road to fame\n\nThe history of the team began in 2004 in Bonn (Germany). The Cascada group included: 17-year-old singer Natalie Horler, producers Yanou (Jan Peifer) and Dj Manian (Manuel Reiter).\n\nThe trio began to actively create singles in the \"hands up\" style, which was very common in the early 2000s.\n\nThe band's first name was Cascade. But the artist with the same pseudonym threatened the young musicians with a lawsuit, and they changed their name to Cascada.\n\nIn the same year, the band released two singles in Germany: Miracle and Bad Boy. The compositions did not live up to the expectations of the performers and were not a huge success. However, the group Cascada was noticed by the American label Robbins Entertainment.\n\nAs a result, they signed a contract and recorded the hit Everytime We Touch (2005). The single was hugely popular on the UK and US music charts.\n\nHe won first positions in Ireland and Sweden, and in England and France took 2nd place in the main charts. As a result, the track was certified platinum in Sweden and the US. For a long time, newcomers to the music world have not succeeded as well as these talented guys.\n\nIn the winter of 2006, the world saw the band's debut album Everytime We Touch, which was prepared for release in just three weeks. In England, he managed to take 24nd position in the country's top 2 hits for 40 weeks.\n\nIn addition, the disc enjoyed considerable popularity among pop dance fans: more than 600 thousand copies of the album were sold in the UK and more than 5 million worldwide.\n\nThanks to such rapid success, Everytime We Touch achieved platinum status. In total, the album consisted of 8 singles, including the re-released composition Miracle, which was popular in Western Europe.\n\nThanks to such a rapid pace of creative development, the team was recognized as the most successful team of 2007 in terms of album sales.\n\nFinest hour of the Cascada group\n\nAt the end of 2007, the band recorded their second album, Perfect Day, which became a collection of cover versions of various compositions. About 500 copies have been sold in the US. The album was certified gold there.\n\nThe second work of the musicians was no less popular than the first album.\n\nFor example, in England, only in the first week of sales, more than 50 thousand copies were sold, and already in early 2008 the mark reached 400 thousand, for which the album was given the status of \"platinum\". The Perfect Day album sold over 1 million copies.\n\nOn April 10, 2008, Natalie Horler announced the release of her third album, Evacuate the Dancefloor, on her personal blog. The record was recorded in the summer of 2009 and became the first disc (without cover versions). The main hit of this album was the single of the same name.\n\nThe song Evacuate the Dancefloor went gold in New Zealand and Germany; received platinum in Australia and the USA. But the album itself was not as successful as the title track and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nIn support of the record, the artists organized a tour. In addition, the Cascada group acted as an opening act for the famous singer Britney Spears, which increased the group's ratings.\n\nBased on the experience with the recording of the third album, the band members developed a new strategy for releasing, releasing different songs and creating videos for their hits. Later, the Cascada group implemented all these innovations when recording new singles.\n\nThe song Pyromania first appeared in 2010 and became a reflection of the new sound of the electropop style. The band also released the track Night Nurse, the video for which gained more than 5 million views.\n\nOn June 19, 2011, the digital album Original Me was recorded in England. This CD was named the best in 2011 by the UK dance website Total.\n\nBut not only in the music world, the members of the Cascada group are known. So, the soloist of the group in July 2011 participated in a photo shoot for Playboy Deutschland, for which she succumbed to significant criticism from fans.\n\nParticipation in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nAfter winning the German show Unser Songfür Malmö with the single Glorious, the band became the main contender for participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. The song that Cascada was going to win with became a huge hit in the UK.\n\nMany English labels rated the composition Glorious with high scores and gave positive forecasts for the band. The music video for the song was filmed in February 2013.\n\nBut after being widely distributed on social networks and on television, the song Glorious was criticized, and the band itself was accused of plagiarizing the song Euphoria by Eurovision 2012 winner Loreen.\n\nThe Cascada group took 21st place at the main European song contest in 2013.\n\nThe group is currently\n\nToday, the band continues to please the \"fans\" with new works, releases dance hits that are known in many countries of the world, and also actively tours Europe with bright concert programs."
