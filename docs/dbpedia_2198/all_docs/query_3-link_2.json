        "text": "The album spawned seven singles in total. In the UK, four of these were launched: “Everytime We Touch”, “Truly Madly Deeply” (a rendition of Savage Garden’s hit), “Miracle”, and “A Neverending Dream”. All but “A Neverending Dream”, which ranked at #46, achieved top 10 status. In the U.S., following the surge in popularity of “Everytime We Touch”, “Miracle” was reintroduced, garnering extensive radio airplay and achieving a modest chart position. The album “Everytime We Touch” made its mark on the UK Album chart, holding a spot in the top forty for half a year and reaching its peak at No. 2. It also performed well on U.S. charts. This widespread acclaim led to Cascada receiving two World Music Award nominations and clinching the title for the World’s Best-Selling German Artist.\n\nIn late 2007, Cascada unveiled their second album, “Perfect Day”, initially in the UK and parts of Northern Europe, with other regions receiving it in early 2008. For its U.S. release, which came later, the album underwent some alterations. The album’s first single, “What Hurts the Most”, rolled out at the close of 2007 and the onset of 2008, accompanied by its B-side, a rendition of Wham!’s festive hit, “Last Christmas”. This track achieved commendable success, securing spots within the top ten in numerous countries. Subsequently, in the UK and Germany, the tracks “What Do You Want From Me?” and “Because the Night” were released.\n\nIn late June 2009, Cascada released “Evacuate the Dancefloor” in the UK. The song secured the No. 1 spot. The track achieved top five rankings in several countries like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and New Zealand, and was among the top ten in several others. By late September, it made its U.S. debut, peaking at No. 25 and marking the group’s second top-forty hit in the country.\n\n“Evacuate the Dancefloor” became iconic in the club scene, featured in various dance-centric video games, and even secured a nomination for an MTV Video Music Award. The album, sharing the same title, was launched on July 6 in both the UK and Germany. Although the album didn’t achieve the same level of acclaim as its titular single, it still ranked in the top ten in numerous countries. From this album, “Dangerous” and “Fever” were introduced as subsequent singles, with varying regional releases. Both tracks didn’t mirror the success of their predecessor in terms of airplay or sales. Despite this, Cascada continued to actively promote their album, even joining Britney Spears as an opening act during a concert in Germany.\n\nIn 2010, Cascada introduced “Pyromania”, marking a continuation of their electropop style. That summer, parts of a song named “Night Nurse” began to surface online. By November, a music video spotlighting Horler adorned in multi-colored full-body paint was unveiled, building anticipation for their upcoming album.\n\nIn late March 2011, Cascada was busy shooting music videos for their forthcoming singles, “San Francisco” and “Au Revoir”. Both were directed by Lisa Mann with choreography by Luther Brown. These tracks were highlighted in the album “Original Me”, which saw its UK release on 20 June 2011 and a later US release on 29 November.\n\nIn a bold move, Horler graced the pages of Playboy Deutschland in July 2011, evoking varied responses from both fans and critics.\n\nIn January 2012, Horler became a jury member for the German vocal talent show, “Deutschland sucht den Superstar”. By March, the music video for “Summer of Love” debuted in Germany, paving the way for the compilation album “Back on the Dancefloor”.\n\nA few months later, in June, clips of Horler covering Corona’s classic “The Rhythm of the Night” appeared online. The cover was officially released later that month in both Germany and the US.\n\nApproaching the festive season, Cascada unveiled a Christmas album titled “It’s Christmas Time” in November 2012. This album featured their rendition of Wham!’s “Last Christmas” and an original song, “Somewhere At Christmas Time”. Notably, David Horler, Natalie’s uncle, contributed his trombone skills to a couple of tracks.\n\nEarly in 2013, Cascada released the single “Glorious”, which soon earned them the honor of representing Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. They later secured 21st place out of 26 participants in the contest’s final round. Shortly after this, they dropped their second greatest hits compilation, “The Best of Cascada”, which introduced the new song “The World is in My Hands”, succeeding their Eurovision entry. The group then shifted gears, working on an acoustic album titled “Acoustic Sessions”, released in November 2013. This album spotlighted stripped-down versions of their popular hits along with select cover songs.\n\nIn March 2014, Cascada launched their single “Blink” in Germany, with its music video debut on the same day. Interestingly, this track was originally a piece by the pop group U.V.U.K. The following month, countries like Australia and France welcomed the song, and it made its way to UK radio waves.\n\nDespite Cascada not intending to release a fifth studio album, they released new single. The resulting track, “Madness”, saw them teaming up with Manchester rapper Tristan ‘Tris’ Henry and it hit the airwaves in September 2014. A throwback came in February 2015, when Cascada revisited “Reason”, a song from their ‘Diamond’ era in 2004, and graced fans with a modern reinterpretation.\n\nMid-2015 saw Natalie Horler taking a brief hiatus due to her impending motherhood, with several shows getting postponed. In December, Cascada was back on stage with concerts in various countries, and a notable New Year’s Eve performance in London.\n\nMuch of 2016 witnessed Horler touring, especially in Norway and the UK. That year, in collaboration with Brazilian producer Cassiano, Cascada released a rendition of “Praise You” by Mary Mary.\n\nAfter a hiatus in 2016, January 2017 saw the release of “Run”. Rather than planning a full album, the group continued to favor single releases. In April, they unveiled “Playground”, the anthem of the 2017 Ice Hockey World Championship. The song echoed in stadiums as Horler performed it live at the opening ceremony.\n\n2018’s summer season introduced the song “Back For Good”, and fans also enjoyed a remixed version of their classic “Everytime We Touch” by Hardwell and Maurice West.\n\nFast forward to 2019, and Cascada presented “Like the Way I Do”, which Horler fondly spoke of. The subsequent year, in 2020, a softer ballad iteration of this track emerged, followed by a cover of “I’m Feeling It (In the Air)”— a return to Cascada’s dance anthem roots.\n\n2021 brought more musical gifts. Horler shared the news of their upcoming single, “One Last Dance”, set for June and highlighting a collaboration with the ’80s synth band, Trans-X. By November, another joint venture took shape when Cascada, alongside Timmy Trumpet and Harris & Ford, unveiled “Never Let Me Go”. It was followed by a tour. On 27 May 2022 she released a Kyanu remix of the song “Bad boy”.\n\nIn January and February 2023 they toured in the USA."
