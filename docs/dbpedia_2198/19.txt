Cascada (pronounced /kæˈskɑːdə/[1][2]) is a German Eurodance, Cascada consists of singer Natalie Horler, and producers DJ Manian and Yanou.

Music career

Early Years (2004-2005)

When Natalie Horler was 17, she was doing studio work for various DJs. Eventually; she met Yann Pfeiffer (stagename Yanou) and Manuel Reuter (stagename DJ Manian). Originally, they released music under the name, Cascade, but due to another artist with a similar name threatening a suit, they changed it to Cascada.[3] Under Andorfine Records, they produced their debut and hit single, "Miracle", and its follow-up, "Bad Boy", in Germany.[4] This caught the attention of American dance label, Robbins Entertainment. They negotiated a contract and "Miracle" was released in 2004.[5] However, it did not attract much attention, so Cascada offered them "Everytime We Touch".

Everytime We Touch (2005-2007)

Cascada experienced mainstream success in the United Kingdom and the United States almost a year after releasing their second American single, "Everytime We Touch", which interpolates the chorus of a 1992 Maggie Reilly song of the same name.[6][7] The song gained platinum and gold certifications across the globe, being certified platinum by the RIAA.[8][9] Soon after the popularity of the single skyrocketed, an album was quickly recorded and released (in a matter of months),[10] and a music video for "Everytime We Touch" was also distributed for promotion.[11] For these reasons, the debut album maintains a very similar formula throughout, to the extent of near-identical tempo and beats.

In all, eight singles were released from the album, four of which have been released in the United Kingdom; "Everytime We Touch", "Truly Madly Deeply" (originally by Savage Garden),"Miracle" and "A Neverending Dream" all of which gained top 10 status apart from "A Neverending Dream", which charted at #46.[12] Their album Everytime We Touch has experienced success in the UK Album chart where it remained up in the top forty for twenty-four weeks, peaking at #2.[13][14] The album experienced success on the U.S. charts as well.[15] The success of the album gained them two World Music Award nominations, winning them World's Best-Selling German Artist.[16]

Perfect Day (2007-2008)

Natalie Horler first announced that Cascada were working on their second album during a Japanese interview, which was posted on their blog on MySpace.[17] There are a few cover songs on the album, most notably Avril Lavigne's "Sk8er Boi", P!nk's "Just Like A Pill", Patti Smith's "Because the Night" and the Jeffrey Steele song "What Hurts the Most", as well as two tracks, "Endless Summer" and "I Will Believe It" that were previously recorded by Natalie Horler and DJ Manian under the Siria name.[18] However, the U.S. release replaced the Siria songs,[19] P!nk, and Avril Lavigne covers with three newer tracks, because they did not have the North American Rights. Two of these songs were "Faded", a cover of a Kate DeAraugo song, and "Holiday", a cover of a song recorded earlier by such different artists as Venke Knutson, Nylon, and Jenny May. The sophomore effort was released at the end of 2007 in the UK, and several parts of Northern Europe.[20] Perfect Day was released to the remaining markets, in the first quarter of 2008, with the U.S. release being the last. Natalie, also, stated in a French Interview, before the release, that she would take a hand in writing parts of the album.[21] However, none of the final tracks on the album were written by her.[22]

The world-wide lead single, "What Hurts the Most", was released in late 2007 and early 2008, along with its B-side, a cover of Wham!'s "Last Christmas".[23] The single had high success, reaching the top tier in most countries.[24] The U.K. and German follow-up to "What Hurts the Most", is "What Do You Want From Me?",[25][26] originally thought to be called "Tell Me Why".[27][28]The third release from the album will be "Because The Night".[29][30] The video was offically released on YouTube on May 28, 2008.[31] The single will be released throught out Europe towards the end of July. A limited bonus edition of the second album which will feature the songs that are included on the American version is set to be released around Europe around the end of July 2008.

On June 30, 2008, it was annouced that the second single to be released in America will be "Faded", which appears only on the American version of Perfect Day.[32]

Third Album (2008-present)

On April 10, 2008, Natalie announced on her official blog, that work on the third album will soon commence.[33] On her Radio 1 show, Jo Whiley announced that Coldplay’s Chris Martin will work with Cascada on new material though this has yet to be officially announced.[34][35][36][37] It is unknown if this will be production, writing, or vocals.[38][39] It is rumoured that a song called Come To Me, comfirmed by AATW will be on the third album. Another track also rumored to be on the new album will be a cover of La Bouche's Sweet Dreams.
