        "text": "Award winning Speculative Fiction author Larry Niven is doing fine after two medical procedures. He has had a cornea transplant to correct cataracts, and has also had a bit of melanoma (skin cancer) nipped from behind his right ear. He is healing well, although he is experiencing blurry version and minor itching as he heals.\n\nLarry Niven, 83. is one of the most recognized names in science fiction.\n\nMany of Niven’s stories are classed together as the Tales of Known Space because they all share a common fictional Known Space universe, in which humanity shares the several habitable star systems nearest to the Sun with over a dozen alien species, including the aggressive feline Kzinti and the very intelligent but cowardly Pierson’s Puppeteers, which are frequently central characters. The Ringworld series is part of the Tales of Known Space, and Niven has shared the setting with other writers since a 1988 anthology, The Man-Kzin Wars (Baen Books, jointly edited with Jerry Pournelle and Dean Ing). There have been several volumes of short stories and novellas.\n\nMuch of his writing since the 1970s has been in collaboration, particularly with Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes, but also Brenda Cooper and Edward M. Lerner.\n\nHe is a popular guest at Science Fiction conventions and an active member of SFWA (Science Fiction Writers of America)and LASFS (Los Angeles Science Fiction Society). It is his voice you hear in the opening title sequence for SCIFI.radio’s flagship radio show, The Event Horizon.\n\nMr. Niven is expected to make a full recovery from his medical procedures. We wish him a safe and speedy recovery\n\n-30-"
