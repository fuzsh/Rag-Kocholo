        "text": "Larry Niven is an American science fiction writer. He writes fiction at every length, and has penned speculative articles, speeches, TV scripts, graphic novels, and even political action in support of space conquest: SDI (Space Defense Initiative â€“ or Star Wars) was drafted at his house. Niven often works with other writers; several of his most recent titles, including the forthcoming The Seascape Tattoo with Steven Barnes, are collaborative. While many of his works have earned acclaim, Niven is best known for Ringworld, which won the Hugo, Nebula, and Ditmar awards."
