        "text": "Praise for Books\n\n“The ideological differences inevitably lead to clashes as tension between the humans mounts en route to the thrilling climax. This excellent series finale sticks the landing.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n“Niven is superb.” —Boston Globe, praise for the author\n\n“Niven is a galaxy-class storyteller.” —Time magazine, praise for the author\n\n“A cat-and-mouse chase in which role-playing serves as perfect training for heroics and survival.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“May demand and will certainly repay more than one reading.” —Booklist\n\n“Unadulterated wish fulfillment.” —Locus\n\n“Urbane, assured, and at ease, narrator Bronson Pinchot sounds like he’s sitting on a white leather couch reading this collection of smart short stories and essays in a postmodern penthouse overlooking—well, the universe. With its finely honed eye and ear for scientific realism and thoughtful detail, this collection of ahead-of-their-time gems covers some of Larry Niven’s favorite topics…At eighty years old, Niven remains one of the true grand masters of science fiction, and with Pinchot’s nuanced reading we also find that there’s a very human side to all that hard science, as well. A fine and fun listening experience. Winner of the AudioFile Earphones Award.” —AudioFile\n\n“The setting of Niven’s 1984 novel The Integral Trees was striking and imaginative, even for this acclaimed world builder; it’s well worth the second visit made in this sequel….A wonderful imaginary world, where people can fly like birds and ponds full of fish hang in midair.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“Niven has come up with an idea about as far out as one can get…This is certainly classic science fiction—the idea is truly the hero.” —Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine\n\n“A new Known Space book, particularly one with new information about Puppeteers and their doings behind the scenes of human history, needs recommending within the science fiction community about as much as a new Harry Potter novel does, well, anywhere. But Niven and Lerner have produced a novel that can stand on its own as well as part of the Known Space franchise.” —Locus\n\n“A strong, complicated entry.” —Alternative-Worlds.com\n\n“An absorbing mix of problems and puzzles and conflicts, space battles and interrogations and negotiations, shot through with fresh takes on familiar tropes and themes. It more than holds its own in the Known Space canon, which ought to be recommendation enough.” —Locus\n\n“[Niven and Lerner] clearly enjoy revisiting aliens familiar from Niven’s menagerie while spinning an elaborate tale of interplanetary intrigue. Their many fans will, too.” —Booklist\n\n“Larry Niven lives up to his award-winning reputation in this enthralling saga sure to please science-fiction fans everywhere.” —Midwest Book Review\n\n“[Niven] showcases his ability to use SF to explore mind-boggling, universal questions…taken altogether, [the stories] radiate Niven’s wit and technological inventiveness.” —Booklist\n\n“Great story telling is still alive in science fiction because of Larry Niven, and his finest work is the Ringworld series.” —Orson Scott Card\n\n“Larry Niven’s 1970 Hugo Award winner, Ringworld, is arguably one of the most influential science fiction novels of the past fifty years…It’s clear that Ringworld hasn’t just become a cultural staple because it’s a good idea: its inspirational power comes from Niven’s success in bringing it to life. The sense of scale and wonder is joyful. I challenge you to read it without feeling awestruck.” —Guardian (London)\n\n“Niven…lifts readers far from the conventional world—and does it with dash.” —Los Angeles Times, praise for the author\n\n“A solidly satisfying story. Series fans and lovers of gaming fiction should enjoy this action-filled collaboration.” —Library Journal\n\n“Niven…lifts readers far from the conventional world—and does it with dash.” —Los Angeles Times, praise for the author\n\n“Niven has come up with an idea about as far out as one can get…This is certainly classic science fiction—the idea is truly the hero.” —Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine\n\n“Niven’s masterly use of SF strategies once more hits every note, springing surprises and plot turns with dizzying pace.” —Los Angeles Times\n\n“Exceptional freshness and suspense…Full of startling revelations about human and puppeteer politics.” —Booklist\n\n“Niven and Lerner have produced a novel that can stand on its own as well as part of the Known Space franchise.” —Locus\n\n“The plethora of aliens and action will appeal to Niven stalwarts and fans of old-fashioned hard SF.” —Booklist\n\n“Niven and Lerner…adroitly expand upon familiar ground…and, at the same time, pour it into an entirely new bottle.” —Starlog\n\n“A lively prequel to Niven’s 1970 classic, Ringworld…Fans of hard SF will be well rewarded.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“The stories are full of the unique perspectives of these travelers and their accounts of their home planets. Rick Schumann is characterized as the classic bartender by narrator Tom Weiner. He is inventive in his characterizations of the visitors who engage Schumann over the bar. Weiner gives the same attention to short pieces that he does to full stories and provides continuity without being overbearing.” —AudioFile\n\n“Niven’s masterly use of SF strategies hits every note and springs surprises and plot turns with dizzying pace. Niven…lifts readers far from the conventional world—and does it with dash.” —Los Angeles Times\n\n“[Grover Gardner] captures the personalities of the travelers through individual vocalization and provides smooth, expressive narration. The listener is soon caught up in the adventures of these vivid characters as they struggle to survive…A rousing adventure.” —AudioFile\n\n“A clever twist on the game-within-a-game trope is at the heart of this well-plotted romp that combines live-action role playing with political intrigue while paying homage to H.G. Wells. The authors emphasize the plotting and gaming aspects with great success while juggling an enormous cast of characters…A well-written story with plenty of plot twists in return.” —RT Book Reviews\n\n“Niven is a galaxy-class storyteller.” —Time, praise for the author\n\n“Tying together many story threads, the final title in the \"Fleet of Worlds\" series (a prequel to Niven's \"Ringworld\" series) brings to a stunning close a multivolume saga that has captured the imaginations of a multitude of readers…Coauthors Niven and Lerner use their expertise in depicting memorable human and alien characters to enhance a story that will attract attention from series fans as well as readers of hard sf.” —Library Journal\n\n“Good, old-fashioned SF, packed with ideas, philosophical musings, and plenty of space action.” —Library Journal\n\n“An excellent audio book…Weiner really shines in his reading. New listeners and Niven fans alike will enjoy this audio immensely. —Soundcommentary.com\n\n“Exceptional freshness and suspense…full of startling revelations about human and puppeteer politics.” —Booklist\n\n“There’s joy and sadness and everything in between in these stories—which seem to have been devised as vehicles for Niven to explore a wide variety of ideas and also happen to be about what it means to be human.” —RT Book Reviews (4 stars)\n\n“Niven jams enough ideas for several novels into each one he creates.” —Seattle Times\n\n“Niven’s style is such that you can be awed, then titillated, then amused all on the same page…After more than thirty years, the story remains interesting, and the ideas fascinating. I highly recommend this audiobook, whether you’ve experienced Ringworld already or not. I enjoyed every minute.” —SFFAudio\n\n“Old-fashioned cerebral science fiction, with a huge array of fascinating aliens, subtle interactions between them, and knotty problems for them to solve.” —Kirkus Reviews\n\n“Intriguing human and alien characters and lucid scientific detail.” —Library Journal\n\n“I enjoyed nearly every minute of the nine and a half hours of listening in Ringworld’s Children. In fact, I would have been happy with another nine hours!” —SFFAudio.com\n\n“[Gardner] skillfully uses inflection and timing to heighten drama or highlight humorous details as appropriate. Parker deftly brings to life Louis Wu and other members of the ‘motley crew’…This is SF—and narration—at its best.” —Kliatt\n\n“[A] fine…entry into the ‘known space’ canon…If you haven’t read any Niven novels before this one, go listen to Protector and Ringworld first. Then, if you are as enchanted as I was with it, come back to Fleet of Worlds for more. Tom Weiner, who is one of Blackstone Audio’s new narrators, previously heard in A Galaxy Trilogy, brings authority to the narrative of Fleet of Worlds.” —SFFAudio.com"
