        "text": "Larry Niven is an American author of hard science fiction, best known for his Ringworld series, which is part of the largely Known Space universe. Much like Isaac Asimov, his books follow a set of rules, which include:\n\nNever fire a laser at a mirror.\n\nGiving up freedom for security is beginning to look naive.\n\nIt is easier to destroy than to create.\n\nEthics change with technology.\n\nThe only universal message in science fiction: There exist minds that think as well as you do, but differently.\n\nLarry Niven became a published author in 1966 with the novel World of Ptavvs – part of the Known Space universe.
