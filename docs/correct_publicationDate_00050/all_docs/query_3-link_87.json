It does share the same setting as two of his other novels, The Integral Trees (1983) and The Smoke Ring (1987) as well as the short story \"The Kiteman\". All three novels feature the totalitarian interplanetary State, \"corpsicle\" personality transfers into mind-wiped criminals without civil rights, police-like enforcers called \"checkers,\" and a computer artificial intelligence personality in charge of a ramship expedition that seeds life in other systems to prepare them for human colonization.\n\nTwo minutes."
