        "text": "Leaving Earth, the crew of the spaceshipÂ DisciplineÂ were prepared for a routine assignment. Dispatched by the all-powerful State on a mission of interstellar exploration and colonization,Â DisciplineÂ was aidedâand secretly spied uponâby Sharls Davis Kendy, an emotionless computer intelligence programmed to monitor the loyalty and obedience of the crew. What they weren't prepared for, however, was the Smoke Ringâan immense, gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free fall. WhenÂ DisciplineÂ encountered it, something went wrong. The crew abandoned ship and fled to the unlikely space oasis.\n\nFive hundred years later, the descendants of theÂ DisciplineÂ crew living on the Smoke Ring no longer remember their origins. Earth is more myth than memory, and no recollection of the State remains. But Kendy remembers. And just outside the Smoke Ring,Â DisciplineÂ waits patiently to make contact with its wayward children."
