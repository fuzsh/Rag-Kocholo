        "text": "Not a comfortable listen\n\nI'm a big fan of many Larry Niven books, and this was not a bad novel, it was just uncomfortable and I wasn't looking for a story on mankind's yin and yang. As a note, I accidentally got book 2 in a sale and have not listened to book 1, so I may have missed some key elements from the previous book. The narrative seems to indicate that people tend toward authoritarian leadership. I'm not a student of history and it may well be true that a majority of cultures have tended toward an authoritarian type government, but I would hope for better. It's also a fact that I haven't read ?book 3? assuming it exists and it may lead us into a utopian government run by the people where good sense, kindness and intelligence rule. The biggest part that was just not comfortable was with the state sponsored sex trafficking and world view that women's worth is in their ability to make babies. Again, history may show this has been a relatively common view, but not something I wanted to be prevalent in a book I'm reading for enjoyment. The story was well written, the characters have depth, and the narration was very good, but it wasn't a story I wanted to listen to for enjoyment. If I was studying history of governments or women's studies, this book may have a lot to dig into. If you are looking for a light read, I would shy away from this book. If you are looking for a thought provoking book where you have to work to understand the environment/universe where it takes place and make judgement on social norms, this might be a good series to read/listen. You might want to start with book 1 though. :D\n\nOne of my favorite books is by Larry Niven\n\nThis is the second in that series\n\nI'll Jane to twisted to it but on first listen I guess I'd have to say it was hard to stay involved\n\nBUT I may have been not paying attention and I will listen again.\n\nSo i listened again. Just to make sure.\n\nNot my cup of tea. Slow uninteresting and a weird ending.\n\nA big pile of Who Cares\n\nI very rarely drop a book, but this one is an exception. Chapter 2 is so dreadfully dull and spatially confusing that it it made me completely lose interest.\n\nEDIT: I have since stuck it out and finished the book. I am sticking with my original assessment: a big pile of \"Who cares.\" Lots of action, but since this silly world gets described piecemeal, it is merely annoying rather than exciting. I think this is one of those books in which the author probably had a lot more fun while writing it than most will have while reading it."
