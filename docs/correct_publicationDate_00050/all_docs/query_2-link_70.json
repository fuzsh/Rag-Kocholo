Bentley Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a geeky kid all my life. (I don’t think I’ve quite grown up yet.) Born in the 1970s, my childhood was a wonderful playground of building robots and software. I was awarded one of the early degrees in AI, and a PhD in genetic algorithms. I’ve since spent 25 years exploring how to make computers think, build, invent, compose… and I’ve also spent 20 years writing popular science books. I’m lucky enough to be a Professor in one of the world’s best universities for Computer Science and Machine Learning: UCL, and I guess I’ve written two or three hundred scientific papers over the years. I still think I know nothing at all about real or artificial intelligence, but then does anyone?\n\nPeter's book list on no hype and no nonsense artificial intelligence\n\nWhy did Peter love this book?\n\nOK, I’m biased here because Rob is an old friend of mine. We first met at academic conferences and had several heated debates (arguments). But after spending a little time together at a workshop we realised each probably knew what they were talking about after all. Robert Elliott Smith, I should make clear it's not the Rob Smith who writes about “Artificial Superintelligence”. Those books definitely do not make this list.\n\nOur Rob is a coherent, grounded scientist with bags of real-world experience, and he brings his knowledge to this title with gusto, telling us about how AI is affecting our lives in ways you never thought possible – and often not in a good way. If you want to understand what can go wrong with AI and what we should be doing to stop it, don’t read about singularities or other such nonsense, read this.\n\nBy Robert Elliott Smith,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Rage Inside the Machine as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nShortlisted for the 2020 Business Book Awards\n\nWe live in a world increasingly ruled by technology; we seem as governed by technology as we do by laws and regulations. Frighteningly often, the influence of technology in and on our lives goes completely unchallenged by citizens and governments. We comfort ourselves with the soothing refrain that technology has no morals and can display no prejudice, and it's only the users of technology who distort certain aspects of it.\n\nBut is this statement actually true? Dr Robert Smith thinks it is dangerously untrue in the modern era.\n\nHaving worked in the field…\n\nPreview\n\nAI\n\nBy Margaret A.

This book is an easy-to-read and beautifully-written introduction to Artificial Intelligence, which tells some of the recent history while explaining how and why intelligence is much harder to make than many of the pundits seem to think. No nonsense here – a good solid read by a hugely experienced scientist at the top of her field.\n\nBy Margaret A. Boden,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked AI as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe applications of Artificial Intelligence lie all around us; in our homes, schools and offices, in our cinemas, in art galleries and - not least - on the Internet. The results of Artificial Intelligence have been invaluable to biologists, psychologists, and linguists in helping to understand the processes of memory, learning, and language from a fresh angle.\n\nAs a concept, Artificial Intelligence has fuelled and sharpened the philosophical debates concerning the nature of the mind, intelligence, and the uniqueness of human beings. Margaret A. Boden reviews the philosophical and technological challenges raised by Artificial Intelligence, considering whether programs could ever…\n\nPreview\n\nArtifictional Intelligence\n\nBy Harry Collins,\n\nFrom my list on no hype and no nonsense artificial intelligence.\n\nBy Peter J. Bentley Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a geeky kid all my life. (I don’t think I’ve quite grown up yet.) Born in the 1970s, my childhood was a wonderful playground of building robots and software. I was awarded one of the early degrees in AI, and a PhD in genetic algorithms. I’ve since spent 25 years exploring how to make computers think, build, invent, compose… and I’ve also spent 20 years writing popular science books. I’m lucky enough to be a Professor in one of the world’s best universities for Computer Science and Machine Learning: UCL, and I guess I’ve written two or three hundred scientific papers over the years.

His writing is considered and grounded, which is exactly what you need when discussing the hype that forever seems to surround AI. This book is another look at this topic and finds yet more ways to explain to readers the difference between human intelligence and our algorithmic attempts at intelligence – which are frequently pretty stupid.\n\nBy Harry Collins,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Artifictional Intelligence as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nRecent startling successes in machine intelligence using a technique called 'deep learning' seem to blur the line between human and machine as never before. Are computers on the cusp of becoming so intelligent that they will render humans obsolete? Harry Collins argues we are getting ahead of ourselves, caught up in images of a fantastical future dreamt up in fictional portrayals. The greater present danger is that we lose sight of the very real limitations of artificial intelligence and readily enslave ourselves to stupid computers: the 'Surrender'.\n\nBy dissecting the intricacies of language use and meaning, Collins shows how far…\n\nPreview\n\nOn\n\nBy Adam Roberts,\n\nFrom my list on no hype and no nonsense artificial intelligence.\n\nBy Peter J.

Why do computer scientists like this kind of thing? I think it’s because we invent mind-bending mathematical worlds in which our algorithms live – we like to explore the strange and weird. When reading this book, at first you wonder if this is science fiction at all – the story seems fantastical. But check out the Appendix and there’s the scientific explanation, complete with equations for the weird laws of physics. Now, this is a proper hard science fiction book… somehow disguised almost as a fairy tale. A lovely read and the ending is suitably in keeping with the rest of the story… Unexpected.\n\nBy Adam Roberts,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked On as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTighe lives on the wall. It towers above his village and falls away below it. It is vast and unforgiving and it is everything he knows. Life is hard on the wall, little more than a clinging on for dear life. And then one day Tighe falls off the wall. And falls, and falls, and falls ...Lavishly praised everywhere from Asimov's magazine to Interzone, ON is proof positive that Adam Roberts is a new author whose potential for greatness is rapidly being realised.

Professionally, I study graduate astrophysics and research the ways high-energy celestial objects impact cosmic evolution. Creatively, I use my training to write science fiction horror exploring the spookiest things the universe has to offer. I particularly love stories that throw wrenches in the best-laid plans of star-faring protagonists, and will never get tired of a good old space mission gone terribly and tragically awry.\n\nNess' book list on sci-fi about space missions gone terribly wrong\n\nWhy did Ness love this book?\n\nBiko and The Thief follows Lindewe Glover, a thief attempting to rob the starship Stephen S. Biko while its passengers are in stasis.\n\nAfter her attempt is derailed, she must reckon not only with the ship’s mother AI and unforeseen defenses, space pirates, and the dangers of deep space, but also with the prospect of spending the Biko’s entire flight time awake and alone.\n\nHer profession may be dubious, but her plight is anyone’s nightmare. Greene’s episodic storytelling will leave you curious about Lindi’s survival and the repercussions of her foiled theft.\n\nBy Kevin Greene,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Biko And The Thief as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nPreview\n\nAncillary Mercy\n\nBy Ann Leckie,\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi featuring world-changing female badasses.\n\nBy Andrew Sweet Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always loved science fiction. My father was an Asimov junkie, and our house was packed with science fiction novels and stories from Azimov to Heinlein to Wyndham and Wilhelm. I began writing science fiction in high school, yet only recently published my first 4 novels (one of which won a Bookfest award). I hold a bachelor’s degree in computer science (bioinformatics), and I stay on top of science to inform my writing. It’s through this background that I select novels, seeking out new tropes and ideas in technological advancement. Each of these novels I mention exceeded my expectations and then some. Pick one up today—you won’t be disappointed!\n\nAndrew's book list on sci-fi featuring world-changing female badasses\n\nWhy did Andrew love this book?\n\nWhat a phenomenal novel by Ann Leckie! I came across Ann Leckie’s series as I was working through books about cloning while I was writing my books. What do I love about it? The concepts, for sure: AI ships being negotiated, the entire idea of shipping minds around, a leader who sabotages herself to the detriment of her realm. All of these have been done to some extent before, but not at the scale that Ann Leckie takes on. She also manages to avoid some dead clone tropes and dead or dying AI tropes while she entertains. This novel (and series) were done well and the characters pop with personality. Loved it!\n\nBy Ann Leckie,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Ancillary Mercy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBreq and her crew must stand against an old and powerful enemy, the Lord of the Radch, and fight for the right to determine their own destinies in the stunning conclusion to the NYT bestselling Imperial Radch trilogy A must read for fans of Ursula K. Le Guin and James S. A. Corey.\n\nFor a moment, things seemed to be under control for Breq, the soldier who used to be a warship. Then a search of Athoek Station's slums turns up someone who shouldn't exist, and a messenger from the mysterious Presger empire arrives, as does Breq's enemy, the divided…\n\nPreview\n\nSkyward\n\nBy Brandon Sanderson,\n\nFrom my list on teens grappling with the line between good and evil.\n\nBy R.J. Vickers Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a fantasy author, I have always been drawn to magic and alternative universes as a way of exploring the issues that seem unsolvable here on earth. We are so entrenched in our own ways of seeing the world that it can be hard to imagine looking at things from a different perspective, but twisting these ideas sideways and adding a dash of magic can remind us that everything exists in shades of grey. Teenagers are learning to think abstractly and explore their own relationships with ethics, and I have vivid memories of being drawn to moral ambiguity at that age.\n\nR.J.'s book list on teens grappling with the line between good and evil\n\nWhy did R.J. love this book?\n\nAt the beginning, readers are drawn into an exciting world where humans battle to save their desolate planet from an alien race. But in typical Brandon Sanderson fashion, good and evil are not clear-cut, and the conflict soon grows far more complex.\n\nAs the series progresses, the main character, Spensa, discovers that the battle for her planet is not as straightforward as she had once thought, and that the aliens she had fought were neither uniform nor uniformly evil. When she infiltrates an alien homeland in Book 2, Spensa is forced to question her original assumptions about who deserves to be saved—not just humans, but maybe also some alien races and even artificially intelligent beings.\n\nBy Brandon Sanderson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Skyward as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSpensa's world has been under attack for hundreds of years. An alien race called the Krell leads onslaught after onslaught from the sky in a never-ending campaign to destroy humankind. Humanity's only defense is to take to their ships and fight the enemy in the skies. Pilots have become the heroes of what's left of the human race.\n\nSpensa has always dreamed of being one of them; of soaring above Earth and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, placing Spensa's chances…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Risen Empire\n\nBy Scott Westerfeld,\n\nFrom my list on science fiction and fantasy for exploring new worlds.\n\nBy Ronald A. Geobey Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile Dune, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica (1980s), and other SF staples laid the foundation for my love of SFF, I was also reading about the universe from a young age. Along came Star Trek: The Next Generation in the ‘90s and the stage was set. Completing Bachelor’s Degrees in Ancient History & Archaeology; Religions & Theology; and a PhD in Near and Middle Eastern Studies copper-fastened my passion for the ancient world and the history of religion, and along with reading historical fiction and fantasy, everything merged into the almost allegorical universe you’ll find in Kiranis. Lovers of all the above will find something here.\n\nRonald's book list on science fiction and fantasy for exploring new worlds\n\nWhy did Ronald love this book?\n\nI had been reading Heroic and Epic Fantasy for years, and I’d purposely avoided reading Sci-Fi, convinced that it would influence my burgeoning plot development. I wanted to maintain my plot integrity and not be subconsciously led by other authors in the genre (but of course I couldn’t avoid the influence of the SF I watched on TV). Of course, I was missing out on some great writing. I was enthralled by this story—it combined an undead trope with space opera, as the ‘risen empire’ maintains its territory while facing an external threat from the technologically hybrid Rix. There’s a fascination with the potential of biological augmentation and the place of AI in our distant future (consider ‘immortal’ humans against potentially ‘eternal’ hybrid humans), but this story is extremely character-driven and concerned with the place of the individual. The fictional science was breathtaking and not without research, but what stuck…\n\nBy Scott Westerfeld,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Risen Empire as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe undead Emperor has ruled his mighty interstellar empire of 80 human worlds for 1600 years. Because he can grant a form of eternal life-after-death, creating an elite known as the Risen, his power is absolute. He and his sister, the Child Empress, who is eternally a little girl, are worshipped as living gods. No one can touch them. No until the Rix, machine-augmented humans who worship planetary Al compound minds. The Rix are cool, relentless fanatics, and their only goal I to propagate such Als throughout the galaxy. They seek to end, by any means necessary, the Emperor's prolonged…\n\nPreview\n\nHellspark\n\nBy Janet Kagan,\n\nWhy did Jim love this book?\n\nThis is one of my favorite books, period. I love the warmth and heart Kagan puts into her writing.\n\nHellspark is a far-future science fictional murder mystery set on an alien world. Tocohl Susumo, an expert on languages and cultures, is sent to investigate. The suspects—the planetary survey team—are a powder keg of fascinating, but clashing, cultures and backgrounds.\n\nHelping Tocohl is her ship’s AI, Lord Margaret Lynn, aka “Maggie.” Maggie is, quite simply, the best. She’s childlike in many ways, but also loyal and clever and so much fun. The relationship between Tocohl and Maggie reminds you of a loving parent-child partnership.\n\nBy Janet Kagan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hellspark as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTocohl Susumo finds her plans to attend the festival of St. Veschke interrupted by her rescue of a young woman and her subsequent involvement in a mystery in Lassti\n\nPreview"
