        "text": "Norman Babbitt , August 29, 2013\n\nFor me, this is one of the greatest works of science fiction that I've read. It is right up there with Herbert's novel, \"Dune.\" This novel does better than any other I've come across dealing with a first encounter with an alien civilization. The superb writing, and unique plot, and the unfolding of the interaction with an intelligent alien species, who's mindset and agenda are very different than humanity's, is incredibly rich and intriguing. I've read this work several times throughout my life and it has always engaged my imagination."
