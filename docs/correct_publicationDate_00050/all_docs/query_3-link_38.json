        "text": "I've been reading the works of Larry Niven. So far I've read 'Ringworld,' 'Protector,' and 'Fleet of Worlds.' I've also listened to some of 'World of Ptavs' on audiobook. These books, and many more, though not all, are all part of his Known Space series. I love it. Like the Roddenberry and other producers and writers of Star Trek created their own races, cultures, and continuing history within the Star Trek universe, Larry Niven has done the same in his Known Space series. I particularly love the Kzin, especially since I also wanted Star Trek to have an alien race of cat-like people. I was overjoyed when I read Ringworld and out that Niven created such a race. It's also fun to see him develop as a writer and change with the times. In his early works, women aren't taken very seriously (though I don't blame him for that, that was a part of the time), but as the books have gone on, there have been some very strong female characters, such as in Fleet of Worlds.\n\nAnyone else like his work?\n\nLarry's an interesting one in that over time he seems to have become less liked.\n\nI remember being at a UK convention about 4-5 years ago and Ringworld's nomination as one of the best SF novels of the past 50 years or so being regarded with derision by many there... but it was a Hugo & Nebula winner (despite the dodgy (now corrected) science). I remember loads of original ideas in there - Jo Walton says the same.\n\nIs it a case of the man's personality outweighing his writing - well known as a man who came into an inheritance and therefore wealthy and along with Jerry a noted right-winger/Republican? Might be.\n\nI liked and have signed copies of The Mote in God's Eye (not totally Niven, admittedly). I liked his Known Space short stories more than his novels - Inconstant Moon was great, for example - . but some of his later work left me cold.\n\nLarry's an interesting one in that over time he seems to have become less liked.\n\nI remember being at a UK convention about 4-5 years ago and Ringworld's nomination as one of the best SF novels of the past 50 years or so being regarded with derision by many there... but it was a Hugo & Nebula winner (despite the dodgy (now corrected) science).

But I feel like Ringworld has more going for it than against it. The technology and world-building is incredible. I wanted to explore a world wrapped around a star like a ribbon. I've read that book twice in the last couple of years, and the second time was more rewarding than the first.\n\nWow! Do so many readers truly hate Ringworld now?\n\nI was surprised too. However, it was a UK convention, which may explain it. And I think that it was more to do with the author rather than the book. Older attendees told me of an infamous UK convention (I'm thinking Eastercon 1979, possibly?) where Larry did not make himself many friends and I was told gave one of the most boring, rambling and inappropriate speeches ever.\n\nDon't know myself - I wasn't there - but I have realised that such things are often the focus of awards rather than the book itself...\n\nI felt that Way (disappointed) about Oath of Fealty which he Wrote with Pournelle https://www.amazon.com/Oath-Fealty-...keywords=Oath+of+Fealty&qid=1575233824&sr=8-2\n\nthe first time I read it when it was first published but on rereading it a few years later I put up as the best of their books of the period... I also enjoyed Dream Park he wrote with Barns but found the later books they set in that future no where near as good.\n\nbut now I think they are right up with the best things he wrote in the early 1980s\n\nThe point that I made badly in the above, was that how you react to a book is strongly influenced by where the reader is in his life and emotional state when he reads the book. In my case when I first read Oath of Fealty I had just broken up with my long term lady... but even worse the dream job I had at the time when the Company went bankrupt.... add in a physical injury with a long recovery period and I was at the low ebb of my life in 1980..... it colors how you view everything not just books and when I react badly to a book or film that is otherwise getting good reviews I mark it down as something that I will need to go back and take a second look in the future. Even something like a case of the winter blues, perhaps coupled with a dose of the flu, can have a surprising effect on your perception of a book, film, TV show, Restaurant, ETC. so I try not to be too quick to judge these days.... if I can't give something 3 out of 5 * in a review I just don't review it. I am too aware of my own failings to want of affect some authors chances by posting a 1 or 2 star review on amazon or good reads or even here.\n\nI've always liked Niven, but tend to feel that his strength was in world-building and ideas - the Ringworld is the most famous example, but there's also the Smoke Ring, the far future State, Known Space, etc. In terms of the actual writing, I generally prefer his shorter fiction, but he's one of those authors where I can often enjoy the work without necessarily having a complex story or characters, in part because of the setting (although not always the case, see Destiny's Road or the collaboration he did with Gregory Benford - in both cases I liked the setting but have no interest in reading the books again) and also I think because they tend to be fairly fast-paced tales. The focus seems note so much on the characters as much as it does on the world around them.\n\npsikeyhackr , many SF is a crap. Examples of no crap are easy, and close on hand: Dune, Hyperion, Solaris, Stars my destination und so weiter. And why I think this novel is appalling as science fiction? I will cite words of other readers, it is simplest thing.\n\n- Niven/Pournelle are actually the perfect anti-Lems. While Lem thinks humanity is hopelessly inferior, here the aliens are fluffy little animals without mankinds sophistication.\n\n- There is only one female character. She is repeatedly described as \"demure\". She also giggles a lot. Eventually she falls in love with one of the male characters. The way they talk to each other had me cringing. It was like the book was written by a 12 year old schoolboy.\n\n- Most reviewers seem to have read this book as a younger person and look back on it through rose tinted glasses. I didn't have that pleasure.\n\n- The 'characters', and I use the term loosely, are corny comic book cliches, and I really couldn't give a damned about any of them. There was no sense of peril. I knew pretty much where the story was going early on, and much of the ride getting there was dull.\n\n- Enjoyed the ideas in this years ago but returning to it found the characters wooden and cliched with some very out of date racial cliches and rather right wing heroic aristocrats in space . Hasn't aged well .\n\nAnd so on. If I could express my opinion in my own language it would be more complete. But I don't think The Mote... is worth more of my time.\n\npsikeyhackr , many SF is a crap.

Absolutely! I don't care, though. We are not as woke as we like to think we are. Future generations are going to look back at us and scoff or be in horror at our ideas and viewpoints. As I said before, Niven grew far less sexist in his later work. As for the problems of older literature, it's possible to enjoy an old story, even if it's problematic."
