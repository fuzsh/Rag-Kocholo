"The Solipsist at Dinner"

Short story published in Elemental: The Tsunami Relief Anthology May, 2006.

Niven asks the age-old question, is reality simply a figment of our imagination?

The best way to meet, speak, and get your books autographed by Larry is to participate in a science fiction convention as Larry attends several each year.

Larry is often invited as "Guest of Honor" and often participates in science fiction or space technology discussion panels.
