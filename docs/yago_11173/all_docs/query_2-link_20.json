        "text": "And as New York City goes, that bar is absolutely packed. It’s Saturday night and Raquel and her friends, Diana and Alyssa, are having drinks at Spring Lounge. Raquel pushes her way through the crowd to flee a creepy, albeit smitten admirer (who may or not have been paid off by the groom). In the midst of her escape, she bumps into a group of tall, friendly gents, one being Dave, and they begin chatting. Raquel and Dave exchange names and share a few laughs over Sixpoint beers. This chance encounter would spark the beginning of their love story, along with many more laughs (and beers!). Fast forward to last summer. Dave and Raquel are eating and drinking their way through Paris and stop at the famed \"Wall of Love.” When Dave drops to one knee and asks Raquel to marry him, she responds, “Oui!\" We are so excited and thankful to share this incredible day with our loving family and friends!"
