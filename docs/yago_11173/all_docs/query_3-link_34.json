A Ph.D. scholarship from the French government allowed him to join the laser-matter interactions Physics graduate program at the University of Paris at Orsay. After a postdoc in near-field optics and spectroscopy with Steve Leone at JILA in Boulder, he joined the Chemistry Department at Indiana University Bloomington in 2001. There, he set up a laboratory that developed methods for the study of in-vitro virus self-assembly and of virus-inspired materials. The latest discovery is a room temperature super-radiant phase transition occurring in virus-templated fluorophore arrays. Other interests include the study of thermodynamically stable phases at nanoscale. Outside the lab, he enjoys hiking, alpine climbing, and building and sailing small wooden boats.\n\nApr. 5th SEAS ODIB Banquet:\n\n6pm – 8pm SEC 1.402\n\nThe BRIDGE Banquet is the cornerstone event of BRIDGE week. Student leaders at SEAS honor a SEAS alumnus or Harvard faculty member that has made an impact on society and paved the way for future generations of diverse engineers. Sponsored by the DIB Fellows in the Office for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. 2023 Keynote Speaker Demba Ba.\n\nProfessor Ba's interests lie at the intersection of theory, computing, and data, with diverse applications that range from computational neuroscience, multimedia signal processing, and network science. He received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2004 and the M.Sci. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA in 2006 and 2011, respectively. He went on to work as a Postdoctoral Associate with the MIT/Harvard Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory, where he developed theory and efficient algorithms to assess synchrony among large assemblies of neurons. In 2006 and 2009, he was a Summer Research Intern with the Communication and Collaboration Systems Group, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA. In 2009, Professor Ba and his collaborators developed the first algorithm that could use sound to inferm the goemetry of a room. This pioneering work has numerous implications for the design of smart soundscapes and for speech enhancement systems in highly-reverberant environment.\n\nWith a performance by Mariachi Veritas de Harvardhttps://mariachiveritasdeharvard.com/\n\nApr. 6th Student Affinity Organizations Mixer:\n\n6pm – 8pm SEC LL2 Atrium\n\nStudent clubs celebrating diversity in STEM deserve to be celebrated.
