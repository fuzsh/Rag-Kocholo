        "text": "Two UFC fighters are expecting a baby.\n\nTecia Torres and Raquel Pennington got married this past summer and Torries announced on Instagram on Thursday that she is pregnant.\n\n“We have a little extra to be thankful for this year. Happy Thanksgiving from our growing family to yours,” Torres wrote in the caption. “Baby Pennington coming June 2023. We are beyond excited and feel incredibly blessed. Mommies love you so much sweet baby and we can’t wait for this life with you.”\n\nIn her own announcement of the news, Pennington wrote, “We have an extra turkey in the oven this year. Happy Thanksgiving from our family to yours. Baby Pennington June 2023 #Rocknado $TeamRocky #TeamTiny #family #love #ivf #ivfpregnancy.”\n\nThe 33-year-old Torres told MMA Junkie that her career is on hold until 2024 as a result of the expected baby. Torres is 9-6 in UFC and 13-6 overall in professional MMA.\n\nPennington is 11-5 in UFC and 14-9 overall as a pro. She has won her last four fights and is slated to face Ketlen Vieira on Jan. 14, at UFC Fight Night 217.\n\n“We want the wedding of our dreams come Fall 2023,” Torres wrote on TikTok this past July, after announcing that she and Pennington had married. “You can help us make that dream come true and follow our journey by subscribing to our OFs page… Awaiting approval. Follow our adventurers, home life, behind the scenes, more of our personalities, and of course some cute pics.”"
