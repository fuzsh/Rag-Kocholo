        "text": "Raquel Torres Actress - Date of Birth 11 November 1908, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico\n\nBio Raquel Torres (born Paula Osterman in Hermosillo, Mexico) made an auspicious film debut at age 19 in Woody Van Dyke's White Shadows in the South Seas (1928), MGM's first film to have full synchronization for music, dialogue, and sound effects. Her film career lasted until 1934 when she married a successful businessman and retired. She was typically cast as a passionate Latina.\n\nBiography by Sandra Brennan\n\nhttp://www.allmovie.com/artist/raquel-torres-p71432\n\nRaquel Torres Actress | Soundtrack - Date of Birth 11 November 1908, Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico\n\nDate of Death 10 August 1987, Los Angeles, California, USA (complications following a stroke)\n\nBirth Name Paula Osterman\n\nHeight 5' 2\" (1.57 m)\n\nMini Bio (1) Fetching Raquel Torres had a very brief but sexy reign in Hollywood with the advent of sound, but late-night viewers can still get a sampling of this spitfire's charms in one zany piece of slapstick with The Marx Brothers.\n\nBorn Paula Osterman in Hermosillo, Mexico, on November 11, 1908, she arrived in films at the age of 19 and garnered instant attention and a flurry of wolf whistles in W.S. Van Dyke's White Shadows in the South Seas (1928), which remains best known as MGM's first film to synchronize music, dialogue and sound effects. This exquisite beauty appeared in the predominantly silent film as the lead femme opposite stoic Monte Blue. A bi-racial love story and morality play set in the South Pacific islands, this was supposedly the first film in which the MGM lion roared before the opening credits of the picture. The beautifully shot film went on to win the Best Cinematography Oscar.\n\nThe next year Raquel was third-billed behind Lili Damita and Ernest Torrence in The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1929), the first film version of the classic Thornton Wilder novel, which was a part-talkie. This Oscar winner (for Art Direction) was an early disaster movie that bonded a group of strangers who see their lives flash before their eyes while trapped on a collapsing bridge. Raquel's other 1929 film was The Desert Rider (1929), a standard oater in which she provided spicy diversion opposite cowboy star Tim McCoy.\n\nTorres continued the tropical island pace with The Sea Bat (1930) and Aloha (1931) playing various island girls and half-caste beauty types. In her last year of filming, she played a sexy foil to the raucous comedy teams of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey in So This Is Africa (1933) and Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, Harpo Marx and Zeppo Marx in Duck Soup (1933). It was Raquel who inspired Groucho's classic line, \"I could dance with you until the cows came home. On second thought, I'd rather dance with the cows until you came home.\"\n\nRaquel abruptly retired following her marriage to businessman Stephen Ames in 1935, who once was married to actress Adrienne Ames. Her husband later produced postwar \"B\" films including The Spanish Main (1945), Tycoon (1947) and Ride, Vaquero! (1953), but Raquel never returned to the film industry even with this her husband's \"in\" connection.\n\nAmes died on the 20th anniversary of their wedding in 1955 and Raquel later married actor Jon Hall, who also had his share of tropical island movies. but this marriage ended in divorce. She died of complications from an earlier stroke in 1987 in Los Angeles at the age of 78.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n\nSpouse (3)\n\nedit\n\nJon Hall (1959 - ?) (divorced)\n\nStephen Ames (22 April 1935 - 22 April 1955) (his death)\n\nJon Hall (? - ?) (remarried)\n\nTrivia (1) Former daughter-in-law of actor Felix Locher.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868799/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\n\nRaquel Torres (1908-1987) was a Mexican film actress born in Hermosillo, Mexico. She grew up in Hollywood. She starred in early sound films like White Shadows of the South Seas (1928) and Duck Soup (1933). The former was the first sound feature fully synchronized for dialogue, music, and effects. The latter was a famous 1933 Marx Brothers comedy, in which she played a would-be Mata Hari type.\n\nA 1930 movie entitled The Sea Bat featured the actress with actor Charles Bickford. The story begins with the death of her lover in the huge wings of a bat, underwater. Filmed in the tropics of southern Mexico, the backgrounds are resplendent in natural beauty. Miss Torres received favorable reviews as the Spanish girl whose character exemplifies the voodoo superstitions of the natives. Other films she appeared in were Under A Texas Moon, The Bridge of San Luis Rey, So This Is Africa, and Red Wagon. In 1931 Miss Torres came to the Loew`s State Theater in New York with a vaudeville act. The next year she appeared briefly on Broadway in John McDermott`s Adam Had Two Sons.\n\nIn October 1985 there was a fire in Malibu, California which damaged homes in the Las Flores Canyon area. Embers carried by wind across the wide Pacific Coast Highway ignited the roof of Raquel Torres` home. Her single story home was located at 22350 Pacific Coast Highway. The dwelling was 80% destroyed but the actress escaped unharmed, escorted by firefighters to safety.\n\nTorres died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California on August 10, 1987 at the age of 78.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquel_Torres"
