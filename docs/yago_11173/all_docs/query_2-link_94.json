The two, who have been dating since last year, recently bought a home together in Pennington’s home state of Colorado. Torres wrote posted a picture of Pennington down on one knee.\n\n“Our love began unexpectedly,” Torres wrote. “It started as a crush and grew into an amazing love. In this moment you made my dreams for us come true. Everyday you show me a love so true and pure. I am blessed to wake up to you every morning and fall asleep in your arms at night. I can't wait to become Mrs. Pennington.”\n\nPennington also posted a picture of the moment, ring in hand.\n\n“Couldn't be anymore complete,” Pennington wrote. “She said YES!!! And we had and amazing day with all our wonderful friends and family celebrating our new home.”\n\nTorres, 27, is a top contender in the UFC women’s strawweight division, most recently defeating Bec Rawlings in February by unanimous decision. “Tiny Tornado” also earned her Master’s degree in criminology from Florida Atlantic University last week."
