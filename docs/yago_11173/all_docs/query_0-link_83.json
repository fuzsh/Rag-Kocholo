        "text": "JON HALL\n\n5x7 youthful photograph of the actor shown gazing to the right\n\nPhotograph inscribed and signed: \"To Harry -/Best regards/Sincerely/Jon Hall\". B/w, 5x7. Athletic leading man Jon Hall (1913-1979), best known to television viewers as the star of Ramar of the Jungle (1952-1954), made his film debut under his birth name, Charles Locher, in Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935). The actor, who also appeared as Lloyd Crane in his early film career, adopted the name Jon Hall in 1937, when he starred as a persecuted native boy in John Ford's The Hurricane. During the 1940s, the actor co-starred with Maria Montez in a series of popular costume pictures at Universal, including Arabian Nights (1942), White Savage (1943) and Sudan (1945). After leaving acting to pursue a successful career as a manufacturer of photographic equipment, including underwater cameras that he rented to Hollywood producers, Hall returned to films as the star and director of The Beach Girls and the Mobster (1965). The actor, who was married four times (his second wife was singer Frances Langford and his third and fourth wife was actress Raquel Torres), committed suicide in 1979. Minor crease at upper right blank corner, slightly soiled at lower left margin. Fine condition.\n\nThis website image may contain our company watermark.
