Documents remain available at the regular listed price to all users until purchased. Therefore, we suggest that users check their emails frequently for our response as purchase of a document is subject to its availability. Under certain circumstances offers may be cancelled prior to the offer expiration date and users may not always be notified of an offer status change.\n\nEach hand-signed document has been authenticated and is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity issued by our parent company Gallery of History Inc. The term of the COA is 10 years from the date of purchase and is valid to the original purchaser only. We have an outstanding reputation for the thoroughness of our research, for our business integrity and for our service to our clients. We financially stand behind our COA which is one of the main reasons we've been able to stay in business for so long (since 1981)!\n\nWithin the 10 year COA period, each hand-signed item is guaranteed to pass PSA/DNA or JSA authentication or we will refund your full purchase price."
