        "text": "Raquel Pennington is about to go into what could be the biggest fight of the year for her. And by her side, in her corner, will be none other than her partner, Tecia Torres. Pennington may as well be the next women’s bantamweight champion and her partner, the UFC strawweight star, is just as impressive. The pair are truly an MMA power couple in their own right. But who is Torres and where does she hail from?\n\nTecia Torres started getting into the world of martial arts at the surprisingly young age of three. Since then, she’s made a name for herself by mastering several forms of martial arts such as Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, and more. Here’s more about her.\n\nWhere does Tecia Torres come from?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWhile Raquel Pennington hails from Colorado, Tecia Torres was born in Fall River, Massachusetts. However, she and her family would later go on to move to Coral Springs, Florida.\n\nThis was at the age of five when Torres moved cities with a brother, a sister, and her single mother. Her journey in mixed martial arts started early and after training in taekwondo for 12 years, she finally received her black belt. Apart from that, her amateur Muay Thai record stands at 16-4.\n\nAt the age of 20, Torres graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice as well as Sociology. She would then go to the same university to achieve her master’s in Criminology in 2017. About seven years after her initial graduation.\n\nIn terms of her ethnicity, she is Puerto Rican, Portuguese, and Irish in descent, with her family’s roots in Maunabo, Puerto Rico. Once she started with her Mixed Martial Arts career, she would go on to win each of her seven fights, eventually being crowned 115 lbs championship titles at MMA Solutions, US Freedom Fighter Championship, and American Battle Championships. In December of 2013, she joined the UFC when the strawweight division was created.\n\nTorres and her relationship with Raquel Pennington\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRaquel Pennington and Tecia Torres tied the knot in 2017 and have been together ever since. Torres has been a great advocate of mental health and has been open about her own struggles with issues. In 2019, on World Mental Health Day, she spoke about her struggles with depression and attachment disorder.\n\nWatch This Story: WATCH: One of the Bloodiest UFC Fights Ever\n\nIn June last year, the pair welcomed their first child. They announced the birth of their daughter Baby Alayah Rose Pennington via a video montage posted on Instagram. Alayah was born on June 1, 2023, and the montage even contained images from the delivery room.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNow, her partner, Pennington will face off against Mayra Bueno Silva at UFC 297. The co-main event will decide who will claim the vacant women’s bantamweight title. The title itself was left vacant when the reigning champion, Amanda Nunes retired for good. ‘Rocky’ has put up a great performance winning most of her fights in the last couple of years. Will she be able to win this time around?"
