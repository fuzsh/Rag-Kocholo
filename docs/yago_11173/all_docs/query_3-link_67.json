        "text": "Student Research\n\nMajors culminate their course of study by writing a research thesis on a topic reflecting a particular area of expertise, developed in close consultation with faculty advisors. Specialists in making connections and drawing together different strands of the American experience, American studies majors have pursued careers in public service, politics, law, education, business, and media and journalism. For a list of recent research projects, see below.\n\nStudent Research Symposium\n\nStudents in American studies write a senior thesis on a topic of their own choosing. The thesis is the capstone of the major. Students do original research with primary sources and draw on American studies scholarship to develop their own insights and arguments. The range of topics is wide, reflecting the varieties of student interest.\n\nStudents write a prospectus in the fall semester and in the spring write their theses. As an aid to their scholarship, the department sponsors a senior symposium in February, where students present their research to an audience of faculty, friends and their peers. The feedback students receive gives them new questions to ask and scholarly discoveries to make.\n\nThe 2024 American Studies Senior Symposium will be held Wednesday, Feb 28, 4:30pm in Stern Great Room.\n\nAmerican Studies Research Projects Over the Years\n\nThe following list includes current and historic individual student research projects, public presentations from conferences, symposia and exhibitions and peer-reviewed publications. For abstracts on each project see Students as Scholars.\n\nStudents can get a list of their projects by going to CLIQ in the Gateway. Under the CLIQ menu, go to Profiles and then My ePortfolio. If you are an alum and would like a copy of your projects, please submit a research project request form.\n\n“Supported by” on Student Conference Presentation records indicates the entity or funding mechanism that supported the student’s participation in the conference, e.g., travel expenses, poster costs. For on-campus conferences, the supporting entity is usually the academic department sponsoring the event.\n\n“Supported by” on Student Research Project records indicates the entity or funding mechanism that supported the student’s research costs, e.g., supplies, materials, equipment, stipends or local or international research travel."
