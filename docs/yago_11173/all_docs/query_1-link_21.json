After serving as superior, he became novice master but was asked to be relieved of this post and return to his former position of cook. His holiness, reputation for miracles, and his fame as a confessor brought hordes of visitors to see the obscure and humble cook.

She was a member of the Daju people and her uncle was a tribal chief. Due to her family lineage, she grew up happy and relatively prosperous, saying that as a child, she did not know suffering. Historians believe that sometime in February 1877, Josephine was kidnapped by Arab slave traders. Although she was just a child, she was forced to walk barefoot over 600 miles to a slave market in El Obeid. She was bought and sold at least twice during the grueling journey. For the next 12 years she would be bought, sold, and given away over a dozen times. She spent so much time in captivity that she forgot her original name.\n\nShe was baptized on January 9, 1890, and took the name Josephine Margaret and Fortunata. (Fortunata is the Latin translation for her Arabic name, Bakhita). She also received the sacraments of her first Holy Communion and confirmation on the same day. These three sacraments are the sacraments of initiation into the Church and were always given together in the early Church. The Archbishop who gave her the sacraments was none other than Giusseppe Sarto, the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, who would later become Pope Pius X.\n\nIn 1958, the process of canonization began for Josephine under Pope John XXIII. On December 1, 1978, Pope John Paul II declared her venerable. Sadly, the news of her beatification in 1992 was censored in Sudan. But just nine months later, Pope John Paul II visited Sudan and honored her publicly. He canonized her on October 1, 2000.\n\nSt. Josephine Bakhita is the patron saint of Sudan and her feast day is celebrated on February 8.\n\nSt. Peter Claver\n\nSt. Peter Claver was born at Verdu, Catalonia, Spain, in 1580, of impoverished parents descended from ancient and distinguished families. He studied at the Jesuit college of Barcelona, entered the Jesuit novitiate at Tarragona in 1602, and took his final vows on August 8, 1604. While studying philosophy at Majorca, the young religious was influenced by St. Alphonsus Rodriguez to go to the Indies and save \"millions of perishing souls.\"\n\nIn 1610, he landed at Cartagena (modern Colombia), the principle slave market of the New World, where a thousand slaves were landed every month. After his ordination in 1616, he dedicated himself by special vow to the service of the Negro slaves—a work that was to last for 33 years. He labored unceasingly for the salvation of the African slaves and the abolition of the Negro slave trade, and the love he lavished on them was something that transcended the natural order.\n\nBoarding the slave ships as they entered the harbor, he would hurry to the revolting inferno of the hold, and offer whatever poor refreshments he could afford; he would care for the sick and dying, and instruct the slaves through Negro catechists before administering the Sacraments. Through his efforts, 300,000 souls entered the Church. Furthermore, he did not lose sight of his converts when they left the ships, but followed them to the plantations to which they were sent, encouraged them to live as Christians, and prevailed on their masters to treat them humanely. He died in 1654.\n\nSt. Katharine Drexel\n\nSt. Katharine Drexel is the second American-born saint to be canonized by the Catholic Church. This amazing woman was an heiress to a large bequest who became a religious sister and a brilliant educator. Katharine was born in Philadelphia, PA, on November 26, 1858, the second child of a prominent and wealthy banker, Francis Anthony Drexel, and his wife, Hannah Langstroth. Her mother passed away just five weeks after Katharine was born. Her father remarried to Emma Bouvier in 1860 and together they had another daughter in 1863, Louisa Drexel. The girls received a wonderful education from private tutors and traveled throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nThe Drexels were financially and spiritually well endowed. They were devout in the practice of their faith, setting an excellent example of true Christian living for their three daughters. They not only prayed, but practiced, what the Church calls the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Katharine grew up seeing her father pray for 30 minutes each evening. Every week, her stepmother opened their doors to house and care for the poor. The couple distributed food and clothing and provided rent assistance to those in need. The Drexels would seek out and visit women who were too afraid or proud to approach the home in order to care for their needs in Christian charity.\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi\n\nFounder of the Franciscan Order, born at Assisi in Umbria, in 1181.\n\nIn 1182, Pietro Bernardone returned from a trip to France to find out his wife had given birth to a son. Far from being excited or apologetic because he had been gone, Pietro was furious because she had his new son baptized Giovanni after John the Baptist.\n\nThe last thing Pietro wanted in his son was a man of God—he wanted a man of business, a cloth merchant like he was, and he especially wanted a son who would reflect his infatuation with France. So he renamed his son Francesco—which is the equivalent of calling him Frenchman.\n\nFrancis enjoyed a very rich, easy life growing up because of his father's wealth and the permissiveness of the times. From the beginning, everyone loved Francis. He was constantly happy, charming, and a born leader. If he was picky, people excused him. If he was ill, people took care of him. If he was so much of a dreamer he did poorly in school, no one minded. In many ways, he was too easy to like for his own good. No one tried to control or teach him.\n\nSt. Patrick\n\nSt. Patrick of Ireland is one of the world's most popular saints. He was born in Roman Britain and when he was approximately 14 years old, he was captured by Irish pirates during a raiding party and taken to Ireland as a slave to herd and tend sheep.\n\nAt the time, Ireland was a land of Druids and pagans, but Patrick turned to God and wrote his memoir, The Confession. In The Confession, he wrote: \"The love of God and his fear grew in me more and more, as did the faith, and my soul was rosed, so that, in a single day, I have said as many as a hundred prayers and in the night, nearly the same. I prayed in the woods and on the mountain, even before dawn. I felt no hurt from the snow or ice or rain.\"\n\nPatrick's captivity lasted until he was 20, when he escaped after having a dream from God in which he was told to leave Ireland by going to the coast. There he found some sailors who took him back to Britain and he was reunited with his family.\n\nSt. Kateri Tekakwitha\n\nSt. Kateri Tekakwitha is the first Native American to be recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. She was born in 1656 in the Mohawk village of Ossernenon. Her mother was an Algonquin who was captured by the Mohawks and who took a Mohawk chief for her husband.\n\nShe contracted smallpox as a four-year-old child, which scarred her skin. The scars were a source of humiliation in her youth. She was commonly seen wearing a blanket to hide her face. Worse, her entire family died during the outbreak. Kateri was subsequently raised by her uncle, who was the chief of a Mohawk clan. She was known as a skilled worker who was diligent and patient.\n\nHowever, she refused to marry. When her adoptive parents proposed a suitor to her, she refused to entertain the proposal. They punished her by giving her more work, but she did not acquiesce. Instead, she remained quiet and diligent. Eventually, they were forced to relent and accept that she had no interest in marriage.\n\nAt age 19, Kateri converted to Catholicism, taking a vow of chastity and pledging to marry only Jesus Christ. Her decision was very unpopular with her adoptive parents and their neighbors. Some of her neighbors started rumors of sorcery. To avoid persecution, she traveled to a Christian native community south of Montreal.\n\nSt. Martin de Porres Velázquez, O.P.\n\n(December 9, 1579–November 3, 1639) St. Martin de Porres Velázquez, O.P. was a lay brother of the Dominican Order who was beatified in 1837 by Pope Gregory XVI and canonized in 1962 by Pope John XXIII. He is the patron saint of mixed-race people, barbers, innkeepers, public health workers, and all those seeking racial harmony.\n\nHe was noted for work on behalf of the poor, establishing an orphanage and a children's hospital. He maintained an austere lifestyle, which included fasting and abstaining from meat. Among the many miracles attributed to him were those of levitation, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures, and an ability to communicate with animals.\n\nSukkot\n\nJewish festival of booths (or tabernacles) and the fall harvest; takes name from the booths used by Israelites during desert wanderings\n\nVaisakhi\n\nSikh New Year and spring harvest festival\n\nVesak\n\nThe most important of the Buddhist festivals celebrating the birth, enlightenment, and death of Buddha"
