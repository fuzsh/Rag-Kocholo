        "text": "Rachel Torres, 103, recent resident of Valley Stream, NY and previously living in Aventura, Florida, passed away on May 16, 2024 peacefully in her sleep.\n\nRachel was born on May 12, 1921 in Cataño, Puerto Rico, to Antonio Gonzalez and Adolfina Rodriguez Melendez. Rachel was the oldest of 14 brothers and sisters. She came with Papa and the family to the US as a young child. Helping Mama raise all those children during the depression turned her into one tough cookie.\n\nRachel graduated High School and together with 3 other friends decided to join the Army. The 3 friends backed out but Rachel defied Papa and joined the Army. Rachel served as a WAC in the Army from August 1943 to September 1945 during WWII. Rachel served in the Asiatic Pacific region in the Philippines and New Guinea. Rachel later went to secretarial school and worked at Pfizer Inc as a secretary for many years.\n\nAfter the Army, Rachel was coerced by some sisters into going to a dance where she met her husband of almost 70 years, John Torres. Rachel and John had 2 children, Michael and Valerie who were raised in Flushing, NY and were her pride and joy. In 1986, Rachel and John retired and spent their time living their best life in Aventura, Florida. Valerie went on to have 2 children of her own, Angelica and Andrew who were loved and adored by Rachel.\n\nRachel’s friendships encompassed all aspects of life, and each was special to her. From chats on the phone to family outings to sharing meals, to adventures near and far, Rachel cherished it all. She was especially close to her neighbors at Southviewwhere John and Rachel lived for many years.\n\nRachel is predeceased by her daughter, Valerie, her son-in-law Robert and her 2beloved grandchildren, Angelica and Andrew. She also leaves behind her sister, Doris and brothers Tony, Louis and William. Services will be held at Lieber Funeral Home in Valley Stream, NY, on Friday, May 24, 2024 from 4pm to 8pm."
