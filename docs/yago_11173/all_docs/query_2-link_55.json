        "text": "Raquel Torres O'Brien, hails from picturesque Burgos, Spain. She\n\nbrings a passion for service and astute business skills to the\n\nforefront assisting her clients in property transactions.\n\nRaquel holds both a degree in Advertising and Public Relations\n\n(Madrid) and an MBA (US). The twining of both experiences has\n\nled Raquel to unique perspectives linked to both Europe and The\n\nUnited States.\n\nHolding a great love of wine, Raquel has been very active in\n\nseveral segments of the wine industry. This stems from her\n\nfamilyâs ownership of a vineyard nestled in the heart of the\n\nrevered Ribera del Duero wine region. These experiences have\n\nlended themselves to reinforcing true standards of the real estate\n\nindustry.\n\nActing as sommelier and wine director at some of Washington,\n\nD.C.'s most prestigious restaurants (Fabio Trabocchi's Del Mar\n\nand Enrique Limardo's Imperfecto) has afforded Raquel great\n\nexperience in developing a keen ability to impart invaluable\n\ninsight and advice while listening to clientsâ needs. This is a\n\ncritical skill in real estate and something that Raquel excels at.\n\nAlso invaluable in the real estate industry are cultivated\n\nrelationships. In addition to her work as sommelier and director,\n\nRaquel launched her own wine consulting company and is a\n\nmember of Women of Wine, a non-profit organization dedicated to\n\nempowering women in the wine community. She has extensive\n\nexperience in forming connections and is adept at linking clients\n\nwith the right people. This makes her a valuable asset in the\n\ncompetitive real estate industry.\n\nBy merging her commitment to service excellence with her\n\nentrepreneurial acumen, Raquel superbly assists her clients in\n\nachieving their real estate aspirations.\n\nWhen she's not immersed in the world of real estate, Raquel\n\nresides in Washington, D.C., with her husband and one-year-old\n\ndaughter. In her leisure moments, she indulges in her love for\n\ntravel, frequently returning to Spain to visit her family while\n\nexploring the country's most exquisite wineries and vineyards."
