        "text": "Looking back at health.tech conference last week in Munich, I can only say thank you for the organizers and participants. What an enriching experience! It was my first time attending Health Tech and I truly enjoyed every moment. As I was sharing with some friends there, the energy of the attendees and the willingness to network and meet new people are clearly differential from other events I participated in. Thanks Aline Noizet for inviting me to participate in the panel about health ecosystems; I really enjoyed discussing with Ursula Costa, Bruno Calo and Robert Hite on how each of us see the impact and challenges of ecosystems from the perspective of the different angles involved: orchestrators, pharmas, tech leaders. ðŸ‘‰ A key take away I get with me: it is key every stakeholder is transparent about the goals they have to participate in the ecosystem and are aligned on the expectations in terms of gives and gets, including the trickiest part: data. And letâ€™s remember, not everything will be solved through ecosystems. Looking forward to come back to the next edition! #HT24 #ecosystems #healthcare #Healthanea\n\nLast week I enjoyed attending #reuterspharma event in Barcelona. It was a great moment to meet old colleagues and friends and get inspired with the interesting sessions and panels around innovation, partnerships and how digital health and data are transforming the pharma industry today. Some key ideas I take with me after the event: ðŸ‘‰ In a moment where sustainability of the healthcare systems is at risk, pharma is highly focused on playing a key role through partnerships and collaboration. ðŸ‘‰ We are living a new era of data-driven healthcare with crucial challenges to address: data silos in the ecosystem, the balance between innovation and security when using data, connectivity issues, the creation of ecosystems to generate RWD, the need to upskill healthcare workforce in the use of data. ðŸ‘‰ GenAI was one of the key topics of discussion. Lots of potential around it, but alignment to start the journey by learning and experimenting it, reducing risks and ensuring ethical uses. ðŸ‘‰ Interesting discussions on how to measure the ROI of innovation and the difficulties to measure short-term/tangible benefits. What stands out as relevant is for pharma to get the new capabilities that will be required to deliver beyond drugs, as it is expected by society from them. ðŸ‘‰ Concerns about the incentives, sometimes at risk, of innovation in Europe. Letâ€™s open dialogue and a transparent collaboration among all stakeholders to ensure healthcare innovation in Europe is protected while ensuring health equity. I am glad to reconfirm the role me and my colleagues at Healthanea could have in supporting healthcare ecosystems through the orchestration of pathways and the connection of data silos. Definitely, we are all protagonists of a key moment in healthcare, so letâ€™s work together and make history! ðŸ’ª\n\nToday I had the pleasure to participate in the plenary session of the #MedFIt23 event. We had a very interesting discussion trying to respond to the question \"MedTech, Digital Health and Seamless Care: are we yet there?\" Even if there is a clear response on the long journey ahead to reach seamless care, I was energized by all experiences shared. We all emphasize the importance of involving key stakeholders and working to align incentives when creating more seamless care pathways, as well as looking to generate value with pragmatic use cases to drive traction towards the future. Thanks to the rest of panellists Jussi MÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤ DorothÃ©e Moisy-Gouarin Thibault Pironneau Katarzyna Markiewicz-Barreaux and the moderator Lynn Coorevits for the great conversation. It was a pleasure to share our experiences at #Healthanea with all attendes."
