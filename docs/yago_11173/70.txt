Raquel Torres, a Mexican-born actress who appeared in such early sound films as ''White Shadows of the South Seas'' (1928) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933), died of a heart attack Monday in Los Angeles. She was 78 years old.

Miss Torres, whose original name was Wilhelmina von Osterman, was born in Hermosillo, Mexico, and grew up in Hollywood. She appeared in ''Under a Texas Moon,'' ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey,'' ''So This is Africa!'' and ''Red Wagon,'' among other movies. In 1931, Miss Torres brought a vaudeville act to the Loew's State Theater in New York; the following year she appeared briefly on Broadway in John McDermott's ''Adam Had Two Sons.'' In 1934, Miss Torres married Stephen Ames, a New York stockbroker.
