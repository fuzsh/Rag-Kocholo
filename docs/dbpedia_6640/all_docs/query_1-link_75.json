        "text": "Report on the Congo\n\nThe diamond smugglers' trail crosses the country, and nearly everybody is in the racket\n\nThe Case for Mad\n\nThrough a Dark, Glossily\n\nJAMES P. DEGNAN has taught at various American universities in recent years and is at present on the staff of the University of Jacksonville.

His triumphant tours of England and Scotland were followed by his trip to Israel and by his reading at the Inauguration, and then, at President Kennedy’s urging, he accepted the invitation to visit the Soviet Union. This is what took place, as recorded by F. D. REEVE, poet, critic, and professor of Russian literature at Wesleyan University,who served as Mr. Frost’s interpreter.\n\nThe Atlantic Report on the World Today: Washington\n\nTanganyika: African New Frontier\n\nIn 1964, Julius Nyerere. the son of the chief of an obscure Tanganyikan tribe, led his country to independence and became the first President of the new republic. MARTHA GELLHORN,who last winter journeyed to Africa to study this new nation, here tells us of the venture in self-government and self-help being successfully undertaken in Tanganyika.\n\nEuripides\n\nCome Lady Death\n\nBorn and brought up in the Bronx, PETER S. BEAGLE studied creative writing under Edwin L. Peterson at the University of Pittsburgh and then spent a year on the European continent. His first novel, A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE,was published by Viking in 1960, and he is now at work on another book of fiction.\n\nDedications\n\nThe Pope of the Dialogue\n\n“In all the exchanges of Pope John’s four-year pontificate,”says BARBARA WARD,“one can observe a common thread: to understand what lay behind men’s angers and suspicions, to find what united men and where a common interest could be discerned.”Here is Barbara Ward’s appraisal of the late Pope.\n\nLandward Pale\n\nThere is every evidence of an increasing interest in ATLANTIC poetry. As an incentive for writers yet unestablished, twice a year we set aside a number of pages in the ATLANTIC to be devoted to the work of young poets.\n\nUpon Realization of the Poet's Duty\n\nAn Early Fall\n\nForsaken\n\nThe Rand Corporation and Our Policy Makers\n\nSAUL FRIEDMAN,an investigative reporter and editorial writer for the Houston CHRONICLE, has been a newspaperman for eleven years.

The following report on the nation’s top “paramilitary academy\" grew aid of those studies.\n\nFall Defined\n\nAngler, author, and conservationist, RODERICK HAIGBROWNmakes his home on the Campbell River in Vancouver. He is best known for his book A RIVER NEVER SLEEPS; now he is at work on a new volume, FISHERMAN’S AUTUMN,whose opening pages the editor of the ATLANTICwas happy to capture while he and Mr. Haig-Brown were fishing for steelhead.\n\nRamses to Rembrandt to Wright\n\nSUSAN M. BLACKis a young writer who lives in New York and has contributed articles to various magazines. She is interested in the theater, fine arts, and travel. At present Miss Black is a staff writer for the NEW YORKER.

Shortly before his death in 1936, Mr. Dunne was persuaded by his son Philip to write down some leisurely reminiscences. The project was never finished, but of the chapters he did complete, which have now been incorporated in a volume of memoirs by his son, MR. DOOLEY REMEMBERS,we have selected excerpts which show the true temper of the man."
