Fort Mordecai Moore is identified in current park literature as the unnumbered redoubt just south of Redoubt #2. Stirling Redoubt is now identified as an unnumbered redan east of Inner Line Drive just north of Conway's Brigade. Fort George Washington is called Redoubt #3. The rifle pit is now identified as a redan on Mount Joy below the inner line earthworks and above Redoubt #3, it is not identified on park literature. According to Classified Structure Field Inventory reports done on these structures by John Bruce Dodd in 1979, Fort Mordecai Moore was incorrect in many details, Stirling Redoubt was located where a redoubt had perhaps never existed, and the rifle pit might not have been a rifle pit at all but another field work.\n\n26.

From the Credo of the Freedoms Foundation as is appeared on the cover of Atlantic Magazine, April 1949. In full, the articles were: \"Right to worship God in one's own way, Right to Free speech and press, Right to assemble, Right to petition for grievances, Right to privacy in our homes, Right to habeas corpusno excessive bail, Right to trial by juryinnocent till proved guilty, Right to move about freely at home and abroad, Right to own private property, Right to work in callings and localities of our choice, Right to bargain with our employers, Right to go into business, compete, make a profit, Right to bargain for goods and services in a free market, Right to contract about our affairs, Right to the service of government as a protector and referee, Right to freedom from 'arbitrary' government regulation and control.\" A current copy of the Credo shows that some wording has been changed since this appeared in 1949. The Credo now includes \"Right to peaceably assemble, Right to petition for redress of grievances, Right to trial by juryinnocent until proved guilty, Right to bargain with our employers and employees.\" The \"Right o free elections and personal secret ballot\" appears in the current version but not in this 1949 version.\n\n57. \"On the Cover,\" Atlantic Magazine, April 1949, inside cover.\n\n58.
