He had been a member of the Christian Union church twenty-five years and was a member of Capt. Stanley Post No. 79. A number of his comrades formerly in his company and regiment reside in this county, and they unite in qualifying him as a good soldier. The entire community will remember him as an agreeable neighbor and a upright citizen. The Post will miss his kindly counsel, and his children will mourn the loss of an affectionate father. His death was caused by a cancer of the neck and face. He had been confined to the house two or three months, where he suffered most severly from the ravages of that malignant desease.\n\nThe hearse left the home followed by old comrades and friends of the family, at 1:30 p.m. and arrived at teh Pine church at 2:30, where singing and brief discourse by his pastor, Rev.

Hall the mortal body of Comrade Cisco was consigned to Mother Earth. The Post was then dismissed by Commander J. B.

Derry for Fifty-six Years a Resident of Morgan Township, Dies After Lingering Illness\n\nJacob J. Derry, for over fifty years a continuous resident of Morgan Township, died of dropsy early last Saturday morning, after a lingering illness. Funeral services were held at the family residence two miles north of this city, conducted by Rev. C.A.B. Watson of the Mercer M.E.

Jacob John Derry was a son of Mr. & Mrs. Abraham Derry, and was born in Southeastern Indiana, March 7, 1826. He emigrated to Mercer County with his parents in 1849, and the father entered from the government the land on which the son resided until his death. The old home was destroyed by fire in 1897 and a new residence now marks the site. Mr. Derry was united in marriage in the county in 1859, taking as his bride Miss Sarah Brummett, daughter of the late Caswell Brummett. To this union were born ten children. Of this family the widow, five sons, Grant, John, Abraham R, Amos, and Agile; and four daughters, Louisa, wife of Charles Dykes; Mary, wife of Sherman Dykes; Charlotte, wife of Fred Price; and Sarah A, wife of W.T. Goodin; survive the husband and father. Mr. Derry was recognized as one of the countys most prominent farmers, and only a few weeks before his death he divided his splendid farm of 351 acres among his sons. He had been a member of the M.E. Church for over twenty years and had lived a life of great usefulness. He was a man of strict integrity and honor and his word was held sacred as his bond. He was honored and respected among his fellowmen, and not only his immediate family but the community has sustained a great loss by his death. The widow and children have the sympathy of all in their bereavement.\n\n________________________\n\nSource: Princeton Post, December 1, 1905\n\nJ.J.

Griffith was only 18 years of age he volunteered for military service to aid the United States in the Civil War and became a cavalryman in the company that was being formed in 1861 in Princeton, by Captain George Hamblin. This company became a part of the 7th regiment of Missouri State Militia and saw three years of active service in Southern Missouri, Eastern Kansas and Northern Arkansas fighting against the Confederate forces of General Price and General Shelby and Bill Anderson's \"Bushwackers.\" This enlistment of three years was followed by a second enlistment in General Handcock's Veteran Corps.

McClary Dies Very Suddenly at His Home in Princeton Last Thursday Afternoon\n\nThomas D. McClary, a highly respected citizen of this city, died very suddenly at his home on west Main Street last Thursday afternoon. He had spent the forenoon in raking the yard and cleaning out a cellar on the residence property south of the depot which he recently purchased and at noon complained he was ill and went into his bedroom to lie down. He refused to eat any dinner and a few minutes later called to his wife and told her he was dying. She ran to his side and lifted him up, then screamed for assistance, but he died in her arms before a physician arrived. The cause of his death was heart trouble. Funeral services were held at the M.E. Church, Sunday afternoon, the discourse being preached by Rev. L.W. Spayd, pastor of the Christian church. After the services the body was taken in charge by the I.O.O.F. of which Mr. McClary was an honored member, and the beautiful ritualistic ceremonies of that order was followed out at the cemetery, after which the body of the late brother was consigned to its last resting place. Thomas Dyghton McClary was born in Belmont County, Ohio, May 31, 1836, and was therefore in his seventieth year at the time of his death. Little is known of the life of the deceased up to June 16, 1861, at which time he enlisted in Co. E, 5th Regiment West Virginia Cavalry. For three full years he served his country faithfully during those never forgotten days from '61 to '65. He was discharged from the service on June 16, 1864, having in the meantime been a Confederate prisoner on Bell Island for over three months. Mr. McClary twice married. First to Phoebe McMahon on March 7, 1867. To this union were born two children  Mary B., who died in July 1875, and Sarah E., who still lives and is the wife of F.M. Burch of Pollock, Mo. The mother of these children died February 2, 1874. Mr. McClary's second matrimonial union was with Miranda J Essig, in 1875. To them were born Anna M. wife of Amos Derry, Thomas L. and Ord McClary, all of whom with the wife and mother, survive the father and are esteemed residents of Princeton and vicinity. Mr. McClary emigrated to Mercer county from the state of Ohio in 1869, settling within five miles of Princeton where he has continuously resided until a few years ago when he moved here. He had been for years an honored member of the Christian church and his last meeting with the membership was on the evening preceding his death. He was also a member of the I.O.O.F. and G.A.R. Mr. McClary was a kind, even tempered good man, a loyal citizen whose word was as good as his bond. The large congregation which assembled Sunday afternoon to do honor to his memory, attests the universal esteem with which he was regarded.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSubject: EULA ELIZABETH (POWELL) MILLER\n\nSubmitter: Curtis Clark (Cp41877@aol.com)\n\nSource: The Mirror, \"Reflecting Mercer County\", Mercer, Missouri, April 27, 1993\n\nEULA MILLER (Princeton) ...

After singing and prayer her remains were taken to the Lebanon church, where in the presence of a large concourse of people Rev. B.F. Morgan made a short but impressive talk from the following text found in Heb 11-16, \"But now they desire a better country, that is an heavenly,\" after which the congregation proceeded to the Collings cemetery where the body was interred. There were six children in the home family, and she was the last to cross the silent river of death. Grandman Prettyman leaves a family of six children, two sons and one daughter by her first marriage and three sons by her second marriage; two of her sons at present are ministers of the gospel, and survive to mourn her loss. While yet a small child she joined the Methodist Protestant church and until death lived the profession of her faith, which was best shown through life by her many deeds of kindness and the calmness of the way she endured the suffering of her recent illness of over thirteen months, being entirely helpless most of the time: the last three months, the sorest of all were spent at the place of her death. All was done for grandma during her afflictions that loving hands of children,friends and neighbors could do, yet the sickle of death saw fit to gather her spirit to the fold, to receive the crown of jewels bright as a reward of faithful duty. A boy's best friend is his mother. She often expressed a desire for the time to come when her afflictions should be stilled by the hand of Peace. She has passed the narrow path over the Great Gulf and visited a land from whence no traveler ever returned to bring us tidings of what is there, so if we want to see what is over there, let us follow the counsels that so many mothers have given us. \"Follow me.\"\n\nMero Middleton\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSubject:: CEDRIC ALLEN REAMES\n\nSubmitter: J.
