At the peak of Red Cross wartime activity in 1945, 7.5 million volunteers along with 39,000 paid staff served their nation. Throughout the war years, the Red Cross served 16 million military personnel, including one million combat casualties. By the time World War II ended in September 1945, the American public had contributed over $784 million in support to the American Red Cross. Nearly every family in America contained a member who had either served as a Red Cross volunteer, made contributions of money or blood, or was a recipient of Red Cross services.\n\nSource: https://www.abmc.gov/news-events/news/american-red-cross-volunteer-front-during-wwii-dorothy-j-burdge\n\nBLITZKRIEG – the lightning war – was the name given to the devastating German bombing attacks to which the United Kingdom was subjected from September 1940 until May 1941. In the meantime the Germans had been successfully marching through Europe, overpowering the Low Countries as well as France. Within this context, Britain was facing a threat of invasion, although seaborne attacks seemed unlikely as the German high command had assessed the difficulties of such an assault. Instead, Adolf Hitler had been preparing Operation Sea Lion as part of a dual attack by sea and air which was subsequently foiled by RAF Bomber Command. Germany instead turned to night-time bombing attacks in a tragic episode of history called the Blitz.\n\nThe lightning war began on what became known as “Black Saturday”, 7th September 1940 when the Luftwaffe launched its attack on London, which was to be the first of many. Around 350 German bombers executed their plan and dropped explosives on the city below, particularly targeting the East End of London. In just one night, London suffered approximately 450 fatalities and around 1,500 injured. From this moment onwards, the capital city would be forced to become shrouded in darkness as the German bombers launched a sustained attack for consecutive months.\n\nNearly 350 German bombers (escorted by over 600 fighters) dropped explosives on East London, targeting the docks in particular. The intention was to completely destabilise the economic backbone of London which included docks, factories, warehouses and railway lines, in a bid to destroy and weaken the infrastructure. The East End of London was now a main target for incoming Luftwaffe attacks, resulting in many children across the capital being evacuated to homes around the country in a bid to protect them from the dangers of the Blitz. Within weeks of the first bombing raid executed on London, the attacks turned to night time bombing raids, increasing the fear and unpredictability. This was not just a physical act of destruction but a deliberate psychological tool.\n\nThe Blitz as it became known in the British press was a sustained aerial attack, sending waves of bombs raining down onto British towns and cities. The attacks were carried out by the Luftwaffe and made up a larger campaign of attempting to destroy British infrastructure, cause devastation, destruction, and lower morale. Across the UK, towns and cities were subjected to the German bomber raids which, over the course of eight months resulted in 43,500 deaths of innocent civilians. The planned campaign emerged from the failures of the German Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain which played out in July 1940. The battle itself was a military campaign fought in the air whereby the Royal Air Force successfully defended the United Kingdom from Nazi air attacks.\n\nWhen the air raid sirens sounded, Londoners would often be forced to sleep in shelters, either in underground stations running throughout the city or Anderson shelters built at the bottom of gardens in case a public shelter could not be reached in time. Anderson shelters were able to provide a certain level of protection as they were made by digging a large hole and placing the shelter within it. Made out of corrugated iron, the defence was strong and provided nearby shelter as time was of the essence in many cases. As part of the wider programme of dealing with night time attacks, “blackouts” were subsequently enforced, leaving cities in darkness in an attempt to hinder the progress of the Luftwaffe in spotting their targets. Sadly, the bombs continued to rain down on cities around the UK.\n\nIn the eight-month period of bombardment, the docks would become the most heavily targeted area for civilians living in fear of attack. In total it is believed that around 25,000 bombs were dropped on the Docklands area, a statement of German intention to destroy commercial life and weaken civilian resolve. London would remain a primary target throughout this phase of the war, so much so, that on 10th to 11th May 1941 it was subjected to 711 tons of high explosives leading to approximately 1500 dead. Across the country however, a similar picture was beginning to unfold as the Blitz was an assault on the entire United Kingdom. There were very few areas left unaffected by the devastation wrecked upon towns and cities up and down the country. The ominous sound of the air raid siren became a sadly familiar sound as it echoed through the streets warning the public of incoming dangers.\n\nIn November 1940, an offensive began against cities around the country, provincial or otherwise and areas where industry was believed to be. The only lull in attacks came in June the following year when the attentions of the Luftwaffe were drawn to Russia and new targets emerged. In the peak of activity in November 1940, the Midlands city of Coventry was subjected to an horrific attack which resulted in huge loss of life and a complete destruction of infrastructure which would forever change the blueprint of the city. The medieval Coventry Cathedral was amongst the casualties on that fateful night on 14th November. The ruins of a once magnificent historic building were left behind as a poignant memory of the atrocities of war.\n\n“Winston Churchill visits the ruins of Coventry Cathedral”\n\nSource: by Jessica Bain, https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Blitz/\n\nDec 13, 1940: Death of Alvinette “Allie” (Andrew) Jagger (age 75), Marion, Wayne Co., New York, half-sister of George Stephen Reeves; heart ailment\n\nDec 1940: Burial of Alvinette “Allie” (Andrew) Jagger at Marion Cemetery in Marion, Wayne Co., New York\n\nNov 30, 1968: Death of George Stephen Reeves (age 94), husband of Vira Kellogg Allen and Alice Ethel Mills, in Sodus, Wayne Co., New York:\n\nNov 30, 1968: New York State Death Index:\n\nName: George S Reeves\n\nGender: Male\n\nAge: 94\n\nBirth Date: abt 1874\n\nResidence Place: Alton, Wayne, New York\n\nDeath Date: 30 Nov 1968\n\nDeath Place: New York\n\nCertificate Number: 90320\n\n1968: Burial of George Stephen Reeves, at Marion Cemetery in Marion, Wayne Co., New York:\n\nSep 7, 1976: Death of Dr. William Fisher “Bill” Clark (age 64), husband of Mary Dorothy “Dorothy” (Reeves) Clark, in Chattahoochee, Gadsden Co., Florida\n\nSep 9, 1976: The Batavia Daily News, Batavia, Genesee Co., New York:\n\nDr. W.F.
