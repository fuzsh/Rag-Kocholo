        "text": "Nothing can ever beat the fact that Christopher Reeve would always be remembered as the famous Superman icon. His role in the self-titled movie Superman (1978) was not his first, neither was it his last role as an actor. When he was nine, Christopher was casted in an operatta and that was where he caught the acting bug. Reeve was a talented all-round athlete but he gave up sports to pursue acting as his major career, he however did not stop sporting activities during his leisure. Â\n\nDate of Birth: September 25, 1952\n\nDate of Death: October 10, 2004 (aged 52)\n\nZodiac Sign: Libra\n\nOn May 27, 1995, the worst thing happened to the iconic Reeve â he was involved in a horse-riding accident. It remained his worst living day as everything in his life changed from that day forward. His spinal-cord injury could not be cured so he became near-totally paralysed and in need of constant care. He never got any better and even found himself constantly battling infections. One time, he was reacting to antibiotics and suffered a heart attack which eventually led into a coma. By the second cardiac arrest, Reeve was beyond recovery and passed on, leaving his family in 2004.\n\nOne thing that saw the renowned actor and paralysis campaigner through was his family, most especially his wife â she is by herself a superwoman! She however was not the only family he had; Chris had a famous father and a lot of siblings. Read on as we take you through the personal life of the late movie and real-life hero.\n\nSUBSCRIBE!"
