        "text": "Helen Schmidinger Reeve, PhD. died peacefully at home on December 11, 2021, in Bennington, Vt. She had great joy in connecting with dear friends and family, especially in conversation, over cocktails, or when listening to live musical performances. Words and ideas mattered a great deal - from great literature to the classroom, to the nuances of translation, to the integrity of personal communication. Born in 1927 in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia), to Friderik Schmidinger (architect) and Larisa Barsova Schmidinger, she grew up in Belgrade; she survived and escaped from internment during WWII, translated for UNRRA, and arrived in the US as a young bride of a US soldier and German scholar, Matthew Cohen. From her years in Chicago, she graduated Northwestern University (summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) and then moved to New York City to attend graduate school at the Russian Studies Institute, Columbia University. She was married 1956 - 1982 to the translator, novelist, and poet FD Reeve. Professor Reeve taught at Connecticut College, New London, for 32 years and was the Hanna Hafkesbrink Professor and chair of the Russian Department. Whether teaching Russian as an introductory language, or delving into the intricacies of poetic phrases, she demanded and inspired students to do their best. She is survived by her three children and one stepson and their spouses, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her nieces and their children and grandchildren. Her family thanks the loving care provided by AHSC home health and Bayada Hospice that helped her to live well at home. Memorial Contributions in honor of Helen may be made to The Palmer Library (Russian Studies) at Connecticut College, The American Civil Liberties Union, or The Southern Poverty Law Center. Contributions may be sent to the office of the E.P. Mahar and Son Funeral Home, 628 Main Street, Bennington, Vermont 05201. Guestbook Condolences may be made at www.maharandsonfuneralhome.net"
