        "text": "Running with the campaign slogan \"break barriers and build a future\" native Puebloan Lindsay Reeves is entering the fray for City Councilman Chris Nicoll's at-large seat in this November's election.\n\nReeves, 29, was born and raised in Pueblo and currently serves at the director of early childhood programs at Catholic Charities. She said she has spent the last 10 years advocating for citizens of the community through various roles in the nonprofit sector.\n\nReeves said she has been the recipient of numerous honors for her work, most notably the Hometown Hero Award in 2017 presented at the AMR Safety Jam, and the 2017 Pueblo Heroes Award from the Pueblo Human Relations Commission.\n\n\"Being born and raised in Pueblo has given me a really nice opportunity to see this community grow over time and establish,\" Reeves said on Friday in advance of a campaign announcement she held in the evening at the Robert Hoag Rawlings Public Library InfoZone Theater. \"It's also given me the passion to give back to this community. I've been involved in quite a few different things throughout the community and I feel like they've given me a unique perspective on the community and really where we stand currently. I really want to be able to capitalize on so many of the positive things going on in this community.\"\n\nAt 3 years old, Reeves said she was diagnosed with a form of muscular dystrophy. She said living in the city with a disability also gives her a different perspective.\n\n\"Obviously my disability doesn't define who I am as a person, nor does it define the work I've done in this community,\" Reeves said.\n\nThe main issues Reeves said the city needs to address are homelessness and the potential Black Hills Energy off-ramp.\n\n\"But I am running on a bigger platform that will include a large focus on working together, accessibility and transparency and quality improvement through strategic visioning,\" Reeves said.\n\nReeves joins 20-year-old Amado Vigil as candidates who have announced they are vying for the City Council at-large seat.\n\nrseverance@chieftain.com\n\nTwitter: @RyanS_Chieftain"
