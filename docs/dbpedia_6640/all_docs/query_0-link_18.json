        "text": "Geena Davis is an American actress, producer, activist, and former model known for her roles in film and television that have spanned over several decades. Born on January 21, 1956, in Wareham, Massachusetts, Davis developed a love for acting at a young age. She graduated with a degree in drama from Boston University in 1979, after which she moved to New York to pursue a career in modeling. Her breakthrough in acting came when she was cast in the film Tootsie (1982). Davis' performance in this film set the stage for a successful acting career. Davis' acting prowess has earned her several prestigious awards and nominations. In 1988, she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Accidental Tourist. Another notable performance was her portrayal of Thelma in the cult classic Thelma & Louise (1991), for which she got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Davis also starred in the groundbreaking film A League of Their Own (1992), which shed light on the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Apart from her acting career, Davis is known for her advocacy work for gender equality in media. She founded the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media in 2004 to address the underrepresentation and misrepresentation of female characters in children's media. Additionally, she is a skilled archer who nearly made it to the U.S. Olympic archery team in 1999.\n\nMark Lindquist (born 1949) is an American sculptor in wood, artist, author, and photographer. Lindquist is a major figure in the redirection and resurgence of woodturning in the United States beginning in the early 1970s. His communication of his ideas through teaching, writing, and exhibiting, has resulted in many of his pioneering aesthetics and techniques becoming common practice. In the exhibition catalog for a 1995 retrospective of Lindquist's works at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, his contributions to woodturning and wood sculpture are described as \"so profound and far-reaching that they have reconstituted the field\". He has often been credited with being the first turner to synthesize the disparate and diverse influences of the craft field with that of the fine arts world.\n\nTara Betts is the author of two full-length poetry collections Break the Habit, which was published in October 2016 with Trio House Press, and her debut collection Arc & Hue on the Willow Books imprint of Aquarius Press. In 2010, Essence Magazine named her as one of their \"40 Favorite Poets\".Betts was born in Kankakee, IL and is the oldest of three siblings. Her first job was at the Kankakee Public Library. Betts received her B.A. in Communication at Loyola University, Chicago. She received her M.F.A. in Creative Writing from New England College in 2007. Betts worked with several non-profit organizations in Chicago, IL including Gallery 37 and Young Chicago Authors. She received her Ph.D. in English/Creative Writing at Binghamton University in 2014."
