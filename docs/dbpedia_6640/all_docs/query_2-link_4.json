        "text": "Sometimes at night, Christopher Reeve said in an interview at his home in Bedford, N.Y., he dreams he is sailing aboard his yacht, ''Sea Angel.'' A gentle breeze fills the sails as he steers the boat along the reflection of the full moon. ''At night I am always whole,'' he said. ''I've never had a dream in which I am in a wheelchair.''\n\nIn his new book, ''Still Me,'' Mr. Reeve, Superman to millions of people, tells the story of his life on both sides of the riding accident that in 1995 essentially severed his head from his body, paralyzing him from the neck down.\n\nFor the first time, he reveals in the book that his injuries were so grave that his mother begged his doctors to withdraw life support. And he writes, also for the first time, that he himself considered ending his life but was dissuaded by the words of his wife, Dana Morosini: ''I will support you whatever you want to do, because this is your life, and your decision. But I want you to know that I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what.''\n\nThen, he wrote, ''She added the words that saved my life: 'You're still you. And I love you.' ''.\n\nLast week Mr. Reeve reflected on his life and his book, which was published this month, as he sat in a wheelchair in the office of his gray shingled house, which overlooks a broad sweep of green meadow, and a tranquil pond.\n\nAs Mr. Reeve, 45, spoke, the whooshing sound of the ventilator that forces room air into his lungs through a tracheotomy filled the room. He sat upright in a wheelchair, his head held immobile in a brace to protect it from spasms. He was speaking in full sentences, his voice quite clear, his handsome features still mobile, but his hands, and the rest of his 6-foot 4-inch frame, rested lifelessly in the wheelchair.\n\n''The thing that made me most angry was that I was never reckless,'' he said. Mr. Reeve has flown solo across the Atlantic twice, and he cited a dictum from an F.A.A. handbook: ''The outcome of any maneuver must never seriously be in doubt.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
