Audible fire alarm systems play a crucial role in this effort. Here's why they matter and why you should always acknowledge them: 1. Early Detection: Audible alarms provide quick warning, allowing for timely evacuation and saving lives. 2. Minimizing Damage: Immediate response can significantly reduce property loss and damage. 3. Clear Alerts: Audible alarms ensure everyone hears and understands the need to evacuate. Ignoring or turning off audible fire alarms can lead to: â€“ Delayed Evacuation: Risking lives and increasing injuries. â€“ Greater Property Damage: Delayed response can lead to more extensive damage. Important: Never turn off the alarms until the fire department arrives and gives the all-clear. Turning them off prematurely can cause confusion and put everyone at risk. Business owners, ensure your audible fire alarm systems are regularly inspected and maintained. Employees and customers, always respond immediately to alarms. For more information or assistance please reach out to us. Stay safe, Reeves County Emergency Services District 1 & 2 â€¦ See MoreSee Less\n\nPhoto\n\nPhotos from Town of Pecos City â€“ Government's post â€¦ See MoreSee Less\n\nWere You Born To Serve?\n\nIf So, Weâ€™re Hiring!\n\nFIREFIGHTERS & PARAMEDICS\n\nExcellent Equipment\n\nCompetitive Pay\n\nHealth & Retirement Benefits\n\nWould you or someone you know be interested in joining our team?
