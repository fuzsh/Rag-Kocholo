We’re dedicated to pushing boundaries and creating opportunities for our faculty, students, and alumni to envision the future — and make it happen.\n\nMost of our projects involve rethinking textile and apparel development and redefining consumer experiences. These efforts are leading to the generation of groundbreaking materials and unexpected ideas, and very likely to first-of-kind patents and products.\n\nSee for yourself: On campus, check out our interactive kiosk in the Feldman Center lobby and visit the Innovation website for research projects, programs, and activities.\n\nA recent DTech project included the reimagining of uniforms for Girl Scouts of America.\n\nRead more about the Girl Scouts project\n\nFIT DTech Lab\n\nAn extension of FIT’s Innovation Center, the DTech Lab is FIT’s on-campus innovation lab developed with the promise of revolutionizing both the creative and retail industries.
