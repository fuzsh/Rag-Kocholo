Mrs. Wild was removed to her home and Dr. J.A. Roberts who was called found a bad scalp wound, a broken arm and wrist. The woman is suffering from the shock and her condition causes anxiety. C.C.

It was the first drowning fatality of the year in Manitowoc. Firemen and policemen worked over the child with an inhalator for about an hour before he was finally pronounced dead by Coroner Theodore Teitgen. The coroner said there would be no inquest. Pvt. Wilda, who had just returned to Camp Wheeler, Ga., at the end of February after spending a 10 day furlough at home, has been notified by the American Red Cross of his sons death and he is expected to return home. Mrs. Wilda said today that she last noticed David playing with his tricycle between the houses at about 2:30 p.m. About 3 oclock, she said, he had disappeared and she started searching the neighborhood for him. Fell in With Big Rock She went past the gas plant and met William ODonnell, Manager of the company, and he aided her in the search for David. He said that he had seen David in front of the plant just a short while before, playing on his tricycle. They found the tricycle at the dock behind the plant but David was not in sight. Mrs. Wilda took the tricycle home with her when she was unable to locate her child and asked a neighbor boy if he knew where David was. He could give her no information. She learned later that David had been playing on the dock with this five year old boy and they had been throwing stones in the water. The little fellow said that David tried to pick up a stone that was too big and fell in the water. He showed little concern because he didnt fully realize what had actually happened to the child. Found Floating in Water Mr. ODonnell said that he asked the men working on the Soo line bridge if they had seen anything of the child but they could give no information. After Mrs. Wilda returned home with her tricycle, Mr. ODonnell and the foreman at the plant, Leo Kalin, both went over to the edge of the dock behind the plant and looked into the water. About 30 feet up the dock, Mr. ODonnell saw the body floating in the water, face up. He managed to slip down over the edge of the bank and retrieved the body. The inhalator squad was called and the youth wrapped in blanketsbut they worked to no avail. Mrs. Wilda was notified and watched tearfully as the firemen and policemen worked to try and revive her son. David was born in this city in 1941 and was baptized by the Rev. Henry Letz of St. Andrews church. He is survived by his parents; a sister, 15-month-old Carol Sue; maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Wendorf, 1005 Clark street; paternal grandfather, Adolph Wilda, 434 North 10th street.

Wilda lot] ******** CAPT. ODIN(sic) WILDA TELLS OF THRILLS ON BATTLE LINE Manitowoc Man in Service Since August 10th Experienced Much Excitement in Big Drives of War A tale thrilling in the excitement of adventures through which he has passed is told in letters recently received from Capt. Odin Wilda of this city, who is serving with the U.S. dental corps overseas. Capt. Wilda has been attached to troops in action on the battlefronts since Aug. 10 and previous to the signing of the armistice experienced many thrills of the war zone. Sailing from New York on June 28, via Halifax, where he witnessed the destruction caused by the explosion of an oil steamer there a short time previously, he sailed from Halifax on July 4 with an escort of seventeen boats, the largest troop convoy up to that time. The trip took the transport around the north pole and Capt. Wilda says that it was sure some cold. On July 15 off the Irish coast, Capt. Wildas transport ran into a nest of German submarines and two of the number were officially put out of commission. The boat landed at Liverpool the evening of July 16 and at 12 oclock Capt. Wilda entrained for South Hampton, where he remained but one day and then sailed on a cattle boat to France landing at Havre. Remaining at Havre for a week the contingent was loaded into box cars and sent to Ource where it remained a few days and then was sent to Minot to join the 350th regiment. On Aug. 10, Capt. Wilda left Minot and entrained for the St. Mihiel sector, reaching Fong from which place the command marched to Frenchville and later to the trenches where the command took part in the memorable drive in which the American forces obliterated the St. Mihiel salient. Capt. Wilda says he missed the first part of the show as on Aug. 29 he was detailed to Tangres where he remained until Sept. 16 and returned to his regiment on the 19th on which day he experienced his first baptism of shell fire while en route to the front lines, the Germans shelling the road all along the way. I didnt know what fear was at this time but now I have a wholesome respect for those big shells, said Capt. Wilda. The morning of Sept. 21 we put over a big raid and incidently chased Fritz back midst plenty of excitement. Capt. Wilda tells of the regiment being moved to Monta-ta-Coucon, which place was used by the crown prince as headquarters in his drive on Verdun and it was here that Capt. Wilda was lost for a time and in some manner became separated from his command for a night. On Sept. 26 following the drive in that sector by the Americans, Capt. Wildas command moved to the newly taken ground which became a pretty warm spot as result of the attacks of the Boche which he says tore up the buildings which the American artillery had left standing. We found a cellar back of a church which we used as our aid station. Each minute of the day Fritz took a brick out of the church until it was leveled and we were in line of his fire. We had good protection but in spite of all the German crushed the roof, knocking out one wall and let the ceiling of our place of business fall twice. Says Capt. Wilda. On Oct. 3 Capt. Wilda says his command went over the top the battalion leading all through the light. The aid station was stationed right back of the line where the troops were lighting just outside the town of Andevane. Things got pretty hot and each and every advance seemed to be made in a warmer atmosphere, according to the captain who wound up at Villers, where everything was quiet for a time. One of the interesting incidents told in Capt. Wildas letter relates how a German plane swooping over the field in which his command was operating, scattered the soldiers in all directions, each one seeking safety on his own hook. Capt. Wilda and companions, who were with him, covered considerable territory that night, reaching the American lines toward morning to learn that they had been traversing territory bordering the German lines. Recounting his experience at Launeville where his command arrived on the afternoon of Oct. 6, Capt. Wilda says that of all his experiences, this will be the best remembered. The course taken by the troops was over a road which for a half mile was directly under the German eye and when the Americans attempted to cross, the enemy opened fire, On this road while moving down the hill they had us running circles and one of the funniest incidents was when two of us tried to hide behind a sapling three inches thick. A shell which exploded covered us with mud but we covered the distance over the road in time that I bet was not far short of ten flat, says Capt. Wildas letter. Capt. Wilda was at Stanay where the Americans had driven the Germans to cover on the morning that the news of the signing of the armistice was received. He says that following a terrible battle, the night previous, the American forces had started an attack early on the morning of Nov. 11 when the news came to cease firing. The Yanks were inclined to question the order and were taking no chances keeping an eye on the enemy continually but were finally convinced that the news was official and then began to cheer and in one large chorus sang Over There. Speaking of the armistice and the closing of the war, Capt. Wilda said you may rest assured that all were happy but their sentiment was that of all the boys on the line: the armistice saved Germany, saved many lives and much work, but it robbed us of a chance to invade the enemy country and break up its peaceful homes as he had so ruthlessly broken up the homes of the French peasants; it robbed us of a chance to bring destruction to his militarism, of our chance to lay waste his land, driving his people into the open world as he had done by his terrorism. Glad its over? Yes, for the sake of humanity. As it is Germany knows only the cost in lives and not the privations of war such as the French have been forced to endure. Capt. Wildas letter is lengthy and a most interesting one.
