Van Morrison, Paul McCartney and Keith Richards are among the artists appearing in Bang! The Bert Berns Story, coming to a mobile device near you.

The acclaimed documentary about influential songwriter/producer Bert Berns will be released via Apple Music this fall, followed by a global offering via iTunes Movies.

Released theatrically in April and narrated by Steve Van Zandt, the film tells the story of Bert Berns’ amazing career. Berns wrote and/or produced hits for early R&B stars like Solomon Burke, Ben E. King, Wilson Pickett, LaVern Baker and The Drifters. Moving on to the British Invasion, The Beatles recorded his “Twist and Shout” and The Rolling Stones did “Cry to Me.”

Berns was also responsible for hits by Them featuring Van Morrison and Morrison’s first solo hit, “Brown Eyed Girl.” Berns’ BANG Records label, formed in 1965, was also home to artists like the McCoys of “Hang on Sloopy” fame and the Strangeloves who had a hit with “I Want Candy.” His composition “Piece of My Heart” was later recorded by Janis Joplin as a member of Big Brother and the Holding Company.

Berns, who died of heart failure in December 1967 at age 38, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

Berns’ son, Brett, who directed the documentary, says, “This film was a journey of discovery – a labor of love for my siblings and I that brought us closer to the father we never knew. We had inspiring screenings at over 35 festivals and knew we had something very special.”
