You might not know Bert Berns by name, but chances are you know his work.

The songwriter and producer wrote some of the biggest songs of the '60s such as "I Want Candy," "Cry to Me," "Twist and Shout" and "Hang on Sloopy." Berns also founded BANG Records, the company responsible for launching the careers of people like Van Morrison and Neil Diamond.

In 1967, at the peak of his career, Berns died of a heart attack. He was just 38 years old.

After his death, his songs got covered by Janis Joplin, Dusty Springfield, Jerry Garcia and others, but his son, Brett Berns, says his father never got the credit he deserved. So now, 50 years later, he hopes his new documentary, BANG! The Bert Berns Story, will bring his father's contributions to a wider audience.

Today on the show, Brett discusses some of his father's biggest hits and why they matter. BANG! The Bert Berns Story is available on Amazon on May 5.

Below is a list of songs mentioned in the segment:

Solomon Burke, 'Cry to Me'

The Isley Brothers, 'Twist and Shout'

Garnett Mimms and the Enchanters, 'Cry Baby'

Van Morrison, 'Brown Eyed Girl'

Erma Franklin, 'Piece of my Heart'
