        "text": "By Russ:\n\nRegarded by some as one of the greatest songwriters of the second half of the twentieth century, Bert Berns was also one of the most unknown.\n\nYou will remember the tunes but maybe not their source. Bern’s notable songwriting credits include titles such as Twist and Shout, Piece of My Heart, Here Comes the Night, Hang on Sloopy, and Everybody Needs Somebody to Love. Beyond writing, his production prowess in the recording studio includes well-known classics such as Baby Please Don’t Go, Brown Eyed Girl and Under the Boardwalk.\n\nBerns seemed to be a modest man with an urgent mission, and a focused drive not unlike that of Bobby Darin – for good reason. With a damaged heart due childhood rheumatic fever, he was told he’d never live past the age of 21. Thus he yearned to make his short life worthwhile, whatever it took.\n\n51 hits in a half dozen years with songs that he either penned or produced; nobody else at that time had such success back then. It was just phenomenal.\n\nBut there are multiple reasons why Berns remains largely unknown. He was a behind-the-scenes kind of guy in the record-making process and so his name was not familiar to the public. He also wrote under two different names—Burt Russell and his own.\n\nHe wrote and produced at studios such as Capitol, MGM, United Artists, Roulette and Atlantic. By 1963, he unseated the legendary hit machine giants Lieber and Stoller to become Atlantic’s key staff producer.\n\nNeedless to say, with such success there would be a few feathers ruffled.\n\n[Thanks to Wikipedia and other Internet sources for the detail of this post – RS]\n\nBertrand Russell Berns\n\n(November 8, 1929 – December 30, 1967),\n\nalso known as Bert Russell and (occasionally) Russell Byrd\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in the Bronx, New York City, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Berns contracted rheumatic fever as a child, an illness that would mark the rest of his life, resulting in his early death. With a damaged heart he was told he’d never live past the age of 21, so he yearned to make his short life worthwhile, whatever it took.\n\nBerns found enjoyment in the New York City sounds of his African American and Latino neighbors he’d grown up with, and this influenced the music and rhythms of his impassioned trademark style. As a young man, he danced in mambo nightclubs, and he went to Havana before the Cuban Revolution.\n\nWhen he found his way into the New York music business, he did so with all of the gusto and desperation for success that he’d learned from his hard-working parents. He also brought along his mob connections and drew a lot of attention within the record industry in New York during his short, intense career.\n\nBerns liked hanging around the wiseguys. These men wielded the ultimate unfair business advantage, because implicit in all their dealings was the understanding that they would kill anyone who didn’t do what they wanted. He came to be friends with these people, and his music business associates were both intrigued and frightened by his new pals.\n\nBeginnings (1960–1963)\n\nShortly after his return from Cuba, Berns began a seven-year run from being an obscure songwriter in the legendary Brill Building\n\nBerns started out signing as a $50/week songwriter with music publisher Robert Mellin Music at 1650 Broadway in 1960. As an independent writer, he worked with several record labels.\n\nHe gained a reputation as a slick, fast-talking, go-getter with a soft spot for Bossa Nova and Afro-Cuban rhythms who truly understood soul music.\n\nHis first big hit record was “A Little Bit of Soap“, performed by the Jarmels on Laurie Records in 1961.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jarmels-a-little-bit-of-soap.mp3\n\n.\n\nOf the numerous towering achievements in Bert Berns’ career, perhaps none had greater impact than his contributions to the genre of soul music. He preferred to work almost exclusively with soulful African-American artists, and his first sessions with Solomon Burke in 1961 were the the very beginnings of the Uptown Soul revolution.\n\n1961 / Berns as “Bert Russell” wrote Solomon Burke‘s 1962 hit “Cry to Me” on Atlantic Records\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/solomon-burke-cry-to-me.mp3\n\n.\n\nAs a recording artist himself, Berns didn’t do that well. In 1961 under the name “Russell Byrd” he scored his only Billboard Hot 100 appearance with his own composition, “You’d Better Come Home“, peaking at Number 50.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bert-berns-you-bette-come-home.mp3\n\n.\n\nThat song would later be recorded by the Isley Brothers, and featured as the B-side of their 1962 single “Twistin’ With Linda“.\n\nNow, around this time, The Twist was becoming a real dance sensation and everyone wanted to cash in on the craze. Hence, “Twist And Shout” was written by Berns and Phil Medley.\n\nThe first version of this song was recorded in 1961 on Atlantic Records by a new rising Philadelphia R & B band, the Top Notes and it was produced by a young up and coming staffer by the name of Phil Spector.\n\n1961 / The Top Notes / “Twist And Shout” / written by Bert Berns and Phil Medley, later credited as “Bert Russell” / arranged by Teddy Randazzo with musicians including saxophonist King Curtis, guitarist John Pizzarelli, and drummer Panama Francis, with backing vocals by the Cookies.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/top-notes-twist-and-shout-1961-rare-original-version.mp3\n\n.\n\nWhen Berns got to hear the final mix, he told Spector that he had “messed up his song” and predicted a quick demise for the single. He arranged to have it redone by the Isley Brothers and produced it himself to spite Spector’s butchered version. (The Beatles were inspired by the Isley Brothers cover.)\n\nBerns opted to produce, and thus demonstrate to Spector what he had intended to be the “sound” of the record. The resulting recording captured the verve of an Isley Brothers performance, and became the trio’s first record to reach a Top 20 position in the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.\n\n1962 / the Isley Brothers / “Twist and Shout” on Wand Records / written by Berns and Phil Medley / produced by Berns\n\n.\n\nIt’s interesting to hear how the original Top Notes version differs from the Isley Brothers and then the famous Beatles version.\n\n1962 / Berns also hit the charts in late 1962 with the Exciters’ recording his song “Tell Him” on the United Artists label\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-exciters-tell-him.mp3\n\n.\n\n1963 / Garnet Mimms / “Cry Baby” / written by Bert Berns with Jerry Ragovoy /Berns, as an independent producer working with several record labels, made important records with\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/garnet-mimms-cry-baby.mp3\n\n.\n\nAtlantic Records (1963–1965)\n\nBerns’s early work with Solomon Burke brought him to the attention of Atlantic label chiefs Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegün. Early success would lead to deals with Atlantic Records, where Berns negotiated with Wexler and Ertegun to create Web IV, his own publishing company.\n\nStaff Producer\n\nIn 1963, as staff producer, Berns replaced Atlantic Records’ legendary house producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller at Atlantic.\n\nWhen Jerry Wexler fired Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (over an audit!), he brought Bert Berns in to work with the stable of artists who made up the house that Leiber and Stoller helped build.\n\nAmong the first tasks Wexler presented to Berns was to carry on the brilliant legacy of Leiber and Stoller’s work with Ben E. King.\n\nNow, Berns had no intention of recreating the style of his predecessors. Instead, he attempted to take Ben E. King in a more contemporary / soulful R&B direction, beginning with the stupendous “That’s When It Hurts.”\n\n1964 / Ben E. King / “That’s When It Hurts” / written by Bert Berns and Gerald Wexler\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ben-e-king-thats-when-it-hurts.mp3\n\n.\n\n1964 / Solomon Burke “Everybody Needs Somebody to Love” / written by Bert Berns, Solomon Burke and Jerry Wexler\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/solomon-burke-everybody-needs-somebody-to-love.mp3\n\n.\n\n1964 / the Drifters “Under the Boardwalk” / written by Kenny Young and Arthur Resnick\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/drifters-under-the-boardwalk.mp3\n\n.\n\n1965 / Barbara Lewis “Baby I’m Yours” / written by Van McCoy\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/barbara-lewis-baby-im-yours.mp3\n\n.\n\nWorking further with Ben E. King, Berns recorded his rollicking “Let The Water Run Down” and his soulful “It’s All Over” and “Cry No More.”\n\n1965 / Ben E. King / “Let The Water Run Down” / written by Bert Berns and Gerald Wexler\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ben-e-king-let-the-water-run-down.mp3\n\n.\n\n1965 / Ben E. King / Cry No More / written by Berns and Ragavoy\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ben-e-king-cry-no-more.mp3\n\n.\n\n1965 / Wilson Pickett / “Don’t Fight It” / written by Pickett co-wrote with Eddie Floyd or Steve Cropper\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wilson-pickett-dont-fight-it.mp3\n\n.\n\n1965 / LaVern Baker /”Fly Me To The Moon” / “Ain’t Gonna Cry No More” / Bert Berns production\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fly-me-to-the-moon-lavern-baker.mp3 https://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lavern-baker-aint-gonna-cry-no-more.mp3\n\n.\n\nBen E. King once said “You don’t just sing Bert Berns’ songs, you have to feel them.” And the extraordinary feeling vested in the records he made with Berns is deeply embedded in the grooves of the Atco tracks these two giants made for Atlantic Records between 1963 and 1965.\n\nBut as Bert would later create his own BANG and Shout record labels in 1965, his collaboration with Ben came to a sudden end. “After Bert was gone, it was all over for a lot of us,”\n\nThough none of the dozen plus sides proved to hit commercially like Ben E. King’s earlier recordings with Leiber and Stoller, King expressed great affection for Berns and their work together. “Bert’s music had more guts,” he said. “The writing Bert Berns made back then was perfect.”\n\nBritish Invasion (1964–1965)\n\nBerns went to England three times between 1964 and 1965, where he produced a number of British Decca songs. With many of Berns’s songs being recorded by British Invasion bands such as the Beatles (“Twist and Shout“), the Rolling Stones (“Cry to Me“) and the Animals (“Baby Let Me Take You Home“), Berns became the first American record producer to travel across the Atlantic to work in London.\n\n1964 / The Animals / “Baby Let Me Take You Home” / written by Bert Russell (a.k.a. Bert Berns) and Wes Farrell\n\n.\n\nOn his first trip to the UK, he became enamoured with the taut sound of Belfast’s Them – specifically, the band’s abrasive frontman, Van Morrison.\n\nThis would be one of the first studio productions Berns did with Morrison.\n\n1964 / Them – Baby Please Don’t Go / Song originally written by Delta bluesman Big Joe Williams & recorded in 1935.\n\n.\n\nBANG Records (1965–1967)\n\nBerns formed his own record label, BANG Records, in 1965. BANG was founded with his Atlantic Records partners, with the label’s name derived from the initials of each of their respective personal names—in order, Bert Berns, Ahmet Ertegün, Nesuhi Ertegün, and Gerald (Jerry) Wexler. BANG became home to many great artists.\n\n“Hang On Sloopy” is a 1964 song written by Bert Berns and Wes Farrell, originally titled “My Girl Sloopy“.\n\nAccording to Rick Derringer, guitarist and founding member of the McCoys, the original version of Sloopy was written by a “high school kid in St. Louis” and sold to Berns. The inspiration for the song is said to be Dorothy Sloop, a jazz singer from Steubenville and a student at Ohio State University.\n\nThe original version of this song was recorded and made a hit by R&B vocal group, the Vibrations. You can hear Bert’s Carribean influence in the style of this recording.\n\n1964 / the Vibrations / “My Girl Sloopy” / written by Bert Berns and Wes Farrell\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-vibrations-my-girl-sloopy.mp3\n\n.\n\nWhen the rock band the McCoys covered “Hang On Sloopy” in 1965, the song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hang-on-sloopy-the-mccoys-stereo.mp3\n\n.\n\nAs an aside…\n\nIn 1965 the Toronto group Little Caesar and The Consuls released a recording of “Hang On Sloopy“. It became a Canadian hit, reaching number 50 on the Billboard pop chart. In 2019 the band re-recorded Sloopy along with some new retro-sounding originals on an album called “The Music Of My World“.\n\n2019 / Little Caesar and the Consuls (Since 1956) / “Hang On Sloopy”\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-hang-on-sloopy.mp3\n\nMore BANG recordings:\n\nThe Strangeloves “I Want Candy” / written by Bert Berns, Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein and Richard Gottehrer\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/strangeloves-i-want-candy.mp3\n\n.\n\n1965 / Van Morrison and Them / “Here Comes The Night” / written by Bert Berns\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/van-morrison-w-them-here-comes-the-night.mp3\n\n.\n\nWhen Them disbanded in 1966 following a crash-and-burn residency at LA’s Whisky a Go Go, Van Morrison retreated to Belfast, Ireland.\n\nNow, Berns, with an ear pinned to The Beatles’ Rubber Soul and Revolver records, and an eye on the mainstream market, pursued his prey.\n\nHe signed Morrison to his BANG label, lodged the princely sum of $2,500 into a bank account and flew the singer over to New York in the spring of 1967.\n\nIn New York they recorded his first solo sessions with the finest studio musicians in the city – arranger Garry Sherman, engineer Brooks Arthur, guitarists Eric Gale and Hugh McCracken, drummer Gary Chester, pianist Paul Griffin and background vocals by Cissy Houston and her girls.\n\nThe two-day recording session at A&R Studios yielded eight songs, including “Brown Eyed Girl.” Originally titled “Brown Skinned Girl,” the song was captured on the 22nd take of the first day and would become one of the most popular songs of the twentieth century.\n\nVan Morrison “Brown Eyed Girl”\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/van-morrison-brown-eyed-girl.mp3\n\n.\n\nWithout Van’s knowledge or input, Berns assembled the singles from those sessions into the album “Blowin’ Your Mind” – a move which later infuriated Morrison. This was of course a precursor to Morrison’s masterpiece “Astral Weeks” LP.\n\nThe “Blowin’ In The Wind” album included the 10-minute “T.B. Sheets” written by Van Morrison – clear evidence that Berns saw Morrison as a truly visionary artist.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/van-morrison-tb-sheets.mp3\n\nThere is a long-standing, story of Morrison’s emotional state during the song’s recording. Michael Ochs, in the liner notes for the 1973 album T.B. Sheets, wrote that “after ‘T.B. Sheets’ was recorded, the rest of the session had to be cancelled because Van broke down in tears.”\n\nThe story as told in the song takes place in a room where a young girl lies dying of tuberculosis and is visited by the story-teller. The overwhelming pain and guilt he feels leads to a desperate feeling of wanting to escape from the enclosed room smelling of death and disease.\n\n.\n\nThe album also included Berns’ “Goodbye Baby (Baby Goodbye),” recorded years earlier with Solomon Burke\n\nMuch has been written about the creative genius and creative conflict shared by Bert Berns and Van Morrison. But the two worked together to the end of Berns’ life, and his role in Van’s historic career is indisputable.\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nIn 1966, Diamond signed a deal with BANG Records, then a subsidiary of Atlantic. His first release on that label was “Solitary Man” which was his first true hit as a solo artist.\n\n1966 / Neil Diamond / “Solitary Man” / written by Neil Diamond / Produced by Bert Bern\n\n.\n\nDiamond began to feel restricted by BANG because he wanted to record more ambitious, introspective music. Berns wanted to release “Kentucky Woman” as a single, but Diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs, so he proposed “Shilo“. BANG believed that the song was not commercial enough, so it was relegated to being an LP track on “Just for You“.\n\nDiamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to WEB IV, but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success. A magistrate refused WEB IV’s request for a temporary injunction to prevent Diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court, but the lawsuits persisted until February 18, 1977, when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his BANG-era master tapes.\n\nNeedless to say, Diamond was no longer a fan of BANG.\n\nShout Records (1966–1967)\n\nIt’s an understatement to say that Bern’s greatest passion was R&B and Soul music and he was regarded affectionately by many black artists as the “White Soul Brother”.\n\nWith BANG Records releasing predominantly rock and roll, he formed Shout Records in 1966 as an outlet this passion.\n\nBert Berns became a founding father of the New York Uptown Soul genre, with rhythm and blues and soul music making up the vast majority of his body of work. A number of artists ranging from Jimmy Radcliffe to The Exciters released records on Shout.\n\n1967 / Freddie Scott – “Are You Lonely for Me Baby” / written and produced by Bert Berns / back up vocals were performed by Cissy Houston and the Sweet Inspirations.\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/are-you-lonely-for-me-baby.mp3\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1967 / Erma Franklin – “Piece Of My Heart” / written by Jerry Ragovoy and Bert Berns\n\nhttps://strathdee.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/emma-franklin-piece-of-my-heart.mp3\n\nIn 1968 this song came to greater mainstream attention when Big Brother and the Holding Company (featuring Janis Joplin on lead vocals) covered the song and had a much bigger hit with it.
