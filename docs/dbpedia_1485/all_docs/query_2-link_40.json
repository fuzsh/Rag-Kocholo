        "text": "Episode Notes\n\nBert Berns and Nat Weiss are two giants of the music industry, yet both relatively unknown to the public. Bert Berns was one of the foremost songwriters and producers of pop and rhythm and blues in the ‘60s. His hits include “Twist And Shout”, which The Beatles took to international fame, “Piece Of My Heart”, Janis Joplin’s gigantic hit, “Hang On Sloopy”, the mega-hit for The McCoys, “Cry To Me”, a hit for Solomon Burke and later for The Rolling Stones, and “Tell Him”, a great early ‘60s song for the Exciters. His producer credits include “Brown Eyed Girl”, Van Morrison’s first smash hit, \"Under The Boardwalk\" by The Drifters, and \"Cherry Cherry\" by Neil Diamond.\n\nNat Weiss was a lawyer by training. He became the U.S. business partner of Brian Epstein, the manager of The Beatles, and was Brian’s right hand man for the band in America, including sorting out all the merchandising opportunities coming their way. Nat parlayed this relationship into one where he would suggest artists for Brian to manage, including The Cyrkle. They formed a management company together and, after Brian’s death, Nat continued the business, managing artists like James Taylor.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Follow Your Dream Podcast:\n\nTop 1% of all podcasts with Listeners in 200 countries!\n\nFor more information and other episodes of the podcast click here.\n\nTo subscribe to the podcast click here.\n\nTo subscribe to our weekly Follow Your Dream Podcast email clickhere.\n\nTo Rate and Review the podcast click here.\n\n“Dream With Robert”.
