        "text": "Bert Berns had an influence on popular music of the day, that has been said to be tremendous.\n\nWorked at musical gaints the Brill Building & Atlantic Records; as well as being a co-founder of Bang Records & Shout Records.\n\nWriting many classic tunes; as well as producing sounds that influence music today.\n\n'The Man Behind 51 Hits':\n\nBert Berns: the man behind 51 pop hits\n\nWiki:\n\nBert Berns - Wikipedia\n\n\"Bang Bert Berns Story\" documentary:\n\nWelcome\n\nThis song of his, 1st done w/Lulu, really won me over as a kid:\n\nwhat a hook & 'Blue Eyed Soul' too!!\n\nGone; yet not forgotten.\n\nPost your fave Bert Berns songs & favorite renditions!\n\nI have a folder with Bert Berns Songs on my Cowon music player (without songs which I have on cd like Them and from the Atlantic R&B box set):\n\nAustin Taylor - Push Push\n\nBen E. King - That's When It Hurts\n\nBen E. King - It's All Over\n\nBetty Harris - Cry Baby\n\nDrifters - One Way Love\n\nDrifters - I Don't Want To Go On Without You\n\nErma Franklin - Piece Of My Heart\n\nErma Franklin - Open Up Your Soul\n\nExciters - Tell Him\n\nExciters - Get Him\n\nFreddie Scott - Are You Lonely For Me Baby\n\nFreddie Scott - Cry To Me\n\nFreddie Scott - Am I Grooving You\n\nGarnet Mimms - Cry Baby\n\nGarnet Mimms - Look Away\n\nGarnet Mimms - I'll Take Good Care Of You\n\nGarnet Mimms - It Was Easier To Hurt Her\n\nIsley Brothers - Twist And Shout\n\nJohnny Thunder - Everybody Do The Sloopy\n\nJohnny Thunder - More, More, More, Love, Love, Love\n\nJohnny Thunder - Send Her To Me\n\nLorraine Ellison - Heart Be Still\n\nLulu - Here Comes The Night\n\nLulu - I'll Come Running Over\n\nMcCoys - Hang On Sloopy\n\nMcCoys - I Got To Go Back (And Watch That Little Girl Dance)\n\nRocky Fellers - Killer Joe\n\nSolomon Burke - Cry To Me\n\nSolomon Burke - Down In The Valley\n\nSolomon Burke - Goodbye Baby (Baby Goodbye)\n\nSolomon Burke - Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\n\nSolomon Burke - Yes I Do\n\nSolomon Burke - Baby, Come On Home\n\nVibrations - My Girl Sloopy\n\nWilson Pickett - Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\n\nI'm a little late to the party, but are your Bert Berns tracks in mono? It's hard to find those blistering Freddie Scott tunes and excellent Solomon Burke material from that era in mono. The stereo versions really lack the \"oomph\" of the mono originals.\n\nFreddie Scott's \"Are You Lonely For Me\" is in mono on the Beg, Scream & Shot box from Rhino (Out of print, but not hard to find), alongside mono versions of Garnet Mimms' \"Cry to Me\" and Erma Franklin's \"Piece of My Heart\".\n\nYou can find mono Solomon Burke on the 1998 Rhino compilation \"The Very Best of Solomon Burke\". I believe that five of the tracks are Bert Berns collaborations.\n\nYou can also find The Exciters second long player in mono (their one and only for Roulette) on a S/T Warner Japan CD from 2014 [WPCR-27796], which has three Berns tracks. Their Bang recordings are on an Ace CD called \"Soul Motion\".\n\nBerns' four Lulu collaborations are in mono on her 2009 comp, \"Shout! The Complete Decca Recordings\" from Cherry Red/RPM.\n\nHere's Jill Jackson, of Paul & Paula fame, doing a take on the arrangement Berns & Co. gave to Lulu.\n\nThanks. From the album \"The Very Best of Solomon Burke\" I have made a download of 4 mono songs. Unfortunately I have not found the possibility of downloads from \"Beg, Scream & Shot\" and \"Shout! The Complete Decca Recordings\".\n\nI have now bought some mono versions of my Bert Berns songs. The list of the stereo versions is now very low:\n\nExciters - Tell Him\n\nExciters - Get Him\n\nFreddie Scott - Are You Lonely For Me Baby\n\nFreddie Scott - Cry To Me\n\nFreddie Scott - Am I Grooving You\n\nGarnet Mimms - Cry Baby\n\nGarnet Mimms - Look Away\n\nGarnet Mimms - I'll Take Good Care Of You\n\nGarnet Mimms - It Was Easier To Hurt Her\n\nMcCoys - I Got To Go Back (And Watch That Little Girl Dance)\n\nIt is a pity that the Exciters songs are not available in mono. The Beg, Scream & Shot box is too expensive for two mono songs because I have already Erma Franklin's \"Piece of My Heart\" in mono.\n\nI have now three versions of \"Hang On Sloopy\" from The McCoys: single mono version with running time 3:00, extended stereo version with running time 3:51, and extended mono version with running time 3:53 from the Rhino cd \"Grandson Of Frat Rock\"."
