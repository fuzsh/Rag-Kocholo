        "text": "Here's the second of two albums in my \"Covered\" series, focusing on the songwriting of Bert Berns and/or Jerry Ragovoy. As with the first, you probably don't know who these people are, but trust me, they were very talented songwriters, and these albums are full of great music.\n\nI said most everything I needed to say with the first volume. Note that Berns died at the end of 1967. As a result, more of the songs in this album were written by Ragovoy. But there still are some Berns songs, especially in the 1967 to 1968 time frame. For instance, \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" was a hit for Solomon Burke in 1963. But I chose a 1967 by Wilson Pickett, because it's a faster version that most later artists imitated, such as the version by the Blues Brothers in 1980.\n\nGenerally speaking, I have a rule not to include more than one version of the same song. For instance, the Strangeloves had a hit with Berns' song \"I Want Candy\" in 1965, and then Bow Wow Wow had a hit with that song in 1982, but I forced myself to pick one. However, I included one song here that I also included in the first volume: \"As Long as I Have You.\" The original version was a minor hit by Garnet Mimms in 1964. Then Led Zeppelin played the song in concert in 1969. Their version was vastly different, and part of a much longer medley. I included that still-unreleased medley version on a Led Zeppelin stray tracks album I've posted here already:\n\nhttps://albumsthatshouldexist.blogspot.com/2018/09/led-zeppelin-born-in-darkness-various.html\n\nFor the version I included here, I edited it to remove the other songs in the medley, so it's purely a version of \"As Long as I Have You.\" I think it's an excellent version that's totally Led Zeppelin and very different from the Mimms version. I have no idea why it remains officially unreleased.\n\n\"Twenty-Five Miles\" seems like the odd one out on this album, because that was a big hit for Motown artist Edwin Starr, and Motown almost always had hits with their own songwriters. It turns out neither Berns nor Ragovoy ever wrote for Motown. However, Berns and Ragovoy wrote a relatively obscure tune called \"32 Miles Out of Waycross,\" and \"Twenty-Five Miles\" was so similar to that song that Berns and Ragovoy were added to the composer credits.\n\nRagovoy lived until 2011. However, musical trends changed, and the pop-soul style that both Berns and Ragovoy excelled in lost favor in the early 1970s. Like Berns, Ragovoy was also a successful producer. He continued to produce a fair amount after 1971, but he rarely had a prominently placed new song after that year.\n\nThis album is 49 minutes long.\n\n01 Everybody Needs Somebody to Love (Wilson Pickett)\n\n02 Am I Grooving You (Freddie Scott)\n\n03 What's It Gonna Be (Dusty Springfield)\n\n04 Pata Pata (Miriam Makeba)\n\n05 Goodbye Baby [Baby Goodbye] (Van Morrison)\n\n06 Baby Come On Home (Led Zeppelin)\n\n07 Piece of My Heart (Janis Joplin)\n\n08 Twenty-Five Miles (Edwin Starr)\n\n09 Try [Just a Little Bit Harder] (Janis Joplin)\n\n10 As Long as I Have You (Led Zeppelin)\n\n11 Stop (Jimi Hendrix)\n\n12 Down in the Alley (Ronnie Hawkins)\n\n13 Cry Baby (Janis Joplin)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15259437/CoveredBernsRagvy_1967-1971_Volum2_atse.zip.html\n\nDang it, I did it again. I must confess that I had such trouble finding any photos of Berns and Ragovoy together that for the first volume in this series, I found a photo of Berns and added Ragovoy's head into it. I did the exact same thing this time. Berns is the one playing the guitar. I believe the other guy in the original photo was producer Jerry Wexler. However, I replaced Wexler's head with Ragovoy's head from another photo. I hope it doesn't look like an abomination. I also hope I won't have to resort to this again. Unfortunately, it's a sign of how underappreciated both Berns and Ragovoy are, that so few photos of them can be found on-line.\n\nIf you thought I was done with my \"Covered\" series, don't worry. I'm just getting warmed up! This time, I'm taking a look at two people you may not have ever heard of: Bert Berns and Jerry Ragovoy. But they were just as good as other major songwriters who are a lot more famous. Together or separately, they wrote many all-time classic songs, as you'll see below.\n\nAs usual with this series, I don't want to write up an entire essay about the songwriters. Instead, I'll direct you to their Wikipedia pages to learn more:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Berns\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Ragovoy\n\nBut what I do feel the need to write about is who did what. Some songs here, such as the classics \"Cry to Me\" and \"Piece of My Heart\" were written by Berns and Rogovoy together, but most were written apart, or with others. Still, I felt the two of them belong together in this compilation because they had such similar musical styles. Most notably, both were white, Jewish guys who were fascinated by soul music.\n\nOf the songs they wrote alone, I would guess that there is a fairly even split here between Berns songs and Ragovoy songs. But Berns is much more famous than Ragovoy. Perhaps that's because he died very young, in 1967, due to persistent health issues, when he was only 38 years old. So he makes for a tragic figure like others who died young. Thus, there have been some documentaries about him, such as \"Bang! The Bert Berns Story,\" but none about Ragovoy. But also, Berns was a much more charismatic figure, an extrovert, while Ragovoy was very low profile. In fact, I had a hard time finding any good photos of a young Ragovoy at all.\n\nRegarding song selection, I could have included many more songs, since both of them were prolific2. But I've limited this to just the hits, as well as non-hits that I think are especially good. I tried to stick to the original hit versions whenever possible, though I've used non-hit versions in a few cases.\n\nI've made two albums of Berns and/or Ragovoy songs. I'll post the second volume immediately after this one. Each one is between 45 and 50 minutes long.\n\n01 A Little Bit of Soap (Jarmels)\n\n02 Cry to Me (Solomon Burke)\n\n03 Twist and Shout (Isley Brothers)\n\n04 Tell Him (Exciters)\n\n05 You'll Never Leave Him (Isley Brothers)\n\n06 He's Just a Playboy (Drifters)\n\n07 As Long as I Have You (Garnet Mimms)\n\n08 I Want Candy (Strangeloves)\n\n09 Hang On Sloopy (McCoys)\n\n10 Here Comes the Night (Them)\n\n11 Time Is on My Side (Rolling Stones)\n\n12 I'll Come Running Over (Lulu)\n\n13 Ain't Nobody Home (Howard Tate)\n\n14 Stay with Me (Lorraine Ellison)\n\n15 Are You Lonely for Me (Freddie Scott)\n\n16 I Can't Wait until I See My Baby's Face (Dusty Springfield)\n\n17 Get It While You Can (Howard Tate)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16687721/COVRDBernsRagvy_1961-1967_Volum1_atse.zip.html\n\nI have to admit that I've cheated big time in making the cover art. I couldn't find a single photo of Berns and Ragovoy together. So I took a photo of Berns (on the right) standing with some other guy, and I replaced that other guy's head with Ragovoy's head from some other photo. I hope I haven't offended anyone with this audacity. Ragovoy's head seems unusually large and long, but from all the photos I've seen of him, that's just how he looked.\n\nMonths later, I figured out a way to colorize the photo, so I did so.\n\nHere's another concert from Derek and the Dominos, Eric Clapton's stellar band in 1970.\n\nNote that only two nights at the Fillmore East were the only concerts by this band that were recorded at soundboard quality. After those shows, which I've posted here already, the sound quality of all other shows by the band drops dramatically. But there are still two other shows that I consider worthy of owning and frequently listening to. I've posted one of those (played at the Cincinnati Music Hall) and this is the other one.\n\nYes, the sound quality is merely good, not excellent. But this is Derek and the Dominos, which in my opinion and the opinion of many others were the pinnacle of Clapton's long career. The sound is definitely listenable, with no major flaws. It's an audience recording, but you never hear any annoying aspects of that, such as people talking over the music. The problem is just that the sound is a bit distant and muffled.\n\nBut I took care to use the bootleg with the best sound, based on what die-hard Clapton fans claim. And the performance more than makes up for the minor sound issue, in my opinion. As usual when he played with the Dominos, Clapton was on fire. For instance, many think that this (sixteen-minute long) version of \"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad\" was one of the best soloing of his career. Also, there are some interesting rarities played, despite there being only seven songs played in this seventy-minute long show: \"Ramblin' On My Mind,\" \"Mean Old World\" and \"Motherless Children.\" In particular, this may have been the only time \"Motherless Children\" was played by the band, yet the arrangement closely matches the version that would appear on Clapton's 1974 album \"461 Ocean Boulevard.\"\n\nNote that I previously posted a \"Live and Rare\" album of Derek and the Dominos live rarities. But I didn't include any songs from this show in that one, knowing that I'd post it here later.\n\nSo basically, if you like this band as much as I do and you want to hear their live recordings, you should have all three albums I've made of the Fillmore East shows first and foremost, plus the Cincinnati concert I've posted, plus this one, plus the \"Live and Rare\" compilation. The rest has sound quality that's too poor for my tastes, sadly including the Tampa concert with Duane Allman, which is only listenable in parts.\n\n01 Ramblin' On My Mind (Derek & the Dominos)\n\n02 Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad (Derek & the Dominos)\n\n03 Blues Power (Derek & the Dominos)\n\n04 Have You Ever Loved a Woman (Derek & the Dominos)\n\n05 Mean Old World (Derek & the Dominos)\n\n06 Motherless Child (Derek & the Dominos)\n\n07 Let It Rain (Derek & the Dominos)\\\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15288302/DereknDom_1970b_ElctricFactryTheatrePhiladelphiaPA__10-16-1970_atse.zip.html\n\nFor the album cover, I used a publicity photo of the band (plus someone's dog) as the main photo. But I also found a logo of the concert venue, the Electric Factory Theatre, and I added that in as well. Good color photos of the band are few and far between. All I could find was a black and white one. But over a year after first posting this album, I colorized the cover.\n\nIf you've been following my postings about Robyn Hitchcock, you've probably noticed that I like to post an all-acoustic version of each of his studio albums whenever that's possible (and it usually is). This album is another one of those. And this time, I'm happy to say, it's a fairly complete version. I was able to find acoustic versions of 10 of the 12 songs on \"Spooked,\" his album from 2004.\n\nHappily, the sound quality of these performances range from very good to excellent, even though every single song is officially unreleased. It seems that Hitchcock did a lot of in-person radio appearances to promote his album, and five of the ten songs here come from such appearances. Those recordings basically sound as good as professional studio recordings. The other five were done live in concert. But most or all of those are soundboards, and at least two of them were played live over the radio.\n\nSo, all in all, the sound quality is good, and \"Spooked\" happens to be a particularly strong Hitchcock album.\n\nThis album is 42 minutes long.\n\n01 Television (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n02 If You Know Time (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n03 English Girl (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n04 Demons and Fiends (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n05 Creeped Out (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n06 Sometimes a Blonde (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n07 We're Gonna Live in the Trees (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n08 Tryin' to Get to Heaven (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n09 Full Moon in My Soul (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n10 Flanagan's Song (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15272873/RobynH_2004_SpookdAcousticVersions_atse.zip.html\n\nI think I got lucky with the cover art. The official \"Spooked\" cover used a portion of a Hitchcock painting. I was able to find a photo of the whole painting. So I've included most of it. (I wish I could have included all of it, but it was a little wider than tall, so I had to crop some of the sides.) The \"Spooked\" cover just focuses on the cat-like creature with two pointy ears and a half-black face.\n\nI recently posted an album of Pete Townshend's demos of Who songs from 1964 to 1965. This is a sequel to that, dealing with the year 1966. Naturally, the series will continue until the end of the Who's main era, through 1982.\n\nI love virtually all of the Who's studio work, but I especially enjoy this era, roughly covering the \"A Quick One\" album, plus assorted singles. It seems we only are lucky enough to get a random grab bag of demos from this time.\n\nOnly five of the songs here have been officially released, all of them on the demo compilations \"Scoop\" and \"Another Scoop,\" or the super deluxe edition of \"The Who Sell Out.\" But that's okay, because the other songs generally have a similar sound quality. One exception is \"I'm a Boy.\" The sound quality for that one is pretty good, except there's a fair amount of popping and crackling. I'm guessing someone recorded an acetate record, which quickly degraded each time it was played. But the song is still worth inclusion, especially because it's a lot longer than the single, and has some extra lyrics.\n\nSome of the other songs have significant differences with the Who versions, for instance \"Magic Bus.\" But, generally speaking, these demos aren't like normal demos in that they sound good enough to be released at the time.\n\nThis album is 38 minutes long.\n\n01 Substitute (Pete Townshend)\n\n02 Run Run Run [Version 1] (Pete Townshend)\n\n03 Disguises (Pete Townshend)\n\n04 Happy Jack (Pete Townshend)\n\n05 Don't Look Away (Pete Townshend)\n\n06 I'm a Boy (Pete Townshend)\n\n07 Relax [Version 1] (Pete Townshend)\n\n08 So Sad about Us (Pete Townshend)\n\n09 Magic Bus (Pete Townshend)\n\n10 Run Run Run [Version 2] (Pete Townshend)\n\n11 Sunrise [Version 2] (Pete Townshend)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16696944/PETTWNSHND1966_WhoDmosVol2_atse.zip.html\n\nI'm not sure when or where the photo for the cover art comes from. But clearly Townshend is playing a 12-string guitar in a studio. Based on his appearance, I'd guess it's from 1966 or 1967. Oh, by the way, the photo ended right above Townshend's head. I did a little Photoshop work to extend the background higher.\n\nThis is the fourth and last of the albums dealing with Dusty Springfield performing songs on TV or radio that she'd released on record. I've posted an entire separate series of albums of her performing songs on TV and radio that she didn't release on record. So with this album, I'm finishing up posting all the stuff I've had from her on TV and radio.\n\nAs I said before, there never has been any official live album from her prime years in the 1960s and early 1970s, and not even any bootlegs from that time. So these TV and radio performances is probably all we're ever going to get in terms of hearing her perform live from that time period.\n\nLike the last album in this series, only two of the songs have been officially released, \"The Windmills of Your Mind,\" and \"Son of a Preacher Man.\" The other ones generally are very good in terms of sound quality. But there are some that sound a little worse, mostly due to slightly muffled recording of her TV show appearances, taken from YouTube videos.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of performances peters out in the early 1970s. She was still popular in 1969 with her big hit \"Son of a Preacher Man,\" but her popularity slid after that, which meant she had fewer opportunities to appear on TV or the radio. After about 1973, her career pretty much petered out altogether, apparently hindered by lots of drug use. Happily, she pulled herself together and had a career comeback in the late 1970s that continued through the end of her life. But I personally am far less interested in that phrase of her career. Her singing ability was still great, but I have issues with both the production and song choices (not just with her, but with musical trends in general).\n\nThus, this is where this series ends.\n\nThis album is 45 minutes long.\n\n01 Morning [Bom Dia] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n02 Love Power (Dusty Springfield)\n\n03 Am I the Same Girl (Dusty Springfield)\n\n04 No Stranger Am I (Dusty Springfield)\n\n05 The Windmills of Your Mind (Dusty Springfield)\n\n06 A Brand New Me (Dusty Springfield)\n\n07 Son of a Preacher Man (Dusty Springfield)\n\n08 Silly, Silly Fool (Dusty Springfield)\n\n09 How Can I Be Sure (Dusty Springfield)\n\n10 I Wanna Be a Free Girl (Dusty Springfield)\n\n11 Just a Little Lovin' (Dusty Springfield)\n\n12 Won't Be Long (Dusty Springfield)\n\n13 Packin' Up (Dusty Springfield)\n\n14 Yesterday When I Was Young (Dusty Springfield)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16687959/DUSTYSPRNGFLD1969-1973_AlternteTVRdioPerfrmancesVolum4_atse.zip.html\n\nI'm not sure when or where the photo for the cover art comes from, but my notes say it's probably from 1969.\n\nI've posted a bunch of Davie Bowie stray tracks albums. I've gone as far as I want to go with that, ending in the mid-1980s. Now, I want to start posting his BBC performances. There was an official double album called \"Bowie at the Beeb.\" That was a great release, but unfortunately, it's incomplete. Thus, I felt a need to fix things.\n\nThis album is a case in point. Eight of the 14 songs on it are from \"Bowie at the Beeb.\" When I first posted this, five other songs were unreleased, but four of those have since been released, so I've upgraded those.\n\nOn top of all that, I've added in non-BBC performances if they are of interesting songs and were played live on the TV or radio. There's only one such instance here. That's a performance of \"Space Oddity\" done at an awards show in Britain. I could be wrong, but I think it was the first time Bowie played a song on TV anywhere. It's the only performance here that's still unreleased.\n\nThe album is exactly an hour long. I have four more BBC albums to post, going through 1973, so you can see I'm including a lot of material not on the official release (which goes through 1972).\n\nUPDATE: On November 21, 2021, I updated the mp3 download file. I was able to update the first three songs from an official release, as bonus tracks on a new version of the 1967 \"David Bowie\" album. Plus, the fourth song came out officially on the new archival album \"Conversation Piece.\" I upgraded that one too.\n\n01 Love You Till Tuesday (David Bowie)\n\n02 When I Live My Dream (David Bowie)\n\n03 Little Bombardier (David Bowie)\n\n04 When I'm Five (David Bowie)\n\n05 In the Heat of the Morning (David Bowie)\n\n06 London Bye Ta-Ta (David Bowie)\n\n07 Karma Man (David Bowie)\n\n08 Silly Boy Blue (David Bowie)\n\n09 Let Me Sleep Beside You (David Bowie)\n\n10 Janine (David Bowie)\n\n11 Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed (David Bowie)\n\n12 Space Oddity (David Bowie)\n\n13 I'm Waiting for the Man (David Bowie)\n\n14 The Width of a Circle (David Bowie)\n\n15 Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud (David Bowie)\n\n16 The Supermen (David Bowie)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15129405/DavidB_1967-1970_BBSessionsVolume1_atse.zip.html\n\nI believe the cover art photo is from 1967. I don't know the exact source. I changed the colors a bit because the photo originally was bleached of colors, almost like a black and white photo. When I upped the color intensity it looked a lot better, but that made the background too drastically colored, so I dulled that some.\n\nI previously posted a bunch of albums called \"On TV and Radio\" that are filled with songs Dusty Springfield sang on TV and radio in the 1960s and early 1970s that she didn't put on any records. This second series of four albums deals with the songs she performed on TV and radio that she did put on record.\n\nAll but five of the songs are officially unreleased. The five that have been released are: \"Every Ounce of Strength,\" \"Won't Be Long,\" \"Twenty-Four Hours from Tulsa,\" \"Don't Let Me Lose This Dream,\" and \"It Was Easier to Hurt Him.\"\n\nThe vast majority of songs are from a BBC show she hosted in 1966 and 1967, simply called \"Dusty.\" These songs were performed live in front of an audience, but I've minimized the cheering after the songs.\n\nAs far as sound quality goes, some of the unreleased songs sound merely good instead of great. Sometimes, there's a bit of muffling or distance.\n\nThis album is 41 minutes long.\n\n01 Every Ounce of Strength (Dusty Springfield)\n\n02 Goin' Back (Dusty Springfield)\n\n03 Won't Be Long (Dusty Springfield)\n\n04 Bring Him Back (Dusty Springfield)\n\n05 Some of Your Lovin' (Dusty Springfield)\n\n06 Twenty-Four Hours from Tulsa (Dusty Springfield)\n\n07 Live It Up (Dusty Springfield)\n\n08 I'll Try Anything (Dusty Springfield)\n\n09 I Only Wanna Laugh (Dusty Springfield)\n\n10 Don't Let Me Lose This Dream (Dusty Springfield)\n\n11 Sunny (Dusty Springfield)\n\n12 Time After Time (Dusty Springfield)\n\n13 It Was Easier to Hurt Him (Dusty Springfield)\n\n14 Sweet Lover No More (Dusty Springfield)\n\n15 It's Over (Dusty Springfield)\n\n16 Come Back to Me (Dusty Springfield)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15328001/DstySpr_1966-1968_AlternteTVRdioPerfrmancesVolum2_atse.zip.html\n\nThis cover photo dates from 1965. That's just outside the time frame of the music here, but the picture quality was so good for this one I decided to use it anyway. Besides, unlike most musicians during those fast-changing years, her appearance didn't change much.\n\nI've got a lot of live Maria McKee music I want to post, but first I want to complete the posting of studio stray tracks. Here's another, covering 2001 to 2008.\n\nMcKee's career was doing well up through her \"Life Is Sweet\" album in 1996. Then she didn't put out another album until 2003's \"High Dive.\" She barely toured or did anything else musical in that seven year gap, which killed whatever career momentum she had going. Then she got busy again, putting out three studio albums and two live albums from \"High Dive\" in 2003 to \"Late December\" in 2007. Since then, she's largely been silent, putting out no new albums at all.\n\nI'm not sure why her career has had these ups and downs. Maybe someone who knows more can explain. But this album collects stray tracks that largely deals with that 2003 to 2007 burst of activity. Eight of the 13 songs were officially released, with one of those being a bonus track and the rest coming from soundtracks or other various artists compilations, or duets on other artists' albums.\n\nOf the unreleased tracks, two come from radio or TV shows, and the sound quality of those are excellent. The last three come from bootlegs of concerts, and the sound quality dips some, but it's still good.\n\nThis album is 43 minutes long.\n\n01 Wayfaring Stranger (Maria McKee)\n\n02 Trophy Girl (Maria McKee)\n\n03 Tender Even Then (Kristian Hoffman & Maria McKee)\n\n04 Ma Blonde Est Partie (Maria McKee)\n\n05 Tout Un Beau Soir En Me Promenant (Maria McKee)\n\n06 Life Is Sweet [Acoustic Version] (Maria McKee)\n\n07 Candy's Room (Maria McKee)\n\n08 Turn Away [Acoustic Version] (Maria McKee)\n\n09 Jenny Jenkins (Ryan Hedgecock & Maria McKee)\n\n10 This Road Is Long (Stuart A. Staples & Maria McKee)\n\n11 The Bridge (Maria McKee)\n\n12 New Pony [Acoustic Version] (Maria McKee)\n\n13 Death Is Not the End (Maria McKee)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15848218/MariMcK_2001-2008_WayfarngStrangr_atse.zip.html\n\nThe cover art uses a photo from a 2007 concert.\n\nI previously posted a bunch of Dusty Springfield albums, all of which I called \"On TV and Radio.\" Basically, she has an entire second discography in the 1960s and early 1970s composed on songs she performed on TV or radio but never put on any of her records. I've posted eight of those albums.\n\nThis is the start of a related but different series. It contains the songs she played on TV and radio that WERE also released on her records. There's no such thing as a live album from her peak years, not even a bootleg. Although these all are songs she'd released on singles and/or albums, they're different performances, and generally in front of a live audience, so this is as close to a live album of her famous songs as we're likely to get.\n\nI had enough material for four such albums.\n\nIt's surprising to me that she played songs she didn't record (eight albums' worth) on TV and radio more than the ones she did record (four albums' worth). But the ratio actually would be different if you consider that she tended to play some of her hit songs over and over again, such as \"Son of a Preacher Man.\" I've only included one version of each. I tried to pick the ones that had the best sound quality and performance.\n\nFive of the songs have \"[Edit]\" in their titles. That's because those are cases where BBC DJs spoke over some of the music. But I used the audio editing program X-Minus to remove their voices while keeping the underlying music.\n\nThis album is 40 minutes long.\n\n01 Standing in the Need of Love (Dusty Springfield)\n\n02 Stay Awhile - I Only Want to Be with You (Dusty Springfield)\n\n03 I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself (Dusty Springfield)\n\n04 La Bamba [Edit] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n05 I Can't Hear You [No More] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n06 Losing You [Edit] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n07 Wishin' and Hopin' (Dusty Springfield)\n\n08 All Cried Out (Dusty Springfield)\n\n09 Mockingbird [Edit] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n10 In the Middle of Nowhere (Dusty Springfield)\n\n11 Who Can I Turn To [When Nobody Needs Me] [Edit] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n12 Chained to a Memory [Edit] (Dusty Springfield)\n\n13 Little by Little (Dusty Springfield)\n\n14 You Don't Have to Say You Love Me (Dusty Springfield)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/15328002/DstySpr_1963-1966_AlternteTVRdioPerfrmancesVolum1_atse.zip.html\n\nThe cover art photo comes from a TV performance in 1965.\n\nI still have tons of Robyn Hitchcock albums to post, so here's another one. In 2003, he released the album \"Luxor.\" This is the all-acoustic version of that.\n\n\"Luxor\" has 13 songs on it. I was only able to find solo acoustic versions for nine of them. Chances are he hasn't played the other ones in concert in that format. The album is a bit on the short side, at only 33 minutes. But that's all the songs that fit the concept.\n\nIn terms of sound quality, this is very good. As my Hitchcock albums move towards the current day, the sound quality generally goes up, probably due to tapers using better equipment. All the versions here are officially unreleased. One song is from an in-person radio appearance and the rest are from concerts. But, as usual, I've removed the audience noise.\n\n\"My Mind Is Connected to Your Dreams.\" It's not from \"Luxor,\" but it's a song he did with the Soft Boys around that time. This is the solo acoustic version. \"Madelaine\" and \"Let the Sun Begin\" are not from \"Luxor,\" but they are acoustic versions of songs from that time period.\n\n01 The Sound of Sound (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n02 One L (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n03 Penelope's Angles (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n04 The Idea of You (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n05 You Remind Me of You (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n06 Keeping Finding Me (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n07 Idonia (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n08 Solpadeine (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n09 City of Women (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n10 Madelaine (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n11 Let the Sun Begin (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\n12 My Mind Is Connected to Your Dreams (Robyn Hitchcock)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16067996/RobynH_2003_LuxrAcousticVersions_atse.zip.html\n\nThe cover art uses a drawing made by Hitchcock. I don't know when or where it's from - or even what exactly it is! It just seemed to fit. I don't remember what the caption on the right side used to say. But I erased whatever was there and added in the words \"Luxor Acoustic\" instead."
