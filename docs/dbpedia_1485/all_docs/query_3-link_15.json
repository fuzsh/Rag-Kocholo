He died in 1967 at the age of 38, only seven years after his first hit, \"A Little Bit of Soap,'' with the Jarmels. But in those seven years, he gave the world masterpieces ranging from \"Piece of My Heart'' to \"Twist and Shout.''",

        "text": "undefined\n\nBert Berns: Chuck's Signature Tunes\n\nundefined\n\nA Little Bit of Soap\n\nThis is the original band doing the 1961 hit written by Bert Berns, the Class of 2016 Ahmet Ertegun Lifetime Achievement Award Class of 2016 Rock and Roll of Fame inductee.\n\nThe tune launched a seven-year run of hits from Berns both as a songwriter, a producer and label head. It came to a close with his death at the age of 38, a victim of the scarred that he suffered during a bout with rheumatic fever as a teenager.\n\nTwist and Shout\n\nPhil Spector produced the original version of this Bert Berns-penned song . . . and Berns absolutely HATED it.\n\nHe went on and redid the song with the Isley Brothers and it became one of the most-loved hits of the era. When the Beatles covered it, with John Lennon singing lead, they were surprised to find that Berns had written the song, and not the Isleys.\n\nCry to Me\n\nBert Berns was on the board and wrote this song that helped make Solomon Burke a superstar.\n\nIt shows a lot of the Afro-Cuban influence that made such an impact on Berns long before he became music's go-to guy in 1961.\n\nEverybody Needs Somebody to Love\n\nThe Bert Berns-Solomon Burke collaboration worked again on this tune from 1964. Wilson Pickett covered the song a few years later, also with Berns, who wrote the song, on the mixer board.\n\nUnder the Boardwalk\n\nBen E. King just absolutely adored Bert Berns who was able to get this stunning performance out of the band in 1964.\n\nHe loved him so much that in later years -- not much later, because Berns and 1967 came almost to a simultaneous close -- he returned to the studio with Berns to try to capture the feeling.\n\nPiece of My Heart\n\nJanis Joplin's version of this Berns-written song may be more famous, but to Berns, who also served as producer on this track, and his family, the version sung by Aretha Franklin's big sister is THE version.\n\nBrown Eyed Girl\n\nBert Berns and Van Morrison met in Britain where the New York wunderkind had traveled and become the first American to serve as a producer for the legendary Decca label.\n\nBerns later brought Morrison across the pond and was in the producer's chair when Morrison recorded this classic.\n\nHang On Sloopy\n\nEvery Ohioan worth his Buckeye T-shirt knows this Berns-co-authored tune is the official state rock song, as recorded by the McCoys.\n\nBut there's a great story involved: The song was originally recorded by another group, with another producer, Berns despised the recording. Three producer-songwriter friends of his - Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein and Richard Gottehrer - had put together a group they called the Strangeloves. Over the famous \"Bo Diddly Beat,'' the three put out a song called \"I Want Candy,'' that somehow became a hit.\n\nThe Strangeloves, who pretended to be from Australia, went out on tour and heard 16-year-old guitar whiz Rick Zehringer and his band and brought them back to New York. The boys in the band -- and by now, you know that Rick Zehringer actually is the real name of the guitarist who became famous as Rick Derringer -- fought the whole way. \"Like the Hatfields and McCoys,'' one of the Strangeloves triumvirate said.\n\nThey couldn't call 'em the Hatfields, so by the time they guys got to New York, they were the McCoys."
