        "text": "Berns deserves the kind of biography a great film director would have. Todd McCarthy's sweeping account of the life of Howard Hawks was a model. Much of his music has gone unheard since its original release. Many of the details of the process have been lost to time. The participants themselves have difficulty recalling long ago events that did not seem noteworthy to them at the time. \"It's like trying to remember wallpaper you hung forty years ago,\" said Artie Butler, the arranger who made so many of these great records.\n\nBerns' story lies buried under layers of history. A straight-forward biography would leave large parts of the puzzle missing. Berns' life and work can only truly be seen as part of the firmament of the New York music business, extending back nearly a hundred years before Berns joined up. In particular, the New York rhythm and blues world in which he operated was a collaborative creative community, a small pond full of big fish - \"We were all characters,\" said Morris Levy of Roulette Records -- and there is no understanding the life and work of Bert Berns without knowing in detail about Leiber and Stoller, Atlantic Records, Burt Bacharach, Hill and Range, George Goldner and all the others who shaped the music and the times. They were all gears on the same machine pushed up against each other. It is important to give his story the widest possible perspective - all the way back to the very beginning of popular music in America with Stephen Foster - so that the relative moral universe of the music business can be, if not appreciated, at least taken into account. How Max Dreyfus has eluded his place in the history of American music cannot be explained simply by his loathing of personal publicity, but he set standards of greed and intrigue in music publishing that stand to this day. Dreyfus was first pointed out to me by conspiracy theorist Jerry Leiber, who saw the slender, aristocratic fingers of the ASCAP founding member reaching into the grubby world of Elvis Presley and rock and roll.\n\nJeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich, Phil Spector, Bert Berns at BMI Awards Dinner, 1963.\n\nIn the end, Berns' career almost perfectly encapsulated the height of the New York independent record scene. He walked onstage in those days after the emergence of rock and roll where the New York music business utterly dominated the pop music universe. When he died seven turbulent years later, the day was done. Corporations started buying up the few independents still standing. New songwriters and new songs stocked the hit parade. The pop music world turned a page.\n\nThese songwriters wrote all these songs expecting them to go up the charts, down the charts and never be heard again. Shakespeare probably felt the same way. But their music never disappeared. These songs became the new standards. They were embedded in the sounds of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and all who came after. They also turned out to be publishing bonanzas that paid dividends long after the initial recordings ended their lives on the charts. That was never part of the original grift.\n\nBerns wasn't the greatest of the era, although his best work was as good as anybody's. But his unique voice as a songwriter, producer and record man is so deeply ingrained into the fabric of pop music, it has become common parlance. Songs of his such as \"Twist and Shout,\" \"Hang On Sloopy\" or \"Piece Of My Heart\" have been covered, quoted, cannibalized, used as salvage parts and recycled so many times, his touch has just dissolved into the literature. His name may be lost, but his music is everywhere.\n\nLike Burt Bacharach and Phil Spector, Berns was a disciple of Leiber and Stoller. They all studied at the feet of the masters. Bacharach turned Leiber and Stoller's baion rhythms into gorgeous, baroque pop. Spector matched the majesty of their symphonic rhythm and blues with cacophonous mulch he borrowed from producer Frank Guida of Norfolk, Virginia, where Guida presided over clattering, blurry, throbbing productions on records by Gary \"U.S.\" Bonds and others he released on his own Legrand Records. Guida was an authentic barbaric primitive and Spector took the basic Leiber and Stoller blueprint and filtered it through that gauzy sensibility to create a truly thunderous sound on his productions with the Crystals, Ronettes and other Philles Records acts. Berns specialized in three-minute r&b grand operas, all emotional drama and gospel fury, always with Arsenio Rodriguez's ritmo diablo insinuating itself in between the lines. He transformed the Leiber and Stoller archetypes into yet another deeply personal scenario.\n\nRussell Byrd\n\nDrawing from the same rich talent pool of songwriters, arrangers, session musicians, engineers and artists, these men made almost entirely different records with the same resources. Berns was the funky one, the street cat, the producer who spoke the musicians' language. He was not a schooled musician like Bacharach, but he could read and write music. As a youth, he studied classical piano and would occasionally return to those pieces, but only for his own private entertainment. He was no virtuoso, but he could get his point across. As a guitarist, he could wring a galloping, signature sound out of his nylon-stringed model that stitches its way through a number of his productions, Berns working both sides of the glass. Like most of his contemporaries, Berns depended on arrangers such as Garry Sherman or Teacho Wiltshire to pencil out his vision, but his records with the same arrangers and sidemen sound distinctly like Bert Berns records and bear little relation to work by the same people with other producers. During his first year in the record business, Berns fumbled around for his voice, but once he found his spiritual link to the mambo and rhythm and blues, he instinctively grew into an auteur, an artist who used personal themes to fashion universal messages.\n\nBerns made fifty-one pop chart singles in seven years; nineteen in 1964, his first year as Atlantic Records staff producer, the same year the Beatles and other British rock acts swept America. He made a lot of records that didn't hit the pop charts, but sold r&b, almost took off regionally, bubbled under and otherwise showed signs of life not registered by the pop charts. He did records that never charted with important artists such as Tammy Montgomery, Wilson Pickett or Patti Labelle and the Bluebelles that rank among their best. He wrote or co-wrote almost all."
