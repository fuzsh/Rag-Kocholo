        "text": "Ohio State band drums 2013\n\nYou've heard the Ohio State band play \"Hang On Sloopy,\" oh, a thousand times. But do you know who wrote the song? A new biography of songwriter Bert Berns tells you that - and a lot more.\n\n(Marvin Fong, The Plain Dealer)\n\nHe wrote or produced \"Twist and Shout,\" \"Hang on Sloopy,\" \"Brown\n\nEyed Girl\" and \"Piece of My Heart.\"\n\nAnd you almost certainly don't know his name.\n\nBut you'll know that and a lot more after you meet Bert Berns, courtesy of Joel Selvin, whose biography of Berns represents a masterpiece of research, writing and investigative literature about one of the most influential and little-known songwriters in rock history.\n\n\"Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm &\n\nBlues\" (Counterpoint pp 406, $25) tells the story of Berns, a man who knew from an early age that because of heart problems related to rheumatic fever he had a short time on earth. From the age of 30, for the next seven years, Berns wrote an astounding 51 chart-placing singles, including the aforementioned, \"Here Comes the Night\" (hence, the book's title) and a lot more.\n\nSelvin was the rock critic at the San Francisco Chronicle for 36 years and is the author of 12 previous books including the New York Times No. 1 best seller \"Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock\" with Sammy Hagar.\n\nHere, Selvin chronicles in delicious detail the golden era of the early 1960s rhythm and blues music scene and the turbulent, hard-knuckle world of record-making behind the glitzy, gold foil fa√ßade of rock and roll success and glamor.\n\nAnd, just as a casual observation, where is the statue of Berns on the Ohio State University campus? It should be right next to the one of Woody Hayes.\n\nQ. When did you first hear of Bert Berns?\n\nA. I read a passage about him in Charlie Gillett's \"The Sound Of the City\" and immediately recognized a desperate inner core to all the songs he cited. Charlie was a pioneer rock historian (and important global music deejay in the UK) and we exchanged emails about the Berns book being published and his sparking it before he died.\n\nQ. Why was his story so long overlooked?\n\nA. Berns left a lot of important enemies behind him when he died in 1967. Neil Diamond hates him (Van Morrison -- mixed feelings at best). Jerry Wexler, who was his best friend and mentor, told me he would have nothing to do with the book: \"I don't know where he's buried, but if I did, I'd piss on his grave.\"\n\nQ. Was it difficult to find information about his life and career?\n\nA. I went to NYC in May '98 to start research when most of the key figures were still alive. The number of people who have passed since then -- Jerry Leiber, Ellie Greenwich, Hal David, Phil Ramone, etc., etc -- is staggering. Ahmet (Ertegun, founder and president of Atlantic Records) and Wexler refused to talk. There's a lot of court documents and his kids opened a lot of doors for me. They introduced me to Carmine DeNoia, who proved to be a hugely crucial source and crux character in the final act.\n\nQ. How did you get the information you needed to write this book?\n\nA. Couple hundred interviews, endless library hours, hundreds of books and magazines, tape transcripts, FBI records, lawsuit pleadings, small print on record labels.\n\nQ. Why was Berns so unpopular with his contemporaries?\n\nA. He wasn't unpopular with his friends. Only his enemies didn't like him. People loved him. Ellie Greenwich cried during our interview talking about him. He was a sweet, intense but happy-go-lucky guy -- all music, all hit records -- but he was not someone to cross. He was a fierce Jew with a short time to live.\n\nQ. How did organized crime figure into his dealings with artists like Neil Diamond and Van Morrison?\n\nA. Berns used his mob associations to negotiate his exit from the partnership with Atlantic Records that owned Bang Records and Web IV publishing. Carmine, who was no made man but could be a threatening figure, broke a guitar over Morrison's head. Berns scared the (crap) out of Diamond when he decided to vacate his deal with Bang. Diamond's show at the Bitter End was smoke-bombed. His manager was \"mugged.\" He was close friends with both Patsy Pagano, a major player on the docks, and Tommy Eboli, acting head of the Genovese family.\n\nIt's also important to note -- and I go to great lengths in the book to point this out -- that organized crime figures riddled the NYC R&B scene at the time. I detail the associations of known crime figures such as Tommy Vastola or Sonny Franceze. The entire end of Leiber and Stoller's career was because of their accidental involvement with the mob. I go into it all -- George Goldner and Morris Levy. I knew it was important to draw the relative moral universe in which Berns operated.\n\nQ. Didn't everyone bow down to him after 19 of his songs hit the pop charts in his first year at Atlantic?\n\nA. He saved Atlantic's ass. They threw Leiber and Stoller out in a fit of pique and went ice cold. Wexler frantically tried to sell the company. Berns' records with Solomon Burke put the label back in business and when he took over as staff producer in '64, the label went back on the charts. \"Under the Boardwalk\" sold Beatles numbers.\n\nQ. Did he have a classical music education?\n\nA. He could read and write music -- he was no (Burt) Bacharach, but sheet music didn't scare him.\n\nQ. Did he become wealthy before he died?\n\nA. He became wealthy within two years of his first hit, \"A Little Bit of Soap\" by the Jarmels in 1961. He kept a fishbowl in his penthouse where he stuffed royalty checks he was too busy to take to the bank.\n\nQ. Have you got another project in the works?\n\nA. Always. Beautiful photo book by the late, great Jim Marshall of his '60s SF stuff, \"The Haight,\" full color, gorgeous. I did a bunch of books with Marshall when he was alive. I loved him. I am deeply sorry he died. But it has been a lot easier doing a book with him this time. Coming this October. Others are in the works -- project development is an important division in Selvin Enterprises."
