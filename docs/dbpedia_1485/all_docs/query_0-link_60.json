        "meta_description": "I Want Candy by Intended Immigration, released 20 October 2023\n\n1. I Want Candy\n2. I Want Candy (Instrumental)\n\nFittingly delivered in time for Halloween, Intended Immigration&#39;s cover of &quot;I Want Candy&quot; is a high-energy, jazz-infused, drum-driven danceable ditty that blends an electronic house beat with the pounding pulse of a jazz kit.\r\n\r\nThe sweet sound of swing era instruments provides a sonic sugar rush around the candy-craving female vocalist and you can clearly hear producer Thomas Feurer&#39;s loving and admiring nod to some of his genre-defining favorites such as Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman and Clark Terry. \r\n\r\nIf your ears want candy, don&#39;t trick them, treat them to this.",
