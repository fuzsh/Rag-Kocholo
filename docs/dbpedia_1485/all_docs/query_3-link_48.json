        "text": "Even in his mid-1960s heyday, Bert Berns was barely known beyond the obsessives who studied songwriters’ and producers’ credits on 45 r.p.m. records and LP album jackets. And then, after his death in 1967 at the age of 38, something truly odd happened: Though the songs he wrote and produced, like “Twist and Shout” and “Hang On Sloopy,” proved to have durability, growing in stature and popularity as the years passed, Berns’s own reputation receded even further into obscurity.\n\nBut now, Bert Berns is having a moment. A new biography, Joel Selvin’s “Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm & Blues,” praises him as “one of the great originals of the golden age of rhythm and blues,” an argument repeated in a documentary film about his life that is in the works, tentatively called “Bang! The Bert Berns Story.” And on Monday, a new musical named for another of his well-known songs, “Piece of My Heart,” opens Off Broadway at the Pershing Square Signature Center.\n\n“He wasn’t the best,” Mr. Selvin said in an interview this month. “But his best was as good as anybody’s best.”\n\nCertainly the story of Berns’s life, short though it was, lends itself to the same sense of drama often expressed in his songs. Born into a Jewish family in the Bronx that hoped he might become a classical pianist, he instead developed a love of Latin music that took him to Cuba, where he claimed to have run guns for Fidel Castro’s rebels. A late starter in the music business, he had a hand in more than 50 hits in seven years, consorted with gangsters and succumbed to heart disease just as the careers of his last three protégés, Neil Diamond, Van Morrison and a studio guitarist named Jimmy Page, were getting underway.\n\n“I had no idea who he was” before being invited to write the book for “Piece of My Heart,” the playwright Daniel Goldfarb said. But now, “I feel like Bert Berns was an artist who had a lot stacked against him and had to fight his way through it.” He added: “Even though his music is so diverse, the songs are autobiographical. That’s why he’s a great artist: He has a voice and knew how to tap into it.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
