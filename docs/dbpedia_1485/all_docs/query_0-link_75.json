        "text": "Will the real Bert Berns please stand up?\n\nAlthough the alliterative everyman might sound more like the local barkeep than a centerpiece of music history, think again. Do titles like “Hang on, Sloopy,” “I Want Candy” or “Piece of My Heart” ring a bell in your singalong catalogue?\n\nBerns is less than a household name, but his music has survived decades of households, even as the songwriter-producer fell into the depths of footnote, becoming at best the answer to a trivia question—and a hardcore final-round challenge at that.\n\n“I sat around year after year watching my father recede further into oblivion,” said the similarly named Brett Berns, the songwriter’s oldest of three children, who, like much of the world, never knew much about the man who put the “ahs” in “Twist and Shout.”\n\n“He was never mentioned in the rock and roll history books,” the younger Berns said of his father, who died in 1967 at age 38. “He never received any awards from the halls of fame. Meanwhile, his closest peers and collaborators were constantly being recognized.”\n\nThe 51-year-old son of the unfamed songwriter-producer strives to correct music history’s omission with his new documentary Bang! The Bert Berns Story, which plays the Denver Film Festival Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 10, 12 and 13 at the United Artists Denver Pavilions (located on the third floor, next to Jazz at Jack’s).\n\nBorn in New York City’s ethnically diverse borough of the Bronx in 1929 to Russian Jewish immigrants (née Berezovsky), Bert Berns was an unlikely purveyor of black rhythm and blues, especially after suffering as a child from the rheumatic fever that nearly killed him—it finally did, years later, by way of his then-damaged heart.\n\n“I realized his songs were very deeply autobiographical,” the younger Berns said of what he believes were his father’s lifelong metaphors. “‘Piece of My Heart’ and ‘Heart Be Still’ were the last songs he wrote as he was dying of a certain heart attack.”\n\nLike his fellow New York songwriter-producers Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller, Bert Berns was a Jew who somehow tapped into the language and black experience that eventually created rock ‘n’ roll, in his case giving voice to the likes of Solomon Burke and LaVern Baker.\n\nAs it happened, this middle-aged white man was also a transitional figure, directly bridging the black American R&B acts who recorded his songs to the British rock bands that covered them, building the blues credibility of the Rolling Stones and the Animals in the process.\n\n“There were no color barriers in the studio,” the younger Berns said of his father’s world, which coincided with civil-rights struggles. “You see people in the film calling him the white soul brother.”\n\nStrangely enough, Berns was also a decidedly slicked-back link between the old school of New York City music’s hard-knuckled Mafia ties and the late 1960s revolution that forged the careers of Janis Joplin, Van Morrison and Led Zeppelin, among others.\n\nIn following that sometimes vague trail through rock history, Berns’ filmmaker son had his work cut out for him as he strived to learn more about the father he never knew. The elder Berns had given few interviews and none of them could be found, leaving a major hole in both the film—no moving images of words spoken by Berns are in the documentary—and in a son’s journey to discover his dad.\n\nStill, the younger Berns had one ace in the hole.\n\n“He knew he was going to die young and he told my mother, ‘My children will know me through my music,’” Brett said.\n\nEnter eBay, as the filmmaker and his sister began seeking out every piece of their father’s music they could find, often hearing songs for the first time on 45s unearthed at the equivalent of garage sales.\n\n“Each time that happened, it was sort of like we came a step closer to knowing our father through his music,” Brett said.\n\nAs it turned out, Berns was deeply influenced by the Afro-Caribbean music he had heard in New York City nightclubs and later on a visit to Cuba. After landing a job in the legendary Brill Building, he co-wrote “Twist and Shout,” a song that exemplified the songwriter’s fused interests in R&B and world beats.\n\nAlthough the Isley Brothers were the first to score a hit with it, the song reached a whole new level of influence when the Beatles covered it on their first album and the song became an indispensable part of the band’s concert set list.\n\n“Twist and Shout” would become one of many examples of how Berns would be forgotten to history, in part because—as he did with so many of his songs—he inexplicably co-wrote it under a pseudonym, in this case, Bert Russell.\n\n“Paul McCartney [who is interviewed in Bang!] says people thought the Beatles wrote ‘Twist and Shout,’ and he thought the Isleys had written it,” Brett said.\n\nAt Atlantic Records, Berns shepherded such artists as Wilson Pickett and the Drifters, but when the Beatles, the Stones and the Animals began cutting covers of his songs, Berns saw an opportunity on the other side of the Atlantic—literally.\n\nBefore long, he was in England, working with Van Morrison’s Them, which would make a hit of Berns’ “Here Comes the Night,” a song that launched Berns’ long working relationship with Morrison.\n\nIn 1965, Berns co-founded Bang! Records with partners that included the legendary Ahmet Ertegun. Berns wanted to sign Britain’s Jimmy Page to a session contract, but when Ertegun balked, Page returned home to found Led Zeppelin, which recorded the long-unreleased “A Tribute to Bert Berns” after Berns died.\n\nAmong Bang!’s heaviest hitters was Neil Diamond, who after artistic differences with Berns may have found himself on the wrong end of the producer’s Mafia connections when a stink bomb was set off during Diamond’s show at New York City’s Bitter End.\n\n“The Mob were everywhere in the music business back then,” Brett said. “My dad felt comfortable with those guys. It really was not a business relationship. It was a personal relationship that ended up going into his business at times.”\n\nDiamond left Bang! anyway, even after Berns’ pals gave literal meaning to the company’s moniker.\n\nBrett has mixed feelings about the company his father kept, though he insists Diamond maintained a respect for Berns, despite the literal blow-up in their relationship.\n\nAlthough Berns was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, his son thinks a combination of factors have kept his father in relative obscurity.\n\nIn addition to often writing under pseudonyms—a fact that hurt his branding—Berns made his share of enemies, including Ertegun, when the two parted ways after Bang! went bust. According to Brett, his father was also not much inclined toward self-promotion.\n\n“He was so busy. He was in such a hurry,” the filmmaker said. “I don’t think he ever stopped long enough to talk about himself.”"
