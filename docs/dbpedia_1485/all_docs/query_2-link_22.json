        "text": "Rock Hall inductee shouldnit go solo\n\nBert Berns, who died of a heart attack in 1967 at the age of 38, is the lone non-performer in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2016. Ohioans might know him as the man who was the principal writer of 'Hang On Sloopy.' He also wrote 'Piece of My Heart,' and produced Van Morrison's 'Brown-Eyed Girl' and the Drifters' 'Under the Boardwalk.'\n\n(Courtesy of pieceofmyheartmusical.com)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Brett Berns and his siblings, Cassie and Russell, never knew their father, newly minted Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bert Berns.\n\nThe songwriter, label head and especially producer who is this year's entry as the Ahmet Ertegun Lifetime Achievement award winner was only 38 when he died in 1967.\n\n\"My father said to my mother, 'My children will know me in my music,' '' said Brett Berns in a call from his Malibu, California, home. \"I have a brother, Russell, who was 2 weeks old when my dad died. I was 2 and my sister [Cassandra] was 10 months.''\n\nAs you might expect, the younger Berns has been championing his father's cause for decades -- he spent 20 years in the music publishing business, handling the chores that arose when the copyrights for all the music his father wrote ran out.\n\nBut he's not been alone, not by a long shot.\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Steven Van Zandt is a member of the Hall of Fame nominating committee. Van Zandt and his wife, Maureen, were among the producers of an off-Broadway musical, \"Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story,'' that will be headed to Broadway itself next season.\n\nAnd Van Zandt's a producer and narrator for a new documentary co-produced by Berns' children -- Brett himself did the scores of artist interviews that comprise it -- called \"BANG: The Bert Berns Story,'' which just debuted at the South-by-Southwest music and film festival.\n\nTwo guesses who's probably going to induct Berns into the Hall of Fame in ceremonies in Brooklyn, New York, at the Barclays Center on Friday, April 8.\n\nBert Berns until now has been the greatest songwriter and producer in American rock 'n' roll that you never heard of. He wrote \"Twist and Shout'' (Sir Paul McCartney, who appears in the documentary, said the Beatles were surprised to find that he wrote the tune and not the Isley Brothers, who recorded it in 1962 after another group, the Top Notes, failed to score with the song a year earlier.)\n\nBerns was the first American to produce an album for Decca in Britain, and he brought Van Morrison across the pond and produced \"Brown-Eyed Girl.'' He was also on the sound board for Solomon Burke's \"Cry to Me,'' which he wrote as well, and the Drifters' \"Under the Boardwalk.''\n\nOther songs with a Berns connection, either as writer or producer: \"Tell Him,'' the Exciters; \"Cry Baby,'' Garnet Mimms and Janis Joplin; \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,'' Solomon Burke and Wilson Pickett; \"I Want Candy,'' the Strangeloves and Bow Wow Wow; \"Baby, Let Me Take You Home,'' the Animals; and possibly his biggest hit that's not the official state rock song of Ohio, \"Piece of My Heart,'' Erma Franklin (Aretha's big sister) and Janis Joplin.\n\nYes, as every Ohioan knows, Berns -- who often wrote under the name Bert Russell -- was the co-writer for \"Hang On Sloopy.''\n\n\"We love that,'' Berns said, laughing. \"I can't underestimate the importance [of 'Hang On Sloopy'] in my dad's story.\n\n\"It was his only No. 1 record,'' Berns said.\n\nBert Berns, who had had success with Atlantic Records and its leaders, Gerald \"Jerry'' Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun, launched a brand-new label: BANG, named for Berns, Ahmet and Nashui Ertegun and Gerald Wexler.\n\n\"Sloopy'' was recorded after the Strangeloves - actually a group of Berns' fellow producers who were masquerading as Aussie artists with a song called \"I Want Candy'' -- heard a group with 16-year-old Rick Zehringer (who later became Rick Derringer) on guitar and vocals in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nRecorded just two years before his death from a heart attack brought about by a bout with rheumatic fever as a young man, the song has a special place for Berns' son.\n\n\"Every time I meet someone from Ohio and tell people that my dad wrote 'Hang On Sloopy,' I eat and drink for free,'' said Berns, who constantly sports an Ohio State ballcap.\n\nThe hat caught the eye of film producer and director Spike Lee as Berns was boarding a plane not that long ago, Berns said. Lee, as you might expect, was flying first-class.\n\n\"I saw Spike Lee, and he said, 'Go Bucks!' . . . and I walked back to my seat in coach,'' Berns joked.\n\nBert Berns was a rarity, really. Brenda Reid, the lead singer of the Exciters, called him \"a white soul brother,'' and it's really true.\n\nFrom somewhere deep inside, the first-born son of Russian Jewish immigrants had the soul that filled the R&B world, and really was the foundation of the sound that morphed into Motown, even though he was never associated with the label.\n\nBerns was able to turn good artists into great artists. Sure, it sounds like a cliche, but his body of work proves it.\n\n\"Bert was a great artist who played guitar and piano, and he treated [the singers] like artists, as the way he would want to be treated,'' his son said. \"The love he showed them made them feel safer, and he pushed them to exceed their own expectations.\n\n\"Like Cissy Houston said [in the documentary], he didn't treat people in any particular way; he just had love,'' Berns said.\n\n\"I don't know where it came from -- he grew up in the Depression and witnessed what happened in Europe to his [Jewish] people,\" Berns said.\n\nAnd once he'd begun to \"make it,'' he still defied convention, bringing artists of all races to his New York penthouse for drinks, parties and cookouts. He could be tough on artists in the studio, but they knew it was because he wanted the best FOR them, not just from them.\n\nMaybe that's because Berns knew that from the time he was diagnosed with rheumatic fever, he was dying. Doctors didn't expect him to make it to 21 -- and he beat them by 17 years.\n\nIn a way, that worked to his advantage, perverse as it may seem, according to son Brett.\n\n\"I've often thought that if we all lived our lives like Bert Berns, like a person who knew every day could be their last, wow, how productive and incredible our lives could be,'' Brett Berns said.\n\n\"I do think that the heart issue and his knowledge of his impending doom . . . drove him,'' he said.\n\n\"And he did it in seven short years,'' Berns' son said. \"He had his first hit at 31 [the Jarmels' 'A Little Bit of Soap'], and once he started, he never stopped.''\n\nKeep in mind that Berns' deeds were done right in the midst of the British Invasion, when American pop music was, well, not so popular.\n\nBerns' love for people may have worked against him in some quarters. He had lifelong friendships with many in the Mafia.\n\n\"The Mob was around,'' Brett Berns conceded. \"They had their fingers in a lot of different places in the music business.\n\n\"My dad was unique in that he liked those guys and he was comfortable with them and they liked him, but he was not in business with them,'' Berns said.\n\n\"I know I'm his son, and people might accuse me of being protective of his legacy, but we were just driven by the truth'' [in making the documentary], Berns said.\n\nNot that his father was completely above using his \"connections.''\n\n\"He didn't bring them into his business dealings until somebody tried to rob him or hurt him,'' the younger Berns said.\n\nThose connections led to a falling-out with Wexler, who split with Berns and refused to come to his funeral. Wexler, who was known for his propensity for carrying a good grudge, said that while he didn't know where Berns was buried, if he did, he'd \"go [urinate] on his grave.'' That quote plays a prominent role in the documentary.\n\nThe monetary dispute over the split between the two wasn't settled until some of Berns' wiseguy friends intervened and, in their own way, \"suggested'' he pay up.\n\n\"I think the main reason he was forgotten was he died so young,'' Berns said. \"He didn't have a press agent who kept his name up there with the other greats. He was just kind of forgotten. . . . He'd been so utterly forgotten that he disappeared.''\n\nBut no more. With champions like his son and daughter, like Van Zandt and longtime family friend Paul Shaffer, like McCartney and former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham (another Hall of Famer), the man whose songs were so autobiographical is now getting his own rightful due.\n\n\" 'Piece of My Heart' and 'Heart Be Still' were written in the last days of his life, by a guy dying of heart failure,'' Berns said.\n\n\"What was the most incredible thing I learned in making this film is the realization that he wrote his own pathology in this music,'' he said.\n\nAnd now, because of this Rock Hall induction, not just his children but the world is getting a chance to \"know me in my music.''"
