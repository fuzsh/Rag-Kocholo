        "text": "Beware of this CD!\n\nI just received the compilation called \"The Heart And Soul Of Bert\n\nBerns\" released in October 2002 by Universal Records.\n\nThis is a compilation of tracks written and/or produced by the late\n\nBert Berns. He was a great song writer and a great producer who has\n\nwritten songs recorded by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and many\n\nother famous artists.\n\nThis CD contains 10 original recordings from the 1960's.\n\nThe only information found on the inlay is that the CD was produced by\n\nDoug Morris. No information about who did the mastering!\n\nBUT:\n\nThis compilation runs for 28 minutes and 11 seconds and has a list\n\nprice of 14.98 dollars!!!!\n\nGenerally speaking the sound quality is acceptable for recordings made\n\nin the 1960's, but one track \"Baby Come On Home\" by Hoagy Lands sounds\n\nTERRIBLE. I own many CD compilations of 1960's recordings, but I have\n\nnever heard a single track with such bad sound quality. Apparently this\n\ntrack is taken directly from a vinyl single or LP. It sounds as if they\n\njust transferred this tune directly from an old scratchy single.\n\nThere is no information of the source of this recording on the\n\ncover or the inlay except that this track is \"under license from\n\nAtlantic Recording Group\".\n\nIf they couldn't find the original tape and they had to use a vinyl\n\nrecord why didn't they inform about this and why didn't they use noise\n\nreduction to get a \"decent\" sound? I have CD's with recordings\n\nby Louis Armstrong made in 1928 that sounds better than this\n\ntrack!\n\nThere is another track by Hoagy Lands \"White Gardenia\" which\n\nalso sounds as if it was taken directly from a vinyl record, but\n\nthis track don't sounds anywhere near as bad as \"Baby Come On Home\"\n\nChrister\n\nStockholm\n\nSweden\n\nA few interesting notes: As I understand it, Doug Morris, head of Universal Music (or whatever they are calling themselves this week) used to work with (or for) Bert Berns. He produced this as a tribute to a major talent.\n\nSome tribute. As you say it is incredibly short, poorly mastered and not worthy of the man. I don't understand at all the point of doing a tribute to someone unless you put forth serious effort in doing so. Anyone who didn't know better would look at the track list and assume that Berns was a minor 60's writer-producer. They would be very wrong. He worked with and/or had his songs recorded by, amongst others, Garnet Mimms, Freddie Scott, Otis Redding, Otis Redding and Carla Thomas, Solomon Burke, Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin, Ben E. King, Van Morrison, The McCoys, Them, The Drifters, The Strangeloves, Gene Pitney, The Kingsmen, The Jarmels, Erma Franklin, The Exciters, The Isley Brothers and, of course, The Beatles' incredible recording of \"Twist and Shout.\"\n\nIf you like this music you can track down a 2-cd, 46 track collection called \"Sloopy II Music Presents the songs of Bert Russel Berns\" (put out by the publishing company that owns the songs - don't ask me where to buy it as living in the Los Angeles area I will very often find collections that are generally unavailable because of the proliferation of promos that are made available to people in the music business that find their way to the used record shops). You will find all of the artists above (except the Beatles) in a collection that is far more worthy of the man than the one put out by someone who is, arguably, the single most powerful record company executive around.\n\nUtterly disgraceful. Doug Morris should have either not done this project or done it properly. He should be ashamed of himself."
