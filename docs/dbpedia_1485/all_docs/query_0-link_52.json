If you love the music Berns made, you'll love this movie; if you don't, I feel for you.\" - The New York Times\n\nMusic producer, songwriter and label-head Bert Berns was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\n\"...As a producer, songwriter and label head, Berns played a role in some of the most enduring records of the Sixties.

That's just for starters. Berns wrote and produced Solomon Burke's \"Cry to Me\" and \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" and the McCoys' \"Hang on Sloopy,\" co-produced the Drifters' \"Under the Boardwalk,\" and wrote and produced Them's \"Here Comes the Night.\" He co-wrote and co-produced the Strangeloves' \"I Want Candy,\" later New Wavedup by a Bow Wow Wow cover. Berns' Bang label also unleashed Neil Diamond on the world via \"Cherry, Cherry,\" \"Solitary Man\" and Diamond's other early hits... for whatever combination of reasons, he had become even less than a footnote in pop history. \" - rollingtone.com, October 23, 2017\n\nTrailer For Documentary:\n\nFeatures:\n\n Double LP\n\n Gatefold\n\n 20 of Bert's greatest hits\n\n New liner notes by Brett Berns & Joel Selvin\n\nSelections:\n\nSide One:\n\n1.
