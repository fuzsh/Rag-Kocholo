In the 1960s, Bert Berns was one of the most successful songwriters of his time, producing 51 hits in just 7 years. At the age of 38, Bert Berns died at the height of his career, leaving behind his children, his legend, and music that would live on forever. Piece of My Heart tells Bert’s triumphant and tragic story through the eyes of Jessie, the daughter he never knew. Experience what Rolling Stone calls “one of the great untold stories of rock and roll.” This world premiere musical pulls you into a journey of discovery told through his chart-topping hits (and some rare gems) including “Twist and Shout,” “I Want Candy,” “Hang on Sloopy,” and the immortal title song, “Piece of My Heart.” Meet the man you never knew through the music you’ve loved for years.\n\nProduction History »\n\nPiece of My Heart has been developed over the past decade in and around New York City, including at two of New York’s leading not-for-profit theatre companies – New York Theatre Workshop (RENT) and New York Stage and Film (Hamilton). The musical premiered Off-Broadway at the Pershing Square Signature Center during the summer of 2014, where the limited engagement played 100 performances and was extended by popular demand.\n\nThe creative team completed new work following the widely acclaimed Off-Broadway production, and marquee producers Steven and Maureen Van Zandt, Paul Shaffer and Joe Grano joined the project. The producers of Piece of My Heart released the hit film BANG! The Bert Berns Story, and Bert was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nWho is Bert Berns? »\n\nBert Berns was one of the great originals of the golden age of rhythm and blues. He first flourished as a staff producer at Atlantic Records, but Berns quickly developed into one of the leading record men of his day. He produced historic rhythm and blues records such as “Cry To Me” by Solomon Burke, “Under the Boardwalk” by The Drifters, and “Twist and Shout” by the Isley Brothers. Songs of his such as “Twist and Shout,” “Hang On Sloopy,” and “Piece of My Heart” have become the bedrock of modern music, recorded by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Otis Redding, among many others. As head of his own record label, Bang Records, he signed and supervised the first solo records by Neil Diamond and Van Morrison. Born and raised in the Bronx, Berns suffered rheumatic fever as a teenager — an early death sentence in those pre-open heart surgery days. He died at age 38 on December 30, 1967, at the height of his career. But the music of Bert Berns never died. His songs have been consistently covered by the biggest names in the music business, featured in movie soundtracks, and have inspired many imitations and tributes. Bert Berns was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nWant More? »\n\nRead the acclaimed Bert Berns biography, Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm and Blues, written by award-winning journalist and best-selling author Joel Selvin, published by Counterpoint Press.\n\nSee the documentary film BANG!

Children under the age of four are not permitted in the theatre.\n\n3. What is the running time?\n\nTwo hours and ten minutes, with one intermission.\n\n4. Is there a cast recording of the show?\n\nA cast recording has not been recorded yet. Stay tuned for more information.\n\n5. How can I contact Piece of My Heart?\n\nCall (646) 684-4514.\n\n6. How can I receive more information about the show?\n\nSign up for our newsletter, located at the bottom of this page. You can also stay connected with us on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n1. Why is it so important to tell the story of Bert Berns?\n\nCASSANDRA: Our dad was one of the greatest songwriters and record producers of the twentieth century, yet few have ever heard his name. And his short but spectacular life is not only the greatest untold story of rock and roll, but perhaps one of the greatest of them all. We long ago realized that only through the telling of his dramatic life story would he be recognized for his epochal body of work.\n\n2. What made you decide to tell the story as a musical?\n\nBRETT: The life story of Bert Berns is as fascinating as any work of fiction. And his body of work is largely autobiographical. The convergence of these two forces made for a unique musical vision which allowed us to bring my father back to life through the ultimate art form of musical theater.\n\n3. What have been some of the challenges of telling your father's life story as a musical?\n\nBRETT: The Bert Berns story is vast and complicated – it took biographer Joel Selvin nearly 400 pages to tell it properly in his new book Here Comes The Night. This being a musical where the songs tell the story, we were able to overcome the most difficult challenge presented to any bio-musical and create a truly transformative work of art.\n\n4. How does the character of Jessie represent your own journey of discovery?\n\nCASSANDRA: Jessie is an amalgamation of my brothers and I, and is representative of our quest to learn who our father was and the long effort to champion his legacy. Knowing he would die young, our father would say “my children will know me through my music.” Jessie’s journey of discovery is a dramatization of our own long search for clues to the heart and soul of Bert Berns.\n\n5. How has your father’s story inspired you?\n\nBRETT: The Bert Berns story is inspirational on so many levels. His is an example of extraordinary vision, courage and perseverance. Of respect, collaboration and humility. And of living life with passion and love – as if every day might be your last.\n\n6. Who were some of the great artists that Bert collaborated with?\n\nBRETT: Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Solomon Burke, Ben E. King, Wilson Pickett, Jimmy Page, Freddie Scott, Garnet Mimms, Patti LaBelle, Barbara Lewis, Lavern Baker, Esther Phillips, Tammy Montgomery, Erma Franklin, Cissy Houston, Lulu, Tami Lynn, The Isley Brothers, The Drifters, The Exciters, The McCoys, The Strangeloves, The Kingsmen, The Jarmels, Hoagy Lands, King Curtis, Jimmy Radcliffe, Gene Pitney, Arsenio Rodriguez, Betty Harris – the list goes on and on.\n\n7. Do you have a favorite Bert Berns song?\n\nCASSANDRA: There’s a song in the musical called “I’ll Take Good Care of You” that has always spoken to me. It’s a beautiful and deeply soulful song that he wrote before I was born, but feels all these years later as if it could have been written for me.\n\nUBER\n\nUsing Uber’s free iPhone/Android/Blackberry 7 app, you can request a pickup and a car driven by a professional driver will show up in minutes.
