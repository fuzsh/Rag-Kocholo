        "text": "Written by Krystal Grow\n\nYou know the songs. They’re some of the most memorable pieces of music performed by some of the most legendary artists in the business. But you may not know that songs like “Piece of My Heart,” “Twist and Shout,” and “Cry Baby,” among many others, came from the heart and soul of a man named Bert Berns.\n\n“It’s truly an epic moment to have our New York City premier,” said director Brett Berns, Bert’s son, during the packed DOC NYC screening of Bang! The Bert Berns Story on Friday night. “So much of this story happened right here, and we’re thrilled to be able to share it.”\n\nRacking up 51 pop chart singles in 7 years, Berns was a musical mastermind with a heavy heart. Diagnosed with rheumatic flu as a teenager, he started playing piano as he recovered. It was an easy, relaxing hobby that wouldn’t upset his condition, but once he started writing songs he never stopped, and pursued a career in the music business with the passion and intensity of a man who believed any day could be his last.\n\nMaking the rounds at the legendary Brill Building in New York City, Berns landed a $50 per week job with music publisher Robert Mellins. He penned hits and produced sessions for R&B acts like The Jarmells and Solomon Burke, and gained a reputation as a slick, fast-talking, go-getter with a soft spot for Bossa Nova and Afro-Cuban rhythms who truly understood soul music.\n\nHis early success led to deals with Atlantic Records, where he negotiated with industry heavyweights Jerry Wexler andAhmet Ertegun to create Web IV, his own publishing company, and the record label Bang!, where he produced and recorded behemoth hits like “I Want Candy” by The Strangeloves, “Brown Eyed Girl” by Van Morrison, and “Hang on Sloopy” by The McCoys. But the onslaught of pop hits didn’t diminish his love of soul and R&B, and he was so successful that no one tried to stop him when he launched Shout! – a subsidiary record label dedicated to contemporary rhythm and blues.\n\nAs if Berns hadn’t already made substantial contributions to rock, soul, pop, and R&B, in 1963 The Beatles covered “Twist and Shout,” and effectively stoked the fires of a feverish cultural phenomenon we now call the British Invasion. Following suit, The Rolling Stones picked up Berns’ “Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,” and The Animals took “Baby Let Me Take You Home.”\n\nWith his legacy officially sealed in acetate and number one singles, it seemed that there was no stopping the Bert Berns hit machine. But like so many behind-the-scenes luminaries, Berns is still largely unknown outside music industry insiders, hard core historians, and super fans. But DOC NYC Director of Programming Basil Tsiokos said what makes Bang! The Bert Berns Story such an excellent film is that it appeals to those already in-the-know while also introducing an entirely new audience to an icon. The film is fast, funny, and full of amazing interviews with and anecdotes from the captivating and talented people who were part of the Bert Berns story.\n\n“I wanted to be Bert Burns. I still do,” said musician and radio host Steven Van Zant, who also narrates the film. “He was behind the ultimate era of rock and roll.”\n\nKrystal Grow is a photo editor and freelance writer who has written for American Photo, TIME LightBox, the New York Times Lens blog, Stranger Than Fiction, WIRED, and The Magnum Foundation.
