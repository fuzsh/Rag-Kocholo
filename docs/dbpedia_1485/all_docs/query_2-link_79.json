        "text": "Today’s feature is a salute to another man of strong influence, who in my opinion deserves way more credit as one of music’s pioneers. O’Kelly Isley is an integral part of The Isley Brothers; an iconic family act who have spent parts of seven decades doing what they do best; create great music. Sadly, the music world lost O’Kelly Isley on this day in 1986 but his legend lives on. Here is a very brief bio and just one example of how his contribution has been felt through the years in the form of cover versions of one of their best known songs; ‘Twist and Shout’.\n\nO’Kelly Isley, or Kelly, was the eldest of the Isley Brothers and like many artists of his generation he got his singing start while performing in his church choir. Kelly and his three younger brothers Rudy, Ronnie and Vernon formed the Isley Brothers and toured the gospel circuit in the early ‘50s. The brothers act was devastated when Vernon was killed in a road accident, but this also served as an inspiration to aspire to greater things. The trio headed to New York City to try their hand at becoming a doo-wap group. From 1957 to 1959 they recorded for a couple of fledgling labels before being discovered by a scout and signing with RCA Records.\n\nTheir first hit was the very well known ‘Shout’. This song was co-written by the three brothers and it peaked in the Top 50 of the Hot 100. Through the years ‘Shout’ has gone on to be recorded by too many artists to count, and it still inspires people anywhere from dance floors to sports stadiums. By 1962 the act had moved on to Motown. It was here that they met the legendary Phil Spector who suggested that they record a song written by Bert Berns (Bert Russell) called ‘Twist and Shout’. The song would become The Isley Brothers first top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 going to #17 and #2 on the U.S. R&B charts. As is so often the case, The Isley Brothers did not think ‘Twist and Shout’ would amount to much. They thought it was too close to their own song ‘Shout’ and that it was a matter of ‘been there, done that’. It became a catalyst to the influential artists that we still know and love today. The number of acts they have inspired through the years is immense. The Isley Brothers act would go on to include brothers Marvin and Ernie. Ernie was featured in a post a while back featuring The Isley Brothers social commentary hit ‘Fight the Power’.\n\nWhile speaking in complete reverence of his brother Kelly, Ernie noted that Kelly Isley often reflected on his encounter with a homeless guitar player who literally left him speechless with his playing ability after a chance encounter in the New York City area. Kelly convinced his brothers to hire the guitarist because he had a style and groove that lent itself well to the elevation of their sound. The guitarist’s name was Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix and The Isley Brothers would tour and record together for parts of 1964 and 1965 before the soon to be guitar god would move on to begin his own career. During his time with the Isley Brothers Jimi Hendrix found a home with the Isley Brothers mother. The interconnectedness of the music world is truly a marvel.\n\nKelly Isley was active right up to the time of his death. He had a prominent role on the 1985 album Masterpiece. His final recording with the act was in 1986 on the song ‘Good Hands’ which appeared on the soundtrack for the movie, Wildcats. He died a short time later of a heart attack.\n\nFollowing Kelly’s death, The Isley Brothers released Smooth Sailin’ and dedicated the album to their older brother. This included the tribute song ‘Send a Message’. Before I move on to today’s cover versions here is that tribute.\n\nAs mentioned, The Isley Brothers was not the original version of ‘Twist and Shout’. Here is the original recording by The Top Notes which was produced by up and coming producer Phil Spector in 1961. It is so interesting to note how the song appeared in it’s original version and how The Isley Brothers interpretation became entrenched in all future renditions.\n\nThe story behind the Beatles cover of ‘Twist and Shout’ is another example of music legend. It was released on the band’s Please, Please Me album. The album was recorded in thirteen hours on February 11th, 1963. Producer George Martin purposely waited until the very end to have John Lennon record his challenging vocal. They had the other ten songs done and Martin noted that they had fifteen minutes of studio time remaining. Lennon, who was suffering from a cold battled his way through the recording and managed to produce one his most memorable tracks in one take. Martin attempted a second effort but quickly recognized that Lennon was done and abandoned the process. For Lennon’s part he noted;\n\n…you can hear that I’m a frantic guy doing his best.”\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nHere are the Beatles doing ‘Twist and Shout on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964.\n\n‘Twist and Shout’ was the only Beatles cover song to hit the Top 10, going to #2. It was prevented from reaching #1 by ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’. It was also the only cover song they released to sell over a million copies. It is interesting to note that the Beatles guitar intro is a combined tribute to ‘La Bamba’ by Ritchie Valens and ‘Do You Love Me’ by the Contours.\n\nIn 1970, The Who recorded a version of ‘Twist and Shout’ during their performance at Isle of Wight Festival. This version featured Roger Daltrey on vocals. The band performed ‘Twist and Shout’ as their encore during the 1982 farewell tour. This time John Entwistle did a commendable job on vocals. Here is that performance from December 1982 at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. Great memories of ‘the Ox’. Another music legend gone too soon. One of the best bass players ever.\n\nFinally, I could not possibly feature ‘Twist and Shout’ without recalling this epic moment from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off showing Matthew Broderick lip syncing the song on a parade float. Upon it’s release this scene became a talking point and led to it hitting the charts at #23 in 1986; twenty five years after its original release. Ironically, a Rodney Dangerfield movie called Back to School also featured ‘Twist and Shout’ featuring Dangerfield himself on vocals. One of the funniest comedians ever. Back to School was released in theatres two days after Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.\n\nIt just all speaks to the timeless nature of a great song and it is just one more reason why the world of cover songs is so fascinating."
