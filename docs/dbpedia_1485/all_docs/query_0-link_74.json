        "text": "A Little Bit of Soap & a Lot of Hits!\n\ncraigr244\n\nBert Russell Song Writer Extraordinaire!\n\nBert Russell came to my attention with while working on my McCoys post recently – The song that kicked off the McCoys career, “Hang On Sloopy” was co-written by Russell along with Wes Farrell.\n\nBut long before hitting it with the song first recorded by the Vibrations, Russell had already made his mark on the nation’s charts.\n\nBert Russell was born Bertrand Russell Berns on November 8, 1929 – like Farrell – in New York City – the Bronx to be exact. Russell was inspired by the music of immigrant Cubans and found his was to the island before the revolution took place.\n\nUpon his return he would do a bee-line to join the ‘Brill Building’ genre of young composers who congregated at the 1650 Broadway address – more or less finding the actual Brill at 1619 Broadway off-limits to the young crowd.\n\nBerns recorded with a few groups in his early years including “The Kings of Twist” and a group called “The Mustangs” that was actually Berns with his sometimes writing partner Wes Farrell.\n\nAfter several tries with his song pen – Russell would hit it big with the Jarmels “Little Bit of Soap” which placed him firmly on the song writing map!\n\nHe took a shot a recording as well doing so as “Russell Byrd” – He made one appearance on the Hot 100 with his song “You’d Better Come Home” in 1961.\n\nBert didn’t do too bad with another ditty, “Twist and Shout” big for the Isley Brothers and also big for the Fab Four. Berns would go to Atlantic Records as a producer replacing Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as staff producer!\n\n1964 saw Bert’s Keetch record label kick off with a single by Linda Laurie “Jose He Say”. That was a short-lived venture with only three releases – the others by the Mustangs and one by the Pussycats.\n\nLaurie had given us the rather strange “Ambrose Part 5” in 1958. I posted some time ago that Linda – just out of high school – provided the entire vocal narrative on Ambrose – including the seemingly deep male voice repeating “Just Keep Walking”.\n\nBert was comfortable composing both lyrics and the music but worked along the way with many talented song writers:\n\nPhil Medley (A Million to One – Jimmy Charles)\n\nBob Elgin (A Hundred Pounds of Clay – Gene McDaniels)\n\nNorman Meade (Time Is On My Side – The Rolling Stones)\n\nWes Farrell (Hang On Sloopy – The McCoys)\n\nJerry Wexler (Honey Love – The Drifters)\n\nMike Leander (Lady Godiva – Peter & Gordon)\n\nBob Feldman (What’s Gonna Happen When Summer’s Done – Freddy Cannon)\n\nJerry Goldstein (My Boyfriend’s Back – The Angels)\n\nRichard Gottehrer (Night Time – The Strangeloves)\n\nJeff Barry (Be My Baby – The Ronettes)\n\nLeiber and Stoller (Kansas City -Wilbert Harrison)\n\nIn 1965 Berns would give it another go, starting up the record label “BANG” which took the initials of it’s four founders, Bert Berns, Ahmet Ertegun, Nesuhi Ertegun and Gerald Wexler. Berns would assume complete control of BANG.\n\nBecause of his love of rhythm and blues, Berns would also start up Shout Records and would sign Freddie Scott, Erma Franklin, Donald Height, The Exciters, Deon Jackson, Jackie Moore and in 1970 the Equals from Great Britain.\n\nA motion picture documentary was produced on Bern’s life in 2016 titled “BANG! The Bert Berns Story”\n\nBert Russell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016 awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nRussell accomplished so much for such a tragically short lifetime – passing away at age 38 on December 30th, 1967 – It is hard to imagine what he might have left for all of us! More than two dozen songs from Russell’s pen charted after his death!\n\nBert Russell Berns Song Writer’s Discography\n\n45 – Bert and Bill Giant (Bert Russell) – Gettysburg Address b/w Wayward Man – November, 1959\n\n45 – Bert Berns – The Legend Of the Alamo b/w Gotta Travel On – October, 1960\n\n45 – Ted Taylor – Push, Push (recording as Austin Taylor) – Number 90 R&B Charts – November, 1960\n\n45 – George Hudson with The Kings Of Twist (Bert Berns) – Capitol Germany – It’s Twistin’ Time b/w Little Twister – 1961\n\n45 – Russell Byrd (Bert Russell) – You’d Better Come Home – Number 50 Hot 100 – May, 1961\n\n45 – Russell Byrd (Bert Berns) – You Better Come Home b/w Let’s Tell Him All About It – March, 1961\n\n45 – The Jarmels – A Little Big of Soap – Number 7 R&B – Number 12 Hot 100 – July, 1961\n\n45 – Arthur Prysock – One More Time – Number 5 R&B – August, 1961\n\n4 45 – George Hudson with The Kings Of Twist (Bert Berns) – Capitol Germany – My Blue Heaven Twist b/w Blueberry Hill-Twist – 1962\n\n45 – George Hudson with The Kings Of Twist (Bert Berns) – Capitol Germany – My Blue Heaven Twist b/w Blueberry Hill-Twist – 1962\n\n45 – Solomon Burke – Cry To Me – Number 5 R&B – Number 44 Hot 100 – January, 1962\n\n45 – George Hudson with Bert Berns – The Bug b/w Bronx Stomp (test pressing) – February, 1962\n\n45 – Russell Byrd (Bert Berns) – Little Bug b/w Nights Of Mexico – March, 1962\n\n45 – George Hudson with Bert Berns – I’m Popeye the Sailor Man b/w Bronx Stomp – March, 1962\n\n45 – Solomon Burke – Down In the Valley – Number 20 R&B – Number 71 Hot 100 – Number 19 Adult Contemporary – May, 1962\n\n45 – The Isley Brothers – Twist and Shout – Number 2 R&B – Number 17 Hot 100 – Number 42 UK – June, 1962\n\n45 – Gene Pitney – If I Didn’t Have a Dime (To Play The Jukebox) – Number 58 Hot 100 – September, 1962\n\n45 – George Hudson with The Kings Of Twist (Bert Berns) – Capitol Germany – Do The Limbo b/w Come On An’ Stop – 1963\n\n45 – Russell Byrd (Bert Berns) – Hitch Hike Pts 1 and 2 – October, 1963\n\n45 – The Exciters – Tell Him – Number 4 Hot 100 Number 5 R&B – Number 46 UK – December, 1962\n\n45 – The Rocky Fellers – Killer Joe – Number 16 Hot 100 – March, 1963\n\n45 – The Exciters – Get Him – Number 76 Hot 100 – June, 1963\n\n45 – Garnet Mimms – Cry Baby – Number 1 R&B – Number 4 Hot 100 – August, 1963\n\n45 – Betty Harris – Cry To Me – Number 10 R&B – Number 30 Hot 100 – August, 1963\n\n45 – Garnet Mimms – Baby Don’t You Weep – Number 11 R&B – Number 30 Hot 100 – November, 1963\n\n45 – Betty Harris – His Kiss – Number 15 R&B – Number 89 Hot 100 – January, 1964\n\n45 – Hoagy Lands – Baby Come On Home – Number 125 Bubbling Under – February, 1964\n\n45 – The Beatles – Twist and Shout – Number 2 Hot 100 – March, 1964\n\n45 – The Vibrations – My Girl Sloopy – Number 10 R&B – Number 26 Hot 100 – March, 1964\n\n45 – Ben E.

He began his career as a mambo dancer first in New York and then in neighboring Cuba before that country headed in another direction politically.\n\nBertrand returned to the United States and found his way into the famed “Brill Building” at 1650 Broadway working as a song composer at a salary of $50 a week. It wasn’t long before the move to composer paid dividends. A young group of singers out of Richmond, Virginia would record “A Little Big of Soap” which was released in July of 1961 by Roulette Records.\n\nThe song would go to number 12 on the Hot 100 and number 7 and the R&B charts giving the Jarmels their only charting single\n\nThen, in August of 1961, another Berns’ composition fell into the hands of producer Phil Spector. Atlantic Records’ brought a young duo into the studio, “The Top Notes” who were Derek Ray and Howard Guyton. Berns was present during the recording session and was aghast at the results. This was not one of Spector’s shining moments.\n\nSpector completely altered a good hunk of the song and thus, “Twist and Shout” would go nowhere for Atlantic and Berns. Later Atlantic Records’ executive Jerry Wexler admitted that he should have trusted the still-young Russell with production duties.\n\nAs we all know – fortunately, in the summer of 1962, another upcoming group of singers from Ohio, “The Isley Brothers”, would enter the recording studio accompanied by Berns. The Isley’s were looking for something to get them back on track.\n\nIn the fall of 1959 they had landed near the middle of the Hot 100 with “Shout – Part 1” which reached a respectable number 47 on the pop charts – But it did not manage to catch the attention of the R&B market. The Isley’s weren’t especially confident in the song’s potential – especially since it originally was slated to be assigned as the “B” side to Jerry Butler’s “Make It Easy On Yourself”.\n\nMuch to everyone’s delight the song roared into the Top 20 of the Hot 100 reaching number 17 and gave the Isley Brothers their first R&B hit, going all the way to number 2!\n\n“Twist and Shout” firmly established Bert Berns as a composer to be respected. Although his health would cast a dark cloud over the time he had remaining, he left his mark. Wexler would bring him into the Atlantic stable as their staff producer in 1963, replacing the great team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.\n\nBerns proved himself able to adapt, composing hits during the British Invasion era for American artists and hits for the Invaders as well.\n\nIn 1965, Berns teamed up with three others to form the “BANG” record label – taking first initials of the four operatives to name the label: Burt – Ahmet (Ertegun) – Nesuhi (Ertegun) and Gerald (‘Jerry’ Wexler). A year later Berns would establish the Shout record label where he had R&B hits by Freddie Scott and Erma Franklin.\n\nBert Burns would succumb to a failing heart – resulting from rheumatic fever contacted as a child. He died on December 30th, 1967 at the very young age of 38. He entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. His life was honored in the off-Broadway production of “Piece of My Heart – The Bert Berns Story”.\n\nBert Berns Selected Discography\n\nSongs composed co-composed by Bert Russell/Berns\n\n45 – Roulette 3098 – The Jarmels – “A Little Bit of Soap” – Number 12 Hot 100 – Number 7 R&B – July, 1961\n\n45 – Wand 124 – The Isley Brothers – “Twist and Shout” – Number 17 Hot 100 – Number 2 R&B – April, 1962\n\n45 – Atlantic 45-2131 – Solomon Burke – “Cry To Me” – Number 44 Hot 100 – Number 5 R&B – February, 1962\n\n45 – United Artists UA 544 – The Exciters – “Tell Him” – Number 4 Hot 100 – Number 5 R&B – December, 1962\n\n45 – United Artists UA 629 – Garnet Mimms & the Enchanters – “Cry Baby” – Number 4 Hot 100 – Number 1 R&B for 3 Weeks – September, 1963\n\n45 – Tollie 9001 – The Beatles – “Twist and Shout” – Number 2 Hot 100 – March, 1964\n\n45 – Atlantic 45-2221 – The Vibrations – “My Girl Sloopy” – Charted Number 26 Hot 100 – Number 12 R&B – March, 1964\n\n45 – Columbia UK DB 7247 – The Animals – “Baby Let Me Take You Home” – Number 21 – British Charts – April, 1964\n\nThis was the Animals debut charting record globally\n\n45 – Atlantic 45-2225 – The Drifters – “One Way Love – Number 56 Hot 100 – Number 12 R&B – May, 1964\n\n45 – Atlantic 45-2241 – Solomon Burke – “Everybody Needs Somebody To Love” – Number 58 Hot 100 – Number 4 R&B – July, 1964\n\n45 – Parlophone R 5173 – “One Way Love” – Number 9 British Charts – October, 1964\n\n45 – Decca UK F-12017 – Lulu – “Here Comes the Night” – Number 50 British Charts – November, 1964\n\n45 – Parrot 45-9749 – Them – “Here Comes the Night” – Number 24 – May, 1965\n\n45 – BANG B-501 – The Strangeloves – “I Want Candy” – Number 11 Hot 100 – June, 1965\n\n45 – BANG B-506 – The McCoys – “Hang On Sloopy” – Number 1 – August, 1965\n\n45 – United Artists UA 995 – Garnet Mimms – “I’ll Take Good Care Of You” – Number 30 Hot 100 – Number 15 R&B – April, 1966\n\n45 – Shout S 207 – Freddie Scott – “Are You Lonely For Me” – Number 39 Hot 100 – Number 1 R&B for 4 Weeks – December, 1966\n\n45 – Atlantic 45-2381 – Wilson Pickett – “Everybody Needs Somebody To Love” – Number 29 Hot 100 – Number 19 R&B – February, 1967\n\n45 – Shout 221 – Erma Franklin – “Piece of My Heart” – Number 62 Hot 100 – Number 10 R&B – October, 1967\n\n45 – Columbia 44626 – Big Brothers & The Holding Company – “Piece Of My Heart” – Number 12 Hot 100 – August, 1968\n\n45 – Gordy 7083 – Edwin Starr – “25 Miles” – Number 6 Hot 100 – Number 6 R&B – February, 1969\n\n45 – Columbia 4-45379 – Janis Joplin – “Cry Baby” – Number 42 Hot 100 – May, 1971\n\n45 – RCA PB-13204 – Bow Wow Wow – “I Want Candy” – Number 62 Hot 100 – May, 1982\n\n45 – Capitol 2654 – The Beatles – “Twist and Shout” – Number 23 Hot 100 – August, 1986"
