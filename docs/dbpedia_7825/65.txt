Biography

German classical philologist known in scholarly circles as a renowned authority on Ancient Greece and its literature. Wilamowitz is one of the central figures of 19th and 20th century Classical philology.

Wilamowitz studied Classical Philology at the University of Bonn. His teachers, Otto Jahn and Hermann Usener, had a formative influence on him. Willamowitz's relationship with Usener was strained. He developed a lifelong rivalry with his fellow student Friedrich Nietzsche and a close friendship with his contemporary Hermann Diels. Together with Diels, he moved to Berlin in 1869, where he graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy cum laude in 1870.

In 1878 he married Maria Mommsen, the eldest daughter of the famous ancient historian, Theodor Mommsen, whom he actively assisted in the completion of his Roman History.

Wilamowitz spent his last years in seclusion, suffering from severe kidney problems. He died in Berlin on 25 September 1931, having been in a coma for a short time. He is buried in his native village, along with his wife, Maria (1855–1936), and their only son, Tycho. He also had a daughter, Dorothea Freifrau Hiller von Gaertringen, wife of archaeologist Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen.

Source Notes

Sy Scholfield cites birth record quoted in "An der Geburtsstätte und am Grabe U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorffs," by P. Dräger, Gymnasium, Vol. 106 (C. Winter., 1999, pp. 99-151), p. 143: "„Geister sehen" konnte Wilamowitz nach eigenem Eingeständnis zwar nicht, zumal er auch noch entgegen seiner Versicherung, „Mittags Schlag zwölf" (note 186) geboren zu sein, nach amtlicher Beglaubigung bereits um vier Uhr morgens das Licht der Welt erblickte (note 187). ... 186: Mein Leben 17: „Am 22ten December 1848 bin ich, Ulrich Friedrich Wichard von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff geboren, und zwar Mittags Schlag zwölf, und das eines Freitags, so dass ich Geister sehen kann, was mir freilich bisher noch nicht passiert ist. 187: So die Geburtsurkunde im Staatsarchiv Bydgoszcz, Abteilung Inowroclaw, Duplicate der Kirchenbücher in Strzelno 1819-1849, Signatur 1, k. 1014-1015, nr. 14 (ebd.: Taufe [vgl. Erinnerungen 58] am 8.2.1849 durch Pastor Findeisen... "

The author notes that Wilamowitz wrote that he could not see ghosts even though he was born on a Friday at 12 noon, yet his birth certificate states he was born at 4 AM.
