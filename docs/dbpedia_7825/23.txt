Werner W. Jaeger, University Professor and author of several well-known works in philosophy and philology, will retire on June 30, after 20 years of service to the University.

As University Professor, Emeritus, Jaeger, now 70 years old, will continue to work on his ten-volume critical study of Gregory of Nyssa, the early Greek church father and Christian philosopher.

This spring Jaeger is teaching an undergraduate course on the philosophical development of Aristotle in Classics and Philosophy, in addition to a graduate seminar on Horace in the Classics Department. He is also director of the Institute for Classical Studies.

Jaeger's best-known works are Aristotle: Fundamentals of the History of His Development, which revolutionized Aristotelian scholarship 35 years ago, and Paideia, a three-volume study of the ideals of Greek culture.

These and other books on Plato, Aristotle, neo-Platonism, Demosthenes, the early Greek philosophers, Greek medicine, the early Christian writers, and the essence of humanism have appeared in Italian, Spanish, German, French, and Polish, as well as English editions.
