        "text": "There is an unfortunate narrative dispute taking place between those who listen to the scientific consensus on social isolation and those who defend obscurantism and necropolitics. This dispute can only occur now because there's a significant amount of human beings who have embraced scientific obscurantism and the most reactionary political and social thinking. If they aren't crazy in a medical sense, they definitely act as if they were by putting their own lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk. There is also the case that some of them have enough resources to isolate themselves and their families, but they preach an end to isolation for others, especially the poor. These people, in addition to being obscurantists, are also immoral. But something caught my attention in the midst of this surprising and insane battle: the glorification and romanticizing of work, especially when the obscurantists accuse those who favor social isolation of not wanting or not enjoying work—this would be a sin, somehow.\n\nThe Fall of Man and Expulsion from Eden, by Michelangelo\n\nThe protest caravans promoted by conservative and neoliberal political movements in Brazil in the last few weeks are good examples that these political trends do not accept that people need to stop working, even when they are at risk of becoming infected with a dangerous disease. The protests had the clear goal of embarrassing workers to return to their jobs. That is, when the situation becomes extremely unsafe, these movements do not defend the right of individuals to stop producing surplus value for the owners of the means of production.\n\nWork and suffering must have come into the world at some time; but they cannot be part of God's original perfect scheme of things. They were introduced, says Hesiod, speaking as a moralist, by the disastrous action of Prometheus in stealing the divine fire. To punish that deed, Zeus created the first woman, the crafty Pandora, mother of all womankind; out of Pandora's box came the demons of sickness and old age, with ten thousand other evils who now inhabit all the earth and all the sea. (JAEGER, 1947)\n\nTherefore, for the Greeks, work had a sinister origin. It was a curse, one of the many sufferings mankind was sentenced to. Even though Jaeger argues that work wasn't only seen in a negative light by the Ancient Greeks, he agrees that Greek society saw the mythical origins of work as being punitive. There was no work in the mythical “golden age” and, if there was something similar to work, it wasn't as arduous as man's labor during the “iron age”, which were the times that Ancient Greeks believed they belonged to. With the arrival of Greek philosophy, this negative view of work started to be rationalized, as we will see now.\n\nBut there needs to be ownership of property among them too, since it is necessary for citizens to have an ample supply, and these people are citizens. For the group of mechanical craftsmen does not take part in the city, nor does any other class whose craftsmanship is not directed at producing virtue. (...) So those without whom a city cannot be organized, and how many of them are parts of the city, have been described. For farmers and artisans and the whole class of menial workers are necessarily present in cities, but it is the arms-bearing and deliberating groups that are parts of the city. Each of these is separate, some permanently and others by turns. (ARISTOTLE, 2012)\n\nWith the advent of Christianity, at the end of antiquity, Western thought continued to regard work as a curse. Saint Augustine wrote in one of his sermons:\n\nA hard condition is the life of man. What else is it to be born, but to enter on a life of toil? Of our toil that is to be, the infant’s very cry is witness. From this cup of sorrow no one may be excused. The cup that Adam hath pledged, must be drunk. We were made, it is true, by the hands of Truth, but because of sin we were cast forth upon days of vanity. (AUGUSTINE, 2007)\n\nThis short genealogy is not exhaustive, of course. The concept of work has more complex nuances than this simplification. However, as an overview, we can say that this story is not incorrect, even though it lacks detail. I could have dealt more with how and when intellectual activities came to be considered work, or explained the Latin origin of the word “work” itself, which has to do with an instrument of torture.\n\nAlthough I did not delve deeper into the historical details, we can see how the idea of work has changed over the past 2,500 years. For most of that time, it was seen as a kind of divine punishment. It was only in the last 500 years that work began to be valued and gained an aura of nobility and dignity in popular imagination—even being the cause of ideological disputes between different political movements, each defending their vision of work as being the more dignified and noble one.\n\nHowever, I'll finish this essay with a touch of negative or pessimistic thinking, as usual. Cioran was a philosopher and author who constantly remembered the way the ancients thought about life—and also about work. His writings can be considered a denial of the optimistic and romanticized notions of progress and history. While Kant, Hegel, Marx and even Nietzsche saw the future as a time of achievement for humanity, a time when we'd have the opportunity to achieve something better—regardless of how each of them interpreted such improvement—Cioran saw the future the same as he saw the past and the present: man will work, die and suffer for nothing, until the day the species become extinct.\n\nThis author borrows the mythical vocabulary of ancient civilizations, both Western and Eastern, to explain the human situation in a similar, analogous way. Schopenhauer (2014; 2015) does the same in his writings, although his philosophy has a different basis than that of Cioran's. The appreciation for the idea that we were cursed is present in both philosophers. However, they don't really believe in a curse. The use of mythologies is only analogous for them. It is “as if” the world were a prison created by the gods to punish us for some original transgression—in the beginning of time there was a universal imbalance that caused us to fall into the universe of matter. Because of this event, we are forced to toil through sweat and tears.\n\n. CIORAN, Emil. Breviário de decomposição. Rio de Janeiro: Rocco Digital, 2014. Tradução: José Thomaz Brum.\n\n. CIORAN, Emil.
