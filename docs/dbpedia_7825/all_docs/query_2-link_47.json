        "text": "Robert J. Ball\n\nMost eloquent among the sons of Scotland, educated at Glasgow and Oxford, you have for the last forty years enriched the world of classical letters with the richness of your scholarship. You have been at once a support and an ornament to humane learning in this, your adopted country. Generations of Columbia students can testify to the scope of your erudition and the precision of your wit. In nearly a score of books – doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis – you have charted the enduring forms and themes of literature, with a spirit as indefatigable as it is passionate. A Varro in learning, a Cicero in eloquence, you have not only defended the vitality and grace of the classical tradition, you have also embodied it.\n\nSo spoke President William McGill at Columbia University’s 1977 commencement as he awarded a D.Litt. to Gilbert Highet (1906–78), regarded in his day as the most celebrated Classical scholar in America. In an era without the internet or podcasts or YouTube, Highet became a household name, with his distinctive voice reaching a worldwide audience through his books and lectures, heard even over the airwaves.\n\nCelebrity status seemed suited to (and even destined for) Highet, a native of Glasgow, who, as a youthful prodigy, dazzled his teachers at Hillhead High School. He attended Glasgow University on scholarships (1925–8), where he earned his M.A. (the first degree available, since Glasgow does not confer a B.A.), and Balliol, Oxford (1929–32), where he earned his B.A. At Balliol, he studied under three great teachers – Cyril Bailey, Maurice Bowra, and Gilbert Murray – who all contributed to his growth as a Classicist and to his future performance as a teacher and a lecturer. He taught at St John’s, Oxford (1933–7) as Fellow and Tutor, where he acquired an excellent reputation in the classroom and wrote two textbooks: An Outline of Homer (1935) and Beginning Latin (1938). During his final year at St John’s, Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia University, offered him the position of Visiting Associate for 1937–8, extending the offer allegedly at the suggestion of Bowra. Highet looked forward to living in America, troubled by the rigid class system in England and by what he perceived as an unconcern at Oxford dinner parties and high tables over the rise of Adolf Hitler. Within one year of accepting the temporary appointment at Columbia, Highet became a full Professor of Greek and Latin with tenure – an amazing achievement in those days for a man just turning 32.\n\nAs Highet’s celebrity was taking off in America, he was called up to serve in the British Army during World War II, on leave from Columbia from 1941 to 1946. Under Sir William Stephenson, Director of British Security Coordination for the Western Hemisphere, he served in the British Mission to the United States and in the British Intelligence Center in New York. While executing many secret missions, he drew up psychological profiles of such Nazi leaders as Hitler, Goebbels, Goering, and Himmler, which drew especially on his broad knowledge of the Roman emperors. While on duty in the British Zone of Occupation in Berlin, he entered the smoldering remains of Hitler’s bunker and eventually became responsible for helping to recover the gold reserves hidden by the Nazis. In Berlin, attending Jacques Offenbach’s opera The Tales of Hoffmann, he risked arrest by accidentally sitting in a stall reserved for a Russian general and his girlfriend, where the general repeatedly glowered at him. At the end of the war, he attended the Nuremberg trials, where he saw the surviving leaders of Nazi Germany, whom he regarded as the embodiment of pure evil, face the severe justice of their conquerors. He would refer in some of his books to the atrocities committed by the Nazis, especially Hitler’s perpetration of the Holocaust, and would (I dare say) express his outrage today over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHighet’s academic celebrity skyrocketed upon his return to Columbia, when he devoted all his energy to teaching and to writing about the great Classical works. When he entered the classroom, his students sensed that the curtain was going up on a Broadway play and compared him to such distinguished award-winning actors as Laurence Olivier and John Houseman. He would walk back and forth, even sing to illustrate a point, or slip into his Scottish burr to conclude an argument, as he did when he imitated a minister preaching hellfire and damnation to his congregation. He wielded a window-pole (a tool used at that time) to imitate a Roman legionnaire, or, impersonating Marius at the gates of Rome, he would crouch down and spring across the floor to battle his rival Sulla. With his Scottish-English brogue and his riveting, rapid-fire delivery, he would keep his students spellbound by means of his powerful lectures, brilliant in their organization and brimming with critical insight. The inspired anecdotes, the poignant pauses, and the sudden bursts of laughter all contributed to a tour de force that did not merely beguile his students but provided them with a solid foundation for learning. Although presented in a highly theatrical manner, his humane form of teaching involved a rigorous examination of a Classical author and the qualities that made that author memorable and worthy of reading.\n\nHighet achieved celebrity status not simply from his legendary performance on the campus but from his astounding visibility before the general educated public. He served as chief literary critic for Harper’s Magazine (1952–4), reviewing new books every month on various subjects, with his range reflected in the title of his column, which changed with every issue. As chair of the editorial advisory board for Horizon (1958–77), he wrote many articles, including his translation (preserving the original meters) of Menander’s newly discovered Dyscolus (“The Grumpy Old Man”). He served on the board of judges for the Book of the Month Club (1954–78), for which he published approximately 400 book reviews on great literature, music, and art in Book of the Month Club News. He charmed the general public with his weekly radio program “People, Places, and Books” (1952–9), ultimately carried by over 300 radio stations in the USA and Canada, as well as by the BBC and Voice of America. On 24 March 1968, he presented a lecture for CBS Television’s Camera Three on Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting The Peasant Wedding (1567), claiming to have identified in it the elusive bridegroom. While keeping his students on the edge of their seats in packed classrooms, he captivated the literary-minded layperson with his witty and incisive articles and lectures on Classical and contemporary subjects.\n\nEven Highet’s books on Classical subjects contributed to his celebrity, since he aimed most of them not only at scholars but also at the general educated public. The Classical Tradition (1949), his most famous work, provides a sweeping look at the Greek and Roman influences on Western literature from the decline of Classical civilization to the mid-20th century. In Juvenal the Satirist (1954), his most controversial book, he tries to reconstruct Juvenal’s life, analyzes each of his sixteen satires, and traces their reception from the early Roman Empire to modern times. Poets in a Landscape (1957), directed primarily at a general audience, considers seven Roman poets by examining various aspects of their poetry against a backdrop of the places in Italy in which they lived. In The Anatomy of Satire (1962), Highet examines satire from Classical antiquity to the 20th century within the context of what he regards as its three main patterns: monologue, parody, and narrative. The Speeches in Vergil’s Aeneid (1972), directed exclusively at a scholarly audience, examines all the speeches in Vergil’s epic in six carefully documented chapters and seven rigorously organized appendices. Highet’s celebrity, however, did not come without a price, bringing with it adverse criticism from those who, perhaps jealous of his astonishing achievements, accused him of promoting “middlebrow” culture.\n\nWearing his celebrity well, Highet also took pride in the celebrity of his wife, spy novelist Helen MacInnes (they had met as students at Glasgow University). Highet fully supported the career of his talented spouse, openly admitted that she had become more famous than he, and even devoted one of his radio lectures to his thoughts on being married to a writer. Highet and MacInnes brought to America’s literary scene what Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne brought to America’s theatrical scene – two remarkable couples who were celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic. At a time when male academics often treated their wives as domestic drones, Highet encouraged his wife to write her books and supported mature, hardworking female graduate students such as Froma Zeitlin. Professor Emerita at Princeton, Zeitlin recently shared with me her warm correspondence with Highet, confirming how he inspired her as a doctoral candidate and became the sponsor of her dissertation. Furthermore, Highet, as chair of Classics, invited Alan and Averil Cameron to teach at Columbia for the 1967–8 academic year – a subject I recently discussed with Averil, Professor Emerita at Oxford. Impressed by articles Alan and Averil had published, Highet again supported a female Classical scholar on the rise, although his invitation raised a question that would have no place in the hiring process today.\n\nHaving achieved his celebrity in an era that lacked the technology available today, Highet paved the way for Classicists to enjoy greater visibility than he did. Classicists such as Mary Beard, Bettany Hughes, Edith Hall, Tom Holland, and Daniel Mendelsohn have carried the torch forward in an inspiring effort to bring Classical culture to a broad general lay audience. With their stimulating presentations on the lecture circuit, in widely-read publications, and on the ever-expanding internet, today’s Classicists have exploited 21st-century technology to fulfill that goal. Celebrity today, however, does not come without one paying less of a price (perhaps even more of a price) than Highet did, since one’s detractors are also exploiting the technology to serve their own agenda. Cambridge’s Mary Beard, the most celebrated and sought-after Classicist of this generation, has become perhaps as controversial as Highet, and for reasons sometimes expressed via pseudonymous social media. Although Highet and Beard have both been called colonialists (a spiteful and highly subjective accusation), I prefer to think of them as champions of the Classical spirit and ambassadors of Classical civilization. I would also like to think of Beard and the four Classicists named above as seeing Highet as a predecessor who advanced the role of the public intellectual and pioneered a challenging path for others to follow.\n\nHighet’s celebrity lives on in the many publications about him or referring to him that have steadily appeared over the more than four decades since his death. I recently found an article about Highet written by the President Emeritus of the National University of Natural Medicine, who was directing his views on teaching at an audience of naturopathic physicians. I also recently came across another article about Highet by a respected London-based author, broadcaster, and non-residential Fellow at Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. One also finds a touching tribute to Highet in the very title of the book review called “The Incomparable Gilbert Highet,” by a Biblicist with a sustained research interest in the history of Classical scholarship. Highet himself asserted that a reviewer should strive to accentuate the positive, to sympathize with an author’s aspirations rather than demean a book for not being the book the reviewer would have written. Although Highet’s books received mostly positive reviews, they would occasionally receive a negative review, which, as Highet told his graduate students, he respected if the review seemed fair and balanced. But if the review accentuated the negative and disregarded the author’s aspirations, he asserted (justifiably, in my view) that it revealed a mean-spiritedness, a conspicuous flaw in the character of the reviewer.\n\nIn any case, I’ll take the Highet road (to playfully echo a famous Scottish song) in my unwavering zeal to keep alive the flame of the first celebrity Classicist, a truly extraordinary teacher and scholar. Beyond his love for teaching and writing, Highet pursued a lifelong passion for learning, which fueled his teaching – a passion one may find in the passage reproduced here, projecting values that still ring true:\n\nThe pleasures of learning are indeed pleasures. But in fact the word should be changed. The true name is happiness. There are three other types of happiness, superior to that of learning: the happiness of love fulfilled; the happiness of serving mankind; and the happiness of creation. Though it is beneath these, learning is still a great happiness, and can be a help toward the attainment of those others; and it is an essential part of a complete life. No learner has ever found that he ran short of subjects to explore. But many people who avoided learning, or abandoned it, find that life is drained dry. They spend thirty years in a club chair looking glumly out at the sand and the ocean; in a hotel lounge gossiping about the other inmates; in a porch swing waiting for somebody to drive down the road. But that is not how to live. The chief aim of education is to show you, after you make a livelihood, how to enjoy living; and you can live longest and best and most rewardingly by attaining and preserving the happiness of learning.\n\nRobert J. Ball, Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of Hawaii and a recipient of excellence in teaching awards from the University of Hawaii and from the American Philological Association (now the Society for Classical Studies), has published a book on Tibullus’ elegies, first-year and second-year Latin textbooks, and most recently the third installment of a book trilogy on Gilbert Highet, his inspirational mentor during his doctoral studies at Columbia University.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRobert J.
