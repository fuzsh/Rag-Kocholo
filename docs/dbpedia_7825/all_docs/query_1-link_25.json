        "text": "This note discusses one of the largely superfluous conjectures unearthed by J. Diggle and given an honourable place in his otherwise very succinct and efficient apparatus criticus. Reported by none of the recent editors, and earlier by Prinz–Wecklein and Verrall, Herwerden’s μελανόσπλαγχνος in Euripides’ Medea 109 is an undesirable change of the sound, if idiosyncratic, mss. reading μεγαλόσπλαγχνος. Diggle, however, having (independently) conjectured the same word, patched together arguments for it. An additional attraction this conjecture gained in his eyes was due to his misreading of the remark (quoted in the heading) Wilamowitz made proofreading the first volume of Murray’s OCT in 1901. While Wilamowitz discouraged Murray from reporting this conjecture with his usual “besser fort”, Diggle, on passing acquaintance with the letters, took it to mean “Herw. besser fort[asse]”, thus corroborating his point.\n\nA brilliant classicist and an editor of Greek tragedians on an altogether firmer footing of firsthand acquaintance with the manuscripts, Peter Elmsley (1774–1825) left quite a few conjectures of his own discreetly placed in the margin. While often palmary and deserving to be promoted into the text, ἀπλάτου in Eur. Medea 151 in the meaning ‘longing for the forsaken marital bed’ Elmsely imparted to it, sits ill in the broader context and, although accepted by the majority of editors has, in the course of its life, shifted in the direction of ‘unapproachable’, ‘monstrous’, to mean ‘the bed of death we should not approach’. Often unequivocal when referring to wild beasts of Heracles’ labours, in subtler contexts, like the one under discussion, it is often believed to be confounded with ἄπληστος often transmitted by part of the ms. tradition. In the case of Medea 151, however, the change is unnecessary, since ἄπληστος of LP can not only offer the meaning ‘insatiable’ referring to ‘marital bed’, but also the fear of the ‘overweening power’ of the ‘bed of death’ which suits what is the first reaction of the Chorus to Medea’s haughty desire to be struck by a thunderbolt of Zeus.\n\nThis note discusses one of the largely superfluous conjectures unearthed by J. Diggle and given an honourable place in his otherwise very succinct and efficient apparatus criticus. Reported by none of the recent editors, and earlier by Prinz–Wecklein and Verrall, Herwerden's μελανόσπλαγχνος in Euripides' Medea 109 is an undesirable change of the sound, if idiosyncratic, mss. reading μεγαλόσπλαγχνος.

While Wilamowitz discouraged Murray from reporting this conjecture with his usual \" besser fort \" , Diggle, on passing acquaintance with the letters, took it to mean \"Herw. besser fort[asse] \" , thus corroborating his point.\n\nThe constitutio textus of Aesch. Eum. ll. 352-3 = 365-6, in the context of the famous hymnos desmios intoned by the Furies shortly before Orestes' trial, aroused wide debate, and a large series of conjectures. After an introduction to the song, whose overall metric structure is presented in the light of the colometry transmitted by the manuscripts, we will focus once again on those lines, with the proposal of a new conjecture."
